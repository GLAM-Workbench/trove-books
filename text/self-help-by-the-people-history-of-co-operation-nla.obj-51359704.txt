The chapters of this little ‘History’ were commenced to be in-
serted in the Daily News (in 1857), as the reader may infer from
notes to Chapter I. The breaking out of the Mutinies in India
absorbed all space in that quarter, and prevented the completion of
the publication in those columns; otherwise, the subsequent chapters
might have been enriched by notes of the Editor of the Daily News,
whose great knowledge of, and interest in, Co-operative Associations,
abroad and at home, are well known.

CHAPTER I.
THE FIRST EFFORTS, AND THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO MADE THEM.
Human nature must be different in Eochdale from what it is else-
where. There must have been a special creation of mechanics in this
inexplicable district of Lancashire—-in no other way can you account
for the fact that they have mastered the art of acting together, and
holding together, as no other set of workmen in Great Britain have
done. They have acted upon Sir Kobert Peel’s memorable advice;
they have ‘ taken their own affairs into their own hands and what
is more to the purpose, they have kept them in their own hands.
The working class are not considered to be very rich in the quality
of self-trust, or mutual trust. The business habit is not thought to
be their forte. The art of creating a large concern, and governing aE
its complications, is not usually supposed to belong to them. The
problem of association has many times been tried among the people,
and as many times it has virtually failed. Mr. Eobert Owen has not
accomplished half he intended. The ‘ Christian Socialists,’ inspired
hy eloquent rectors, and directed by transcendent professors, aided by
the lawyer mind and the merchant mind, and what was of no small
importance, the very purse of Fortunatus himself,* have made but
poor work of association. They have hardly drawn a single tooth
from the dragon of competition. So far from having scotched that
ponderous snake, they appear to have added to its vitality, and to
have convinced parliamentary political economists that competitive
strife is the eternal and only self-acting principle of society. True,
reports come to us ever and anon that in America something has been
accomplished in the way of association. Far away in the backwoods
a tribe of bipeds—some mysterious cross between the German and the
Yankee—have been heard of, known to men as Shakers, who are sup-
posed to have killed the fatted calf of co-operation, and to he rich in
corn, and oil, and wine, and—to their honour be it said—in foundlings
and orphans, whom their sympathy collects, and their benevolence
rears. But then the Shakers have a narrow creed and no wives.
They ahbor matrimony and free inquiry. But in the constituency till
lately represented by Mr. Edward Miall, there is liberality of opinion
—Susannahs who might tempt the elders again—and rosy-cheeked
children, wild as heather and plentiful as buttercups. Under all the
(agreeable) disadvantages of matrimony and independent thought,
certain working men in Eochdale have practised the art of self-help,

the purse of Fortunatus. In France, we are assured all those * Associations Ouvriferes’

and of keeping the ‘ wolf from the door.’ That animal, supposed to
have been extirpated in the days of Ethelbert, is still found showing
himself in our crowded towns, and may be seen any day prowling on
the outskirts of civilisation.
At the close of the year 1843, on one of those damp, dark, dense,
dismal, disagreeable days, which no Frenchman can he got to admire
—such days as occur towards November, when the daylight is all
used up, and the sun has given up all attempt at shining, either in
disgust or despair—a few poor weavers out of employ, and nearly out
of food, an 4 quite out of heart with the social state, met together to
discover what they could do to better their industrial condition.
Manufacturers had capital, and shopkeepers the advantage of stock;
how could they succeed without either ? Should they avail them-
selves of the poor-law ? that were dependence; of emigration ? that
seemed like transportation for the crime of having been born poor.
What should they do? They would commence the battle of life
on their own account. They would, as far as they were concerned,
supersede tradesmen, millowners, and capitalists: without experience,
or knowledge, or funds, they would turn merchants and manu-
facturers. The subscription list was handed round—the Stock
Exchange would not think much of the result. A dozen of these
Lilliputian capitalists put down a weekly subscription of twopence
each—a sum which these Rochdale Rothschilds did not know how to
pay. After fifty-two ‘ calls ’ had been made upon these magnificent
shareholders, they would not have enough in their bank to buy a sack
of oatmeal with; yet these poor men now own mills, and warehouses,
and keep a grocer’s shop, where they take £76,000* a-year over the

their last quarterly report, which we subjoin, show their ready money

The origin of the Rochdale Store, which has transcended all co-
operative stores ever established in Great Britain, is to be traced to
the unsuccessful efforts of certain weavers to improve their wages.
Near the close of the year 1843, the flannel trade—one of the principal
manufactures of Rochdale—was brisk. At this auspicious juncture
the weavers, who were, and are still, a badly paid class of labourers,
took it into their heads to ask for an advance of wages- If their
masters could afford it at all, they could probably afford it then.
Their workpeople thought so, and the employers of Rochdale, who
are certainly among the best of their class, seemed to be of the same
opinion. Nearly each employer to whom the important question
was put, at once expressed his willingness to concede an advance, pro-
vided his neighbouring employers did the same. But how was the con-
sent of the others to be induced—and the collective agreement of all
to be guaranteed to each ? The thing seemed simple in theory, but
was anything but simple in practice. Masters are not always
courteous, and workpeople are not proverbially tacticians. Weavers
do not negotiate with their superiors by letter; a personal interview
is commonly the warlike expedient hit upon—an interview which the
servant obtrudes and the master suffers. An employer has no d priori
fondness for these kind of deputations, as a demand for an advance of
wages he cannot afford, may ruin him as quickly and completely as a
fall may distress the workmen. However, to set the thing going in a
practical and a kind way, one or two firms, with a generosity the men
still remember with gratitude, offered an advance of wages to their
own workpeople, upon trial, to see whether example would induce the
employers generally to imitate it. In case general compliance could
not be obtained, this special and experimental advance was to be taken
off again. Hereupon the Trades’ Union Committee, who had asked
the advance on behalf of the flannel weavers, held, in their humble
way, a grand consultation of ‘ ways and means.’ English mechanics
are not conspirators, and the working class have never been dis-
tinguished for their diplomatic successes. The plan of action adopted
by cur committee in this case did not involve many subtleties. After
speech-making enough to save the nation, it was agreed that one em-
ployer at a time should be asked for the advance of wages, and if he
did not comply, the weavers in his employ were ‘to strike ’ or ‘ turn
out,’ and the said ‘ strikers ’ and ‘ turn outs ’ were to be supported by
a subscription of twopence per week from each weaver who had the
good fortune to remain at work. This plan, if it lacked grace, had
the merit of being a neat and summary way of proceeding; and if it
presented no great attraction to the masters, it certainly presented
fewer to the men. At least Mrs. Jones with six children, and Mrs.
Smith with ten, could not be much in love with the twopenny pros-
pect held out to them, especially as they had experienced something

of the kind before, and had never been heard to very much commend
it.
The next thing was to carry out the plan. Of course, a deputation
of the masters waiting upon their colleagues would be the courteous
and proper thing, but obviously quite out of the question. A
deputation of employers could accomplish more in one day with em-
ployers than a deputation of all the men could accomplish in a month.
This, however, was not to be expected ; and a deputation of workmen
on this embassy was a rather uninteresting affair.
A trades’ deputation, in the old time, was a sort of forlorn hope of
industry—worse than the forlorn hope of war; for if the volunteers
of war succeed they commonly win renown, or save themselves;
but the men who volunteered on trades’ deputations were often
sacrificed in the act, or were marked men ever after. In war both
armies respect the ‘forlorn hope,’ but in industrial conflicts the
pioneer deputy was exposed to subsequent retaliation on the part of
mill-owners, who did not admire him ; and—let it be said in impar-
tiality, sad as the fact is—the said deputy was exposed often to the
wanton distrust of those who employed him. A trades’ deputation
was commonly composed of intelligent and active workmen; or, as
employers naturally thought them, ‘ dissatisfied, troublesome fellows.’
While on deputation duty, of course they must be absent from work.
During this time they must be supported by their fellow-workmen.
They were then open to the reproach of living on the wages of their
fellows, of loving deputation employment better than their own pro-
per work, which indeed was sometimes the case. Alas ! poor trade
deputy —he had a hard lot! He had for a time given up the service of
one master for the service of a thousand. He was now in the employ
of his fellows, half of whom criticised his conduct quite as severely as
his employer, and begrudged him his wages more. And when he re-
turned to his work he often found there was no work for him. In his
absence his overlooker had contrived (by orders) to supply his place,
and betrayed no anxiety to accommodate him with a new one. He then
tried other mills, but he found no one in want of his services. The
poor devil set off to surrounding districts, but his character had gone
before him. He might get an old fellow-workman (now an over-
looker) to set him on, at a distance from his residence, and he had
perhaps to walk five or six miles home to his supper, and be back at
his mill by six o’clock next morning. At last he removed his family
near his new employ. By this time it had reached his new employer’s
ears that he had a ‘ leader of the Trades’ Union ’ in his mill. His em-
ployer calculated that the new advance of wages had cost him altogether
a thousand pounds last year. He considered the weaver, smuggled into
his mill, the cause of that. He walked round and ‘ took stock ’ of him.
The next week the man was on the move again. After a while he
would fall into the state of being ‘ always out of work.’ No wonder
if the wife, who generally has the worst of it, with her increasing
family and decreasing means, began to reproach her husband with

having ruined himself and beggared his family by his ‘ trade unioning.’
As he was daily out looking for work he would be sometimes ‘treated’
by old comrades, and he naturally fell in with the only sympathy he
got. A ‘ row ’ perhaps occurred at the public-house, and somehow or
other he would be mixed up with it. In ordinary circumstances the
case would be dismissed —but the bench was partly composed of em-
ployers. The unlucky prisoner at the bar had been known to at least
one of the magistrates before as a ‘troublesome’ fellow, under other
circumstances. It is not quite clear that he was the guilty person in
this case; but as in the opinion of the master-magistrate he was quite
likely to have been guilty, he gave him the benefit of tlj,e doubt, and
the poor fellow stood ‘ remanded ’ or ‘ committed.’ The chief share-
holder of the Milldam Chronicle was commonly a mill-owner. The
reporter had a cue in that direction, and next day a significant para-
graph, with a heading to this effect, ‘ The notorious Tom Spindle in
trouble,’ carried consternation through the ranks of his old associates.
The next week the editor had a short article upon the ‘kind of leader-
ship to which misguided working men submit themselves.’ The case
was dead against poor Spindle. Tom’s character was gone. And if
he were detained long in prison, his family was gone too. Mrs. Spindle
had been turned out of her house, no rent being forthcoming. She
would apply to the parish for support for her children, where she
soon found that the relieving oificers had no very exalted opinion of
the virtues of her husband. Tom at length returned, and now he
would be looked upon by all who had the power to help him, as a
‘ worthless character,’ as well as a ‘ troublesome fellow.’ His fate was
for the future precarious. By odd helps and occasional employment
when hands were short, he eked out his existence. The present writer
has shared the humble hospitality of many such, and has listened half
the night away with them, as they have recounted the old story.
Beaten, consumptive, and poor, they had lost none of their old
courage, though all their strength was over, and a dull despair of
better days drew them nearer and nearer to the grave. Some of these
ruined deputationists have emigrated, and these lines will recall in
distant lands, in the swamps of the Mississippi, in the huts of a
Bendigo digging, and in the ‘ claims ’ of California, old times and
fruitless struggles, which sent them penniless and heart-broken from
the mills and mines of the old country. In the new land where they
now dwell—a strange dream land to them—their thoughts turn from
pine forests, night fires, and revolvers, to the old villages, the smoke-
choked tow Tis, and soot-hegrimed monotony in which their early life
was spent. Others of the abolished deputationists of whom we speak
turned news vendors or small shopkeepers. Assisted with a few shil-
lings by their neighbours—in some cases self-helped by their own
previous thrift—they have set up for themselves, have been fortunate,
grown independent, and trace all their good fortune to that day which
cost them their loss of employment.

CHAPTER II.
APPOINTMENT OF A DEPUTATION TO MASTERS. —GREAT DEBATE IN
THE FLANNED WEAVERS’ PARLIAMENT.
So much will enable the reader to understand the hopes and fears
which agitated the Rochdale Flannel Weavers’ Committee, when they
appointed their deputation to wait upon the masters. ‘Who shall
fo ? ’ No sooner was this question put than the loudest orators were'
ushed. Cries of ‘We will never submit ’ —‘ We will see whether the
masters are to have it their own way for ever,’ etc., etc., etc. —were
at once silenced. Five minutes ago everybody was forward—nobody
was forward now. As in the old fable, all the mice agreed that the
cat ought to be helled, hut who was to bell the cat ? The collective
wisdom of the Parliament of mice found that a perplexing question.
Has the reader seen a popular political meeting when some grand
question of party power had to he discussed ? How defiant ran the
speeches! how militant was the enthusiasm! Patriotism seemed to
he turning up its sleeves, and the country about to be saved that
night. Of a sudden some practical fellow, who has seen that kind of
thing before, suggests that the deliverance of the country will involve
some little affair of subscriptions—and proposes at once to circulate a
list. The sudden descent of the police, nor a discharge of arms from
the Chelsea Pensioners, would not produce so decorous a silence, nor
so miraculous a satisfaction with things as they are, as this little step.
An effect something like this is produced in a Trades’ Committee,
when the test question is put, ‘ Who will go on the deputation ?’ The
men knew that they should not be directly dismissed from their
employ, hut indirectly their fate would probably be sealed. The first
fault —the first accidental neglect of duty—would he the pretext of
dismissal. Like the archbishop in ‘ Gil Bias,’ who dismissed his critic
—not on account of his candour; his grace esteemed him for that—
hut he preferred a young man with a little more judgment. So the
employer has no abstract objection to the workman seeking to better
his condition—he rather applauds that kind of thing—he merely dis-
putes the special method .taken to accomplish it. The reader,
therefore, understands why our Committee suddenly paused when a
mouse was wanted to bell the cat. Some masters—indeed many
masters —are as considerate, as self-sacrificing, as any workmen are,
and they often incur risks and losses to keep their people in employ,
which their people never know, and, in many cases, would not
appreciate if they did. Many Trades’ Unionists are ignorant, incon-
siderate, and perversely antagonistic. It would he equally false to
condemn all masters as to praise all men. But after all allowances
are made, the men have the worst of it. They make things bad for
themselves and for their masters by their want of knowledge. If they

do not form some kind of Trades’ Union they cannot save their wages,
and if they do form Unions they cannot save themselves. Industry
in England is a chopping machine, and if the poor man does not take
care he is always under the knife.
We will now tell how the Flannel Weavers of Rochdale, whose
historians we are, have contrived to extricate themselves somewhat.
Our Trades’ Committee numbered, as all these committees do, a few
plucky fellows, and a deputation was eventually appointed, and set
off' on their mission. Many employers made the required advance,
but others, rather than do so, would let their works stop. This
resistance proved fatal to the scheme, seconded as it was by the im-
petuosity of the weavers themselves, who did not understand that you
cannot fight capital without capital. The only chance you have is
to use your brains, and unless your brains are good for something,
are well informed and well-disciplined, the chance is a very poor one.
Our flannel weavers did not use their brains but their passions. It is
easier to hate than to think, and the men did what they could do best
—they determined to retaliate, and turned out in greater numbers
than their comrades at work were able or willing to support. The
cooler and wiser heads advised more caution. But among the working
class a majority are found who vote moderation to be treachery. The
weavers failed at this time to raise their wages, and their employers
succeeded, not so much because they were right, as because their
opponents were impetuous.
At this period the views of Mr. Robert Owen, which had been often
advocated in Rochdale, were recurred to by the weavers. Socialist
advocates, whatever faults they else might have, had at least done one
service to employers—they had taught workmen to reason upon
their condition—they had shown them that commerce was a system,
and that masters were slaves of it as well as men. The masters’
chains were perhaps of silver, while the workmen’s were of copper,
but masters could not always do quite as they would any more than
their servants. And if the men became masters to-morrow, they
would be found doing pretty much as masters now do. Circumstances
alter cases, and the social reformers sought to alter the circum-
stances in order to improve the cases. The merit of their own scheme
of improvement might be questionable, but the Socialism of this
period marked the time when industrial agitation first took to
reasoning.* Ebenezer Elliott’s epigram, which he once repeated as an
* Chartists have always complained that their most active men were won from them by
the new logic of the Social Reformers. Indeed, some Social reformers conceived a dis-
trust of political reform as absurd as that professed by many Chartists for social reform;
but the ‘ Doctrine of Circumstances’ had one moralising effect upon the multitude —it taught
them to regard with pity many opponents whose throats they otherwise would have cut
with pleasure. Coleridge has owned (The Friend , p. 263, vol. ii.) to the pacific influence
of this doctrine on his own spirit when excited by a sense of injury received. When the
Bishop of Exeter called attention to the evil he discovered in the ‘ Doctrine of Circum-
stances,’ he omitted to notice that if it sometimes weakened moral effort, it always dimin-
ished hatred, a fact of great political importance in a country where class rivalry is
intense, and where the poor grow poorer as the rich grow richer, except where private
benevolence steps in to bridge over the inequality.

argument to the present writer, pointed to doctrines that certainly
never existed in England:—
‘What is a Communist? One who hath yearnings
For equal division of unequal earnings;
Idler or bungler, or both, he is willing
To fork out his penny, and pocket your shilling.’
The English working class have no weakness in the way of idle-
ness ; they never become dangerous until they have nothing to do.
Their revolutionary cry is always ‘ more work ! ’ They never ask for
bread half so eagerly as they ask for employment. Communists in
England were never either ‘ idlers or bunglers.’ When the Bishop of
Exeter, to whom we have referred, troubled Parliament, in 1840,
with a motion for the suppression of Socialism, an inquiry was sent to
the police authorities of the principal towns as to the character of the
persons holding those opinions (the same who built in Manchester the
Hall of Science, now the Free Library, at an expense of .£6OOO or
£7000). The answer was that these persons consisted of the most
skilled, well-conducted, and intelligent of the working class. Sir
Charles Shaw sent to the Manchester Social Institution for some
one to call upon him, that he might make inquiries relative to
special proceedings. Mr. Lloyd Jones went to him, and Sir Charles
Shaw said, that when he took office as the superintendent of the
police of that district, he gave orders that the religious profession of
every individual taken to the station-house should be noted; and he
had had prisoners of all religious denominations, but never one
Socialist. Sir C. Shaw said, also, that he was in the habit of pur-
chasing all the publications of the Society, and he was convinced,
that if they had not influenced the public mind very materially, the
outbreaks at the time, when they wanted to introduce the ‘ general
holiday,’ would have been much worse than they were, and he was
quite willing to state that before the government, if he should be
called upon to give an Opinion.
The followers of Mr. Owen were never the ‘ idlers,’ but the phi-
lanthropic. They might be dreamers, but they were not knaves.
They protested against competition as leading to immorality. Their
objections to it were theoretically acquired. They were none of
them afraid of competition, for out of the Socialists of 1840 have pro-
ceeded the most enterprising emigrants, and the most spirited men of
business who have risen from the working classes. The world is
dotted with them at the present hour, and the history of the Rochdale
Pioneers is another proof that they were not ‘ bunglers.’ Ho popular
movement in England ever produced so many persons able to take
care of themselves as the agitation of Social Reform. Moreover, the
pages of the New Moral World and the Northern Star of this period
amply testify that the Social Reformers were opposed to ‘ strikes,’ as
an untutored and often frantic method of industrial rectification ; as
wanting foresight, calculation, and fitness; as an irritation, a waste ol
money and temper. And when a strike led, as they often have done,

to workmen coercing their comrades, and forcibly preventing those
who were willing to work at the objectionable rate, from doing so, the
strike became an injustice and a tyranny, vexatious, disreputable, and
indefensible.
As there was a general feeling that the masters who had refused
their demands had not done them justice, they resolved to attain it in
some other way. They were, as Emerson expresses it, ‘English
enough never to think of giving up.’ Hereupon they fell back upon
that talismanic and inevitable twopence, with which Rochdale mani-
festly thinks the world can be saved. It was resolved to continue the
old subscription of twopence a week, with a view to commence
manufacturing, and becoming their own employers. As they were
few in number, they found that their banking account of two-
pences was likely to he a long time in accumulating, and some of
the committee began to despair; and, as nothing is too small for
poverty to covet, some of them proposed to divide the small sum
collected.
At this period a Sunday afternoon discussion used to be held in the
Temperance or Chartist Reading Room. Into this arena some mem-
bers of the weavers’ committee carried their anxieties and projects,
and the question was formally proposed, ‘ What are the best means
of improving the condition of the people ?’ It would be too long to
report the anxious and Babel disputation. Each orator, as in more
illustrious assemblies, had his own infallible specific for the deliverance
of mankind. The Teetotallers argued that the right thing to do was to
go in for total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks, and to apply the
wages they earned exclusively to the support of their families. This was
all very well, but it implied that everything was right in the industrial
world, and that the mechanic had nothing to do but to keep sober in
order to grow rich; it implied that work was sufficiently plentiful
and sufficiently paid for; and that masters, on the whole, were
sufficiently considerate of the workman’s interests. As all these points
were unhappily contradicted by the experience of every one concerned,
the Teetotal project did not take effect.
Next, the Chartists pleaded that agitation, until they got the
People’s Charter, was the only honest thing to attempt, and the only
likely thing to succeed. Universal Suffrage once obtained, people
would be their own law makers, and, therefore, could remove any
grievance at will. This was another desirable project somewhat over-
rated. It implies that all other agitations should be suspended while
this proceeds. It implies that public felicity can be voted at dis-
cretion, and assumes that acts of parliament are omnipotent over
human happiness. Social progress, however, is no invention of the
House of Commons, nor would a Chartist parliament be able to
abolish all our grievances at will; but Chartists having to suffer as
well as other classes, ought to be allowed an equal opportunity of
trying their hand at parliamentary salvation. The Universal Suffrage
agitation scheme was looked upon very favourably by the com-

mittee, and would probably have been adopted, had not the Socialists
argued that the day of redemption would prove to be considerably
adjourned if they waited till all the people took the Pledge, and the
government went in for the Charter. They, therefore, suggested that
the weavers should co-operate and use such means as they had at
command to improve their condition, without ceasing to be either
Teetotallers or Chartists.
In the end it came about that the Flannel Weavers’ Committee
took the advice of the advocates of co-operation. James Daly, Charles
Howarth, James Smithies, John Hill, and John Bent, appear to he
the names of those who in this way assisted the committee. Meetings
were held, and plans for a Co-operative Provision Store were deter-
mined upon. So far from there being any desire to evade responsi-
bility, as working class commentators in Parliament usually assume,
these communistic-teetotal-political co-operators coveted from the
first, a legal position; they determined that the society should be
enrolled, under Acts of Parliament, 10th Geo. IV., c. 56, and 4th
and sth William IV., c: 40.
CHAPTER III.

Next, our weavers determined that the society should transact its
business upon what they denominated the ‘ ready money principle.’
It might be suspected that the weekly accumulation of twopences
would not enable them to give much credit; but the determination
arose chiefly from moral considerations. It was a part of their
socialistic education to regard credit as a social evil—as a sign of the
anxiety, excitement, and fraud of competition. As Social Reformers,
they had been taught to believe that it would be better for society,
and that commercial transactions would be simpler and honester,
if credit were abolished. This was a radical objection to credit.*
However advantageous and indispensable credit is in general com-
merce, it would have been a fatal instrument in their hands.
Some of them would object to take an oath, and the magistrate would
object to administer it, thus they would be at the mercy of the dis-

well known, and for trifling sums. All prices would sink to the scale of cash prices. The
dishonourable system of fashionable debtors, who always pay too late, if at all,and cast their
deficiencies on other customers in the form of increased charges, would be at once
annihilated. Shopkeepers would be rid ot a great deal of care which ruins the happiness

honest who would come in and plunder them, as happens daily now
where the claim turns upon the oath.* Besides, some of them had a
tenderness with respect to suing, and would rather lose money than
go to law to get it; they, therefore, prudently fortified themselves by
setting their faces against all credit, and from this resolution they
have never departed.
From the Rational Sick and Burial Society’s laws, a Manchester
communistic production, they borrowed all the features applicable to
their project, and with alterations and additions their society was
registered, October 24th, 1844, under the title of the ‘Rochdale Society
of Equitable Pioneers.’ Marvellous as has been their subsequent suc-
cess, their early dream was much more stupendous—in fact, it
amounted to world making. Our pioneers set forth their designs in
the following amusing language, to which designs the society has;
steadily adhered, and has reiterated the same terms much nearer the
day of their accomplishment (in the Society’s Almanack for 1854).
These Pioneers, in 1844, declared the views of their Association thus:—
‘ The objects and plans of this Society are to form arrangements for
the pecuniary benefit and the improvement of the social and domestic
condition of its members, by raising a sufficient amount of capital in
shares of one pound each, to bring into operation the following plans
and arrangements: —
‘ The establishment of a Store for the sale of provisions, clothing,
etc.
‘ The building, purchasing, or erecting a number of houses, in
which those members, desiring to assist each other in improving their
domestic and social condition, may reside.
‘ To commence the manufacture of such articles as the society may
determine upon, for the employment of such members as may be
without employment, or who may be suffering in consequence of
repeated reductions in their wages.
‘As a further benefit and security to the members of this society,
the society shall purchase or rent an estate or estates of land, which
shall be cultivated by the members who may be out of employment,
or whose labour may be badly remunerated.’
Then follows a project which no nation has ever attempted, and no
enthusiasts yet carried out: —
‘ That, as soon as practicable, this society shall proceed to arrange
the powers of production, distribution, education, and government ; or, in
other words, to establish a self-supporting home-colony of united
interests, or assist other societies in establishing such colonies.’
Here was a grand paper constitution for re-arranging the powers of
* In those days the working class were justified in their jealousy of those set ‘in
authority over them,’ to an extent happily less credible now. So late as February, 1849,
our co-operators stipulated that a clause should be inserted in a lease of premises they were
about to take, to the effect that it should not be invalid upon a conviction of nuisance
against them. Their pacific objects might be sworn as a ‘ nuisance *by enemies, and ma-
gistrates on the bench, finding them legally defenceless, might listen to prejudice against
them. Such cases have occurred elsewhere.

production and distribution, which it has taken fifteen years of dreary
and patient labour to advance half way.
Then follows a minor but characteristic proposition:—
‘That, for the promotion of sobriety, a Temperance Hotel be opened
in one of the society’s houses as soon as convenient.’
If these grand projects were to take effect any sooner than universal
Teetotalism or universal Chartism, it was quite clear that some activity
must take place in the collection of the twopences. The difficulty in
all working class movements is the collection of means. At this time
the members of the ‘ Equitable Pioneer Society ’ numbered about
forty subscribers, living in various parts of the town, and many of
them in the suburbs. The collector of the forty subscriptions would
probably have to travel twenty miles; only a man with the devotion
of a missionary could be expected to undertake this task. This is
always the impediment in the way of working class subscriptions. If a
man’s time were worth anything at all, he had better subscribe the whole
money than collect it. But there was no other way open to them;
and, irksome as it was, some undertook it, and, to their honour, per-
formed what they undertook.* Three collectors were appointed, who
visited the members at their residences every Sunday; the town being
divided into three districts. To accelerate proceedings an innovation
was made, which must at the time have created considerable excite-
ment. The ancient twopence was departed from, and the subscription
raised to threepence. The co-operators were evidently growing
ambitious. At length the formidable sum of £2B was accumulated,
and, with this capital, the new world, that was to be, was commenced.
Fifteen years ago, Toad Lane, Kochdale, was not a very inviting
street. Its name did it no injustice. The groundfloor of a ware-
house in Toad Lane was the place selected in which to commence
operations. Lancashire warehouses were not then the grand things
they have since become, and the groundfloor of ‘ Mr. Dunlop’s
premises,’ here employed, was obtained upon a lease of three years at
£lO per annum. Mr. William Cooper was appointed ‘cashier;’ his
duties were very light at first. Samuel Ashworth was dignified with
* The executive policy of democracies is in a very crude state among the people. Time
and zeal are wasted wofully. A committee of thirteen working men sometimes debate half
an evening away as to whether ninepence or thirteenpence shall be expended upon a
broom. Money ought not to be wasted upon brooms, nor ought hard-reared zeal to be ex-
pended in the study of the petty cash book. Illustrations occur in the minutes of the
Rochdale Society. ‘ Resolved, that the two parties attending the Bank on business receive
the sum of sixpence each, and the third party twopence.’ (June 10, 1850.) Judging by
the remuneration, the transactions could not have been very responsible. ‘ Resolved, that
the shopmen be presented with an apron and sleeves each, in consideration of having to
make up some had money.’ (Feb. 28, 1850.) This is a very amusing instance of economical
compensation. ‘ Resolved, that we have two cisterns for treacle, two patent taps from
Bradford, a shovel for sugar, and one for currants, and that the step-ladder be repaired.’
(May 9, 1850.) ‘ Resolved, that the grate at the back of the wholesale warehouse be opened
lor air.’ (March 6, 1851.) ‘ Resolved, that there be a watering-can provided for the store.’
(March 28, 1852.) No doubt a protracted debate, five speeches each all round, seven or eight
explanations, and heavy replies by the mover and seconder, preceded these momentous
resolutions.

the nomination of ‘ salesman; ’ his commodities consisted of infini-
tesimal quantities of ‘ flour, butter, sugar, and oatmeal.’* The entire
quantity would hardly stock a homoeopathic grocer’s shop, for after
purchasing and consistently paying for the necessary fixtures, £l4 or
£ls was all they had to invest in stock. And on one desperate
evening—it was the longest evening of the year—the 21stof December,
1844, the ‘Equitable Pioneers’ commenced business; and the few who
remember the commencement, look back upon their present opulence
and success with a smile at their extraordinary opening day. It had
got wind among the tradesmen of the town that their competitors
were in the field, and many a curious eye was that day turned up
Toad Lane, looking for the appearance of the enemy; but, like other
enemies of more historic renown, they were rather shy of appearing.
A few of the co-operators had clandestinely assembled to witness their
own denouement; and there they stood, in that dismal lower room of
the warehouse, like the conspirators under Guy Fawkes in the Par-
liamentary cellars, debating on whom should devolve the temerity of
taking down the shutters, and displaying their humble preparations.
One did not like to do it, and another did not like to be seen in the
shop when it was done: however, having gone so far there was no
choice but to go further, and at length one bold fellow, utterly reck-
less of consequences, rushed at the shutters, and in a few minutes
Toad Lane was in a titter. Lancashire has its gamins as well as
Paris—in fact, all towns have their characteristic urchins, who display
a precocious sense of the ridiculous. The ‘ doffers ’ are the gamins of
Rochdale. The ‘doffers ’ are lads from ten to fifteen, who take off full
bobbins from the spindles, and put them on empty ones.f Like, steam
to the engine, they are the indispensable accessories to the mills.
When they are absent the men have to play, and often when the men
want a holiday, the ‘ doffers ’ get to understand it by some of those
signs very well understood in the freemasonry of the factory craft,
and the young rascals run away in a body, and, of course, the men
have to play until the rebellious urchins return to their allegiance.
On the night when our store was opened, the ‘ doffers ’ came out
strong in Toad Lane—peeping with ridiculous impertinence round
the corners, ventilating their opinion at the top of their voices, or
standing before the door, inspecting, with pertinacious insolence, the
scanty arrangement of butter and oatmeal; at length, they exclaimed
in a chorus, ‘ Aye! the owd weaver’s shop is opened at last.’
Since that time two generations of ‘ doffers ’ have bought their
butter and oatmeal at the ‘ owd weaver’s shop,’ and many a bountiful
and wholesome meal, and many a warm jacket have they had from
that store, which articles would never have reached their stomachs or
their shoulders, had it not been for the provident temerity of the co-
operative weavers.
• These are the articles specified in the minutes of Dec. 12,1844.

Toad Lane in 1844. The opening day of the Co-operative Store.


Very speedily, however, our embryo co-operators discovered that
they had more serious obstacles to contend with than derision of the
‘ doffers.’ The smallness of their capital compelled them to purchase
their commodities in small quantities, and at disadvantage both of
quality and price. In addition to this, some of their own members
were in debt to their own shopkeepers, and they neither could, nor
dare, trade with the store. And, as always happens in these humble
movements, many of the members did not see the wisdom of pro-
moting their own interests, or were diverted from doing it, if it cost
them a little trouble, or involved some temporary sacrifice. Of course
the quality of the goods was sometimes inferior, and sometimes the
price was a trifle higher. These considerations, temporary and trifling
compared with the object sought, would often deter some from be-
coming purchasers, for whose exclusive benefit the store was projected.
If the husband saw what his duty was, he could not always bring his
wife to see it; and unless the wife is thoroughly sensible, and
thoroughly interested in the welfare of such a movement, its success
must be very limited. If the wife will take a little trouble, and bear
with the temporary sacrifice of buying now and then an article she
does not quite like, and will send a little farther for her purchases
than perhaps suits her convenience, and will sometimes agree to pay
a little more for them than the shop next door would charge, the co-
operative stores might always become successful. Pure quality, good
weight, honest measure, and fair dealing within the establishment,
buying without higgling, and selling without fraud, are sources of
moral and physical satisfaction of far more consequence to a well-
trained person than a farthing in the pound cheaper, which the same
goods might elsewhere cost. How heavily are we taxed to put down
vice when it has grown up—yet how reluctant are we to tax ourselves
ever so lightly to prevent it arising. If there are to be moral sellers,
there must be moral buyers. It is idle to distinguish the seller as an
indirect cheat, so long as the customer is but an ambiguous knave.
Those dealers who make it a point always to sell cheaper than any
one else, must make up their minds to the risk of dishonesty, to the
driving of hard bargains, or of stooping to adulterations. Our little
store thought more of improving the moral character of trade than of
making large profits. In this respect they have educated their
associates and customers to a higher point of character. The first
members of the store were not all sensible of this, and their support
was consequently slender, like their knowledge. But a staunch section
of them were true co-operators, and would come far or near to make
their purchases, and, whether the price was high or low, the quality good
or bad, they bought, because it was their duty to buy. The men were
determined, and the women no less enthusiastic, willing, and content.
Those members of the store who were true to their own duty, were
naturally impatient that all the other members should do the same;
they expected that every other member should buy at the store what-
ever the store sold, that the said member purchased elsewhere. Not con-

tent with wishing this, they sought to compel all members to become
traders with the store; and James Daly, the then secretary, brought
forward a resolution to the effect that those members who did not
trade with the store should be paid out. Charles Howarth opposed
this motion, on the very proper ground that it would destroy the free
action of the members. He desired co-operation to advance, he said
he would do all he could to promote it; that freedom was a principle
which he liked absolutely, and, rather than give it up, he would
forego the advantages of co-operation. It will be seen, as our little
history progresses, that this love of principle has never died out, nor,
indeed, been impaired amid these resolute co-operators. James
Daly’s motion was withdrawn.
CHAPTER IV.
THE SOCIETY TRIED BY TWO WELL-KNOWN DIFFICULTIES —PREJUDICE
AND SECTARIANISM.
In March, 1845, it was resolved that a license for the sale of tea and
tobacco be taken out for the next quarter, in the name of Charles
Howarth. This step evidently involved the employment of more
capital; for though the members had increased, funds had not in-
creased sufficiently for this purpose. The members, in public meeting
assembled, were made aware of this foot; then, for the second time in
the history of the Rochdale Store, do we hear of any member being
in possession of more than twopence. One member ‘ promised to find*
half-a-crown. ‘Promised to find’ is the phrase employed on the
occasion—it was not ‘promised to pay, or subscribe, or advance.’
‘Promised to find’ probably alluded to some mysterious effort re-
quired to produce a larger sum than twopence in those parts. Another
member ‘promised to find’ five shillings, and another ‘promised to
find’ a pound. This last announcement was received with con-
sternation, and the rich and reckless man who made the promise was
regarded with double veneration, as being at once a millionaire and a
martyr.* Other members ‘promised to find’ various sums in propor-
tion to their means, and in due time the husbands could get from the
store the solace of tobacco, and wives the solace of tea. At the close
of 1845 the store numbered upwards of eighty members, and possessed

the Society at its fifth meeting, September 12th, 1844. It does seem like poking
fan at the thing to make this note, but those concerned know It to be ludicrously
true. The present writer well remembers the feeling of exultation with which
the important accession of XI was accomplished; and there was only Mr. Mallalieu in all
Rochdale at that time, willing and able to help the humble movement to that extent. They
little expected, ten years later, to be able to put this minute upon their books— * Resolved,

a capital of £lßl 12s. 3d.* At first the store paid 2J per cent,
interest on money borrowed, then 4 per cent. After paying this
interest, and the small expenses of management, all profits made were
divided among the purchasers at the store, in proportion to the
amount expended; and the members soon began to appreciate this
very palpable and desirable addition to their income. Instead of their
getting into debt at the grocer’s, the store was becoming a savings’
bank to the members, and saved money for them without trouble to
themselves. The weekly receipt for goods sold during the quarter
ending December, 1845, averaged upwards of £3O.
‘ The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, held in Toad Lane,
in the Parish of Rochdale, in the County of Lancaster,’ made up its
mind that a capital of £I,OOO must be raised for the establishment of
the store. This sum was to be raised by £1 shares, of which each
member should be required to hold four and no more. In case more
than £I,OOO was required, it was to be lawful for a member to hold five
shares. At the commencement of the store, it was allowed a member to
have any number of shares under fifty-one. The chances of any member
availing himself of this opportunity were very dreary. But the
officers were ordered, and empowered, and commanded to buy down
all fifty-pound shares with all convenient speed; and any member
holding more than four shares was compelled to sell the surplus at
their original cost of £l, when applied to by the officers of the
Society. But should a member be thrown out of employment, he
was then allowed to sell his shares to the board of directors, or other
member, by arrangement, which would enable him to obtain a higher
value. Each member of the Society, on his admission night, had to
appear personally in the meeting room and state his willingness to
take out four shares of £1 each, and to pay a deposit of not less than
threepence per share, or one shilling, and to pay not less than three-
pence per week after, and to allow all interests and profits that might
be due to him to remain in the funds until the amount was equal to
four shares in the capital.
Any member neglecting his payments was to be liable to a fine,
except the neglect arose from distress, sickness, or want of em-
ployment.
When overtaken by distress, a member was allowed to sell all his
shares, save one.
The earliest rules of the Society, printed in 1844, have, of course,
undergone successive amendments; but the germs of all their existing
rules were there. Every member was to be formally proposed, his
name, trade, and residence made known to every one concerned, and
a general meeting effected his election.
The officers of the Society included a President, Treasurer, and

HISTOEr OF TUB
First social effects of the experiment. Early rules of the Society.


Secretary, elected half-yearly, with three Trustees and five Directors.
Auditors as usual.
The officers and Directors were to meet every Thursday evening,
at eight o’clock, in the committee room of the Weavers’ Arms,
Yorkshire Street. Then followed all the heavy regulations, common
to enrolled societies, for taking care of money before they had it.
The only hearty thing in the whole rules, and which does not give
you the tic doloreux in reading it, is an appointment that an an-
nual general meeting shall be holden on the 4 first market Tuesday,'
at which a dinner shall be provided at one shilling each, to celebrate
the anniversary of the grand opening of the Store. At which
occasion, no the present historian has not the report
before him, the first sentiment given was ‘ Th’ owd Weyvurs’ Shop,’
followed by a chorus from the 4 Doifers.’
The gustativeness of the members appears not to have sustained an
annual dinner, for in 1847* we find records of the annual celebration
assuming the form of a ‘ tea party,’ to which, in right propagandist
spirit, certain Bacup co-operators were invited.
The Store itself was ordered to be opened to the public (who never
came in those days at all) on the evenings of Mondays and Saturdays
only—from seven to nine on Mondays, from six to eleven on Saturdays.
It would appear from this arrangement, that the poor flannel weavers
only bought twice a week in those times. A dreadful string of fines is
attached to the laws of 1844. The value of a Trustee or Director
may be estimated by the fact, that his fine for non-attendance was
sixpence. It is plain that the Society expected to lose only half-a-
crown if the whole five ran away. However, they proved to be worth
more than the very humble price they put upon themselves. Under
their management members rapidly increased, and the Store was
opened (March 3, 1845) on additional days, and for a greater number
of hours:—
Monday from 4 to 9 p.m.
Wednesday „ 7 to 9 „
Thursday „ 8 to 10 „
Friday „ 7 to 9 „
Saturday „ 1 to 11 „
On February 2nd, 1846, it was resolved that the Store be opened
on Saturday afternoons for the meeting of members; an indication
that the business of the Store was becoming interesting, and required
more attention than the weavers were able to give it after their long
day’s labour was over. In the October of this year, the Store com-
menced selling butcher’s meat. For the three years 1846-8, the
Store was tried by dulness, apathy, and public distress. It made
slow, but it made certain progress under them all. Very few new
members were added during 1846 ; but the capital of the Society in-

creased to £252 7s. IJd., with weekly receipts for goods averaging
£34 for the December quarter.
In case of distress occurring to a member, we have seen that he was
permitted to dispose of his shares, retaining only one. During 1847
trade was bad, and many of the members withdrew part of their shares.
Nothing can better show the soundness of the advantages created by
the society, than the fact that the first time trade became bad, and pro-
visions dear, the members rapidly increased. The people felt the
pinch, and it made them look out for the best means of making a little
go far; and finding that the payment of a shilling entrance money, and
threepence a week afterwards—which sum being paid on account of
their shares, was really money saved—would enable them to join the
Store; they saw that doing so was quite within their means, and
much to their advantage. Accordingly, many availed themselves of
the opportunity of buying their goods at the Store. The Store
thereby encouraged habits of providence, and saved the funds of the
parish. At the close of 1847, 110 members were on the books, and
the capital had increased to £286 15s. 3Jd., and the weekly receipts
for goods during the December quarter were £36. An increase of
£34 of capital, and £2 a week in receipts during twelve months, was
no great thing to boast of; but this was accomplished during a year
of bad trade and dear food, which might have been expected to ruin
the society; it was plain that the co-operative waggon was surely, if
slowly, tolling up the hill. The next minute of the Society’s history
is unexpected and cheering.
The year 1848 commenced with great ‘ distress ’ cases, and an acces-
sion of new members. Contributions were now no longer collected
from the members at their homes. There was one place now where
every member met, at least once a week, and that was at the Store,
and the cashier made the appointed collection from each when he
appeared at the desk. Neither revolutions abroad, nor excitement nor
distress at home, disturbed the progress of this wise and peaceful
experiment. The members increased to 140, the capital increased to
£397, and the weekly receipts for goods sold in the December
quarter rose to £80; being an increase of £44 a week over the previous
year in the amount of sales.
The lower room of the old warehouse was now too small for the
business, so the whole building, consisting of three stories and an attic,
was taken hy these enterprising co-operators, on lease for twenty-one
years.
More new members were added to the Society in 1849. The second
floor became the meeting room of the members, and also a sort of news-
room, for on August 20th, it was resolved—‘That Messrs. James
Nuttall, Henry Green, Abraham Greenwood, George Adcroft, James
Hill, and Robert Taylor, be a committee to open a stall for the sale of
books, periodicals, newspapers, etc.; the profits to be applied to the
furnishing the members’ room with newspapers and books.’ At the
close of 1849 the number of members had reached three hundred and

ninety. The capital now amounted to £1193 19s. Id., and the
weekly receipts for goods had risen to £179.
In the next year a very old enemy of social peace appeared in
Eochdale. The religious element began to contend for exclusiveness.
The rapid increase of the members had brought together numbers
holding evangelical views, and who had not been reared in a school
of practical toleration. These had no idea of allowing to their col-
leagues the freedom their colleagues allowed to them, and they pro-
posed to close the meeting room on Sundays, and forbid religious
controversy. The liberal and sturdy co-operators, whose good sense
and devotion had created the secular advantages of which the religious
accession had chosen to avail itself, were wholly averse to this
restriction. They valued mental freedom more than any personal
gain, and they could not help regarding with dismay the introduction
of this fatal source of discord, which had broken up so many Friendly
Societies, and often frustrated the fairest prospects of mutual im-
provement. The matter was brought before a general meeting, on
February 4th, 1850. We give the dates of the leading incidents we
record, for they are historic days in the career of our Store. On the
date here quoted, it was resolved, for the welfare of the Society
* That every member shall have full liberty to speak his sentiments
on all subjects when brought before the meetings at a proper time, and
in a proper manner; and all subjects shall be legitimate when properly
proposed.' The tautology of this memorable resolution .shows the
emphasis of alarm under which it was passed, and the endeavour to
secure by reiteration of terms, a liberty so essential to conscience and
to progress. The founders of the Society were justly apprehensive
that its principles would be overthrown by an indiscriminate influx of
members, who knew nothing of the toleration upon which all co-
operation must be founded, and they moved and carried: —‘ That no
propositions be taken for new members after next general meeting for
six months ensuing.’ From this time peace has prevailed on this
subject.
Very early in the history of co-operation—as far back as 1832—the
Co-operative Congress, held in London in that yeac, wisely agreed to
this resolution;— ‘ Whereas, the co-operative world contains persons
of all religious sects, and of all political parties, it is unanimously re-
solved, that Co-operators, as such , are not identified with any religious,
irreligious, or political tenets whatever; neither those of Mr. Owen,
nor of any other individual.’*
Sectarianism is at all times the bane of public unity. Without
toleration of all opinion, popular co-operation is impossible.
These theological storms over, the Society continued its success.
The members increased in 1850 to six hundred; the capital of the
Society, in cash and stock, rose to £2299 10s. 5d., and the cash
received during the December quarter amounted to £4397 175., or
£338 per week.

The Store nearly wrecked by the religious element.


In April, 1851, seven years after its commencement, the Store was
open, for the first time, all day. Mr. William Cooper was appointed
superintendent; John Rudman and James Standring shopmen.
This year the members of the Store were six hundred and thirty;
its capital .£2785 ; its weekly sales £3OB. Somewhat less than in
1850.
The next year, 1852, the increase of members’ capital and receipts
was marked, and they have gone on since increasing at a rate beyond
all expectation. To what extent we shall show in Tables of Results

CHAPTER V.
ENEMIES WITHIN AND ENEMIES WITHOUT, AND HOW THEY ALL WERE
CONQUERED.
The moral miracle performed by our co-operatives of Rochdale is,
that they have had the good sense to differ without disagreeing; to
dissent from each other without separating; to hate at times, and yet
always hold together. In most working class, and, indeed, in most
public societies of all classes, a number of curious persons are found,
who appear born under a disagreeable star; who breathe hostility,
distrust, and dissension; whose tones are always harsh : it is no fault
of theirs, they never mean it, but they cannot help it; their organs of
speech are cracked, and no melodious sound can come out of them;
their native note is a moral squeak; they are never cordial, and never
satisfied ; the restless convolutions of their skin denote ‘ a difference
of opiniontheir very lips hang in the form of a ‘ carpthe muscles
of their face are ‘ drawn up ’ in the shape of an amendment, and their
wrinkled brows frown with an ‘ entirely new principle of action they
are a species of social porcupines, whose quills eternally stick out;
whose vision is inverted; who see everything upside down; who place
every subject in water to inspect it, where the straightest rod appears
hopelessly bent; who know that every word has two meanings, and
who take always the one you do not intend; who know that no state-
ment can include everything, and who always fix upon whatever you
omit, and ignore whatever you assert; who join a society ostensibly to
co-operate with it, but really to do nothing but criticise it, without
attempting patiently to improve that of which they complain; who,
instead of seeking strength to use it in mutual defence, look for weak-
ness to expose it to the common enemy; who make every associate
sensible of perpetual dissatisfaction, until membership with them
becomes a penal infliction, and you feel that you are sure of more
peace and more respect among your opponents than among your friends;
who predict to everybody that the thing must fail, until they make it
impossible that it can succeed, and then take credit for their treacher-

way, and helping the lame along, and giving the weak a lift, and
imparting courage to the timid, and confidence to the despairing, spend
their time in sticking pins into the tender, treading on the toes of the
gouty, pushing the lame down stairs, leaving those in the dark behind,
telling the fearful that they may well he afraid, and assuring the
despairing that it is ‘ all up.’ A sprinkling of these ‘ damned good
natured friends ’ belong to most societies; they are few in number,
but indestructible; they are the highwaymen of progress, who alarm
every traveller, and make you stand and deliver your hopes; they
are the lagoes and Turpins of democracy, and only wise men and
strong men can evade them or defy them. The Rochdale co-operators
understand them very well—they met them—bore with them—
worked with them—worked in spite of them—looked upon them as
the accidents of progress, gave them a pleasant word and a merry
smile, and passed on before them ; they answered them not by word
hut by act, as Diogenes refuted Zeno. When Zeno said there was
no motion, Diogenes answered him by moving. When adverse critics,
with Briarian hands, pointed to failure, the Rochdale co-operators
quietly replied by succeeding*
Whoever joins a popular society, ought to be made aware of this
curious species of colleagues whom we have described. You can get
on with them very well if they do not take you by surprise. Indeed,
they are useful in their way; they are the dead weights with which
the social architect tries the strength of his new building. We men-
tion them because they existed in Rochdale, and that fact serves to
show that our co-operators enjoyed no favour from nature or accident.
They were tried like other men, and had to combat the ordinary
human difliculties. Take two examples.
Of course the members’ meetings are little parliaments of working
men—not very little parliaments now, for they include thrice the
number of members composing the House of Commons. All the
Inutual criticisms in which Englishmen proverbially indulge, and the
grumblings said to be our national characteristic, and the petty
jealousies of democracies, are reproduced on these occasions, though
not upon the fatal scale so common among the working class. Here,
in the parliament of our Store, the leader of the opposition sometimes
shows no mercy to the leader in power; and Rochdale Gladstones
and Disraelies, very freely criticise the quarterly budget of the Sir
George Cornewall Lewis of the day. At one time there was our friend
Ben, a member of the Store so known, who was never satisfied with
anything—and yet he never complained of anything. He looked his

disapproval, but never spoke it. He was suspicious of everybody in
a degree, it would seem, too great for utterance. He went about
everywhere, he inspected everything, and doubted everything. He
shook his dissent, not from his tongue, but his head. It was at one
time thought that the management must sink under his portentous
disapprobation. With more wisdom than usually falls to critics, he
refrained from speaking until he knew what he had to say. After
two years of this weighty travail the clouds dispersed, and Ben found
speech and confidence together. He found that his profits had in-
creased notwithstanding his distrust, and he could no longer find in
his heart to frown upon the Store which was making him rich.
At last he went up to the cashier to draw his profits, and he came
down, like Moses from the mount, with his face shining.
Another guardian of the democratic weal fulminated heroically.
The very opposite of Ben, he almost astounded the Store by Ins
ceaseless and stentorian speeches. The Times newspaper would not
contain a report of his quarterly orations. He could not prove that
anything was wrong, but he could not believe that all was right. He
was invited to attend the meeting of the Board; indeed, if we have
studied the chronicles of the Store correctly, he was appointed a
member of the Board, that he might not only see the right thing done,
but do it; but he was too indignant to do his duty, and he was so
committed to dissatisfaction that above all things he was afraid of
being undeceived; and, during his whole period of office, he sat with his
back to the Board, and in that somewhat unfriendly and inconvenient
attitude he delivered his respective opinions. Whether, like the hare,
he had ears behind has not been certified; but, unless he had eyes
behind, he never could have seen what took place. A more perfect
member of an opposition has rarely appeared. He was made by
nature to conduct an antagonism. At length he was bribed into con-
tent —bribed by the only legitimate bribery—the bribery of success.
When the dividends came in behind him, he turned round to look at
them, and he pocketed his ‘brass’ and his wrath together; and, though
he has never been brought to confess that things are going right, he
has long ceased to say that they are going wrong.
The Store very early began to exercise educational functions.
Besides supplying the members with provisions, the Store became a
meeting place, where almost every member met each other every
evening after working hours. Here there was harmony because there
was equality. Every member was equal in right, and was allowed to
express his opinions on whatever topic he took an interest in.
Religion and politics, the terrors of Mechanics’ Institutions, were
here common subjects of discussion, and harmless because they were
open. In other respects the co-operators acquired business confidence
as well as business habits. The Board was open to everybody, and, in
fact, everybody went everywhere. Distrust dies out where nothing
is concealed. Confidence and honest pride sprung up, for every member
was a master—he was at once purchaser and proprietor. But all did

not go smoothly on. Besides the natural obstacles which exist,
ignorance and inexperience created others.
Poverty is a greater impediment to social success than even pre-
judice. With a small capital you cannot buy good articles nor cheap
ones. What is bought at a small Store will probably he worse and
dearer than the same articles elsewhere. This discourages the poor.
With them every penny must tell, and every penny extra they pay
for goods seems to them a tax, and they will not often incur it. It
is of no use that you show them that it and more will come hack again
as profit at the end of the quarter. They do not believe in the end of
the quartet —they distrust the promise of profits. The loss of the
penny to-day is near—the gain of sixpence three months hence is
remote. Thus you have to educate the very poor before you can
serve them. The humbler your means the greater your difficulties—
you have to teach as well as to save the very poor. One would think
that a customer ought to be content when he is his own shopkeeper;
on the contrary, he is not satisfied with the price he charges himself.
Intelligent contentment is the slowest plant that grows upon the soil
of ignorance.
Some of the male members, and no wonder that many of the
women also, thought meanly of the Store. They had been accustomed
to fine shops, and the Toad Lane warehouse was repulsive to them;
hut after a time the women became conscious of the pride of pay-
ing ready money for their goods, and of feeling that the store was
their own, and they began to take equal interest with their husbands.
As usually happens in these cases, the members who rendered no sup-
port to the new undertaking when it most wanted support, made up
by rendering more complaints than anybody else, thus rendering no
help themselves and discouraging those who did. It has been a
triumph of penetration and good sense to inspire these contributors
with a habit of supporting that, which, in its turn, supports them so
well. There are times still when a cheaper article has its attraction
for the store purchaser, when he forgets the supreme advantage of
knowing that his food is good, or his garment as stout as it can be
made. He will sometimes forget the moral satisfaction derived f*om
knowing that the article he can buy from the Store has, as far as the
store can influence it, been produced by some workman, who, in his
turn, was paid at some living rate for his labour. Now and then, the
higgler will appear at the little co-operative stores around, and the
store dealers will believe them, and prefer their goods to the supplies
to be had from the store, because they are some fraction cheaper;
without their being able to know what adulteration, or hard bar-
gaining elsewhere, has been practised to effect the reduction.
Any person passing through the manufacturing districts of Lan-
cashire will be struck with the great number of small provision shops;
many of them dealing in drapery goods as well as food. From these
shops the operatives, to a great extent, spread their tables and cover
their backs. Unfortunately, with them the credit system is the rule,
ROCHDALE EQUITABLE PIONEERS.
The difficulty of serving the poor.


and ready money the exception. The majority of the people trading
at these shops have what is called a ‘ Strap Book,’ which of course is
always taken when anything is fetched, and balanced as often as the
operatives receive their wages, which is generally weekly, but in
many places fortnightly. A balance is generally left due to the shop-
keeper, thus the great number of operatives are always less or more
in debt. When trade becomes slack, he goes deeper and deeper, until
he is irretrievably involved. When his work fails altogether, he is
obliged to remove to another district, and of course to trade with
another shop, unless at great inconvenience he sends all the distance
to the old shop.
It sometimes happens that an honest weaver will prefer all this
trouble to forsaking a house that has trusted him. One instance has
been mentioned to the present writer, in which a family that had re-
moved from a village on one side of the town to one on the opposite
side, continued for years to send a distance of two miles and a half to
the old shop for their provisions, although in doing so they had to
pass through the town of Kochdale, where they could have obtained
the same things cheaper. This is in every way a grateful and
honourable fact, and the history of the working class includes crowds
of them.
We are hound to relate that the capital of the Store would have
increased somewhat more rapidly, had it not at that time been ab-
sorbed by the land company of Feargus O’Connor. Many members
of the Store were also shareholders in that concern, and as that
company was considered by them to he more feasible, and calculated
sooner to place its members in a state of permanent independence,
much of the zeal and enthusiasm necessary to the prospect of a new
society were lost to the co-operative cause.
The practise of keeping up a national debt in this country, on the
interest of which so many are enabled to live at the expense of
industrious taxpayers, and the often immoral speculations of the
Stock Exchange, have produced an absurd and injurious reaction on
the part of many honest people. Many co-operative experiments
have failed through want of capital, because the members thought it
immoral to take interest, and yet they had not sufficient zeal to lend
their money without interest. Others have had a moral objection to
paying interest, and as money was not to be had without, of course
these virtuous people did nothing—they were too moral to be useful.
All this showed frightful ignorance of political economy. If nobody
practised thrift and self-denial in order to create capital, society must
remain in perpetual barbarism; and if capital is refused interest as
compensation for its risk, it would never he available for the use of
others. It would be simply hoarded in uselessness, instead of being
the great instrument of civilisation and national power. The class of
reformers who made these mistakes were first reclaimed to intelligent
appreciation of industrial science by Mr. Stuart Mill’s ‘ Principles of
Political Economy, with some of their applications to Social Philosophy
history of the
Feargus O’Connor’s Land Scheme retards the Store.


Most of these ‘applications’ were new to them, and though made with
the just austerity of science, they manifested so deep a consideration
for the progress of "the people, and a human element so fresh and
sincere, that prejudice was first dispelled by sympathy, and error
afterwards by argument.
The principle of co-operation—so moralising to the individual as a
discipline, and so advantageous to the state in its results—with what
difficulty has it made its way in the world! Regarded by the states-
man as some terrible form of political combination, and by the rich as
a scheme of spoliation; denounced in parliament, written against by
political economists, preached against by the clergy; the co-operative
idea, as opposed to the competitive, has had to struggle, and has yet to
struggle its way into industry and commerce. Statesmen might spare
themselves the gratuitous anxiety they have often manifested for the
suppression of new opinion. Experience ought to have shown them
that wherever one man endeavours to set up a new idea, ten men at
once rise up to put it down; not always because they think it bad,
but because, whether good or bad, they do not want the existing
order of things altered. They will hate truth itself, even if they
know it to be truth, if truth gives them trouble. The statesman
ought to have higher taste, even if he has not higher employment,
than to join the vulgar and officious crowd in hampering or hunting
honest innovation. There is, of course, a prejudice felt at first on
the part of shopkeepers against co-operative societies. That sort of
feeling exists which we find among mechanics against the intro-
duction of machinery, which, for want of better arrangements, is sure
to injure them first, however it may benefit the general public after-
wards. But, owing to the good sense of the co-operators, and not
less to the good sense of the shopkeepers of Rochdale, no unfriendli-
ness worth mentioning has ever existed between them. The co-
operators were humbly bent on improving their own condition, and
at first their success in that way was so trivial as not to be worth the
trouble of jealousy. For the first three or four years after the com-
mencement of the Store, its operations produced no appreciable effect
upon the retail trade of the town. The receipts of the Store in 1847,
four years after its commencement, were only £36 a week; about the
receipt of a single average shop, and five or ten times less than the
receipts of some shops. But of late years, no doubt, the shopkeepers,
especially smaller ones, have felt its effects. In some instances shops
may have been closed in consequence. The members of the Store
extend out into the suburbs, a distance of one or two miles from the
town. It has happened in the case of at least one suburban shop-
keeper, that half the people for a mile round him had become Store
purchasers. This, of course, would be likely to affect his business.
The good feeling prevailing among the tradesmen of the town has
been owing somewhat to a display of unexpected good sense and
moderation on the part of the co-operators, who have kept themselves
free from the greed of mere trade and the vices of rivalry. If the

prices of grocery in the town rose, the Store raised its charges to the
same level. It never would, even in appearance, nor even in self-
defence, use its machinery to undersell others; and when tradesmen
lowered, as instances often occurred, their prices in order to undersell
the Store, and show to the town that they could sell cheaper than any
society of weavers, and when they made a boast of doing so, and invi-
ted the customers of the Store to deal with them in preference, or
taunted the dealers at the Store with the higher prices they had to
pay, the Store never at any time, neither in its days of weakness nor
of strength, would reduce any of its prices. It passed by, would not
recognise, would in no way imitate this ruinous and vexatious, hut
perfectly legitimate, resource of competition. The Store conducted an
honest trade—it charged an honest average price—it sought no
rivalry, nor would it he drawn into any, although the means of
winning were quite as much in its hands as in the hands of its oppo-
nents. The prudent maxims of the members were, ‘To be safe we
must sell at a profit.’ ‘To he honest we must sell at a profit.’ ‘lf
we sell sugar without profit, we must take advantage covertly in the
sale of some other articles to cover that loss.’ ‘We will not act
covertly ; we will not trade without profit whatever others may do;
we will not profess to sell cheaper than others; we profess to sell
honestly’—and this policy has conquered.
Some manufacturers were as much opposed to the co-operators’ Store
as the shopkeepers—not knowing exactly what to make of it. Some
were influenced by reports made to them by prejudiced persons—
some had vague notions of their men acquiring a troublesome inde-
pendence. But this apprehension was of short duration, and was set at
rest by the good sense of others. One employer was advised to dis-
charge some of his men for dealing at the Store, who serviceably
answered ‘He did not see why he should. So long as his men did
their duty, it was no business of his to dictate where they should deal.
They had as much right as he had to spend their money in that mar-
ket where they thought it would go farthest, and if they learned
thrift he did not see what harm it would do them, and if they could
save money they had a right to do so. Indeed, he thought it was
their turn.’
The co-operators have long enjoyed the good opinion of the
majority of the manufacturers, and the higher classes of the town.
The members of the Store are so numerous, that the masters come in
contact with them at almost every turn. The co-operators work for
nearly every employer in the town, and many hold the most trusty
and responsible situations. The working class in general hold the
co-operative society in high esteem, and what is more natural, since
it aims at bettering their condition ? Indeed, the society exercises
considerable influence in the town. As its members are spread over
every part, every local or public movement is known to one or the
other, and is communicated rapidly as they meet with their fellow
members at the Store. Facts circulate—opinion is elicited —criticism

follows—a general conviction upon particular points springs up—and
thus many learn what is the right view to support, and support it
with more confidence from the knowledge that numbers, upon whom
they can rely, share it.
The slowness of the Rochdale movement for two or three years
may be attributed to the want of confidence in any scheme originating
among the working classes for the amelioration of their condition.
The loss, trouble, and anxiety entailed upon the leading men of the
previous co-operative societies in Rochdale, were still within the
recollection of many. These reminiscences would naturally intimidate
the cautious. There were others who were not aware that the
former societies had been wrecked by the credit system. The ‘ Equitable
Pioneers ’ had most studiously avoided that shoal. In fact, so many
co-operative experiments had been stranded by credit, that an almost
universal opinion was prevalent, not only in Rochdale, but through-
out the country and in Parliament, that co-operation was an exploded
fallacy, and the poor co-operators, whose enterprise we report, were
looked upon as dangerous emissaries of some revolutionary plot, and
at the same time as fanatics deluded beyond all hope of enlightenment,
who were bent on ruining themselves, and too ignorant to com-
prehend their folly or their danger. It was not until the small but
unfailing stream of profits began to meander into all out of the way
cottages and yards—it was not until the town had been repeatedly
astonished by the discovery of weavers with money in their pockets,
who had never before been known to be out of debt, that the working
class began to perceive that the ‘ exploded fallacy ’ was a paying
fallacy; and then crowds of people who had all their life been
saying and proving that nothing of the kind could happen, now
declared that they had never denied it, and that everybody knew
co-operation would succeed, and that anybody could do what the
Store did.
CHAPTER VI
THE GREAT FLOUR MILL PANIC.
Towards the close of 1850, a new society takes its place in our
narrative—namely, the ‘ Rochdale District Corn Mill Society.’ A
similar one had long flourished in Leeds, a history of which would be
a very instructive addition to co-operative literature.* The Rochdale
imitation commenced its active operations about the close of 1850.
* An account appeared in the local newspapers of 1849, of the success of the Leeds
and Halifax Com Mill Societies, which had effected a general reduction in the price of flour
in those towns, thus serving the whole public, besides supplying to their own members pure
flour cheaper than the public price, with added profits. These facts, circulated by the
newspapers, led Mr. Smithies, Mr. Greenwood, and Mr. Charles Howarth to initiate the
discussion of a corn mill movement in Rochdale, at the Equitable Pioneers’ meetings.
ROCHDALE EQUITABLE PIONEERS.
The ‘ exploded fallacy * becomes a * paying * fallacy.


This Corn Mill Society, meeting at the Elephant and Castle, Man-
chester Road, received encouragement from the Store. It, however,
soon appeared that the mill had too little money to enable it to carry
on the corn business; it had to get its grain from such persons as
would supply it on credit. The directors being unacquainted with the
business, had, of course, to entrust it to other hands than their own,
very much to its disadvantage. Our ‘ Equitable Pioneers ’ invested,
in the shape of shares in the corn mill, from £4OO to £6OO.
In 1851 they began to lend to the Corn Mill Society, on account of
goods to come in. Unfortunately, the goods sent in—namely, the
flour, was of an inferior quality. This was owing to two causes.
First, the corn mill, being short of capital, was obliged to buy where
it could get credit, instead of where it could get the best corn; being
in the power of him who gave credit, they were often compelled to
accept an inferior article at a high price. Second, there was a want
of skill in the head miller—in the grinding department. The
‘ Equitable Pioneer Society ’ decided to sell no flour but the ‘ Rochdale
Corn Mill Society’s,’ and that being inferior, of course the sale fell
oft'.* This is another of those little crevices in the walls of a popular
experiment, through which the selfishness of human nature peeps
out. Of course a man who pays a dearer rate than his neighbour for
any article, taxes himself to that amount; but, in a public movement,
this is one of those liabilities which every man who would advance it
must be prepared to encounter. When the support of the purchasers
at the Store began to drop off by this refusal to take the flour, it
brought on a crisis in the co-operative society. By the end of the
third quarter of 1851, the corn mill had lost £450.f This produced
a panic in the Store, which was considered, by its investments, to be
implicated in the fall of the corn mill. It was soon rumoured that
the Store would fail, and some of the members proposed that the corn
mill business be abandoned. Others suggested that each member of
the Store should subscribe a pound to cover the loss, and clear out of
it. But as the corn mill held its meetings at the Pioneers’ Store, and its
leading members belonged to the Store, Mr. Smithies considered that
their honour was compromised if they were defeated; and insisted,
with much energy, that the name of ‘ Pioneers ’ must be given up,
unless they went on altogether. Had the mill been brought to the
hammer at this time, there would not have been realised ten shillings
in the pound. This was the point to try their faith in co-operation.
The members did not fail. Some brought all the money they could
collect together to enable the difficulties to be conquered; a few, as
usual in these cases, fell back. In the first place, amid those who
distinguished themselves to avert the disaster of failure, all agree to
* The deficiency of capital is always aggravated by miscalculation. After contracting
for the machinery of £750, the millwright sent in a bill of extras of £l4o—a dressing
machine at £44 was overlooked; the result was that when the mill was ready no money
existed with which to purchase grain.

name Abraham Greenwood, whose long and protracted devotion to
this work cost him his health, and nearly his life. How much has
depended, in the fate of the Store, on the honesty of its officers, may
be seen from the disasters of the corn mill, arising from defects of
character in some of its servants. One miller systematically went to
Manchester, instead of to Wakefield, to buy his flour. By acting in
concert with some seller, he got a commission in Manchester, and the
Store suffered for it. The first great loss of the mill was probably
occasioned in this way. The next miller had a weakness for ‘ toddy,’
and his successor was liable to faint perceptions of truth ; so between
the man who would not know what he was doing, and the man who
did not know what he was doing, and the man who did not know
what he was saying, the affairs of the corn mill got somewhat
confused.
Another very usual error among the working class muddled every
thing further. Thinking it economical to accept volunteer book-
keepers, they had their books kept by those who offered—who
officiated in turns —and the books were duly bungled for nothing.
The confusion was cheap but inextricable, and the perplexity of
everything grew worse confounded. The directors acted with good
sense and vigour as soon as they comprehended their position. The
defective manager for the time being was dismissed, Mr. A. Green-
wood, the president of the society, acting in his place. A paid book-
keeper was appointed—debts were commenced liquidation by small
instalments, when an unexpected disaster overtook them. One
morning news was brought to town that the bailiffs were in possession,
to the dismay of the struggling co-operators, and secret satisfaction of
the prophets of failure, who could not help felicitating themselves on
so portentous a sign. The landlord, of whom the Corn Mill was
rented, had neglected to pay the ground landlord his rent, and for
three years’ ground rent, amounting to £IOO, he had put in a distraint
upon the property of the co-operators, who were not morally re-
sponsible. This enemy was in due time routed—perseverance
triumphed, and successive dividends, from fourpence to one shilling in
the pound, cleared off the loss of £450, and the day of substantial
profits at length dawned.
When the Store was first opened, one shopkeeper boasted that he
could come with a wheelbarrow and wheel the whole stock away,
which was quite true. He had the command of ten times more
capital. He threatened that he would sell cheaper, and break up the
Store. It was quite true that he could sell cheaper, but the weavers
held together, and he did not break up the Store. There were many
unfriendly traders of this way of thinking. It often happens that
men who do not exactly mean ill towards you, become your enemies
artificially. They begin by predicting that you will fail, and without
exactly wishing you should fail, are sorry when you do not. As an
abstract matter, they would perhaps be glad of your success; but
having committed themselves to a prediction, they are disgusted when

you falsify it, and they will sometimes help to bring about your ruin
for no other reason than that of fulfilling their own prediction. In
1849, when the savings’ bank in Rochdale so disgracefully broke,
and many thousands of pounds of the hard earnings of the poor were
swept away,* the poor and ruined people turned to the Store for
protection. Since 1849 there has been no sayings’ bank in Rochdale.
Many of the weavers who, up to this time, had preferred investing
their money in the hank, had now to look out for another place in
which to deposit their savings. They felt that they had misplaced
their confidence in the savings’ hank, which was an institution without
an adequate responsible security, or in which they had no controlling
influence over the application of the money. As the Store offered
both these advantages, and a higher rate of interest, many of their
bank found their way to the Store, and future savings
also.
They had more confidence in the ‘ Equitable Pioneers ’ than in the
pseudo government hank. The failure of the savings’ hank led to an
accession of members and capital to the Store. This growth of con-
fidence brought great discredit on the prophets to whom we have been
referring. No sooner, however, did the Corn Mill panic get rumoured
about, than they recurred with sinister emphasis to their old pre-
dictions, and their rumours brought about a run upon the Store. The
humble directors said nothing, but quietly placed their cashier behind
the counter with orders to pay every demand. One man, who had
twenty-four pounds in the Store, the whole of which he had made
from the profits, began with a demand for sixteen pounds. He had
some sort of sympathy for his benefactors, and thought he would
leave a little in their hands.
‘ Are you about to commence some sort of business ? ’ asked the
cashier.
‘No,’ said the man, ‘but I want my money.’
‘ Well, you are aware that notice is required ? ’
‘ Oh, yes, and lam come to give notice.’ He ‘ would have his
money.’
‘ Well,’ said the cashier, ‘we avail ourselves of the notice when we
are likely to be short; but we can dispense with notice now. You’d
better “ tak brass now.” ’
And they made the man ‘ tak brass ’ then, and much to his astonish-
ment, he was obliged to carry his money away in his pocket, and he
went away, half suspecting he had been playing the fool.
Eighteen months after, this man brought his money back: he had
kept it in some stocking foot all that time (that celebrated ‘ patent
safe ’of the poor), losing the interest. He himself then told the
cashier the story of his taking it out; in consequence of being assured
* Out of £100,403 deposits, an officer had appropriated to his own use £71,717. The amount
still due to the depositors (1857) is £38,287. Sir A. Ramsay has lately presented a petition
to the House of Commons on the subject,

that the Store would break. He now tells the story to his comrades,
far and near, and nobody has more confidence in the Store than he.
Next a woman appeared : she would have her money out then. It
was at once offered to her—then she would not have it. She de-
manded her money because she had been told she could not get it;
and when she found that she could have it, she did not want it. More
sensible and quickwitted than the dullard who carried his sixteen
pounds home to his stocking foot, when she found there was no risk,
she left her money. Another instance occurred, in which a woman
generously refused to draw her money out whether it was in danger or
not. A shopkeeper said to her:— ‘ You say you have £4O in the Store.;
well, it will be sure to break, and you had better draw it out.’ The
woman answered:— ‘ Well, if it does break, it will break with its own ;
it has all been saved out of my profits-r-all I have it has given me.’
Prom the depositors the panic extended to traders; but the panic
among them did not last long. At that time, corn was bought for
the mill one week, and paid for the next. The payments, at this
time, were made at Wakefield, one week under the other. One week
the buyer-in missed the paying. The old gentleman who was, in this
case, the creditor, was told by millers about him that the Store had
broken—he might depend upon it. He took an express train to
Rochdale and a cab from the railway station, rushed down to the
Store, and demanded his money. He was quietly asked forhis invoice,
and his money was at once paid him; and he was told if he knew any
others wanting money on account of goods supplied to the Corn Mill,
to be kind enough to send them in. The old gentleman went away
very much astonished; he felt that he should never have another
order; and he afterwards stated to the superintendent at the railway
station, he had ever since regretted the unfortunate journey he was
induced to make.
About this time, the bank in Rochdale, with whom our ‘ Equit-
able Pioneers’ did business, did them a frank piece of service, which
they have always remembered with appreciation. Some tradesmen
being at the counter of the bank, a person remarked that he thought
the Store was running down, evidently fishing from the bankers some
confirmation of his suspicions. The answer given by one of the firm
was, that he did not see why it should, as the Board had left £2OOO in
their hands for a long time, which they had never touched. This obser-
vation established confidence in influential quarters; and as the
depositors who applied for their money at the Store invariably car-
ried it back with them in their pockets, it soon restored confidence
among their own order. The humble directors of the Store, like all
other honest men, had more pride and pleasure in paying money than
in receiving it, and their firm and judicious conduct re-established the
credit of the ‘Equitable Pioneers.’
Here are from one to two thousand weavers, who have done what
Sir John Dean Paul failed to do—kept an honest banking house. In
point of morality, how infinitely superior are these Rochdale Co-

operators to that Lord of the Treasury who finally poisoned himself
on Hampstead Heath ! Surely these men are as fit for the franchise
as Paul and Sadleir, as Hugh Innes Cameron and Humphrey Brown,
What standard of electional fitness does the Government take,
who gives the franchise to fraudulent bankers and knavish lords of
the treasury, and withholds it from honest weavers ?
The September quarter of 1852 showed a clear balance of gain for
that quarter of £lOO upon the Corn Mill. The energy of Mr.
Greenwood and his colleagues had turned upwards the fortunes of the
Corn Mill.
In the origin of their flour operations a curious circumstance
occurred. Determined to supply all things genuine, they supplied
the flour so. It might he inferior, as we have related it was, but it
was pure; but being pure, it was browner than the usual flour in the
market. It was rejected for its difference of colour. A friend of the
present writer, disgusted with the spurious coffee of London, made
arrangements to supply the common people with a genuine cup. To
this end he opened a house in Lambeth, and ground fiji the real
berries pure. But no one would drink his coffee, and he h&d to shut
up his house. Accustomed to adulterated coffee, until their taste was
formed upon depraved compounds, the people rejected the pure
beverage. So it happened to our Corn Mill. The unadulterated
flour would not sell. The customers of the Store knew neither the
colour nor taste of pure flour. Then there was a cry against the co-
operators. It was said they could not compete with the usual millers;
and if they adulterated, the only way open of rendering their flour
popular, there would he another cry out against them for adultera-
ting it, and being as had as other traders. For a short time they made
their flour white in the usual way, but it was so much against their
principles to do so, that they discussed the folly of the preference
with their purchasers at the Store, and the pure flour, of whatever
colour, was taken into favour, and from that day to this it has
been sold genuine.
CHAPTER VII.
SUCCESSIVE STEPS OF SUCCESS. THE ROCHDALE STORE ON A
SATURDAY NIGHT.
The Equitable Pioneers’ Society is divided into seven departments:—
Grocery, Drapery, Butchering, Shoemaking, Clogging, Tailoring,
Wholesale.
A separate account is kept of each business, and a general account is
given each quarter, showing the position of the whole.
The grocery business was commenced, as we have related, in
December, 1844, with only four articles to sell. It now includes what-
ever a grocer’s shop should include.
HISTORY OF THE
Objections to genuine food.


The drapery business was started in 1847, with an humble array of
attractions. In 1834 it was erected into a separate department.
A year earlier, 1846, the Store began to sell butchers’ meat,
buying eighty or one hundred pounds of a tradesman in the town.
After awhile, the sales were discontinued until 1850, when the Society
had a warehouse of its own. Mr. John Moorhouse, who has now two
assistants, buys and kills for the Society three oxen, eight sheep,
sundry porkers and calves, which are on the average converted into
£l3O of cash per week.
Shoemaking commenced in 1852. Three men and an apprentice
make, and a stock is kept on sale.
Clogging and tailoring commenced also in this year.
The wholesale department commenced in 1855, and marks an
important development of the Pioneers’ proceedings. This depart-
ment has been created for supplying any member requiring large
quantities, and with a view to supply the co-operative stores of Lan-
cashire and Yorkshire, whose small capitals do not enable them to buy
in the best markets, nor command the services of what is otherwise
indispensable to every Store—a good buyer, who knows the markets
and his business, who knows what, how, and where to buy. The
wholesale department guarantees purity, quality, fair prices, standard
weight and measure, but all on the never failing principle—cash
payment.
After registering the Society under the 13 and 14 Viet., chap. 115,*
the Society turned its attention to a wholesale department, an opera-
tion which would have been impossible but for the legal protection of
this Act, an Act which has called forth more expressions of gratitude to
Parliament than any Act I have ever heard commented upon by
working men. The Pioneers’ laws say (we quote three of their
rules): —
14. —The wholesale department shall be for the purpose of supply-
ing those members who desire to have their goods in large quantities.
16. —The said department shall be charged with interest, after the
rate of five per cent, per annum, for such capital as may be advanced
to it by the Board of Directors.
17. —The profits arising from this department, after paying for the
cost of management and other expenses, including the interest afore-
said, shall be divided quarterly into three parts, one of which shall be
reserved to meet any loss that may arise in the course of trade until
it shall equal the fixed stock required, and the remaining two thirds
shall be divided amongst the members, in proportion to the amount of
their purchases in the said department.
In 1854, a Conference was held in Leeds, to consider how the
co-operative societies of Lancashire and -Yorkshire could unite their

purchases of produce and manufactures among themselves. Mr. Lloyd
Jones lent his valuable counsel on this occasion, and at Rochdale, -where
a second Conference with this object was held in August, 1855. Of course
the cardinal question was, who should find capital to carry out the idea
of a wholesale department. Some stores were willing to contribute a
proportional share, others had hardly cash to carry on their own
operations; other stores, with a prudence very old in the world, pro-
posed to see how the plan was going to succeed before joining in it.
This is a cautiousness commendable in some cases, hut were all to act
upon it no advance would ever he made. The Equitable Pioneers
accepted the initiative with their usual pluck. As many of the stores
had the notion in their heads that all the Rochdale Pioneers took up
succeeded, several stores joined, and put in a little money; hut the
principal capital was supplied by our enterprising friends, the
Rochdale Equitables. As the law we have quoted shows, they stipu-
lated for five per cent, on their advances. Differences, though not
dissensions, arose. The Equitable Pioneers’ Society felt dissatisfaction
that stores, not contributing a fair share of capital to work the whole-
sale trade, should yet receive an equal dividend of profits in propor-
tion to their trade with the department As the Equitable Pioneers
found nearly all the capital, they were by many thought entitled to
nearly all the profit. On the other hand, it was urged that the five
per cent, on their capital was all they had a right to, and they had no
claim to the profits made by the trade of other stores. The Store of
the Pioneers dealt with the wholesale department, and had, in common
with other stores, their profits upon the amount of their own trade. It
was true that many stores only bought articles that yielded little profit,
while the Rochdale Store bought so generally and largely as to create
the chief profits itself, besides risking its capital, which seemed at first
to be in danger. Eor in the March quarter of 1356, X 495 10s. 4d.
were lost through purchasing sugars, syrups, treacle, soaps, etc., when
prices were high, which prices came down before the goods could be
sold. A committee of inquiry at a later date reported that several
stores had increased their purchases from the wholesale department of
goofls, which yielded even more profit than the purchases of the
Pioneers’ Store. Mr. William Cooper, the Secretary, defended the
proceedings and position of the department, and it was ultimately
agreed that the District Stores had dealt fairly by the wholesale
department on the whole, although they had not supported it by capital
to the extent the promoters could have wished. Still many remained
dissatisfied, although they were unable to show what was wrong, and
at an adjourned quarterly meeting, so late as October, 1856, it was
‘ Resolved, that the wholesale stock be dispensed with.’ Owing to the
energy of Mr. Samuel Stott and others, this resolution never took
effect. The department being founded by an enrolled rule, it could
not be dispensed with without an alteration of the rules, and before an
alteration in the rules can take place the three-fourths of the whole
members specially convened must consent to it. The opponents ofthe

department despaired of getting this wide ratification of their partial dis-
satisfaction, and the department continued. The loss of £495 10s. 4d.
has, by the end of the March quarter of 1857, in one year’s operation,
been reduced to £l4l 14s. Id. In half a year more, the loss
will be cancelled, and profits beyond the interest on capital accrue.
The stores, to their credit, continue to trade with the department,
just as though they were receiving a dividend in addition to the interest
on the capital, which they will shortly do ; were they to receive no
dividend, it would be to their advantage to trade with the depart-
ment. The most important officer of a store is the purchaser. He
must be acquainted with his business and the markets. No honesty,
if he has not tact and knowledge, will prevent him from damaging the
prosperity of a store by bad purchases. Small stores cannot always
find such a man, nor support him when they do. But a wholesale
department, by keeping a few such, can serve all stores, can enable
the smallest to command genuine articles equally with the greatest,
and to command them even cheaper, as well as better, as large, united,
wholesale purchases can he made more advantageously, of course,
than small onps. It is clear, however, that this admirable and well-
devised department must have fallen but for the wise provision of the
Act of Parliament, upon which Mr. Stott and his colleagues fell back.
This useful law gives stability to a society, it prevents short-sighted
sections from destroying general purposes, and enables the errors of a
few to be revised and rectified by the decision of a veritable majority
of all concerned.
The members of the Store attracted from a distance, make their
purchases—some once a fortnight, and have their goods sent home;
others unite together and employ a carter to deliver them. The
desire to obviate this inconvenience, and the difficulty of serving the
great increase of members at Toad Lane (the Central Store), Branch
Stores have been lately opened. A members’ meeting can no longer be
held at the Store Rooms. 1,600 members make a public meeting, and the
business meetings of the Society are held in the public hall of the town.
In 1856, the first Branch was opened in the Oldham Road, about a mile
from the centre of Rochdale. In 1857, the Castleton Branch, and
another in the Whitworth Road, were established, and a fourth
Branch at Pinfold.
An idea of the appearance of a Branch Store may be gathered from
the next page. On each side the door a narrow upright sign, the
height of the entrance, gives the following information

HISTORY OF THE
External appearance of the front of a Branch Store.


The ‘owd weyvurs’ shop,’ or rather the entire building, was (in 1849),
as we have related, taken on lease by the Store, in a state sadly out of
repair. One room is now handsomely fitted up as a news-room.
Another is neatly fitted up as a library.* Every part has undergone
neat refitting and modest decoration, and now wears the air of a
thoroughly respectable place of business.
The corn mill was, of course, rented, and stood at Small Bridge,
some distance from the town—one mile and a half. The society have
since built in the town an entirely new mill for themselves. The engine
and the machinery are of the most substantial and improved kind.
It is now spoken of as ‘ the Society’s New Mill in Weir Street, near
the Commissioners’ Booms.’ The capital invested in the corn mill is
£8,450, of which £3,731 15s. 2d. is subscribed by the Equitable
Pioneers’ Society. The corn mill employs eleven men.
The Almanack of 1855 announced the formation of a ‘ Manufacturing
Society,’enrolled pursuant to the 15 and 16 Yic., chap. 31. Every
Branch of the (we are entitled to say now) Great Store’s proceedings
are enrolled pursuant to some Act or other. This was their first for-
mal realisation of the design announced eleven years before, of
attempting the organisation of labour. Now they avail themselves of
the Industrial and Provident Societies’ Act for carrying on in common
the trades of cotton and woollen manufacturing. The capital in this
department is £4,000, of which sum £2,042 has been subscribed by
the Equitable Pioneers’ Society. This Manufacturing Society has
ninety-six power looms at work, and employs twenty-six men, seven
women, four boys, and five girls—in all, forty-two persons.
In 1854, the Store commenced to issue an Almanack, in which
their announcements to members were made, and from which the
reader might gather the historic sympathies of the co-operators from
the memorable men and dates selected. Now a considerable portion
of dates is occupied with their Store, and Corn Mill, and other
meetings. Advertisements of the different operations of the society
are given; a little history of its origin is crowded into one corner;
the ancient objects of the society are repeated in another place; such
principles and extracts from the laws as are suitable for the information
of strangers find due place upon the same broad sheet. In 1855 they
announce their Central London Agents:— ‘ The Central Co-operative
Agency, No. 356, Oxford Street.’ In 1856 they add, ‘and the
Universal Purveyor (William Islip and Co.), No. 33, Charing Cross.’
In 1853 the Store purchased, for £745, a warehouse (freehold) on the
opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour,
butcher’s meat, potatoes, and kindred articles. Their committee-
rooms and offices are fitted up in the same building. They rent other
houses adjoining for calico and hosiery,f and shoe stores. In their
wilderness of rooms the visitor stumbles upon shoemakers and tailors,
at work under healthy conditions, and in perfect peace of mind as to

the result on Saturday night. Their warehouses are everywhere as
bountifully stocked as Noah’s Ark, and crowds of cheerful customers
literally crowd Toad Lane at night, swarming like bees to every
counter. The industrial districts of England have not such another
sight as the Rochdale Co-operative Store on Saturday night.
At seven o’clock there are five persons serving busily at the
counter, others are weighing up goods ready for delivery. A boy is
drawing treacle. Two youths are weighing up minor articles and
refilling the shelves. There are two sides of counters in the grocer’s
shop twelve yards long. Members’ wives, children of members, as
many as the shop will hold, are being served; others are waiting at
the door, in social conversation, waiting to go in. On the opposite
side of the street, three men are serving in the drapery department, and
nine or ten customers, mostly females, are selecting articles. In the
large shop, on the same side of the street, three men are chopping and
serving in the butchers’ department, with from twelve to fifteen cus-
tomers waiting. Two other officers are weighing flour, potatoes,
preparing butter, etc., for other groups of claimants. In other
premises adjoining, shoemakers, doggers, and tailors are at work, or
attending customers in their respective departments. The clerk is in
his office, attending to members’ individual accounts, or to general
business of the society. The news-room over the grocery has twenty
or more men and youths perusing the newspapers and periodicals.
Adjoining, the watch club, which has fifty-eight members, is collecting
its weekly payments, and drawing lots as to who shall have the
repeaters (manufactured by Charles Freeman, of Coventry), which the
night’s subscription will pay for. The library is open, and the
librarian has his hands full in exchanging, renewing, and delivering
books to about fifty members, among whom are sons, wives, and
daughters of members. The premises are closed at ten o’clock, when
there has been received during the day for goods £420, and the
librarian has let out two hundred books. In opposite districts of the
town, the Society has now open four Branch Stores for the convenience
of outlying members, where, on a lesser scale, the same features of
sales are being repeated .
But it is not the brilliance of commercial activity in which either
writer or reader will take the deepest interest; it is in the new and
improved spirit animating this intercourse of trade. Buyer and
seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and no
suspicion on the other; and Toad Lane on Saturday night, while
as gay as the Lowther Arcade in London, is ten times more moral.
These crowds of humble working men, who never knew before when
they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was adulterated,
whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats shone
with devil’s dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash,
now buy in the markets like millionaires, and, as far as pureness of
food goes, live like lords. They are weaving their own stuffs, making
their own shoes, sewing their own garments, and grinding their own
HISTORY OF THE

corn. They buy the purest sugar, and the best tea, and grind their
own coffee. They slaughter their own cattle, and the finest beasts of
the land waddle down the streets of Rochdale for the consumption of
flannel weavers and cobblers.* When did competition give poor
men these advantages? And will any man say that the moral
character of these people is not improved under these influences?
The teetotallers of Rochdale acknowledge that the Store has made
more sober men since it commenced, than all their efforts have been
able to make in the same time. Husbands who never knew what it
was to be out of debt, and poor wives who, during forty years, never
had sixpence uncondemned in their pockets, now possess little stores
of money sufficient to build them cottages, and go every week into
their own market with money jingling in their pockets; and in that
market there is no distrust, and no deception; there is no adulteration,
and no second prices. The whole atmosphere is honest. Those who
serve neither hurry, finesse, nor flatter. They have no interest in
chicanery. They have but one duty to perform—that of giving fair
measure, full weight, and a pure article. In other parts of the town,
where competition is the principle of trade, all the preaching in
Rochdale cannot produce moral effects like these.f
As the Store has made no debts, it has incurred no losses; and,
during thirteen years’ transactions, and receipts amounting to £303,852,
it has had no law suits.
Children are not generally sent to shops when adults can be spared
for the errand, as it is very well known children are put off with any-
thing. The number of children who are sent to the Store to make
purchases, is a proof of the honourable family confidence it has
inspired. A child is not sent to the Store with a message to go to a
particular man with grey whiskers and black hair, and get him to
serve, and to be sure and ask him for the ‘ best butter.’ Everybody
has grey whiskers and black hair at the Store; the child cannot go to
the wrong man, and the best butter is given to every one, old and
young, without its being asked for, for the best of all reasons—they
keep no bad.
The meetings of the Store wore quite a family feature during the
first few years. Afterwards, when the members much increased, the
meetings assumed a more commercial character. Of course the Store
will not now hold its eighteen hundred members. They are numerous
enough to make a large public meeting; and the Public Hall, at
Rochdale, has to be engaged when a general meeting is held. The
perfect freedom of intercourse maintained, the equality of all, which
has ever been undisturbed, both in the board room and on every
occasion of intercourse, have imparted an air of independence cf
* Last year, the Society advertised for a Provision Agent to make purchases in Ireland,
and to devote his whole time to that duty.
t The Arbitrators of the Societies, during all their years of office, have never had a case
to decide, and are discontented that nobody quarrels. The peaceableness of the Co-
operators amounts to what elsewhere would be termed 4 contempt of court.’

The Directors of this important and encouraging movement are the
same modest and unassuming men they were thirteen years ago;
shining in oil, or dusted with flour, in flannel jackets and caps, they
in no way answer the expectations of strangers in appearance, how-
ever they surpass expectation in moral and commercial capacity.
These Returns will be much higher for 1858, as the Balance Sheet

Progress of the Store.


CHAPTER VIII.
ANECDOTES OF THE MEMBERS. THE WORKING CLASS STAND BY THE
STORE, AND THEY ‘KNOW THE REASON WHY.’
It is as instructive as it is gratifying to notice the kind of replies fre-
quently made by persons who have been served by the Store. One
woman who had about £5O in the Store to her credit, was told the ‘ Store
would break,’ by persons who wished it would do so. She answered,
‘ W ell, let it break; I have only paid one shilling in, and I have fifty pounds
in it. It ’ll break with its own if it do break.’ These anecdotes
are very common. Many poor people, whose confidence was sought to
he tampered with, have answered alarmists, who have tried to
shake their trust—‘Well, if it do smash it may smash, with all
ii has of mine, for it has paid me out more than ever I paid
in.’ These answers not only show good sense, but gratitude and
generosity of sentiment. In all service of the people there will be
ingratitude displayed. Every man finds it so, sometimes among his private
and chosen friends; no doubt, it will be so with the public, whom you
serve at random. In publicism, in all human relations, a man who
will not he cast down needlessly must learn to look on both sides. He
will in every crowd find many whom he cannot respect, and who do not
deserve respect; and numbers of poor, yet devoted, trusting, toiling,
manly, impassable, grateful men and women, whom you might
worship in the fulness of the sentiment of admiration with which
they inspire you.
Another fact ought not to escape notice, which none hut those
having considerable experience are aware of—viz., it is seldom that
the people whom you expect to help forward a movement do it.
Exactly those on whom you most rely—commonly those whom you
select for appeal—deceive you, or fail to help when you expect, and
when the crisis requires it.
The elfects of the Store in improving the finances of its
members was seen in the instance of one known as Dick, who has
lived in a cellar thirty years, and was never out of debt. He
one morning astonished his milkman by asking him to change him
a£s note. The sly dog never had one before, and he felt a
pardonable pride in displaying his first possession. Dick has now
twenty pounds of ‘ brass ’in Store. And most of those who have the
largest balances standing to their credit, are persons who have never
paid many shillings in. The whole is the accumulation of their
profits.
The following cases, designated by the numbers belonging to the
particular member, were taken by the present writer from the books
of the Store in 1853, and communicated to the Leader newspaper;—

ROCHDALE EQUITABLE PIONEERS.
Two classes exist in all societies who are never to he viewed separately.


‘No. 12 joined the Society in 1844. He had never been out of a shop-
keeper’s books for forty years. He spent at the shop from twenty shillings
to thirty shillings per week, and has been indebted as much as £3O at
a time. Since he has joined the Pioneers’ Society he has paid in con-
tributions £2 18s.; he has drawn from the Society as profits £l7 10s. 7d.;
and he has still left in the funds of the Society £5. Thus he has
had better food and gained £2O. Had such a society been open to him
in the early part of his life, he would now he worth a considerable

out of a shopkeeper’s debt for twenty-five years. His average expen-
diture with the shopkeeper was about ten shillings per week, and was
indebted to him forty shillings or fifty shillings generally. He has
paid into the Society £2 10s.; he has drawn from the Society £6 17s. 5d.;
he has still left in the funds of the Society £8 Os. 3d. He thinks
the credit system made him careless about saving anything, and pre-
vented his family from being as economical as they would have been
had they been compelled to pay ready money for their commodities.
In this he agrees with No. 12. Since he (No. 22) has joined the
Society, he has enjoyed other advantages, having a place accessible,
where he can resort to, instead of going to the public-house or
beer-shop for information and conversation.
‘No. 114 joined the Society in 1848. Paid in fifteen shillings, has
drawn out £ll 14s. lid., has still in the funds of the Society £7 2s. lid.
Gained in two years £lB.
‘ No. 131 joined the Society at its commencement in 1844. He says
he was never out of debt with a shopkeeper for fourteen years. He
spent on an average about nine shillings per week with the shopkeeper,
and generally owed him from twenty to thirty shillings. He has paid into
the Store as contributions at different times £1 18s. 4d.; and has
drawn from it £1 12s. Id.; and has still in the funds of the Society
£3 Is. lOd. He thinks the credit system one reason why he was always
poor, and that since he joined the Society his domestic comfort has
been greatly increased; and had he not belonged to the Society in
1847, he would have been obliged to apply to the parish officers for
relief.
‘ Thus the members derive all the advantage of a sick as well as a
benefit society. It is thus that the Society give to its members the
money which they save.’*
A mother, who had always sent her child to the neighbouring shop,
at length began to send her child to the Store, which was more than
a mile away from her house. The child asked the mother why she
should be sent so far away for things instead of going into the shop
next door. The mother explained to the child that the profits made
at the Store would come to them. The child understood the lesson,
and would come down in a morning to fetch the food for breakfast,

and the family at home would wait till she returned; and, as Sir
James Graham would express it, both mother and child knew the
reason why. A butcher’s wife expressed her new experience thus:—
‘ Instead of having to take her “ strap ” book with her, she now had
money in her pocket and money in the Store.’ One member has £SO
in the Store, all of which he has made by profits, he having drawn
out for his own use all that he ever paid in. In one case a woman
withdrew £5 from her savings in the Store, not so much because she
had special occasion for the money, as for the pleasure of having £5
in her possession. She had traded at shops for nearly half a century,
and she declared it was the first time she had ever had £5 of her own
in her hands in her life.
A husband who dealt at the Store, and had accumulated money in
it, had a wife who did not believe in co-operation, and was easily
persuaded that the Store was unsafe, and she took the opportunity of
drawing his savings from the Store and placed them, for more
safety, in the savings’ bank. Before long the savings’ bank broke.
The poor woman’s faith was made whole by the mishap. She gathered
up the tardy dividends of the bank and replaced the residue in the
Store, where since they have remained.
George Morton, an old man above sixty, says that had there been
no Store, he does not know how he must have lived without going to
the poor-house. The profits he has received from the Store on goods
purchased has nearly kept him in food for the last eleven years —that
is, from 1845 to 1856. He has, during that time, received in dividends
£77 3s. 6d., and has remaining in the Society £ll. He has never
paid into the Society more than £5 16s. 7jd. altogether.
Of the confidence in the dealings of the Store, Mrs. Mills, a widow,
gives this testimony. She came to the Store for a steak, hut as the
Store butchers had none, and she wanted it for a sick person, she went
into the public market and bought a pound and a half. On reaching
home she weighed her purchase, and found that the pound weighed
fourteen ounces, and the half-pound only seven ounces. She now
says that when there is no steak at the Store, ‘ they lump it;’ meaning
that they make shift until the Store is replenished. This anecdote,
which is perfectly genuine, gives no bad idea of a Rochdale sickness,
to which a pound and a half of steak seem congenial. The vege-
tarians might take a turn there.
Speaking of beef—the other day I was standing at the upper
window of the Store, when the Store butchers, who had just come
from the Society’s abbatoirs, drove up with an immense waggon full
of ‘ prime joints.’ Upon looking over the chief butcher’s bill, I found
he reported himself as having ‘ killed four cows anda half,’ which led me
to inquire by what co-operative process he was enabled to kill half a cow
at a time. The explanation was this. Some butcher in the town
wanted half a cow for that day’s market, the Store wanted four cows
and a half only, so the fifth cow was divided and both parties served,
which the butcher called ‘ killing half a cow.’
EOCHDALB EQUITABLE PIONEERS.
Four cows and a half killed weekly.


‘ The Tillycoultry Co-operative Society ’ admits no member who
is immoral in his conduct. A female householder is admitted a mem-
ber, but is refused a vote. The Baking Company of the same place
has a similar ungallant and uncivil rule.*
The Eochdale Store renders incidental but valuable aid towards
realising the civil independence of women. Women may be members
of this Store, and vote in its proceedings. Single and married women
join. Many married women become members because their husbands
will not take the trouble, and others join it in self-defence, to prevent
the husband from spending their money in drink. The husband
cannot withdraw the savings at the Store standing in the wife’s name
unless she signs the order. Of course, as the law still stands, the
husband could by legal process get possession of the money. But a
process takes time, and the husband gets sober and thinks better of it
before the law can move.
Many single women have accumulated property in the Store, which
thus becomes a certificate of their conjugal worth. And young men,
in want of prudent companions, consider that to consult the books of
the Store would be the best means of directing their selection. The
habits of honourable thrift acquired by young men, members of this
Store, renders it unlikely that they would select industrious girls in
marriage for the purpose of living in idleness upon their earnings or
savings, as happens elsewhere. - ) -
What quality is it that makes a poor woman pay her way ? Ladies
do not always do it; many bankruptcies in London are occasioned by
their neglect; the poor woman who has been born with that faculty,
or who has acquired it, is a treasure and a triumph of good sense and
social cultivation. The diflSculty of bringing about this result many
working class husbands can tell. The art of living within your
income is a gift. The woman who has it, will do it with £1 a week;
she who has it not, will be poor with £2O. Peter Noakes, tired of
finding himself always in debt, wants to get his wife one week in
advance with the world. He wants to stand clear on the shopkeepers’
books. He knows that the small tradesman cannot pay his way un-
less his customers pay theirs. He therefore saves, by carefulness and
secret thrift, a little money, and one week delights his wife by giving
her double wages, that she may pay in advance for her things. What
is the result ? Next week he finds her running into debt as usual.
He complains, and then she tells him the everlasting story of a
thousand working class homes, ‘What could she do? Mr. Last’s
bill for Tommy’s boots had never been paid, the account for Billy’s
jacket had stood over till she was ashamed of it, little Jane’s shoes
were out at the toes, and poor Polly, she was the disgrace of the

family for want of a new frock, and as for Mrs. Noakes herself, her
own bonnet was not fit to be seen, she would rather stop in the house
for ever than go out in that old fashioned thing any longer.’ Poor
Peter is overwhelmed—he had never thought of these things. In
fact, Mrs. Noakes tells him, ‘he never does think of anything. He
gets up and goes to work, and comes home and goes to bed, and never
thinks of anything in the house.’ What can Peter do ? He does the
only thing he ought—he allows that his wife ought to know best,
confesses that he is very stupid, kisses her in confirmation of his re-
pentance, and promises to save her another week’s wages, and she
shall try what can be done the next time. In the course of a few
weeks, Peter, hy over-work and going without customary half-pints
of heer, saves up another week’s wages, when, alas! he finds that the
shoemaker has sent in another bill, and the tailor another account —
that Master Tommy’s trousers have grown too short for him, young
Billy’s jacket is out at the elbows, Jane’s shoes let in water, Miss
Polly (bless her sweet soul!) is still the disgrace of the family, and
Mrs. Noakes, although Peter thought she never looked so young nor
so pretty as she did last Sunday, declares her bonnet ‘ perfectly hate-
ful ; indeed, there is not such another fright as herself in the whole
neighbourhood, and if Peter was like anybody else, he would be
ashamed to see his wife go out in such a condition.’ And the little
book still goes to the shop, Peter eats cheese tough as gutta percha,
she buys tea that has been used to boiling before it was sold to her,
the coffee tastes grievously of burnt corn, Tommy’s boots are a long
time being mended, Mrs. Noakes never has sixpence to bless herself
with, her money is all condemned before it comes in; Peter, degraded
and despairing, thinks he may as well drink a pint as a half-pint—
things can’t be worse at home. He soon ceases to take interest in
public affairs. How can he consistently help the public who can-
not help himself? How can he talk of independence, who is the
slave of the shoemaker and the tailor ? How can he subscribe to a
political or social society, who cannot look his grocer in the face ?
Thus he is doubly destroyed. He is good neither for home nor
parish. So ends many domestic experiments for paying in advance.
When children are sick, or the husband is out of work, a wife will
submit to any amount of privation. If she would submit to half
as much from pride of independence as she will from affection,
thousands of families, now always poor, would be in possession of
moderate competence. But to starve your household when you can
help it, to prevent them being starved one day when you cannot help
it, implies good sense, strength of will, and courageous foresight,
which many women certainly display, but which is yet so rare a
quality that one cannot but marvel and applaud the Rochdale Co-
operators, who have taught so many families the art of getting out of
debt, and inspired them with the pride of keeping out.

dom ; let the friends of co-operation ponder on this fact and take

CHAPTER IX.
BULES AND AIMS OF THE SOCIETY.
The founders of the society were opposed to capital absorbing all
nrofit arising from trade, and to hit upon a plan that should give
proportionally the gain to the persons who make it, was a problem
they had to solve. After meeting several times for the purpose of
agreeing to laws, Mr. Charles Howarth proposed the plan of dividing
profits on purchase—that is, after paying expenses of management,
interest on capital invested, at a rate per cent., the remaining profits
to be divided quarterly among the members in proportion to their
purchases or dealings with the society. This plan continues the feature
of the Rochdale Store.
The division of profits is made quarterly from the net proceeds of
all retail sales in every department, after paying:—
1. —Expenses of management.
2. —lnterest on loans.
3. —Reduction in value of fixed stock.
4. —Dividends on subscribed capital.
5. —lncrease of capital for the extension of business.
6. —Two and a half per cent, (of the remainder after the above are
provided for) applied to educational purposes.
The residue thus accruing is divided among the members of the
Store in proportion to the amount of their respective purchases during
the quarter.
The Pioneers prudently established early in their career a ‘ Re-
demption Fund,’ which consists of the accumulation of entrance fees
of one shilling from each member. The last two pounds drawn from
the society by a retiring member are liable to a forfeit of one shilling
each pound. The trade of non-members of the society affords some
profit. These sums go to the Redemption Fund, which is a reserve to
meet the depreciation of the fixed stock. In all financial reports of
the Society a broad allowance is always made for depreciation of
stock, and the fixed capital at stock-taking is always estimated be-
low its real value, so that if the Society broke up, it is calculated that
every subscriber of £1 invested in the Society would receive twenty-
five shillings as his dividend.
A new member must now hold five £1 shares in the capital. He
pays one shilling deposit on these on entrance, and threepence a week
afterwards, or three and threepence a quarter, until the £5 are paid
up ; but these payments are assisted by all the profits he makes by

dealing at the Store, and any interest, which is fixed at 5 per cent.,
accruing to him as successive pounds are made up. All profits and
interest are not paid to the member, but carried to the credit of his
shares, until the £5 are paid.
The board’of directors may suspend any member whose conduct is
considered to he injurious to the Society, and a general meeting may
expel him, after which he has great difficulty in obtaining re-admission,
if he desires it.
The Store supplied the capital for opening the Wholesale depart-
ment, for which it charges that department 5 per cent, interest. The
profits, after paying cost of management and interest on capital, are
divided quarterly into three parts, one part as a reserve against
losses, the remaining two parts among the purchasers, in proportion
to the amount of their respective transactions.
Any Co-operative Society can buy to any extent through one of its
members, who, however, must become a member of the ‘ Equitable
Pioneers’ Society.’
A member, being in distress, may withdraw any sum he may have
in the funds of the Society above £2, at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. In the great distress period of 1849, many applications
were made to be allowed to draw all out except £l. Though it is
rarely that any Director puts a question as to the personal affairs of
an applicant, yet narratives were volunteered of so painful and remark-
able a character, that the Directors learned to esteem that co-operation
which had placed in their hands a wholesome power of relief. To
this day these Directors recur to the experience of that year when
defending the Society. Members may withdraw any sum above £5
according to the following scale of notice:—
£2 10s. at once on application to the Board.
2 10 to 5 at 2 weeks’ notice.

No member can hold more than £loo* of stares in the society
except by way of annuity, nor, under any circumstances, shall his
interest in the funds exceed £3O. The Directors can obtain loans,
hut not exceeding four times the amount of the paid up subscriptions
of the members for the time being.
* A recent Act of Parliament has increased this amount to £2OO.

All disputes are settled—
1. —By the Directors, or
2. —By appeal at a general meeting.
3. —By arbitration.
Complaints and suggestions relative to the qualities "or prices of
goods, or conduct of servants or the Society, are required to be made
in writing to the Directors, who record their decision thereupon; if
this be not satisfactory, the question is referred to a special general
meeting, whose decision is final.
The question of liability to income tax occupied the attention of
the Store for several years. Its apparently final solution may be use-
ful information to other Stores. In August, 1850, the Board applied
to editors of newspapers, who are the popular lawyers of the poor, to
learn whether Co-operative Societies were liable when the individual
members have not the requisite amount of income. Answers so
obtained could not have the force of law, but they had the quality of
direction. The Society paid Income Tax regularly, but as the separate
income of each member was far below the amount at which the
government commences its assessment, the Society appealed against it.
Still the local Commissioners forced its payment. They were told,
indeed, that each member might demand a form of Exemption, and
claim the amount of his assessment back again. But this, on the part
of a thousand members, involved too much trouble, as the Exemption
claims must have been filled up for them in most cases. One year the
members went to the Appeal office in a body, but the Commissioners
refused to admit them, and required one representative to be appointed.
It ended in the old order to pay being enforced. Opinions of Members
of Parliament were obtained, who said the Society was liable, and the
opinions of lawyers, who said they were not liable. As their num-
bers and importance increased, their confidence grew, and, in 1856,
they resolved to make a stand against the exaction, and, if need be,
carry it to trial. An adjourned meeting of the Board,, held in
October, appointed Messrs. Smithies and Ellis ‘to appeal against the
Income Tax.’ These officers, who were trustees of the Society, pre-
sented themselves on Appeal day, and argued that the Society was
exempt, being enrolled under the Industrial and Provident Societies’
Act, which forbid any member receiving more than £3O annually in
any or all forms from the Society. The case was adjourned to another
day, when it was to be heard first. The day came, but Messrs:
Smithies and Ellis were edified by the opportunity of hearing
numerous cases disposed of without their case being called on. They
were told to come the following day. On the ‘ following day ’ they
were told they should receive notice when required to appear, as the
Commissioners were in correspondence with London. Messrs. Smithies
and Ellis had the happiness never to be sent for. However, the In-
come Tax Collector could not refrain from making his accustomed
demand, and insisted that it must be paid, giving the Society the
gratifying assurance that, if illegal, they could get it back again. The

Society, however, were not to be gratified in this way. They thought
it audacity on the part of the collector to make the demand, so long
as the case was undecided, and an attempt to use his legal position to
intimidate uneducated men. Mr. William Cooper reported the case to
the Pioneers’ Board, who put on their minutes, December 4th, 1856, this
very English resolution:— ‘ Resolved, that we do not pay the Income
Tax until we are made.’ The next Saturday, the collector again
called and demanded the money. He was told the decision of the
Board. He replied, in professional terms, that ‘he wanted no un-
pleasantness, but the Society had no alternative but to pay, and that,
if his demand was not paid in a few days, he should seize the goods of
the Store.’ On the Board being informed of that, they resolved, Dec.
18th, 1856, ‘ That the Income Tax Collector take his own course.’ He
has not taken his course to this day, nor have the Commissioners made
any sign of having a course to take.
One most honourable feature of the Society, which proves the earnest
desire of the members for self-improvement, is the reservation of a
portion of their funds for educational purposes. The per cent, of
their quarterly profits assigned for division among the members,
together with the fines accruing from the infraction of rules, con-
stitute a separate and distinct fund, called the ‘ Educational Fund,’ for
the intellectual improvement of the members of the Store, the main-
tenance and extension of the Library,* and such other means of
instruction as may be considered desirable.
Their News-room is as well supplied as that of a London club,
and the Library contains 2,200 volumes of the best, and among
them, many of the most expensive books published. The Library is

free. In their News-room, conveniently and well fitted up, a member
may read, if he has the time, twelve hours a day, also free.
From 1850 to 1855, a school for young persons was conducted at a
charge of twopence per month. Since 1855, a room has been granted
by the Board for the use of from twenty to thirty persons, from the
ages of fourteen to forty, for mutual and other instruction on
Sundays and Tuesdays.
Any readers of these pages, who may contemplate forming Stores
in their own neighbourhood, will, on application to the Secretary of
the Equitable Pioneers’ Society, Toad Lane, Rochdale, obtain the
laws at present in force, and other printed documents from which
executive details may be learned, not necessary to be included in
this history; but a personal visit to the Store ought to be made by
all who would initiate similar establishments. Many Members of
Parliament, political economists, and some distinguished publicists,
have made journeys of late years to the Rochdale Store. The officers
receive with courtesy, and give information with enthusiasm to, all
inquirers. Indeed, they are often found travelling thirty miles from
their homes to give evening explanations to some workmen’s meeting
desirous of information in practical co-operation, and of forming societies
themselves. It will greatly promote the extension of Co-operative
Societies if the Rochdale Pioneers will train officers who may be
transplanted to the towns commencing Stores, to organise and con-
duct them. This co-operative colonisation will save both waste and
failure in many places.
Though an element of self-sacrifice for the good of others—a feeling
that justice rather than selfishness should pervade industrial inter-
course, if it is to be healthy—animates these co-operators, they are
neither dreamers nor sentimentalists. This may best be shown by a
quotation from a letter by one of their leaders, to whom we elsewhere
refer—Mr. Smithies. ‘The improved condition of our members is
apparent in their dress, bearing, and freedom of speech. You would
scarcely believe the alteration made in them by their being connected
with a co-operative society. Many well-wishers to the cause think
that we rely too much upon making ourselves capitalists; but my
experience among the working classes for the last sixteen years has
brought me to the conclusion, that to make them act in union for
any given object, they must be hound together by chains of gold, and
those of their own forging.’
In 1855, a co-operative conference was held at Rochdale. A Com-
mittee was appointed to carry out certain resolutions agreed to.
Abraham Greenwood, President, James Smithies, Secretary, published
a declaration of the principles on which the proceedings of the said
Committee would be regulated. We shall quote them to the credit of
co-operation. They were these
I. That human society is a body consisting of many members,
the real interests of which are identical.
11. That true workmen should be fellow-workers.
HISTORY OP THE
Co-operative colonizers wanted.


TIT. That a principle of justice, not of selfishness, must govern our
exchanges.
We think these three sentences honourably illustrate how much
higher is the morality of co-operation than that of competition.
When did any commercial firm ever issue, and, what is more, act up
to, a manifesto like this ?
The co-operative conference of 1855, held in Rochdale, was called
by the Equitable Pioneers; the delegate from London was Mr. Lloyd
Jones,* who has as continually aided, as he has serviceably defended,
these associations. On this occasion, the Rochdale Society, in
addition to the manifesto of its own principles and public aims, which
entitled it to distinction above all other societies, took the opportunity
of paying a just tribute to the labours of others, to which they had
themselves been indebted, as well as the public;—
‘ They were convinced that the Society for Promoting Working
Men’s Associations had, during the period of its active existence, con-
ferred great benefits on the Co-operative cause, by gathering all sorts
of valuable information, and spreading it throughout the country
amongst the various Co-operative bodies; by urging on the attention
of Parliament, through members favourable to the cause, the legal
hindrances to the movement; and by helping to procure such alter-
ations of the laws relating to Friendly Societies as to give freer action
and greater security to the men who have embarked in the Co-
operative undertaking. Not only have they done these things, but
they have likewise drawn up model laws suitable for either distribu-
tive or productive associations, so as to facilitate the safe enrolment of
all Co-operative bodies, and to secure the highest degree of legal
accuracy with the smallest possible cost; in addition to which, they
have at all times given legal advice freely to such of the Societies as
stood in need of it—a matter, it must he acknowledged, of great'value
to bodies of working men. There was one object, however, which the
gentlemen belonging to this Society did not accomplish, although
they aimed to do so with much perseverance and great patience, and
that was to beget amongst those engaged in the movement a recog-
nition of the duties that spring from the principle upon which these
Societies are founded, a recognition without which co-operation can
never acquire unity and force sufficient to carry it triumphantly over
the obstacles which competition, united with ignorance and selfishness,
oppose to its progress.
‘The Rochdale Equitable Pioneers feel deeply the value of the
services rendered to Co-operation by the Council of the Society for

Central Agency of London, and subsequent traveller for that firm, has frequently visited
the working and co-operative societies of the North of England, and addressed the mem-
bers at their anniversary meetings. On these occasions, and at the several co-operative
conferences held in London, Manchester, Rochdale, Leeds, and Bury, he has exercised an im-
portant influence in the development of the co-operative idea. The ‘ wholesale depart-
ment * of the Rochdale Store , so important a step in organisation, was carried out under bis

acceptable acknowledgment, they considered that the best thing they
could do would he to attempt to continue the work which the Society
for Promoting Working Men’s Associations had begun, and perfect,
if possible, the design which they unfortunately failed to complete.’
Never was testimony more nobly deserved than this thus borne to
the services rendered to working men by the gentlemen known in
London as ‘ Christian Socialists.’ Professor Maurice, Mr. Yansittart
Neale, the Rev. Charles Kingsley, Mr. Furnival, Mr. Ludlow, and
others, guided by their wisdom and sustained by their wealth, efforts
for ‘ Promoting Working Men’s Associations,’ for which the people will
be more grateful as they acquire more knowledge to appreciate their
sympathy, their generosity, their patient and costly services. The
Working Men’s College of London is the crowning tribute of their
catholic love of the people.
The Rochdale Store has done business for several years with 1 The
Universal Purveyor,’ instituted by J. L. St. Andre,* author of the
‘Prospects of Co-operative Associations in England,’ a volume re-
markable for comprehensive views of industrial organisation. In the
words of one whose approval is praise, ‘ M. St. Andre, whatever may
be his enthusiasm, or his over-estimate of what can be done with men
as they are, appears to have the merit of a sincere desire to draw
associations together in a spirit of unselfish co-operation, and at the
same time to place them in a healthy connection with the external world.' j -
We record, and rightly, the names of inventors and discoverers—
we record the names of those who signalise themselves on the field of
battle—it is no less useful to record the names of those who have dis-
covered, or perfected, or, at least, improved the art of self-help among
the people, and conquered in the field of industry, providence, and
good sense, where so many fail and perish. Every name represents
the continuity of small duties well fulfilled—a quality more valuable
to society than the emulation of sublime virtues. Every member of
this Store has been a co-worker equally with the officers, but we can
only enumerate those who have taken the lead in the greatest
and most successful experiment ever conducted by the people.
Their perseverance must give a new idea of the capacity of the
working class.
The first general meeting of the founders of the Store was held in

CHAPTER X.
THE OLD CO-OPERATORS —WHY THEY FAILED. THE NEW CO-
OPERATORS —WHY THEY SUCCEED.
‘ That were a noble achievement which should originate a system of
more wages and less work, that the labour of the handicraftsman might
be lighter on his hands, and his earthly blessings and little comforts
be increased; and that were a still more worthy achievement which
should teach him to fill his intervals of time with the study of phi-
losophy, and the pursuit of literature and science.’ Thus wrote
Dr. Chalmers.
‘ This that they call organisation of labour, is, if well understood,
the problem of the whole future, for all who would in future govern
man.’ Thus wrote Thomas Carlyle.
‘ It appears from actual experiment, that a thousand subscribers of
from one penny upwards will yield a weekly revenue of £5. In
Great Britain there are 6,000,000 adult males. Take of these, in-
cluding such females as choose to subscribe. 4,000,000; these will yield

Now this sum would buy all the property of the kingdom. Do not
suppose for a moment that 4,000,000 of working men will soon be
found steadily subscribing their penny or twopence a-week for this
object; but these figures show what a fund there lies in the smallest
co-operation of the millions, and which the devotion of the sums ex-
pended merely on spirits and tobacco might accomplish for mankind.’
So calculates the Leeds Redemption Society, and seeks to win by
figures those whom rhetoric fails to reach.
‘ Wait no longer on the banks of the great and ever-growing river
of poverty, for the golden boat of the capitalists to carry you over,
till you perish. Awake to the fact you may become capitalists your-
selves —that you can and must help yourselves.’ Thus exhorts the
People's Journal , in its genuine sympathy for the working classes.
Upon how many thousands of our countrymen have these words of
wise direction fallen, as upon ‘ stony ground.’ The more, therefore,
the esteem with which the public will regard the men of Rochdale,
upon whom they have not fallen in vain.
That co-operation was the secret whereby the poor could make
money was known to old co-operators, though the Rochdale Society
has been the most skilful in turning it to progressive account; for as
early as 1831, one William Shehnerdine, storekeeper of a society,
meeting at 7, Rodger’s Row, Deansgate, Manchester, reported that
their members, with a stock of only £46 125., and subscriptions of
£26 10s., had made, in twelve months, £2O 2s. of profits. Eight
members founded the society, and thirty-six had joined it by the end
of the year.
The second Co-operative Congress was held in Birmingham, in
October, 1831. The first appears to have been held in Manchester,
in May, in the same year. In this year, the Lancashire and York-
shire Co-operator appeared—a small fortnightly penny paper, calling
itself the advocate of the useful classes, and bearing this sensible
motto: —
‘ Numbers without Union are powerless —
And Union without Knowledge is useless.’
The true warning is here, though twenty-six years of experience has
not supplied the necessary wisdom to profit by it.
At the third London Co-operative Congress, 1832, there was re-
ported the existence of a ‘ Rochdale Friendly Co-operative Society,’

which sent, as a delegate to London, one William Harrison. It had a
secretary of the gentle name of T. Ladyman, whose address was 70,
Cheetham Street, Rochdale. The Society was formed October, 1830.
In 1832 it had fifty-two members. It employed ten members and
families. It manufactured flannel. It had thirty-two volumes in its
library. It had never discussed the ‘ principles of exchangeand
there were two societies in its neighbourhood.
In 1832, there existed in Birkacre a society, whose secretary was
Ellis Piggot, Printer’s Arms, Salford,,which had 3,000 members and
,£4,000 of funds. This society were silk and calico printers.
At the third London Co-operative Congress there were sixty-five
societies represented, of which nine were in London. Of the dele-
gates or secretaries, the following names axe still known: —W. Lovett,
B. Cousins, T. Whitaker.
Why have so many stores one after the other disappeared ? Some
have not known how to turn their prosperity to a progressive account,
and have grown tired of a monotonous success. There have been of
late years failures around Rochdale; the leading cause assigned is the
system of credit.
The Oldham Mechanics’ Store, and the Bolton Store, were broken
up through the strike of the amalgamated ironworkers; but it was said
they paid twenty shillings in the pound. The Brighton Store did not
acquit itself so well on its failure, which was attributed to its giving
credit to its members. Mr. Smithies, who is certainly the most com-
petent and practical authority we can follow, said, writing in 1855:
‘Nearly all the Stores, there is hardly one exception, are now on the
ready-money principle. We find that those Co-operative Societies
which commenced by giving credit, but have since adopted the ready
money plan, have all improved since doing so. I look upon the strap
book,’ says he, ‘as one of the greatest evils that can befal a working
man. He gets into debt with the shopkeeper, and is, for ever after,
a week behind; and, as we express it here, eats the calf in the cow’s
belly.’
Hence arose that just terror of credit which the Store from the
first betrayed. In their first book of laws—the laws of 1844—the
grand fine, the lion fine of the list there given, was to be inflicted
on any officer, who, on any pretence, should either purchase or sell
any article except for ready money; which prohibition, as usual
when they are emphatic, is given twice over.
The Liverpool Co-operative Store, rising every year in importance
and usefulness, gives credit to the amount of two-thirds of the paid
up shares of the members. The Store connected with Price’s Patent
Candle Manufactory acts upon a similar rule. This, of course, is a
perfectly safe form of credit, but it involves a great additional amount
of book-keeping, and stops short of that moral discipline which ready
money payments exercise upon the poor and naturally improvident.
In Rochdale, each workman in the manufacturing department is
required to become a capitalist. Either by weekly subscription or
HISTORY OP THE

other payments he is required to hold five shares in the Society. Each
of these artizan shareholders receives 5 per cent, upon the amount he
has invested. After the payment of this interest, and the wages of the
workmen at the usual average of the district, and all trade expenses,
the surplus of profit is divided according to the wages received by
each workman. The amount of profit over 5 per cent, interest, which
is first paid to the shareholders, is divided equally between the share-
hplders and the workmen. One half goes to the shareholder
according to the number of his shares; the other half goes to the
workman or workwoman according to the wages paid to him or her.
The dividend in the Rochdale Co-operative workshops, paid January,
1857, was one shilling and sixpence upon every pound of wages
received by workman or workwoman.
An important difference in the division of co-operative profits in
Padiham and in Rochdale must be noticed. In Padiham, workmen
who had made small savings, and other minor capitalists, subscribed a
fund among them, bought machinery, and employed workmen. The chief
profits were reserved by the subscribers of the capital for themselves.
The workmen they employed had better situations and somewhat
higher wages than at other mills. This arose from most of the pro-
prietors being workmen, and having a sympathy with the persons they
employed. In other respects, the Padiham Cotton League Company,
under the Joint Stock Companies’ Act, paid their profits wholly to the
capitalists or shareholders. All the Societies enrolled under this act
are understood to pursue this rule. It is no part of their plan to
acknowledge the labourer’s right to a share of the profits his labour
creates, which is the Rochdale principle.
By precautions and good sense, the Rochdale Co-operators have
succeeded, notwithstanding the impediments the prejudices of their '
class put in their way. During the period known among them as ‘ the
Corn Mill Panic,’ Mr. Coningham, M.P., to whom the country is
indebted for valuable personal reports of the Working Men’s Asso-
ciations of Paris, consented to make an advance of capital to assist in
the exigence of the Corn Mill, but on being very naturally required
to submit their securities to the examination of his solicitor, the
Board objected to ‘having anything to do with a lawyer,’ yet
their securities were ample and good, and they knew it.
Confidence among the members was sought the first year of the
existence of the Store by establishing and showing plainly that checks
upon the honesty of the officers existed.* Drawers conveniently con-
structed are now used by each salesman, provided with brass or tin coins
according to the nature of his sales, of which he hands to each purchaser
an amount exactly representing the cash expended.
The treasurer and secretary of the Store, the Corn Mill, and Manu-
facturing departments, balance their cash accounts weekly. This rule,

which enables errors to be corrected as they may arise, has operated
very beneficially.
Security is now taken from £2OO to £lO from each officer employed,
according to his measure of responsibility. Each officer in charge of
a shop till gives £lO security. Where other guarantee is not pro-
vided, the Society holds the deposits of the officer in the Society, and
ifhehas not a sufficient amount paid in,he is required to make up such
amount by periodical payments. For sums so lying in the hands of
the Society, interest is paid as in the case of shares. This is a very
efficient regulation of securities, for no man will find it answer his
purpose to rob himself. The early Boards of Directors assisted the
shopmen in their duties. Economical in all their improvements, it was
not until 1854 that they lowered the floor of their flour Store, for the
convenience of children and the aged members coming to make purchases.
Numerous Stores have at times sprung up around the Rochdale
one, and in consequence of its example; but none have been con-
ducted with the same ability, nor have achieved more than a tithe of
its success. This is owing to no fault in the principle, but to defi-
ciency on the part of those who apply it, to want of sense, of union,
of patience, and enterprise. The reare numerous instances in which
the Stores have not only succeeded, but, in the opinion of the mem-
bers, have succeeded too well. They have made more money than
they know what to do with. Not knowing how to employ their
savings advantageously, they have been returned to the members, who
have commenced again. Their Directors have lacked the talent of expand-
ing their operations, and making their capital reproductive. The Roch-
dale Weavers appear to have been born with a special talent for
co-operation.
One cause of the striking success of these co-operators is, no doubt,
to be found in the great economy of their trade expenses. The pro-
portion of the salaries they pay to their receipts is very small * It
would he impossible to maintain the same rate in the metropolis,
where rents and wages are higher, and the rate of poor men’s provi-
sions, in leading articles, the same. In answer to a question put to
him on this point, Mr. W. Cooper writes me—‘l see no reason why
the people of London cannot carry on a Co-operative Society as well
as people who live in the provinces. In a small town, some dozen or
twenty persons will meet, and agree that if a Co-operative Provision
Store could be commenced it would be a 'good. These twelve or
twenty do commence one. They work on together, determined to
make the thing do. When it has worked on awhile, people who
doubted begin to see that it can be carried out, and they join too. I
see no reason why a number of earnest men in London cannot act in
the same way.’ In answer to other questions, the same informant
* The cost of distribution at the central Ftore is If per cent, upon the returns, and with
the branch shops, about per cent.; so that for two per cent, all working expenses of rent,
rates, wages, etc., are defrayed.— John Holmes’s paper, partially read before the British
Association for the Advancement of Social Science, at Birmingham, which we commend to
the reader.
HISTORY OF THE
How co-operative Stores originate.


writes—‘At the commencement of a Co-operatiye Store or Manu-
facturing Society, it is essential that the members be visited or
brought together often, so that contributions may he collected to
establish and carry on the Society, and that the members may become
acquainted with the objects, position, and requirements of the Society.
With this kind of management a Store easily acquires sufficient
capital to work its business with, because the members have gained
confidence, and pay in subscriptions on their own account without
being much looked after.’
To get people together in this personal and continuous manner is
the difficult problem in London. Making some allowance for higher
expenses in proportion to profits, the thing might be done if a num-
ber of the working class could be got to act together, and keep together,
for this end. It requires to convert a number of them to a clear view
of their own personal interest, to be promoted in no other way, and a
deep sense of duty towards their order, whose character is elevated by
such successes. Compare Rochdale with Liverpool for instance. In
Rochdale, a little bridge, that spans, like a rocking horse, an imaginary
stream, in which there is nothing liquid but the mud, situated in an
invisible part of the town, is the only picturesque object in it. There
is, indeed, a church with a flight of steps to it, so narrow, steep, and
interminable, that yon can never get to it, or if you do, it is a question
as to whether you will ever get back. The remainder of the town is
made up of roads that lead to nowhere, ornamented with factories
apparently built before the dawn of architecture. There is not a
building in Rochdale upon which it will do any one good to look. The
town is in the shape of a tea cup, with a gutter at the bottom and a
burying ground upon the rim. In such a place, if people are disposed
to act together, there is nothing in the way of striking attraction
around them to prevent them. The people are immensely before the
town, which, like many other manufacturing towns in the north, has
grown into importance anyhow; but will, no doubt, yet assume the
magnificence which is gradually being imported into Bradford, Leeds,
and other places, which, twenty years ago, were quite as unpromising
as Rochdale. Now pass to Liverpool, with the bright and busy
Mersey—its migratory population —its magnificent buildings—its open
halls, surpassing in variety those of*London. Plainly, it requires
more devotion among the few to carry a Store to success here than it
does in Rochdale. Then if you compare the ordinary provincial
town, fixed, stolid, and tame, with London and its countless attractions,
the difficulty is greater. The people are ‘ too clever by half’ to be
useful. Will a dozen men stick to a plan of reform year after year,
never failing on the weekly night of meeting to be at their posts, amid
the charms of the metropolis ? Dickens is making a speech at Drury
Lane, or reading his ‘ Christmas Carol ’ at St. Martin’s Hall—Thackeray
is lecturing on the ‘ Four Georges ’ at the Surrey Gardens, with
Mr. Spurgeon to succeed him—Robson is coming out in a new
character—Mr. Saunders has a new play at the Haymarket—

Gallery and the British Museum, and the Houses of Commons and
Lords, South Kensington Museum, and public meetings, where you
may hear speakers never to be heard before, and often never again—
and countless other allurements. A man must have self-denial as
well as interest, who steadfastly grinds coffee berries and watches the
sale of tea and sugar, and sits for fourteen years upon Candle and
Treacle committees, amid this confluence of celebrities and novelties.
This is why popular movements in London, which depend upon the
working and middle classes, make such uncertain progress. Unless a
man be wise enough to choose a side and discharge its obligations as a
sacred duty, undertakes to win others to act in concert with him and
pursues his object with the fidelity of a soldier, nothing can be de-
pended upon. In fine, it requires working men in London to be as
superior to the average of their class in the metropolis as the Pioneers
of Rochdale are superior to the average of their own class in Lan-
cashire, and then co-operation may carry its moral discipline and
physical comfort among the poor of London by district operation.
The Leeds Corn Mill Society—the Padiham Co-operative Manu-
facturers—the Galashiels Co-operators—present features of success
worthy to be placed side by side with the Rochdale Store. Whether
in being originated and conducted by purely working men —whether in
the variety and development of their operations—whether in propa-
gandist spirit—they are to be compared or placed before the Rochdale
Pioneers, are matters I leave for others to determine. The public
will be glad to hear more about these experiments than these pages
can communicate.*
Just as the farmers, some years ago, could not be prevailed upon to
make returns of their crops, lest their interests should be prejudiced
in Parliament by the fact, so the Co-operators in some districts,
having the fear of the Income Tax Commissioners before their eyes
(the Rochdale issue of this question not being known, or not being
considered settled), or distrust of government, object to make reports.
Mr. T. Barker, of Todmorden, in an unfilled return sheet before me,
assigns this reason for its incompleteness. Todmorden, Walsden,
Bridge End, Alma Works, and Commercial, are the Flour Mills,
Stores, and Works mentioned on his return. Mr. Smithies, of Roch-
dale, whom I had requested to get certain forms filled up for me,
despairs on these grounds of succeeding.
Working men were once injudiciouslytreated by employers in this way.

HISTORY OP THE
Peculiarities of Co-operation in London and the provinces.


Where the men dressed with some taste, and maintained an appear-
ance of social comfort, masters were apt to infer that they were
doing too well, and would reduce their wages. This had a disastrous
influence on the men, who came to regard careless habits and indigence
of dress means of keeping up wages. How were working men to be
raised from improvidence while those who ought to incite them to
improvement suggested to them the policy of keeping themselves
poor, in order to avoid being made poor. A master whose pride or
ignorance was put to the blush by superiority in the manners of his
men, would reduce their wages in order to lower their tone. This,
however, has greatly changed now; and where it has not changed,
working men have had the sense to perceive that the majority of
masters are prouder of being enabled to say ‘ all my men are worth
money,’ than that ‘half of them are in debt.’ Throughout mankind
the tendency is universal to help those who can help themselves.
The poorest man that exists will, if he reflects, find himself un-
consciously acting on this feeling. The very beggar will not give to
the beggar if he has reason to think that what he gives him will do
him no good. There is no benevolence, high or low, that will many
times repeat the act of pouring the water of charity into a sieve. This
fact, so common to every man’s experience, should teach the working
class that if they display the habits of thrift, others will display the
disposition to help. Moral statistics will assure the intelligent work-
man that where there is one employer who reduces the wages of his
men because of their social aspirations, there are ten who reduce
them because they see no hope of their improvement.
Writers who speak with the authority of political science, have
testified to the utility of these efforts of self-help, some of which we
have here endeavoured to illustrate. One to whom the working
classes are indebted both for instruction and defence, remarks;— ‘ We
think, moreover, that these Co-operative Associations may be one of
the most powerful of the many influences now at work for the
education of the lower orders of the people; that wisdom will be
gained, if not wealth, from the industry, self-control, and mutual
forbearance needed to conduct them.’*
This is the place where one may usefully cite words which one of
the sincerest friends of the people has written, and which cannot be
too widely known among them, as this grave truth is not to be dis-
puted. ‘ I must, indeed, avow it as my own strong impression, that
the deepest deficiency in the operatives of our great towns is a moral
one, consisting in an extravagant susceptibility to the opinion of their
own order, or an unreasonable suspicion of even the best masters.
‘ I lately heard the case of a letter-printer, now deceased, who used
to employ in his trade the savings of bis workmen with mutual ad-
vantage. At one time, he had thus in his hands as much as a thousand
pounds, the property of one of the workmen. A master manufacturer

at Manchester assured me that he would gladly employ in his business
any sums which his men would entrust him with, but that it was out
of the question, although, personally, he was on excellent terms with
them. To invest money in their master’s business, would be binding
themselves to his interests, and separating themselves proportionally
from that of their own order. Such a step might even expose them
to resentment, and, at any rate, their party feeling was too alive.
They had an indefinable suspicion that the master would he able to
take advantage of it. Many of them, perhaps, did not like the master
to know how rich they were. If they could set up a business among
themselves, with their own capital, this would flatter their pride ; hut
to combine with their master was so unpalatable a thought, that they
preferred to receive at the Savings’ Bank a smaller per centage than
he would give them, or else to contribute their money (in large mea-
sure to he wasted) at Benefit Clubs, or finally to consume it in imme-
diate enjoyment.
‘All the information which I have been able to gather, converges to
the same conclusion : that the operatives have a decided repugnance
to the only thing which has a reasonable chance of doing them good
collectively—viz., a closer union between themselves and their master.
If this be the case, they must wait and suffer, until their mind is
changed, or until a new generation rises, with a better mind.’*
But no sentence ever written about the people is more likely to
serve them than the following words by Mr. J. S. Mill:— ‘ In Europe
the time, if it ever existed, is long past, when a life of privation had
the smallest tendency to make men better workmen or more civilised
beings.’ This sentence strikes at the root of that intellectual apathy
about the condition of the people, which has checked, and still checks,
so many endeavours for their elevation. The gentlemen of England
are, as a class, probably less indolent and sensual than the poor.
Opulence, and the means of physical ease, have not robbed them of
enterprise. No spur of privation remains to stimulate them, hut the
spur of intellect, of art, of high cultivation, excites them, occupies
them, interests them —a new pride possesses them, and a lofty con-
sciousness of nobler powers than those which poverty simulated, now
carries them on to a destiny undreamed of, and, indeed, undesired before.
When this truth is applied to the common people, when it is no longer
an article of parish faith, that ‘ privation ’ is the sole incentive of labour,
the social policy of our rulers will be changed, and the systematic ele-
vation of the people begin.
When, a few years ago, Mr. Carlyle began, with his noble insight, to
write of ‘ Captains of Industry,’ he was considered to have visions of
the most hopeless class of chieftains ever pictured in romances. But
his ideas, grafted on the age, have taken root. Modern employers, if
they wished, might found chieftainships, nobler far than those of
feudal days, and will, no doubt, do it yet. The Crossleys, Akroyds,

former tenements —it stands the Monarch of Warehouses. The
factory worker grows taller by looking up at it—the most insensible

headed, shrewd Bradford man, grow somewhat refined, and even
proud, if he has a spark of national spirit in him, as his way home lies
by those noble structures every day rising up on his path, and raising
the industrial glory of his native town and land ? Are we not all far
away, proud to think that trade is not all mammon worship and gross
materialism. Is it not a relief to see the careful saving merchant,
wooing the arts, and obtain from the brain of the designer glorious
structures, in which to wear his patiently earned wealth ? Let not the
pallid, often stunted, hot-air-stewed factory hands of Hyde, on pre-
carious nine shillings or fourteen shillings a week, nurse a sense of
perpetual despondency. Their turn is coming. When the noble
warehouse has, for some time, been admired, public attention will be
turned to the factory, and next to the ‘ factory hand,’ and will be found
quite ready to admire both, if they will bear admiring; and then
it will never do for the proud and rich employer to say, ‘ Oh,
I keep dainty rooms to store my cottons in; but as for the
people who make them, any murky, sooty, unventilated and
dreary den will do for them.’ The day is coming when no
employer in the north will like to say this. Mr. Titus Salt has been
the first to feel this, and Saltaire, the noble factory and dwellings he
has erected, point to what will one day be done. Workmen think it a
privilege to get an engagement in Mr. Salt’s mill. The town of
Bingley has been deserted by men who prefer Saltaire. The work-
men’s rooms, in which the factory operations are carried on, are nobler,
higher, healthier, pleasanter rooms, than the drawing rooms of the
gentlemen of the north fifty years ago. Any workshop in Saltaire is
Elcasanter than any room m the house you pass at Bury, where the
ite Sir Robert Peel was born.
A man, whose soul is affluent as well as his circumstances, will supple-
ment his stately warehouse by a stately and healthy factory; from
being an artist in his premises, he will, to use Mr. Thornton Hunt’s
words, become ‘an artist in flesh.’ He will covet that his men shall, in
their way, look as well and bear themselves as gracefully as his machines,
and then that they shall dwell in homes as tasteful, as salubrious,
and as suitable as those accorded to spinning jennies: he will

covet that the ring of his money shall echo with the contentment of
those who aided to earn it. Thus were advocates silent, and the plea
of humanity disregarded, and social rights ignored, a principle of
artistic consistency would, one day, enforce universal co-partnership in
the produce of industry and the conquests of science.
A SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER
OF ILLUSTRATIVE PAPERS AND NOTES.
During the progress of this little book through the press, which has
been protracted much beyond the usual time, some new incidents in
the career of the Store and its Departments have arisen, which deserve
brief notice, to which we shall subjoin the latest Balance Sheet issued.
Lately the Store has been attacked in local newspapers, and on
placards, by anonymous writers, who appear to seek the destruction
of the Society by sowing disunion and creating distrust of its financial
security. The attacks were commenced during the panics of 1857.
In the December quarter the Board reported that although unfavour-
able reports had been circulated respecting ‘ the Stores,’ the number
of members on the books was greater by forty-eight than at the com-
mencement of the quarter —making a total of 1848. Had the placard
writers here referred to, succeeded in their design, considerable injury
would have been done at that time, when so many firms were daily
breaking, to a large body of the working class. Had the credit of
any commercial House been attacked in the same way, a jury would
have given considerable damages, had the case been brought before
them: and we think the Board of Directors would do well to regard
themselves as entitled to the usual protection of commercial Houses,
and to make an example of the first responsible assailants to whom
they can trace similar wanton aggressions. There is fear that
enemies to the success of the Pioneers, enemies on competitive grounds,
will, .now that the Pioneers have become really formidable, seek to
destroy them by disunion. It requires great good sense and mutual
powers of forbearance to sit silent, and see statements published, which
appear to the public more than half true, and which you know to be
wholly false. The temptation to go into controversy in self-defence
is very great; and the ease with which controversy slides into perso-
nalities we all know—then time is wasted, temper lost, and only
scandal is gained, and the enemy triumphs. Any shrewd opponent
may naturally calculate that amid 2,000 persons, some will he found
who may, by taunts of want of courage, or want of truth, he seduced
into a disastrous newspaper or placard war. It is said of the first
Napoleon, that in the early part of his Italian campaign he was
followed by r numerous letters, some criticising him, some abusing him,
and all perplexing him very much to answer. After a good deal of
time had been consumed in replies, which time might have been much
HISTORY OP THE
Anonymous placard opponents.


better employed upon maps and strategy, and actual war with the
enemy, it occurred to him to throw all his letters into a capacious
basket, and let them lie there for six weeks: at the end of which
period, he found that time and events had answered them nearly all.
We recommend some such plan as this to the Board of Directors of
the Rochdale Store. We recommend them to refer all matters of
controversy to a committee of three clear-headed, dispassionate men,
whose duty it should be to give very brief explanations of any point
really misunderstood; and if any controversy seemed called for, to
enter upon it only once a year, and to lay by all placards, newspapers,
letters, and articles, until December, and then reply, to what time and
success may not have confuted, and what the public may not have
forgotten (which will be found to be nine-tenths of the whole), and
then let silence and peace prevail for twelve months more.
Wn now subjoin examples of the Quarterly Reports issued by the
Board of Directors of the Equitable Pioneers, and the Committee of
Management of the R. D. C. C. M. S. (Rochdale District Co-operative
Corn Mill Society), to the Members. In matters of moral speculation,
it is said that nothing is so delusive as statistics; but in matters com-
mercial nothing is more satisfactory than figures. A good tall balance
on the right side is as intelligible as a flag on a fortress.
NO I. —BOCHDALE EQUITABLE PIONEEBS’ SOCIETT.
Fifty-third Quarterly Report of the Accounts of the Society, for the
Quarter ending March 2Zrd, 1858.
The profits this quarter are much larger than last, which may be
partly accounted for by the fact, that at the commencement of the
quarter we had a quantity of goods on hand, the market price of
which was then very low, but which advanced during the quarter.
It has been resolved upon by the members at the quarterly meeting
that the minor accounts should not be printed, but that they should
be posted in the News Room, to which all the members have free
access.
Your Board of Directors have the satisfaction to inform the
members that the prospects of the Society are most cheering, consider-
ing the effects of the late panic through which we have just passed,
without any serious drawback in any of our undertakings; they have
also great pleasure in stating that the Library has been considerably
extended during the past quarter.

NO II. —ROCHDALE DISTRICT CORN MILL SOCIETY’S
Twenty-Ninth Quarterly Report , ending March 27th, 1858.
In issuing another Quarterly Report, the Committee of Manage-
ment heg to call the attention of members to the gradual
progress in the business of the Society. In the quarter just
ended there is a slight falling off in the value of the business done,
owing to a depreciation in the price of flour. On the other hand,
there has been a fair, and on the whole, a satisfactory increase on the
quantity of business done, as the following figures of the previous
quarter’s transactions —compared with those of the quarter ending
March, 1858, of the present year, will show.

NO. V.— RECENT LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE PIONEERS*
SOCIETY.
Equitable Pioneers’ Co-operative Stores,
Nos. 8, 16, and 31, Toad Lane,
Rochdale, April 17th, 1858.
Sib, —By this post I send the above report of the R. D. C. C. M. S.
for March, 1858, from which you will see that the Society is making
progress —as is the co-operative principle as a whole. I think I told
you that our next step forward will he to extend the operations of
the ‘ Manufacturing Society ’ here, and, while I write, a Committee
is sitting to consider proposals which have been made in response to
an advertisement for a capitalist to build us a Mill, which we purpose
to fill with machinery, and work. The working classes may at times
lose by having over confidence, hut do not they lose much more who
never have any confidence ? The five thousand members of the Co-
operative Societies within ten miles of Rochdale, representing
twenty-five thousand persons, could not derive the benefits they now
receive unless they had confidence in each other and in the principle of
co-operation. Wehavereceivedinformation by telegram that Dr. Bernard
is acquitted, which produces great pride and satisfaction here. The
people here are in no mood either to pander to, or flatter, the Emperor
of France: a little more, and they would have been prepared to
go to war—not with France, but Napoleon.

NO. VI. THE OPINION AND ADVICE OP LOED GODEBICH, M.P.
(A later Letter from the Secretary of the Store.)
We received a long letter from Mr. Holmes, of Leeds, this morning, April
26, 1858, which shows that they are aiming at Co-operative Stores to
distribute their groceries in preference to the agency principle, which
they adopted to distribute the flour made at their Mill. In the course of
his letter he remarks, ‘ The other day our West Riding Member, Lord
Goderich, being in the town, visited our Mill, and met the Board in a
conference. We had a very interesting meeting and conversation.
His lordship told us we, Leeds and Rochdale (or rather Rochdale and
Leeds, for we cheerfully give way to your superiority), were the
objects of frequent conversations both in the House and out of it;
that our success was most welcome to some good statesmen, who see
if the people are doing well, all else must be well. Our prosperity
was pointed at as proving the people can, and will, manage their own
affairs. If we fail, the reputation of the principle will be seriously
damaged, and when our contentions and difficulties are mentioned, it
ties their hands. He told us it was not ourselves alone we should
consider; we were now objects held up and closely watched by other
Societies, and other people would follow us if we succeed, or be dis-

heartened if we fail. We had a most kind and strong exhortation
to go on, economise, save, and extend —to be shrewd, wise
and peaceful. It would take me long to tell you all, but he
promised us good service should we need it, and he he able to do us
good. By the way, I could recommend you to send reports to Lord
Goderich, Mr. Conningham, M.P., Mr. Slaney, M.P., and other good
friends in London. It affords them pleasure, and their sympathy is
deserving of return.’
The cordial interest taken by Lord Goderich in the welfare of the
working classes is well known, not only in the West Biding but
throughout England. We choose to close this brief history with the
above transcript of Ms wise and influential words of encouragement
and advice.
