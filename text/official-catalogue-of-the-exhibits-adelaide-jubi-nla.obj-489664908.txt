THIS Metal is the nearest approach to STERLING SILVER IN COLOUR AND
FINISH, and the same colour all through. It approaches steel in hardness,
resists acids and doe? not tarnish, and, from its moderate cost, is pronounced by
Dealers and Experts by far the best value ever introduced. It is also admirably
adapted for Electroplating ; its hard smooth surface allows a beautiful finish with-
out loss of silver, and the metal resembles so closely the silver coating, that it is
not perceptible when parts wear through, as the case with other metals. Price-
Lists and Samples sent upon application.
Note.— Can be obtained from all Importers and Dealers.

KEPLER EXTRACT OF MALT.
A concentrated extract of the best malted barley, rich in all the digestive and
highly nutritious properties of the grain. The Kepler Malt Extract is pre-
scribed in those low conditions of the system where no other malt extract can
be borne, or if borne, does no good.
The Lancet reports : —lt is one of our best nutritive and digestive agents
for atonic dyspepsia, and is undoubtedly useful in consumption and other
wasting diseases.”
The London Medical Record, reports The Kepler Extract of Malt
is the best, the richest in diastase, and the most largely used.”
THE KEPLER SOLUTION
OF
COD LIVER OIL IN MALT EXTRACT.
The most powerful “force-producing” and “ tissue-forming” food that can
be made. In conjunction with the force-giving and fattening properties of the
oil, we have the desirable digestive assistance rendered by the diastase ; while
the albumenoids and vitalising phosphates act as a food to muscle, bone and
brain.
The Medical Press and Circular says it is “the most palatable and
easily digested.”
The British Medical Journal calls it—“An ideal form for the
administration of fat.”
HAZELINE.
The Medical Times and Gazette says It is useful especially in
bruises, sprains, chaps, and insect stings ; being of special value for inflamed
piles and other irritated mucous surfaces.”
Dr. Ringer says :—“ I have known it arrest hsematuria in four cases which
had resisted many other remedies. I have found it singularly successful a.nd
prompt in arresting the bleeding from piles, even when excessive and amounting
to half-a-pint a day, repeated almost daily for months or years. It should be
employed as a lotion or injection in piles, as well as taken by the mouth.”
B£EF AND IRON WINE
(BURROUGHS).
A solution of fresh beef-juice (including Peptone) and iron citrate in a pure
medicinal wine. .
This nutrient restorative and stimulant is a powerful blood tonic, and a food
that has been the means of saving many lives in low states of the system, as in
typhoid fever, pneumonia, etc. It is invaluable in anaemia, and to Europeans
in hot or malarial districts it is of the greatest service. The flavour is accept-
able to the most delicate, and is especially liked by children. The preparation
does not injure the teeth, constipate, or in any way disagree, and it is free
from all objections; while the same aliments as it contains, if given separately,
would in many cases cause untoward symptoms. Permanent good effects are
further insured by the presence of beef.

COMPRESSED CHLORATE OF POTASH.
For Affections of the Voice and Throat.
“Chlorate of Potash exercises great influence on mucous membrane.”
ihe Lancet says “Of convenient size ; they are beautifully made : and,
as they dissolve slowly in the mouth, are well suited for throat affections.”
COMPRESSED CHLORATE OF POTASH AND
BORAX “TABLETS.”
Borax is highly recommended by Budd for diphtheria, by Brim ton for cracked
tongue, by Watson for the apthous ulceration which attends advanced stage of
phthisis, while Waring speaks of it as very effectual for hoarseness and clergy-
man s sore throat, and Ringer advises its use in aphonia from over-use of the
SSh and SSSSL* PreSCribe " ta ,h ' Chlorate of
VOICE “TABLOIDS.”
These contain Cocaine, Chlorate of Potash and Borax. Cocaine relieves
irritation and dryness of the throat, restores the tonicity of the vocal chords
and effects a grateful secretion. ’
PEPTONIC “TABLETS.”
. p ep toni c Tablets are a combination of Pepsin and Pancreatic Extract, in con-
J unction wflh the exquisite tonic and alterative : Lime Lacto-Phosphate. They
are highly prized by dyspeptics. ” ■'
COMPRESSED SODA-MINT
(or Neutralising “ Tablets”).
Each Tablet contains Soda Bicarb. 4 grs. ; Ammon. Carb. % gr. ; 01. Menth. Pip. j/6 gtt.
The British Medical Journal says of these Tablets “ They present a
popular and efficacious combination in an agreeable form.”
LANOLINE (Liebreich).
Lanoline is the fat natural to the hair and skin, and is absorbed by these at
once. It is the best basis known for ointments. It is soothing and grateful in

Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition,
1887.
SOUTH
AUSTRALIA.
ANNOUNCEMENT.
Adelaide, March Ist, 1886.
As South Australia will attain its fiftieth year as a colony December 28th, 1886,
a desire has naturally arisen among the colonists to mark that event by some
suitable public demonstration; and no way of gratifying this desire seems so
appropriate or will be so beneficial as that of holding an International Exhibition.
Parliament has dedicated land for the purposes of the Exhibition, and sanctioned
the expenditure of money in erecting the main building and laying out the grounds.
The Exhibition will be conducted by the Promoters, whose names are appended,
and such other gentlemen as they may appoint to assist in the management.
The age of the colony being coeval with the reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty
Queen Victoria, the day for the opening of the Jubilee Exhibition has been fixed
for the 21st June, 1887 (the completion of the fiftieth year of Her Majesty’s reign).
Steps have already been taken for the construction of buildings of an appropriate
character, with a minimum risk of fire ; and these will be erected on the Adelaide
Park Lands, a site which for beauty and convenience can scarcelv be surpassed.
A direct line of railway, seven miles in length, delivering goods on the ground,
will connect the Exhibition Buildings with the wharves at Port Adelaide, alongside
which vessels drawing 22ft. of water may quietly lie and discharge cargo into the
railway trucks.
To ensure success requires the free and full support of other countries ; and it
is hoped that Foreign Nations and British Colonies will co-operate with our Mother
Country, and accept our invitations and be represented at this Jubilee Exhibition


where their productions, manufactures, and machinery may appear in juxtaposition
with Australasian products and manufactures, and prove of mutual benefit.
The Government has appointed an influential and representative Commission in
London to facilitate arrangements of European and American Exhibitors.
The year 1887 will be memorable throughout the British Empire, and will be of
special local interest in these Australian Colonies, from the fact that that year will
witness the union of the Capitals of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales,
and Queensland by a continuous line of railway 1,760 miles in length, viz.:
From Adelaide to Melbourne .. .. .. 508 miles.
“ Melbourne to Sydney 574 “
, “ Sydney to Brisbane .. .. • • 678 “
Total 1.760 miles.
The Import and Export Trade of the Australasian Colonies in 1884 amounted
to a total of £116,249,116, the population being 3,074,508.
The Government will secure free Customs regulations for exhibits, and the due
protection of the interests of all exhibitors.
Diagrams of buildings and grounds, and all other necessary information will be
published and distributed to the various countries and colonies.

Patent Rolled Shafting.—The great ad-
vantage of this Shafting over turned and polished
Shafting, consists in the skin or surface of the
bar, which is the strongest part of the bar, not
being removed, and being compressed and plan-
ished, it has imparted to it a dark blue smooth
appearance. It is
20 per cent, stronger in torsionial strength,
33 per cent, stronger in flexionial strength,
over the same sized bars in the ordinary state.
The shafts are perfectly round and straight,
and are cut to any exact length required, the
ends being faced without any extra charge. It is
made in all sizes from |-round up to 7-round. It
is suitable for line shafting, counter shafts, axles,
and spindles in all kinds of machines.
At the entrance to this exhibit two trophies
are shown. One consisting of Patent Rolled
Shafting, and the other of Bar Iron smithed into
various shapes. In the Patent Shafting Trophy,
four shafts are fitted with brass muff gauges,
which will pass from end to end, thus showing
uniformity of diameter- This shafting is now
being supplied in Steel and Iron, both to the
“Home” and to Foreign Governments; and to
all the large and leading engineering firms, who
are using it extensively for shafts and spindles
in all kinds of machines and agricultural imple-
ments, &c. It is rolled to Whitworth’s Standard
Gauge, and within a margin of one-hundredth
part of an inch, but it can be made to any special
gauges required, within a similar margin, It is
supplied in any lengths, and various examples of
shafts as actually used are shown. This Shaft-
ing has been awarded 21 medals.
The other trophy at the entrance to the exhibit
shows the splendid quality of the Iron manufac-
tured by the Exhibitors, having been worked by
the smith into all manner of shapes, and it will
.be seen that it has stood the most severe tests
■without betraying any flaws. The Exhibitors
manufacture Best Yorkshire Fine-Grained Iron,
and Iron of Staffordshire quality—Best, Best
Best, Best Best Best, and special attention is
called to Shoe Iron, both plain and grooved, and
to Tyre Bars, &c. The Exhibitors roll Steel Bars
up to 7 inches diameter, as well as iron.
Carriage and Buggy Axles, Long Bolt Mails,
American Buggy, Collinges & But Ur’s Patent
Short Bolt Mails. All these Axles are manufac-
tured solely from a specially selected Iron, and
are fagotted and forged entirely out of the solid,
and are more free from seams and flaws than
those made on any other principle. The special
advantage claimed for these Axles over other
manufacturers’, is that all the parts are inter-
changable, so that any part can be replaced at a
moment’s notice, no fitting being lequired.
Coach and Carriage Builders and all large users
derive an incalculable benefit from using axles
manufactured by tbe Exhibitors, as they require
less stock. All wheels fitted with these axles
are guaranteed to be reversible. These axles are
all case-hardened and stamped in full—Kirk-
stall Forge Co., Leeds, “warranted case-
hardened,” with date. Special attention is called
to the “ Butler’s Patent Short Bolt Mail Axle,”
which it is thought meets a requirement that is
generally felt.
Patent Cart Arms, known as “ Kirkstall ” or
“ Drabbles.” These axles are fagotted and
made in the solid, same as the above, and also
guaranteed case-hardened,
Australian Dray Axles. These are manufac-
tured in the same manner as above, and the arms
are steeled They are all fitted with patent
chilled bushes or boxes, which are acknowledged
to be the very best in the market.
Axles which have been in daily use for forty
years have been returned for repairs, which alone
speaks for the very superior quality.

Grenade Fire Extinguishers, and Dick’s
celebrated Extincteurs, “ Fire Queen” and
“ Little Fire Qneen.”
The Harden Star Hand Grenade Fire
Extinguisher; its Principal Characteris-
tics :—The Grenade is simply a blue glass
bottle filled with a combination of chemi-
cals in liquid form These chemicals are
Perfectly harmless to flesh or fabric. This
combination is remarkable, inasmuch as
it will not freeze, even at 30 degrees below
zero; yet ft is very susceptible to heat, and
upon being thrown into fire changes at
once from a liquid to vaporous gases, and
the gases extinguish the fire instantly. For
fire extinguishing powers the combination
used is the most remarkable production of
modern chemistry, the results being
amazing in their instantaneous effects.
The efficiency of this Grenade is not
affected by age. It is sealed by a patent
process. The corks are cut “ across the
grain,” so that the pores do not run up and
down through the cork in the usual way,
but crosswise. The corks are boiled for
several hours in a preparation that closes
the pores and preserves the cork. The
most important feature is In filling the
neck of the bottle above the cork with
a fine plastic cement that hardens to stone,
and seals for ever the contents beyond the
possibility of evaporation or deterioration.
Harden Star Grenades are just strong
enough to stand transportation, and thin
enough to be broken by falling from a
table to the floor.
The Harden Star Grenade is so light and
portable that it can be placed round a
building on every floor, thus saving time,
and placing the means of extinguishing
fire in the iiands of anyone who may be
present.
The Harden Star Hand Grenade Fire
Extinguisher has been the means of saving
thousands of Establishments from destruc-
tion by fire.

Dick’s celebrated Extincteurs, “ Eire
Queen” and “ Little Fire Queen.” —This is
a self-acting Fire Engine for domestic use,
also for Mi ops, Warehouses, and Factories.
It consists of a cylindrical-shaped vessel,
the larger sizes being carried on the back,
and the smaller by the hand; it is filled
with water in which chemicals are placed,
that can be brought in.o contact with each
other instantly on the outbreak of fire, and
produce Carbonic Acid Gas, which is taken
up by the water under pressure. When
the tap is opened, the fluid rushes on the
fire with great force a distance of 30 to 40
feet. Immediately it reaches the fire, the
gas is evolved, and instantaneously extin-
guishes the fire. There is no pumping
necessary, so that any person may use the
Extincteur without fatigue.
The Extincteurs are always ready for
action, so that no time is lost in attacking
a fire after its outbreak. Thousands of
fires have been extinguished by their
means alone. They have been extensively
adopted in Europe and America. They
are perfectly reliable, and neither corrode
uor are they affected by years.
They are harmless to life, health, or pro-
perty.
Facts worth knowing: Over 130,000
Extincteurs have been sold, and over 14.000
Fires extinguished by them alone. Late
Special Reports show that of 704 outbreaks
of Fires in Mills, Ac., 692 were extinguished
by Extincteurs. Actual loss of Property,
£8,869. Approximate value of property
endangered, £8,766,420.

206. Christian, James F., 46, City-road,
London, E.C.—Sole proprietor of Henry
Bond’s original oak-tree marking ink.
This valuable invention of the late
Henry Bond claims a preference over all
others in the freedom with which it can be
used, with or without the application of
heat, and never any fear of injury to the
finest fabric. It is not a mere solution,
but a complete and perfect indelible ink,
remarkable for its fluidity and thorough
unity, showing no tendency to spread or
blot even on the finest fabric.
To obtain this ink it is not sufficient to
ask for Bond‘s ink, as there are many
spurious imitations in the market. The
o-enuine H. Bond’s bears the red trade
mark—an oak tree. Please write or ask
for Bond’s oak-tree marking ink. (See

GiUott, Joseph, & Sons, Victoria Works, Graham-st., Birmingham.—Steel Pens.
TRADE
Y
MARK.
This Exhibit is composed of a selection of :
Ordinary Writing Pens;
Lithographic Pens ;
Drawing Pens ; and
Pierced & Coloured Ornamental Pens.
All these Pens are made of Steel.
Although the last mentioned Pens are orna-
mental only they exhibit some of the most
important processes in the Manufacture of the
Pens of commerce. The beautiful tints observ-
able on some of these Pens are all obtained by
the application of heat simply, no colouring
matter being used. The finishing process of
colouring applied to pens of utility, as well
as the processes of “ piercing” and “grinding,”
are here shown to perfection.
The Firm of Messrs Grillott has been estab-
lished more than half a century, and is made
the object of the following observations by
the author of ‘‘British Manufacturing In-
dustries
“The first great impulse given to the trade-
of Penmaking was due to the late Mr. Joseph
Gillott. At the time Mr. Gillott commenced
operations much of the beautiful machinery
now in use had yet to be invented, and ivas~
afterwards invented and perfected by him-
self. There was no such thing as the‘Slip'
Pen, which now constitutes the staple of the-
trade —the thin piece of metal ‘ raised ’ from
the flat. Mr. Gillott adapted the press to the
making of Pens. He saw that this would
enable him to dispense with most of the slow
and laborious operations of Pen-making; that
it would cut out the‘blanks,’ slit them, bend
the metal, stamp the maker’s name, and thus.

A
by mechanical means, render production at
once rapid and certain. The metnl had to be
repaired by rolling, ‘ pickling.’ and tempering
for the action of the press. Then special dies
had to be made for each size of Pen, and for
each operation of stamping to which the
‘blanks’had to be be submitted. Presses of
improved construction—quick, light, easily
worked, and yet firm enough to strike a
sharp, heavy blow'—had to be made. And
when these difficulties were overcome, there
remained others not less formidable —such as
tempering the metal after it had left the
press; rendering the newly-made Pens flex-
ible, so as to write easily; cleaning and
polishing them without injuring their fine-
ness and coating them with some kind of
varnish, in order to protect them from rust.
This w'as the work Mr. Gillott set himself to
do; and with much ingenuity and unflagging
preserverance he accomplished it. By degrees
the press was adapted to the cutting, slitting,
bending, and marking processes ; machinery
was devised for cleaning and polishing the
Pens; and experiments were made with the
different qualities of Steel, and various ways,
of preparing it for use. At last Mr. Gillott
attained the degree of excellence which has
become inseparably associated with his name;
and the trade ultimately reached the impor-
tance, perfection, and extent which now
characterize it. In this way the Steel Pen,,
unknown a generation since save to the curious,
became a familiar weapon throughout the
world, ‘from the cabinets of Princes to the hut
of the Australian Bushman.’ ”
At the International Exhibition, Paris, 1878,
the Gold Medal was awarded to Messrs. Joseph
Gillott aud Sons for their exhibit of Steel Pens.,

purpose extraordinary facilities are pos-
sessed by the exhibitors in their enormous
bonding warehouses. Here the whisky is

Imparted to it, uniform age secured, and
the mellowness for which it has so long
been known produced.

Glena” for distilling purposes is exclu-
sively enjoyed by the exhibitors, and to
this, in a great measure, is attributed the
fine quality and flavour of their Whisky.

commended by the medical profession in
preference to French brandy.

is held by Messrs. Dunville & Co., Limited,

JOHORE
The State and Territory of Johore is situated at the extremity of the Malay
Peninsula. It includes the province of Moar and several islands in the Straits of
Malacca and off its east coast. It is bounded by the British colony of Malacca and
the native State of Pahang on the north, by the Straits of Malacca on the west, by
the China Sea on the east, and by Salat Yubrow, or the old Straits of Singapore, on
the south, through which the old East India Company’s ships used to pass before
Singapore was established. This flourishing settlement is distant fifteen miles.
An early navigator writing in 1639 describes it as “ Johor ; the utmost point of
the land of the demi-isle, called by the ancients Aurea Chersonesus, reaching to
the Straits of Sinc®pura.”
Its area is about 10,000 square miles, and its population consists of about 50,000
Malays and upwards of 100,000 Chinese, and a few Europeans.
The chief town is Johore Baru, founded by the present enlightened ruler. The
houses are mostly of brick and tile, and contains 5,000 inhabitants. The popula-
tion is steadily increasing. Under the mild but firm Government of the Sultan
peace and prosperity reign. The soil is well adapted for all tropical plants. It
is, like Singapore, a free port.
His Highness has visited Europe three times. On his last visit he assumed his
ancient title of Sultan, which was recognised by Her Majesty the Queen.
Johore being so close to Singapore cannot fail to be a place of great importance
ere long, particularly if the railway so long contemplated is pushed through the
territory. The forests contain vast wealth in timber, and tin is wrought. Gold
has been got on the Malay Peninsula from time immemorial. The late Sir Roderick
Murchison gave it as his opinion that gold and tin would be found in Australia
some time before it actually was found. He believed that the tin and gold-bearing
strata trended from the Malay Peninsula down south to Australia.
The great product of Johore is gambier and black pepper, and it may be remem-
bered that it was in Johore that gutta-percha was first discovered—just at the
moment that such a substance was required for covering the deep-sea telegraph
cables.
Should the railway from Adelaide to Port Darwin be constructed, Singapore and
Johore would be within six days’ steaming.

BRITISH NORTE BORNEO.
This British colony, as it may be called, is the outcome of the labours of some
leading British subjects, who, after considerable expenditure of time and money,
obtained concessions of land from the rulers of the northern portion of the larg e
island of Borneo in 1877, which eventually merged into the British North Borneo
Company, and in 1881 a Eoyal charter was obtained from Her Majesty’s Govern-
ment, conferring extensive corporate powers upon the Company, the Governorship
being intrusted to Mr. W. H. Teacher, formerly Acting-Governor of Labuan and
Consul-General for Borneo, the object of the Company being development of
natural resources by introduction of capital and labour.
The situation is important, both from a commercial and naval standpoint. It
extends from lat. 4° 05' N. to 7° 25' N., and from long. 115° 20' E. to 119° 16',
being about midway between Hongkong and Singapore, and while within 90 miles
of the course taken by traders to China and Japan from the west, steamers trading
from the latter places to Australia pass close to the west coast. Harbours are
fairly abundant, with safe anchorage. A range of mountains runs in a south-
westerly direction throughout the territory, reaching to an altitude of 13,700 feet
in the mountain of Kinabalu. Many streams find their sources in this range,
some of which become fine rivers, the chief of which —Kina Batangan—is navig-
able by steam launches for 200 miles.
The area is about 31,000 miles, two-thirds of which, from its triangular shape,
is surrounded by the sea, giving about 600 miles of coast, which includes all
islands within three leagues.
The population is scanty, large tracts of forest country being uninhabited,
many wandering tribes living in a very primitive fashion, simply hunting and
fishing to provide for their own requirements, without engaging in trade.
The climate, while tropical, is not oppressive, but requires temperance and
regularity, as in all other tropical countries, the inhabitants being particularly sub-
ject to a mild continual fever or febricula, which is easily overcome and of short
•duration.
The temperature ranges from 67-5 to 93 deg. in the shade.
The rainfall has averaged 124-34 inches during the last seven years.


Products.
Sea.—Beche-de-mer, keema, agar, pearls, tortoiseshell, turtle eggs, sharks’ fins,
sponges, oysters.
Forest.—Timber, rattans, birds’ nests, guano, guttapercha, indiarubber, beeswax,
gum dammer, camphor, vegetable tallow.
Swamp Produce. —Mangroves, nipa and nebong palms.
Agriculture. —Although little more than experimental, the following articles-
have been successfully cultivated:—Tobacco, sugar, pepper, gambier, hemp, cocoa,
betel nuts, coffee, kapoc, indiarubber, sago, tapioca, indigo, and fruits.
Trade.— The returns for 1885 show revenue, £22,974; expenditure, £43,348;-
imports, £135,000 ; exports, £83,675.
Minerals. —The following have been found:—Gold, precious stones, quicksilver,
copper, and tin. The first-named is the only one that has been sought after to any
extent, and the country proves to be rich in both alluvial and quartz, but the cli-
mate is somewhat against the advantageous working by white men.
Labour and land are to be obtained cheap, the regulations in connection with the
latter being adapted from the well-known Torrens Act, title being based upon re-
gistration.

NEW SOUTH WALES,
The Mother Colony of the Australias.
Discovered by Captain Cook in the year 1770, and first settled in 1788, New
South Wales will, in a few months, complete her hundreth year of British coloni-
zation, having, during her brief history as a dependency of the Crown, attained a
commanding position in the Austral world.
Shorn of her great southern province—now the colony of Victoria—in 1851, and
of her northern territory—now the colony of Queensland—in 1859, New South
Wales still retains an estimated area of nearly 196,000,000 acres, and possesses a
coast line of 700 miles to the Pacific Ocean.
This coast line is pierced by numerous rivers, many of them navigable for con-
siderable distances, and is indented with splendid harbours, one of which, Port Jack-
son, upon the shores of which Sydney, the capital of the colony stands, occupies
a proud pre-eminence amongst the harbours of the world.
The interior is traversed by many important streams, some of which are water
highways for several hundreds of miles.
Situated in the temperate zone, the climate of New South Wales is healthy and
varied, and almost every description of country exists.
Snow-clad mountains and tropical valleys ; golden grain fields and arid wilder-
nesses ; densest jungle and rugged mountain range ; rich alluvial flats and undu-
lating pastures that stretch away beyond the horizon—all are to be found within
the boundaries of the Queen Colony of the Southern Sea.
And if the natural features of her vast domain are thus varied, so also are her
natural resources.
The mineral wealth of New South Wales is unsurpassed by that of any country
in the world.
Gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, bismuth, antimony, cinnabar, and iron ; precious
stones, coal, shale, alum, marble, slate, granite, and sandstone, all exist in large quan-
tities, and the total value raised up to the end of 1886 amounted to £68,000,000.
The natural pastures of the colony feed vast flocks and herds, which constitute
one of the largest sources of wealth which New South Wales can boast.
She possesses 40,000 more horses than any other of the Australian colonies.
She possesses 80,000 more cattle than any other colony except Queensland.


She possesses 45,000 more pigs than any other colony except Victoria.
She posssesses 27,000,000 more sheep than any other colony, and 10,000,000
more than all the other colonies of Australia combined.
The agricultural products of New South Wales include wheat, maize, barley, oats,
potatoes, tobacco, sugar, wine, and almost all known fruits, for in the varied cli-
mate of this favoured land the hardy vegetation of northern climes, and the
luxurious growth of the tropic zone alike yield a plenteous harvest.
New South Wales is essentially the commercial centre of Australia, the total
value of her import and export trade being £6,500,000 in excess of that of Victoria,
and £15,000,000 more than that of South Australia, Queensland, and Western
Australia combined.
The population of the mother colony, though equalled by that of Victoria
(1,000,000), is about 650,000 above that of any other of the Australias.
New South Wales owns 400 miles more railways; 7,500 miles more telegraph
wires, and has a revenue £1,500,000 larger than that of any of her daughter
colonies.
In no portion of the southern world will capitalist or colonist find sounder oppor-
tunities for investment, or better prospects of health and future opulence than in
New South Wales, the Mother Colony of the Australias.

THE COLONY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Taking for the date of its birth that day on which its first Governor landed and
planted the British flag on the shores at Glenelg, December 28th, 1836, South
Australia completed its fiftieth year on the 28th December, 1886.
South Australia was not the offshoot from another colony. It was a distinct
and independent individual,; not a cutting nor a layer, but with roots and stem
and branches it had its own complete and compactbeing. Besides, it had novelties
in its composition. It was the exponent of a new theory of colonization evolved
by Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Nature gave the land, and the sale of this was to
supply the capital for the introduction of labour necessary to raise the wealth from
it which should provide for its future life.
Li anticipation of the funds to be thus ultimately acquired from land, a
sufficient loan had been authorised by the mother country.
So, at its birth a fresh response was given to the prayer of the great Milton,
who, in 1641, “ implored that that Divine Power which had built up the Britannic
Empire to a glorious and enviable height, with all her daughter islands about her,
would stay us in this felicity;” and an additional illustration was started of
Penn s theoiy (1680), who said “ that colonies are the seeds of nations, begun and
nourished by the care of wise and populous countries.”
In 1802 there was a great want of employment in England, and a not inconse-
quent desire amongst all classes for emigration
In 1838 Coleridge wrote: —“ Colonization is an imperative duty on Great
Britain. God seems to hold out his fingers to us over the sea; but it must be a
colonization of Hope, not, as has happened, of Despair.”
Under these conditions of public opinion and national requirements was it that
authority was sought to establish a new colony in Australia; and, much aided by
the great Duke of Wellington, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1834 for the
founding of South Australia.
The execution of the Act was placed in the charge of a Board of Commissioners,
whose members were Colonel Torrens, P.R.S. (Chairman), George Fife Angas',
Edward Barnard, William Hutt, John George Shaw LePevre, William Alexander
Mackinnon, M.P., Samuel Mills, Jacob Montefiore, George Palmer, and John
Wright, Esquires, with George Barnes, Esq., Treasurer, and Rowland Hill, Esq.
{afterwards Sir Rowland, author of the penny post system), as Secretary.
The Governorship was first offered to but declined by Colonel Charles James
Napier (afterwards Sir Charles), the hero of Scinda. The Surveyor-Genera


appointed was Colonel Light, who had served with distinction under the Duke of
Wellington in the Peninsular War. To him we owe the admirable selection of the
site of Adelaide.
< The colony now possesses a territory ot 914,730 square miles, or nearly one-
third of the so-called continent of Australia. Its northern boundary on the Indian
Seas comprises that section of the coast which first made known to the world the
existence even of Australia. This occurred in the year 1616, when the Dutch
navigator Zeachen sighted the shore, and called it Diemen’s Land, after the then
Dutch Governor-General at Java. That was the most northern portion of our
present Northern Territory.
The southern boundary of South Australia was the latest discovered of all the
shores of Australia. This was the work of Flinders, to whom and at whose
request the British Admiralty had given the command of the ship Investigator for
exploring purposes. This occurred in 1802, shortly after Flinders and Bass had
discovered that Tasmania was not a part of the main land of Australia—but an
island severed from the continent by Bass’s Straits.
Twenty-eight years after Flinders had mapped our southern coasts, Charles
Sturt found the River Murray and followed it down from New South Wales to the
junction of the Darling, and into South Australia—or 1,000 miles —to the sea.
Flinder’s revelations of the coast in 1802-3, and Sturt’s report on the valley of
the River Murray in 1831, constituted the evidence upon which, in the same year
in London, a few gentlemen discussed the propriety of founding a colony in this
part of Australia. In 1834 an Act of the Imperial Parliament authorised the work.
In August, 1836, the first survey party arrived under command of Colonel Light,
with whom were officers who have survived Colonel Light, and are still with us,
namely, the Hon. B. T. Finniss, Mr. Jacobs (of Moorooroo), Mr. Lindsay (of En-
counter Bay). Ships with settlers and immigrants and stores arrived month by
month in succession till, on the 28tb December of the same year, the first Gover-
nor, Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., reached our shores, and, landing on December 28th
at Holdfast Bay, formally took possession of the land in the name of the then
British Sovereign, King William IV.
Inland, South Australia is bounded on the west by Western Australia, and on
the east by Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland.
On this occasion of celebrating the fiftieth year of the colony it will be appro-
priate to publish our debt of gratitude to its “ fathers and founders.” Their work
has ended, and they mostly have passed away ; we remain and reap the fruits of
their labours.
Probably due to the fact that so little was known of the lands of the colony, in-
tending investors were slow to move. Eventual success came through Mr. Geo.
Fife Angas establishing the South Australian Company, whose purchases of land
satisfied all requirements. Later on Mr., afterwards Sir James Hurtle Fisher, be-
came Resident Commissioner to the colony.
The Act authorising the founding of the colony defined certain guiding principles.
Funds for starting the colony were to come from the sales of the land, the revenue
obtained in ordinary ways should pay for its government. The colony was not to


be a charge on the mother country. For this purpose land was to be sold at a suffi-
cient price, and not under £1 per acre. This principle demanded that settlers
should be sufficiently capitalists able to profitably work the land. Three-fourths
of the payments for land was to be invested in bringing our labour, the rest to
roads and bridges. Thus three elements of success were gained—capital, labour,
and means of general traffic.
The settlement was to be regulated in groups in order to secure the advantages of
neighbouring communities. For this end the lands generally were to be surveyed
in small blocks, a standard of 80 acres per section being adopted. The sales were
to be by public auction, so that the evils of large monopolies might be
avoided. Emigration was to be as much as possible by families. In the
opinion of the writer these principles of action were wall attained, as indeed
the occupation of the Adelaide plains under the first surveys to this day bear wit-
ness, in the compact farms and grouped gardens, and frequent townships, and the
network of roads, telegraph wires, mails, post and other conveyances, and advan-
tages of concentrated dwellings, which appear on all sides. And so long as care
was taken not to offer lands for sale until there was a bona fide demand for them,
with a fair chance of healthful competition, no monopoly evil could readily have
arisen. In those days the land fund was kept separately, and was rigidly devoted
to the purposes the Imperial law had assigned to it.
The practice had not till then obtained of looking on the land fund as ordinary
revenue ; nor would that have been a legal appropriation.
But if it be grateful on this occasion to recall to mind the benefits conferred on
us by our “fathers and founders,” it is equally incumbent on us not to overlook
the long list of sturdy settlers, colonists of all professions and classes, officials,
civilians, pastoralists, and farmers, whose intelligence and pluck, energy and perse-
verance, hardy daring and untiring labours, sterling character, and unflinching
bravery have effected that great conquest of a savage laud, growing meat and wool
off hundreds of thousands of square miles recovered from the wilderness, where
forests have been reduced to smiling wheatfields, marshes to garden grounds, hills
to terraced fruit grounds and vineyards, and who have constructed cities and towns,,
harbours and highways, railways and metalled roads, telegraph and telephones, to
so vast an extent, considering the few years and with so limited a population.
Then need we extend our vision outside the circle of those officially, or as mem-
bers of trading corporations, or as settlers whose labours have so greatly and bene-
ficially promoted our growth over our life of fifty years, and now thankfully recognise
that what of the healthy functioning of our social and political life is subject to,
and can be strongly influenced for good or evil by, the imperial agencies acting on
and with our national being, the colony has been second to none in the valuable
services rendered to it by the Governors who have respectively held the high posi-
tion of Her Majesty’s representatives amongst us.
From the hour of our colony’s birth—less the interval of the 174 days between
that event on the 28th December, 1836, and the 20th June, 1837 have
the jbenign influences of Queen Victoria’s eventful and illustrious reign presided,
over our Imperial interests. When, on the 20th June, 1837, Her Majesty ascended
the throne, this colony lay in its wildest state of nature. The kangaroo and emu.


fed over the glades of the Adelaide plains, interspersed amongst the somewhat
dense thickets of wattles, sheaoaks, and lofty gamtrees. Here peace and silence
were undisturbed except by the hunting aborigines, whose coo-eas in the daytime
were heard from the hills, and the doleful cries of howling dingoes at night. Be-
yond the erection of a faw tents of reedy breakwinds, and of wooden ready-made
houses brought with them by the colonists from London, and of a few felled trees
for firewood and other immediate wants, or for the surveyors’ labours, and beyond
the anchoring of a ship off the coast, and the haulage of goods to and on shore, no
impress of a civilised occupation yet marked the founding of a colony. Fifty years
of life have passed, and the colony is what we this day see it, and what the sub-
joined statistics declare it to be. Fifty years of our life have passed under the reign
of our gracious Queen Victoria—Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of
India and the Colonies—whom God yet long preserve, whose Jubilee sovereignty we
now blend with our own.
The increase of population during the year 1886 was, by births 6,943, by immigra-
tion 1,208, making the total number on the 31st of December, 312,739 persons, com-
posed of 164,877 males, and 147,904 females. In 1875 the population was 210.439,
and in 1880 it was 267,573. During the year 1884, 356 foreigners obtained letters
of naturalisation, and thereby became British subjects ; of these 44 were Russians,
136 Germans, 114 Chinese, and the others made up of various nationalities. The
proportion of births per thousand of the population was 35 - 32, the proportion of
marriages 6 - 24 per thousand, and the proportion of deaths 18 - 38 per thousand.
The area of land alienated from the Grown in 1886 was 9,527,760 acres. In 1875
it was little over 6,000,000 acres. The shipment of wool amounted in 1886 to
£1,955,207. The shipment of minerals amounted in 1886 to £684,797. The pro-
duction of wine in 1884 was 473,535 gallons.
The value of imports amounted in 1875 to £4,203,802 ; in 1886 £4,852,750. The
value of exports amounted in 1875 to £4,805,050 ; in 1886, £4,489,000. The pro-
portion of imports from the United Kingdom in 1886 was £1,973,647, the balance
being from other places. The combined import and export trade of the colony was
in 1875, £9,008,851; in 1886, £9,341,758.
The arrivals of shipping were in 1884—British, 768,301 tons; foreign, 141,034
tons ; total, 909,335 tons. The number of vessels belonging to Port Adelaide were
in 1875, steamers, 75, tonnage, 7,443 ; sailing vessels, 212, tonnage, 24,948. In
1886, steamers, 93, tonnage, 12,109; sailing vessels, 220, tonnage, 26,789.

The Atmospheric Refrigerating Co.,
HLXIMIITIEIID,
Have much pleasure in drawing the attention of the General Public
to their
NEW PATENT FOR COOLING ROOMS
And other Confined Spaces. The cheapness of our Machine brings
it within the reach of all, and the simplicity of its mechanism does
away with the necessity of skilled labour to keep it in motion.
To Butchers, Produce Dealers, Hotel Keepers, &c.,
Our Patent Refrigerator will be invaluable, and the enormous waste
of perishable articles of diet during the summer months can now be
reduced to a minimum.
Architects, Builders, and others will find that for ventilating
purposes no invention has ever been patented that can compete with
this for simplicity of coustrution, and efficiency in working.
Model can be seen at the Adelaide Exhibition, or, on application
at the Company’s Works, 120, Flinders Lane West, Melbourne.
