Important Letter
Office of the Railway Commissioners,
Sydney, 18th Feb,, 1898.
Sir, —With reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo, preferring certain
requests in regard to traffic to the South Coast line, I am directed to inform you
that the matter has had consideration, and I am to point out that the Commis-
sioners already give excellent facilities for the business to this line A good daily
service of trains is afforded, and at week ends specially low rates prevail in order
to endeavor to induce excursion traffic to the district ; and the Commissioners
have continued these facilities, although a very heavy loss annually is experienced
in the working of the South Coast line
The Commissioners wili further consider the question of the extension of the
tourist ticket®, and in the meantime will obtain information as to the additional
loss that would be sustained if the concession were granted.
With regard to the exhibition of views on the platforms, and carriages, I am
to point out that this is already observed to a considerable extent —the South
Coast sharing in the exhibition with other districts—and it will be kept in view as
opportunity offers to extend it.
It is regretted that the Commissioners cannot at the present time see their
way to alter the existing rolling stock on the South Coast line.
I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant,
H. M‘LACHLAN,
Secretary.
MR. HUNT, Hon. Sec ,
South Coast Union, Kiama.
