THE PORT OF COFF'S HARBOR
The Port of Goffs Harbor from Mutton Bird Island. Area 237 acres L.W. Nearly one hundred acres thirty feet in depth at low-water. See fuller particulars elsewhere in booklet. Northern breakwater on right shown unfinished is now completed
to Mutton Bird Island, and the Eastern wall is well advanced. When the present authorised works now under construction are completed, the whole area of the Port will be land-locked with the exception of an entrance channel 1000 ft. wide lying
between the Southern Headland (left of photograph) and Mutton Bird Island, nearly half a mile in length, lying to the north (right) of entrance. The Island is not shown above, but begins to run from a point just in front of breakwater, shown on
the right of the photograph. The jetty in the foreground is 1,640 feet long. Two new jetties, each 650 feet long and 80 feet wide, are to be constructed under the lee of the Southern Headland (left). Sir George Buchanan, a world authority on
harbors, stated in Goff’s Harbor on 30th May, 1925, that three or four vessels, 600 feet long, and from 8,000 to 10,000 tons, would be able to berth at these jetties at the same time, when the works now under construction are completed. At the
present rate of progress it will take about six years to complete. It is quite likely, however, that this rate of progress will be greatly expedited.

GUIDE BOOKLET. 1926
FOREWORD.
For years' past the Coif’s Harbor Chamber of Com-
merce has had in mind the issue of a Tourist and Commercial
Guide to the Town and District of Coif’s Harbor. The
ardent desire is at last realised. To Messrs P. <J. Mac-
Namara, C. A. Gillcs, H. M. Henderson and V. F. Bacon,
as a Sub-Committee, was entrusted the onerous task of
collecting, compiling and writing the subject matter that
is now contained in this Booklet.

Mr. Peter Jensen, of Goff’s Harbor, has placed the
Sub-Committee under a deep debt of gratitude for the
untiring zeal he has shown in taking and preparing nearly
all the fine photographs that appear in these pages. A

success of the booklet depended entirely upon their re-
sponse. Our great difficulty has been in the matter of the
letterpress, not in the getting of sufficient information
and articles to make the booklet readable, but in the
sorting out from the super-abundance of excellent material
that has been placed at our disposal, just sufficient, of

trail” through the almost impenetrable forests, eugag
in an epic struggle with'Natufe on her own 1
her strongest fortresses, and who ultimateely
over all. Some of these indomitable spirits are still with
us. Others have passed “within the vale. _
(The settlement actually began its life in 18 )•
things have- been accomplished during the past forty-six
years The giants of the forest have bowed submissively
to the axe-strokes of their master. Hundreds of mil £™
of super, feet of timber have been shipped away from
Coff’s^Harbor by sea and by rail during the years that ar
gone. And now hundreds of beautiful farms fill up the
landscape in every direction, and contribute y
wealth in cattle, dairy products, pigs, maize, fruit
cereals, to the general well-being of the community.
But the dawn of another day is upon us. _ The 1 g t
of a new life is filling our horizons with splendid promise.
Though “East is East, and West is West, and (astronomic-
ally), never the twain shall meet,” we believe that the
Laws of Commerce and Industry,” despite all that Govern-
ments and systems may do to frustrate or defer their
natural trend of activity, must ultimately break throug
all natural and man-made barriers, and work harmoniously
along the pathways marked out by Destiny. .
Ample evidence is given through the pages of this
booklet to prove to the unprejudiced mind, that the Port
of Goff’s Harbor will, within the next few years, become a
First-Class Deep-Sea Port, from which fanwise will radiate
North, South and West, a system of Railways and great
national roads, that will bring the surplus wealth ot an
area of country almost as great as England, to this idea y-
situated Port, for shipment overseas.
To all who have helped in any way with articles,
information, photographs, advertisements and donations to
make the booklet a success, the Sub-Committee tender then
sincerest thanks. ...
Mr Frank Watt, of Goff’s Harbor, is to be heartily
thanked for the fine and comprehensive map of Nortliern
New South Wales, which he has produced for the Booklet
at the Sub-Committee’s request.

COFF’S HARBOR
Goff’s Harbor was discovered by Captain John Korff
in the year 1850. John Korff was of Scandinavian origin,
but was born in London on September 7, 1799. In the Royal
Dockyard at Deptford, he qualified to fill the position of
shipbuilder and marine surveyor, and came to Sydney in
the early thirties. Later he became well-known amongst
all the sailing vessels trading to the Northern ports of
New South Wales, and up to the time of his death, in 1870,
he figured largely in the shipping affairs of the port of
Sydney.
The original name of the Port was “Korff’s” Harbor,
but long ago the name of “Goff’s” was adopted, and now
appears on all maps and official documents.

Goff’s Harbor is situated on the East Coast of Northern
New South Wales, just below the 30th degree of South
Latitude, and near the 153rd degree of East Longitude.
The distance of the Port from Sydney is, by sea, 236
miles, and by rail, 378 miles. The distance from Brisbane,
in Queensland, is by sea, 173 miles, and by rail, 224 miles.
The railway to Brisbane is already constructed to Kyogle,

What Dickens says about the Phoenix!
It will be interesting to the public to note that the
author, Charles Dickens, refers to the Phoenix in the tale
called “The Boardinghouse,” Sketches by Boz.
In it Mrs. Tibbs, the keeper of a London boarding-
house, is described as listening, together with Mr. Everson,
outside a room in which the inmates were apparently
plotting to do something dreadful. After part of the con-
versation going on in the room had been commented on by
Mrs. Tibbs and her companion, the story goes on:
“I know you want money,” continued the voice, which
belonged to Agnes, “and if you’d secure me the five hun-
dred pound, I warrant she would take fire soon enough.”
“What’s that”? inquired Everson again. He could
just hear enough to want to hear more.
“I think she says she’ll set the house on fire,” replied
the affrighted Mrs. Tibbs. “But thank God, I’m insured
in the Phoenix!”

breath of the ocean has often brought new life and

The world’s greatest ocean rolls its white-crested,

pleasure or experience more exhilarating than this!
And these wonderful beaches are equal to the world’s

COFF’S HARBOR AS A TOURIST
RESORT
Many factors combine to make Goff’s Harbor an ideal
Tourist Resort. The geographical position is such as to
make it easy of access, either by rail or sea, from the north
or south. The Sydney-Brisbane trains, because of the easy
grades, and great strength and weight of the railroad, will
be drawn by the most powerful engines in the State at
express speed. Between Newcastle and Brisbane, a distance
of over 500 miles, with the exception of the small townships
of Nambucca Heads, Urunga and Sawtell, Goff’s Harbor
is the only big town at which the railway and the ocean
meet. The railway station at Goff’s Harbor is not much
more than one hundred yards from the surf.

fully equipped dressing sheds are provided for the public,
whilst the several Surf Clubs have their own private

Special trains from Grafton, 53 miles to the North,
Dorrigo, 70 miles to the West, and Kempsey, 65 miles to the
South, bring many hundreds of people to the great surf
carnivals that are occasionally held either at the Harbor

Its wonderful advantages and progress will assuredly
give rapid rise in values to all land suitable for
residential settlement.

With the new railways all leading to this busy

that everyone in the North should own at least one

large.

Beach, or at Park Beach. The warm, shallow lagoons,
formed by the action of the tide, at the mouth of Goff’s
Creek, near Park Beach, are absolutely perfect as bathing
places for timid adults, and for small children.
Under the fine natural shelter provided by the native
trees and shrubs at Park Beach, scores of commodious
tables have been erected for picnickers. A special railway
platform has been constructed by the Railway Commissioners
right at Park Beach, and every Sunday, from September to
Coif’s Harbor Surf Club—March Past Team—Black and Gold.
April, excursion trains bring hundreds of people to these
favored spots.
Park Beach Reserve is under the control of a Board
of Trustees appointed by the Government.
MUTTON BIRD ISLAND : Now connected with the main-
land by the northern breakwater of the Port of Goff’s
Harbor, lies “like a precious stone set in the silver
sea.” Over half a mile from the shore, and about
forty acres in extent, rising steeply from the surf, and
gradually flattening out into a dome-shaped hill oyer
one hundred feet in height, Mutton Bird Island, with
its rich soil, and its thick, grassy, sunbathed, breeze-
swept slopes, is already visited by great numbers of
people, and could, with the expenditure of sufficient
money be converted into a veritable “Coney Island’’
of the Pacific.
Looking westward and landward from this island,
particularly in the late afternoon, a vision of uu

MOTOR TRIPS.
The main roads of Goff’s Harbor and District, which
were once as a. nightmare and a horror to the traveller, have
been greatly improved of recent yeavs. The notorious
Woolgoolga road, running north along the coast from Goff’s
Harbor, is now undergoing a complete transformation, and
will soon be a very popular run for motorists and tourists.
On the road over the range, dividing the sea coast from the
Orara Valley. (Photo, P. A. Jensen).
The district is fortunate in the number of lirst-eluss motor
services it possesses, and it will not be long before regular
daily round trips, and other “runs” will be at the disposal
of the visitor.
MOTOR TRIP NO. 1, OR “THE ROUND TRIP.”
We leave Goff’s Harbor about 9 a.m. and proceed along
the Woolgoolga road for about l-£ miles till we reach the
saddle of a hill overlooking the sea. To the right lies

jutting out about half a mile into the sea. The whole
day could easily be spent here, wandering around the
little bays, coves and beaches, or in fishing off the
rocks.
Proceeding northward we pass through
KORORA AND MOONEE, where there are some nice farms,
and some very fine banana plantations and orange
groves. About six miles out, just above Mr. D. Camp-

a magnificent view of the ocean, beaches, and coastline
can be seen.

is built on pretty undulating hills, which run out to a

farm produce is carried on by means of the coastal

our way for nearly 8 miles to Moonee. We then turn
sharply to the right and leave the coast. After

in the valley of the Orara. Last year a fine up-to-date

good service for twenty years. The cost with new
machinery was about £12,000,

UPPER ORARA : Dairyville, Friday’s Creek and West
Branch, together contain many scores of the richest
dairying and agricultural farms it would be possible
to find anywhere. Two timber mills operate here and
afford much employment. It was into this valley that
some of the earliest pioneers of Goff’s Harbor and
District first came about 45 years ago. “They came;
they saw;’’ but no pen could tell of the almost in-
credible difficulties that had to be overcome, before
they conquered.’’ Some of these heroic men and

We turn quietly away from this now lovely scene

swiftly and almost silently, up the easy grade of the
greatest deviation road ever constructed in these parts,#

of its energetic owner, Mr. 0. C. Sawtell, who has re-

A little township is already growing up on this
beautifully situated, and most conveniently located

the estate, and a platform has been constructed there
by the Railway Commissioners. The business portion
of the new township of Sawtell, which is only half a

COFF'S HARBOR INDUSTRIES
THE TIMBRE INDUSTRY.
The Timber Industry, in conjunction with the Dairying
Industry, has been the great main-stay of the dis-
trict for very many years. In the Dorrigo Shire, of which
Coff’s Harbor is the chief town, there are at present at
least twenty-five timber mills operating, some of these on
the Eastern Dorrigo being amongst the largest in the State
outside of Sydney. Fifteen million super feet of timber

were shipped in 1925 by sea and rail from Coff’s Harbor,
but this would not be nearly all that was cut and sawn,
as great quantities of sawn timber are now shipped direct
by rail from the Eastern Dorrigo through Coff’s Harbor
to Sydney,
The following are the chief millable timbers found in
this district:—
Softwoods : Red Cedar, White Cedar, Mountain Ash,
Beech, Red Bean, and the famous Dorrigo Pine, etc.
Hardwoods : Blackbutt, Mahogany, Tallow-wood, Iron-
bark, Spotted Gum, Grey Gum, Blue Gum, Flooded Gum,

Box, Rosewood, Turpentine, Bloodwood, Oak (for shingles),
etc.
Big shipments of turpentine piles are regularly sent
to Sydney, Interstate, New Zealand and other markets,'
whilst sleeper-getting has developed into a very important
industry.

PASPALUM GRASS.
Mr. William Seccombe, of Coif’s Harbor, with whose
name the world-famous paspalum grass is so closely associ-
ated, writes about its discovery as follows: —
“I landed at Woolgoolga in May, 1899, and proceeded
to Central Bucca, where I selected the property now occu-
pied by H. Mardell. Previous to selecting this, I visited
Mr. Tom Jarrett’s farm at Nana Glen, and saw paspalum
grass growing that was carrying a herd of Ayrshire cows in

full profit. I was so impressed with the rich, green color
and texture of this fodder plant, that immediately I felt
confident of the possibilities of introducing it wherever grass
was grown for dairy cows.
My success in this direction is well known all over the
world to-day, more especially in New Zealand, where every
blade of fodder has to be specially cultivated. Practically
all seed merchants in the Dominion catalogue Scccombe’s
famous hand-shaken paspalum seed. ’ ’
Mr. P. J. MacNamara, who arrived in Coff’s Harbor in
1905, is also very widely known as a trader in paspalum seed,
having gone into the business immediately upon his arrival.
MacNamara’s renowned handshaken pasoalum seed is now
known from Marseilles to -Auckland and from Atherton to
San Francisco, —MacNamara’s handshaken seed is practic-
ally known throughout the world. To give one an idea of
its magnitude he sold in one season seed to the value of
over £7OOO, and is still going strong. During the present
season he sold £l5OO worth of seed to the great advantage
of the local and coast growers.
FUTURE INDUSTRIES.
When the Dorrigo-Guyra-Diverell Railway is ultimately
constructed, and the deep-sea port definitely established at
Goff’s Harbor, many secondary industries must inevitably
be established. For example: Frozen Meat and Packing
Works, Cabinetmaking, Joinery Works, Wood Veneering,
Boat Building, Fruit and Vegetable Canning, Jam, Sauce
and Soap Factories, Tanneries, Boot and Shoe Factories,
Fish Curing, FloUr Mills, Wood Pulp and Paper Mills, Broom
and Brush Factories, Condensed Milk Factories, Paper and
Jute Bags Works, etc.
Timber, Canned Fruits, etc., will be exported direct from
this Port, whilst our overseas requirement will be imported
directly to us, and distributed North, South and West over
a very wide area.
FRUIT GROWING.
Very fine bananas are grown on the sheltered frost-free
hill slopes around Coff’s Harbor on the seaward side of the
coastal range. Some big plantations are now being laid

out, and some of these are already bringing in a consider-
able income to their enterprising growers.
Pineapples, citrus fruits, grapes, plums, paw paws, per-
simmons, passionfruit and many other kinds of fruit grow
well, whilst the Dorrigo Plateau, just at the back of Goff’s
Harbor, has already achieved fame for its apples and pears
and stone fruits, which grow to perfection in this colder
climate.
Tomato growing is develojung into an important indus-
try around Goff’s Harbor, where this delicious fruit can be
grown and ripened nearly all the year round. French
beans are cultivated extensively, and high prices are obtained!
for early tomatoes and beans on the Sydney market.
On the Dorrigo Plateau potatoes are grown equal to any-
thing in the Commonwealth.
There is plenty of land available around Goff’s Harbor
for growing the above fruits and vegetables.

THE DAIRY INDUSTRY.
The Dairying Industry, following on the introduction
of Paspalum Grass and the establishment of Butter and

almost as by magic, the whole aspect of life on the land in

Wales. Where before the farmer, by great toil, won only
a precarious existence from the soil, by the cultivation of
maize, potatoes, sugar cane and other cereals, and by the
rearing of cattle and pigs, which were often “sold for a
song, ’ ’ with the coming of the dairy herd, and the butter
and bacon factories, his income became constant, and was
very greatly increased. This steady income from the farm
stabilised the trade of the business community.
The following figures giving the output of the several
factories in the district, are worth studying: —

It is estimated that considerably more than half the
pigs reared in the Dorrigo and Bellingen Districts are sold
to the Agents cf Proprietary Firms, and sent out of these
districts to be treated. Farmers should support then own
Co-operative Bacon Factories. The price paid for pigs by
the Co-operative Factory, is often higher, than that paid by

THE PORT OF COPE’S HARBOR
WITH
SIR GEORGE BUCHANAN'S OPINION THEREON
The statements in the black, indented paragraphs below,
were the chief points made by Sir George Buchanan, the
eminent British Expert on Ports and Harbors, in his reply
to the deputation from the Chamber of Commerce, which
presented to him the case for Coif’s Harbor, at the Pier
Hotel on Saturday, May 30, 1925.
“I have never seen a place so admirably-
adapted for the making of an artificial port. ’ ’
“Mutton Bird Island is a great natural break-
water. ’ ’
Note. —This island which is nearly half a mile long is
now connected with the mainland by the Northern Break-
water which is 3268 feet in length. The enclosed area of
water resembles a horseshoe in shape.
“Thirty feet of water is now regarded as suffi-
cient to make a first-class port.’’
Note. —The area of Coif’s Harbor at low water is 237
acres, of which at present at least 100 acres has a depth of
30 feet at low water. The tidal rise is 5 feet. The floor of
the harbor is indurated sand, and almost the whole area,
we are told, may be dredged to a depth of 35 feet or even
40 feet if required.
“When the present (authorised) works are com-
pleted, three or four steamers 600 feet in length, and
from 8000 to 10,000 tons, will be able to berth in the
port.’ ’
Note. —Two timber jetties each 650 feet long and 80
feet wide will be constructed under the lee of the southern

headland, which forms’a great natural breakwater nearly a
mile in length on the southern side of the harbor.
“I much prefer 100 tons concrete blocks to be
used in the construction of a breakwater such as
this (the eastern breakwater).”
‘ ‘ This harbor can be made suitable for any ship
ping that can enter the port of Brisbane.’
“Your aspirations for a port are most reason-
able and legitimate.”
What is needed is not so much a great area of
water, as a great area of land behind it.
“Railways must be constructed to connect the
port with the interior.
Note— Cuff’s Harbor is the natural ocean port for an
area of country almost as large as England.
Note _Thc Dorrigo-Guyra railway (89 miles in length)

dredged to 40 feet).
The port is already splendidly protected from the pre-
vailing north-east winds by the northern breakwater, 3268
feet long, and by Mutton Bird Island, nearly half a mile
long. The protection from the south is complete by the
southern headland, extending nearly one mile out from the
inner beach. The very rare, but dangerous, easterly gales
will be guarded against by the strong eastern breakwater
that is now under construction. The port of Coff’s Harbor
should, when completed, in about five years time, be quite
safe for all shipping at all times.

A marine engineer of world-wide experience recently
said: —
“Even the biggest overseas vessels prefer to
caff at the small ports for loading, because the port
dues in these small ports are very much lighter than
in the big ports. ’ ’

1925 was a record year for the timber shipped by sea
and rail from Goff’s Harbor, the total being 15,000,000 super
feet.
Great quantities of sawn timber are now shipped by
rail from the Eastern Dorrigo, where there are about a dozen
big mills, direct to Newcastle and Sydney. This timber be-
fore the through railway connection with Sydney was com-
pleted in December, 1923, was nearly all shipped by boat
from the port of Goff’s Harbor. Great quantities of pro-
duce and general goods are still exported and imported at
the port, notwithstanding the completion of the railway.
THE IRON CHIEF.
Quite recently the steamship iron Chief, belonging to
the Interstate Steamships Co., Ltd. (Scott Fell and Co., Ltd.,
Proprietors), entered the port of Goff’s Harbor to load a
cargo of turpentine piles for South Australia.
The following particulars of the ship were given by
Captain T. J. Wilson Tonnage, 2720 tons; gross carrying
capacity, 3800 tons; length, 290 feet; beam, 43 feet; depth,
22 feet 4 inches; draught 19 feet 0 inches: There
were four feet of water under the ship’s stern after she had
tied up at the Jetty. The ship came into the port at mid-
night, and berthed without any difficulty in the morning.
“When the eastern breakwater is completed you will
have a snug little harbor here,’’ said the captain, to the
“Advocate’s’’ reporter, to whom the above information was
given.
The Iron Chief is one of the biggest boats that has yet
entered the port of Coff’s Harbor.

PARK BEACH RESERVE
(By H. M. Henderson, Goff's Harbor).
A gleaming stretch of golden sand, extending a little
more than a mile, lined with white crested billows of the
heaving Pacific Ocean, a veritable Bathers’ Paradise, and
backed with a fringe of beautiful North Coast scrub, forms
the eastern boundary of Park Beach Reserve.
At the southern end of the beach, the picturesque Goff’s
Creek empties itself into a small estuary, forming a perfect
bathing area for children, and joining the sea over a
miniature bar.
This, together with good level land clothed with beauti-
ful shade trees from the water’s edge, and extending back
to the railway platform, a quarter of a mile distant, in-
adequately describes “The Park,” “a centre gem in the
necklet of North Coast Beaches,” situated within ten
minutes walk of Goff’s Harbor Township.
The Trustees, Messrs W. T. Perry, H. M. Henderson, P.
J. MaeNamara, C. A. Finch, A. L. Walsh, A. J. Fogarty and
C. Booth, have arranged all necessities for a first-class
watering place, including good fresh water, dressing sheds,
sanitary arrangements, refreshment rooms, etc.
Access for vehicular traffic is gained by taking the Coff’s-
Woolgoolga road for one mile to the gate on the right, just
past the overhead Railway Bridge, thence following a sandy,
but trafficable, track for one mile to this favorite camping
ground, and picnic resort. A good footbridge spans the
creek near the Park, and brings it within half a mile of
the town.
No touring motorist should pass Goff’s Harbor with-
out spending a day or two surfing, and fishing, at this
charming place. Special sites are set apart for permanent
cottages.
A very active Surf Club operates on the main Jetty
Beach, where good Club and Public Sheds for ladies and
gents, are erected. Perfect life saving appliances are held
ready for emergencies, which happily are seldom required.
At Park Beach a substantial brick and weatherboard Club
House, fully equipped, has been erected by the Club opera-
ating on that Beach. Regular practice is indulged in by
the members, who form a very active and useful body.

DORRIGO SHIRE
The following figures received from the Government
Statistician (8/7/26) show the remarkable growth of the
Shire’s activities during the past ten years, and should be
closely studied. The figures for 1925 were not available
when the booklet was sent to the publishers.—(Ed.).
x—ln this year the North Coast Railway Construction
Works between Coff’s Harbor and Glenreagh were in full
swing, and were employing about 600 men. With their
wives and children the population at this time would be at
least 1000 above normal.
