!Lcss than 18 months ago the Wertheim Piano Factory was
just an idea, and the four acres of land on which the big pile of
Wertheim buildings now stand just an empty waste, uninteresting
to look upon, rendering no useful service to the State.
To-day the Factory is complete, the men and the machinery
arc in their places, and hundreds of Australian workmen arc
engaged in the work of constructing all-Australian Pianos.
It is merely a matter of weeks now before a supply of
Australian-made Wertheim Pianos is placed on this market.

PREFACE.
The Sixth consecutive Exhibition of Australian Manufactures
.and Products is now presented by the Melbourne Metropolitan
''Committee of the Australian Natives? Association, to all whom it
may concern.
The primary object of the Exhibition is to demonstrate again
the talent and industry of Australians, and give an impetus to the
?Made in Australia Movement,? initiated six years ago.
The great staple industries of the Commonwealth are repre-
sented?agriculture, dairying, mining, forestry, the factories, the
manufacturer, the craftsman, and the inventor. The products
of skill, labour, and ingenuity have been collected and displayed
for thousands to view and critically examine.
It is a grand advertisement for Australian worth, and it
-affords the opportunity for Australians to meet and exchange ideas
in the common interests of the Commonweal.
The farmer will see the latest developments in the implements
of his handicraft.
The miner will observe great possibilities yet in his avocation.
The dairyman will recognise that his industry is ever develop-
ing, and that science is conquering difficulties.
The artisan, the mechanic, the worker, the craftsmen in
will find much to interest them in this embodiment of pro-
.gress.
The manufacturer and merchant, the artist, the commercial
representative, can each gather information, and the citizens, irre-
spective of trade, calling, or avocation, will find a great array of
evidence to satisfy all that their own relations can, if encouraged,
produce in this fair land, everything that they require for their
intelligence and comfort.
It will not be the fault of the Australian Natives? Association
if this display of native talent, skill, and ingenuity does not exceed
in importance and in its results any previous Exhibition. The
.success of these and similar national efforts rests upon the intel-
ligent appreciation and the broad patriotism of every Australian;
both can be exercised in the practical sense by taking a personal
interest in the Display, and inducing a fellow-citizen to visit the

I WALL5 - CEILINCr5 I
Wunderlich Art Metal Walls and Ceilings cost no more than the '
antiquated plaster method, yet the result is better in every way.
Wunderlich Metal is supplied in sheets of convenient sizes. These are
nailed direct to studding or beams ; any handy man can do this.
No water being used, as in the case of plaster, a seasoned house is
i ready in the shortest possible time.
The finished Wunderlich Wall and Ceiling is fire-resisting, vermin-
proof, dust-proof, and will never crack or fall as plaster so often does.
In addition to all these advantages of utility, Wunderlich Metal designs | \
are exceedingly artistic, their decorative effect bestowing an impression
of faultless refinement.
The Owner, Architect, Builder and Occupier are interested in the
economy and betterment of this construction. Write for fuller particulars
and estimates.

AUSTRALIAN NATIVES? ASSOCIATION.
OBJECTS.
In forming the A.N.A., its founders were desirous of
combining the benefits to be derived from a Friendly Benefit
Society with those of a Mutual Improvement Association and a
National Association; and its first object is to instil into
its members the principle of Thrift, and to teach them that
in the days of their Prosperity it is their duty to provide
against the day of adversity, sickness, or death. The
advantages to be derived in this respect from membership
in the A.N.A. are at least equal to those offered by any
other Benefit Society, and members have the additional
advantage of joining a Society composed chiefly of young
men who have been sufficiently self-sacrificing to adopt the
sliding scale of payments, in accordance with the suggestion
of the Government Actuary, and so have placed the Sick
and Funeral Funds of the Association on a firm financial
footing.
As the Association has no formula to observe in carrying
on its business, each Branch, after the transaction of its
routine work, is able to devote a portion of its time to
the mental improvement of its members. We desire to im-
prove each other and to improve ourselves; to increase the
talents that nature has bestowed upon us; and by the
rubbing of mind with mind, to reap from some of our
members the advantages of an education that it has not
been the good fortune of all of us to enjoy.
As a National Association our power is now distinctly
recognised. We do not, and we never will, interfere in
questions of party politics; but in matters affecting Aus-
tralasia as a whole we have claimed to be, and have been
heard in the past, and we will certainly assert a similar
right if ever occasion demands in the future. We are non-
sectarian. We enquire into no man?s religion. We allow
no religious discussion. We have no secret signs. All our
meetings are open to the public.
BENEFITS.
Medical Attendance and Medicines are obtainable im-
mediately after payment of entrance fees. Sick Pay, six
months after entrance, at the rate of �1 per week for the
first six months, ten shillings for second six months, and
five shillings for any succeeding period.
Funeral Donations to Members. ?�20 payable at death
to nearest relative or assign, and �lO on death of wife or
widow if registered.
