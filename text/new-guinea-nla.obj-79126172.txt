OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
Here is a work that every intending emigrant
should invest in. He will ascertain from its con-
tents not only which British colony will best meet
his requirements, but what ho ought to do when he
gets there. The-counsel given by the compiler has
the immense advantage of being eminently practical,
and written in snch simple language that it can be
understood by all. At the same time, a large
amount of very valuable information is compressed
into the 200 pages, including such items as the
average value of different sorts of labour in the
several colonies, the cost of living, the price of land,
the nature of climate, and so on. AYe have had
many guide books for emigrants through our hands,
but, taking it all in all, this is about the best.? The
People, February 17, 1884.
An exceedingly useful handbook for intending
emigrants and all who contemplate seeking their
fortunes in the colonies. It explains what has to be
done before starting, gives many hints that will add
to the comfort of the voyage out, and abounds with
information respecting the climate, products, trade,
wages, and advantages of Australia and New Zea-
land.?Daily Chronicle, February 26, 1884.
This handbook contains much information and
advice likely to be useful to the emigrant at sea, and
upon his arrival in Australia or Now Zealand. He
will find candid accounts of what he may expect in
different parts of these countries.? Lloyd?s News-
paper, February 17, 1884.
A practical volume, full of interesting and useful
details as to the prospects of emigrants to Australia
and New Zealand, supplying them with a brief
history of each colony, an exhaustive description of
the country and its natural features, hints as to the
voyage and the best means of proceeding on arrival
at the ports, and some account of the local institu-
tions and government. A book like this ought to
find a place in every parish library and working-
men's club for purposes of reference.? The Publishers'

Queensland Annexing New Guinea.
(From an Illustration in ?The Australian Settle.
the \v\Kwnov (in;sno\
The question of the annexation by Great Britain
of New Guinea, the New Hebrides, and the
neighbouring Pacific Islands has been regarded with
considerable interest these last few months; and
Lord Derby?s reply to the Agent General on the
subject, stating that the British Government will
not annex or establish a protectorate, and that they
have no justification or necessity for assuming any
responsibility, has given rise to a great amount of
feeling among all parties, more especially in the
Australian Colonies, where the proximity of a great
The Australian Settler.?)
island like New Guinea, and the danger of its being
monopolised by the French as a penal settlement,
cannot be over estimated. The resolution passed
by the French Chambers to send out their prisoners
to the islands of the Pacific, there to undergo their
term of imprisonment with or without hard labour,
after which they will become free men and women,
with the limitation that they must not quit the country
to which they have been relegated, is one evidently
affecting the wel-lbeing and prosperity of our own
great Australian Colonies; and it is no wonder
that they have risen, almost to a man, against the
proposal. The French Government would assist


these prisoners to settle on the land, and will advance
them the means of clearing and cultivating it. If
the islands of the New Hebrides should be taken
possession of by France, and should receive thousands
of outcasts year by year, many being the most
atrocious of criminals, Australia will be confronted
with a peril of great magnitude ; and to avert it,
the annexation question, taken up by Queensland,
should receive a new impulse from the knowledge
we have now acquired of the scope and character
of the Trench law of relegation. Australian opinion
is almost unanimous on this question ; and when it
is seen that upwards of 3,000,000 British subjects
are animated by one spirit, and resolutely bent on
achieving the object they have in view, surely the
Home Government will resort to prompt and
vigorous action. If the question of the annexation
of New Guinea is persistently and rationally
advocated, there is no doubt but that the British
Government will eventually accede; and in the
advocacy of these opinions depend upon it we shall
hear no foolish talk of separating from the grand
Old Mother Country, because the strength of the
Australian Colonies lies in the unity and strength
of the British Empire.
The following are the resolutions agreed upon by
the Australian Colonists, at the Great Convention,
representing all the Colonies, which met on Novem-
ber 28th, 1883: ?
This Convention, representing all the Govern-
ments of the Australian colonies, unanimously
resolves
1. ?That the further acquisition of dominion in
the Pacific, south of the Equator, by any foreign
Power, would be highly detrimental to the safety
and well-being of the British possessions in Austra-
lasia, and injurious to the interests of the Empire.
2. ?That this Convention refrains from suggesting
any action by which effect could best be given of
the foregoing resolution, in the confident belief that
the Imperial Government will promptly adopt the
wisest and most effectual measures for securing tho
safety and contentment of this portion of her
Majesty?s dominions.
3. ?That having regard to the geographical
position of the island of New Guinea, which presents
an opportunity for the extension of British trade
and enterprise, as well as to the certainty that the
island will shortly be the resort of many adventurous
subjects of Great Britain and other nations, and to
the absence or inadequacy of any existing laws for
regulating their relations with the native tribes, this
Convention, while fully recognising tho responsi-
bility of extending the boundaries of tho empire
belonging to the Imperial Government, is emphatici-
ally of opinion that such steps should bo taken as
will most conveniently and effectively secure tho
incorporation of so much of New Guinea and the
small islands adjacent thereto as is not claimed by
the Government of the Netherlands.
4.?That although the understanding arrived at
in 1878 between Great Britain and France, recognis-
ing the independence of the New Hebrides, appears
to preclude this Convention making any recommen-
dation inconsistent with the understanding, the
Convention urges upon her Majesty?s Government
that it is extremely desirable that such understand-
ing should give place to some more definite engage-
ment which shall secure those islands from falling
under foreign dominion. At the same time the
Convention trust that her Majesty?s Government
will avail themselves of any opportunity that may
arise of negotiating with the Trench Government
with tho object of obtaining the control of those
islands in the interest of Australasia.
s.?That the Governments represented at this
Convention undertake to submit and recommend to
their respective Legislatures measures of permanent
appropriation for defraying, in proportion to tho
population, such share of the cost incurred in giving
effect to the foregoing resolutions as her Majesty's
Government, having regard to the relative impor-
tance of Imperial and Australasian interests, may
deem reasonable.
6.?That this Convention protests in the strongest
manner against the declared intention of the
Government of Trance to transport large numbers of
relapsed convicts to the Trench possessions in the
Pacific, and urges her Majesty's Government to use
every means in its power to prevent the adoption of
a course so disastrous to the interests of Australasia
and the Pacific Islands
7. ?That this' Convention expresses the confident
hope that no penal settlement for the reception of
European criminals will long continue to exist in
the Pacific, and invites her Majesty?s Government
to make to the Government of Trance such serious
representations on this subject as may be deemed
expedient.
8. ?That these resolutions bo communicated to the
Eight Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
with the request that they be submitted for her
Majesty?s gracious consideration, and for such
action as her Majesty may think proper to direct,
with a view to giving effect to the earnest desire of
her loyal subjects in Australia.
Signed:?Alex. Stuart, George E. Dibbs, and
Wm. B. Dulley, New South Wales ; H. A. Atkin-
son and Frederick AVhitaker, New Zealand ; S. W.
Griffiths and James T. Garrick, Queensland ; J. C.
Bray and John Downer, South Australia; W. K.
Gibbin and Nicholas J. Brown, Tasmania; James
Service, Graham Berry, and George B. Kerford,
Victoria; and Malcolm Eraser, Western Australia.
Mr. G. W. Desvoeux, Governor of the Fiji Islands,
represented that colony at the Convention. While
expressing, individually, his general concurrence
with the resolutions, his Excellency considered him-
self precluded by his position from voting. The
Convention is now discussing the constitutions and
functions of a Federal Council to deal with the
common interest of the Australian colonies. It is
expected that a complete agreement will be arrived at.
It will be thus seen that the annexation of New
Guinea by the Australian colonies has now entered
upon a new phase. When the Government of
Queensland took the bold step of sending a police-
man to assume possession of New Guinea in the
name of tho Queen, it was hardly realised what im-
portant consequences might follow from such a pro-
ceeding. That the Home Government should have
a word to say upon the subject was felt to be natural,
and no surprise was caused here at home when the
Colonial Secretary stated that the Ministry were not
prepared to sanction such a movement; but it was
quite clear from the outset that the last word had
not been said on the subject. There were three
parties whom it was reasonable to suppose would
like to have a voice in the matter; namely, the
Australian Colonists, the Imperial Government, and,
lastly, the Natives of New Guinea themselves. Tor
the moment the last-named are left out of the dis-
cussion, though it is possible they may take a very
troublesome part in it before it is ended. But the
Australians have been, and are, very much in earnest
about it; although the first dispatch of the Colonial


, ' ' ? - - " ? -- ' -V - '

Secretary seemed fairly decisive, the colonists were
not satisfied with it, and the Government of Vic-
toria, acting on behalf of the Australian colonies,
requested Lord Derby to state more fully the views
of the Home Government in regard to annexation in
flic Western Pacific. Firstty, they asked to be in-
formed of ? the general conditions ? on which annexa-
tion would bo assented to ? They also wished to
know whether, if the Australian colonies were to
become confederated, the annexation would be
allowed; or whether, if they agreed to provide the
cost, it would be permitted ? Throughout the
whole of the discussion the question of cost is made
very prominent. There is no doubt but that in
principle the Australians are right, but the expense
is likely to give them some little trouble.
The Australians have taken the fullest advantage
of Lord Derby?s invitation ; they have not submitted
a scheme of annexation ; the responsibility of doing
so they throw upon the Government at home. They
declare that all the Pacific Islands soutn of the
equator belong to Australasia, and that their acqui-
sition by any foreign power would be injurious to
the safety of the British possessions in Australia,
and the interests of the British Empire. But the
Convention go further than this; they recommend
that steps should at once be taken to secure the
incorporation of so much of New Guinea and the
adjacent islands as is not claimed by the Government
of the Netherlands. Moreover, they wish to abro-
gate the agreement between England and France,
which recognises the independence of the New
Hebrides, and to substitute for it ? some more
definite engagement which shall secure those islands
from falling under any foreign dominion.? They
urge the Government to take an opportunity of
negociating with France, with the object of obtain-
ing the control of those islands in the interests of
Australia. They are willing to bear a portion of the
expenses, and to introduce into the Colonial Legis-
latures measures for defraying such share of the
cost as may be deemed reasonable.
The Convention also protests strongly against the
intention of the French Government to transport
large numbers of criminals into the French pos-
sessions in the Pacific, and expresses the hope that
no penal settlement for European criminals will long
exist in that ocean.
Such are the resolutions passed by the convention
of the various Colonies of Australia and New Zealand.
It would be hard to say that they are unreasonable,
but we must remember that the Home Government
have many considerations to take into account. The
question is now a National as well as a Colonial one,
and as such is much more important than the simple
question of the annexation of New Guinea. We
must remember that the Native Paces must not
be overlooked. As will be stated in this pamphlet,
they are not wholly uncivilized; they are not
nomadic tribes, without rights and interests in the
soil, and we do not wish to have on our hands the
cost and the guilt of a native war of subjugation.
The whole question must be approached in a spirit
at once just, courteous, and gentle; and on terms
which will be equally for the advantage of the
native inhabitants as for that of the Colonists.
View of Mission Station, Port Moresby, New Guinea.
Or Papua, is separated from Cape York, the most
north-easterly point of Australia, by a shallow
strait, not more than ninety miles wide, discovered
by Torres in 1000. Excepting Australia, New Guinea
is the largest island in the world, surpassing \\\ size
Borneo. Its superficial area covers a quarter of
million square miles, and it is therefore larger than
France. Its extreme length, from N.W to S.E.,
lying between 130*50deg. and loldeg. E. longitude,
is about 1,500 miles; its greatest width extending
between a latitude twenty miles. S? of the equator.


and 10-40deg. S. is 400 miles, while at one point at
Geolvink Bay, it is only twenty miles wide. The
first discovery of the island is claimed both by the
Portuguese and Spaniards; it is, however, certain
that the Portuguese Commanders, Antonio Abreu,
and Prancisco Serram, sighted its coast about the
year 1511. The next record is that of Don Jorge de
Mcneses, the Portuguese governor of Tenate, who
was driven by contrary winds and currents upon its
shores in 1526; and it was not until two years later
that the Spanish Captain Alvaro de Saavedra,
returning to Mexico from the Moluccas, coasted for
a month along the north of New Guinea, where he
?cast anchor in a great gulf near certain islands,
which he called the Islas del Oro, supposing
them to contain gold. The next account we have
of Now Guinea is given by survivors of an expedition
dispatched from Peru, under Gonzalvo and Alvarado
in 1537, the former of whom was killed in a mutiny,
while the latter was obliged to abandon his ship
owing to its crazy condition, and landed with some
sailors at Papua, where those, who did not die of hunger
were rescued by Antonio Galvano, and eventually
arrived at the Moluccas. They reported;?? The
people on all these lands are black, and have their
hair frizzled, whom ?the people of the Moluccas do
Papuans.
call Papuas.? The term Papua is a corruption of
the Malay words yma pun, signifying curly or woolly,
and was first applied to the inhabitants on account
of their hair.
IMscovery.
In 1540, the Spanish navigator Ynigo Ortez de
Eetes, sailed in the ship ?San Juan,? along the
northern coast of the island, and believing it to be
newly discovered land, he called it Nueva Guinea,
from the supposed resemblance of its inhabitants to
those on the African Guinea coast. In 1616
Schouten sighted the N. E. coast of New Guinea ;
and, in 1643 the famous Portuguese navigator,
Tasman, visited the N. coast. The Dutch traveller
Keyts mentions New Guinea in 1678, but Luis
Vaes de Torres, the Spanish navigator, had sailed
between New Guinea and Australia seventy-two
years before; and when in 1762, Manilla was taken
by the British, and Dalrymple found Torres? letter
to the King of Spain describing his discoveries, the
Straits were named after him. In the year 1700
our own countryman Dampier saw the coast, and
sailed between it and New Britain, and the Straits
were named after him. It was not, however, until
1770, that Captain Cook first surveyed the passage
through Torres Straits, in his ship the ? Endeavour,?
but on account of the hostility of the natives he did
did not land. In 1774 Thomas Forrest, an English
officer, was sent by the East India Company to see
if spices were to be found in the possessions claimed


by the Dutch, and he landed at Dorey to the
N.W. of New Guinea, in the ship ? Tartar Galley.?
About the year 1824 the French naturalist Lesson
visited New Guinea in the ship ? Coquille,? but
only remained a few days ; and in 1820 Lieutenant
Kolff, a Dutch surveyor, took some observations
along?the S.W. coast; two years later the Nether-
lands Government built a fort, called Du Bus, in
Triton?s Bay, which, however, was shortly afterwards
abandoned on account of the climate. In 1844
Captain Blackwood, in H.M.B. ?Fly,? made a
survey in the neighbourhood of the Papuan Gulf ;
and in 1840 Lieutenant Yule, in 11.M.5. ? Bramble,?
continued the survey to a point whence he
saw the lofty mountain which now bears
his name. Two years later, in 1848, Captain
Owen Stanley,inH.M.S.? Rattlesnake,??accompanied
by the ? Bramble,? commenced a four months?
survey of the S.E. peninsula, and the great
Mount Owen Stanley range, the highest point of
which is 13,205 feet above the sea, was named
after him. In 1858, a knowledge of the S.W.
and N. coasts up to 141 deg. E. longitude, was ob-
tained through the Scientific Commission sent out
by the Netherlands Government; and in 1873, Cap-
tain Moresby, in 11.M.5. ? Basilisk,? surveyed about
275 miles of the S.E. coast. The first white man
that ever resided in New Guinea is Mr. Alfred
Russell Wallace, who in 1858 spent about three
months at Dorey, where he found several new species
of birds of paradise ; his work, entitled ? The Malay
Archipelago,? gives much information respecting
that part of the country, and the adjoining East
Indian Islands. Of the foreigners who have resided
in the country may be mentioned Miklukho Maklay,
from Russia, who in 1871 landed in Astrolabe Bay;
the Italian naturalists, D?Albertis and Beccari, who
in 1872 explored the neighbourhood of Dorey; Dr.
A. B. Meyer, from Germany, who explored the
whole coast of Geelvink Bay and its islands in
1873 ; and lastly, Dr. James, from America, who,
with a Swede named Karl Thorngrcn, was murdered
by the natives on the mainland, opposite Yule
Island, so late as 187 G.
From Queensland to Australia.
Starting from Somerset, almost the extreme
northern point of the great Australian continent,
and steering due north across Torres Straits, is found
a low flat country, called by the natives Dandai.
This is not New Guinea proper, which is, however,
only divided from Australia by a channel about 80
miles wide. The depth of this channel, separating
the two largest countries of Oceania, is not above
twelve fathoms. At distances of exactly three miles
from each other there rise up in these straits small
mountainous islands, which seem like the links of a
chain once connecting Australia with New Guinea.
Torres Straits are peopled with coral insects, which,
with slow but constant labour, create new and ever
changing lands; and we may at some period, not so
very far distant, expect to see the gradual filling up
of this narrow channel, and the re-union of these
two immense islands. The river Fly is the largest in
the island, and rises in its centre. Its source is in
the high mountains that cross New Guinea from
west to east, latitude sdeg. south, and longitude
142deg. east of Greenwich. It winds between low
hills, gradually increasing in height towards the
north, and discharges itself into the sea in latitude
B*4sdeg. south, and longitude 44deg. The mouths
of the Fly form a wide delta, and an archipelago of
islands, all flat. The principal among them is
Kiwai Island, at the river mouth ; this is very
densely populated. All these islands are clothed
with rich forest, and abound in gigantic trees,
especially a species of myristica, the canarium, the
sago, the mango, the banana, &c., besides many
garden plants under cultivation. The river shore is
overgrown with ? nipa.? Rhizophora, or mangroves,
are few, and are met with at the mouth of the river.
According to the natives there is no fresh water in
any of these islands; in the dry season, therefore,
when the waters become brackish, the inhabitants
are obliged to depend upon cocoanut milk. The
soil of these islands is muddy, of a bluish colour,
and evidently sedimentary. In the sand are to be
found indications of gold and loadstone. The land
of New Guinea is undoubtedly fertile, but it presents
difficulties for its successful cultivation by
Europeans, without calling in the aid of coloured
labour. The low, damp, marshy plains, watered by
the Fly, are particularly ill-adapted for colonization
by white men, but on the mountains success is
much more certain. What is wanted is the help of
native labour, in order that the white man may
profit by the riches of the country. At Kapaor, the
natives occupy themselves during a great part of the
year in collecting nutmegs, massoi, the skins of birds
of paradise, tortoise shells, and mother of pearl,
which they afterwards exchange with the Bourghis
traders, who visit their coasts every year. What is
wanted in this part of the island is agricultural
pioneers who would teach the natives to cultivate
the earth by means of machinery, to sow and to reap
at the proper seasons, and to preserve those produc-
tions of the earth, which they could bring to a sure
market. Rice, cotton, tobacco, coffee., muscatel
nuts, &c., would very soon repay the first cost; and
cinnamon, ebony, sandal wood, resin, and muscatel
nuts, would, in this way soon become articles of most
lucrative exportation. The heavy rains during the
months of December, January, February, March,
and April, may render the ascent of the river some-
what difficult and dangerous ; but, during the other
months of the year, navigation is extremely easy,
and the centre of the island could easily be attained.
In the dry season the heat is not excessive, the
maximum heat at night during May, June, July,
and August is, perhaps, 86 deg., while in September,
October, and November it is about 90deg.; July
and August are the driest months.
In October and November the rains, although fre-
quent, are not continuous, and the sky is quickly
clouded over, and as quickly becomes clear again.
At the mouth of this river the population is
extremely numerous ; then over a large tract of land
none are to be found ; but natives are found again in
immense numbers when the country becomes hilly.
The inhabitants do not live near the river, but come
down to it only during the dry season, in pursuit of
game from the mountains. The people round about
the district of the Fly river are more barbarous and
savage than any others inhabiting this great island.
The race to which they belong is not known, but it
is certain that many races here have come in con-
tact, and they are more or less mixed. The weapons
of the tribes on the Fly are principally the bow and
arrow, and stone clubs, some of which are very won-
derfully carved. In the interior of the island espe-
cially, the weapons, whether of stone, wood, or bone,
are rich and elaborate in carved work. It is a matter
of much surprise that the people of the interior are
further advanced towards civilization than those
dwelling near to the sea. Here we find the natives
using cloths, finely hand-woven of bark fibre; cement


New Guinea,
is used to fasten together the parts of their arrows,
and also various kinds of varnish, showing a great
advance on those people who only use red or yellow
earth, lime, or charcoal, to colour and adorn their
ornamental work. Every native knows the use of
tobacco, but those living near the sea do not culti-
vate the plant; it is, however, grown in the interior,
and probably forms an article of exchange between
the inland tribes and those of the coast. It is highly
probable that it is exchanged for sea shells, with
which the natives of the interior are in the habit of
adorning themselves
Hunting and fishing are the principal pursuits of
all the river-side people; but the natives do not neg-
lect the cultivation of the earth, and they possess
large plantations of bananas, taro, and yams, and
near the sea coast cocoa is very abundant.
Sago abounds in the forests, and is greatly used
by the natives. The inhabitants of Kiwai Island are
very skilful in the construction of canoes, which
they sell at Moatta and in the islands of Torres
Straits. The country inhabited by the people of
Moatta is flat and fertile, and for the most part is
under cultivation by the natives. The forests,
destroyed by the hand of men, have given place to
vast plains covered with wild grasses, or converted
into cultivated gardens. There is no doubt that,
when New Guinea is colonised, Moatta will, from its
situation, rise from a miserable village into a large
city, whence the exportation of products from the
interior will take place.
Australia being so near, it will be very easy to
disembark horses; and an immense advantage is,
that the natives are not only friendly to white men,
but already understand and speak a little English.
The fertility of the soil of this great country, its
vast plains and its abundant water, offer facilities
for the greatest results if the right means are taken
at the beginning. One of the surest means of suc-
cess is association with the natives, since the climate
must always, or, at any rate, for a long time, be
inimical to white men. Although the inhabitants
of Moatta are neither more nor less than savages,
yet there is not the slightest doubt but that they
would quickly fulfil the hopes of anyone who would
lead them into civilization.
Towards the north and cast the country becomes
mountainous, and overgrown with dense forests.
The base of the hills are washed by the sea, and be-
hind these hills rise other and higher mountains, all
clothed with rich vegetation. A chain of hills,
rising in succession towards the east, encloses a bay
which would make a safe harbour. It is protected
from the N.W. winds by the islands of Faor and
Karas, and from the S.E. monsoon by the mountains
of Cape Sapei, or ? Tangion Bair,? as they are
called by the natives. Journeying northwards the
coast continues fragmentary, and, as it were, notched.
There are frequent bays and creeks formed by the
jutting out of the hills into the sea. The chain
mentioned reaches to the extreme point of a penin-
sula, which is called by the natives ? Papua Onin,?
and forms a head-land at Hati-Hati, the principal
village of the Onin.
Maitoar
is another good harbour. It is interesting on
account of the trade carried on between the natives
and the Bourghis merchants, who come from
Macassar after muscatel nuts, birds of paradise, and
the highly prized bark of the massoi. At Cape Sele,
or ?English Point.? the hills come quiet down to the
sea, clothed to the waters edge with tropical yegeta-
tion. The broken line of hills reaches to the
extreme eastern limit of the peninsula formed by
the Gulf of MaeClure and Geelvink Bay. The
mountains, twining abruptly to the north, become
gigantic, and
llimnl Arfak,
lord of them all, towers 9,000 ft. above the level of
the sea. Yet the aspect of the country is not greatly
changed ; it is always one mass of vegetation.
From Sorong to Dorey, a coast line of 200 miles,
there is not one river deserving the name. The
nature of the hills and mountains allows only of
small streams, which convey the rainfall to the sea.
Although this portion of New Guinea has hitherto
attracted the greater number of travellers, and for
more than twenty years several Dutch missionaries
have lived here, yet the interior is the least known.
Signors D?Albertis and Becoari are as yet the only
Europeans who have ventured into the interior at
all, and they have not explored it. The northern
peninsula of New Guinea may therefore be regarded
as a virgin country.
Of the Geology of this part of the great island,
nothing is known with any certainty. A large part
of the western side seems to bo of calcareous forma-
tion, while the eastern side is volcanic.
Climate.
If the geographical position of the country be borne
in mind, but little need be said. The country lies
within a few degrees from the Equator, and it is
therefore needless to say that the heat is great.
The rainfall is frequent and very heavy, and the
evaporation is therefore considerable. On the high
mountains the climate is naturally more template,
and here the rains are far more frequent than on
the sea coast. Thick clouds often envelop every-
thing for many hours of the day?sometimes all the
day long?not very uncommon occurrences any-
where. The fevers common in tropical countries
are rife in New Guinea. A traveller coming from
a non-torrid zone may be almost certain he will not
escape fever ; but, there is no doubt that anyone?
even a European?could become acclimatised. The
Dutch missionaries number many martyrs among
them, who have sacrificed their lives to bring the
light of the Gospel among these people; but there are
others who are living and in good health.
THE IXH.IBITAXT3.
Much has been, and is being said, concerning the
Papuan race, and perhaps of late years no other
race has been equally interesting to students, and
the solution of the problem seems as far off as over.

fancies. One traveller will declare that the Papuans
are all ugly, unintelligent and ferocious; another,
on the contrary, will declare that they are handsome,
intelligent, and equal to the white man. At Faor
Island, Signor D?Albertis, in 1873, met for the first
time with a people said to be Papuans ; but, he also
found among them some Malays, and a mixture of
the two races. From Faor he- went to Kapaor;
along the coast he found that many Papuans had
embraced Islamism, and that there are missionaries
of that religion there. These natives he found
engaged in trade with the Malay population, and


appeared to have made good progress in civilization,
using our cloths, iron, and silver, and also firearms.
D?Albertis noticed not only a great variety of type
amongst these people, but the colouring also varies
very much ; the hair is more or less crisp, without,
however, being woolly. He met with people who
told him they came from the interior, and came
down to the coast at the trading season only, among
whom he noticed a very great variety of type;
some of
The Natives
had flattened noses, while others had aquiline noses.
He remarked hero that the natives sometimes file
their teeth; this he had not observed in the other
parts of the country. They also practise a kind of
tattooing, produced by making an incision in the
skin, and then irritating it with lime and soot. As
to their habits, he says ? that they are hunters of
human heads ; that they have superstitions, but not
idols; and that they hold the fig tree sacred, on
which account he was hindered from shooting a bird,
which perched on one near his house.? They
practise ? tabu,? more or less, and, in his walks he
noticed many houses where a stick was sufficient to
prevent any one from entering during the absence
of the owner. Near some of the houses he saw the
sugar cane and the banana in cultivation, and also
grain and beans, probably imported by the Malays;
in addition to these a little tobacco is grown.
The Men
are handsomely adorned either with feathers, or
with braclets and necklaces of shells. They also
wear earrings and bracelets of silver, and other
metals. They use iron weapons, wooden lances
pointed with cassowary bone, and bows and arrows.
No less than five dialects are spoken along the
coast between Onin and Tangion Bair. In the
Pitt Straits D?Albertis met with some Aborigines
from B.ittanta Island. lie describes them as a fine
Native Papuans of New Guinea
people, well formed, and very strong and active,
somewhat inclined to be fat. Their hair is crisp,
their foreheads high, and their eyes large and bright;
the nose is rather flat; the mouth regular, and the
lips rather projecting. The colour of the skin is
dark brown. The island of Sorong, although small,
may be called a colony; the inhabitants being chiefly
Malays, or of Malay origin. It also contains many
slaves from different points on the neighbouring
Sew Guinea Coast,
and the coasts of other islands. Besides these
there is a small colony of people called Mafor, who
x-eside in a small village; and come from an island
to the East of Dorey. They are distinguished from
the others by greater height, darker colouring,
slightness of figure, and an aquiline nose. In
character they are bolder and more enterprising than
the other tribes. These also practice
tattooing; they are given to travelling, and tattoo
an additional figure above the right breast on the
accomplishment of every fresh journey. They use
bows and arrows, and spears. They carve deers?
horns very skilfully, and convert them into beautiful
knife handles. In their houses they have wooden
idols carved by themselves, and which they call
? Karuari.? They do not, however, prize these
much, and sell them very willingly.
A Native Village.
At Eamoi, a little village on the Coast of New
Guinea, are to be found a small population,
approaching very near to pure Papuan blood. These
people are very dark in colour, of low stature, with
woolly hair, small eyes, and flattened noses. They
appear to he about the poorest and most miserable


people in the world. D'Albcrtis stayed there a
fortnight, and never saw one of them laugh. They
cultivate the earth, and hunt with the bow and spear,
followed by numbers of dogs. They wear wooden
amulets on their necks, wrapped in a piece of cloth ;
they believe in witchcraft, and in the evil eye, and
have a sacred place not far from the village, which
DAlbertis was never able to penetrate. They bury
their dead in the forest. On a grave this traveller
noticed a broken jar, and he asked a child, who was
acting as his guide, what was inside the grave ; the
child replied ? a man.? He asked him what he was
doing under the earth ; the boy answered, that he
was sleeping, then blowing on his hands he lifted
them up, at the same time raising his eyes towards
the heavens.
Their SBonses
are built on piles. The women, however, dwell
in common in one large house, to which the
ground itself serves as flooring. At Sorong almost
all the houses are not only built on piles, but also
partly in the water. The houses of Mafor are built
entirely in the water, so that a little bridge is neces-
sary to enter them from the shore. At Sorong the
inhabitants live principally on fish, sago, bananas,
sweet potatoes, and cocoa-nuts ; pineapples are also
cultivated by them.
The Malay population is clothed ; the remaining
portion, on the contrary, only cover certain parts of
the body.
At Audai are to be found
The Arfaks,
who take their name from the mountain they
inhabit. They are said to be a ferocious people, and
are almost always at war with their neighbours;
since, however, the Dutch missionaries have settled
in the place the people have become more and more
tractable. They are a fine race, tall of stature, and
very strong. Their hair is exceedingly thick, black,
and woolly, but so covered with grease that its real
colour cannot bo seen. D?Albertis says ho occa-
sionally mot with men in this district who had thick,
though not long beards, and their bodies covered all
over with hair, this body hair having a reddish tint.
Thei" skin is very dark, almost black. The Arfaks
live 'n small villages, in houses built on piles ; they
use bark to cover the framework of the house, and
for its interior divisions. Men and women live in
the same house, the women one side and the men on
the other; they cat apart. Two small rooms are
reserved at the two ends of the house, perhaps for
the father and mother of the family, and are pro-
tected from inquisitive eyes. A small house, sepa-
rate from the others, is reserved for women in
childbirth, and this the men may not enter. Th 6
dead are buried before the door of the abode in
which they have dwelt during life, and at intervals
of two days a fresh supply of food and tobacco is
placed on the grave. On the death of the head of a
family, the house and plantation that belonged to
him are forsaken two or three months after his
death, and the survivors build a now house higher
up on the mountain.
Their Customs.
The people are polygamous, and obtain their
wives by purchase; aged men have often, as in
Europe, very young wives. The Arfaks live by
hunting, and also on the fruits of the earth, cultivat-
ing bananas and yams ; they also grow and smoke
tobacco. They do* not use salt properly so-called,
hut they collect a certain kind of salt on the beach.
which they procure from the ashes of a plant. They
talk willingly, but are not noisy, and have a some-
what melancholy expression. They are hunters of
human heads, and preserve the heads as trophies;
the chiefs have a right to the heals of the slain. If
only one head is obtained in battle, it is cut in
pieces, and divided among the chiefs.
Keliglon.
They are fond of ornament, and use flowers for
that purpose. They do not seem to have any
religious persuasion, but they believe in a spirit of
evil, and endeavour to exorcise it by cries and signs.
After a fashion they believe in the immortality of
the soul; this may bo inferred from their custom of
supplying the graves of the departed with pro-
visions.
At Battulei and Comul, at the extreme north
point of Arru, are found a population of another
special
lira:it*h Of the Papuan Family.
Here the men?s figures are slight, elegant, and well
proportioned in every limb. Their features are
regular, and recall the Arab cast of face. Their
skin is less dark than the other races; their hair not
so crisp, often hanging in long ringlets, and their
features are less harsh. Their habits are different,
and their houses are not built in the same way.
They carry on a trade in mother-of-pearl, tripang,
swallow?s nests, and birds of paradise. Morally and
physically they may be considered as far superior to
the other tribes of Papuans; they are intelligent
and industrious, and on the way to something not
very unlike our own civilisation. At
Oiangri'ic 38ay.
at the extreme limit of south-eastern New Guinea,
is to be found another mixed tribe. The colour of
this people is lighter than any of the other races to
be seen. Their hair is not woolly, but crisp. They
are small in stature, the head is round, and the
features regular. All their instruments are made of
stone, or bane, or wood; they know of iron by the
name of ? dim-dim,? but they possess none. The
women here are all tattooed, and adorn themselves
with human bones, which is not the custom with
any other Papuan women. Their weapons are
spears and stone nails.
VI I.K RSB.VVBB
presents the appearance of a narrow tongue of land
about four miles in length, divided from the coast
of New Guinea on the south-east by a channel about
two and a half miles in width. On the east and
north it is separated from the mainland by Hall
Bay, which is from three to five miles wide. This
island consists of two small chains of hills, which
run along its, entire length, and look as if, at one
time, they had been a continuation of the chain,
which, at the present day, ends in Cape Suckling,
at the east end of New Guinea. The height of these
hills varies from 500 to 750 ft.; for the most part
they are covered with beautiful vegetation, although
here and there are tracts of long grass only. Look-
ing towards the north, the sharp peak of
Mount Yule
can be distinguished at thirty miles inland. It
towers proudly above the mountain chain, which,
starting from it, stretches away east until it reaches
the
Stanley ISange,
the highest peak of which, called Mount Owen
Stanley, can be seen on every clear day. The


height of this mountain is said to bo 13,200 ft. above
the level of the sea. In order to avoid the coral
banks at the entrance of Hall Bay, the ship must
be kept in the middle of the south Channel, and,
if anchored to the north of the island, will be
sheltered from every wind. There is no doubt that
when New Guinea is colonized,
Mall Sound
will become not only a first-class harbour for trade,
but also of strategical importance. The hills are
admirably adapted as a site for fortifications to
protect the island from attack, and, if the hills on the
mainland at the extreme point were also fortified,
the cross fire from the batteries would render the
passage of an enemy?s ship impossible.
The soil of Yule Island is calcareous, with a
volcanic base. Several springs of excellent fro dt
water yield, even daring the months of the dry
season, a sufficient supply for the natives. During
the rains, water is almost too abundant. In
consequence of the dry nature of the soil, and the
steep declivities which let the water run off, there
are no marshes ; and to this may, in a great measure
be attributed the fact, that Yule Island is one of
the healthiest spots in New Guinea. To anyone
accustomed to the heat of the tropics,
Its Cihnate
would appear temperate. Tor about eight months
in the year a moderately fresh wind blows from the
south-east, while in the hot season the north wind
brings refreshing coolness from the neighbourhood
of the high mountains.
The medium temperature is about 85deg.
Fahrenheit in the cooler season, and DOdeg. in the
hot season; during the night the medium temperature
may be reckoned at T4deg. Fahrenheit.
The rainy mouths are November, December, and
The Dobing a
January. In March there are about ten days' rain;
in April seven, in May and June one or two heavy
showers.
At the end of July there are a few days of fine
misty rain. In August and September there are heavy
showers, accompanied with lightning and thunder.
In October there are about five days of rain, and
some heavy gales of wind, accompanied with heavy
showers, lightning, and thunder. During the first
part of November there are about six days of rain.
There is no doubt that rain is more frequent in the
neighbourhood of the high mountains, and that it is
often accompanied by thunder and lightning. On
the mainland there is more rain than on the island,
on account of the vicinity of the mountains.
CiilUvalion.
The island is under partial cultivation by the
natives, and its soil is excellent. The uncultivated
land is overgrown with high grass, and with a dense
New Guinea.
vegetation. A species of nyristica, or muscatel nut,
is indigenous; there are some sago trees, planted by
the natives, and a few cocoa-nu trees. A magni-
ficent tree, which sheds its leaves at the season that
represents winter in England, grows in the forest;
it produces in great abundance, what is called ? silk
cotton:? a tree which resembles this, but is not
the same, is found at Capo York.
.Imimals and ISeptilrg.
The natives have not yet succeeded in extermi-
nating the wild pig, and this animal does serious
damage to plantations, unless they are protected by
bamboo or wooden palisades. There are several
species of harmless serpents, one measuring no less
than seventeen feet in length ; these serpents feed
on rats, which are plentiful, and on flying foxes.
The months of September, October, and November
are the richest in
Eivee,


Insects,
and, in the early part of November lomaptera may
be gathered by thousands, while the bark of the cut
down trees swarms with species of other families.
Two or three kinds of small fish are to be found in
the river. The sea abounds in fish, and, in the
season, turtles are not scarce, especially in Torres
Straits. Small insects, such as gnats and sand-flys,
are much too abundant, and are a great torment;
there are day gnats and night gnats, of all colours,
and of all sizes; the sand-flys are a groat pest, and
penetrate through everything, luckily they only
make their appearance during the first days of a
new moon. There are several varieties of the
spider, one deserving special mention; it is of a
most beautiful velvety purple, and lives in the
earth ; the largest measure three inches in length.
Ants are very numerous; there is a small black ant
of extraordinary voracity, but which does not get
into the house. D?Albertis mentions that in four
hours the body of a dog as big as a hare was
reduced to a perfectly polished skeleton by these
ants. Houses are infested by a large black ant,
which is nocturnal in its habits, does not appear in
the daytime, and only attacks vegetable substances.
Termites are numerous; they build dwellings one
or two feet high, in the form of a truncated cone.
Wood-lice are common ; some measure eight inches
in length, and their bite is somewhat venemous.
Scorpions also attain a great size, and are found
under stones and about old tree trunks.
The EiiHs
on the mainland are partly covered with beautiful
forest, and partly with strong, thick, long grass.
Here is found the Eucalyptus tree, which gives an
Australian aspect to the country.
forests
of mangroves are to be met with towards the north,
on the low, flat shores, which, at low water give
forth pestiferous exhalations. They are very
beautiful to the eye, hnt nothing within the tropics
is more hateful, or more to be avoided. Its atmos-
phere is most oppressive. The roots of the man-
grove tree are in great part exposed; they stretch
out in every direction, knotting themselves together
in the most wonderful way. The soil is black and
soft; one often sinks into it knee-deep, and, where
it is harder, it is very slippery. Nauseating odours
are emitted by the remains of animals, and by
putrifying vegetation. Crabs, lizards, monitors, and
snakes, have their abode in these parts, from which
man flys. Crocodiles frequently sun themselves on
the banks. Birds are very few; the cormorant
may be found, feeding on the shell fish which
abound in the mud, and among the roots of the
mangrove.
Beyond these melancholy regions the hills are
again clothed with grass, or with beautiful forests
of eucalyptus.
Mirds.
Here are found pigeons of all colours and of all
sizes, small parrots, birds of paradise, and many
splendid specimen?s of the feathered race.
Beautiful
Palm Trees
and lovely ferns arc abundant. Towards the north
'are fertile valleys and broad rich plains. Here the
villages are numerous and populous, and the natives,
although savages, are gentle, and live in a sort of
semi-civilisation. They differ widely from the in-
habitants of the north-west of this great island, and
are evidently of a mixed race;
lio Sljjns of iEeligion
can be discovered among them, nor has it been
ascertained whether they possess any idols. They
are superstitious, and resort to incantations and
signs under certain circumstances. For instance,
the drawing of a horoscope by means of a pebble
dangling from a thread hold between the thumb and
first finger, is of everyday occurrence. The fertile
soil i o luces great quantities of fruit. Game and
fish are abundant in the forests, the rivers, and the
sea; while alternate hunting and fishing allows a
variety of food.
Polygamy.
The natives practise, but do not abuse polygamy.
The chiefs have as many as five wives ; generally
however, they have but two. Wives are obtained
by payment to the father of the maiden of a sum of
money in compensation for the loss he sustains in
giving up his daughter. The women, although
obliged to work hard, are held in respect, and have
influence in their own families; in war they are
respected even by the enemy. The natives live in
communities, sometimes of more than one thousand
inhabitants, in well built villages, worthy to be
called small towns. They are under the rule of
The Chiefs,
or land owners. These chiefs have little authority,
but they enjoy certain privileges, the first of which
is polygamy. The Chief is looked upon as father
of the family. He is called ? Pacao,? and his servant,
or subject, is called ?Irine.? Slavery does not exist,
and the sale of human beings is unknown.
Pastime.
Being skilful in husbandry and hunting they
easily procure the necessaries of life; and the
remainder of their time they either pass in idleness,
in dancing and feasting, in visits to friendly tribes,
or in receiving them in their own villages. They
fish with nets of various kinds, and prefer the spear
to the bow-and-arrow, which is becoming obsolete
among them. For
Mooting
they make use of very strong nets, in which they
catch the game, killing it with clubs and spears.
They are unacquainted with any metal, and their
weapons and utensils are made of stone and bone.
A bivalve shell, the teeth of the kangaroo, and the
tusks of the wild boar, are, in the hands of these
people, implements of the greatest utility. For
Personal Adornment
they use berries, flowers, bone, shells, and feathers,
especially bright coloured ones. Necklaces of dogs?
and crocodiles? teeth, are most highly prized, and
serve for the purchase of wives. They also orna-
ment articles of use with fine carving, and the forks,
made from the leg bone of the cassowary, with
which they eat fish, are beautifully carved. Even
the little sticks for conveying the lime they are in
the habit of chewing to the mouth, are often covered
with fine carving, and ornamented with feathers,
the heads and legs of birds, &c. They wear nose
ornaments of shells; the men wear very narrow
girdles round the body; the women wear garments
of grass cloth, skilfully and tastefully made. In
general the women are less given to personal adorn-
ment than the men.


Domestic
Arrangement s.
The early morning
is devoted to cleaning
the houses and the
road,which thewomen
keep clean, each in
front of her own door.
The young men at-
tend to the care of
their own persons,
adorning themselves
with feathers, and
painting their faces
with different colours.
The labour is fairly
divided between the
sexes ; the more fa-
tiguing fieldwork falls
to the share of the
men; sowing, gather-
ing, and providing for
the family, is the
business of thewomen.
The men make the
nets for hunting and
fishing, and build the
canoes and houses.
The women cook, but
the men prepare the
flesh meat for' them.
They know little or
nothing of medicine.
Tattooing:
is practised among
them; the women
have nearly their
whole body covered
with marks. Tin- men
can scarcely be said
to be tattooed, the
marks being very
rarely seen on the
face. Tribes and
families are recog-
nized by tattoo marks.
They carry on a small
Trade
by means of barter,
and exchange the
produce of hunting
and fishing for the
products of the earth.
They do not manufac-
ture, but they use
oarthware vessels for
cooking. These they
obtain from people
trading in them, who
live on the east of
Yule Island, in a
village. These people
make voyages in largo
canoes, capable of con-
taining one hundred
persons; they obtain
provisions during the
voyage, by touching
at the villages on the
coast, and giving their
earthenware in ex-
change. There is no
doubt but that these
people would answer
to the call of a civi-
lized nation, and, if
well treated and
guided, would repay
any sacrifices made
to them. To ensure
success, however, they
should be treated as
friends, not as slaves;
they should be fos-
tered and cherished,
not destroyed.
Signor D?Albertis
gives some very in-
teresting particulars
of the village of
IVaialtui,
being the one where
he longest resided.
Writing of thisvillage,
he says that ?it is
built of two long rows
of houses, on either
side of a long, wide
roadway, shut in hy
a couple of houses at
either end. The houses
are separated from one
another by an interval
of six or seven yards,
and are constructed
of trunks of trees,
bamboos, and the
leavesof the nipa tree.
Their height above
the ground varies from
six to twelve feet;
some of them are built
on tall trees, these are,
however, used only
as pleasure houses.
Dwellings belonging
to the head men are
called
?Mareas s**
in these the men as-
semble for eating and
discussion, and enter-
taining strangers. The
young men live in the
houses at the two
extremities of the
village, the women
and children in the
abodes of their hus-
bands and fathers.
The women are rarely
allowed to enter a
? marea,? and, in
many villages, never.
In these ? mareas,?
with the exception of
a few shields, spears,
and drums, there is
no furniture of any
kind. The shape of the
? marea ? is almost

always thr.t of half a boat turned upside down. All
the possessions of the owners are kept in the other
houses, which are rectangular in shape. Both
houses and ? mareas ? invariably have verandahs in
front of them, in which the natives assemble for
conversation and eating. The
Food
is prepared and brought there by the women, by
whom it is cooked; the men, however, prepare the
meat before it is handed over to the women to cook.
For knives they use pieces of bamboo. The married
men sleep in the same houses in which the women
live, but to which strangers are never admitted, as
they sleep in the mareas.? The most laborious
Labour In the Fields
fall upon the men while the women do the sowing*
The women, however, procure wood for burning,
and carry home the crops from the fields. Their
loads are carried in a net-work bag, with a cord
which passes over the head, a little above the fore-
head. The women accompany the men on their
hunting expeditions, carry their provisions, pre-
pare their food, and bear home the hunting and
fishing spoils. The men, however, always carry
the heavy nets, which are used both for hunting
and fishing. When not engaged in these pursuits,
these people work daily in the fields, with the excep-
tion of the head men, who remain at home, employ-
ing their leisure in making nets. The food of this
people consists chiefly of the produce of their
hunting and fishing, of yams, bananas, taro, and
cocoa-nuts. They also eat grasshoppers, reptiles,
shell fish, and the larva? of insects. They light great
fires at night under the houses, and under their
hammocks, to protect themselves against damp, cold,
and mosquitoes. They are very sensitive to cold,
and cover themselves at night with large pieces of
tapuna. They are quite unacquainted with metals,
and use stone axes, bamboo knives, and instruments
of hard wood to split wood. For fine work they use
bits of pointed stone or shells, with which they shave
their heads as well as we could with our best razors.
The only
Musical Instruments
they possess are the drum, a kind of bagpipes mad e
of seven reeds, and a jewsharp of bamboo. The men
are very fond of dancing, which they do exceedingly
well; they dress in their best for these dances.
They d > a little in the way of commerce, bartering
tlie products of their fields with those of other vil-
lages. The young men are not permitted to marry
until they have a house of their own, and articles
necessary for the purchase of a wife. Woman is the
token of peace, and in all peaceable expeditions the
women march ahead of the men.? In the waters
round about
Island
is found a large fish called the ? dugong,? weighing
several hundredweight, which is 'cooked and eaten
by the natives. Mr. O. C. Stone, writing in 1880,
says, when the dugong was cooked the men clus-
tered around, scraping it with oyster shells, or with
their fingers, and afterwards sucking them wich
evident relish. They offered us a portion whith
we did not disdain to accept, and found very good,
tasting something like veal. They told us of an
immense bird found up the
Baxter Silver,
which can take up a dugong in its claws; but,
knowing how greatly exaggerated and little reliable
the statements of the natives usually are, wo
felt very incredulous.? The macapodium, or
wild fowl, is very abundant, their nests are
enormous, some measuring eight foot high, and
fifty feet round the base. They are composed of soil
and decayed vegetation, which, when it becomes
heated by the sun, hatches the eggs, laid a few feet
below the top of the nest. Ducks are plentiful in
the swampy portion of Boigu Island, and are so
tame as to be easily shot. Pigeons, doves, paro-
quets, white cranes, and the most magnificent
buttei flies, make nature gay with song and colour.
Land shells, snail shells, snakes, and lizards abound.
Sharks are plentiful in tie waters, and dugongs are
speared almost daily by the natives, who erect
bamboo perches over the river, seated on which,
they await a favourable opportunity for launching
forth their barbed spears into the finny monster.
Yule island
is called also lloro, and Laval, and presents a most
beautiful appearance, reminding one of an English
park, with its patches of trees and verdant slopes.
Nothing is required but an enlightened people to
make of it a garden of plenty, and a most charming
residence. Bed beads, red serge, and fish hooks,
are the most useful articles of barter at Yule Island,
whereas tobacco is quite at a discount. Pearl shells
are the most valuable things in the eyes of a native,
and a single one will sometimes purchase a canoe.
The men dig the ground with great rapidity, in
gangs of a dozen or more together, by means of poles
eight feet long, pointed at one end, and then fence
it neatly round to prevent the encroachment of wild
boars. These fences are six feet high, composed of
sticks placed upright in the earth, five or six inches
apart, tied near the top to creepers running parallel
with the ground. The inclosures vary in size from
five to thirty acres, those natives avlio have con-
structed and planted them sharing the produce.
mSTiCI?T OF THE MYIUYSY OK
ItlXTElt lIIVEK.
The Daude Papuans, as the natives of the Baxter
River are called, are said to be cannibals; they lead
a roving life, hunting with the bow and arrow, and
fishing with nets and spears. This district is very
thinly inhabited; the malaria during the rainy
season, and the heavy night dews during the day,
create a most unhealthy atmosphere. One single
night spent on shore here, at some seasons, is quite
sufficient to give an European the fever. Notwith-
standing this, by boat, the climate is agreeable
enough. Birds of paradise are very numerous, and
are shot down very easily; boa-constrictors abound
in the forests. The
ftlkura lilver
(named by Captain Moresby the Ethel) flows into
the foot of Hall Sound. It is called Nikura, from a
village of that name situated seven or eight miles
from the coast, containing about a hundred inhabi-
tants. Another village called Epa is situated some
twelve miles further on. There is a small creek
flowing into the Nikura River, ten miles from its
mouth, called by some of the natives Bioto, after a
village six miles from the confluence. This creek
has been named by Captain Moresby the Hilda
River, but is most frequently referred to by the
natives, as the Amama.


The Village of Xaratoul
is situated seven miles from Bioto, and Purok is
seen on the hills ten miles east Narabui. Near
to Purok is a market place, consisting of a large
circular place cleared of grass and trees, where
natives from distant villages meet at certain seasons
to trade; wild pigs, which abound in certain
localities, fish from Capo Suckling, kangaroos from
the interior, bananas and bread fruit from the fertile
valleys, are exchanged for such articles as are most
rare in the districts" of those purchasing. At other
times large feasts are given, to which those from a
distance are invited.
Their Canoes.
During the north-west monsoons, when the
weather is calm and favourable, the natives from
Yule Island, and from the mainland, there called
? Maiva,? may be seen sailing southwards in their
canoes for purposes of barter, returning again as
soon as a fair wind sets in. The sails of their
smallest canoes are very primitive, being sometimes
composed of a single sago palm leaf, or else of two
sago palm stalks, supporting between them a sort of
cloth made of tappa. The ordinary canoe is manu-
factured from the trunk of a tree hollowed out,
pointed at both ends, and fitted with a single out-
rigger to steady it.
Three of the largest villages in the immediate
neighbourhood of Hall Sound are those of
Hon Meaurl and Erlne,
situated within a few minutes walk of each other.
Among the most beautiful birds found in this part
of New Guinea are the King bird of Paradise, the
Paradisea raggiana, paradise oriole, the superb bird
of paradise, the crowned pigeon, several large fruit
eating pigeons and doves, and parrots of various
genera. Reptiles are moderately numerous, includ-
ing rather largo snakes, but mammalia are very
scarce. Insects are very plentiful, but both these
and reptiles have a great affinity with those of
Australia.
Missionary Slalions
are met with here and there. The life of a mission-
ary is at all times arduous, deprived as it is of home
comforts in the true sense of the word. Here, how-
ever, deprived of all communication with the civil-
ized world for months at a time, the life of a worker
for Christ is especially hard, and deserving of our
admiration.
The Mannmann,
or Bird River, flows into Redscar Bay, and was dis-
covered by an adventurous Swede, named Thorngren,
who ascended it for a distance of twelve miles. The
village of Manumanu is situate close to its mouth,
and the more important village of Kapatsi, about
four miles up a wide creek. The river has been
named the Usborno, and the creek, Gully Reach, by
Captain Moresby.
Naro is another small village on the seashore, a
few miles to the west of the rivers mouth. The entire
Sea Coast
for some distance inland, is here low and swampy,
abounding with mangroves, and necessarily un-
healthy. The Skittles arc some rocks in the midst
of the bay, and here also is Parivari Island, which
is in the shape of a horse shoe, with rocky eminences
at either end. Redscar Head derived its name from
the reddish appearance of the cliffs which compose
it; and Caution Bay, close by, was so called on ac-
count of the many hidden reefs that He concealed,
necessitating greater caution in its navigation.
Vegetable food of all sorts is rather scarce, hut,
in the months of October, November, and December,
animal food can be easily procured, as kangaroos are
particularly plentiful, and there are also numbers of
pigeons which can readily be shot with a gun, but
the natives can seldom obtain them on account of
their inferior weapons. The three largest
Animals
inhabitingthe country arethe ?mikani,? or kangaroo,
about the size of the smallest Australian species,
commonly called a ? wallaby; ? the pig, which is
frequently kept in a domesticated state, and when
wild, usual y inhabitants the river banks ; and the
barkless dog, resembling the Australian wild dog, or
? dingo,? in its peculiar yelp, which is found in every
village ; of baggage animals there are at present
none.
From the similarity of the flora and fauna of the
country to that of Australia, there is evey reason to
suppose that
�old
exists in New Guinea, although at present perfectly
unknown to the natives. The supposed existence
there of gold has been held out by certain enthusiasts
as an inducement for ?a rush.? Let it first be found
to exist, but, in the interests of humanity it is to
be hoped that it will not bo discovered at present.
We do not want a mob to rush madly into a not
unfriendly country in the pursuit of gold, it must
not be permitted; the natives are too few to be
murdered 1 Government alone can successfully
colonise it, but a
? Colonising; Company,?
without proper administration and knowledge of the
people, would do immense harm.
With regard to the colonization of the island, it
is generally admitted that Europeans can withstand
the fatal effects of the illness caused by change of
climate, better than most dark races, and con-
sequently recover from many diseases which are
fatal the the latter. Still, the coast of the island,
though chiefly highland, and comparatively free
from swamps, cannot be called healthy for
Europeans. The climate of the mountain
district further inland is far superior, and
it is there that the soil would best repay the labour
of cultivation. Even along the sea-coast the danger
is greatly lessened if proper precautions are taken,
in having well-ventilated houses, good diet, and
stimulants only in moderation. The inhabitants
themselves are sufficiently intelligent to be capable
of greater
Civilization,
but to effect this change too much care cannot be
exercised. Any large or sudden influx, without its
motive being perfectly understood, would either be
resisted by force, or else drive the inhabitants from
their own homes and plantations into the interior,
only to result in their extermination, as in the case
of the aborigines of Australia. Of all modes of
colonization, that is the best which is obtained by
peaceable means, which, while not permitting in-
subordination, yet exercises gentleness, and which
allows the people, whether white or black, to have
some interest in the Government.
However much has been done of late years in the
opening-up of New Guinea, yet the main body of it
still remains

? \ ? '
Terra Incognita,
and our Home Government would do well to sup-
port, if not to organise, an expedition into its
inmost recesses. The pecuniary difficulty of such
an enterprise is, of course, a formidable obstacle ;
nevertheless it would not, probably, entail the tenth
part of the cost of an Arctic Expedition, with far
? more satisfactory and substantial results.
The Melbourne Argus of September 24th publishes
several letters received from Captain W. G. Armit,
its special correspondent, who is engaged in
Tfie Exploration of \ew Guinea.
In his first letter Captain Armit speaks of the
natives as follows :
? Savages! I never saw such savages, nor anyone
else. Let Australians disabuse their minds once
for all of such ideas. These Papuans arc no more
savages than we are. Barbarians they are, no
doubt; but even -as barbarians they compare very
favourably with us and our vaunted civilisation.
Their gardens show an amount of thought and well-
directed labour and enterprise of which savages
would be utterly incapable. Their houses arc well
built, comfortable, and quite up to the standard
required by the climate. They are cleanly in their
habits, washing everything before they cook it, and
themselves whenever they get an opportunity.
Their laws are strict, and are generally obeyed.
Their women are chaste, womanly, and pleasant.
I am quite delighted with these ferocious Papuans.
The first village reached after leaving Port Moresby
was Robbertoom. It consisted of eleven houses
built several feet off the ground, and seven trec-
liouscs called ? Dobo,? some GOft. or 70ft. up in the
air, built among the boughs of lofty scrub trees.
The tree-houses are used as places of refuge when
the villages are attacked. The villagers run up the
ladders, drawing up after them the last 15ft. length,
and defend themselves with stones stored in the
houses. Captain Armit gives a very pleasant
account of the villagers, who, he says, though with-
out religion, are far more moral than Europeans.
Property is sacred among them, and breaches of the
marriage laws, which are punishable by death, are
.hardly ever known. The country is fertile. Dogs
and pigs were to be seen fighting everywhere, and
the women have young pigs for pets, which follow
them like lapdogs. The natives have a curious way
of disposing of their dead. They embalm them?l
Englishmen ? Prospecting/'
cannot discover how, as they are fearfully super-
stitious, and will not speak about it, and hang them
up in net hammocks in their houses until there are a
sufficient number of mummies to fill a house. A
mortuary is then built, in which all the dead
are hung. This building is never entered except
when a fresh boarder or lodger wants hanging,
and even then only in dire fear and trembling. No
one seems to know wjiere this mortuary is. When
it becomes crowded the most ancient mummies?
patriarchal ashes?are removed, and put away in a
cave somewhere or other ?there arc plenty of them
about here?and the mouth is closed up.? From
Robertoom the correspondent went to Narianouma
with the chief of that place, who had come down to
visit him. The country traversed is described as both
beautiful and fertile, every inch of the land along the
river being suited to agriculture?sugar, maize,
tapioca, sago, arrowroot, tobacco, indigo, spice, gin-
ger, vanilla, besides every species of vegetable.
There would be no difficulty in obtaining land, and
once the proprietors sell, the purchaser?s right would
be as jealously observed as if he were a native. The
whole country is suited to European settlement,
either as farms, plantations, or cattle stations. There
were broad stretches of water, in which fish and
crocodiles abound. The correspondent, who spent
some some time in exploring the neighbourhood of


Narianouma, speaks in glowing terms of the beauty
of the mountainous region of the Astrolabe, which
rises 2,500 ft. above the sea level. The village of
Narianouma is built on a high spur of the Astrolabe.
It is perched on an extreme end, and overlooks a
deep gorge running into the Laloki, distant one mile.
My aneroid gives the altitude here at 1,850 ft. The
view from this beautiful spot is exquisitely lovely.
It , surpasses everything I have ever seen in mountain
scenery, and must be seen to be appreciated. . .
Between these mountain-chains and the Laloki
extends a track of very broken mountain ranges.
Deep gorges, high peaks, no two of which are alike;
and high forest-clad spurs succeed one another in
every direction. As far as the eye can reach,
mountains, mountains, nothing but mountains.
Literally there is not a yard of flat country to be
seen. At morn and eve the roar of Rooma Falls is
distinctly heard borne up the valley and its tributary
ravines on the soft breeze. The voices of the natives
may be heard at a great distance yelling, to frighten
the pigs, or conveying intelligence from village to
village.? The correspondent was accompanied in
his journey by about 100 natives ?men, women, and
girls?carrying his baggage. The women do most
of the carrying. Describing his ascent, the corre-
spondent says: ?It is a terrible climb, especially
after a long day of hard work. But I persevere,
panting, slipping, and bathed in perspiration. I
passed a woman half-way up; she is standing on a
narrow ledge of rock, and has a load of 1371b. on
her head and back, yet she does not seem distressed.
Two women will carry 901b. between them on a
pole, but these women carry singly heavier swags
than the men. Fifty pounds of flour, two bags of
shot, and three kangaroos, was one woman?s por-
tion, and I verily believe that she would have taken
a fourth if I had shot it. The men were yelling and
laughing all the way up; two of them brought
bundles of split sago-palm battens from Eobbertoom,
weighing about 1001b. and 30ft. long. Old Lohia,
the village chief, marches along with two sticks of
sugar-cane on his royal shoulders, and a bamboo
pipe in his hand. His little daughter, three years
old, had a bag weighing 101b. slung across her fore-
head when we started, and was well ahead at
Ahoumani, where her mother remained. No wonder
they can carry weight when their training com-
mences so early. The men and women are splen-
didly developed specimens of the genus homo; their
bodies are well fed ; they have no superabundant
flesh, but all muscle; good looking, good tempered,
honest, and trustworthy, these people are capable
of rapid improvement and a high state of culture.
All that is necessary is to direct them properly, and
to protect them from the inroads of unscrupulous
white people, who will stop at nothing, however low
and moan it may be, to gain their ends.
The Argus also publishes several letters from its
correspondent despatched to visit the New Hebrides.
Writing from Tanna, ho says:??l find that the
feeling against the French amongst the natives of
this island is very strong indeed. Most of them
have been engaged in Fiji, Queensland, or New
Caledonia, and they are more intelligent than the
majority of the inhabitants of the New Hebrides.
At the same time they are more bloodthirsty and
cruel, and it is their nature to fight and kill. Few
white men are able to stop here. There are now
two missionaries and one trader only. Godfrey
Khyn, a Norwegian, who wishes to purchase land
around the volcano, containing sulphur deposits.
All the tribes interested will sell, but only on the
express stipulation that the land is never to pass
into the hands of the French. The chiefs tell me
that if annexation is attempted by France they will
join together and resist. All of them are well armed
with Snider rifles. They are at constant war with
each other. A man was shot on the beach a week
ago thirty yards from where I am stopping. The
missionary efforts here bear little fruit. I am
making arrangements for a truce and a genera
meeting of the chiefs, when, if any satisfactory
expression of opinion is arrived at, X shall prepare
a petition to the Queen in favour of annexation to
Groat Britain for their signature.?
Captain Armit has passed forty or fifty miles into
the interior of the country, and writing from a
place called
\arianoiima.
mentioned above, he says;?? They,(the natives)
want a European, and would not then be afraid of
being attacked. ? Why do not the Britanniata come
to us ?? said old Lohia, ? we want them too, and
they can bring everything we want. They know
everything, and can tell us. But do not bring any
men of war because we do not want them. Also
give me a flag to put on a pole before ray house,
and your people will know it when they see it, and
also that I love the Britanniata.? I assured him
there would soon be many Englishmen in New Guinea
and hoped he would be a friend to them all. This
the old fellow will as long as no one commits any
wrong.?
The ?Vagabond? writes, that most of the
Europeans in the New Hebrides who arc identified
with French interests, favour annexation by France.
On the other hand, the ?Vagabond? has found that
the natives are averse to French annexation, and
desire that Great Britain should assume a protecto-
rate of their islands.
There can be no doubt that the
Missionaries,
in New Guinea have done an almost incalculable
amount of good in this country, and their settlement
at Fort Moresby will undoubtedly be the centre
from which the civilising influence (assisted by the
explorations of such men as Mr. Morrison, who was
elected by the spirited proprietors of the Age to lead
an exploring party through Now Guinea. The best
provision has been made to ensure the success of
Mr. Morrison?s Mission,
and nothing that money or experience could suggest
has been left undone. Carte blanche has been given
to the explorer, whose experiences in the South Sea
labour traffic, in which he was engaged for some
time, has given him a great insight into the manner
in which the New Guinea natives should be dealt
with, and he will no doubt profit by his experience.
He has a thoroughly equipped party, and his own
skill, courage and tenacity of purpose will no doubt
carry him successfully through the work he has
undertaken.
Mis Explorations
will spread over what is now a practically unknown
continent. It is now some years since the mission-
aries first landed on the island; and they had to go
through some great trials before they finally suc-
ceeded in winning the confidence of the natives On
one occasion some white men who had landed on the
island for the purpose of prospecting for gold had


liiiled a Itatire,
and the result was the sacking of the mission and
the murder of some of the teachers, while the others
barely escaped with their lives. Nothing daunted,
the heroic missionaries made another trial, and
though they had uphill work they eventually suc-
ceeded, and now they are succeeding in
Winning' Converts
rapidly, and extending the sphere of their useful

labours. Prominent amongst the self-sacrificing
men who have done so much are the Eevs. Messrs.
Chalmers and Lawes. They have thoroughly
organised a staff of native teachers, and are slowly
extending the stations along the coast. Every care
is taken to see that those employed are suitable for
the work, and they have to pass a lengthy probation
before they arc entrusted with the work of teaching.
Mr. Chester is the police magistrate of Thursday
Island, who was commissioned by the Queensland
Government to
Amies Sen Guinea,
but the action has not been approved by the English
Government, though further attempts are to be
made to induce the Imperial Parliament to assent to
the wishes of the colony. That the annexation will
eventually take place we feel certain, and with the
sanction of the English Parliament. Writing in
favour of the annexation of New Guinea, Sir Henry
Parkes, K.C.M.G., says:?? Asa sampleof the visita-
tions with which New Guinea will be afflicted if the
country is now left to itself, I will give the story of
a visitor, as told by himself in a Sydney newspaper,
A Mr. John Cameron made it is business to visit
New Guinea last year with the avowed object of
buying land. Some reports about his transactions
with the natives which got abroad after his return
to Sydney induced Mr. Cameron to defend his con-
duct in the Herald newspaper. He explains that he
examined a large tract of country, and had repeated
intercourse with the natives; that he made known,
by means of interpreters, the object of his visit, and
the nature of a deed of conveyance which he
had brought with him for the native owners
of the land to sign. Nothing could be more
just and straightforward, he contends, than his
mode of procedure. Eventually he bought 12,000
acres of picked land, for which he paid �l4O in
cash, and gave presents to the amount of �5O.
Beckoning his presents at the value which he puts
upon them, Mr. Cameron paid less than 4d. per
acre for the best block of 12,000 acres of land
which he could find in a journey of sixty miles.
But he goes on to explain that only 1,000 acres
of the land is suitable for sugar-planting, and
2.000 acres for cotton; the remainder is poor and
swampy. _ Accepting this explanation of the quality
of the soil, Mr. Cameron paid about Is. Bd. per
acre for 3,000 acres of the richest land suitable for
the growth of sugar and cotton, and obtained
9.000 acres of other land for nothing. It is further
explained in Mr. Cameron?s ingenious way that a
missionary advised the natives to return the ?trade?
(the money and presents), and not part with their
land, and that in consequence ho went back to the
sellers, who reaffirmed the bargain. Mr. Cameron
was evidently in advance of General MHver. Now,
here is annexation with a vengeance. We may be
sure that other Camerons will pay friendly visits to
New Guinea.?
Whilst the annexation movement is pending, the
missionaries already there will no doubt influence
the natives to accept British rule; at present they
are on the best of terms with the people, and secured
a footing along the coast. The ? Ellangowan ?is a
schooner employed in mission work, and her captain
plays no unimportant part in the work of civiliza-
tion.
Types of the Vativcs.
as shown in our sketches, indicate that they are of
a higher order than the Australian aboriginal, and
this is confirmed when we find that they understand
cultivation, and have their villages laid out with
some regularity. New Guinea is undoubtedly a
country of great natural resources, and when it is
settled by the white man, as it must eventually be,
will be an important factor in the commercial pro-
gress of Australia.
