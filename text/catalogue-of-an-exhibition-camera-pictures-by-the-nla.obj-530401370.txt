FOREWORD
aHE Photographic Society of N.S.W. was
founded in 1894, and is affiliated with
the Royal Photographic Society of Great
Its principal aim is the advancement of
Photography as an Art and as a Science.
About 97 per cent, of its members are amateurs,
many of whom, through successes at the London
Salon of Photography, “Photograms of the Year,”
and Exhibitions overseas, are better known abroad
than in Australia. It is hoped that this Exhibition
will effect some reform in this respect.
The artistic instinct naturally must find an outlet
for its expression, whether it be by brush, pencil,
etching needle, camera, or other means. Many are
gifted to a high degree with artistic perception,
imagination and creation; yet, either through lack
of opportunity or of ability, have not acquired skill
in the manipulation of brush or pencil. To these
photography supplies the surest means of giving ex-
pression to such artistic gifts as they possess.
The advancement of Camera Art in Australia
depends to a large extent on the support and appreci-
ation of the Australian public, and, it is hoped that
the success of this Exhibition, through the courtesy
of Farmer & Company, Limited, will warrant the
holding of others, and will eventually lead to the
establishment of an Australian Salon of Photography.
