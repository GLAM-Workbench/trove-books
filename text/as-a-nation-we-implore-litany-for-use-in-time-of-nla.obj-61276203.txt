Hear our prayers as we adore, »

Cannot sleep till morn’s sun-rise,
cres Hear their prayers and heed their sighs
p While we kneel and pray.
mf Guard our troops in foreign land
Help their courage long to stand
c/wStrengthen every British hand,
p While we kneel and pray.

pr For the dead —in peace they sleep,
cresGoV) their souls will safely keep,
p While we kneel and pray.
mf Guard our sailors on the sea,
Help them whereso’er they be,
cresGive them faith to trust in Thee,
p While we kneel and pray.
/ Bless our Country; give us peace,
From our anxious cares release,
ff Till at last all wars shall cease,
dim While we kneel and pray.
mf Those now on the battle plain,
’Mid the wounded and the slain,
Give relief from all their pain,
p While we kneel and pray.
f Bless us all in every home,
Fighting in Thy strength alone,
// God will watch and bless His own,
While we kneel and pray. Amen.
