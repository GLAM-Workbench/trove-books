ADELAIDE,
JSOUTH y^USTF^ALIA,
AS A
FIELD FOR EMIGRATION.
1 8 7 2.
STY- Pamphlet has been compiled from the most reliable
ViA \) it} sources, chiefly from statistics published by the Colonial
Government, and is written in this condensed style for those
seeking a healthy, English, progressive colony to start in, especially
for young farmers of small capital, artisans, miners, and labourers.
The statement is put forward without colouring or ornament, and
professes simply to give a plain, unvarnished report of the progress
of South Australia during the 36 years of its settlement.
The climate is mild, for the greater part of the year enjoyable,
and the institutions as settled as in England.
The figures showing the progress of the Colony will speak
for themselves ; the cost of living is much below that in England J
—Bread, the alb. loaf; beef and mutton, 2d. to 3d. per lb. ;
butter, Bd. to icd, per lb.
Wages arc much ill excess of English rates, a day labourer
being paid 5/ to 6/ per day.— See page 9.


In a very few years a thrifty artisan or labourer can save
sufficient to purchase 100 acres of land. Education is carefully
managed by a Central Board appointed by the Government, which
dispenses state aid in the erection of school-houses to the extent
of one half the cost, in supplementing the stipends of teachers,
and in defraying the school fees of those unable to pay them.
There are 300 licensed schools, 269 of which are in country
districts; 294 licensed school-masters and mistresses, and 15,108
scholars on the roll. The last annual return states the government
of South Australia expended ,£22,895 IIS - Oll education.
There is no State aid to religion. There are 579 churches or
chapels, with sittings for 113,133 persons; 490 Sunday schools, in
which are 4,636 teachers, and 32,203 scholars.
The population of South Australia is 190,000, in 1836 it was
200 ; in 1871 the total value of the principal imports amounted to
£"2,160,864, being an increase of £131,070 on those of 1870;
and the staple exports in 1871 reached £3,289,862, shewing an
increase of upwards of a million pounds sterling over the year
previous, 1870, and an average per head upon the entire popula-
tion of £l7 Bs. id., from which is apparent the general progress
of the colony.
Wheat growing is most extensively pursued. South Australia
took the prize at the Great Exhibition of 1851 for the finest wheat
in the world. The vine is widely cultivated and most productive.
All English and many tropical fruits abound, besides the orange,
olive, and fig.
The Land Act of the Colony offers to those following
Agricultural pursuits, free selection over an area of several hundreds
of thousands of acres of surveyed sections not exceeding 640 acres
to each applicant, at a cost of 20/ to 40/ per acre, payable in easy
instalments extending over 10 years, besides 2/6 per acre to be
expended annually in improvements. —See Land Act in Appendix,
South Australia stands pre-eminent for its copper deposits,
which are worked to great advantage, several mines paying to
their shareholders handsome dividends.


The Emigration Act at present in force only assists emigrants
when nominated in the Colony; but there is now before the
House of Assembly a Bill to assist by the Land Order Warrant
system, the conditions of which will be inserted in the Appendix.
The passage money by first-class ships in the steerage does not
exceed £l3 to The passage out occupies from 75 to 90
days. To those desirous of obtaining infornTation of the history
of the Colony from its discovery by Captain Sturt, its colonization
under the “ Wakefield System,” the forms of Government, present
Constitution, general description, an account of the public works
and institutions, extent of territory, and other details, a reference
to standard works will be found in the Appendix.
South Australia has equipped numerous expeditions to explore
the interior of the Continent, and is justly proud of the able and
intrepid leaders who have conducted them. Captain Sturt stands
foremost for his discoveries of the River Murray and its tributaries
which led to the founding of the Colony ; in 1845 he commanded
an expedition to the northward, which reached 24 degs. south
latitude. Mr. Eyre in 1840 explored much of the country now
settled north of Adelaide, and evinced an indomitable courage in
his journey westward to King George’s Sound; several minor
expeditions have at intervals opened up new country, but J,
McDouall Stuart, assisted chiefly by private enterprize, succeeded,
after twice being driven back, with an intrepidity and endurance
never surpassed, in penetrating to the northern coast through the
centre of the Australian Continent. Mr. John McKinlay was
another able leader of an expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria;
and at the present time two expeditions, equipped by South
Australia, are exploring the vast tract of land westward of Stuart’s
track. But the crowning feat in the wake of Stuart’s exploration
has recently been accomplished, and no greater proof can be
adduced of the enterprize of the Colonists of South Australia than
their undertaking and completing, unaided, a line of telegraph over
1800 miles of the Continent to Port Darwin on the northern coast,
thus connecting Australia-with England and Europe.


The following letter from the Agent General of the Province,
records in eloquent language the magnitude of the undertaking :
THE AUSTRALIAN LAND TELEGRAPH ,
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir, Vour telegraph columns this morning have already announced
the completion of the Australian land line of telegraph to Port Darwin.
My own Telegram from the Government of South Australia did not
come to hand till very late last night; 1 hope, therefore, you will still
permit me to give the official confirmation of the important news that
the land line of telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin was completed
on the 22nd August, and is working most satisfactorily. The great
undertaking is thus completed ; we now wait anxiously for the repair
of the submarine cable of the British Australian Telegraph Company,
which, being accomplished, London will be within a few hours’ com-
munication with Adelaide and all the other centres of population of
the Australian continent. The Suez Canal, the Mont Cenis Tunnel,
and the Pacific Railway are great and stupendous works ; but if any one
whose judgment is not warped by prejudice wall look at a map of
Australia, consider the uninhabited and all but unknown country through
which the line of telegraph is carried for 1,800 miles, will further con-
sider our limited ‘‘ means to an end” in comparison with the unlimited
means brought to bear on those other works, and the results achieved
as they will affect the advancement of civilization and material progress
of this busy world, he will, I think, be ready to allow that the work so
well performed, single-handed, by the colony I have the honour to
represent, is worthy of being mentioned also when those other great
works are cited as examples of what can be done by perseverance and
energy. Some months ago, in a letter you were good enough to give
publicity to, I ventured to anticipate the possibility of important dis-
coveries being made which would give additional value to the work then
in progress. These anticipations already have in part been realised. The
Roper, then only known to exist, has now been ascertained to be a noble
river, the only one in Australia, navigable for large seagoing steamers
and ships for zoo miles from the sea. We now also know of discoveries
of gold having been made in various directions in the Northern territory,
of sufficient importance to induce numerous parties of gold miners to
pioceed there to develop those discoveries. I even ventured to hint in
that letter of the possible advent, at no remote period, of the “ iron
horse ” following the slender telegraph wire, and already the subject is
undergoing a preliminary ventilation of public discussion in Australia.
who profess to be wise in their generation are heard to laugh


now at the idea of a trans-continental Australian railway as preposterous,
but the same class of people, when they first heard of the trans-conti-
nental telegraph being projected declared it to be impossible of execu-
tion. Yet there it is now, completed and in first-rate working order.
Sooner or later the north and south coasts of Australia will be connected
by rail as it now is by wire. The noble harbour of Port Darwin seem
fitted by nature to be the point of nearest contact for the Anglo-Aus-
tralian mail service, as well as shortening the route for the tide of
emigration to Australia. Time will effect the necessary conciliation of
conflicting intercolonial interests ; by united action of all the rich Aus-
tralian Colonies, the cost of the iron road to the north coast will offer
no insurmountable obstacle.
The Government of South Australia, having completed the line of
telegraph, are determined that no cost shall be spared to make it a
permanent success. I have already sent out a number of iron poles,
and am engaged now in sending out a further large quantity, which
will be used to strengthen the line. To maintain the line in a state of
perfect working efficiency is now merely a matter of ordinary business
routine.
Permit me to apologise for trespassing so largely on your valuable
space. I trust you will excuse it on the ground of the event now
accomplished being of as much importance to the community of this
great country as it is to that portion of the Anglo-Saxon race settled
at the Antipodes.
I have the honour to remain, your obedient servant,
FRANCIS S. DUTTON, Agent-General.
Office of Agent-General for South Australia, 37, Great George-street,
Westminster, London, S.W., Oct. 3, 1872.
A study of the following tables, being official returns published
in the Government Gazette, will prove Adelaide to offer prospects
of advancement and competency to all people of industrious habits.

The value of flour exported from the colony reached its maximum
in 1863, amounting to ,£844,619. The quantity of wheat exported last
year was greater than in any previous year.
The exportation of wool in 1871 exceeded in value that of any
former year except 1868, when it had reached the maximum of
,£1,305,280.
Wine has not been exported to the extent anticipated, though in
1870 it was greater than in any one year before then.
The exportation of tallow has increased very rapidly during the
last few years. Thus, during the seven years from 1861 to 1867 in-
clusive, the total value was only ,£2,801, whereas the aggregate value

Nothing can show more conclusively than this table the general progress of the
colony from its establishment to the present time. In compiling the table
we have availed ourselves of every suitable document and record at our
command, and have carefully collated and compared their contents to ensure
accuracy. — From the Adelaide Observer , March 30 th, 1872.

of the tallow exported during the last four years has been £154,957.
This is attributable to the boiling-down establishments, which first
commenced operations upon an extensive scale in 1868. So also the
exportation of preserved meats commenced in 1870, when the
quantity shipped from the colony was 4.785 cwt., whilst in 1871 it
amounted to very nearly 10,000 cwt.
In regard to minerals of all kinds, the greatest value of the exports
in any one year was that of 1866, viz., £824,651. In 1867 it fell
to £752,241, and in 1868 to ,£619,604. In 1869 it rose t0£643.345,
including gold the produce of the oolony, the exports of which in
that year amounted t0£15,593.

The three great staples of South Australia are breadstuffs,
wool, and minerals.
Comparative statement of the exports of staple produce in 1870 and
1871.
The very great extent to which the value of our staple exports is
affected by the seasons is shown in this table. Thus the average
yield of wheat throughout the colony of the season 1869-70 was only
5 bushels 45lbs. per acre, whilst the harvest of 1870-1 yielded 11
bushels 301b5., or precisely double that of the previous year. Accord-
ingly the exports of agricultural produce in 1871 exceeded those of the
previous year by the very large amount of £782,303, the relative pro-
portions being very nearly as 8 to 3.
It is not always easy to classify the articles of export. Jams, for
instance, may be considered as horticultural productions or as manufac-
tured articles. Tallow, preserved meats, and leather may also be
classed as animal productions or manufactured articles, and so in
some other instances.
The following order of classification has been adopted in the
compilation of the above table ! —•
I. Agricultural Produce. —Wheat, flour, meal, barley, oats, bran,
pollard, hay, rye, peas, and horsefeed.
11. Horticultural Produce.—Fruit, vegetables, wine, plants, trees,
seeds, and roots.
111. Dairy Produce.—-Bacon, hams, pork, butter, cheese, and eggs.
IV. Animal productions.—Live stock, wool, tallow, preserved
meats, dried fish, hides, skins, horns, bones, hoofs, hair, wax, honey,
gluepieces, bonedust, mohair, &c.
V. Minerals.—'Copper, copper-ore, regulus, gold, silver, silver-
lead ore, lead, iron ore, precipitate, bismuth, plumbago, dolomite, zinc,
and mundic.


VI. Manufactures. —Carts, drays, implements, machinery, furniture,
leather, jams, spirits, beer, malt, groceries, provisions, oilman’s stores,
glue, soap, jewellery, plated goods, bread and biscuit, books, saddlery,
boots and shoes, drapery, &c.
VII. Natural Productions.—Timber, bark, gum, specimens, salt,
guano, lime, sandstone, slate, flax, shells, and paper-grass.
VIII. Unenumerated Articles. Rags and and other articles not
specifically named in the returns. —From the Adelaide Observer.
Agricultural pursuits employ the greatest number of people,
the Government having granted facilities for the acquisition of land
which has given an impetus to this industry in spite of occasionally
an untoward season when the average yield of wheat has been
little above 5 bushels to the acre. Mr. Booth by puts the average
yield for a number of seasons at 12 bushels per acre.
It is not unusual for a farmer with his two or three sons to
plough and sow 200 acres of wheat in the season. On the plains
double ploughs are used, on light soils treble and quadruple
ploughs. Harvesting is done with Ridley’s Machine—a colonial
invention—which combs off the ears of wheat and thrashes them
as the wheels revolve, leaving the stubble standing, to be after-
wards consumed or burnt. The grain is deposited in heaps on
the land, winnowed and placed in sacks without any stacking or
garnering, as in England. Two men and a boy with a team of
horses or oxen can reap and thrash 7 to 10 acres a day.
Machines cost about several farmers joining in a purchase,
or otherwise can be hired. The following from an old colonist,
Mr. Geo. McEwin, gives a faithful description of the resources of
South Australia.—
THE RESOURCES OF THE COLONY,
To the Editor of the Adelaide Observer.
Sir —It is impossible for any one who has the interests of the colony
at heart, and who earnestly desires its advancement, to stand by and not
feel that its material progress has from some cause or other been retarded ;
in other words that we have not made that progress in population nor in
the industrial developement of our natural resources which we were war-
ranted in anticipating. We have a large territory, a great proportion of


■which is admirably adapted for agricultural and pastoral pursuits, and
our mineral resources are rich and varied. —Our climate will bear
favourable comparison with that of any other country on the face of the
globe, in spite of all that your anonymous correspondent “ Verbum Sap.”
has said to the contrary. It is true we have our drawbacks in occasional
droughts and hot winds ; but where is the country which has not some-
thing or other in the climate to complain of? Take North America for
example. There the winter is so severe that the ground is covered with
snow and all the rivers are frozen over for six months in the year, and
the country is one vast forest, so that the settlers have a great many hard-
ships to endure which are quite unknown in this colony. Why, the
labour of clearing a farm in Canada would purchase the fee-simple of
one of rich land in this colony, free from all obstructions, ready, in fact,
for the plough, and there are generally belts of timber at no great distance
fit for fencing. It is a well-known fact that in all ages agriculture has
been the mainstay of States. Their principal wealth was derived from
this source. That ours is an agricultural country par excellence the"e can
be no doubt. Our wheat commands the highest price in the London
market, and our wheat lands are the finest in Australia—l might say the
world if we except some parts of Russia, California, and some of the
Western States of America —and our average wheat yield will bear
favourable comparison with that of most of those large wheat-growing
countries ; that of the United States, if we except California, being eight
or nine bushels per acre. It is true we have had some very deficient
yields of late years ; these, however, with one exception, were not due
to the absence of rain, but rather to its superabundance, red rust—which
is well known to be generated by an excess of moisture —having been
the cause of our late failure in the wheat crops.
None of the other Australian Colonies or New Zealand possess the
advantages we do as an agricultural country. Their hilly and broken
character precludes the possible growth of grain on a large scale. Here
we have immense tracts of rich level country lying ready for the plough,
which can be brought into immediate cultivation at the least possible
expence ; and all that is wanted to make this colony one of the largest
wheat-producing countries in the world is population. I need only
mention this one fact in proof of what I say, that with our limited
population, and without any addition to the number of our farmers, there
were 100,000 acres additional under wheat last year, the greater propor-
tion of which was virgin soil. There are other products of the field
besides wheat which thrive equally well, as barley, oats, beans, peas,
beet-root, mangold wurzel, potatoes, carrots, &c., &c. Then there are
the horticultural productions, which areas varied as those of any country
on the face of the globe. I believe I may say with safety that no other


city is so abundantly or so cheaply supplied with vegetables or fruits as
Adelaide, and for quality they cannot be surpassed. This is pre-emi-
nently the land of the vine, the olive, and the mulberry, and we have
land enough to occupy millions of people in industrial pursuits, such as
the preparation of dried fruits—raisins, currants, apricots, apples, &c, —
besides sericulture, the growth of the olive, and its manufacture into oil.
Look at our superabundance of garden and dairy produce, not to speak
of animal food. Apples, wholesale, is. to is. 6d. a bushel for the finest
fruit—such in fact as can only be matured on walls in England,
Tears the same. Grapes, halfpenny per lb, ; strawberries, 2d. per lb.;
raspberries, 3d. ; gooseberries, 2s. 6d. per bushel of 50 lbs.; and
oranges, 6d. to is. per dozen. Butter in the plentiful season could
be bought at from qd. to 6d. per lb. ; and mutton and beef, at
all seasons, at from to 4d per lb. for the choicest pieces.
We have a fleet of magnificent ships —regular traders—which could
accommodate a large additional number of passengers, and instead
of resorting to the old plan of chartering ships to carry emigrants,
the Government should employ these. The advantages of this colony
as an eligible place of settlement should be made known over the length
and breadth of the British Isles, and if this is done, and the assistance
given which I have suggested, I have no doubt we shall get our fair
share of those who seek a home in the Southern Hemisphere. I feel
f om what I hear that the country is ripe for this movement, and as
Parliament cannot very well take the initiative I would suggest that a
memorial be got up without delay, praying the House or the Govern-
ment to take immediate steps for the resumption of immigration in such
a way as in their wisdom they may think best.
If copies of the memorial were to be distributed to District Councils
and the various Post-Offices thoughout the settled districts, I have no
doubt many thousand signatures would be affixed. The time for writing
or talking is gone past; we must now be up and doing.—l am, Sir, &c.,
GEO. McEWIN
Glen Ewin, March 26, 1872.
At the end of 1871 the total area alienated from the Crowix
was 4,621,956 acres, of which 416,650 had been taken upor
deferred payments. Last season 692,505 acres were under wheat
■See Agriculture and Live Stock Statistics, 1871-2.


Pastoral pursuits are followed mostly beyond the areas set
apart for agriculture. Wool figures to a large amount as an
export, in 1871 reaching —the growth of 4,412,055
sheep. Mr. H. Schwartze in his annual wool price s-current for
January, states the importation into the United Kingdom
from South Australia to be as follows :
1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872
Bales.
40,609-45,505-40,696-45,901-55.173-65.137-68,679-65,960-70,522
Weight of bales from 350 to 420 lbs. in grease.
The vine is cultivated extensively ; the annual production of
wine was stated by Mr. Boothby in 1870 to be 801,694 galls., and
in 1871 852,315 galls., and the average per acre, 140 galls. The
area under vines is 5,455 acres.
Jams are manufactured from the choicest fruit and at a price
that admits of their exportation to England.
Meat preserving establishments consume the surplus mutton
and beef, selling the best of meat, free from bone, at sd. per lb.
In 1871 the quantity shipped from the colony amounted to very
nearly 10,000 cwts.
MINES AND MINING.
[By J. B. Austin, Esq.]
Perhaps no country on the face of the globe is richer h, deposits
of the most useful metallic ores than South Australia. Copper and
iron are distributed with lavish profusion. Lead, combined in greater
or less proportion with silver, is also abundant, and many other metals
have been found, but not worked to any great extent. Plumbago exists
in considerable quantities, and in various localities, but hitherto it has
not been worked to much advantage. Gold is extensively diffused, but,
up to the present time, no large and rich deposit of the precious metal
has been discovered. Native silver has also been met with, and although
no silver mine is known as such, it is probable that before long the
discovery of one may be announced. A small portion of cinnabar was


found here many years ago, and tin in minute quantities has also been
picked up. A peculiar ore was brought to an assayer in Adelaide more
than 12 months since, and pronounced after trial to be nickel, but others
disputed the correctness of the statement. A considerable deposit of
bismuth was discovered in October, 1862, on a section about five miles
from Yudanamutana, belonging to the Northern Mineral Asssociation.
Tellurium and cobalt are also said to have been found in small quantities;
the latter exists in combination with copper in some of the mines.
Antimony, asenic, zinc, manganese, barytes, strontium, complete the list
of metallic ores as far as at present known in the colony. Sulphur exists
considerable quantities, both pure and in combination with other
substances.
Then Mr. Austin enumerates the principal copper mines, the
“ Burra” discovered in 1845, fr° m which was raised in 23 years
220,173 tons of ore, averaging 22 per cent, equal to 49,310 tons
of copper, returning large dividends to the proprietors for 17
years, and which after a supension of work through the superior
attractions of the gold diggings to the miners, has lately resumed
active operations, and the payment of Dividends.
The “Moonta” discovered in 1861 wuthin 10 miles of Port
Wallaroo, and in which four or five lodes of surprising richness
have been worked, the dividends to October 1872 amounting
to a total of ,£744,000.
The “ Wallaroo ” mines are owned by a private company,
situate near the last-mentioned, and supposed to be as rich in
mineral deposits, but no reports are published.
The Paramatta, Yelta, Bremer, New Kanmantoo, Wheal
Hughes, Doora, Poona, Talisker, Hamley, Prince Alfred, Euko,
Yudanamutana, and many others are being worked, several
returning good dividends.
Land for Mining is let by the Government at 10/ per acre
per annum, in blocks of 40, 80, or 160 acres.
Mr. Austin in his “ Mines of South Australia,” states that the
whole of the hilly districts extending through 7 degs. of latitude,
abound in minerals at intervals seldom exceeding a distance of 25
miles.

APPENDIX.
Since this pamphlet was in type, advices from the Colony to
January, 1873, have been received, and a year of unexampled
prosperity has commenced. The most abundant harvest that
South Australia has yet seen has been secured, and is estimated to
average from 15 to 16 bushels per acre ; the quantity for export
to be fully 8 million bushels of wheat, or 200,000 tons after suf-
ficient has been kept for food and seed.
The other great staples of Wool and Copper are flourishing;
the pastoral interest having experienced a most propitious season,
and the mines are in full work, with fresh deposits in course of
development.
Under date January 2nd, 1873, the South Australian Register
states —Copper mining is prospering. A new lode, reported to be
extremely rich, has been discovered on the Moonta property.
The amount paid in wages at the Moonta Mine exceeds
a month.
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.
Comparative statement of the declared value of imports and
exports at Port Adelaide during the first 51 weeks of 1871 and
1872 :


Labour has been in such demand that £2 per week with rations
(board) have been the wages paid during harvest operations. The
average rates of wages given in page 9 are maintained, and in
several cases higher at certain seasons, but such being exceptional,
are not reliable. During the shearing season from September to
December, it is a common occurrence for shearers that commence
in the far northern sheds and work southward through several sheds,
to earn from to 10s. per week for periods extending from
Bto 12 weeks. Shearing is easily learnt by any working man in a
couple of weeks.
Tea, Sugar, Coffee, Rice, and other leading groceries, imported
direct from the East, are cheaper in Adelaide than at most retail
shops in England.
Slop clothing, Boots and Shoes, Blankets, Bedding, and most of
the plain useful drapery goods are very little dearer than in London.

THE IMMIGRATION ACT, 1872.
LAND ORDER WARRANTS AND LAND ORDERS.
I. Emigrants having been approved as suitable by an Emigration Agent
proceeding direct from Europe to South Australia, and paying the whole cost of
their passages, or persons paying the passages of such emigrants, are entitled to
receive a land order warrant.
2. On the arrival of the aforesaid emigrants in South Australia, each person
entitled shall receive from the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration
a land order in exchange for each land order warrant (see Schedule 1) of the
value of twenty pounds for every adult above twelve years of age, and ten pounds
for every child between the ages of one and twelve years.
3. The above land order will be immediately available in cases where the
holder desires to occupy and reside on the Crown Lands and cultivate the
same, and will be received as payment, or part payment, of interest on the
purchase money of any land open for selection under any Act of the Legislature
then in force.
4. The land order may be immediately available for the purchase of any
land open for sale ; but no land grant from the Crown will be issued until it is
proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration
that the emigrant for whose benefit the land order was issued, and the holder
of such order as well, have resided continuously for two years in the Colony.
5. In cases of death the Governor in Council may issue the land grant, after
the expiration of the said two years, to the representative of the person who
would otherwise have been entitled thereto.
6. No alien will be entitled to receive a grant for any such land unless such
alien has become a naturalized subject of Her Majesty the Queen.
7. After the expiry of two years from continued residence in the Colony by
the holder of any land order, and on proof of such residence being given to the
satisfaction of the said Commissioner, such land order may be transferred by
endorsement.
NOMINATION OF EMIGRANTS.
i. Any subject of Her Majesty resident in the Colony may nominate any
suitable person for a passage from Europe, and on paying to the said Commis-
sioner the sum set forth in Schedule 11. according to the scale herein specified,
the person so nominated will be entitled to receive a passage on being approved
by any Emigration Agent.


2. All persons so nominating will have the option of paying the balance of
passage money within twelve months after the arrival in South Australia of the
persons nominated, such passage money not to exceed fifteen pounds per statute
adult, and such payment will entitle the persons nominating to receive a land
order of the value of twenty pounds, which land order will be available in the
same manner and for the same purposes, as land orders granted to persons
paying their own passages without assistance from the Government : Provided
that, within thirty days after the arrival of the-person so nominated, notice in
writing shall have been given to the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immi-
gration of the intention to pay such balance of their passage-money.
LAND ORDERS GRANTED TO SHIPPERS, COMPANIES, ASSOCIATIONS,
OR SOCIETIES.
Any person or persons, company, association, or society desirous of bringing
out to South Australia, at his or their own expence, suitable emigrants from
Europe, approved by any emigration agent, for the purposes of settling on the
Crown Lands thereof and cultivating the same, or for engaging in any colonial
industry, and who shall enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of
Crown Lands and Immigration for the conveyance of such emigrants from
Enrope to South Australia for the purposes aforesaid, and also enter into a
covenant with the said Commissioner that such emigrants shall reside con-
tinuously in the said Colony for two years at the least from the date of their arrival,
shall be entitled to receive, on the arrival of such suitable emigrants in the said
Colony (and, if aliens, after naturalization) a land order in the form contained
in the Third Schedule hereto, which land order shall be of the value of sixteen
pounds sterling for each adult emigrant, and a land order of the value of eight
pounds sterling for each child between the ages ot one and twelve years of age ;
and every such land order shall be immediately available for the purchase of
any waste lands of the Crown which may be offered for sale, or which may be
open to selection for cash or on credit in any part of the said Colony.
MONEY ADVANCE.
Upon deposit of a land order by the original holder at the office of the said
Commissioner, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner to advance to him
a sum equal to one-fifth of the nominal value thereof, and upon repayment at
any time within two years of the sum so advanced, the said land order shall be
returned to him.


ASSISTED PASSAGE REGULATIONS.
Under which settlers may obtain assistance out of the Public Funds towards the
introduction to this Colony from Europe, of persons in aid of the cost of
whose passages they may contribute certain sums.
CONDITIONS.
I. Any person in Europe, approved by an Emigration Agent, desirous of
procuring a passage to South Australia for himself, or for emigrants being of
the undermentioned classes, coming within the following regulations may effect
that object by contributing such sums of money named hereunder. (For
application forms, see Schedule iv.)
2. Any person resident in this Colony, desirous of procuring a passage from
Europe to South Australia, of any emigrants of the undermentioned classes,
coming within the following regulations, may effect that object by contributing
such sums of money named hereunder. (For application forms see Schedule IV.)
3. On production of the Treasury Receipt at the Crown Lands and Immi-
gration office, Adelaide, a certificate will be issued guaranteeing passages to an
equivalent number of persons as per scale hereunder, and on presentation of
the certificate to the South Australian Emigration Agent in London, provided
they are approved on inspection by such Emigration Agent, passages will be
provided.
4. The certificate will have twelve months currency, will be transferable,
and in no case will the contributor have any portion of the money paid refunded
to him ; but in order to prevent any injustice arising through the non-emigra-
tion of any of the persons for whose benefit the certificate was in the first
instance obtained, the Emigration Agent will receive, in Britain, any money
balance which may be required under the regulations, to entitle the persons,
who actually claim under the certificate, to passages.
5. Any emigrant, or person nominating the same, under the Assisted Passage
Regulations, who shall within thirty days after the said emigrant’s arrival in
this Colony, apply in writing to the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immi-
gration, to be allowed to pay the balance of his or her passage-money (which
shall not exceed, in the whole, the sum of fifteen pounds for every statute adult)
and shall also pay the balance of such passage money within twelve calendar
months from the date of such application, shall be entitled to a land order of
the value of twenty-pounds sterling for each person of twelve years of age and
upwards, and of the value of ten pounds sterling for each child between the
ages of one and twelve years.

proceeds to the Colony, or on whose account there shall have been paid to the
Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, in this Province, or some
authorised person in his behalf, a sum to cover the passage money, shall be
allowed a passage in the said ship, provided that such person is in good health,
and not likely to become chargeable on the Province, and that he or she sign
an agreement to conform to the rules to be observed on board ship.
APPLICATION AND APPROVAL.
12. The first step is to address the Emigration Agent in London for an ap-
plication form (Schedule vi.), which must be accurately filled up and returned
to the officer issuing the same. The candidates will be informed whether or
not the passage can be granted. If it can, they will as soon as possible receive
an embarkation order from the Emigration Agent (which is not transferable),
naming the ship in which they are to sail, and the time and place of joining her.
OUTFIT, &C.

'feather beds, firearms, and offensive weapons, wines, spirits, beer, gunpowder,
percussion caps, lucifer matches, and any dangerous and noxious articles, cannot
be taken by emigrants.


LAND ORDERS.
Regulations under which Land orders, available in the purchase of Crown Lands,
may be claimed, where immigrants have paid their own passages, or paid by
others.
Persons arriving from Europe, or who may introduce from Europe, at their
own cost, immigrants of either of the classes specified in the Assisted Passage
