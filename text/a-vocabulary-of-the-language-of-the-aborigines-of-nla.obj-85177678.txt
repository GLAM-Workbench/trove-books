PREFACE,
It was my intention to give by way of introduction to the
following pages, a sketch of the state of the Aboriginal Tribes
of South Australia, so far as we at present are acquainted with
them ; and to have arranged what little information we have
respecting them, into something of a regular form. Their
various tribes, their localities, their modes and rules of warfare,
their superstitions, domestic habits, amusements, artificial pro-
ductions, and methods of procuring subsistance, are all
interesting subjects; and would furnish materials for an
extended essay. But I have laid aside my original intention,
for two reasons, which I trust will be thought sufficient as
an apology.
In the first place, our present imperfect means of communi-
cation with the aborigines, render it a very difficult matter t»
obtain any accurate information on many of the most inter-


csting subjects; and, it lias constantly occurred, that as we
have acquired a more intimate knowledge of their language,
and of individuals, we have obtained new and different
explanations of many of their habits and customs. Added to.
this, there appears to be a purposed concealment of many
things, especially by the more intelligent, which frequently
baffles the most cautious enquiries. They can see the supe-
riority of the civilized white man over the untutored black ; and
as they daily witness that to inform the settler of a practicable
road, a fertile plain, or a good water-hole, is to open the
resources of their country to others, and tends to widen the
encreasing circle of the stranger’s permanent possessions; so
they appear to think that to give him also a full insight into
their language and their customs, would be to strip themselves
of what little power and authority still remains within their
grasp.
They have yet to learn that we offer them a full equivalent;
and to be taught how greatly they would benefit by the ex-
change. A length of time, great patience, and unceasing
perseverance, will be requisite to instruct them fully in this
lesson —and until it is begun by us, we cannot expect to over-
come their unwillingness to teach us in return what little we
are curious to know respecting them. It was thought, there-
fore, that much which would be introduced into such a sketch,
would be defective, and perhaps erroneous ; and that it had
better be postponed until further and more careful efforts had
been made to add to our information, and to correct or to
verify what is known already.
VI
PREFACE.


My second reason lias been, that circumstances have com-
pelled me to postpone this publication far beyond the time
originally intended, and that to delay it further, for any
extended introduction, would possibly deprive it of what may
be thought its only merit; —viz.,-that it affords the means of a
communication with the natives, at a time when the impor-
tance of such means is growing daily more apparent.
Happily, we have not yet* to record in the history of our
colony, any interruption to the general harmony which has
distinguished our intercourse with the native population; but
even the trifling and petty charges that have in one or two in-
stances been made against them, may be almost always traced
to the mutual ignorance of the parties as to the habits, notions,
and intentions of each other. Now that our flocks are so
widely spreading away from the seat of authority, and are ex-
posed to the attacks of the natives in proportion to their dis-
tance from the means of legal protection, it becomes a matter
of great importance, that no erroneous idea of their movements
or misconception of their intentions, or of ours, should lead to
any hostile measures —and I have therefore determined to
waive every other consideration, and without delay to publish
* These few remarks were in type before the late melancholy occur-
rences. Yet in recording the murder of three white men by natives,
and that apparently without any provocation, let it be remembered,
that the parties supposed to be the criminals are of a distinct tribe from
that immediately surrounding us, and that the latter willingly lent their
aid to the capture of the culprits. Had our intercourse with the natives
of the Para been systematically commenced and properly established
before we attempted to occupy their territory, it is possible the late
atrocities might not have occurred.
vii
PREFACE.


the following vocabulary, in a much more imperfect form than
was originally proposed.
I have not thought it necessary to distinguish the variations
which will be found slightly to affect many of the words when-
ever they are used by a different tribe to that immediately
surrounding Adelaide. Each tribe has a different dialect
but none within 60 miles, differ so much as to be unintel-
ligible. To note all the minute variations, would have
been a work requiring considerable time. I have likewise
omitted any attempt at giving a grammatical form to the
language. Its structure is much more artificial than the
character of the people would lead us to expect; and will
require more time and information to elucidate correctly.
In concluding this short notice, I would venture to express
my hope, that the amicable footing on which we have hitherto
stood with our sable brethren, may continue; and my opinion
that nothing will more conduce to this desirable end, than by
acquainting ourselves with their language, to communicate our
wants and wishes to them—and to learn, and as far as possible
to attend to theirs. I have scarcely ever known an individual
among them to make an ungrateful return for a personal kind-
ness ; but I have seen many instances, where even trifling
assistance ahd attention has won their confidence at the
moment, and been remembered a long time afterwards.
