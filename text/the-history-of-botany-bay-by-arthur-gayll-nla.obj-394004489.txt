THE AUSTRALIAN INSECTICIDE
This is the only genuine Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to all kinds of Insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal life, and
therefore may be used without the slightest apprehension.
For the extermination of MOSQUITOS espec'ally, the Insecticide has no equal —as the fumes of the burnt powder, while throwing off a pleasant
odour, are the same time most destructive to them.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
FOR MOSQUITOS . —Place a little of the powder on a fire-shovel or piece of tin, light it, and allow it to smoulder until the room is well fumigated.
FOR MOTHS, SILVERFISH, «Sc. —The powder should be placed at the bottom of drawers and boxes, or sprinkled on the articles before storing.
FOR FLEAS, ISI ES, Ac. —Place under carpets, and insert in crevices of bedsteads and the stuffing of furniture.
FOR COCKROACHES.—SprinkIe in places frequented by l hem.
ANIMAL VERMIN. —For destroying insects on Fowls, Fan -y Birds, Dogs, &c., it is unequalled.
TO STORE FURS.—The best way to store furs is to sprinkle them well over with the powder and keep in tin boxes.

mosquito cure.
“ Now that the Summer approaches, and the mosquito is girding up his loins to make the evening a burden to suffering humanity, and sleep, a
thing to be longed for, but seldom realised, we feel we are doing good service, and acting the part of public benefactors by drawing attention to a prepara-
tion called IHE Australian Insecticide. It is is the form of a powder, which on being allowed to smou der, emits an odour pleasing to human beings,
but so distasteful and destructive to mosquitos and other insect pests, that it speedily rids the room of them. This article is manufactured only by
Messrs. W. and T. Williams, Chemists, 257 King-street, Newtown, and Howick-street, Bathurst. It has been some time in use and we can
confidently recommend it.”

The surprising progress, and great achievements of this Office, are the best proofs of the public confidence, and the high esteem placed upon the
Company’s liberal dealings. 19,667 New Policies were issued by the Company during the past year, being a larger number than ever issued
by any other Australian Life Office in one year.
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT
Premiums accepted from One Penny per week upwards. Life Assurances and Endowments for Adults and Children. The Company having
a large and well-organised Staff of Collectors for receiving the Premiums from Policy-holders in their district, the trouble usually attached to remitting
the premiums direct to the office, ia entirely done away with. Policies and Premium Receipt Books are issued Eree of Charge. No Entrance Fee.
ORDINARY DEPARTMENT
Policies issued with or without Profits, payable at death, or on attaining a given age.
TEMPERANCE SECTION.
To encourage the growing desire in favour of a Special Class of Assurance, by a large and increasing number of persons in the community who
profess and practice the principles of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, a distinct section has been established in which only total abstainers are
assured. On medical testimony and published statistical information is based the contention that such abstinence is greatly conducive to longevity, and
to the limitation and prevention of numerous diseases. It is recognised that those persons for whom this new section is inaugurated will naturally
consider themselves entitled to enjoy whatever increased assurance benefit, in the shape of additional profits, which may arise from the lower rate of
mortality that is claimed as one result of their abstinence. The profits, therefore, of this section will be divided only amongst those assured within it,
who adhere to the practice of total abstinence principles.
UNCHALLENGEABLE POLICIES.
All Policies issued by this Company are unchallengeable from their date, and when the age of the assured has been admitted, are indisputable on
any ground whatever, so long as the Premiums are duly paid. These important concessions to the assured will greatly enhance the value of their
Policies as family provisions or securities in connection with business contracts.
CLAIMS
Are payable upon production of proof of death and title. Promptitude and liberality in settlement of all claims has always been a distinguishing feature
of this Company. Send for list of claims already paid and specimens of published testimonials for prompt settlement.
Full Prospectuses, Last Annual Report, and every information may be had on application.

“ «xih.o B'dlletlza.’s ”
'ustrated History of Botany Bay.
Eveet year in Australia sees another stage in the formation of a population as different from that of thirty Or forty years ago as that of the United States
of to-day is from the early Spanish settlers, or the Pilgrim fathers of New England. A history of Australia has not been written for the new people—
yet. These new people are the nucleus of the coming Australian nation —not the descendants of old Imperial officialdom, or of the people whom that
officialdom ruled. Unfortunately, however, the traditions of the past survive in Australia, while the events that fathered those traditions are forgotten.
The result is that Young Australia finds itself dominated by the surviving remnant of a class whose history will make the Australian people of the near
future burn their records and pray for a tidal wave.
A look-out on Australia to-day will disclose a strange state of things. Upwards of three millions of people, in one of the finest countries in
the world, have a chance in the struggle for existence the peer of which no other spot on the globe save Eden has ever seen. But these three millions of
people, with their popular democratic institutions, are governed in the interests of a small class by a little knot of men who rule in the name of the people
but on the lines of the strictest and narrowest conservatism. We have in Australia our manhood suffrage, vote by ballot, the jury system, popular legis-
latures, and all the marks of an advanced political spirit. Yet , side by side with these we have rankly flourishing and openly encouraged, all the
inequality of social conditions, the invidious class distinctions, the great monopolist property in land, the old feudal spirit in our property laws, and the
mark of the same old familiar bloody hand in our penal legislation, that the free institutions we have just named were deliberately invented by English
Liberals as political weapons to destroy.
The crude anomalousness of all this is patent. But it only requires to be looked at through the history of the past to be at once whistled
down the wind. We have clothed the ass’s body of social conditions and feudal-law traditions in the lion’s hide of pseudo-democratic institutions. When
the lion is expected to roar, we only hear the other animal bray. We are still ridden by the influence and ruled by the lineal descendants of the squalid
officialdom of the grisly past. The whistle of the lash and the clank of the convict’s chain are still distinctly heard, though fifty years have passed away
since transportation ceased, and a democracy of freemen has been settled by immigration in Australia. The reason is, in a word, that the men of the class
that came into existence under the Imperial regime made the most of their time. They founded family fortunes, and became territorial magnates and
lords of the soil. They seized on the ownership of land, and established the principle of such ownership, and so consolidated a power and an influence
that have enabled them to hold their position up to the present, and to buy up the dangerous leaders of democracy, body and soul.
Australian public spirit touched its highest level in Victoria under Graham Berry when he swept the country from end to end on an election
cry for the bursting-up of big estates. That is the pivot on which the Australian politics of the future will turn. But the question will never stand out
in a white lightuntil Young Australia learns who the founders of big estates and vested interests were, and how these estates and interests grew
Young Australia will never learn that until the history of the past is candidly and fearlessly told. But when it is so told, and the lesson learnt, then
Young Australia will have also learnt the profound truth that these colonies will never get rid of the taint of a squalid officialdom, built up by the exercise
of gaolers’ authority over a herd of cruelly-abused wretches whose crimes were outweighed by their expiation, until the Imperial connection which
rivets the past on the present for us becomes an exploded myth, and these colonies of ours form federated states Tinder an independent Australian flag.
The Imperial connection keeps the Past in its place. While it continues the public life of Australia will continue to be ridden by the hoi'ror of the past
—the nightmare of our history —as Sinbad the Sailor was by the Old Man of the Sea. Australia’s own history, fairly told, alone can strip the bandage
from her eyes. When that is once done the Imperial connection must go.
This is why The Bulletin is going to tell the history of Australia from its own point of view. The past has been veneered over by wealth
from the gold discovery, and by free institutions that came full fifty years before their time. The Bulletin is going to scrape off that veneer. It is
time that the theories of the people who want to engraft British feudalism on Australia were tested by a cataclysmic visitation of fact. Flying literary
visitors like J. A. Fronde mercilessly instruct us in our domestic concerns in the light of a ten days’ experience of one side of one narrow colonial class
alone. Two or three Australian politicians meet in the cabin of an English admiral and concoct a conspiracy by which British militarism shall be
engrafted upon our system for ever and a day. Shotted rifles menace a public meeting because those who object to an address to the Queen on her
Jubilee outnumber those who don’t. Politicians who claim to hold democratic faiths threaten drastic legislation to crush the advocates of unpopular
views which are unpleasant to the ear of official authority. And a surviving representative of Vandemonia proposes in his old age ** a whiff of grape”
as his prescription for Young Australia when she writhes under the intolerable burden of her Old Man of the Sea. All this, would be a screaming farce
if it were not so gruesomely serious. Our people’s ignorance of our own people is abysmal. We have had poets and politicians, preachers and pseudo-
patriots, penal laws and public institutions of a class the like of which —thank the gods ! —have’never been seen before since the crust hardened on the
earth. These phenomena spring from certain pre-existing causes. If the hair of the reader should happen to stand on end when we tell him what these
grisly causes were, we are not to blame. We did not make our history. We only tell it. We merely flay the carcase of the hybrid and moribund
monstrosity now on our demonstrating table, and dissect the congested organism underneath.

THE HISTORY
CHAPTER I.
What Providence Intended.
When Henry Kingsley wrote his book
about Australia for British readers, he told
them of a great, lone, melancholy island in
the pleasant southern seas —the largest and
possibly the grandest island in the world.
The land of lonely rivers and level gray
plains, he called it ; the land of wool and
corn, incalculable to the human mind ; the
land of gold and jewels. “ Who were to
have this wondrous land?” he asks, “which
lay for thousands of years asleep in a summer
sea, waiting for its owners.” With all the
purblind saponaceousness that even good
men exhibit when writing about Australia,
he gives the answer : “ Providence designed
that country for us !” ,
If the Australian people of the near future
know anything about that matter, Pro-
vidence designed nothing of the kind. It is
only the smug Englishman of the type that
sung “Britons never shall be slaves,” while
not one man in one thousand had a vote or a
voice in public affairs—who fought the
battles of England abroad to take his atten-
tion off his own domestic miseries at home,
that could answer for the designs of Pro-
vidence in this flippant and familiar manner.
The John Bull of the past, who looked on
the great world-system of waters as a British
lake, and on Divine Providence itself as a
vulgar British institution, alone could fall
into such an egregious error as that. If
Providence had any design in the matter at
all it was that the great Australian con-
tinent should belong to a great Australian
people, ruling itself under its own laws, and
. free as Providence possibly intended every
man and every nation do be. We can
imagine Providence designing that a great
people should grow up here, with all the
mistakes of old-world legislation and class-
traditions for its warning, and with all the
prevehtible old-world miseries, poverty, and
ignorance that those traditions and that
legislation have developed into rank growth,
for its beacons of quicksands to be avoided.
So much for Mr. Henry Kingsley and his
rapidly-expiring class.
Away back at the beginning of the ter-
tiary period, Australia was joined to China
by a broad land-belt. Presently a convul-
sion of nature occurred. The land-belt dis-
appeared and water flowed in its place.
AN EARLY ENGLISH DISCOVERER.
Australia “ cut the paihter” and floated
away, as it were, on its own career of inde-
pendtace. Wallace’s line on the map
marks where the rupture took place. Had
it not occurred, we might have been all

eminent in grief and in wealth \ and sitting

at the feet of the wise Confucius instead of
burning incense to our Old Man of the Sea.

But our Chinese cousins had another
chance, and missed it. Long after palaeo-
lithic man had passed away, a Chinese junk
burst into these silent seas, with youth at
the prow and pleasure at the helm, to the
sound of the inspiring tom-tom. Old
legends tell how the grisly apparition of
these adventurous children of the Sun
affrighted our “peaceful southern ocean”
like a nightmare, as it passed on its myste-
rious way. We said just now that the
Chinese had their chance, and missed it.
That was a rash assertion. The enterprising
navigator of that prehistoric junk, scanning
the future with dim prophetic eye, saw that
Australia had better be left for some other
active persons to do the rough work of
colonisation, and after that his bland and
patient Celestial descendants might come
along without ruffling an eye-lash, and scoop
the whole institution like the merest fan-tan
pool. He knew who it was Providence de-
signed the “ pot” for.
The Chinese sharp-shooter sailed away.
He was our prehistoric ancestor, and doubt-
less his statue will occupy a vacant pedestal
by-and-bye, when those of Victoria Wettin
and Albert the Good are melted down into
copper coin, to compensate the holders of
great freehold estates which will have been
confiscated for the benefit of the Australian
people. When our ancestor faded away over
the horizon, the “great, lone, melancholy
island” had a rest for a time ; and, by the
way, when the reader digests this history he
won’t wonder any more why it was ‘ ‘ melan-
choly.” Two hundred and eighty-two years
ago a picturesque Spanish freebooter, named
De Quires, paid it a visit. He also went
away. The Dutch looked in about the same
time. They also left—but in a hurry this
time. The unanimity our early visitors


showed in going away is striking. But to do
these Dutchmen bare justice, they had good
reason for their action. Their it
appears, was not altogether hospitable. The
aboriginal inhabitants began to hatch a
quaint suspicion that Providence designed
the great lone, melancholy island for them.
So they fell upon the cx'ew of the Dutch yacht

picnicked airily on the remains. The unpro-

INTERIOR.
nounceable name of the vessel is their best
apology. It must be confessed that their
notion about the design of Providence was a
crudely practical one.
But if the pure Chinese strain wasn’t
crossed with Dutch blood—if we don’t all
wear wide knickerbockers and pig-tails to-
day and smoke big pipes and play the tom-
tom —it is largely owing to the patriotic
action of those impulsive aboriginals, and the
hazy nature of their theological views. For
the Dutch certainly left Australain soil in
some precipitation before De Quiros’ lieuten-
ant struck Cape York and named Torres’
Straits. In all probability both expeditions
imagined that Providence designed this
country for them. Dirk Hartog, another
Dutchman, touched at Endraght’s Land ten
years later. Quite a locust-flight of flying
Dutchmen found Australia in the next de-
cade, from Zeachen down to Peter Nuyts.
Tasman’s visit was in 1642. He wrote his
sweetheart’s name all over the Australian
map, and made it historical. This was the
only touch of tender human sentiment the
Island now called after him was destined to
see for many a long day. In later times,
after the horror of our history had held its
Saturnalian orgie—when each blade of grass
: had its horrible story, and every woodland
nook reeked with the strong flavour of bloody
reminiscences—it was found advisable to de-
stroy a good deal of poor Tasman’s lover’s
romance, and change the name of Maria Yan
Diemen’s father for one with somewhat less
pxxngexlt associations. So we called the
island Tasmania—and complacently allowed
the rank growth of old institutions to flourish,
while the name of Vandemonia that recalled
them too keenly became a thing of the past.
But though Tasman made several voyages
there, Pi’ovidence does not appear to have
designed any part of the country for him.
The buccaneer Dampier, of Virginia, was
engaged in a piratical expedition against
some Spanish traders when he struck the
North-West coast of Australia. Eleven years
after, the English Admiralty authorities sent
him out on a voyage of discovery. He had
several theological controversies with the
aboriginal inhabitants about the designs of
Providence, and after his expedition nothing
more is recorded on that subject until 1770.
In the meantime the Spanish De Quiros had
called the continent “ Australia, ” while the
Dutch named it “New Holland.” Fortu-
nately the Spanish name was the one eventu-
ally retained. Dampier came in 1688. It is
well to remark that persons engaged in
piratical expeditions have been striking the
Australian coast very violently ever since.
It is a distressing but characteristic fact
that the discovery of the eastern coast of
Australia was reserved for a person with the
unromantic name of Cook. We have always
been unhappy in our nomenclature. No one
with an inspiriting name of his own would
have thought of calling his discovery by such
an uncouth designation as “ New South
Wales.” And no people that did not glory
in its disgrace would have retained the name
and its dismal associations so long. But the
trail of the serpent, as it were, is over all we
do. Do we soar into sentiment ? Our airy
flight is impeded by the dead-weight of the
past that hangs like plummets on our nobler
parts—so that we have to sacrifice the deli-
cate flower of romance in the story of Maria
Yan Diemen to the necessity of getting rid
of the association the name calls up. Do we,
like Mr. Silas Wegg, drop into poetry ?
A DUTCH DISCOVERER.
Every bushman in this afflicted land scourges
our ears with damnable iteration of platitudi-
nous phrases about the balmy fragrance of
the yellow wattle-bloom, until that Aus-
tralian vegetable has come to have no more
romantic sentiment in association with its
name than the fatuous cabbage or the hypo-
critical onion.

Cook decided the question that had per-
plexed so many explorers without a moment’s
hesitation, and handed the country over to
, ‘‘ my Sovereign, George the Third,” whose
royal progeny—the Prince of Wales and the
Duke of York, uncles to Her Gracious—used

memoirs ; and also how the Commons voted
the Duke of York a pension for his filial piety

Botany Bay ? you ask. Well, nearly every-
thing. We are coming to it now.
•Hr "X -
It is time to revert to Henry Kingsley
“ At about this time (1787) the British Go-
vernment were beginning to find out that
hanging men for petty theft was a large mis-
take. Anyhow, hanging did no good. Trans-
portation was tried, and the great dominion
of Australia founded.” This is crisply put,
but its accord with the “designs of Provi-
dence ” theory is not apparent at a glance.
The simple fact of the matter is that the
penal laws of England at the time, and for
fifty years after, were a black disgrace to
civilisation. Women and children were
hanged for shop-lifting to to the value of a
pocket-handkerchief. Black Monday op-
posite the Debtor’s Door at Newgate will not
bear description. One writer has this on a
quite recent aspect of the subject A
public execution in London was a scene to
fill an observer with something like loathing
for the whole human race. Through all the
long night before the execution the precincts
of the prison became a bivouac ground for
the ruffianism of the metropolis. The roughs,
the harlots, the professional robbers, and
the prospective murderers held high festival
there. The air reeked with the smell of
strong drink, with filthy jokes and oaths and
blasphemy. The moral effect of the scene
was about as great as the moral effect of a
cock-fight. The soul took its flight as if it
were a trapeze performer in a circus. ” The
Government began to think it just as well if
some of them took their flight to New South
Wales. The American colonies, having just
got their independence, refused any more


white labour. A philanthropic proposal to
hand criminals over to the slave-dealers of
Morocco was made in a Christian country,
and rejected. Consignments were sent to
the fever-coast of Africa, where they died
off like sheep, under the lash. So New
South Wales was founded.
CHAPTER 11.
What England Decided.
It was England that first seamed the
white shoulder of Australia with the livid
mark of the lash. It is the people who
wielded that instrument of degradation, and
their descendants, who wish to “ draw the
bonds of Empire closer” to-day. The Im-
perial connection is, therefore, a shameful
one.
It was not a pleasant problem that con-
fronted the British Cabinet just three years
before the French Revolution. A large pro-
portion of the population, cradled into
crime by poverty and ignorance, had been
convicted of more or less serious offences.
It was clearly impossible to hang them all.
Earnest efforts had - been made to meet the
difficulty in this decisive manner, but even
the best intentions sometimes fall short of
adequate performance. The question was
even assuming a more irksome phase. An
official communication, dated from Whitehall,
August 18, 1786, informed the Lords Com-
missioners of the Treasury that the gaols
were crowded, and that it would be neces-
sary to ship the prisoners off somewhere.
The revolt of the American colonies was a
serious bore to my Lords of the Treasury,
for they had for some time past been adding
a yearly sum of £40,000 to the revenue by
selling offenders as white labour to the
planters. Now that market was closed, and
the article became a drug on the purveyors’
hands. The experiment was tried of send-
ing a portion to the fever-coast of Africa.
So many died there that sentence of trans-
portation became synonymous with sentence
of death. But this was cheating the hang-
man, and allowing a fine old British institu-
tion to fall into contempt. This was un-
English. Something else would have to be
done. Clearly, the Lords Commissioner
were deserving of every sympathy. They
received it in the shape of suggestions.
Humane men looked into the question in
the light of their environment, and in the
spirit of the country and of the age. They
embodied their results in a series of pro-
posals that might curdle the blood with
horror. But as it is inadvisable that the
reader should exhaust his capacity for dis-
gust before he comes to our own immediate
record, perhaps these are as well left alone.
The most merciful proposition was one sug-
gesting transportation to Botany Bay. In
1787 a book was published called “ A History
of New South Wales,” the preface to which,
written by a well-known Cabinet-creature of
the 'period—the - Hon. William Eden—
strongly recommended the Botany Bay
scheme. What he there wrote throws light
on the whole aspect of the question ;
“Criminals, when their lives or liberty are
forfeited to justice, become a forlorn hope,
and have always been judged a fair subject
of hazardous experiments. If there be any
terrors in the prospect before the wretch who
is banished to New South Wales, they are no
more than he expects ; if the dangers of a
foreign climate are nearly equivalent to
death, the devoted convict naturally reflects
that .... offended justice, in con-
signing him to the inhospitable shores of
New Holland, does not mean thereby to seat
him for life on a bed of roses.” If the
devoted convict in his natural reflections
ever did lapse into that idyllic train of
thought, he was most woefully mistaken.
Mr. Eden was a philanthropist—save the
mark ! —and a colleague of Howard in a por-
tion of his work of prison-reform. One of
his recommendations reads thus :—“The
more enormous offenders might be sent to
‘forty convicts died on the
Tunis, Algiers, and other Mahometan ports ;
others might be compelled to dangerous ex-
peditions.” All this time the gaol-fever was
carrying off its victims by hundreds. Yet
the process was not quick enough. Mr. Eden
was the first to announce the approval of the
Botany Bay scheme.
There was one -other suggestion made
which deserves mention. Australia, which
escaped from China by a tidal wave, and
from the legendary Chinese explorer by the
foresight of that astute navigator, was again
placed under offer to the Brother of the Sun.
A pamphlet, published in 1785, recommended
that the American loyalists who still cherished
the Imperial conne'ction might be trans-
ferred there. Prison labour was to be placed
at their disposal ; but—“ the settlers of New
South Wales are principally to be collected
from the Friendly Isles and China ; and the
natives, no doubt, may in time be brought
to unite in this society.” History repeats
itself. There is a class in Australia to-day
which still cherishes the Imperial connection
like the American loyalists, and which would
gladly stamp out the democratic element by
drastic legislation, or clear the way by a
“ whiff of grape” for the docile Chinese cheap
labour which might in time “be brought to
unite in this society.”
But this scheme would
not include the natives
—aboriginal, or other-
wise.
< )uce this question
o; locality was decided,
the preparations were
soon made. Viscount
Sydii ey, who was Secre-
tiry of State for the
Colonies, ordered a
convoy and transports
to be got ready. On
April 27,1787, Captain
Phillip received his
commission. In March
the ships began to ren-
dezvous at Spithead.
On May 13 they hoisted
sail. The fleet con-
sisted of a frigate and
an armed tender, six
transports, and three
store-ships. It carried
1015 persons —197 ma-
rines, 28 women, 17
children ; 558 male con-
victs, 192 women, 18
children; and five con-
trolling officers. The
voyage occupied eight
months. Some esti-
mate of the forethought
lavished on the enter- ■
prise may be gathered
from the fact that forty
convicts died on the
voyage, and within
the first five months
of settlement twenty-
eight more followed
them ; while sixty-six
were under medical
„ treatment, and two
hundred were unable
to work. But, as
Mr. Eden would have said, these unhappy
wretches were fair subjects for hazardous
experiment, and the overcharged British
gaols had to be relieved
Arthur Phillip was the son of Jacob
1 Phillip, of Frankfort, who had emigrated to


London, and there earned a precarious sub-
sistence as a teacher of languages. His son
entered the navy at sixteen, and five years
after was at the taking of Havannah in 1761.
Here he was made lieutenant, and post-cap-
tain twenty years later. He saw service in
the French war, in the East Indies, and in
the employ of Portugal. A somewhat left-
handed testimonial to his fitness for his new
duties was borne by Lord Howe when his
appointment was under discussion. “ I can-
not say the little knowledge I have of Cap-
tain Phillip would have led me to select him
for a service of this complicated nature.”
This eulogium appears to have completely
established his fitness as a subject for
ho7(irrlmiO AvnAt>irY» T—l i n
hazardous experiments. His commission
was at once made out. He laid in a private
provision of two puncheons of rum and
twenty cwt. of loaf-sugar, with much port
and porter, and many decanters and glasses
—the official record amply bears out his care
in this particular—and was soon as ready to
colonise a continent as he had been to take
troops to India to fight the French, or to
offer his sword to Portugal. There was no
weak prejudice or delicate coyness about
Captain Phillip.
Captain Phillip was a man with views. In
his blander moments^—before he started, be
if observed—he appears to have formed an
idea that the expedition he was about to lead
was a species of prolonged camp-meeting,
flavoured with an airy soupgon of the Sunday-
sffiool picnic. “During the passage,” he
says in one letter, ‘ ‘ I shall visit the trans-
ports when light airs or calms permit, to see
fiat they are kept clean and receive the
allowance ordered by Government, and at
these times shall endeavour to make them
sensible of their situation.” His plans for
the future were quaint to the verge of the
grotesque. “The women in general,” he
went on, “I shall suppose possess neither
virtue nor beauty.” This is most ingenuously
frank. But such a state of things presented
no difficulty to Phillip. “It may be best if
the most abandoned are permitted to receive
fie visits of the convicts in the limits assigned
them at certain hours ; the rest I should
keep apart by permitting the men to be in
their company when not at work. They will,
I suppose, marry.” Such was the pastoral
Arcadia that the first Governor had in his
mind’s eye—an island valley of Avillon, as
it were, full of bowery hollows crowned with
lawny leas, where never wind blew loudly
—and gentle shepherds ever piped as though
they never would grow old. The vision of
* the impossible creatures who dreamt of
being seated for their lives on a bed of roses
was about to be realised. “ There shall be
no slavery in a free land,” wrote the future
Governor, “and, consequently, no slaves.”
But Captain Phillip naturally did not know
as much of the history of Botany Bay as he
afterwards learnt and helped to make. In
the meantime, our extracts will serve to
show what the original intentions really
were.
The Governor reached Botany Bay first,
on January 18, 1788. The rest of the fleet
came up by the 20th. Phillip showed his
good »ense by preferring Port Jackson to
Botany Bay as the cradle of the settlemenf.
On the 26th all the ships came round and
disembarked their cargoes at the mouth of
the Tank-stream. Like Phillip’s plans, this
has since degenerated, and become the city
sewer. Three royal salutes were fired, the
echoes of which will nob cease to be heard
until the war-ships, for which the Parlia-
ments of all the Australian colonies but one
have unpatriotically pledged the people to
pay a subsidy, salute the Australian flag be-
fore they finally set forth from Australian
waters. Every man then received a pint of
rum, and every woman half-a-pint. A whirl
of festivity ensued, and the first Australian
sun went down in peaceful summer splendour
on a human hell. The Saturnalian orgie had
commenced, and one of the blackest chapters
in the world’s history was fairly opened. The
curtain rose on a new continent, under
circumstances of squalor and degradation
which never in all history had inaugurated
the career of a nation before. As we hastily
cover up and huddle away the historical
picture that shows us the close of the first
Australian day, and the pioneers that Britain
sent us, sunk in their loathsome revelry, we
find it almost impossible to realise, as Mr.
Kingsley would have us believe, that Provi-
dence designed the country for these.
CHAPTER 111.
The Saturnalia Begins—The Beast and
the Beauty.
The mysterious island that had lain for a
thousand years asleep in a summer sea, like
the Sleeping Beauty in the children’s pretty
story, was thus rudely awakened—loo years
ago —by the Beast ! The advanced civilisa-
tion of England had confessed itself a failure.
It had been in labour, and it brought forth a
Calibanesque abortion. The silver trumpt t
of the Prince in the story was exchanged for
the howl of a satyr. It was well that the
centenary of Australia, which reminds of
this, should be fittingly celebrated. It is
easy of comprehension that those interest! d
should have differed as they did about the
method. But the occasion was too pregnant
with lessons and morals for the opening mind
of young Australia to be allowed to pass by.
It has set Australian men thinking about the
past history that others made for them, and
if is only in this way that the problems of
the present and the near future can be
grasped.
A few days after the landing at the mouth
of the Tank-stream, the Governor called his
people together under some gum-trees where
is now Maqquarie-Place, and had the King’s
commission read. Letters-patent for the
establishment of a civil and criminal judica-
ture followed, and something like a first
Charter of Justice was published. There
was a beautiful simplicity about the Philli-
pian cede ; but yet, following the conven-
tional usage of codes, it called for some
marginal references. 'After the manner of
Blackstone and Stephen and other reputable
jurists, therefore, the Governor issued a
popular commentary on his work. It took
the form of the execution of a boy. The lad
was 17 years of age, and he was hanged for
petty theft just six weeks after the fleet sailed
through the Heads. Fate lost no time in re
producing that bloody character of the spirit
of British penal legislation, -which, with other
British products, Australia has since made so
fondly its own.
But Phillip, as we have seen, was not
entirely a brute. The honest savage merely
did what he conceived to be his duty. He
was a captain in the navy of the time that
Marryat lias described. On his own quarter-
deck the captain could do as he liked ; and
there is a droll story of such an officer who,
with fine humour, tarred and feathex-ed one
of his midshipmen, and confined him in a
hen-coop for several weeks. The Service
afforded no redress, and the midshipman had
to resign and sacrifice his career before he
recovered damages in a civil court. The
“cat” and the yard-arm were active disci-
plinary agents, and the seaman was as much
a subject for hazardous experiments as the
Australian colony was now to become.
Phillip, his apologists say, only did his duty
in hanging the boy. Leading colonists said
the same thing one Christmas-tide not long
ago when Governor Carrington refused to
stay the execution of four lads of about the
same age as their pioneer. The horrible
blunder that resulted will blister the national
sentiment until Australia forgets its past,
and vomits its squalid traditions out of its
mouth. But that late episode was consonant
with the whole tenor of the history of Botany
Bay. The old leaven lies deep.
The first law examination of which we
have record occurred soon after. A woman
passed in the practice and theory of the code.
She filched a flat-iron—and went forthwith
and hanged herself in her tent. It would be
idle to enquire what she could possibly want
with a flat-iron at that early stage of coloni-
sation. The philosophical observer is thus
forced back on the abstract significance of
the fact. Viewed in this way, it bears the
most complete testimony to the popular
character of Phillip’s commentary. Not,
every embryotic jurist has such a rapid suc-
cess as this. But then, not every jurist has
such an opportunity.
A fair understanding being thus estab-
lished, the work of colonisation began. Two
French ships under La Perouse had arrived
just after the fleet, and remained two
months. Had they arrived a week earlier
complications might have ensued. But Pro-
vidence, which designed the country for
Caliban, had arranged that the future of
Australia should not fall into the hands of a
people fresh from the partial awakening of
the French Revolution. So the Frenchmen
left, leaving no trace behind but a monument
at Botany Bay which rose forty years later,
a id this entry in a diary now before the
writer:—“The French officers listened to
the proposals of two fair shop-lifters, who
were missed two days after the Frenchmen
had sailed.” Then those who were not sick,
or otherwise disabled, set to work. The
houses for the officers, a soldiers’ barracks,
hospital, convicts’ huts, and a storehouse for
provisions rose slowly, for of those fit to
work few or none had any mechanical quali-
fications. So little care had been given to
the expedition that the first colonists con-


sisted simply of a heterogeneous agglomera-
tion of marines, magsmen, London sharpers,
and cracksmen, and a sprinkling of pick-
pockets. Of farming they knew nothing.
The results came in their natural order.
Dearth of provisions, sickness, famine ; and
by that time all that was left of Phillip’s
island valley of Avillon had vanished as com-
pletely as the boy that was hanged, or the
Frenchmen’s t\Vo fair shop-lifters.
♦ *
The famine came like an angel of mercy
to withdraw the stricken ones from the
horrors that were to come. Those who
escaped with life only preserved it to become
the victims of a rapacity and a cruelty quite
as blind and greedy as the grave. But this
came after. Tire seed sown by the criminal
neglect of the Home Government which ad-
ventured on this hazardous experiment,
began to bear early fruit, and seven marines
were hanged together in 1789 for stealing
bread from the public store. A small party
was sent to Norfolk Island to try to raise
provisions there. Farms, were laid out at
Parramatta, and the site of the present
Botanical Gardens became a farm for the
support of the settlement. But in Feb-
ruary, 1790, only four months’ provisions at
half-rations were left, and presently the
Juliana with two hundred female immi-
grants arrived with the announcement that
the Guardian store-ship, bearing food sup-
plies for the settlement, had been wrecked
at the Cape. Then the Sirius, also bearing
stores, was wrecked off Norfolk Island.
Phillip gave up his own private supplies to
the common stock, and confined everyone to
the same ration. He gave a State banquet
at Government House—a rather better hut
than the others —and each officer brought his
own bread to the sumptuous board, impaled
on the point of his sword !
• * *
From a journal, now extremely rare, pub-
lished by Captain Tench in 1793, we take an
extract here. It will show that the opinion
held by the aboriginals of British institutions
was almost as strong as the British objection
to American political institutions to-day ;
“ A convict was taken in the act of stealing
fishing-tackle from Daringa, the wife of
Colbee. The Governor ordered that he
should be severely flogged in the presence of
as many natives as could be assembled, to
whom the cause of punishment should be ex-
plained. Many of them of both sexes ac-
cordingly attended. . . . There was not
one of them that did not testify strong
abhorrence of the punishment, and equal
sympathy with the sufferer. The women
were particularly affected. Daringa shed
tears, and Barangaroo, kindling into anger,
snatched a stick and menaced the execu-
tioners.” Here was a failure of justice in
its deterrent effect at the very outset. The
sight of a white man under the lash, instead
of having a bmff, British, self-righteous in-
fluence on the savage breasts of these wild
creatures, simply moved one of the women
to tears, and another to menace the execu-
tioners with a stick. The degradation that
a British seaman of the period could endure
with slavish fatalism, or an Australian judge
of Mo-day order with the most placid
equanimity, caused a natural feeling of dis-
gust and abhorrence in savage man in his
own. If England is a great colonising nation
to-day, the fact is due rather to the colonists
themselves than to those who sent them
forth.
It is a pitiful story, this recital of the first
years of our history, and distressing to the
writer as to the reader. But what we have
seen of the steps which led to Australian
colonisation scarcely promised any hope of
better things. While the settlement was
starving, the gaols “at home” were still
belching forth their fetid contents, and the
quicker the convicts were swallowed up by
disease or death, the dangers of the voyage,
or the fate that awaited them in Australia—
the more the expedient proposed to cope
with the difficulties of the dilemma in which
the Lords Commissioners found themselves
was hailed as a proven success. It served
its purpose, and emptied the gaols for a
moment, But it did more. For it colonised
on condition of his receiving a Lieutenant -
colonelcy, failing which he proposed to enlist

sage : —“ I will exert myself to the utmost to
m recruit them with as little expense as pos-
-3 sible, and with as much expedition as it is in
my power.” Major Grose kept his promise.
I His recruiting sergeants scoured the hulks
and the prisons for likely men. The Savoy,
soldiers’ hulk, furnished a large contingent
of men under punishment. Bad subjects
who had been condemned to service in
India were repideved on enlisting in the
new company. “ Characters who have
been disgraceful to every other regiment in
his Majesty’s service,” wrote Governor
Hunter a little later, “have been thought
fit and proper recruits for the New South
Wales Corps.” And, in another place ;
“We find among these, men capable of cor-
rupting the hearts of the best-disposed, and
often superior in every species of infamy to
the most expert in wickedness among the
convicts.” Thirty convicts, who had been
soldiers, were added to the force. Such
were the chosen watch-dogs of Phillip’s
peaceful Arcadian flock.
The officers were fit associates of the men
they commanded. They were common
gaolers, hired to do gaolers’ duty. They
had every qualification for the work. ‘ The
British officer of the period was not likely to
engage in the scramble for a commission in
this glittering corps. These commissions,
therefore, became the spoils of a set of
wolfish jackals, who with few exceptions
were no better than the men themselves.
The Irish political prisoner, Holt, speaks of
them in his memoirs as-“those old tailors
and shoemakers, staymakers, man-milliners,
tobacconists, and pedlars, that were called
captains and lieutenants.” No jackdaw staff
of a militia corps in a burlesque ever ap-
proached this. Yet these men were the
founders of the “first families” of at least
New South Wales and Tasmania. A
cowardly slur on the national sentiment of
Young Australia is often based on the fact
, that the colonies were originally convict
settlements. The best apology that has been
made is that it is not the fault of Young
Australia if its ancestors were sent out by the
best judges. But even this is hardly true.
Major Grose kept his engagement only too
well. It lies open to serious question if he
did not recruit the founders of our first
families with too little regard to expense, and
with rather more expedition than was either
i necessary or desirable.
Wolves eat wolves’ flesh ! It is a carrion
that no other beast of prey will flesh its
fangs upon. But the wolf lias no sentimental
feeling in the matter, and neither had the
officers of the New South Wales Corps for
the caged human wolves they so eagerly
offered to guard. Their record opens at a
chapter of our history where no combination
of invective or epithet can reach low enough
to do justice to the foetid squalor it describes.
But it lias been too often glozed over to be
let alone now.

“ WOLVES EAT WOLVES’ FLESH.”
In January, 1791, the first contingent of
the corps, consisting of 171 men, with a cap-
tain and two ensigns, brought 1900 male and
190 female convicts to Botany Bay. They
to stand by each other and not to suffer a
soldier to be punished for whatever crime he
might commit against an inhabitant. One of
the Governor’s orders puts the matter in this
feebly-deprecatory form : —“ It is natural
enough in every inhabitant of this colony to
entertain apprehensions for the safety of
their persons . . whenever any private
soldier shall think proper to consider them
as persons deserving chastisement.” It was
simply a reign of terror, dominated by an
armed ruffian horde. But where were the
officers who were responsible for the be-
haviour of their men all this time ?
These astute ‘ ‘ old tailors and shoemakers,
staymakers, man-milliners, tobacconists, and
pedlars,” who called themselves captains and
lieutenants, were engaged in another direc-
tion. The officers of this glittering corps
had other cats to whip, and other fish to fry.
We shall see what they were at presently.
Meantime, when' the Governor called on
them to protect him and the inhabitants
from these ruffians—complaining bitterly of
“ the insults which have been offered to me”
—the officers resented his interference. He
belonged to another arm of the service. He

commissions as an ordinary trade investment.
So they at once put themselves in the way of
securing returns. They robbed their men
an d tlie inhabitants with indifference, and
carried on a shameless and usurious trade,
about which we will have something to say
i in its proper place. To secure their influ-

Let us gibbet a few names of officers of
the New South Wales Corps. Besides Major
Grose, we find Captains Nichols, Nepean,
Hethe, Paterson, and Foveaux. The first
and the two last acted as temporary
Governors/ and Foveaux achieved an in-
famous reputation later on as Governor of
Norfolk Island. Then came Lieutenant
M‘Arthur—a colonial Machiavelli who will
take up much of our attention as w r e go on—
Lieutenants Thompson, Abbot, Beckwpith,
Prentice, Rowley ; afterwards came Captain
Kemp, a later Van Diemen’s Land worthy,
who survived to above the age of 90 ; Piper,
Laycock, and others came after. Not all of
these were equally infamous ; but, like the
husbandman in rE,sop’s fable, we will hang
up these foxes with the others for the com-
pany we find them in. Of all the characters
that Dickens has painted, next to Uriah
Heep, that of Claypole was perhaps the most
contemptible. The rank youth yearned to *
give some one a flogging, and arrived at his
ambition at last in becoming a turnkey in a
gaol. These early officers wer£ the Noah
Claypoles of Australian story, with all that
worthy’s penchant for safe petty larceny
superadded. The observer of the pioneers
of the first fleet might Avell have thought
that the world at large could not produce a
set of wretches more lost and degraded than
those. The arrival of the gaolers of the
New South Wales Corps discovered a yel-
lower level. But to degrade the degradation
| and cap the wickedness of the rank-and-file
we must look to the officers themsejves. To
! paint their character from their own records


will be a task as easy as it is repulsive. Yet
it is necessary to revive the history of the
past to get a clear view of the anomalous
position of the Australian social and political
systems of to-day.
Changes had been going on while these
events were taking shape. Phillip had made
repeated applications to be relieved of his
charge, rendered doubly odious by the con-
duct of the officers. He succeeded in getting
away in December, 1792. He received a
pension of £4OO for his services. Australian
writers have taken a delight in printing much
tiresome rubbish about his benevolence and
his forbearance—his temperate, judicious,
liberal, patient labour. Had he been a
Washington instead of a common gaoler of
felons, his eulogists could not have apotheo-
sised his memory more. Himself and his
assistant warders had a more just conception
of the position they occupied. A convict,
on arrival, presented a letter purporting to
come from Baron Hotham, asking considera-
tion for the bearer. The clumsy forger had
addressed Phillip as “ your Honour 1” The I
fraud was at once detected, says Captain
Tench ; for no one but a convict could have j
used such a mode of address to his gaoler.
When the officers of the corps assumed the
Governorship, no title short of ‘ ‘ Excel-
lency” would serve their turn. Let us see
how they used their power when it came.
CHAPTER Y.
The Rum-Selling Corps.
The New South Wales Corps ruled the
colony either directly or indirectly from the
departure of Phillip to the deposition of
PBligh. Major Grose and Captain Patterson
were lieutenant-governors until the arrival
of Hunter, in 1795, In those three years
the corps solidified its position, until it be-
came strong enough, in 1808, to put Bligh
under arrest. Shortly afterwards the corps
was drummed out of the colony in disgrace,
and ordered to England and thence to India
aS a “ condemned regiment.” But the
officers did not go to India. Having led their
men into mischief they deserted their colours,
turned their backs on their followers, and
resigning the commissions they had disgi’aced,
remained behind in the colony and founded
our “ first families.”
We have said that the officers looked upon
the purchase of their commissions as a trade
investment. They were nearly all keen men,
but it was with the keenness of the huxter.
They saw the misery about them, the de-
graded condition of their victims, and their
own great power ; and they proceeded to use
this last to make money out of the other
two. Not one spark of generous or even
common human sympathy with the state of
things they saw around them brightens their
dank and squalid record. With incredible
callousness to the most pitiable forms of
misery they fattened and prospered on the
filth of the time as the raven gorges itself on
the carrion. It would be too Arcadian to
expect any manly protest from such creatures
as these, against the iniquities of the convict
system. It was distinctly to their interest,

power for trade purposes, and to secure the
command of the market they entered into an
infamous bond, binding themselves to treat
through two of their number with the cap-
tains of vessels, for the purchase of their
merchandise, to the exclusion of any person
outside their own ring. They had the privi-
lege of being the first to board vessels arriv-
ing in the harbour. But they knew each
other too well to trust to the mere word of
honour of such British officers as they were.
They instituted a £lOOO forfeit for anyone of
their number who might attempt to effect a
purchase without the connivance of his
fellows. This flagrant conspiracy gave them
the command of the buying market, and left
them at liberty to fix their own retail prices.
It might be thought that the generous, free
spirit of the British soldier would have made
a muddle of such closely-calculated commer-
cial arrangements. But these old tailors and
shoemakers, staymakers and man-milliners,
were not this kind of soldier. The outcry
of the inhabitants soon showed this. They
were everlastingly memorialising, petitioning,
and remonstrating with the Governor for
allowing the daylight robbery to go on. But
as a rule the Governors knew better than to
interfere in any serious mood. When one of
their number did try to make a stand the
“ gentlemen ” of the New South Wales Corps
arose in their indignation, created what they
called a great popular upheaval against the
horrid tyranny that oppressed the groaning
masses, and, rushing the Governor’s bedroom
with a horde of armed and drunken myrmi-
dons, they fished Bligh out from under a bed
and summarily locked him up 1
The thoroughly business-like principles on
which these officers fleeced the settlement
may be gathered from a- few facts. When
Hunter arrived, after three years’ direct rule
by the corps, the Reverend Mr. Johnson,
chaplain of the settlement, preached a little
sermon, in which he exposed the government
of the officers, “their extortion, their
despotism, their debauchery, and the ruin of
the colony, driving it almost to ruin by the
sale of goods at 1200 per cent, profit.” He
congratulated thesettlementonthe “abolition
of the military government.” He might
well do so, but it was not abolished yet. An
extract from Holt’s Memoirs is worth quot-
ing :
“ Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, when a
soldier came to him for his month’s pay,
would usually accost him with, ‘ Well, what
do you want V
“‘I want to be paid, sir,’ the soldier
r ould say.
I “ ‘ What will you have V was always Cap-
tain Kemp’s answer. ‘ I have very good
tobacco, ten shillings the pound, and good
tea at twenty shillings the pound, prints at
eight shillings a yard—’ and so on.
“ If the poor soldier answered, ‘ Sir, I do
not want any of your goods,’ the captain’s
comment was, ‘You don’t! your are a
damned saucy rascal !’ Perhaps then the
soldier would say, ‘ Sir, if you please, give
me half money and half goods.’ But this
proposal was equally objectionable to Captain
Kemp, and generally led to his thundering
out, ‘ Begone, von damned mutinous scoun-
drel, or I’ll send you to the g.u;ird-house and
have you flogged for your impertinence to
your oflicer.’ ”
“ This was the manner,” summarises Holt,
“that these people made their fortunes, by
the oppression and extortion of the soldier,
the settler, and the poor.”
“Their debauchery,” said the Reverend
Mr. Johnson in his little sermons; but the
foul and disgusting story of these men’s
debaucheries and immoralities is so sickening
a recital as to be quite unfit for detailed pub-
lication. A select committee of the Commons
on transportation in 1812 brought out a mass of
information on oath which abundantly proves
the worst that has been said about the New
South Wales Corps. Such a picture of
wanton rapacity, unbridled greed, and bare-
faced robbery of prisoners by their gaolers—
robbery under its most repulsive form—was
never disclosed on oath before.
CHAPTER VI.
Convicts on the Yoyage.
There is a strikingly dramatic picture given
by Dickens in “Great Expectations.” You
remember how he describes the capture of
Magwitch and Compeyson on the marshes ;
and then how Pip from the shore watches
the marines rowing through the fog to the
convict hulk lying out on the gloomy water.
One of the soldiers carries a torch, which
gets dimmer and redder through the mist as
they go. Now the boat reaches the ship.
The re-captured convicts are helped on
board. The marine throws the torch hissing
and spluttering into the sea. There is a
quick flash—and all is dark again. It seems
to the boy that the lives of those convicts
have gone out with it. But both Dickens
and Pip were wrong. The unhappy con-
victs’ miserable lives were recommencing.
They held wonderful unexhausted capacity
for the endurance of hellish torture yet.
The system under which transportation
was first carried on was a disgrace to the
British name, and, so far, it was consistent
with the rest of this grisly story. The work
of carrying convicts was entrusted to con-
tractors, who received sixpence per day for
each convict’s food-allowance, beside a
tonnage rate. It would be impossible to
believe the stories told of the wolfish greed
of these contractors, if they were not borne
out by State papers and recorded facts. The
longer the voyage lasted, the longer the con-
tractors drew their miserable allowance, and
these sixpences were, of course, saved in
cases where the convict died. Thus a busi-
nesslike understanding was established,
under which the human cargoes died off like
rotten sheep. The figures tell the story.
Dr. White, the colonial surgeon who came
out with Phillip, wrote some reports on this
subject. “Of the 939 males,” he says, in
1790, “ sent out by the last ships—the Sur-
prise. Scarborough, and Neptune—26l died
on board, and 50 have died since landing ;
the number of sick this day is 450, and many
who are reckoned as not sick have barely
strength to attend to themselves ; when the
last ships arrived we had not 60 people sick
in the colony.” One hundred and sixty-four
convicts died on the Neptune alone. In
1802, 66 convicts succumbed on one voyage
between Cape Town and Sydney. During
the first eight years of settlement upwards
of one-tenth of the convicts died on the
voyage. The caravan-tracks across the
desert are marked by the bleaching bones of
beasts and men, but the track of these con-
vict ships across the ocean might have been
as easily distinguishable by its line of floating
corpses.
This was not all. “Floating hells” was
the name the convict-ships soon earned.
Crowds of convicts were thrown into the
holds, with little ventilation mid without
supervision. Brutality and irons were the
only means used to enforce order. The
wretched vessels employed were not large
enough to accommodate the number of con-
victs whom the greed of the contractors and
the carelessness of the Government forced
on board. They might well have felt them-
selves handed over to the irresponsible tor-
tures of fiends. If any were over-tortured
and died in consequence, they were easily
thrown overboard. There was no difficulty
about that. Herded like pigs, but not half ,
so well-fed ; half-clothed, and robbed on
board of any comforts a kind hand might
have provided for the voyage ; chained to a
dead body, sometimes, or to a dying man,
and flogged into mutiny and out of it at the
caprice of a drunken skipper, these unhappy
convicts, in their despair, often preferred
the gaping maw of a hungry shark to the
horrors of the prison-ship. The shark, at
least, would use no more violence than was
necessary. But the records show that these
drunken skippers tortured their victims be-
cause they liked it.
If the condition of the men was bad, that
of the females and children was worse.
Under the savage laws of the time women
and girls, often of gentle lives and honest
parentage, were found on board the women’s
ships. “Not a few of the convicts,” says
Bonwick, “ were mere boys and girls of from
13 to 15 years of age.” This is the one
touch of horror wanted to complete the re-
volting picture. The rest of the shameless
story is best indicated by another quotation.
In 1806 Captain Bertram, writing about
these floating Gomorrahs, has this :—“The
captain and each officer enjoy the right of
selection. Thus they continue the habit of
concubinage until the convicts arrive at
Sydney town. Each sailor or soldier is per-
mitted to attach himself to one of the
females.” The reader can fill out the pic-
ture for himself.
Surely no den of infamy or lair of vice
and crime ever equalled the scene presented
by the hold of one of these prison-ships 1
The horrors of the slave-trade have made

Wales Corps, and 60 female prisoners. The creature who saw a chance of saving six-
fish as he made his desperate bid for life and
liberty, only lent a piquant zest to the pro-
ceedings. There was a bond of sympathy
between the shark and the gaoler. On the
summit of the crag was a gibbet, and here
the skeleton of a murderer swung in the
wind, clanking its chains to every breeze
that blew. This dismal sight, as it was pro-
bably the last he saw on English soil—in one
of Hogarth’s pictures you see an example of
the custom that obtained of hanging male-
factors in chains by the sea shore—was like-
wise the first that greeted the outcast’s eyes
as he once more touched land under the
English flag. It was a familiar object, this
dismal scarecrow of civilisation. And the
unclean thing doubtless communicated to
the observant convict a home-like and
domestic feeling, and showed him that his
“Hi
p


comb iri s had not been unforeseen or unpro-
vided for in the strange land that Providence
had designed for him.
The skeleton was that of a cooper named
Morgan. He held crude views as to the
rights of property, and he attempted to in-
vestigate that economic problem and a
colonist’s skull at the same time. However,
this untutored cooper did not investigate by
the aid of legitimately applicable principles.
He used an adze. A boat that went one day
to the North Shore for wood, says the thief-
catcher Barrington, brought back a man’s
hat with blood on it. Further search dis-
covered a body. This good cooper was one
of eight men sentenced to death for divers
offences, and, by way of lending special eelt t
to the proceedings in his case, he was hanged
on a high gallows on Pinchgut rock. In
those days, and for many a long year after,
it was the custom for the gibbetted criminal
to devise a last dying speech and ennfessn n
to his testamentary legatees. As Mr. Morgan
was hoisted into the balmy air, and the vir-
ginal loveliness* of the surrounding scenery
burst upon him in all the magic of its native
charm, that respectable cooper gave expres-
sion to the responsive harmony within his
soul in certain memorable words. “You have
here, indeed, a beautiful harbour 1” said this
excellent man, as he was upset into eternity.
The observation has become historical, and
has been repeated with enthusiasm and re-
ceived with exuberant effusion by all who
love their country ever since. It is probably
apocryphal ; like so many more of the cant
sentiments of history.
‘ ‘ Morgan was ordered to be hung in chains
on the Island Mat-te-wan-ye,” runs the story.
“This spectacle, shocking to’ the refined
mind”—it is Barrington, the pickpocket
turned thief-catcher, who is speaking now—
“served as an object of ridicule to the con-
victs and terror to the natives, who, though
hitherto particularly partial to that spot, now
totally abandoned it.” This is the second
glaring instance of the effect of advanced
British customs on the savage mind. We
have seen already how the flogging of a white
man moved them to anger and to tears ; now
we find them disgusted at the spectacle of a
a malefactor hanging in chains. There is
5 evidently something repellent to the savage
i mind in both the rope and the lash. It is
only under a high-pressure civilisation, where
the rights of property are understood and
maintained, that these adjuncts of order and
, law—so shocking to the refined mind, as this
mawkish thief-catcher would say —become
thoroughly appreciated and intelligently used.
Morgan was hanged in 1796 ; in 1800, Holt,
who arrived then, describes a skeleton in
chains as one of the first objects that met his
, eye. It would be anice question to discuss—
Who was responsible for this desecration of
our beautiful harbour? Not the murdered
man; he f certainly had no voice in the
matter. Clearly not Mr. Morgan; he, in
his modesty, would have been satisfied to
hang anywhere. The blame is at the doors
of the authorities of the time, who, surfeited
with executions and floggings, which doubt-
less palled on their appetites for these
horrors, Capriciously directed the hanging of
f ins wretch on Pinchgut Rock as a pleasant
variation from the beaten track pursued in
these cases. '
Many years after, Dr. Lang complained
bitterly when Governor Denison hewed this
rock away and erected his gingerbread forti-
fications there. It was removing an old
landmark, wailed the Doctor, and effacing a
picturesque feature of the landscape. He
was right. Yet for these very reasons it
would have been better had a feAv ounces of
melanite done the business, and blasted the
crag and its foul associations for ever out of
sight and out of memory. But if a com-
mencement were once made in this way,

had blown the whole seaboard of the colony
into the sea? VV bile such associations remain
it is not to be wondered at that the people
of Sydney continue to be proud of their
historically beautiful harbour. 1
When the hold had been cleared, the con-
victs unchained, and the corpses thrown
overboard, those who survived were ranged
up in three lines on deck. The convict-ship
was surrounded by a fleet of boats, packed
with pardoned pick-pqckets eager to welcome
their newly-arrived acquaintances. No one
was allowed on board. A boat approached
too closely to the ship that carried Holt, and
was challenged by the sentinel. The rowers
did not move away as quickly as the sentinel
desired. “Me levelled his musket, and
fired,”,says Holt; “ the ball passed through
the arm and, then the body of a young man,
who instantly expired. ' When I got on
shore I heard that this man bore a good
character ; the murderer was brought on
shore, tried for wilful murder, and acquitted.
But to save him ffora the vengeance of the
people he was sent to Norfolk Island, where
Divine vengeance followed him, for I saw
him with a deformed frame and covered with
vermin.” The ship was now visited by Cap-
,tain Johnstone and other officers, with privi-
leged spectators. . Captain Johnstone read
from the indent the name of every convict,
offence, sentence, and place of conviction.
Those whose trades nr professions made them
of public use were claimed by the Govern-
ment. Then the officers of the New South '
Wales Corps had their choice. The rest
were scrambled for by the inhabitants, ac-
cording to their position or influence.
» * *
Place anx dames! We have explained
the principle of natural selection that ob-
tained on the women’s ships. It was
repeated when they arrived in port. Lieu-
tenant Bond, of,the Marines, describes what
took place in all its naked brutality. And ,
here it may be observed that whenever, in
such portions of our narrative as this, the
facts and details of Australian story become
too gross and revolting for editorial descrip-
tion, this writer has contented himself with
transcribing the simple words of those eye-
witnesses whom no mock-modesty restrained.
Adam and Eve before the fall were shame-
less from excess of innocence ; these feli-
citous creatures arrived at the same point in
the circle by travelling in a directly opposite
direction.
“ The commissioned officers come on
board,” says Lieutenant Bond, “ and as they
stand upon deck select such females as are
most agreeable in their persons ; who gene-
rally, upon such occasions, endeavour to set
themselves off to the best advantage. In
this state some have been known to live for
years, and to have borne children. The
non-commissioned officers, then, are per-
mitted to select for themselves ; the privates •
next ; and lastly, those convicts who, havirfg
been in the country a considerable time, and
having realised, some property, are enabled
to procure the Governor’s permission to take
to' themselves a female convict.” Thus was
the Scriptural injunction to increase and
multiply obeyed. Yet it is significant that it
was those convicts mly who had realised
some property who were .enabled to “pro-
cure ” the Governor’s permission to follow
the Mosaic counsel, and thus enable their
descendants to boast with realistic truth of
their “ancestors by purchase.” But after
this process of selection had been gone
through, there was still a rejected residuum
left. Lieutenant Bond has no scruple in
telling us how the authorities disposed of
these. “The remainder, who are not thus
chosen, are brought on shore, and have small
huts assigned them ; but, through the want
of some regular employment, are generally
concerned in every artifice and villainy which
is committed.” Then follows a sentence
which, to have its full significance, must be
read beside -what has been said of the officers
of the “rum-selling corps.” “Females of
this description,” it runs, “are usually em-
ployed in selling such cargoes of sliips as are
purchased by the officers.” This unholy
partnership bore its appropriate frfiit in the
disorders, the outrages both illegal and
legalised, and the wholesale executions of
this squalid time.
*


So the convict population entered upon its
inheritance. There is a weird story told by
an old writer, in which he describes how a
dead man regains consciousness beyoi id the
Acheron, and meets again in the world of
shades the forms of those whom he knew in
life, and from whom he thought he had
parted for ever. Some of the most dramatic
passages in Dapte’s “ Inferno ” are descrip-
tive of his meeting with the damned souls of
his Florentine acquaintances in the Male-
bolge pool. The position of the newly-arrived
convict was not dissimilar. It is a dismal
parallel. Dead, and judicially damned by
the savage laws at home—there were over
300 capital offences at the beginning of the
century—he regained consciousness after his
long Styx-like voyage to be in time for his
re-awakening in hell. The tortures were
there, and the damned. One of the first
men Holt saw on his arrival was a man whom
he saw tried, and on whom he had heard
passed the awful sentence of death. Such
encounters were frequent. It was an eerie
world, peopled with criminal ghosts. The
one thing needful was the attendant demons.
But the New South Wales' Corps was there,
so that the demons were never missed.
CHAPTER YIH.
The Convict on Shore.
XHE vJONYICT OJN OHOKE.
“ The greater number of overseers in the
colony,” wrote a man who was himself in
charge of a chain-gang, “ have been criminals
themselves, and hate neither prudence,
honesty, nor humanity. They are ruffians,
who are .actuated and influenced by the
worst passions, and frequently flog an unfor-
tunate wretch for complaining of their op-
pression.” These were the gentle creatures
to whose tender mercies the newdy-arrived
convict was now handed over. When a con-
vict had passed through the horrors of the
voyage, and the Inferno of convictism in the
colony, and had shown to the satisfaction of
his very competent judges that he had been
improved into the lowest grade of brutality,
he was made an overseer of a chain-gang.
By this means the standard of brutality and
barbarism was efficiently kept up. By an
exact analogy, and with a very slight modifi-
cation of, the principle governing the same
process, we find the traditions of convict
government surviving in the colony to this
day, with a criminal code which, for san-
guinary brutality, will compare favourably
with that of any other country in the world—
I with the single exception, perhaps, of
Crim-Tartary.
The labour-gangs were drafted away into the
Parramatta or the Hawkesbury districts, and
set to work in the fields like the beasts of
the same. The political prisoner, Holt, has
a note of something he saw on entering one
of these cultivation-paddocks for the first
time. The Reverend Mi'. Marsdcn—we
must deal with this worthy presently—Mr.
Atkins—the Judge-Advocate, who also

life or professions, unaccustomed to hard
labour. These are a dead-weight on the
public stores.” Barrington’s history, re-
ferring to these men, says : “Notwithstand-
ing the detestation of the crimes many of
them are transported for, yet it was not pos-
sible for the Governor to send a physician,,
the once sheriff of a county, a Catholic priest,
or a Protestant clergyman and family to the
brick-carts, brick-fields, grubbing-hoe, or the
timber-carriage. The lower class of convicts
in these cargoes were mostly old men, fit
only for hut-keepers, to remain at home and
prevent robbery while the other inhabitants
of the hut were at labour, thus making good
the old proverb, ‘Set a thief to catch a
thief.’ ”
Each officer had 10 assigned servants. A
letter to the Duke of Portland contains a
statement that assigned servants ‘ 1 were
allotted to the service of convict prostitute
women.” In the service of private masters
convicts received such bad treatment that
the Government resented this interference
with its privileges, and an order was issued
to the effect that ‘ ‘ if any person should beat
or use their (sic) servants ill they will be
taken from them to Government labour, and
the offender dealt with according to their
situations in the colony,” But if any con-
vict attempted to work for himself while at
assigned service with a view to improving
his condition by-and-bye, he received the
reward of his industry in the shape of 100
lashes and 12 months in gaol. That stopped
him for the time. “ Magistrates,” we read,
would oblige one another as employers in
authorising the removal of obnoxious ser-
vants, or by inflicting lashes for supposed
disobedience of orders—an elastic charge by
which the poor fellow lost the benefit of his
fixity of tenure.” Many men were kept in
a state of servitude long after the expiration
of their sentences. It was not until 1797
that the Secretary of State promised that
‘ ‘ in future lists shall be sent from England
and Ireland of the terms of sentence.” For
the first two years not an item of information
on this subject was despatched with the
transports, and only irregularly afterwards.
The fact proves rather conclusively that the
Government, in England had little thought
of its outcasts as soon as it got them off its
hands.
transportation with a hiccup, and cock the
black cap over his eye with a leery air as he
pronounced the last sentence of the law in
what Bligh euphuistically called his
“moments” of intoxication—and yet they
did not love him ! These accomplishments,
and the genially sociable qualities of this
drunken Draco palled on their jaded appe-
tites. So they excogitated a little plot.
Unfortunately, perhaps, it failed in its execu-
tion, and the plotters were arrested. Judge
Atkins adjudicated, and this is what took
place :
Question: “Did you hear the prisoner
say all this 1”
Witness: “No; I only heard him say
that he would flog the Judge to death.”
Judge Atkins: “Did he say for what
reason he would flog me to death 1”
Witness : “Because, sir, you had ordered
men to be flogged, and they had died from
the flogging.”
And yet the Judge was not popular—ex-
cept, indeed, amongst the class which ad-
mired his firm and uncompromising adminis-
tration of the law. Colonial history is always
repeating itself, and this opportunity has not
been missed.
“ The more convicts that can be made over
i individuals, and taken off' the stores, the
■eater will be the advantage, ” said a White-
ill despatch of 1796. The principle thus
id down was carried out in a very thorough-
iced fashion. The labourers worked from
five in the morning till eleven, and from two
in the afternoon to sunset. The Governor
in 1800 wrote thus ;—“ Notwithstanding the
number of people brought from Ireland by
the last two ships”—this was just after the
rebellion —“we have received no great ac-
cumulation of strength. Many of the
prisoners have been either bred up in genteel
nther bred up xr
Perhaps the most painful thing in connec-
tion with this part of our history is the
manner in which Australian writers have
dealt with it. The fortunes that were made
by the oppression and cruelty of these early
days have been worshipped, and the deeds of
the men who made them glozed over. The
unhappy wretches who became their victims
are passed over without a word of pity for
their sufferings, or of reprobation for the
conduct of those who caused them. Yet no
class of men ever called more strongly for
reprobation. “ It would have been far more
merciful,” says an eye-witness of what he
describes, “to have hanged all who violated
the laws of their country, than to have sent
them out to New South Wales and its de-
pendencies, subject to the unmerciful treat-
ment of human tigers, who tortured or killed
those within their power according to the
caprice of the moment. I saw many a fine

is almost impossible to realise it ! —took place
during year after year in sunny New South
Wales !

CHAPTER IX.
Genesis of Our Flogging Laws.
When the Australian colonist of to-day
wakes up now and then with a spasm of
horrified disgust to find a creature of weak
intellect, or otherwise mentally diseased, de-
liberately flogged in the police-stations at the
corners of Australian streets, he is under no
misapprehension, as to where our flogging
laws and customs come from. He knows
they come down, with the people who make
and administer them, in a kind of un-apostolic
but strictly canonical succession, from the
men and the manners of one hundred years
ago at Botany Bay.
It is quite easy to diagnose our progress
since that time. We have only to com-
pare the present with the past. The whistling
lash sings a story in the ears of all who will
listen to it, of the survival in colonial life of
the influence of the gaolers of the convict
days. The convicts have gone—let oblivion
go with them ! No offences of theirs could
have outweighed their expiation. But their
miserable memories call for the execution of
a pitiless justice on those who once made
their chains hang heavier and their gyves gall
deeper, and whose representatives would
hang in convict-irons to-day the free spirit of
an Australian people, who have nothing to
do with the past other than to submit to be
governed, as long as it may please them, by
the surviving spirit of the convict-days.
Deserted by God and man, the convicts on
their arrival were left to the mercy of
wretches whose characters are best painted
by their own acts. The story becomes too
Zola-like in its realistic horror to be minutely
treated by any other than a Zola’s pen. Men
and women were flogged alike at the triangle,
or at the cart’s tail. A Botany Bay “ dozen”
was twenty-five lashes, and as many as one
thousand were often ordered and adminis-
tered. Such a sentence as this reads nowa-
days like a sentence of death by torture, but
the presiding fiends had, to some extent,
guarded against that. So we read in the
old stories of men who were cut to pieces
from the neck to the knees, and when all
semblance of humanity was thus crushed out
of the quivering jelly that represented the
body, as the system had long since driven
the divine image out of the soul, the victim
was saturated in brine to expedite his re-
covery, so that his sentence might be com-
pleted in a similar way. One such sentence,
signed by Judge-Advocate Atkins, John
Harris, and Thomas Jamieson, is given with
othex-s in the report of Colonel Johnstone’s
court-martial. It bears date 1807, and sets
forth that seven convicts, having attempted
to escape from the settlement, were recap-
tured and brought back, f* They were sen-
tenced : one to receive 1000 lashes ; thrpe
others, 500 lashes each; one to hard labour


Another charming vignette is presented in
the following terse bit of description. A
number of desperate creatures had been
goaded into an attempt at rebellion. They
intended to seize the Governor and the
officials, and rule the colony themselves
after disarming the soldiers. Of course they
were detected in their plot and were duly
sentenced to be flogged, under the infliction
of which some died. This is what took
place in one instance:—“We marched to
Toongabbee, where all the Government
transports were kept, who were called out to
witness the punishment of the prisoners.
One man was sentenced to receive 300 lashes,
and the method of punishment was such as to
make it most effectual. The unfortunate
man had his arms extended round a tree, so
that flinching from the blow was out of the

paragraph that Margaret Camel, being an
accessory to a theft, was sentenced to be
publicly whipped through the streets of
Sydney, at the cart’s tail. This was a
common street scene; as well as the pro-
cession of convicts to the place of execu-
tion, with their officers beside them, in a
cart. It is Byron who says that the
first sight that met his eyes in an English
town after returning from abroad was the
spectacle of a woman being whipped
through the streets at the cart’s tail, and
Botany Bay was not to be left behind in such
a matter as this—not, it may believed, even
if Judge-Advocate Atkins and his compeers
had to build a cart for the purpose them-
selves. In 1829 Judge Dowling sentenced a
man to be flogged in this way from the
George-street Police-court to the Market-
street wharf, for stealing a pair of oars. So
the popular mind was familiarised with
horrors, and children gazed on in pleased
appreciation as men and women were hanged
and flogged in public for their encouraged
ment. Thus the natural feeling even of tile

our story—found seven poor wretches
marooned on one of those forbidding rocks
in Bass’s Strait. They had been away eight
months, and seven others who had escaped
with them had treacherously left them there
to perish. They wanted to travel northward
“to throw themselves on his Majesty’s
mercy.” They forgot that the gentlemen
who represented his Majesty had no mercy.
Bass could not take them away, as his boat
was too small, but he gave them a musket
and some ammunition, a compass, and some
fishing-lines. Two were ill, and these he
took into his boast. The rest he landed on
the mainland, and they started on their long
walk back to Botany Bay. “ When they
parted with Mr. Bass and his crew, who
gave them what clothes they could spare,”
says the story, “some tears were shed on
both sides.” An honest touch of nature,
this.
Although it does not properly belong to
this part of our story, this is, for many
reasons, a fitting place to do justice to the
memoty of one of the few men who ever
showed a human sympathy with these forlorn
convict wretches. When the reader is
sickened by the rapacity and cruelty of the
New South Wales Corps, and the gaolers of
the penal settlement generally, he may turn
for refreshment to the name of Colonel
Collins. ‘ ‘ His conduct >vas exemplary, and
his disposition most humane. His treatment
of the runaway convicts was conciliatory, and
even kind. He would go into the forests
among the natives to allow those poor crea-
tures, the runaways, an opportunity of re-
turning to their former condition.* And,
half dead with cold and hunger, they would
come and drop on their knees before him,
imploring pardon for their behaviour.” He
would,give them food and clothing, and send
them back to their work. At this time
Colonel Collins was Governor of Van Die-
men’s Land. But he died.
CHAPTER XI.
The Convict in Revolt.
Besides these attempted escapes by land
and sea, the convicts tried to break their
fetters by rebellion. Goaded to desperation
as they were by the brutality of their gaolers,
and with the utter hopelessness of their
abandonment perpetually staring them in the
face, it was but natural that convict flesh and
blood should mutiny.. Isolated cases of
assigned servants rising against their masters
are numerous. In a moment of natural
self-assertion a convict might strike his
master or overseer. It would not be" long
before he found himself triced up to the tri-
'angles, and tortured until the capricious
vengeance of his victim was entirely glutted.
He would be cut down with murder in his
heart, and it would not be long before the
body of his tyrant would be found lying
about, while a new bushranger would take
to the bush. Instances of the kind might be
multiplied endlessly.
The first mention of an organised move-
ment among the convicts was in 1796. They
began to complain with fastidious particu-
the .reported conspiracy than is found in the
following from Barrington’s history:—“A" m
convict who had, with, great earnestness,
propagated a report that many pikes had
been secretly made, and, to prevent detec-
tion, sunk in a well-known part of the har-
bour, was examined. This fellow, on being
examined by the magistrates, confessed he
knew nothing of what he had stated, and
said he was intoxicated at the time. For'
this he was severely punished.” Harold, #
the priest, was examined, but “nothing.ap-
peared to criminate him.” A general search
was made among the 'persons suspected, in
all parts of the colony at the same time ;
“ the examination took place on the 15th,
but nothing was discovered that could
furnish the smallest evidence of the reported
crimes.” But this did not prevent whole-
sale floggings taking place in all directions
to extract information. Under the influence
of abject terror, some scared wretches in-
vented stories, but they contradicted each
other and were flogged for their pains, while
others were sent to Norfolk Island without
trial; and, here, again, it is strange to note
how our liistory repeats itself. Since the
introduction of responsible government we
have seen a New South Wales Premier
excite a similar' scare, and call the dead
from the grave—in the shape of the Kiama
Ghost—to prove his slanders oh a large sec-
tion of the community. Our political leaders
have studied their politics, as they have their
laws, in the old convict records of the semi-
savage and benighted past.
Thomas Holt, whom we have so often
quoted, was one of the suspects on this occa-
sion. He was taken out of bed after mid-
night, and brought from his place at Brush
Farm to the gaol in Sydney. He gives a
picture of the gaoler : ‘ ‘ Mr. Daniel M ‘Kay,
a person whose' acquaintance I did not covet,
fqr he had been a transport convicted of
picking pockets. We do not attach much
mildness of character to the turnkey of a
gaol. It sometimes happens, that a petty
larceny rascal, or even a felon, who has not'
been steeped in the lowest dregs of villainy,
may be so far reformed as to be thought,
worthy of being one of the many-headed
dugs of a county gaol ; a kind of deputy
devil, with eminent qualities as a tormentor ;;
such a man, in comparison to Daniel M‘Kay,
would have been thought worthy to be made
a member of a colonial parliament, had such
a thing existed, or. a justice of the peace, or
a judge.” The mantle of grim prophecy
seems to have fallen, unawares on Mr. Holt,


Then Major Johnstone set out with 40 soldiers
and came up with the rebels at about half-
past 10 next morning. It is amusing to read
the various accounts of what took place.
Says Major Johnstone : “I rode up to them,
accompanied by one trooper (the emphasis is
his own), and remonstrated with them on the
impropriety of their conduct, and desired
them to surrender, which they peremptorily
refused. I went up a'seqqnd time with a

One of the heroic stories of the period is
that of “the Scotch Martyrs,” who were
transported in 1794. They were Messrs.
Muir, Palmer, Gerald, Margaret, and Skirv-
ing, and the story of these men is a standing
comment on the British civilisation and en-
lightenment of the day. At about this time
England had just goaded the Americans and
Irish into rebellion, and begun her career of
arms in India under Wellesley, the period of
fraud being over. She had founded New
South Wales, and frustrated the designs of
Providence by making Australia the abode of
all the vile growths that her own grim social
and political codes had called into existence.
Having successfully created such a receptacle
for vice and crime, it is instructive to see the
class of people she sent out to fill it.
♦ * ♦
Muir was a Scotch barrister, and when an
association was formed in London to bring
about certain reforms in Parliament by con-
stitutional means, his sympathies were en-
listed. He helped to form a branch of the
“Friends of the People” in Glasgow. All
the members subscribed to a declaration ot
adherence to the established government,
and claimed to be acting merely within their
constitutional rights. The Glasgow Associa-
tion reprinted some tracts issued by the
London branch, and Mr. Muir was thereupon
charged with “ sedition.” The others were
indicted with him, and the trial is one of the
scandals of history. The ruffianly Brabourne
helped to try the cases, and all the Court in-
fluence was worked on and off the Bench to
secure a conviction. When the accused left
their hotel to attend the Court the horses
were taken from the chaise, and an applaud-
ing crowd took their places. Arches and
wreaths were held over Margaret as he passed
along the street, bearing such words as
“ Reason,” “ Liberty,” and so forth inscribed
thereon. The Lord-Provost, with some con-
stables and a “press-gang,” met the proces-
sion, smashed the emblems, and took many
into custody. There was never any doubt
about the verdict. Margaret was sentenced
to 14 years’ transportation beyond the seas,
Muir to seven years, and the others to vari-
ous terms.
An appeal was made to the Commons on
behalf of Muir, and the Right Hon. William
Adam moved and Mr. Fox seconded an ad-
dress to the Crown on his behalf. The
Government whipped up its party and de-
feated the motion, and the Annual Register
for 1794 says that on February 10 ; “Messrs.
Muir, Margaret, Skirving, and Palmer were
removed from Newgate in a post-coach and
four, attended by two King’s messengers.
We learn that they were taken on board
vessels bound to Botany Bay. ” Gerald fol-
lowed a few months later. The Secretary of
State charged the gaolers of these men to
“ keep a watchful eye over their conduct,”
and to search their effects diligently for sedi-
tious literature before allowing them to land.
Brick huts along the side of Sydney Cove
were assigned for their residences. Muir
afterwards lived at Hunter’s Hill, which he
named after his patrimonial estate in Scot-
land, and Gerald bought land where the
Botanic Gardens now are in Sydney. They
made repeated applications to be allowed to
return home, but the vindictive spirit that
sent them forth dreaded freedoip of opinion
too much to accede to these requests.
Gerald, who was a man of amiable and re-
fined character, died in 1796, and was buried
in his little plot of ground at his own request.


Skirving only survived him three days. ‘‘ A
dysentery was the apparent cause of his
death,” says Collins, “but his heart was
broken. Amongst us he was a pious, honest,
worthy character. In this settlement his
'political principles never manifested them-
selves, but all his solicitude seemed to be to
evince himself the friend of human nature.
Bequiescqt in pace,” adds this good Collins,
feelingly. A “ friend of human nature” was
more likely to rest peacefully under the
ground than on it in Botany Bay at that
time.
• * •
When the history of these prosecutions
became known in France and America, the
newly-awakened popular sentiment of those
countries was deeply stirred. The whole
business was oxxe of barefaced and shameless
persecution. The late Chief Justice Cock-
burn has stated that the jury in Muir’s case
was packed by Lord Jeffrey of Edinburgh
Review fame ; the former never referred to
this iniquitous case without horror. Muir’s
treatment in prison, we are expressly told,
was vindictive and cruel. He employed his
time after reaching Sydney in alleviating the
miseries of the more abandoned of the con-
victs, and in protesting against being- treated
himself as a felon. The speeches of Adams
and Fox had been read, and honest men had
felt their blood boil at the story they told.
Washington, in America, interested himself
on behalf of this sufferer for liberty, and a
vessel called the Otter was fitted out to
enable him to escape from the colony. She
arrived in Port Jackson .under pretence of
trade, and on February 11 Mr. Muir was
smuggled on boai’d, and made his escape out
to sea. The ship got safely away, but was
wrecked off California. All were drowned
save Muir and two sailors. They followed
the shore-line for four thousand miles on
foot to reach Panama, At Vera Cruz, Muir
shipped as a sailor on board a Spanish man-
of-war going home. But capricious fate still
followed him, for the ship was captured by a
British frigate, and Muir, in the conflict, had
the top of his head shot away. When the
boarding-party came on board one of the
men lifted the apparently lifeless body of
Muir in his arms to throw it overboard with
the rest, when an officer saw a Bible in his
clasped hand. He opened it, and knew
Muir’s name as that of a dear old friend and
schoolfellow. He was carefully examined,
found still living, and sent to the hospital at
Cadiz. Here he recovered, and the French
Directory, hearing of him again, invited him
to Bordeaux, where he was entertained at a
banquet by 500 French gentlemen. Then
he went to Paris, where he was publicly
welcomed. He rose to speak at the banquet
given him there, and fainted from excite-
weakness. He was taken to

was opened in London the Duke of Portland
doubtless thought the uncouth sailor-
governor had blundered, as it were, in a
passing moment of intoxication.
The real nature of the quarrel between
the officers and the Governors came out
when King gave certain emancipated convicts
the right to sell rum. This was wounding
the officers in the apple of the eye, so to
speak. They protested against this mon-
strous interference with their privileges, and
Major Johnston, who was wise in council as
we have seen him brave after battle, objected
in these gallant words :—“I do not look
upon convicts conditionally emancipated as
amenable to the articles of war, or on a foot-
ing with those who are considered the respect-
able inhabitants of this colony, nor do I
imagine that I could justify my conduct were
Ito sanction such a measure.” This was in
1803, and it expresses the jealousy felt by
the officers in regard to the emancipated
convicts, who were beginning to compete
with them in trade. For 40 years afterwards,
attempts were made to keep the line of de-
marcation rigidly defined.
The officers persecuted King until they
drove him out of the country. Their
attacks took the meanest and most unsoldier-
like form. They wrote rude and indecent
verses, and dropped them in a cowardly way
about his premises. They circulated clumsy
lampoons from hand to hand, of which the
venom was more apparent than the wit. One
bard was inspired to sing thus ;
It will be seen that the officers kept an eye
on Jack Ketch even when they burst into
song. The verses of these people were as
bad as their moral characters. They secured
their point at last in making King “humbly
implore leave of absence to submit his con-
duct” for home consideration. He got it,
and Bligh took his place.
There were many privileged ruffians in
early New South Wales, but none so richly
deserve to be tied up to the triangles of his-
tory and flogged with the “cat” of honest
criticism as Captain John Macarthur. He
I was one of our first merchants—such mer-
chants as the officers of the New South
Wales Corps were., He-was the founder of
the squatting order—but his public thefts
were not confined to the public lands. He
was the originator of the wool-growing in-
dustry. But John Macarthur was a great
deal besides all that. “De mortuis nil nisi
bonum,” says someone ; but the last word is
an error. It should read U verum” instead.
• * •
Inasmuch as he opened up the wool-grow-
ing industry he did good work. But it paid
him. There was no mawkish philanthropy
about John Macarthur. He was as rapa- j
cious as a jackal, and as emotionless and cold j
I
as an oyster. Therefore his projects pros-
pered well. He grew wool just as he sold
rum—to make money. He made it. But
the persons who have written Australian
history w'ant to make him a hero and a
patriot as well. He was a patriot. But it
was of the Australian brand. And the Aus-
tralian brand has certain distinctive features
which make it peculiar to Australia. Those
who are ignorant of what these distinctive
features are may glean a fair idea by noting
the characteristics of this worthy Captain
John Macarthur, All our patriots have a
family resemblance. We will mark this one
with the lash as he hangs by the wrists at
the triangles of history, so that you may
know the type when you meet it in Aus-
tralian public life, or in these pages again.
Macarthur was about 20 years of age when
he came to Botany Bay as Paymaster and
Lieutenant in the Corps, with the first divi-
sion that reached the settlement. If there
was any doubt as to the motive that brought
his confederates to Australia, there was
never any about what brought him. He
came to make money, and he made it.
When the “ rum-selling corps” was in action,
he was always in the van. His hand was in
everything that was going. The Corps put
him forward as its representative, and he
fought for their privilege to rob and defraud
the soldier and the convict, and called his
action a defence of the popular rights. He
harassed the successive Governors, and
boasted of having procured the recall of
every one of them up to Macquarie. He
helped to chase Phillip out of the country,
and, when Hunter came, he persecuted that
unhappy person so far that he had to appeal
to the Home Government against him. “ I
consider this officer’s conduct to be an im-
pertinent, indiscreet, and highly censurable
interference with the duties and department
of the Governor,” he wrote, when Mac-
arthur went home to work up a feeling
against him there. When King came he
made himself as obnoxious as before, and
scarcely allowed that good sea-captain time
to flog his,_ woman-convicts. This exaspe-
rated King very much, and he stated his
views in certain lurid minutes to his
superiors, ending with the words, “ Should
any further proof be Wanting of the turbu-
lent and restless character of Captain Mac-
arthur, I must require that the evidence of
the late Governors Phillip and Hunter may
be procured.”
Whoever opposed the nefarious proceed-
ings of the Corps came in for his unscru-
pulous attacks. He had his faction amongst
the settlers, and to those who did not belong
to it his name was a cause of undisguised
terror.' When Judge-Advocate Atkins was
not intoxicated, he was quarrelling with
Macarthur, too, and some pretty squabbles
were the result. They took action for libel
against each other, but dropped them
promptly, doubtless for excellent reasons on
both sides. When the magistrate, Dr. Bal-
main, refused to play into the hands of the
Corps, they persecuted him, too, and Mac-
arthur was singular for the cunning yet
shameless way in which he slandered the
magistrate; who replied, “that he would
maintain to his last breath the character of a
gentleman, in defiance of every unmanlj
mode of detraction that Mr. Macarthur is
capable of using.” When the jackals of the
Corps began to quarrel among themselves
over the bones they stole, Macarthur, of
course, was in the thick of the scramble.
Captain Abbott, of the Corps, said some-
thing quaint about Governor King, and
Lieutenant Marshall, of the , Navy, whose
proud soul revolted at this insult to another
naval officer from a squalid captain of this
unsavoury body, pleasantly signified his sen-
timents by pulling Captain Abbott’s nose.
They fought duels on Garden Island in those
days; but Captain Abbott didn’t. He
thought it safer to bring a civil action.
Colonel Paterson—a not unworthy officer,
though in very bad company—could not help
sympathising with Marshall, The irre-
pressible Macarthur thereupon picked a
quarrel with his officer, and challenged him
to a duel. Then the Governor got disgusted
with the whole miserable business, and sent
Macarthur .home under arrest. But he soon
came back. There was no scope for' talents
like his out of a convict colony.
Why did Macarthur come into such fre-
quent conflict with the Governor and other
officials ? Simply because he had the largest
stake in the trading operations of the Corps
as already described. He and his accom-
plices were making fortunes out of the
cruelly-forced convict labour, the open fraud
and extortion practised on the soldiers and
settlers, and the control and monopoly of
that criminal traffic in rum which turned the
early settlement into a Pandemonium. It
has been said that Macarthur 1 treated his
assigned convicts well. If he did, it was for
the return their prison-labour might produce
him. But, fortunately, we have an explicit
record bearing indirectly on this matter,
which fairly states his good intentions for
what they were worth. Macarthur made a
public-spirited proposal to Governor Hunter
to relieve him of the care of a number of
convicts by taking them to work for him.
He took great credit fob his generosity in
offering bread-rate for their labour. Hunter
looked up his pocket-grammar, and fixed the
patriot neatly, thus : “ The daily wages of a
labouring man, without furnishing food, was
at that time ss. or something more, and the
price of bread was about 2|d. per lb. Sup-
posing a man to receive two pounds a day,
that would amount to 5d.; for this mighty
saving to Government of 5d., he would have
gained ss. in labour.” So Mr. Macarthur’s
benevolence was blighted ; and nothing is
here apparent to show why his turn at the
triangles of history should be abridged by so
much as a single lash.
It was part of the plan of these officers,
and of Macarthur as their spokesman, to
oppose every measure for the amelioration
of the convicts’ lot. To secure their own
ascendancy they put forward every effort to
crush the emancipated prisoners. When a
proposal was made to establish them on
small farms, so that they might have an
opportunity of living honestly by their own
labour, he vehemently opposed the project
of giving land to what he called the “idle,
worthless poor,” whom he said should be
“ obliged to employ themselves ip the service

Court was constituted the defendant ob-
jected to the Judge-Advocate on the ground
of personal enmity, but that officer replied
that, in the terms of the King’s Patent,
there could be no Court without him. Cap-
tain Kemp told the Judge he was merely a
• common juryman, and the officers compelled
him to leave his seat as president of the
Court, while Macarthur addressed those
assembled in a wild and excited manner.
He said that Atkins had “associated and
combined with that well-known dismem-
bered limb of the law, George Crossley,” to
accomplish his destruction. He added that
he had proof, in the writing of Crossley, that
it was determined to ruin him. “This
precious document,” he said, “came into
my hands as if by the interposition of Divine
Providence ; it dropped from the pocket of
Crossley, and was brought to me.” Divine
Providence in this instance was probably the
same power that extracted the papers from
Governor King’s despatch-box—a clever
pickpocket, namely, of the class whose ser-
vices the officers had often occasion to use.
The person who picked Crossley’s papers up
where he so opportunely dropped them might
just as well have picked his pockets of them
at once, though it might not have been so
convenient for Macarthur to sky so.
So the drunken Judge and the convict
attorney and the turnkey-officers fought
amongst themselves, and the reader to-day
may judge, if he can, what there is to choose
among them. When these squalid rascals
fall out among themselves, we see what kind
of creatures they really are. When Mac-
arthur finished his harangue, the Judge-
Advocate threatened to commit him, but
Captain Kemp shouted, “You commit! No,
sir, I will commit you to gaol.” The Judge-
Advocate then tried to adjourn the Court,
and left, but Captain Kemp insisted that the
officers were a Court. Macarthur claimed
the protection of the officers against his
enemies. They gave him a guard, and the
Provost-Marshal, Mr. Gore, very properly
treated their action as a rescue, and obtained
a warrant for his arrest. The officers wrote
bo the Governor demanding that Atkins
should be replaced by another judge, to
yvhich Bligh replied that it was out of his
power to supersede the King’s Commission,
rtie officers repeated their request, and Bligh
isked for the papers. They refused to supply
diem. Then the Governor wrote to Major
Johnstone, asking his attendance under par-
ticular public circumstances. He replied,
md said that he was “too ill to come,” and
vas unable to write. The next morning,
January 26, the Provost arrested Macarthur
igain,.and the Judge-Advocate formally ac-
cused the officers to the Governor, of
11 crimes amounting to usurpation,” and
tending to incite rebellion and treason in the
territory. 'Bligh summoned the officers to
ippear before him next day, and again sum-
noned Major Johnstone, and again received
i reply saying that the IMajor was still “so
11 as to be unable to write.” But he was
lot too ill to* drive the same afternoon into
■Sydney to his barracks, where the officers
net him, and persuaded him to usurp the
;overnment of the colony. The New South
Yales Corps formed, and, with drums beat-


sacked, and the Governor’s commission, in-
after experiencing much insult, was con-
ducted be-ow by Lieutenant Minchin, who
told me that Major Johnstone was waiting
for me.” Johnstone repeated to Bligh what
his letter has already told us, and placed
him under arrest. Then the house was ran-
structions, and other papers and reports
seized, and a guard was set round the house
to prevent Bligh’s escape. This is his own
account ; the officers maintained that he was
found concealed under a bed, from which he
was extracted at the point of a soldier’s
bayonet. There is nothing inherently in-
credible about this version, but, coming from
the source it does, the statement is probably
a lie. The civil magistrates were at once
placed under arrest.
* *
Then a reign of terror set in. If any
doubt existed as to the character of the
officers of the New South Wales Corps and
their leading spirit, Mr. John Macarthur, as
well as of the real nature of the revolution
they effected, the events that now followed
rapidly dispelled it. The officers had every-
thing their own way, with no responsibility
for their actions, and under these favourable
circumstances they soon showed the kind of
material they were made of. On the day
following Bligh’s deposition Major Johnstone
dismissed the magistrates from their offices,
and took proceedings against the other
opponents of his rule. The attorney Cross-
ley, who prepared the indictment against
Macarthur, was sent to the coal-mines at
Newcastle for seven years. The officers of
the Corps were appointed to the vacant
magistracies, and Judge-Advocate Atkins

the same officer whose nose was pulled for
his insolence by Lieutenant Marshall. It is
probable that Atkins would have been sent
to the coal-mines with Orossley, but the
, ' officers presently found that he might be
useful to them ; so they showed him a docu-
ment found among Bligh’s stolen papers,
which we have already quoted from, charging
him with drunkenness and incapacity. When
Mr. Atkins read this little paper he at once
threw in his lot with the officers, and was
I again appointed Judge-Advocate by those
congenial spirits. As the holder of the
King’s Commission the officers knew that
his acts would have a certain legality which
theirs wanted, so they were content to bury
the past, and possibly to persuade Mr. Mac-
arthur to refrain from spurning the Judge -
Advocate now that he had the opportunity.
The Commissary, Palmer, was also dis-
missed, as also was Robert Campbell, the
naval officer with whom Macarthur had
quarrelled. Macarthur was tried again
before the new Judge-Advocate, promptly
acquitted, and chaired through the streets of
the town by the soldiers, who throughout
these proceedings enjoyed themselves very
much indeed.

Their rascality was of too finished a character
for that. One of Johnstone’s—or Mac-

at Sydney, ordering him to deliver Mac-
arthur at his peril—thus compelling the per-
formance of an illegal action under a direct
threat, which the gaoler knew only too well
how to appreciate. Johns,tone was too ill to
attend Bligh’s summons, but not too ill to
come into town the same afternoon and de-
pose him. He charged Bligh with crimes
that rendered him unfit to exercise the
supreme authority another moment in the

crimes were. From first to last, as was

the hands of the soldiers who had forcibly
rescued him, both were sent to the coal-
mines of Newcastle by the malice of the
canting ordinary, who had the audacity to
insert special prayers in the Church Service
for the instrument of his mean revenges.
The case of Suttor was still worse. He was
an industrious settler at Baulkham Hills, and
no sympathiser with the aims aiid schemes
of the officers. He and several others ad-
dressed a memorial to the Home Govern-

The facts of the Bligh case, candidly told,

They sold goods, having dishonestly obtained
by fraud and force the command of the
market, at a usurious profit running up to
1500 per cent.; they robbed the poor settler
of the produce of his labour for a tithe of its
value, and they demoralised the settlement
with licentiousness and rum. Bligh, as we
have seen, had express instructions to stop
some of these iniquities, and his honest
efforts in that direction aroused the trading
officers’ enmity. They put in force against

from the squalid abominations of these first
years of our story would be to disclose a pic-
ture of horror that is simply revolting and
nothing more. Enough has been said for
the purpose of the present writer, and more
than enough to show what the beginnings of
the colony really were. The subject is not
an attractive one. Not one word would have
been said to revive this squalid and debasing
memory were it not that the shameful brand
of this “rum-selling Corps” still reddens and
burns in the flesh of Young Australia-
* ♦ »
With the exit of the “rum-selling Corps”
a new volume in the history of Botany Bay
may be said to open. But it is sad to have
to add that enough of the old leaves re-.
mained to make the new book, in many
respects, a copy of the old. Had the Corps'
continued its rule, it is quite impossible to
imagine what the colony would have even-
tually become. But when it was drafted
home its officers, the responsible agents of
all the rascality, resigned almost in a body
and remained behind. This was their way
out of the difficulties that surrounded them.
They had made large fortunes, and founded
large interests during the hey-day of their
power. So they deserted their followers,
whom they had first robbed and then led
into danger; turned their backs on the
King’s colours, and settled down in the
colony to continue their old practices as far
as they might be allowed, to become nominee
legislators eventually, and the founders of
our “first families.” The strong rule of the
military Governors who, beginning with
Macquarie, superseded the . old naval
Governors, did not allow of the same ex-
cesses as the first' 20 years of our history
presented. But the wealth and influence
of these black leg officers, who deserted
their followers after leading them into
danger, made them powerful enough to re-
cover from the shock and perpetuate the
spirit they introduced, even down to our
own days.
“All the oppressors were smashed to-
gether,” says Holt, “ and it was amusing to '
hear them abusing each other and cursing
the Governor.” And in another place we
get this:—“Anthony Fenn Kemp lost his
commission as Judge-Advocate, and from
being a magistrate and a great officer in the
colony, became nothing more than a captain
in the 102nd Regiment,” by which name the
Corps was henceforth known. “ And worse
than this,” goes on Holt, “his rotten
tobacco would no longer pay the soldiers, so
that misfortunes came upon him in various
shapes. ” One of the first acts of Macquarie
was to lower the price of provisions from the
false standard to which the officers had raised
it, and to have food sold in the open market
instead of in the hole-in-corner manner they
had forced on the ■settlement. “This was
of great service, to the poor,” we are
told, “and injured no one but those who
could bear k, and had too long enjoyed an
unfair profit. Comfort and happiness now
began to appear in the countenances of all
the inhabitants of the colony. John Mac-
arthur lost his villa 1 nous trade, but it had


lasted long enough to enable him to make a
lai’ge fortune.” But, then, as we have before
had occasion to notice, John Macarthuv was
not a man likely to waste either his sub-
stance or his sympathy on what he called
the “ idle, worthless poor.”
Another of Macquarie’s earliest steps was
to declare null and void all the acts of the
officers’ Government during the time of then-
rule. Their grants of land and free pardons
were revoked as illegal, and the documents
conveying such grants or pardons were called
in. But Macquarie was a man of marked
tact, and it -was his primary object to see
justice done, as far as possible, so that none
might suffer through the fault of others.
Having vindicated his authority, therefore,
by this act, he afterwards confirmed most, if
not all, of these grants and pardons. He
had instructions to use his discretion, in view
of the two years that had elapsed since the
rebellion, so that its traces might be effaced
with the least possible friction. This was
fortunate for the individuals, but for the
colony and its future it was simply the worst
thing that could possibly have happened.
Had strong and drastic measures been
adopted firmly and at once, and the wretches
who had wrought such misery on the colony
been swept away root and branch, and every
trace of their squalid presence scattered to
the winds, it would have been incalculably
better for the Australia of to-day. Mac-
quarie showed to these ruffians a measure of
mercy they had never been known to show
to others. We shall see, presently, how
they repaid him.
Meanwhile, it cannot be overlooked that
a very great reform had been effected in the
condition and prospects of the settlement by
the very first steps Macquarie took. The
departure of the Corps was an omen of good.
The drunken Judge-Advocate who indirectly
caused the rebellion, and then took service
under the officers who opposed him, was
drummed out of Botany Bay with them, and
another Judge-Advocate, who was not
drunken, appointed in his place. A chap-
lain was also brought out by Macquarie, and
the officer who solemnised marriages for the
settlement found his occupation gone. A
good many of the harems were broken up,
for Macquarie brought his wife with him,
and her presence kept the moral atmosphere
in the neighbourhood of Government House
and the official centres comparatively clean
and pure. But it was many years yet before
the “ factory” at Parramatta discontinued to
supply wives to the settlers on approval, to
be returned and replaced if found unsuit-
able.
It was during the second year of Mac-
quarie’s government that the court-martial
on Colonel Johnstone took place. It was
held at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and
lasted thirteen days, resulting in Colonel
Johnstone being found guilty of the act of
mutiny, and cashiered. It was added, in a
general order of the Commander-in-chief,
“ that the Court, in passing a sentence so in-
adequate to the enormity of ' lie crime of
which the prisoner has been found guilty,
nave apparently been actuated by a con-
uderation of the novel and extraordinary
circumstances” surrounding the condition of
the colony. The Prince Regent, in “ad-
mitting the principle under which the Court
had allowed this consideration to act in
mitigation of the punishment which the act
of mutiny would otherwise have suggested,”
said that “no circumstances could be re-
ceived in full extenuation of an assumption
of power, so subversive of every principle of
good order and discipline, as that under
which Lieutenant-Colonel Johnstone had
been convicted.” An enquiry into Mac-
arthur’s share in the proceedings resulted in
his being prohibited for eight years from re-
turning to the colony. He employed part of
the interval in a pleasant tour on the con-
tinent. Many hundreds of poor wretches
had been sent to Botany Bay for life for
much less villanies than his.
Bligh was immediately appointed to the
rank of Rear-Admiral in the Navy, and em-
ployed on active service. While the case
was in progress Johnstone made capital of
the fact that Bligh had been involved in
such enquiries before, while to himself the
position of prosecutor or defendant was new
and painful. There was some truth in this ;
for Johnstone, as we have already seen, was
in the habit of shooting and hanging prisoners
without wasting time in prosecuting them.
But Bligh manfully met the charge with a
sailor-like and simple account of his career,
which compelled the respect of his hearers
and put the calumnies of the defence to the
rout. He referred to the charge of cowardice;
he said he knew that Mr. Macarthur wrote
the despatch, in which the circumstance of
his having been found by the soldiers in
hiding under a bed was mentioned with
vulgar triumph. But he could not antici-
pate, he said, that Colonel Johnstone’s ad-
dress to the Court would be written in the
same spirit, and that, after being the victim
of Mr. Macarthur’s intrigues, he would allow
himself to be made the tool of his revenge.
Then he explained that just before his arrest
he called for his uniform, which was not a
dress adapted for concealment, and then,
selecting his papers, he was tearing some
to pieces and concealing the remainder when
he was discovered stooping over some docu-
ments on the floor by the soldiers on the
other side of the bed Macarthur’s tactics
pursued him to the last. Before the sentence
was made known a false account of the trial
was published in the British Express, con-
taining severe reflections on Governor Bligh.
A copy of this, wet from the printing-office,
was posted anonymously to Bligh ; and, says
Lang, “ on the inside of the envelope there
was sketched the figure of a pistol, inti-
mating, doubtless, that the old admiral had
now nothing better to do than to use that
instrument effectually, and be off! ” The
sender of this was never known. But if the
reader will compare it with the anonymous
attacks on Governor King, and with a cer-
tain surreptitious document issued by Mac-
arthur later on, he will see unmistakable
traces in all three of the one unscrupulous
hand.
CHAPTER XVIII.
The Pure Merinos.
We said that when the New South Wales
Corps was drummed out of the colony the
officers were left there in possession of their
ill-gotten wealth. Though their official posi-
tions were taken from them, by this time the
officers had no need of any accidental aids to
make their power felt. They were now the
property-owners and land-holders of the
colony, the holders of vested interests, as they
did not hesitate unblushingly to assert, and to
all intents and purposes the local aristocracy.
It became their object to preserve these
vested interests, and to draw a wide and
deep line of demarcation not only between
themselves and the emancipated members
of the convict class, but the less wealthy
section of free settlers as well. The yeoman
Suttor was an example of the latter. He
had come to the colony with the inten-
tion of making a home for himself by his
own honest efforts. He was an honest man.
The type was rare in the colony before Mac-
quarie’s time, and we have already seen that
the temporary rulers expressed their enthu-
siastic sense of the honesty of this man by
promptly putting him in prison.
When Macquarie began to govern, there-
fore, the persons who as officers of the mili-
tary force in the settlement had opposed all
the best intentions of Phillip, Hunter, King,
and Bligh, now in their capacity as property-
owners and the representatives of vested in-
terests, opposed every act of the present Go-
vernor that aimed at the welfare of the popu-
lation. This fact in our history is an import-
ant one, and is worthy of special notice,'for
this is the first of the connecting links be-
tween the rule of the Corps, and the sur-
vival of Botany Bay traditions in Australia
to-day. Having shown how these vested
interests grew up, and the character of the
people who formed them, it is necessary to
show the steps by which, with a slight change
of front, the malign influences that directed
the first stage of colonisation continued to
exercise their miserable sway and produce
the same fell results.
The emancipation of convicts had begun
with Phillip, and was continued by his suc-
cessors. Many of the convicts, as already
shown, were not criminals at all in the real
sense of the word. As they were emanci-
pated, or acquired their freedom by serving
out the terms of their sentences, many of
the convicts who escaped the contamination
of the Corps and the rapacity of the officers Jj
began to engage in trade—some being so em- I
ployed by the officers themselves. The re- |
suit was that many of these made some
money of their own, extended their
operations, and began to compete with
the officers in 1 the trade of the settle-
ment. But this would never do This
was revolutionary, and an interference with
the social rights and vested interests of their
quondam gaolers. The crime was made the
more heinous by the fact that the emancipist
traders actually sold goods at a lower price
than the officers. Their virtuous indignation
was aroused. These choice spirits said that
it was not fitting that the ex-convict should


side that of his ex-gaoler, and even under-
sell him in the articles of fustian jackets and
rum. So they formed a strong and closely-
knit party among themselves, called them-
selves the old colonial aristocracy of New South
Wales, and forthwith these squalid hypo-
| crites proceeded to inveigh against grant-
I ing to the emancipist the same civil rights as
they enjoyed. From this point down to the
granting of Responsible Government the
same spirit actuated the same class, with cer-
tain modifications, and formed for many
weary years an impassable obstacle to the
progress of the people and
the introduction of free in-
stitutions.
The vested interest class
became known as the ‘ ‘ Pure
Merinos,” as they were under-
stood to bear the same rela-
tion to the rest of the popu-
lation as the sheep of that
breed did to those from the
Cape. The freed convicts
were known as “ Emanci-
pists.” But though, in the
then undeveloped condition
of free settlement, the anta-
gonism was at first between
the “ Pure Merinos ” and the
“Emancipists,” it soon be-
came a conflict between the
former class and the whole
population of the colony,
whether emancipist or origi-
nally free. Macquarie’s in-
structions directed him to
carry out that part of the
design of the first experi-
mentalists in transportation,
which aimed at making
Botany Bay a place of re-
formation, as well as of
punishment. The original
plan, so far as there was any
plan at all, proposed to give
the convict facilities for earn-
ing an honest living as soon
as his term of sentence had
expired. But, of course, the
dilettante philanthropists
who conceived the scheme
never foresaw the compli-
cations the New South Wales
Corps was destined to intro-
duce. To attempt to unravel
these, after they had been
formed, was the task of the
new Governor.
m
I m _
macquaeie’s demoniac aeohiteot.
T Lachlan Macquarie was an honest British
officer of the old school, to whom it would
have been as impossible to engage in a
squalid traffic in rum while bearing the
King’s commission as it would have been to
mutiny against his superior officer. He saw
the kind of men he had to deal with at a
glance, as Bligh had done, but he had
considerably more power than his prede-
cessor. He saw that between the Eman-
cipist class, on the one side, and its black
sheep with the marks of the leg-irons still on
their limbs, and the Pure Merinos, with
their claims to consideration on the score of
wealth and what they called social position,
not take him long to say so, either. ‘ ‘ There
are only two classes of persons in New South
Wales,” he told the Secretary of State,
‘ £ those who have been convicted, and those

tary directness about this crisp statement of
fact that offended the Pure Merinos very
much indeed. Their susceptibilities were
frequently wounded in this way. It was in
a similar cordially appreciative spirit that

One of Macquarie’s first steps after the
general state of the colony had been dealt

intentions really were. For the second time
the poorer settlers were to see their Gover-

in their welfare. In 1809, just before hb
arrival, a heavy flood had again devastated
the Hawkesbury district, and the settlers
and small farmers there were reduced to the
direst straits for want of food. Macquarie

to that time—visited the suffering people,
brought them food and clothes, and made

hopeless and desperate. The accounts of
this visit show that the Governor was as
simple-minded as he was honest. He walked
about with his wife, and paraded the settlers
and their wives and children before him to
inspect the condition of their clothing. It is
true, this was not a difficult task, for the
poor wretches had not much to inspect. The
descendants of some of these settlers attend
the Governor’s levee now in
broadcloth and fine linen, as
is proper ; but many of these
honest fellows made ready
for the parade in a costume of

garment was represented by

Macquarie next planned a
scheme of inland settlement
that would remove the people
out of the reach of the de-
structive floods. Up to this
time the rulers appear to have been
too busy hanging and flogging convicts,
and squabbling among themselves about
the sale of rum, to trouble much about
schemes of settlement. Had a man of Mac-
quarie’s type been sent out in the first in-
stance, early Australian history would have
read altogether differently. He established
the townships of Windsor. Castlereagh, Pitt
Town, Richmond, Wilberforce, and Liver-
pool, and, by way of attracting settlers he
offered town-allotments and cultivation-areas
free of charge to those who would take them.
He provided the settlers, as Bligh wished to
do, with sheep and cattle on long credit, and


for 50 miles around Sydney he built bridges
and laid down roads so that the agricultural
population might have no difficulty in getting
their produce to market. Before his term of
office was over he had constructed over 271
miles of road, and it was during his govern-
ment, in 1813, that Blaxland, Lawson, and
Wentworth discovered the pass over the Blue
Mountains. The town of Bathurst was
founded by Macquarie, and a road 130 miles
long constructed thereto under his direction.
He was quite as active in the matter of the
erection of public buildings, as so many of
them unhappily remain to witness. Their
number was only equalled by their ugliness
of design, but for this, of course, Macquarie
can hardly be held responsible. The memo-
rials of the Dutch design of Governor
Macquarie’s demoniac architect cast squat
shadows over all the old settled districts of
the colony. Over 200 churches, schools, hos-
pitals, stores, barracks, and other structures
of the kind were built by him in New South
Wales. In Sydney there were 67 ;in Par-
ramatta there were 20 more ; in Yan Diemen’s
Land there were 47. The story of the
“ Rum Hospital ” belongs to this chapter of
Macquarie’s activity.
Some years ago a building stood in Mac-
quarie-street, Sydney, known as the Sydney
Infirmary. It has since been pulled down,
and its site occupied for some years by a
half-finished edifice of dressed stone, on
which the work was suspended because of
some dispute, which arose when it was half
finished, as to the purpose the building
should be devoted to when completed. The
useless walls still stand, to mark our pur-
poselessness as a people. But it is to the
old Sydney Infirmary that this story refers.
When Macquarie expressed a wish one day
that there might be a large general hospital
in Sydney, three individuals came forward
modestly with a little plan and a meek pro-
posal. These men were D’Arcy Went-
worth, Garret Blaxcell, and Alexander
Riley. Their plan was for a building to cost
£50,000, a sum which Macquarie, in his sim-
plicity, thought out of the question. But
here the meek proposal came in opportunely.
These three philanthropists offered to build
the hospital on condition that they received
the sole right to buy all rum and other
spirits imported into the colony for three
years. This was granted, and the three
philanthropists “rigged” the rum market.
To say that the other rum-purveyors were
disgusted with this astute manoeuvre would
very poorly express the extent to which their
honest bosoms were wrung.
The “ boodlers ” made the most of their
monopoly. Whenever a ship came in one
of the trinity would go on board and fix his
own price, as the captain could not sell to
anyone else. They usually paid 9s. per gal-
lon, and Is. to the orphanage fund ! Then
the publicans purchased from the store at
from £2 per gallon to £2 17s. 6d. The rum
was retailed at ss. per half-pint. The result
of the transactions is thus figured out by
Dr, Lang:—“ln the year 1824, the
Rum Hospital was calculated to be worth
£20,000. The quantity of Bengal rum the
contractors received was 60,000 gallons. The
THE HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
monopoly was for three years, it was after-
wards extended to three years and a-half,
and was supposed to be worth £100,000.”
This was over and above the first 60,000
gallons. “In short,” says Lang, “the
monopoly was a sort of regium donum, or
royal gift, over and above the fair market
price of the articles bargained for.” Besides
all this, the contractors paid half their men’s
wages in provisions or rum, and built taverns
near the works to receive the cash payment
back again. ‘ ‘ These three gentlemen, who
have the monopoly of the spirit trade,”
wrote Holt at the time, “ say that they built
the hospital ; but I assert it is the poor
people of the colony who built it. ” Hence
the appropriate name of the “Rum Hos-
pital.” Macquarie was not, of course, a man
of commercial training. But to outwit the
schemes of men trained in the early rum
traffic of Botany Bay would have taxed the
faculties and training of Beelzebub himself.
CHAPTER XIX.
The Emancipists.
Macquarie saw little difference between
the convicts and their gaolers, except that
the one class wore fetters while the other
did not. As soon as the irons were knocked
off there was nothing to choose between them.
He therefore saw no reason why the Eman-
cipist should not have the same chances as
the Pure Merino, so he made no scruple
about appointing ex-convicts to the magis-
tracy, and inviting them to dine at his own
table. Evil communication with the upper
classes of the settlement had corrupted his
manners to such a degree that he thought he
might as well dine with ex-convicts as
with their gaolers, and with better chance
of finding himself in honest company.
Wherever he saw encouragement he emanci-
pated convicts, therefore, and those who
prospered more or less honestly received
the same recognition as those who had pros-
pered dishonestly and had not been convicts.
He reasoned that the settlement of Botany
Bay was a penal settlement, and he failed to
see that its gaolers had any further social
claims than other turnkeys' he had heard of.
The ex-convict had some claim, for he was
on his own ground, and when his term had
expired he was entitled while within the
colony to all the social rights and privileges
he had forfeited on British soil by his
offences. All this was very simple. But it
did not please the Pure Merinos or fall in
with their views at all.
Macquarie had not been a month in the
colony before he made his first advance to the
Emancipists. There is a story that the Gover-
nor found it necessary to say something
caustic to Colonel Foveaux—a worthy man
who barely escaped being hanged by the
neck for an atrocity committed by him at
Norfolk Island. Foveaux in revenge ad-
vised him to encourage the Emancipists,
knowing that if he did so he would at once
incur the remorseless enmity of the Pure
Merinos. Macquarie took the advice offered
him, which was in accordance with his own
impulse, and made Andrew Thomson a magis-
trate. This man’s story is a fair sample of that
27
of a large class in the colony. He was trans- 1
ported while a mere boy, at the age of 16,
for setting tire to a stack of hay. This
meant that for a boy’s freak he was taken
from his home and his mother’s roof and
sent to herd for life with murderers and
cut-throats, 16,000 miles away. The original
design of the settlement offered some chance m
that when his sentence expired he might at I
least regain civil rights, though he could not 1
leave the colony. But the Pure Merinos
denied these poor wretches even that small
mercy. For one thoughtless act done by an
idle boy in a Scotch haytield near his own home
he was doomed to crawl for life on his hands
and knees under the lash of ruffians whose
crimes were a thousand times worse than his.
But Macquarie came and rescued him. He
had been a labourer in the stonemasons’ gang
at Parramatta, and possibly some of the
stones in some of those dismal old buildings
that yet reek with foul memories of the past,
still bear the mark of Andrew Thomson’s
pick. When his sentence was done he went
to Windsor, kept a shop, and sent boats down
to Sydney. By hard work he became rich,
and lent money to the Hawkesbury farmers,
besides giving them credit for their supplies.
When the floods came, instead of closing on
the homeless wretches as the Macarthurs
of the settlement did, he gave them assist-
ance and time. He thus acquired great in-
fluence among them, and they learnt to trust
him in preference to the officers who op-
pressed them. This was the man whom
Macquarie made his first emancipist magis-
trate. He could not have chosen a man more
distasteful to the Pure Merinos. When
Foveaux found his advice taken, he said, in
his elegant way, that “he had now placed a
blister on Governor Macquarie that he would
never be able to remove.”
It must have been a touching spectacle to
see Andrew Thomson take his seat at the
table of the Governor, among his former
gaolers. Pleasant reminiscences did they
doubtless discuss over the walnuts and the
wine—that is, if there were any walnuts, or
wine, or any other beverage besides rum, in
Botany Bay settlement in those days. The
officers of the 73rd Regiment also admitted
the new magistrate to their table, and the
Pure Merinos’ withers were wrung once
more. But the familiar demon they blas-
phemously nicknamed Providence, who
seemed to have deserted them lately, again
looked after them as before. Andrew Thom-
son died. He was only a magistrate a very
brief while. And the Governor set up a
tombstone over the grave of the man who
burnt a hay-stack when he was a boy, and on m
the stone he had an epitaph inscribed, which %
set forth “that it was in consequence of his ■
character and conduct that he appointed
him to be a magistrate in the colony, and
that by that same act he restored him to
that rank in society which he had lost.” It
was all the good-natured Macquarie could do
for this rustic victim of savage British laws.
There were no post-mortem examinations at
Botany Bay in those days.
Alarmed at these serious encroachments
on their privileges, the Pure Merinos had
recourse to their old tactics. They wrote
anonymous letters, and slandered Macquarie


28 1
behind his back ; and then they used their
influence at home to set the Colonial Office
in motion to have him censured or recalled.
The same tortuous ways they followed to
disgrace Hunter and King, and to slander
Bligh, were crawled over once more to ruin
Macquarie. The result of their scheming
was that Mr. Commissioner Bigge was ap-
pointed to proceed to Botany Bay and
enquire into the condition and prospects of
the convict population, and the working of
the transportation system generally. This
man Bigge was signally unfitted for the re-
sponsible duties committed to him. He
had as much qualification for his com-
missionership as Phillip had to bring out
the First Fleet,- —a duty, as we have seen,
for which his superior officer said he was not
fit. Perhaps Bigge was appointed for the
same reason; certainly appointments to
Botany Bay were not much run after
in those days. He seems to have
fallen into the hands of the Pure Merinos
from the start, and they so blew out this
pitiful bladder of a man with stories about
their own virtues and the vices of the ex-
convicts that he nearly burst with the in-
formation that he absorbed. Mr. Bigge
was morally garotted by the ex-officers
the moment he set foot on shore.
He was exactly in the position of a distin-
guished visitor to-day who visits the colonies,
perhaps, to write a book. He, too, falls into
the hands of a class ; and goes away with an
impression that Australia is populated with
purblind lickspittles, who give good dinners
and don’t know how to serve them. This
was the case with Mr. Bigge, He discovered
that Botany Bay was peopled with angels—
these were the ex-officers of the New South
Wales Corps ; and with fiends —who were
the ex-convicts. He reported accordingly,
and those who remember Macarthur’s
anonymous letters and the shameless slanders
about Bligh, will not require to be told what
that report said in detail. The burden of it
was that vested interests and the rights of
property must be maintained.
All the slanders that could be raked to-
gether against Macquarie’s administration
were put into that report. His very activity
in building and roadmaking was made a
charge against him, and his efforts to reform
the convicts by giving them some encourage-
ment to live honestly, were turned into an
accusation against him. The grounds on
which this was done are too characteristic to
be omitted. It was said that many of these
..■m* derelict creatures, when they got grants of
• laud or wages for labour, at once turned
I them into rum. This was horrible. But
f not so horrible as the fact that the whited
sepulchres who sold the rum to these
wretches for their wages or their land, and
enriched themselves further by the fact,
were the same people who virtuously pointed
out this state of things to the fatuous Mr.
Bigge. Their moral indignation at the
methods they themselves employed to make
their fortunes would put the Scribes and
Pharisees to shame But the Australian
41 first families” have never been of the
kind of botanical specimen that delights to
blush unseen, and waste its fragrance on the
desert air.
This case of Andrew Thomson is a repre-
sentative one, and it demonstrates the tactics
of the ex-officers better than anything else.
Mr. Commissioner Bigge, who censured
Macquarie in his report for making Thomson
a magistrate, swallowed all the officers told
him with gudgeon-like avidity. His report
set forth that Thomson was said to have been
a man of immoral life and an illicit still-
keeper. Macquarie, on his tombstone,
eulogised his character and conduct. There
is, therefore, a conflict of evidence between
Macquarie and the ex-officers. When it is
remembered what adepts at slander these
men had always proved themselves, and when
their command of every channel of calumny
from the anonymous letter down to Mr. Com-
missioner Bigge is also considered, the verdict
becomes a very easy one. But the matter is
settled when it is further remembered that
these British officers and gentlemen were
so notoriously profligate in their lives
as to keep and maintain harems
of convict women, who, when they
had served their turn, were drafted off
to retail for their owners that rum which
was illicitly distilled for them by their con-
vict servants when the importation of spirits
was forbidden by King and Bligh, When it
was necessary to hunt up some charges to
blast the reputation of an unhappy wretch
like Thomson, these ex-officers had only to
look into their own lives to find abundant
colour for their fancy pictures. Very little
indeed was left to the imagination.
One thing all the machinations of the ex-
officers failed to conceal, or to prevent from
getting into Bigge’s report. This was the
fact of the awful misery and unspeakable
dereliction of the convict classes in the
colony. Horrible stories and horrible inci-
dents of everyday so forced themselves on
the Commissioner’s attention that he could
not but leave some record of what he heard
and saw. Macquarie had indeed done
something to cut out of the system a little
of that barbarism that the New
South Wales Corps had introduced.
But it is to be considered that Mac-
quarie was himself a man bred to a career
which at that time was anything but a
philanthropic one. His personal character
impelled him in the direction of humanity in
his rule, but his training was against it.
Moreover the long rule of the Corps had so
corrupted and demoralised both the free and
the convict population that humanitarianism
in the ruler would almost have been out of
place. So the hanging and flogging went
merrily on ; but Mr. Bigge’s report went
home and began to open Englishmen’s eyes
to the cess-pool of legalised ruffianism they
had established under their flag.
CHAPTER XX.
Some Poets and Patriots.
We have given so much attention to the
antagonism between the Emancipists and the
Pure Merinos because, as our stoiy goes on,
it will appear that after the old convict lines
had been obliterated, and the country popu-
lated by free immigrants, the old antagonism
between class and class was still maintained
under different names. An instance soon
occurred to show how completely the officials
had been influenced by the ex-officers to op-
pose the amelioration of the convicts’ lot.
When Judge Bent succeeded the Judge-
Advocate of the same name, he estab-
lished a regular Supreme Court, and
one of his first acts was to deal with an ap-
plication from certain Eniancipists. Cross-
ley, who was one of Macarthur’s victims,
and who had been released from the New-
castle coal-mines when Macquarie came,
with two other ex-convict attorneys named
Eagar and Charters, applied for permission
to practise as solicitors and barristers. Judge
Bent refused the petition on the ground that
an Act of George 1., to prevent persons con-
victed of felony from practising in the law-
courts, was in operation in the colony. “ I
do now solemnly declare,” he said, in giving
his decision, 44 that I will not admit as at-
torneys of this Court, nor administer the
oaths to persons who have been transported
here as felons ; it is contrary to law, and no
circumstance and no necessity can exist so
strong in my mind as to induce me to it. ”
The Governor supported the emancipist
attorneys in their application, as the prin-
ciple on which he based his conduct required.
His contention was that the Act did not
refer to a penal colony established to give
emancipated offenders a chance of reforma-
tion. He wrote to the Secretary of State on
the subject, explaining his position and the
policy of his rule, as well as the machina-
tions of parties opposed to that policy. For-
tunately for Macquarie, his enemies were
not beforehand with him this time. He had
the full approval of the Home authorities for
his experiment in the reformation of eman-
cipists, and, inasmuch as the conduct of
Judge Bent was entirely opposed to the suc-
cess of that experiment, that person was at
once recalled. Earl Bathurst, writing in the
name of the Prince Regent, considered the
removal of J udge Bent 44 as necessary to
mark the sense and disapprobation which
they entertain of the measures which, so in-
discreetly for the colony and himself, the
said Geoffry Hart Bent, Esq., thought it
necessary to adopt.” The same letter also
conveyed to this luckless wight 44 the high
displeasure of his Royal Highness, and his
positive recall by his Majesty’s Government,
on account of conduct which, in their
opinion, could admit of no justification.” So
J udge Bent sailed out through the Heads,
and was seen of Botany Bay no more.
J udge Barron Field succeeded. He was
a friend of Lamb, and knew Hazlitt and
Coleridge, and He Quincey. Dr. Lang, who
doesn’t seem to have liked him, said he had
the folly to consider himself a sort of uni-
versal genius, and in particular a poet. At
all events he published a volume of so-called
poetry which he named “Botany, Bay
Flowers.” One of the 44 Flowers” is an
address to a kangaroo, commencing ;
44 Kangaroo ! Kangaroo !
Spirit of Australia ! ”
44 He makes 4 Australia ’ rhyme with
4 failure,’ ” says Lang ; 44 shrewdly consider-
ing the kangaroo a failure on the part of
Australian Nature in her awkward attempts


to make a proper quadruped for that country.
His collection of pieces was altogether the
wretchedest doggerel I have ever seen.”
And Lang should have been a judge of
doggerel, too ; for he himself published later
a most cacophonous collection of rhyming
rubbish. It is strange to find an associate of
Lamb and Coleridge on the Bench at
Botany Bay in those days—snatching a
moment, as it were, from his sentences of
hanging and the lash to pen little verses re-
specting the silent tomb, or the kangaroo ;
and inditing dreamy elegies on the death of
cockchafers while his fellow-creatures writhed
under the lash or dangled from the gallows
to which he had sentenced them. It was
only natural that so cultivated a spirit
should seek such congenial literary society
as Botany Bay afforded. We have seen
how some of the officers had a pretty
wit, and a deft hand at turning verses
—chiefly relating to executions and other
light subjects of the vers de societe of those
days. Among them Judge Field found
kindred spirits, so that he yearned no more
for De Quincey and Coleridge, and the
gentle Elia was almost forgotten.
So that when the Emancipist question
again came up, the new judge fell an easy
victim to the wiles of the literary circle into
which he had fallen. The rum-pur-
veyors probably affected to admire his
verses. Ex-couvict Eagar again comes
to the front, this time to press a case
against a Mr. Prosper de Mestre. This
was an American merchant settled in Sydney,
whose imports of tea from China interfered
with Eagar’s business. Finding the law-
courts closed against him, this latter individual
had entered on a mercantile career. He
brought an action to recover damages from
De Mestre for the penalties he had incurred
as a foreigner, under an old English Act,
for trading in the King’s colonies. But
De Mestre knew the official feeling of the
settlement. He moved for the official
record of the plaintiff’s conviction as his
reply to the charge laid against him. He
was successful. For Judge Field, emerging
from his commune with the Muses, quashed
the proceedings. This action on the part of
the judge had only one meaning. It meant
that no Emancipist could bring an action-at-
law, under any circumstances whatever,
without running the risk of having justice
denied him on the ground that he had been
once convicted of felony, and thus deprived
for ever of all rights and privileges as a
citizen. This was exactly the point the
Pure Merinos were labouring to establish.
JUDGE
The delight on the part of the Pure Merinos
was only equalled by the dismay among the
Emancipists. They saw themselves again
placed at the mercy of their enemies, and all
Macquarie’s efforts seemed vxin. An agi-
tation was set on foot amongst them, and on
January 23, 1821, a public meeting of Eman-
cipists was held in Sydney to protest against
the decision. It was decided to send a dele-
gation of two of tfieir number home on a
mission to the British authorities, to put the
Emancipists’ case before them. Strange to
say, it was from this first public meeting of
ex-convicts, nearly 70 years ago, that our
present free institutions and Responsible
Government arose. Stranger still, it is to
ex-convict Eagar, the emancipist attorney,
that Australia to-day owes primarily the insti-
tutions it possesses. For with him began the
agitation, afterwards taken up by Wardell and
Wentworth, which opened with a demand
for a recognition of the civil rights of Eman-
cipists, and only broke off short at the grant-
ing of Responsible Government in 1856.
Eagar went home as one of the ex-convict
delegation, and never returned to the colony
to claim the statue he thus earned.
Macquarie had not much to say while this
agitation was going on, for by this time the
long opposition of the Pure Merinos was
beginning to tell on himself. It would be

strange if, after unintermittent attacks, ex-
tending over twelve years, with opposition
in the colony and slanders at home, no
results were to be produced. Macquarie was
called on to explain the charges made against
him —why he built hospitals and churches,
laid good roads, and softened the lot of
suffering convict wretches. This fine old
soldier made a splendid reply. He described
the state of the colony when he came: there
were not 12,000 people, or 8000 acres under
crops ; the port dues were under £BOOO.
Against this he described the colony as it
was : nearly 40,000 people, 33,000 acres
under tillage, and port dues of £30,000 per
annum. The monuments of his excellent rule
were broadcast throughout the land. The con-
vict population had been relieved. But “even
my work of charity,” said Macquarie, re-
At this part of our story the name of Dr.
Lang suggests itself. This fine old Scotch
parson came to the
colony just two years
— ' after Macquarie left,
while his brother
arrived in the year of
that event. From the
moment he felt the
his combative nature
whenever his sympa-
thies were aroused.
The son of an Ayrshire
peasant, he had strong
prejudices and equally
strong sympathies ;
but, so far as he knew,
and according to his
lights, he did good
work in his day. The
honest old Doctor’s
heart was in the right
place, and he sounded
the first note of Aus-
tralian national aspira-
29
ferring to the charges of his enemies, “in
endeavouring to restore emancipated and re-
formed convicts to a level with their fellow-
subjects—a work which, considered either
from a religious or a political point of view,
I shall ever value as the most meritorious
part of my administration—has not escaped
their animadversion.” But the slanders of
his enemies carried weight. Sir Thomas
Brisbane came in December, 1821, and
Macquarie went home with the benedictions
of the poorer classes in his ears to die three
years later—another victim to the powerful
remnant of the “ Rum-selling Corps.”

CHAPTER XXI.
WHITE SLAVERY,
Macquarie went
home, as was said,
with the benedictions
of the poor in his ears.
There is a slanderous
and blackguardly book,
published by Major
Mudie—who was very
properly horsewhipped
in Sydney for his lite-
rary larrikinism —and
known as the ‘ ‘ Felonry
of New South Wales,”
in which the case as
between Macquarie
and Commissioner
Bigge is squarely put;
and it must be owned
that Mudie, whom we
will tie up to the tri-
angles when his turn
comes, was not preju-
diced in favour of
Macquarie’s work.
* ‘ Mr. Commissioner
Bigge,” says this red-
f| iffi I handed witness,
JJpH i • “busied himself, as is
well known, infinitely
! more in pointing out
and sanctioning trump-
ed-up charges against
AT PARRAMATTA.” the Governor, than in
ascertaining the actual
condition of the colony, which was his mis-
sion. He took every uncandid and unfair
advantage ; while the vipers and unprinci-
pled men . . . filled the ear of the com-
missioner with everything that slander could
invent or misrepresentation fashion into im-
putation upon the venerable representative
of their sovereign. The commission, there-
fore, instead of being an enquiry into the


state of the colony, was engaged in getting
hold of everything that could in any way
degrade or atfect the good name of the
Governor.’’ So much for Mr. Bigge. Mac-
quarie’s death was attributed, by those who
knew him best, to the effect of the Botany
Bay calumnies with which he had been pur-
sued. Sir Charles Forbes, Bart., a man of
public virtue and private benevolence, pro-
nounced his eulogium in the House of Com-
mons, and his intimate knowledge of Indian
and colonial affairs was understood to give
the weight of authoritative decision to his
high opinion of Governor Macquarie’s official
conduct.
“So many disgraceful things have oc-
curred with regard to New South Wales,”
says this sensitive candidate for the public
horsewhipping he afterwards received, “ that
it is absolutely painful to record them ! ”
And then he goes on to tell the old story
about the appointment of the first Arch-
deacon of New South Wales. Mr. Bigge had
taken out to Botany Bay as his clerk, ai per-
son named Scott, who had failed in London
as a wine-merchant. This Scott was active
in collecting charges against Macquarie from
the Pure Merinos, and “the clerk,” we are
told, “ could condescend to practices from
which the dignity of the commissioners must
have shrunk.” There were few rat-holes
into which this ferret could not enter, and
his employers were not ungrateful. An ap-
pointment was asked for him. There was
none vacant. But that was a small difficulty
while it was possible to make one. So Earl
Bathurst was persuaded to nominate Mr.
Scott, the bankrupt wine-merchant, as Arch-
deacon of New South Wales at an apostolic
salary of £2OOO per annum. Concerning
whom there is told a certain frivolous story.
Now, in those days, the editor and pro-
prietor of one of the Sydney newspapers was,
strangely enough, a pew-renter in the Arch-
deacon’s Church of St. James, in Sydney.
He was moved of the Evil One to offer
certain cynical observations in his paper re-
specting the new Archdeacon; and the
wisdom of the serpent in that reverend if
somewhat vinous person prompted him to
retaliate and scoop the offender’s pew. The
editor was served with a notice to take pos-
session of another pew “in a cold and com-
fortless part of the church.” He objected,
and was told that police constables would
be placed to keep the pew against all comers,
and any trespassers would be forthwith
ejected from the house of prayer. Now,
the editor was the proud and happy pro-
genitor of no less than six large daughters ;
and every Sunday he made a descent in force
on the disputed dew, which had been locked
by the vinous Archdeacon and the name-plate
torn off, only to be repulsed by the constables
with their staves. At first the newspaper-man
contented himself with standing in the aisle,
in mute protest, while “ the delicate females
his daughters’ sat on the cold stone steps of
the altar-piece.” It must be confessed that
these proceedings lent an agreeable attrac-
tiveness to the church service ; and we
learn that every Sunday the building was
crowded by congregations that the Arch-
deacon’s eloquence failed to attract, who
trooped in to see the pantomime. It is to
be remembered that there were fewer
theatrical performances in those days than
now Ifut standing in the aisle soon proved
as tame and spiritless a course of conduct
for the father as sitting on the cold stone
steps, even of an altar-piece, was to
his daughters. So he excogitated a new
development, and every now and then,
when the proud Archdeacon wasn’t look-
ing, the newspaper man would swoop down on
one of his fair progeny, and, amid a whirl
of white drapery and a flutter as of apoca-
lyptic wings, the young lady would perform a
thrilling acrobatic feat with her parent’s as-
sistance, and land with more or less elegance
though always with considerable spirit, on
the inside of the pew. The congregation
liked that. But the proud Archdeacon in
his scarlet pride thought this was running
the authorised performance rather close—
there were no choirs of surpliced ladies
then ! —so he had the pew decked over with
boards, held down with bars and screws to
defeat the newspaper man. That stopped
him. Then he took the case into court, seeing
that it was likely to afford no more whole-
some fun, and wrung the Archdeacon’s
bosom by obtaining damages for illegal
ejection from his pew. Mr. Scott went
home then, and his spirited apostolate came
abruptly to a close.
The rule of Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.8.,
began on December 1, 1821. He was a
Scotchman, and acute. He saw that Mac-
quarie made unnecessary trouble for himself
by his conscientiousness, so he determined
to let Botany Bay have its own way. He
built an observatory at Parramatta, there-
fore, and occupied himself in keeping a
strict eye on the movements of Venus and
Jupiter, While he followed the stars in
their courses through a narrow tube the
Pure Merinos took everything into their own
hands more completely than ever. The
old trading monopolies grew up again,
and the old atrocities, and the old squalor.
Convicts shrieked under the cat again, and
dangled on gibbets as of old; the settlers
were exploited and robbed on the old sys-
tem, and all the miseries of the “rum era ”
were renewed once more. And still Go-
vernor Brisbane, in his eyrie at Parramatta,
complacently surveyed the stars.
Free immigration began to set in in larger
numbers now than ever before, and as most
of those who came brought some little money
with them, they are usually described as
being of a better class than those who reached
Botany Bay up to this time. If a new
arrival could prove to the Governor his
ability to maintain five convicts for a fixed
number of years, and was prepared to enter
into a bond to that effect, he received a grant
of 500 acres of land, with a breeding cow
to each convict. For ten convict ser-
vants he received 1000 acres and ten
cows ; and so on. From this dates
the real beginning of the convict as-
signment system, though, of course, convict
servants had been assigned out more or less
from the first days of the settlement. The
demand for convict labour became so great
that “ though great multitudes were an-
nually transported from England, numbers
of free immigrants had to wait, with great
no more.
inconvenience, for convict servants with
whose labour to cultivate their lands.”
It is needless to explain at this late hour
of the day that convict service was in reality
a kind of white slavery, intensified by
all the most degrading and repulsive
features of negro slavery, but also with some
superadded horrors of its own. On their
arrival, the convicts were first drafted off
into the convicts’ depot at Hyde Park,
There applications were attended to, and
white labour portioned off among the appli-
ants in their due proportions. Major
Goulburn was the Governor’s Grand Yizier
in those days, and the centre of the iniqui-
tous system at whose heart he sat like some
ill-omened spider in its web, disposing of the
souls and bodies of convict men and women
just as he disposed of the Government
cattle and sheep. The “ impenetrable
Major,” they called him in those days,
and it can easily be imagined what an
object of awe this all-powerful official was
to the men and women whose lives lay at the
mercy of his slightest sign. His was an iron
rule. The colony was a prison, he said, and
the prisoners were to be treated accordingly.
So they were. The Major was head turn-
key, and all the duties of Custom-house
officer, treasurer, and collector of revenue
were discharged by him. He grew so
despotic and so irresponsible at last, that,
like all men who have been entrusted
with powers which prove too much
for them, he forgot his duty to his
head-gaoler, the Governor, and wanted to
dictate to him, too. The home Government
recalled both of them, and the house of cards
the “impenetrable Major” had built fell
about his ears in a moment. It is quite in-
teresting to see these all-powerful Botany
Bay potentates knocked over like nine-pins
by the merest breath of Imperial authority.
Judges, governors, gaolers, even the floggers
and hangmen themselves had to grovel
piteously when the Colonial Office spoke.
And so Major Goulburn went home, to spend
his old age in bitterly remorseful memories
of Botany Bay ; and this story knows him
The assignment system was actually com-
menced by Hunter, and lasted up to 1838.
It will be remembered that Phillip once
wrote of the Botany Bay settlement, that
“ there can be no slavery in a free land, and
consequently no slaves. ” These fine words
fell signally to the ground. From the
moment the assignment system was intro-
duced until the despatch was received for
its discontinuance, a form of slavery more
degrading than any Assyria or Louisiana ever
knew—more disgraceful than negro slavery
as the white man is above the black
—held its unbridled course in New South
Wales. It is startling to think that
it is not yet fifty years since these horrors
passed away, and that some of the persons
responsible for their existence still exercise
legislative power under the free institutions
of to-day. The convict was in the hands of
the official, body and soul. This state of
things generated a condition of cringing
servitude on the one side, and on the other
a class sentiment of authority and assertion
of superiority, both of which still strongly


In the book Lang imaginatively called his
history there is a de-
scription of the way
the system worked,
illustrated by exam-
ples. He takes the
common case of an
emigrant settler—it is
to be remembered that
Lang was an eye-wit-
ness of all these things
—who returns to his
farm after an absence
of some weeks idling
about the country, and
finds that his servants
have been idle in his
aosence. He curses
and swears at them
until a man who has
seen better days for-
gets himself so far as
to reply to his ruffianly
master. The convict
is at once haled before
the next magistrate,
who orders the delin-
quent to receive 25
lashes or more. As
soon as the man is fit
for labour he is put to
the plough, which he
takes the opportunity,
perhaps, to break on a stump. He is sent to
the chain-gang for a term, and when that
is over he escapes to the bush, perhaps
murdering his tyrant, or setting fire to
his homestead. It was so that bush-
rangers were manufactured. Lang adds that
the escapees perhaps rob a settler’s cart
for food a few days after their escape, are
captured, and hanged as a matter of course.
And, speaking of his own solemn experience
as a clergyman in these cases, he further
adds that the ‘ 1 wretched men assure the
minister who may visit them in gaol or
attend them on the scaffold, that it was the
arbitrary and unfeeling conduct of their
masters alone that brought them to an
untimely end.”

These women had unlimited freedom of in-
tercourse among themselves in the prison-
room, and on a certain portion of the deck
at a fixed part of the day, and this com-
pleted the corruption of the younger among
them. The discipline of the female convicts
was entrusted to the surgeon, and many
stories are told about the lady-favourites of
the surgeons, and their conduct towards the
rest of their fellow-convicts.

! deal might be said on
\ this subject, but we
' prefer to leave these
extracts to speak for
N\/\y themselves in this un-
-J—'-Z_ * savoury connection.
At the same time it may
be added that if the
writer on Australian
subjects is to be
squeamish on those
matters there would be no such thing as
Australian history at all. Most of our early
story is made up that way.
When the Australian colonist of to-day, who
does not belong to the past of Australian
history and has no sympathy with it, looks
back to see what the coming nation owes to
the mother-country, the disembarking of
the cargo of one of these convict-women ships
will afford one crushing answer. The women
who were sent out here with the full and
avowed intention of making them the mothers
of the future Australian men and women
were such demireps and harridans as our
eye-witnesses’ extracts have described.
When it shall become necessary, by-and-
bye, to tell Imperial officialdom that its day
in Australia is over, those who are called on
to say as much will have to remember this
fact, and nerve themselves to meet the sneer
that will remind them of what the mother
country kindly decided in their regard.


The female convicts were assigned within
eight or ten days after their landing, and
when the applicants were all supplied the
remainder were sent to the Women’s Fac-
tory, at Parramatta. .That den of iniquity
contained at times many hundreds of women,
of all classes ; from the rustic girl to the
swell mobsman’s “lady.” They were divided
into three sections. The first was made
up of those who had never been as-
signed, or who, having been sent out to
service, had been returned to the Factory
without any recorded complaint against
them. The third class contained those who
had been returned from service for insubor-
dination, or otherwise giving trouble, and
female convicts who had been sentenced for
offences committed in the colony to terms
not long enough for transportation. The
second class was filled by those who had
completed their term of sentence.
For the demirep class of convict women
the factory was rather a pleasant asylum
than otherwise. “ The females pass their
time in sufficient merriment,” we are told,
“ relating to each other their former his-
tories, their amours and debaucheries, the
thefts in which they have been concerned,
and the crimes for which they respectively
received sentence of transportation.” So
much was this recognised that it was said to
be a common thing for female convicts of
this class to demand of their mistresses to
send them there, and “ flatly and with fear-
ful oaths to disobey their orders for the pur-
pose of securing the accomplishment of their
wish.” But it was the women of the other
class—the poor creatures who, for some
petty offence had been torn away from their
homes as hundreds were in those days, and
sent to herd with felons at Botany Bay, that
felt the full horror of this dreadful abode.
The chaplain Marsden—he was familiarly
known as “ Old Flog’em ” by these Factory
women —prescribed a flogging for all
breaches of discipline, and the lash was
always going in some part of the establish-
ment or other, so that the chaplain’s nick-
name was suggested by his favourite phrase,
The Factory was also a kind of matrimo-
nial bureau. When the convict could obtain
his master’s consent, he repaired to the Factory
to select a wife. Then the unmarried belles
were drawn up in line before this modern
Paris of Botany Bay, whose duty it was to
award the prize for which the goddesses dis-
puted of old. Many were the languishing
graces and captivating arts used to influence
the hesitating swain, and some future poet or
painter of Botany Bay will doubtless arise to
do tardy justice to these novel conditions of
love’s young dream. When Paris made his
selection and his critical eye was satisfied,
he crooked his finger and said “’Ere!”
to the blushing damsel, capriciously coy, on
whom he had fixed his young affections.
They talked it over together, and the other
ladies looked on. Sometimes the fair one
was difficult, and the terms could not be
arranged. She was sent back to her place
in the ranks of female loveliness, and
another selection made without a moment s
hesitation There is no record of any swain
having been rendered desperate by this out-
rage to his blighted affections.
In some cases when free settlers made
their selection in this way, it was found after
the honeymoon that the dispositions of the
twain were incompatible. Then the dis-
carded wife was promptly “turned in ” to
the Factory, and a new selection made.
There was an easy facility about this method
of divorce that recommended itself.
The ill-treatment of the convict women
among the settlers was so general that most
of them preferred to be in the Factory to
being sent out to service. Servitude under
one master for two years entitled these
women to a ticket-of-leave, but during that
time they were very often the creatures of
the irresponsible caprice of their mistresses
—and only a woman with power over another
can really exhaust the art of cruelty in all its
ramifications and possibilities. Of the five
“he crooked his finger and
or six hundred women with which the Fac-
tory was always peopled, from one to two
hundred were always mothers of illegitimate
children.
The distance from Sydney to Parramatta
by water is about 14 miles. Women were
conveyed there in boats under the escort of
a guard of soldiers. Judge Therry, in his
Reminiscences, gives an account of _ these
water-picnics. He describes the soldiers as
taking provisions and rum with them in their
boats —provisioning them as if for a
lengthened cruise. As soon as they got
away from the city a scene of drunken
revelry commenced. It took the soldiers
and their convoys sometimes seven days to
perform that journey of 14 miles. The
reader may consult the Reminiscences of
the learned J udge for further information on
this and other kindred subjects. E
Another feature about the assignment of
convict servants was that men were often
assigned to their wives, and wealthy trans-
portees to their friends When a man was
convicted in London or elsewhere, he was
sent to Botany Bay as a convict while his
wife or any woman who passed as such—
forged certificates were always Common in
Botany Bay—followed him in the first ship
with the booty. She got her husband
assigned to her. Sometimes the arrange-
ment worked well, and sometimes not. But
this novel matrimonial device had certain
advantages. For it often happened that
when the husband forgot his changed
position—that he was a convict assigned
to his wife, in short—these matter-of-
fact women were careful to impress the
fact on their affectionate spouses This
produced words and sometimes a quar-
rel. But the women
were quite equal to the
conflict. They just
handed their quondam
lords and masters over
to the nearest con-
stable, who brought
them before a magis-
trate. That excellent
man promptly sen-
tenced them to be
flogged as convicts who
had shown themselves
insubordinate in their
assigned service, and
so the balance of mari-
tal power was in some
measure equalised.
These playful proceed-
ings put the domestic
question in quite a
novel and captivating
light
After what has been
said it is almost un-
.jv- , -jo necessary to add that
" the morality of the
town of Sydney itself
was at a hopelessly low
ebb. The practice of
concubinage was com-
mon up to the time of
1 KRK ' Governor Bourke, and
a general profligacy
had gangrened the whole of the com-
munity. The immoral customs of the
town were so flagrant and so notorious
that no one ever thought of censuring '
another unless it was for falling behind-
hand in these brutalities of wanton-
ness that had no redeeming feature _ to
soften the repulsiveness of their vice.
People have been brutal and coarse be-
fore, but most that have distinguished
themselves in that way knew how to throw
a glamour of some kind or another over
their excesses. The villa of Lucullus saw
strange sights, and azure Capri has mir-
rored other scenes besides those of cloud
and sky in its day. The story of such
places has been told in more than one way,
but most of those who have told of them
have had something else to relate besides
mere records of salaciousness. But in Sydney
everything was bestial. There was no public


redeeming trait. Perhaps the most repul-
sive picture ever limned by the historian is
that cruelly graphic description of Sydney
of 40 years ago that stands on record in the
second volume of Justin McCarthy's “ His-
tory of Our Own Time.”
CHAPTER XXHI.
Yictis!
If the New South Wales Corps left any-
one whatever behind to represent it, this was
surely the time to find its representatives in
full activity. Unless the leopard had changed
its spots altogether, this was certainly the
set of circumstances calculated to bring them
out in their true colours. The atmosphere
of moral filth which we have rather hinted
at than described, was the native air of what
was now the aristocratic element in the
colony. It might indeed be alleged that
their fine barbaric spirit had been veneered
over by wealth by this time, and that they
had settled down to honest courses and a
bourgeois virtue. But the characteristics of
the Corps were too deeply ingrained for that,
and under favourable circumstances like the
present they were brought out as naturally
as heat brings out vermin. Under such
extraordinarily promising conditions the
Pure Merinos felt it incumbent on them-
selves to show their mettle and do justice
to their training.
While Governor Brisbane was following
the stars in their courses in his eyrie at
Parramatta—the curious reader may yet see
the corner-stone of his observatory beside
Old Government House there—the Pure
Merinos had everything their own way.
While this Governor took charge of the solar
system, his subordinates had full control
over that insignificant portion of our own
planet nominally committed to his care.
The active concerns of government passed
from his hands to those of his officials, and
as Mr. Commissioner Bigge had censured
Macquarie for his efforts to redeem the con-
victs from their hopeless condition, Brisbane
was determined not to fall into the same
Wunder. Consequently the Pure Merinos
arranged these matters after their own plans,
and the last state of the unhappy convict
became worse than the first. But what was
much more to the purpose for these people,
the Governor no longer endeavoured to
regulate the trading concerns of the settle-
ment as his predecessor had done, and the
old iniquitous system of monopoly and
spoliation began again as actively as ever.
The Pure Merinos obtained command of the
market, using the ill-gotten wealth they had
amassed for the purpose, and the condition of
things was soon as bad as it had ever been
under the sailor-governors.
Trading operations were carried on under
a system of exchange. The settler who sent
a consignment of wheat to the King’s Store
at Sydney obtained a receipt from the com-
missariat officer in charge. This receipt he
passed on to the merchant, in exchange for
rum and other necessaries of life —such as
clothing, provisions, and the like. The mer-
chants were principally the Pure Merinos ;
and they, true to the traditions of their
order, charged most exorbitant rates for the
accommodation they thus gave the poorer
settlers. The consequence was that these,
as a class, plunged deeply into debt. It is
said that nine-tenths of the population were
hopelessly involved in this way during the
rule of Sir Thomas Brisbane. During Mac-
quarie’s time they were, to some extent,
protected against any undue use being made
by their creditors of the great power thus
gained. As the goods turned into the store
were sold, these creditors were paid in whole
or in part, and so the process went on. But
with the new Governor the harpies saw their
chance, and took it. Brisbane did not in-
terfere in such matters, and in 1822 an order
was issued in his name by the officials,
stating that in future all grain should be
supplied to the store by tender, and that no
produce would be received at any one time
beyond the amount required for the next ensu-
ing quarter. This step was taken concurrently
with another that worked exactly in the
same direction. This was to change the
circulating medium suddenly from colonial
currency to sterling coin. This notable
project at once raised the pound sterling 25
per cent, above the pound currency—for up
to that time the medium of exchange in the
colony was made up in motley fashion from
English coins, Spanish dollars, moidores,
and pieces of eight.
The devilish ingenuity that devised this
double-handled weapon soon put it to active
use. Two results at once accrued —the
King’s Store as a market for the settlers’
produce was suddenly closed, and the money
of the settlement was depreciated in value.
The natural effect followed. There was a
rush of settlers with grain to the temporary
market opened for the collection of the
quarter’s supplies, and at the same moment
a demand from the creditors for the settle-
ment of outstanding accounts. The settler
found himself in this position. Any money he
held was reduced in value 25 per cent, by the
change of currency, and the Commissariat
receipts which he usually gave as securities
for his debts were about to be withheld
from issue. - They were ready to sell at any
price to save themselves from ruin ; but
the King’s Store was only prepared to buy
three months’ supply. They, therefore,
competed to undersell each other, to get the
benefit of the market while it was open, and
wheat, which had rated at from 7s. 6d. to 10s.
per bushel, was eagerly offered at 3s. 9d.
currency. The traders profited by this fall
in price to make their claims, and the
amount of their debts was paid six-fold in
the value of the produce they received.
This sudden fall in prices gave rise to an
impression that grain was superabundant in
the settlement, and that over-cultivation had
produced a supply in excess of the wants of
the population. Unrestrained waste and
profusion became the order of the day.
Produce was valued at little or nothing.
Provisions were wasted. And reckless im-
providence soon cleared the way for the mis-
take to show itself. Before the season was
over the supply of grain was exhausted.
Famine began to menace the community,
and the prices rose to 245. per bushel.
Distress and ruin threatened the agricultural
and city population alike. And still the
Governor in his eyrie at Parramatta com-
placently surveyed the stars.
It would be almost impossible to credit
the villainy of persons who could prompt
the framing of these regulations in their
own selfish interest did we not know some-
thing of their history. Studied malignity
marked their action in planning this diabo-
lical plot against a whole community, and
the way they set to work to take unsparing
advantage of that plot’s success. The long
array of debts contracted by the settlers
was suddenly produced. Peremptory de-
mands for payment were made by these
Shylocks in the face of the prevailing dis-
tress. Time was refused, an immediate
settlement insisted upon, and in default the
pound of flesh was mercilessly exacted.
Macquarie’s little grants of land were swal-
lowed up wholesale. The poor rewards of
industry fell into the insatiable maws of
these ruffianly usurers. Farms were seized
for one-fourth of their value. The cost of
goods exchanged in advance against Com-
missariat receipts over long periods of years
was calculated at, for the lowest, 100 per
cent, above their value; the difference between
sterling and currency was availed of to the
utmost; and with vulpine craft in a dozen
tortuous ways with which the usurer and
the money-changer are cunningly familiar, the
settlers were exploited and preyed upon by
the merchant class, their little holdings for-
feited, and the enlightened experiment of
Macquarie stultified and blasted before it had
time to take definite shape.
That this plot had been craftily schemed
by the Pure Merinos for some time is proved
by the fact that they persuaded Mr. Com-
missioner Bigge to recommend the tender
system in his report. It will be remembered
that the King’s Store was opened to the
settlers by Bhgh and Macquarie to snatch
them out of the clutches of the officers of
the New South Wales Corps. It was the
first object of these people to get back their
power when the tide turned, and what they
were no longer able to do by force or rebel-
lion they now did by cunning and craft.
While Brisbane was star-gazing, they put
Bigge’s recommendation into effect.**- But
they added a little feature of their own.
That fatuous person had some faint glimmer
of intelligence or honesty of purpose, or
some other valuable abstract virtue of the
kind; and, moreover, he had no interest in
being an absolute miscreant. When he re-
commended the tender system, therefore, he
added that as much superfluous grain as
possible should be bought at all times, as
a provision against droughts and floods.
Had this been done the market would have
been kept open to the settlers. But this
was not what the Pure Merinos wanted. So
they suppressed and altered that part of the
recommendation, and shut the market prac-
tically altogether. The conduct of the persons
who deliberately reversed the Commis-
sioner’s recommendations is self-condemna-
tory. It proves what one would willingly
be reluctant in believing that creatures
could exist of such depravity as these, to
plot against the welfare of a whole com-


munity in their own selfish interests, and
prostitute otfieial power to such an end. But
this was in Botany Bay.
There was no degradation so deep that
these wretches could not find a deeper
depth. One fact will speak more for the
real character of the men than whole pages
of description. The proceedings we have
detailed plunged the settlement into famine
and distress. People wanted food. There was
grain locked up in the warehouses of these
cold-blooded tyrants, but the victims were too
poor to buy that. When the distress was at
its height a vessel was sent to Batavia for
rice, wheat, and other supplies for the
relief of the suffering people. This was
done by order of the Governor, whose
eyes had now been opened to his own
culpable negligence by the misery he
saw around him. When the ship returned
to Sydney with its precious freight, so
anxiously expected, the Pure Merinos saw
that the destitution out of which they were
making profit as carrion-birds fatten on a
carcase was about to be relieved. So they
laid another plot, and it would be hard to
believe that Mr. John Macarthur had
nothing to do with this, for he was back in
the colony long before this time. It was
one of the privileges of the East India Com-
pany that no vessel should carry tea out of
Indian waters without the license of the
Directors; and the Company’s charter em-
powered them to seize any vessel so trans-
gressing as a lawful prize. Now, the relief
ship from Batavia carried a small packet of
lOlbs. of tea, a present to a Government
officer in Sydney. The Pure Merinos in-
formed the captain of a ship-of-war then in
port of tiiis heinous crime. It might be
thought that the charter of the great East
India Company was not intended to refer to
a present of lOlbs. of tea. But the result of
the criminal and unpatriotic act of the Pure
Merinos was that the relief vessel, with all
its anxiously-expected supplies of food for
a starving people, was forcibly seized and
carried off by the man-of-war in defiance of
the Governor, and of the entreaties of the
famishing population who looked hopelessly
and helplessly on. The warship with its
prey swept down the harbour and through
the Heads out to sea. The relief-vessel was
sold as a prize in an Indian port. And the
Pure Merinos were saved.
These things appear to have galvanized
the Governor into something like activity at
last. The misery and privation of the
people around him opened his eyes to the
results of his negligence and infidelity to
duty. He made enquiries into matters
generally, and was not slow to find out that
the conflict between the Pure Merinos
and the Emancipists lay at the base
fo all the distress that had accrued. He
found himself unpopular with the masses,
because they looked on him. as the passive
instrument of the officials. And he was not
long in finding out, also, that these same
men condemned the very measures they had
themselves devised and carried out. They
followed their old custom, too, in slandering
him to the authorities at home. Probably
this fact had something to dp with his con-
duct when he began to take an active in-
terest in affairs. One of his first acts was to
take up the cause of the Emancipists, and
during the last year of his government he
began to encourage the more wealthy mem-
bers of this class. He even went so far as to
agree to accept a banquet at the hands of the
leading Emancipists. This unheard-of atro-
city was a challenge to the Pure Merinos.
It brought out one of their best efforts.
Of course, Mr. John Macarthur had a hand
in this villainy. Wherever in the early his-
tory of Botany Bay we come across anything
particularly disgusting we may confidently
look for this good man’s name. The invita-
tion to the dinner of the Emancipists was
given, and duly accepted by the Governor.
The Pure Merinos had also prepared their
little banquet, and Brisbane, being un-
willing to accept both invitations, suggested
that six of the leading Emancipists
might be invited as representatives to the
official demonstration. The committee re-
fused this compromise ; their finer feelings
and that nice sense of social distinction
which were so peculiarly their own rebelled
against this affront. So the Governor an-
nounced that no further preparations might
be made for his company, and a few even-
ings later attended the Emancipists’ banquet
at Nash’s Hotel, Parramatta. Addresses
were presented by the people, who recognised
that Brisbane’s errors were those of negli-
gence rather than of ill intent. Then the
Pure Merinos sailed in. Dr. Lang tells how on
returning from one of his many trips to Eng-
land, Mr. John Macarthur showed him a copy
of a document which that Botany Bay Machia-
velli had forwarded to Earl Bathurst. It
was a list of the names of those who had
attended the Brisbane banquet, with the
causes of their transportation set out at full
length, their career in the chain-gang and
under the lash, and the growth of their
prosperity subsequently—all from the Mac-
arthur point of view. “ I could not help
regarding with a strong feeling of repro-
bation,” says Lang, “ the superlatively evil
spirit which this precious document evinced,
while at the same time I could not help
admiring the consummate artifice with which
it was concocted.” But it must be remem
bered that its author was Macarthur, and he
had given himself plenty of practice. Lang
says in another place that he boasted to him
of having procured the recall of every
Governor up to Macquarie. His tactics in
this instance may be compared by the reader
with the anonymous newspaper episode in
the case of Governor Bligh.
CHAPTER XXIV.
Wentworth and Wardeel.
The picturesque highwayman of the Claude
Duval type had vanished as completely as G.
P. R. James’ solitary horseman long before
Botany Bay came into existence, and his
place was taken by the accomplished pick-
pocket of the Barrington order. The romance
of the road was done with and over. Gallant
figures in cocked hats and cambric frills
and laced coats no longer handed high-
born ladies from their carriages to trip a
measure under the greemvood tree before
they were eased of their purses. Houns-
low Heath was not haunted any more
after dark by the younger sons of the
nobility, who struck gallant attitudes and
cried “Stand and deliver!” in the moon-
light ; or by the penniless scions of old
Jacobite families eager to despoil the spoilers.
The honest fellow who sprang out of Shep-
herd’s Bush to suggest a startling alternative
to the belated wayfarer was but an ordinary
cutpurse or a footpad now, who was inno-
cent of linen commonly, whose coat was only
embroidered with tatters, and who wore
no frills—cambric or otherwise. Yet all the
same there were occasions every now and
then when young fellows were captivated by
stories of those old knights, of the road —
“ Diana’s horsemen,” as they called them-
selves—and longed to emulate the enter-
prises of these minions of the moon. They
were hanged as soon as they were caught,
of course. But perhaps they thought it as
well to fall into the hands of a Bow-street
runner as into those of the press-gang. And
perhaps, after all, they saw very little dif-
ference between a leap in the air and having
one’s legs shot away in some of the gallant
Nelson’s naval wars. So every now and then
there was a story of some young fellow who
threw his life away with all the airy abandon
of the most lightsome cavalier who ever blew
the foam from a tankard of nut-brown ale on
the way to Tyburn Tree.
One dark night towards the end of last
century a Dublin alderman, who was slum-
bering in his coach as it rumbled along
one of the roads that led out of his
native city, was drowsily aware of the
clatter of horses’ hoofs in his neighbour-
hood, and before he was well awake the
challenge of a highwayman rung out on the
crisp night air. The worthy citizen had only
time to see his chaise-lamps flash on the
masked faces of two men whose horses
blocked the way. He was gagged with his
own wig, and bound before he knew any
more, and then a blunderbuss-shot from the
roadside blew away the top of one highway-
man’s head, and nothing more was known of
the occurrence until the coach and its gagged
owner were found in the morning. Only it
may be added that a young medical student
was arrested as one of the actors in this
little drama, and transported, on very slender
evidence, be it added, to Botany Bay. He
might have been hanged for his alleged
share in this freak had it not been for that
fortunate discovery of Captain Cook a very
few years before. This was one way of
coming to Australia in those days, but there
were a good many others,
* * *
Quite early in the history of the settlement
there was a certain young man employed as
an assistant to the Sydney surgeon, and as
he was a useful fellow of a respectable
family and connections, he began to prosper
presently. He was sent to Norfolk Island as
medical officer, and, having married in the
meantime, a son was born there in 1791, who
afterwards achieved some fame in this part
of the world under the name of William
Charles Wentworth. The elder Wentworth
afterwards became a magistrate of Sydney
and Principal Superintendent of Police, as
well as being a merchant, contractor, and


other lucrative things besides. He sent his
son away from his dismal surroundings as
soon as he could —at the age of seven years, in
fact —to receive his early training as far as
possible away from Botany Bay and its
influences. The boy returned to Sydney
later on, to be shocked and disgusted,
doubtless, at what he saw around him
there, and then went back to England to
finish his scholastic career at Cambridge. He
wrote some verses which have been quoted
in colonial books and speeches so often as to
be perfectly nauseous in the ears of Austra-
lian readers.
Young Wentworth came back to Sydney
in 1824 as a barrister-at-law. He brought
with him his friend, Dr. Wardell, also a
barrister, and both together entered on.the
practice of their profession in the colony.
They threw in their powerful sympathies
with the Emancipists. It is possible that
the generous spirit of these young men re-
volted at the squalid meanness and petty
tyranny they saw everywhere around them,
and that Wentworth particularly, as one
of the native-born, yearned to do something
to sweep away the organised oppression and
injustice that degraded his native land even
in his own eyes, and which must certainly
have struck him with special force, fresh as
he was from the atmosphere of an English
University. As we go on we will see that
he never entirely got rid of the results of
this academical training, and that the class
traditions he imbibed there threw him out
of harmony with the real Democratic spirit
that sprang up in Australia when convictism
had passed away. But this was one of those
things that came later.
About this time—in March, 1824—arrived
also the first Chief Justice, Francis Forbes.
He brought the first Charter of Justice with
him—for the Draconic code promulgated by
Phillip under a gum-tree at the head of
Sydney Cove can scarcely be called by that
name. It was a fortunate circumstance that
this worthy Judge arrived about the same
time as Wentworth and Wardell, for, as we
shall see, they mutually assisted in each
other’s work, and in the long run worked
together for the eventual emancipation of
the populace. Forbes, before leaving Eng-
land, had been entrusted with the duty of
drawing up a Charter for New South Wales,
and it is to him that the settlement owes its
first steps towards those representative in-
stitutions and the right of trial by jury that
came afterwards. The strongest proof of
the extreme bad faith with which Australian
history has been compiled and the fraudu-
lent spirit in which it has been written, is
provided by the fact that so little mention
has been made of the name of our first Chief
Justice. The same reasons that made the
names of the Macarthurs and the gaoler-
governors prominent in our historical re-
cords have operated to suppress such names
as that of our first Chief Justice.
Chief Justice Forbes was a Bermudan,
and his career in the colony is a strange in-
stance of a colonial official breaking away from
his early surroundings and training to re-
cognise the justice of popular claims. He
came to Sydney on the departure of Judge
Field, and the first Attorney-General, Mr.
Saxe-Bannister, and the first Solicitor-
General, Mr. John Stephen, followed him
the same year. His first act on arrival was
to promulgate the Charter of Justice at the
Supreme Court, at Government House, and
in the public market-place. This Charter,
based as we have said on an Act framed
by himself before he left England, was the
first public act that lifted the people of the
colony from the servile position they had
“stand and deliver!”
hitherto occupied at the mercy of the irre-
sp Jixsible official and military authorities. The
first Legislative Council was established,
consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor,
General Stewart, Judge Forbes, Colonial
Secretary Goulburn, Surveyor-General Oxley,
James Bowman, and John Macarthur. Any
Act of this Council, in order to become law,
equired the certificate of the Chief Justice,
and this prudent proviso worked most bene-
ficially in the public interest later on.
Up to this time no jury of civilians had
ever sat in New South Wales, and when at
the Quarter Sessions Court held at Liver-
pool, on October 14, 1824, Judge Forbes
directed the empanelling of a civil jury for
the first time, the magistrates, following the
traditions of the class to which they almost
exclusively belonged, refused their consent
to this measure of reform. The matter was
argued in the Supreme Court before the
Chief Justice, who decided against these ob-
structive magistrates.
It will be seen that
this innovation was
actually forced on the
colony, in a measure,
in opposition to the
will of the leading
colonists themselves.
At the sitting of the
Supreme Court next
year a jury was again
empanelled, but this
time the Pure Merinos
tried another strata-
gem. When the lists
were made known it
was found that the
Emancipists were en-
tirely unrepresented.
Wentworth and War-
dell had brought out
with them to the colony
a small printing-plant,
with which they started
the Australian news-
paper on October 14,
1824—about a month
after their arrival. The
Australian took up
the cau e of the Eman-
cipists, and pointed
out the glaring in-
justice of a jury-list so
framed. The Eman-
cipists placed their
case in the hands of
Wentworth and War-
dell, who made an
application to the
Court to call on the
Sheriff to show cause
Avhy certain submitted
names should not be
inserted in the jury-
list. Chief Justice
Forbes was compelled
to rule against this
application on a techni-
cal ground, and for a
time the movement for
popular jury rights fell
through.
* * *
Two years later, at
held in the Court-
a public meeting held in the Court-
house, this right of juries was again brought
up by Wentworth, and a petition was
drawn up and sent home. By this time
ex-Governor Brisbane had returned to
England, and he used his interest in favour
of the popular movement. Sir J ames Macin-
tosh was induced to present the petition to
the Commons, and in his speech he referred
to the evidence of Governors Macquarie and
Brisbane and Chief Justice Forbes to prov«


that New South Wales was now as ripe for
the enjoyment of popular rights and privi-
leges as any other dependency of the British
Crown. But it was not until the time of
Governor Bourke that the right of trial by
jury was fully recognised in its complete
form.
In the meantime, circumstances were pre-
paring the colony and its people for the
struggle for popular privileges on which they
were about to enter. Those who formed the
rank-and-file of the population now saw
themselves for the first time a power in the
community. They had the most unbounded
confidence in the two young men whom a
happy chance had given them for their
leaders. Through them the voice of the
population at large was articulately given
forth, and the unfortunates who had hitherto
cringed under the lash of their masters now
found their wants and opinions actually pub-
lished and put forward in a newspaper of their
own. They welded their forces together,
and formed the Patriotic Association —not
confined to Emancipists alone, but embracing
all those free immigrants and settlers who
looked forward to the time when the new
country they were opening up should be freed
from the miseries that cursed it, and made
fit for their sons and daughters to live in.
While the Emancipists had been growing
in numbers and influence, they were also
growing in wealth. In many streets of what
is now old Sydney fine blocks of buildings
reared their stone fronts in the air, and it
became a not unusual thing to find names
that were first heard in the colony when
they were read from the manifest of a prison-
ship, now flaunting in carven stone on the
coping-stones of some of these pretentious
edifices. The poorer settlers and free immi-
grants who had been for some years in the
colony had also acquired wealth by this time,
but the exclusive spirit of the old propertied
classes had, so far, effectually shut them
out from any real influence in the com-
munity. Both these classes, therefore,
fell into line when the Patriotic Association
was formed, and mutually strengthened each
other’s hands. Up to this time, the only
newspaper in the colony was the old Sydney
Gazette, started in 1803; and that journal
did little else than chronicle the proceedings
of officialdom. The first issue of the Aus-
tralian, in the hands of its capable editors,
marked a new departure.
It was quite a new thing to find any
person of consequence in Botany Bay openly
advocating justice and denouncing wrong.
“Impenetrable Majors,” assisted by the
hangman and the flogger, had so cowed and
broken the spirit of the community that
men scarcely ventured to whisper their de-
testation of what they saw around them.
The younger race, born in the colony, had
become so inured to the daily and hourly
sights and sounds of the convict system that
it doubtless, in its limited experience, looked
on what it saw around it as nothing more
than the natural and proper condition of
things. C Under such circumstances it can
easily be conceived that the action of Went-
worth and Wardell brought in a tidal wave
of new ideas and popular aspirations that
perhaps gave courage to those who despaired
of the future of Botany Bay, and taught
those who knew no better that the condition
of things amongst which they lived was a
false and cruel one, and that something
better might be won by fighting for it.
Wentworth was a young Australian, as we
have seen, and Wardell a young English
gentleman. Trained and bred among asso-
ciations of culture and fine sympathetic in-
fluences, it was but natural that they should
have been both sickened and disgusted at
the state of things, which merely to describe
leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth of the
writer of Australian history. The task
before them must have appeared a hopeless
one, at the best, and it is something to
say of the bull-dog courage of these
young fellows that they did not shrink
back from the very first collision with the
constituted authority. How much their
perseverance is due to the action of Judge
Forbes it is, of course, hard to estimate
now. But it will be seen from what is to
follow in the new chapter of history we are
about to open that to the first Chief Justice
-s really due the credit of the first steps that
raised the colony from the slough of
officialism and convictism into which it had
fallen. Before we enter on the story of
the long constitutional struggle which was
now about to commence, there is one more
episode to be dealt with which will put the
positions of both parties in a clear light.
When Governor Brisbane left the colony
in December, 1825, he was succeeded by
Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling. His re-
putation had preceded him to Botany Bay.
When he landed, the crowd of people who
had assembled to see the new Governor
clustered silently about the wharf, and ' re-
frained from cheering. Darling entered on
his vice-royalty at once, and from the very
first he seems to have given the populace no
reason to repent of the coldness of the re-
ception they accorded him. During his
term of rule he came into conflict succes-
sively with the Chief Justice, with the Press,
with the Patriotic Association and its
leaders, and generally with the people
as a whole. He was a man after the Pure
Merinos’ own heart, and no man could have
been selected by the Home Office at this
juncture whose personality and opinions
were better calculated to harass and exacer-
bate the public sentiment of the people of
the young colony, or precipitate the free in-
stitutions that his irksome rule was largely
instrumental in calling into existence. The
chief sufferers from the tyrannical rule of
this “Bashaw, as he was called, were the
unhappy prisoners who laboured in the
chain-gangs of the colony. The soldiers of
the regiments on service in New South
Wales were almost as badly treated ; and it
is in connection with two of these that the
following story is told.
CHAPTER XXY.
The Story of Sudds.
Every now and then in those days there
would be a sound of martial music and a
gleam of scarlet coats along the green lanqs
of rural England, and the word would pass
round among the yokels that a party was out
recruiting soldiers for the King. Lusty
rustics listened agape while the glib ser-
geant told his story, and their hands closed
on the bright shilling, and they found the
cockade stuck on their hats before they
realised that they had enlisted. Then the
fife shrieked a farewell and the scarlet coats
flashed for a moment in the sun, and in a
few moments the green landscape closed on
the recruit, who left village and friends
behind him to follow the drum. Some of
these followed it to Botany Bay, where they
shared the barbarities of the convict system.
The story of Sudds and Thompson is one
of those that have passed into circulation in
connection with the barbarities of which the
old town of Sydney was the scene. From
what has gone before the reader will have
gathered that atrocities and cruelties were of
common occurrence ; and so much was this
really the case that incidents of the kind
were regarded in their day as being of so
commonplace a character as to be unworthy
of special notice or record. It is by an ac-
cident that we get accounts from time to
time, principally from the recollections of
old residents, of events and occurrences
that might well make the blood of the
reader of our dismal story curdle with hor-
ror, but which the good people of the past
regarded as things of every day. If we are
told sometimes that our penal laws, and our
eagerness to hang and flog offenders at the
present time, show a state of civilisation be-
hind the world’s average, our only excuse is
that we have not yet got away from the past
and its barbarism ; and so long as we con-
tinue to be ruled by the men of the past
and those who have inherited their tradi-
tions, we never shall.
Yet sometimes we find a thrilling incident
of peculiar atrocity standing out from the
sanguinary background of our early history
like the case of Sudds and Thompson. And
such a case serves to fill out the picture the
imagination has already coloured from our
early records, while giving it something
definite and concrete to go upon. There are
many stories of unhappy wretches condemned
to death for some petty offences, and dragged
in procession through the streets of Sydney,
with their coffins beside them in a cart. By
a refinement of cruelty they were made to
taste all the horrors of death and burial
before the last brutal exhibition was given
on Gallows Hill. Horrid tales still stand,
too, of men who died under the lash, cursing
their tyrants and their own hopeless lot.
But these, we repeat, were common —so
common as to become mere generalisations.
What we have now to tell is a tale of only
sixty years ago ; let it stand as a comment
on what has gone before.
Sudds and Thompson were two private
soldiers in the regiment then stationed in
New South Wales. Sudds was a Gloucester-
shire rustic, who had left a wife and child
in rural England behind him, when he en-
listed like the other louts of those days.
The other had nothing special about his
previous history. They came with their


regiment to New South Wales. In those
days the merry rule of the New South
Wales Corps was long since over. Under
the long-service army regulations of the
period the soldier’s term of service left
little of a life-time to spare between youth
and age. The contrast between the lot of
the soldier and that of the Emancipist was
a marked one. The convict who had passed
through the Moloch-sacrifice, and whose
term of five, seven, or ten years’ service
had been manumitted or served, might
afterwards use the advantages the colony
offered and acquire a fortune, as many
actually did. Thompson noted this, and he
soon made Sudds aware of the injustice of
serving in the ranks until old age came on,
while they saw the convicts they guarded
dropping their chains and gathering wealth
and comfort. Tempted by the prospect of
domestic enjoyment and by the arguments
of his companion, he decided that a con-
vict’s sentence and treatment made a fair
price to pay for the prospect of even an
Emancipist’s liberty. The two soldiers then
deliberately walked into a shop in Sydney,
and stole a piece of cloth in such an open
manner as to invite instant arrest. They
quickly cut the cloth into two parts, so that
each might be equally guilty. They were
tried, and, of course, convicted ; and sen-
tenced to seven years’ transportation to one
of the penal settlements.
Here the representative of Majesty
came upon the scene. Governor Darling
had no such mawkish scruples about inter-
fering with the course of “ justice ” as seems
to accompany even the exercise of the pre-
rogative of mercy in these days. He set
aside the sentence of the Court, and took the
offenders out of the hands of the civil power.
He altered the sentence to one of servitude
in irons for the same period on the public
roads of the colony—then to be returned to
service in their regiment. But he did not
stop here. This gross and most unjustifiable
interference with the processes of law after
sentence had been formally passed—this re-
condemnation of culprits for the same
offence—was not vindictive or cruel enough
to gratify Governor Darling’s diabolical in-
genuity. This ruffian Governor went a step
further, and added a pendant of such wanton
brutality as may well make the reader mar-
vel at such examples of man’s inhumanity to
man as those of which the old town of Syd-
ney has been the scene. He ordered the
prisoners to be brought out upon the bar-
rack-square—now Wynyard-square, Sydney
—and there, in the presence of their late
companions, to be stripped of their uniforms
and dressed in the yellow convict garb.
They were then to be loaded with irons,
joined from the ancles to a spiked iron
collar round their necks by a heavy chain.
These spiked collars were a special device of
the Governor. They were, finally, to be
drummed out of the regiment, the ‘ ‘ Rogues’
March ” being played after them with fife
and drum as they left the scene of their de-
gradation—a miserable spectacle for the
delight of fiends and men.
*■ * *
This unspeakable sentence was carried
out to the letter —or rather, it would have
been so carried out had Nature been as piti-
less as this criminal Governor. “The irons,”
said Thompson on examination by the
Colonial Secretary and others, five months
afterwards, “ consisted of a collar which
went round each of our necks, and chains
were fastened to the collar on each side of
the shoulder, and reached from thence to
the basil, which was placed three inches
from each ankle. There was a piece of iron
which projected from the collar before and
behind, about eight inches at each place.
The projecting irons would not allow me to
stretch myself at full length on my back. I
could sleep on my back by contracting my
legs. I could not lie at full length on either
side without contracting my legs. I could
not stand upright with the irons on. The
basil of the irons would not slip up my legs,
and the chains were too short to enable me
GOVERNOR DARLING’S
INVENTION,
to stand upright. 1 was never measured for
the irons, and Sudds’ collar was too small
for his neck, and the basils for his legs,
which were swollen.” The victims of the
old days were many. Their graves yawn
black and silent. This is a voice out from
the depths.
Thus cruelly manacled, these unhappy
wretches were exposed in the torrid heat of
the barrack-yard while this capricious out-
rage was perpetrated ; and then marched
back to the gaol to the sound of pipe and
tabor like figures in some modern Danse
Macabre. Sudds had bepn ill, and was
actually taken out of the hospital to partici-
pate in this grisly exhibition. Let Thomp-
son go on with his story. “On our return,”
he says, simply, “Sudds sat down with his
back to the wall, saying that he was very ill,
and wished to go to the hospital again ; but
he did not go to the hospital till next
morning. The basils of the irons cut his legs
during the time we were coming from the
barracks to the jail; it was owing to the
sharpness of the basil and the weight of it
that we were cut.” During the horrible
night that followed Sudds became worse ;
his fellow-sufferer begged a candle, and gave
him some tea that he had bought. “ I then
as tied Sudds if he had any friends to whom
he would wish to ■yrrite. He said he had a
wife and child in Gloucestershire, and begged
that, if he did not get better by the next
night. T would read some pious book to him,
adding hat ‘ they had put him in them irons
un,tU they had killed him.’ ” He lived long
enough to be sent to
the Gaol Hospital next
—„ morning, and “in
talking to him of his
disgrace,’’says the gaol
surgeon, “he declared
he would never work
in irons, and wished
himself out of the
world.” He was re-
moved to the General
Hospital two days
later, where he died
within twenty-four
hours. Thompson
merely became insane.
* * *
It is not difficult
for the most unsympa-
thetic reader to put
himself in imagination
in this poor soldier’s
place—to see his wife
and child in Glouces-
i jrshire—to feel all his
uorror at the awaken-
ing from that affecting
little dream of dome-
stic happiness which
was to have been so
unselfishly purchased
—with the public dis-
grace, the iron fetters,
and the spiked collar
which he owed to the
ingenuity of the Go-
vernor—and the pa-
thetic request for “a
pious book” that might
remind the wretch of the mercy that men
denied this misguided rustic who was thus
taken from the hospital to be disgraced, and
die. God knows how many unfortunates
had their lives crushed out in silence under
the galling tyranny of those early days, but
this is at least a solitary instance where the
victim finds feeble voice, though it be but
the bleat of the calf under the butcher’s
knife. There is no element wanting of
studied cruelty and ingenious deviltry
to make this instance of old colonial
ways stand prominently out against the
background of unrecorded horror There
are relics of feudal savagery preserved in
the Tower of London, known as the
“ Scavenger’s Daughter,” “ Little Ease,”
and other ingenious appellations, which


might rival these devices of torture of
Governor Darling’s invention. But enough
of this.
What did his Excellency the Governor 1
“ However much the event is to be re-
gretted,” wrote he mincingly to Earl
Bathurst, on the subject of Sudds’ death,
“ it cannot be imputed to severity ; none
was practised or intended. . . • With
respect to the chains, which are de-
signated as instruments of torture, it
will be sufficient to state that they
weigh only 131 b. 12oz. ; and, though
made with a view of producing an effect
those who were to witness the ceremony ”
his Excellency speaks here with the con-
scious but modest pride of an artist in his
work —“the extreme lightness of their con-
struction prevented their being injurious in
any respect to the individual.” No callosity
of heartless words could better paint the
character of the man, and the portrait is not
weakened by the fact that this statement of
the criminal Governor covers a hopeless lie.
The chains of Sudds weighed 141 b. 6oz. The
usual road-gang irons weighed from 61b. to
91b., and those brought out from England on
prison-ships weighed from to 41bs.
only Nothing is said in the reply about the
length of the chains, the effect of the spiked
collars, and the basils that cut the fleshy of
the suffering wretches who wore them. The
author of the outrage endeavoured to conceal
his crime under a lie, A few years ago
these spiked iron collars were kept in the
office of the Colonial Secretary in Sydney,
and possibly these disgraceful historical relics
may be preserved there still.
«
A whirl of indignation went up when the
facts of this outrage were made public. For
the first time the popular sentiment had a
chance to express itself. Wentworth and
War dell took up the matter in the Australian.
Wentworth himself published a scorching
pamphlet on the subject, entitled “ The Im-
peachment,” in which he gallantly declared
his intention to follow Governor Darling to
the foot of the gallows for his crime.
Another paper had in the meantime been
started in 1826, by Mr. Edward Smith
Hall—the Monitor. The official paper, the
Gazette, defended the outrage; but the
public at large and the two popular journals
pursued its author with execrations. Two
results followed. One of these was an
enquiry several years later by the English
authorities into the case of Sudds and
Thompson, and the other was the conflict
between the newspapers and Governor
Darling, which resulted eventually in the
recognition to a certain extent, however
limited, of the freedom of the Press.
The action taken by the public journals
struck the Governor home. The plain
truths, so unsparingly repeated, were not
palatable to his Excellency. A weapon was
therefore devised to crush the opposition,
quite worthy of the system and of the time,
and one which we have seen revived in our
day. The vigorous and outspoken com-
ments by Dr, Wardell on the late disgrace-
ful event, were the first to penetrate the
official armour, and that gentleman was
promptly prosecuted for criminal libel by
the Governor, for “an attempt to bring
the King’s representative into hatred
and contempt.” It might have been unsafe
to have founded a defence on the plea that
the accused had been anticipated by the
Governor himself in this matter. But,
though every effort was strained to secure
a conviction, the jury-reform already ob-
tained began to have its good effect. The jury
—no longer a merely official one —disagreed
on December 22, 1827, and Dr. Warded
was discharged on the understanding that
this infamous prosecution would be aban-
doned. This action was founded on what
were known as the “Gagging Acts” of
Governor Darling, of which we will have
more to say presently.
Although the proceedings against Wardell
fell through other charges were more suc-
cessful. Mr. Hayes, who had become the
editor of the Australian, was convicted, in
April, 1829, of libelling the Governor in
connection with the Sudds case, and was
fined £lOO and imprisoned for six months.
Hall, the editor of the Monitor, who had
also written in a public-spirited and out-
spoken manner on the same subject, was
sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment
in September of the same year. Quite an
avalanche of libel-writs descended on this
man’s drooping head. In December follow-
ing he was convicted again of an old libel on
the Governor, which was revived to form the
ground of this charge ; two days later he was
convicted of libels on James Laidley, Deputy
Commissary-General, and on P. A. Healy,
Convict Superintendent ; and on the day
following, of libel on Alexander Macleay,
Colonial Secretary. This rapid record shows
the rate at which public opinion was form-
ing, and the right and custom of public dis-
cussion and the expression of popular
opinion, developing. It demonstrated at the
same time the urgent necessity that existed
for the letting in of light on the official pro-
cedure of the colony.
It was not till five years after the Sudds
tragedy that its author left Sydney, but that
event was not forgotten. lie left amid the
execrations of the populace. On his arrival
in England, the enquiry into the case was
commenced after an even longer delay
than that into the Bligh affair. Nearly
two years after the crime was committed —
in 1835—a Committee of the House of Com-
mons met to review the circumstances under
which it occurred. Darling was befriended
by the party in power. The propertied
classes in the colony were his friends to a
man, as his rule had favoured their party
and repressed their opponents. Facts were
distorted, and black indictments toned down.
One victim was dead, indeed, and the other
had been temporarily insane. But the Pure
Merinos had got over greater difficulties
than these. A dead man or a madman
more or less made little difference in Botany
Bay in those days. The result of the enquiry
was a foregone conclusion from the first.
The accused was acquitted. As a special
mark of royal favour and of the influence of
his friends in the Ministry, he was knighted
immediately after for his chivalry by the
King. Had Governor Darling been well and
truly tried before a fearless jury of his coun-
trymen for his atrocious crime, he would
assuredly have been hanged by the neck.
CHAPTER XXYI.
Garotting the Press.
There is a fine crusted story told of a
certain bold free tyrant in old days whose
innocent delights at the expense of a virtuous
peasantry were sadly interfered with by a
tendency on the part of a meddlesome clutch
of prophets who dwelt in caves in the
neighbourhood, to break out into the most
rabid spasms of soothsaying, and other un-
gentle recreations. The periodical outbursts
of these cataleptic persons set the whole
district by the ears for a time, and the
deluded people hatched under their influence
a fleeting kind of public opinion, which is
said to have taken the form of pikestaves
and hayforks when the emissaries of the
bold free tyrant swooped down. But he
was a thoughtful person, this oppressor ; and
when not imagining new wickednesses he
could always put his quivering digits on the
springs of these popular disturbances. He
was humane, too, in his capricious way,
when not in the vein for promiscuous
slaughter. “Let us hang a few prophets ! ”
he would say in his light way, and the result
was always the return of the peasantry to a
more dutiful frame of mind. He thus cut
off public opinion at its source. His method
has always been very much in favour with
rulers who find themselves out of sympathy
with the bent of the popular mind, and when
public opinion is going against them. Only
instead of hanging a few prophets the policy
is nowadays to gag the public Press.
This, as we have seen, is what Governor
Darling proceeded to try to do. So long as
the official paper, the Gazette, merely
chronicled such of the official acts as would
bear the light, without daring to comment
in even the mildest form on the iniquities
and irregularities that went on every day,
and which it is everywhere the duty of
the public journal to decry and expose, the
Press, such as it was, went on its way un-
molested. But • when public opinion,
directed by capable heads and hands, began
to declare itself in a non-official publication,
vested interests were aroused, and a serious
danger to good government was at once dis-
covered. This was striking at the roots of
Law and Order, and undermining the founda-
tions of society. It was necessary to hang
a few prophets, or at least to gag the Press.
This was the congenial task to which
Governor Darling addressed himself. When
the prosecutions against Dr. Wardell failed,
and the official fangs were drawn by a pro-
perly-constituted jury, the proceedings had
been undertaken under some Acts specially
prepared by this respectable man and his
advisers.
An infallible sign of an unhealthy state
of public business and of the presence of t
suspicious element in things generally, is
an official attempt to stifle public enquiry.
As the people look to the Press for their
information as well as for the publication of
their judgment on facts laid before them, the
best and shortest method to render that


judgment nugatory is to deprive it of the
knowledge of facts to go upon first, and of
public expression afterwards. Public opinion
is nothing without public expression, and
opinion cannot exist if the publication of
facts is rendered hazardous or unreliable.
This is what is meant by the liberty of the
Press —not a claim to any privilege that the
public does not possess, and no special
powers or prescriptive rights in any direc-
tion, but simply the liberty to make known
what is going on, and to express a candid
judgment such as every individual is at
liberty to form thereon. Wentworth, War-
dell, and Hall claimed no more than this.
But this was exactly the liberty of which
Governor Darling was most anxious to
deprive them. At this point the old convict
officialdom and the awakening power of
public opinion first came into conflict.
The Governor had already written home to
Earl Bathurst, who was then Secretary of
State for the Colonies, complaining bitterly
of the attacks made on him in the public
Press. In that communication the case was
put strictly from the official point of view,
and from the names of the first Legislative
Council already before the reader, there will
be no difficulty in believing that the
Governor’s advisers most cordially concurred
with him in his statement of the case. The
result was that a despatch was received from
Earl Bathurst in November, 1826, in which
a suggestion was made to pass some colonial
enactments to deal with this vexed question.
On April 25 following a Bill was prepared
and passed by the Council, ‘ ‘ for preventing
the mischiefs arising from the printing and
publishing newspapers, and papers of a like
nature, by persons not known, and for regu-
lating the printing and publication of such
papers in other respects, and also for re-
straining the abuses arising from the publi-
cation of blasphemous and seditious libels.”
Transportation was the penalty for a second
offence under this Act. On May 3 another
Act was proposed, imposing a duty ‘ 1 upon
all newspapers and papers of a like nature
printed to be dispersed to the public.”
It will be remembered that, under the
Constitution introduced by Chief Justice
Forbes, that official had the privilege of a
vote in the Council, and after a measure
was carried there, it became his further duty
to certify or not to its provisions as he
thought fit, before it became law. Judge
Forbes was not at the meeting of the Coun-
cil at which this last measure was adopted,
and on its presentation to him for signature
he refused his certificate on the ground of
its manifest illegality. The Governor again
and again endeavoured to persuade or in-
timidate the Chief Justice to give way, but
always without success. A bitter conflict
ensued, in which the Chief Justice nobly
espoused the cause of justice and the popular
right, and honoured himself by his public-
spirited and disinterested action. What the
Governor failed to do by threats or per-
suasion he now attempted by slandering the
Judge to the Colonial Office, but Forbes met
and repelled all his charges. “I have been
appointed,” he said in one of his letters to
the Colonial Office, “to discharge a sacred
duty. I refused to certify the Governor’s
Bills, because I thought them repugnant to
law, because I felt 1 should compromise my
oath and my honour if I sanctioned them.
What legal right has the Governor to press
me further, or to endeavour to alarm me
into compliance ? Does the correspondence
which passed between us in April and May
last present the calm, the temperate, the
courteous application of one high officer to
another . , or is it the mandate of a
superior to an inferior, intimating his duty
and warning him of the peril of disobedi-
ence ? When the three judges of Bombay
were brought to the consideration of the
same question they discussed its merits in
open Court and decided against it, in the
heart of the Mahommedan country. I was
called upon alone, under the bondage of
secresy—l will not pursue the conti’ast!”
* * * *
The Chief Justice found himself in con-
NEWS VERSUS NOOSE.
flict, not only with the Governor, but with
the rest of the Legislative Council as well.
When this body was established, partly in
deference to the exertions of Sir James
Macintosh and ex-Governor Brisbane, the
intention on the part of the Home Authori-
ties was to give the population of the colony
some share in the Government, which had
hitherto rested in the irresponsible hands of
the Governors alone. The members of Coun-
cil were nominated by the Crown, and a Go-
vernor like Macquarie, or Brisbane during
the last year of his rule, might have exer-
cised this right of nomination judiciously,
and with good results to the colony at large.
No such results were to be expected from
Darling, however, and the first Legislative
Council was, therefore, merely a body com-
posed of Crown officials and representatives
of that Vested Interest class which first
blossomed into being under the shelter of
the New South Wales Corps. When we
read of the attempt to stifle discussion at this
stage, and to gag the infant Press, we naturally
look for the name of the man in this connec-
tion who has hitherto been always prominent
whenever the Vested Interests he helped
to build up had an opportunity to exercise
their influence. And those who look for the
name of the übiquitous John Macarthur in
this connection will not be disappointed.
He is such a necessary part of every-
thing that is sinister in the history of
Botany Bay that the episode now under
notice would scarcely be recognisable
without him. He was Governor Darling’s
most active lieutenant in the Council, and
the proposals to stifle the newspapers in
their birth had his most enthusiastic concur-
rence. He out-heroded Herod in this
matter, and even went further than the Go-
vernor himself ; for
he actually proposed a
crushing tax of one
shilling each on every
copy of every news-
paper published in the
hk. colony. This was too
Hn much even for Dar-
ling’s distorted sense
of justice. It was a
flight of imagination
that required a trained
Botany Bay intellect
to soar up to. So the
tax was reduced to
threepence. Mac-
arthur died during the
term of the next Go-
vernor, so that we will
meet with him no
more.
Through all this busi-
ness, it is valuable to
f j| L Mjn note the fact that every
°« L- proposal to cripple the
advance of the colony
either emanated from,
or received the most
cordial support of, the
Vested Interest class,
as represented in the
Legislative Council.
Just as it opposed
the introduction of
the jury system, so it supported the
attack on the freedom of the Press,
and so it will be found consistently
opposing and distorting every manifesta-
tion of progressive public opinion to the
end of the chapter. Of such are the Botany
Bay “patriots.” It is satisfactory to have
to add that after the correspondence on the
newspaper tax had been digested by the
Colonial Office at home, a despatch was at
length received informing the Governor that
“the law officers of the Crown have reported
their opinion that in refusing to grant his
certificate to the Act for licensing news-
papers, Mr. Forbes correctly executed his
duty, and that the reasons assigned by him
for that decision were valid and sufficient.”
This despatch was a well-merited rebuff for
the Governor and his myrmidons, and the
Gagging Acts fell into abeyance. But the ha-
rassing nature of this conflict between his


sense of duty on the one hand and the
Vested Interest class and the Governor on
the other, proved a severe strain on the
health of Chief-Justice Forbes. He paid a
visit home, and, strangely enough, consider-
ing the way such honours were usually ap-
portioned, he was knighted in recognition of
his high character and services. He returned
to the colony and died soon after. Sir
Francis Forbes was succeeded by Chief-
Justice Dowling.
In this Avay was the process of garotting
the Press begun in New South Wales. The
official mind had so accustomed itself to hand-
ing convicts over to the hangman or the
dogger for disciplinary treatment, that it
naturally prescribed the same remedy for
any evidence of outspoken criticism, or of
public opinion through the Press. However,
the grasp of the law was only partially suc-
cessful in its attempt to strangle the freedom
of public opinion in its infantile stages. We
have now outgrown the time when the same
measures could be applied by authority.
Yet the spirit of the old convict-system is as
active as of old, and without changing its
views on the subject of the liberty of the
Press, it has merely changed its mode of
procedure and legal forms.
Before he left Governor Darling succeeded
in making himself offensive to almost every
class in the community. This man was cer-
tainly the most unpopular Governor who
ever held rule in New South Wales. At a
dinner given by the Turf Club in December,
1827, some speeches were made reflecting in
the most severe and direct manner on his
administration and on himself. When the
• Governor’s health was proposed, according to
custom, the band played the significant air
of “Over the hills and far away.” The in-
sult was marked, and even Governor Darling
could not fail to take it. He withdrew his
patronage from the club, and himself from
the colony in October, 1831. Tho populace,
which received him on his arrival in silence,
hailed his departure with cheers. Some of
the more demonstrative among the lower
classes of the population sailed round the
vessel in which Darling and his family had
taken their passage, and these victims of his
misrule insulted him with their taunts there
as the vessel lay at anchor. Bonfires blazed
along the shores of the harbour as the ship
sailed away. The more reputable in-
habitants were not so actively demonstra-
tive, but the general feeling at Ralph
Darling’s departure was one of a profound
sense of gratification and relief.
* * *
With the departure of this Governor the
second period of the history of Botany Bay
may be said to close. In the first we saw
the foundation of the colony, and its be-
ginnings taking shape. From the moment
that any form was discernible in tho
inchoate material out of which the set-
tlement was first fashioned, the squalid
tyranny and oppression of the New
South Wales Corps on the one hand and
the hopeless misery of the convict classes on
the other were distinctly apparent. The
first 20 years was one chapter of conflict be-
tween the Corps and the Governors, ending
in tho temporary triumph of the Corps by
the deposition of Bligh. How the victory
was used it is not necessary to repeat. The
chief point to be observed is the foundation of
a Vested Interest class. The manner in which
that interest formed and developed requires
no further explanation. With the arrival
of Macquarie came the second historical
period. The Corps was drummed out, but
the Vested Interests remained. All through
this second period we find them at every
turn opposing first the Governor’s pro-
gressive policy and then every successive
movement made in the direction of popular
development and advance. Trial by jury, the
freedom of tho Press, the right of public
opinion, enquiry into the iniquities of the
convict system, and every other essay at
progress was consistently opposed by the
Vested Interest class. At the same time
there began to appear tho first indications of
public intelligence—two popular newspapers,
the Patriotic Association, and capable and
recognised leaders of the people. In this
manner the way was prepared for the stage
that was to follow.
In the third stage of the colony’s history
we will see tho popular cause taken up by
the best Governor who ever held office
in New South Wales. As Macquarie suc-
ceeded the misrule of tho Corps, so Bourke
succeeded Darling. He taught the people to
rely on their own power, by allowing them
to feel their influence under favouring con-
ditions. He prepared the way in the most
direct manner for the abolition of transpor-
tation, and he effected sweeping reforms in
the convict system, pruning it of some of its
brutalities, and stripping it of some of its
most repulsive accessories of horror. From
his timQ onward the process of advance to the
granting of partial and then complete Respon-
sible Government is marked and regular, until
the first elected Parliament was called to-
gether in 1856. This will conclude the
third part of our story, and will lead up to
the fourth period, which has lasted to the
present time. Every day the indications
become stronger that there is a fifth stage
still in reserve, to which this present is but
the antechamber. Perhaps, some day we
shall look back to the present stage of our
history with the same historical interest as
that with which we now regard the first, the
second, or the third.
CHAPTER XXVII.
Governor Bourke.
One of the most difficult of the twelve
labours of Hercules was the slaying of the
hydra. Whenever the son of Alcmena
crushed one of the seven heads of the reptile
of the Lerneean lake, several others grew in
its place. Then he bethought himself of
smearing with pitch the place of the heads
as he destroyed them, and soon the loathly
worm ” was discomfited. The task that lay
before Sir Richard Bourke on his arrival
was an equally difficult one. If he did not
perform it so thoroughly it was only because
his powers were not and because
the labour was too great for any one man.
Lieutenant-General Bourke was born in the
year the colony was founded, and had served
in the Peninsula, as well as in Holland and
South America. He was Lieutenant-Go-
vernor at the Cape for six years before he
came to Botany Bay, Before entering
the army he was educated for the Bar, and
it is, perhaps, due to this fact that his rule
in New South Wales was not marked by any
of the narrow obstinacy and usual crass-
ness of the professional soldier. He seems
to have forgotten for the time his drum-head-
and-triangle traditions, if ho had ever been
influenced by them, and to have set his face
against their perpetuation in the colony. He
dealt liberally with the people, and readily re-
cognised the simple justice of their demands.
He sympathised, too, with their aspirations
after free institutions, and entered into the
spirit which led them to look into the future
for the destiny of the settlement growing up
round them. Of course such a Governor as
this was a pre-ordained victim to the Vested
Interest class from the start. But though
this class triumphed in the end, it was not
until he had set a force in motion that might
be temporarily stayed, but never finally
stopped until its work was done.
* * *
Ono of the most important acts of Governor
Bourke’s term of i*ule was the granting of
the complete right of trial by jury. This
was directly due to the Governor himself.
Wo have seen how Judge Forbes directed
the empannelling of the first civil jury in
1824, and how through the machinations of
the obstructive class the reform was defeated
by the fact that the sheriff placed no names
of members of the Emancipist class on his
list. The appeal was dismissed on a techni-
cal point, and nothing more was officially
heard of the matter until Bourke opened it
up again. During the last years of Darling’s
term the Patriotic Association called the
people together on several occasions in
public meeting to address the Throne on the
subjects of self-government and trial by
jury. The two matters were taken to-
gether. Thus on the anniversary of
the foundation of the colony, in 1827,
a meeting was held at the Court House
at which Wentworth spoke in support of a
petition proposed for adoption. “ The first
topic contained in the petition,” he said,
“is a I’equest for trial by jury. A great
part of the population is held not eligible to
sit as jurors. We urge that if it were more
extended in the colony its beneficial effects
would be most generally known.” Sir
James Macintosh presented this petition to
the House of Commons, as already stated.
In 1829 an Act of Council established juries
in civil cases, and next year another meet-
ing was held to prepare a popular petition.
In 1831, when news arrived of the accession
of William IV., the usual loyal and charac-
teristically vapid address of the colonists
contained at least one paragraph that meant
something. It was a request that the new
King would extend to the only colony of
Great Britain bereft of the rights of Britons,
a full participation of the benefits and pri-
vileges of the British Constitution. This
was inserted in the petition by an amend-
ment on the original address.
* * *
In this manner the way was prepared for


some decisive step. The condition of the
lower classes and the masses excited the
sympathy of Governor Bourke from the
first. When most of his predecessors
had been either actively tyrannical or
passively acquiescent, Bourke at once
made earnest and open efforts to turn
the tide. One by one he scotched the
hydra’s heads, and he succeeded in all but
completely strangling the convict system.
In 1833, the Governor himself proposed a
Bill in the Legislative Council, declaring
Emancipists qualified to serve on criminal
juries, provided they possessed £3O of yearly
income, or personal property to the amount
of £3OO. He referred this measure to the
three judges who then held seats on the
Bench—Forbes, Dowling, and Burton—for
an opinion as to its legality. They replied
to the effect that the step proposed was in
accordance with English law, under which
offenders were allowed to sit as jurors in
criminal cases on the completion of the
term of their sentences. The Bill was then
submitted to the Council, and in the absence
of two of its members —Archdeacon Brough-
ton and Mr. Robert Campbell, senior—that
body divided equally on the question as to
whether Emancipists were to be allowed to
sit as jurors or not. The Governor had a
vote in the Council as a sitting member, and
another casting vote in the event of an
equal division. Tbe casting vote of Governor
Bourke, in this instance, turned the scale
and introduced the jury system— that is
what his action then meant. This further
advance in the direction of popular reform
was in a measure forced on the colony by the
Governor, in the teeth of the bitterest oppo-
sition of the Vested Interest class.
* * *
Up to this time juries in criminal cases
were exclusively composed of seven naval or
military officers, eked out perhaps by civil
officials. Before the Forbes Charter a
majority of five voices in seven was sufficient
for a conviction, even in capital cases. The
prosecutor in those more early days pleaded
his own case, the Judge-Advocate framing
the indictment and practically conducting
the prosecution; while the accused was
always undefended 1 The starting-point in
Botany Bay criminal jurisprudence was that
everyone was held to be guilty until his
innocence was made clear a few days after
he had been hanged. Our enemies say that
this is one of the features of the old system
that still survive in a very slightly modified
form.
♦ *
The difference between the results of
criminal cases before and after the Bourke
Jury Law is sufficiently evidenced by a few
figures. To take capital cases alone: 95
persons were hanged out of the small
population on the shores of Sydney Cove in
the first six years after Phillip’s landing, but
so wild and reckless was the process of the
disposal of human life that no complete
return of those who died on the gallows is
available up to 1825. This is an eloquent
blank. 'We gather from the records and
Gazette files of the time that this laxity
was due to the number of executions, and
the indiscriminate and irresponsible manner
in which they were ordered. It was easier
to hang a man than to keep a record of the
fact. At the Criminal Sessions in October,
1822, 34 persons were herded in the dock
and sentenced to death—a noble subject for
an Australian historial picture. During
Darling’s rule we know that 184 persons
were hanged, and of the busiest year, 1828,
no record has been kept. During the first
four years of Bourke’s term, and before the
jury law was passed or had time to get into
fair working order, 197 persons perished by
the hangman’s hands. But by this time the
people had become accustomed to the exer-
cise of the jury right, and the number of
executions fell rapidly away, until in the year
Bourke left the colony only 12 persons were
hanged. During the nine years of which
we have record between 1826 to 1839 the
public executions averaged nearly one a
week. For the nine subsequent years the
average was about one in four months. Yet
the moral tone of the community was higher,
WHAT GOVERNOR BOURKE
and law and order were daily taking firmer
shape. So much for capital punishment as
a deterrent.
* * *
The jury-law reform was bitterly opposed.
The class that monopolised the privilege of
serving on juries protested strongly against
the innovation, and unscrupulously attacked
it in its working after it was introduced. The
treatment the lower classes of the popu-
lation had received was not of the kind to
make them the best citizens or the best
jurors, and it was some time before the
actual command of the new privilege
familiarised the people with its use. Those
who had the compiling of the lists were care-
ful, with the view of bringing the new law
into greater contempt, to put thereon the
names of Emancipists of notoriously bad
character, or who had been convicted of the
most heinous offences. Thus one man was
called who was released on bail, being
charged with cattle-stealing ; another, who
was under sentence of transportation for life
to Moreton Bay ; and a third, who had been
hanged a short time before. The gross clumsi-
ness of these melancholy artifices, however,
defeated their own object, and proved nothing
beyond the fact that if the Emancipists
were sometimes unfit to serve as jurors,
they were not more so than the unscrupulous
wretches who resorted to such means to dis-
credit the progress of reform.
* * *
The first Act was introduced as an experi-
ment for a period, and in 1836 a letter
was addressed by the Governor to the three
Judges, asking their opinion on the working
of the law. Chief Justice Forbes and Judge
Dowling both replied in its favour, and it is
not likely that these two experienced men,
with their exceptional opportunities for
studying the working
of the system, would
have given such an
answer had they not
At \ been satisfied of its
truth. It is true that
Judge Burton gave an
adverse opinion. But
this judge was a con-
servative of the purest
water, and one of his
last acts in the country
was to resign his seat
as President of the
Legislative Council as
a protest against the
growing power of the
people. The law was
therefore confirmed,
and as the enquiry
elicited quite sufficient
evidence of the venal
character of those who
compiled the jury-
lists, and the trickery
they presorted to to
prove their case, a
circular letter was
addressed by the Go-
vernor and the Chief
Justice to all the magis-
trates of the colony,
cautioning them to be
careful in the future
to see that the dis-
charge of this duty in the respective districts
was not made a means to defeat the law, and
bring it into contempt, by the choice of im-
proper persons.
* * *
Dr. Lang, who acquired a repute for
popular sympathies that he only half earned,
was a rabid opponent of the jury-bill, as he
was of Wardell and Wentworth, and the
Patriotic Association, from the beginning of
their work. He “entirely concurred with
Mr. Justice Burton in his opinion on the
measure,” he says in his “History ;” he re-
garded it as one of the blots on the adminis-
tration of Bourke, and said that the Emanci-
pists claimed it because they were “taughtand
incited to do so by certain news-writers of
their own class and origin. f as well as by
certain lawyers of inferior respectability,
who depended chiefly on emancipist and
convict practice, and who willingly pursued


the arts of petty agitation to acquire an im-
portance in society, which they had no other
means of attaining.” The venom in this
extract is apparent on the surface ; the news-
writers and lawyers of inferior respectability
being, of course, Wentworth and Warded.
In this respect the interest of the worthy
Doctor appears to have led him astray.
Looking back at the matter from the stand-
point of the present we recognise that, what-
ever the objections to the granting of the
jury-right may have been, and whatever the
character of the persons who first advocated
or exercised it, the fact remains that it was
the first great instalment of popular right
the people of the colony received, and that
the persons who obtained it were the real
leaders of subsequent democratic develop-
ment. The names of Sir Richard Bourke,
Sir Francis Forbes, Dr. Warded, and William
Wentworth are most closely connected with
this first step towards the free institution erf
to-day. This was the crushing of the first of
the heads of the hydra.
Another iniquity which Bourke lost no
time in minimising was the Assignment
System. Those who favoured Darling’s
rule wrote of that Governor that “ under
him the anti-convict system was introduced,
and a commencement of real penal discipline
made, amidst great outcry He
introduced and strengthened the laws for the
management of the felon population, and
. . . . discipline was maintained with a
firm hand.” Lang says that his subordinate
agents treated the convicts with great seve-
rity under his direction, “and with a reck-
less indifference to their feelings as men
which their situation as criminals never
would have warranted.” The gaolers and
overseers took their tone from their chief,
of course. Darling established an Assign-
ment Board which effectually controlled the
appointment of white labour. So well was
the work done that any person ill-affected
towards the person or the acts of the
Governor stood little or no chance of having
his request for assigned servants attended
to. All this Bourke resolved to correct, as
soon as he realised the state of things into
the midst of which he had been precipi-
tated. He determined to introduce a more
humane spirit into the convict system itself,
and to new-model the Assignment system.
He therefore framed a code of regulations
for the latter purpose, under which the
number of assigned convict servants was to be
proportioned to the land held and under
cultivation by the applicant. But even this
reform called forth a howl of execration frem
the slave-masters. It throws a strong light
on the condition of the time when we find
that some of these people complained of the
new assignment regulations because they
permitted no more than 70 convicts to any
one person. It was no uncommon thing to
see these wretches placed in batches of 50
and 60 at the practically irresponsible mercy
of avaricious ruffians who knew of no other
method of suasion than that of the flogger
or the iron-gang.
* * *
But one of the very first acts of the Go-
vernor, as soon as he saw the kind of people
he had to deal with, was one that raised
him a plentiful crop of enemies. Stories of
the cruelties of masters towards their ser-
vants, encouraged under Dardng’s san-
guinary rule, reached his ears nearly every
day. One most atrocious instance occurred
in 1834. Six men were charged with taking
part in a mutiny of assigned servants on the
estate of Major Mudie—the person who
afterwards wrote the scurrdous lampoon
caded the “Felonry of New South Wales.”
This man had a particularly bad reputation
for his treatment of assigned servants, and
in the present instance the six men did not
deny their part in the mutiny, but
“ persisted in the statement that they
had been goaded on to their crime by
the tyranny and id-treatment which they
had been subject to on the station.”
Five of the men were hanged—to en-
courage the others, probably. Their state-
ments made such an impression, however,
that a Commission was appointed to enquire
into the treatment of the white labour on
Major Mudie’s property—“ Castle Forbes”
was what this aspiring creature caded his
estate—and enough was elicited to lead the
Governor to strike his name off the Com-
mission of the Peace. These and other
similar instances determined the Governor
to do something for the wretches who could
only cad attention to their miseries at the
risk of the gallows. He found on enquiry
that magistrates sentenced each other’s as-
signed servants to indescribable tortures with
the lash on the smallest provocation, and with-
out other rule or system than their own cruel
caprice. He therefore proposed to the
Council a measure which became known as
the Magistrates’ Act, limiting the sentences
which magistrates had power to inflict to 50
lashes for each offence. Some idea of the
nature of the sentences complained of may
be gathered from the liberal nature of this
limit. Fifty lashes to-day would be regarded
as barbarism and savage torture ; then, such
limit to the powers of petty magistrates was
looked upon as a piece of capricious interfer-
ence on the part of the Governor, and
mawkish and ill-judged lenity. The mea-
sure was passed, after bitter opposition, and
the hydra of conviotism received another
crushing blow.
The year after the right of trial by jury
was won witnessed the untimely death of
Dr. Wardell. That public-spirited man,
whose talents were as great as his popular
sympathies were progressive and wide, and
to whose memory Australia must always owe
an inextinguishable public debt, was mur-
dered near his own home on the Parramatta-
road on September 7, 1834. Some bush-
rangers waylaid him, and he called upon
them to surrender. They failed to recognise
him, and one of them shot him dead. The
assassins, when they knew their victim, had
the grace to cover the body with branches to
protect it from the native dogs. A boy who
was one of the number gave information, and
the two others were arrested and executed.
In Dr. Wardell’s death the colony lost an in-
valuable public servant, in the highest sense
of the word. The man whose name was so
closely connected with his up to this stage
lost a guide and friend, and a contrast
between his previous and his subsequent
career bears evidence of the value of the in-
fluence at so untimely an hour withdrawn. s
CHAPTER XXYIIL
How the Convict System Worked.
If we can conceive of a writer in cold
blood addressing himself to the compilation
of a collection of tales of horror drawn from
ad sources, it is not difficult to set down a
dst of the places from which he might draw
the materials for his gruesome and grisly
task. There are the tales of the slave-trade
in the Spanish settlements and in the
Southern States of America and on the
Guinea coast; the early excesses of the
French Revolution ; the felonry of Siberia ;
and the oubdettes and iron cages of the
feudal ages. Any of these will give the
most avaricious sensationalist whatever he
may reasonably require, but for Australians
there wid never be any necessity to go out-
side their own borders, or beyond the limits
of their own brief history. It would indeed
be strange if a Governor had not at length
arrived to find the state of things he was
caded to rule too much for his commonest
instincts of humanity.
* * *
To get a clear view of the merit of
Bourke’s action, it is necessary to look at
things for a moment as he saw them.
The tales of convict life at this time
had lost nothing in cruelty while
events were progressing so far. The
period of Darling’s and Bourke’s rule is
fruitful in an abundant crop of harrowing
stories. There is one told by an eye-wit-
ness which is so graphic and realistic that
wo cannot do better than repeat it almost in
his own words. He was sent for one day to
Bathurst Courthouse, he says, to identify a
man who was supposed to have been driven
by cruel treatment into the bush from the
farm of which the person quoted was one of
the overseers. On his way into court he
had to pass the triangles, where the floggers
had been busy wielding the lash incessantly
for hours. “ I saw a man,” he says, “ walk
across the yard with the blood that had run
from his lacerated flesh squashing out of his
shoes at every stop he took. A dog was
licking the blood off the triangles, and the
ants were carrying away great pieces of
human flesh that the lash had scattered
about the ground. The scourger’s foot had
worn a deep hole in the ground by the
violence with which he whirled himself
round on it to strike the quivering and
wealed back, out of which stuck the sinews,
white, ragged, and swollen. The infliction
was 100 lashes, at about half-minute time, so
as to extend the punishment through nearly
an hour. The day was hot enough to over
come a man merely standing that length of
time in the sun, and this was going on in
the full blaze of it. However, they had a
pair of scourgers who gave each other spell
and spell about, and they were bespattered
with blood like a couple of butchers.”
* * *
The photographic eye of this witness has
struck off a picture that may stand at the
head of our imaginary writer’s grisly collec-
tion. The idle triangles, and the dog that,
like those in the story of Jezebel, licks up
the new-spilled blood ; the “ man ” who
has been tortured, with the blood “ squash-
ing ” out of his boots as he walks away ; the


sinews standing out from his back, white
and ragged and swollen ; and the tell-tale
mark of the scourger’s foot —here we have
all the elements of a picture that should be
painted and hung on the walls of every Aus-
tralian gallery of art as a popular educator
and an historical and political lesson. There
is a passage in one of Thackeray s books
which speaks of the reading of certain old
familiar tales, the delight of “sweet girls and
their gentle mothers” who have followed the
adventures of the hero and wept and
smiled with the heroine from one genera-
tion to another. * But who will dare to tell
the story of social life in Australia in a can-
did way for girls and gentlewomen to read,
when it is made up of chapters such as this ?
Yet all this time, while every court-yard
witnessed such horrors, sweet girls and
their gentle mothers were the daughters and
wives of the men who sanctioned and ordered
these atrocities that had place every day
under women’s and children’s unpitying eyes.
* *
“ The fact is," says the same speaker,
“that such a sight is so common in this
country that no one thinks anything of it, I
have seen young children practising flogging on
a tree, as children in England play at horses.”
That Avas the way the system worked. People
grew accustomed to what they daily saw
around them, as we are accustomed to the
idea of a man being strangled by process of
law. Children grew up to look upon what
they saw as the natural and proper state of
things. The children of 50 and 40 years ago
are the decaying generation of to-day. It is
only natural and logical, therefore, and in no
wise strange and wonderful, that so many of
the old convict-period traditions and spirit
survive amongst us still.
* * *
These remarks quoted were published in
a certain magazine called “Meliora,” in
1861. From the article we take also the
following little instance. It was a common
thing—and nothing shows more clearly the
relentless barbarity of the men who admin-
istered the law and exacted the last pound of
flesh the brutal regulations permitted—to
call the same act by as many as five
different names in the charge, and for five
separate and distinct sentences to be passed on
the accused for that one act. One instance
given is that of a convict servant of a certain
magistrate. This man had been given a
glass or two of spirits by a travelling
hawker. His master’s son, an ill-conditioned
Australian lad of the period and formed under
the system, began to curse and threaten the
servant. The man retorted. A constable
was at once sent for, and the convict, real-
ising his position and driven mad with
terror, knocked him down and escaped into
the bush. On his way he rushed into his own
hut and took with him, as his only provision,
three-fourths of a damper he had by him ready
baked. He was captured presently, as a
matter of course. The young slave-master
prosecuted him for drunkenness, insolence,
theft (for the piece of damper was regarded
as the master’s property until it Avas con-
sumed), and bushranging. Then the magis-
trates made the constable prove the assault.
From the spirited proceedings of the young
man in this matter, and his ingenuity in
proving the charge of theft, we may argue
that he was a particularly apt pupil of his
parents and guardians and a promising pro-
perty-holder in the future.
* * *
This convict’s story is worth following a
stage or two further. He was sentenced to
25 lashes for drunkenness, 25 for insolence,
50 for bushranging, six months in an iron-
gang for stealing the piece of damper, and
three months for assaulting a police-officer
in the execution of his duty. He got the
lashes and joined the chain-gang, accord-
ingly. While there he committed some
trilling offence, real or imaginary, for which
he was sentenced to receive more lashes.
But he had a regardful memory of his pre-
vious experience in this direction, so
he declined this further attention, and
again succeeded in decamping into the
bush. Here he found some bushrangers this
time, for his previous experience had rather
disgusted him of any closer acquaintance
with the law. The bushrangers carried arms,
and he assisted in several robberies with
them. He was taken with arms in his
hands after a time, and adroitly hanged up
by the neck. He expired in that pic-
turesque attitude. “ The man was a quiet,
hard-working, honest fellow,” we are told,
“ but he would not stand flogging and he
was fond of liquor. The crime he was
sent here for he had committed when
drunk, and it was perhaps the only
one he had to answer for. That
man was murdered ; and so hundreds
upon hundreds have been, and are being,
every year in this cursed country.” The
speaker was a labour-overseer, remember,
and was speaking of what he saw and knew.
* * *
“ Great tyranny was exercised even at the
seat of government; but in the thickly-
populated districts public opinion in some
degree shielded the convict from the ex-
tremity of oppression,” It is no matter of
wonder, then, that the Vested Interest party
howled doAvn any attempt to express public
opinion by free speech or by a free Press.
The cruelty in Sydney, though bad enough,
sank to a trifle Avhen compared Avith the
cruelty perpetrated up the country. But
the system was the same, whatever its modi-
fications might be. As instances of this
there are cases like the folloAving : “ Here is
an offence called by three different names,
three several charges are made upon it,
three several trials, three several sentences,
and three several punishments following. A
man gets drunk, has his clothes stolen, and
is afraid to go home to his master. He is
tried first for drunkenness, a second time for
making away Avith his clothing, and a third
time for absconding. His sentence is in sum
total 100 lashes, which, with the cat-o’-nine-
tails, is really 900 lashes. ” There is a man
mentioned here who received 2600 lashes in
five years, and another who received 1200
lushes in 12 months. ' The planet had little
in the way of real enjoyment to offer these
wretches after this.
These instances will indicate what Bourke
found on his arrival. The Act for restrain-
ing magistrates from ordering more than 50
lashes to convict servants Avas imperatively
called for in the circumstances. Yet that
Vested Interest class which was largely
formed now of landed proprietors, was, as
usual, loud in its opposition. > These people
clamoured loudly against their deprivation of
unlimited power, alleging that it was neces-
sary to keep the convict element in check,
and to get fair work out of their white
labour. They threatened the colony with
impending anarchy and destruction, and a
general rising on the part of the convict
population. Then they set to work to pre-
pare petitions which were signed by many
magistrates and landed proprietors, and sent
to England, urging on the Home Authorities
the necessity that existed for their being
granted increased power to flog and torture
the unfortunates who had been placed at
their mercy by some cruelly whimsical
caprice of fate. Their action in this matter
is significant of their whole attitude when
there was any question of progress or re-
form. Lang, whose honesty is often stronger
than his prejudices, states the position neatly
enough:—“lt was not civil and religious
liberty—that pearl of inestimable price in
the eyes of our forefathers in the early days
of emigration to America—for which these
Australian worthies petitioned ; it was for a
somewhat different species of liberty, the
liberty to lash; and long and deep were the
groans they uttered through their favourite
organ when they found it denied them."
* * *
For the same reason Bourke reformed the
assignment system, and curtailed materially
the amount of white labour any one pro-
prietor was allowed to own. The very fact
that under the new regulations 70 was the
maximum throws light on the state of things
existing in connection Avith convict assign-
ment. This measure, with the jury law re-
form and the Magistrates’ Act just referred
to, made Bourke extremely unpopular Avith
the Vested Interest class. The persons who
formed that class maintained that their
labour and their services had opened up the
country, and developed its pastoral and agri-
cultural resources. Their capital, they said,
had made the colony what it was. They
claimed that they Avere the only persons
entitled to consideration in any measure of
Government that might be proposed, for on
them the prosperity of the country rested,
and if they were driven out the colony might
relapse into primitive barbarism. Their
expenditure of capital and their labour
in the past, they said, gave them
a Vested Interest in the state of
things under which they had done their
work and laid out their capital. They
therefore objected strongly on the strictest
grounds of equity and justice to any new-
fangled notions the Governor might intro-
duce, or to any interference with their
undoubted rights and privileges. This was
the case for the Vested Interest party.
* * *
But the popular instinct, led by the
Patriotic Association, regarded the question
from another point of view. In the first
place, no rational man could look on un-
moved from day to day at the saturnalia of
cruelty going on around him unless his dis-
gust was allayed by a Vested Interest in the
state of things that produced these miseries.
To the popular mind these *Vested Interests
were the bonds and props that kept the
fabric of the convict-system together. Just


as the walls of the great cotton warehouses
of Liverpool were once said to be cemented
by negro blood, so might the colonial fabric
be said to be built up by the bodies of con-
vict men and women, and cemented with
their blood. Looking back at the way in
which the foundations of these Vested In-
terests were laid—as the process has already
been described in these pages—the popular
mind realised that from the very outset
the great proprietorial fortunes of the
colony had been begun in fraud and spolia-
tion, and perpetuated in oppression and
cruelty. It was clear from every incident in
Botany Bay history up to this, that the In-
terests thus formed had nothing in common
with the future of the colony or its ambition
in the direction of progress. As for the
capital the proprietors had expended, with
the exception of that brought by later
arrivals everyone knew how that was ac-
quired. And as for their expenditure of
work and energy, it was well enough known
that the opening up of the country was due
to the white labour of the iron-gangs and the
herds of assigned convict-workmen, toiling
like negro slaves in Georgia or Virginia,
under the convict whips of their relentless
and greedy masters. Such was the aspect of
affairs from the popular point of view.
* * *
All the efforts of Sir Richard Bourke to
sweep away the barbarism of the time and
to reconcile these two views in some degree,
only demonstrated the utter futility of any
labour of the kind while the practice of trans-
portation continued. Sir Richard saw what the
future of the colony might become, and the
impossibility of its realisation so long as the
Convict System was perpetuated. There
was but one remedy for what he saw around
him on every side, and that was the cessa-
tion of transportation altogether. He sent
a dispatch to this effect to the Secretary for
the Colonies, and the first step was taken in
earnest at last.
CHAPTER XXIX.
An Apologist fob Vested Interests.
Long before this the Tested Interest class
had recognised Bourke for an enemy. He
had made a friend of Wentworth, who was a
frequent guest at the Governor’s table, and
his private words and public acta showed the
exclusionists that their interests were in
danger at his hands. They therefore revived
all those agencies of attack which they and
their predecessors had brought to bear so
often before on previous Governors—the
anonymous letter, the scurrilous lampoon,
the private slander, the public charges to the
Colonial Office, and all those miserable
adjuncts of the art they had been at such
persistent pains to cultivate. It is unneces-
sary to pursue the ramifications of this busi-
ness, and the purpose of this paper will be
as well served by one case as by fifty. We
will select a typical one ; and nothing we
know of more clearly shows the character of
the people who opposed Bourke than the book
called “ The Felonry of New South Wales,”
by Major Mudie, before alluded to.
* * *
We have seen how this man so cruelly ill-
treated his convicts that some of them broke
out into open mutiny as their only chance of
escape from ,this chartered ruffian. I Five of
these men, it will be remembered, were
hanged for their part in this mutiny, and
the Governor was so struck by the state of
things disclosed at the enquiry that he re-
moved Major Mudie from the Commission
of the Peace. This mild punishment ap-
pears to have excoriated the Major’s tender
sensibilities to such a degree that he became
one of Bourke’s bitterest opponents in his
own small way, and the book just named is
the result. Major Mudie became the
mouthpiece of the class to which he
belonged, and of which he was such a worthy
member. The object of this vile production
was, in his own words, to “arraign at the
bar of public opinion the conduct of the Go-
vernor, and that of several of his func-
tionaries in the government of New South
Wales, and particularly as regards his and
their spirit of favouritism towards the con-
victs —it may even be politically said,
criminal collusion with convicts.” From
this extract it will be seen that the gallant
Major was readier with the lash than the
pen, but of course something must be al-
lowed for continual practice. Then the
story goes on.
Under the influence of pernicious princi-
ples respecting popular rights and popular
institutions, he continues, Bourke easily fell
into the hands of Judge Forbes and Mr.
Wentworth, and other politically dangerous
men in the community. Of these “ the
most dangerous, both from his position and
his insidiousness, was the Chief Justice. A
Bermudan by birth and educated in an
American college, Mr. Chief Justice Forbes
is a known Republican. . . . From the
first he assumed and performed the part of
the protector of the felonry.” This was the
verdict of the class Major Mudie represented
on the character of our first Chief Justice,
and the man who introduced the beginning
of Constitutional Government. Careful as
they always professed themselves to be of
the interests of law and order, when these
terms meant the preservation of their own
power, they were unscrupulous enemies of
both order and law and those who were ap-
pointed to preserve it under what they
called “felonial” government. When
Wentworth was appointed a magistrate the
cup of their bitterness was filled to over-
flowing. His policy was described as one of
“ eagerness to gain popularity by hollow
pretence to convictism and emancipitism,”
and, says the injured Major, “he had taken a
part in colonial politics so violent and pecu-
liar, besides that there were other circum-
stances regarding him to which it is not neces-
sary to advert, he was the very last free man
in the colony who should have been placed
on the Commission of the Peace. It gave
to this hot-brained and intemperate political
partisan a right to interfere still more than
he had done in the affairs of the colony, and
particularly with the proceedings of the
magistracy.” This extract will throw some
light on the subsequent career of Went-
worth.
* *
“One of the many grave charges against
Sir Richard Bourke,” says the Major again
with the utmost seriousness, “ is that he haa
exhibited an undue, an unwise, an impolitic
and a dangerous leniency towards the con-
vict population of the colony, and that he
has not only manifested this disgraceful pro-
pensity in the acts of his Government, but
that he has taken into his special grace and
favour the well-known apologists and advo-
cates of the convicts, while he has averted
his countenance from the disciplinarians who
have presumed to oppose his frantic experi-
m cuts, or to remonstrate against the lax and
demoralising tendency of his system.” This
good Major is clearly one of those people
who have been counselled not to play with
edged tools. A pen in this man’s hand is
as dangerous to the class of which he is the
mouthpiece as a petard or a torpedo. In
this extract, this disciplinarian whose men
were glad to escape him even through the
trap-door of a gallows admits the whole case
against the Vested Interest class, and throws
away the mask. No man was better qualified
to speak on behalf of the disciplinarians
than this writer. Before the mutiny on his
estate occurred a story was told in which he
figured rather unpleasantly, and which per-
haps had a great deal to do with what
happened afterwards. One of his assigned
servants took to the bush, and travelled on
foot one hundred and forty miles, presented
himself at Government House, and com-
plained of the outrageous tyranny and
oppression of his master, Major Mudie. The
Governor’s son and private secretary saw the
runaway, heard his story, comforted and
advised him, and sent him back to his master
with a letter, begging that the unfortunate
man might not be too severely visited for
his error in taking to the bush to lay his
case in person before the authorities. It
is Major Mudie himself who tells the
story, and he unblushingly adds the
sequel. He charges the Governor’s son
in his book with unlawfully and criminally
harbouring a bushranger, and immediately
on the return of the man he handed him
over to a bench of his neighbour magistrates,
who promptly sentenced him to labour in
the chain-gang as a bushranger—“in con-
formity with law,” adds the Major. There
were at that time one hundred free and con-
vict labourers on Mudie’s estate, and it may
easily be believed that the unlucky result of
this man’s application for help from the
authorities, and their master’s action in the
matter, precipitated the mutiny that fol-
lowed.
It would be tedious to follow this writer
in his defence of the class of which he was
such a worthy member. His book is nothing
more or less than a foul collection of villain-
ous charges against Bourke and those of his
officials who assisted him in drawing the
fangs of the propertied classes. Some filthy
stories about the private lives of successful
Emancipists have been carefully garnered up,
and Major Mudie devoted his congenial
talents to the collection of all the incidents
of this kind that delighted his delicate
fancy. Utter unscrupulousness and literary
larrikinism are evidenced in every page ;
but the result of the whole is merely to
place the class he spoke for in a worse light,
if possible, than before. Of course the
Governor was the chief mark for his slanders,
and the very line of attack hia scurrilous


assailant takes is, per-
haps, Bourke’s best
apology. After ex-
plaining with approval
how Governor Darling
prohibited the convicts
from directly address-
ing themselves to the
Government on any
pretence, and confined
them to making their
complaints or applica-
tions to the nearest
bench of magistrates,
he charges Bourke
with the flagrant crime
of encouraging “ the
correspondence of con-
victs with himself and
victs with himself and r . " 1
his functionaries, re- ' 11 . ~
ceiving the secret ac-
cusations of any of the
ruffians of the colony
against their masters,
and even comforting
and advising runaways
who repaired to him
for consolation.”
The good faith of
this accusation and its
maker may be judged
from the fact that the
complaints of convicts
were usually against
the cruelty of their
masters. It has been
already explained that
the magistrates were
the convict-masters,
and were in the habit
of obliging each other
by the torture of the
assigned servants
brought before them.
This was a reciprocal
favour; the magistrate
who sentenced his
friend’s servant to the
lash to-day might ask
a similar favour from
the friend the day
after, or even the same
day. It was a pleasant
system, based on the
polished amenities and
graceful sense of the
duty of mutual obliga-
tion which is the in-
visible bond of all
polite society, and it
is much to the credit
of Governor Darling’s
proper taste that he
recognised this feature
in the higher circle of
colonial life, and paid
its members the deli-
cate attention to which
Major Mudie so appre-
ciatively refers. There
a number and with his own name as
the assignee master.” What with that
which the disciplinarian Major has told
us of his treatment of his white labour,
and what he omitted to tell but which
has come to us from other and perhaps
more reliable sources, we get quite a
pleasant picture of slave-life on the
estate of “Castle Forbes.” When
the assigned servants mutinied, they
endeavoured to express to him their
deep sense of the trouble he had taken
in their interests, and had the Major
not been so exceedingly deft at running
away he would certainly have had no
cause to complain of their ingratitude.
They took possession of his house while
he was away, and though they refrained
its members the deli- from assassinating they
cate attention to which Gim tval of the fittest. pillaged the place of what arms, amnxu-
Major Mudie so appre- . nition, and food they could, and took
ciatively refers. There to the road in search of their master,
was no coarse and brutal interference with nothing, of course, to the convict that any They found that good man, and were plea-
vested rights on Darling’s part, therefore, chance of redress was denied him, for he had santly preparing to flog him to death with

any complaint against his master he should could not be expected to appreciate the into the river and escaped amid a shower of
make it known to his master’s friend, amenities of polite society. But Bourke had shot and curses. One is apt to experience a
Botany Bay etiquette required this. It was the excessively bad taste to listen to com- tender regret here that these clumsy con*


riots did not give him some lashes—just a
few—before his modest diffidence led him to
decline that testimonial. We scarcely know
where to bestow our astonishment—on the
strange revulsion of feeling which led the
Major to condemn the use of the lash in this
single instance, or on the gaucherie of the
uncultivated Boeotians who allowed him to
make his escape.
* *
The moral obliquity which would make
the state of things existing under the assign-
ment system decently tolerable is almost
incredible at even this short distance of
time. But the records of actual occurrences
set down by one who believed and was an
active agent in that system put the circum-
stances of the time out of the region of in-
certitude. This is the value—and the only
value—of Major Mudie’s slanderous book.
The only touch of colour wanting to what
has been already described will be found
perhaps in the fact that the souls and bodies
of convict men and women were committed
to the irresponsible care of men like one
whose character and personality are can-
didly painted by himself in his own shame-
less book. It is almost impossible to doubt
that the man was sincere—that he believed
as emphatically as the men who approve and
administer the penal laws of to-day, in the
justice of the system of which he formed a
part. The hypocrisy which would allow a
man to write as this man has written if he
did not hold the views he sets forth would
be too fiendish or too melodramatic to pass
ordinary criticism. And the fact that the
lives of men and women were at the mercy
of such merely mechanical instruments of
torture as this man describes himself to be
only goes to prove the worst that has been
said about the convict system. “The
scorching glow of conscious shame—and
the groan of the convict’s agony—are more
appropriate,” wrote the Major referring to
Bourke and his officials, “to the feelings of
men thus indelibly stamped with the guilt of
public delinquency, and held up to derision,
contempt, and scorn for their mental incapa-
city and folly. ” This fantastic sentence reads
almost like the words of a man who really
believes in what he says.
The Governor could not take any notice of
the slanders in this book, but it was just as
well, perhaps, that the gallant Major slan-
dered someone who could give him his atten-
tion, and from whom it would seem that
sturdy disciplinarian could not run away.
Most of Major Mudie’s libels were perpe-
trated on safe men—on men who had been
hanged, for instance, or on the Governor
who could not reply, or on officials who were
advanced in years. But in one of his slan-
ders Major Mudie caught a Tartar. Mr.
Kinchela, afterwards Judge, held office as
Attorney-General in his time. That gentle-
man had displayed a certain amount of
humanity in the discharge of the duties of
his office—-was, perhaps, concerned in the
enquiry into the Castle Forbes” mutiny.
Major Mudie referred to him in his book in
these terms :—“ Deficient in legal know-
ledge, he has not even the address or man-
ners, or the language of a gentleman. His
utterance is bad, and strongly tinctured with
tke brogue of Kilkenny ; and, to crown the
whole, he is excessively deaf—a defect
necessarily subjecting him to the most mis-
chievous or the most ludicrous mistakes.”
The Attorney-General could not resent this
scurrilous blackguardism. But he had a son.
The young fellow interviewed Major Mudie
with a horsewhip. He had talked the
matter over with his friends, and they
decided that something like fifty lashes
would about meet the Major’s case. So the
young man stepped airily up to that gallant
and high-spirited officer one day, and with
cool precision proceeded to carry out the
sentence. There was no river for the Major
to jump into this time, and he could not run
away. So he had to take his punishment
with the best grace he had, and content him-
self with the usual threats of redress in the
courts of law. He took his case into court,
and as there was no denying either the
assault or the events that led up to it, young
Kinchela was mulct in the sum of £6O,
being at the rate of £1 for every stroke of
the whip. The young fellow paid the money
with pleasure, and expressed an opinion that
the entertainment was a very cheap one at
the price.
Enough of Major Mudie. He and his
book have served their purpose, and that
brave man himself has gone to his own
place—a place, perhaps, where he will have
no reason to complain of the severity of the
penal discipline. We have used him and
his book to throw light on the character of
the class to which he belonged, and on the
nature of their opposition to Bourke and his
policy. What has been said in this and the
preceding paper will give the reader an idea
of what the work of reform really meant.
One cannot fail to be struck at the similarity
of the things described to that which existed
under the New South Wales Corps in the
first years of settlement. There was the
same division of classes and the same cruelty
and oppression on one side, and suffering
and despair on the other. Major Mudie is
the legitimate successor of Captain Mac-
arthur, and the seed that pioneer sowed had
by this time brought forth a plentiful har-
vest crop after its kind. The settlement
had now been in existence for nearly 50
years, and the only mark of development
or progress yet shown so far as adminis-
trative detail was concerned, was that men-
tioned above. The scene described as having
taken place in the Bathurst Courthouse may
be read side by side with another, elsewhere
treated, which occurred at Parramatta at
the beginning of the century. On that
occasion two floggers set to work on the
victim at once, so that the torture was com-
paratively short. This was a crude and un-
refined method, with no element of the
artistic about it. But on this last occasion
the executioners relieved each other, and
the lashes were given at half-minute time,
so that the suffering wretch might miss no
twinge or throb of his torture. This was
progress, indeed. It was one of those
thoughtful attentions which had their origin
in that more polished society of the ‘ ‘ colo-
nial aristocracy ” into which the ruder con-
ditions of the New South Wales Corps had
been translated. It would be pleasant to
speculate as to the further results in the way
of refinement of cruelty these ingenious
wretches would have devised had Bourko
not prematurely crushed the whole system
out of existence altogether.
CHAPTER XXX.
Under the Microscope.
If these things moved Bourke to vigorous
action, how much more may they not be
supposed to have goaded men like Went-
worth and Warded, and the Patriotic Asso-
ciation they led ? The case of Wentworth
was a singular one. Born at Norfolk Island,
the very hot-bed and centre of all that was
horrible in the convict-system, he went home
at a sufficiently early age to leave his mind
open to other impressions. His character
was formed on something that differed
widely from Botany Bay models, by the
time he returned to Australia in the com-
pany of the man who influenced his future
action so nobly. These men personify for
us the intelligent patriotic sentiment of the
time. They saw with a more sympathetic
eye than Bourke the details of the working
of the convict-system. Occupying no official
position they were in a measure identified
with the colony and its larger interests, as
distinguishable from the Vested Interests
against which they unrestingly fought. The
terrible social results of the convict rule were
always before their eyes, and they saw ship-
load after shipload of rustic transportees
discharged from prison-ships at Circular
Quay, to be dragooned and tortured into
hopeless criminals and duly fitted and trained
for their end—the gallows. Instances might
be multiplied indefinitely to show how surely
and fatally the system worked to transform
the raw import into the finished article. It
will not be necessary to go into detail to
demonstrate this, however, and we will be
content in this case, as in others, to select a
typical case and let it stand as representative
of all.
* * *
Quite a large proportion of those who were
sent out to Australia in prison-ships were
convicted of poaching. From the time of
William the Conqueror, when men’s eyes
were put out for killing a hart, the game-
laws have always been among the most
priceless treasures of British criminal juris-
prudence. The young man who shot a
hare or a partridge was sent to Botany
Bay in the same ship with the murderer
or the habitual criminal. A love for
sport and a borrowed gun have sent more
good colonist* to New South Wales than any
other impelling power save the goldfields.
We have now before us the police history of
one of those juvenile poachers, drawn up in
the Convict Superintendent’s office for some
purpose of which we have no present indica-
tion, in 1851. The name at the head of
this faded document is “ Hugh Doogan,”
and it appears from the record that he
was convicted in Dublin, 1838, of snaring
pheasants, and sentenced to transportation
beyond the seas for a term of seven years.
God knows what history of domestic woe is
summarised in these three or four official
lines, but that there was something of the
kind we may be certain, for the lad was
only eighteen years of age. Like thou-
sands more he was huddled below deck


out of sight, and floated away in due
course into what he and the thousands like
him doubtless regarded as the veritable
under-world. v He arrived in 1839, took his
place among the working-convicts, and pro-
ceeded to exemplify the working of the
system in his own microscopic way. It may
be here remarked as a singular circumstance
amply borne out by facts and figures that
these young Irish convicts, sent out for petty
offences, formed the class out of which the
convict-system produced its worst and most
characteristic results. It is well-known that
the nationality of these men subjected them
to a great deal of harsh treatment, and then-
own impulsive temperament seems to have
added whatever was necessary to make them
promising raw material for the operation of
such a system.
♦ * *
This Hugh Doogan was in the colony just
nine months—about long enough, we may
suppose, to give his fetters time to bite—
when we find him, by this record, sentenced
to 36 lashes for being absent without leave.
After this first step the descent to hell was
easy. Six months later we find him sen-
tenced to 50 lashes for disorderly conduct,
and 12 months after that to 50 lashes for
neglect of work. Six months later he was
locked up in the cells for 14 days for
drunkenness, and as this treatment does not
appear to have recommended itself to his
capricious approval, we find him absconding
as soon as he got out of his exquisite little
cell. He was captured and sent to the
treadmill for two months, and six months
after he finished his arduous labours in that
capacity he achieved six months in irons for
drunkenness and assault. Six months after
his release again—the insect we have now
under the lens seems to have generally kept
within bounds for six months at a time —he
was sent to Cockatoo Island for the remainder
of his sentence. There is no reason given in
the record before us for this step, but per-
haps the authorities thought it a pity to
neglect such a promising instance of the
success of the system by leaving its develop-
ment to mere chance. He was quiet again
for just six months, when the record says he
was sentenced to seven days’ cells for dis-
orderly conduct; but this does not seem to
have discouraged him, for we find him nine
days later sentenced to two months at the
treadmill, also for disorderly conduct. Tw6
months after that was over he took it into his
mind to assault someone —a keeper, perhaps,
for he was sentenced to nine months in irons
for his little freak. Sent to Blackheath, he
ran away from the stockade there when his
period was over, and there is no sentence re-
corded. It would be useless to speculate
why. But at the end of 1846 we find him
sentenced to twelve months in irons for re-
peatedly absconding, which was a bad habit.
Six months after that he again ran rapidly
away, though in wffiat miraculous manner
he did so this time the dry record before us
disdains to tell. At all events, he was
sentenced to twelve months in irons for his
feat a week later, so we may guess that Mr.
Doogan did not succeed in running away
very far.
* *
Bearing up under his difficulties, he made
another attempt to add to his record three
months later, when he was sentenced to 14
days’ cells for bad and abusive language,
which was wrong and no doubt thoroughly in-
excusable. But two months later we find him
dancing with a light heart on the treadmill
again for two months because he once more
tried to run away. He does not appear to have
taken the same interest in the experiment
of which he was the subject as the reader
does, possibly, but then some allowance
must be made for the personal equation in
these matters. Bad and abusive language,
four months later, sent him for 14 days to
the retirement of his little cell, and in two
months more we find him at the treadmill
again for another eight weeks for abscond-
ing. Then for nine months we hear nothing
further of him. We have now brought this
specimen up to the end of 1847. His
original. sentence was for seven years, but
he has already spent nine in penal servitude,
so that we may infer that at about this stage
Hugh Doogan was released. During the
period of his servitude we can count 16
subordinate sentences recorded against this
man, who came to the colony a mere boy
whose crime was the snaring of pheasants.
One hundred and thirty-six lashes are re-
corded here, five weeks in the cells, six
months at the treadmill, and three years and
three months in irons. Add to this the
miseries of the ordinary convict’s lot when
not “ under punishment,” and we get a fair
idea of the educative agencies brought to
bear on this poor wretch, who entailed on
himself a career of life-long misery for
stealing a brace or two of birds.
Turned adrift at the expiration of his
term, as we suppose, it is not difficult to
realise his position. This item of humanity
had had no experience whatever of life, out-
side his 18 years of rustic boyhood and his
nine years under the convict-system. Of
the outer world he knew nothing. Had
Mr. Doogan been hanged at this point
in his career, and his mental state
diagnosed by an autopsy of the brain
—supposing the operation effectual for
such a purpose—it would doubtless have
been found that the universe for him con-
sisted of a squire and a gamekeeper, a judge
and a court of justice, a prison-ship, and the
chain-gang. This suggests a pretty meta-
physical study, which we will not pursue.
Only it might be pointed out that, what-
ever the scheme of Creation may be,
a creature in the position of this Hugh
Doogan could have no part or hope in
it. Under the circumstances what was he
to do—cut adrift, as he was, among people
who had nothing in common with him ex-
cept in one point ? He solved that question
in the only way open to him, and joined the
only people who- had anything in common
with himself. He didn’t take long about it,
either. For in September, 1848, just seven
months after he completed his last sentence,
we find him tried at the Maitland Criminal
Court for horse-stealing, and sentenced to
ten years’ hard labour on the roads or other
public works of the colony. This was a sig-
nal triumph for the system as a manufactory
of criminals. It was as certain and as sure
in its operation as the grinding of the mills
of God, and the boy who entered under the
yoke emerged at the end of his sentence a
graduated and hopeless felon, ripe for the
gibbet, and unfit for anything else in the
existing state of the criminal law.
And just here occurs a singular entry in
the police history before us, which is suscep-
tible of at least one explanation, and we can
think of no other. On the same day that
the last sentence was recorded, Doogan, who
arrived by the convict-ship Waverley, was
charged in the name of Henry Herbert, per
ship Maugles, and sentenced to 12 lunar
months in iSydney gaol for horse-stealing.
Unless Mr. Doogan was imported in sections,
in two different ships, there was clearly
something wrong here. But in the face of
so much that was flagrantly wrong there is
no room left for astonishment at any trifling
detail of this kind. At any rate our speci-
men took his place again among the convicts,
and one month later we find him going to
the cells for 14 days for refusing to work and
threatening the overseer. For 12 months
he is quiet again, when we find him dis-
charged of an imputation that he had been
fighting in the mess-shed. Five months
after that he is sentenced to 14 days’ cells
again for outrageous conduct in the office ;
and so far as this record shows or is con-
cerned that is his last appearance on that
or any other stage. Whether he died
under the system, or was released
and reclaimed; or if this ink-faded and
patched document bearing date Feb-
ruary 11, 1851—was compiled for the infor-
mation of a judge whose duty it may have
been to sentence Hugh Doogan to the last
penalty of the law; there is no evidence
before this writer to show. The rest of this
man’s dismal story is lost among the tens of
thousands of life-stories that lost themselves
blindly among the horrors of the convict-
system, as feeble summer creeks in the Aus-
tralian interior trickle and lose themselves
amongst the desert sands.
* *
This, then, is the story of a convict in the
forcing-bed of crime which is meant when
we speak of the convict-system. We have
seen him pass through all the stages, just as
a college-bred youth passes through all his
academical degrees to become a doctor of
divinity, or a piece of crude ore through its
processes to come out a needle or an anchor.
And just as these mechanical processes could
not produce a fish, for instance, but must
needs result in a needle or an anchor accord-
ing to the design of the artificer, so even
this rustic lad could not emerge from the
system through which he was passed in any
other form than that of a confirmed criminal.
Such a system would have sufficed to barba-
rise a philosopher ; and assuredly this poor
pheasant-filcher was not such. His ultimate
end, therefore, was as fixed as fate and as
unavoidable, and though the record is silent
as to what became of Hugh Doogan, it leaves
very little room for speculation on the sub-
ject. So far as essentials are concerned the
system is the same to-day. The criminal
chooses his career in the first instance, and
so far the responsibility rests with circum-
stances over which he has more or less
control. But once his choice is made
there is no escape from it. Even to this
very day we have every appliance for
punishing and distinguishing those who


break the law, but none for reforming
them. All authorities on prison discipline
admit the fact, and their only reason or
excuse is based on considerations of ex-
pense. By-and-bye someone will discover
that this ground is untenable, and that
law-breaking may be minimised under an
enlightened and philosophic system which
will recognise the fact that crime is a neces-
sary evil, but that its propagation is not a
necessary State function. In that Utopian
day perhaps the money-vote for the main-
tenance of the Department of Prisons will
be more intelligently employed.
* * *
No doubt such cases as the one we have
individualised came daily and hourly under
the observation of Wentworth and Warded,
and it is a significant fact that up to the
death of the latter, these men were always
in the front of any movement that tended to
do away with the first cause of all these
things. As time went on, and Dr. Warded
himself fell a victim to the state of things he
denounced, the action of Wentworth became
less single-minded. He gradually left be-
hind him most of his popular sympathies,
until at last he actually left the colony alto-
gether rather than live under the free insti-
tutions he is credited with having brought
into existence. The stages of this fading-oft
will be seen as this account goes on; but in
the meantime this is the place to note the
appearance of another liberal leader. Dr.
Bland, whose name is one of the best-known
of the popular party, was himself a trans-
portee. He was a distinguished physician’s
son, and became himself a surgeon in the
navy. He fought a duel with the purser of
his ship on an East Indian station, and killed
his man at the first shot. Then he challenged
one of the lieutenants for imputing unfairness.
The men met, but neither was in j ured. A little
later both were arrested, and, on being tried
at Calcutta, were sentenced to seven years’
transportation. William Bland was sent to
Botany Bay in 1814, and within a year ob-
tained a free pardon and entered on the
practice of his profession. He was im-
prisoned for twelve months and fined £5O
for libelling Governor Macquarie, and on his
release he showed that his enforced oppor-
tunities for closely observing the working of
the convict-system had not been lost on him.
He at once entered on the career in which
he persevered until his death in 1868, at the
age of seventy-nine years ; and one of the
most striking sights in Sydney for some
years before that event was the spectacle of
this white-haired and benevolent old man,
the greater part of whose long life had been
spent in doing good, and in unswerving de-
votion to the popular cause. Such a life as
his stands out against the squalid story of
Botany Bay like the shadow of a great rock
in a thirsty land.
Bland was one of the first members of
the Patriotic Association. He brought
to the popular cause the aid of his voice
and pen, and he also laboured with most
benevolent zeal in his professional capacity
among the poorest and most friendless of the
population. It would be impossible to re-
produce the feelings of the people in his
regard without the use of words that might
lead to a suspicion of exaggeration. The
public charities were his especial care, and
whatever is best in them we owe to the
philanthropy of Dr. William Bland, whose
name is one of the worthy few we are so
rapidly forgetting. Some day, perhaps,
some popular speaker will make a popular
speech and recall to the minds of those who
can remember him, the venerable figure of
this old-time hero, and all the good work
that he has left after him as a pleading
memory.
* * *
A series of letters written by Bland to
Charles Bulwer, M.P., England, on the
rights of colonists in Australia, placed him
in the front rank of the popular advocates.
In his speeches at the meetings held from
time to time to advocate the views of the
Patriotic Association and its claim for free
institutions, Bland was always well in accord
with the most enlightened aspirations of the
class that eventually gained the responsible
government that came after. He was a
strong opponent of Vested Interests in the
convict-system and all that sheltered under
that unclean thing, and he unsparingly
pointed out how those Interests were opposed
to the prospects of the colony, and an
obstacle in the way of progress. In one of
his best known speeches he dwelt on the
rights of the native-born, claiming that the
possession of talent was more important than
the possession of ill-acquired acres, and
stating that for his part he knew of no
“stake in the country” save that of liberty
and life. For this he earned the scurrilous
enmity of the Vested Interest party on the
one hand, and on the other was elected in
due time one of the first members of the
Legislature for Sydney, when the first mea-
sure of self-government was introduced.
* * *
It will be unnecessary to do more than
give a brief synopsis of the results of
Governor Bourke’s rule. We have seen
what the colony was when he came into it.
He practically established the jury system.
He gave up the privilege of assigning con-
vict servants into the hands of a Board. He
amended the brutal and barbarous prison
discipline, and struck the names of 33 con-
vict-master magistrates off the list at one
blow. He issued regular accounts of State
receipts and expenditure for the first time ;
before his coming the Governors did as they
thought fit with the revenues. He estab-
lished a system of free immigration. He
did away with a State Church, and with the
law which gave it one-seventh of the lands
of the colony as its dowry. He established
religious equality. He founded Victoria. He
acknowledged the liberty of the Press. This
skeleton list is more eloquent and effective
than volumes of eulogy to fix Bourke’s place in
Australian history. It only remains to add
that the Vested Interests drove him out of
the country. The Governor had nominated
Mr. Roger Therry (afterwards Judge) to the
Chairmanship of Quarter Sessions. His
candidature was opposed by Mr, Riddell,
one of the Vested Interest class and Colonial
Treasurer. The latter was successful. Bourke
removed him from the Executive Council
for his official irregularity in opposing the
Governor’s will. The matter was referred
home, and Riddell was reinstated. The
Governor tendered his own resignation,
which Earl Grey begged him to withdraw.
He remained firm, however, and retired
from the colony which he had so ably
governed—a victim to the unscrupulous and
unrelenting opposition which has consistently
pursued every friend of popular measures
before and since.
* * *
Bourke continued to hold office as Go-
vernor of New South Wales from 1830 to
1837. No Imperial ruler has deserved
better of the country than he. A statue
stands in the Sydney Domain to remind the
people of the mother-colony of his services,
and of the condition of things against the
survival of which they have to guard. His
endeavours were not entirely successful; it
had been a miracle if they were. But that
statue in the Sydney Domain is a mile-stone
for the people on their way from the state of
things he found on his arrival towards that
fair prospect to which his liberal rule pointed
the way.
CHAPTER XXXI.
The Transportation Question.
Sir George Gipps arrived at the beginning
of 1838. He had been a captain in the
Engineers, and afterwards private secretary
to a Cabinet Minister by whose influence be
was made one of three Commissioners sent
to Canada before the little rebellion there in
1837. Gipps was a clever and experienced
man, a good speaker, and Lang says 1 ‘ his
moral sense was somewhat obtuse.” But
then Lang was in the habit of making
Gaelic remarks about everyone who did not
favour the claims of the Scots’ Church.
However, Gipps arrived in the colony just
after a masterful predecessor, and it is pro-
verbially a difficult task to fit the prophet’s
mantle to his successor’s shoulders.
For some years after Bourke’s departure
the results of his policy followed each other
in rapid succession. We have said that, ap-
palled at the magnitude of. the evils of the
convict-system, and the hopelessness of any
attempt to remedy them from within the
colony, he sent a despatch to the Colonial
Office urging on the authorities the discon-
tinuance of the transportation system alto-
gether. In 1835 that correspondence in
which Dr. Bland took part was opened
up with Mr. Lytton Bulwer, and the
abolition of transportation • became one
of the test-points of the Patriotic Associa-
tion. The Governor’s despatch gave the
agitators a definite ground to go upon, but
two years after his departure the Vested In-
terest party held a large meeting in Sydney
—February, 1839—t0 advocate the con-
tinuance of the convict-system, to which
that party was so much attached. In Octo-
ber of the following year Gipps informed his
Council that the Home Government, moved,
doubtless, by Bourke’s powerful representa-
tions, had decided to stop the custom of
transporting criminals to New South Wales,
and next month the * Eden, which the
colonists regarded as the last prison-ship
that would bring its freight of sorrow and
sin to Botany Bay, sailed down the harbour
and discharged its convicts at Circular Quay,
But the struggle was not to end so easily as


that. It was not to be expected that the tions have answered themselves since then,

It is not to be thought that the shocking
enormities of the convict-system had escaped
censure in England. The men who advo-
cated the Reform Bill of 1832, and the
abolition of slavery, were not likely to allow
these things to pass in silence after they had
once been brought under their notice. By
the Grace of God there were always humane
men there who lifted up strong voices against
its crying iniquities. Among these was
Bishop Hinds, who wrote in 1832 con-
demning the system in unmeasured terms in
the name of religion, humanity, and mora-
lity—national and private. This man looked
into the future, and
made an honest effort
to gauge the influence
on colonial social con-
ditions of the institu-
tion he condemned.
His conclusions were
not favourable ones.
“ Begin by breaking
up the system,” was
the only advice he
could offer. ‘ ‘ There is
no chance for the co-
lony unless that pre-
liminary step be
taken.” But this was
not all. So convinced
had he become of the
extent to which the
traditions and spirit of
the system had sunk
into and leavened the
whole of colonial so-
ciety, that he could
see no reasonable hope
for the future so long
as those traditions were
allowed to cling. This
conviction has been am-
ply borne out by events.
Every association that
could reveal thepastwas
dangerous, he thought.
“ There should be a
change of place,”
he recommended —“a
transfer, if possible, of
the seatof Government
to some site within the
colony as yet untainted
with the defiling asso-
ciations of crime and
•v, infamy.” This language
jjji is strong, but just.

This writer dreaded
t that, even if the
/ plague-spot were to
be removed, the public
sentiment would continue to be charged
with the disease so long as the infection of
association remained. We must look into
our criminal code, and the traditional spirit
that underlies our social conditions to find
how far his dread was justified. But this
honest bishop might have gone a logical
step further, and recommended the com-
plete removal of all officials and others
trained under and associated with the con-
vict-system, or officially formed on the
models of the men who administered it.
These were the men into whose souls the
iron had entered.


Archbishop Whately, speaking in the
H( mse of Lords some years later —in 1840,
namely —used even stronger Avords. A com-
mittee of the House of Commons on trans-
portation, which met in 1837, had in the
meantime collected a startling body of dam-
natory evidence. 1 Its publication struck
horror into the minds of all who read it, and
many voices were raised against the abomina-
tion that had been nursed into being under
the British flag. Said Whately, voicing the
public sentiment on the subject:—“Better,
far better would it have been that the lands
of New South Wales should have remained
till the end of time in their primitive wild-
ness, better for. the mother-country, for the
aborigines, for the settlers themselves, that
the whole region should have been sAvalloAved
up in the ocean, than that it should have
been erected into such a monument of
national folly and perversity, such a strong-
hold and seminary of wide-spreading and
moral corruption as it noAVexhibits.” These
scarifying words represent the verdict of an
English Archbishop on the working of that
so-called “ designs of Providence ” theory
which, as we saxv in the first of these papers,
was announced as having given the Austra-
lian continent —the “great lone, melancholy
island that had lain for thousands of years
asleep in a summer sea ” —to the civilisation
of Britain as its inheritance.
It cannot be too often repeated in this
connection that such invective as this was
intended to apply, not so much to the actual
convict, whom, indeed, it was proposed to
recal, but still more, and with far greater
reason, as their influence for evil was the
stronger, to the class built up by the exercise
of the gaoler’s authority. Dr. Whately
understood as well as any man the true
character of this element in the Australian
community. He knew what he was talking
about when he spoke these words. For in
the years that preceded 1838 he was instru-
mental in collecting evidence to put a stop to
that Assignment System under which the
evil had grown up, and which he had been
engaged in unsparingly exposing for some
years before.
* *
Listen to Dr. Whately again :—“ To per-
severe, I say, knowingly and deliberately,
in thus creating a profligate nation, and by
continual fresh supplies making and keeping
it from genei’ation to generation the most
hopelessly corrupt community that ever the
sun shone upon, would be a national crime
and folly which I do trust there is too much
good feeling axxd good sense among us to
endure.” And to Bishop Hinds, ixx choral
response :—“Think of what stuff this people
will have been made of ; and who it is that
posterity will then curse for bringing this
mildew on the social intercourse of the
Avorld ; who it is that will be answerable for
the injury done by it to human virtue and
human happiness, at a tribunal more distant,
but more awful even than posterity.”
Truly, the opinions of experts on the sub-
ject of the designs of Providence were be-
ginning seriously to differ 1
* * ♦
What side Dr. Wardell would have taken
in this dispute of course it is now impos-
sible to say with certainty. Certain it is,
however, that Mr. Wentworth became one
of the leaders of the “Banditti Party,” and
an advocate for the continuance of the
state of things against which he was under-
stood to be fighting up to the present stage.
He had by this time become largely inte-
rested in squatting and an employer of con-
vict labour, and as he grew richer and began
to acquire a Vested Interest of his own in
the system, he exchanged his popular and
patriotic sympathies for a price which few
patriots, at least in these modern times, and
certainly in Australia, have been found able
to resist. The ambition to become a larger
landed proprietor and territorial magnate of
Botany Bay was too much for Mr. Went-
worth’s patriotism, although he still con-
tinued to take an active part in the agitation
for responsible government, which, as we
shall see presently, had been going on all
this time.
“Not satisfied with being one of the
largest speculators in land and stock in Nexv
South Wales,” says Lang, “ that gentleman
had fixed his eye on a principality in New
Zealand.” Mr. Wentworth had a fondness
for titles and dignities, and it will be seen
when we come to speak about the Constitu-
tion that a proposal to create a peerage of
colonial dukes, earls, and barons was
actually inserted by him in his first draft of
the Constitution. Something similar seems
to have moved him in the case to which
Lang refers, which is interesting for the
strong light it throws on the personal char-
acter of the man. The first colonists visited
New Zealand just after the beginning of the
century, but it was not until many years after-
wards that colonisation set in there. Some
time previous to 1840, Wentworth had bought
from a feAV of the Maori chiefs, whose tribes
were sparsely scattered through the Middle
Island, an expanse of territory covering
twenty millions of acres —nearly the whole
of the island. The treaty of purchase was
drawn up by a few Maori chiefs on the one
side, who ceded the territory, and William
Charles Wentworth, who paid over the
stipulated price in blankets, muskets,
powder, and some store goods from Sydney.
The instrument or deed was made in Maori
and English, and signed by the chiefs and
Mr. Wentworth, in the presence of regular
witnesses.
This sale the authorities ixx Sydney dis-
puted, and Wentworth appeared before the
old xxominee Council and advocated his claim
in person, “ proudly displaying his parch-
ment with the signs-manual and seals of the
indepexxdent and sovereign chiefs afore-
said,” and concluding by asking nothing
from the generosity or charity, but demand-
ing everythhxg from the justice of England.
Gipps saxv through this pseudo-patriot. “He
showed up the claim of Wexxtworth in
a torrent of sarcasm which it is xxo marvel,”
said Lang, “ that that gexxtleman has never
been able to forget,” and “ concluded by
literally overwhelming Mr. Wentworth and
his notorious attempt to appropriate, for his
own private benefit, the country which
might otherwise become the happy home of
myriads of his fellow-countrymen.” Clearly,
Mr. Wentworth was a man of large views,
but it appears to have escaped the notice of
those who condemned this vigorous stroke
that there was no difference in principle to
the “ myriads of his fellow-countryman” be-
tween the fact of his taking up all this
country alone, and its being taken up by 40
or 50 monopolists in the same terms. The
myriads are just as badly off in any case,
and the bulk of the freehold lands of Aus-
tralia are just as securely locked up in
the hands of less than 100 capitalists as
if a proprietorship had been claimed by one.
The difference is, of course, a great one to
the hundred individuals who divide the
spoil, but nothing Avhatever to the myriads
who ai’e equally shut out in either case.
* * *
“ If all the jobs which have been done since
the days of Sir Robert Walpole were col-
lected into one job they would not make
so big a job,” said Gipps in his speech
in the Council, “as the one Mr. Went-
worth asks me to lend a hand in perpetrat-
ing ; the job, that is to say, of making to
him a grant of twenty millions of acres, at
at the rate of 100 acres for a farthing ! The
Land Company of New South Wales has
been said to be a job ; one million of acres
at eighteen pence an acre has been thought
to be a pretty good job ; but it absolutely
vanishes into nothing by the side of Mr.
Wentworth’s job. ” That speech finished the
patriot’s business. It burst up his scheme
for a principality in New Zealand, while at
the same time it conclusively demonstrated
the impossibility of ever again trusting Mr.
WentAVorth in the position of a popular
leader. Public confidence fell away, though
the masterful character of the man still kept
him well in front of the popular movement
until Constitutional Government Avas ob-
tained. Meantime, after this instance, there
is no occasion to explain the application of
the term “Banditti Party” to the people
of Avhom Wentworth was now the recognised
leader.
CHAPTER XXXII.
Constitutional Development.
For a time the anti-transportation question
remained in abeyance. A larger question
absorbed public interest, and kept the minds
of all parties abundantly occupied. The
movement towards Responsible Government
and a popular Constitution had been going
on all this time, but, as the issue became
more and more certain, the popular will
grew more vague and nebulous in its ex-
pression, and the public demands more
blurred and ill-defined. The absence of
capable and trustAvorthy leaders became
more marked, as Wentworth s work which
promised so well broke off short like one of
those fractured columns, once part of a noble
pile, that noAV glitter vacuously and mearx-
inglessly in the white light of an Eastern
sun.
* * *
When, 20 years before, Governor Brisbane
awoke from his contemplation of the stellar
system to a knoxvledge of his immediate sur-
roundings, he saw that the people required
to be protected from the rapacity of certain
among themselves. He saw that their evils
came, ixot from Downing-street, but from
the people in immediate authority in the


icbmy itself. On his departure, as we have
seen, he took with him a strong desire to
serve the future interests of the settlement
he had at first neglected, and a deputation of
colonists which waited on him before he set
sail to express their regret at his leaving, took
the opportunity in the address they pre-
sented to state their desire for taxation by
representation through an elective Assembly
of 100 members. This, the first recorded
request for Parliamentary institutions, and
the first public meeting for the purpose, took
place on 21st October, 1825. The deputation
that presented this address consisted of
Messrs. D’Arcy and William Charles Went-
worth, Thomas llaine, W. J. Browne, and
Daniel Cooper. As far back as 1812 the
Select Committee appointed to enquire into the
affairs of the colony recommended that the
Governor should be assisted in his duties by
the advice of a Council. This was in Mac-
quarie’s time. That
official knew too well,
as Brisbane and Bourke
afterwards discovered,
that the class from
which such a Council
would be drawn—the
official and propertied
element—had no sym-
pathies in common with
the settlement at large,
and that the colony
rather asked and re-
quired protection from
these gentry than re-
presentation through
them. His own efforts
for the general ad-
vancement were frus-
trated by the men
who would have been
called upon to form
a Council had it been
then established. The
Macarthur element
would have proved a
sorry protector and
director of the young
commonwealth. H e
opposed the recom-
mendation, therefore,
and in doing so did
wisely. When the ap-
proval of the Secretary
of State was refused he
wrote :—“I feel great
satisfaction at the de-

termination of his Majesty’s Government
in not acceding to the recommenda-
tion of the Select Committee of the
House of Commons in regard to the
Governor of this colony being as-
sisted by a Council. I indulge a fond
hope that this measure will never be
resorted to in this colony,” This was in
1813. Now, the sincerity and purity of
Macquarie’s motives no honest man will
question. It is clear, therefore, that his
opinion of the people who “were not con-
victs, but who should have been so,” was a
very strong one. It is abundantly clear now,
too, that the objections he foresaw were
afterwards borne out by facts.
Towards the end of Brisbane’s term, how-
ever, a Legislative Council was appointed to
advise the Governor, It first met on August
11, 1824. Purely a nominee and official
Council, it consisted of the Governor;
William Stewart, Lieutenant-Governor ;
Francis Forbes, Chief Justice; Frederick
Goulburn, Colonial Secretary ; John Oxley,
Surveyor-General; James Bowman, Prin-
cipal Colonial Surgeon; and last, but by
no means least, John Macarthur, of Camden,
by this time a territorial magnate and an in-
disputable lord of the soil. Thus the person
whom history presents to us as the wiliest
enemy of the people and the most restless
opponent of every popular advance, was the
first man “ of the people ” chosen to advise a
Governor, one of whose predecessors he had
deposed for interfering with him and his
class ; four of whom, according to his own
boast, he had induced the English Govern-
ment to recall; while each one had de-
nounced him as a turbulent colonist, a mer-
ciless opponent of good government, and an
oppressor of the people. The single-minded
devotion of this able man to one clear and
definite end would, had that end been a good
one, have made him the father of, his
country. As that end was a selfish one, his
evil methods and politically immoral means
did not prevent their issuing in the success-
ful aggrandisement of himself.
The first Act of Parliament passed in
Australia was no weak-minded sentimental
abstraction, commemorative of the dawning
of the legislative function—that highest
exercise of the faculties of man—in a virgin
country. It was simply a measure to make
promissory notes and bills of exchange pay-
able in Spanish dollars available as if they
had been drawn payable in sterling coin of
the realm. This was on 28th September,
1824.
Governor Darling appointed a new Council
on December 20, 1825. Besides Messrs.
Forbes and Goulburn, it included Attorney-
General Saxe-Bannister ; Solicitor-General
John Stephen, father of Sir Alfred Stephen ;
Sheriff Mackaness ; John Carter, Master-in-
Equity ; and D’Arcy Wentworth, Police
Magistrate of Sydney. Archdeacon Scott,
Alexander Macleay, Robert Campbell,
senior, and Charles Throsby, were afterwards
added. Two years later than this, on
January 26, 1827, a public meeting, else-
where referred to in connection with the
agitation for the jury-right, was held in
Sydney to ask for representative rights. A
memorial, signed by 24 emigrant settlers and
emancipists, representing a million sterling,
asked Sheriff Mackaness to call a meeting to
petition the Home Government on the two
subjects named. The meeting is said to
have been the largest held up to that time.
It was convened in the Court-house, and Mr.
Wentworth and Sir John Jamison proposed
and seconded a resolution for the adoption
of the petition. A deputation consisting of the
Sheriff, Mr. Blaxland, and Mr. Wentworth,
waited on Governor Darling to request him
to forward it to the King. Copies were also
sent to Sir James Macintosh and to Sir
Thomas Brisbane for presentation to the
Commons and Lords. It was for tolerating
language “ offensive to Church and State”
at this meeting, that Sheriff Mackaness was
suspended from office, as we have seen, by
Governor Darling. Next year, March, 1828,
a new Legislative Council was appointed,
consisting of the same members as the other,
with the exception of Messrs. Carter, D’Arcy
Wentworth, Stephen, Saxe-Bannister, Mac-
kaness, and Goulburn, who had been suc-
ceeded by Alexander Macleay as Colonial
Secretary ; and with the addition of the
übiquitous John Macarthur. On July 13 of
the following year a Royal Charter arrived,
appointing new Executive and Legislative
Councils. The former consisted of Arch-
deacon Scott, the Colonial Secretary, and
the Commander of the Forces. The Legis-
lative Council included these officials, with
Francis Forbes, Chief Justice; Alexander
Macduff Baxter, Attorney-General; Michael
Cully Cotton, Collector of Customs ; William
Lithgow, Auditor-General ; John Macarthur,
Robert Campbell, Alexander Berry, Richard
Jones, John Blaxland, Captain P. P. King,
and Edward Charles Close—the Governor
presiding. In this Council the Civil Jury
Bill was passed. Archdeacon Broughton
succeeded Archdeacon Scott on his arrival
in September of the same year. This
Council sat through the period of Bourke
and Gipps, up to 1843. The first expression
of local popular opinion on the question of
the Civil List was given by Mr. John Blax-
land in 1834, who entered formal protests
against the amounts of the salaries of the
Colonial Secretary (£2OOO per annum), of
the Archdeacon (£2OOO per annum), and
of the resident at New Zealand (£SOO per
annum). Copies of these protests were sent
to the Secretary of State. In the same year
measures were passed fixing the recoverable
rate of interest at 8 per cent. ; legalising
marriages by Catholic and Presbyterian


ministers ; and appropriating reverted grants
hitherto held by the defunct Church and
School Corporation, to the expenses of
orphanages and to general education. Next
year, besides certain postage regulations and
the establishment of a Criminal Court at
Norfolk Island, a sum of £55,040 was voted
for the maintenance of the police and gaols
of the colony. This was an important step,
and was taken by command of the Home
Government, which devoted the surplus
land revenues of the colony after the
emigration vote had been deducted to
meet this outlay. It is a highly significant
fact that this measnre —the first step towards
making the colonies self-supporting—was
only carried after a strenuous opposition by
the non-official members, by a majority of
seven to six. Only one non-official member
voted with the majority. Three years later,
on June 6, 1838, the proceedings of the
Council were thrown open to the Press and
public for the first time, and from this date
the business of the House was regularly re-
ported in the newspapers.
* *
But the Nominee Council was never in
harmony with the people, as, indeed, it was
never expected to be. As Macquarie fore-
saw, its sympathies were class sympathies
and its legislation was class legislation, except
when a masterful man like Bourke con-
trolled its actions and shamed or forced it
into incidental lapses of liberalism. As
our story has shown, every step of the kind
was bitterly and determinedly opposed. And
with each step gained the popular cause
grew stronger, and its outlook more hope-
ful. On February, 9, 1830, another popular
meeting was held to ask for the jury-right
and a Representative Legislature. Sheriff
M‘Quoid took the chair, and the resolutions
passed were transmitted to Sir James Mac-
intosh and the Marquis of Sligo for presen-
tation, Mr. Stuart Donaldson being asked to
act as agent for the colony. When the news
of the accession of William IV. arrived next
year Mr. Wentworth inserted that amend-
ment in the address quoted in reference to
the jury-right, asking for the general recog-
nition of colonial civil rights. On January,
26, 1833, a public meeting was again held
under the presidency of the Sheriff, at which
a petition was adopted, requesting a Repre-
sentative Assembly to consist of not less than
50 members, which should have the right of
imposing and appropriating its own taxes.
The petition was moved and seconded by
Messrs. Wentworth and Lawson, and unani-
mously carried. On this occasion a paid re-
presentative for the colony was first pro-
posed, it being agreed to memorialise the
Governor for a grant of £lOOO per annum
for a Parliamentary agent, to be chosen
every three years by the landholders and
householders. Two years later the sum of
£l4OO was placed at the disposal of Mr.
Lytton Bulwer for this purpose. At this
meeting, also, Messrs. Bulwer, Robinson,
and Joseph Hume were thanked for their
services to the colony in the British Parlia-
ment. .
*C * *
Many indications showed about this time
that a favourable issue to the popular agita-
tion was at last within measureable distance.
The basis on which the representative insti-
tutions asked for should be formulated now
became an anxious subject for discussion,
but it is humiliating to see how, up to the
very drafting of the present Constitution,
popular ignorance and vested interests split
up the all-important question. A meeting of
the Patriotic Association was held on Decem-
ber 8, 1836, to discuss the form of legislature
and the electoral qualification. Two forms
were discussed, one being for two Houses—
Upper and Lower ; and the second for a
single elective Chamber of 50 members, 10
to be nominated by the Government. Six
years later, in 1841, the Land and Emigra-
tion Commissioners published their first re-
port, and in September of that year a meet-
ing was held, under the presidency of the
high-minded Dr. Bland, to consider the
same.
THE FIRST SYDNEY POLICEMAN.
(From a very, very old Print.)
The result was that the meeting decided
that the Legislature of the colony, as it
at that time existed, had not shown itself
“ either capable or desirous of supplying the
wants or representing the feelings of the
colony.” A petition was thereupon adopted
praying the Queen to give the people a go-
vernment based on popular representation.
The movement was taken up in the country,
and petitions to the same effect generally
adopted. The agitation again gathered way.
Foiled by the influence of an unpatriotic and
selfish class within the colony so far, the
popular demand became more earnest and
more pressing as its temporary leaders—of
whom Dr. Bland deserves most honourable
mention —forced upon the people the con-
viction that the enemies of their cause were
the very persons whose misgovernment
called forth the present protest. This idea,
once taken up, was not allowed to sleep. Six
months after the last meeting another great
gathering was held to press on the request
for Representative Government. The meet-
ing was adjourned, in the midst of a stormy
debate, to a future day at the Sydney Col-
lege, where, on February 16, another peti-
tion was adopted, in which the following
facts were categorically set forth : —That the
colonists were free subjects, forming a popu-
lation of 130,000 ; that their property
amounted to £30,000,000 ; that the annual
increment was £2,500,000 ; that the mari-
time commerce for the years preceding
touched £22,500,000 ; that the annual
revenue raised was £360,000 ; that they had
spent £1,250,000 to relieve the British
Islands of 57,000 of
n their surplus popula-
— i tion; and that, mean-
while, the people had
no control over taxa-
tion or their own pub-
lic business, no repre-
sentation in Parlia-
ment, and almost none
of those free institu-
tions which every
Briton prized.
* * *
But while these pro-
£/ ceedings were going on
in Sydney, the same
jm" subject was occupying
Jilii the attention of the
Imperial Government,
and in July 29, 1842,
the new Constitution
Act was passed by Lord
Stanley, then Secre-
tary of State for the
Colonies, which intro-
duced the principle
fff „ of elective representa-
tion into the legisla-
ture of New South
Wales. The Act was
received in Sydney on
January 5, 1843. It
constituted a new
Council to sit for five
years, and consisting
of 36 members, of
whom 24 were elective,
and 12 to be nominated
by the Governor. Six of
these latter were to be
official members—the Colonial Secretary, Trea-
surer, Auditor-General, Attorney-General,
the Commander of the Forces, and the Collec-
tor of Customs, constituting an irresponsible
Cabinet. The electoral qualification was a
£2OO freehold, or a £2O rental; that for a
member of Council was £2OOO or an income
from real estate of £IOO per annum. Steps
were promptly taken to form the Council,
and the election of two members for Sydney
was made by open voting - f on Hyde Park.
June 13, five members being nominated. A
riot ensued, in which life and property was
destroyed. Messrs. Wentworth and Bland
were elected, Messrs. O’Connell, Cooper,
and Hustler being the rejected candidates.
In July, Governor Gipps was able to in-
form Lord Stanley that the elections were


completed and the House formed. As
nominee members it included, besides the
officials, Messrs. R. Jones, Blaxland, Hamil-
ton, Berry, Icely, and Elwin. The elected
members were Messrs. Wentworth, Bland,
H. H. Macarthur, Bowman, D’Arcy Went-
worth, Lawson, Cooper, Foster, Bradley,
Coghill, Murray, Suttor, Lord, Duraaresq,
R. Windeyer, Macleay, Panton, Therry ; and
for Port Phillip, Lang, Thomson, Nicholson,
Walker, Ebden, and Condell.
* * *
On August 1, 1843, the House was inau-
gurated by Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial
Secretary, and Mr. Macleay, then in his
77th year, was elected Speaker by 17 votes
to 13 over Mr. Hamilton, a Crown nominee.
These numbers show the strength of the old
leaven in the neAv House by no means con-
clusively, as Mr. Macleay was himself an
old official of the Darling period. He was
succeeded by Sir Charles Nicholson as
Speaker on his resignation in 1846. The mea-
sures brought forAvard in the Council claim
attention. Of these Wentworth proposed
three. The fate of the first illustrates a
feature. The Lien on Wool Act was passed
by the Council to enable the pastoralist to
give a mortgage over a forthcoming wool-
clip. It was not confirmed in London, on
the ground that the principle of granting a
mortgage on a growing crop was not recog-
nised by law. The difficulty was overcome
by re-passing the Bill, Avhich, having the
force of law in the colony until its rejection
was announced by the Secretary of State,
gave local pastoralists the temporary benefit
of the measure for the season. The Solvent
Debtors’ Bill and the Usury Bill were re-
jected by the Council. The former was in-
tended to place a legal obstacle in the way
of creditors who wished to rush a debtor’s
estate to a forced sale—a practice by no
means unfamiliar in the past. The latter
measure proposed to fix the rate of interest
recoverable on loans and mortgages at 5 per
cent., to apply to all existing mortgages.
* *
The two proposals directly hit two blots on
our early commercial and business record,
the characters of which have already been
sufficiently explained. They came into
existence under the uncontrolled domination
of the class Avhose power it was hoped to
limit byn partially elective Legislature. But
the result of the very first election held in
the country, certainly under a restricted
franchise, showed that the public spirit Avas
scarcely intelligent enough to discern what
it wanted, or to put forward the proper can-
didates to represent its wants, if knoAvn. It
is not reassuring to note the motiA r es, so
characteristic of the narrow spirit in Avhich
the task of self-government Avas entered on,
which were attributed to the mover of these
measures. It was openly alleged by his
opponents that all Wentworth’s proposals
tended directly to his oavh pecuniary profit.
But whether this Avas so or not matters little.
Another proposal gives us the first in-
stance we can find of the exercise of
the Governor’s power to refuse his assent
to a measure. A committee’s report was
adopted by the Council recommending a*
uniform postage rate of twopence for the
colony. Sir George Gipps vetoed the pro-
posal. He also refused his concurrence to a
vote in favour ,of a National System of
Education. One very important action taken
by the Council was in respect of its attempt
to control without reserve the local public
expenditure. We have seen how one step
had been already conceded in this direction
in 1835. Mr. Richard Windeyer, a man of
liberal sympathies, moved a reduction of the
future Governors’ salaries by £lOO0 —from
£5OOO to £4ooo—and, on the motion being
passed, the Governor informed the House
that his instructions did not allow of his
assenting to its act. At this time the Civil
List reserved from local revenues by the
English authorities amounted to upwards
of £Bl,OOO, and it was held by those who
wished to see the colony self-governed
as far as possible, that such a sum
was disproportioned to a population of
130,856, as shown in the census of 1841.
But it was claimed that even the sum
asked for was too small. The Council was
asked to supplement it in certain par-
ticulars. Some of the members took the
opportunity to question some of the original
items. But here the Governor interfered,
and withdrew the Estimates on the plea that
they were fixed by the Secretary of State,
and were above revision. The additions
were not voted, but the claim to the right of
control on the part of the Council was de-
feated.
* *
This gives the story of the growth of the
Legislature up to the time of Governor
Gipps. It is instructive, as proving that the
interests of the colony, as a general rule,
required protection rather from the first
legislators themselves than from any outside
official power. Some of the Governors were
bad enough in all conscience, and some of
the efforts of Downing-street authority to
control colonial affairs in the Avrong direction
were baneful to the last degree. But the
singular fact about our history is that in
all these instances it was the local
members of Council who suggested
these misdirected efforts of authority, and
who aided and abetted the Governors in the
work they tried to do. The plea on which
the agitators founded their appeal for Re-
sponsible Government "was embodied in this
fact—the fact, as they themselves said, that
the local Legislature had not shown itself
“either capable or desirous of supplying
the wants or representing the feelings of
the colony.” The logical corollary from
this position would have been the
sweeping away, utterly, and root and
branch, of every adjunct of the sys-
tem they objected to, when the moment
came for reform. We will see that this was
not done. The reformers forgot what they
set themselves to reform. They Avere about to
have a chance to do all that Bishop Hinds
recommended. But they neglected to take
the chance when it came.
CHAPTER XNNTTT
The March op Events.
During the period of Governor Gipps’
rule the relations between the public and
the ruling classes the Governor represented
became still more strained. The principal
points of opposition had reference to the
appropriation of large salaries from the re-
venues by the home authorities, amdalso the
fluctuations in the price of land, which rose
and fell at the mere will of the Governor,
i’he whole question of the uses to which
the revenue of the country should be put
also formed a standing subject of public
agitation, and it began to be generally held
that the practice of transportation, which
rendered necessary such enormous outlays
on the police and prison system of the
colony, should be done away with.
Gipps came into collision with public
opinion chiefly over the land, and it is in-
structive to note how the poAver of the popu-
lar agitation was directed from its legitimate
ends by Wentworth and others, to play into
the hands of a class. The price per acre in
1843, when the first elective Council met, was
£l. This caused the most intense dissatis-
faction among those who hoped to get land
at 55., and build up estates to last for all
time. Distress followed on dissatisfaction.
The Bank of Australia failed, live-stock be-
came unsaleable, and the colony was only
saved from financial ruin by the device of a
squatter named O’Brien, of Yass, who began
to slaughter his stock and boil the carcases
down for tallow. In this form they realised
more than the living animal. It Avas at this
unhappy juncture that Gipps proposed to in-
crease the taxation of land, and establish a
number of regulations and restrictions of a
somewhat harassing kind.
The squatters formed an Association for
their protection. The leader was the
notorious Ben Boyd, a gentleman of the
London Stock Exchange, of unlimited credit
and aristocratic connections, who came to
the colony in his own yacht, with the
avowed purpose of acquiring the ownership
of a million sheep and founding a pheno-
menal fortune in Australia. He brought
money to the colony at the period of its
greatest distress, in 1841. For a time he
had everything Lis own way. The squatters
of the colony followed his lead as their own
flocks followed the bell-wether. He knit
them together into an organisation, and de-
vised a number of plans to carry on pastoral
operations with the aid of as few shepherds
as possible, and the employment of no more
than the very minimum of labour. It was
part of his policy to cut the Avages of his
shepherds down to 3s. lOd. per Aveek.
Hitherto these shepherds had been al-
loAved by their masters rations of meat,
flour, tea, and sugar. Boyd proposed to
save the tnvo last items, which he regarded
as unnecessary Avaste and extravagance. In
his evidence before a committee of the Coun-
cil in 1843 he gave it as his opinion that any
more wages than £lO per year only drove
men to the public-houses. He imported a
great number of islanders from the South
Seas, giving them a Scotch cap and a blanket,
and sixpence per head, for their services as
shepherds. But they died off rapidly. He
engaged in Avhaling pursuits, and in nearly
everything else he could turn his active
hands to. But he came to a mysterious end
in some remote island in the South Seas
while aAvay on one of his enterprising
cruises, and the name of Ben Boyd was


heard no more. The squatters' movement
went on badly without him, although Went-
worth threw into the scale in the squatters’
favour all the weight of his influence, ob-
tained as a representative of the interests of
the people of the colony at large.
The matter of immigration also began to
attract attention. Bourke commenced the
custom of devoting a portion of the revenues
of the colony to this purpose. He decided
that the best way to check the preponder-
ance of the convict element and the influence
of the convict-masters, would be to intro-
duce a new leaven of free men and women
by a system of assisted immigration. The
matter was badly managed by the agents in
England, however, who
aimed at securing the r
bounty offered them
at all costs, making
the type of emigrant
sent out an entirely
secondary matter. The
results of this state of
things were of the
most disastrous char-
acter. The streets of
Sydney were soon
flooded by an influx of
friendless females of
good character, and
females whose reputa-
tions were anything
but spotless. In 1840-
41 the total number
of respectable females
who were unable to
obtain employment
counted up to 600.
These women rapidly
fell away into immo-
rality, for which, in-
deed, they were abun-
dantly prepared by
their experience on
board the licentious
immigrantships.
* * *
The name of Caro-
line Chisholm de-
mands mention here.
This philanthropic
lady threw hex-self
nobly into the work
of assisting the friend-
less immigrants, and
rescuing these unfor-
tunates from the
necessity of sleeping
in the parks and gardens of the city rather
than succumb to temptations of their posi-
tion. She established for their reception the
Sydney “Immigrants’ Home.” This insti-
tution began with a store-room 7ft. square,
and the work went on until it developed
into an agency for the supply of servants,
dealing with thousands of cases of otherwise
friendless and homeless immigrants. This
noble lady well earned her title of “The
Immigrants’ Friend.” She instituted pro-
ceedings against the captains of immigrant
ships whose conduct on the voyage had been
particularly atrocious, forced the immigration
officers to introduce some method and order
into their work, and though she had had
little or no money to start with she suc-
ceeded in the space of about four years in
providing for upwards of 11,000 friendless
new-comers who would otherwise have been
thrown on the streets with no means of
subsistence other than their own poor re-
sources.
Sir George Gipps left the colony in July,
1846. His term of rule is remarkable as
witnessing a wonderful measure of increased
activity in the public life of the colony, con-
sequent, no doubt, on the introduction of
the elective principle into the Constitution
of the Legislature. The way was now cleared
for the transportation question, which was
finally dealt with in the term of the next
Governor,
botd’s imported shepherd.
CHAPTER XXXIY.
The Last of the Convict System.
Two months after the arrival of Governor
Fitzroy the Anti-transportation Question was
revived. A despatch on the subject had
been received from Mr. Gladstone, then
Secretary for State, and Mr. Wentworth
moved for and obtained a Select Committee
of the Legislative Council to inquire into
and report upon the renewal of transporta-
tion. The inquiries of a committee framed
in this way could only tend to one result, of
course, and no one was surprised to find,
when the report of the committee was
brought up, that its finding was strongly in
favour of the continuance of the practice.
Mr. Macarthur, following the traditions he
had inherited from his father, distinguished
himself by his earnest advocacy of the
transportation and convict systems. But the
public opinion of the country had already
been formed on this subject. Large popular
meetings were held to protest against the
finding of the committee. At the first of
these, held in the City Theatre, Mr. Charles
Cqwper presided, and moved a resolution
expressing the sense of regret and alarm felt
at the proposal to renew transportation after
it had practically been in abeyance for six ox-
seven years. Tlie Rev. John M‘Encroe, who
was soon to become a prominent leader in this
and the constitutional agitation, also ad-
dressed the meeting,
~1 and a petition was
adopted to which 2000
signatures were ap-
pended. On the last
day of the session,
October 22, 1846, this
document was- pre-
sented to the House,
and no stronger com-
mentary is required on
the unrepresentative
character of that
Chamber than the fact
that the motion for its
being printed was sum-
marily rejected by the
nominee and elected
members.
This action of the
House, and its proro-
gation just after, was
an affront to the pub-
lic meeting which had
drawn up the petition
that could not be
allowed to pass over
in silence. The Report
of the House favour-
ing transportation was
in readiness to be sent
to England, and it was
important that the
document should not
be allowed to tell its
story unquestioned.
An anti-transportation
committee was there-
fore formed, and a
memorial to the Go-
vernor drawn up ask-
ing that officer to send
an official copy of the petition to England
with the Report, and to interest him-
self in the agitation on the side of the
expx-essed will of the people. Sir Charles
Fitzroy promised to forward the peti-
tion, but declined to interfere or to use
any influence in the matter. The partial
success of this move encouraged the oppo-
nents of transportation to organise meetings
throughout the colony, and elicit expressions
of opinion on the subject from all large
centres of population, These began to come
in day by day, declaring unanimouslyagainst
the perpetuation of the convict-system. With
this movement the anti-transportation agita-
tion in its second phase may be said to have
been fairly launched.


Another great popular demonstration took
place in the Victoria Theatre on February
13, 1849, at which the Secretary of State’s
despatch was again considered and con-
demned. Charles Cowper, Robert Lowe
(now Lord Sherbrooke), and Dean M‘Encroe
delivered strong speeches on the subject,
and a petition was adopted stating on the
part of the colonials that ‘ ‘ they felt bound
humbly but firmly to represent to her
Majesty that it was their duty and their
determination, by every legal and consti-
tutional means, to oppose the revival of
transportation in any shape.” A similar
meeting was held in Melbourne on the same
day, and the provincial towns followed the
example thus set. Another popular meeting
took place next month, March 9, at the
Victoria Theatre, the Mayor presiding, and
the same speakers addressed the people.
This increased activity was caused by the
receipt of news that a ship laden with con-
victs for Australia had been detained in port
owing to the accident of cholera having
broken out on board. The circumstance
still more strongly excited the popular mind.
* * *
On June 8, 1849, the last of the convict-
ships arrived in Sydney Harbour. The
Hashemy, a vessel of 936 tons, commanded
by Captain Ross, passed through the Heads
on that day with 212 transported prisoners.
Popular excitement reached its highest
pitch. . A great meeting was convened three
days later at Circular Quay to discuss the
situation, and protest against the action of
Earl Grey and the Colonial Office. About
4000 persons assembled, and the authorities
were so alarmed at the serious manifestation
of public feeling that the guards of Govern-
ment House were doubled and a ship-of-war
then in port was brought up the bay and
ordered to train her guns on the place where
the people’s meeting was held. Mr. Robert
Campbell presided, and among the speakers
were Messrs. Robert Lowe, G. A. Lloyd,
Flood, Lamb, Wilshire, Grant, Peek, and
Fullerton. On this occasion, too, Mr.
Henry Parkes made his first important
public appearance. He was then an obscure
agitator among the herd, with no stake or
interest in the country ; but his amorphous
Democratic sympathies had already made
him known in his own sphere, and he had
become a member of the League, formed, as
we have seen, in 1835. Mr. Lamb moved
a resolution at this meeting in which the
loyal inhabitants of Sydney protested against
the transportation of British criminals to
New South Wales on the grounds that it
was in violation of the will of the majority ;
that many colonists had emigrated on the
faith of the Government that the practice
had for ever ceased ; because the practice
was incompatible with our existence as a
free colony desiring self-government ; be-
cause it was unjust to sacrifice the social and
political interests of the colony at large to
the pecuniary profit of a fraction of the in-
habitants ; and because that act of injustice
would tend to alienate the affections of the
colony from the mother country.
* *
A deputation of six was formed to present
the petition to the Governor. They asked
that the ship in port might be sent back, but
this request was refused. A week later a
meeting adopted a petition praying that Earl
Grey, having forfeited the confidence of the
colonists by his perfidy to the pledge given,
should be removed from her Majesty’s coun-
cils. On Tuesday, June 19, paragraphs in
the Sydney papers informed the public that
the convicts were to be removed from the ship
that day. Forty-five were sent to Moreton
Bay, for hire by the settlers. The men
were not to be employed in the county of
Cumberland. The name of Mr. Lawson was
given as one of the hirers of this last batch
of convict labour. It is remarkable how
strongly the old taint clung to these men.
This man’s name is an easy link between the
early days of grisly horror and the last mani-
festations of the convict-system in New
South Wales. In the course of the same
year the Governor visited Port Phillip, and
the colonists there took the opportunity to
request him to use his influence to preserve
that part of the country from the evils of
the convict-system. A promise was obtained
that any vessels that might arrive at Port
Phillip would be ordered on to Sydney.
Later, but still in the same year, another
despatch on the transportation question was
received, stating that the re-adoption of the
system had been decided on, but limited to
convicts who might be entitled to conditional
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
freedom on their arrival. Next year, 1850,
saw further developments. During its
course transportation ceased to Moreton
Bay (May 12), and commenced to Western
Australia. On September 16 another popu-
lar and uncompromising protest was recorded
by a meeting of 6000 persons on Barrack
Square. The Revs. Archdeacon M‘Encroe,
Ross, Beareer, Boyce, and West, with
Messrs. Lamb, Mort, Bowman, Holden,
Weeks, and Piddington, spoke on the occa-
sion, and the New South Wales Anti-Trans-
portation Association was formed.
* * *
In the meantime some person had dis-
covered, among some Parliamentary papers
sent out to the Sydney Free Library, a
despatch from Governor Fitzroy to Earl
Grey in relation to the great meeting at the
Circular Quay in the previous year. The
Governor described that gathering as one of
the mob alone —-an “assemblage of a few
hundred people of questionable character.”
It went on to say that most of those present
were idlers attracted by curiosity, who took
no part in the proceedings ; while of those
actively concerned there was scarcely one
person who occupied any position of in-
fluence in the community —contentions re-
markably similar to those which have so
often been used in later times by the colo-
nial Tory or “Jingo” party for the purpose
of endeavouring to discredit democratic move-
ments or demonstrations. The publication
of this document revived all the elements of
incipient disaffection. An indignation meet-
ing was at once called, and 4000 persons
adopted a petition to the Queen, in which
the Governor was charged with maligning
the great majority of the colonists, misre-
presenting public facts to his official supe-
riors, and betraying the interests of the
colony. It further set forth the incapacity
of the Governor, and demanded his recall;
expressed the general distrust of Earl Grey,
demanded the revocation of the Order in
Council proclaiming New South Wales a
penal settlement, and asserted that respon-
sible institutions were an absolute requisite
for the safe government of the colony.
* * • *
Mr. John Lamb, a nominee memb tv of
the Legislative body, but whose popular
sympathies on this particular question at
least are sufficiently evidenced by his part in
the agitation, brought the question about
this time under the notice of the Council,
and moved a resolution to the effect that an
address might be presented to the Queen,
asking for the revocation of the obnoxious
Order in Council. The opponents of the
popular will, led by Mr. Wentworth, affected
to misunderstand the demonstrations of
public opinion on the question, and their
majority was sufficient to postpone the
motion for a month to enable the people to
give their desires definite expression. This
was a transparent trick, unworthily resorted
to as a means to gain time to organise the
interest which favoured the continuance of
transportation. But it defeated its own
object and resulted in an occurrence which
put the question out of the region of debate
at once and for ever. The transportation
party collected their strength and prepared a
petition in favour of perpetuating this public
disgrace, in their own selfish interests. They
secured 525 signatures in all to this flagi-
tious document. A popular meeting was
held, and a popular petition prepared. It
bore 36,589 signatures, representative of all
classes in the community but one. It was
presented to the Council. A debate ensued,
which was followed with the keenest interest
throughout Australia wherever an adventur-
ous settler had penetrated or a knot of people
had collected together. This time the
opponents of the popular will and the advo-
cates of one of the direst disgraces to civilisa-
tion of which the world’s history has record,
were about to be outnumbered in the divi-
sion. But they were consistent to the last.
When the question was about to be put they
rose in a body and left the Chamber, while
the remnant of the House carried the Ad-
dress in their absence.
This episode in our history shows us the
old Vested Interest of the colony, which we
have seen form and grow under the most
distressing circumstances of squalor and cor-
ruption, driven from its last ditch as an
organised force openly leading in the strug-


gle between the people and a class. Hence-
forth its members betook themselvestoamore
dangerous and more congenial guerilla war-
fare, shooting their bolts from behind hedges
and blind walls', and bribing the weak, the
ill-informed, and the venal among the popu-
lar party with Greek gifts —crumbs of the
treasure their unpatriotic selfishness in the
past had enabled them to acquire.
* *
The Address thus carried was sent on, and
presented in due course to the Queen. The
responsible advisers of the Crown could not
but acknowledge the legislative rights they
had themselves conferred. There could be
but one result. So far as New South Wales
was concerned it was conceded that the prac-
tice of convict transportation must cease.
The Order in Council was revoked. Yet the
Colonial Office still had nefarious designs on
other parts of the continent. But Australia
was now on the eve of an event which was
destined to completely change the whole face
of this and kindred questions. On February
12, 1851, Edward Hargraves announced his
discovery of gold in New South Wales, and
by that act, in the words of Mr. Wentworth,
“precipitated the colony into a nation.”
The colony was not prepared for its dazzling
apotheosis. Its suddenness took the popular
mind by surprise, and prevented our grasp-
ing the matured fruits of such a golden seed-
sowing of national fortune.
* * *
In January of the same year the agitation
had been carried on with enthusiasm,
gathering strength from the fact that trans-
portation to Van Diemen’s Land was still in
force. At a meeting held it was proposed to
constitute one General League, the members
of which should covenant together to take
every means to discourage and discounten-
ance the practice of convict transportation.
The Anti-Transportation Association was in-
corporated into the General League, and
delegates were sent throughout Australia to
organise public opinion on the subject. The
League described itself as “ bound by every
obligation of duty and affection to protect
the children of the country from the dangers
incident to the transportation of offenders to
these colonies,” and its members “ united in
a solemn appeal to the humanity and justice
of the Sovereign and people of Great
Britain on behalf of the rising genera-
tion.” This is the first recorded public
recognition of the fact that some others
besides the adventurers who had settled in
the country for the fortunes they secured
there, had a claim on the Australia of the
present and of the future —the race, namely,
that was to be born and cradled there. On
February 8, 1851, the petition of the
colonists against transportation was pre-
sented to the House of Commons by Mr.
Molesworth. Five days after that date a
great meeting on the same subject was held
in St. Patrick’s Hall, Melbourne.
* * *
On July 9 a muster of the General League
was called, and a meeting held under the
chairmanship of Mr. Charles Cowper, in
view of an announcement from Earl Grey
that, in order to meet the objections of
colonists, the Moreton Bay district should
be erected into a separate colony, to which
convicts might be sent. The popular Arch-
deacon M'Encroe, with Messrs. Norton,
Wright, Kemp, Holden, Lamb, Campbell,
Josephson, and Parkes were the speakers.
A petition to the Queen was adopted, re-
questing the dismissal of Earl Grey, and ‘ ‘ en-
treating her Majesty to redeem the honour
of the British Crown by fulfilling the pledge
touching transportation, repeatedly given to
the colonists.” Animadverting on the con-
duct of the Minister responsible in the eyes
of the colonists for this breach of faith, the
petition went on to say that ‘ ‘ the petitioners
felt compelled, humbly but firmly, to repre-
sent to her Majesty in person that the sub-
terfuges, equivocations, and breaches of
faith practised towards these colonies by
Earl Grey had unhappily destroyed all confi-
dence in his administration of colonial
affairs.”
On April 2, 1852, one of the most remark-
able of all the demonstrations on this sub-
ject took place in Sydney. By this time the
added influence of the gold discovery began
to make itself felt, and the speeches took a
freer tone. It was thought by many that
the colonies were on the eve of indepen-
dence. One special point in the address
of Archdeacon M‘Encroe, clearly showing
the temper of men’s minds, was thus com-
mented on by the Empire newspaper next
day in a leading article: —“At this numerous,
influential, and earnest meeting, convened
by public announcement in the largest city
in the Australian colonies, where any man
could attend and express his own sentiments
or his dissent from those of any other man—
at this meeting the Secretary of State is
plainly told, for the first time in serious
earnestness, that ‘ the colonists, rather than
surrender their rights in this struggle, will
“ cut the painter ” and drift away from the
mother-country in their frail bark of free-
dom.’ And the venerable Archdeacon, who
spoke these words, was stopped by the
meeting with tremendous -1 cheering. This
‘ cutting of the painter ’ was the master-
thought—the all-pervading idea, running its
electric light through the varied tissues of
every speech, and diffusing its influences
like a moral atmosphere round that congre-
gated body.” The Empire had been started
by Mr. Henry Parkes in 1850, and was con-
tributed to by Robert Lowe, Edward Butler,
James Martin, William Forster, Deniehy,
Mitchell, and others. The new journal
became an intelligent and advanced advo-
cate of Liberalism. No man reading its
columns nearly 40 years ago, with an impos-
sible prescience of the part some of the
members of its contributing staff were to indi-
vidually act in the public life of this country,
would have foreseen the hybrid social condi-
tionsandinconsequentand anomalous political
system which has since been evolved in
Australia under their eccentric guidance.
A cynical person, however, whose allusions
have been corroded by experience, might
look at the matter from another point of
view, and find little difficulty in accounting
for this distressing infidelity to first prin-
ciples on the lines laid down by a certain
sarcastic Spanish proverb.
* * *
Let us finish this chapter with a thumb-
nail sketch of one of the actors in the little
drama we have just gone over. Among the
strangers who haunted the public gallery of
the Legislative Council after 1843 one
obscure figure might have been often seen,
He was tall, this young fellow, and some-
what gaunt ; with hollow features and eyes,
and all the indications of a highly san-
guine temperament. The early legislative
proceedings seemed so have a fascinating
interest for this unnoticed observer, dressed
as a workman, and with the marks of toil
common to his class about him. Fresh from
Birmingham with its crowded fight for life,
he had starved on the streets of Sydney,
sought and obtained hard work as an
immigrant in the colony, and, later on,
A THUMB-NAIL SKETCH.
established himself as a maker of toys in
Hunter-street. When not at work he was
discussing politics among persons of his class,
following a taste he had acquired at Chartist
meetings “at home.” His knowledge of
men and things was acquired in the work-
shops and from his perch in the old Legisla-
tive Council Chamber, and from a dame’s
school at Stoneleigh which he left in his
eleventh year. Now, in 1845, Henry Parkes
is j ust 30 years of age. Fate will capriciously
place within his hands a marvellous oppor-
tunity by-and-bye. And because he has not
been trained to exercise such an opportunity,
he will fatuously throw it away.
CHAPTER XXXV.
The Man Who Was Chained to a Rock.
We have now seen the last of the convict-
system, but, before the subject is finally
closed, it will be well to illustrate what has
been said about its iniquities by one striking
characteristic instance. To tell the whole
story in its naked horror would be impos-
sible, and our purpose in this, as in other
instances, will be served just as well by
selecting one example as a type or standard.
Meantime, it is as well to add that between
the years 1840 and 1845 no less than 17,000
convicts were sent out to Tasmania,


The case we now take is that of a ti’ans-
portee named * Charles Anderson, and his
career will illustrate the working of the old
penal system of the colonies for us before we
close this inquiry into the causes that have
influenced our later development. Nothing
so clearly fixes the impression of the general
character of these early influences than a re-
presentative instance displaying the system
in its working and in its effects. Charles
Anderson was one of the tens of thousands
who fell under the merciless penal laws of
their country, and were sent out to Botany
Bay. His father was a sailor who was
drowned, leaving a wife and two boys, of
whom this individual was one. The mother
died and the two children found their way to
the workhouse, and from that enlightened
and painfully benevolent institution they
were sent to sea. At the age of 9 years
Charles was apprenticed to a collier, served
his term, and then joined a man-of-war. He
was at the battle of Navarino, where he re-
ceived a wound in the head. Now, neither
the collier nor the workhouse were good
schools for getting a clear grasp of socio-
economical questions, and whatever airy
perceptions this good fellow had of these
matters were further considerably knocked
askew by that unkind buffet he got in the
service of the King. Ihe consequence of
this was that when a little excitement or
less rum overset the balance that held him
between right and wrong, he incontinently
toppled over into evil courses. He was
with a party of drunken sailors in a Devon-
shire seaport town one evening, and in the
street row that naturally followed some
shops were broken into. Charles Anderson
was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to
seven years’ transportation to Botany Bay.
The wound received in the service of the
King was of little avail for him on that or
any other occasion.
Charles Anderson was now 18 years of
age. No one said a word in his favour, and
not a step was taken in his behalf. When
he recovered from his semi-lunatic state he
had no recollection of what had taken
place. The judicial proceedings simply dazed
him. He perhaps knew of no crime that
he had committed, and for a lad whose
life had been spent in the workhouse and
at sea the action of the Courts was, likely
enough, an absolute mystery. Before
he realised what was going on he was
at sea again ; not this time wearing the
King’s uniform but the fetters of a convict-
hulk. On his arrival at Sydney, after a
voyage of which the miseries need not be
repeated, he was sent to Goat Island. This
unhallowed spot, which has a history of its
own in the records of convict discipline, was
a place of detention for English or first-con-
victed prisoners. The mental state of Charles
Anderson at this stage is thus described in
an article printed in an English magazine
some years later, “ Doomed to a punish-
ment involving the deepest degradation,”
says this writer, “ for a crime of the com-
mittal of which he was not conscious, the
bitterest hostility against his kind took pos-
session of his breast.” This remark embodies
the experience of every observer of the
system, which embruted the men it was sup-
posed to reform. “ Utterly ignorant both
mentally and morally,” this article goes on
to add, “he had little idea of patient submis-
sion, which, indeed, physical disease ren-
dered impossible. No wonder, then, that
violence created violence. His floggings
were almost innumerable ; but, sturdy and
staunch for good or evil, punishment had no
effect on him. His was no spirit to give
in to harshness, and kindness was never
dreamt of,” Under these conditions, this
man may be regarded as having made a fair
start.
* * *
Goat Island kept Anderson two months,
when he elected to retire. His views re-
specting penal discipline did not at all coin-
cide with those of the humorous individuals
who held sway in Goat Island. He ab-
sconded, therefore, eluded his keepers, and,
braving the sharks that were induced by
judicious feeding to swarm around the
island, swam ashore, arid made his escape.
From this point his real enjoyment of the
situation may be said to commence. He
was caught, taken to the Sydney Barracks,
and presented with 100 lashes for his activity.
Then he was sent back to Goat Island, w r here
the authorities, scorning to be deprived of
the wholesome fun that was justly theirs
by any precipitancy on the part of the people
at the Barracks, generously gave Charles
Anderson 100 more lashes for the same
offence, and in a spirit of philanthropic
reform added a sentence of 12 months in
irons—also for the same offence. During
that 12 months he received exactly 100
lashes a month, being 1200 in all, for
offences which are recorded in the register as
‘‘looking round from his work,” “gazing at
a boat in the river,” and other such atro-
cious outrages. At the end of the 12 months
he shed his irons, and obnoxiously made use
of the first chance opportunity offered to
take his chance among the sharks once more.
He escaped, and, of course, was arrested
again. Remember, the original sentence of
this 18-year-old boy was for seven years.
The Goat Island people acted with splendid
decision this time. It is solemnly recorded
that they first incontinently gave Charles
Anderson 200 lashes for absconding, then had
him tried for the same offence, gave him 100
lashes more, and then sentenced him to be
chained to a rock on the island for two years.
This humorous device was carried out.
“ With barely a rag to cover him, he was
fastened by his waist to the rock with a
chain 26 feet long, and with trumpet-irons
on his legs. A hollow scooped out in the
rock, large enough to admit his body, served
for his bed, and his only shelter was a
wooden lid perforated with holes, which was
placed over him and locked in that position
at night, being removed in the morning.”
Chained up like a recalcitrant chimpanzee in
this way, the unhappy youth was left such
liberty as his 26 feet of linked iron afforded
to feed the aesthetic side of his nature with
uninterrupted news of such matchless
scenery as our beautiful harbour afiprds ;
the other food he required was “pushed”
at him, we are told, on the end of a long
pole. Sometimes one of the other prisoners
would so far close their eyes to the humour
of this novel situation that they would be
led insanely enough to pity their comrade.
One brutalised individual, who had been a
messmate of the Chimpanzee, actually gave
him a piece of tobacco. For this the Good
FEEDING THE CREATURE.
Samaritan received 100 lashes at the hands
of his gaolers, who could not understand
such an abnormal eccentricity of sympathy
towards a fellow-creature.
The humanising effects of the system on
the general public were finely illustrated by
the case of Charles Anderson. The good
people made up little picnics and pleasant
water-parties to see the Chimpanzee. They
regarded him as a wild beast, we are plainly
told, and when they passed in boats would
throw lots of bread and biscuit at him as at
a bear or a real Chimpanzee, to see him bolt
the morsels, or to hear the creature swear.
But we had better let an extract tell the rest
of this part of the disgusting story. This is
what we find in the English magazine we
have referred to : “ Exposed to all weathers,
and without clothing on his back and
shoulders, which were covered with sores
from repeated floggings, the maggots rapidly
engendered in a hot climate feeding upon
his flesh, he was denied even water to bathe
his wounds, such denial being not an infre-
quent portion of the punishment *o which
he had been condemned ; and when rain
fell, or by any other means he could obtain
liquid, he would lie and roll in it in agony.”
On such occasions doubtless the water-parties
would offer extra attractions. No word need
be added to this except to remind the reader
that this took place, not in some remote
convict-pandemonium on a distant station in
the interior, or away on a lonely rock in the
vast Pacific, but on an island in the fairway
of Port Jackson within a stone’s throw
almost of Government House ; and not in
the time of Governor Phillip or of the New
South Wales Corps, but under the rule of
Governor Darling and not much more than
50 years ago !
* * *
When Bourke arrived in the colony and
heard of this horror, he lost no time in
visiting Goat Island and personally enquiring
into the circumstances.He saw the Chim-
panzee and tried to reason with him, offering
to release him if he would promise to go
back to work. But things had gone too far.
Anderson refused to work, for he said that
“ if he worked he would be punished and if


he did not work he would be punished the
same.” Bourke released him, however, and
sent him to work at Port Macquarie away
from the Goat Island associations. Here
the gaolers devised new tortures. He was
put to work carrying lime in baskets on his
back from the kilns to some Government
barges lying off the settlement. His over-
seer, Anthony, threatened that the lime
and salt water should burn the flesh off
his back, “and in effect,” we learn, “it
did burn off the skin, causing excruciating
agony.” Anderson demurred, and accepted
an early opportunity that presented itself to
run fleetly away from the uncongenial
society of Mr. Anthony. He travelled
several hundred miles on foot, suffering cruel
hardships that were endurable to him since
they did not come from his fellow-creatures.
He joined some aboriginal tribe, who were
pursued by the police for having attacked
and killed some settlers. These police cap-
tured Anderson and sent him back to Port
Macquarie, where Anthony gave him 200
lashes and returned him to his labour gang.
But the monotony of these proceedings
became simply fatiguing, and eventually
palled on Anderson. He lost all interest in
Mr. Anthony’s personal welfare, and when a
fellow-convict invited him to kill the over-
seer, Anderson accepted the invitation with
effusion. He was tired of life, he said—and
no wonder ; he said “ he would do the deed,
and be hanged for it.” So on a pleasant
morning, when the sun was bright on the
sleeping water, he smote Mr. Anthony on
the ear with a spade, and that excellent man
expired. The soldiers spitted Anderson
with their bayonets, and when he was taken
to the hospital he was found to be wounded
in five places. He was cured, tried in Syd-
ney, sentenced to death, but, some meddle-
some fellow having most inopportunely made
some remark about the case and its circum-
stances, the man was snatched from the
gallows and sent to work in chains on Nor-
folk Island for the term of his natural life.
Here we lose sight of him, but only for a
time. His record shows that during his
residence at Norfolk Island he still con
tinued to furnish encouraging results to the
working of the system, insomuch that this
Charles Anderson may be regarded as one
of the best representative types the opera-
tion of the penal laws affords.
* *
Captain Maconochie was the next person
to interest himself in Anderson, and on his
arrival to take charge of Norfolk Island he
found his record to be 10 convictions for
violent assault, three times scheming to
avoid labour, and many charges of insolence
and insubordination. Anderson was at this
time 24 years of age, but, adds the record
significantly, he looked 40. He was now a
desperate character, had been so for some
time, in fact. According to official appraisal
he was just the kind of convict for which
Norfolk Island was established—that is, the
utterly reprobate and hopelessly beyond
reform. The justification for the existence
of that island of horror was the phenomenon-
ally bad character of the people found
there, but the story of Anderson and of
hundreds like him shows that these outcasts
were regularly and systematically developed
by the convict-system, and cultivated up to
the phenomenal pitch of rascality which was
the effect of the system and not its reason or
cause. When Captain Maconochie arrived
he was told Anderson w was “ cranky,” and
his fellow-prisoners amused themselves,
after the manner of their gaolers towards
themselves, by teasing him and making him
vicious. This was stopped, and Maconochie
took the case in hand. There were some
wild bullocks running about the island, and
Anderson was placed in charge of these. He
went by the nickname of “ Bony ’’now, and
a good many people thought mad Bony and
his wild bullocks would come to grief. No
one was allowed to interfere with him, how-
ever, and soon a marked change made itself
apparent in the man.
“He became less wild,” we read, “felt
himself of some value, and won praise for
his good conduct and successful management
of his bullocks. He and they grew tractable
together.” But what a contrast between
this poor wretch’s treatment of his bullocks
and his own treatment by his gaolers!
Maconochie had heard of his being chained
to the rock on Goat Island before he saw
Anderson at all, and he humanely resolved
to do his best to give him his chance among
the rest of humanity ; there were occasionally
exceptions among the gaolers of the convict-
system. He watched his lunatic herdsman,
and ‘ ‘ often were the anxious watchers
of the experiment amused by the first
insight into criminal discipline which Ander-
son displayed in the treatment of his
charge.” The watchers were “amused” ;but
the experiences of the herdsman that taught
him what he knew were probably not of an
amusing character. No more blasting cen-
sure could be passed on the system than the
story of this benighted and God-forsaken
creature, thus turned from an honest sailor-
lad, who had, in his own ignorant way,
served his country under fire, to this mad
herdsman on this faraway abode of despair.
The experiment went on successfully, how-
ever, and it was observed 'that he and the
bullocks seemed to understand each other,
and that ‘‘ he knew instinctively that high
and strong tempers will not bend to the
lash.” Constant occupation strengthened
and steadied his mind again, and as he im-
proved the old longing for something of his
sailor-life came back to him.
Captain Maconochie found that his physi-
cal liability to excitement continued, end he
was afraid to let him mix with his fellows.
His constitution, too, was so shattered as to
unfit him for heavy work. It occurred to
Maconochie to erect a signal-station on
Mount Pitt, the highest point of the island,
and place Anderson in charge. His delight
was extreme, for he now felt himself a man
again, and, dressed in his sailor’s costume,
he soon regained the bearing of a man-of-
war’s man. The top of Mount Pitt was
cleared, a hut built, and a staff with a com-
plete code of signals provided. Anderson
got a little patch of garden-ground to till
and keep in order, he grew the best potatoes
on the island, and every giver of a new flower
was a benefactor. He showed his gratitude
to Captain Machonochie by bringing every
day a fresh basketful of potatoes for the use
of his dinner-table, and the signals was so
well attended that the settlement at once
knew if a sail was in sight.
* * *
There is a story that Sir George Gipps
visited Norfolk Island about three years
after Maconochie arrived, and while
driving one day Anderson was seen tripping
along in his trim sailor dress, full of im-
portance, with his telescope under his arm.
“What smart little fellow may that be 1 ?”
said Gipps. “ Who do you suppose 1 That
is the man who was chained to the rock in
Sydney Harbour,” came the reply. “ Bless
my soul, you don’t mean to say so !” was
the Governor’s astonished rejoinder.
* * *
We will let an extract tell the rest of this
story of Charles Anderson, leaving the
reader to look for himself behind the curtain
which in this perfectly-authentic biographi-
cal sketch we have drawn aside for a moment
THE MAN WHO WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK.
from the vision of horror it covers up and
conceals. From this and other instances
we have given the reader may judge of the
whole system, and this story of one-man’s
life is not told with any sensational object,
but with the view to point a political moral
that has a direct interest for every voting
unit of the 1 population. The days of the
convict-system have gone. But our institu-
tions are branded deep with the old mark,
and the story of the past is the explanation
of the present and the key and guide to
popular action in the future. The extract
which follows tells us the last we know of
this victim of British laws that were highly
approved of in their day, but which have
been partially reformed in the flight of De-
mocratic progress, just as the anomalies of
the present will disappear one by one before
the intelligence of the future.
* * *
“ As he regained his self-respect Anderson
revealed a noble, generous heart, and a gay
and sociable disposition ; but his excitability
eventually became madness, and not long
after the benefactor who had restored him
and hundreds like him to the feelings and
duties of humanity was peremptorily recalled
from the scene of his philanthropic labours
Anderson was seen in a lunatic asylum by
one whom he had known as a friend of the
captain in Norfolk Island, The poor fellow


recognised his visitor and spoke of nothing
but Captain Maconochie and his family.”
Here his story finishes, and no blacker con-
demnation of the unspeakable Convict-
System and its agents at Botany Bay could
be imagined or found.
CHAPTER XXXYI
The Island oe Horror,
It is impossible to tell the story of Norfolk
Island. No writer would dare to put in
words one tithe of the record of that unex-
ampled hell upon earth. Such was the tiger-
like ferocity of the gaolers, on the one hand,
and of their caged victims on the other—
such the bestiality and savagery that ruled,
the cruelty, the misery, and the unspeakable
horror of that accursed plague-spot in the
Pacific, that the task would be easier to
describe an island of lepers than that
civilised and enlightened moral experiment.
No one has yet ventured to tell the truth,
the whole truth, about Norfolk Island, and
probably no one ever will. Marcus Clarke,
in his tale, has given a glimpse of what went
on there; but, even for the purposes of
realistic fiction, the material that island has
to supply is too brutal and too revolting for
the most courageous realist to use. This
inquiry into the origin of our social and
political system necessitates some historical
mention of Norfolk Island, but we will not
linger on the unsavou™ T subject.
* * *
We have already described how Lieutenant
King founded the settlement at Norfolk
Island in March, 1788, and was relieved by
Major Ross two years later. The veryfirstlines
of the island’s story, like that of Botany Bay
proper, are written in blood, for, under
Major Ross, it will be remembered, men
and women alike who would not work were
44 adjudged to suffer death.” Towards the
end of the following year King resumed the
chief-gaolership, and in 1800 Major Foveaux
went there as Lieutenant-Governor of the
island. This worthy was one of the officers
of the infamous New South Wales Corps,
and under him the place really began to
produce its most refreshing results. There
is some information on this subject in certain
papers placed at the writer’s disposal, from
which we gather, amongst other things, that
Norfolk Island was already regarded as 44 the
dwelling place of devils in human shape, the
refuse of Botany Bay, the doubly-damned,
and a place of horrid banishment and cruel
treatment.”
* * *
Major Foveaux was the undisputed despot
of the place. He began by taking a fancy
to the wife of one of his non-commissioned
officers. Sergeant Sherwin did not'fall into
his Major’s domestic plans very readily at
first, and hesitated about handing his wife
over. But Major Foveaux locked the Ser-
geant up for this insubordination, at the
same time confiscating his wife. Under this
gentle suasion the Sergeant was brought to
a proper frame of mind, and induced to
think it better to save his life and lose his
wife than to lose both. 4 4 He was wise
enough,” we are told, 44 to perceive that it
is very foolish to quarrel with the judge
•yvhere there is no jury, for no man will givn
a verdict against himself.” So Ann Sherwin
remained with the Major, and the Sergeant
left the island as soon as he could shake
the dust off his feet, showing his sense of
the trouble that had been taken to impress
his mind with moral views by marrying
another wife soon after. It is an ill wind
that blows nobody good, however ; and Ann
Sherwin seems to have been a woman with
an honest womanly heart, strangely out of
place as it was among her surroundings.
She acquired an influence over the ‘ ‘ tigerly
Majpr,” and she was always ready to use it
on the side of the oppressed. Many thou-
sands of lashes were diverted from intended
victims by her interference, it is said, and
the prayers of men who never prayed before
were made for this gaoler’s mistress. But
in Norfolk Island little regard was ever paid
to the morality of women or the lives of
men. Governor King introduced a system
which did away at once with any conven-
tional prejudices. He sold convict-women
to the highest bidder. This is what we are
told of him : 44 Governor King’s proceedings
respecting the poor convict women on their
arrival in the colony was abominable. They
were disposed of by Potter, the bellman, as
so much live-stock. I have seen them after-
wards sold, some of them for a gallon of
rum, others for £5, and so on ; and thus
they were transferred from one brutal fel-
low to another, without remedy or appeal.”
How the convict lived in those days on the
island will not bear detailed description to
anyone who cares to preserve any remnant
of his original faith in human nature. But
the order of the day’s proceedings was some-
thing like this : The convicts were locked
up all night together in compartments, where
their berths were hung one above another
with the one object of crowding as many
men into a given space as possible. Two
hours before daylight in winter these
wretches were called out ; each one then
tied up his bed and carried it out into the
yard where it lay all day in the rain or sun
as chance ruled. Convicts were then paraded
before the head gaoler’s door, and the
gangs would then be taken out by over-
seers, and each man apportioned his
work. Some of them would work
hard to save some time in which they
might work for themselves to earn some pro-
visions, as five pounds of flour per week was
the maximum allowed them. It was a
pleasant diversion to the overseers to watch
for industrious people of this class in their
g uigs, and send them to work in the surf as
soon as they were done their task. There
they usually remained till 10 o’clock at
night, being without food all day. 44 I have
myself with them experienced this treat-
ment,” says one of them, 4 4 and have been
sent back to gaol with the gang wet from
head to foot, in which condition we have
been turned in and reckoned like a flock of
sheep, without time being allowed us to pre-
pare our food. The next morning, when
the bell rang at 5 o’clock, the order for
every one to get up was given in these
words; 4 Get up, you damned souls!’ We
had then to look for our wet rags ; and if
the slightest grumbling escaped the lips of
anvonf the order was 4 To the triangle ! ’
where the flogger was ready to give the un-
fortunate -wretch 25 lashes, after receiving
which he had to go back to his work as
usual. I ask,” continues this victim of what
he describes, ‘ ‘ whether hanging or shooting,
which puts a man out of his misery at once,
is not infinitely preferable to this kind of
treatment 1 ”
The case is given of a young man, an
Irish political prisoner, who was compelled
to walk about and work with a chain weigh-
ing 12 pounds on his legs, and while suffer-
ing from dysentery was driven into the
sea to carry packages ashore from the
boats. He became too weak to work,
and had his irons knocked off when too
late, for he died soon "after. There was
really only one check on the irresponsible
cruelty of the gaolers, and that lay in their
sense of the fact that a convict could at any
moment escape from their gangs and revenge
himself at the same time by knocking them
on the head. This was very often done, and
the. wild justice of revenge was very fre-
quently invoked by some overwrought victim
of the system, as we have already seen. 44 If
1 could have bought or borrowed a pistol,”
wrote one of these convicts afterwards, ‘ ‘ the
world, I think, would soon have been rid of
this man-killer, Foveaux ; for, why should
any man, with the means of placing himself
on equal terms, and exchanging life for life
without the endurance on his part of pro-
tracted misery, allow himself to be murdered
by a lingering death, and see his murderer
rejoicing before him ?” This most natural
question doubtless suggested itself more or
less definitely many thousands of times to
the victims of the convict-system, and the
wonder is that the impulse was not acted on
more frequently. “ There are cases in which
a man who shudders at the idea of murder
may be obliged to become an assassin in self-
defence,” continues this embryotic cut-
throat, reflectively ; 4 4 and did not tyrants
feel and tremble at this power which an act
of self-sacrifice can accomplish, there would
be, I believe, more despotism and injustice
in the world than already exists.” This
convict-philosopher has not had his con-
fidence in his fellowmen increased by his
observations, but there is a merciless truth
about his logic that must commend itself to
everyone who feels the slightest spark of the
fine fire of assassination in his soul.
Foveaux’s best achievement was a little
Sabbath observance he went through one
Sunday. Of course there was no limit to
the Governor’s power to hang or shoot any
of his happy family when he felt so disposed,
but sometimes the fancy seized him at un-
conscionable times. It is quite easy to
understand that his duties in Norfolk Island
sometimes palled on the Major, and a little
stimulating excitement on such occasions
would be like the morsel of Gruyere that
brings out the real flavour qf your wine. So
one Sunday Foveaux took two men out of
church, where they sat listening to the par-
son’s prayers, put them in a cell, and two
hours later hanged them without trial, and
without wearying them with any idle ex-
planation of his freak. The charge was the
usual one of conspiring to mutiny, but pro-
bably the Major had found the parson’s prayer
slow or his sermon dull. It is unfair to criticise


the Major’s action without being acquainted
with his motives. Yet this is what some
good people had the excessively bad taste to
do, and Foveaux was actually recalled to
explain his conduct in hanging these two
men. His disgust at the worry about such
a trifle was extreme, as if no one had ever
been shot or hanged or flogged to death
before. But justice held her unrelenting
sway. In the absence of prosecutor, plaintiff,
evidence, or public opinion, Major Foveaux
was acquitted without a stain on his soul or
a blot on his character. The order of St.
Michael and George had not been devised as a
reward for colonial merit in those benighted
days, but the Major was made a Lieutenant-
Colonel, and allowed to return to the
colony.
* * *
This kind of thing continued until 1805,
when the island was evacuated and the
settlers sent to Yan Diemen’s Land, where
they settled on Norfolk Plains, named after
the island they left. The prisoners went
with them. It was not until August 15,
1826, that Norfolk Island was again pro-
claimed a place, of detention for convicts re-
convicted in New South Wales. At this
point its history re-coramences, and from
that time until the convict-system was finally
broken up, the saturnalia of crimes against
humanity went on again. In 1834, Judge
Burton, who once wrote an absurd book on the
“ State of Religion and Education in New
South Wales” (and who died in England in
August, 1888, aged 93) went there to hold a ses-
sion of las Court for the trial of some convicts
who had made an ineffectual attempt at revolt,
and what he elicited at that trial and pub-
lished thereupon in his ridiculous book shows
what progress had been made in the island
of horror during the ten years since it was
re-opened as a convict settlement. At this
trial 87 witnesses were examined, and, in
the words of the Judge who tried the case,
their evidence ‘ ‘ revealed to the Court such a
picture of depravity, as it may be assumed
no human Judge ever had revealed to him
before.” Most of the evidence against the
prisoners was given by convict informers,
and these people were cross-examined by the
prisoners with a view to rendering their tes-
timony valueless by demonstrating the
characters of the men who gave it. This
brought out a mass of appalling facts
relating to the state of affairs on the island.
Herded together like pigs as they were, and
with all the hopes and feelings of men
crushed out of them, these disclosures re-
vealed a condition of things to which the
state of pigs was preferable. Thirty of the
prisoners were sentenced to death, and it is
recorded that some of these men showed
signs of capacity and education, and some
had wives and families belonging to them in
the outer world from which they had been
cut off.
* * *
When these 30 men were sentenced to
death, and their last hope was taken from
them, the judge tells us that they “com-
pleted the abominable revelation by com-
menting to the judge, in earnest, deep, but
calm expostulation, on the crimes committed
there.” It was so long since these derelict
wretches had seen the slightest human in-
terest exhibited in their miseries that they
absolutely luxuriated in such attention as a
judge may give in sentencing a prisoner.
“ One of them,” says Judge Burton, “ a man
who displayed singular ability, and uncom-
mon calmness and self-possession under cir-
cumstances so appalling to ordinary minds,
represented the place to be hell on earth
‘‘and most assuredly it was,” adds the
judge, “so far as the torments of that
Region are made up of the company of Evil
Spirits glorying in Evil Deeds.” And really
to read these dreadful disclosures suggests
nothing so much as the imaginary tortures
described as appertaining to the mediaeval
hell. “ Let a man’s heart be what it will,”
said the same prisoner on the same occasion,
“ when he comes here his Man’s heart is
taken from him and there is given to him
the heart of the Beast!”—words which might
as fittingly have been written over the gates
of all those old convict settlements as Dante’s
despairing words over the portals of the
Inferno.
* * v *
The mind refuses to dwell on this subject.
It is hard to believe for the credit of human
nature that such things as we know to have
taken place at Norfolk Island, should ever
have been. But the testimony of facts is so
strong, and the facts themselves are so re-
cent, that no room is left for doubt, and the
inevitable must be perforce accepted. Judge
Burton was struck with horror at what he
heard and saw there. His description of
what he saw on visiting the gaols where the
convicts were hived one above the other in
tiers of hammocks, or chained in rows to
beams running down the centre of the
apartment, is suggestive of nothing more
than some of those efforts of horror of the
Florentine who drew from his lurid imagina-
tion those pictures of the Malebolge pool.
Burton described the island, in his quaint,
old-fashioned way, as “a cage full of unclean
birds, full of Crimes against God and Man,
Murders and Blasphemies, and all Unclean-
ness.”
* * *
When Dr. Ullathorne visited the Island
to prepare some of the condemned men for
the death that awaited them, he went into
the crowded cell to announce his mission
and read the names of those who were finally
adjudged to die. No scene in the whole
history of the convict-times is more appalling
than the one that good man describes as
taking place in that miserable abode on that
occasion. One by one the condemned men
fell on their knees as their names were read
out for death, and deliberately and calmly
thanked God that the gallows was about to
deliver them from that horrible and unspeak-
able place. What a subject for an historical
picture by some Australian artist of the
future, when men’s minds are free to feel
a natural horror at these triumphs of civilisa-
tion and law !
Such was the horror that the name of
Norfolk Island inspired in the minds of the
most desperate convicts that many stories
are told of attempts to escape from the ves-
sels that took them down to the island. In
1827 a serious outbreak occurred in the
settlement, and 50 escaped to Phillip Island,
seven miles away, but were either killed or
re-captured by the governor of Norfolk
Island, who took their place of refuge by
assault. A brig was seized and taken
away by prisoners in 1827. In 1842 the
convicts rose on the island and captured the
Governor Phillip, which carried supplies.
The convict boat s crew who were employed
between the vessel and the shore disarmed
the sentry at a pre-concerted signal, forced
some of the vessel’s crew to jump overboard,
and secured the captain, mate, and soldiers
below deck. The captain and mate managed
to break through a partition, joined with the
soldiers, and fired with effect through the
crevices at the convicts. They then rushed
on deck, engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle,
and soon re-captured the vessel after five
convicts had beenkilled and two wounded, and
one soldier killed and five wounded. Four
convicts were hanged for their share in this
affair. The notorious Knatchbull, the
“ Jamieson-street murderer,” was also con-
cerned in a mutiny on the way to the settle-
ment. From the first day that Norfolk
Island was set apart as a penal station until
the convicts were finally removed, that
accursed spot in the wide Pacific held its
wretches who were marooned there in a
state of torment as fierce as Tophet and as
hopeless as hell.
CHAPTER XXXYII.
Yandemonia.
Yan Diemen’s Land is as infamous for
old-time horrors as any other part of Aus-
tralia, even including Norfolk Island. The
pretty little southern colony seemed destined
by nature to be a garden and beauty-spot
for the continent, but its first rulers turned
it into an abode of despair and misery, and
of men who were worse than fiends. “ Van-
demonia ” was the sinister name it became
known by in those old days, and no better
step could have been taken when its people
had shuffled off its convict coil than to change
its ill-omened name to Tasmania.
The first convicts were taken to Van
Diemen’s Land by Lieutenant Bowen in
1803. He brought with him a surgeon and
ten male and six female prisoners. Next
year came Collins, who abandoned an attempt
to found a convict-settlement on the shores
of Port Phillip, and discharged his convicts
at the head of Sullivan’s Cove, now Hobart,
on January 30, 1804. From that date thig
spot was the scene of the usual sights and
sounds of the convict system, which has
already been described in sufficient detail.
It is here and at Port Arthur and Macquarie
Harbour that Marcus Clarke lays the scene
of the earlier chapters of his novel, “ For
the Term of his Natural Life. ” It is possible
that some of the stories that are told
about these places surpass in their
cold-blooded horror anything that is re-
corded of any other part of the convict
settlements. A return of the sentences at
Macquarie Harbour, during the five years
between 1822 and 1826, shows that while
the roll of convicts never reached 300 there,
and in one year was less than 200, the total
number of lashes administered was upwards
of 33,000.


There was a small rock off the settlement settlement. The ceremony produced a feel- three living comrades. Among the papers

We wonder every now and then that our

the spirit of officialism is so strong, and
that public opinion is so weak—and these
papers are intended to give the answer.
Take any one single instance of what we
refer to, and trace it back from precedent to
precedent in the history of our criminal law
or public policy, and we venture to say that
in every one single instance the origin of
what we are ashamed of will be found in the
state of things which, in these representative
instances that have been quoted, have been
indicated rather than described.
CHAPTER XXXYIII.
The End of the Story.
This history of Botany Bay reaches its
last episode in the granting of Responsible
Government in 1856 The reader has seen
how the settlement developed from stage to
stage in the earlier chapters of this story,
and he may now be said to be thoroughly
acquainted with the people, the officials, and
the system of these early days. In the time
of Bourke we saw the beginning of the
changes, and later on the break-up of the
convict-system and the cessation of transpor-
tation. Then came the gold discovery, and
with it the influx of new population made up
of men and women who had not been
broken in to the convict-system and the
spirit of gaoler-officialism, on the one hand, and
to that tone of cringing subservience on the
other which it necessarily engendered. New
blood came into the country at the rate of
90,000 arrivals per annum, and all this time
the convict element was at first gradually and
then rapidly dying out. It was practically a
new people that won the fight against the old
conditions which they had no act or part in
producing, and which they were determined
not to tolerate.
It is interesting to observe how the pro-
cess of development went on from this point.
The new people were not satisfied with the
social conditions of the colony as they found
them, but they had not, at the same time,
any definite conception of that which
was to take their place. There was no
Adams or Jefferson among them to re-
enact the splendid historical role played
by these great men of bold and original mind
in the old American colonies. The half
emancipated immigrants who began to fill
the towns of the colony had no one to open
their minds to a conception such as that
embodied in the opening lines of the
American declaration of independence, which
sets forth the equality of men and their
equal rights to equal chances in the battle of
life. On the contrary, the designers of the
feeble patchwork of the Colonial Constitution
were blinded by their early training and
traditions, and had not yet forgotten to pull
the forelock to the squire, or cringe to the
colonial imitator whom they found ready
here to take his place. They embodied their
timid spirit in their Constitution, and with it
all those feudal traditions which the framers
of the American Constitution, in a wise
spirit of philosophic statesmanship, lost no
time in lopping off at the roots.
* * *
Mr. Wentworth is usually credited with
the authorship of the Constitution of New
South Wales, on which that of the other
colonies is modelled. But this is only half
true. A great deal that he advocated was
too much even for the amorphous popular
intelligence as it then existed, and his pro-
posals were very seriously altered before they
became the letter of the Constitution. At
the same time it is to be observed that if
Mr. Wentworth had exercised his great
force of character and influence in the right
direction—if he had been a man of original
philosophic mind, capable of grappling with
the problems to be presented in the history
of a young country, he might have given the
colonies constitutions of a much broader and
more liberal caste than those which are
usually credited to his origination.
* * *
The events relating immediately to the
granting of the Constitution and Responsible
Government date from 1851. In that year
Mr. Wentworth, in his place in the Council,
moved a resolution that the House was pre-
pared to grant a Civil List to the Queen, on
condition of receiving responsible control of
the lands and revenue of the country. Some
months later a minute was entered on the
Proceedings, setting forth the sense of the
House that the Imperial Parliament should
not have the power to impose colonial taxes,
and that the public lands and revenues,
official appointments, amd legislative powers
should be at the command of the colonial
authorities, and not at that of the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, In 1852 a com-
mittee was appointed to draft a Constitution
for the colony. It consisted of Messrs.
Wentworth, Donaldson, Deas-Thomson (then
Colonial Secretary), Attorney-General Plun-
kett, J. Macarthur, Cowper, Lamb, Martin,
Murray, and Dr. Douglas. In September of
the same year two Bills were laid on the
table of the House—to confer a Constitution
on the colony, and to grant a Civil List to
the Queen.
* * *
Next year saw considerable progress. Sir
John Pakington, then Secretary of State for
the Colonies, transmitted an official despatch
to the Governor, announcing that it had
been decided, on the representation of the
Council, that the revenue and taxation
should be entrusted to the local legislature,
that transportation to Tasmania should cease
forthwith, and that a Parliament should be
called together in New South Wales on the
basis of an elective Assembly and a nominee
Council. The Governor reported the de-
spatch to the Council, which at once ap-
pointed a committee to draw up a Constitu-
tion. The members of this committee were
ballotted for, and Messrs. Wentworth, Deas-
Thomson, Macarthur, Plunkett, Cowper,
Martin, Donaldson, Macleay, Thurlow, and
Murray were chosen. Mr. Wentworth was
elected chairman of this Constitution Com-
mittee, from the proceedings of which the
present Constitution was evolved. When
Mr. Wentworth brought up his report it was
found that the framers so utterly miscon-
ceived their office and the desires of the
people, as to advocate the creation of a peer-
age for members of the Upper House, with
hereditary titles. This was a scheme worthy
of the time of the Norman Conquest, or of a
gang South Sea Island freebooters, and
it was received on the part of the public
with all the contempt it deserved. Unspeak-
able ridicule was poured out on the devoted
heads of the Baron of Woolloomooloo and
the Duke of Yaucluse, as the ambitious
creatures who devised this notable project
were called.
Public meetings took the matter up and
began to discuss this peerage question with
a good deal of acrimony. An advertisement
was issued to the public calling attention to
the proposed creation of Botany Bay peers
out of the representatives of the old New
South Wales Corps and the officialdom of
the convict-system. The formation of an
Upper House in which the people would
have no voice was condemned, and a protest
entered against the plot “ to fix irrevocably on
the people this oligarchy in the name of free
institutions, so that no future Legislature
can reform it even by an absolute majority.”
A great meeting was called at the Royal
Hotel in George-street, Sydney, in August,
1853, to express the popular mind on this
subject. Messrs. John Bayley Darvall,
Johnson, Henry Parkes, Mort, Deniehy,
M‘Encroe, Piddington, Flood, and others
addressed the gathering and spoke up man-
fully against the mushroom peerage pro-
posals. It was decided by the meeting that
the Bill was radically defective, and the
populace bound themselves to oppose every
attempt to foist a Constitution on the colony
so distinctly inimical to the wishes and
interests of the people.
* * *
The Constitution Committee, however,
went on with their measure. Mr. Went-
worth proposed the second reading of the
Constitution Bill in its objectionable form,
and after a debate of seven days its adoption
was carried by a majority of 34 votes to 8.
This action of the Legislative Council showed
the public that their interests were not safe
in the hands of its members, and the fact
excited them to still stronger measures
of agitation. A great gathering took place
at the Circular Quay to petition the Queen
against the Constitution Bill, and the attempt
of the old leaven to wreck the prospects of
free institutions just as they seemed to be at
the point of realisation. The People’s Con-
stitution Committee was here declared in
permanent session to take steps to protect
the popular rights from the Committee of
the Council. The peerage proposals were
withdrawn, and when the House was moved
into Committee on December 6, to consider
the Bill, the other clause conferring life-
membership on the existing Government
was dropped in deference to these mani-
festations, and the third reading passed by
27 votes to 6 on December 21, 1853, amid a
great demonstration of applause from the
members of the Legislative Council. The
Constitution created two Houses, the Assem-
bly to sit for five years and the Council for
life. Messrs. Wentworth and Deas-Thomson
were sent to England to pilot the measure
through the British Parliament, and on its
final passing there and receiving the warranty
of the Royal Assent, returned with the news


to New South Wales. Immediate steps were
now taken for the election of the first Parlia-
ment, and all the business was completed
and the elections over by May, 1856. On
the 22nd of that month the first popular
Parliament sat in the old Council Chambers
in Macquarie-street, Sydney, for the first
time.
There is no necessity to pursue this record
any further. We have now seen the latest
stages in the development of the political
institutions of the colony, and the circum-
stances show exactly the same conflict of
vested interests and old-time traditions
against the popular sentiment that every
stage in the colony’s history has exhibited.
Manhood suffrage came later, and it may
now be said that, with this and the free in-
stitutions we possess, the political future of
the Australian system is in the hands of the
people themselves.
It may be so. It may be that for what we
have we must blame or praise ourselves —
that the power for good or evil is in the
people’s hands, and that they can do what-
ever they will. But if the reader who has
followed the progress of the story we have
undertaken to here set down without exag-
geration or extenuation, will compare the
things of to-day with the occurrences
of the time antecedent to forty or
fifty years ago, he will not fail to
note the distinct survival of some of the
worst features of the worst period of Botany
Bay. They have been veneered over and
hidden from ready view by the change of
manners and the lapse of years, but the
essentials of our criminal law, the official
mind, and the spirit of our political action
and outlook are much the same. Our
criminal law, we are often told, is more
bloody and brutal than any other on the
face of God’s earth to-day. Every death-
sentence recorded in our courts of law shows
that the gallows is only reft of its victim
after the most violent and strained relations
between the popular sentiment and the
official mind, if the lunatic criminal or the
practically irresponsible boy is ever rescued
from the grip of the hangman at all. The
lash and the flogging laws are still in active
operation in the Australasian colonies, and
the penal system is still to all intents and
purposes as powerless for reform as ever it
was in the instances we have individualised
in the pages that have gone before.
The official mind is the last refuge and
resting-place of what remains of the past.
When Dr. Whately and his fellow-workers
spoke against the convict-system fifty years
ago, as we quoted those earnest and
thoughtful men some chapters back, they
recommended the break-up of the convict-
system as the least of the steps to be taken
to eradicate the evils it had caused. They
were still more earnest in advocating the
removal of the centre of settlement from the
scenes of early misery and horror, and from
anything that could suggest the past to the
popular mind. The old officialism, too,
should be swept away root and branch ; and
■this with the view of leaving no influence in
existence which would operate to preserve
any of the spirit of the old days of degradation.
* * *
But the influence that had been built up
through so many years in the colony had
too much power to allow itself to be swept
away. As the men of the new period
brought out by Responsible Government
rose in the political scale, they were absorbed
by the “Conservative” class in the com-
munity. Our history is full of instances of
men who began their careers in sympathy
with the indefinitely-expressed popular senti-
ment and ended them as tinselled knights of a
flimsy colonial order. But our history is pass-
ing through an intermediate stage, and the
period of transition is still to come. Indi-
cations are forthcoming fevery day that a
new race is growing up in Australia, which
is not Colonial but Australian, and which
only requires to be put on the right track
and trusted to its honest instincts to work
out Australia’s future on bright and popular
national lines which will not have their
starting-point in the miserable episodes of
old-time squalor, or their vanishing-point in
Federation or Imperialism. It is for the
guidance of this instinct, and to assist the
popular mind in coming to broad conclusions

“THE BULLETIN,”
(PUBLISHED AT SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES),
The Unique Weekly? Australia’s Nonpariel Illustrated Newspaper I
iST “ THE BULLETIN,” the Premier Australian Literary Journal, is the only paper which has a consistent and distinctive
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL POLICY. 1*
“ THE BULLETIN ” Favours :—A Republican Form of Government. Payment of Members. One Man, One Vote. State Revenue
derived directly from the Land. Complete Secularisation of State Education. Reform of the Criminal
Code and Prison System. A United Australia and Protection against the World.
M THE BULLETIN ” Denounces Religious Interference in Politics. Foreign Titles. The Chinese. Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more than half of Vhat appears in the newspapers of the day. It is only the otl
half that is found in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic paper which strives to exclude from its artistically-condensed columns all matter
which is not of general human interest. The Bulletin was started nine years ago with no capital but brains, and has become a vast
property, because it possessed a vitality lacked by the countless newspaper-ventures in which Australian capitalists have unavailingly
spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin's conductors claim that every progressive paper on the Australian continent has more or less endeavoured
to profit by its example and follow its lines. The result of its powerful influence and its unprecedented literary and commercial success
can at once be seen by comparing the methods pursued by the Australian daily and weekly press prior to and Immediately after the first
issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural publication its success was assured. It had at once a dozen more or less servile
imitators, many of which even took, so far as was possible, its name. They are now all dead, while The Bulletin continues the one
phenomenal success in Australian journalism, the one completely non-local and distinctly universal Australasian newspaper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during late years, spent some thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings with the
latest appliances for high-class printing and the production of illustrations, and they have now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legibility on the finest paper, and adorned with sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Australian journal which, throughout its career, has been consistently Radical.
It points with pride to the fact that for years it stood alone among secular newspapers in advocating the Irish National Cause, and
that it was the only Australian journal which denounced the Soudan Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national progress ; it is the forceful summons to the crusade against the
monopolies in land, wealth, power, and privilege —the direct cause of half the misery which now afflicts British humanity. Against the
claims of avaricious clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise
of any human authority which has not been granted by the people over whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly
contend. ,
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter transferred from the columns of
a daily paper issued from the same office. The Bulletin is not connected with any other paper, and the matter it contains is all
specially-prepared by its own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold by runners in the streets of every Australasian capital, is the most widely-
circulated of all papers published south of the equator, and is the only Australasian publication which enjoys a popularity unhampered by
the political boundaries that so closely restrict other journals to the colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman of Central Australia, the
pearl-sheller of Torres Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand Ranges. A paper which is at once the most popular city publication
and the organ of the intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal, and more than a hundred
copies of it are sold in Melbourne to one of any other paper* printed outside that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —easily ascertainable from any postal official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Australian journals, is most frequently-quoted in England, America, and the
Colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any other paper, because its vast mass of original and specially-written reading
matter is the brightest and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most artistic, and its policy the boldest and most straightforward ever
submitted to the Australian public.

CLEMENTS’
TONIC
IS THE ONLY RATIONAL
PHOSPHATED RESTORATIVE
PREPARED IN AUSTRALASIA.
SEE that you get CLEMENTS’ TONIC and take no other; hundreds of worthless imitations are offered for the
sake of extra profit. The preparation of a properly Phosphated Tonic requires so much time and labour that most
manufacturers will not go to the trouble of making a really valuable preparation. Beware of the injurious Imitations
offered by some unscrupulous dealers as being “just as good.” Rigidly eschew all substitutes sold under the names of
“ Blood ” and “Nerve Tonics,” “Regenerators,” “ Rejuvenators,” “ Invigorators,” &c., which are all prepared from astrin-
gent roots and herbs, and the cheaper Iron Salts ; beware of them, as they will permanently injure the coatings of the
stomach and alimentary canal, besides injuring the general health and constipating the bowels. CLEMENTS’ TONIC
does not injure the stomach, derange the digestive organs, nor blacken the teeth, but invigorates the system by supplying
the necessary mineral food for the proper formation of rich and healthy blood, tissue and bone.
FOR FEMALES j young or old, this Tonic is far superior to anything now sold, it stimulates the system
to properly perform its several functions, induces healthy and natural secretions, increasing them when weak and scanty,
and lessening them when excessive ; for any female weakness, periodical suffering, suppressions or irregularities, this
Tonic is invaluable, as it will restore the normal condition and induce all that is required. CLEMENTS’ TONIC
is the only one that has received the patronage of the medical profession, which is the greatest proof of its pharmaceutical
and therapeutical excellence. CLEMENTS’ TONIC fortifies the system against fevers and all disease stienglbens
the digestive organs, renews the health, vigor, and energy of the nervous system, increases the appetite, alvine. urinary and
cuticular excretions, supplies the essential brain food, and radically cures
NEURALGIA, WEAKNESS & NERVOUSNESS,
LOSS OF APPETITE, LOSS OF VIGOR,
FEMALE WEAKNESSES & IRREGULARITIES,
LOSS OF ENERGY & IMPAIRED VITALITY.
This may seem a long array of complaints for one medicine to cure, but it must be remembered that they are all
different effects of the same cause ; CLEMENTS’ TONIC removes the cause, then the effect ceases.
Wherever it is used it is called
“ TIRED NATURE’S GREAT RESTORER.”
See that you get “CLEMENTS’ TONIC,” and refuse all others
