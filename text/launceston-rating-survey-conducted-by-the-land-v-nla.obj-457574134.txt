LAUNCESTON
RATING SURVEY
Conducted by the Land Values
Research Group, Melbourne, on
behalf of the Tasmanian Rating
Reform League, to ascertain how
the redistribution of rates under
Unimproved Land Value Rating
would affect various classes of
property.
Launceston, Tasmania
1st January, 1946




THE BASIS OF COMPARISONS
This investigation has been made using the annual values listed
in the Assessment Roll for the year 1944-45 and the unimproved land
values and improvement values listed in the Government Valuation
Rolls for the same period. Public attention has already been drawn
to the fact that these rolls are not in a satisfactory condition and that
a general revaluation is necessary to restore equity in treatment
between individual ratepayers.
However, the rolls have been taken as they stand and the com-
parisons show how broad groups of properties would be affected
were the site value (or unimproved land value) used as a basis for
rating instead of annual value rating during the year 1944-45.
While the position of individuals within the groups may be
very greatly altered as a result of a revaluation, the differences in
incidence due to the rating systems themselves are so great that they
are unlikely to be greatly modified by such a re-valuation.
THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GAIN AND LOSS
The revenue to be raised under Site Value and Annual Value
Hating is the same, but the distribution is fundamentally different.
Some classes of property pay much more in rates under the one
system than under the other. In others the rates may be substantially
the same under either system.
The question of whether the rates on a particular property are
reduced or increased depends entirely upon how the ratio of the
unimproved value of the property to its annual value on the rolls
compares with the average ratio of the district as a whole.
The unimproved land value of the district being £2,701,000 and
the annual value £541,000, the ratio of the former to the latter is
5:1. This gives a very simple test by which everyone can tell
whether he would have reduced or increased rates by a change; viz.,
divide the unimproved value of the property by its rated annual
value; if the result is less than five the rates are lower on site value
rating; if greater than five, rates are lower on annual value rating,
while at this average value they would be the same under either
system.
The proportionate gain or loss can be seen by comparing the
figure for any property in question with the average figure, 5 :1.
If the figure for the property is 2.5 :1 the rates would be cut in half
by site value rating. If the figure for the property is 10 : 1 the rates
would be doubled.
This figure applies only to Launceston, the corresponding figure
for other districts may be very different according to their local
conditions.
It will be evident that this simple test of gain or loss is quite
independent of the rate in the £ which the Council imposes. This
alters the actual amount of the rate payable but does not affect the
relativity between the two systems.
In working the rates out the current composite rate of 4/7 in
the £ of annual value was used, the corresponding rate upon unim-
proved land value being lid. in the £.


HOW HOUSES WOULD BE AFFECTED
Of all classes of property houses are found to be the one most
favoured by site value rating.
This is so overwhelmingly evident as to enable the general
observation to be made that, outside the square bounded by Tamar,
York and Wellington Streets and the river, all houses of average
frontage and condition will be found to be benefited by site value
rating.
Within the square bounded by these streets is the business section
in which it is only to be expected that a lower proportion of houses
would benefit by site value rating. Even in this section, of 239 houses
studied, 139 (or 58 per cent.) carried lower rates under site value
rating.
Outside of this inner section an intensive study was made in the
purely residential streets in the course of which every house was
studied in each of thirty-five streets. Of 1,633 dwellings examined
in this process, 1,313 were found to benefit under site value rating
and only 320 by annual value rating. These figures show that 80
per cent, of houses gain under site value rating. They understate the
percentage for the whole city as, although approximately 25 per cent,
of the total dwellings have been covered, they include a much higher
proportion of the streets nearest the business centre where the gain
is less marked than in streets further out.
For the city overall it may be taken that the percentage benefited
by site value rating would be at least 85 per cent, which is in line
with the results of similar studies conducted in Victoria in districts
rating on land values.
Even in the extensions of the business streets—Brisbane, Charles,
George, St. John and York Streets —where land values are high, the
proportion gaining ranged from 60 per cent, in Charles Street to
82 per cent, in York Street, with an average of 70 per cent.
Although all residential areas gain under site value rating, the
extent of the gain is greater in the purely working class areas than
in the best residential areas due to the marked difference in price
per foot. The best of the longer streets are High Street and Elphin
Road, characterised by large frontages, high land values and good
quality homes. Even here the percentage benefiting on site value
rating is 59 and 56 respectively.
In the working class areas the percentage is well over 90, while
in many streets not a single house would fail to get reduced rates.
In one section of eleven streets named after military leaders of the
First World War, of 118 houses not a single one would have a rate
increase. It may be accepted that in such areas where rate increases
are found they are due to the holding of frontages capable of further
subdivision.


HOW VACANT LAND WOULD BE AFFECTED
As the housing properties gain so overwhelmingly it is necessary to
consider at whose expense the gain would be made. Vacant land is the
only class of property which invariably pays more on site value rating.
In all other classes some gain and others lose depending upon the
degree of improvement. The gain of householders being mainly at
the expense of vacant holders it is important to consider the extent
of such holdings.
The whole of the rolls have been examined and the holdings
classified. It was found that of the 10,752 holdings on the rolls no
less than 1,073 were vacant lots with a total unimproved land value
of £205,000. This does not include the very large number of hold-
ings upon which the improvements are a minor portion of the total
value and a large acreage in subdivisional areas.
Vacant land generally would carry four times as much in rates under
site value rating as it pays under annual value rating.
This large proportion of vacant land at present contributes only
£2,400 of the city’s £124,000 rate revenue, a very insignificant
fraction. Under site value rating its contribution would rise to
£9,600. It should be noted that vacant holders are largely benefiting,
even more than they would normally do, through the out-of-date
valuations. In a large proportion of cases the vacant holdings have
remained in the same hands for many years and are rated at their
values of thirty years ago, although they have appreciated
considerably.
Although there are 1,073 holdings of vacant lots the actual num-
ber of separate lots considerably exceeds this figure as many are
already subdivided. One holder has over 100 separate lots. There
are in all only 789 distinct holders of vacant land, the remaining 224
having multiple holdings in various streets.
It is generally recognised that vacant lot holders are the least
desirable class of ratepayers in any area and retard its development.
Analysis shows that the nature of the holdings is strongly speculative,
injurious to the better development of the district. No less than 176
(22 per cent.) of the holders are females with a total value of
£30,890. A high proportion of these are unable or unwilling to
develop their properties themselves and the community suffers
accordingly.
There are 72 absentee holders who live in other places and hold
an unimproved value on the rolls of £9,000, forming 9 per cent, of
the number of distinct holders.
Of the vacant holdings a very high proportion is in the hands
of deceased estates. There were 72 such estates with an unimproved
value of £30,830. This class of holding has generally the financial
ability to fully develop the holdings, but this is discouraged by high
rating upon buildings as against low rates upon the vacant holdings.
While many estates do hold highly improved property which would
benefit under site value rating, others merely hold land idle to the
general disadvantage.
The largest holding in this class is that of the A. and R. G.
O’Connor Estates, which had land of an unimproved value of £4,560
covering 68 lots. Since this roll was prepared this estate has acquired

a further 54 lots with unimproved value of £I,OOO. This estate has
many improved properties and may intend an extensive building
project in which its activity would be commendable. Such a project
would be helped by site value rating. In any case it would be less
likely to merely hold for speculation under site value rating when
it would pay on the vacant land £2,560 yearly as against £640 under
annual value.
How heavily the rating tips the scales against improvement of
properties may be seen from cases noted in Eddington Crescent,
where, merely due to putting a house upon the sites, the rates under
annual value rating have been increased to 40 times those which
the same site would carry if it had remained vacant.
HOW BUSINESS PROPERTIES ARE AFFECTED
In the business area the difference in the rates depends upon the
degree of improvement of the site. Broadly, sites occupied by buildings
commensurate with their site value would benefit by site value rating.
Those inadequately improved would carry increased ratings.
The fundamental difference between the rating systems so far
as city business properties are concerned will be seen from the
following summary showing the aggregated values of improvements
and their sites for the five properties most benefited under each
system, for each of the business streets.
In each case it will be seen that the most improved properties
are benefited by site value rating and the least improved by annual
value rating. This is the characteristic difference between the two
systems.
The aggregated values of the whole thirty properties benefited
by each system is as follows:
Impvts. Value Site Value Benefit
30 Benefiting Site Value Rating .. £159,570 £67,372 £l-215
30 Benefiting Annual Value Rating £68,963 £173,949 £4,074
It will be seen that the two sets of figures are almost exactly
inverted. Site value rating favours those in which the value of
improvements exceeds that of the sites, and the annual value system
favours those with least improvements. In those benefited by site
value rating there are improvements worth £236 to every £lOO
in site value whereas the group favoured by annual value rating
has only £4O in improvements per £lOO in sites.
There can be no doubt that a high investment in improvements,
which give better conditions to local employment and react favour-
ably on the trade and general business conditions of the city, is
more deserving of rate benefits than the reverse.
In bonus&ing the least improved properties at the expense of the
better improved the annual value rating is evidently highly anti-social.


TENANTED PROPERTIES PENALISED
Another little-recognised difference between the systems of great
importance to the business community emerged from the study. Some
business sites in the main streets are owned and operated by the same
person, while in others the buildings are let to tenants. Annual
value rating treats these two classes of owners very differently.
Where the property is let to tenants the owner is rated on the
actual rentals which work out commonly at about 10 per cent, of
the capital improved value on the rolls, although in one case as high
as 23 per cent, was noted. For owner-occupied properties where the
rental value has to be inferred the assessments have usually been
taken as 5 per cent., although several cases below this have been
noted.
The difference means that under annual value ratinq the same property
will commonly carry double the rates if it is let compared to what it
would pay if occupied by the owner.
This has a most disturbing effect upon the competitive power of
businesses. Owner-occupiers of business or shopping sites are at all
times in a better competitive position than tenants of similar busi-
nesses, since in addition to their competitive trading profit a large
part of their return is ground rent to themselves. But, in addition
to this loading, the annual value system gives the owner-occupier
an additional bonus in low rates as compared with those on tenanted
properties.
Site value rating would put all properties, whether tenant or
owner occupied, upon an equitable trading footing.
THE EFFECT UPON SPENDING IN SHOPPING CENTRES
The change in rate incidence would have a very important effect upon
the shopping and business centres apart from the question of whether
these properties Carry reduced or .ncreased rates.
The prosperity of the shopping centre is entirely dependent, and
of other classes of business scarcely less so, upon the income of the
ordinary householder. This class of citizen spends mainly in the
shops upon consumable goods and social satisfactions.
The business centre bounded by Tamar, Cameron, Wellington
and York Streets with all cross streets, contains many inadequately
improved properties and the rates carried by this area would be
increased from £24,888 up to £37,590, an increase of £12,702.
Together with the extra £7,200 contributed under site value
rating upon vacant land these two items give approximately £20,000
more in the hands of the householders who form the customers of
Brisbane Street and the other shopping centres. To this amount must
be added an unascertained but considerable amount of rates trans-
ferred to inadequately improved properties outside this business
square. There would be an offset of some £2,200 rate savings made
by industrial properties.
The increased spendings by householders of monies which under
annual value rating remain largely with investment groups is of
considerable importance to the operators of the shops and other
businesses whether in the capacity of tenants or owners.


THE EFFECT UPON INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS
Launceston has comparatively few large industries giving
employment to a great number of people. There are, in fact, only
three concerns with improvements valued at more than £20,000.
There is a great desire to attract new and solid industries to the
district and, induced by various concessions made, Patons & Baldwins
A/asia Ltd. established a fine spinning mill there.
The rating treatment of this firm exemplifies the harmful prin-
ciple of annual rental rating in working against the objective aimed
at. This firm has a most modern and attractive factory which is a
credit to the city. The improvements at the mill are valued at
£157,600 and the site value at £4,400. The rates on the mill are
£1,850 under annual value rating as against £2OO on site value
rating, a difference of £1,650.
The rate difference is equivalent to loading the concern with an
additional outlay of the difference capitalised, that is £33,000 upon
which it must find interest, beyond the actual outlay. In other words
the rating system increases its capital cost by 21 per cent, which is
reflected in cost of production. It may be remarked that in England
factories are regarded as so important that they are entirely de-rated.
The difference due to annual value rating is therefore very important
in any competitive business and may make its establishment quite
uneconomic.
The injurious nature of this rating is shown further by the
fact that in its desire to become a model undertaking this firm has
established a splendid welfare centre for its employees. The build-
ings are valued at £7,025 with a site value of £666. Such an
elaborate and commendable project is not necessary to the x'unning
of the factory and firms do not always display the same zeal for
their employees’ welfare. This firm is rewarded by having to pay
£OO in annual value rates as against £3O under site value rating
upon the welfare centre.
On the other hand the same firm holds unimproved land valued
at £1,280 upon which it pays only £l5 in rates as against £59 under
site value rating. It may be noted that before this firm built upon
the sites the land would have contributed to the Council in rates
only £72 annually as against the £289 the firm would pay under
site value rating over all its holdings.
All of the industrial firms have been classified and grouped
according to whether they benefit under site value rating, have
about the same rates under either system, or benefit in rates under
annual value rating. Within these groups they have been arranged
according to their degree of improvement compared with the value
of the sites. The results will be seen in the following summary
from which the fundamental differences between the two forms of
rating will be evident. The details concerning each firm are given
in a table in the appendix to this study. Only established firms
have been included in order that those compared are of undoubted
financial standing so far as ability to make improvements is
concerned.

SUMMARY OF RATE INCIDENCE UPON GROUPS OF
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES
The financial ability to make improvements and to pay rates is quite
comparable in each of the above groups, yet it is evident that the annual
value rating operates to penalise those firms making capital outlay on
improvements and to bonus those which fail to improve their holdings.
It will be seen that the value of the sites involved is much the
same in each group. The value of the improvements in the most
improved group, however, is 38 times as great as that in the least
improved group. From the viewpoint of the community in general
there can be little doubt as to which group is the most deserving
of a rate bonus.
The poorly improved groups contain two brickworks and two
potteries. This class of business imposes heavy wear on roads and
is an extractive industry presenting the municipality with future
problems and demanding more services than are required of the
municipality from most of the more highly improved firms. The
annual value rates of £ll and £25 respectively are quite incon-
gruous for these industries which are not unprofitable. The list
also includes four timber handling firms, two pipe works and two
foundries, all of which have heavy road usage and disproportionately
small rates under annual value rating.
Of 55 firms included in the detailed list, the 31 whose rates
would be reduced or unaltered by site value rating gain to an aggre-
gate amount of £2,808 while the poorly improved industrial concerns
contribute £1,005 extra between them. The difference of £1,803 is
made up at the expense of vacant and poorly improved sites else-
where in the city.
EFFECT UPON HOTEL PROPERTIES
An interesting study is afforded by the 42 hotel properties which
were specially investigated. The same principles of classification
according to degree of improvement were followed as with previous
groups but the results have additional interest in that all the pro-
perties are engaged in the same industry. Of the properties, 15 are
found to be benefited substantially by annual value rating, three
have rates about the same undei; either system, while 24 are favoured
by site value rating.

However, although numerically fewer, the 15 favoured by annual
value rating receive an aggregate saving of £1,491, while the 24
favoured by site value rating receive an aggregate saving under that
system of £4BB. Over the hotels as a whole there is thus an
aggregate increase of £1,003.
The relative investment in site values and in improvements and
the rates payable are compared in the summary below:—
It .is a most desirable condition that, on the average, equal outlay of
capital on improvements will return equal return for that outlay. If that
condition is not met the balance of investment is disturbed. Obviously,,
there is a very differential treatment of the operators in the two groups
by annual value rating.
The second group has a much higher actual investment in im-
provements than has the first and a much lower proportion in site
values. The first group is in a very fortunate competitive position
as compared with the second in that £4,270 of its annual rental value
is really a ground rent whereas for the more highly improved group
only £1,560 represents ground rent and £4,766 is return from its
improvements.
The portion due to improvements is the result of the actual
efforts of the undertaking but the ground rental portion is really a
social product due to the community as a whole and not to the
undertaking itself.
The first group occupies very valuable sites and its contribution
in rates under annual value works out at £2/7/6 per £lOO of site
value. The second group contribution under annual value rating
works out at £7 per £lOO of site value. It will be evident that the
operators in the second group are much more harshly treated by the
present rating system than are their more fortunately situated
competitors.
Under site value rating both of these two groups would be paying
uniformly at the rate of £4/11/- per £lOO of site value on the
present valuation. They would thus both be placed upon an equal
footing with equal encouragement to improve their properties.
The hotels in the first group are for the most part occupying
valuable sites within the main city block, whereas those in the
second group are distributed over the rest of the city.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
In all classes of property a change to site value rating
would benefit in rates those which are most improved at
the expense of sites which are least improved. It would
thus encourage investment in improvements rather than in
vacant or poorly improved properties. Investment in im-
provements is most desirable in itself as this class of
investment gives demand for materials and labour forming
the basis of the prosperity of all classes.
At least 85 per cent, of the houses would carry re-
duced rates under site value rating. Some 60 per cent, of
industrial concerns would benefit under site value rating
at the expense of the poorly improved industrial concerns
and of the hotels as a group. Of the hotels, 64 per cent,
benefit under site value rating, although their gains are
exceeded by the increases upon the minority. Highly im-
proved city business properties gain rate reductions under
site value rating at the expense of the poorly improved
city properties. Vacant land in all cases pays substantially
increased rates. The increased rates upon this class of
property should tend to stimulate improvement or lead to
disposal to others able and willing to improve.

Gain Under Site Value Rating
Rates greater under annual value rating by £4BB or by 52 per
cent.
Comparison of the Groups A and C shows that the annual value
rating is out of all proportion to the capital investment involved. The
total value of assets in Group A is £124,544 as against £82,831 in
B, yet the rates paid are only slightly greater.

FACTS ABOUT RATING ON SITE (UNIMPROVED LAND) VALUES
The unimproved land value is the value of bare land, regardless
of any improvements made upon it. This value arises, not from the
enterprise of any individual, but simply from the activities and exist-
ence of the community as a whole. It rises or falls with the pros-
perity of the community and is the direct result of the outlay of
communal funds on services such as roads and footpaths, lighting,
water supply, sewerage, tram and bus services, etc.
Having been created by the community these values should be
collected by the community in order to defray the costs to which
the community is subjected by their creation.
As is proven by the survey published herewith, the collection
of rates based on site values relieves householders and enterprising
businessmen and manufacturers of the unjust rate burden imposed
on them by any rating system which taxes improvement values.
This method encourages development, enterprise, employment and
production and discourages speculation, stagnation and the non-improve-
ment of properties.
Rating on site values is not a new or untried experiment. It is
the established principal of municipal taxation in 90 per cent, of
the incorporated area of Australia and more than 60 per cent, of
New Zealand. It has been in use in Queensland since 1890 and in
New South Wales since 1908.
Tasmania is the only State which has not adopted site value
rating. The Australian Capital Territory of Canberra has never
employed any other system. No municipality in Australia, once
having adopted site rating, has ever reverted to the system of rating
on annual value, although many attempts to revert have 1 been made
by speculators and other interested parties. In every reversionary
poll the ratepayers have insisted on the retention of site rating.
One of Tasmania’s acutest problems is housing and this survey
reveals one reason why houses are scarce—because 10 per cent, of
the rated holdings in Launceston are withheld from use.
It is obvious that while a tenth of the city’s rated holdings
are held out of use available land must be short and, while
unused land is relieved of rates, its price must be forced up unduly
high. At the same time the heaping of rates on to improved properties
is discouraging building.
The rating system is therefore a potent factor in the housing
problem. This is proven by the fact that in Melbourne, in those
municipalities which rate on site value, building activities in the
twenty years prior to the war were more than twice as great per
available acre as in those suburbs which still rate on annual value.
Municipalities in Tasmania have the right to change their system
of rating by a simple decision by the Council concerned or by a poll
of ratepayers. In the interests of the ratepayers, to promote pros-
perity and development, to facilitate the solving of the housing
problem and post-war reconstruction generally, the change should be
made promptly.
The Rating Reform League, Box 21, P.O. Launceston, will
be glad to supply literature and information on the subject and requests
the co-operation of all persons prepared to assist in achieving this simple,
just and far-reaching reform.




This survey, carried out by an inde-
pendent, scientific and experienced
agency, gives factual information which
cannot be discounted, it is published
in the interests of the City of Launces-
ton and its ratepayers by the Tasmanian
Rating Reform League, P,O. Box No. 21,
Launceston, Tasmania.
