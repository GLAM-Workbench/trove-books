SOUTHERN DISTRICT
' I 'HE beautiful scenery and invigorating climate of the Southern Line are not nearly so well-
known as they should he, though visitors are on the increase annually.
The Falls carry a far larger volume of water than those on the Western Line, owing to
the large area drained hy each of the streams.
The vegetation between that part of the Southern Line from Campbelltown to Moss Vale
and the coast presents a striking contrast to most of the Australian “ hush.”
The forests include many of the prettiest of Colonial trees, such as the lilly-pilly, cedar,
corkwood, hickory, and sassafras, with giant turpentine and spreading fig trees. Graceful fern-
trees, bangalow, and cahhage-tree palms are in places largely in evidence.
The roads generally are easily negotiable, and cycling and motoring have become popular
in the tourist resorts.
The Wombeyan Caves are reached rid Mittagong, Bowral, Moss Vale, or Goulburn, and
Bungonia Caves vid Marulan or Goulburn. Good shooting.
Week-end trips leave Sydney each Friday for Wombeyan Caves, and the cross-country trip
Moss Vale and Nowra. Tickets are obtainable at the Government Tourist Bureau, covering all
expenses.

ILLAWARRA DISTRICT.
|' HE South Coast is favoured as a tourist line, and is rich in picturesque resorts.
The National Park, into which trains run at certain times during the day, is a great
pleasure ground for the public.
From Clifton to Wollongong the district is largely devoted to coal-mining; and from
Wollongong to Nowra, daily-farming is the leading industry. The main supply of milk for
Sydney comes from this district.
Lake Illawarra is a fishing and shooting spot, and is largely visited each season
The semi-tropical nature of the vegetation, and the variety and beauty of the ferns which
abound in the gullies, are great inducements to visitors to explore the bush. Both fishing and
shooting are good at certain seasons.
The coastal scenery along the Illawarra Line is equal to anything of its kind to be found in
other lands.
Week-end trips are arranged by the Government Tourist Bureau to Nowra, Kangaroo
Valley, Fitzroy Falls, and Moss Vale. Fare £2 10s., covering all expenses from Friday to
Monday,

THE BRIGHTON
It is surprising how few people are aware of the existence of such a lovely seaside
resort as this is. It possesses every natural advantage which should make it one
of the most frequented places in all Australia. The Special Cheap Fares from
Sydney, available every week end, are only 11s. lOd. first, and ss. lid. second
class return. It is one of the prettiest spots in Australia. The scenery of the
adjoining district is simply magnificent, and the drives through the grandest
country in all Australia, over macadamised roads, are a treat in store for those
accustomed to ordinary Australian scenery.
The accommodation at this Hotel is unsurpassed for attention and comfort,
having hot and cold water and sea baths free of charge, together with every con-
venience. There are also splendid Golf Links and Tennis Courts.

The famous natural curiosity—“ The Blowhole is a great sourceof attraction
to visitors, and the free sea baths are of themselves enough to entice thousands
of visitors to this Brighton of Australia, which possesses a climate delightfully
cool and refreshing, not marred by any of the pests or discomforts which render
life intolerable in some other parts of Australia. There are no mosquitoes, flies,
or duststorms.
The Minnamurra Falls are worth visiting in this neighbourhood. Saddleback
Mountain —well called the “ roof of Illawa rra ’’—rises to a great height immediately
behind Kiama, and is accessible by a well-made road. The view from the summit
is indescribably grand.
The postal service of Kiama is very complete. Mails are exchanged thrice
daily with Sydney.

COOMA (266 miles from Sydney), 2,662 feet. Is
the terminus of the line, and a starting-point for
Mount Kosciusko, Kiandra, and the Yarrangobilly
Caves. The climate of Cooma is invigorating, and
the district is becoming more and more popular each
summer. An increase is also noticeable in the
number of visitors to Mount Kosciusko, and now
that the trip has been made so easy and comfortable
a considerable additional traffic is certain to result.
A novel winter sport is snow-shoeing, and several
parties have been organised in Sydney to attend the
annual snow-shoe races at Kiandra. Ice-skating may
also be enjoyed. Large numbers of hares are sent
away from the district each season. Splendid shoot-
ing of all descriptions Famous trout centre.
A round trip from Sydney to Cooma, up Kosciusko,
across to Yarrangobilly Caves, and return vid Tumut,
may be arranged at a cost of about £l2 first-class
throughout.

WENTWORTH FALLS (61 miles from Syd-
ney), 2,844 feet, is one of the great sights of the
Mountains. The main falls, 900 feet high, are a mile
and a half from the station. These and about 50 other
waterfalls, together with the surrounding cliffs, have
been made easy of access by the opening up of paths.
One part of the Wentworth Falls Reserve, the
“ Valiev of Waters,” contains a succession of falls
unequalled in Australia, and unaffected by droughts.
The paths descend 1,840 feet below the entrance to
the foot of Vera Falls (200 feet). On the northern
side of the railway, Water Nymphs Dell, with its
many waterfalls, is one of the principal sites. The
paths lead visitors behind the principal falls, and the
effect of looking through them, when lit up by the
sun at midday, is indescribably beautiful. Besides
the falls mentioned above, there are quite fifty more
to which no paths are made, so that “ exploring
parties ” have ample scope outside the beaten tracks.
Tourist Inquiry Room, Weeks’ House Agency.
LEURA (64 miles from Sydney), 3,231 feet,
is a particularly healthy and picturesque towmship,
and is now practically a suburb of Katoomba, and
has a great attraction in the “ Leura Falls,” “ Valley
of the Waters,” “ Gordon Falls,” and “ Lookout,” as
well as numerous other sights. Federal Pass con-
nects Leura and Katoomba Falls. The Golf Links
have added much to the attractions at Leura.

BATHURST (145 miles from Sydney), 2,155
feel, is an important western city, and the climate is
salubrious. It is generally recognised as a sanatorium
for pulmonary patients, possessing a fine, salubrious,
invigorating climate. The Pass through the Blue
Mountains opened up a magnificent stretch of agri-
cultural and pastoral country, which was christened
the Bathurst Plains. These revealed an unlimited
store of wealth in the grassy pasturages and cereal-
growing soils which characterised the whole district.
Splendid driving roads, offering perfect views, are
available throughout the district.

ORANGE (196 miles from Sydney), 2,846 feet,
is a popular resort during the hot summer months,
especially with visitors from the hot inland country
westward, being the highest town west of the Blue
Mountains. In winter the weather is cold, and
snowstorms are not uncommon, but the climate is
always bracing and exhilarating. The various hotels
and boarding-houses are generally fully taxed during
the season. Orange is surrounded by a large farming
and fruit-growing district, and much mining is also
carried on.
NEWBRIDGE (165 miles from Sydney), 2,877
feet. The Three Brothers are conspicuous peaks at
the head of three creeks—Fitzgerald’s, Queen Char-
lotte’s Vale, and Caloola. The Abercrombie Caves
are 28 miles distant.
WELLINGTON (251 miles from Sydney) has
among its chief attractions the Wellington Caves, 5
miles from station. Vehicles meet all trains, and
convey visitors to Caves. Dry healthy climate.

WINDSOR AND RICHMOND DISTRICT.
WINDSOR and Richmond lie hidden away so unobtrusively beneath the shadow of the hills,
that one is apt to leave them out of account—apt, at all events, to think of them more in
their relationship to the early history of Australian settlement than as the goal of a holiday
excursion. Yet, in reality, with their old associations, their picturesque surroundings, the proximity
of Windsor to Wiseman’s Ferry, and of Richmond to the Kurrajong Heights, they form the terminal
point of one of the most delightful jaunts within easy reach of Sydney.
The trip up the Hawkeshury to Sackville Reach, thence by coach to Windsor and rail to
Sydney makes an ideal round excursion, tickets covering the rail portion of this journey being issued
daily at Sydney and suburban stations available for six months, at 6/- and I/-, Ist and 2nd class.

RICHMOND (38 miles from Sydney) is on the
flats bordering the Nepean (Upper Hawkesbury).
The well-known Kurrajong Heights are 11 miles
beyond Richmond. The road runs through most
picturesque country, interspersed with orange
orchards. From the hill top, 2,000 feet above sea,
a magnificent panoramic view is obtained. A regular
coach runs daily from Richmond to Kurrajong, and,
if required, the return can be made to catch the
afternoon train to Sydney ; so that if time is limited,
one day only need be spent in visiting the Kurra-
jong. Near Richmond is one of the Model Farms
and Agricultural Colleges established by the Govern-
ment to develop the agricultural industry of the
State.
