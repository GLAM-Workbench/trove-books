CORN EXCHANGE, Oct. 25.
Our prices are, in a great measure, nominally as on
last market; but we have had little yet done. Factors
demand the same price for Wheat, and fine parcels have
fetched it. Oats look heavy; but no reduction can
safely be quoted in the present hour of the market, as
the transactions have been so trivial.

SyGAR.?The Sugar market continued very heavy
last week, and where sales were effected, lower prices
were submitted to, particularly in the inferior and mid,
thing descriptions, of which the greatest part of the pre-
sent stock consists. Sugars 60s and upwards, are so
scarce that they fully command the late prices.
? The deliveries of Sugar last week are about 3,300
casks, nearly the Staple as, last year, which evidently
that the consumption continues extensive, and

that master Akehurst and Elizabeth Haynes were

been strictly questioned as to that tact, said he
did not believe it. She repeated that they were,
and said that all the neighbours knew it, but he
manifested no surprise. Kept on his work, Goi
and the girl went home by herself. On his re- P ll '
turn home in the evening, notwithstanding his
having been , assured of the perpetration of the
murders of his bid neighbours and acquaintances,
he did not evince a desire to see the bodies, or are
visit the cottage, and actually, as the writer has
been given to understand, kept away trom a scene
that every other person within five miles visited,
in consequence of the diabolical murders that had
so recently taken place there. On the morning of V 1(
the interment, however, Bennett proceeded, for
the first time, to the cottage since the perpetra- w >
tion of the murders, and assisted in carrying the w
bodies to the grave. Since the last examination,
it appears that so much suspicion attaches itself "
to his whole conduct subsequent to the murders, ?
that several of the magistrates resident in the ?
neighbourhood, not satisfied of his innocence, f 1
have determined that a more strict investigation y 1
should take place into the whole of the circum- u <
stances, and'yesterday was accordingly appointed
for that purpose.
Monday the Rev. Mr. Holland was at Union- ca
hall police-office, and had a long interview, in etl
the private room, with the sitting magistrate, on
the subject of the late murders at Fetcham. The al
retreat of Mary Ayres and William Page, the
man with whom she cohabits, has not yet been 111
discovered, notwithstanding the exertions of the
officers during the past week.

When the evidence was finished, and the sitting
of the Court suspended, a number of Magistrates,
and other persons who had been admitted to the
reserved places, crowded round Mr. Canning, who
appeared to applaud the decency, good order, and
affecting interest with which our criminal pro-
cesses are carried on. The Honourable Gentleman
was dressed in a blue frock coat, and leant upon a
cane.
M. Bayeux addressed the Court on the sittings
being resumed, and M. Vidalise made an ingenious
defence for the prisoner.?After the President of
the Court had summed up, the Jury retired for
about a quarter of an hour, when they returned a
verdict of Wilful Murder, but without premedita-
tion, by a majority of seven to five.
They condemned Bureau to hard labour for life,
to lie pilloried, and branded with the letters T.P.
SINGULAR ACCIDENT.
About seven o?clock on Sunday morning, as
George Byers, coachman to Titus Berry, Esq.
was proceeding through Jqhn-street, Oxford-
street, he was alarmed by the cries of a female
issuing from a cellar of one of the houses; he
heard her supplicating for help, and calling out
? Murder.? He knocked at the house door, but
no person appeared, and the cries of the female
became much weaker. Two other persons at
that moment came up, to whom Byers related the
circumstance ; and as no person came to the door,
although they knocked repeatedly, they forced
open one of the shutters, and then some of the
inmates of the house came down stairs. Byers,
and several other persons, immediately went into
the kitchen, but there and in the cellar all was
silent. At length a faint cry issued from a vault
under the street, and the female again implored
assistance; the party of course hastened into the
vault, and the following curious discovery was
madeln the middle of the vault was a well
which had formerly been covered with a stone
one foot and a half square, but in the course of
the night this stone hail fallen in, and the chasm
not being perceived by the young woman, a ser-
vant, who went into the vault for some shavings,
she fell into the well, which was about twenty
feet deep, and half filled with water; she, how-
ever, caught hold of the bricks at the side, and
clung to them until Byers and his party came to
her assistance. The well being small, no person
could descend, and a ladder was therefore lowered;
she took hold of it, and was immediately drawn
out, but in a very distressed state. The occu-
piers of the house were ignorant of the well
being in the cellar ; and as the family slept in the
back part of the house, and could not hear her
cries, there can be no doubt she would have pe-
rished in the well, and her body never been
discovered, but that her cries were hoard in the.

tain proceedings at the Westmeath Sessions,
against some refractory tenants of Sir Thomas
Chapman, who were sued for rent by their land-
lord, and defended by the Catholic Association,
who sent down Mr. Shiel specially. The nominal
defendants were creatures in the lowest state of
destitution; their tenures were held at one penny
per acre rent, which they were unable to pay until
supplied with funds by the Association ; and it
was declared that the imposition of the costs of
the suit, amounting to thirty shillings a head,
would ensure their infer ruin. Mr. Shiel mads a
fustian speech, in which this instrument of a body
? that tried to dissever the connection of all the
landlords and tenants in the kingdom, expati-
ated with the most disgusting effrontery upon the
guilt of tampering with that tie. In the end. Sir
Thomas Chapman?s agent consented to forego the
costs, upon the payment of the arrears of rent
fiv the Association, and the mob shouted.
BURIAL OF TALMA.
We do not perfectly understand the nature of th
this affair ; Sir Thomas Chapman?s agent was of m
course right to forego the claim of Costs from b J
men vjho were unable to pay them, but we

that these wretched beings should resign ar

against presenting the indictment for maintenance
to which Mr. Shiel and his party have by their T
conduct in this affair plainly exposed themselves T!
?that no man may plead ignorance upon this th
point we quote the following passage from Sir ?
William Blackstone?s Commentaries : p
? Maintenance is an offence that bears a near j?,
relation to the former ( Common Barrelry) ; being
ail officious intermeddling in a suit that no way tb
belongs to one, by maintaining or assisting either ac
party with money or otherwise, to prosecute or 0 f

Leson, Baptiste, Armand, Michelot, Cartigny,
and Desmousseaux, bore the cloth which covered
the coffin, on which was observed a crown of
laurel. The others followed in the order marked
out in the programme. The cortege defiled si-
lently. Arrived at Pere la Chaise, they searched
a long time for the place destined to receive the
remains of Talma, and hence arose a sort of pro-
cessional march, perplexing enough. At length
the body was deposited in the space belonging to
M. Davilliers, and there it remained till the mo-
ment when the tomb was to be raised. Near
the grave were the members of the family, M.
the Commissioner Royal of the Theatre Francais,
MM. Arnault, de Jouy, Lafon, and the Represen-
tatives of the Theatres Royal. M. Lafon read
the first oration, then MM. Arnault and de Jouy
read two others.
At the reading of the second discourse by M.
de Jouy, a horrible hissing was sent forth,
and it was to be met with great indignation
when it was discovered that this was
the notice of the undertakers to one another at
the arrival of each detachment. An immense
number of barriers, trees and tomb-stones, were
broken, pressed down by the multitude, who still
looked out for a spectacle.
In the procession was seen M. Mechin, in the
costume of a Deputy; the Generals Excelmans
and Aiix ; Colonels Brack, Manuel, Lafitte, C.
Perrier, Gros Devilliers ; Benard, Member of the
Chamber of Commerce ; Rossini, Paer, Cheru-
bini, Careffe, Gros Picot, Routon, Deguerre, Pi-
card, Berenger, Villemain,Soumet. Bane, Moreau,
Compigny, Delrein, Ancelot, Magnet, Thiers,
Tissot, Taylor, the Commissioner Royal of the
Theatre Francais, and the editors of almost all
the journals. Among those who could not ac-
company the procession on foot were Messrs.
Lais, St. Phell, and Martin ; Mesdames Mars,
Duchenois, and Volnais, followed in their mourn-
ing coaches.
While the procession was passing before the
theatre of Madame, it was remarked that all the
actresses, clad in mourning, were in the balcony
of the theatre.

By a letter, dated last of July, received in this

learning of the revolt of Paez, and the consequent

delusive hopes of regaining advantages. But its ef-
forts in this as well as in every other department
requiring energy and power and influence, are limit-

the fable of the Waggoner and Hercules. The

the late changes in Portugal, and they cease al-
