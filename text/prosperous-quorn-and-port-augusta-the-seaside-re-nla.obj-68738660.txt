THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL,
Under Management W. t. Cowan.
Is now one of the Best-Appointed in South Australia. Porter meets Trains with Conveyance.
Commodious Billiard Room. Saloon Bar. Excellent Table. Every Comfort. Cosy Parlors.
'J'HERE are two first-class Hotels which cater very successfully for the
travelling public in Port Augusta, and ? The Great Northern,? since
the advent of Mr. Cowan, who took over the business some two months
ago, has greatly improved, and now ranks, not only with the best outside
Adelaide, but in the city itself. Mr. Cowan is an exceedingly active,
keen business man, who believes in
catering for his patrons thoroughly,
and decided very promptly on tak-
ing charge of the hotel under
review to make many alterations
and go in largely for repairs. Many
have been carried out, and are
still being executed. The writer
thoroughly inspected the build-
ings, and will endeavour to
to convey a correct idea of the
comforts this hotel offers to the
South Australian public. The ex-
terior view of the hotel is very
deceptive, and one would never
gauge it to contain 57 large, well-
ventilated, and airy rooms; but it
is so. The front bar is commodious,
and the saloon is a neat little cosy
one which the proprietor intends
to enlarge at an early date. The
dining room is truly a magnifi-
cent one, elegantly furnished, and
is the largest in South Australia outside Adelaide. The size is
40 ft. x3O ft., which gives a space of 1,200 ft. Even this room is not
found too large to accommodate the many who are patrons of ? The Great
Northern. The tables are beautifully kept, and the meals all that even
the most fastidious could desire. They reflect credit, as do the rooms

BREWSTER & SOMERTON are easliy the leading Butchers
in Quorn, and although the firm have only carried on operations
during the past twelve months, yet have, owing to the excellent quality
of their goods, captured the principal trade in meat and small goods in
the town. Messrs. E. Brewster and A. Somerton, who are the members
of the firm, both have farms adjacent to the town, and a great deal of the
meat supplied is grown by themselves on the splendid Quorn fattening
country. Excellent small goods are manufactured, and the firm does
trade with Port Augusta in this line. They are both popular men and
are deservedly of the big support they have received.
upstairs, on the able management of Mrs. Cowan. A first-class billiard
room is attached to the hotel. The table is an up-to-date one, the cues
always in good order, and therefore a pleasant game is assured. There
are four large (one particularly so), well ventilated, fitted up
sample rooms. The proprietor is at the present time having them
thoroughly renovated. Upstairs
there are several comfortable
parlors, two baths, and lavatory ac-
commodation for both sexes. The
hotel is lighted right throughout
with acetylene gas, even to the
baths and lavatory. Loose boxes
are at the rear of the building, and
vehicles are always obtainable.
Mr. and Mrs. Cowan have both
put commendable work into their
new enterprise, and they leave noth-
ing undone to make all their patrons
most comfortable. Nothing is too
much trouble to them, and they have
the advantage of being successful in
having obtained a most courteous
and proficient staff. It is always a
pleasure to describe and give praise
where honestly due, and in recom-
mending ?The Great Northern ,,
Hotel the writer feels that it
is done very fairly and con-
scientiously. The proprietor, although decidedlyjpopular with one and all,
has not made this business in a short eight weeks so flourishing solely
and merely through his own popularity, but on account of the excellent
manner every detail, both large and small, is carried out. After all, the
little details in the successful management of a hotel are everything.

Prosperous Quorn,
Illustrated and Described by J . Edward Robertson .
QUORN, FEBRUARY, 1909.
/ T''HH writer has visited and
described nearly all the
larger towns of South Aus-
tralia, and of all the descrip-
tions not one gives more
pleasurable feelings than the
one on Quorn and district.
Quorn is invariably associated
in the public mind as a ? far
northern town,? and a town
situated such is identified with
a dried-up arid spot where
little beauty abounds? like-
wise the progressive spirit.
?Tis not so, and in this short
review the writer intends to
point out its great value as a
health resort, and that
it offers a paradise for
the tourist. The photographs
in this book very clearly
demonstrate its charms, and
perhaps speak far more forcibty
than the writer can by mere
words, and will assist in mak-
ing known the town and dis-
trict ?known in the progress
it has made, and for the oppor-
tunities it offers as a health
and pleasure resort.
THE BIRTH OF QUORN.
The birth of Quorn occurred
somewhere about 1878, when,
amongst the scrub, a few build-
ings were erected. Two hotels
? The Pinkerton ? and
the ?Transcontinental? ?
had been completed and opened
by 1883, and the completion
of the Quorn, Terowie and
Great Northern lines happened
in 1882. The township gradu-
ally expanded, and in 1884
was declared a Municipality,
the first Mayor being sworn in
j o
on November 28 of that year.
There is little doubt that the
creditable manner in which the
town is laid out is due in a
great extent to the foresight of
the original Councillors, and
the magnificent strides this
town has made is to a great
extent due to many of the old
residents, amongst whom are
such identities as Messrs.
Hunt THE MEMBERS OF THE QUORN CORPORATION. Photo
Thompson, Jaffray, F'oster,
Matthews, and Geo. Shephard,
who still take an active interest
in the welfare of Quorn.
The old residents, and even
the younger ones, have passed
through very severe times, but
in spite of the many rebuffs
Hunt THE QUOIT GROUND, QUORN. Photo
have weathered the storm, and
it can very honestly be stated
that they are at the present
time reaping the pleasure and
advantage of Quorn?s
solid prosperity. The wheat
harvest has been an excellent
one this year, and thousands
upon thousands of bags have
been railed from Quorn during
the past few weeks by the
energetic Farmers? Union
Agent, Mr. G. Duncan Watt.
And apropos the above, one is
glad to notice that
all the wheat is being sold by
the farmers to their own Union
this year with satisfactory
results.
The present Mayor is Mr.
Robert Thompson, who has
occupied the position in a most
praiseworthy manner for man}'
years. No one has worked
harder, and is doing so at the
present time than he, to ad-
minister the public affairs of
the town in a suitable manner,
and he loses no opportunit} 7
of pushing ahead the town.
Mr. Thompson was one of
the pioneers, having arrived
in 1878, and is known and
recognised as one of the most
courteous, obliging and level-
headed Mayors in the Far
North.
Quorn is fortunate in secur-
ing such a fine bod} r of Coun-
cillors who are to be compli-
mented on the manner in which
they carry out their onerous
duties on behalf of the towns-
people. The following are the
present ones :-Messrs. Thomp-
son (Mayor), O. Bockleberg,
C. E. Druch, J. Daglish, J. W.
Galvin, H. Matthews, Newitt,
W, L. Hudson andG, J. Shep-
hard. The Town Clerk is Mr.
A. M. Jaffrey. He is proving
a decidedly popular and ener-
getic one.
Probably the finest public
building is the Town Hall,
which was built, or rather com-
pleted in 1891. It is a solid
handsome stone structure, and
fulfils all requirements. The
Institute adjoins, and is well
supplied with up-to-date litera-
ture, and many thousands of
the most sought-after books
and works of reference. The

homes at night, and draws
them into the shops. The
sanitary state of Quorn is excel-
lent, and the death rate in 1908
?seven per the whole popula-
tion is a great record, and demo-
strates the not sufficiently well-
known fact that Quorn is one
of the healthiest towns in Aus-
tralia. There is absolutely not
a vacant house in Quorn, and
although buildings are gradu-
ally being erected, yet the
demand is greater than the
supply. Also, another fact
worth recording is that in 1908
only Us. 3d. remained unpaid
on the Town rates. This
breathes prosperity?at one
time it was difficult to collect
11s. 3d. out of several hundred
outstanding accounts.

WHEAT AT QUORN STATION,
The streets are well laid out
?metalled, and the footpaths
excellently formed. The people
are well provided for by the
various sects. The Methodist
Church is a handsome little
building, which claims many
adherents. Then there is the
Church of England, Catholic,
and in Quorn, as elsewhere,
the glorious Salvation Army
raises its standard, and puts in
good workin thesavingofsouls,
and taking round the c?lection
plate. There are four hotels?
The Criterion, Grand Junction,
Transcontinental and Pinker-
ton. Each is well managed
and conducted, and reflects
credit on the licencees. The
business done by each at the
present time is a solid one, and
recompenses them for the many
lean years they went through.
QUORN AS A TOURISTS*
RESORT.
Quorn is a tine little Town,
with many natural beauties
surrounding it, and offers to the
tourist a pleasant and memor-
able holiday. The air is ex-
ceptionally' bracing ?clear and
pure. Even in summer, al-
though it be decidedly' hot,
the heat doesn?t depress one.
The peculiar clearness?crisp-
ness it may' be, seems to prevent
one from feeling tired or de-
pressed. Then at night one
can always rely' on a delightful
sea-breeze from Port Augusta
direction.
During the visitors? stay', he,
if a lover of rugged natural
scenery', will find many places
of interest- One of the
finest drives which the writer
had the pleasure of taking
through the courtesy of Mr.
Bruse, was to Warren?s Gorge
(photos of which appear), situ-
ated some 13 miles from Quorn.
The country passed through
is most magnificent, also many
farms, with wheat crops newly
taken off, rather interest one,
and illustrate the tenacity?
real bull-dog pluck of the far-
mers who fought against all
kinds of bad luck ?the princi-
pal of which, of course, is ?rain
failure,? they have gone on, and
during the past few years have
appreciated the meaning of the
word ?prosperity.? At the
end of the thirteen miles drive
Warren?s Gorge is reached,
and one has the pleasure of
srazingf on the wonderful

effect of nature. A creek
runs quietly through the gorge
and this adds to the comfort of
the picnickers. The writer has
visited the Narracoorte Caves,
Mt. Gambier, and every other
portions ot South Australia,
and willingly awards this
rugged scenery at the Gorge
first place. The Cataract
Gorge in Eaunceston, Tas-
mania, cannot be compared
to it. There are many other
places equally interesting and
quite sufficient to cause the
visitor to feel he has had a
very pleasant, instructive, and
interesting stay in the Quorn
district.

M R - O. BOCKELBERG carries on his business as a Jeweller, Watch-

experienced one. His premises contain a choice stock of Gold, Silver
and Plated ware, which can be purchased at City Prices. Air Bockelberg
is noted for his fairness in business, and as he points out it always pays
to supply Pfirst-class Articles, and at a Reasonable Price. Repairs are
executed by thoroughly competent workmen on the premises, and orders
by post receive prompt attention.

J. H. WRIGHT carries on the business of a Fruiterer, Confec-
tioner, etc., also a large trade, which is an entirely different
department, is done in Fancy Goods. For eleven years entire satisfaction
has been given to the townspeople, and they can always rely on receiving
the best of fruit obtainable that is in season. Groceries?a large stock
are always kept, and Mr. Wright?s turnover is considerable. Mrs.
Wright takes an active interest in the business, and it is worthy of
mention that she (whose father was the late Mr. G. Pickering?a
gentleman much respected by all who had had the pleasure of his
acquaintance) was one of the first arrivals in the Quorn district ?that
was in 1870. Air. Wright is an attentive business man and a progressive
one. He believes in giving his customers the best articles, the best only,
and probably his genial personality has much to do in the successful
development of his business.
Mr. A. J. Millard?s Saddlery Depot.
A. J. MILLARD has been in business as a Saddler and Harness
Alaker during the past sixteen years in Quorn, and has established a
reputation for good, honest, solid work, and leatherware that is of the
highest quality. His customers are legion, and repairing work is received
from as far north as Pine Creek. His premises are well stocked, and the
various lines are obtainable at prices which compare favorably with those
of Adelaide. Air. Alii lard is a member of the Kanyaka District Council,
and is the energetic Secretary of the Quorn branch Druids Lodge. He
is a man of his word and one, farmers and townspeople, have always
found true to his principle?? the principle of a man.?
THE ECONOMIC MANUFACTURING COY.
'J'HE ECONOMIC MANUFACTURING COMPANY, whose principal
businesses are in Adelaide, showed commendable foresight in estab-
lishing a branch of their business in Quorn, and, judging by the magnifi-
cent support they have received are thoroughly satisfied. They are
manufacturers and sellers for cash, and thus are able to give the public
the advantage derived from doing business on these principles. The
Quorn Store is a well-stocked one, containing two departments?Grocery
and Drapery ?also an Ironmongery one. The ladies have not been for-
gotten in Millinery, and the writer noticed many chic dainty creations
on show?and, of course, for sale as well. It is intended shortly to
greatly enlarge the present premises?the proprietor thus practically
illustrating his belief in the ? solidness ? of the District and Town, and
his satisfaction at the business return. Although the firm has only been
established some eight months in Quorn they have enjoyed much pros-
perity, and the writer has little doubt that their enterprise will be well re-
paid. The firm offer excellent quality, and being manufacturers and
? cash dealers? are able to sell at very little above ? ? cost price,? and that is
really what the public appreciate?Cheapness combined with Quality.

? ]y[R. ROBERT THOMPSON,
the Chief Magistrate of
Quorn, was born at Dunfermline,
Scotland, on October 3, 1858. He
attended St. Leonards Works School
and when ten years old was sent
out as a shepherd and farm lad.
At twelve years of age he was ap-
prenticed to the trade of a wheel-
wright. For two years he worked
in Glasgow and Edindurgh. He
then emigrated to South Australia,
and arrived at Port Adelaide by
thes.s. ? Aconcagua ? on December
10, 1879. He removed to Quorn in
1880, where he worked at his trade
as journeyman carpenter for nearly
five years. Subsequently he went
into business on his own account,
and has now a thriving General
Store. He was introduced to
municipal work as Town Councillor
in 1885. In 1892 he was the chosen
representative of the parents on
the School Board of Advice at
Quorn, and in 1894 was elected
Chairman. In June, 1893, he was
gazetted a Justice of the Peace.
For a number of years he has been
a member of the Foresters and
Rechabite Lodges, and has passed
through the various offices of each
Society.?

an active Cabinet Minister in
the ?Holder,? ?Jenkins,? and
?Butler? Ministries, holding the
portfolios of Minister of Works,
Railways, and Agriculture. At the
last election the Hon. Foster was
defeated by 60 votes. He is a far-
seeing business man, and has been
a great advocate for years of ? ? closer

for the opening of the Pinnaroo
country. Time and time again he
fought in and out of Parliament for
the building of the railway to
Pinnaroo, and was one of the first

the Flinders county, and the writer
will be greatty surprised if the Hon.

his candidature at the next election.
He possesses indomitable pluck,

Dressmaking is carried out on the premises. A large number
of hands are employed, and the services of an experienced and
clever lady in Miss Wilson have been secured. A large Tailor-
ing trade is also carried on with satisfactory results to both
customers and the Proprietor, who combines exceptional keen-
ness with fairness to his many hundreds of customers. The
Store under review is a General Store in the thorough meaning
of the word, and its prosperity was never greater than to-day.

]yj�. HENRY WATERS is one of the most Progressive Business Men
in the ? North.? For twenty years he was connected with the firm
of Dunn & Co., Millers, some nine years of that time acting successfully
as Manager. Some five years ago he started in Quorn on his own account,
and deals largely in Groceries, Confectionery, and controls a very suc-
cessful Bakery Department. The bread turned out by Mr. Waters is a
first-class production, and Catering is carried out liberally and satis-
factorily. Connected with the business are Chaff Mills, which are actively
employed the whole year. Thousands of bags are despatched monthly
to Far Northern Towns, and the only difficulty Mr. Waters experiences
is in supplying the demand. Mr. Waters is Messrs. George R. Wills?
Wheat-buying Agent, and a very fair share of cereal is secured by him.
He is also Quorn Agent for the South British Insurance Co. His premises
are up-to date ones, occupying a commanding position in Quorn, and the
Proprietor is to be complimented on the excellent manner in which his
business is carried on. It is very greatly his intense energy that placed
him in such a solid and flourishing position to-day.

Kalioota Station, which contains
some 160 miles of fine fattening
country, and carries about 1,000
cattle and 100 head of horses. The
Willochra Creek runs through the
property, and a dam has been made,
which throws the water some ten
miles broad over the country. Mr.
Salmon, who was the first man to

QAPTAIN J. A. WATT ranks amougst the best, straightest and most
humane Publicans of Australia. He is Proprietor of the ? Grand
Junction Hotel,? Quorn, and since his tenancy commenced some three
years ago his trade has been a quickly-increasing one, and the business
to-day has never been better managed, and in a more flourishing condi-
tion. The Hotel is two-storied, and is in close proximity to the Railway
Station. A balcony surrounds the Hotel, and the interior comforts are
all that one could wish. There is a large card room adjoining the bar,
where large numbers attend nightly to pass away a pleasant and inex-
pensive few hours? recreation. A billiard room, well fitted up and con-
ducted, is connected with the Hotel, and receives much support. Every
care is taken by the Landlord to promote comfort, and every night the
commodious and numerous sleeping apartments at ? ? The Grand Junction? ?
are occupied. The table is an excellent one, and sumptuous repasts are
the invariable rule. ? The Grand Junction ?in phort is an Hotel excel-
lently conducted by a splendid Landlord. Captain Watt, D.5.0., V.D.,
served in the South African War with great distinction, and led the Fifth
Contingent from South Australia. Previous to taking over the Hotel
under review he was connected with the firm of Milne & Co., Wine and
Spirit Merchants, as Commercial Traveller, and although his bluff hearty
manner is missed on the roads, yet it can still be appreciated at ? The
Grand Junction.? Captain Watt has been far from well of late, but the
writer trusts that his indomitable pluck and ?iron ??constitution will pull
him through, and he will regain his former self. A porter meets all
trains, and this Hotel is strongly recommended to the public of S.A.

GEORGE R. COBBIN is proprietor of a well-stocked Chemistry
business in Quorn. He has now been established some ten years,
and has become possessed of a splendid reputation professionally.
The purest of Drugs are used, and a large assortment of Fancy
Goods, Toilet Requisites, etc., are on hand. It is seldom
that a country town enjoys the advantage of a qualified
resident dentist, and the public of Quorn should consider themselves
fortunate in this respect. Mr. Cobbin has done .some fine dentistry work,
and in his surgery he has advantages of treating cases with the most up-to-
date appliances. The writer is glad to note that Mr. Cobbin?s skill as a
dentist is recognised by residents of the town and district who feel that
while they can receive the best treatment desirable and suitable work, it
is their duty to support the local professional man. Many ?visiting?
dentists charge enormous prices and give but poor satisfaction, knowing
they may never visit the town again, and also they are not dependent on
that particular town. Mr. Cobbin?s reputation has grown slowly
and surely, and patients can rely on receiving every attention?good
work ?a guarantee re satisfaction, and the satisfaction that if the work
isn?t good they will be able to call again and make the fact known.
Probably *t he best advertisement Mr. Cobbin could possibly receive lies
in the fact that his business has increased greatly, and is still doing so.
Also that practically all the dentistry of the town and district is now
carried out In him.

every comfort one can possibly desire. The table kept is an excellent
one, and the drinks offered are the best and true to name. Mr. Heaslip
has the cordial assistance of his wife in conducting the business, and in a
great measure its success is due to her tact and good management of the
domestic portion of the establishment. Mr. Heaslip is one of the genuine

FARMERS? CO-OPERATIVE UNION.
GEORGE DUNCAN WATT, the Quorn?Willochra?
Kingswood Agent for the Farmers? Co-Operative Union,
is probably one of the most successful wheat buyers in South
Australia. Up to the year 1905 the ? Union ? were able to pur-
chase but a few hundred bags per season, but since the advent
of Mr. Watt in 1906-7 the turnover has risen to 25,000 per
season. The Quorn Agent has shown to the farmers the ad-
vantages to be derived from selling to their own Union, and has
added many shareholders during 190 S. In all fairness it should
be pointed out that the fact that the disclosures made in evidence
given defore the ? Wheat Commission ? have practically killed
(commercial) one man, and who is certainly not ?loved? by
the farmers since his methods have been so painfully laid bare.
In fact, his name is as little respected in S. A. as at Broken Hill.
Mr. Watt, with his intense vigor, application to business, and
fair and square business methods, has not been slow to take
advantage of the situation, with the gratifying result that,
practically this season he is the only real live wheat bu\ T er in
Quorn and District, and has secured four-fifths of the wheat.
Mr. Watt is also Secretary of the Quorn Racing Club. When
he took over the position ?the Club was some ,�7O in debt,
but through the judicious management of the Secretary the above
MR. P. HOWARD KNOX.
Messrs. Humphries & sons, ltd.,

energetic young representative for the far
northern towns as Mr. P. Howard Knox.
He is popular right through the North, and

y[R. ALBERT E. ABBOTT has been
most successful since taking over
Miss Lewis?s Stationery business some

'THIS Well known Establishment was started by Mr. Matthews
as far back as ISS6, and like many other successful ventures,
started on much smaller dimensions than it assumes at the present
day. The shop has had to be enlarged at great expense on several
occasions in order to meet the ever-increasing demands of a grow-
ing tiade. Until now it is looked upon as one of the largest
country businesses, and has placed the proprietor in the enviable
position of being the largest private employer of labor in Quorn.
There are in the various departments Tailoring Dressmaking
Millinery, Drapery Boot Palace, Grocery, and Ironmongery.
Between 20 and 30 hands are constantly employed, and one cannot
help thinking that it is an enterprise such as this which ought to be
encouraged, as it tends to built up our country towns, and not as has
been the case so much in the past, encourage the city at the expense
of cur own town. There is a large wholesale business done at the
Cash Import Stores, and this fact alone must be of great service to
the proprietor in enabling him to buy in larger quantities. As it is,
the name of the proprietor is known all over the North, right up to
the Northern Territory, ana the writer believes favor ably known for
square dealing. The proprietor informs me that the chief cause of
his success has been the buying in the cheapest market for spot
cash. He has been importing his Drapery direct from the factory
for the last 22 years, and then selling only reliable goods at the
lowest payable profit. Customers will come again and again where
they know they receive honest vaKie. And this can only be done
where the goods are ? directly imported.? We may say that as an
employer Mr. Matthews stands very high, it being generally
conceded that his assistants are well paid, and the fact that he has
so many married men in his employ speaks volumes. In conclusion
whilst Quorn own's such citizens there should be no fear of the
future. Mr. Matthews has had good training both here and
in Manchester, and no doubt the years spent in commercial
travelling for one of the largest wholesale houses in Adelaide helped
to fit him foi the position he now holds.

bend of Spencers Gulf, the
ground rising gently from the
shore to a small hill on the
east, whereon is erected the
Roman Catholic Cathedral,
and is an ideal site for a town.
From the summit of the hill
one of the finest views obtain-
able in the State is to be seen.
Mountain, river, and plain are
extended in panorama. On
the East rises the magnificent
Flinders Range, which can be
seen for 40 miles, with Mount
Brown 3,001 feet in height in
in the centre, and Mount
Arden further North, On the
West is seen a long low range
of hills with the Lincoln Gap
prominently breaking the
centre of the chain. Whilst
at one?s feet is seen the ever
widening Gulf stream, which,
flowing South, opens out into
the wider reaches of Spencers
Gulf, To the right nestles
the town embowered in trees
with which the streets are
planted, and rising clear from
them is seen the dome of the
Town Hall. Entering the
harbour by steamer the visitor
will note the fine wharfage
accommodation, at the rear of
which the large wheat stacks
fill a large space, whilst further
to the rear are seen the large
wool stores of Messrs. Young
and Gordon, Farmers Union,
John Darling & Son, and Elder,
Smith & Co., Ltd., capable of
accommodating large consign-
ments of produce.
Commercial Road is seen to
be a fine wide well-paved and
metalled modern street, flanked
with fine business premises,
hotels, and public buildings,
post office, institute, town hall,
and police offices and court-
house buildings. At right
angles to Commercial Road
runs Mackay and Jervois
Streets, in which are situated
the town -squares, and Glad-

stone square is the first and
contains a splendidly equipped
quoit ground, with stage and
acetylene plant for open air
performances, and a central
grass plot in which a fine
monument to the late Mr. A.
D. Tassie, one of the founders
of the town; further on is
situated Disraeli square, on
which are four asphalt tennis
courts the best of their kind.
Adjoining Gladstone Square is
the waterworks building offices
and work shops replete with
every convenience. Facing
Jervois Street is the court-
house, an up-to-date building,
designed by the architect in
chief of the day, Mr. Wood,
from suggestions by the late
sheriff, Mr. Boothby. The
structure was erected in 1884
and was one of the first build-
ings in which Kapunda marble
was used It is supposed to
be the finest building of its
kind in the State, and cer-
tainly has the distinction of
not being equalled by any
other country courthouse.
Returning to Commercial Road
the town hall will claim notice.
The building is two storied,
with Corinthian front and large
domed tower ; the hall is one
of the largest out of Adelaide,
and possesses a fine stage with
well equipped scenery, piano,
and ever} 7 requirement neces-
sary for theatrical work. The
floor is of Kauri and is an
ideal one for dancing. The
building has a large number
of rooms, council chambers,
and offices, and is lighted with
acetylene gas by a Trescow-
thick Generator. The build-
ing erected in 1885 cost,
with furnishing and lighting,
,�6,000, and was designed by
Messrs. Black & Hughes, of
Adelaide, Architects. The
Institute adjoins, and is a most
compact building with large
hall, reading room, museum,
and library. Mr. E. Gold is
in charge, having held the
office of librarian for over a
quarter of a century. The
post office completes the
government and public build-
ings, and is situate on the
corner of Commercial Road
and Mackay Street, and has
lately been renovated and
placed in an up-to-date condi-
tion. Mr. G. H. Field
is in charge. The rail-
way station lies at the
southern entrance to the town,
as also are the railway clean-
ing sheds and carriage sheds.
The State school is a
large and handsome build-
ing capable of accommodat-
ing 350 scholars, and i c under
the control of Mr. J. Newton,
The hospital is situated on
Cudmore Hill a mile and a
half from the Port, and
consists of a large pile of
buildings with accommodation
for 50 beds. The equipment
is up-to-date ; during this year
a modern sterilising plant and
operating appliances have been
installed in the operating
theatre. The institution is
under the charge of Sister
Nason with an efficient staff of
nurses. Mr. F. T. Carrig is
Secretary and dispenser. Mr.
T. Hunter is Chairman of the
House Committee. The
Masonic Hall in Mackay Street
is a new building of handsome
proportion with corinthian
front and cement dressings;
the hall is 38 x 28, with
banquetting hall 28 x 18.
The building was designed by
Mr. J. Holdsworth, Town
Surveyor.
We cannot close this section
of our sketch without being
seized of the fact that Port
Augusta is an up-to-date town
doing a large business, and
when the Commonwealth takes
over the line to the North, and
West Australian Railway is
built, the Port will be one of
the foremost shipping centres
in the State.
HISTORICAL.
The name Augusta was
chosen in honour of the wife
of Governor Young. The
town was surveyed by sappers
and miners under Mr. Nott
in 1854, and the first land sale
was held in August, 1854,
Town sites being sold for ,�B,
and water frontages for ,�l5.
In the same year Elder Stir-
ling & Co. started a store
managed by Mr. A. D. Tassie,
who afterwards bought out the
firm and founded Tassie and
Co. In 1867 Bignell & Young,
now Young & Gordon, com-
menced business.
CORPORATION.
In 1875 the Corporation was
formed, the first Mayor being
Mr. J. Me Turk. Gibson.
Messrs. S. C. Trewenack, H.
Johnson, A. Mackay, and G.
Cobbin, Councillors, and Mr.
T. Burgoyne the Veteran M.P.
Town Clerk. Fifteen Mayors
have held office, the longest
terms being served by T.
Young, nearly 5 years; C. E.
Robertson, 6 years; and T.
Hewitson, LL.B., 8 years
continuously. The Town
Clerks have been T. Burgoyne,
G. F. Bond, E. Goodall, and
J. Holdsworth, the present
Clerk, who has held office for
21 years. Health Officers
have been Drs. W. Markham,
R. E. Shunter, A. Chenery,
and J. Riddell. The present
Council consist of Mr. A. E.Car-
rig, Mayor; Messrs. W. Har-
den, A. W. Gosden, F. A May,
J. Roberts, T. Tottman, C. A.
Neindorf, W. G. Innes, T.
Young, J.P., Councillors; and
Health Officer, Dr. J. Riddell,
M.8.8 S. ; Auditors, A. Le B.
McLaughlin, R. Hall; Town
Clerk and Surveyor, J. Holds-
worth, J.P. The first Assess-
ment totalled ,�5,185; the
value of property gradually
rose until in 1886 it reached
,�27,187 ; at present it is down
to ,�9,200. In 1882 the Great
Northern Railway system was
completed to Port Augusta
and Adelaide, and the place
boomed. Since that, owing to
the 8 years drought, the
values of property decreased,
but during the last 4 years
the good seasons have sent a
wave of prosperity back to the
old place, and it is one of the
soundest towns in the State.
In addition to the Port
Augusta Council there are the
Devenport Corporation with
Mayor, J. N. Conway, and
Town Clerk, R. Hall, at the
head ; and the Port Augusta
West Council with Mayor, J.
Harris, and F. V. Sanderson
as Town Clerk. The District
Council of Woolundunga has
its centre at Stirling North,
the Chairman being Mr. A.
Barrett, and Clerk, Mr. N.
Rogers.
INSTITUTE.
The Institute Hall has ac-
commodation for 400. The
Officers are : ?President, Dr.
J Riddell; Secretary, E. Gold;
and Committee, Messrs. J.
Holdsworth, F. Pybus, A. M.
Hardy, A. Both well, R. N.
Dewhirst, S. S. Bice, and Rev.
H. A. Gunter. The Library
contains 4,000 volumes, and
has the finest Technical Works
in the State, and its Museum
has many rare specimens on
its shelves.
INDUSTRIES.
The leading industry is that
of Thomas & Co., Millers.
The mill, a large three-story
one, was erected by J. Dunn
and Co., and is fitted with the
latest pattern Roller Milling
Machinery. The product
turned out being accounted the
best milled flour in the Com-
monwealth. The industry
employs a large number of
men, and is under the manage-
ment of Mr. Thomas Hunter,
a well known expert in the
wheat and flour business.
Mr. George Roberts occupies
the position of miller.
The South Australian
Brewing Coy. have the largest
establishment of its kind in
the North. At present the
Brewerv is not used, the firm
supplying their ale from the
central brewery in Adelaide,
the Company using their
premises for storage purposes
and distributing their goods to
all parts of the North from it.
The aerated water factor} 7 ,
however, occupies a large
portion of the premises (which
cover by the way over half an
acre), and the finest of mineral
waters are turned out, Mr. A.
W. Gosden being the firm?s
Factory Manager. Mr. F. A.
May is in charge of the Com-
pany?s business, and is one of
the most popular business men
in the North.
Messrs. C. Geddes & Co.
have the largest timber mill in

most modern machinery. The
firm has very large stocks of
timber; their yards and sheds
covering over two acres. The
firm does a large trade with
the far North/ Mr. W. G.
Innes is the local Resident
Manager.
CHURCH ES.
The Churches of the Town
are large commodious build-
ings of much architectural
merit, and can accommodate
more than the population
requires. They are the
Church of England (Rector,
Rev. F. W. Wilkinson, M.A.),
Methodist (Rev. H. A. Gun-
ter), Presbyterian (Elder, J.
Holdsworth in charge), and
Roman Catholic Cathedral, in
the care of the Rev. Father'
Kirby ; the Bishop of the
Diocese is the Very Rev.
Father Norton who resides at
Petersburg. The Church
attendances at the various
places is very good. The
Salvation Array are also re-
presented by Captain Lister
and Lieutenant Sinton.
SPORTING CLUBS.

as Chairman, and Mr. J.

for the public at New Year?s
time, the Regatta last year
drawing 2,000 people to the
Town. The Dog and Poultry
Show has had a most success-
ful career, but last year went
into recess owing to lack of
of exhibits. The popular
Secretary is Mr. H B.
McDonald, who has promise
of holding a show this season.
The Band under Mr. S. W.
C, Young is a prominent
feature of the town life, lending
itself in every way to philan-
thropic effort, and is most
popular. The Band has �135
worth of instruments which
are vested in the Town
Council.
Dodges of the Foresters,
American Odd Fellows, Man-
Chester Unity, Rechabites, are
represented, the respective
Secretaries being S. S. Bice,
J. Holdsworth, J, N. Conway,
T. B. Harris. The member-
ship is large and compares
favourably with other towns.
Mr. White is one of the,
oldest residents in Port Augusta
having arrived there in 188 D
He controls a large and flourish-
ing business, and is a most
popular man. He has been a
member of the Devonport
Council for some 6 years, but
at the last Municipal election
was prevented from ?stand-
ing? on a technical point.
At the next one, however,
Mr. White will be in evidence,
and there is little doubt the
rate-payers will appoint such a
conscientious man, as Mr.
White is, to guard over their
interests.
Mr. William Hunt is the
North and Far North Photo-
grapher, and undertakes work
in every town. His studio is
at Quorn, and the very credit-
able photos that appear in this
publication speak strongly in
favour of Mr. Hunt?s artistic
taste. Work entrusted to him
is carried out expeditiously,
and great care is taken to
secure a good picture. He is
exceptionally painstaking with
children?s photos. Quorn and
district are distinctly fortunate
in having the services of such
an excellent artist as Mr. Hunt.
YOUNG & GORDON, Universal Providers,
Shipping, Forwarding, Insurance and General Commission Agents.
We solicit the favors of Station Owners, Storekeepers,
-
Hotels, and Private Family Trade.
'JpHE present great and flourishing busi-
ness iconcern now carried on in Port
Augusta under the name of Young & Gordon
first saw the light of the commercial world
in 1867. The foundation stone was laid by
Mr. Thomas Young and Mr. F. Bignell,
the style of the firm being Young & Bignell,
At first the business was wholly Drapery,
but later other general storekeeping
departments were added, and the firm
gradually developed. Additional buildings
being erected as required. Mr. Bignell
retired after a number of years association
with Mr. Young, and Mr. Gordon joined
the firm, and trade has been conducted
under the name of Young & Gordon ever
since. The writer has refrained from
going too lengthy into the original history,
of this wonderfully active and important
firm, preferring to dwell on the present.
The firm can very fairly be classed as
?Universal Providers.? Their business
extends (right through the Far Northern
towns, and goods are conveyed by camel
teams into Queensland. The firm under
review have even supplied, years ago, the
West Australian Mines with stores.
There are various buildings used for
different Departments, but the chief one
contains the Drapery, Grocery Iron-
mongery, Boots, Men?s Wear and Millinery
Departments. This is a fine two-storied
building, with seven plate glass windows,
enabling the firm to show off to the greatest
advantage portion of goods offered. On
Saturday evenings it is quite interesting to
notice the large crowds engaged purchasing
in each Department. In very many towns
the country people wait until they visit
Adelaide, or do their ?shopping by post ?
in many articles of wear and consumption,
but ?tis not so in Port Augusta?it is un-
necessary?Messrs. Young & Gordon are
keen buyers, and have a stock to select from
in any Department equal to any business in
Adelaide, either in quality, quantity, or up-
to-dateness ; also, another important point,
their prices are most reasonable. They buy
in large quantities, and thus secure a big
discount, which the customer receives the
advantage of. An idea can be gained of the
great business this firm does in the simple
fact that some 70 hands are permanently
engaged. This means that over 200 people
aie directly interested in securing their
living through the firm, and clearly
illustrates that Port Augusta has much to
thank them for.
Messrs. Young & Gordon also control the
shipping and forwarding work at Port
Augusta and are Agents for vat ions
Hunt YOUNG & GORDON?S PORT AUGUSTA?S EMPORIUM. P/iotv
shipping companies. Great quantities of
goods are monthly forwarded to Far Nor-
thern Towns, right up to the Queensland
Border. They also hold an Agency for Fire
Insurance, Life and Accident, and transact
much business in this Department.
There are several large bulk stores, and it
might be mentioned that the frontage of the
principal building is 113 feet, with a similar
depth. There are seven different windows
for the various Departments, and the Dress-
making Department is an extremely active
one, in charge of a first-class designer and
manageress. Tailoring is another branch
Messrs. Young & Gordon have been very
successful in, and since its inception practi-
cally every suit worn in Port Augusta and
District is turned out by the firm under re-
view. They are fortunate in having secured
a thoroughly experienced cutter, who, judg-
ing by the finish and style of suits sent out
takes great interest in his firm?s customers.
One fact emphasises itself very profoundly,
and that is, that there is no need for North
and Far Northern people to send to Ade-
laide for their ?made to order? clothing.
They can he well suited at Young and
Gordon?s. In the various Departments ?
Drapery, Millinery, Dressmaking Tailor-
ing, Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Grocery,
Produce, Ironmongery, Glassware Karthen-
ware, Wine and Spirit Store, and General
Wholesale Bulk Store?quite worth
of goods must be stocked. Then the firm
have a well-stocked and managed Branch at
Port Augusta West and Iron Knob, which
would probably bring the total well up to
We receive Clients? Goods trom Steamers, and forward
them on by earliest 'Trains or Teams.
This should emphasise to the
public what a large and enterprising firm
Young & Gordon are, and demonstrates the
big turn-over that must occur each year.
Mr. Thomas Young?s son, Mr. Bert
Young, is now connected with the firm,
and manages in a proficient manner the
Drapery, Tailoring, Clothing, Boots and
Shoes Departments. No doubt when Mr.
Young, Senr., decides to retire from active
commercial pursuits his son will have a
very thorough grasp of the whole business.
He is keen, courteous, and well-liked by
one and all, from the youngest employee
to the eldest, and, by the way, it might be
mentioned that many of this firm?s
employees have been continuously in their
employ since 1867. In concluding- this
brief article the writer feels it would be
incomplete not to speak of the great and
splendid personality of Mr. Thomas Young,
who, while a keen level-headed business
man, yet spares much of his time in assist-
ing in public matteis, and treats one iand
all of his employees in a most liberal
manner. F)ach year the firm hold a picnic
at the expense of the firm, and it invariably
proves a highly enjoyable function. Mr.
Young is one of the most unselfish iand
straightest men in Australia, and his
integrity and ability have been the great
factors in the success of the firm. He is a
great believer in the future of Port Augusta
and has put a considerable amount of
money in mineral prospecting syndicates.
He recognises that much mineral lies
undisturbed, though known to exist within
a hundred miles of Port Augusta, but lack
of inexpensive and satisfactory transports
makes it unprofitable. The writer feels
very strongly that ere many > r ears are past
there will be some big mines at work in
Flinders country. Mr. Young is a Justice of
the Peace, and has occupied the principal
Magistracy of Port Augusta. He is
respected and admired by all who have
come in contact with him, and he has well
earned the title, ?The genial F'ather of
Port Augusta.?

is looked forward to by everyone who takes an interest in racing in the North. It is
rightly called ? Port Augusta Carnival Week.? Visitors flock to Port Augusta from all
parts of the States,.also from Broken Hill. Many of the visitors book their rooms at
the different hotels from one year to the next. During Carnival Week two Balls are
given ; one by the Port Augusta Dance Club in conjunction with the Jockey Club, and
one by the Masonic Lodge. They are acknowledged to be equal to anything of the
kind given in the City. The President of the Club is Thos. Young, Esq., and the Sec-
retary, F. A. May, Esq. Both of these gentlemen put heart andsoulinto the work and are
greatly responsible for the continued and increasing popularity of the Club?s fixtures.

W. THOMAS & CO. rank
amongst the largest ai d most
important milling firms in the Com-
monwealth. The Head Office and
Principal Mi'l is at Port Adelaide, and
flourishing Branches are firmly estab-
lished at Northam and Pingelly in
Western Australia, and a magnifi-
cently fitted up one at Port Augusta,
which ?puts through? thousands upon
thousands of tons of ? North and Far
North ? wheat each year. The joint
capacity of the whole of Messrs.
Thomas & Co?s Mills is over six lons
per hour, . which means, a total
of over 800 tons per week.
The Port Augusta Mill, which is in
the capable hands of Mr. Thomas
Hunter, is a magnificent structure,
and is probably the only fire-proof
mill in Australia?the various floors
right throughout are laid with
solid Mintaro slate, on iron girder
joists; also, all spouts and con-
veyors are constructed of iron. The

and storing sheds, which are very
spacious, run right down to the water?s
edge, and Messrs. Thomas & Co, have
their own jetty, which is a great con-
venience in the shipping of flour.
Wheat is conveyed on the firm?s
private siding for manufacture,
and later on is despatched by rail as
flour, bran and pollard, to various
destinations. Messrs. W. Thomas and
Co.?s ? vStandard ? Roller Flour
has gained a world-wide reputation,
and when one seeks the reason that
station-owners and firms in tropical
parts require their manufacture so
persistently, it will be found that the
dry character of Ihe wheat grown in
the ? North ? makes it especially suit-
able foi its keeping qualities, strength
and color. There are various grades
of flour, and Messrs. W. Thomas & Co.
can very justly claim to manufacture
?an article that is not beaten for quality
in Australia. Their trade is an ever-
increasing one, and this surely testifies
in a practical manner that their
efforts at turning out the highest-
grade article possible are appre-
ciated.
