Gnowangerup District Road Board
To
Dear Sir/Sirs,
I desire, on behalf of my Board, to extend to
you the Season's Greetings.
Further, in compiling this Christmas Souvenir
we do so with the object of making better known within our own
State the potentialities of the Gnowangerup District, and as a
Local Governing body, desire to take part in assisting the Gov-
ernment of Western Australia to advertise the opportunities
which exist for the acquisition of land suitable for successful
farming, in the State's safe rainfall areas, of which this
District is one.
With best wishes.
E. [?]
CHAIRMAN.

■W _ 11E G now a nger u p JR c) a cl Dis-
// ~ trict was created in 1912, and
' v \ ' includes the Townsites of
4 / Gnowangerup. Borden and
''' Ongerup; it has a population
of 1700, and an area of 4005
square miles, or 2.563.200 acres.
The District is located in the South-West-
ern Land Division of Western Australia, sixty
miles North-East of the port of Albany, The
-urroundiiig Districts are Kent in the North;
Phillips River in the East; Hroomehill in the
West: Tambellup in the South-West, whilst
Albany and Flantagenet Boards join part of
the Southern boundary, the remainder being
coast-line extending from Cape Riche to
Doubtful Island, a distance of sixty miles.
Some of the oldest farms and homesteads
in the Great Southern area of the State are
situated in the Gnowangerup District; among
them is “Cape Riche.’’ which was selected in
1838 by Geo. Cheyne. This property later
passed into the hands of the Moir family, and
has been in their possession for three genera-
tions. Merino sheep were imported to Cape
.Riche from South Africa in 1841.
“Sandalwood,” also owned by the Moir
family, was selected by Andrew Moir early
in the 1840 period. The first crop of wheat
to be raised in what is now regarded as the
wheat area of the District was grown at
Sandalwood in 1845.
“Jerramungup,” a property comprising
18.000 acres of first-class grazing land, was
selected in the 1850 period by John Hassell,
and still remains in the ownership of the
Hassell family.
Although the above-mentioned properties,
and others, had been occupied for many years,
their owners were engaged chiefly in the
production of wool, and it was not until the
1900 period that the production of cereal
crops as a means of making a livelihood was
commenced. Statistics are not available nr un-
to 1908. hut a comparison of the figures
given below will give an indication of the
progress of the District during the twenty-
eight years which have elapsed.

SHEEP AND WOOL
11l the Gnowangerup District many of the
State's leading Merino Sheep Studs are situ-
ated. The quality of the stock is of high
standard, as results obtained at the West
Australian Koval Agricultural Society’s Shows
testify, many of the principal awards, both in
sheep and wool, being gained by exhibitors
from this District.
The Gnowaogerup Agricultural Society
caters for the exhibition of Merino Sheep at
its annual Slice]) Show, which is held in
September of each year. This is the only
exclusive Sheep Show in Western Australia,
and the exhibition of over 400 stud Merino
Slice)) is recognised as the best display of
sheep in the State.
The general Agricultural Show is held in
October, when various British breeds of sheep
and other stuck are exhibited.
With the establishment of Freezing Works
at Albany, fanners have started the breeding'
of Fat Lambs for export, with remarkably
successful results. The industry, while only
in its infancy, shows every indication of be-
coming an important branch of farming in
this district.
Figures for 1937 are not yet available, but the sea-
son just concluded promises to create a record for
the District in the production of wool,

WHEAT STATISTICS, ETC.
The Gnowangerup District is particularly
suited for the production of cereal crops, such
as wheat, oats and barley.
In 1931 the District annexed the “Cuming
Smith-Mt. Lyell” Wheat Shield, a trophy open
to State-wide competition, for the best aver-
age wheat yield per acre, over three seasons.
The “Bateman" Centenary Cup for the
highest wheat yield per acre, per inch of rain-
fall. was won by a farmer of Gnowangerup
with an average of 36 bushels per acre, for
279 acres.
In 1925 the Royal and District Agricul-
tural Societies inaugurated a State-wide
Wheat Crop Competition, for the highest yield
per acre over an area of 50 acres. Since the
inception of the competition twelve years ago,
the prize has been awarded to farmers of this
District on eight occasions.

THE DISTRICT’S AMENITIES
Among the amenities of the District is a
Concrete Swimming Pool, which is situated
within the Gnowangerup Townsite, and owned
by the Gnowangerup Road Board. The water
for the Pool is supplied by gravitation from
mineral springs discharging approximately
20,000 gallons daily.
Bremer Bay, which is located within the
District, provides a sea beach for bathing
equal, if not superior to any in the Southern
portion of the State, the waiter being Gear and
shallow, and well protected, and is, for that
reason, particularly safe for children and non-
swimmers. The Wellstead Estuary, which,
adjoins the camping area at Bremer, abounds
with fish of many varieties.
The Stirling Ranges form part of the
Southern Boundary of the District, and a
close-up view of the highest mountains in
Western .Australia (“Bluff Knoll,” 3640 feet,
and “Ellen Peak.” 3420 feet) can be obtained
by approach cither from Gnowangerup or
.Albany. There is a well-constructed road
through Chesters .Pass, in the Ranges, to
Albany,
