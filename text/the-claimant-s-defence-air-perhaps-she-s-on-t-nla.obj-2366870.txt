The Claimant's.
DEFENCE
Air-Perhaps she's on the Railway.
Come gatner round me one ana all,
And listen to my song,
It is about the Tichborne trial
Z Carried on so long :
Here and there and everywhere,
It is the talk we say,
What will be the Claimants'!fate

CHORUS.
Then perhaps you'll wait a little while
Till Roger does commence,
Perhaps you'll hear another tale,
When he makes his defence;
Perhaps he will, perhaps he wont
The Tichborne money get
Perhaps he'll prove himself to be
The real Sir Roger yet.
A regular crowd of witnesses
o
' Che Prosecution called,
Thev swear he's Arthur Orton now r
Who kept a butcher's stall;
I * *- V
Lawyers and tailors, soldiersjand sailors
Have now done all they can
Wont he turn the tables
I "V.i-f M ' . ' t
If he proves himself the man.
'
Some say that he was tattooed,
Some say that he was not,
And his head was thick and empty
As a forty shilling pot.
They say Roger was bled and blistered,
From his head down to his toes,
He had leeches on his ancles,
And a fish-hook in his nose.
They say the Claimant's very ill,
Body, and legs, and all,
Perhaps it is a wonder
That he's got any legs at all;
Pushed about from pillar to post,
Examined every day,
They've nearly turned him insidefout
For he couldn't get away.
If the Claimant's witnesses can prove
It's true what he has said,
What a lark if they should swear,
That Arthur Orton's dead
Perhaps they'll find another name.
And christen him so quick,
The Shah of Persia's mother,
Or the brother to old JST i«k.
Perhaps you very soon will hear
The Tichborne trial's done,
Perhaps the people will be glad
To know that Roarer's won :
O J
Let the swells think what they will,
Perhaps you all will say,
He kept his blooming pecker up,
He ought to win the day.
