Wonted ... A Snowy River Authority
Editorial Statement from "The Commonwealth Engineer,"
September, 1947
FED by the melting snows of Mount Kosciusko
in south-western New South Wales, the
Snowy river falls 7,000 ft before reaching
the sea at Orbost in eastern Victoria. Gaugings
since 1902 have shown the average flow of this
river to be 1,800 cusecs, with periods of high
floods. Here then is a highly valuable but un-
touched source of hydro-electric power and water
for irrigation. Australia urgently needs both
these “commodities” in increasing quantities for
industrial expansion and, agricultural develop-
ment, but particularly and urgently does it want
more power.
Harnessing of the Snowy river has been dis-
cussed, investigated and reported on by engineers
for a considerable period. Over 25 years ago the
construction of a small power plant was sug-
gested. In 1937 British consultants reported to
the New South Wales Government on a scheme
to provide 250,000 kW. Seven years later a
committee of engineers, again appointed by the
New South Wales Government, emphasised in
its report the value of the waters of the Snowy
river for irrigation rather than for power de-
velopment. The scheme put forward by this
committee was to provide a large storage of
650,000 ac.ft. at Jindabyne to receive water car-
ried by a tunnel 22 miles long. From the storage
the water would pass under regulated discharge
to the Murrumbidgee river. Power production
under this plan was to be only about 50,000 kW,
but a large area of new land was to be irrigated
south of the Narrandera and west of the existing
Murrumbidgee irrigation area to the Lachlan
river.
This plan for the utilisation of the Snowy river
completely within the borders of New South
Wales stimulated Victorian engineers to make
a study of the proposals. They developed a
plan in which the spotlight was moved back to
power generation. Briefly, their proposal was to
divert the Snowy into a tributary of the Murray
and to construct a series of power plants having
an aggregate capacity very much larger than
ever previously contemplated.
The position at this stage then was that one
State wanted to use the Snowy waters to develop
additional irrigation areas while a second State
was urging the use of the waters first for power
generation and then for irrigation. To try and
resolve this problem, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment arranged a conference in June, 1946, of
the interested parties. Arising out of this con-
ference the Commonwealth Department of Works
and Housing and the Department of Post-War
Reconstruction were asked to provide a report
on the most effective utilisation of the Snowy
river from the national rather than State aspect.
The report of these departments was com-
pleted early this year and came before the
Premiers’ Conference in August. This report
supports the Murray diversion plan and gives
details of works for the development of 668,000
kW from a series of underground power plants,
above and below Jindabyne. Several of the
power stations would be linked to serve New
South Wales and the remainder would transmit
to Victoria. This quantity of power would be
the equivalent of more than 1,000,000 tons of
coal a year. Cost of the Murray diversion
scheme is estimated at £66,000,000 for the
668,000 kW and the 830,000 ac.ft. of water to be
made available for irrigation.
This “national” report on the utilisation of the
Snowy river briefly reviewed above but explained
fully in this article is a very valuable
contribution, worthy of close study. The problem
has been both simplified and made more com-
plicated—simplified because it is now realised
that the problem transcends in importance State
interests and complicated, because much greater
works are involved. Clearly, harnessing of the
Snowy river will require planning and investiga-
tion, on a scale not previously attempted in
Australia. On the overwhelming evidence given
in the report the Commonwealth, New South
Wales and Victorian Governments should decide
forthwith upon the diversion of the Snowy river
into the Murray river as a long range project.
This should be followed by the establishment of
a properly constituted body—“ The Snowy River
Authority”—vested with adequate powers to plan,
•investigate, construct and control.

Abstract of Report by
Two Commonwealth Departments
Alternative proposals to divert the
Snowy river into tire Mumimbidgee river
or into the Murray river are compared in
a joint report by the Commonwealth Department
of Works and Housing- and the Department of
Post-War Reconstruction. The conclusions and
recommendations are
1. Based on tire enquiries made to date, there is
no reason for thinking that the proposal to
divert the Snowy river into the Murray river
is not practicable.
2. The probable cost of such a diversion to the
Murray .river would be £44,540,000 exclusive
of the cost of development of high level power
above Jindabyne (Case 1) and £65,880,000
inclusive of that cost (Case 2).
3. The amount of electric power available from
the two schemes is as follows; —

Case 1 . . 450,000 kW 46,000 kW
Case 2 , , 668,000 kW 256,000 kW

Snowy River Waters


4. The relative values of the two proposals from
the point of view of power likely to be
available are as follows:
' (a) (i) For an expenditure of a capital sum
of £44,540,000 the Murray diversion
proposal produces power and irriga-
tion water the capitalised value of
which is £42,600,000 in excess of the
total capitalised cost of the works.
For an expenditure of a capital sum of
£14,400,000 the Murrumbidgee diver-
sion proposal produces power and ir-
rigation water the capitalised value of
which is £570,000 in excess of the
total capitalised cost of the works.
(ii) If estimates relating to the develop-
ment of power above Jindabyne are
included, for an expenditure of a capi-
tal sum of £65,880,000 the Murray
diversion proposal produces power and
irrigation water the capitalised value
of which is £51,710,000 in excess of
the total capitalised cost of the works.
If estimates relating to the develop-
ment of power above Jindabyne are
included, for an expenditure of a capi-
tal sum of £34,300,000 the Murrum-
bidgee diversion proposal produces
power and irrigation water the capi-
talised value of which is £7,140,000
in excess of the total capitalised cost
of the works.
(b) The conclusion from the agricultural
and pastoral investigation is that
while the balance of advantage lies
with the use of the water in the Mur-
rumbidgee valley the water could be
used with excellent results in either
the Murray valley or the Murrum-
bidgee valley.
It would be practicable to divert the water
back to the Murrumbidgee valley for use on the
lands of that district even after it had been
originally diverted into the upper reaches of the
Murray. The agricultural and pastoral impli-
cations of this suggestion have not been worked
out in full but are worthy of investigation.
The general conclusion emerging from these
investigations is that a prima facie case has been
established for a complete investigation of the
proposal to divert the Snowy river into the
Murray river.
Recommendations
The following recommendations are made:—
(1) The proposal to divert the Snowy river into
the Murray river should be fully investigated
and should include a complete investigation
of the proposal to divert some or all of the
water back from the Murray to the Murrum-
bidgee valley.
(2) The investigation should include consideration
in general terms of the specific areas in
which the water might be used and of the
quantity of water which would be required
for these areas.
(3) Consideration should be given as to the
nature and terms of agreement which would
be required to give effect to recommenda-
tions arising out of the investigation.
(4) The investigation should be conducted by a
body consisting of representatives of the
three governments particularly concerned,
viz., Commonwealth, New South Wales, and
Victoria.
Engineering Aspects
A detailed investigation of the engineering
aspects of the alternative schemes of diversion
was carried out under the direction of Mr. L. F.
Loder, director-general, Department of Works
and Housing, by departmental officers, with the
co-operation of the water conservation authori-
ties. the electricity authorities, and the public
works authorities of New South Wales and Vic-
toria. and with the assistance of the Common-
wealth Army Survey.
Outline of Proposals
The two present proposals for the use of waters
of the Snowy river are briefly described below:—
(a) Diversion to the Murrumbidgee River
Briefly this scheme involves—
1. Dam at Jindabyne of 650,000 ac.ft. to provide
storage on the Snowy river.
2. Diversion tunnel about 22 miles long to Bridle
creek.
3. Pondage, flume, pipeline leading to power sta-
tion on Murrumbidgee river.
4. Dam on Murrumbidgee at Billilingera with
power station.
The water would be diverted from the Mur-
rumbidgee below Gundagai for use on lands in
the Murrumbidgee valley. The total power
available from the scheme is given at 46,000 kW,
plus an unspecified amount from the higher levels.
(b) Diversion to the Murray River
In brief outline the scheme as originally pro-
pounded was:—
1. Dam at Jindabyne as for the Murrumbidgee
diversion.


Plan of the suggested works for the Murray river diversion (left) and the Murrumbidgee diversion (right). The tunnel, 27
miles long, from the reservoir at Jindabyne to the Swampy Plain river, a tributary of the Murray, is shown as well as the
location of power stations 4A, 4B, 5 and 6. Near Mount Kosciusko the Spencer creek dam is seen and a tunnel 6 miles
long would lead to station 3, discharge from which would pass to the Snowy river. Stations 2 and 1 of this upper
Jindabyne development are also shown. Station No. 7 fed from the Eucumbene dam is at the centre right. At right is
shown the proposed tunnel for diversion of water from the Jindabyne dam to Bridle creek, thence to the Murrumbidgee.

river and discharge of water into the main
tunnel.
5. Development of power on Spencer catchment
above Jindabyne with high level storage and
three stations. The water from this develop-
ment would be discharged into the main tun-
nel.
The water would be used for irrigation on
areas which could be commanded from the Mur-
ray river. A preliminary figure of 700,000 kW
was given as the total power expected.
Method of Investigation
Comparison of the two proposals involved field
surveys and preparation of maps, examination of
existing river flow data, study of water power
storage possibilities, determination oi the out-
lines of design of a major power proposal, exami-
nation of possible transmission line routes, geo-
logical investigations, and determination of costs.
The basis of comparison of the two schemes
was capital cost and value of electric power pro-
duced and of water for irrigation made available.
Available Power
Murrumbidgee Diversion:
For the Murrumbidgee diversion the power
for the various steps is assessed as under: —
Allowance is made for a 10 p.c. loss in transmission to
load centres.
In addition to the power scheduled above, there
are theoretical possibilities of power development
on the Murrumbidgee river between Billilingera
and Burrinjuck. Because of the flat slope of the
river, however, power shemes would be very
costly. A preliminary study indicates that up to
185,000 kW at city load centres might be available
from this source. But on the estimated costs
this power is unlikely to be capable of economic
development, and in any case, would show no
appreciable saving over generation by thermal
stations.
For the Murray diversion the power for the
various steps is assessed as under; —
Here again allowance is made for a 10 p.c. loss
in transmission to load centres.
There is also a fall in the Swampy Plains river
below tail water level of step 1 which may war-
rant ultimate development, but no estimate has
been included.
Available Water
The value of water as a national asset is more
difficult to assess. However, the quantity of
water available is nearly the same for both pro-
posals so the problem is more one of determining
relative values in different areas.
Murrumibidgee Diversion
This scheme includes a dam at Billilingera
below the outlet of the tunnel. This would have
a large storage capacity, and would serve—•
(a) To even out deficiencies in water diverted
from the Snowy river.
(b) To regulate the water to the irrigation
requirements.
(c) To give further regulation to the Murrum-
bidgee river and so make more water
available for irrigation.
The total additional water available for irri-
gation is estimated to be 1,015,000 ac.ft. a year
derived as follows:


View of Spencer creek (at right) near snow-covered Mount Kosciusko (7,300 ft). Under the new Murray diversion proposals,
a storage dam on Spencer creek would impound (80,000 ac.ft.. and a tunnel about six miles long would lead to No. 3 under-
ground power station, capacity 68,500 kW maximum. Discharge from the station would pass to the Snowy river.
Site of the proposed dam on the Snowy river at Jindabyne, A diamond drilling plant is shown at left at work testing
foundation rock. The Snowy river, which has a catchment of 730 sq. miles and an average flow of 1,310 cusecs, is seen
in the centre background. The site of the drill is near the crest of the proposed dam.

Total 1,015,000 ae.ft.
Murray Diversion
With this diversion the needs of storages at
the outlet end would be somewhat different from
those for the Murrumbidgee diversion. The large
power development would necessitate a larger
tunnel which would enable water to be diverted
more in accordance with irrigation requirements.
In addition, a greater percentage of the Snowy
river would be diverted.
As the enlargement of the Hume reservoir
on the Murray at Albury is to be undertaken at
an early date, there is no need at present to pro-
vide storage for extra regulation of the Murray
liver itself.
To give a water supply for irrigation not less
than that available from the Murrumbidgee di-
version, the following works are allowed for:—
(1) Maximum storage at Jindabyne (approxi-
mately 180,000 ae.ft. more than for the
Murrumbidgee diversion).
(2) Storage on the Upper Murray of approxi-
mately 400,000 ae.ft. to give a regulated flow
from the Snowy river of 860,000 ae.ft,
(3) In addition, to make this proposal com-
pletely comparable with the Murrumbidgee
project it would, be necessary to provide
storage on the Murrumbidgee to give 185,000
ae.ft. for irrigation each year.
A total sum of £5,600,000 has been provided to
cover the cost of these works.
Practicability of Murray Diversion Proposal
Based upon investigations carried out to date
it is considered that the proposal to divert the
Snowy river to the Murray valley is a sound
engineering scheme.
With, regard to the main tunnel the geology
of the area is most important. From the geolo-
gical report there appear to be no reasons why
the tunnel could not be constructed, and it does
not appear to be likely that inflow water would
seriously hamper construction. As with any
major tunnel scheme, it would of course be es-
sential to carry out a complete investigation
Looking uphill from, (the site of the proposed dam at

before commencing construction, but from infor-
mation at present available the tunnel appears
to be quite practicable.
It is interesting to note that a tunnel of 13
miles has been recently constructed for the diver-
sion of water from the Colorado river in 4 years
without the use of adits or intermediate shafts.
The proposals for power production have all
been examined and they are considered to be
sound and practicable, and capable of economic
development.
In short, no evidence lias been found so far to
suggest that the proposal might be hazardous
or unduly difficult to construct.

Comparison of Proposals
Comparisons are given in Table 1 of capital
costs, annual charges, power available at cities,
water available for irrigation, annual values of
power and water, annual saving and equivalent
capitalised saving.
An annual value for water of If- per ac.ft.
has been assumed for both schemes. This is the
approximate cost of the water available from the
proposed diversion to the Murrumbidgee.
Annual values for power are based upon the
estimated costs at Sydney and at Melbourne from
equivalent amount of power generated by the
cheapest known alternative means. The two
proposals are compared for two steps as indi-
previously.
The “annual net return” is the difference between the
combined annual values of power and water and the
annual charges.
The “capitalised value of net return” is based upon
interest rates at 3 a p.c.
In arriving at the figures in Table 1 it was
assumed that for the Murray diverson scheme,
power would be supplied to both Sydney and
Melbourne, approximately in proportion to the
power demands of the two States, after making
allowance for future power reserved for the
Australian Capital Territory. For the Murrum-
bidgee diversion scheme, all power would be gene-
rated nearer to Sydney and would naturally be
supplied to that city.
It will be seen that the financial gain indicated
by the Murray proposal is as follows:
Step 1 . . . £42,030,000
Step 2 £44,570,000
In preparing the above figures it was assumed
that for the Murray proposal 860,000 ac.ft. of
water would be used annually in the Murray val-
ley. It is possible, however, to turn this water
back to the Murrumbidgee valley by gravity
flow, and thereby to provide irrigation water to
areas substantially the same in extent as those
proposed in the original Murrumbidgee scheme.
The preliminary estimate for the necessary works
is £4,000,000, and if this usage of the water were
decided upon, the capitalised net return by the
Murray scheme would then be: —
Step 1 £88,080,000
Step 2 £40,570,000
H'gher areas could be commanded by relatively
low head pumping if considered advisable, with-
out marked effect on the overall net return.
Advantages of the Murray Diversion Proposal
Chief advantages of the Murray diversion
would be the large amount of power which could
be cheaply produced. Savings over other known
means of generating the same quantity of power
are indeed substantial.
The scheme, while not precluding the use of
the water for the benefit of agricultural areas,
enables full development to be made of a really
great national asset. Nowhere else in Australia
is any comparable hydro-electric development pos-
sible. With the Murrumbidgee diversion only r.
portion of the full power can be developed, and
the capital costs per unit of energy would be
much higher. The remainder of the power, and
the benefits of the cheap costs of development,
would be lost.
_ The_ high expenditure involved in the Murray
diversion proposal may be used as an argument
against its development. It should be kept in
mind, however, that increasing demands for
power have to be met. To enable the same power
to be supplied by thermal stations, a capital
expenditure of over £30,000,000 would be re-
quired. If the costs of the Murrumbidgee pro-
posal chargeable to irrigation are added, and the
capital outlay for extra fuel winning, it will be
seen that capital expenditure approaching the
total cost of the Murray scheme would in any
case have to be faced.


So great is the saving which would be effected
by the Murray diversion that even if it were
found economically desirable to divert the water
back to the Murrumbidgee valley for use on the
lands of that district, the balance in favor of
the Murray proposal would still be very large
indeed. (Over £40,000,000 as indicated in Table 1).
It is to be noted that, if the net return shown
in Table 1 were used to reduce power costs,
power from the Murray scheme could be supplied
in bulk at a 30 p.c. reduction on ordinary rates.
This is indicated purely to show the economic
demands on the coal industry. This would bene-
fit all States which draw coal from the New South
Wales fields.
From the viewpoint of national defence there
is much to commend the scheme giving trie
greatest possible amount of hydro-electnc power.
The power stations would be less vulnerable than
the existing city stations and the coal fields of
New South Wales. In addition, this power could
be produced with a minimum of labor which is
of the utmost importance to Australia in time
of war.

advantages of this scheme. Actually still cheaper
power could be offered in country areas nearer
to the power stations, and this might be used
to promote decentralisation. Some of the saving
from this scheme could also be used to cheapen
the supply to farms and to country areas in
general.
The delivery of 600,000 kW of hydro-electric
power to the States of New South Wales and
Victoria would do much to relieve the growing
Details of Tunnel and Power Stations
Brief details are given below of the tunnel and
power plants.

The total length of the tunnel is 27.3 miles. In
addition there would be two inclined shafts from
surge tanks to power stations, total length
4,500 ft. The cross sectional area varies from
410 sq.ft, to 650 sq.ft.

Swampy Plains river at Khancoban. This river has a catchment area of 223 sq, miles and an average annual yield of
510.000 ac.ft. The proposed tunnel would discharge the Snowy river water into the Swampy Plains river, which is a
tributary of the Liver Murray.
Power Stations
Eight power stations are embodied in the Mur-
ray diversion scheme, the details of which are
as under:—
Power from the stations 1,2, 3, 6 'would be
transmitted to Sydney and that from the re-
mainder of the stations to Melbourne. The
distance from station 6to Sydney would be 264
miles arid from station 5 to Melbourne 228 miles.
