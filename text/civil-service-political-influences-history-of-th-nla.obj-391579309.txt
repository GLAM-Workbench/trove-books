It will be within the knowledge of the public that since the appearance of
these papers in the columns of the Sydney Mail and Echo, attention has been
much directed both in and out of Parliament to the history of the Wollongong
Line, and from remarks which have reached me 1 am induced to think the re-
production of the papers in collected form will prove acceptable to the public.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A vast subject truly.
Vast in its importance to us all by virtue of its present huge dimensions, and
which huge as they now be are growing as steadily and increasingly as the most
luxuriant and thriving upas tree that has ever yet reared its deadly umbrage, and
capable of very vast deadliness indeed towards all other healthful social life if its
present rate of growth remains unchecked.
Vast, too, in its mere commercial aspect when it is remembered that already
in this youthful colony whose hundredth anniversary is still uncounted, our
Civil Service numbers in its ranks of officers, sous-officers, and full privates, some
9000 of persons.
Think of it. One in every eighty of the population of the colony is a Civil
servant, or still more accurately to gauge the dimensions of this great political
machine, social evil, or human upas tree, whichever be its best cognomen, say,
omitting women and children from the count, that about one person of every
thirty of our adult male population is a “ Civil servant,” or in the employment
of the State.
“ But,” says an objector, “surely here be errors; the Blue Book contains
the names of not more than 5000 persons. Where are the other 4000 of whom
you speak ?”
The Blue Book would indeed be even much more of a very blue book to
peruse than it now is if all the persons in the employment of the State were
enumerated in its pages, and probably scarcely more than half of our “ Civil
servants ” are known to such fame as is conferred by a record in the “ major’s ”
big roll call, otherwise known as the Blue Book ; that interesting volume which,
by the way, is usually one year and a half old when it is born.*
A comparison of the Blue Book for 1862 with those for the years 1872 and
1881 (the latest yet published) will show that in 1862 there were some 2000 names
therein ; in 1872 about 3000, and in 1881 some 4600. Pretty sturdy growth this.
In using the upas tree as a comparison in this description of our Civil service,
it is but fair to the long misunderstood and much maligned Antiaris toxicaria to
admit at once that it has been proved beyond doubt that its assumed poisonous
shadow was almost purely an imaginary evil. It is sincerely to be regretted that
a similar retraction of evil reputation cannot truthfully be made with respect to
the Civil service.
That this monstrous growth already exercises a very deadly influence indeed
upon our body, political and social, will be the onus proibandi of these papers.
Is there not in the one fact already alluded to, viz.: that scarcely more than a
moiety of the persons actually employed by the State are known to the employer
—the public—as being in its service :is there not in that circumstance alone a
great deal to excite astonishment and justify inquiry and comment?
It might be urged in reply : “ No, there is nothing strange in this ; not more
strange than that a large contracting or other mercantile firm should have in its
employ thousands of labourers whose names are unknown to the heads of the
firm.”
* For instance, the Blue Book for the year 1883 will make its appearance in the usual course
of such events in A.D. 1884 J.


But, let it be remembered that the firm is in the position to ascertain for an
absolute certainty that its thousands of unknown employees are all workers ; the
work is there to prove that so many pairs of hands have been working ; not
merely that so many names are on the weekly paysheet, but that an absolute
result of work is being paid for.
And if the public of the colony could possibly obtain similar surety that the
work for which in most cases it pays liberally is being performed, there would be
at least one very great need the less for pursuing the subject in these papers or
elsewhere.
But that is exactly what the public cannot do ; and until a new order of
things prevails, it is exactly what it will never be able to do. Not only this ;we
shall never be able to withdraw from the Civil Service the stigma implied in our
upas tree comparison until such time as it can be made clear to the public that
its employees are really employed, and not merely being paid for employment
the extent and nature whereof are doubtful. Until in fact the public service is
regulated and controlled in such fashion as would satisfy a commercial firm—no
matter whether a soft goods, an iron master’s, or a newspaper proprietor s—the
fashion which demands that money paid for labour shall be actually earned ; and
that the holiest of all decorative orders, the order of merit, shall be as sure of
recognition and bestowal in the public service as it ordinarily is in the larger and
infinitely more healthful atmosphere breathed by tnose whose labours are
performed outside of and beyond that which surrounds the Civil Service.
It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the largeness and importance of this
Civil Service question.'
Take, for example, its influence upon the morals and character of the
hundreds of young lads and men who enter the service, or who are destined to
enter it. And let us think of what a terribly damning influence it is which is
inflicted by such experiences as must accrue to a very large percentage of those
youths who choose the service as their future career in life.
As that service now exists, a much worse “ start in life ” could not well be
given to a well-trained, honest, and well-intentioned youngster than by placing
him therein.
Say that he has been well looked after and educated ; that he has worked
his way upwards from one form or class to the next, and from school to University,
by dint of fair hard work in shoulder-to-shoulder competition with his fellows ;
and that he has, till now, learned that good marks, approval, and rewards, were
the sure result of diligence, application, and perserverance. The future career
has now to be chosen ; and, smitten by the charms of the “ highly respectable ”
brand, so largely, and so lamentably, believed to be conferred on those who obtain
a “ Government appointment,” he selects the public service for his start in life.
His appointment, as such matters now mostly are, will have to be obtained,
not by competition with his fellows and as the result of his proved superiority to
other applicants, but by the influence of some friendly member of Parliament or
Minister, or may be through the good offices of some Civil servant of position,
and the good offices of even a Government messenger have, by the way, been
more effectual ere now in such matters than a dozen certificates of either
scholarship or ability, if these were unendorsed by “ influence.”
Here is the first demoralising tendency—the newly-fledged “highly-respec-
table” commences with the fact thoroughly well imprinted in his memory that he
has entered upon a career wherein influence, not merit, is the open sesame to at
least the first portals of the service. And as time goes on, if he has not the spirit
and pluck to desire something better, and to quit the service in search of it, he
will most assuredly daily and hourly gather fresh proofs that, so far as promotion
and advancement are concerned, a very little “influence” is infinitely more
potent than hard work, conscientious discharge of duty, or earnest effort.
He will remember that it was influence which put him where he is; he will
know that the same influence can be depended upon to keep him there unless he
is very active-minded indeed in wrongdoing ; and great activity of mind not being
now required of him he will keep straight enough to avoid giving absolute cause
or complaint against him ; and he will equally surely drift into that calmly


philosophical condition of mind, or mindlessness, essential to the career of a
Civil servant whose influence is to be his sheet anchor, and a sheet anchor it is
surely enough, but its anchorage is in a very “Dead Sea itself of hopelessly
wasted and lost, and yet most priceless, youthful spirit and energy.
How can it be otherwise ? What is there in the Civil Service-answer it, ye
gray-haired veterans, if ye will—to call forth in a high-spirited honourable-
minded lad the qualities which shall presently make him recognised as made of
such stuff as the successful mercantile man, the manufacturer, the anti-civil
service professional man, are made of ? Where is the call ini the service for
zeal, emulation, or individual excellence? Will not influence suffice, and serve
him better than any or all of these ? Answer it, ye experienced ones.
Or, as I intend and hope, the answer to that, and to many another and
perhaps more important interrogatory concerning our Civil Service, shall be found
in these papers clearly enough ere the topmost branch of the great upas-tree shall
have been reached in our exploration of it,—an exploration which will reveal
some remarkably curious conditions under which the tree has become what it is,
under the skilful care of its political gardeners.
With so big a fortress to storm, or, to continue the arboraceous comparison
wherewith we started in these papers, with so huge a monster of the forest as our
upas tree to climb, and to thoroughly explore ’ere we take counsel and thought as
to the means to be devised for checking its unhealthful growth, or to reduce its
ungainly bulk to reasonable limits, a very careful reconnaissance s necessary.
Confusion, dissatisfaction, and discordant conditions prevail so largely in the
service itself as to form a sort of official maelstrom or a Civil Service Niagara
whirlpool, in which, if he be not more wary than the bold champion whose We so
recently paid the penalty of his own recklessness in his duel with the veritable
Niagara, the man who seeks to do battle with it may haply find himself in such
rapids of troubled waters as shall make him dangerously near to becoming lost
therein. But comparisons, as the proverbs tell us, being odious, let us be satisfied
to deal with as few as possible, and having adopted the upas tree as our symbolic
equivalent for the service, let us adhere to it. ~ ~ , n
1 And surely the trunk of our giant upas may be fairly considered to be well
and truly represented by our Lands Department. ~
A very huge trunk, and a very ugly giant still, notwithstanding the compara-
tively recent and critical scrutiny to which it was subjected, and which unques-
tionably resulted in a very considerable and wholesome check and restriction being
placed upon some of the giant’s most dangerous and objectionable tendencies.
And vet what was effected as compared with what remains to be done ? Ihe
mere stripping off of a few parasitical climbers upon the mam trunk, so to speak,
rather than the lopping of any of the limbs of the great trunk itself, or of checking
the flow of sap which leaves it still as vigorous, big, black, and ugly as of old ;
and Let u S s°p3 this great solid-looking trunk ; with no gentle touch as of one
who fears to destroy a tree of benignant shade and blessing, but with a big strong
auger, and with a determination to know every inch of its diameter as well as its
girth, and to learn exactly how much of sound timber there may be which may
vet be turned to good honest uses; how much of rottenness at the heart, and how
much of the life-killing, shadow making, wide spreading head and branches may
safely and satisfactorily be cut away, and be never again permitted to stand
between us and the clear sunlight of usefulness and general good.
To say at once and unmistakably that the existence of this huge trunk is due
wholly and solely to the present land laws of the colony, is to say nothing more
absolute fact, and very demonstrable fact too. To say, also, as the auger pene-
trates the trunk in its quest, that it at once encounters unsoundness and rotten-
ness where only soundness should be, is no less true.


If but these papers could be illustrated with maps and diagrams faithfully
compiled from truthful data, what an insight into the correctness and truth of
these assertions would, almost at a glance, be disclosed to even the most casual
observer thereof. Let us, however, picture in our mind’s eye what some of those
illustrations might show to us. Take a sample map, and observe that amongst
the names now published for the first time to the eyes of a credulous and confiding
public, are to be found those of scores of patriots whose voices have been ever
oudest in denouncing the pestilential race of land sharks, and that highest develop-
ment thereof, the political land shark, most especially.
Acres by the thousands and tens of thousands selected, dummyed, sold :
hemmed in, too, by such an elaborate system of skilfully devised “reserves,”
reserves for the public good be it always remembered, but withal such goodly
public reserves, forsooth, that they practically form an impregnable cordon
around tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of acres of land which are
in these faithfully compiled charts of ours, shown to be in the sole and exclusive
possession of .
Well, of some of the many pure patriots whose voices have ever been loudest,
on hustings and off them, in condemnation of jobbery, corruption and plunder;
and especially against all the deadly sins of the land sharks, and of political
land sharks particularly.
That would be a sort of sample map to be found amongst our illustrations ;
and which should surely shed such a startingly clear light upon the upas tree
shade as to rob it for ever of any future chances of further evil-doing.
And supposing, too, that the mysteries now smugly and snugly hidden away
in the archives of the Lands Office were to be equally faithfully overhauled, and
their contents interpreted by experts—or those who have “ been there ” —what a
list of well-known names should we find in association with, oh ! what marvel-
lously queer pieces of business; land shark business ; what a chorus of shocked
denials would rise up —“ ’Tis not I, ’tis not I.”
Why, the reminiscenses of the most illustrious dead, the autobiographies of
the most famous or infamous of men or women, would pale, for a nine days’
wonder at least, before the interest aroused by these documents.
And if it were possible to empanel a grand jury of the country, and to call
before it and place upon oath some of those thousands of Lands Office employees,
and they were to speak the truth and the whole truth, what revelations should
we have ; what tales of the daily and protracted visits of this political sharkist
and that; of the hours spent in this branch and that of the great upas tree ; free
selecting—with a vengeance, believe it, —on this limb; “reserving” (for the
public good, always be it remembered) on that one, and turning over these leaves
and those with the absolute freedom and impunity born of legislative training
and long familiarity with, if not of long experience of, its potential influence.
But surely this is fiction.
Not a bit of it; real solid fact ; and to understand somewhat, and in the
absence of that grand jury panel, how it can happen that a great public depart-
ment, such as is our Crown Lands Department, can possibly be such as it is here
described, viz., something very nearly resembling a close cover for those queer,
but not rare birds of prey—the land sharks (this sounds Irish, but every one
knows that land sharks are very queer birds, and very peccant ones too), it is
necessary to remember the extent to which influence and political patronage and
power have been, and are, exercised in filling the public departments with Civil
servants.
And surely, whatever be their other sins of omission or commission, the
public would not wish, or at any rate under these circumstances it would not
expect, that those patronage nominees should prove ungrateful to their patrons ;
and would it not be the basest of ingratitude to these were the nominees or
appointees to object or to refuse to give them all information and assistance in
their power whensoever it be demanded; and especially when, as is so
thoroughly understood by both the patrons and the patronised, it is all done
strictly and entirely for the public good.


If any one doubts whether it is necessary to have such imformation or
assistance in order to get almost all and every piece of business transacted which
may be desired at the Crown Lands Department, let him try it.
He’ll very rapidly discover that the only satisfactory way of threading that
maze is under the guidance of one of those forest rangers which many of our con-
stituencies so thoughtfully send into Parliament, apparently for the express and
benignant purposes of guarding our upas tree, and to undertake, for various
considerations, mostly substantial ones, the pleasant and useful task of
transacting their own and other people’s land business.
No patriotic citizen or colonist who looks at those lordly nobly proportioned
architectural piles of buildings, our Crown Lands Offices and our Public Works
Offices, but must admit their beauty and feel proud of it; and he will most
naturally hug to himself the complacent thought, that his adopted land, or native
land, whiche’er it be, has made such strides, such substantial progress as to be
warranted in erecting monumental evidences such as these of its prosperity.
And yet to those who have the opportunity of knowing thoroughly, not only
the inner life and secrets of those great human bee hives—wait though, I don’t
want to malign the excellent apis mellijiea, so I will recur to the upas simile—it
is subject for grave thought and for much uneasiness when he compares the vast-
ness of such public offices and departments as these to the smallness of the
population of the colony; and when he bethinks him of how much, how
terribly much of the absolute capital of the colony (its fee simple of lands) has
been dealt with as though it were the mere increment or usufruct of its invest-
ments.
And such an observer will be prone to regard these palatial and noble structures
rather in the character of monster screens or blinds erected to bar the eyes of the
general public from correctly and truly estimating the actual condition of its
affairs, and from discovering all those myriad very busy, very profitable( to them-
selves) visits of those political and other forest rangers to the great upas tree.
This may be considered as digressive from the subject heading of these papers;
but it is far from being so; for it is absolutely certain that this huge upas tree has
been fostered and cultivated mainly as the means to an end; a most fatally
dangerous end, be it also asserted, as regards public interests.
Without its aid, without its vast dark shadow to conceal those who, as
already indicated, have so untiringly and so mischievously devoted their time and
energies, influence and position, to work their objects, those objects could never
have been effected.
Surely the great mass of the public of this colony, notwithstanding its
boasted intelligence, its freedom from old world bonds and chains, is marvellously
supine, or indifferent to some of the evils which beset it, and which are increasing
day by day.
In this fair Australia we have rejoiced ere now at the thought that here, at
least, are no hugely endowed landed aristocrats and hereditary monopolists of
lands once public, but which for centuries have been held as real estate by men,
who, in these days, are regarded as little better than usurpers of public rights.
And yet, day by day, there is growing up a class of land monopolists in our midst
whose grip upon the public estate is already a very formidable public wrong.
That public goes into spasms of almost ludicrous violence now and again over
protection to native industry, or some such matter that might very safely be left
to work its own proper results in due season. But it appears to be blind as a
mole and apathetic as a jellyfish to the actions of many of our patriots and other
members of the body politic ; and yet that apathy means nothing less than pro-
tection to the native industry of landsharks. The public cannot assuredly have
any proper conception of the extent to which it is beguiled, beguiled, and
despoiled through the medium of some of those who it fondly imagines are simply


following the ordinary, if not very noble, methods of serving their constituencies—
the getting this bridge built, that courthouse on to the Estimates, or this little
axe ground.
If nothing worse than these things were chargeable at their door, the country
would get its representatives very cheaply. But very much greater evils than
these are being perpetrated, and all, or mostly so, under cover of that grand tree
of ours.
The signs thereof are plentiful and conspicuous enough if we will but observe
them. Let it be noticed that, w'hereas even ten years ago, there was scarcely a
commercial corporation or firm outside of the banks which made any special claim
to doing business in land speculation only, to-day there are dozens of such insti-
tutions in Sydney, with branches and agencies scattered throughout the country.
And let it be noticed too, that the business of land agencj' is now in so very
many cases conducted by members of Parliament, and that there are scores of
land agents here in Sydney for ever busily engaged in various explorations
amongst the upas tree's many branches. Let it be noted too, that, of the tens of
millions of acres which even ten years since were still public lands, to-day it is
a difficult thing to find, in almost any part of the colony, any compact large
areas of useful unalienated land ; while in the most richly endowed portions of
the colony—the coal country, the timber districts, and the mineral lands—it is
absolutely impossible now to obtain any considerable quantity of unalienated land.
Sold, syndicated, leased, gone ! Absolutely and for ever in most cases.
Millions and millions of acres in all; tens of thousands of rich mineral and coal
lands, gone ; and into the possession of how many thousands of that same'great,
and greatly blind public. How many of the working men of this colony are
landowners ?
Why, the holders of these vast estates, which have been thus almost
imperceptibly permitted to pass away, do not numb er many hundreds;
comparatively a handful of men are to-day great holders of land than were ever
the whole of the landed aristocrats of England combined ; not only greater as
regards the extent of their holdings, that is of course, but as the possessors of
even greater wealth.
And who are these great landed proprietors we have permitted thus to enrich
themselves ? Public benefactors ? Patriots ? Men who have earned such rich
rewards ? If such they be, their good deeds have been done very secretly, and
have even yet to be disclosed to us. And yet the public of this colony permits
itself to be thus despoiled, and blindly returns some of the most active of the
despoilers as representatives of public requirements, and as blindly provides
the ways and means—the ever-and-ever increasing ways and means—for main-
taining in a perfect state of fitness for the work of spoliation that great Civil
Service tree, without the aid of which the despoilers could effect but little
mischief.
There is ample reason for believing that there exists in this city and colony
of ours, land rings and conspiracies, landsharks and conspirators, as strongly
developed and organized as any that have ever existed in that hotbed of the
genus, New York city. Where the carcase is there also are the vultures ; and
no fairer or fatter carcase was ever more completely at the mercy of the vultures,
no richer picking was ever enjoyed by the American ring men, than that afforded
to our local experts by fair New South Wales.
And all done so quietly too.
No loud talk on Change of this great swindle and that splendid haul ; of
that smart piece of finessing, and this brilliant bit of public plundering ; not a
bit of it.
Smug, go-to-meeting-like calmness and outward respectability have prevailed
the while the rifling, the sharp bit of business, the picking of the carcase, has
gone on ; as completely and expertly as it was ever done by the most clamorous
ring ever heard on New York ’Change or in London or Paris Bourse.
True, now and again we have seen greyhaired patriots hold up shocked
hands in indignation, and lift loud voices in detestation of a Milburn Creek pate
de finesse; but what a sham, what a farce, what utter and complete bunkum,


when scarce a week that has passed these many years, but that far greater
wrongs have been inflicted upon that unfortunate public ; and all, or mostly all,
beneath the carefully fostered shade of the great tree !
I will indicate an instance of how it is thus utilized and of how much wrong
and mischief is wrought thereby.
The first knowledge of the state of its exchequer, and of its balance, of its invest-
ments and securities, and possessions surely belongs to the investor or possessor ;
in the present case the public of the colony. And yet it is in an every-day experi-
ence that if one of that body (unaccompanied by a “ forest ranger ” remember)
seeks to obtain either at our Crown Lands Department, or at any one of its infinite
branches throughout the colony, accurate information such as shall enable him to
purchase a portion of land, or to select a homestead, that he shall nine times out
of ten find himself plunged into a very thicket of doubt and confusion. A land
agent at once becomes a necessity.
And if, like a wise man, he recognises that fact and accepts the inevitable,
nines times out of ten he shall find that his non-official land agent is in possession of
accurately charted maps, in which all information is posted up to date as carefully
and completely and as clearly as are the ledgers of a bank or of a counting house.
Now, how is it that an unofficial land agent’s maps are such splendidly com-
plete intelligencer's, whilst those which are accessible to the public in its own
departments are so splendidly incomplete and deficient of information ? It is not
to the pubiic interest that it should be so, assuredly, or that Mr. Sharkist, the
land agent, should be possession of data which one of the public cannot at once
obtain on application at the Government departments. And yet such is, I assert,
very much the case indeed.
How does the land agent manage this ? Whence does he get this first tip—
this proof copy, or print before letter, of the public maps ? True, the agent is in
all probability either an M.L.A. or a “ forestranger he is, very possibly indeed,
also a patron to many an appointee in the upas branches ; he is assuredly a very
constant visitor there, either in person or by deputy, and knows his way about it
even better than most of those who are employed therein; and it may, of course,
happen that as he is very much interested, indeed, in getting the first tidings and
information for himself, his clients, or constituents, that it is thus he succeeds in
obtaining it.
On the other hand, the great trunk itself has no such ardent desire or interest
on behalf of the public ; and, so far as the public appears to be concerned, it also
is quite indifferent to the uses and abuses to which so valuable information may be
turned in the hands of Mr. Sharkist.
So much for at least some of the outward and most visible signs of the evils
being worked in connection with, almost in conjunction within in some instances,
our Civil Service ; and now let me remark to my readers that with respect to the
mere administrative part of the Crown Lands Department’s failings and shortcom-
ings, and those matters more intimately counected with the inner life thereof, I
(jo not at this present time propose to speak or write. That will form the subject
of future comment and description when I am treating with the question of internal
administration as affecting all our public departments in common, and though
these are matters which doubtless by many of the readers of these papers will be
esteemed as of first importance, I am chiefly desirous in the first place to arouse
general public interest and attention by indicating as broadly and strongly as pos-
sible the magnitude, as well as the precise nature of the evils arising from the
present condition of the service to the public itself in the widest sense of the
question.
The misrule, the disorganisation, the dissatisfaction, and the wrongs being
wrought alike to Civil Servants and the public will be fully dealt with hereafter ;
but I purpose in my next paper to take my readers on an exploration of another
great branch of the upas tree, the Public Works Department, and set forth a few
discoveries which, I feel sure, will have very considerable interest for them.
And in acknowledging some communications which have already reached me
in reply to my invitation conveyed in the first of these papers, I beg to inform
certain correspondents that it is quite out of the question that I should either dis-


close my name to them, or hold personal interviews. As I previously stated, all
bona fi.de communications will be regarded as strictly confidential, and it may
satisfy some of my correspondents to know that actual experiences have enabled
me to deal with the subject matter of these papers.
I have not hesitated in the previous papers to assert that from the fatal
facilities which the Crown Lands Department, as it now is and has so long been,
has afforded to parliamentary and other land agents, an immense amount of
almost irremediable wrong has been worked, and continues to be perpetrated
against the public interests of this colony.
My next endeavour shall be to show how another great branch of the service
has been made to participate in and be the means of extending the wrong.
No need to remind my readers that the generic term “ Public Works Depart-
ment ” covers several large branches of the Civil Service—the railways, the
harbours and rivers, the C donial Architect’s, the water and sewage and the roads.
Nor need I remind them that in the same magnificent pile of buildings, which
contains certain portions of the above public departments, the Colonial Secretary’s
Department also finds a place. *
There is something significant though in this latter conjunction of the
Executive Council’s meeting or mustering chamber, with the various administrative
department of works. Convenient enough for the transaction of public business
perhaps; but also a little too convenient as regards the facilities afforded for
those anti-public interests i-epresented by the haunters of our public departments
—land agents, parliamentary and otherwise.
80 far as the larger public abuses are concerned —and it is with these we will
now deal—pre-eminence must be given to the position occupied by our Railway
Department.
As regards their internal economy, unsatisfactory administrative conditions,
and share in contributing to the prevailing state of misrule and mischief, the
other branches of the Works Department are, of course, “ in it,” in common
with, if not to the same extent as, the Lands and the Railways Departments.
But none of those other branches afford the same great opportunities or scope for
the fullest, I might almost say final, development of the tricks and wiles of the
land sharkists, political or private, afforded by the various railway departmental
branches.
At the risk of a little tediousness I may here explain that the Railway
Department consists of the following branches, vizi; —Firstly, the Commissioner
for Railways (£l2OO per annum), who controls the whole clerical and administra-
tive branches of the department, and also the “ existing lines’ ” branch, with an
engineer at its head (£lOOO per annum), the “construction” of tramways, and
the locomotive engineers’ branch (£1000) ; secondly, the Engineer-in-Chief for
Railways (construction branch) £lBOO per annum, under whose direct control is
also the Trial Survey Branch, with an assistant engineer at its head (£700).
Now, the above appointments and branches form a very lively melange. Let
me indicate it.
The highest paid officer is the so-called “Engineer-in-Chief,” who submits
his plans and proposals, whether for new trial surveys or for works of construc-
tion for lines authorised by Parliament, to the Secretary for Public Works only.
The Commissioner, who is thus of course only nominally head of the depart-
ment, has no voice whatever in these matters, unless he can obtain sub rwsa
opportunities of using that voice.
The Engineer-in-Ohiefs position and platform appear to be this : he claims
that as chief professional adviser of the colony, he is not to be required to submit
his professional and skilled work to the criticism of a non-professional and


unskilled officer of a lower actual grade in the service than that occupied by
himself, and one too, who, however admittedly high his talents, has but recently,
comparatively, occupied even that position.
On the other hand, the Commissioner’s standpoint seems to be this : “ Never
mind what my grade in the service is as indicated by my salary, never mind
what I was the other day, or what lam to-day, professionally considered. I am
Commissioner, and I am the real and supreme head, not only of the whole clerical
and administrative portions of the department, but also of a professional depart-
ment—the existing lines—a department of more real importance than that of the
Engineer-in-Chief, for I can spend more money, a great deal more, than he can,
and I do too, upon my own responsibility, and with the consent only of the
Minister ; and I have many hundreds of appointments at my gift or disposal; so
now Mr. Engineer-in-Chief, who is the real head of this department ? ”
Who indeed ? But herein is a pretty kettle of fish, believe me.
This is the sort of fish in that kettle, for instance : the so-called Engiueer-in-
Chiefs department is known also as the Construction Branch; and the other profes-
sional department, that under the Commissioner’s direct control as explained, has
been named to me (during my enquiries on behalf of these papers), as the
“Destruction” Branch, it being thus called by its facetious godfather, from the
manner in which, so it is alleged, it is the practice therein to worry up complaints
and discoveries against the works executed by the other Branch—the Engineer-
in-Chief’s —and pull such works to pieces.
Now, it is not, I need scarcely assure my readers, my intention or desire to
impart to these papers the smallest essence even of partisanship; I shall state
facts only ; but already, surely, in the conflicting situation I have above partly
described, the public cannot fail to see how very seriously undesirable a state of
things is indicated thereby, and that there are some very troubled waters indeed
in the public service.
I shall presently give some very strong, because very costly, instances of the
way in which this Railway Department portion of the maelstrom affects the
public both as regards its exchequer and the morale of the public service.
In using the expression “ so-called ” to the appointment held by the Engineer-
in-Chief for Railways, it is not necessary perhaps that I should say that no dis-
courtesy is intended, but merely to indicate that although that officer is termed
“ chief ” railway engineer, and is paid the highest salary drawn by any of our
profession Civil Servants, it curiously and anomalously appears that he is only
Chief Engineer in name ; and that immensely large sums of public money are
expended in other branches of the Railway Department upon railway works, not
only without any reference to his chieftaincy whatever, but also under professional
officers of much lower grade in the service, and by the direction of, and controlled
only by, the Commissioner for Railways, a non-professional officer.
But before enlarging upon these administrative details let us follow for the
present that fuller development of which I spoke of the land sharkist business
through the medium of this railway branch of the service ; not in imagination, let
it be remembered, but from actual “spoors,” or tracks, which on their previous
excursions the skarkists have left in evidence.
Through such evidence it is made very clear indeed to such as will take the
trouble to heed the signs closely that in very many instances of the railway extern
sions of this colony, the wire-pulling necessary to set the agitators, or agitation,
going has been done by the same men, or by their principals and constituents —by
the same active, alert, and peccant gentry, whose operations have been described
at the Lands Department, the Parliamentary and other land agents.
And that long and long before Messrs. Dick, Tom, and Harry, poor fellows,
and their numerous confreres, the pioneers and settlers upon our lands, had any
conception or thought about the need of a railway in their district, some of the
great body of sharkists had become very kindly and deeply interested indeed,
directly and indirectly, but especially directly, in this and that district ; that
these men have been the main agitators for this and that railway, and the main
gainers by them. Such gainers, Messrs. Honest Selectors, believe it, as ye have
small conception of. Why the gains of a single successful operation of a member


of the sharkist tribe are larger—far and away larger sometimes—.than the gains
realised in a life-time of hard brow-sweating labour and deprivation by even a
fairly successful free selector or settler.
Why should it be so ? Why should a few hundred expert scientific sharkists
be gorged with the fatness of the land ?—for, believe it, it is the real fatness
thereof which is now their portion, and the great bulk of the people of this colony
be used as their stepping-stones or ladders ; —and the colony’s Civil Service be
made mainly the instrument by which so great a distortion of the commonwealth
—extortion is scarcely too strong a term —is perpetrated.
How is it worked ?
Sometimes, oftener than many'people imagine, in such wise as this : when the
first sharkist movement is to be made for a new railway extension, the popular
voice must appear, at any rate, to require it; and what more natural, or even
more proper, than that a few hundred struggling, hardworking settlers and farmers
in the district concerned should “ go for it” to a man ; or that they should hug
Mr. M.L A. Sharkist to their bosoms with wild delight and feed him, drink him,
testimonial him, for his noble conception of a public man’s duties to his con-
stituents in initiating and in using his every effort to get the railway both
successfully into and out of Parliament.
And such conduct would even call forth admiration and praise from the writer
of these papers but for the fact, alas ! but for the fact that the spoors have shown
him that often and often, long before Messrs. Tom, Dick, and Harry were pulled
at by those wires, polled and rolled up as petitioners for the proposed railway ex-
tension, that long before all this the excellent Messrs. M.L. A., Sharkist and Co.
had made very sure of their ample reward for their patriotism by scooping 'up
every acre of land possible to be obtained by these means and those, and by very
mean means indeed, some of them ; and that the first and last to reap the benefit
and the golden harvest produced by railway extension are those expert wirepullers.
But let us follow out the process indicated by the spoors. The agitation
having been thoroughly well started and kept going, the next step is the depu-
tation business. One of those decorously-attired and influential bodies termed
deputationists, which it has been my delight to observe and admire, waits upon the
Minister, and—but there, every reader of the newspapers knows all about that:
how the deputation is courteously received, how deeply impressed the Minister is
with the views put before him as to the desirability of so important, so rich, and
so lovely a district having its railway—(rather! the humorous fellow! why, we
have heard of a Minister, of the Crown colony of Utopia be it carefully noted,
who owned half such a district at the very minute he spoke to such a deputation,
or he and Messrs. Utopia Sharkist’s did between) —that he will consult with his
colleagues, and hopes that, indeed he feels sure nearly, that they will agree with
him that a “trial survey” shall be made.
Now, a “trial survey” in these days is as good as a railway pledged; the
spoors show that the game is practically won. Once the surveyor’s pegs go in for
even a trial line, and it will not be long before the railway extension itself is
under way.
And in one of my next papers I will proceed to show how very useful and im-
portant a part the Railway Branch of the service is made to perform in subserving
and completing the industrious pursuits of the experts who understand how to use
it. And just as there are none like living models for an artist or sculptor to copy
Nature’s works from, and nothing like actual examples to point a moral with or
adorn a tale, I will give some particulars which as spoors will, I am satisfied,
thoroughly bear out what I have asserted. I will give a chapter or two of the his-
tory of the well-known, but not nearly so well-known as it should be, Sydney and
Wollongong anjd Kiama railway extension.
And I will show that even away from Utopia the Civil service is made the
means of very queer pieces of business indeed.


In the last paper I traced a supposititious railway extension agitation from
its inception to the fructifying period when the trial survey becomes a certainty—
the period in fact when the forest rangers and those associated with them have
made a good goal or bull’s-eye.
In order to complete each picture as far as possible before limning a fresh one,
let me here say that even after the trial survey is promised that thereare some golden
opportunities for futher skill and success on the part of some member or another
of the sharkish tribe ; there is the chance afforded, for instance, by the deter-
mining on paper, or the county maps, the route of the proposed trial line, and
the arranging as to which property shall be ruined and sacrificed to the public
good by having the projected railway taken through it.
For it is a strange circumstance but an absolutely true thing, that owners
of lands through which railways are taken invariably declare themselves to be
seriously, sometimes ruinously, injured thereby; and these sufferers, poor fellows,
are also invariably paid large, sums of public moneys in compensation ; and, by
the way, the “land valuation” and “compensation” branch of the Railway
Department will in its turn also afford some features of interest to the reader of
these papers. .
Well, the general direction it is desired that the trial line shall be taken
having been roughly, but with considerable skill despite its roughness, indicated
on the maps, the opportunity occurs for more expertness, and it has happened
before now that land-sharkists have also occupied the position of actual employees
in the public service. Very wrong, is it not? but then who are the exemplars?
Who and what are those in high places who by their own actions show the way
to . „
“ Deeds that are dark and tricks that are vain ”
and who practically both initiate and co-operate with some of our Civil servants
in turning their opportunities for oblique operations against the public interest to
a profitable account ?
It would be easy enough here to name names and cite an abundance of actual
instances in answer to this suggestive question. But prudence, that prudence
which comes of some recent rough teachings—so rough that they jarred against
the opinions of ninety-nine men of a hundred—these have taught that the
columns of a newspaper must not expose in plain straight language public abuses,
saving under such penalties as must at any rate be in the present case avoided.
It may quite possibly happen though that some of these truths which, for
these reasons, may not now be told here in their nakedness, shall yet be uttered
by the writer hereof in that safer place which is adorned by the presence of so
many of our expertest politicians, and where some of them will be afforded the
opportunity which should be so satisfactory to them of disproving their connec-
tion with political land-sharking and with public abuses in conjunction with the
Civil Service. .
Suffice it in general terms, then, to say that the example set by land-sharkists
in high places has proved very contagious, and that some of the public employees
have proved as venal in that respect as their masters.
“ Engineering difficulties,” it is quite certain, frequently play a very useful
part in both determining as to what private properties are to be ruined, as afore-
said, and in enabling those who “ discover ” the difficulties to have a finger in the
pie and the professional finger comes out of that pie a very nice little finger
indeed sometimes ; very much like little Jack Horner s thumb ;in fact,
It pulls out a plum:—
many plums. . „ , .. „
“ And why not,” asks Mr. Professional Finger, “ don t they all do it ? Do
not members of Parliament (Utopia, please) swarm round us from first peg to
last —from first pencil-mark on maps up in that big council-chamber out to the
first camping-ground of the survey party ? Do not many of them, they or their
agents, kindly haunt our camps and point out this route and that by which this
property and that may be avoided, so that it shall not be mined by the tail-


way line ? Ax - e not theirs the keen eyes which often are the first to discover
‘ engineering difficulties,’ such as compel the line to be taken, much against their
wishes, patriotic fellows, through their lands ? ” And surely Mr. Professional is
justified herein ; and just as surely his finger pulls out some of those plums ; and
as for the public, who cares for it; and how much care does the public show for
itself and its affairs in such matters ?
It has been remarked to me, since I commenced these papers, that if I hoped
to arouse any public feeling, or to excite public attention to the extent induc-
ing it to take any action to suppress abuses, either against itself directly or in the
public service, that I should find myself in a far more Quixotic conditiou*[at the
end than was even the excellent Don himself after his famous tilt at the wind-
mills. This may even be so ; but the public shall at least be afforded an
opportunity of reading between the lines such as is not usually available to it;
and I have faith that the public intelligence is not so hopelessly and callously
indifferent to public abuses as is so generally assumed by those who trade most
largely therein and thereon.
It was urged by more than one politician when a debate on this or that rail-
way proposal (especially I recollect, in the case of the Wollongong line, of which
I am presently to write) that if the Government did not support the proposal it
should at least allow a public company to carry out or construct the line ; and it
would have been a marvellously good and profitable thing if some of our railway
extensions had never been sanctioned, excepting as company or private lines ; the
Eublic interests would then have been less like the candle which is rapidly consumed
y being lighted at both ends simultaneously. And several sources of public plunder
which are now wide open to the experts, would not then be at their disposal.
Let me ask what railway company in the world, or company projecting a line
of railway (unless as a political conspiracy it were, in fact, master of the public
purse, as happens we know sometimes in America), what other company would
permit its professional engineering servants to become purchasers of land on the
route of the proposed line ; and what company would hope to get its railway ap-
proved by its directors even, to say nothing of the controlling Parliament, if in
order to run through and benefit its engineers’ and certain of its directors’ landed
interests it permitted those engineers to run the line this way and that, conte qni
eoute , and regardless of the general interests of the whole district to be pre-
sumably benefited by the railway ?
And what public but an American ring-cursed public, or an apathetic
Australian public, would permit a number of its representatives to become the
owners at a pepper-corn value of vast tracts of its richest coal-lands —lands worth
in themselves to any company a hundred times, aye, a thousand times, the price
paid to a supine public for them, and then, forsooth, also allow these men in their
representative capacity to complete their already most excellent bargains by de-
lusory railway projects having for their real aim the development, simply and
mainly, of those very lands and of their owners’ interests.
What public, I ask, save as aforesaid, would also allow its public servants
to be tampered with and made subservient to the evolution of the schemes of
such representative experts, and suffer the public candle to be thus so mercilessly
consumed at both ends.
We have just heard of a certain jubilant political picnic, and it caused me
keenly to desire that a public holiday could be ordained and a great picnic, to
which latter should be invited a few thousands of our apathetic fellow-colonists,
who should be taken over a certain surveyed line of railway, and who should be
shown some very clear and unmistakeable evidences of the manner in which they
suffer themselves to be made the victims of some of their expertest and most
admired representatives.
We will, however, failing the power to convene this social gathering, content
ourselves with an explanation on paper—and over a largely representative instance
of the railway extension business to which I have referred.
The Wollongong line, unless I am much mistaken, is destined to be yet again
the subject of a good deal of Parliamentary and public discussion, even as it has
been already in the past; and assuredly if the public only knew it, there is not


one of our extensions which it is better worth its while knowing all about ; only
on the grounds that such things may not be repeated even if it be too late now
to undo the present mischief; and because, too, it has been through the facilities
which the Civil Service has afforded—or by some of its branches which are
practically under the direct control of interested parliamentary personages, that
very much of the mischief to public interests has been perpetrated.
From its very inception a dozen or so years ago this Wollongong line was,
as described by a Parliamentary debater the subject of “acrimonious debate,”
and until 1881 the line was thrown out each time it was brought forward ; in its
earliests days the line was put down to cost only some £750,000, but the amount
voted for it eventually was £1,020,000.
I must, I fear, little order to put the whole thing clearly before my
readers, and I ask their patient attention on the grounds that, having asserted
that the Civil Service is in a most undesirable condition, it is useless that I should
only show this crack and that flaw in its superstructure ; and that it is necessary
to go to the very foundations themselves for the cause of the failures.
In 1876, during the Robertson-Foster-Stuart-Garrett and Lackey Ministry,
Mr. Lackey quoted a certain telegram which went to prove that in 1872
Mr. Sutherland, then Minister for Works in the Parkes Ministry, had directed
that the sum of £300,000 should be placed on his estimates for this line of
railway, but which was hotly repudiated both by Mr. Sutherland and “ Mr.”
Parkes ; it having also happened that at the same time those two gentlemen had
become largely interested in—buyers in fact of —some four our five thousands of
acres of coal-lands at Jervis Bay, as Mr. Lackey informed the House on that
occasion.
However, for reasons known to’himself (but which were stated in Parliament
to be because Sir Henry Parkes and Mr. Sutherland were then trying to get a
company to construct a line of railway from the coast to their Jervis Bay pro-
perty, and did not then want the Wollongong line constructed), Sir Henry Parkes
(then Mr.) in 1876 moved the omission of the money for this line, and his motion
was carried, Mr. Sutherland, during the same debate, remarking—“ Did he
come to that House to get £7OOO or £BOOO paid in order that every pound’s worth
of that land should be worth £lOOO ? ” And so he, too, voted against the line.
Projects are, it is already known, formulated for some dozens of further
railway extensions to the extent of some 2500 miles; similar tactics are in
operation by the experts ; and already, too, the lands are spotted,” and being
rapidly “scooped” (slang seems wonderfully appropriate to these matters), and
so let these facts be my excuse for recapitulating just a few choice items of the
past history of the Wollongong line before describing its present condition.
During those “acrimonious debates” in 1876 ami 1881 the following
statements were made :
1. Mr. Alexander Stuart assured the House that the “assumption of honorable
gentlemen that it would cost £16,000 a mile was wrong. . . , After crossing
the George’s River the cost would be much less.” Again: “Did honorable
gentlemen know that the part of the country which would be benefitted by
this line milked upwards of 5000 cows daily ? . . Private parties had even
offered to construct this line.”
2. Sir John Robertson said, amongst other things, “ that the district was
rich in agricultural resources, and timber was abundant, and on Government
land.”
3. Mr. T. Garrett defended Sir H. Parkes’change of opinion (i.e., in 1881),
and said also . . “ There were the two large public reserves, tha Loddon
water reserve and the National Park; the water reserve will be for sale soon,
and from the sale thereof a large portion of the expenditure on this line will be
recouped. ”


4. Sir Henry Parkes admitted that he had in 1876 been “ opposed to the line ;
he had now changed his opinions. ... At one time he had been against
bridging the harbour ; now ” .
Well now, as we of course remember, the honorable gentleman was in
favour, very much in favour, of bridging the harbour by a certain Garbett
Bridge ; and it is curious, and not a little suggestive, that his change of opinion
as to the merits of the Illawarra line was of concurrent date.
In traversing and challenging some of the above statements, I will state that
a careful personal examination of every mile of this surveyed line has preceded my
criticism thereof, and I am fully prepared to substantiate my assertions.
Firstly, then, honorable gentlemen were by no means wrong when they
assumed that the line will cost £16,000 a mile ; and in lieu of that portion of it
beyond George’s River costing, as they were assured it would, very much less per
mile than the preceding portion, they may safely now assert, in turn, that the 14
miles or so of the line between, say, Bottle I orest and Coal Cliff will cost from
£20,000 to £24,000 a mile, or about one half more per mile than the Zig-zag ana
heaviest portions of the Great Western Railway. ..
The latter line opened up the immense W estern district; these 14 miles or so
to Coal Cliff will open up well, seeing that this part of the line runs for nearly
all that distance through the coal and timber lands secured by one or two persons,
and that all the other lands around are closely reserved, the term “ opening up
can scarcely be applied to it, so far at least as the public estate is concerned ( vide
Map attached to this pamphlet). . . , .. ,
Unless the country traversedlby this part of the line were inspected, its i ugged,
steep and unstable nature could scarcely be understood ; it has been pronounced
bv an eminent engineering authority as worse than the Blue Mountains for railway
engineering ; a great deal worse too, because these Port Hacking hills and gullies,
w hilst being most precipitous, are of such rotten disturbed formation that they
resemble quicksands almost in places. And yet in order that this line of railway
should tap at certain doors it has been carried thereto in the face nearly of all
obstacles. . . ,
I will give an instance or two in proot ot this.
In June of 1882 tenders were invited for the first section of the line from
Macdonaldtown to Coal Cliff, 32.) miles.' A few days before the tenders were to
come in the discovery was made that some miles of the line between Bottle Forest
and Coal Cliff were impracticable, i.e., that it would be absolutely impossible to
construct a line of railway on some portions of the surveyed route, especially on
about some two miles thereof where the line had been taken along the face of the
Bulffo Cliff, and the result of which discovery was that the first section ot the
line was then re-advertised to terminate at Bottle Forest, the condemned portion
of the line having to be abandoned and a re-survey made, which even at this present
time is far from being satisfactorily completed.
I am strongly tempted to here describe a few very illustrative facts which wull
show what sort of treatment falls to the lot < f Civil servants under some circum-
stances • how “ influence ” shields one, and the want of it places another in a false
and improper position. This very “ discovery ”to which I have alluded has fur-
nished me w'ith certain particulars which, when touching on administrative
matters connected with the service, I shall again refer to. _ _
To return for the moment to the surveyed line. Even as it is now re-surveyed
from Bottle Forest to Coal Cliff, and thence along the very edge almost of the
seaboard to Bulli and Wollongong, it is in reality separated by a natural chain ot
precipitous hills some 700 feet in height from the lest of the district; hills which
practically wall in this costal part of the line for some 30 or 35 miles, and where
it can never be reached by branches from the main district (the Loddon water
reserve country, &c.). This line will, however, certainly serve very materially
the interests of a few successful land monopolists who have secured all the land
on its route. , . . _ . . , ,
But what happened even a few week s since? Instructions were issued for &
new survey of a deviation of another j art of this George’s River to Coal Cliff
portion of the line.


Not a deviation to avoid those condemned miles—nor yet a deviation such as
should bring the line away from and out of those miles of private coal and timber
lands and gullies, and into such a position that it might possibly, some day Gi-
an other, have been of use in opening up that great Woronoa district referred to
by Mr. Garrett.
Not such a deviation at all, but one which would have taken the line still
more completely through these private lands, and still farther away from the
land which, “ when sold, would recoup a large portion of the expenditure on the
line.”
Now this very “ deviation ” by Port Hacking Creek was carefully surveyed
very many years ago, but it was reported as impracticable ; and now that it has
been re-surveyed, its practicability could only be obtained at a further expenditure,
so it is stated to me, not much short of £150,000 over and above the cost of the
original route, or about £9OOO per mile extra ! It is satisfactory, of course, now
to know that this deviation has been precipitately abandoned ; but why should
the expense of this re-survey have been incurred, seeing that it had already been
surveyed and condemned ?
An honorable gentleman told us, we remember, that Illawarra was essentially
a dairy district. “ Hid honorable members know that the part of the country
which would be benefited by this line milked upwards of 5000 cows daily ? ”
How would a paraphrase suit the occasion ? Do the people of the colony
know that the portion of the country which will be benefitted by this line (i.e.,
those miles of private timber and coal lands) will milk the colony to the tune of
about a million of money ? The railway works, &c., on those 14 miles, even by
the original route, will cost about £350,000 ; add to this the value of, say 6000
acres of coal lands, purchased at a nominal price, but worth at even £lOO an acre
(or one-fifth of the value assigned thereto by the expert, Captain Charles), half a
million ; or, say in all, nearly one million sterling.
Do the people of this colony consider that they have received, or ever will
receive, a fair quidpro quo for such a noble endowment as this?
Or do they consider it right that some of our professional Civil servants
should be compelled to receive and execute instructions to the extent even of en-
dangering their own characters for professional ability and probity ? And with the
certain conviction and knowledge in their minds too that the interests of the
colony are being sacrificed.
It happens most fortunately indeed for this colony that some of its most
trusted Civil servants in high position are worthy of their trust; were it otherwise
(and it is almost a wonder that it is not otherwise more frequently, considering
some of the circumstances in which such men find themselves occasionally placed),
the colony’s largest interests, which are often absolutely at the mercy of such
officers, might be very grossly injured indeed.
As I write these words quite a number of instances of this sort of thing occur
to me; and I should like to confide to the public a few cases in point; look, how-
ever, at the one I have but just indicated; given a venal, or a careless, an in-
competent, or a personally interested Civil servant in such a position as that it
should rest upon his sole word and verdict whether such a “deviation” as that
above referred to should be carried out or not; and a sum of £150,000 be trembling
in the balance. It does not need a prophet to tell us w'hat would be the result of
such a position of affairs.
And amongst the conclusions which are to be drawn from such a possibility
as this occurring, I assuredly and clearly assert is the one which tells us that the
time is at hand —has arrived indeed—wdien the interests of the colony demand
that it should be placed beyond the power of Parliamentary personal influences to
put into operation and control in such dangerous fashion any branch of the Civil
Service.
As to some of those other cases in point.
Out of regard to the sensitiveness of some of our laws or of their interpreters,
it will be better perhaps that we content ourselves once more with ascertaining
how such things are managed in that admirable country, Utopia.


In Utopia, then, I find it happened not so very long since that a certain
citizen laid a claim to be paid a very large sum of money out of the public coffers
for sundry and divers odd jobs, which he scheduled out to the tune of some forty
or fifty thousands of pounds ; the claim was at once rejected in toto by the
Utopian public officer, upon whose shoulders rested the responsibility of certify-
ing to this account. Thereupon the citizen enlisted the sympathies of a certain
Utopian Minister of the Crown, who took the case up, and requested a recon-
sideration of it by that officer, but the objection was sturdily maintained ; then
came in a new scheduled claim, reduced to one-half the original amount ; again
that stubborn officer declined to recognise one item of it; another pause, and
then another claim, this time for a paltry ten or twelve “thou.”; stubbornness
still, and thereupon the further consideration of the claim was transferred by the
Utopian Crown Minister to the ‘ ‘ consideration ” and decision of another of the
Utopian Civil servants. . , , . ,
The “ wire ” which connects me with my Utopian correspondent being down
just at this moment I cannot at present tell my readers the final history of this
Utopian Civil service episode. ,
But are we not fortunate that such things occur only in such out of the way
places as Utopia. , , .
In my next paper I will narrate a few more items of somewhat similar
nature, which have at least a reflective and reflected interest for us.
VII.
Here is another little bit of Utopian Civil Service wire-pulling.
A certain line of railway in that country having been surveyed, permanently
laid out, and duly sanctioned by the Utopian Parliament, it occurred to certain
patriotic persons who happened to be possesssed of an old abandoned and worn-
out “coal line” of railway, that it would be a splendid thing for the country
(always pro patria) that a deviation from the surveyed line of railway should be
made so as to follow this old line of theirs, now no longer of any use to them,
and which they would in the most generous fashion turn over to the country for
that purpose. But with this trifling “condition” hanging to the proposal, that
they should receive, in consideration thereof (and as compensation for the taking
over of that which was now useless to the owners) a trifle of some £12,000,
In order to place matters upon a perfectly legitimate footing, so that no bias
should attach to this patriotic proposal, those Utopian partiots enlisted the
services of a remarkably clever and well-known member of the Utopian Parlia-
ment—a man, as they declare in Utopia, even better known than trusted.
With the quiet, stealthy skill which distinguished him as being a past master
in such delicate and patriotic transactions, he accepted this brief for the owners
of this moribund coal-line ; and it only fair to say that he worked las hardest and
cutest to get those £12,000 for his clients. , . . . . ...
It is with a tinge of regret I have to state that so much talent was in this
particular instance exerted to no purpose. An obstinate and unpatriotic Utopian
official reported dead against the taking over of the defunct line, showed
conclusively it would be a particularly good thing for no one but the owners
thereof and in fact sat so heavily upon that proposition and flattened it out so
completely that it is doubtful if even that expert Utopian member of Parliament
can bolster it up into anything like shape any more.
Another item : Cockleshells. ,
This requires explaining. Utopian history always does. Once upon a time
—quite new time, too—certain custodians of Utopian public lands were possessed
of one or two “ cockleshells,” or much used and dilapidated canoes. Some of
Utopia’s surveyors engaged on explorations used these cockleshells ; and, lo ! a
bill was sent in to a Utopian public department “for use, wear and tear, and
damage done to cockleshells, say £2OO.


Claim indignantly scouted by Utopian official. “But, my dear boy, it’s all
right.” quoth the cockleshell proprietor; the Minister (of Utopia) knows all
about it. You’ve only to pass the account. Fact is, we want to buy a new
cockleshell with a smoke-jack in it. (A small steamer, I expect, was meant from
what I know of Utopian language.)
That little bubble was pricked, too.
I could trot out quite a budget of instances where, in Utopia, similar Parlia-
mentary influences have been exerted in the public interests ; but repetition is
always tedious. Let us try a change of subject.
And whilst quitting the piquant pickings afforded by an insight into some of
the larger influences at work in the railway and other branches of the Civil
Service of our own colony as well as of Utopia, let me add just a few words of
comment upon the effects of political engineering as applied (and described) to
the Wollongong line.
That line presents unquestionably the worst case of the kind, because the
costliest; but it has congeners in others of our lines ; in the Mudgee line largely ;
in the Homebush to Waratah line also largely ; and also in the case of the Iron-
barks and Orange line ; and I warn the public that the. evil is full of vitality, and
is well started on other railway schemes not yet stamped with Parliamentary
authority.
I am aware there are those who hold it as an axiom that Civil Service engineers
should give no opinions as to the routes which railways should follow; that such
important matters as these are essentially of a political nature, and are for the
body politic to determine.
The Wollongong line is essentially a sample of the nature and costliness of
political railway engineering ; the other two lines named by me are also largely
representiye political engineering lines ; and I venture to assert that the colony,
rich as are its resources, cannot afford (however delightful and profitable the occupa-
tion of political engineering is to its representative men) to construct any more
Wollongong lines of railway ; and that such political engineering means much to
the public exchequer.
And now as to some of the administrative matters which are disclosed by a
careful enquiry into the subject as obtaining in this railway department of ours.
Before starting afresh on this quest I will remark that by a series of curious
coincidences it has happened since these papers were commenced, some seven
weeks ago, that quite a different phase is observable in connection with sundry
matters touched on therein. Attention was drawn in one paper, for instance, to
the fact that enormous powers were being exercised (almost uncontrolled) by one
particular officer of the service. Now an edict has gone forth which has largely
limited that state of things.
In another paper was allusion to coming trouble anent a certain line of railway
deviation. Pop ! bang ! that is declared to be over.
The wholesale alienation of our coal and mineral lands and their falling into
the hands of a few persons was perhaps rather strongly deprecated in an earlier
paper, and lo ! it is proposed now to stop all such alienations ; a remedy just a
trifle too strong for the disease, and a remedy likely to be joyfully hailed by those
lucky fellows who are already possessed of such lands, for does it not mean pro-
tection to vested interests ?
The country needs only to see that it gets fair value for its coal and mineral
lands and that they are not permitted to fall, in huge estates, into a few privileged
hands and at a thousandth part of their value.
Now, then, for some of those administrative affairs.
It will be recollected that I used the phrase, the homely but still significant
one, in a previous paper, that in the discord discoverable in the railway branch of
the Civil Service, that there was a “pretty kettle of fish.” I displayed a fish or
two, and I undertook to give some striking and costly examples of the mischief
resulting alike to public interests and to the Civil Service therefrom.
This particular department has for a very long time past being playing a sort
of expansive, and expensive, game of battledore and shuttlecock; needless to say
that the public interests are represented by the latter.


On the one hand, we have seen that there is a nominal Engineer-in-Chief for
Railways, who has charge of trial surveys, and who carries out all the works of
construction upon authorised extensions. Works, including of course all neces-
sary station buildings, &c., for opening and working the line; and that then this
» chief” engineer ceases suddenly to be further identified with these works, and they
are transferred to and thenceforward are under the supreme control and direction
of the Commissioner for Railways, and of his officers the Engineer for Existing
Lines and his assistants. , . , ,
Careful enquiry undoubtedly establishes the fact that from that moment,
under the conditions which as I have said have long unfortunately prevailed in
the department, the game of shuttlecock commences. .
The Commissioner, perhaps, makes some genuine discoveries that the works
so transferred to him are not in accordance with his views of the requirements
for working the lines. At any rate, history shews clearly that large numbers of
station-yards, station buildings, and other engineering works thus transferred by
the Engineer-in-Chief’s “Construction” branch, are speedily discovered in the
other branch to require either extensive modifications or additions, and money
begins to be spent thereon freely ; and without, of course, any reference to that
nominal “chief” from whose charge these works have passed.
One of these two, either “Montagu” chief or “Capulet” commissioner, must
evidently be at fault herein, and it cannot possibly be a good sort of game at all,
this shuttlecock ; so far, I mean, as the public interests are concerned.
Look at it in another way. Enquiry has also enabled me to ascertain that
one of the parties to this game holds it as a complaint and impropriety that
certain erstwhile subordinate officers of his who have left his department for
various reasons, should not only be welcomed and appointed to that other battle-
dore branch, but that they should also be permitted, if not even directed, to
constitute themselves inquisitioners upon the works executed by and transferred
to their charge by the other branch. ~ , u .
The shuttlecock, as the result of this, looks considerably battered after the
game has been played a bit. . ... , ~ ~ , ,
The Montagus hand over, as aforesaid, their constructions to the Capulets.
Amongst other items, say perhaps a dozen or two large structures which have cost
a couple of millions or so of money—structures bearing the respectable and reputable
endorsement of names of world-wide fame and associated intimately with the repu-
tations of men of high position. . , ,
Some of the Capulets (the Sampsons and Gregorys of this adaptation) forth-
with bite their thumbs at the Montagus, and then the fun begins ; such fun for
the public interests as the frogs enjoyed so much !
This sort of fun, and without even inviting an umpire to be present at the
game to beplayed ! , ,
“ Says a Capulet to a sturdy henchman : ‘ Get thee to those millions worth
of Montagu structures ; arm thee with good trusty hammer, and see if there be
flaws to be found such as may avail a Capulet against a Montagu.
Now, a big man with a big hammer can make a big impression on lots of
things ; and even strong structures, such as railway bridges, &c., are not insensible
to such Capulet attentions as these. To put the matter into still plainer
words, I will state at once that amongst the discordant conditions ascer-
tained in my enquiries are such items as these. That highly costly
engineering structures which have been constructed under one branch of our
Railway Department, have been pronounced by another branch thereof to be
defective in design, of faulty construction, and requiring huge “ repairing.”
That (whether justified or not in doing sol do not presume to say), on such
decision being arrived at, such structures have forthwith been taken in hand and
dealt with by the Capulets without any reference to, or consultation with, the
Montagus. Whereat and wherefrom,much wrath amongst the battledores; and a
very rough time, indeed, for that poor shuttlecock, public interests,
Such a condition of “ official hammer and tongs ” as is disclosed by the above
description is not, unfortunately, merely one of those family jars which occur in
all large business concerns, and which may be satisfactorily settled by a little


vigorous inquiry and swift judgment. When our departmental quarrels assume
such a phase that they also involve reflections upon men of high character and
repute in England (the fountain head of our own reputation and commercial
position, and the source upon which we rely for our loans for public works), it
becomes a very serious matter indeed, and one quite beyond the power of any
local board of inquiry here in Sydney to satisfactorily deal with.
Reputations, commercial and professional, are yet held of too much value
in England to admit of their owners allowing them to be impeached with
impunity ; and, unless the impeachments are justified, those who make them will
assuredly not only bring injury upon themselves, but indirectly also upon the
credit of the colony in whose employment they may be.
There are many other and somewhat similar items to my hand to those
described, if space could be afforded in these papers to record them. But, failing
this, let us look at another source of trouble —another bit of broken water.
Any one who has ever watched an expert, skilful tradesman or handicrafts-
man at his work, no matter what his trade or occupation, must have noticed
what a lot of material he will quietly work up, or what a splendid bit of work-
manship he will turn out from a mere hole and corner of a shop, or from a nook
on some rough bench ; and any one who has also seen a novice at his trade
labouring away will also have observed what an awful lot of space that young
man wants for his tools and materials, how he spreads himself out, what a litter
and a dust he’ll make, and what a terrible lot of chips he’ll scatter round
Close observation of facts as they have presented themselves to me warrant my
saying that there appear to be a good many such young men about in some
branches of the great public works department —a great deal of Waste of one sort
or another, a deal more spreading out than is necessary, and lots of quite
unnecessary chips. Chips, too, from that old block, public interests. *
