FOREWORD.
NEARLY one-half of the world’s raw wool, and over two-thirds
of the volume entering world trade, is produced within the
British Empire, and the importance of this commodity to Empire
producers is therefore manifest. The Board’s Agricultural Economics
Committee accordingly suggested that the Statistics and Intelligence
Branch of the Board should undertake a statistical survey of the
world production of, and trade in, wool for the information of pro-
ducers, and others interested in the commodity.
The memorandum here presented is confined to the production of,
and the export trade in, raw wool. A second memorandum will be
published later bringing up-to-date the figures now presented and
covering, in addition, the import trade in raw wool, the conversion
of raw wool into products and the trade in wool textile manufactures.
The method followed in the present volume differs somewhat from
that adopted in the earlier surveys of this nature issued by the
Board dealing with Oranges and Cocoa (*); wool being an animal
product is obviously subject to materially different factors from
those affecting vegetable products and the treatment of the subject
thus calls for differentiation.
In the compilation of this survey, the Board has had the assistance
of an Advisory Committeef which includes acknowledged experts in the
trade and the Board desires to take this opportunity of expressing its
thanks for the invaluable assistance ungrudgingly given by the
members of the Committee, as well as by many official, statistical and
trade bodies in all the important wool-producing countries of the world.

WOOL SURVEY.
A SUMMARY OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE IN THE
EMPIRE AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
INTRODUCTION.
Wool is, next to cotton, the most important raw material of the
textile industry. It has been used for clothing since the earliest times,
and in the Middle Ages woollen cloth was one of the most important
commodities entering world trade and constituted the basis of
England’s commercial prosperity.
The development of raw wool production during the past 200 years
has been marked by two outstanding facts ; firstly by the shifting
of the principal areas of production from the northern to the southern
hemisphere, and secondly by the large increase in production. There
can be little doubt that the second fact is directly attributable to the
first or, in other words, that the increased production would not have
materialised but for the opening up to sheep of vast areas in Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa and South America which now produce
about three-quarters of the world’s supplies of wool for clothing
purposes. During the past quarter of a century this development
has continued and the net increase in the sheep population of the
world during that period has largely occurred in Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa. This shifting of the world’s centre of
gravity of wool production is bound up with the fact that the sheep
is often a pioneer of civilisation and has usually to recede before the
pressure of developing populations.
Although the chief producing areas are now to be found in the
Southern Hemisphere, wool is produced in almost every country in
the world, differing in this respect from other raw materials of the
textile industry, such as cotton, silk, hemp and jute, which are
produced within comparatively restricted areas. Nevertheless, this
wider area of production has not in the past always ensured an


avoidance of periods of shortage of supply ; wool production, par-
ticularly in the important area of the Commonwealth of Australia,
has from time to time suffered appreciably from droughts and from
animal and vegetable pests, and these have periodically resulted in
heavy mortality of the flocks and a serious diminution in wool
production. But in recent years close attention has been paid to
these adverse factors and much progress has been made by water
conservation and other preventive measures to diminish their
potentialities.
Wool is peculiarly sensitive to price fluctuations, owing mainly to
its relative inelasticity of supply and its marked elasticity of demand,
and particularly during recent years the market has experienced wide
variations in price, which to an important extent were independent
of changes in the value of money. Certain cyclical theories have
from time to time been advanced with the object of explaining the
observed price-movements of raw wool but, whether there exists any
regular cycle or not, it is clear that the recent fall in raw wool prices
is by no means an isolated occurrence and will, on the basis of past
experience, be followed in due course by an upward movement. The
recent fall, nevertheless, does differ in degree from previous move-
ments both in extent and duration. But it should be borne in mind
that the period in question has been marked by a general world-wide
depression of an unprecedented magnitude.
Despite the existing depressed state of the industry there are
indications that wool will quickly respond to any improvement in the
general economic situation. From the available statistical evidence
it appears that excessive stocks of raw wool have not accumulated
in the principal exporting countries taken as a whole, and more
settled conditions in Europe and the Far East should result in a
substantial development in the demand for the commodity. Moreover,
no adequate substitute for wool has yet been invented, the competi-
tion that it suffers in the hosiery and other trades from artificial
silk probably being counterbalanced in some measure by the greater
utilisation of the finer wools in conjunction with that commodity.
Indeed, new fields of utilisation of wool are being actively explored
and additional uses to which wool can be advantageously put have
already been discovered in the electrical and other industries.
Continued research along these lines, as well as a greater appreciation
of the outstanding qualities of wool as a clothing material, will
undoubtedly hasten the return to brighter conditions in the industry.


Wool is essentially an Empire commodity and the prosperity of
the pastoral interests, particularly in Australia, New Zealand and
the Union of South Africa, as well as of important industrial and
commercial interests in the United Kingdom, are intimately bound
up with the condition of the wool-growing industry, and it is hoped
that this compilation of the available statistics of production and
exports of raw wool will prove of value to those interests.
This survey will also serve a useful purpose if it encourages the
publication of more regular and comprehensive sheep and wool-
production statistics by the competent authorities in those producing
areas which in the past have fallen short in this respect. The sheep
and wool statistics of many countries could be materially improved
and such improvement is' indeed essential for a more adequate
knowledge of the past development and future prospects of the
industry.




PART I.
THE SHEEP POPULATION OF THE WORLD.




CHAPTER I.—DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORLD’S SHEEP.
Introduction.
The volume of the world’s wool production from year to year
depends upon two factors —the size of the world’s sheep population
and the average production per sheep—and a consideration of
sheep numbers is therefore of prime importance when examining the
trend of wool production. No very close accuracy can be looked for
in estimating the sheep population of the world since an official
census, or even an official estimate of sheep, is not taken annually
in many countries, and in some very infrequently or not at all.
Moreover, census years do not in every case coincide nor do the
statistics always relate to the same season of the year—a vital factor
in live-stock enumerations.
An estimate* has nevertheless been attempted in this survey for
three pre-war years —1905, 1909 and 1913 —and three post-war
years —1921, 1925 and 1929. In the case of the more important
sheep-raising countries the figures are continued to 1931 and
will be found in Table 110. For the most part the statistics are
census results or official estimates for the years in question. Where
these are not available, the official figure for the year nearest to that
under consideration has been adopted, except in a few cases where
an estimate has been made on the basis of the available informa-
tion. In some instances the figures relate to the number of sheep
registered for fiscal purposes, which does not necessarily correspond
with the total sheep population. In addition to this world estimate
for the particular years indicated, annual figures are given in the
following paragraphs relating to the individual countries in every
case where they have been traced.
The official figures of sheep population used in this survey have
been taken from statistical reports of the respective countries, from
the year books of the International Institute of Agriculture and the
United States Department of Agriculture and from other authoritative
publications dealing with the subject. In all cases where sources other
* See Appendix I.


than official have been utilised, full details have been indicated in
footnotes to the relevant tables. The figures for certain areas —
notably parts of Asia and South America —are less reliable than
others, and mention is made in the following paragraphs where
special reserve should be exercised in the consideration of particular
figures.
BRITISH EMPIRE COUNTRIES.
Commonwealth of Australia.
Sheep are the principal live-stock raised in Australia, and sheep
products constitute the most important part of the Australian
economy. During the three years ended 30th June, 1930, sheep
products accounted for 78 per cent, of the value of all home-produced
pastoral products exported and 45 per cent, of the total value of
domestic exports from the Commonwealth. The value of the wool
exported during this period constituted 41 per cent, of the total
domestic exports.* In 1929 there were 105 million sheep as against
IT million head of cattle, 2 million horses and 1 million pigs.
In 1929 the number of sheep per square mile was about 35, Victoria
having the densest sheep population with 198 per square mile, followed
by New South Wales with 162 per square mile. Western Australia
had the scantiest sheep population with less than 10 per square mile.
The sheep population of Australia in the past has been much
affected by droughts, and appreciable fluctuations in numbers have
thereby been produced. Thus the droughts of 1892-1902 must be
held largely responsible for the reduction in the flocks from the peak
of 106-4 millions in 1891 to 53-7 millions in 1902. Other partial
droughts of varying severity occurred in 1912, 1914-15, 1918, 1919,
1922-23, 1925-26 and 1927-28, with resultant mortality in the flocks
and a check to their development. Fairly consistent progress has
been registered since the end of the war, and the estimates for 1930
indicate that the record figure reached in 1891 has been attained once
again. The following table shows the development of the sheep
population of the Commonwealth since 1890.
According to the census returns of 1928, the sheep of the Common-
wealth were grouped into about 89,000 flocks. Slightly over one-half
of the sheep were contained in flocks of less than 5,000 head. The

average size of the flocks was about 1,150. Tasmania had the smallest
average flock and Queensland the largest, the respective figures being
under 500 and about 3,500. The following table shows the sheep
population of the Commonwealth in 1928 classified according to the
size of the flocks.
About one-half of the Australian sheep are raised in New South
Wales, which was the first part of the Commonwealth in which sheep
were introduced. Queensland comes next with about one-fifth of the
Australian sheep, but although Queensland holds second place, the
number of sheep in that State in relation to its area is relatively
small. At the end of 1930 the Queensland flocks were somewhat
below the peak of 23,100,000 recorded in 1914. The flocks are
relatively large. Queensland is closely followed by Victoria, where
the sheep are bred for their meat to a greater extent than is the
general practice in the Commonwealth. Of the remaining States,
Western Australia is most conspicuous on account of the rapid
development in its sheep population which almost quadrupled between
1890 and 1930. Yet Western Australia has the scantiest sheep
population of all the States, there being less than 10 per square mile
in 1930, and it is probable that here may be found the best prospects
for continued expansion of the Australian flocks. The South
Australian flocks fluctuated between 6 and 7 millions for many years ;


in 1930 they numbered 6-0 millions as against 7*o millions in 1890.
There are only about 16 sheep per square mile as compared with
162 in New South Wales and 198 in Victoria : most of them are
in relatively small flocks. In Tasmania there has been a slow but
marked upward movement and the 2 million mark has now been
attained.
The Union of South Africa.
No other country in the world within the last 25 years has increased
its sheep population as fast as the Union of South Africa. At the
beginning of the century it was among the lesser sheep-raising
countries; to-day it holds fourth place and is confident of making
further substantial advance in the future. Sheep-raising is quite
the most important of the pastoral pursuits in the Union, which
owns one-half of the sheep population of the African continent
and holds second place in the British Empire.
Sheep are by far the most numerous livestock in the Union ; in
1930 there were 48,358,000 sheep, 10,574,000 cattle, 941,000 pigs and
7,955,000 goats, including 1,801,000 angoras. Calculated per head
of the population the figures were as follows : sheep 6’ 1, cattle 1 -3,
pigs 0* 1 and goats 1-0.
Including non-woolled sheep, the sheep population of the Union
in June, 1931, was officially estimated at nearly 50 million head, or
approximately three times the number at the beginning of the century.
Moreover, at present about 90 per cent, of the sheep are woolled,
whereas at the beginning of the century only about 70 per cent, were
woolled. Since 1919 there has been little or no development in the
number of non-woolled sheep and almost the whole of the increase
has occurred in the woolled sheep.
Table 3 shows the growth of the sheep population in the
Union since 1904, the first year for which official figures have been
traced. The figures included in the table represent either official
estimates or the results of censuses for the years given, which are the
only ones for which such figures have been traced.
There are about 105 sheep per square mile in the Union as compared
with 35 in the Commonwealth of Australia and 280 in New Zealand.
The size of the flocks varies considerably but, generally speaking,
medium-sized flocks are the rule.

About one-half of the Union’s sheep are taised in Cape Province
and it is here that the largest absolute advance has been made since
1911, although the Transvaal and Natal are responsible for larger
relative advances.

The following table shows the number of woolled sheep in each
province in certain years, but the figures should be accepted with
some reserve, owing to errors in classification due to farmers
confusing woolled with non-woolled sheep.

(a) From population census. The 1904 figure is exclusive of woolled sheep in
native areas.
The development of the woolled-sheep industry has been partly
effected at the expense of the other sheep, but more particularly at
the expense of the Angora goats. The number of cattle has steadily
increased, while the number of common goats has remained fairly
constant. The displacement of the non-woolled sheep and the
common goat might have been greater were it not that, being hardier
than the woolled sheep, they are the only types of live-stock that will
thrive in certain areas.* The numbers of each of the principal types
of live-stock in 1911 and 1930 were as follows :—

McLoughlin, M.Sc. (published by Union Department of Agriculture, 1929).


New Zealand.
New Zealand’s pastoral industry and national wealth are largely
bound up with her sheep. She has over 280 sheep per square mile
and over 20 sheep per head of population, both figures constituting
levels reached by few other countries. Her sheep in 1931 aggregated
29,793,000, as compared with 4,081,000 head of cattle, 296,000 horses
and 476,000 pigs. Sheep products normally account for about one-
half of the total value of domestic exports from the Dominion.
The sheep industry of New Zealand is interested in the production
of mutton and lamb to a greater extent than that of Australia or the
Union of South Africa.
The climatic conditions of New Zealand, being equable, mild and
free from extremes of temperature, are very favourable for sheep-
farming and the fertility of the soil provides rich pasturage for the
flocks. Owing to the absence of the droughts which have character-
ised Australian pastoral history. New Zealand’s sheep population,
unlike that of Australia, has shown a fairly consistent development.
During the last forty years New Zealand’s flocks have increased by
66 per cent.
North Island has contributed in a far greater degree to this growth
than South Island. In 1890 North Island had 6,600,000 sheep and
South Island 9,500,000. By 1931 the flocks in North Island had
reached 16,000,000, while those in South Island had only increased
by about one-half to 14,000,000. The detailed figures, which are
shown in Table 6, indicate that New Zealand more than
maintained its flocks during the war and, notwithstanding a decrease
of over 4 millions in the period from 1918 to 1922, has since increased
them by about 8 millions to a record level, which is largely attribut-
able to top-dressing of pastures.
The returns for 1931 show a drop in the sheep population of about
1 million on the year. This temporary check in the development
may be attributed to the abnormally low wool prices which have
been ruling for two or three years.
Statistics of the sizes of the flocks in the Dominion are published
annually; Table 7 summarises these particulars since 1924, and
gives the number of sheep in each flock-group on 30th April, 1930.
It will be seen that nearly 80 per cent, of the sheep are in flocks of
5,000 or less. During the period from 1924 to 1930, when the sheep
population was steadily increasing, there was an increase in the

It is not, of course, possible to say whether the limits of the sheep-
carrying capacity of New Zealand have been reached. It remains
to be seen whether dairying will continue to develop as rapidly in
the future as it has done in the past twenty years, during which
period the value of its annual produce has increased over four-fold,
and whether it will do so at the expense of sheep-raising. But the
extension of the practice of top-dressing pastures as a means of

increasing their sheep-carrying capacity suggests that, apart from any
other possible developments, a further expansion of the sheep flocks
of the Dominion is far from improbable.
The United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom comes fourth in order of importance among
the sheep-raising countries of the Empire. The sheep population of
the United Kingdom has not yet attained the level of the beginning
of the century, as is indicated in the following table, which shows
the distribution and movement of the sheep population since 1890.
The sheep in the area now forming the Irish Free State have been
excluded in order to permit of a better comparison of the develop-
ment over the whole period. There are at present nearly 280 sheep
per square mile in the United Kingdom, which has, therefore, one of
the densest sheep populations in the world. Such a density is
unusual in an industrial country. In the United States of America,
for instance, there are about 14 sheep per square mile, in Germany
about 19 and in France about 48.
In 1931, the United Kingdom had over 26 million sheep or only
4 million less than New Zealand. But the difference is really greater

than the figures indicate because the United Kingdom returns,
taken in June, include a considerable proportion of lambs, whereas
the New Zealand figures relate to April 30, which is at the end of
the season for the slaughtering of lambs for the frozen-meat trade.

The sheep population of England and Wales in 1931 was 13 per
cent, smaller than in 1890. The reduction was fairly consistent during
the pre-war quinquennium, and had, in fact, been going on inter-
mittently since about 1874 as cattle increased and pasture replaced
arable land. In 1913 the sheep numbered 17-2 million as against
20*4 million in 1909, and 23 million in 1874. During the war a
further reduction of nearly 4 million occured and in 1920 a low
point of 13-4 million was reached. Some recovery has since been
made and the estimate for 1931 shows a net increase of over 4 million
on the 1920 figure. The Eastern and Southern Counties, where
the practice of running sheep on arable land has considerably
diminished, show the heaviest reduction, and in several of them
the sheep population is less than half its size at the beginning of
the century. On the other hand, most of the Northern, North
Western and Welsh Counties have slightly increased their flocks
since 1900. This has resulted from the conversion of lowland
arable land to grass, rather than from an increase in the sheep
on the hill and mountain pastures.
The sheep population of Scotland has fully held its own, and
fluctuations have been relatively insignificant. Between 1890 and
the outbreak of the war there had been a slight decrease of about
half a million sheep, or 8 per cent., and a further half a million were
lost during the war, but the losses endured have been more than
made good and the figure for 1931 shows a sheep population nearly
half a million in excess of that in 1890. The sheep in Northern
Ireland aggregated about 800,000 in 1931 as against 368,000 in the
same area in 1890; the bulk of this increase has occurred since the
war.
The Indian Empire.
India is the most important sheep-raising country in Asia, although
the sheep population is small in relation both to the number of
inhabitants and to the area of the country. Fairly complete informa-
tion is available for the British Provinces since 1914, but for earlier
years the statistics are incomplete, several provinces being omitted.
In the following table the census figures for the British Provinces in
1914, 1920, 1925 and 1930 are set out, these being the only recent
years for which such figures are available. About one-half of the
sheep population of the British Provinces is raised in Madras, where
a slight increase has occurred. Elsewhere numbers have remained
fairly steady.

(b) Excluding Baluchistan (not available).
For the Indian States the annual estimates published in the
“ Agricultural Statistics of India ” do not serve as an indication
of the movement of the sheep population owing to variations in the
number of States included.
The live-stock census taken in January, 1930, covered 83 States
comprising one-half of the total area of all the Indian States, and
the number of sheep enumerated was 16,259,000. By including the
latest available statistics for certain States which were not covered
by the census, this figure is raised to about 18 millions. There still
remain a number of States for which no statistics have been published.
These States are widely scattered, but lie for the most part in the
sheep areas of India. On the basis of the average density of the sheep
population in those States covered by the census, the aggregate sheep
population of all the Indian States may be computed at about 25
millions, but any such estimate is obviously liable to a substantial
margin of error. The results of the censuses of 1919-20, 1924-25
and 1930 are shown in Table 10. The figures for the first two censuses
suggest a decrease in sheep population, but the results may possibly
have been affected by inter-State movements of sheep, as the
enumerations were spread over a period of five months.

Canada.
The sheep-raising industry of Canada is of minor importance and,
although a relatively large increase in the flocks has been registered
in recent years, they still aggregate less than 4 millions. The climatic
conditions, which necessitate the provision of indoor shelter for the
flocks during several months of the year, and the necessity for pro-
viding winter feed, may be expected to continue to limit the expansion
of sheep-raising over large parts of Canada. Nevertheless, the
present efforts promoted by the Government to divert agricultural
activity away from purely grain farming to mixed farming may
result in some further increase in sheep numbers.
The development of the sheep population in Canada is shown in
the following table.

The largest relative increase between 1911 and 1931 has occurred
in the Western Provinces, where the numbers have risen from 324,000
to 1,427,000, whereas in the Eastern Provinces the net increase in
the same period has been from 1,850,000 to 2,181,000 ; there was a
decrease of 350,000 sheep in the Eastern Provinces in 1931. The bulk
of the Canadian sheep are still in the Eastern Provinces, where Quebec
and Ontario together raise about 50 per cent, of the sheep in the
Dominion. The following table shows the number of sheep in each
Province in 1911 and in certain post-war years.

State showed a marked downward tendency between 1909 and 1925,
a decrease from 3*7 millions to 2*B millions, or about 25 per cent.,
having occurred during that period. But in recent years an appreci-
able recovery has been made and the sheep in 1931 aggregated

Other Empire Countries.
The remaining Empire countries have in the aggregate about
16 million sheep. Only about one-half of these are of importance in
the wool trade and they are found mainly in Africa. Kenya has about
3.200.000 sheep, largely of the native non-woolled type, Basutoland
2.400.000, South-West Africa Territory 1,600,000, Falkland Islands
600.000, Southern Rhodesia 400,000, Cyprus 300,000, Palestine
300.000, and Newfoundland 100,000. Particulars of the sheep
population of these areas for 1913, 1921 and annually since 1925 are
given in Table 14.
Between 1921 and 1930 the aggregate sheep population of these
countries increased by over 20 per cent., mainly in Kenya and
South-West Africa Territory. According to the census taken in
Kenya on 31st July, 1930, there were 2,997,000 native-owned and
231.000 European-owned sheep, making a total of 3,228,000, including
207.000 woolled sheep, mainly of the merino type. Since 1921 the
number of woolled sheep has more than doubled. The Kenya
woolled-sheep industry dates from about 1905. Its history has

consisted in the up-grading of the Masai and other native (non-woolled)
types of sheep by crossing them with imported stock, especially
merinos. There are large areas suitable for sheep farming, and there
are possibilities of wool-production on a considerable scale in the
Highlands, though the prevalence of disease and losses from
depredations of wild animals are at present limiting factors.

The sheep in South-West Africa Territory in 1930 aggregated
1,601,000, of which 90 per cent, were in European ownership. There
has been a rapid development during the last few years, the number
of sheep in 1930 being 50 per cent, higher than in 1925, and nearly
three times as great as in German South-West Africa before the war.
At the 1921 census there were 1,859,700 sheep in Basutoland, as
compared with 1,369,000 at the previous census taken in 1911.
Nearly all the sheep are native-owned. Later estimates indicate
a gradual increase in the number of sheep to 2,400,000 in 1930.
Sheep-raising is the basic industry of the territory, which is the
largest wool-producing area in South Africa outside the Union and
supplies most of the native wool exported through Union ports.
The Falkland Islands are devoted almost entirely to sheep-raising,
and there are nearly 290 sheep per inhabitant, which is probably a
record. Following the initial importation of sheep in 1867, the
industry developed rapidly and by 1896 there were about 800,000
sheep in the Islands. Since then there has been no expansion and
numbers have remained fairly uniform during recent years at between
600,000 and 700,000 head. As the sheep ranges are probably stocked
to capacity, there is no great likelihood of a considerable increase
in the sheep of the Colony which numbered 607,000 in 1930.*
The other British countries included in Table 14 (namely, Southern
Rhodesia, Cyprus, Palestine and Newfoundland) have only about
1 million sheep between them. In Southern Rhodesia the total
number of sheep, which are raised primarily for mutton, does not
exceed 350,000. Except for a limited expansion in the north-east,
the sheep industry of the Colony has shown very little growth during
the past decade. The sheep do fairly well in small flocks but any
attempt to increase their size usually results in heavy losses. Attempts
to introduce merinos have met with varying success (f). The figures
for Palestine and Cyprus are taken from the animal-tax returns and
may be under-estimates.
There are other areas in the Empire with appreciable numbers of
sheep, but these territories are of interest mainly as potential sources
of wool supply in the future and not as present contributors to

world supplies. The most important are Tanganyika Territory,
Somaliland Protectorate, Nigeria and Uganda Protectorate. Tan-
ganyika has about 2 million sheep, but no export trade in wool.
The Somali sheep are also non-woolled; they serve as the chief food
supply of the Somalis. Nigeria possesses about 2 million sheep, and
the Government is exploring the possibility of establishing a wool-
growing industry. The sheep, which are found mainly in the north
of the Colony, are almost all non-woolled, but the climate does not
necessarily debar the raising of woolled sheep. In Uganda Protec-
torate, almost all the 800,000 sheep are native-owned and their wool
production is negligible.
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
South AMERICA.
Argentina .
There is no annual census of sheep in Argentina, enumerations
taking place at irregular intervals. The latest census was under-
taken in 1930 and before this censuses were held in 1914, 1908 and
1895. In addition, an official estimate was made in December,
1922, based on partial returns. The comprehensiveness of the
earlier enumerations is generally held to be somewhat doubtful and,
although the latest results are thought to represent the situation
more accurately, it is obviously hazardous to draw precise conclusions
from the apparent trend of the figures. Moreover, the wide and
irregular intervals between the enumerations and the different months
at which they were taken also render their interpretation somewhat
difficult.
The Argentine sheep population, as recorded at the four last
national enumerations, together with the official estimate for the
year 1922, is indicated in Table 15. It will be seen that a
substantial decrease appears to have taken place since 1895, and
that no continuance of the downward trend has apparently occurred
since 1922 but, for the reasons already given, considerable reserve
should be exercised in the interpretation of these figures.
Although the number of sheep in Argentina in 1930 was approxi-
mately the same as that recorded in 1914, their distribution has
considerably changed, a marked decrease being shown in the

agricultural and cattle-raising provinces of the central region, such as
Buenos Aires and Rio Negro, and a corresponding increase in the
provinces of the south, such as Santa Cruz and Chubut. Between
1914 and 1930 the sheep in the Province of Buenos Aires decreased
from 18*8 millions to 14*1 millions, while those in Santa Cruz and
Chubut rose from 6*o millions to 10*9 millions.
(a) Estimate published by the Argentine Department of Agriculture.
The decline in sheep-raising in Argentina before the war was
largely due to its displacement by cattle-ranching and arable farming,
while the recent increase in sheep-raising in the south is largely due
to the raising of flocks in those parts of the country where, owing
to the severe climate, cattle-ranching and arable farming offer no
serious competition to sheep-raising and where sheep are less subject
to disease than in the warmer north. It is not probable that the
flocks in the south will show any rapid expansion in the future, as
the sheep-raising capacity of that region is limited by its general
barrenness.* A contributory factor in the general decline in sheep
numbers is the more careful breeding which, while improving the
quality of the meat and fleece, has tended to prevent an indiscriminate
increase in the sheep population.
Uruguay.
Although it is the smallest of the South American republics,
Uruguay has the second largest sheep population of the sub-continent.
There are over 280 sheep per square mile, or about the same as in
New Zealand, and about 12 sheep per inhabitant. The following
table indicates the development of the Uruguayan sheep flocks since
1900.

of Boston, Buenos Aires Branch, 1928.

(а) Estimate published by International Institute of Agriculture.
(б) Estimate published in South American Handbook. 1931.
The decline and rise in sheep farming in Uruguay have until
recently run almost parallel with similar movements in cattle num-
bers, so that in the past the competition with cattle cannot be
assigned as a cause of the fluctuations in the sheep population.
More recently, the situation has changed and since 1924 there has
been a marked tendency for sheep to oust cattle, and certain areas
formerly used exclusively for cattle are now in addition raising sheep.
This is reflected in the decrease in cattle numbers from 8-4 million
head in 1924 to 7-1 million head in 1930 and in the increase in sheep
numbers during the same period from 14*4 to 20‘6 million head.
Peru.
There are few statistics of the sheep population of Peru. An official
estimate for 1922, published in the Yearbook of the International
Institute of Agriculture, placed the sheep population at 11 • 3 millions,
as compared with 7-0 millions in 1917. A later authoritative
estimate* suggests a further increase since 1922, the population being
given as 12-6 millions for “ circa 1925.” Peru has large tracts of land
suitable for sheep-raising and in 1921 the authorities established
a model sheep farm, where they are pursuing experiments in breeding,
with the object of arriving at a type of sheep which will bear a heavier
fleece and suit the climatic conditions obtaining in the highland
* See “ The Prospective Development of Peru as a Sheep-raising and Wool-
growing Country,” by Professor A. F. Barker, 1927. At the 1929 census, the results
of which have since been received, 11-2 million sheep were enumerated.

region. Should these experiments succeed, it is possible that Peru
will become a much more important sheep-raising country than it is
to-day. Peru also raises appreciable numbers of other wool-bearing
animals, an account of which is given in Chapter 8.
Brazil.
In Brazil, cattle-ranching is of far more importance than sheep-
raising, the cattle exceeding the sheep by about four to one. A
national census was held in 1912-13, when about 10 million sheep
were enumerated in the different States, but at varying dates in
these two years. According to a census taken on Ist September,
1920, there were 7,933,000 sheep in the Republic, somewhat more
than one-half being located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, which
is situated in the extreme south of the Republic, where the climate is
temperate. There is no later figure for the whole of the Republic,
but the sheep flocks of Rio Grande do Sul increased by over
40 per cent, between 1920 and 1929, and it may perhaps be assumed
that the total for the whole country is now between 10 and 11
millions, or about the same as in 1912-13. The following table
gives the available sheep statistics of Brazil.
(a) Not available.


Other Foreign Countries in South America.
The other countries in South America are estimated to have, in
the aggregate, about 14 million sheep, found mainly in Chile which,
according to the census returns of June 30th, 1930, had 6*3
million sheep, and Bolivia which, according to the official estimate
of 1929, had about 5J million sheep. More than one-half of the flocks
of Chile are located in the Magellanes Territory, which includes the
Chilean part of Tierra del Fuego, where sheep-raising is the principal
industry, despite the severity of the climate. The wools from this
region are shipped from the port of Magellanes, formerly known as
Punta Arenas, and are known in the trade as “ Punta Arenas ”.
This description also covers wool produced in the Argentine part of
Tierra del Fuego and exported through the port of Magellanes, but
Punta Arenas wools are mainly of Chilean origin. From the published
statistics it appears that the sheep flocks of Bolivia are increasing,
but that country is much more important as an exporter of alpaca
than of sheep’s wool. The remaining countries are of very minor
importance from the point of view of the sheep industry ; Colombia
has about 800,000 sheep, Ecuador about 700,000, Paraguay about
200,000, and Venezuela about 100,000.
North America.
The United States of America.
The sheep population of the United States, which owns the bulk
of the flocks of North America, has increased rapidly in the last few
years. Comparatively little reduction took place during the war,
and although a period of stagnation followed, recent years have
witnessed a steady increase which has raised sheep numbers to the
highest level yet recorded.* The United States has the third largest
sheep population of the world, being exceeded only by the Soviet
Union (Russia) and the Commonwealth of Australia.
The development of the United States’ sheep population is indicated
in the following table, which gives the estimates of the United States
Department of Agriculture as at Ist January of each year.
* Actually the highest figure recorded was 61J millions at the census held
in 1900, but this enumeration was taken on June Ist, and is not, therefore, comparable
with the annual estimates which relate to January Ist,

(See " Yearbook of Agriculture, 1932.”)


There was an appreciable downward movement in the sheep
numbers in the pre-war quinquennium, but there was little movement
during the war period except right at the end when there was a slight
rise which was maintained in the two following years. There then
followed a slight downward movement which by 1922 brought the
sheep population back again to its war-time level. From 1924 a
definite upward movement again set in, which has brought the
sheep population to a point nearly 50 per cent, above the lowest post-
war figure. The recent increase has been general, but least pro-
nounced in the North Atlantic division, where only 2 per cent, of
the sheep are located, and most marked in the South Central division.
This power of increase in so relatively short a period marks the
United States as one of the important factors in the potential growth
of the world’s sheep population. It has enormous tracts of pasturage
eminently suitable for sheep-raising and, in addition, a large domestic
market for both mutton and wool. The recovery in the sheep
population is indicative less of a probable export of wool in future
years than of a tendency, apparent in other fields of agriculture, to
reduce the United States’ dependence upon foreign sources for raw
material. Wool-production costs at present ruling in the United
States under tariff conditions indicate no likelihood of that country
becoming an exporter of raw wool and the growth in the sheep
population may, therefore, be expected to cease when wool production
is sufficient to meet domestic requirements of the qualities of wool
grown on American sheep. No carpet wool is produced in America
and imports of this type of wool in 1931 amounted to over 120
million lbs. representing 76 per cent, of the total imports of that year.
As regards carding and combing wools, it is estimated that all but
7 per cent, of the total quantity retained for consumption in 1931
was domestic produce. The American textile industry caters
almost exclusively for the home market and the small export trade
in wool textile manufactures shows no signs of expansion.
Central America.
This group of countries is of little importance, the total sheep
population being less than four millions, of which two-thirds are in
Mexico and the rest mainly in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and
Cuba. The latest estimates for the chief Central American countries
are shown in Table 19. From the point of view of wool production,
the sheep population of these areas may virtually be neglected.

The Soviet Union (Russia).
The Soviet Union is an important sheep-raising area, not only on
account of the present dimensions of the sheep population but more
particularly on account of the enormous potentialities for develop-
ment that this large region provides.
No organised census of live-stock was carried out in the old Russian
Empire, but estimates of the sheep population were published from
time to time by the Central Office of Statistics and by the Veterinary
Administration. It has since been realised that both sets of figures
under-estimated the number of sheep in the country, and it is not
possible, therefore, to form any comparison between the sheep
population of the old Russian Empire and that of the present Soviet
Union.
The first Russian census of live-stock was held in 1916, but it did
not include either the whole of pre-war Russia or the whole of the
present area of the Soviet Union. The results obtained have been
mainly utilised by the Soviet authorities to arrive at the estimate
of 113 millions as the total sheep population in 1916 within the present
boundaries.
Annual figures are available for the Soviet Union for recent years,
and these show that by 1925 the flocks had recovered from the
war and revolution losses and had again reached the 1916 level.
Further considerable growth in the flocks was effected in the next
few years and by 1928 they numbered nearly 134 millions. This
level was practically maintained in 1929, but in 1930 a reduction
to 100,500,000 occurred, mainly due to wholesale slaughterings of

which the Soviet authorities carried out in the winter of 1929-30.
The following table gives the latest official estimates that have
been traced of the sheep of the Soviet Union, together with the
official 1916 estimate. These figures do not include goats.

and 1931, estimates of Central Statistical Branch of State Planning Board, quoted in
“ Shersteanoe Delo ” (Journal of the Textile Trust), Feb.-Mar. 1931.
Table 21 shows the distribution of the Russian flocks in the
years 1927, 1928 and 1929. It will be seen that with one or two
exceptions the recent development has been general throughout the
Union. The principal sheep-raising areas are the Kazakstan
Republic and Siberia, which together account for about one-quarter
of the Russian sheep.
Although increasing under the Five-Year Plan, sheep on socialised
farms still form only a small fraction of the total flocks. The
classification of the sheep population according to types of farm is
given in Table 22. The Plan provides for an increase in the
number on State Farms to 7-3 million and on Collective Farms to
9 million in 1932.* The significance of these figures from the wool
production point of view depends, of course, on the quality of the
sheep raised.

A further increase in the sheep population of Russia, despite the
appreciable set-back in 1930, may reasonably be anticipated.
Although there were more sheep in Russia in 1929 than in any other
country in the world, not excluding the Commonwealth of Australia,
there were less than one sheep per inhabitant and only about
twelve sheep per square mile.
Spain.
Sheep are the most numerous live-stock in Spain, the number
exceeding the cattle, horses, goats and pigs considered in the aggre-
gate. The sheep population steadily increased from the beginning
(a) Number enumerated at Census of 30th May, 1929, and not strictly
comparable with the official estimates for the previous years which
relate to 31st December.


of the century and even during the war there was no halt in the
upward trend. There has, however, been no appreciable change in
the numbers during the past decade. Latest figures place the sheep
population of Spain at about 20 million, as against 13-4 million in
1891, 13*5 million in 1906 and 16-4 mil]ion just before the war.
The development since 1891 is indicated in the preceding table.
The trend suggests that no very rapid or material increase is likely in
the future. So marked a stability in numbers over a period of ten
years, following many years of a gradual development, suggests that
the peak may have been reached.
Roumania.
The sheep population of Roumania has more than doubled since
the beginning of the century, but the major part of the increase is
due to the extension of Roumania’s frontiers. Table 24 shows
the development of the sheep population since 1900. It will be seen
that the sheep numbers within the present boundaries are slightly
greater than in the same area in 1910-11, increases in the Old Kingdom
and Bessarabia being somewhat larger than the decrease in Tran-
sylvania.
A general increase in the flocks in the years following the end of
the war brought the total for the whole country to a peak of about
13£ millions in 1924 and 1926, since when there has been a slow
decline, resulting in the numbers falling by 1930 to the level
of 1922.
France.
France, both before and during the war, had been experiencing a
consistent diminution in her sheep population, and this reduction
was one of the outstanding features of the European sheep-raising
industry. The principal causes were the competition of wools from
the Southern Hemisphere, the shortage of shepherds, and the decrease
of sheep pasturage. Between 1867 and 1913 the sheep population of
France fell from 30 millions to 16 millions, and by 1919 there had
been a further fall to 9 millions. The extension of the French
frontiers as a result of the 1919 Peace Treaty made only an insignifi-
cant addition to her sheep population. A slow recovery has been
in evidence since the war, but for the last six years numbers have been
fairly steady at between 10 and 11 millions. This slow recovery is
attributed to a shortage of skilled shepherds and to the poor demand for

Italy.
No strictly comparable figures are available of the sheep population
of Italy between 1908 and 1930. According to the census taken on
19th March, 1930, there were then 9*9 million sheep in Italy, in
comparison with 11*2 million in March, 1908, representing a loss
of 11 per cent. The loss is rather greater if allowance is made for
the additional area covered by the 1930 census, namely, Trent,
Trieste and Zara. The reduction has been general throughout the
whole of the Kingdom, with the exception of Sardinia —an important
sheep-raising area producing carpet wool —where a small increase
has taken place. Table 26 shows the development of the sheep
population of Italy since 1881.

the war, and this factor can almost be ignored in this connection.
Since the termination of the war, the flocks appear to have decreased
somewhat, as is shown in the preceding table, which indicates the
movement in the sheep population since the beginning of the century.
Yugoslavia.
According to the published statistics, the sheep population of
Yugoslavia has remained fairly steady in recent years at a little less
than 8 millions. Detailed figures are shown in Table 28, together
with an estimate for the same area in 1910-11. It will be seen that
Yugoslavia gained a large increase in sheep population as a result of
the change of frontiers after the war.
{a) From “ Agricultural Survey of Europe: The Danube Basin,
Part 2 ” (United States Department of Agriculture Technical Bulletin
No. 126). The figure of 10-5 million for 1910-11 was compiled as
follows:—Former Kingdom of Serbia, 3-8; Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2-5 ;
South Serbia, 1-4; Dalmatia, 0-9; Montenegro, 0-2; other dis-
tricts, 1 •7.
Sheep are by far the most numerous live-stock raised in Yugoslavia,
which is largely a mountainous country with large tracts of pasturage
suitable only for sheep. The enumeration of the sheep population

has been extremely difficult, especially in the most populous sheep
regions : it has, in fact, been suggested that the actual sheep popula-
tion may be about 50 per cent, higher than the official estimates
indicate.*
Greece.
The sheep population of Greece is considerably above the 1911
level, but this is largely due to the accretion of territory since that
year. Since 1920 the sheep, on the whole, have been on a slightly
higher level than before the war. Table 29 gives the annual figures
since 1920 and two estimates for pre-war years.
(a) Estimate published by United States Department of Agriculture.
Germany.
The sheep population of Germany has decreased very rapidly since
the beginning of the century and is now about one-third of its former
size. The reduction, like that of the French sheep numbers, has been
going on over a long period, and since 1864, when the maximum
number of 29-7 million sheep was recorded, the loss has amounted
to over 26 millions, the larger part of which was experienced before
the beginning of the present century. The changes in the sheep

population since 1897 are indicated in Table 30, which incidentally
shows that the loss of territory resulting from the Peace Treaties
caused only a small diminution in the sheep flocks.
The large decrease in sheep numbers in Germany has been attri-
buted * to the following factors:—(i) the development of sheep-raising
overseas with lower production costs ; (ii) the development of inten-
sive agriculture in Germany, where the greater part of the land
hitherto used for sheep-raising was found to be suitable for more
profitable forms of enterprise ; it is of interest to note that no other

category of live-stock has shown a similar decrease —pigs and poultry

Portugal.
Sheep are the principal live-stock kept in Portugal, and they are
raised primarily for mutton. Except in certain favoured regions,
there are no large areas really suitable for sheep farming and, in
general, the sheep have poor resources.* Enumerations of live-stock
are only taken at long intervals, and these indicate a fairly stable
sheep population of between 3 and 4 million head. The results of
the censuses of 1870, 1906 and 1920, together with the official estimate
of 1925, are given in Table 31. Unofficial estimates are somewhat
higher.
(a) Excluding the Azores and Madeira (37,000 sheep in 1926).
Poland.
There are about 2,500,000 sheep in Poland, this number representing
a decrease of about 40 per cent., as compared with the same area
before the war. The available statistics of Poland’s sheep population
are summarised in Table 32.
Other Foreign Countries in Europe.
The remaining European countries, which include Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Finland, the Baltic States, the Scandinavian coun-
tries, Iceland and Albania, have in the aggregate about 12 million
sheep and the general trend during the post-war period has been
downward. Detailed figures are given in the composite table of the
world’s sheep in Appendix I, and do not call for any special comment.

There exists no accurate estimate of the sheep population of this

Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia and Tibet. Information
furnished by the courtesy of the Chinese Customs Office, places the
number of sheep at about 45 millions, but this figure is very
approximate, as it is compiled from estimates for the various
Provinces made in different years; moreover, figures for some of
the Provinces probably include goats, while Tibet and certain other
Provinces are not included because estimates are not available.
The sheep of China proper are mostly in the Northern Provinces.

Persia.
Persia is an important sheep-raising country, but little reliable
information as to the extent of the industry is available. According
to the United States Yearbook of Agriculture, 1931, there were
estimated to be about 17 million sheep in Persia in 1926; official
estimates for previous or subsequent years have not been traced.
Turkey.
In the former Ottoman Empire in 1912 there were about 27 million
sheep. Within the present boundaries of Turkey there are only
about 11 million sheep. Part of this decrease is due to loss of
territory, but there was also a considerable reduction during the
war years in the sheep population within the present frontiers, and
this loss has not yet been made good. Indeed, there has been,
according to the numbers declared for tax purposes, a decline in the
flocks since 1927. Table 33 gives the post-war figures since 1923,
together with a pre-war figure for the Ottoman Empire, and an
estimate of the pre-war sheep population within the present frontiers
of Turkey.

Other Foreign Countries in Asia.
Arabia, which consists of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, Yemen,
Oman and Kuwait, is estimated to have about 3*5 million sheep,
mainly of the fat-tailed variety, but no census has been taken and
there are no data on which an estimate of the trend can be based.
Arabia is inhabited for the most part by nomadic tribes, whose liveli-
hood is largely dependent on the breeding of sheep, goats and camels.
The only other countries in Asia with a sheep population of any
appreciable magnitude are Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The number
of sheep in Afghanistan is not known. Before the war Iraq and
Syria formed part of the Ottoman Empire and no pre-war statistics
for either country are available. There are now slightly more than
4 million sheep in Iraq and between 2 and 3 million in Syria.
Africa.
French North African Colonies — Algeria, Morocco and Tunis.
The French colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunis constitute
next to the Union of South Africa the second largest sheep-raising
area in the African Continent. Table 34 indicates the movement
of the sheep population of each colony since the beginning of the
century, as far as statistics are available. The Algerian flocks are
smaller than before the war, but larger numbers in Morocco and
Tunis bring the aggregate sheep population of the three colonies
above the pre-war level.
Owing to the conditions of climate and pasturage obtaining in
Algeria, sheep-raising is only possible in the northern part of the
country. Even here, there is a shortage of feed in the summer,
which is met by driving the flocks into the mountains, where they
remain until the autumn. There are very few European sheep
farmers, the flocks being almost entirely in the hands of natives, by
whom the production for market of lambs and butter is regarded as
of more importance than wool production. The sheep are coarse-
woolled. Attempts have been made to raise merino sheep, but these
are still in the experimental stage and no early development of a
merino industry seems probable*

Sheep-raising in Morocco is almost entirely confined to the coastal
area to the north of the Atlas mountains. The present sheep popula-
tion (based on tax returns) is about 8 million head, and there appears
to be little scope for any large expansion in the near future. They
are all coarse-woolled; although conditions are very suitable for
merino sheep, none are raised because the nomadic natives, who own
all but 10 per cent, of the flocks, show no inclination to alter their
methods of management.
(a) Figures are probably incomplete: the total sheep population in 1929 was
estimated at 10 million for Algeria and between 8 and 10 million for Morocco (see
“ Le Pecore e le Lane dell’Africa Settentrionale ”, by A. Maugini. R. Giuliani and
C. G. Gaia).

number of goats in the combined figures of sheep and goats for
Mauretania and Senegal, the sheep population of French West
Africa (including French Sudan) may be roughly assessed at about
5J millions in 1929 as against about 4| millions in 1921, which repre-
sents an increase of about 20 per cent. These estimates are based
on tax returns, and they probably underestimate the actual number
of sheep in the area in question. The " Union Ovine Coloniale ”
considers it probable that there are nearly 10 million sheep in this
area.
The flocks are located principally in French Sudan, where the sheep
population increased steadily from 2,164,000 in 1921 to 2,739,000 in
1930. Table 35 shows the estimated sheep population of the
various colonies for 1921, 1925 and 1929. The sheep are almost
entirely non-woolled, except in French Sudan, where both woolled
and non-woolled are kept.

CHAPTER 2.—TYPES OF SHEEP.
An analysis of the sheep population of the world would be incom-
plete if left at a mere discussion of numbers. The types range from
the sheep which produces no wool of commercial value to the merino
sheep which produces the finest fleece. Between these two extremes
is a large number of varieties, but it is clear, in view of the deficiency
of the statistics with regard to sheep numbers, that the available
information as to sheep types will also be far from complete.
At the present time steps are being taken in many parts of the
world to improve the value of the sheep raised. J The aim may be
either a better carcass or an improvement in the weight or quality
of the fleece or a combination of both. The alternative methods are

improvement of the flocks by selection ; (iii) acclimatising imported
sheep; (iv) attention to hygiene (e.g., prevention of disease).
Some indication of the use of imported stud sheep is afforded by
Table 37 which gives the exports from the United Kingdom and
Australia only and does not of course reflect the volume of world
trade in this connection.
{a) For particulars of the breeds exported from the United Kingdom see “ Report
of Proceedings under the Diseases of Animals Acts for 1930 ” presented to the Secretary
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
( b ) Figures refer to twelve months ended 30th June of following year.
Note. —ln 1931, only 1,094 stud sheep and lambs were exported from the United
Kingdom, the principal countries of consignment being Irish Free State (442),
Argentina 187), and Union of South Africa (138). Later figures for Australia are not
available but export is virtually prohibited.


Broadly speaking, there are three main sheep types : (i) the merino,
(ii) the crossbred, and (iii) the native. The first two are heavy-woolled
types. The merino sheep has a limited amount of flesh but bears
an abundance of fine wool and is frequently of smaller size than the
crossbred sheep. Sheep of the crossbred type produce a high quality
of mutton for which they are largely bred, and also a valuable fleece
covering a wide range of qualities but in the main much coarser
than the merino, although in exceptional cases not widely differing
in fineness from the coarsest qualities of the merino. The term
“ crossbred ” is here used to denote sheep yielding wool of the quality
known as “ crossbred ” and does not refer to sheep which are the
result of cross-breeding.
The third type comprises various kinds of sheep producing either
a short, coarse wool or a hairy fibre of little or no commercial value.
The first class are known as low-woolled and the second as non-
woolled. In the following paragraphs the available information as to
the sheep types in the principal sheep-raising countries of the world
will be summarised and commented upon.
BRITISH EMPIRE COUNTRIES.
Commonwealth of Australia.
Before the introduction of the frozen meat trade, the main use of
the Australian sheep was its fleece, and the merino sheep was intro-
duced very early in Australian pastoral history with the object of
breeding sheep principally for wool. The merino type still pre-
dominates, but wide fluctuations in its relative importance have
been manifest within the last two decades, as is indicated by the
proportion of merino wool produced from season to season. From
1911-12 to 1920-21, the proportion fell steadily from about 81 per
cent, to about 66 per cent., which appears to have been the lowest
point reached within the last twenty years. The proportion then
rose, and in the 1930-31 season it attained 84 per cent, of the total
production. The increase in the proportion of crossbred sheep
during the war was no doubt due to the abnormal demand for mutton
and crossbred wools for war supplies then ruling. In this connection
it would appear that the pasturage and climate in Australia are more
suited to the breeding of the merino type of sheep than in any other
large sheep-raising area in the world, with the exception of South
Africa; the other countries are more favourably situated for breeding

crossbred sheep with a relatively coarser wool. Many parts of the
Commonwealth are quite unsuitable for raising crossbred sheep on
account of the low rainfall.
The Union of South Africa.
The proportion of woolled sheep in the Union has gradually risen
from about 70 per cent, at the beginning of the century to about
90 per cent, at the present time. The merino is the most wide-spread
type of woolled sheep, as it is favoured by the climate and scanty
food supply, which render impracticable the breeding of mutton
sheep. It is excluded only from those areas where disease is severe
or the bush is dense, and in such territories the non-woolled type is
raised. The importance of the merino in recent years in European-
owned flocks, which represent the great bulk of the sheep, is
indicated in the following table.
The number of woolled sheep in the Union has doubled during the
past twenty years and during this period much progress has also
been made in the weight and quality of the fleece. This improvement
has been largely due to the introduction of Australian stud sheep.
New Zealand.
In the early days of the Dominion, the sheep population consisted
largely of merinos and at the present time, particularly in South
Island, sheep of merino ancestry are to be found in large numbers.


But the present sheep population of New Zealand as a whole is derived
from British breeds and is, therefore, of the crossbred type. The
change-over from merino to crossbred sheep coincided with, and was
undoubtedly produced by, the development of refrigeration and the
oversea trade in frozen meat, which commenced in the 80’s of last
century. Whereas in 1882 about 90 per cent, of the wool produced
in New Zealand was merino, the proportion of merino in the clip
has fallen to about 2 per cent, at the present time. The sheep industry
in the Dominion is almost entirely confined to the breeding of sheep
to serve the dual purpose of producing the very best meat as well as
the best wool which breeding along these lines will permit.
The United Kingdom.
No sheep of the merino type are raised in the United Kingdom,
but the flocks comprise a wide variety of sheep mostly falling within
the crossbred category. There are over thirty different breeds, and
almost each county has its characteristic breed. The most usual plan
is to divide them into the Long-woolled, Down and Mountain classes.*
The Indian Empire.
In the north-west of India the sheep are mainly of the native type,
yielding a short wool and a light fleece, while in Central and Southern
India the flocks consist of hair-sheep. The climate militates against
a heavily-woolled sheep. In most localities mutton is the prime con-
sideration in sheep-raising, and little attention is given to the fleece,
but merinos have been introduced by the Civil Veterinary Department
of the Punjab and are said to have fared well, and the corresponding
Department in the United Provinces has also given attention to
sheep-breeding for some time. The Indian Munitions Board expressed
the opinion during the war that the Indian sheep could be readily
improved, but progress in this direction is necessarily slow.
Canada.
Canada still has some indigenous sheep of primitive kind in the
Rocky Mountains, but the sheep-raising industry has developed from
imported sheep. Mutton and lamb production is the chief interest
and the imported sheep have come mainly from the United Kingdom
and the United States of America. In the ranching country of
Saskatchewan and Alberta, and in the high lands of British Columbia
* For further details, see “ British Breeds of Live Stock.” (Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries, Miscellaneous Publication No. 7).


where sheep are kept under range conditions, considerable use is
made of Rambouillet sheep, which are of the merino type, and the
flocks consist largely of a Rambouillet-mutton cross. Elsewhere,
crossbred sheep are found and these constitute at least two-thirds
of the Dominion’s sheep population.
Experiments are being conducted under the auspices of the Cana-
dian National Research Council to breed a type of sheep producing
a superior quality of wool and suited to Canadian conditions.
The Irish Free State.
The sheep of the Irish Free State may be regarded as falling within
the crossbred type, the two main categories being the lowland and
the mountain class. Mutton and lamb are the prime objects of sheep-
raising in the Free State.
Other Empire Countries.
In the Falkland Islands, the severity of the climate imposes a strict
limit on the type of sheep raised and the flocks consist of a hardy
sheep of the crossbred category. The sheep are bred chiefly for their
wool, nearly all of which is exported, but their mutton is an important
part of the local food supply.
The sheep of Basutoland are woolled but the wool is of inferior
quality, and steps have been taken to improve the sheep by distri-
buting merino rams to the native sheep-farmers and by the eradication
of disease, particularly scab.
The sheep in South-West Africa Territory are mainly of the cross-
bred type, but merinos are also raised, as was indicated in Table 14.
The remaining Empire countries, situated in various parts of the
world, contain sheep of various types. As their contribution to the
world’s supply of wool is relatively small, no detailed description
here is called for.
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
SOUTH AMERICA.
Argentina.
In Argentina, which is the chief sheep-raising area of South America,
the bulk of the sheep are of British breeds, and the Argentine sheep
population may, therefore, be regarded as being largely of the cross


bred type, although a considerable proportion is intermediate between
the crossbred and the merino types, and may be classed as of the
merino type.
At the census taken in 1930 the numbers of the principal breeds
were given as follows : —Argentine merino, 13,191,000 ; Australian
merino, 1,133,000 ; crossbred breeds, 25,862,000 (of which 14,504,000
were Lincolns and 7,557,000 Romney Marsh).
During the last few years there has been a considerable improve-
ment in the Argentine sheep flocks, judging by the decreasing
proportion of coarse wool in the total clip.* There is a consistent
use of pedigree sheep imported from the United Kingdom.
Uruguay.
In Uruguay about one-third of the sheep are of the merino type,
and the bulk of the remainder fall into the crossbred category. Native
sheep represent a very small proportion of the whole. Between 1916
and 1924 the proportion of merinos and sheep of the merino type
declined from 38 per cent, of the total to 32 per cent.
Other Foreign Countries in South America.
The Peruvian flocks are of an inferior low-woolled type but, as
mentioned in Chapter I, active steps have recently been taken to
improve the wool-bearing capacity of the sheep of the country. In
Brazil, the sheep are partly non-woolled but mostly of a low-woolled
type with an average production of about 3| lbs. per head. They
are located for the most part in the southern States. Since 1926
Brazil has been importing fair numbers of stud sheep from the United
Kingdom. In Chile about one-half of the sheep are of the crossbred
type (chiefly the Romney Marsh breed), and these are concentrated
in the extreme south of the mainland and in Tierra del Fuego. It is
stated that they are being improved both as regards the quality
of their wool and the average productionf. The remainder are low-
woolled sheep, such as are raised in Peru. The sheep of Bolivia
approximate to the crossbred type. In Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay
and Venezuela the sheep are largely non-woolled.
* See Table 63.
f See “ Report on Economic Conditions in Chile, November, 1929 ” (Department
of Overseas Trade).


North America.
The United States of America.
On the basis of the estimated proportion of merino wool in the
American clip* it may be assumed that the sheep of the United
States are comprised of about equal proportions of the merino and
crossbred types. The merino predominates in the western States,
where the drier climate and the pasturage are more suitable to these
types. The crossbreds are found for the most part in the eastern
States. The tendency of recent years has been for the proportion of
the merino type to increase.
Central America.
Mexico is the only important sheep-raising country in this region :
a few merinos are raised there, but non-woolled sheep predominate.!
Elsewhere, the sheep in general are either low-woolled or non-woolled.
Europe.
All three broad types of sheep are found in Europe, but the
different types are not restricted to particular areas, and much
intermingling occurs. The relative importance of the types in the
more important sheep-raising countries of Europe is indicated in the
following paragraphs.
The Soviet Union {Russia).
The great bulk of the sheep in the Soviet Union are coarse-
woolled, and merino sheep form only a very small proportion of the
flocks. According to information contained in the “ Economic
Review of the Soviet Union,” the merinos in 1916, when the sheep
population was about 113 millions, numbered 4\ millions, whereas
in 1920 there were only 1J millions, and in 1922 less than 500,000.
Appreciable imports of stud sheep have since been made from Aus-
tralia, Argentina, and the United Kingdom, and much attention is
being paid by the authorities to questions of stock-breeding as part
of the plan for the socialisation of farms. In 1930, there were 116
State Sheep Farms with 2-5 million sheep and steps are being taken
to increase the production and improve the quality of the wool.
The authorities are also attempting to improve the sheep on the

New York State College of Agriculture, Cornell University). Further reference to

collectivised holdings by cross-breeding. It is possible, of course,
that some radical changes in the sheep type in Russia may evolve
from these measures, but the process will be necessarily slow. The
latest information that has been traced* classifies the Russian sheep
in 1930 as follows : —coarse-woolled 97 per cent.; crossbred 1-5 per
cent.; merino, 1• 5 per cent.
Spain.
Spain owns both merinos and coarse-woolled sheep, the latter
comprising about three-quarters of the whole. The merinos are
concentrated in the south of the peninsula. Spain, the pioneer of
merino sheep-raising, has long since been outdistanced as regards
both numbers and quality.
Roumania.
In the main the sheep of Roumania are coarse-woolled and milk-
production is regarded as of more importance than the production of
wool or skins. There are several varieties of sheep in Roumania,
such as the original mountain sheep, the Czurcana sheep of the Old
Kingdom and the Raczka and Czigaia sheep of the recently acquired
territory of Transylvania.
France.
The sheep of France are mainly of the crossbred type, but there
are substantial numbers of merino sheep and some low-woolled sheep.
Sheep of merino type probably constitute one-third of the whole.
The chief merino type is the Rambouillet. The Rambouillet stud
farm dates from 1786 when the Government introduced some Spanish
merinos to improve the fleece of the French flocks. The farm at
Rambouillet has not only furnished the blood-stock for the improve-
ment of the French flocks, but also contributed to the initial develop-
ment of fine-wool production in Australia and South Africa as well
as in Germany, the United States of America and Canada.
Italy.
Approximately one-half of the sheep of Italy are coarse-woolled,
and the remainder may be classified as of the crossbred type.f There
are also some merino sheep but the number is small. The coarse-
woolled sheep are largely found in Sardinia and the crossbreds in the
central and southern part of the mainland. Italian sheep are raised for

Italiana, 1930.)


the production of wool, meat and milk. In some regions, such as
Sardinia and Latium, the Province of Rome, the production of cheese
from sheep’s milk is an important industry. The Government is
paying attention to the improvement of the livestock of the country
and it is possible that some increase in the wool-bearing capacity of
the sheep may result.
Bulgaria.
Bulgarian sheep are chiefly of the native type, the most common
breed being the “ Czigaia ”. The number of sheep of improved
breeds is small, but is increasing. Between 1920 and 1926 the number
of improved sheep (native and foreign) increased by 140,000, whereas
the native sheep declined by 325,000.*
Germany.
All three main types of sheep are found in Germany, but the
merinos and the crossbreds constitute by far the larger proportion of
the flocks. There are two classes of merino sheep, namely the German
pure-bred merino and the German merino-mutton breed, which
approaches closely to a fine-woolled crossbred type. The latter
class (which comprises the Kamwollschaf, bred mainly for its wool,
and the Fleischwollschaf, bred mainly for its carcass), is the more
popular and is increasing at the expense of the pure-bred merino.
Crossbred sheep of British stock were introduced into Germany about
the middle of last century. At one time Germany had an important
merino sheep-raising industry which was concentrated in Saxony and
Silesia, and produced a wool of exceptional fineness. The number of
merino sheep in Germany declined after the middle of the nineteenth
century.
Other Foreign Countries in Europe.
The native sheep of Hungary have been improved by crossing,
firstly with sheep from Germany, later with Italian sheep and finally
with merinos from Spain, Germany and France. At present the
great bulk of the Hungarian flocks are of the merino type. The
remainder are almost entirely coarse-woolled sheep of the Raczka and
Czigaia breeds.!
The Portuguese sheep population consists of two distinct types,
namely, merinos and a coarse-woolled type known as Bordaleira.
The latter comprises several varieties, the most common being that
found chiefly in Beira Province.
* See “ Yearbook of International Institute of Agriculture, 1929-30."
f See article by Dr. Joseph Schandl in Monthly Bulletin of Agricultural Science,
October, 1931 (published by International Institute of Agriculture).


In the western provinces of Poland sheep of the merino type
predominate. Elsewhere the sheep consist of two varieties, both
coarse-woolled, namely, the “ Swiniarka,” and the “ Wrzosowka ”.§
At the last census taken on 30th June, 1929, fine-woolled sheep
constituted less than one-quarter of the total.
The countries not specifically mentioned, namely Albania, the
Baltic States, Greece, Yugoslavia, Norway, etc., are of minor
importance from the point of view of wool production. Their
sheep are all of the woolled types but mainly of the coarser varieties,
Asia.
Almost the whole of the sheep population of Asia is of the native
type but, as one would expect from the vast range of latitude in
this continent, there are many varieties. The sheep are mainly low-
woolled, but there are considerable numbers of non-woolled sheep,
which constitute about one-quarter of the Asiatic sheep population
outside the Soviet Union. The non-woolled sheep are located chiefly
in the southern half of India. The sheep of China, the Chinese
Dependencies, Northern India, Persia and Turkey comprise the great
bulk of the woolled sheep. In certain countries, notably India, China
and Persia, efforts are being made to improve the sheep.
In China, there are several experimental stations where sheep are
being crossed with merinos with the object of producing a sheep with
long and fine wool capable of withstanding local conditions. A
material improvement in the weight and quality of the wool from the
large Chinese sheep population would result in an important increase
in the world’s supplies of the finer wools.
The sheep of Persia produce a carpet wool of good quality. In
Turkey, although climatic conditions are suitable for sheep raising,
the industry is conducted on somewhat primitive fines and little
attention is paid to improving the type of sheep kept.
Africa.
In the French North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and
Tunis and the Italian Colony of Libya (Tripofitania and Cyrenaica)
the sheep are of the native type, producing a coarse wool. The
improvement of the sheep-raising industry in the French North
§ Information communicated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, United
States Department of Agriculture.


African Colonies is being encouraged by the French Government,
working through the Union Ovine de I’Afrique du Nord, which was
formed for this purpose some years ago. In Algeria some attempts
have been made to improve the local sheep both by crossing and
selection, but no result has yet been achieved.* In Morocco steps
have been taken to improve the local sheep by crossing with merinos
imported from France and Australia, attention being devoted
principally to the Arabian breed, which has a good fleece. These
experiments have so far given no definite results, but they are being
continued.* There are several breeds of sheep in Tunis, including
the Barbaresca, a fat-tailed variety. Various types have been imported
for experimental purposes. Some Australian merinos were imported
in 1927, but were found to be unsuitable to the climate.
In Tripolitania, the sheep are a fat-tailed race known as the
Barbaresca, which is very successful in resisting drought and food
scarcity. The fleece weighs on an average about 51b. and the
wool is long and coarse. Experiments in crossing with Rambouillets
have proved unsuccessful. Cyrenaican sheep are of the same race
but of a slightly better quality, as the conditions there are, on the
whole, more suitable for sheep-raising. No large-scale experiments
to improve the sheep have yet been carried out.*
In French West Africa three breeds are found, namely, the Peule,
the Maure and the Macina. Only the last-named is woolled, and
constitutes about one-quarter of the total flocks.f The Macinas are
only found in appreciable numbers in French Sudan. Their fleece
weighs but 21b. and contains much coarse hair. Experiments to
improve the quality and quantity of the wool of these sheep date
from 1908 and, with this object, sheep of merino type have been
imported from Algeria, South Africa and Australia. At the present
time Rambouillet rams are being acclimatised for crossing at a
Government farm and Australian Merino rams at a private farm.
Similar experiments are being made elsewhere with the non-woolled
sheep of French Sudan. The French authorities anticipate that
eventually a crossbred sheep with a heavy fleece will be evolved.|

In Senegal and Upper Volta, where the sheep are all non-woolled,
attempts have also been made to acclimatise imported merinos, but
little or no definite results have so far been achieved.
The sheep of Egypt are of the native type, either non-woolled or
low-woolled. Similarly, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan the flocks are
mainly non-woolled, but a few woolled sheep (mainly native type)
are raised in certain districts. According to information furnished
by the Sudan Central Economic Board, the climatic and other con-
ditions of the country are unsuitable for the woolled-sheep industry.
Cross-breeding with the Egyptian fat-tailed sheep has not proved
successful.
In Abyssinia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland there are considerable
numbers of sheep, but they are mainly of the non-woolled type.
The other foreign countries in Africa, chiefly Angola, Belgian
Congo, Mozambique and Madagascar, possess few sheep, and these
are predominantly non-woolled. Attempts have recently been made
to improve the local sheep of Madagascar by cross-breeding, but the
matter has not progressed beyond the experimental stage. There is
little likelihood of an expansion in the sheep population of the island
as the climate is in general unsuitable.*

PART II.
THE WORLD PRODUCTION OF RAW WOOL.




CHAPTER 3.—DISTRIBUTION OF THE WORLD’S RAW WOOL
PRODUCTION.
Introduction.
The difficulties of computation met with in the case of the sheep
population are also encountered in attempts to ascertain the raw
wool production. In only a few cases are official figures of output
available, and even these are not always computed on comparable
bases. In a number of cases—and these cover not the least important
areas —the export figures are the only available indications of produc-
tion. These deficiencies in the data prevent the computation of
detailed figures for the long period covered by the figures of the sheep
population given in Chapter 1, but an attempt has been made to
estimate the annual raw wool production of the world for 1924 and
subsequent years. The detailed figures which appear in Appendix II
do not represent the absolute volume of production each year, nor
can a high degree of precision be claimed for many of them, but
they do serve to give an indication of the trend of production.
The figures comprise shorn and skin wool, and also wool recovered
from sheepskins where such information is available. They are com-
puted on a “ greasy ” basis as far as possible which secures some
measure of uniformity as between one country and another.
The following paragraphs are devoted to a consideration of the
volume and trend of production in each of the principal producing
countries. Variation in the production per head of the sheep popula-
tion is, of course, an important factor in determining aggregate
production ; but this is a long-term factor and is not clearly discernible
over relatively short periods and only occasional reference to it will
be found in this chapter.
BRITISH EMPIRE COUNTRIES.
Commonwealth of Australia.
The raw wool production statistics of Australia are among the most
complete in the world. They are compiled by the State statisticians
from data supplied by growers, fellmongers, etc., and in addition an
estimate is made of the amount of wool exported on the skin.

The following table summarises these particulars since 1910-11, and
in addition the year 1891 is included because it was the peak year
as regards sheep population.
(a) Source:—“ Summary of Australian Production Statistics,” published by the
Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. Comparable figures not traced
prior to 1910-11. The 1891 figure, which has been computed by the Commonwealth
Statistician and is quoted by Professor Edward Shann in his " Economic History of
Australia,” is approximate only.
( b) Details not available.
(c) Unrevised figures compiled from returns furnished by farmers. According to
official estimates they should be increased by about 12 per cent, to allow for a defi-
ciency in the returns.
{d) Preliminary Official estimate.


Australia is the world’s largest raw wool producer, and since 1924
has provided nearly one-quarter of the world’s wool. Although the
Australian sheep population in 1930 was at the same level as in 1891,
the production of wool has increased since that year by nearly 50 per
cent. Shorn wool accounts for about 90 per cent, of the aggregate
production, about 3 per cent, is skin wool and the balance is composed
of wool exported on skins. The estimated production in 1929-30
showed a reduction of about 3 per cent, as compared with 1928-29,
which was a peak year, and theo official estimate for 1930-31
indicates a further decline of about 4 per cent. These two succes-
sive reductions in the Australian wool production may be attributed,
at least in part, to rainfall factors. Climatic conditions have a marked
and immediate effect on the weight of the fleece. Reports on the
1931-32 season indicate that the sheep were very heavily woolled
and the preliminary official estimate for that year puts the production
at 950 million lb. or little below the peak of 1928-29. Reports from
trade sources indicate that a clip of record size may again be
anticipated for 1932-33.
New South Wales is the principal wool-growing State, and is
responsible for about one-half of the Commonwealth production ;
Victoria and Queensland, which compete for second place, each pro-
duce about one-sixth of the whole; Western Australia and
South Australia each produce about 70 mfllion lb., or about
one-twelfth of the aggregate production, though Western Australia
has the larger sheep population. Table 40 shows the total annual
production of each State since 1924-25, the estimated quantity of
wool exported on skins being included.
Western Australia stands out as the State which has made the
greatest relative progress in wool production during the period under
review, but it still provides only about one-twelfth of the aggregate’
production of the Commonwealth. The share of New South Wales
has shown little variation, while Queensland and South Australia
have not increased their production at the same rate as all the States
taken as a whole.
The bulk of the Commonwealth’s production of skin wool is pro-
vided by New South Wales and Victoria, where by far the greater
part of the slaughtering of sheep and lambs for food purposes takes
place. During the period 1924-25 to 1928-29, out of a total skin
wool production of 151 million lb., New South Wales accounted for
90 million lb. and Victoria for 48 million lb.

The Union of South Africa.
The rapid rise in production in the Union is one of the outstanding
features of the world’s raw wool output in recent years. Between
1925-26 and 1929-30 the Union’s estimated annual production
increased by 75 million lb., or 32 per cent. There was a very large
increase in the estimated production between 1924-25 and 1925-26,
but this may be more apparent than real in view of the basis of the
estimates. These are computed on the exports which were un-
usually low in 1924-25. There was a slight decrease in the estimated
production of 1930-31, and this may be similarly due to the fact
that the clip is calculated on the basis of exports. In this connection
it should be borne in mind that although local consumption is very
small, there is an appreciable variation in the amount of the carry-
over from season to season as is indicated in Table 42. The Union
is the only area in Africa which has shown any marked advance in
production during the period in question, and there is no reason to
suppose that the limit of the Union’s productive capacity has been
reached. The method by which the estimated production of wool
in the Union has been computed is indicated in Table 41.

(b) From " Crops and Markets,” August 1931.
(c) Based on exports by calendar years of " merino ” and “ coarse woolled ” sheep-

It should be pointed out that the estimates in Table 41 take
no account of variations in stocks of wool in the Union. Table 42
shows the amount of the stocks at Union ports on the 30th June in
each year from 1928 to 1931. Similar statistics are not available for
the whole of the period covered by the estimate of production in
Table 41, nor are there figures of stocks elsewhere than at the
ports. Allowing for the decrease in stocks at the end of June, 1930,
the increase in production in 1929-30 over 1928-29, as measured by
exports, was probably smaller than appears from Table 41.

New Zealand.
Sufficient data are available for New Zealand to enable a reasonably
accurate estimate of the annual wool production to be calculated.
Statistics of the seasonal exports and local consumption are published
in the Official Year Book. Since 1927, also, figures have been published
showing the total stocks of wool held on 30th June in the Dominion.
From these various particulars, together with the official figures
of the exports of woolled sheepskins, estimates of the total wool

production of the Dominion have been made for the years 1924-25 to
1930-31 and are reproduced in Table 43. The results have been
approved by the New Zealand Census and Statistics Office.
New Zealand, as has already been mentioned, does not suffer from
the periodical droughts which affect the Australian supply of wool,
and the estimated production since 1924-25 shows an almost con-
sistent advance. There was a set-back in 1925-26, and judging by
the estimate for 1930-31 the advance appears to have been
interrupted again.
(a) These estimates have been approved by the New Zealand Census and Statistics
Office.
(b) Not available.
(c) Calculated on the basis of 4 lbs. of “ greasy ” wool per woolled skin exported.
(d) Not computed.
(«) In the absence of figures of stocks for 1925 and 1926, wool production for 1924 -25
and 1925-26 has been estimated to bear the same relation to that of 1926-27 as the
shorn wool production figures for these two years bear to 1926-27. {See Table 44.)
As with Australia, shorn wool constitutes the great bulk of the wool
production ; the official statistics of the clip of shorn wool, reproduced
in Table 44 for the years 1915-16 to 1929-30, place the 1929-30 clip at
nearly 214 million lb., the highest figure yet recorded in the history
of the Dominion.

The United Kingdom.
Table 45 gives an estimate of the annual wool production of
the United Kingdom for the period 1924-31. It is based on annual
figures of the number of sheep over one year of age, account being
taken of the slaughterings during the year.
The estimated wool production of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland shows an increase from 106 million lb. in 1924 to 124 million
lb. in 1931. The bulk of this increase occurred in the first half of
the period under review, since when the production has been much
steadier. The production per head of the sheep population averages
about 5 lb. as compared with over 8 lb. in New Zealand. This
large difference is partly due to the fact that the United Kingdom
sheep numbers refer to June and include lambs, whereas the New
Zealand numbers refer to April by which time the lamb-killing
season for the frozen-meat trade is over.
Comparable figures for the period prior to 1924 are not available,
but the “Yorkshire Observer” estimates, which are frequently
quoted, are available over a long period. These estimates, which
include the Irish Free State and are not on a “ greasy ” basis, are

shown in Table 46 for each year since 1909. They are not com-
parable with the estimates given in Table 45, and are reproduced
here in order to indicate the trend of production since the pre-war
period.
(a) The figures include both shorn wool and skin wool. The estimates are based
on the number of sheep in each area in June of the previous year and the ascertained
average weight of fleece for each area, less the estimated loss of production due to
sheep slaughtered before the next shearing season. No allowance is made for changes,
if any, in the proportion of washed wool in the clip.
According to these estimates the wool production of the United
Kingdom, including the area now constituting the Irish Free State,
decreased almost consistently from 1910 to 1923, the decrease during
the period amounting to about 40 million lb. per annum, or 30 per


cent. Since then there has been a definite increase in production,
and the estimate for 1931, although it is still appreciably below the
pre-war level, indicates an increase of about 20 per cent, over the
1923 figure.
Part of this reduction in the clip, as compared with the pre-war
period, is due to a change in the distribution of the sheep. As was
stated in the section relating to the sheep population of the
United Kingdom in Chapter I, there has been an increase in the
sheep in most of the north, north-west and Welsh counties, coincident
with a net decrease in the rest of England, and since the mountain
sheep have a relatively light fleece it follows that this change in the
distribution of the sheep will tend to cause a diminution in the total
wool production. Moreover, it appears that both the composition
of the flocks and the size of the animals as compared with the pre-war
period are also tending in the direction of a reduced clip.
The Indian Empire.
No accurate estimate of the wool production of India is possible.
According to the latest statistics, there are over 40 million sheep,
but the inclusion of an estimate for certain of the Indian States for
which figures have not been published would probably raise the
aggregate sheep population to about 50 million. The problem is
rendered more difficult of solution by the existence of non-woolled
sheep and by the fact that some of the Indian States for which
sheep figures are not available are situated in woolled-sheep districts.
On the basis of an average yield of 2 lb. per head,* the total annual
production may be estimated at approximately 100 million lb.
Exports of raw wool from India, which amount to about 50 million
lb. per annum, exclusive of re-exports of wool previously imported,
cannot serve as an accurate basis of an estimate of production on
account of the large domestic consumption of wool in the carpet, etc,,
industries, but they have nevertheless been adopted in this chapter,
and in Appendix 11, as they are the only data available annually.
Export figures have similarly been taken for China and several other
Asiatic countries in the absence of production statistics or more
satisfactory estimates.
Judging from the official returns of the domestic exports, wool
production has made some recovery since the end of the war, and
until 1929 was little below the level of 1909-13. The relatively

low level of wool exports in the early years after the war, as in 1930-31
and 1931-32, was more probably due to lack of demand for carpet
wools in the world’s markets than to a decrease of production.

Canada.
Appreciable progress in the production of wool has been made
since 1924, although the high point attained just after the war has
not been reached again. The sheep population is increasing steadily
and there is no reason to doubt the continuance of the slow upward
trend in wool production.
Quebec and Ontario are together responsible for about one-half of
the Canadian clip but, while these two Provinces until 1930 showed a
slight annual increase in quantity, their share of the total has been
diminishing for some years. At the same time, that of the Western
Provinces, notably British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba, has

been increasing. The following table shows the official estimates of
the wool production of Canada for the years 1924 to 1931, based on
the estimated number of sheep in June each year, (a)
The Irish Free State.
Wool production in the Irish Free State has increased appreciably
in recent years, the estimated volume in 1929 being 15-5 million lb.,
as compared with 13*8 million lb. in 1924, which represents an
increase of over 12 per cent. There was a drop in 1930 to 14-7 million
lb., which was due to a reduction from 7-97 lb. to 7-25 lb. in the
average weight of fleece adopted as a basis for the official estimates.
These estimates for the period 1924 to 1931, which are given in
Table 49, cover both shorn wool and skin wool; no separate figures
for shorn wool are available. Washed wool, which constitutes a
considerable part of the clip, is included at its actual weight.
(a) For 1931, the estimate was based on the number of sheep enumerated at the
Agricultural Census taken in that year.

Other Empire Countries.
Wool production is the basic industry of Basutoland and, judging
from the exports of wool, it has tended slowly upwards over recent
years, reaching nearly 13 million lb. in 1929, which was the highest
figure recorded since 1915. Exports are a fairly reliable guide to
production in this case as there is little local consumption. Never-
theless, market conditions may affect the quantity exported in any
particular year and adverse conditions obtained in 1930, when
exports showed a heavy fall.
The industry is receiving the active attention of the Veterinary
Department, with a view to eradicating scab and improving the type
of sheep, and there appear to be favourable prospects for the expan-
sion'of the industry in the future. Figures of the annual exports of
wool from the territory are given in Appendix 11.
A steady supply of wool comes from the Falkland Islands. There
are no annual production statistics, but, as practically the entire clip
is exported, the trade figures give a good indication of the trend of
production. Exports in 1930 totalled 3-7 million lb. There are no
signs of expansion, the average annual exports during the period
1925 to 1930 being about 750,000 lb. less than in the pre-war quin-
quennium. Detailed figures of the annual exports are given in
Table 79. According to the agricultural census of 1930, the average
weight of fleece for the 523,000 sheep shorn was 7-2 lb. per head.
The remaining Empire countries are at present of small importance
from the point of view of wool production. The most important are
South-West Africa Territory, Kenya, Palestine and Cyprus.


For South-West Africa Territory and Kenya, export figures give
a sufficiently reliable indication of the volume and trend of produc-
tion. Exports of wool from South-West Africa Territory have
increased rapidly during the past ten years, in conformity with
the growth in the number of sheep and now approach 2 million
lb. per annum. Kenya is also making rapid strides in wool produc-
tion but the annual output is still small. Exports in the five years
from 1927 to 1931 averaged about 910,000 lb., as compared with an
average of 608,000 lb. in the preceding five-yearly period.
There are no annual statistics of the wool production of Palestine
but, on the basis of the number of sheep registered annually for
animal-tax, the volume of the production may be assessed at a little
over one million pounds per annum. Since 1924 the tendency has
been towards a reduction in the sheep flocks and no development in
wool production in the immediate future appears to be probable.
Wool production in Cyprus in 1930 is estimated by the Department
of Agriculture at 787,000 lb., as compared with 811,0001 b. in 1929,
606,000 lb. in 1928 and 628,200 lb. in 1927. Similar figures are not
available for earlier years but, on the basis of the annual exports
since 1924, comprising the great bulk of the clip, no expansion was
effected between 1924 and 1926.
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
South AMERICA.
Argentina.
Argentina is responsible for more than one-half of all the wool
produced in South America and holds third place in world order
for importance, being exceeded only by the Commonwealth of
Australia and the United States of America. In the absence of
official statistics, an estimate of the Argentine wool production for
the years 1924-25 to 1930-31 has been computed on the basis of
exports, local consumption and carry-over at the end of each season.
The figures are given in Table 50, which also indicates the method
of computation.
The net increase in the Argentine production between 1924-25
and 1930-31 was considerably less marked than that which took place
in Australia, South Africa and the United States of America over the

same period. In New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the other
great mutton-producing countries, the growth in wool production has
also been relatively slow.
Production in 1930-31 amounted to 329 million lb., which was
slightly above the average for the preceding six years. Provisional
trade estimates for 1931-32 indicate a clip of about the same volume
as in the previous year.

Uruguay.
There are no official wool-production statistics for Uruguay, and
the figures used in this Survey* are those published by the United
States Department of Agriculture. From 1924 the tendency in
Uruguayan production has been upward and the estimate for 1930
of 154 million lb. represents an increase of nearly 60 per cent, on the
1924 estimate. The 1931 clip is expected to show a considerable

reduction on the high levels of 1929 and 1930, on account of heavy
mortality among the flocks during the winter of 1931 (June to August).
These losses will no doubt also result in a low level of production in
1932.
Brazil.
Brazil holds third place among South American countries as a wool
producer, but her production is only about one-fifth of that of
Uruguay.
There are no official statistics of the wool production of the whole
of Brazil, but in the chief wool-growing State of Rio Grande do Sul
the estimated production of wool has increased from about 22 million
lb. in 1925 to over 26 million lb. in 1930, and on the basis of pro-
duction in this State the present production in Brazil may be estimated
at over 30 million lb. The following table shows the development
since 1925.
(a) Official estimate ; figures for previous years not traced.
( b ) Based on production in Rio Grande do Sul which is estimated to produce 83 per

Chile.
The wool production of Chile, the greater part of which is produced
in the Magellanes Territory, increased steadily between 1911 and
1919, when it reached a peak of 37*3 million lb. Since then the
trend has been less regular and after 1928, a decrease in production
was recorded.

Other Foreign Countries in South America.
The remaining countries include Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay
and Venezuela. Of these, Peru is the most important, and produces
about 15 million lb. of sheep’s wool per annum. This is a very
low yield per head of the sheep population, but, as mentioned
previously, steps have been taken to improve the type of sheep, and
there is a possibility of a greatly increased wool production in the
future. Bolivia also has a small yield per head of the sheep popula-
tion ; according to the United States Department of Agriculture,
production amounted to about 4 million lb. in 1929, almost
the entire clip being consumed locally. Ecuador, Paraguay and
Venezuela are of small importance, their combined production
being estimated at under 2 million lb. per annum.
North and Central America.
The United States of America.
Since 1927, when production exceeded that of Argentina, the
United States has been the second largest wool producer in the world,
being exceeded only by the Commonwealth of Australia. There
is no annual census of wool production in the United States, but
estimates are published by the Department of Agriculture. For
shorn wool, they are based chiefly on the estimated number of sheep
in each State on Ist January each year. An estimate is also made
by that Department of the total amount of wool obtained each year

from sheep slaughtered. Skin wool constitutes about 15 per cent, of
the total American production, which is a relatively high proportion.
The average production per head of the sheep population is about
8| lbs., or approximately the same as in New Zealand. The annual
figures since 1910 are given in Table 53.

(b) The figures for 1920 to 1931 are revised estimates published by the United
States Department of Agriculture in " Market News Service,” February 29th, 1932.


The great bulk of the wool produced in the United States comes
from sheep raised under range conditions in the Western States; in
the Eastern States wool is secondary to lamb production in import-
ance and only Ohio produces large quantities of wool.
Wool production steadily decreased from 1910 until 1922, the war
having given little or no impetus to greater production. Since 1922
there has been a marked rise, and in the nine years which have elapsed
an increase of about 60 per cent, has been registered, and the previous
peak of 1893, when production (exclusive of skin wool) reached 348-5
million lb., has been far exceeded. The increased production in 1931
as compared with 1910 is partly due to a rise in the per capita
production of the sheep population which increased during this
period from 7 to 8J lb. The estimated sheep population at the
beginning of 1932 suggests a still heavier level of production this
year.
Central America.
Mexico is the only wool-producing country of any importance in
Central America. Exports of wool from Mexico are negligible, and
on the basis of the quantity of domestic wool consumed by the local
mills the United States Department of Agriculture estimates the
Mexican wool production to have averaged nearly 6 million lb. per
annum for the period 1924-28. The annual figures are given in the
table of world production in Appendix 11.
Europe,
The raw wool production of Europe (including the Soviet Republics
in Asia) amounted in 1930 to about 800 million lb., or somewhat
less than that of the Commonwealth of Australia. In the following
paragraphs a description is given of the movement in the more
important European countries, other than the United Kingdom and
the Irish Free State, which have already been dealt with. Detailed
figures are given in Appendix 11, which also indicates the source of
the estimates in the case of those countries for which official figures
are not available.
The Soviet Union {Russia).
The Soviet Union is the fourth largest wool-producing area in the
world, the clip exceeding 300 million lb. per annum. Between
1924-25 and 1928-29 it increased to nearly 400 million lb. on

account of the growth in the number of sheep. The set-back in
1929-30 was caused by the large number of sheep slaughtered by the
peasants during the winter of that year as a protest against the
intensification of the Soviet collectivisation plan. Table 54 shows
the estimated wool production since 1923-24.

There is much scope for a further increase in production. The
sheep are spread over a large area and represent less than 12
per square mile and less than one per inhabitant. The average
clip of the Russian sheep is only about 3 lb. of wool, or less than
half that of the Australian and New Zealand sheep. Improvement
may result in some measure from the socialisation of the farms which
is in progress under the Ist and 2nd Five-Year Plans, which date
from 1928-29, but the process is bound to be a long one. The latest
available information is that only about 10 per cent, of the sheep
are as yet on socialised farms (State and Collectivised) and few are
fine-woolled.
The major part of the clip is not marketed but is consumed by
the farmers themselves. The consumption of wool by the peasants
and handicraft workers increased considerably, due, in part, to the
continued shortage of woollen cloth. In 1929-30, after a marked
increase, only 33 per cent, of the clip was marketed, as compared
with about 62 per cent, before the war.* Table 55 shows the annual
quantities marketed and retained by the producers since 1923-24.
The domestic clip is insufficient for the requirements of the textile
industry, and 72 million lb. of raw wool were imported in 1930 and
68 million lb, in 1931.

ment of Agriculture, April 23rd, 1927.


Spain.
Spain is the third largest wool-producing country in Europe
following the Soviet Union (Russia) and the United Kingdom.
Official estimates of production are not published, and an estimate
has, therefore, been computed on the basis of the sheep population
and the average shorn wool production in 1929. At the census taken
on 30th May, 1929, the number of sheep enumerated was 19-4
millions, and the average weight of fleece on the sheep shorn was
4*3 lb. On this basis, the total yield of all the sheep in 1929 would
have amounted to 83 million lb. It may be reasonably assumed that
the average weight of fleece has not altered appreciably in recent
years and, applying the same average yield per head to the sheep
population of earlier years, it is found that the production is con-
siderably above the pre-war level, but has shown little movement
during the past decade. Table 56 shows the estimated production
for the years 1909 to 1913 and 1921 to 1929. There is a fair proportion
of coloured wool in the Spanish clip ; according to the 1929 census
report, 83 per cent, of the clip was white and of this 23 per cent, was
described as “ coarse.”

Roumania.
Roumania has shown a slight downward trend in production since
1926, the estimated production in 1929 being 54-7 million lb., as
against 60 million lb. in 1928. The sheep numbers in 1930 indicate
the probability of a further slight decline in production in that year.
Roumanian sheep are raised for milk rather than wool. The clip,
which is mostly a coarse wool, is utilised for the most part in home
industries, only about one-fifth reaching the factories.
France.
According to official statistics, the wool production of France
increased steadily from 39-7 million lb. in 1920 to 47*6 million lb.
in 1927. There was a slight drop in 1928, which continued in 1929
and 1930. The production figures give an average yield per head
of the sheep population of 4\ lb.
Germany.
According to official estimates based on sheep numbers and supplied
by the Economic and Financial Section of the League of Nations, the
wool production of Germany declined from 53 million lb. in 1924
to 32 million lb. in 1930. Judging by the number of sheep in 1931,
production in that year was on about the same level as in 1930.
The German estimates show a very high clip per head of the sheep
population and this may be due partly to the method of their
computation and partly to the large amount of grease in the wool.
Italy.
The production of wool in Italy in 1929 is estimated at 30*9 million
lb., as compared with 35-3 million lb. in 1924. The average yield
of wool is rather low, and this may be attributed to the attention
paid in some parts to milk production and also to the large number
of coarse-woofled sheep in the Italian flocks.
Bulgaria.
The estimated wool production of Bulgaria is about 21-5 million
lb. per annum, and the output has remained at approximately this
level for several years. At present the average yield per head is
less than 31b.
Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia produces between 28 and 29 million lb. of wool per
annum, according to figures published in the League of Nations
Statistical Yearbook. A slight upward trend in production is
noticeable.

Greece.
The wool production of Greece is estimated by the Ministry of
National Economy of Greece on the basis of the 1929 census at an
annual average of 13-0 million lb. for the period 1924 to 1929, and
little movement from year to year is reflected in the figures. The
wool is of the carpet type, and practically the whole clip is consumed
in the country for the manufacture of carpets and for other purposes.
Hungary.
On the basis of the sheep numbers, the wool production of Hungary
in 1931 may be assessed at 12 million lb., which is rather below the
level of the years 1923 to 1927, and much smaller than the pre-war
level, judging by the estimated sheep population within the present
frontiers in 1911. Hungarian sheep farmers aim at wool rather than
mutton production, and the greater part of the clip is exported.
(а) Based on information furnished by the Budapest Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
(б) Estimate published by the International Institute of Agriculture.
The Baltic States and Finland.
The wool production of these countries in 1930 is estimated as
follows (in millions of lb.): —Lithuania, 3-2; Finland, 2-9;
Latvia, 3*3; Estonia, 1-4. In each case, production has been
declining during the last four or five years.


Poland.
On the basis of sheep numbers and the estimated weight of fleece
in various areas, the United States Department of Agriculture has
computed the wool production of Poland at 9*9 million lb. for 1930.
This continues an upward movement which that Department esti-
mates to have been in progress since 1927, and which may be expected
to have continued in 1931, as, according to preliminary figures, there
was a slightly larger sheep population in that year than in 1930.
The Scandinavian Countries.
Norway is the principal wool-producing country of the Scandinavian
group, producing 5-3 million lb. in 1929 as against 1-3 million lb. in
Sweden and 1 million lb. in Denmark. In Sweden and Denmark
production has been declining for some years.
Portugal.
Estimates of Portugal’s wool production show wide variations.
The Department of Statistics places the production in 1929 at
5-1 million lb., but unofficial estimates run much higher. One
authority* suggests that the production is about 12 million lb.
per annum. This estimate does not seem excessive, in view of the
sheep population, which the Central Agricultural Association esti-
mates at between four and five million head.
Other Foreign Countries in Europe.
Each of the remaining European countries contributes to the wool
supply, their combined production being about 15 million lb. The
most important are Albania, with an estimated production of 3*2
million lb. in 1929, Czechoslovakia with about 3 to 4 million lb. per
annum, and Iceland with under 2 million lb. per annum. Little
expansion appears to be taking place in any of these minor countries,
and production in Czechoslovakia has been declining. About 20 per
cent, of the Czechoslovakian clip is merino wool.
Asia.
China and Dependencies.
The only published statistics giving any indication of the wool
production of China are the trade statistics of the Chinese Maritime

cultural Congress, 1929.

Customs, representing the wool passing through Chinese ports, and
the Russian recorded imports of wool from certain Chinese depen-
dencies, which represent a large part of the wool passing over the
land frontiers. The figures so computed, which are clearly incomplete,
show wide fluctuations from year to year, which cannot be attributed
to production factors. The internal condition of China has so
disorganised trade as to produce wide movements in the export
figures and a sharp fall or rise may be due to the carry-over
of part of a year’s clip into the following year. On the other hand,
it would also be reasonable to assume that revolution and civil war
have had their effect on both the sheep population and the wool
production of the country. Table 58 shows the annual exports
from Chinese ports and the Russian imports of wool over the Chinese
land frontiers since 1924.

The Chinese flocks are of a coarse-woolled type, and an estimate
of a total of 45 million head for the whole of China would suggest an
aggregate wool production of somewhere about 120-150 million lb.,

assuming the same average yield as in the Soviet Union (Russia),
namely 3 lb. per head. The margin between this estimate and the
export figures in Table 58 could be accounted for by exports to India
and other States not covered by that table, and by the local consump-
tion of wool, not only as woolled skins for clothing, etc., but also for
the manufacture of carpets and rugs.
Persia.
Wool production in Persia, according to official figures reproduced
by the United States Department of Commerce, averages about
50 million lb. per annum. About two-thirds of the production is
consumed locally, largely by the carpet industry. The remainder is
exported and goes chiefly to the Soviet Union and India.
Turkey.
Complete estimates of the wool production of Turkey are not
available, but the Turkish Chamber of Commerce has furnished
estimates covering the bulk of the area from 1928 onwards.* Esti-
mates for preceding years have been made on the basis of the average
yield per sheep indicated by these partial estimates and the figures
are shown in Table 59.
(a) According to the assessment for the tax on animals.
(b) Assuming same yield per head of sheep population as in 1928 and 1929, i.e.,

(c) Figures supplied by Turkish Chamber of Commerce. There are 63 vilayets
in Turkey; the importance of the missing vilayets in the estimates for 1928-30 is
not known.
* The Empire Marketing Board is indebted to the British Chamber of Commerce
of Turkey for obtaining this information.


The estimate for 1928, relating to about three-fourths of the
vilayets, is 32 million lb., and that for each of the two subsequent
years shows a substantial decrease as a result of the heavy mortality
of the flocks in the winters of 1928-29 and 1929-30.
Other Foreign Countries in Asia.
Considerable quantities of wool are produced in Iraq, Afghanistan
and Syria. Iraq is the most important of these countries and,
according to figures published by the United States Department of
Agriculture, the production in 1929 was 18-6 million lb., as compared
with an average of 15*7 million lb. for the period 1925-28.
There are no annual production figures for Afghanistan, but the
United States Department of Agriculture has published an estimate
of 15 million lb. per annum, which is slightly in excess of the average
exports of 12 million lb. The Afghan sheep furnish the principal
meat consumed in the country and their wool and skins constitute
both the principal items in the country’s export trade and the raw
material for the local sheep-skin coat and carpet industries.
Wool production in Syria is developing appreciably, judging by
the net exports of wool. The decrease in exports in 1930 and 1931
reflects the adverse marketing conditions ruling in those two years
rather than a decline in production.
Mention should also be made of Arabia, where there are said to be
between 3 and 4 million sheep, but no statistics of the wool produced
are available, nor are there complete export figures to serve as a
guide. Only negligible quantities of wool are exported through
Aden, but there is a large export trade at that port in sheep-skins,
which are partly Arabian and partly African. According to the
Indian trade statistics, about 400,000 lb. of raw wool are imported
annually from the various Arabian States.
The independent States of Bhutan and Nepal also produce a certain
amount of wool, but no production or export statistics are available.
According to the statistics of the land frontier trade of India pub-
lished in the “ Indian Trade Journal,” the aggregate imports of raw
wool into India from Tibet, Nepal, Sikkim aud Bhutan in the twelve
months ended 31st March, 1931, aggregated 2-6 million lb., this
volume representing a reduction of 60 per cent, compared with that
of 1927-28. The returns do not give separate figures for each of these
States, so that it is not possible to say whether the diminution is
general or confined to one or two States.

Algeria.
Since the war, wool production in Algeria has been progressing at
an appreciably higher level than during the period of hostilities, and
in recent years has exceeded that of the immediate pre-war period.
In 1930 a record figure of nearly 50 million lb. was attained. Algeria
is the most important foreign country in Africa from the point of
view of wool production, but the volume is only one-sixth of that
of the Union of South Africa, and the wool is of a coarser type.
The following table shows the annual wool production of Algeria
since 1912.
(a) Source :—Annuaire Statistique de I’Algerie.
( b ) Not available.
(c) Estimate published by United States Department of Agriculture.


Morocco {French Zone).
Official production statistics have not been traced for this colony,
but on the basis of the number of sheep declared for taxation purposes,
the annual production of wool since 1924 has been assessed at about
23 million lb. The actual output may be higher, and a figure of
8-10 million sheep producing 33-37 million lb. of wool has been
suggested. There is scope for increased production as the weight of
fleece is light and the flocks contain an appreciable proportion of
non-woolled sheep.*
Tunis.
Official figures of production in Tunis have not been traced. The
estimates published by the United States Department of Agriculture
indicate that in recent years production has been increasing after an
appreciable decline in the earlier post-war period and reached over
4 million lb. in 1930. This represents a very low yield per head of
the sheep population.
Other Foreign Countries in Africa.
Of the remaining foreign countries in Africa, only three need to be
mentioned here, namely, Egypt, French Sudan and Libya. The wool
production of all the others is negligible. In the absence of produc-
tion statistics for these three countries, reliance must be placed on
the trade returns. A fair amount of wool is exported from Egypt.
The peak year of the past decade was 1929, when exports aggregated
nearly 5 million lb. In the following year, only one-half of that
quantity was exported owing, possibly, to the low prices ruling in
world markets.
In French Sudan there has been some expansion in wool production
since the war, judging from the exports, which, however, are still
below 2 million lb. per annum. There are no annual figures of woolled
sheep or of the production of wool, but a recent report] - gives the
number of woolled sheep as 1,550,000. On the basis of a yield of 2 lb.
per head, the total production would be about 3 million lb. per
annum.
* See “ Les Laines et I’Elevage de Mouton au Maroe,” by H. Velu and A. Bigot,
published by Direction Generate de I’Agriculture de Maroe, 1928.
f See “ L’Union Ovine,” sth November, 1930 (Journal of “ L’Union Ovine
Coloniale,” Paris).


Libya, which comprises the Italian colonies of Tripolitania and
Gyrenaica, exports on an average about 1J million lb. of somewhat
inferior wool per annum, but the production is in excess of this figure
as a certain amount is consumed locally. The fleece weighs about
5 lb. on an average, and if all the sheep were shorn the annual clip
would be about 4 million lb.
CHAPTER 4. —THE TYPES OF WOOL.
There are three main types of wool—merino, crossbred and carpet.
The classification depends on the quality of the wool as determined
by the fineness of the fibre, which largely denotes the spinning
properties of the wool, although other important factors materially
affect these properties. The fineness of wool is often measured by
quality numbers and the Bradford standards are as follows ;
Merino .. . 60’s to 100’s.
Crossbred ~ .. .. 36’s to 58’s.
Carpet .. .. .. 22’s to 34’s.
Merino wool is the finest and also has the largest range of quality,
although the individual merino fleece is more uniform in quality than
that of the coarser-woolled sheep.*
Many other factors besides fineness operate in determining the
market value of wool, and in the trade it is customary to link the place
of origin with the quality number, e.g. “ Punta Arenas 58’s.” An
attempt was made to include some of these other factors in the control
scheme of the Wool Appraisement Committee during the war when
the Australian clip alone was classified into no less than 848 grades.
The published statistics of wool production rarely distinguish
the types of wool but an approximate estimate of the weight of each
type of wool produced is available for 1915 ;f with this as a basis

Quality ” by Dr. S. G. Barker, Director of Research, Wool Industries Research

the position of the Textile Trades after the War ” (Cd. 9070, 1918).

Although comparable figures have not been published for more
recent years, it is possible to give estimates for the more important
wool-producing countries, the calculation of which is indicated in
the following paragraphs.
BRITISH EMPIRE COUNTRIES.
Commonwealth of Australia.
The annual percentages of merino and crossbred wools to the total
sales of wool in Australia are published by the Commonwealth Bureau
of Census and Statistics. As the wool sold locally averages well over
90 per cent, of the wool produced, it may reasonably be assumed that
the same proportion holds good for the aggregate wool production.
Table 62 indicates the percentage of merino wool in local sales since
1924-25. These percentages may slightly overestimate the pro-
portion of merino wool produced because they do not take account
of wool exported on skins which it is presumed comes chiefly from
crossbred sheep. The export of woolled sheepskins has been increasing
in recent years.
The Union of South Africa.
In the Union of South Africa the whole of the wool production may
be said to be merino. The amount of other types is relatively small.
New Zealand.
The proportion of merino and crossbred wool in the wool clip of
New Zealand, according to Messrs. Dalgety & Co.’s Annual Wool
Review, has remained steady at 2 per cent, for merino and 98 per
cent, for crossbred for a number of years.


The United Kingdom.
The wools of the United Kingdom range from 32’s to 58’s quality
(Bradford count), but for the present purpose the United Kingdom
clip may be regarded as faffing entirely within the crossbred category.
The relatively small amount of carpet wool in the clip comes for the
most part from the Blackfaced sheep of the Scottish Highlands: it
is used for homespun tweeds as well as for carpets.*
The Indian Empire.
For the present purpose, the whole of the Indian clip may be
classified as carpet wool.
Canada.
In range and semi-range lands the sheep are largely a Rambouillet-
mutton cross, but the farm flocks, which constitute the bulk of the
sheep population, are of the crossbred type. It has been assumed,
in the absence of information, that approximately two-thirds of the
clip is crossbred and one-third merino.
The Irish Free State.
The production of mutton and lamb is the chief objective in the
Irish Free State and the clip may be classified as crossbred.
The Falkland Islands.
All Falkland Islands wool falls into the crossbred category. The
quality is somewhat coarser than Punta Arenas wool and ranges
from 46’s to 50’s. It is particularly suitable for high grade hosiery.
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
Argentina ,
For Argentina, which in 1930 produced about 60 per cent, of the
South American wool, unofficial estimates from a reliable source are
available giving the distribution of the wool clip by types since 1924-25
and showing that whereas the proportion of merino wool during this
period has shown a slight decrease, the proportions of fine and
medium crossbreds have substantially increased at the expense of the
coarser varieties. The figures are reproduced in Table 63.
* For a detailed classification of British wools, see “ Wool Year Book, 1932 ’’
(Published by the Textile Mercury, Ltd., Manchester).

Uruguay.
The wools of Uruguay range from coarse wool of 40’s quality to
merino wool of 70’s quality. Before the war, the major part of the
clip was merinof but crossbred wool now predominates, although
estimates of the exact proportion of crossbred wool in the clip show
wide disagreement. The production of carpet wool is very small and
may be ignored here. Dalgety’s Annual Wool Review for 1927-28
quotes an estimate of 15 per cent, merino and 85 per cent, crossbred;
according to the live-stock census of 1924, merinos and sheep of the
merino type constituted about 32 per cent, of the total. For the
purpose of estimating the world trend since 1924 it has been assumed
that merino wool has constituted about one fifth of the clip in
Uruguay during this period.
United States of America.
The United States is the only important country outside the
Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa producing
more merino than crossbred wool. According to reliable estimates*
the American merino wool production in recent years has constituted
a markedly increasing proportion of the whole as Table 64 shows.
No carpet wool is produced.

Soviet Union {Russia).
Fifty years ago there were 15 million merino sheep in Russia, but
the number was already declining before the war and by 1923 the
production of merino wool was almost insignificant. It has since
increased under the socialisation plans of the Soviet Authorities, but
still forms a very small part of the total production. Almost the
whole of the remainder is of the carpet type.
Other Foreign Countries.
Statistics are not available for the remaining foreign countries
showing wool production by types, but the general position in brief
is as follows. The areas in question are South America (other than
Argentina and Uruguay), Central America, Asia (other than India),
Northern and Central Africa, and Continental Europe (other than the
Soviet Union (Russia)). As regards South and Central America,
Chile and Bolivia produce some crossbred wool, but elsewhere
carpet wool constitutes almost the whole production. In Asia and
Northern and Central Africa, the production may all be classed as
carpet wool. Continental Europe (excluding the Soviet Union)
produces wool of all three broad types, and information as to their
distribution is extremely approximate. It is estimated that crossbred
wools constitute very approximately one-half of the production and
that low wools make up the bulk of the balance, merino forming only
a small part of the whole —perhaps 15-20 per cent.


TREND OF MERINO AND CROSSBRED PRODUCTION.
Figures of the world’s merino and crossbred production are more
complete than those of carpet wools and it is possible to arrive at a
fairly accurate idea of the trend of merino and crossbred wool pro-
duction in recent years in the principal areas producing these types
of wool. Table 65 shows the computations annually since 1924
for 12 producing countries.
It will be seen that the merino wools in the countries in question,
which are estimated to produce about 90 per cent, of the world’s
supplies of carding and combing wools, have constituted a fairly
consistently increasing proportion of their production, the share
having risen from 50 per cent, in 1924 to 55 per cent, in 1929*
There was a fall in the merino proportion in 1930, mainly as a result
of the decrease in the Australian production, but the recovery in 1931
has probably resulted in the resumption of the upward movement of
world merino production relative to crossbred production. The
growth of merino and crossbred production between 1924 and 1930
is illustrated in Diagram II, facing page 112.
The marked development in the wool production of the Southern
Hemisphere countries, where the bulk of the merino wool is produced,
is largely responsible for the growing share of this type in the total
production of carding and combing wools. During the period 1924
to 1930 the production of merino wool in the 12 countries specified
* The results obtained are only slightly different from those computed by Dr. H.
Stoker in the article referred to on page 108. The two sets of figures are as follows :—

in Table 65 increased by 30 per cent., while their crossbred pro-
duction increased by only 11 per cent. Moreover, not only has merino
production increased at a considerably higher rate than crossbred
production, but the crossbred wools themselves have improved in
fineness. In Argentina and New Zealand, the two largest producers
of crossbred wools, as well as in Uruguay and South Chile, there has
been a marked diminution in the relative production of coarse
crossbred in recent years.*
It is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the trend
of the world production of carpet wool. As pointed out in Chapter 3
the figures of wool production reproduced in Appendix II under-
estimate, in a number of cases, the volume of production, as they do
not take into account the local consumption of wool which, in the
Asiatic countries particularly, is known to be considerable. After
allowing for this factor, the present world production of carpet wool
may be roughly estimated to constitute about one-quarter of the total
wool production.
Merino wool probably now constitutes about 40 per cent, of the
world production and crossbred wool about 35 per cent. It is
estimated that the British Empire provides nearly two-thirds of the
world’s merino wool and about two-fifths of the world’s crossbred
wool. As regards carpet wool, the Empire supplies only about
one-tenth.
It is probable that the world’s wool clip in recent years has
materially improved in quality, as merino production appears
to have increased at a much faster rate than crossbred. The
most important countries contributing to this development are
the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa and the
United States of America where the production consists largely of
merino wool and where the heaviest increases have been realised, and
there can be little doubt that the future trends of merino and crossbred
wool production will depend to a large extent upon the way in which
production in these countries develops. These three countries together
produced in 1930 about 90 per cent, of the world supplies of merino
wool and if their share of the world’s raw wool production continues
* See Report of lecture given by Mr. S. B. Rollings to the Bradford Textile
Society on “ Some recent changes in wool production.” (Reported in “ Meat and
Wool,” 10th August, 1931.)




to increase as it has done in the past six years, it is highly probable
that the share of merino wool in the total production will also
increase.
In this connection it should be borne in mind that the heavy fall in
wool prices which has been proceeding since 1928 may, if it continues,
influence growers either to increase their stocks of mutton-sheep and
thus go over to crossbred wool production or to decrease their sheep
flocks. The former alternative is more likely to happen in the United
States and parts of Australia where there exist large areas suitable
for the production of crossbred wool, than in South Africa, where
the climatic and soil conditions are not generally favourable to the
mutton-sheep. So far, this development does not appear to be taking
place to any extent nor has there been any reduction in flocks. On
the contrary the latest figures indicate that marked increases have
occurred in the sheep population of all three countries, due in large
measure to favourable climatic conditions and to the natural desire
of farmers to produce an increased quantity of wool to compensate
them for the lower prices obtained.




PART III.
THE EXPORT TRADE IN RAW WOOL.
(10756)
H 2




CHAPTER 5.—EXPORT OF HOME-GROWN WOOL FROM
THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCING COUNTRIES.
Introduction.
More than one-half of the world’s wool clip is consumed in countries
other than those in which it is produced, and the world trade in raw
wool consists largely of a movement away from the sheep-raising
countries of the Southern Hemisphere to the wool manufacturing
centres of Western Europe.
In this chapter the volume and trend of the export trade in raw
wool since 1924 will be analysed and the principal sources of supply
and the chief importing countries indicated. It is necessary to point
out that the tables in this chapter show the countries to which the
wool exported has been sent according to the official returns of the
exporting countries. It should be borne in mind that the importing
countries shown are not necessarily the countries in which the whole
of the wool imported ultimately passes into consumption. The
discussion is confined to exports from those countries which are, on
balance, exporters of raw wool, together with the export trade in raw
wool of certain net-importing countries which also have a considerable
export trade in home-grown wool. The import trade will be dealt
with in a subsequent volume. The figures relate to the trade in
sheep’s wool only; the trade in the more important of the other
animal fibres employed in the wool textile industry is considered in
Part V of the present volume.
BRITISH EMPIRE COUNTRIES.
Commonwealth of Australia.
The Commonwealth is responsible for over one-third of all the raw
wool entering world trade. The great bulk of the Australian clip
is shipped overseas, but the amount absorbed by the local textile
industry, although still relatively small, is definitely increasing, and
amounted to 45-4 million lb. in 1929-30, as compared with an
average of 42-5 million lb. in the preceding five-yearly period.

(a) Calendar year basis adopted to conform with other countries (Source
Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics).
(i b ) The conversion factor employed is :—1 lb. "scoured and washed ” = 2|lb.
" greasy ” (see " Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia ”).
Table 66 shows the Australian raw wool exports and their
distribution by countries for the period 1924 to 1931. The volume
of exports has been somewhat erratic over the period under review ;


but there has been a marked upward trend, and the exports in 1930
showed an increase of 50 per cent, in comparison with 1924. The
exports in 1931 were about 40 million lb. below those of 1930 but
were nevertheless well above the level of the years 1924 to 1929.
More than 90 per cent, of the exports consist of wool in the grease
and, as a result, the estimates of the total exports on a greasy basis
do not show a materially different movement from the actual weight
of wool exported. The large proportion of greasy wool in the exports
is stated to be due to the fact that overseas buyers prefer greasy rather
than scoured wool to meet their special requirements.
The United Kingdom is the principal importer of Australian wool.
In the immediate pre-war quinquennium the United Kingdom took
on an average 38 per cent, of the Australian shipments, and in
the earlier post-war years she took a still larger share, but since
1924 there has been a marked decline to about 33 per cent, in 1931.
This decline is very largely due to the increasing attraction of the
wool sales held in Australia, in contrast to the former practice of
shipping wool for sale at auctions in the United Kingdom. Thus,
in the years 1909-13, about 56 per cent, of the wool imported into
the United Kingdom from Australia was re-exported, chiefly to
Germany, Belgium, France and the United States of America. The
proportion re-exported has declined continuously from 50 per cent,
in 1925 to 31 per cent, in 1930; over the six years 1925-30 nearly
40 per cent, of the imports of Australian wool have been re-exported.
Germany, Belgium and France still take the bulk of the re-exports.
It should be pointed out that these percentages are calculated on the
actual weight of raw wool imported and re-exported, no allowance
being made for any changes in the relative proportions of greasy and
other wool. Table 67 shows the annual imports of wool into the
United Kingdom from Australia in 1909-13 and since 1920 and the
quantities re-exported.
Since 1924, France has taken on an average about 22 per cent, of
the Commonwealth’s exports. Germany, Belgium and Japan are
increasing their share, for the reason indicated above, the increase
in the case of Japan being particularly noteworthy. In the pre-war
quinquennium, Japan took about 1 per cent, of the exports from
Australia whereas in 1931 her share increased to about 23 per cent.
The United States of America, on the other hand, is taking an
appreciably decreasing share of the Australian shipments, on account
of the steadily increasing production of wool in that country under a

There is some possibility of China constituting an important
outlet for Australian wool when internal conditions become more
settled. In this connection it is of interest to note that the
Commonwealth Markets and Transport Department considers as
important the recent decision of the Chinese Government regarding
the establishment of woollen mills and factories for the manufacture
of blankets, clothing and other woollen goods, which at present are
imported.
(a) Source : “ Australian Statistics of Oversea Imports and Exports ” : not available
by calendar years.
(i b ) From “ Summary of Australian Production Statistics.”
(c) Estimated on basis of average for previous years.
The figures of exports in Tables 66 to 68 do not include wool
on the skin. Practically the whole of the sheepskins exported
from the Commonwealth are woolled and a substantial amount
of wool is so exported, the estimated greasy weight of such
wool in 1930-31 being 57 million lb. The number of woolled
sheepskins exported has doubled since 1924-25 as a result of
heavier slaughterings. France is the chief market, followed by


the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Some of
the wool pulled in France from imported skins is not consumed in
that country —but the French official trade returns do not distinguish
between skin and fleece wool or between wool grown in France and
re-exports of imported wool.
Table 69 shows the number and weight of woolled sheepskins
exported from Australia by financial years since 1924-25, together
with the officially estimated weight of greasy wool represented.
The Union of South Africa.
Progress in the export trade of the Union in raw wool has been so
rapid that this Dominion now competes with Argentina for second
place among the wool-exporting countries of the world, whereas in
1924 it held fourth place. In the export of merino wool, the Union is
second only to the Commonwealth of Australia.
Nearly all the South African clip is sent overseas and the great
bulk is exported in the greasy condition. The weight of wool exported
by calendar years from 1924 to 1931 is shown in Table 70, which
also gives the condition in which the wool was exported and an
estimate of the aggregate annual exports on a “ greasy ” basis.
The figures in Table 70 include wool produced in the adjoining
territories of Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Swaziland and South-West
Africa, but the amounts involved are not large. Basutoland alone
of these territories produces wool to any appreciable extent, its
annual production in recent years being estimated at about 10 to
13 million lb.
Exports of raw wool from Union ports increased fairly consistently
from about 175 million lb. in 1924 to about 275 million lb. in 1930,
or by 60 per cent. Calculated on a greasy ” basis, the increase is
slightly lower, since the exports of “ greasy ” wool constituted a
somewhat larger proportion of the aggregate exports in 1930 than
in 1924. The average exports in the pre-war quinquennium were
149 million lb. (" greasy ” basis), so that the 1930 figure represents
an increase of over 90 per cent, above the pre-war level. There was
a fall of nearly 40 million lb. in the exports in 1931, the volume
exported in that year being the smallest since 1926.
The United Kingdom up to 1930 was the chief market for South
African wool, but it has been taking a decreasing proportion of the
total shipments, whereas the shares of France and Germany have been

total as against 51 per cent, in 1924, while France took 31 per cent.,
as against 12 per cent., and Germany 21 per cent., as against 16 per

accompanied by an appreciable diminution in the proportion of South
African wool re-exported from the United Kingdom. In 1930,

re-exports of South African wool from the United Kingdom represented
68 per cent, of the total imports, as against 78 per cent, in 1925. The
decrease in recent years in the share of the United Kingdom in the
exports of raw wool from the Union of South Africa may be entirely
attributed to the increase in the direct exports to continental con-
suming centres. The retention of Union wool in the United Kingdom
has shown a substantial increase since 1924, the amount having risen
from 35 million lb. in that year to 51 million lb. in 1930.
The proportion of the South African exports going to Belgium has
remained fairly steady during this period at around 9 per cent., while
shipments to Italy have grown rapidly, although they still form less
than 5 per cent, of the total. Before the war, exports to the United
States of America were negligible. During the period 1924-31 annual
exports to that country averaged about 6 million lb., but have
recently shown a tendency to contract, probably on account of the
increasing production of wool of merino type in the United States of
America. Between 1920 and 1922, considerable quantities of wool
were exported to Japan, but that country does not now figure among
the more important purchasers in South Africa, and is concentrating
on the Australian market. Table 71 shows the share of the principal
importing countries in the Union’s wool exports since 1924.
In addition to the trade in raw wool, the Union has an important
and growing trade in sheepskins. These are classified in the official
trade returns as “ merino,” “ coarse woolled ” and “ Cape,” the
first-named constituting the major part of the whole. Omitting the

“ Cape ” skins, which are haired rather than woolled, and assuming
the other two classes not to have been de-woolled prior to export, the
average weight of woolled skins exported in the period 1927 to 1930
amounted to 31 million lb., as compared with an average of 20 million
lb. in the three preceding years. On the basis of an estimate furnished
by the Bradford Chamber of Commerce, these sheepskins would
represent respectively about 16 million lb. and 11 million lb. of
“ greasy ” wool. There was a slight fall in the exports in 1931 to
27 million lb., representing about 14 million lb. of wool. As will be
seen from Table 72, France is the chief purchaser, followed by the
United Kingdom and the United States of America.
(a) Calculated on the assumption that 40 per cent, of the weight represents sliped
wool; an addition of one-third has been made to obtain the “ greasy ” equivalent.
This estimate has been approved by the Statistical Section of the Department of
Agriculture, Pretoria.


New Zealand.
As in the case of Australia and South Africa, the great bulk of the
raw wool produced in New Zealand is exported, the small balance
being utilised by local mills, whose consumption has decreased since
1924. Table 73 shows the quantities of wool exported annually since
1924, together with the estimated equivalent in terms of greasy wool.
The official trade returns classify the raw wool exports into Greasy,
Scoured, Sliped and Washed, but as the washed wool represents only
about 0-1 per cent, of the whole, it is included with the scoured wool
in this table.
The New Zealand exports between 1924 and 1929 showed a fairly
consistent growth, the increase being about 10 per cent. (“ greasy ”
basis). An appreciable fall occurred in 1930, when the volume was
lower than in any year since 1924, owing to the accumulation of
stocks in New Zealand consequent upon the unfavourable market
conditions. There was a partial recovery in 1931 but exports remained
on a relatively low level.
The United Kingdom takes the greater part of the New Zealand
shipments, the proportion being much higher than in the case of
either Australia or South Africa, but the United Kingdom share has
fallen off in recent years and now shows a marked decrease as com-
pared with the pre-war quinquennium—the figures being 72 per cent,
in the period 1928-30, as against 94 per cent, in 1909-13. In
1930 the United Kingdom re-exported about 31 per cent, of the
raw wool imported from New Zealand ; the proportion of re-exports
to total imports has increased considerably since the immediate
pre-war period, when it amounted to 22| per cent. Thus not
only is the United Kingdom taking a smaller share of the New
Zealand exports, but she is also retaining a -smaller proportion
of her reduced share for her own consumption.* France is now the
largest continental importer of wool from New Zealand, a position
held by Germany prior to 1926. Shipments to Japan have also
increased since 1924, while shipments to the United States and
Italy have been falling off.
* A detailed examination of the changes in the channels of trade of New Zealand
wool in recent years will be found in " Some Factors affecting the Markets for New
Zealand Wool ”by D. O. Williams, December, 1929. (Bulletin No. lof Massey Agri-
cultural College, University of New Zealand.)

New Zealand also exports a relatively small amount of wool on the
skin, the greater part of the sheepskins being de-woolled prior to
export. Exports of woolled skins in 1931 numbered 1-7 million skins,
equivalent to about 7 million lb. of greasy wool. The United Kingdom
is the largest importer, but part of her purchases are re-exported to
France. The only other important importing countries are the
United States of America and France ; in both cases imports have
been increasing rapidly. Details of the exports of woolled sheepskins
from New Zealand are given in Table 74.
(a) Calculated at the rate of 4 lb. per skin. This basis has been approved by the

The Indian Empire.
During the period 1924-31, exports of raw wool from India
averaged 58 million lb. per annum, representing about one-third of
the aggregate exports of wool from all Asiatic countries during that
period. But the Indian exports include considerable quantities of
wool previously imported from neighbouring States, particularly
Afghanistan, Persia, Central Asia and Tibet, this re-export trade
representing about 20 per cent, of total exports in the period in
question. During the years 1924 to 1931, exports of domestic wool

averaged 47 million lb. per annum, and re-exports of foreign wool
averaged 11 million lb. per annum. In 1930 a sharp fall occurred
in the exports of both home-produced and foreign wools, largely
attributable, no doubt, to the low prices ruling in overseas markets.
A slight recovery was effected in 1931, but the total exports in that
year were still about 20 million lb. below the average for the period
1927-29. The annual figures since 1924 are given in Table 75.
(i a ) Actual weight of wool exported but it is almost all in the “ greasy ” condition.
The calendar year basis has been adopted to conform with the other tables in
this chapter.
Assuming the production of wool in India to be about 100 million
lb. per annum, it would appear that India normally exports about
one-half of the domestic clip, leaving at a minimum a balance of
40 million lb. for home consumption. India also retains well over
one-half of the carpet wools imported from other Asiatic countries,
which average about 27-0 million lb. per annum, as well as the
relatively small quantity of improved wools imported annually from
the United Kingdom and Australia.


The greater part of the raw wool exported from India is taken by
the United Kingdom and the only other important market is the
United States of America. Exports to America showed a rapid
increase until 1929, but since then they have fallen substantially.
The remainder of the Indian exports, constituting from 2 to 4 per
cent, of the total, goes almost entirely to Continental Europe.
The United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom holds a unique position in the raw wool
trade in that she is the world's largest importer of raw wool in
addition to being an appreciable raw wool producer, and is the
second largest exporter of raw wool, being exceeded in this respect
only by Australia. The great bulk of these exports are of imported
wool, but the volume of domestic wool exported is appreciable, and
since 1926 it has represented on an average rather more than one-
third of the clip. The present section is confined to an account of
domestic exports ; the external trade of the United Kingdom in im-
ported raw wool will be dealt with in a subsequent Volume. The
demand for the home-grown wool of the United Kingdom arises from
the fact that it has characteristics which cause it to be preferred
for certain purposes by manufacturers both at home and overseas.
The volume and trend of this trade since 1924 is given in Table 76.
There is no indication in the official returns as to the type of wool
exported. The larger part is undoubtedly crossbred while the bulk
of the exports to the United States of America consists of carpet
wool.
During the period from 1924 to 1929, the United States of America
took about one-half of the home-grown wool exported in the greasy
condition. Details of the exports of the other descriptions are not
available prior to 1926. During the period 1926 to 1929, the United
States took about one-third of the scoured and washed wool and
about three-quarters of all the other wool. There has been a sharp fall
in American purchases of United Kingdom wool since 1930 but, even
before that year, a marked downward trend was noticeable in con-
sonance with American wool imports generally. The greater part of
the balance of the home-grown wool exported from the United King-
dom is consigned to Western Europe and Italy. The falling-off
in the overseas demand for United Kingdom wool has been fairly
general, but a notable exception is Italy, where United Kingdom
wool is apparently being consumed in increasing quantities.

(«) Excluding waste, noils, woollen rags and wool exported on the skin.
[h] Not available ; the published figures of exports of scoured, washed and other
descriptions for these two years include imported wool scoured, etc., in the United
Kingdom and re-exported. On the basis of the annual average of such re-exports for
the years 1926 to 1928, when they amounted to 10-8 million lb., the actual weight
of aggregate exports of home-grown wool in 1924 and 1925 may be estimated at
41 • 5 and 43 ■ 0 million lb. respectively.
(c) Assuming 1 lb. "scoured and washed” = I|lb. "greasy” and 1 lb. "sliped,”
etc.= l|lb. “greasy.”


The decline in the United Kingdom exports of domestic wool since
1927 is not due to any reduction in the clip, which has in fact shown
a slightly upward tendency since that year, nor to smaller supplies
of imported wool available for consumption. Indeed, it is doubtful
if there is any direct relation between these three factors, the volume
of home-grown wool exported being largely, if not entirely, dependent
upon the relative demand for this particular wool at home and in the
United States of America and the manufacturing centres on the
Continent, and is connected with the increasing preference for fine-
woolled goods together with the withholding of supplies on account
of the low prices offered.
In addition to the domestic raw wool exports shown in the preceding
table, a small amount of wool is exported on the skin. During the
period 1924 to 1931, the annual average weight of domestic woolled
skins exported amounted to about 2 million lb., representing about
1 million lb. of greasy wool. In recent years, Belgium has taken
about one-half of these exports and the United States the bulk of
the balance.
The Irish Free State.
Most of the wool produced in the Irish Free State is shipped over-
seas, although in 1930 a large part of the clip was not exported, on
account of the unfavourable marketing conditions. The domestic
clip supplies the greater part of the requirements of the local
wool textile industry and part is also used for the making of
homespuns. The movement of exports since 1924 has been some-
what erratic, as will be seen from Table 77, which also shows the
distribution of the exports, together with the estimated equivalent
in terms of greasy wool.
The bulk of the raw wool exported is sent to Great Britain,
where most of it is retained for consumption. The United States of
America is the only other important market, that country taking on
an average somewhat less than 2 million lb. per annum. The Irish
Free State has a considerable export trade in sheepskins and in
1931 the exports of woolled sheepskins exceeded 4 million lb.,
representing about 2 million lb. of wool. Most of these are sent to
Great Britain.

Canada.
The Dominion’s exports of home-grown wool have developed
rapidly since the war, and in recent years have amounted, on an
average, to about 7 million lb. per annum, or about 40 per cent, of
the Canadian production, as against about 1 million lb. before the
war. Prior to 1931, the bulk was taken by the United States,
almost the whole of the balance being shipped to the United Kingdom.
In 1931, the United Kingdom took the major part of the Canadian
exports. Details of the condition in which the wool was exported
are not available prior to April, 1928; since then about 90 per cent,
of the whole has been exported in the grease. Table 78 shows the
Canadian exports of domestic wool annually since 1924. It will be
seen that they have shown a marked tendency to decrease since 1927.

The Falkland Islands.
Practically all the raw wool produced in the Falkland Islands is
exported, and wool and other sheep products constitute almost the
entire export trade of the Colony apart from whale oil. During the
past decade, wool exports have shown some tendency to decrease,
this being attributable to the slight reduction which has occurred
in the flocks.
All the wool exported is shipped in the greasy condition, and the
United Kingdom is virtually the sole importer, but about one-half
is re-exported. Table 79 shows the annual exports from the
Falkland Islands since 1924.


Other Empire Countries.
Exports from Basutoland have been referred to in the paragraph
relating to the Union of South Africa. There are no other Empire
countries which export raw wool to any appreciable extent, although
one or two deserve to be mentioned specifically because of
potentialities in this respect.
Exports of wool from Kenya have made rapid strides in recent
years and now amount to about 1 million lb. per annum.* The
United Kingdom is virtually the sole importer, but the wool is largely
re-exported to France. Exports from Palestine show much variation
but average about half a million lb. per annum : the wool is of
the carpet type and goes mainly to France. Exports of wool from
Cyprus, also of the carpet type, averaged rather more than half a
million lb. per annum until 1929, this representing the greater part
of the clip, but here, as in Palestine, no development appears to be
taking place, and there was a heavy fall to 220,000 lb. in 1930.
Exports from Southern Rhodesia are very small, but those from
South-West Africa Territory have increased rapidly during the last
few years, and in 1930 amounted to 1-3 million lb. These exports,
like those from Southern Rhodesia, for the most part pass through
Union ports and have to that extent already been included in the
Union figures in Table 70.
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
Argentina. The Continent of America.
Argentina is surpassed only by Australia as an exporter of home-
grown raw wool, and the average annual exports since 1924 have
amounted to about 300 million lb. Nearly the whole of the Argentine
production is sent overseas, and although local consumption appears
to have increased during recent years, the amount so retained still
represents only about 8 per cent, of the total production. Exports
reached their maximum in 1899 with 537 million lb. ; the average
of the years 1905 to 1909 showed a decrease to 390 millions and that
of 1910 to 1914 a further fall to 320 millions. This latter level has
only been exceeded once since 1924, namely in 1927. In 1928
the exports fell heavily but have since shown a marked rising
trend and exceeded 310 million lb. in 1931.
The greater part of the Argentine exports is sent to the United
Kingdom and the Continent, the only other important market being
the United States of America. During the war and the immediate

(a) A small part of the Brazilian clip, amounting on an average to less than 1
million lb. per annum since 1924, is exported to Argentina, and it is, therefore,
possible that the recorded exports from Argentina include some Brazilian wool. The
amount of foreign wool exported is not shown in the Argentine trade returns, but it
is relatively insignificant.
(b) The weight of scoured wool has been increased by 60 per cent, and that of sliped
wool by 30 per cent, to obtain the greasy equivalent. (See “ Economic Review of the
Bank of the Argentine Nation ”, October, 1930.)

post-war years, the United States took an appreciably larger share
of the Argentine exports, but American imports have since returned
to the pre-war level. The largest purchasers in order of importance
are Germany, France and the United Kingdom, but the United
Kingdom surpassed France in 1929 and Germany in 1930, becoming in
that year the chief importer of wool from Argentina. These three
countries together take more than one-half of the total exports.
The great bulk of the wool imported from the Argentine by the
United Kingdom is retained there and the proportion of the imports
retained has increased from 88 per cent, in 1926 to 97 per cent,
in 1930.
Details of the Argentine exports since 1924, classified into greasy,
scoured, and sliped, are shown in Table 80, and an estimate is
made of the aggregate exports converted to a “ greasy ” basis.
Argentina also has a large export trade in sheepskins. Exports
of woolled skins in 1931 aggregated 35 million lb., representing
about 19 million lb. of greasy wool. Particulars of the exports since
1924 are given in the following table, from which it will be seen that
France is by far the most important market, taking as a rule over
80 per cent, of the whole. The wool exported on the skin represents
an appreciable addition to the supply from Argentina.

(b) Estimated on the basis of sliped wool representing 40 per cent, of the weight of
the woolled skin ; 3 lb. of sliped wool has been taken as equivalent to 4 lb. greasy wool.

Uruguay.
Uruguay is the second largest wool-exporting country outside the
British Empire. Between 1924 and 1929 the trend of exports was
similar to that of Argentina ; the year 1927 was a peak-year and
was followed by a substantial decline. There was a recovery in
1930 and 1931 in both cases, but particularly in Uruguay whose
average exports in those two years exceeded the volume of 1929 by
(a) A part of the Brazilian clip, amounting on an average to less than 5 million
lb. per annum since 1924, is exported through Uruguay and it is, therefore, possible
that the recorded exports from Uruguay include some Brazilian wool. The amount
of foreign wool exported is not shown in the Uruguayan trade returns but it is clear
that it is relatively small.
(b) Not yet available.
(c) The conversion factors employed are: 1 lb. scoured = 2 lb. greasy; 1 lb.
washed =IJ lb. greasy. (See Survey of Textile Industries by Committee on Industry
and Trade, 1928, page 239.)


over 40 per cent, and the 1927 peak by 5 per cent. It is of interest
that Uruguay, on the basis of the provisional figures for 1930 and
1931, is the only important wool producing country to show such a
substantial increase in its exports in those years. The remarkable
increase in 1930 is attributable partly to the release of accumulated
stocks and partly to a growth in production. A decrease occurred
in 1931, but the level of exports in that year was still well above that
of 1928 and 1929. Table 82 gives details of the exports since 1924.
Almost the whole of the wool is exported " in the grease.”
Germany is the chief importer of wool from Uruguay, taking on
an average about 30 per cent, of the total exports, followed by
France with about 20 per cent. The United Kingdom’s share is
greater than before the war and judging from the recorded imports
into the United Kingdom, has increased appreciably during the last
few years. During the war, considerable quantities of Uruguayan
wool went to the United States of America, but the proportion of
the total exports shipped to that country dropped from about 40 per
cent, in 1920 to about 13 per cent, in 1929. The Soviet Union
entered the Uruguayan market in 1929 for a substantial amount;
exports to that country in previous years had been negligible.
Exports of woolled sheepskins from Uruguay average about 11
million lb. per annum, the great bulk being shipped to France.
Chile.
Chile, like Argentina and Uruguay, exports the great bulk of the
raw wool produced. The official statistics of exports for the period
1924 to 1931 are summarised in Table 83 ; except for 1930 and 1931
they do not indicate the condition in which the wool was exported
but in those years the overwhelming part was described as “greasy ”
and there is no doubt that this also applied to the earlier years.
Since 1924 exports from Chile have been much more uniform than
those from the neighbouring States, but there has been a marked
decline since 1927. The greater part of the wool exported from
Chile is shipped to the United Kingdom and the proportion thus
consigned, the bulk of which is subsequently re-exported, has
increased appreciably in recent years. Exports to the United States
of America and France, on the other hand, have fallen off rapidly.
Chile also has an important export trade in sheepskins, the exports
in 1930 amounting to 7*3 million lb., but no information is given
as to what proportion of these were woolled. The United States of

from Chile are described as “ woolled ”, and the American purchases
consist almost entirely of woolled skins.

The total imports of raw wool into Chile in 1930 were less than 1 million lb.
Brazil.
Brazil is the chief of the minor wool-exporting countries in South
America. About two-thirds of the wool clip is consumed within
the country, Brazil possessing a wool textile industry which is rapidly
increasing in importance. Nevertheless, exports of wool have
increased appreciably since 1924 in consequence of the higher level
of production to which reference has already been made. No
information is available as to the condition in which the wool is
exported. The following table gives the volume and distribution
of the exports since 1924. It will be seen that a large part is exported
through Argentina and Uruguay, most of the remainder being sent
to Germany. Exports to the United Kingdom are negligible.

Peru.
Exports of sheep’s wool from Peru, as Table 85 shows, are
relatively small, the average annual quantity since 1924 amounting
to about 4 million lb., or much the same as before the war. The
principal importer is the United Kingdom which takes about
two-thirds of the total exports ; the United States of America is the
only other appreciable importer but the volume taken by that country
is in most years very small. Besides sheep’s wool, Peru exports
appreciable quantities of alpaca, llama and vicuna wools and these
are dealt with in Part V of this Survey.

Other Foreign Countries in America.
The remaining wool-producing countries of the Continent of
America are of little importance in the export trade in raw wool.
Exports of home-grown wool from the United States of America and
Mexico are negligible and the combined exports of the other countries
in 1929 amounted to less than 1 million lb.
Asia.
China and Dependencies.
China is the most important exporter of sheep's wool in Asia,
but the figures that have been traced are incomplete as regards the

exports over the land frontiers. The latter are partially known
from the trade returns of the Soviet Union, which indicate the
imports from Outer Mongolia and Sin-kiang. The land-borne Sino-
Soviet trade in raw sheep’s wool is increasing considerably, while
that passing through the ports is showing no upward trend. Exports
over the land frontiers into India are relatively unimportant.
Exports through Chinese ports are subject to wide fluctuations,
but have been for the most part at a higher level than before the
war, when they amounted to about 37 million lb. per annum.
Table 86 shows the annual exports through the maritime ports
since 1924, together with the partial figures of exports over the
land frontiers.
Apart from the Soviet Union, the United States of America is the
only important consignee of Chinese wool which, it will be recalled,
is of the carpet type.
China also exports appreciable quantities of camel hair and goat
hair ; particulars of this trade will be found in Part V of this Survey.
Iraq.
Statistics of the quantity of wool exported from Iraq are only
available on a comparable basis from 1926 onwards. Exports
in 1931, which amounted to 11-1 million lb., were about 20 per cent,
below the average for the quinquennium 1926-30. Complete details
of the distribution of the exports are not available but the bulk is
taken by the United States of America. Iraqi wools are generally
river-washed and then exported in whole fleeces instead of being
graded as is customary in countries producing improved wools. Much
of the wool grown in Iraq is black, brown, fawn or parti-coloured.
It is all of the carpet type.
Persia.
The greater part of the Persian clip is retained in the country for
the carpet industry and exports of raw wool have not shown any
marked trend during the period under review, having averaged about
13 million lb. per annum. The Soviet Union (Russia) is by far the
principal importer and in 1930-31 her share rose to nearly 90 per
cent, of the total exports. The balance goes mainly to India and
Iraq. The following table gives particulars of Persia’s exports in
recent years.

[a) Including re-exports of wool imported from neighbouring countries. These
re-exports are not separately recorded but their amount is small.
Syria and Lebanon.
Exports of wool from these mandated territories averaged about
11 million lb. during the period 1924-29 but, in common with most
other Asiatic countries, there was a heavy fall in 1930. Little
improvement was recorded in 1931, the exports from Syria in that
year amounting to 6-4 million lb. as compared with 5-7 millions in
1930.
Syrian wool is suitable only for carpets and mattresses; the chief
importer is the United States of America, followed by Italy and
France. Little Syrian wool is exported to the United Kingdom.
Turkey.
The greater part of the Turkish clip of sheep’s wool is retained in
the country for the carpet-making industry, which is centred at
Smyrna. Exports of raw sheep’s wool, which had shown a definite
upward trend between 1924 and 1929, suffered a substantial decline
in 1930 but recovered almost the whole of the lost ground in 1931.
The Soviet Union (Russia) is now the principal market, taking
40 per cent, of the sheep’s wool exported in 1931. A large part of
the remainder goes to the neighbouring countries of Syria, Bulgaria
and Greece, but France also figures prominently in the list of importing
countries, as well as the United States of America. Table 88 shows
the annual exports from Turkey since 1924.

Wool is an important item in the export trade of Afghanistan, but
no complete statistics are published. It is exported to the Soviet
Union and to India and exports are estimated to have amounted in
the aggregate to about 12 million lb. per annum in recent years, of
which the Soviet Union has latterly taken about 75 per cent.*
No statistics of the quantities exported from other Asiatic wool-
producing countries are available but the trade is small.

Algeria. Afeica '
Algeria, which produces wool of the carpet type, holds first place
among the less important wool-exporting countries in Africa. Less
than one-half of the clip is exported. The annual exports, which
are shown in the following table for the period 1924-31, have appre-
ciably declined since 1926. France takes about 90 per cent, of the
whole and the remainder goes chiefly to Belgium and Italy. Algeria
also exports a considerable quantity of woolled sheepskins ; these
averaged 5-2 million lb. per annum in the period 1929-31, repre-
senting about 3 million lb. of greasy wool.
[a) Provisional figures.
Morocco (French Zone).
Wool is one of the most important commodities in the export
trade of this Colony. There was a sharp fall in exports in 1929
which continued into 1931, probably owing to the holding back of
supplies on account of the unfavourable market for the type of
wool produced. Table 90 shows the annual exports since 1924.
France is the principal importer, and that country is also the principal
market for the woolled sheepskins exported: these amount to about
2 million lb. per annum and are estimated to represent about
1 million lb. of greasy wool.

Other Foreign Countries in Africa.
The other foreign countries in Africa do not enter to an important
extent into the world trade in raw wool. The chief of them is Egypt,
which furnishes a steady supply of carpet wool, amounting to
3-6 million lb. in 1931, of which the United States of America
took 2*9 million lb. Tunis exports a small part of its raw wool
production, the annual exports in the quinquennium 1927-31,
averaging I*4 million lb. or about the same level as in the period
1909-13. But Tunis also imports raw wool, the annual amount in
recent years being about 1 million lb. and part of this may figure in the
exports. Italy is the chief purchaser of Tunis wool.
French West Africa does a small trade ; exports in the period
1928-30 averaged I*7 million lb. per annum, almost the whole
going to France.* Libya also exports small quantities of raw wool,
averaging 1-4 million lb. per annum in the period 1924-30. Italy
and France are the principal importers.
tt Europe.
Hungary.
Exports of raw wool from Hungary have declined considerably
since 1925, when a total of 14-7 million lb. was recorded, the fall
reflecting the decline in the wool production of the country. From

1924 to 1929 the annual exports represented over 80 per cent, of the
estimated clip, but a slight decline in the proportion of the clip
exported was recorded in 1930 and a heavier decline in 1931. The
annual exports since 1924 are given in the following table.
(а) Converted at 1 lb. scoured and washed = 2 lb. greasy.
(б) Included in “ Other countries.”
Germany and Czechoslovakia take between them about three-
quarters of all the raw wool exported from Hungary, and the
remainder is exported to a number of other European countries.
Although on balance an exporter of raw wool, Hungary is mainly
dependent on foreign raw material for her wool textile industry and
some of the raw wool exported re-enters the country as yarn.
Imports of raw wool into Hungary are small but increasing, and
amounted to 3*7 million lb. (greasy basis) in 1930.

Spain,
Spain holds a high place among European countries in the pro-
duction of raw wool, but not much more than 10 per cent, of the
estimated clip is exported. Exports show wide variations from
year to year, the average for the period 1924-30 being a little
under 9 million lb. Exports before the war were on a higher level;
in 1913 they amounted to 32 million lb. as against 17-5 millions in
1924, the highest post-war figure. Since then, exports have
decreased heavily and amounted to only 2-6 million lb. in 1931.
At the same time, imports of raw wool show an appreciable increase
in comparison with pre-war figures. In view of the absence of a
reduction in the wool clip, this diminution in exports and increase in
imports may be attributed to the development of the textile industry
in Spain during and since the war.
The greater part of the wool exported from Spain is unwashed,
but figures showing the condition in which the wool is exported during
the whole of the period under review are not available. Nearly all
of it goes to European countries, particularly France. The United
Kingdom takes only a negligible amount. The following table shows
the annual exports since 1924 and their distribution.
(a) Provisional figures.


Italy.
The Italian trade returns do not distinguish between exports of
home-grown wool and exports of wool previously imported, but it
has been ascertained from reliable sources* that the bulk of the raw
wool exported consists of home-grown wool, mainly of the carpet
type. During the period 1924-1931 the aggregate exports of raw
wool fluctuated considerably and averaged about 7 million lb. per
annum. The principal market for scoured wool, which constitutes the
greater part of the exports, is the United States of America, and
that country also takes a considerable part of the greasy wool
exported. The distribution of the exports of both descriptions for
the years 1924 to 1931 is shown in Table 93.
Portugal.
Portugal is of minor importance as a wool exporter, exports
averaging under 3 million lb. per annum. Belgium and France are
the principal importers. The wool exported is almost entirely coarse
wool, as the merino wool grown is utilised in the local textile industry.
No development in the export trade is discernible ; the annual
figures are given in Table 113.
Iceland.
Iceland exports about 1| to 2 million lb. of wool per annum, this
constituting the great bulk of the clip. The wool is rather coarse
and is used largely for making carpets, but the noil often has a high
value owing to its softness and lightness. The wool is shipped
mainly to Denmark and the United States of America, but the
Danish shipments are all subsequently re-exported and the United
States also takes a large share of these re-exports. Iceland also
exports annually some 400,000 woolled sheepskins, this trade having
more than quadrupled since the beginning of the century.
Albania.
Albania exports only small quantities of wool, the average for the
period 1927-30 being little over 1 million lb. per annum.
* Information on this point has been kindly furnished by the British Chamber of
Commerce for Italy (Incorporated) and the Associazione Fascista dell’lndustria
Laniera Italiana.

Other Foreign Countries in Europe.
The export trade of Belgium, Holland, Germany and France
consists mainly in the re-export of wools previously imported from
the Southern Hemisphere and elsewhere. The considerable wool
clips of Roumania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece and Poland are
largely consumed within those countries.


Exports of raw wool from the Soviet Union (Russia) are now
negligible although before the Great War Russia was a wool exporter
of some importance. During the quinquennium 1909-13, the
Russian Empire exported 23 million lb. per annum but in this
connection it should be borne in mind that the comparison between
the foreign trade figures of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union
is vitiated by the important change in frontiers that has taken place
since the war.

CHAPTER 6.—THE COURSE OF PRICES OF RAW WOOL.
Introduction.
The raw wool prices used in this Chapter are those realised at the
London wool auctions. For the purpose of simplifying the examina-
tion of the price movements, no account has been taken of wool prices
realised in other centres, but this omission does not materially affect
the main conclusions since the London price is the most important
determining factor in wool prices the world over. Messrs. Schwartze,
Buchanan and Co., have kindly furnished, for three typical qualities,
the prices realised at, or about, the end of the quarter for each year
from 1890 onwards. A complete statement of these prices for a
typical merino, crossbred and carpet wool, together with the index
of these prices and the index of the commodity value of raw wool,
are included as Appendices 111, IV and V to this report.
THE COURSE OF PRICES, 1890-1931.
The heavy fall in raw wool prices which commenced about the
spring of 1928 has brought wool values to the lowest level experienced
since the early 90’s of last century. The yearly averages of the prices
realised at the last auction in each quarter for each year since 1890
are indicated in Table 94 and the movement is illustrated in
Diagram 111.

It will be seen that in the quarter century preceding the war, wool
prices were not subjected to the •violent fluctuations which have
marked the post-war period. Apart from the years 1899 to 1904, on
the one hand, which included a period of low production consequent
on droughts in Australia, and a boom in prices at the end of 1899
and subsequent collapse in 1900 and the years 1906 to 1908, on
the other, which included a period of marked instability in the
general price level, wool prices in the pre-war period were relatively
steady with rarely a difference of more than 2 d. per lb. (clean scoured
basis) from one year to another. The price level, it will also be
observed, was definitely rising and the five-year average of quarterly
prices at the beginning and end of the pre-war period under review
was as follows :
During the war the prices of Australian and New Zealand wools
were controlled under the Imperial Wool Purchase Scheme initiated
in November, 1916, and public auctions were suspended. The whole
clip was taken over by the Imperial Government at 55 per cent,
above the average 1914 prices which worked out at about 10 per cent,
below the prices ruling in the open market at the time of the com-
mencement of the scheme.* In 1919 public auctions were resumed
in London, but the offerings were controlled by the Ministry of
Munitions and prices were regulated. A rise in prices occurred —
a violent rise in the case of merino wool and a relative moderate
rise in the case of crossbred and carpet wools. Between April, 1919
and March, 1920, merino prices rose from 83 pence per lb. to 150
pence per lb., clean scoured basis —an increase of 80 per cent., while
* See “ Experiments in State Control at the War Office and Ministry of Food ”
by E. M. H. Lloyd.


crossbred and carpet wool prices rose in the same period only by
about 10 per cent. This more rapid price movement of the finer, as
opposed to the coarser, wools may be attributed to the heavier
demand for the finer wools for civilian clothing in the early post-war
years, and to the fact that during the war large reserves of crossbred
wools were created for war supplies, considerable stocks being
available at the end of the war. This upward movement was very
short-lived and a heavy fall followed, which brought crossbred and
carpet wool prices to 40 per cent, below the 1913 level, but left merino
prices 40 per cent, above that level.
This first post-war slump unprecedented as it was in its suddenness
and magnitude was, like the preceding rise, of extremely short
duration in the case of merino and carpet wools but of considerably
longer duration in the case of crossbred. Its termination was no
doubt hastened by the inauguration of the British Australian Wool
Realization Association (8.A.W.R.A.) which was formed in January,
1921, for the purpose of liquidating the large stocks of wool remaining
in the hands of the Imperial Government at the termination of the
Imperial Wool Purchase Scheme. The knowledge that these heavy
stocks would not be thrown indiscriminately on the market resulted
in a marked change in the attitude of buyers, and there followed 3 J years
of rising prices. Merino wool attained a level of 80 pence per lb. clean
scoured basis, or nearly 80 per cent, above the September, 1921, low
point, and carpet wool reached 15| pence per lb. raw state, or 180
per cent, above the September, 1921,price. It was not until September,
1922, that a decided upward movement began in crossbred wools, but
when it did appear it was very pronounced, prices rising from 11J
pence per lb. clean scoured basis, in September, 1922, to 37| pence
per lb. in December, 1924, an increase of 226 per cent. The high
point attained by crossbred wool on this occasion was only about
10 per cent, below the record price of March, 1920, but in the case of
merino the high point attained in December, 1924, was 47 per cent,
below the previous high point.
The fall in prices which again set in at the beginning of 1925 lasted
two years. In the first year the fall was marked, merino prices
fading by 35 per cent., crossbred prices by 44 per cent., and carpet
wool prices by 23 per cent. In the second year the rate of decline
was much reduced and by December, 1926, the total fall as compared
with December, 1924, was 40 per cent, for merino, 48 per cent, for

crossbred, and 33 per cent, for carpet wool. The low point attained
in December, 1926, was for all classes of wool appreciably above the
low point of December, 1921, and at or above the pre-1914 high point.
The succeeding rise beginning early in 1927 was of such short duration
that it can be regarded as merely a temporary break in the price
decline which began in 1924. Merino prices rose only 15 per cent, and
crossbred and carpet wool prices about 35 per cent, and within 15
months, i.e. by April, 1928, the rise had ceased and in the case of
merino and crossbred a definite drop in prices was again in evidence.
The fall which followed has so far endured for four years and has
been of such a magnitude as to reduce prices to the lowest point
reached for forty years. After September, 1931, there was a slight
upward tendency in the sterling prices of raw wool following upon the
depreciated value of sterling in terms of gold, but the rise was
maintained, and sterling prices in June, 1932, were actually below
the gold prices of June, 1931. The following table summarises the
price fluctuations in the pre-war and post-war periods.


THE RELATION OF RAW WOOL PRICES TO THE GENERAL
PRICE LEVEL.
The rise in raw wool prices during the pre-war period under review
and the violent fall since the end of the war have been to an important
extent the result of fluctuations in the value of money. In the
quinquennium 1890 to 1894 the Sauerbeck end-of-quarter index of
commodity prices (1867-1877=100) averaged 68-2, as compared
with 80-7 in the quinquennium 1909 to 1913, an increase of about
18 per cent. The average end-of-quarter prices of raw wool in these
two periods increased by about 50 per cent, in the case of merino
wool, about 16 per cent, in the case of crossbred wool and about
12 per cent, in the case of carpet wool.
Similarly in the post-war period, between March, 1920, when the
peak both of raw wool prices and commodity prices generally was
attained, and September, 1931, the Sauerbeck index fell by 70 per
cent, as compared with a fall of 86 per cent, in the case of merino
wool, 79 per cent, in the case of crossbred wool and 64 per cent, in
the case of carpet wool. It is important to note that throughout the
whole post-war period, London wool prices have moved more rapidly
than the general commodity index and, moreover, the rise in wool
prices that occurred in 1921-22 and 1926-27 was much in advance of
the upward movement in the general commodity index.
The relation between the movement of raw wool prices and the
general commodity index in the post-war period is illustrated in
Diagram IV. It will be seen that merino and carpet wool prices
have followed the general commodity index more closely than cross-
bred prices. Crossbred prices have been relatively low in terms of
other commodities during almost the whole post-war period, whereas,
except in 1921, merino prices were above the level of general com-
modity prices right up to 1929. Carpet wool has resisted the recent
price depression far more effectively than either merino or crossbred,
and it fell below the level of general commodity prices only towards
the end of 1930. The three wool types, but particularly merino and
crossbred, were at December, 1931, all well below the general price
level, the various indices being as follows.
1909-13. Dec. 1931.
General Commodity index .. ~ 100 .. 106
Carpet wool .. .. .. .. 100 .. 95
Merino wool .. .. .. .. 100 .. 69
Crossbred wool .. .. .. 100 53






The movement in the commodity value of merino and crossbred
wools from 1890 to 1931 is illustrated in Diagram V; the
commodity value index has been calculated by dividing the price
index (1909-13 = 100) by the Sauerbeck index reduced to the same
base. The relatively low levels ruling for crossbred wool and the
relatively high levels for merino wool during the post-war period will
be noticed, as well as the stability of the commodity value of merino
wool between 1903 and 1913 as against the violent fluctuation in
crossbred values during this period. In the post-war period both wool
types showed great instability but the fluctuations in crossbred
prices were generally more considerable than those of merino.
THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PRICE OF MERINO AND
CROSSBRED WOOLS.
The wider fluctuations in the prices of crossbred wool appear to be
largely due to its relative inelasticity of supply arising out of the fact
that the crossbred sheep is a dual purpose animal with wool and
mutton as its joint products. There is always a strong tendency for
the supply of a joint product to be less elastic than that of a similar
product separately produced, since the price variation of two products
is likely to be less than that of one alone. In particular, when one
of the dual products has a price level distinctly more stable than the
other, the supply of the second will be less responsive to variations
in price than if it were separately produced.
This is the case with mutton and crossbred wool. The price of
mutton has shown very much less variation than that of wool and has
exerted a strong influence to maintain the production of crossbred
wool in periods of low wool prices and to restrain expansion in periods
of high wool prices with the result that the automatic adjustment of
supply to demand through price has been largely absent. The move-
ment in mutton and crossbred wool prices since 1920 is indicated in
Table 97.
The relative stability of mutton prices is clearly indicated. Between
1920 and 1922 when crossbred wool prices diminished by about 60
per cent., the change in mutton prices was insignificant. Similarly,
during the rapid rise in wool prices between 1923 and 1924, the
average price of mutton remained relatively stable. Again, between
1928 and mid-1932, when wool prices fell by over 73 per cent., mutton
prices fell by only 40 per cent.

(a) These axe averages of weekly wholesale prices at Smithfield market as published

ference to quarterly prices as in the case of wool because mutton prices are to a large
extent subject to seasonal influences.
( b ) Controlled price for all qualities.
(c) Average price for January to May.
In the case of merino wool the sheep’s carcass is of lesser import-
ance and the supply of the wool is thus more responsive to price
changes, provided these price-movements are of sufficiently long
duration. The relative values of merino and crossbred wools are also
influenced on the one hand by the relative production of each type
and on the other hand by the relative demand for the finer or coarser
wools. The movement in the value of merino wool in terms of cross-
bred wool both before and since the war is illustrated in Diagram VI.
There is a noticeably greater fluctuation in the value of merino
wool in terms of crossbred in the post-war period than before the war.
At one period, 1921-22, when wool prices were suffering from their




first post-war slump, 1 lb. of merino was equivalent in value to over
4 lb. of crossbred as compared with an average of about If lb. in the
pre-war quinquennium and a peak of 2f lb. in 1902. This abnormally
low relative value of crossbred wool may be attributed to the con-
siderable increase in the production of crossbred wool which had taken
place for war supplies, coupled with the increased demand for merino
wool for civilian clothing. Once this abnormal set of circumstances
had disappeared the value of merino in terms of crossbred speedily
declined, but the relative value of merino wool as compared with
crossbred is still appreciably higher than before the war. In view of
the estimate in Chapter 4 that the proportion of merino in the total
production has increased in recent years, this higher relative value is
probably due to the relatively greater demand for the finer wools
to satisfy the demand for lighter tissues and for knitted wear either
of wool alone or in conjunction with artificial silk.
THE EFFECT OF PRICE ON SUPPLY.
The heavy price fall that has been in operation since 1928 has so
far had no comparable effect upon the supplies of raw wool. Between
1928 and 1930, although the price of the three typical wools fell by
between 30 and 50 per cent., production experienced no material
reduction and the preliminary partial estimates for 1931 indicate
a cessation in the slight downward movement observed in the
preceding year. The preceding slump in wool prices, i.e. from
1924 to 1926, was similarly not accompanied by a reduction in
supplies ; on the contrary, during this period the world’s wool
supplies advanced by an almost unprecedented amount.
The general cause of this lack of relation between price and supply
seems to lie in the importance of supplementary cost in the business
of sheep-raising, and the relatively small part played by prime cost.
In the short period—and during a depression the “ short ” period may
last a considerable time—comparatively little attention is paid to
supplementary cost so long as prime cost is being covered. Even if
the business is being carried on with borrowed capital, unwillingness
to foreclose on the part of banks and other lenders will produce the
same effect. So a farmer may continue for a long period with a return
only just sufficient to cover his prime cost. In the long run, of course,
supplementary cost must be covered or the farmer will be forced out
of business, but in periods of wide and prolonged depression, this may


take a considerable time and in any case will not necessarily result in
the disappearance of his flocks, but merely in their transfer to some
other farmer.
As regards particular causes, there are two main ways in which low
prices might be expected to react upon the number of sheep and
hence on the production of wool. They may lead either to an increase
in the mortality among sheep, or to a decrease in the birth rate. One
factor in increasing the mortality of sheep would be increased slaughter
for food purposes, but a fall in wool values rarely leads to a greatly
increased rate of slaughter, and the recent price fall has certainly not
resulted in any such increase. The other way in which mortality may
increase is through greater losses from natural causes. Low wool
prices undoubtedly tend to reduce the expenditure by sheep farmers
on such things as fencing, hand-feeding, water-conservation and the
eradication of diseases and pests, and in consequence tend to increase
mortality from natural causes. Such expenditure has, no doubt,
been reduced during recent years, but the effects of such curtailment
are not as yet discernible owing to favourable seasons in the larger
producing areas.
Perhaps more important than an increase in the rate of mortality
in determining numbers is a decrease in the rate of births. This will
only decrease—natural conditions apart—as a result of a definite
decision on the part of the farmer to cut down his breeding stock. In
view of the small additional prime cost involved in feeding the extra
sheep he is not likely to do this unless he is able to turn over the items
involved in his supplementary cost—land, buildings, etc. —to some
more advantageous form of production. In important sheep areas,
for instance, in Australia and South Africa, the climatic and soil
conditions are not suitable for other types of farming, and even where
such alternatives are possible, the prices to be obtained for the alter-
native products have not been such as to encourage the transition,
while lack of capital has probably also been a powerful limiting factor.
In these circumstances the sheep farmer has had no alternative but
to concentrate on cutting down his costs as far as possible. Shearing
and other labour charges have been appreciably lowered and the
process of carrying on his industry despite the reduced returns has
been further promoted to an important extent by the postponement of
his capital charges. Moreover, in certain countries, notably Australia,
Argentina and New Zealand, the recent abandonment of the gold
standard has in effect resulted in a bounty on exports which has been


of considerable value to the sheep farmer who exports the great bulk
of his produce. In wool-exporting countries which have up to the
present retained the gold standard, such as the Union of South Africa,
no such advantage has accrued ; on the contrary, the exports of such
countries are handicapped by the greater competitive potentialities of
the others. In the Union of South Africa a bounty on exports has
now been granted, and this will act, to some extent at least, as a
counteracting force.




PART V.
MISCELLANEOUS ANIMAL FIBRES.




CHAPTER 7.—FIBRES OF THE GOAT CLASS.
Introduction.
The preceding Chapters have been confined to sheep’s wool, which
is, of course, the chief raw material of the wool textile industry. In
addition, a number of other animal fibres, possessing varying degrees
of similarity to sheep’s wool, are utilised in the industry, their use
being supplementary rather than competitive. The amount pro-
duced is relatively small, and they are largely confined to specialities
for which they are particularly suitable, such as braids, plushes,
linings, upholstery coverings, rugs and shawls.
These minor animal fibres fall conveniently into two groups—those
derived from animals of the goat class, such as mohair and cashmere,
and those from animals of the camel class, such as camel hair, alpaca,
llama and vicuna wools. The British Empire is responsible for rather
more than one-half of the world exports of mohair, but none of the
other fibres is exported from Empire countries.
I.—HAIR OF THE ANGORA GOAT (MOHAIR).
Nature and Utilisation.
The value of mohair as a textile fibre is due to its lustre, fineness,
length and strength and to the spinning and dyeing qualities which it
possesses. It lacks felting properties, which for some uses is an
added advantage. It is employed in the manufacture of linings,
upholstery materials and men’s light-weight suitings, and for braids,
draperies, laces, hats and pile fabrics. Mohair is by far the most
important of the miscellaneous animal fibres utilised in the wool
textile industry.
Sources of Supply.
The production of mohair is confined almost entirely to three
areas, namely, the United States of America, British South Africa
and Asiatic Turkey. All attempts to raise Angora goats in Europe
have failed. There are a few minor sources of supply, as, for example,
Australia and New Zealand, although the industry in these countries
is of small importance. It has recently been suggested that Uganda
and Kenya are well suited to the raising of Angora goats, as these
areas support native breeds which could be replaced by introducing
stud Angoras from the Cape Province.

Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the district around the
town of Angora in Turkey was the only important producing area.
The earliest imports of Angora goats into the Union of South Africa
on a large scale took place in 1856 and the following years. Develop-
ment in the Union was slow at first, but before the end of the century
the South African clip equalled that of Turkey. Development in
America was later and, at first, slower. In 1910 America produced
only 25 per cent, of the amount provided by South Africa; but, since
then, the American industry has developed remarkably, with the result
that the American clip in 1931 appreciably exceeded the combined
output of British South Africa and Turkey. The British Empire
provided only 25 per cent, of the world’s production during the period
1928-31, as against over 55 per cent, during the period 1909-11.
Table 98 illustrates the trend of mohair production in each
of the three chief producing areas. It will be observed that the
volume of production in recent years has been at approximately the
pre-war level.

The United States of America.
Climatic and pastoral conditions in parts of the United States are
well suited to the Angora breed of goat, which is not easily acclima-
tised to new surroundings. The Angora goat has proved useful in
keeping down brush growth in pastures, as well as in clearing brush
in areas to be used for farming, and the development of the industry
has, moreover, been encouraged by an import duty on raw mohair
and by a growing demand for mohair goods, helped by propaganda.
The following table indicates the Angora goat population of
the six chief goat-raising States, together with the average yield per
goat in those States and the aggregate annual production since 1920.
(a) Figures cover six States accounting for over 90 per cent, of the total production.
(b) Includes yield from goats shorn twice a year and from kids which are shorn
in the autumn of the year of their birth.
(c) Revised figures based on 1930 census results.
American farmers have improved the quality of the goats by
selective breeding and, in consequence, have substantially increased
the average annual yield. In Texas, where 70 per cent, of the goats
are located, this has increased from 3-7 lb. in 1920 to 4*6 lb. in 1931
and a similar increase has occurred in most of the other goat-raising


States. In the six largest producing States, an increase of 52 per
cent, in the Angora goat population between 1920-22 and 1928-30
was accompanied by an increase of 76 per cent, in the production
of mohair. The United States’ mohair production is almost entirely
consumed within the country, and little American mohair enters
world trade.
At the end of 1931 there were large stocks of mohair in the United
States of America amounting to about a two-year supply* and it
is possible that this factor may arrest the rapid growth in production
that has been in evidence in recent years.
British South Africa.
The second largest producing area is the Union of South Africa,
together with the adjoining territories of Basutoland and South-West
Africa Territory; before the war, these South African areas con-
stituted the principal source of supply. Practically the whole of
the clip is exported. In the period 1927-29, exports through Union
ports averaged 9-5 million lb. per annum, rather more than one-
quarter of which was Basutoland produce, while about one-twentieth
came from South-West Africa Territory.
Statistics of mohair production, which are now compiled annually
for the Union, are reproduced in Table 100. They reveal a
pronounced and fairly consistent decline in production, the average
annual clip for the period from 1926-27 to 1928-29 being more than
30 per cent, below that for 1919-20 to 1921-22 and about 60 per
cent, below that for 1910-11. The decline in production may be
attributed partly to the competition of merino sheep, which are less
affected by droughts than the Angora goat, and partly to the decreas-
ing world trade in mohair, following upon the self-sufficiency of
America as regards this commodity and the diminished demand for
mohair goods in Europe.
More recently there has been an increase in mohair production
and the estimate for 1929-30 exceeds 7 million lb., as compared
with about 5| millions in 1927-28. In view of the continued
increase in the Angora goat population of the Union since 1929-30,
the rising trend of production of mohair may be expected to continue
for some little time.
British South Africa is responsible at the present time for about
one-half of the world exports of mohair. Table 101 shows

Turkey.
For some years prior to 1914, Turkey was the second largest
mohair-producing area in the world, but during the World War
production fell to small dimensions, owing to the slaughter of goats
for food and to deaths from disease and neglect, and further losses
occurred during the subsequent war with Greece. Since then, some
recovery has taken place. Almost all the mohair comes from a well-
defined area in Asiatic Turkey centred around the Province of
Angora. There are no complete statistics of the production, but,
as only a very small quantity is consumed locally, exports give a
fairly good indication of the trend. Table 102 shows the distribution
of the exports for certain pre-war years and annually since 1927.
Production in recent years has been below the pre-war level.
In 1930 practically the whole of the exports went to the United
Kingdom, but the Soviet Union and Syria entered the market in
1931 and purchases by those countries, if continued, may offset the
withdrawal of America from the Turkish market. Both countries
take the lower qualities and in Syria the mohair is utilised for blending
with the local carpet wools.*

The Course of Mohair Prices.
Raw mohair prices have followed much the same general course as
raw wool prices, but the fluctuations have been far less pronounced.
As with wool there has been a pronounced fall since 1928, and by
June, 1932, London prices were lower than at any time during the
past twenty-five years. Tables 103 and 104 show for 1906 to date
(i) the London prices of Cape and Turkey mohair, and (ii) the Texas
price of American mohair. The London prices have been furnished
by Messrs. Schwartze, Buchanan and Co., of London and the Texas
prices by the Schreiner Wool and Mohair Commission Company, of
(a) Nominal; only a small quantity sold. (6) No quotation available,

Kerrville, Texas, to the National Association of Wool Manufacturers,
of Boston, Massachusetts, which made the necessary enquiries on
behalf of the Empire Marketing Board. The course of these prices
since 1906 is illustrated in Diagram VII, from which it will be seen
that they each followed similar movements over the whole period
under review. London prices for the greater part of the past six years
have been largely nominal, particularly in the case of Cape mohair.
[a) Not available. The average price paid by the National Wool Marketing
Corporation prior to shearing was 35 cents for the Spring clip and 30 cents for the
Fall clip in 1930, the corresponding prices in 1931 being 221 cents and 15 cents
respectively.




II.—HAIR OF THE CASHMERE GOAT (CASHMERE).
Nature and Utilisation.
The fleece of the Cashmere goat has an outer covering of long,
straight hairs at the roots of which grows a very fine, soft undercoat.
The undercoat is known as “ cashmere,” and it is this product which
is of special interest to the wool textile industry. The outer hair is
coarse and does not enter largely into the textile industry. Cashmere
is usually obtained by combing the under-wool from the living animal,
and is remarkable for its lightness and fluffiness which, incidentally,
necessitates special care in the processes of manufacture. It is
specially suitable for shawls and scarves and for light hosiery and
underwear and is also used with wool in the manufacture of fine cloths.
Sources of Supply.
The Cashmere goat is raised in Tibet (its native land), in
the adjoining Kashmir State and, more particularly, in China.
Attempts which have been made to acclimatise it in other parts of
the world have been unsuccessful, and hence the world’s supply of
cashmere comes from a restricted region, most of which is outside
the British Empire. The Cashmere goat is not bred extensively,
and the yield per head of true cashmere is very light. Consequently,
the total quantity produced is very small, and owing to its relatively
high cost in normal times, substitutes are made from cotton or
cotton and wool.
No statistics of production are available. Undoubtedly in Kashmir
a large part of the available supply is used for making the shawls
for which that country is famous, and for practical purposes it may
be assumed that all the raw cashmere which enters international
trade comes from China. China’s trade in cashmere, like that in
sheep’s wool, is concentrated at Tientsin, where the hair is sorted
into three qualities, the first consisting almost entirely of a soft
down, and the second of an admixture of down and coarse hair, the
latter predominating; the third sort, amounting to between 5 and
10 per cent, of the whole, is ordinary goats’ hair, although it is
sometimes referred to as third-quality cashmere.
The figures of exports from China distinguish between “ Goats’
Wool ” and “ Goats’ Hair,” and it has been assumed for the present
purpose that the former refers to the under-wool combed from the
Cashmere goat, and the latter to ordinary goat-hair, including
third-quality cashmere.

Exports of “ Goats’ Wool ” from China averaged about 3 million
lb. per annum during the six years from 1924 to 1930, as compared
with an average of 1-8 million lb. in the pre-war quinquennium.
The fluctuations since 1926 shown in Table 105 were more probably
due to dislocation in trade through internal disturbances than to
variations in production.

exports over land frontiers have not been traced.

CHAPTER 8. —FIBRES OF THE CAMEL CLASS.
I.—CAMEL HAIR.
Nature and Utilisation.
The camel yields a coarse hair and a woolly hair. The former,
which comes from the manes, is longer and of a darker colour than
the latter, and is used chiefly for oii-press bags and machine belting.
The woolly hair is of more importance in the textile industry, and
is used principally for hosiery, blankets, underwear, rugs, and special
effects in tweeds.
Sources of Supply.
The camel hair employed in the textile industry is obtained from
the Bactrian camel of China and Russia. The hair of the Dromedary,
which is raised in Western Asia, is of poorer quality and is largely
consumed locally.

China.
Russia having virtually ceased to export camel hair, manufac-
turers are now dependent almost entirely upon supplies from China,
the areas of production being North China and Mongolia. In China,
the camel is usually a beast of burden and this reduces the commercial
value of its hair. The Mongols have recently begun to raise camels
which are kept exclusively for their hair, and these animals yield
annually about 6| lb. of fibre.
Production statistics are not available, but some indication of the
trend of production is afforded by the official statistics of exports
which are set out in Table 106. Between 1924 and 1929 there was an
appreciable increase as compared with the pre-war quinquennium,
but in 1930 there was a sharp fall to 3 million lb. or little more than
one-half the average annual volume exported in the period 1924-29.
The United Kingdom is by far the most important market.
(a) These figures represent the exports through maritime ports only ; particulars
of exports over land frontiers have not been traced.
The Soviet Umon {Russia).
No annual statistics of the production of camel hair in the Soviet
Union (Russia) are available, but the amount procured by the
Textile Trust is now about 7 million lb. per annum.* The propor-
tion of the total production which this figure represents is not known.
* Information furnished by Editor of the “ Bank for Russian Trade Review.”


Prior to the war, Russia competed with China as an exporter of
camel hair and, in 1913, of the total imports of 9-5 million lb. of
camel hair into the United Kingdom, 4*9 million lb., or more than
one-half, came from Russia. In the post-war period, Russian exports
of camel hair have been negligible, and the production is almost
entirely consumed locally. In 1931, the total exports from the Soviet
Union of “ wool other than sheep's wool ” (which term presumably
includes camel hair) aggregated 2*2 million lb.
II.—ALPACA.
Nature and Utilisation.
The Alpaca is a domesticated animal kept entirely for the sake
of its fleece and is shorn in alternate years. The fleece, which is
soft, elastic and very lustrous, is coloured brown, grey or black,
with a small proportion of white fibres, and this seriously limits its
utilisation. It is used mainly for dress fabrics, linings and, like
mohair, has for some time been facing severe competition from
artificial silk.
Sources of Supply.
Alpaca wool is produced only in South America, mainly in Peru,
and, to a very small extent, in Bolivia and Chile. There is no source
of supply within the British Empire, although the United Kingdom
is the largest importer of these wools.
Peru.
The number of Alpaca in Peru is not accurately known since no
census has yet been taken. According to the “ South American
Handbook,” 1932, they numbered about 1,500,000.
The production of alpaca hair is also not known and the exports
cannot serve as a basis for an estimate since there is a considerable
consumption within the country in the making of cloth, hosiery,
gloves and other articles*
Peru supplies the great bulk of the alpaca entering world trade,
and Table 107 suggests that some development has taken place in
recent years. The United Kingdom still constitutes by far the
most important market, although consignments to the United States
have shown an appreciable increase in recent years.
* The results of the 1929 census, since received, indicate that in that year there
were 609,000 Alpaca with a production of 7-5 million lb. of alpaca wool.

An appreciable part of the alpaca consigned to the United Kingdom
is re-exported, principally to France and Germany. In 1929 and
1930 the United Kingdom retained only about 60 per cent, of the
gross imports.
Bolivia and Chile.
No statistics of the production of alpaca in Bolivia and Chile have
been traced, but the number of Alpaca in these two countries is
known to be small, particularly in Chile. Exports from Bolivia in
recent years have averaged 400,000 lb. and have shown considerable
development since the war. Chile, which exported only about
66,000 lb. of alpaca in 1929, is of very small importance.
III.—LLAMA.
Nature and Utilisation.
The llama is a domestic animal similar in origin to the alpaca ;
the animal serves as a beast of burden and its wool, which is coarse
and inelastic, is used mainly for carpet and rug piles.
Sources of Supply.
There are estimated to be some 600,000 llamas in Peru ; the
annual production of llama wool is very variable because the
animals are not regularly shorn, long intervals sometimes elapsing
between shearings. Peru is the principal exporter and supplies from

that country have appreciably declined in recent years. A con-
siderable part of the production is consumed locally, and practically
the whole of the exports are taken by the United Kingdom.
IV.—VICUNA.
Nature and Utilisation.
The vicuna, a wild animal about the size of a small sheep, is
hunted for the sake of its wool, which consists of exceedingly fine
fibres, with a very silky texture, high lustre and good felting qualities.
The wool is the finest of all the animal fibres used for manufacturing
purposes and is very valuable. Vicuna wool is used for the weaving
of the finest cloths. Owing to its high value it is seldom used alone,
but forms a component part of fine fabric mixtures. The supply of
vicuna wool is small, and is becoming more and more limited. An
imitation vicuna fabric is now made from either cotton alone or a
mixture of cotton and sheep’s wool.
Sources of Supply.
Vicuna wool is produced in Peru and Bolivia. As the animals are
wild, they have to be killed before their wool can be obtained and
this practice is resulting in a marked decrease in their numbers and
in the production of vicuna wool. Steps have recently been taken
by the Peruvian authorities to maintain the vicuna population.
Production statistics are not available but exports have fallen to a
negligible volume.


PART VI.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.




CHAPTER 9.
SUMMARY.
(i) The World’s Sheep Population.
The sheep population of the world can only be roughly estimated,
owing to the large areas for which only approximate data are avail-
able. In these areas, which include the greater part of Asia and
large parts of South America, the statistics of sheep numbers are so
unsatisfactory that no clear idea can be formed of the trend of the
sheep population. The information that is available for the remaining
areas covers, in large measure, the most important sheep-raising
regions and those of importance from the point of view of wool
supplies. Despite the deficiencies in the statistics, it is possible to
give an approximate indication of the distribution and development
of the world’s sheep.
Appendix I gives an estimate, based largely on census results, of
the sheep population in each of the years 1905, 1909, 1913, 1921, 1925
and 1929 for all countries except Afghanistan and one or two other
Asiatic countries for which not even reliable unofficial estimates have
been traced. In all cases, the data refer to the number of sheep within
the frontiers of the country in the years shown, or in the nearest year
for which figures are available, as it has not been found possible in
every case to re-assess the sheep population on the basis of present
frontiers in the large number of countries concerned.
The total number of sheep in the world in 1929 is estimated at
about 780 million, of which about 260 million were in Europe
(including Asiatic Russia), 160 million in America, 130 million in
Oceania, 130 million in Asia and 100 million in Africa. The world’s
sheep increased by nearly 20 per cent, after 1921, following upon a
decrease both in the pre-war quinquennium and during the period
of the war.
About one-third of the world’s sheep are found within the British
Empire, the principal sheep-raising countries being the Common-
wealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa, New Zealand, the
United Kingdom and India, which together own over 90 per cent,
of the Empire sheep. Between 1905 and 1929, Empire sheep
increased by over 40 per cent., while those of all other countries
showed in the aggregate an increase of only about 8 per cent. The
development of the sheep population in the British Empire and
foreign countries during the past twenty-five years is summarised
in Table 109.

In the pre-war period, from 1905 to 1913, the trend of the world’s
sheep population was first upward, mainly as a result of increases in
Oceania and South Africa, and then downward, consequent upon
reductions in Argentina and Uruguay, and just before the outbreak
of the war it was back at its 1905 level. The net result of the war
period was a further slight fall occasioned by the excessive slaughter-
ing of flocks to provide food. In the post-war period, the general
trend has been upward, and the increase between 1921 and 1929 is
estimated at about 120 million sheep or nearly 20 per cent. The rise
was general, with the Soviet Union (Russia), the Commonwealth of
Australia and the Union of South Africa as the principal contri-
butors.
Comprehensive sheep figures for later years are not available, but
certain data have been published and are summarised in Table 110,
which shows such enumerations or estimates as are available between
1925 and 1931 for nine of the largest wool-producing countries of the
world.

Since 1929 the Australian sheep population has still further
increased and the level of 107 millions attained at the end of 1930,
which is still only equivalent to that of 1891, is probably capable of
improvement in view of the developments effected since then by
water conservation and the boring of artesian wells to avoid the
heavy losses which were experienced in the period 1892 to 1902 from
water and feed deficiency. But a dense sheep population increases
the liability to losses, and the period of low wool prices through
which the industry has been passing since 1928 may eventually have
the effect of preventing the sheep-farmer from being in a position
to incur the expenditure necessary to guard against such losses. The
latest information suggests that the 1930 level was maintained
during 1931 as a result of favourable climatic conditions. In South
Africa, the rapid growth of recent years, which continued into
1931, gives promise of a still further advance in numbers in the future.
This development has been due to a concentration on merino sheep
which are particularly suited to the climate and pasture, to a
period of high prices during and for some years after the war, and
to an active interest in research and the distribution of technical
information. In New Zealand, the sheep population was at a
record level in 1930; a slight decrease took place in 1931, but the steps
that are being taken in the Dominion by means of top-dressing and
grass research to increase the carrying capacity of the land indicate
that the density of the sheep population, high though it is, may
reasonably be expected to continue its upward trend. An important
factor is, of course, the extent of the demand for mutton and lamb
and no doubt this has been largely responsible for the development of
the Dominion’s flocks in past years. In the United Kingdom and
the Irish Free State the tendency since the war has been upward,
the increase in the aggregate flocks between 1921 and 1931 being
nearly 6 millions or 25 per cent. In the remaining Empire countries
taken as a whole, the growth in recent years has not been great, as
far as the available data affords a clue to the trend, and it seems
evident that any substantial future development in the Empire sheep
flocks must be looked for in Austraha, the Union of South Africa and
New Zealand.
As regards foreign countries, the most marked growth in sheep
numbers has taken place in the Soviet Union (Russia) where, between
1922 and 1929, an increase of nearly 45 millions was recorded. This
rapid development was no doubt encouraged by the scarcity of food


and clothing which was experienced after the war and revolutions,
and more recently has been still further promoted under the first
Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Authorities. A serious check was
experienced in 1930, when the numbers dropped by over 30 millions,
owing to slaughterings by the peasants to avoid handing over their
flocks to the collectivised farms. Russia is capable of carrying a much
larger sheep population and represents one of the most potent factors
in the future growth of the world’s sheep ; but she needs not only
to increase her flocks but also to improve their quality—a matter
of much greater difficulty and requiring much more time.
The United States flocks have also increased substantially since the
war, under the encouragement of a tariff on imported wool. This
growth may receive a check when the sheep population is capable
of satisfying domestic requirements of the type of wool grown,
although the demand for mutton and lamb may counteract this check.
In this connection it is of interest to note that in recent years over
80 per cent, of the requirements of the United States textile industry for
combing and carding wools is estimated to have been satisfied by
the domestic supply. In South America, appreciable development
has been recorded in recent years, particularly in the sheep flocks of
Uruguay, which are now nearly double the 1916 level. In Europe,
outside the Soviet Union, no marked movement in the flocks
has been observable on the whole; Germany is still reducing her
sheep numbers, in continuation of the trend which set in over half
a century ago, and the 1930 census returns of Italy have revealed
an appreciable decline. For the foreign countries in Africa and Asia
the statistics are generally unsatisfactory and the published estimates
give little or no indication of the trend. These areas offer little
prospect of marked growth in the near future, although potentialities
for development undoubtedly exist, particularly in China and parts
of Northern Africa.
Diagram VIII illustrates the trend of sheep numbers during the
past twenty years in six of the chief sheep-raising countries. Argentina
has been omitted as figures for that country are available only at
wide intervals during the period in question.
In Australia and South Africa the merino overwhelmingly pre-
dominates, and in the United States the flocks consist for the most
part of the merino type. New Zealand, and to a large extent Western




Europe and South America, are the homes of the crossbred, which is
kept principally for its carcass. But the crossbred sheep also
provides good quality wool, sometimes not much inferior in fineness
to the coarsest qualities of the merino. Russian sheep are almost
entirely coarse-woolled and Northern and Central Africa, Asia and
South-Eastern Europe own either coarse-woolled or hair sheep. It
is not possible to give precise figures of the world’s sheep classified
into types but it is estimated that out of nearly 800 million sheep, close
on one-half are either low-woolled or non-woolled, the remainder con-
sisting of the merino and crossbred types in roughly equal proportions.
Nor is it possible to state with any degree of certainty how the various
types are developing, but in most sheep-raising lands attention is
being increasingly given to the improvement of the sheep and to
their better adaptation to the climatic and pasturage conditions
obtaining in the particular area. It remains to be seen whether,
in such areas as Russia, China and other important countries owning
for the most part coarse-woolled sheep, the steps in this direction will
succeed eventually in changing the character of the flocks and in
producing an animal capable of yielding a heavier and finer fleece.
Various factors operate in causing a rise or fall in sheep numbers.
Of these, drought is the most spectacular, but there are others which
may be equally effective, namely, the pressure of the demand for
arable land, the competition of other animals for the available
pasturage, the development of facilities for the transport of the
sheep’s carcass, research into sheep disease and nutrition and the
trend in wool and mutton prices. Australia suffers more from
periodical water deficiency than any other large sheep-raising land,
and the pastoral history of Australia is marked by recurring droughts
which have brought in their train large losses in the sheep population.
In 1902, for instance, following several successive years of drought,
the sheep population of the Commonwealth numbered 54 million as
against 106 million in 1891. It has taken 40 years to regain the peak
of that year, but it should of course be remembered that this period
has also witnessed considerable development in other activities of
the Commonwealth. During a period of high prices the effect of
drought tends to be minimised, as the sheep-farmer is in a better
position to conserve his flocks by incurring the expense of hand-
feeding with supplementary fodder. Thus the favourable market
conditions ruling during the war had the effect of stimulating
production and minimising losses from feed-deficiency in Australia
during that period.


Sheep-raising has not always been able to hold its own against the
pressure of other livestock or of arable land, and this has been
particularly noticeable in Argentina, where cattle farming and grain
crops are offering severe competition to sheep-farming. In certain
other areas it would appear that much the same development is in
progress. Denmark is a typical instance. There, since the beginning
of the century, the sheep population has decreased from about
900,000 to 200,000, whilst cattle have increased from under 2 million
to over 3 million head, and pigs from under million to over
3 \ million head. Nevertheless, an increase in cattle does not always
coincide with a decrease in sheep, Australia and Spain being notable
instances where cattle and sheep have both increased over a lengthy
period.
An impetus was given to the sheep-raising industry by the intro-
duction of refrigeration, which widened the market for the sheep’s
carcass. The effect of this factor on the world’s sheep population
was not as widespread and important as might have been expected,
because it only affected the mutton-sheep industry, and certain of the
large sheep-raising areas of the world are constrained by climatic
conditions to raise a majority of non-mutton sheep. Its effect on
the New Zealand and Argentine sheep-raising industry has been very
considerable. The turnover from merinos to crossbreds in New
Zealand, which was coincident with a steady rise in the sheep
population, can be attributed, in large measure, to the refrigerating
trade, and, indeed, any factor resulting in an increased consumption
of mutton and lamb will tend to bring about an increase in sheep
numbers. The relation between the sheep population and the
development of refrigeration will be treated in more detail in a
Survey of Mutton and Lamb which the Board contemplate publishing
at a later date.
The net result of the operation of these various factors has been a
growth in the world’s sheep flocks to a record level, but its continua-
tion may not be possible with the present low level of wool and
mutton prices unless sheep-farmers can succeed in reducing their
costs of production.
(ii) The World Production of Raw Wool.
The world production of raw wool since 1924, which is shown in
detail in Appendix II and illustrated in Diagram IX, has made
noteworthy progress. The growth has been fairly general in most
producing areas except those in Asia, for which production statistics

But the bulk of the collected statistics are generally reliable and
these show a marked upward movement.
(a) Not available: assumed same as in 1929 in total.
(b) Average of years 1926 and 1929 taken, in the absence of production figures for
these years.
(c) Sheep’s wool only; for full details as to the statistics used in this table reference
should be made to the explanatory notes to Appendix 11.


The world production of raw wool in 1929 is estimated at over
3.700 million lb. (“ greasy ” basis). As this figure excludes the wool
retained in certain producing countries, notably China and India,
the volume of world production is somewhat higher. The total of
3.700 million lb. represents an increase of 20 per cent, since 1924.
The progress was most marked in the first half of the period, nearly
60 per cent, of the aggregate net increase having occurred between
1924 and 1926. After 1926 the advance was slower and in 1930 a
reaction set in owing largely to reduced production in Australia and
the Soviet Union (Russia). Preliminary estimates for 1931, which
are available for some of the most important producing areas, suggest
that the fall has been arrested and that world production in that year
will probably not fall far short, if at all, of the record levels of 1928
and 1929.
The British Empire, it will be recalled, contains only about one-third
of the world’s sheep, yet nearly one-half of the world’s wool is produced
within the Empire and no marked change in this share has taken
place in recent years. Table 111 shows the distribution of the
world’s wool production between the British Empire and foreign
countries.
About 80 per cent, of the world’s production of raw wool is fur-
nished by nine countries. Australia is easily the premier source of
supply, her production being more than double that of the United
States of America, the next largest producer ; Argentina follows with
about 80 per cent, of the production of the United States ; and the
Soviet Union (Russia), the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand
succeed one another at fairly close intervals, while Uruguay, the
United Kingdom and Spain come next in order of importance.
Table 112 indicates the annual rate of development of the wool
production of these countries since 1924. If, however, complete
information were available for China and India, these two countries
would certainly rank with the leading wool-producers shown in this
table.
It will be seen that the Union of South Africa, Uruguay, the United
States of America and the Soviet Union (Russia) have made the most
marked progress since 1924. Russia seems likely to become even
more important than at present. Australian production is largely
dependent on climatic conditions and the decrease in 1929 and 1930,
which was mainly due to subnormal rainfall in certain areas was
arrested in 1931, and production should reach a record level in

1932 according to preliminary reports. Continued progress is not
unlikely in the United States of America, where the sheep numbers
have advanced appreciably in recent years, and in the Union of
South Africa, where sheep numbers in 1931 were at a record level.
In Uruguay, steady development is also being registered, and this
may continue, in view of the relatively rapid advance in the last
few years, although the preliminary estimates for 1931 show some
reduction. As regards the remaining countries mentioned in the table,
no such substantial progress seems likely, although an upward trend in
production is observable.
( a ) Not available.
Including non-woolled sheep, the average yield per head throughout
the world on the basis of the 1929 clip is about 4\ lb. Improved sheep
of all types yield on an average about 7 lb. per head ; native woolled
sheep probably give as a rule between 3 lb. and 4 lb., but many
native sheep are non-woolled, and including these the average yield
of all native sheep may be computed at less than 1 lb. per head.
Although the published statistics seldom distinguish between the
various types of wool produced, it is possible to conclude, from the
available evidence, that the general quality has improved in recent
years. The finer wools represent a larger proportion of the total


production than in 1924, and this result has been achieved partly
because production in the merino-producing countries, namely
Australia, the Union of South Africa, and the United States, has
increased more than that of the countries producing the coarser
wools, and partly because the quality of the coarser wools in certain
producing areas has tended to become finer.
It is estimated that 40 per cent, of the world’s wool production is
of the merino type, 35 per cent, of the crossbred type and the
remainder of the carpet type. Empire countries produce mainly the
merino, and crossbred types, whereas the carpet type is produced to
an overwhelming degree outside the Empire. In twelve of the
principal producing countries, which probably account for about
90 per cent, of the world’s supplies of carding and combing wools,
it is estimated that merino wool has been progressing somewhat
faster than crossbred since 1924. The proportion of merino production
in those countries to the aggregate of merino and crossbred wools
has increased from about 50 per cent, in 1924 to about 54 per cent,
in 1930.
The chief factor affecting the world’s raw wool production during
the past seven years has been the growth of the sheep population.
Climatic causes and low prices, which may lead to less attention
being given to the flocks, may result in marked changes in the wool
output per sheep from year to year, but, in general, changes in
average production per head constitute a long-term factor in aggregate
wool production. Nevertheless, in estimating the future of wool
production, the possibility of improvement in the per capita produc-
tion cannot be ignored. The experience of Australia which, with the
same sheep population in 1930 as in 1891, produced about 50 per
cent, more wool than in the earlier year, may be repeated in other
countries. There is no doubt that the average production per sheep
in some countries is below what may yet be attained and a heavier
aggregate production in the future is possible, even if no further
increase in numbers occurs, provided that development is not hindered
by climatic or economic factors.
(iii) The Export Trade in Raw Wool.
The world exports of raw wool in recent years have shown a definite
upward tendency, reflecting the increase in production which has
already been referred to. Since 1924, when exports aggregated over




1,660 million lb., their volume has increased appreciably, a peak of
over 2,100 million lb. having been attained in 1927. Since then some
slight diminution has occurred.
Table 113 shows the annual exports of home-grown raw wool since
1924 from almost the whole of the exporting countries, and the
aggregate amounts may, therefore, be considered as representing the
volume of raw wool entering world trade although not necessarily
the amount going into consumption. No account is taken in the
table of the condition in which the wool is exported, but the great
bulk of the wool is exported in the grease and it is presumed that
no material change in the movement of the exports would be
effected by converting to a greasy basis such figures as relate to
washed, scoured and sliped wool. This conversion could not, in any
case, be effected for all countries, and the lack of uniformity in the
amount of the loss on scouring, etc., from country to country and
season to season and in the classification adopted in the trade statistics
are other difficulties in the way of an accurate computation on a
greasy basis. Except in the case of Persia, the figures in the table
relate to the calendar year. The movement of the annual exports
is illustrated in Diagram X.
In comparing the figures of production and exports it should
be borne in mind that the former are, for the most part, on a
" greasy ” basis, while the latter do not take account of the
condition in which the wool is exported. Moreover, the export
figures do not include either the trade of some of the very
small net-exporting countries, or the trade of any but a few of the
net-importing countries ; nor do they include an estimate of the
wool exported on the skin. But even without the adjustments
necessitated by these facts, all of which would tend to raise the figure
of world exports, it would appear that over one-half of the estimated
world production of raw wool enters world trade, the remainder
being consumed within the producing areas, especially in the United
States of America and the Soviet Union.
Between 1924 and 1927, the world trade in raw wool increased by
about 450 million lb. or 27 per cent. Since then the trend has been
less regular and a fall of about 140 million lb. in 1928 was followed by
a slight rise in 1929, which was maintained fairly well in 1930; for
despite general decreases in most exporting countries in that year there
were notable exceptions in the case of Australia, Uruguay and

Argentina. There was a slight fall of 67 million lb. or about 3 per
cent, in 1931 consequent almost entirely upon reduced shipments
from Australia and South Africa.
With the exception of the United States of America and the United
Kingdom, all the largest producers of improved wools cater mainly
for the export trade. As regards low wools, there is an extensive
local consumption. In the Soviet Union, for instance, the whole
clip is consumed within the countn 7 and in Turkey only a small
part of the production is exported. Relatively small price changes
have proved effective in limiting the supply forthcoming on the
world’s markets with the result that carpet wool has suffered less
from the fall in wool values than either of the other categories.
Low wools constitute a relatively small part of the world’s exports
of raw wool, and during the period under review they have shown
some tendency to decline in relative importance particularly since
1928. Table 114 shows the estimated proportion of low wools in
the world’s raw wool exports since 1924. The 1931 figures have not
been computed in view of the absence of figures for China which
supplies an important part of the carpet wool exports.
In recent years British Empire countries have furnished about
two-thirds of all the raw wool entering world trade although, it will
be recalled, they have produced less than one-half of the world
supply of that commodity. The disproportionate share of the

world’s wool trade enjoyed by Empire countries arises from the
fact that the raw wool entering world trade is to an overwhelming
extent carding and combing wool, i.e., of the merino and crossbred
types, and that these wools are for the most part produced in the
Empire.
There has been some increase during the period under review in
the share of Empire countries in the world’s wool trade, which has
not been accompanied by any marked change in the Empire’s share
of the world’s wool production. This is due either to the greater
domestic consumption of low wools in producing areas or to the holding
back of such wool, which has no doubt been encouraged by the
exceptionally unfavourable market conditions for that type of wool
that always rule during a prolonged period of low prices.

(e) Estimates of First National Bank of Boston, Buenos Aires Branch.
The serious decline in the physical volume of world trade which
has been in evidence in the case of several staple commodities in
recent years has not appreciably affected raw wool and, as a result,
abnormal stocks of this commodity do not appear to have accumulated


in the principal producing areas. In 1931 stocks of raw wool at
the end of the season in Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South
Africa and Argentina, the four principal producing countries supplying
the export trade, although appreciably above the average level of
preceding years, represented only a very small fraction of their
aggregate production. This fact is of prime importance in judging
the future prospects of the industry and undoubtedly points to wool
as being very favourably situated to take advantage of any upward
turn in world trade in general.
Table 115 shows annual figures of stocks of raw wool in Australia,
New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and Argentina since the
1925-26 season. It will be seen that stocks in New Zealand at June
30, 1931, which consisted almost entirely of crossbred wool, represented
nearly three-quarters of the aggregate reported stocks in these four
countries. Judging by this fact and by the recent heavy fall in the
export trade of low-wool producing countries, it seems probable that
such accumulation of stocks as has occurred in producing countries
consists largely of crossbred and carpet wools.
(iv) Prices of Raw Wool.
The violent fluctuations in raw wool prices that have marked the
post-war period had no parallel during the twenty-five years before
the war, and the heavy fall that has been in evidence since the spring
of 1928 has brought wool prices to the lowest level experienced since
the early 90’s of the 19th century.
A large part of the price-fall since the war has been due to the
rise in the value of money but generally speaking wool prices have
fluctuated more rapidly than the general commodity index. Crossbred
wool prices have shown wider fluctuations than either merino or
carpet wools and the crossbred wool price index at December, 1931,
was 53 (1909-13 = 100), while that of merino wool was 69, that of
carpet wool 95 and that of general commodities 106.
A detailed statement of raw wool prices since 1890 is given in
Appendix 111. Appendix IV gives an index of these prices and
Appendix V gives the commodity value index of raw wool for the
same period.
The heavy fall in wool prices in recent years has not yet had any
substantially adverse effect upon sheep numbers or wool production


nor has it resulted in the accumulation of abnormal stocks in the
principal producing areas supplying the export trade, taken as a
whole.
(v) Miscellaneous Animal Fibres.
Of the miscellaneous animal fibres entering into the wool
textile industry, mohair is by far the most important. The out-
look for the mohair-producer is not bright, as America —in the
past a considerable importer —is now practically self-sufficing,
and the European demand shows an appreciable diminution.
The lustre value of mohair has been discounted by competitive
artificial products, and fashion has not tended to increase its use,
while the present desire for cheapness rather than lasting value is an
obstacle to its adoption for furnishing fabrics and linings. In the
United Kingdom, there is no developing demand for mohair goods
such as that created by the automobile and cinema industries in
America, and mohair linings, which form a large part of the British
output, have during the last few years suffered keenly from the
competition of cheaper linings composed of artificial silk. Indeed,
the trend of fashion away from mohair is to an important extent due
to artificial silk.
The Government of the Union of South Africa has recently
appointed a Commission to enquire into the mohair industry and to
suggest a remedy for the diminution in the demand for mohair,
which is leading to a definite decline in production. The attempt
made in the United States of America to popularise mohair by the
establishment of a Mohair Institute for the purpose of promoting
the use of mohair goods has recently been followed by the establish-
ment of a similar body in the United Kingdom.* The importance
of such organisations lies in the fact that the future of mohair depends
largely on whether new uses can be found for it.
As regards the other miscellaneous fibres, little or no expansion is
taking place, judging from the export figures. The recorded exports
of both goats’ wool and camel hair from China are above the pre-war
level, but have shown no marked development in recent years. The
production of alpaca is apparently being well maintained but that of
the less important fibres, llama and vicuna, is markedly declining.
* The British Mohair Association was registered in 1931, “ to promote the
interests of persons carrying on the business of growing, dyeing, and finishing of
mohair....".


As regards foreign trade in the miscellaneous animal fibres, the
United Kingdom is by far the principal importer. Retained imports
of the United Kingdom have appreciably declined in comparison
with the pre-war period, particularly in the case of mohair, the
quantity retained in 1930 representing less than one-half of the
average for the period 1911-13. There were also appreciable reduc-
tions in the amount of alpaca and camel hair retained. British
Empire countries are still responsible for about one-half of all the
mohair entering world trade ; the exports of the other fibres come
almost entirely from foreign countries.
CONCLUSIONS.
There has been no exceptional increase in the sheep population or
the wool production of the world in recent years ; indeed, between
1928 and 1930, there appears to have been a small decrease in the
wool production. The year 1931, according to the partial estimates
at present available, probably witnessed an increase in production
over 1930 but, even so, it is not anticipated that the record level of
1928 will be appreciably, if at all, exceeded. British Empire countries
have maintained their share of the world’s sheep population at about
one-third, and their share of the world’s production of raw wool at
about one-half.
As regards the export trade, in which the share of British Empire
countries is over two-thirds of the world total, there has been, on the
whole, little variation since 1926 in the consignment of raw wool
from producing to manufacturing countries, and there would appear
to be no abnormally large accumulation of stocks of raw wool in the
principal exporting countries taken as a whole. At the end of the
1930-31 season, when stocks in certain of the principal producing
areas were higher than usual, they still formed only a very small part
of the aggregate annual production. Proposals to restrict the sales
or stabilise the prices of raw wool have been vigorously opposed,
with the result that the statistical position of wool can be regarded
as satisfactory when compared with that of a number of other
staple commodities.
As regards the general considerations concerning the demand
factors in respect of wool, it should be noted that there are no satis-
factory statistics of the wool-using population of the world. The
total population of the world since 1924 has progressively increased


at the average rate of about I*4 per cent, per annum, but whether
this corresponds with the annual increase of the wool-using population
or not, it is difficult to say. Moreover, even if a more precise know-
ledge of the increase were available it would be inconclusive as
indicating the development of demand, which is extremely elastic. A
period of severe and widespread economic depression generally results
in an immediate and substantial decrease in the demand for wool
through the postponement of the purchase of new garments and, in
consequence, wool prices generally tend to suffer, more quickly and
more acutely than commodity prices taken as a whole, but once the
lower price has been attained, consumption rapidly tends to regain its
previous level. Conversely, on account of the inelasticity of the wool
supply, an improvement in the general economic situation tends to
produce a relatively swift response in wool prices, and it may
accordingly be anticipated that wool will be one of the first com-
modities to benefit from any such improvement. The demand side
of the wool-growing industry will be fully considered in a later
Survey, which will treat of the imports of raw wool by the manu-
facturing countries, and the production of and international trade
in the semi-manufactured and finished products of the wool textile
industry.
