THE BAIN BRIDGE EXPEDITION
TO THE
SOUTHERN SEAS.
“1 believe the productiveness of our Dependencies could be
increased greatly by research/' —The Et. Hon. Lord Henry
Cavendish-Bentinck, M.P.
The object of the Bambridge Expedition to the
Southern Seas is to make a careful study of Papua, the
Solomons, and other little known islands which are
destined, through their size, wealth, and geographical
position, to play an important part in the history of the
British Empire.
Papua, which has an area of 300,000 square miles,
is the largest island in the world. The soil is excep-
tionally rich, and cocoanut palms reach maturity there
much earlier than in Ceylon or Malaya.
The Solomons have a land area of 15,000 square
miles, and were the first group to be discovered in the
Southern Seas.
The natural productions of these islands, which are
clothed with the densest tropical forest, are not yet
fully known, but gold, tin, copper, and other minerals
have been discovered.
The natives, who number about two millions, are
cannibals, but they are yielding to the humanizing
influences of Christianity. They present some of the
best raw material in the world jind, in the hands of an
able body of men, the most valuable results could be
obtained.
Mr. Bainbridge, who will be assisted by a competent
scientific staff, expects to obtain a great many new
specimens of plant, insect, bird and animal life, and
these he intends to present to national institutions.
The Anthropological work will be done by Mr.
Bainbridge, who will also write the record of the
expedition.


The Hon. John G. Jenkins, formerly Premier of
South Australia, who presided at Mr. Bainbridge’s
Christmas' lecture before the Royal Colonial Institute on
Friday, December 29th, 1916, said:
“ I am sure that all present are pleased with the able anti
interesting lecture to which they nave listened. Personally it is
of special interest to me, as I have had the opportunity of visiting
most of the islands described by Mr. Bainbridge.
“ Mr. Bainbridge is well known as a lecturer, and his thorough
knowledge, of the different parts of the Empire fits him for the
educational work he is doing, and I wish there were more men
like him who could speak in different parts of the Empire to
make the inhabitants of each part better acquainted with the
other parts.
“ I can fully endorse what Mr. Bainbridge said about the
productiveness of the soil in these Southern islands, islands that
are the natural home of cocoa palms, bananas, and sugar cane,
the production of which should be encouraged in order to prevent
the necessity of ever again depending upon Germany and Austria
for our sugar supplies.
“ I am specially interested in the proposed expedition to
Papua, and feel sure that the Empire will be enriched by the
valuable knowledge obtained by this, scientific expedition. I wish
Mr. Bainbridge every success in his enterprise, and trust he will
be enabled to carry out his duties successfully and return safely
to give the public the advantage of hearing more about these
Southern Islands.”
THE ET. HON. D. LLOYD GEOEGE, P C., M.P.
(Prime Minister of England).
“We have been taught by the War the real value of the
Empire, and one of the first duties of statesmanship in the
future will be to take all measures which are necessary to aid
in the development of the stupendous resources of the Empire.
That ought to be our special care and special pride, as it will
be undoubtedly our special security.
“In future we have decided that it is the business of
statesmanship in Great Britain, as well as in the lands beyond
the seas, to unite the Empire in closer bonds of interest, of trade,
of commerce, of business, and of general intercourse, in conference.
“ This great Empire has infinite resources of wealth in minerals,
food production, and timber, and in every commodity needful for
the aid of man, and it is obvious that it is an advantage not
merely to the particular countries where these products come
from, but to every other part in the Empire, including the
United Kingdom, that these commodities should be developed to
the utmost. It enriches, it strengthens, and it binds together the
Empire as a whole.”
SIE CHAELES LUCAS, K.C.M.G., K.C.8.. C.B.
(Chairman of the Council of the Eoyal Colonial Institute.)
“ I have been told of the presentation by yon of a gold medal
to the boy who wrote the best essay on the subject of your
Christmas Lecture, and have been most interested in hearing of it.
“ May I, as Chairman of the Council, thank you for this kindly
and most useful action on your part, stimulating the interest of
the coming generation in our Overseas Empire. It is a pleasure
to read that the Eoyal Colonial Institute was the scene of the
presentation, and that the generous donor has been lecturing in our
name and on our behalf.
“I hope your expedition to the Southern Seas will be
successful.”

THE RT. HON. WALTER LONG, P.C., M.P.
(Secretary of State for the Colonies).
“It is not so very long since we talked about our Overseas
possessions as our ‘ Colonial J possessions. I have rather an
affection for that word. It is old-fashioned. But it will not do
to-day. bike many other old-fashioned words it was badly abused.
It was used constantly as a term rather of contempt. Let us
admit the truth. There were in this country those who failed
altogether to realize the future of our Overseas Dominions; the
great part they were destined to play in the future of the Empire.
And there are some still who are blind to the great possibilities
of the British Empire. There are some still who, when they
are talking of the future of the British Empire, or when they
are talking of the end of this war, concentrate all their attention
on Europe, and the British Empire is seen from this comparatively
narrow standpoint. The British Empire extends the world over,
and some of its greatest possibilities are to be found in some
of its most distant parts. Only those will wisely act for the
future of the Empire who will look widely over it, and who, when
they are thinking of its future, will realize its greatness and
its strength and the difficulty and dangers that are inseparable
from its: greatness and its strength.
“We are called upon to-day to realize that we must make t.bi«
Empire what it ought to be —the greatest, the most closely united,
the most self-reliant, the most progressive, the most peace-loving
Empire in the world. If it is not made that, it will be because
our people refuse to realize facts as they are and to see for
themselves the immense potentialities which are contained in the
distant parts of our vast possessions.”
To Whom It May Concern.
“ This is to certify that Mr. Oliver Bainbridge has kindly
offered to collect specimens of natural history for the British
Museum (Natural History) during his forthcoming scientific
expedition to the islands of the Southern Seas.
“ Any facilities that may be given to Mr. Bainbridge in
furtherance of his efforts to benefit the British Museum (Natural
History) will be gratefully appreciated by the authorities of that
institution.”
C. E. EAGAN.
Secretary, British Museum (Natural History).
To the Friends and Correspondents of the Smithsonian Institution .
“Mr. Oliver Bainbridge is contemplating an expedition to the
islands of the Southern Seas, and has kindly offered to take this
opportunity to collect Zoological, Mineralogical and other specimens
for the United States National Museum.
“Any facilities and assistance which you may be able to render
him in this connection will be highly appreciated by the
Smithsonian Institution.”
R. RATHBURN,
Secretary.
To Whom It May Concern.
“ Oliver Bain bridge, Esquire, a distinguished Author and
Lecturer, is visiting certain Islands in the South Seas.
‘He has kindly offered to collect for our Museum certain
ethnological material, and we heartily commend him to those
with whom he may come in contact.”
