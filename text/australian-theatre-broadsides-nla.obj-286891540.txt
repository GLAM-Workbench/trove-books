Mr. S A. Palmer, 184 Pitt-street, Sydney.
j Dear Sir, — lam glad to testify to the invaluable qualities of
Vitadatio, Some thirteen month ago I had to consult a Melbourne
doctor re a severe attack of Rheumatism. The doctor perscribed
for me, but medicine gave me no permanent relief. I suffered
acute pain for months, and was unable to sleep for more than an
hour or two during the night. Knowing several of your clients
who had been cured by Vitadatio I resolved to give it a trial, and
am happy to say that for the last three months I have been perfect ly
gree from pain, and have no hesitation in attributing my restored
health to Vitadatio. I shall be very glad to give personal cor-
sroboration to the above if necessary.
Yours faithfully,
