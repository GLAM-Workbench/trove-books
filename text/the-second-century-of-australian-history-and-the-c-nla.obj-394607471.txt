THE SECOND CENTURY
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY,
AND THE
CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES MOST LIKELY TO INFLUENCE IT.
The Inaugural Address of the Fifth General Conference of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church, delivered by the retiring President,
the Rev. Joseph H. Fletcher, May, 1888.
HE triennium since our last General
Conference has been marked, I think,
by steady growth in the Wesleyan
Methodist Churches of Australia and.
New Zealand, rather than by any sudden
increase of our numbers or any remark-
able expansion of resources. The Jubilee
of our Fijian Mission was held, and its
deeply interesting incidents have long-
been in your possession. The arrange-
ments made by the Conference for a
modified Model Deed, suited to present circumstances,
have been duly carried out, and four Deeds have been
prepared —one for each of the four principal Conferences
—three of which, I believe, are now in operation. The
deputation appointed in the interests of peace to visit
Tonga went down soon after the Conference, and has been
followed by another recently. Their reports have been
given to the colonial Conferences; but I regret to say that
the difficulties of re-union seem undiminished. Speaking for
the Conference of New South Wales, I can affirm that no
subject within my recollection has received so much and
such ungrudging attention as this one. Our anxiety for
the restoration of peace has been unanimous and intense.
If our Divine Master would be pleased to guide this
Conference to the right measures for bringing about a union


that will not be premature or compulsory, and therefore
void and vain, our thankfulness to God will be very great.
The most important event of the triennium has un-
doubtedly been the completion of the first century of
British settlement in Australia. It has led many thoughtful
and sagacious minds to consider what will probably be the
Australia of 1988. One of the ablest of our critics (London
Spectator, 28th January) has given us the following fore-
cast: —“ The early Americans, whose influence is only just
dying out, were men of austere tempei', who led on an
ungrateful soil lives of permanent hardship. They had to
fight the sea, the snow, the forests, the Indians, and their
own hearts, and did fight them all, if not with complete
success, at least with persistent hardness. The Australians,
we conceive, with a more genial and altogether warmer
climate, without Puritan traditions, with wealth among
them from the first, and with a habit of communion with
Europe, will be a softer, though not weaker, people—fonder
of luxury, and better fitted to enjoy art, with an apprecia-
tion of beauty which the Americans have never shown, and
with not only a love for literature, but a power of producing
it in original forms. They will, in short, desire easier and
larger lives than the Americans do, will be less persistently
laborious, and will feel—we note this already in Australians
almost as strongly as in Californians —a sort of worship for
their climate. The note of discontent which penetrates
the whole American character will be absent, and if not
exactly happier, they will be more at ease. All Australian
development will be affected by that difference, and as they
cease to be British, German, and Irish, the men of the new
type which will gradually be born —the distinctive and
separate Australians—will be as distinguishable in England
as the Americans are distinguishable also from them. The
typical Australian will be a sunnier man.” Our critic
further affirms that there is every reasonable probability
that in 1988 Australia will be peopled by fifty millions of
such people. This oracle is, of course, provocative of much
criticism. I quote it only to suggest the question, What in
all probability will this “ sunnier man” care for Methodism,
and what can we do as Methodists in the work of producing
him ? It is surely permissible here to say that Methodism
in England has been an important factor in producing what
has been called its “new democracy,” and which competent
observers declare to be not atheist, but Christian, It is also


to recall quite a recent event when I remind you of the
honourable place allotted to Methodism in the centenary
celebrations of the great American nation. And you know
without any necessity of my demonstrating the fact that
in the noble Dominion of Canada Methodism holds no
second place in evangelistic efforts, in spiritual life, in the
University, in the Senate, and in the public press. Looking
on, then, to the commanding presence of that “sunnier
man” that is to be in Australia, we ought to feel with no
little enthusiasm our parental possibilities in relation to him.
Unless the great lessons of history are in this instance
unavailing, this coming Australian nation will emerge from
an atmosphere teeming with stormy elements. For that is
true of all strong nations, as of heroic men, which the
Quaker poet writes who saw the volcanic fires that went to
the making of his own great republic —
Never on custom’s oilkl grooves
The world to a higher level moves,
But grates and grinds with friction hard
On granite boulder and flinty shard;
The heart must bleed before it feels,
The pool be troubled before it heals;
Ever by losses the right must gain,
Every good have its birth of pain;
And graces and charities feel the fire
Wherein the sins of the age expire;
The fiend still rends, as of old he rent
The tortured body from which he went.
If this forecast of perfectness through suffering be correct,
the outlook is one of the deepest interest to us. Australia
is not only to many of you the place of birth, or of con-
version to God—that second and greater birth in the history
of the soul—but it is to us all our country, our home.
For this dear land we have lived and mean to live, and here
we expect our dust to lie until
The cited dead
Of all past ages to the general doom
Shall hasten, such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
But there is another reason. Now already “ other men
laboured, and we are entered into their labours.” The
Methodist Church has held an honourable place in the history
of these colonies from their very beginning, and we should
burn with holy ambition and pray with patriotic passion
that this honour may be still continued to us. And I
propose to-day to ask your indulgence while I treat as


concisely as I can this question, What was the secret of
the success of early Methodism ? The answer. I think,
will apply also to another question, How can Methodism
succeed in the highest degree in the coming century ?
The success of early Methodism was primarily spiritual,
bringing men to salvation through Christ; but there
were some notable peculiarities in its manner of pre-
senting “ the truth as it is in Jesus.” And I seem to
see, first and foremost, that our fathers boldly and
constantly 'preached a Gospel of Certainty. We have heard
in modern times the strange announcement of a “ Gospel of
Atheism.” One would think that a Gospel of Pestilence,
preached by an apostolate of skeletons to the starving
remnant of a beseiged city, could scarcely be a more hideous
spectre than a gospel whose tidings are that our Father
in heaven is dead, and all His children are orphans? But
men nowadays play daring tricks with sacred language.
A Gospel of Doubt has a very strange sound in the mouths
of Christians, and yet was tolerated by many sincere and
godly persons a century ago, on the greatest and most
precious fact of the Gospel—our own authentic and certain
possession of pardon and sonship through faith in Christ
Jesus. It was only after a struggle of thirteen years, and
much obstinate fighting to the very last, that the Wesleys
read the text aright—“ Because ye are sons God hath sent
forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba
Father.” They then rushed forth and preached this
certainty with all the ardour of men who have made a
great beneficent discovery, and would have all the world
instantly to know it. This certainly revolutionised their
own history, and soon revolutionised the history of the
churches in England and America. It may be that scepticism
in our time has attained unprecedented dimensions. But
scepticism is like smoke—a little goes a very long way, and
soon attains very great dimensions, though the softest breaths
of heaven can chase it away. The more doubt exists to-day
the more precious is a true and tried certainty. But the
most natural certainty, the most influential, the most
imperishable under severest trials —yes, the only Divine
certainty given to man—is this: “Hope maketh not ashamed,
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost who was given unto us.” The Gospel which con-
vincingly proclaims that certainty will never lose its charm.


Secondly, I seem to see, as a cause of the success of early
Methodism, that its preachers proclaimed a Gospel of
Brotherhood. And as the certainty was specifically Christian
certainty, having this peculiarity, that it arose out of the
witness of the Spirit to the believer’s adoption, so also
this brotherhood was Christian brotherhood, having this
peculiarity: “One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are
brethren.” Its basis was a common relationship to the one
Lord and Saviour. Consequently, the soul enriched with its
new certainty was not a lonely lustre in a wilderness of
night, but found itself one of a multitude of stars, bound
together by the same attraction, borrowing light from the
same centre, and massing their united splendours to brighten
the dark world below. This idea of brotherhood was one of
the new ideas which Christianity gave to the world. Its
newness was both in its largeness and in its power. Other
brotherhoods, though not always weak, have been always
narrow. They were the ripples which never passed beyond
the brim of the lake or pool in which they rose; but this
was to be the majestic tide wave which, obedient to heavenly
influences, rolls its unmeasured fulness upon every shore.
There was the novelty of its largeness, overleaping all dis-
tinctions of race, of rank, of culture, or of age; and there
was the novelty of its motive —“that ye love one another as
I have loved you.” The enormous social power which early
Christianity exerted upon the Roman Empire was a silent
power, like that of the sunbeam which without a sound
uplifts an ocean of water every day into the atmosphere,
stimulates everything that lives, and twists and sways
towards itself the hugest piles of masonry or of iron which
man can put together. Now, this new and silent force was
that of Christian brotherhood.
Mr. Lecky, in his History of European Morals, though
not disposed to give too much praise to the Christian Church,
does her justice here. It was this relationship felt, that
made slavery among Christians first of all unthinkable, then
abominable, then impossible. Everywhere to-day in the
civilised world men are trying to embody this idea of
brotherhood borrowed from Christianity, but everywhere
their efforts are hindered by the narrowness of space or by
the weakness of motive that considers the interests of one
particular class or caste only and abhors all others. So of
old, the Greek despised the barbarian, the Jew cursed the
Gentile, and the stern Roman pitilessly crushed them both.


No Christian idea is seen at once to be so reasonable, yet
none is so difficult permanently to embody in society. No
Christian idea is so liable to abuse by the insincere, by the
idle, by the motley tribe of dreamers. It may take all the
current century to educate men up to this idea, but when-
ever it becomes a living force, penetrating the entire life of
Christian Churches, a hundred social problems will be solved
at once, and a hundred cancerous villanies that are now con-
suming the life even of Christian nations, flourishing under
the protection of Christian laws, and sanctioned by the names
of professedly Christian men, will swiftly disappear. How
early and how emphatically was the idea of Christian
brotherhood asserted in early Methodism. Some of our
hymns seem yet almost a hundred }'ears too soon to be sung
in the congregation. Our strength and our prosperity
during this second century of Methodism in Australia will
greatly depend, I venture to affirm, on the degree in which
we and our successors are wise and strong to carry into
worship, into business, and into social life our Master’s
maxim, “ One is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are
brethren.”
But a third great characteristic of early Methodism, and
cause of its success, was that it preached a Gospel of Personal
Christian Service. As the certainty was specifically Christian
through the witness of the Spirit of Christ, and the brother-
hood was specifically Christian through the new relationship
as children of God through Christ, so the service was
specifically Christian through their new obligation to Christ:
“ Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price.” The
new member of the brotherhood did not find himself an
interesting only child, born to be admired; or an infantile
nonentity who, by stress of much motherhood, might here-
after possibly become a man; or an aristocratic superfluity,
born to be waited on; but a serviceable recruit for immediate
drill in the barracks or immediate service in the field, or a
ministering sister who was not at all in a hurry “ to sit and
sing herself away to everlasting bliss” while there was so
much sin and woe and want in the world. The ideal Church,
as it appeared during the first Christian Pentecost, was a
body, in which every part is ministrant, indispensable, and
responsive; or it was a commonwealth, in which every
citizen has his weapon, his place in the phalanx, and his
voice and vote in the assembly; or it was a family, in


which every child knows his rights, and where the smallest
Protestant is allowed to assert them; or it was a priesthood,
such as the great primate, St. Peter, describes in his first
Epistle, and which his professed successor, the Pope, could
not to-day produce in Rome—a priesthood embracing all the
Christians to whom the Apostle wrote, and who he says
were “ a holy priesthood”—nay, also “ a royal priesthood,” I
need not remind you how fully this spirit pervaded early
Methodism. This ideal of personal, harmonious service not
only lives along almost every line of our Hymn-book, but
speaks with antique dignity in Mr. Wesley’s Rules of the
Societies. They might seem to anticipate that modern form
of atheism which charges Christianity with not attaching
sufficient importance to the duties of this life, for these old
rules put the duty of doing good to men’s bodies, “ by giving
food to the hungry, by clothing the naked, by visiting or
helping them that are sick or in prison,” before the duty of
doing good to their souls. We regard it as a most
encouraging sign that English Methodism is renewing her
youth—that while on the one hand she has profound thinkers
like Rev. William Arthur and Dr, Ballinger, familiar with
the highest problems of philosophy and science, and scholars
like Dr. Pope and Dr, Moulton, able to appropriate the
best scholarship of Germany, we have also such splendid
instances of applied Christianity as the mission in Liverpool
of my old fellow-student Charles Garrett, and the thirteen
homes, with their seven hundred friendless children, under
the care of Dr. Stephenson, and now the bold and statesman-
like experiment of Hugh Price Hughes and Mark Guy
Pearse and their allies in London. Must we not follow in
the same direction if we are to be represented in the sunnier
Christian Churches of 1988 ? Christian service to be com-
plete must he personal service, for there is that in every man
which is not transferable—his personal influence, his indi-
viduality of place, of thought, of speech, and of work. We
sometimes suffer by not allowing enough room for what are
called eccentric men, who cannot run exactly in the old
grooves. How much did early Methodism owe to such !
The eccentricity of such men as Hodgson Casson and William
Dawson and the ever-memorable Gideon Ouseley, and in
humbler life of Silas Told, of Samuel Hick, and Jonathan
Saville, and in America of Peter Cartwright, was often a
manifestation of genius, that marvellous endowment which
enables some men, as it were by intuition and unconscious


of process, to do what ordinary men accomplish slowly and
imperfectly, train them as you may. But genius in these
men, and their noble but almost forgotten companions, took
the transcendent form of special skill and success in winning
souls to Christ. Eccentric men are often like crooked sticks.
They are neglected until they are wanted for some position
where special strain requires special strength, or as when
the housewife, looking for a mighty log to keep the hearth
aglow all through the winter night, chooses one of them,
well knowing that though it may be hard to kindle the close-
grained, unshapely block, yet when once the fire has reached
its knotty heart it will burn itself away in flame, and its
very dust will be fire. The silence which has crept into our
public worship instead of the soul-stirring responses of earlier
days; the decline of our class-meetings—in consequence, I
think, partly of the rarity of gifted laymen and laywomen
as class-leaders, and partly on account of the unwholesome
reserve which it is now the fashion to throw around one’s
personal Christian experience—and the paralysis of the
prayer-meeting, all demonstrate the necessity not only of
new power, but of new methods, if the Australians of 1988
are to be much indebted to Wesleyan Methodism. We need
vitality enough, not only to endure the clash and the crash of
the years before us, but even to gain by them, as the art of
navigation has gained by the rude manners of the ocean,
until ships have towered up into mighty castles of the sea,
which carry the population of a whole village at once, and
keep their appointed times with almost the punctuality of
the stars they steer by. We sometimes hear it said that we
need a revival of old Methodism. Indeed we do not! The
Methodism which within half a century of its birth was
filling England not only with new churches, but with new
charities, was not an old, but a new Methodism. It is old
Methodism, stiff, querulous, and slow to adapt itself to new
circumstances, that we want to speedily embalm in good
books and pious epitaphs, while a new and a yet newer
Methodism, flexible, beneficent, and bold, moves through the
world, full of new ideas, but setting them to the old music—
Oh, for a trumpet voice on all the world to call,
To bid their hearts rejoice in Him who died for all.
And lastly, I think the success of early Methodism may
be traced to the clearness and persistency with which its
preachers set forth a Gospel of Ghristian Perfectness —that


is, the perfectness of a Christian as a Christian. Here we
stand on an old battle-field, strewn with many a spent
weapon. But somehow the hope of the possible perfectness
of a Christian’s love to the Lord Jesus here and now, and
of a corresponding elevation of character and life above
commonplace Christianity, have been so built into the
foundation of Methodism that he who pulls one up will
certainly pull the other down. Opposition to such a hope
is remarkable when you remember that never was perfection
in work of all kinds so much required as to-day. The
instruments both of war and of peace must be made perfect,
so far as the most exact mathematics, aided by the
microscope, and committed to the most carefully trained
handicraft, can make them. And the demand, being made, is
supplied. Myriads of cannon and rifles are as perfect to-day
for the purposes of destruction as they can at present be made.
In every mill and factory, in every hospital and college, in
every farm and shop, nay, in every home, however humble,
the perfect inventions of modem science are common and
indispensable. And the moment that the perfectness of
yesterday is surpassed by a higher perfectness of to-day the
old implement gives place to the new, and then the new to
the newer, and that in its turn to the newest. Now, perfect
work is impossible without a perfect love to the work or to
the Master or both. But both these inspirations reach
unmeasured intensity in the wholly devoted Christian.
Again, if we pass from man’s work to God’s work, how incom-
parable is God’s work in its perfection! It is infinitely
varied, but it is always effective, and disdaining the touch
of human art either in its use or its beauty. And does the
Divine Spirit, who every spring “ renews the face of the
earth,” filling it with countless forms of the most perfect
grace until the broad face of the old Nature-mother smiles
as if some great wave of beauty had overleaped the barriers
of heaven, and scattered its spray on the earth in living
flowers —does this greatest Artist, who delights in perfect-
ness, stay His hand only when He is producing a Christian?
I will not believe it. But here we can appeal to large and
familiar experience. The Christian perfectness taught by
the early Methodists was regarded by them as eminently
practical, producible, and serviceable. It was not always
introspective and self-asserting, but it was always a music to
be sung out by the sick-bed, in the workshop, and by the
fireside. It was an energy to be converted into work as soon


as born, as the silent, invisible force of steam is shut at once
into the cylinder, and has set a hundred wheels running
before it clothes itself in mist and dies. To discuss the
nature of light is the luxury of few, but to enjoy the beati-
tudes of light is for all things that live. So while theologians
have been discussing the true doctrine of perfect love to
Christ, or pronouncing it unattainable, millions of little
children have found the fair white pearl, and have flown
home to heaven to lay it at the feet of the children’s dearest
Friend, the Lord Jesus ; and thousands of unlettered men
and women have displayed it in the most immovable faith,,
in the most beautiful patience, in the sweetest charity, and
then on those tranquil deathbeds to which death never came,
and which seem to fulfil our poet’s prayer —
Like Moses to Thyself convey,
And kiss my raptured soul away.
Surely I speak to-day to many who know these things to
be true. And I seem to see special reasons why we should
treasure this precious ideal, and renew our efforts to embody
it solidly in our consciousness and character, as well as in
our public teaching. I will give the smallest reason first.
This doctrine seems almost the only one which now
differentiates Methodism from its sister Churches. In
doctrine and in government all the Churches have wonder-
fully approached each other during the last forty years.
Watch-nights, which were once considered by Churchmen as
dangerous to morality, are now common in the decorous
services of the Church of England; Presbyterians have
been heard to commend itinerancy; Congregationalists
have longed for the class-meeting; and Methodists have been
heard to say, “Oh, that we had bishops!” Even Calvinism
now for the most part lies like a massive boulder in the bed
of a river, never seen except in very dry weather. But there
is not a favourite biography in all Methodist literature in
which the doctrine of perfect love to God is not conspicuous,
nor has there ever been a great soul-stirring preacher in
Methodist pulpits who has not been at his best with
“ expositions of light and applications of thunder” when his
theme was entire sanctification received by faith in the
atoning blood of Christ. The place of theology in Methodism
has always been that of the laboratory in the workshop. It
has been characteristically a working theology, a theology
of salvation. And the doctrine of the sin-cleansing blood
has been so linked with the experience of the soul-converting


power that the Methodist Church without its songs and
sermons and prayers, inspired by the hope of Christian
perfect love, would be like an old English garden without
its roses. There was no doctrine for which John Wesley
suffered more controversial punishment than this; and yet
in his Plain Account of Christian Perfection we have the
marrow of Methodism compacted, revised, and revised and
asserted again and again for more than fifty years. The
union of the ideal and the actual here found a conspicuous
example in Mr. Wesley’s “ designated successor,” as Mr,
Tyerman calls him, and who needs no academic designation
to distinguish him—Fletcher of Madeley. It does not seem
that either earlier controversy or later criticism has in any
degree abated the* impression of the marvellous sanctity,
nobility, and beauty of his character. But he only lived
what he taught, and in his last Chech to Antinomianism
we have surely the best exposition of the Methodist doctrine
of Christian perfectness now extant. But we can come
nearer home. There still linger among us veterans who saw
John Hunt, and remember the early days of the Fijian
Mission. To us who never saw or heard him, his character,
as we trace it in his biography, acts like the bones of Elisha
when a dead body was laid thereon, and which stung a
corpse into resurrection. But when we bring together John
Hunt’s life and John Hunt’s letters on entire sanctification,
we seem to see cause and effect, and we can trace the effect
burning onwards into that great Fijian Pentecost of 1845,
of which Mr. Hunt wrote: —“ The mats of the chapel were
wet with the tears of the communicants at the table of the
Lord, and in many instances the ministers were scarcely
able to minister because of the glory of the Lord,” I can
imagine nothing worse to happen to us than any successful
attempt to bring our creed down to the level of our
experience. We may be laggards in the race, and that
may be our misfortune, but traitors we will never be. The
shame of failure we can bear; the shame of falsehood to our
convictions we cannot bear.
Christianity all through its history challenges the fiercest
criticism by its bold declaration that it is the instru-
ment of superhuman power. Paul himself would have been
ashamed of the Gospel if, even in Rome, the iron brain and
hand of the strongest political tyranny that ever mastered
the world, he could not have asserted it to be “ the power


of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.” If God
is with you, what do ye more than others ? is a reasonable
question. Yet there is much in our times to make us pause,
if not with dread, yet with deep anxiety—not, indeed, of the
final issue, but of our own capability to contribute to that
issue. The Gorgon presence of atheism, the Arctic chill of
religious indifferentism, the growing passion to make amuse-
ment the chief business of life, the hard and cruel
competition in business, and the utter weariness of life
which all these things together generate, are certainly telling
against the attendance on public worship, and thinning the
congregations in many a large city church once regularly
filled, and even overflowing, every Sabbath Day. And we
know that this is but a symptom of the Word of God
neglected and the throne of grace forsaken in many a home.
The blind optimism which sees only the pleasant side of
things, and the weak pessimism which is always mourning
that “Ichabod” is being written everywhere, are both
unchristian. As in Jewish history “ Ichabod” was but the
mistaken utterance of a weak and frightened woman, and
by no means prophetic, for the feeble Eli was already being
superseded by the mighty Samuel, so it is still. There is
no such thing as the glory departing from churches which
proclaim and strive to fulfil a Gospel of Christian certainty,
of Christian brotherhood, of personal Christian service, and
of Christian perfectness through the perfecting grace of
Christ’s own Spirit, and which also proclaim a Gospel of
Urgency, which, knowing no second probation, no supple-
mentary Gospel, and knowing no purgatory but the precious
blood of Christ, now and here only accessible, not only burn
with zealous charity to rescue men from a terrible hereafter,
but to lead them into the present heaven of “ the Kingdom
of God within them.” Our position is undoubtedly one of
danger if our great Captain has no reserves to bring up into
this battle-field of the world in which, if He reigns at all,
“ He must reign,” not asking the permission of His enemies.
The Rev. Win. Arthur, in his Tongue of Fire —book to
be mentioned ever with thanks to God—has truly said:
“To-day more by far is necessary to carry into the mind of
the multitude a clear conviction that it is the * hand of
God’ than was necessary in other ages. When men saw
few wonders from natural science they readily ascribed each
wonder to Divine agency; but now that they are accustomed
to see scientific wonders daily, moral wonders must swell


beyond all pretext of natural explanation before they are
felt to be from God.” We accept the difficult, the glorious
situation! The Church will see, because it must see, far
more memorable Pentecosts than its history has yet
recorded in order to fulfil its mission in the world. We may
not ourselves behold that greater impulse, but we must
labour to prepare the way for it; and when all things are
ready no man will be able to stay or hinder its arrival. No
doubt we have often walked upon the shore, and have
grown weary of the long, monotonous wastes of sand, and
have noticed how the tiny pools are multiplied in the rocky
hollows, where only the very smallest fish can swim, and
the boats are helplessly aground on a dull wilderness of
mud. But as we lobk some insignificant ripples are moving
on the sand like pulses of an infant life struggling into
birth. Then playful wavelets encroach on the territory of
dryness, and race like children over the shore; then we pass
on, and are busy with other things, and forget. But
while we were occupied elsewhere the ocean has come up in
his might, and the tiny pools have joined the great waters,
and the smooth monotonous sands are ridged with foam and
breaker, and the boats, released from durance, have spread
their sails and passed to other lands; and everywhere is the
fulness, the majesty, and the irresistible mastery of the
sounding seas. Now, this is no weak fancy, bred of man’s
fallacious hopes; it comes to us from the greatest poet and
the greatest prophet of the old world, who nearly three
millenniums ago declared, “ They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.” And
if we faithfully do our part along with the other Churches
of the Lord Jesus—and you know well that the Gospel of
the early Methodists was a Gospel of Catholicity—if we
faithfully fulfil our work in preparing for the greater Pente-
cost yet to be, we may hope to have many spiritual children
among the millions which, if God will, shall in another
century fill Australia with “a softer though not a weaker
race.” And in the great assemblies of that better time voices
will be heard declaring of us what we to-day declare of our
good and faithful forefathers—" Other men laboured, and we
are entered into their labours.”
