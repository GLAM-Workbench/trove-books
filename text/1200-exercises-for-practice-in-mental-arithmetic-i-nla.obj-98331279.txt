MAGIC SQUARES.
The formation of Magic Squares is an old and interesting amusement.
A series of numbers is so arranged in a square that their sums, taken
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, are the same.
The sum in a magic square of the third order is 15, of the fourth order
34, of the fifth order 65, of the sixth order 111, of the seventh order 175,
as shown in the examples printed below.
In the last square, for instance, all the numbers from 1 to 49 are used;
their total is 1225, and this divided by 7 gives 175 for each column, or
row, or diagonal.
In this square the numbers from 8 to 32
inclusive have been so arranged that their
sums in every row, in every column, and in
each diagonal are the same, viz. ICO.
