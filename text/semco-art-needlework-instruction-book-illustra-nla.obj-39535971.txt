Embroidery as an Art
URING the recent Semco Exhibition oj Art
Needlework the realization that the Woman
fiy of Australia can hold her own in the needle-
[|a==afie!l craft world of to-day Was fully demonstrated
in the numerous exquisite and beautifully embroidered linens
exhibited, and the k een interest taken in the dainty art of
Slitchery and Embroidery.
In an age so sorely driven both by economic necessity
and by the restless movement of the modern mind, the
question arises, ‘‘ Is embroidery an art too purposeless and
trivial to deserve to live, except in the hands of a few
enthusiasts and people of leisure?” For those who Value
craftsmanship at all there can be only one answer: We
cannot afford to let it go; we want the training and we
Want the finished work ; and as a means of beautifying
the home and of adding to the general cheerfulness of life,
embroidery hardly has a rival among the handicrafts.
An artist once described embroidery as ‘‘The most domestic,
delicate and charming of all handicrafts. ” There are few
who Would contest this pronouncement. This book is
intended for the help of those who are of the same opinion
and who wish to see embroidery lake the place it deserves
among the creative activities of the country.

MOUNT MELLICK.
MOUNT MELLICK. -This work originated in Ireland, and most
of the earlier work introduced the Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle, as
well as other flowers and fruits, into the design; but the stitchery
is now so popular that it is by no means confined to these subjects.
Many modern handsome designs lend themselves to this embroidery.
The feature of Mount Mellick is the variety of stitches that are
employed in working flowers, etc., that constitute the design (see
design J 411). No eyelets or open w'ork are used in this embroidery:
lace stitches may be introduced, but material must not be cut away
from underneath. Mount Mellick looks best worked either on Satin
Jean or good Linen in different sized threads, using the heavier thread
for outlining and solid work, the fine for veining and filling stitches.
Stitches mostly used are: —Stem Stitch, Snail Trail, Divided Satin
Stitch, Raised Satin Stitch, Flat Satin Stitch, Overcast Satin Stitch,
Long and Short Stitch, or Indian Filling, Seed Stitch, Lazy Daisy or
Barley Stitch, Cable Plait, Cable Chain, Back Stitch, Lattice. Bullion
Stitch. French Knots. Long and Short Buttonhole. Shell Edge.
Couching. Oyster Stitch, Blanket Stitch, Padding and Filling Stitch,
Lace Stitches, Chain Stitch. Plain and Fancy Buttonholing, Plain and
Fancy Feather Stitches, Thorn Stitch. Darning Stitch. Plain and
Fancy Herringbone, Braid Stitch. Fish-bone Stitch. Directions for
working any of these stitches are to be found in “Semco” Instruction
Books. Nos. 1,2, and 4.
(1) Feather Stitch is much used in plain needlework, and in Fancy
work for veining, and also filling small leaves, outlining, etc. In
single feather stitch it is best to have a centre line, which must not
be lost sight of throughout the pattern. Bring the needle up on the
line, make a buttonhole loop by putting the needle in slantwise to
the right of the centre, and bringing it out on the line. Draw it out
Semco Art Needlework.


over the working thread in the usual way,
until stitch is in place. Make a similar
stitch at the left-hand side, again bringing
the needle out on centre line a little lower
down than point at which it came out
before.
(2) Thorn Stitch is worked the same way
as Feather Stitch, the difference being the
right-hand side loop is sewn down with
French knot instead of the plain stitch,
(3) Chain Stitch too may be used for
cither outlining or filling. Bring the
needle up on line that is to be covered.
Hold thread down under thumb of left
hand, put needle in at place at which it
came out before and bring it out some
two or three or more threads lower
down the line. Hold the working
thread down as long as possible, and
keep the needle above it while it is drawn out over the loop thus
made. Still hold the working thread down on the line with the
thumb, put the needle down again at the place at which it last
came out; that is, inside the loop; bring out a few threads lower down;
every loop must be exactly the same size. The reverse of the work
should be precisely like back stitch.
(4) Cable Chain makes a good outline
for stems, leaves, etc. Bring the needle
up on line, form loop with thread by
twisting it under thread brought up, so
that the working end of thread (that is,
the under thread of loop) comes out on
the right-hand side. Then take up with
needle a small portion of materia! inside
loop; before drawing needle through pull
thread that forms loop firmly round
needle; pull needle through and repeat,
making each loop or chain same size.
(5) Fish Bone—Bring needle up at line,
put down on left side some three or
four threads from line, bring up at the
same distance from line on right side.
Make two firm buttonhole stitches into
left-hand stitch: this brings working
thread back to centre line. Then take
stitch to left-hand side again and proceed
as before.
(6) Fancy Herringbone —This shows ordinary plain herringbone
stitch with the addition of sewn-down stitches at ends and centres,
also extra stitch at top, forming arrow, and French knots between
spaces.

ROMAN CUT WORK.
ROMAN CUT WORK —The motifs and all points of the design
in Roman Cut Work touch each other in such a way as to make
cross bars unnecessary. This is an open embroidery, more like carving
in effect, and no attempt is made to suggest lace. It is best worked
on a ;iice firm linen. The designs for this embroidery may be rather
elaborate, since the work itself is very simple.
It is not shaded in any wav, and is very much on one plane, except
for slight raising of buttonhole outline. All motifs that form design
Fig. A.
should be outlined in run-in stitches, as shown in detail, Fig. A.
Great care must be taken not to draw these run-in stitches tight, as
the work must be kept perfectly flat. Underlay the outline of one
motif and finish it complete before working the next. The button-
hole work is done over a single row of run-in stitches, as shown in
Fig. A, and very tightly and closely worked.
The method of working veins in petals or leaves is dearly shown
in Fig. A. It is not necessary to use very fine working cotton, but
it is necessary to do the work dose. This makes it look fine and
firm and very much richer than if very fine thread were used. Use

RICHELIEU.
RICHELIEU, —Work of this sort gives the general impression of
being done in linen thread, but it is really more supple if embroidery
is worked in cotton. The stitches should be quite close together and
rather tight in order to insure a certain stiffness in the bars. The
working of bars in Cut Work should receive particular attention,
as the neatness of the finished piece depends much on their proper
execution. Take the bars in Fig. B, which connect the two parallel
lines of buttonholing. Begin to run the upper line of stamping, and
when the first bar is reached carry thread across to lower line, take
a stitch and then carry to upper. Then to lower line—thus giving
three threads from line to line for
bar. Now buttonhole bar from
lower line to upper one and pro-
ceed to run the upper line until
next bar is reached, where
three threads are laid as be- a
fore, and so on. Now run
the lower line and buttonhole kailp
both lines, thus completing /Sgl®'
the space. Other ways
of working Richelieu emffy

HOW TO LAUNDER "SEMCO” EMBROIDERIES.
Colored Embroidery.—Wash Colored Embroidery by itself in a
wash bowl. Take fairly hot water, and make light suds of any pure
soap, rinse and wash quickly; if the linen is soiled, rub that portion
between the hands, but avoid general rubbing. Take out of suds
and rinse in pure water. Having thoroughly washed the article,
commence to dry it.
Drying Colored Embroidery.—Wrap work in a thick towel; roll
it inside this in such a way that no portion of the Embroidery can
touch any other part of the linen. Leave until article is dry enough
to iron.
White Embroidery.—Wash in usual way; iron on wrong side on
very thick blanket.

SMOCKING
I 'HE best method for smocking is by taking up the material
£ at small dots (Fig. 1) with short stitches on right side of
material. Run threads along on each line of dots (Fig. 2)
until you have material all gathered, then fasten the threads at
Fig. 1
Fig. 2.
the end, leaving the material the
correct fulness or width desired.
Each line of gathering must
have a separate thread, and
each thread should be started
at right-hand side with double
stitch to hold the knot, so as it
will not slip through when
thread is drawn up. It is
absolutely essential that this
foundation be carefully pre-
pared; in fact, the most impor-
tant thing in regard to smock-
ing is the evenness of the gath-
ering. This cannot be too
strongly impressed, as the whole
beauty of the work depends
upon it. This will make smock-
ing very easy. All that is then
necessary is to follow along the
dots with the various stitches
you desire to use. All work
starts at left side and works
towards right. Fig. 3 shows
Fig. 2 with the gathering thread ;
drawn up. It is the wrong side
Fig. 3
Scmco Art Needlework


of the work, the right side
upon which the smocking
stitches are worked presents
a succession of folds; see
Fig. 4. After smocking is
finished, original gathering
threads should be pulled out.
SMOCKING STITCHES
Fig. s—Outline Stitch —
This stitch is most simple.
Work from left to right.
Start your thread on the
second pleat at the gather-
ing thread on wrong side of
material, bring the needle
up in the first pleat on the
right side of material. Take
one stitch from left to right
on top of each pleat, keep-
ing the thread below the
needle, and each stitch
directly over the gathering
thread. Fasten off thread at
end of each row.
Fig 6. Double Outline Stitch. The braided effect shown by
this sample is secured by working two rows of outline stitch closely
together over each gathering thread, in one row- the thread being
Fig. 5
Fig. 4
Semco Art Needlework


Fig. 6
Fig. 7
held above the needle and
in the other below the
needle. Fig. 4 also shows
this stitch with varia-
tions.
Fig. 7. Single Cable
Stitch. This stitch is
worked from left to right
and is very much like
outline stitch. Start your
thread the same as out-
line stitch, then take one
stitch in every pleat,
keeping the thread above
the needle in the first
stitch and below the
needle in the next stitch,
then above the needle
again, and so on to end
of line, keeping each
stitch exactly on top of
gathering thread.
Fig. 8 Double Cable
Stitch This is simply
two row's of single cable
worked closely together.
Work the first row as
previously described (Fig.
7, single cable), and in
the second row reverse
order of thread above or
below the needle. As the
first row begins with the
thread above the needle,
the second should beg n
with the thread below the
needle.
Fig. 8
Semco Art Needlework.


Fig. 9 — Single and Double
Wave Stitch —The wave proper
consists of four stitches worked
gradually up, and four stitches
worked gradually down again
in the outline stitch, and is
worked from left to right. Start
your thread on second pleat on
right side of material and work
to the line above, using one,
two, three stitches, one in each
pleat with the thread below the
needle going up. Now with the
thread above the needle take
one stitch on the line next to
the third stitch up, with the
thread above the needle, and
work to the line below, using
three stitches gradually. Then
with the thread below the needle
take one stitch next to last
stitch on the line, and work
again to the line above, using
three stitches and repeat. If
your space permits, you can use
four stitches in place of three.
Two or more rows of wave
stitch may be worked, one
above the other, as in illustra-
tion.
Fig. 9.
Fig. 10.— Combination Single Cable and Double Wave. —This
pattern requires seven lines of gathering. On the first line work
a row of single cable stitches. On the second line the double wave
or diamond stitch is commenced. Bring the needle up on the first
pleat, take a stitch (with the thread above the needle) on second
pleat between second and third lines, take third pleat (thread below
needle) between second and third lines, take fourth pleat (thread below
needle) on second line, take fifth pleat (thread above needle) on
second line, repeat. Start the other half of the diamond on third
line and work up to meet the first half.
Fig, 11. — Curved Wave and Diamond Point. —This is much
admired, and gives an elaborate unusual appearance to a piece of
work. However, it is simple enough in execution. The wave we
have had and mastered (Fig. 9) and the curved wave is very similar.
Thus —w-ork from a given line four outline stitches up to the line
above, then curving very slightly, three stitches in outline are worked
first above the line, then four outline stitches are worked down again
to the first line, then three outline stitches are worked just below this
line, and then four stitches in outline again to the line above, then
the three in outline just above the line. This is one row of the
curved wave. The second line is W'orked one space either below
Semco Art Needlework


or above the first line. In this
case (Fig. 11) fifteen lines were
used. The two lines of Vandyke
were worked and then the
curved lines or waves put in.
Between these lines is shown a
row of dots in a deeper shade
than the waved lines. These
dots are worked from right
to left, two pleats are taken
together and two stitches are
Fig 10.
taken over them. Then the needle
is carried under two pleats, and in the
next two pleats another dot is worked.
The point in this case begins with
one row of full diamonds across the
piece. This row of diamonds is
divided into spaces of six diamonds.
As one proceeds to drop one diamond
in every succeeding row, one half on
either side. These two patterns are
charming and quite elaborate enough
for all ordinary uses.
Fig, 12.— Honeycomb Stitch. —This
is undoubtedly the first form of the
smocking stitch, and is the stitch most
frequently seen on women’s dresses
and coats, and children s garments.
There are several different methods of
preparing material for honeycomb
smocking, and all ways lead to the
same result. Material marked with
dots, as in Fig. 1, may be gathered
or not, as preferred, for it is perfectly
feasible to work the stitch on dots
Semco Art Needlework.


Fig. 12
without gathering. Begin work on second row of dots at upper
right-hand side, fasten thread securely so that it will not pull through.
Bring needle up through second dot, take first and second dots together,
then over once again to the first dot. pass needle up back of material
to first row and take second and third dots together in same way.
Down again to second row and take second and third dots together
in same way. Down again to second row and take third and fourth
dots together, then to first and take fourth and fifth dots. In other
words, the dot vertically parallel to the one last worked becomes the
first in the succeeding stitch, A point begins with any number

ILLUSTRATIONS OF TATTING
For making tatting, use a strongly twisted thread and a shuttle.
In winding thread around shuttle, care should be taken not to wind
on too much thread at one time, as it will cause the shuttle to gape
apart at the ends.
First position of the hands (Fig 1) —Double st on knots, take
the end of thread between thumb and forefinger in left hand, holding
shuttle in right hand, pass the thread over the third and fourth fingers,
draw it back towards thumb and cross the two threads under the
fingers as shown in Fig. 1. Pass shuttle thread around the little
finger of right hand and draw the shuttle as shown in illustration.
Second and third positions of the hands (Fig. 2 and 3) —Pass the
shuttle between the first and third fingers as shown in Fig. 2, bring
it out behind the loop where shuttle has been put through the loop.

Beginners can put right hand on the table with the thread firmly
extended, leaving the left hand perfectly motionless. Raise third
finger of left hand to draw stitch which forms the first half of the
double stitch. Be careful in keeping thread in right hand still while
left hand is in motion —the right hand, or shuttle thread must always
be free in passing through the knots.

Fourth position of the hands (Fig. 4) —Hands resume position as
shown in Fig. 1. Figure 5 reproduces the same, showing a few
complete stitches.

Positions of the hands showing picot (Fig. 6) —Picots are used in
tatting, as in crochet or knitting, making effective combinations where
different parts of a pattern arc joined together; a little care is
necessary in getting the picots even. Illustration shows how to form
picot tatting with two shuttles (Fig. 7). Two shuttles are used in
tatting when the rings are not to be connected together at bottom
by a thread or when you desire to hide passage of thread to another
cluster of stitches or when threads of different color are used.
Working with two threads is called a chain. Working with one
thread is called a ring. When you w'ork with two shuttles, tie
the tw-o threads together, wand thread around the little finger several
times, leaving shuttle hang down, using the other shuttle to make
movements as though you were working with only one shuttle.
The Open Picot. —The open and closed picot are formed by leaving
a loop on extended thread as shown in illustration. Closed picots
are formed by drawing sts close together.

TATTING INSTRUCTIONS
Abbreviations Used. — (d s) double stitch or double knot, (p) picot,
fch) chain, (1 p) long picot, (*) repetition mark, (r) ring, (c 1)
clover leaf.
In making tatting a small shuttle not more than 2j inches long
is best for all threads except the very coarse. For a heavy thread
a large shuttle is necessary to carry enough thread to avoid making
knots too frequently.
Thread used for tatting must be smooth and hard-twisted in order
to make firm, even work. Semco A.T.C. Mercer is an ideal thread
for this work.
By d s or double stitch is meant the stitch formed by the two
movements of the shuttle—one over and one under. The picots
add much to the beauty of the work and make it look lacy. They
are also used in joining different parts of the work, and should be
of even length. Rings are made with the shuttle thread only, and
the chains with both the shuttle and spool threads. Care should
be used to have sts of chains come up close to the ring. By using
one thread colored and one white, many pretty edges can be made
for towels, handkerchiefs, etc.
In presenting the following designs our aim has been to give
patterns which are not too intricate for the average worker, and to
combine beauty and usefulness.
