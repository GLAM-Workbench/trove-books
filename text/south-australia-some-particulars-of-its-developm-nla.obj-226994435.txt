SOUTH AUSTRALIA:
SOME PARTICULARS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND
FINANCIAL POSITION.
In connection with the early departure of the newly-appointed Agent-
General (Sir J. C. Bray, K.C.M G.) for Loudon, we have been instructed to
prepare a short summary of leading particulars relating to the financial
position of South Australia, and especially as to the Loan Fund.
The figures which we shall quote apply only to the Province of South
Australia proper (exclusive of the Northern Territory), and, so far as they
apply, are compiled from the Public Accounts to June 30th, 1801.
LAND. AND OUTLAY ON WORKS.
The purchase money received for freeholds amounted to .£9,534,260, and
there is a balance of £1,082,623 still owing by the holders of selected land.
The proceeds have been expended in the development of the province, and
have been largely supplemented out of rents, interest on selections, and
General Revenue The “ Statistical Register ” shows that the expenditure
thereout on roads, bridges, buildings, and other public works, and subsidies
to District Councils and Corporations, amounted to £8,040,225. This in-
cludes repairs (which have not been kept separate from new works), but does not
include the cost of establishments, nor those works of permanent value that
have been paid for through other Ministers than the Commissioner of
Public Works. And as the subsidies depended upon a similar outlay by
the District Councils, &c., the total cost has been very much greater than
the sum mentioned. Besides this, the cost of surveys has been £1,403,099,
and £2,002,707 has been expended in bringing out immigrants. These
three items amount to £11,446,031, which is entirely separate from the
expenditure of Loan Moneys, and is in addition to £1,148,700 paid out of
Revenue for the redemption of Bonds.

These figures show that the outlay necessary to develop this Colony has not
depended solely upon English capital and the sale of Crown lands, hut that
the colonists them selves have contributed liberally towards the same object.
REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.
The following is the result of an analysis of the Revenue Accounts for the
year ended June 30th, 1891 :
Sources of Revenue—
The surplus of Revenue over Expenditure during the past four years was
£387,572, and has been applied towards meeting the deficit on June 30th
1887, which had accrued during the previous five years (1882-7), and amounted
to £1,108,795. This deficit was not due merely to the effects of that long
period of unexampled depression; but also to the very large proportion of
incomplete Loan works upon which Government was at that time paying
interest without receiving any revenue; and also to the fact that the
financial and commercial depression did not prevent the expenditure of
£565,376 on Public Works in excess of the proceeds of sales, interest, and
rents from Crown lands. Under these circumstances Government might
have been justified in recouping a portion by Loan. It was, however, deter-
mined to meet the whole cost out of Revenue. The taxation was therefore
adjusted and Treasury Bills authorised ; and, as the deficit is now r being
rapidly paid off, the colony will receive the full benefit of the improved
value of the public property.
The above summary of receipts and payments for “Railway and other Ser-
vices” includes Waterworks, Post Office, Marine Board, and Printing; and
the Revenue also includes some other small items.
On comparing the principal figures with those of the Imperial Revenue,
one cannot help being struck with the essential differences in the sources from
w'hich they are respectively derived. There, taxation forms about five-sixths
of the Revenue; here it is less than one-third. There, the revenue from services
rendered only amounts to one-seventh ; here it constitutes more than half. The
reason is evident. Tbe Imperial Revenue is charged with the payment of
interest on the National Debt, for which there are no reproductive works worth
mentioning, except the Telegraphs, the profit on which is a very small item ;
but the debt here is also represented by Raihvays, Waterworks, and other


Public Works, which are worth more to the Colony than the total amount
owing, and yield a net income nearly sufficient to pay the whole of the
interest. This brings us to a consideration of the Loan Fund itself.
LOANS.
The Total Loans issued on account of South Australia proper amount to
£20,509,600. The net proceeds received (allowing for discount on Railway
Loans) was £20,202,157, of which £1,521,723 had not been expended. The
outlay on Loan works was therefore £18,710,434, which may be summed up
as follows :
A. —Works yielding Revenue direct to Treasurer—
Hallways £10,950,455
Telegraphs 846,727
Waterworks 1,916,977
Adelaide Sewers 446,967
£14,161,126
B. Works not yielding direct Revenue, or on
which the Revenue is mixed with
other receipts —
Main Hoads, Harbors, and Jetties ' £2,403,980
Improvements Pastoral Leases Purchased 534,938
Development of Interior and Drainage 502,439
Defences, Military and Naval 234,105
School Buildings 399,489
Other Buildings 299,806
£4,374,757
Aid to Revenue and Portion of Premiums 174,551
£18,710,434
The liability upon this Expenditure has been reduced by the redemption
of £1,148,700 out of the General Revenue ; and as the greater part con-
sisted of the older Bonds, which bore interest at six per cent., the amount
of interest payable has been reduced by £68,322 per annum.
The Interest payable upon Loans for the financial year 1890-91 was
£773,766. This, of course, included interest not oidy upon the actual outlay
for works, but upon the unexpended balance; and after deducting receipts
the net amount paid by Revenue was £751,295, Against this, the net
Revenue derived from Loan Works in the first list was as follows :
Railways —Net,Earnings for Year £606,820
Telegraphs (mixed with Post Office), say 25,000
Waterworks—Receipts, Lss Expenditure 65,167
Adelaide Sewers—Contributed out of Rates 13,352
£710,339
or nearly 95 per cent, of the amount required for Interest upon the whole of
the Public Debt; and leaving only £40,956 to be provided out of the General
Revenue as Interest on Loan Moneys.
The Loan Works in the Second List, although not placed by us among
the direct Revenue-producing accounts, actually bring in a certain amount of


direct Revenue, and indirectly create a much larger amount. Thus, for
example, the expenditure on Harbors and Jetties brings Revenue to the
Marine Board, and the purchased improvements on pastoral lands are taken
account of in fixing the rents, or in occupying the properties for other pur-
poses. The indirect advantages are, however, far greater, for (in addition to
the large outlay from Revenue in Public Works, Roads, Bridges, Surveys,
Immigration, &c.) the expenditure of £4,374,757 of Loan Moneys in such
works as the construction of Main Roads throughout the Colony, deepening
the Harbors, obtaining water in the dry country in the North, and Drainage
of swamps in the South, establishing a system of Defences, and in building
Schoolhouses fitted for a free and liberal education, has materially helped to
make South Australia what she is at the present day.
It may seem surprising that although no allowance has been made in the
above figures for any income from the £4,374,757, yet the Public Revenue
has virtually to provide only £40,956 as Interest on that large outlay. This
favorable position is partly owing to the saving of £68,322 on Bonds
redeemed ; partly to the money paid out of Revenue in aid of Railway
construction; and partly to the fact that until the Railway traffic was
sufficient to cover interest and expenses, the General Revenue had to bear
the loss. Now the case is reversed, and the Revenue gets the benefit of that
outlay without having to pay interest upon it.
The balance-sheet of the Railway Commissioners states the cost of con-
struction at £11,399,193. Their accounts also show that from the com-
mencement until the time when the Railways as a whole were sufficiently
developed to cover all cost, the net amount contributed by Revenue towards
interest and working outlay was £1,778,917. If the works had been carried
out by Public Companies a large part of these losses would necessarily have
been capitalised and charged to the cost of construction. It follows, there-
fore, that the actual cost of our Public Works, from a commercial point of
view, is very much greater than that shown either in the Railway Balance-
sheet or in our Summary of Loan Kxpenditure. If we take the value or
development at one-half the net outlay incurred, the cost of Railway con-
struction will stand at £12,288,651, and upon this amount the last year’s
Railway income would show a net return of 4-94 per cent., leading to the
inference that this is not an excessive value.
The additional cost of construction thus paid for out of Revenue, taken in
conjunction with the Bonds redeemed, create a surplus of Loan Assets over
liabilities of £2,486,896. This is a very material set-off against any of the
other Loan Works that are not directly reproductive, and to a very great
extent accounts for the small amount of Interest that has to be provided
for out of the General Revenue. The amount of Bonds redeemed and the
additional value of the Railways practically reduce the liability on the Debt
that is not direct revenue-producing to less than one-half.
Provision has been made for redeeming the whole of the Five and Six per
Cent. Bonds by fixed half-yearly payments, extending to July, 1920. These
periodical repayments are less than the half-yearly Interest already saved,
and this affords an additional security that the arrangement will be completed
in its integrity, without the necessity for any renewals. This will increase
the amount of Bonds redeemed to £2,635,50:), and the savings to £154,230
per annum. Thus w r e have a system of redemption, equivalent in its effect
to a Sinking Fund ; and in addition to this there is an actual Sinking Fund
to pay off a portion of the Loan for Adelaide Sewers. Taking this in con-


junction with the increased value of Railways, and the constant outlay of
Revenue on Public Works, it appears that all has been and is being done
that is necessary to strengthen the value of the Public Estate.
RAILWAYS.
It is not very long ago that a statement was made in one of the London
dailies that the principal means of communication in Australia was by
coasting steamers, and that there were only a few short railway lines, but none
extended far from the coast A glance at any recent map will show that the
whole of Victoria, New South Wales, and the settled parts of Queensland
and South Australia are covered by a network of railways. In this Colony
we have one line from Adelaide running 688 miles direct north towards the
interior of the continent, and there are two lines from Spencer’s Gfulf running
east and west to New South Wales and Victoria, respectively; besides other
main lines and branches, making a total of 1,666 miles actually open to traffic.
The various lines in the three neighboring Colonies on the East bring up this
total to 8,693 miles, nearly all of which are connected together ; to say nothing
of the separate railways in Western Australia, the Northern Territory,
Tasmania, and New Zealand.
Adelaide has the advantage of being the port of arrival and departure of
the Ocean Mails. A line of railways extends thence into Victoria, and through
Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane (the capitals of the three Eastern Colonies)
to Charlesville, a distance of 2,265 miles, and to this continuous line may be
added the extension from Adelaide northwards for 688 miles. The total
length of the trunk line without branches is thus 2,953 miles, and is there-
fore one of the longest continuous railways in the world.
In a recent pamphlet issued by authority of the Government of New
South Wales, it is remarked “ The progress and importance of a Colony
may well be judged by the length of its railways in regard to population,
and viewed in this way the colony of New South Wales stands out strongly
in favorable comparison with other countries. It has a population, speaking
generally, of 1,134,207 people, which, divided by our railway mileage, gives
one mile of line for 520 persons. In Great Britain there are 1,908 persons
to each mile of line; in France, 1,745; in Germany, 1845; in the United
States, where they have done more in regard to railway enterprise than any
other country in the world, one mile to every 315 persons; in the adjoining
colony of Victoria there is one mile to every 456 persons.” In the foregoing
extract no allusion is made to South Australia, but as she has 1,666 miles to
a population of 315,048, there is one mile to every 189 persons If therefore
the test may be considered a correct one, this Colony holds the proud position
of having a much greater proportionate railway mileage than even the United
States, more than double that of either of the two larger Australian colonies
referred to in the paragraph, and about ten times the average of Great Britain,
France, and Germany. We think, however, that the test would not be a
reliable one unless the prospective traffic were sufficient to justify the con-
struction, and in our case this element is not wanting.
Large as the Railway Mileage is in proportion to the population of South
Australia, the extent of her commerce must not be overlooked. The Exports
and Imports last year amounted to over seventeen millions, or £54 per head of
population, while the average for the United Kingdom was under £2O per
head, and we have already shown that the Revenue last year paid more than
Interest on the cost of Construction. The following tabulated statement for

ten years is copied from the Annual Report of the Railway Commissioners,
and shows that the profits have not only overtaken the extra mileage, but that
the average net Revenue, including the 711 miles since added, is now twice as
profitable as the former revenue of the old lines by themselves ; and therefore
the new lines, instead of being a drag, are now a proved success :

MISTAKEN ADVICE.
Whilst engaged in the preparation of this paper a press telegram was
published, dated London, January Bth, stating, “In financial circles the hope
is generally expressed that the colonies would make definite efforts to defer
their borrowing intentions. Financiers advise the creation of Sinking Funds,
for the purpose of discharging matured loans.” It must be borne in mind
that not only in this colony but throughout Australia the greater part of the
public Loans are for the construction of Railways, and the local Govern-
ments practically take the position of the shareholders. The Railway Capital
in the United Kingdom at the end of 1890 consisted of—
£897,472,026
And this was increasing at the rate of about £16,000,000 per annum. .Now,
what would be thought of any financiers who not only tried to put the brake
upon this increased expenditure, but suggested the necessity of repaying the
Loans and Preference Stock ? And yet the telegram in its application to
Australia goes even further than this, for it would not only stop the
expenditure of new capital for development, but in its advice about
the creation of Sinking Funds practically ignores the permanent value
of the railways already constructed. Such a policy would limit the
further development of a continent almost as large as Furope to the
resources of the three million colonists already settled there, instead of
affording a field for the permanent, profitable, and secure investment of
capital. If the British Railways require annually so large an addition to


their capital (a considerable proportion of which additions are in the form of
Loans) surely there are stronger reasons why the development of this con-
tinent should require a constant increase in capital. The rapid growth in
population, production, trade, and commerce, and the extension of settlement,
demand that the public works and facilities should keep pace with this
growth. Australia must continue to pursue her onward course, and to do
so, additional capital can be employed with safety both to the borrower and
the lender. To stop progress at the present point would be folly. The only
justification for the suggestions in the telegram would be that the Loan
Moneys are injudiciously expended, and that the securities are insufficient ;
or that the revenues will not pay interest. Wo confidently submit, however,
that the facts and figures we have produced prove that at any rate these
objections do not apply to South Australia, and that the value of public
property and the resources of the colony have increased to a very far greater
extent than all the money borrowed.
The total amount of the Loans to South Australia is after all small, com-
pared with the aggregate public and private wealth of the Colony, and
British Capitalists have benefited in the regular payments of interest,
amounting to over ten millions sterling. The manner in which the public
funds have been hitherto protected, and the capital and resources of the
Colony increased, should be a guarantee that the residents will not permit
their personal interests to be jeopardised by extravagance or unnecessary
liabilities. When further Loans are asked for, the analogy of the past should
lead Capitalists to bear in mind that the people of South Australia have
a sufficient stake in permanent value of securities and the future welfare of
the Colony to lead them to look on both sides of the obligation.
