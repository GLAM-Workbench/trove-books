(No. 59.)
(No. 113.)
Downing-street, 9 th November, 1852.
Sir,
I have had before me your Despatches noted in the margin, (No. 118,5th June,
1852; No. 123, 12th June, 1852,) stating that you have declined to receive Convicts
from New South Wales at Norfolk Island; and reporting the temporary increase of
Salary you had granted to the Officers at that Station, as well as the measures which you
contemplated for effecting an early transference of the majority of the Convicts from thence
to Tasman’s Peninsula, with a view to the ultimate abandonment of the Station at Norfolk
Island.
Under the circumstances you acted very properly in declining to receive Convicts
from any of the neighbouring Colonies at Norfolk Island.
The increase of Salary suddenly granted to all the Officers would for obvious reasons
have been undesirable in any ordinary state of things: but the emergency seems to have
rendered it inevitable ; and I shall therefore recommend it to the favourable consideration of
the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and trust that it will meet with their sanction.
The reasons which you assign for materially reducing, and ultimately abolishing, the
Station at Norfolk Island satisfy me of the propriety of that course. The measures by
which you propose to carry the object into effect have evidently been well considered ; and
I have to convey my approval of your executing them at the earliest moment which you
may find suitable for the purpose.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient humble Servant,
JOHN S. PAKINGTON.
