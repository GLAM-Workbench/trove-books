NOTE.
In order that the Mineral Resources of the Colony may be illus-
trated as completely as under present circumstances is possible, at
the forthcoming Intercolonial Exhibition, the Minerals and Rocks
which have been presented from time to time to this Department
by Pi?ospectors, Miners, Mining Surveyors, and others, have been
carefully arranged, and labelled and numbered.
With this Catalogue in his hand, anyone may easily find the
Specimen he seeks ; but it is to be understood that no attempt has
been made to classify the Minerals and Rocks. As valuable addi-
tions are made every day, it would be premature to do this ; and
no good purpose, at this stage, would be served by it.
The Specimens of Quartz, showing the character of the Reefs
throughout the country, are very valuable - and interesting ; and,
when the Collection is complete, the Mineralogist will be in a
good position to compare and contrast the several kinds of gold-
bearing quartz, and to arrive at safe conclusions regarding them.
As much as hand specimens can teach, he will be able to learn.
The thanks of the Department are due to those gentlemen
named in the Catalogue, who have freely given their time and
labor to the work of collecting specimens.

Secretary for Mines.

254. Specimens of Granite, showing the junction with
the metamorphosed slate, and the intersecting veins of quartz. ?
Nuggety Reef, Maldon. Pyrrhotine and other forms of iron
pyrites are found in this locality. The distribution of the minerals
composing the granite is often peculiar, and the gold is disseminated
in the small veins of quartz in such a manner as to compel the
miners to send the granite itself as broken out of the mine to the
mills. The specimen marked A, at the place indicated by a black
ring, and in other places, contains gold visible to the naked eye.
These specimens are of surpassing interest to the mineralogist.

of Magnesia. ? New Zealand. ?The property of the Honorable
Samuel H. Bindon, M.P., Minister of Justice. Found massive,
and in blocks, with slate and limestone, in many parts of the
world. In the Exhibition of 1862 a very large mass was ex-
hibited, worth ï¿½7OO or ï¿½BOO, and brought from Siberia. At
Icolmkill, in Scotland, nephritic pebbles are found on the shore in
great abundance, having been originally disseminated through a
limestone, which has long ago been wrought out. In India, axe-
heads, ornaments, &c., are manufactured from jade. Vessels
made from this material are as sonorous as porcelain. The
natives of New Zealand fashion jade or nephrite into many
fantastic shapes, hatchets, ornaments, &c., of which the accom-
panying specimen is an excellent example. The term nephrite is
derived from a kidney , because it was supposed to be a
remedy for diseases of that organ.

357. l&ilk-white Quartz, and Quartz Crystals, with
a large quantity of Gold in thin leaves, striated Iron Pyrites,
and Galena. Where the pyrites and galena have disappeared,
the thin walls of gold which once enclosed the crystals are left
standing, quite clean and bright ; and, under the glass, the gold
presents a singularly beautiful appearance. This specimen, besides
being extremely rich and handsome, is instructive and worthy of
study. It is the property of Mr. Rowe, of Fryer?s Creek, and
was obtained at a depth of 110 feet from the surface, and 20 feet
below the water level, from a vein one foot thick, which yields
11 ozs. to the ton. Exhibited by R. L. M, Kitto, Mining Sur-

of pyrites, small ; crystallized. These specimens are worthy of
attention in consequence of the depth from which they were
raised, and the increased yield of gold with the depth. The
statement undermentioned is verified by the late manager of the
Albion Company (Mr. King), and by Mr. Henry Davidson, the
Mining Surveyor. Mr. King states that the quantities have been
very carefully arrived at. From the Portuguese Reef.?

with a thin coating of Iron Oxide. The specimens are more
than ordinarily rich ; and the mode in which the gold is dis-
tributed through the quartz is instructive to the mineralogist.
