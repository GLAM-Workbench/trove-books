HISTORY
OF THE
INGLEWOOD REEFS.
INTRODUCTION.
The first edition of this work was dedicated
by the author to Gorges M. Lowther, Esq.,
P.M., then Warden of Inglewood. The author
himself has departed this life, but the benefits
of the labor expended b3 r him have been and
will be long felt by those who were his fellow
townsmen. In issuing the second edition of
what has now become a work of reference, its
thorough accuracy never having been in the
slightest degree impugned, the proprietary of
The Inglewood Advertiser may be pardoned for
expressing a hope that the purpose for which
the work was originally compiled will be now
accomplished, and that the Mining Interest will
during the next few years make such progress,
that each succeeding edition of the “History of
the Inglewood Reefs” will become more bulky
than its predecessor.


Chapter I.
THE OLD INGLEWOOD REEF.
On the 27th of November, 1859, Gr. Carter,
■J. Stewart, J. Edel, and W. Thompson, lodged
the necessary notice that they had marked out
ISO feet on a reef, to be called the Old Ingle-
wood, Gr. Carter having previously found gold
in quartz on the surface. On commencing work,
a reef was very soon found which held out
good prospects, but it was not until the month
of March in the following year, that the stone
was struck which has caused this claim to rank
among the noted ones of the district. It is
much to be regretted that no accounts have
been preserved of the yields of this claim, but
according to the verbal statement of Mr Carter,
nearly LIB,OOO was obtained in a few months.
So promising indeed did the prospects appear,
that the proprietors were induced to erect steam
crushing, pumping, and winding machinery on
the claim, at a cost of L 8,400, the plant consist-
ing of a 25-horse power horizontal engine, two
batteries of stamps of 4 heads each, lift pumn
with 300 feet of 7-inch piping, and all necessary
winding gear; the shaft was sunk, and splen-
didly timbered to a depth of 260 feet, but no-
thing could be found to compensate their enor-
mous outlay. The best stone was obtained at a
depth of about 70 feet, where 93 tons of stone were
produced, yielding 8250 z of gold, but it is the
opinion of Mr Carter, that the stone left in the
claim above the prospected level is not worth
more than per ton ; this would seem to
promise but very poorly for the future, but fur-
ther inquiries have brought to light a few rather
interesting facts in connection with this once
rich claim. For instance, No 1 north, is a claim
that, up the present time, has produced about
L2OO worth of gold. At a depth of 214 feet,
the proprietors took out stone at their boundary
leading into the prospect claim, which yielded
loz 2dwts per ton ; this stone was dipping south-
ward so acutely, as to show that it has never


yet been touched in the prospect claim, it never
having been sunk below 260 feet, and the dip
of the stone showing it to have been impossible
for it to have been reached at so shallow a
depth. Again, in the ground south of the pros-
pecting claim, a reef has been discovered at a
distance of 80 feet westward, which lias been
called the Kelveton. This reef underlies east-
ward ; at an angle of about 45 degrees, meeting
the Old Inglewood line, which underlies west-
ward, the junction of these two reefs has been
struck in No 2, South, (otherwise known as
No. 2 North Kelveton,) at the water level,
namely, 200 feet, when operations had to be
suspended, as the pumping engine on the pros-
pect claim had ceased to work. The Kelveton
Keef has produced payable stone so far as it
has been worked. Its yields have ranged bet-
ween ozs down to 4 dwts per ton, the whole
yield averaging nearly 15 dwts per ton. This
reef has not yet been touched in the prospect
claim, as in sinking the shaft perpendicularly,
the reef was cut through and the junction of the
two lines passed over. All this would seem to
show that the present prospectors have good
fortune yet in store for them. The pumping
machinery has lately been removed. This is to
be regretted, as the probability is, that it will
shortly have to be replaced at two or three
times the cost of the amount realized of the
one just sold. It appears to be the general
opinion of those interested in the reef, that the
removal of this machinery was a most injudi-
cious stop, as it did its work well and effectually,
the reef being kept drained to a depth of 260
feet, ( i. e. the deepest point gained,) with from
two to three hours pumping per day. This is
sufficient to show that it would have been cap-
able of draining the mine for a very considerable
depth. Its removal has caused a stoppage of
operations along nearly the whole length of the
line, all claims being either registered or aban-
doned, up to No. 12, North. In No. 1 South,
an immense amount of work has been done.
Gold was first obtained in December, 1860, at a
depth of 120 feet, in the same lode from which
the prospectors’ obtained their rich patch; there
is likewise another lode at the distance of about


40 feet eastward of the main body, and this
also has produced good payable stone. A shaft
has been sunk on the northern extremity of the
claim to a depth of 180 feet. The main reef
has been driven through showing a body of
stone 26 feet in width, with gold more or less
all through; a trial of 80 tons gave a result of
2dwtsperton. The following account of crush-
ings furnished by Mr W. Smith, may be relied
upon as correct: —

No. 2 south is known likewise as No. 2 North
Kelveton, and comparing the amount of work
done in this claim on the two lines respectively,
the latter appears its most appropriate name.
All the work done iu this claim on the Old
Inglewood line is sinking a shaft 180 feet, and
extracting 22 tons of stone, which produced 7oz
14dwts. The result of the work on the Kelve-
ton line is as follows :

The stone producing the above results was
struck at a depth of 60 feet, and it has been en-
tirely cleared out from that to a depth of 130
feet, by a length of 80 feet along the line.
From the next claim southward, No. 1 North
Kelveton, the following crushings have been
obtained:

Following on southward is the claim known
as the Kelveton Prospecting Claim. Little ap-
pears to be known of it, the original proprie-
tors having left. One fact in connection with
it appears h®wever to be tolerably well authenti-
cated, namely, that soon after stone was struck
twenty pounds weight of specimens produced
20oz of gold. Yarious crushings have since
been obtained, with yields varying from 4dwts
to 12dwts per ton. This appears to terminate
the workings southward on this line. North-
ward gold has been obtained in Nos. 1,2, 3,4,
5, 12, 13, 15, and 17; Nos. 1,2, 3, and 12 being
the only claims that have given anything worth
mentioning. No. 1 has produced about 50
ounces, but the detailed account is not obtain-
able. No. 2 has produced the followings
No. 2 North.

The above crushings were obtained at depths
varying from 128 to 150 feet; gold was likewise
found at from 180 to 190 feet, but the stone was
never thoroughly tested, as it was supposed not
to be payable; the latter mentioned depth is the
deepest point this claim has been sunk to. The
results of No 3 are not known; for No. 12 the
following account has been kept by Mr Target,
one of the shareholders—

These crushings were produced from the sur-
face down to a depth of 50 feet. Sinking has
been continued down to 170 feet, but gold has
not been seen below 60 feet. The thickness of
the reef in this claim from the surface down to
the greatest depth gained, has averaged 2j feet.
The whole of this line at the present time re-
mains in a state of inactivity, the greater part of
it being held under lease. This terminates all
that it is considered necessary to record of the
history of the Old Inglewood Ecef ; the earlier
part of its career has been sufficiently brilliant
to inspire the belief that its present condition
is not the inertness of death, but only the result
of a drowsiness from which it will shortly
arouse.


Chapter 11.
GODWIN REEF, SURFACE HILL.
Tliis ground was first opened for surface at
the commencement of the rush, in 1859, and
many parts of it proved of extraordinary rich-
ness. Beneath the surface a layer of cement
was found, composed principally of a white des-
cription of quartz, which was very extensively
worked and yielded in many instances as much
as from four to five ounces to the ton. The existence
of this bed of quartz cement led to a further ex-
amination of the ground, which resulted in
M’Kenzie and Co., in about October, 1860, dis-
covering the reef which was subsequently known
as the Godwin. In this claim the reef, which
was found not far from the surface, was at first
only eight inches in width, gold was found in it
as soon as the reef was brought to light, and
a trial crushing of five tons produced soz to
the ton. The exact amount produced at this
part of the reef in this claim is not known as
accounts were not kept, but the prospectors
state that it was over three thousand pounds.
An inspection of the claim has shown it to have
been very imperfectly worked. It would seem
as though the owners had been hunting for rich
patches, instead of systematically working, and
the consequence is that an immense amount of
stone has been left in this part of the workings,
which have not been continued to a greater depth
than about forty feet. The shaft was eventually
sunk to water level, which is about 140 feet,
where the reef was found to be 20 feet in thick-
ness ; this was driven through, and good speci-
mens obtained in various parts of it, but from
some unexplained reason it was not deemed
necessary to prosecute work any further, and it
was accordingly abandoned. In the early part
of the present year it was again taken up, since
which the following results have been obtained,
principally from the old workings ;

Or an average of 7 dwts 7 grs to the ton. An
examination of the claim has shown that an
immense amount of the same description of stone
jet remains. The present proprietors of this
claim have further prospected it by sinking a
shaft about 100 feet westward of the old work-
ing, where a body of stone 4ft in thickness was
found which upon trial proved with 7dwts to the
ton. In No. 1. south, the character of the work
done very much resembles that in the prospect-
ing claim. One part only appears to have had
proper attention paid to it, namely, the surface
block. This has been taken out for a width of
twenty feet in some parts, but there is still much
left behind. Baptie and Co., the first holders
of this ground, obtained the following crushings,
principally from the surface block;

These returns show an average of nearly loz
odwt to the ton. Babtie and Co. subsequently
abandoned it, and for a considerable time this
ground remained without an owner. In the
early part of 1804, it was again taken up, since
which the following crushings have been obtained
from the old workings :

The above shows an average of nearly 10 dwts
to the ton. It seems a pity that ground, the last
four crushings from which havegivcn such yields,
should have its workings left for the swallows
to quietly build their nests in, yet such is the
case in the present instance. Following on
north, is a short stretch of ground, of which
little is known, further than that it contains
stone in almost unlimited quantities, worth from
three to five dwts to the ton. The next and
last claim southward, of which any intelligence
is obtainable, is that known as M’Kinney and
M’Naughton’s. This ground has been very
good; it was steadily worked for six or seven
months, giving, during the whole time, from 50 to
60 tons per week. The books of the claim were
burnt in the great fire of December, 1862, con-
sequently a detailed account cannot be rendered,
but Mr M’Naughton states, that the yield was
certainly not less than an average of 16dwts to the
ton, all through. According to this, the gross pro-
ceeds of the claim, in cash, woul d exceed £4,000.
This promising claim had to be abandoned, in
consequence of inability to conquer the water.
In No. 1, north, gold has likewise been ob-
tained in very considerable quantities, but, as
in the Prospecting Claim, and No. 1, south, the
work has been of a very irregular character.
What the result of this work was, is not known,
but it is certain that some good crushings were
obtained. Like the Prospecting Claim, and No.
1, south, it too was abandoned, and re-taken up
in the early part of 1864, when the following
crushings were obtained from the old workings.

No 2, north, otherwise known as the Great
Eastern Claim, has undoubtedly been, up to the
present time, the most important on this line.
It was marked out by Messrs M’Farlane, M’-
Callum, Courrier, and Taylor, at about the same
time as the Prospecting Claim, namely Septem-
ber or October, iB6O. The cement that had
been taken from the surface of this claim, be-
fore M I arlanc and Co. came into possession,
had given a yield ranging between 1 and 8 ozs
to the ton. Payable stone was obtained in the
claim, within two feet of the surface. Not far
from this, quartz was obtained, and in consider-
able quantities too, that gave a yield of 12 ozs
■to the ton. This block of stone has been taken
out the whole length of the claim, down to a
depth of 45 feet, at which level it ran out; it
had a northern dip, a western underlay, and
.averaged from 12 to 15 feet in thickness. In
some parts it attained the width of 25 feet. It is
estimated that this block of stone averaged in
this claim about 5 ozs to the ton, throughout.
A new making of the above-mentioned block
was first struck in a drive at a depth of 70 feet,
and the first crushing from it gave a yield of 5
ozs to the ton; the lode is 10 feet in thickness,
but up to the present time a face of 4 feet is all
that has been taken out, that being the best of
it. This system of working was carried on the
wdiole length of the claim, down to a depth of
90ft; a very large quantity of stone must there-
fore be left in this part of the claim, and al-
though the value of it is problematical, still the
probabilities are greatly in favour of its paying
well for working, more especially as it is laid bare
ready for knocking down. Payable quartz
■stopped in this lode at 90 feet. Sinking was
continued to a depth of 160 feet, at which level
operations had to be suspended in consequence
of the great influx of water. At this, the deep-
est point gained, the lode is 20 feet in thickness,
but prospecting operations on it will have to be
suspended until pumping machinery is on the
ground. A small leader only 2in in thickness
has been carried down with the shaft to the
bottom, producing good gold the whole way.
This claim has been driven from east to west
a distance of 70 feet, but no stone but the one

In consequence of the number of tons in some
instances not being obtainable the exact average
value cannot be given, but it is certain that it
was little short of 4 ozs to the ton. The claim
producing the above splendid results was
“jumped” in the latter part of the year 1860,
when the interlopers in the course of one night
<only removed stone that produced 80 ozs of gold.
This fact was brought to light shortly afterwards
in evidence given before the Court of Mines at
Weddcrburn, when Messrs M’Farlane and Co.,
doubtless very much to their satisfaction, re-
covered possession of their claim. North of the
Great Eastern one claim only appears to have
been worked to any extent. No certain infor-
mation of any description appears to be obtain-
able, but men who were in the neighbourhood
at the time of its being worked state that for
some time it paid well. The whole of the above-
mentioned ground south of the Great Eastern
Claim is now held under lease, and a company


is in course of formation for the purpose of
•erecting pumping machinery. Should they be
successful in the attempt, it will enable a fur-
ther exploration of the rich lodes that have
hitherto been abandoned, as no power short of
steam could overcome the water. Pending the
formation of this company work along the
whole of the line is suspended.
The following is extracted from a report of
this hill by J. S. Eobertson, Esq,, District Min-
ing Surveyor : —“On a very considerable portion
of the leased ground (between 7 and 8 acres)
and at a depth varying from 6in to 2ft from the
surface, exists a stratum of auriferous concrete,
•or v hat is termed cement. I estimate the quan-
tity of this from the various trial holes I have
had sunk at about 40,000 tons. This calculation
is based on the ground that the stratum will
average three feet throughout, although in
several places I found it to exceed 5 feet.”
Since the publication of the first edition of
this history the company alluded to above has
commenced operations so far as the prospect-
ing the ground is concerned. Two lots of over
]OO tons each of the cement lying on the sur-
face have been crushed, and the yield is found
to be over 8 dwts to the ton. Two trial lots of 5
tons each from the ground known as M’ Kay
and M’Haughton’s claim have likewise been
crushed, one giving a return of 8 and the other
iSdwts to the ton. It is intended to erect a
pumping and crushing plant on the ground, at
a cost of about £3,000 or £4,000. The capital
•of the company is £16,000, in 16,000 shares of
£ I each; 12,000 shares paid up to 12s 6d each
have been paid for the ground, leaving an
amount of £8,500 available for the erection of
machinery, and working the mine. The writer
takes leave of tbe Surface Hill Co., Godwin
Eeef, with the advice Soyez ferme ; let them
follow it and their success is certain.


‘■Chapter 111.
THE POVERTY REEF.
'The next lines for consideration are two of
■a group in the flat westward of the township,
namely, the Poverty and the Morning Star.
There is little doubt hut that these two,
■correctly speaking, are one and the same reef,
hut as claims were taken up at different times
in hoth names, it is proposed to notice them
separately; hut, likewise, to save confusion, it
is the intention to limit the notice of the “Pov-
erty,” to the lease held hy Messrs Baragwanath
and Samuel, leaving the remaining claims to be
included in the Morning Star. The principal
part of the work on this ground has been done
in what was originally known as ISTo. 2, north,
sand which immediately abuts on No. 8, north,
Morning Star. It was first taken up in Mayor
June, 1860, hy Messrs Lynn and party; hut
after working hut a few weeks and sinking two
shafts to a depth of about 30 feet, they regis-
tered it, and left the district for a “rush” to Em-
power. As operations had not been carried on
for a period of three months, the registration
was, of course, illegal, and it was almost imme-
diately taken possession of hy Messrs Baragwan-
;ath and Samuel. Immediately on getting
possession, work was commenced in one of the
-shafts sunk hy Lynn and party, which was con-
tinued to a depth of about 120 feet, or near to
the original water-level. At this point it be-
came apparent that all operations had hitherto
been carried on too far east ivard, another shaft
was therefore commenced about 80 feet west of
the former, which was sunk to a depth of 135 ft.
At this level, a body of stone was discovered 5
feet in thickness, having an eastern underlay,
;a trial crushing from which of 4 tons gave a


yield of 3 dwts to the ton. Another trial of
18 tons was then sent to the mill, and gave 6
■dwts to the ton ; and a third crushing of 17
tons yielded 3 dwts to the ton. Although these
yields were not large, they were still sufficiently
so to encourage further prospecting, hut from
the great influx of water at the level at which
stone was first discovered, it was clearly appar-
ent that nothing could he attempted at a greater
depth, without the aid of steam-pumping
machinery. The erection of a steam-engine
with pump and winding gear attached was
therefore determined on. But before doing so,
it was thought desirable to alter the tenure
■upon which the ground was held, by obtaining
a lease; this was done, including in the lease
the neighbouring claim north, which had been
purchased by Messrs Baragwanath and Samuel,
for the sum of £lO. The lease was applied for
on the 17th of February, 1862, and was duly
enacted on the 2nd July following, and it may
be worthy of remark, that this was the first min-
ing lease applied for and obtained in this dis-
trict; the extent of ground so held in this in-
stance is about two acres and a half. The
machinery that was eventually erected, consisted
of a steam-engine of twelve and a-half horse
power, winding gear and pump with six inch
lifts, being attached thereto, the engine being,
according to the opinion of the proprietors, cap-
able of draining the mine to a depth of 40 ft.
The entire plant has involved an outlay of £3OO.
On the completion of the machinery, prospect-
ing was immediately commenced below the
'Original water level, on the body of stone already
discovered. A correct and perfectly detailed
account of the work done on the above mentioned
stone cannot be given, a portion only of it being
obtainable, but the total yield, according to the
■opinion of Mr Baragwanath, is about 600 tons
•of stone, giving about 400 ozs of gold. In this
ground, as in most other claims in its immediate
neighbourhood, there is no regular well defined
lode, but a succession of blocks of stone, vary-
ing in size from sto 27 feet in thickness; some
•of these blocks are payable, others mot so, but
there is every probability that the most valu-
able yet discovered, is one that has been found


at the 195 feet level. This block of stone has
been driven through, proving its width to be 27
feet. A crushing of stone, of 9 tons, from this
•drive, gave a yield of 9 dwts to the ton, but
stone of afar higher value is confidently be-
lieved to remain. Work on this body of stone
is at present suspended, as the shaft being but
200 feet in depth, it will be necessary to sink
it a greater depth first for the purpose of
‘effecting drainage.
In the assessment of the neighbouring claims
for drainage, the proprietors of this ground
(have at various times been involved in tedious
•litigation, in consequence of the defective and
uncertain character of the drainage laws; the
■expensive operation of sinking deeper has
therefore been suspended, pending the amend-
ment of the laws in question. Before the stop-
page of the works the proprietors, wishing to
■“ascertain as correctly as possible the value of
the stone under water, obtained from the great-
est depth that could be reached, and at various
places along its whole width, seven prospects,
••and in every instance the result was such as to
•convince them that the richest stone that the
-claim has yet produced, is inferior in value to
that which has yet to be taken out. For the pur-
pose of effecting drainage of the various neigh-
bouring claims, on what is known as the Morn-
ing Star lino, two drives have been put in west-
ward at the 157 and 195 feet levels —their length
being about 80 and 90 feet respectively ; a con-
siderable amount of prospecting, in the shape of
■drives, &c., has likewise been done, but the re-
sult has not been such as to call for any special
motice. In the opening up of this mine much
■praiseworthy energy, perseverance, and enter-
prise has been shown.; and, including the cost
■of labour, machinery, and mining tools, a sum
■of money exceeding £B,OOO has been expended.
It is therefore gratifying to know that the pros-
pects opened up are such, as to hold out toler-
■ably certain hopes to the proprietors of ere long
■reaping literally a golden reward. A description,
of the neighbouring ground, known as the
■“Morning Star,” will form the subject of the
srext chapter.


Chapter IY.
THE MORNING STAR.
The present chapter will comprise a des-
cription of the Morning Star Eeef, coupled with
the southern claims of the “Poverty.” The
ground where the Morning Star Eeef was dis-
covered, was first taken up by Messrs Ford and
party for alluvial working. A grant was ob-
tained for a prospecting claim on 3rd November,
1860, and it is very doubtful whether Ingle-
wood has hitherto produced a piece of ground
of similar area, that has produced so large an
amount of gold, with so small an expense of
labour. The amount of gold produced from
these surface workings cannot be given, as the
lucky finders have long since returned to the
“old country,” there to enjoy the fruits of their
labour. Eeports are prevalent in this, as in
every other instance, of great finds, that are
doubtless gross exaggerations, but putting these
-out of sight, it is unquestionably certain that
many thousands of pounds were netted from
this ground by the puddling machine alone.
It may be mentioned that it is the opinion of Mr
John Ford, who is brother to the original pros-
pector, that the gold yielded from the surface,
produced-by sale, cash to the amount of over
£7,000. This surface has been taken from
nearly the entire area of the claim, to a depth
of 5 to 6 feet, and quartz was found at a depth
of about 12 or 14 feet below it. The stone in
this claim was payable from the first; there is
no regular lode, but as in -the “Poverty” line,
a succession of blocks which have been worked
to a partial extent -from the level at which sto' e
was first discovered, down to water mark, namely,
a depth of 125 feet. The first of these blocks was
in some parts exceedingly rich, the yield in some
cases reaching as much as nearly 10 ounces to
the ton, as for instance oh October 24th, 39 tons
gave the fortunate proprietors a cake of gold
weighing 3670zs lOdwts 12grs. The block from
which these splendid results were obtained was
from five to six feet in width,having an eastern un-
derlay and a northern dip. The second block dis-
covered in this ground, although not so rich as


the first, was still sufficiently so to maintain
for the claim a first class reputation. The
following is the result, which is believed to be
;as nearly as possible complete—

The above shows an average value of the
whole produce of the claim, to be within a
fraction of 2oz 13 dwts to the ton. This
•claim is now held on lease, including
in it the ground originally known as the
Prospecting claim, Poverty lieef, nearly the whole


of the gold produced, has, however, been ob-
tained from Messrs Ford’s original claim. The
number of shafts that have been sunk cannot
be given, the whole area of the claim being
dotted with them, the result of the work having
proved that stone in large bodies exists to a
width of over 150 feet. Three shafts have
been sunk to the water-level, but no stone has
been taken from below that depth. When the
history of this claim is considered, the reader
will doubtless imagine that the proprietors have
every chance of a brilliant and profitable future.
The next claim southward, although marked
out four months subsequent to Messrs Ford’s,
has always been known as the Prospecting Claim
of the Morning Star line, in consequence of
Messrs Ford having marked theirs-—as mentioned
above—for alluvial working. Anything ap-
proaching a complete history of this claim can-
not be given, the original proprietors having long
since left the district; it is, however, known
that the marker out of the ground was an Ital-
ian, named Melgovirch. The claim has been
sunk on down to the water-level, at which depth
stone in large quantities exists, bearing gold,
and presenting every appearance of improving.
Stone has been crushed from various blocks and
at various depths, but a complete list cannot be
furnished, as not only the party for whom it
was crushed, but likewise those who crushed it,
have long since left the district; records of the
following crushings have however been obtained,
which will perhaps furnish some idea of the
average value of the whole.

The foregoing portion of the yield of this claim
gives an average of loz Idwt to the ton. In
this claim, as in the neighbouring one north, a
great number of shafts have been sunk, and
with the like result of revealing the existence
of stone in almost fabulous quantities. The surface
washed from this claim has likewise been of an
exceedingly valuable character, but, like the
quartz, all authentic records ' of its value have
never transpired; this is to be regretted, but
the fact is at the time of its being obtained,
quietness was absolutely necessary for the pro-
prietors, as such was the disturbed state of
things that any ground known to be valuable
was sure to receive a most unwelcome visit from
some brigade of “jumpers.”
No 1 south is a claim that remained entirely
unproductive of profitable results until very
lately. The first proprietors •of this ground,
after a considerable amount of work, abandoned
it as useless, and for some time it remained
without owners. It was subsequently taken up
by the party at present holding possession, but
their first operations Were entirely unattended
with profit, the work having been done too far
to the east; subsequently some rubble stone
was found on the surface some distance further
west, from which fair prospects could be ob-
tained, and a trial crushing proved it worth about 9
dwts to the ton ; but after about 10 tons had
been obtained it run out to so small a size as to
make it impossible to work it with profit. It
was determined, however, to >ink a shaft on this
spot. One was accordingly put down, and at a
depth of 70ft a leader about one inch in thick-
ness was discovered, from which a very excel-
lent prospect was obtained; this stone gradually
made out till it obtained a thickness of from a
foot and a half to two feet. The first crushing
from it gave the very satisfactory result of
nearly 3ozs to the ton. This body of stone, the
same as all hitherto found on this line, underlays
east, and has a northern dip ; up to the present
time it has been worked a length from north
to south of about 70 feet by a depth of about 15
feet. The following is the result—

The above crushings show an average of 18dwts
7grs to the ton. An opinion appears to be en-
tertained by the proprietors of this claim that
much profitable work remains to he done at
shallower depths than the above mentioned
workings. The length of this claim when first
marked out was not more than 50 feet; the
ground south of it subsequently became aban-
doned, when the present holders increased its
size to its present dimensions. Up to this time
the ground so pegged in, and which had always
been known as No. 2, south, had produced the
following crushings :
No, 2, South.

The claim at present known as No. 2, south, is
one of 400 feet. Two shafts have been sunk on it,
each of them to considerable depths, but nothing
has been discovered to compensate for the
amount of labour given. This claim terminates
the workings at the southern end of this line.
It has been stated that the first claim marked
out on this line was known as Ford’s Alluvial
Prospecting Claim; the ground, as therein stated,
is north of the Prospecting Claim for the Morn-
ing Star Reef, and is likewise known as Nos. 1
and 2, north. The next claim therefore that re-
mains to be noticed is No. 3, north. This claim
undoubtedly takes rank among the most impor-
tant in the district. It will be seen from the
list of crushings that this claim has produced,
that it has maintained its character nearly from
the commencement of its being worked, to the
present time. The ground was marked out in
the latter part of the year 1860, by a party of
brothers named Needs, all of whom, with one
exception, still retain possession. The first

shaft sunk was considerably too far westward;
the second was put down 55ft eastward of it, and
in a drive 10 feet to the east, at a depth of about
60ft, stone was discovered, a trial crushing from
which of three tons, gave 12dwts 12grs of gold.
At this time, carting and crushing was a guinea
per ton ; at such a rate a yield of this sort, of
course, would not pay, and the claim was in con-
sequence registered for three months. On re-
turning to work at the expiration of the term
of registration, the proprietors found their right
to a portion of the north end of their claim
disputed by the holders of No. 4; a considerable
amount of vexatious litigation followed, which,
however, resulted in favour of the proprietors
of No. 3. This litigation, of course, much im-
peded operations, but at its termination, work
proceeded with vigour. It would be impossible
to give a detailed account of all the work that
has been since done, the ground being for a
width of over 120 feet, a complete mass of small
blocks of stone; these blocks, have, of course,
varied in value, some having been of very great
richness, as, for instance, that from which a
crushing was obtained on May 21, 1862, when
an average of 21 ozs to the ton was the result.

correct and complete account of the yield of this
claim Tons ozs dwts grs

The above list shows an average of a trifle
over loz 3dwts 15grs to the ton. In additior
to the above, about 200 ozs of gold were pro
duced in the year 1861, but the number of ton
crushed to obtain it is not now known, as m
account of the claim was then kept by the pro
prietors; if added, however, to the above list,
the general average would not be materially
altered, it having been of much about the same
value. The crushing of December 23, 1863,
■deserves special notice, it having been taken from
below the water-level, and stone of similar value,
in large quantities, is confidently believed to re-
main. This stone cannot at present be worked,
in consequence of the pumping engine of Messrs
Daragwanath and Samuel having stopped work,
pending the revision of the laws relating to
draining. It may here be observed, that con-
siderable difficulty has always been experienced
in draining this line; this arises from the fact
of there being no regular lode through which
the water might flow; the blocks which exist
along the entire length of the line that has been
worked, being, in most cases, entirely discon-
nected, and, consequently, the draining of one
block will have little or no effect on another
that may be on the same level with it. It
appears to be the opinion of most of the old
practical miners on this reef, that the only way
that a really effectual drainage may be obtained,
as by frequent cross-cuts, and pumping at a
level, considerably below that required to be
worked. The above-mentioned ground is at
present held under lease, having included in it
the claim, originally known as No. 1, north.
Poverty, which claim immediatej abuts it oa
its eastern boundary.
No. 4, north, has likewise been a claim of con-
siderable importance; but the first proprietors
have long since left the district, an authentic
account of the work then done, is therefore lost;
the crushing machine likewise, that reduced the
first stone, has long been removed; all traces
Therefore of what the stone produced up to July,
1863, are gone. Since that time the claim has
produced the following results—

The above shows an average for the last two
years of a trifle over 11 dwts llgrs to the ton ;
but it must be borne in mind in reference to
this claim, that the above does not, by any
means, describe the average of its total produce,
the stone produced from it at first having been
by far the richest portion. The first payable
stone was obtained at a depth of about 40 feet.
The claim has been sunk down to water, and
payable stone proved to exist there; at this
level likewise the stone obtained in No. 3, in
December, 1863, was traced to within six feet of
the southern boundary of the claim, when it was
lost in the water, in consequence of the block,
like all others in this ground, having a northern
dip. In the neighbouring claim north, namely
No. 5, gold was first obtained in January, 1861,
at a depth of 45 feet. For the first year, no
regular account was kept of the crushings, but
the proprietors estimate them at 25 » tons,
with a yield of about 440 ozs. The most valu-
able stone that this claim has produced, was ob-
tained during the first year of its being worked,
the average yield having reached as high in
some cases as 17 ozs to the ton ; this stone was
taken from a depth of iOO feet. As in all other
claims on this line, there is no regular lode, but

The above shows an average of loz 4dwts 7grs
to the ton. In the course of working, auriferous
stone has been proved to exist in this claim for
a width of one hundred and fifty feet. At the
water level, namely, at a depth of about 130 feet,
a body of stone exists, about 20 feet in thickness ;
it was from this lode that the last three crushings
in the above list for the year 1863, were taken;
a large amount of stone of similar value still re-
mains, but it will be impossible to obtain it un-
til the claim is properly drained.
In No. 6 north, gold was first discovered at a
depth of 95 feet, but on trial the stone proved
worth not more than about 2dwts to the ton;
this not being payable prospecting was con-
tinued, when another body of stone was found
at a depth of 110 feet. This stone has been
worked down to a depth of 137 feet, with the
following result:—

amalgamated. In No. 7 four shafts have been
sunk, two of them to the water level. Gold was

blocks in this ground average in thickness about
four feet. No prospecting has been done in this
claim at a shallower depth than ninety-five feet.
Of the ground known as No. 8, no regular
account has been kept, more than is sufficient to
ffiiow that gold has been obtained to the amount
of 159 ozs 18 dwts 5 grs; the number of tons
of stone from which this was obtained is not
known, an average value of what the claim has
produced, cannot therefore be arrived at. In
about the middle of the year 1864, a steam-
pumping plant was erected on this claim; but
after working only a week or two operations
were stopped, in consequence of a want of funds.
It stood inactive for some months, when it was
sold, and moved off to another part of the dis-
trict; this was much to be regretted, as appear-
ances in this claim at the water-level point to
the extreme probability of there being first-rate
paying stone at deeper levels, there having been
ns much as 15dwts to the dish washed, at a
point not far from where operations were dis-
continued. The last claim on this line, namely.
No. 9, north, has had two shafts sunk on it, both
of them to the water-level. In this claim, it
•■appears there are two distinct lines of stone,
from each of which gold in paying quantities
has been obtained. Gold was first discovered
■at a depth of 127 feet, in what is known among
the proprietors as the eastern run. The claim
has produced the following crushings; the
three first having been taken from the eastern
line

The above list shows an average of a little
more than 7dwts 14grs to the ton. The removal


of the pumping plant from No. 8, was par-
ticularly unfortunate for this claim, as the best
prospects that it has produced, hare been taken
from below the water-level. Stone remains in
this claim that is confidently believed to be
worth half-an-ounce to the ton; but being below
water-level it is impossible to obtain it, as man-
ual labour for draining purposes is utterly use-
less. i t will be seen by the foregoing account
of this line, that all the claims have been worked
down to the water level, at which depth first
rate prospects present themselves in nearly
every instance ; the problem therefore, that now
remains to be solved, is, whether it is better to
continue the present mode of working, or one of
a more extensive character, by which, by the
aid of powerful steam machinery, depths may be
explored unattainable by hand power.
Since the publication of the first edition of
the present history, ttie claimholders of the
Morning Star Eeef have given their opinion
with respect to the question in the latter part of
the last paragraph, by bestirring themselves for
the formation of a Joint-Stock Company, for the
purpose of efficiently working their ground. The
company is at present but in embryo; in the
event of its being successfully launched, with
proper management it cannot fail in affording a
splendid profit to the shareholders ; and will
aid to a considerable extent in making the re-
putation of the district.


Chapteb V.
THE YELDHAM.
(POBMEELY NEW INGLEWOOD BEEP.)
This reef was first taken up under the latter
name in the early part of the year 1861, Messrs
J. Anderson and G. Oswald being the pros-
pectors. It is situated two or three hundred
yards back in the scrub, eastward of Dusty Town.
Gold was first obtained on the surface, from au
outcrop of stone, but in very limited quantities,
nothing in fact to induce the belief that it would
pay for crushing, but it was evident that a reef
existed there, and a shaft was accordingly sunk,
but no crushing was attempted until a depth of
150 feet had been reached. At this level two
tons were sent to the mill as a trial, and pro-
duced 4dwts 9grs to the ton. The next trial
of 4 tons was taken from a depth of 80 feet;
at this level it was poorer still, yielding only 2
dwts 8 grs to the ton. The shaft was eventually
sunk to a depth of 168 feet. At 163 feet water
was r eached, the great influx of which prevented
all further prospecting, and the prospectors,
despairing of getting payable quartz at a
shallower depth, abandoned it in September,
1862, not however before they had become con-
vinced that a valuable reef existed at a greater
depth. This belief had been strengthened by
having satisfactorily proved, after considerable
trouble by taking bearings with flag staffs, that
the reef was a continuation of the celebrated
Maxwell’s. This reef was again taken up in
August, 1863, this time under the name of the
Yeldham. Gold was again found on the sur-
face a short distance north of the shafts sunk
by the first holders ; atrial crushing of two tons
yielded 3oz to the ton. The following list of
crushings were taken from the surface down to
a depth of about 50 feet;—

Being an average of nearly 13 dwts 2 grs to

The above stone was taken from a length
along the reef of about 30 feet by a depth of
50 feet, the average thickness being eighteen
inches. Since the clearing out of this patch of
golden stone, the experiences of the party who
worked it, appear very much to match those of
the first holders, namely, that a well defined
reef here exists, with only one break from the
surface down to the water, of an average thick-
ness of nearly three feet, the value of the whole
ranging between two and six dwts to the ton.
At water-level the reef is 3 feet in thickness,
with a tendency to increase in size, its value
being sdwts to the ton, its formation is of the
most perfect order, having a sandstone wall on
one side, and slate on the other, the lode has a
western underlay, and southern dip. What
this ground may be eastward is not known, as
no driving has been executed. A drive has been
put into the west a distance of about 80 feet,but
the labour was not rewarded by the discovery
of fresh stone. The general opinion appears to
be, that it is at a greater depth than has yet
been attained, that the lode will be found that
is to pay for the labour that has been expended
on the claim. A number of claims have been
taken up on this line, both north and south of
the prospecting claim, but all of them are now
either abandoned or registered, no profitable re-
sults having accrued from the labour expended
on them.
Towards the end of the year 1865, this ground
was for a second time abandoned, the owners
having arrived at the conclusion that what
they were searching for was too far below water,
to be within their reach without the aid of
machinery; but the time is doubtless not far


•distant when by the aid of a steam pumping
-plant, this reef will take its place among the
established and jpaying lines of the district.
Chapter YI.
THE COLUMBIAN REEF.
The far-famed Columbian, the reef that,
above all others, made many of us for a time
break the tenth commandment, now claims our
attention. The prospecting claim, and No. 1,
north, were marked out on the 30th of Novem-
ber, 1859, by Messrs Heron, Wright, Wheeler,
and St John, who, after a long and unsuccessful
career in alluvial mining, were crossing the
scrub, in search of a fresh field for their labour,
when they accidentally discovered gold in a
reef, cropping out from the surface. For some
months, they were unsuccessful, the quartz was
poor, and the writer well remembers the whole
of No. 1, north, being offered for sale by the
proprietors for £5O. This claim'was jumped by
a party of Germans, just as rich quartz was
discovered in the prospect claim, the jumpers
were ejected, the rightful owners took possession
of their property, followed up by the discovery
made in the prospect claim, into the claim they
had recovered possession of, and ultimately ob-
tained the following magnificent result from
the two claims together.

The average valne of the stone produced from
this claim cannot be given, as in many instances
the number ©f tons crushed was not kept an
•account of, but it is beyond a doubt the highest
by far that has been produced from any claim
in the district; in the eight crushings where the
account of the number of tons has been preserved,
an average value is seen of over ll|ozs to the
ton. The total produce of the claim has real-
ised the large amount of £63,348 4s.
The following details of the workings of these
two claims have been already published in
Dicker’s Mining Ilecord, the correctness of
which is guaranteed by Mr Wright, one of
the shareholders .: —“This line of reef has proved
for a time, one of the most productive lodes in
the colony, and attracted considerable attention
by its turning out, rather more than two years
ago, a cake of amalgamated gold weighing nc
less than 2,316 ozs. the produce of only 22 tons
of stone. The grant of the prospecting clain
was obtained on the last day of November, 1859
and the first crushing from the surface, gavt
about 6 ozs to the ton. It proved to be merelj
a disconnected spur, and, following north, it rat
out at a depth of about 12 feet. The next claim,
known as No. 1, north, sunk a shaft forty feet
in depth, and by cross-cutting struck a large


body of auriferous stone, that did not prove very
remunerative. The latter claim was then regis-
tered for three months, but, before the expiration
of that period, the prospecting claim had met
with another body of stone cropping out on
the surface, a little distance west of the first
leader they worked. It took something oi the
form of a wedge, the small end only projecting
into the prospecting claim. It dipped north,
and underlaid east, and in No, I it ran out at a
depth of fifty feet at the south end, and at the
north end of the same claim, at ninety feet. The
lower portion of the lode, where it had termin-
ated, had almost the appearance of black slag.
No. I sunk a shaft on their south boundary,
to a depth of about twenty-four feet, to inter-
sect the lode, and the first ton gave a return of
274 ozs. Another shaft of about twenty feet to
the north was then put down, and the next
22 tons, taken out from between the two, yielded
the monster cake of gold already referred to.
The next 80 tons gave an average of 50 ozs to
the ton. Some of the richest stone was taken
from spurs underlying west, and running into
the larger body, although not extending any very
great distance from it. As it went north, the
lode increased in thickness, with a proportion-
ately diminished yield, for the most part not
less than 10 ozs to the ton, and even at the
thickest portion, (10 feet,) giving 6ozs to the ton.
On the prospecting claim, a shaft has been sunk
to a depth of 284 feet, and a cross-cut has been
driven east one hundred and twenty five feet,
without any important results having been
attained. The expenditure in these two claims
would be altogether about £4,oo' \ One dividend
declared amounted to £3,265 16s 5d per fourth
share, the largest, it is imagined, ever declared
in the colony.”
The block of stone that proved so rich in No.
1, was very soon traced into Nos. 2,3, and 4,
but diminishing in value as it ran on northward,
the average of the yield in No. 2 being rather
more than 4ozs 2dwts, and that of No. 3, a trifle
over 3ozs to the ton. The Inglewood Advertiser
of January 24th, 1862, in a report of No. 2, north,
gives the yield as 10,068 ozs of gold, the produce
of 1,413 tons of stone. This statement is in-


'correct, both as to the number of tons and the
•amount of gold produced. The following re-
turns are taken from the books of the company,
in the possession of T. K. Johnston, Esq., Bank
•of Ne?r South Wales, the correctness of which
have been vouched for by Mr J. Kirwan, one
of the shareholders.

bat furnished the following particulars. The
claim was purchased by himself and C. Davey,
about a month before the valuable discoveries
were made in the prospecting claim, for the sum
of £l5; five months after the purchase, they
obtained payable gold. The best stone has been
obtained at a depth of about 100 feet; sinking has
been carried on to a depth of 240 feet, which
was found to be the water level; the reef at
this depth is 2 feet in thickness, but the for-
mation of the lode is so perfect and well defined,
that the belief is confidently entertained, that
valuable discoveries will be made at a greater
depth. Prospecting in this claim has shown
the reef to vary in thickness from 2 to 12 feet.
in the parts that have been worked the ston e
has been taken out from one end to the other
and it is confidently asserted that many thou-’
sands of tons of stone still remain, worth
certainly not less than from four to nine dwts
to the ton.

Gold has likewise been obtained on this reef
in Nos. 6,7, 8, but the amount in the aggregate
has not, it is supposed, paid the expenses of
working. No accounts that can be relied upon
are apparently obtainable, further than that
quartz worth 2ozs to the ton has been obtained
in various parts of the three claims. The fol-
lowing particulars relating to this portion of the
reef, are taken from a report of J. S. Robertson,
Esq., Mining Surveyor for Inglewood:—“The
quartz lode in No. 6, north, is twelve feet in


width, and the last results obtained prior to be-
ing compelled to register, on account of the
water, averaged near 2 ozs to the ton. The
width of the reef in the various claims varies
from 4to 12 feet. The ground north of No. 6
has not been proved, in fact, unless steam pump-
ing machinery is employed, it will be impossible
to test the value of the same. Hitherto the
whole of the claims have been worked by hand
and horse labour, and have reached the water-
level, but in my opinion the stone that is known
to exist in this ground will ultimately be found
to be a continuation of the rich lode already
worked in the claims farther south. The water-
level averages in depth, (in proportion to the
rise of the hill,) about 240 feet.” In closing the
account of this celebrated reef, it may be ob-
served that it was mainly owing to the great
discoveries made on it in 1860, that that im-
petus was given to quartz mining on Inglewood,
the result of which has been the discovery and
opening up of many of those reefs which have
made the district famous.
After the result already described had been
obtained, the whole line remained fora consider-
able time in a state of complete inactivity. To-
wards the end of the year 1864, the prospectus
of the Great Columbian Heef Gold Mining Com-
pany was issued. For a time all went “merry
as a marriage bellshares were taken up with
avidity, and everything pointed to the probabil-
ity of the company being a great success ; but
mismanagement for a time has stopped the pro-
gress of what may reasonably be supposed to be,
from the character of the reef, one of the most
promising mining speculations in the district.
An old, in fact a worn-out, plant of machinery
was purchased and re-erected; a proceeding,
according to the statement of the engineer wJio
was s nt to report on the machine, in direct
opposition to his advice; and the consequence
was, when the time came for commencing work,
the plant was found to be useless and unwork-
able, and the result was, that operations were
brought to a dead stand. Meetings were held
on various occasions, to take into consideration
the position of the company; at one of which,
held on December 14, 1865, the directory, from


-whose mismanagement so much 'evil had re-
sulted, according to the wish of the shareholders
consented to resign, and a fresh one was elected.
Up to the present time (1866), the new directory
has not commenced operations; they doubtless,
at starting, will find they labour under a great
•disadvantage; the fact of their predecessors in
office having uselessly squandered osmethinglike
five or six thousand pounds not being the least.
But one great and important fact still remains
for their satisfaction, namely, that the same
confidence is felt now in the value of the mine
as ever existed ; as, why should it not ? beyond
slabbing a shaft, and raising a few tons of stone,
a small portion only of which has been crushed,
the mine remains in the same condition as when
the company was first formed in 1864. Barring
the loss, then, occasioned by the late misman-
agement, the present directory are the guardians
■of as good a speculation as their predecessors
were when the company was first formed. It
is by adversity and trouble, that wisdom and
experience are often acquired. It is to be
hoped that the late disastrous events which
have tended to temporarily paralyze the G-reat
Columbian Reef Gold Mining Company will be
the means of showing the vital folly of appoint-
ing men to transact important mining business,
merely upon the strength of their supposed res-
pectability ; the same men, from ignorance of
the nature of the business they take in hand,
-being totally unfit for it.


'Chattee TIL
btjchanan’s beef.
This once celebrated reef was discovered '.l
the 23rd of February, 1860, by Mr Fobert Bu-
chanan, who marked out a prospecting claim
•of 180 feet, in conjunction with Messrs H,
Brown, T. Purdon, and T. Brown. There was
a good out-crop of stone along the whole of the
crown of the hill, and Mr Buchanan, on the
day of marking the claim, obtained good speci-
mens from it, from one end to the other. On
opening the ground, it was found to he a well-
formed body of stone, 2 feet in thickness; it
gradually increased in size down to a depth
of 40 feet, where it was nine feet in thickness,
when it began to decrease, until at about the
•depth of 80 feet, it had resumed the same pro-
portions as on the surface, thus forming a com-
plete diamond in shape; at 87 feet it .run oat.
Prom this body of stone a very large amount
-of gold was obtained. -Unfortunately, it is not
possible to give an account of the various crush-
ings in detail, as it appears that Mr Buchanan
destroyed his account books before leaving the
district, imagining, it is supposed, that they
were useless, but from fragmnts of these books
found in his tent after his departure, it has been
ascertained beyond a doubt, that the three first
crushings, consisting of 121 tons, produced 557
ozs 16 dwts of g6ld, being rather more than an
average of 4 ozs 12 dwts 4 grs to the tom An
inspection of the claim has shown that the
whole of this block has been removed, there
being a clear opening, the whole length, from
the surface, down to a depth of 87 feet. The
above mentioned block ran out like a wedge,
at the southern boundary of the prospecting
claim, the clearing out of the last of it pro-
duced 2 ozs 10 dwts per ton; the underlay of
this stone was westward. On sinking a few
feet, a new making was found, but the direction


of the underlay was now reversed; the new for-
mation was known as “the black reef,” from the
colour of the stone- It is, apparently, of great
size, and has been worked into about 12ft, but
the opposite side from that worked has never
been seen, as, after crushing four tons, the pros-
pectors left it, the proceeds being under an ounce.
Another shaft was then sunk, about 50 feet
westward of the old workings, to a depth of 120
feet, a drive was put in, and at about half-way
between the two shafts, a body of stone was
struck 8 feet in width; a trial crushing of four
tons proved this stone to be of similar value to
the .stone in the second making in the old work-
ings, and it has ever since undergone a similar
fate, namely, desertion. The western shaft has
been sunk to a depth of 190 feet, and, strange to
say, this is all the attention that this claim,
(once, one of the most important in the district,)
has ever since received. In IN o. 1, north, a con-
tinuation of the surface stone obtained in the
prospecting claim, proved of nearly equal value.
In this claim it was all cleared out, to a depth
of 58 feet, with results eminently satisfactory to
the shareholders. At this depth it ran out, as
it had done in the prospecting claim, but made
again at 74feet. The new making in this claim
likewise proved payable, and it has been worked
down to a depth of 100 feet, with a result from
the two blocks together as follows —the list is
not quite complete, but very nearly so
No. 1, north.

The correspondent of the Melbourne Argus,
in a report of this claim in 1862, states that—
“ln sinking the shaft as much quartz was ob-
tained without driving as gave a return of
£4,000.” One of the original proprietors is
still a shareholder, and on questioning him
with respect to the truth of this statement, he
gave it a flat contradiction. The present oppor-
tunity is therefore taken to correct this error.
In this, as in the prospecting claim, the same
want of enterprise and energy is apparent. Al-
though the claim has produced thousands of
pounds worth of gold, there it remains, with no
more work having been done in it than the mere
extraction of the stone that w r as known to be
valuable. In this likewise, as in the prospect-
ing claim, a prodigious amount of stone is left,
that would give a return of a of an ounce to the
ton. It may seem almost incredible, but the pro-
prietors state that no driving whatever has been
done in this claim, what the western block in
the prospecting claim may be in this, remains,
therefore, for future enterprise to prove.
In No. 2, north, payable stone was first struck
nt a depth of 75 feet, the lode w as subsequently
proved to be the same as the second making ip
No. 1; the surface lode which had proved so
rich in the prospecting claim and No. 1, became
both smaller and poorer in this. The stone
struck at 75 feet remained payable to a depth
of 195 feet, at which level the last crushing
produced 9 dwts to the ton; at 120 feet there
is a clear opening from the north end of this
claim to the southern boundary of that marked
out by the prospectors. It is much to be re-
gretted that no correct detailed account of the
yields of this claim has been preserved, but the
list of amounts, copied from brokers’
tickets for the sale of gold, although not by
any means all, are still sufficient to show' the
valuable character of the quartz extracted:
£sd £sd £sd

Wo. 3, north, has ndt, Tip to the present time,
proved payable. There is an unlimited amount
•■of stone which has only been prospected to hut
a very limited extent. On this claim there is
;a magnificent double shaft 246 feet in depth,
slabbed in first rate style to the bottom; but,
;as in all other claims on this reef, little or no
driving 'has -been done. Payable quartz has
been obtained in No. 2 to within twenty feet of
■-the southern boundary of this claim.
Of the ground south of the prospecting-claim,
little is known. In No. 1 a shaft was sunk 125
feet, when a reef was found 2 feet in thickness,
which on being tried, proved worth 6 dwts 7 grs to
tthe ton, -and this not being, it is supposed, up
fto the expectations of the shareholders, it was
;abandoned, and the claim at the present time
a-emams just as they left it. In No. 3, work
was not prosecuted sufficiently long even
do find stone. The water level averages accord-
ing to the rise of the hill 125 feet. The second
stage in the history of this reef yet remains to
Ibe sketched. On the 26th of May, 1862, a body
-of shareholders held their first meeting to
transact business under the title of Buchanan’s
Beef Company. At this meeting a resolution
was passed to the effect that a lease of five acres
be applied for, the said lease to commence with
No. 1, north, and proceed on south; and at sub-
sequent meetings it was further agreed to erect
a crushing and pumping plant, at the cost of
£1694. These resolutions were fully carried
out, and thus was started a company with
apparently as bright a prospect before them as
could have been wished, but the result would
almost lead to the supposition that some evil
genius in this case had had the disposal of
events, for in the short space of rather less than
a year, the whole affair was pronounced a most
miserable failure. Since that time grass has been
allowed to grow on Buchanan’s Beef, and the
goats remain in undisturbed possession. But
an examination of the company’s ledger and mi-
nute-book, somewhat solves the mystery, (for
a mystery the failure of this company un-
doubtedly has been.) For instance, it appears
that during the whole time the company were
in operation, they crushed little more than 700


tons of stone, and this was effected at a cost for
crushing alone of £712, and a further examination
of accounts, show, that for thirty weeks the
average weekly expenses of the engine were £l4
8s lid, while those of the claim were only £l2
14s 4d, that is to say, five acres of ground, that
had the reputation of holding unbounded riches,
were held, and worked, by three men and a
horse, and this ground having on it, at the same
time, one of the best crushing and pumping
plants in the district. With management such
as these figures show to have existed, the won-
der might have, indeed, been great, had the
company achieved success. The average value
of the quartz crushed by them, is not, however,
further known than that it ranged between a i
and an oz to the ton, amply sufficient to have
made it pay, by good management One other
fact, with respect to the operations of the com-
pany, is, to say the least, rather strange, namely,
that although in possession of a first-rate pump-
ing plant, the ground was not tried a single foot
deeper than it was when they came into posses-
sion, and this too, in the face of the fact of hav-
ing had a crushing from the deepest workings
inJNTo. 2, of ninedwts to the ton. At last, dis-
gusted with the state of things, the shareholders
caused the music of the stamps to stop, and
eventually sold off the whole concern, at a
ruinous sacrifice. Subsequently an attempt
was made to form a fresh company, but the
effort to carry the project through proved un-
successful. It is not the intention of this his-
tory to predict the success or otherwise of
projected mining speculations, but the follow-
ing concluding observations in the present in-
stance, are not considered out of place. The
visitor to this reef, on being shown over the
ground by the first shareholders, some of whom
are still residents on the spot, cannot fail to be
struck by the want of enterprise that has been
shown in working it from one end to the other.
The nature and extent of the work done for-
cibly reminds him of the days when men dug
holes and abandoned them, if, when upon im-
perfectly bottoming, a trial of a dishful did not
present the dazzling spectacle of a row of
nuggets for the result. Many of these holes


left with egg-shaped bottoms, have since pro-
duced fortunes to the moderately industrious
minor, and the probabilities are greatly in fa-
vour of this reef in like manner, at some future
period, showering fortune’s favours upon those
who are enterprising and industrious enough
to seek them.
Chapter YIII.
THE AMERICAN BEEF.
The reef bearing the above name is situated
about 200 yards west of the Buchanan’sEeef, and
was discovered about the same time by two
brothers named Cook. Although a very con-
siderable amount of work has been done on this
iine, there is very little really authentic infor-
mation obtainable respecting it, all operations
having ceased for some time, and most of the
working owners having left the district, the
prospectors being of the number. The history
of this reef will consequently be but a meagre
one, as it is not the intention to record anything
the authenticity of which cannot thoroughly be
relied on. Of the prospecting claim, the most
interesting fact in connection with it is the ex-
istence of what is known as a cross reef, that is
two reefs, the one intersecting the other. It
was immediately at the point of intersection
that the large yields were obtained that made
this claim at the time of its being worked one


of the most celebrated in the district, the first
25 tons crushed from it giving a yield of 271
ounces. This cross has been worked down to
the water level, paying splendidly the whole of
the way down. The gross yield is not known,
but it is certain that it amounted to something
considerable. One more statement with respect
to this claim may prove interesting to future
operators on this line. Messrs Cook and Co.
always asserted that they left in the water,
stone of equal value to anything they had taken
out above, and certainly the result of their last
crushing atwater levelbort them out in the state-
ment, it having been nearly a pound weight of
gold to the ton. The stone in this claim off the
cross is poor, not being worth more than from
3dwts to sdwts to the ton, but of this there is
an almost unlimited amount. In the ground
north of the prospecting claim the reef has been
traced to a considerable distance, but none of
the claims ever paid for the work expended on
them. Gold has been obtained in every claim
to No. 9, and stone in large quantities discovered,
but in no instance has it been worth more than
a few dwts to the ton. The value of the ground
south, as far as No. 7, corresponds very much
with that of the north, but in No. 7 some very
rich stone was found. It was discovered at a
depth of 75 feet in a leader eighteen inches
in thickness. A trial crushing from it gave a
result of %an ounce to the ton. The stone was
then worked upwards to within 40 feet from
the surface, the stone taken out averaged about
6ozs to the ton; from this level to the surface
the value of the stone was reduced considerably,
some of it giving however as much as three ozs
to the ton. The above mentioned leader was
one of a good perfect formation, having a slate
wall on the west, and sandstone on the east.
The dip was south, and the underlay east. The
average thickness from the surface down to a
depth of 80 feet was about one foot. At the
last mentioned depth it was found to run out.
A detailed account of the yield of the stone
above alluded to cannot be given, as accounts
were but imperfectly kept, but it is estimated
by one who was then a shareholder, and who
still lives in the district, to have been about 70


tons, yielding gold that produced cash to the
amount of about £6OO. This claim had been
sunk on down to 30 feet below the water level,
at which depth stone showing gold was again
discovered, but the proportions of the lode were
still small, not being more than eighteen inches
in thickness, and not sufficiently rich to induce
the prospectors to work it. This claim was
abandoned by its first holders before they had
held it twelve months. It may here be observed
that up to the time of the first abandonment
of this ground no prospecting in the shape of
cross-cutting had been performed beyond one
drive of not more than 20 feet to the east; of
the value of the ground westward, therefore, of
course nothing is known. Subsequently this
claim was again taken possession of and some
12 or 14 ounces of gold obtained; it was then
for a second time deserted, without, it is con-
sidered, having had any work done on it to call
for any particular mention.
Following on southward is another stretch of
ground, the value of which is reported by old
residents to be about equal to that between the
prospecting claim and JNo. 7. The next ground
southward, of which anything definite is known,
is what is called the southern prospecting claim.
The stone here cropped out of the surface, and
gave in some instances as much as three ounces
to the ton. The stone run out at about the depth
of 50 feet, but makes again and continues to
water-level—namely, 120 feet. The reef from
the surface down to that depth averages 10 feet
in thickness, the value of the whole having been
proved to be 4dwts to the ton. This would
seemiJlto present a splendid opportunity for
operations on a large scale, but the first owners
had to abandon it, the cost of crushing and
carting absorbing nearly the whole yield. Stone
of this value could, however, now be worked
with profit, the cost of crushing being at the
present time not more than half what it was
when the abandonment above spoken of took
place. Prospecting has been carried on south-
ward of the last mentioned ground a distance
of two or three hundred feet; but although the
course of the reef has been traced, nothing pay-
able has been found. The ground opened up.


and through, which the reef has been traced,
would measure from north to south a distance
of nearly one thousand yards. It is much to be
regretted that ground of such a promising
character as the above should remain unworked,
but such has been the case in the present instance,
for a very long time. The whole of the line,
as far as it has been opened up, is held under
lease ; it is one more example of that pernicious
and crying evil so prevalent in this district, of
large tracts of auriferous land bein ■ held un-
worked in the grasp of the speculator, to the
exclusion of numbers who might derive from it
a living, if not a competence. This class of
lessees of auriferous lands, as they now exist,
is a curse and an obstruction to the progress
of a mining district; and the sooner associations
are formed to compel them to employ labour in
accordance with the terms of their application
for the lease, the better for the welfare of all
concerned. It appears that there is some chance
that the lease under which the American and
Buchanan’s Beefs is held, will soon fall into
fresh hands. In the event of the ground hav-
ing fresh holders, the district and new lessees
may both very fairly be congratulated, provid-
ing always that the new occupiers are men who
will honestly work the mine ; for then they will
not only stand a chance of enriching themselves,
but the district at large will be greatly bene-
fitted by the regular employment of a number
of miners. Before closing the account of this
line, one more item of information may be ad-
duced for the encouragement of future pros-
pectors. In November, 1865, an old shaft was
taken possession of, that had been sunk just
outside of the northern boundary of the leased
ground, a short distance east of what is sup-
posed to be the “American” line. After work-
ing ashort time, a reef was proved to exist below
the water-level, from which prospects can be ob-
taind, equal to from 1| oz to 2 ozs to the ton.
At the present time of writing, prospecting is
being carried on ten feet above the water, at
which level the lode is eight feet in thickness,
and presents the appearance of being worth
about 6dts to the ton, the stone being of a
most promising character.


THE NIL DESPEEANDUM
Is situated on a gentle rise of the ground
about midway between the Buchanan’s and
American Reefs, where some beautiful speci-
mens were found in the early part of the year
1860. A number of claims were marked out for
the purpose of prospecting for a reef. In the
pro pectin g claim a small surface block was
discovered, extending to a length of 20 or >loft,
running out at about the depth of 12 feet, ibis
block did not average more than a couple of
feet in thickness, it was all taken out and
crushed, producing about an ounce to the ton.
After the above mentioned block was removed,
a shaft was sunk to a depth of about fifty feet,
but nothing further of any importance was dis ■
covered. Shafts were also sunk on about half-
a-dozen neighbouring claims, but as nothing of
an encouraging character presented itself, the
ground was abandoned. This ground is in-
cluded in the same lease as that by which the
American and Buchanan’s Reefs are held.


Chaptee IX.
THE BENDIGO EEEF.
Of the reefs westward of the town, the next
that comes under notice is the Bendigo. This line
is situated about ICO yards eastward of the nor-
thern claims of the “March,” and is in like man-
ner surrounded by the alluvial workings of
Potter’s Hill. The proprietors of this reef,
Messrs Farrow, Everett, Mumford and Flyn,
commenced operations as far back as October,
1860, their attention having been attracted to
the spot by the nature of the gold found on
Potter’s Hill, it having been of an exceedingly
ragged character, and intermixed with a large
proportion of specimens. Work was com-
menced by sinking a shaft a depth of 60 feet,
at which level it was driven eastward 60 feet.
A second shaft was then sunk, likewise to a
depth of 60 feet, and a drive put in westward
20 feet, which connected it with shaft No. 1.
This work revealed nothing of importance.
After this a drive 135 feet in length was put in
to the west at the 60 foot level in the first shaft;
at about midway a leader about three or four
inches in thickness was found, which on trial
proved worth about five dwts to the ton. This
stone for the time was passed over as being too
small to pay; the drive then to the end presen-
ted a succession of leaders, varying in thick-
ness from a few inches to a foot, all of which
gave gold to a certain extent, but not sufficient
to make it payable without the aid of machinery.
At the expiration of nine months, not having
met with anything payable, the claim was regis-
tered. During the period of registration, the
owners of the claim fossicked about in the
alluvial on the saijie ground, and in the course
of their work fell across a patch of stone on the
alluvial bottom, from which splendid specimens
were obtained, and 3 or 4 dwts to the dish was
washed, but the stone was not permanent, it
running out to mere threads at a depth of 5 or
6 feet. Ten tons of stone from this spot gave

-11 dwts to the ton, for which a prospecting
claim was obtained, the grant bearing date Oc-
tober, 1861. About twelve months after ob-
taining the grant, and after a variety of wort
had been gone through, it was determined to go
back to the spot where operations were first
■commenced, for the purpose of further testing
the value of the leader from which the ci'ushing
of 5 dwts to the ton had been obtained. In fur-
therance of this project a fresh shaft was com-
menced about 70 feet westward of the second
shaft; the leader, it will be remembered, was
found about midway, in its 135 feet west drive.
On further prospecting this leader, it was found
to make wider, and some fair payable stone was
obtained from it. It would be wearisome to the
reader to describe all the drives, blind shafts.
•&c., in this claim; over 2,000 feet of this kind
of work bear testation of the perseverance and
energy of the proprietors. All this work has
gone to prove the existence of large quantities
of stone, worth three or four dwts to the ton.
Stone of this character, if worked without the
aid of machinery, and ten or eleven shillings
per ton paid for crushing, is, of course, of no
value to the owners. This is the case in the
present instance, but a time is doubtless near
at hand when stone of this description will be so
worked so as to yield a handsome profit to those
engaged in it. The following list of crushings
have been obtained from various parts of the
claim, and a glance at it will be sufficient to
show with tolerable clearness the nature and
value of the ground.

The above yield shows an average of rather
over 5| dwts to the ton for the whole of the
stone that has been crushed from the claim.
The gold realized in cash, the sum of £506 1s ;
the expenses of the claim, including carting.
crushing, tools, powder, candles, &c., amounted
to £266 8s lid, deduct this from the gross re-
ceipts, leaves £239 12s Id, or £5O 18s, net pro-
fit for each fourth share. In No. 1, south, a
prodigious amount of prospecting has been done.
In the course of two years —during which time
work was vigorously prosecuted—over 2,000 ft
of sinking and driving was executed. In the
course of this work 4 shafts were sunk, in most
of which a depth of 150 feetwas reached ; this
at the time the work was done was the water-
level, but the pumps working on the March
Reef have considerably drained this ground.
The above-mentioned four shafts have been
cross-cut a distance of 200 feet at several levels.
and gold-bearing stone has been proved to ex-
ist in considerable quantities, from which crush-
ings at various times have been obtained, some
of which were of very tolerable value, whilst
other lots were not worth more than 3dwts to


the ton. A correct account of these crushings
has not been kept,but the shareholders from mem-
ory estimae them in the gross at about 100 tons,
giving a yield of 50 ozs. No regular lode has
been discovered, the stone existing in a suc-
cession of blocks, the last one reached is at the
level of the greatest depth attained, viz., 150
feet. This body of stone is about 5 feet in
thickness, and will give a yield of about 3 dwts
to the ton; stone of a similar value in large
quantities is known to exist in various other
parts of this claim. The above-mentioned
claims are the only two in which work of any im-
portance has been done; ground has been
marked out further south, and likewise further
north of the prospectors, but the work has been
of but a superficial character, and has long been
abandoned. It appears to be the opinion of
almost every man who has woi’ked on this
line, that a lode of extensive proportions exists
in this ground at a depth hitherto unexplored;
to effectually carry on the work necessary for
its discovery, machinery would be required, the
obtaining of which has not been within the
reach of those who have hitherto held the
ground. At present the whole of the claims on
this line appear to be begging for owners ; for
the sake of the benefit of the town it is
to be hoped that they will not long beg in vain.

Chapter X.
THE LEICESTER REEF.
The prospecting claim in the above-named
reef was marked out in the early part of duly,
1861, by Messrs Henderson, Hunt, Reading,
and Waverly, their attention having been drawn
to the spot for a reef, in consequence of their
finding good specimens whilst working the
alluvial close by. The reef was discovered at
the bottom of alluvial 7 feet in depth, and good
payable stone was found at the very commence-
ment, a trial of three tons giving a return of 5
ozs 3 dwts 12 grs. This lode of stone has been
worked to a depth of 135 feet, by a length along
the line of 150 feet, the southern end being the
portion of the claim remaining unworked The
stone has continued perfect and unbroken down
to a depth of 150 feet, averaging in thickness
for the whole distance between 7 and 8 feet,
giving the fortunate holders the following mag-
nificent list of crushings. The account is fur-
nished by Mr Gr. Henderson, who guarantees
the correctness of it.

This shows an average of nearly 1 oz to the
ton, for all the stone taken from this claim, from
the commencement up to the present time. Be-
yond the work necessarily entailed by the re-
moval of the above-mentioned stone, little has
been done in the ground. It has been driven
a distance of about 60 feet, but no stone be-
yond that worked has been found. The water-
level has not been reached, 150 feet being the
deepest point gained. At this depth the stone,
was not considered payable and it was, in
consequence, registered for three months, the
term of which has not yet quite expired.
The above comprised the history of the pros-
pecting claim, up to the time of the publication
of the present history, namely, January, 1865;
since that time the claim has changed owners.
Since the new proprietors have been in posses-
sion, the ground appears to have been workec
very imperfectly. Two or three hundred ounces
of gold, obtained from about as many tons oi
stone, got apparently by a sort of groping about
in the old workings, appears to be all that has
been done in the claim for the whole of the past
year, at the present time work being entirely
suspended. In fact, such is the dilatory man-
ner in which work is carried on in this once
rich claim, that nothing more is known of it
than Messrs Henderson and Co., the former
owners, were acquainted with, last September
twelvemonth.
No. 1, north, held by G-. North and Co., has
likewise been a very good claim. The reef was
first struck at a depth of 114 feet, when three

small crushings were obtained, which gave an
average of loz Sdwts to the ton, but the next
crushing gave a return of only 18 grs to the ton.
Efforts were then made to discover something
fresh, but sinking and driving to the extent of
about 200 feet failed to produce the desired
result. Work was then recommenced in the
old shaft, and the reef was followed down to a
depth of 145 feet, when good payable stone was
again obtained, a crushing from this part of 25
tons giving 76 ozs 1 dwt 12 grs of gold. The
stone was then systematically worked, with the
following very profitable results. The account
has been furnished by Mr Q-. North.

In the above account, the number of tons for
the third and seventh crushings are not known,
but they are believed to be about thirty, if this
number therefore, be added, an average will be
shown of nearly 17 dwts to the ton, for the
whole amount crushed. The whole of the ex-
penses incurred, including carting, crushing,
candles, ironmongery, &c., have amounted to
£l.lOO, deduct this from the gross cash proceeds,
and a clear not return to each fourth working
shareholder is shown of a little over £B4O. In
this claim, the reef, which lias an extraordinary
acute underlay, dips to the north sometimes very
sharply. The stone averages about twelve
feet in thickness ; sinking has been prosecuted
to a depth of 170 feet, which was found to be
the 'water-level. At the present time, operations
are suspended, the claim being registered.
No. 3, north, has had a considerable amount
of work done, but has not hitherto proved a
paying claim. In July, 1863, a crushing w r as
obtained of 41 tons, which gave 20 ozs of gold.
In this claim, a considerable body of stone has
been discovered about 80 feet westward of the
main line, from which a number of crushings
have been obtained at various levels, from the
surface down to 175 feet, which have given re-
turns ranging between 4|dwts and 10 dwts to
the ton, An unlimited amount of this stone
still remains in this claim. Nos. 2,3, 4,5, and 6,
comprising a stretch of 666 feet of reef, are at
the present time held under lease by Messrs
Johnson, North, Hadcliffe, Spence, Olerhead,
and J. P. Gray.
Nos. 1 and 2, south, amalgamated claims,
have sunk two shafts, one of them (the southern)
having reached water. This claim has not pro-
duced more than about thirty ounces of gold;
6 ozs of this was obtained from a small surface
leader, and the principal portion of the remainder
from stone at the water-level, the last crushing
of 16| tons giving to the ton. The
lode that this crushing was obtained from, is
from 8 to 10 feet in thickness, a good prospect,
therefore, lays before the proprietors of this
ground, as when pumping machinery is erected,
enabling them to work at a greater depth, the
claim can scarcely fail to prove a valuable one.


No. 3, south, has sunk two shafts and pene-
trated to water-level, namely, 160 feet. In this
claim the reef is Bft in width, from which 30 )
tons of stone have been removed from various
levels, giving in all 100 ounces of gold. This
claim was abandoned by the party that pro-
duced the above results about 18 months ago,
but has since been taken up again, but work
appears to be carried on in a very
languishing style, in fact, it may be said
that operations on this reef are in a state of sus-
pension from one end to the other. 4.11 claims
that have produced gold have been worked
down to water, and the proprietors at the pres-
ent time appear to be waiting for the erection of
a pumping plant to enable them to explore the
reef at a greater depth.
The above comprised the history of this
ground, up to the time of the first publication
of the present work. Since that time no work
of any importance has been done; a few small
lots have been crushed from the old workings
of No. 1 North, but the result w r as such as not
to materially alter the average value of the
total yield of the claim. The lease by which
Nos. 2,3, 4,5, and 6, north, was hold, became
forfeited, and a fresh one was obtained by
Messrs Radcliffe, Spence, and J. P. G-ray, in-
eluding in it No. 1, the intention of the pro-
prietors being to form a Joint Stock Company
for the purpose of properly working it. The
formation of a Joint-Stock Company, in the
present instance, is doubtless a right and ju-
dicious course, the ground containing stone in
almost unlimited quantities, that by the aid of
good machinery and proper management can-
not fail in producing a profitable return to in-
vestors in the enterprise. On reviewing the
circumstances of the earlier part of the career
of this line, the question might very naturally
be asked—How r is it that ground that has pro-
duced such splendid results has been allowed
to remain almost in a state of total inactivity for
nearly a year and a half ? It is a question that
has puzzled many in this district; the only solu-
tion that can be offered by the present writer,
is, want of capital, for obtaining the necessary
appliances for working and draining the ground.


For the sake of the district it is to be hoped
that this want will not much longer be ex-
perienced, but that very shortly the same busy
scene may be witnessed on this line, and the
same profits accruing, as in the earlier time of
its working.
Chapter XL
THE MARCH REEF.
The tract of ground that forms the western
boundary of the town now claims attention.
Here is to be found the most complete network
of reefs in the district, some ot which have
materially tended to establish the fame of Ingle-
wood as a first-class quartz producing district.
Conspicuous among them is that bearing the
name that appears at the head of this chapter.
The March Beef did not always bear its present
name ; its first title, it is believed,was that of the
“Prince Arthur.” It was afterwards taken up
by two brothers named Hunter, and during their
occupancy it was known as Hunter’s Beef;
but their operations were unimportant and un-
productive of profitable results, and it was very
soon for a second time abandoned. It even-
tually attracted the notice of Messrs Smith,
Jewell, Birney, and Dahl, who, after prospect-
ing on this line for a very considerable dis-
tance, eventually settled down on the ground
they at present occupy in March, 1862. The
claim was originally a prospecting claim of
250 feet, but the tenure upon which the ground
was held was subsequently changed, and it is
now held under lease. G-ood gold-bearing stone
was found about two weeks after work was com-
menced, in a small leader about two inches in


thickness, at 40 feet from the surface. On fol-
lowing this stone it was found to increase in
size southward, and on 27tk March, 1862, the
first 21 tons of stone that were obtained from
it on being sent to the mill, produced 13oz
19dwt 6grs. The lode was found at a greater
depth to split up, the one side underlaying west
and the other east; the western stone being that
from which the greater portion of the riches
yielded by this claim were produced. The
lode has been worked at various levels, from
40 down to nearly 200 feet, with the following
brilliant result.

This shows a fraction over an ounce and three
pennyweights to the ton, for the entire produce
of the claim. The lode has been worked in
widths varying from 12 to 25 feet.
A few months after payable stone was ob-
tained in this claim, the hand labor was sup-
plemented by a whim, but as greater depths
were reached this power was found to be insuffi-
cient, especially with respect to the water, the
level of which was found to be at first 130 feet;
and in the early part of the year 1864,
steam crushing and pumping machinery was
erected. This machinery consists of a hori-
zontal engine of about twenty horse nominal,
but capable of working up to a much greater
power; two batteries of stampers, each contain-
ing six revolving heads,and three pumps, one
for draining the mine, another for supplying
the crushing batteries, and a third for con-
veying the tailings into a shoot, by which with-
out further trouble they arecarried to a consider-
able distance clear of the machine. For some
time after the erection of the machinery the
quartz was raised by aid of a whim, but it was
subsequently resolved to enlist the services of
the iron horse for this purpose likewise; and on
Feb. 16th, 1865, work was commenced with a
donkey engine of five horse power, erected on a
turn-table, and in such a position as to make
its services available for every shaft on the
ground. The shafts on the claim are, four in.


ployed lias varied between ten and twenty-
five men, tbe
average being about 15. The
value of tbe
machinery on the ground, in-
eluding crushing plant, pumps, tram roads,
donkey engine for winding, and other mining
necessaries, is
estimated to be about £3,000.
Since the commencement of operations interest
in this claim has changed hands on two occa-
sions, the first having been the sale of half a
full share by Mr T. Dahl to Mr JN. M'Kay in
Sep., 1862; the
second took place in the early
part of the year 1865, when the interest of Mr
0. Birney, consisting of a full fourth share,
was bought by the company jointly.
The above is
the history of this claim up to
the month of March, 1865; since which time
the following work has been done.

number, one at cither end of the ground, each
of which is 190 feet in depth; one in the centre,
which is used principally as a pump shaft,
here a depth of 215 feet has been reached ;
and a fourth, a little eastward and midwa y
between the pump shaft and that at the nor-
thern end, which is used exclusively for the
purpose of the workmen ascending and descend-
ing the mine by the aid of ladders. The pump
mentioned above for draining the mine is con-
structed with a six inch plunger, and pipes of
seven inch bore. An estimate of the value that
this one claim has been to Inglewood, may be
better made when it is stated that the labor em-
692 234 8 0
This list of crushings shows an average of
nearly 7dwt to the ton. Nearly the whole of
this stone was obtained from a portion of the


lode hitherto entirely unworked, namely from
the 150 feet level, down to a depth of 200 feet ;
the reef the whole distance maintaining a thick-
ness of from 14 to 25 feet; the amount of
stone, therefore, left in this part of the claim
to operate upon is something immense. In addi-
tion to the above crushings, the pump shaft has
been sunk an additional 43 feet, making its pre-
sent_ depth 258 feet. At a depth of 200 feet
a drive has been put in to the east a distance of
40 feet, at which point the cap of an entirely new
body of stone was discovered, from which pros-
pects equal to at least l|oz to the ton were ob-
tained. The stone has a sharp underlay to the
east. A drive was then put in at a depth of 251
feet for the purpose of testing the value of the
newly discovered reef at that level. From the
acuteness of the underlay it was calculated
that at this depth the stone would be at least
90ft from the shaft; but unfortunately when
only 70 feet had been driven, the plunger
ease of the pump burst, and all operations had
consequently to be suspended. Before the acci-
dent happened, a drive had likewise been put
in to the west at the same level as the last men-
tioned drive, a distance of 50 feet. This part
of the claim was found to be veined with small
fiat spurs, thickly impregnated with what is sup-
posed to be arsenical pyrites. The interest in
this claim originally purchased by Mr N. M‘-
Kay, from Mr T.Dahl, has within the last few
months reverted back to the original holder.
THE UNITY COMPANY.
The Prospecting claim is bounded on the south
by that of the Unity Company. This ground was
originally known as Nos. 1,2, 3, and 4 amalga-
mated claims; the company at the present
time hold it under lease. The ground was taken
up and operations commenced in March, 1862,
the company being represented on the ground
by two working shareholders. Gold in paying
quantities was first discovered on October 25th,
1862, in a drive 70feet westward of the first shaft
sunk, at a depth of 126 feet. In the following
month 16 tons of stone was crushed, and gave
the very satisfactory yield of 220 z 18dwts of
gold. The lode from which this crushing was
obtained has been worked since, without inter-


mission, to the present time, during which it has
given the following splendid list of crushings :

The lode in this claim has been worked a
thickness varying from sft up to as much as 70
feet, the former having been its size at the
level at which it was at first discovered, gra-
dually increasing to the latter at a depth of
about 180 feet, at which level it has been con-
siderably worked. But, astonishing as it may
appear to the reader, 70 feet does not describe
the width of the lode in some parts of this claim ;
its full extent has never yet been found.
Along the whole length of the eastern wall,
stone in almost fabulous quantities still re-
mains. This is proved from the fact that the
writer, in the course of an examination of the
ground, saw a drive in this eastern wall of
about 12 or 15 feet, and still quartz con-
tinued without the slightest indication of termi-
nating. It would be utterly futile to attempt
to estimate the amount of stone that may yet
remain in this ground, suffice it to say that
for all practical purposes it is apparently with-
out limit. The un worked stone here alluded to
has been proved to be worth from 4 to about 7
dwts to the ton. Stone of this value, if worked
•according to the present system, namely—that of
having it reduced at a public crushing machine
at an expense of 10s per ton, would yield the
■company no profit, but the time may come when
they may become possessed of an efficient crush-
ing plant, then the stone above alluded to may
become a source of immense wealth. The total
length of the claim is 426 feet including the
walls ; of this 220 feet, commencing at the nor-
thern boundary, has been opened up, leaving
200 feet at the southern end untouched. Soon
•after the first discovery of gold in this claim, a
whim was erected to facilitate the working of
it; but horse-power was found to be totally
inadequate to cope with the water and at the
same time to raise the stone ; it was resolved,
therefore, to erect steam-pumping and winding
-machinery, and in about the middle of the year
1863, operations commenced with a 12-horse-
power sfeam-engine, working a pump and hav-
ing winding gear attached, for raising the
stone, the pump being constructed with pipes
of 5-inch guage. This machine, which is most
•conveniently situated on the claim, has, up to

the present time, so far as draining and wind*
ing are concerned, completely answered the re-
quirements of the mine; the deepest point
.reached being 220 feet, and the engine being of
sufficient power to drain to considerably lower
levels. The amount of labor employed in this
•claim has varied since gold was first struck,
from 15 up to 24 men, the latter number hav-
ing been employed, at one period, for 12 con-
secutive months.
In the latter end of the year 1864, the Unity
•Company passed a resolution to extend their
operations by erecting on the claim a powerful
■and efficient crushing plant. For the purpose
of raising a sufficient capital to carry out this
project, it was resolved to form a joint-stock
■company with a capital of £20,000 in 2000 shares
;at £lO each, the company then existing to make
•over to the one proposed to be formed the whole
of their property for 1,400 paid-up shares. This
project fell through, and the Unity Company
■continued working their claim according to the
original system. The instances of interest in
this company changing hands up to this period
are singularly few, one only having taken place,
when a shareholder named Powel sold his in-
terest to the company jointly, for the sum of
£I,OOO. This fact speaks volumes with respect
to the estimation in which the ground is held by
the proprietors themselves. The value of the
mining plant on the ground, including steam en-
gine, winding gear, trucks, buildings, and tools,
has been estimated at about £BOO.
Since the date of the above account, namely,
the month of March, 1865, the Unity Company’s
-operations have been as follows

The above list of crushings makes the total
yield of the claim as follows, 10,038 tons of
quartz, with a yield of 82640 z Idwt 6grs of
gold, the whole having produced cash to the
amount of £32,397 14s 6d It will he observed
on examining the above accounts of the yield of
this ground, that, with the exception of a short
} period in the early part of the year 1865, it
las always maintained its character as a first
class payingH claim ; its prospects never hav-
ing been better than at the present time. The
weekly expenses of working this mine aver-
age about £9O, including wages, firewood, cost
of timbering, lighting the mine, and all inci-
dental expenses, excepting of course the cost
of crushing. The average amount of labor em-
ployed on the ground is sixteen men.
Up to the present time of writing, the com-
pany has always reduced their stone at a public
crushing machine ; thus adding enormously to
their expenses; arrangements are however now
pending for the erection of a crushing plant of
their own. In the early part of the year 1865,
the proprietors of this ground, formerly co-
operative, organised themselves into a joint-
stock company, registering under Fraser’s Act;
the registration having been effected on the 10th
April, 1865. The nominal capital of the com-
pany is £14,000 in fourteen hundred shares at
£lO each. The Unity Company may be noted
as being at the present time one of the most
flourishing in the district.
HOPE AND ANCHOE COMPANY.
The claim southward of the Unity Company’s
was originally known as Nos. 5 and 6 south
amalgamated. The ground is now held under
lease, and work is carried on, on the co-opera-
tive principle, under the title of the Hope and

Anchor Company. The ground was opened in
the month of J uly, 1862, and prospecting was
steadily carried on without any profitable re-
sults until April, 1865. Two shafts have been
sunk on the claim, standing in an east and
west line, the western one being 128 ft, and the
eastern 160 feet in depth. These shafts have
been driven at various levels a distance of over
600 feet; and blind shafts have been sunk in th®
drives to an extent altogether of 124 feet; mak.
ing in all over a thousand feet of sinking and
driving. The cross-cut effected by driving
comprises a stretch of ground of 215 feet from
east to west. In the month of April, 1865,
stone from which fair prospects could be ob-
tained was found; and a trial crushing of 3
tons gave a return of 15dwts of gold. This
stone has since been worked with the follow-
ing results : —■
Yield of the Hope and Anchor Company’s Claim.
Tons. ozs. dwts. grs.
The above crushings show an average ot
nearly a quarter of an ounce to the ton; but in
this particular instance the value of the ground
must not be judged by the average value of
the stone that it has as yet produced, the latter
portion that has been crushed having been by
far the richest; as, for instance, 17 of the 77
tons of the last mentioned lot gave the very
satisfactory return of 19oz; again, the body of
stone from which the above mentioned returns
were obtained, was found 90 feet eastward of
the shaft, and is known as the “Eeality lieef
a continuation of the March Eeef has yet to
be found in this ground; but as the Unity Com-


pany have worked their rich lode to within a
dozen feet of the northern boundary of this
claim, at which point yields of a most satisfac-
tory character are being obtained, it is but rea-
sonable to suppose that days of prosperity are
in store for the Hope and Anchor Company.
Steady perseverance such as was shown in
prospecting this ground deserves a golden re-
ward, and the shareholders have doubtless the
best wishes of everyone who recognises the
worth of unflinching industry.
The next claim southward was originally
known as Nos. 7 and 8 amalgamated, but since
the leasing of the Hope and Anchor Company’s
ground, it has been recognised as No. 6 South.
This claim has had two shafts sunk on it, each
to a depth of 160 feet ; these shafts have been
driven to a considerable extent, but nothing has
been found to afford remuneration for the labor
expended. Stone in a rubble form has been
found to a considerable extent, and in various
places, but in every instance it was found to
be of an entirely valueless character. No. 7
is the last claim southward in which work of
any importance has been done. This ground has
been sunk on to a depth of 153 feet. The sup-
posed line of the March Heef was found 35 feet
east of the shaft; the stone ranges between 4
and 6 feet in width, and has been cut through
and tested at various levels, and the result has
been to prove its value to be from 4 to lldwi
to the ton.
THE INDEPENDENT COMPANY.
The ground bounding the prospecting claim,
on north, was originally known as Nos. 1,2,
and 3 amalgamated; it was afterwards held
under lease, and worked by a co-operative com-
pany known as the Independent; it was subse-
quently registered in the same name as a joint-
stock company, under the Limited Liability
Act, the registration dating 23rd May, 1865.
The stock of the company consists of 1,500
shares, of £5 each; 1,200 being held by the
original holders of the ground, and the remain-
ing 300 being held in reserve for any future con-
tingency that may arise.

On this claim three shafts have been sunk-
Hold was first discovered in paying quantities
in a shaft at the extreme southern end of the
claim, in November, 1862. Subsequently it
was found advisable to sink further north.
Here likewise payable stone was found at a
depth of about 125 feet, and a whim was
erected to facilitate the working of it; this
was doubly necessary, as the payable stone was
below water level. Subsequently a greater depth
was attained, in consequence of drainage ef-
fected by the pumping machinery erected on
the prospecting claim.
At a depth of 195 feet the stone was found
to be about ten feet in thickness, but having a
decided tendency to increase in size. At the last
mentioned level the quality of the quartz was
found to be superior to anything hitherto found,
and it was from near this spot that the best
crushings that this claim has produced were ob-
tained. The following list of crushings is the
total produce of the claim :
Yield of the Independent Co.’s Claim.
738 H 14-
Being an average of not quite 13dwts to the ton.
In the middle of the year 1865, this company
aided their operations by erecting steam pump-
ing and winding machinery; the engine being
one of 12 horse power, worked by a tubular
boiler. At the present time the occasional in-
convenience of these boilers is being experienced


by this company, it not being safe to put the
salt water from the reefs into them; and the
supply of rain water having failed, the opera-
tions of the ■ company have been brought,
for a time, to a stand-still. There is little doubt
but that this company has a successful future
before it.
In No. 4, north, sinking has been carried to a
depth of 165 ft. The first gold obtained in this
claim was found five years ago, when B|oz was
produced from 2 tons of stone, taken from
a depth of 130 feet, which at the time alluded to
was below the water level. The party of men
who obtained this gold eventually deserted the
claim in consequence of their inability to conquer
the water, and the shaft caving in. The present
proprietors, in addition to sinking 165 feet, have
driven eastward a distance of 50 feet, and west-
ward 20 feet; from the latter drive 7 tons of
stone was crushed from a lode 5 feet in width,
and gave a return of 7dwt to the ton; these
operations were at the 150 feet level. A shaft
has been sunk on this claim, westward of the
line of the above workings, to a depth of 110
feet, but the work was not attended with any
profitable results. No. 5 north has had two
shafts sunk on it; that which was sunk first is
at the north end of the claim, in which a depth
of about 160 feet has been reached; this shaft
has been driven from east to west a distance of
50 feet, but nothing has resulted beyond reveal-
ing the existence of a number of small bodies
or blocks of stone of a completely valueless
character. This shaft has been deserted and a
second one commenced, which at the present
time has reached a depth of 80 feet. This
claim has been double banked on the western
side, but the general opinion appears to_ be
that the money and time so expended might
have been better devoted elsewhere; certain it
is that up to the present time no profit has ac-
crued from the operations. But a careful exami-
nation of the ground, has shown that the work
was not undertaken without good and sufficient
reason. It had been an opinion expressed by
several proprietors of ground southward, that
the line of the lode that was being worked by the
prospectors and Unity Company would be


found westward of the western boundary of
No. 5, and it was resolved to test the correct-
ness of this opinion. A shaft was commenced
in a position pointed out by those supposed
to be qualified to give a correct opinion, and the
flucan of a lode was almost immediately found
on the western side of the shaft. This flucan
eventually made out into stone of most pro-
mising looking character, without having, how-
ever, any gold observable in it. The stone varies
in width, sometimes stretching nearly across the
shaft, and then contracting to a few inches. In
this form it has been traced down to the water
level, when further prospecting (for the present
at least) became impossible. A few feet above
the water level a drive has been put in over
100 feet in length. About 30 feet from the
shaft in this drive, a small body of stone was dis-
covered with a golden prospect in it; but the
dimensions of it were not sufficiently large to
admit of its being worked. Up to this point all
the strata had had a western underlay, but on
continuing the drive the underlay was found to
reverse, and it was thought in consequence that
this might be the line of some permanent lode,
and a blind shaft was sunk for the purpose of
testing it: after penetrating a few feet opera-
tions had to be stopped in consequence of water.
At the water level the stone appeared to be
making larger. On the same level as the drive
just described, there is another of considerable
length eastward, but nothing of any importance
resulted from the work. No. 6 has reached a
depth of 170 feet, and has cross-cut a distance
of 70 feet. In the course of working, leaders
have been found in all directions, but the largest
body of stone was found at a depth of 90 feet,
from which 10 tons was crushed, and gave a
yield of sdwts to the ton; this body of stone
was two feet in thickness.
No. 7 north has had three shafts sunk, one to
a depth of 120 feet, another 127 feet, and a
third to a depth of 173 feet; the latter has
been driven at various levels, in all, from east
to west, a distance of 200 feet. In this ground,
at a depth of 110 feet, 11 tons of stone gave 18J
ozs of gold, and a second crushing of 15 tons gave
15 ozs. The stone from which these crushiugs


were taken is not a regular lode, but a series of
small blocks; various other crushings have been
obtained, but of which no regular account has
been kept, but the result was such as to impress
the proprietors with the belief that an almost
unlimited amount of stone remained in the
ground worth about 4dwts to the ton; but a
trial crushing of 60 tons taken indiscriminately,
resulted in a loss, the yield being under 2dwts
to the ton. Prospecting is still being carried on
in this claim.
No. 8 north has been sunk to a depth of
about 170 feet, but nothing of importance has
hitherto resulted from the work done. In No.
9 north a considerable amount of work has been
done at various times. The first holders of
this claim found stone that on trial proved
worth 4|- dwts to the ton, but this not paying, the
claim was deserted.
About twelve months since this ground was
again occupied, and a considerable amount of
prospecting has been since done in it, without,
however, resulting in a profit to the shareholders.
A few months since a body of stone was dis-
covered 60ft. west of the shaft, but the great
influx of water rendered it impossible to test its
value. This last mentioned claim terminates
the workings northward on this line; it stands
surrounded by the alluvial workings of Potter’s
Hill, which is supposed to be the head of that
lead of gold which first rendered Inglewood
famous, and drew together, it is supposed, the
largest and densest mass of human beings ever
yet found at one time on a new goldfield, and
forming what is popularly called a rush.
The March Eeef has been double-banked on
the eastern side of the southern claims. This
has been named “The Reality Eeef,” a descrip-
tion of which will form the subject of the next


Chap. XII. The Reality Reee.
At the close of the preceding chapter, it was
-stated that the reef therein described had been
■donble-banked on the eastern side, southward
of the prospecting claim. This line, called the
“Reality Reef,” now demands attention,. The
prospecting claim was taken up on the Bth
June, 1863, the reason for occupying the ground
having arisen from appearances in the under-
ground workings of the Unity Company’s claim,
indicating the probable existence of stone in this
direction, and a general bias in favour of the
spot by the prospectors themselves, although it
may be mentioned that no outcrop of stone or
other surface indications proclaimed the exis-
tence of any reef whatever. Operations were
commenced by sinking a shaft 186 feet in depth ;
at this level a body of stone was discovered,
seven feet westward of the shaft, a trial crush-
ing of which, four tons, gave 2| dwts to the ton.
But the peculiarity of the dip and underlay, and
likewise the direction in which the stone ap-
peared to be making, rendered it desirable that
another shaft should be sunk ; a fresh one was
therefore commenced seventy feet from the first
in about a north-westerly direction, that having
been thought to be the bearing of the stone-
The result proved the calculation to be correct-
At a short distance westward of the shaft, at a
depth of 140 feet, the stone was again found,
and a good prospect immediately obtained; 17
tons were sent to the mill as a trial, and gave
a yield of nearly an ounce to the ton. A whip
to facilitate raising the stone, and a blacksmith’s
shed, were erected, and the lode was then syste-
matically worked, with the following result -

Showing an average for the total produce of
the claim of a trifle over 18dwts 7grs. The
stone maintained an average thickness through-
out of about twelve feet. The Reality Reef, so
far as the prospectors have been able to ascer-
tain, is not a regular well defined lode, but ex-
ists in blocks. The crushings mentioned above
have been the produce of the first one dis-
covered, the value of the second, which made
almost immediately after the tailing out of the
first, has not yet been proved, an influx of water
preventing sinking being carried to a sufficient
depth for that purpose. Since the date of the
last crushing the operations in this claim have
been entirely of a prospecting character. Before
concluding the remarks on this claim, it may
be well to direct special attention to the very
unusual bearing of the stone. Taking into con-
sideration the fact of the bearing of the lode
being as near as possible N.W. by S.E., in con-
duction with the circumstance that a line in
this direction bears directly on to the claim of
the Unity Company, the idea may be entertained,
with a reasonable show of probability, that the
Beality and March Beefs have some sort of con-
nection one with the other. The solution of
the problem must, however, remain the work of
time.
The claims southward have been marked out
and operations carried on as near as possible in
a line with the bearing of the stone in the pros-
pecting claim. JNo. 1 has had two shafts sunk
on it, in the first a depth of 13Uft, w T as reached,


and has been driven eastward 100 feet, and west-
ward 30 feet. At the one hundred feet level,
ten feet eastward of the shaft, a body of stone
five feet in thickness was discovered; it is a
tolerably well defined reef, and has every ap-
pearance of being the line of a permanent lode.
So far as this stone has been prospected it has
hitherto proved valueless. The second shaft
sunk on. this claim is about 130 feet eastward of
the first, here a depth of 158 feet has been
reached, and a drive put in westward 30 feet,
meeting the one hundred feet drive eastward in
the first shaft. A drive has likewise been put
in eastward a distance of 75 feet; it will be seen,
therefore, that the ground has had a cross-cut
from east to west, including the length of the
shafts, of nearly 250 feet; all this work proving
unproductive the claim was abandoned. After
the lapse of a considerable time this claim was
again taken possession of, and prospecting
operations have been carried on in it to the present
time, but the work done has not been attended
with any profitable results.
In No. 2 South, a shaft has been sunk to a
•depth of about 110 feet, and driven at various
levels both east and west, effecting a cross-cut
altogether of somewhat near 80 or 90 feet.
Stone in limited quantities has been found in
this claim in various places, but nothing of a
remunerative character presenting itself, the
claim was abandoned in the latter part of the
year 1864. The Reality line terminates south-
ward with this claim, the following ground be-
ing held by claim-holders on the Godwin Reef.
No. 1 north, was taken up and operations
commenced in January, 1864. A shaft has
been sunk on this claim to a depth of 170 feet.
At 125 feet a body of stone was struck covering
the whole of the bottom of the shaft; sinking
was continued through this stone, and at a
depth of 130 feet a trial lot of 3 tons was sent
to the mill and gave a return of 9 dwts. A fur-
ther trial of 13 tons resulted in a gross yield of
16 dwts. This of course not paying expen-
ses, further operations on it were relinquished.
The above-mentioned body of stone partially
tails out at a depth of 160 feet; at, 170 feet,
that is to say the deepest point reached, it is


2 feet in thickness; the bearing of this stone
and the position of the ground—which is nearly
due north of that held by the prospectors—
points to the probability of its being a distinct
lode altogether from that discovered in the
prospecting claim. A continuation of the stone
discovered in No. 1 will have to be sought for
in the prospecting claim at a point considerably
eastward of that at which operations have
hitherto been carried on. At the deepest point
reached, namely 170 feet, a drive has been put
in eastward 37 feet, and westward 26 feet, but
nothing of importance resulted from the work.
In May, 1864, this claim was registered, and
again in October of the same year; at its ex-
piration in January, 1865, it was abandoned.
No. 2 North, has had a shaft sunk on it to a
depth of about 16 ( > feet. At its lowest level a
drive has been put in westward 15 feet, and
eastward 30 feet ; in the latter at a distance of
about 18 feet from the shaft a body of stone
was discovered the thickness of which has not
been ascertained in consequence of arriving
at the western boundary of the claim, when it
had been penetrated 12 feet. This lode as far
as it has been prospected has proved valueless,
its bearing is about the same as that found in
the prospecting claim, namely, N. W. by S. E.,
it is therefore unlikely to be identical with the
stone found in the neighbouring claim south.
Driving to a limited extent has likewise been
carried on at various levels, but without result-
ing in anything of importance. This claim was
registered in Jan., 1865; at the expiration of
the term it was abandoned, but with No. 1 was
almost immediately taken up under lease by
the Unity Company, the great inducement be-
ing the fact that the ground forms the eastern
boundary of their original claim on the March
Reef. The last-mentioned claim terminates the
workings northward on this line.*
Note.— * It will be seen from the above account
that the prospecting claim on this line is the only
one that has proved remunerative. Apparently,
well-grounded reasons are assigned for this. It ‘is
asserted that a continuation of the lode that has
been found in the prospecting claim has not yet been


touched in either of the claims north or south of it,
and if a general view of the whole line be taken from
the shaft of No. 2 North, and considered in con-
nection with the above written description of it, it
will appear that there is some foundation for the
opinion. It will be observed on taking up a position
by the side of where the windlass of No. 2 north
originally stood, that the whole line forms two sides
of an obtuse angle triangle, the prospecting claim
being in the centre. The southern claims have been
marked out as near as possible in a line with the
bearing of the stone found by the prospectors, that
is to say south-east, the line of the northern claims
on the contrary is a trifle eastward of north, compar-
ing this with the known bearing of the lode in the
prospecting claim, there appears to be some found-
ation for the opinion that the Keality Eeef has yet
to be found outside their boundaries.


Chapter XIII. The Jersey Beef.
The prospecting claim on this justly re-
nowned reef, was marked out on the 3rd of
May, 1860, hy Mr Aubin, who named the
ground after his native island. Four days after
the marking out, gold was found in the stone
3 feet from the surface, the necessary notice
in such cases posted in the Warden’s office,
bearing date, Bth of May. But this surface
stone did not prove payable, and the prospector,
from lack of available funds, and inability to pro-
cure backers, was obliged on the 10th of July
following, to abandon it. Mr Aubin had not
lost faith in the Jersey Beef, and nothing was
further from his intention than that the aban-
donment should be permanent, and it was again
taken up on the 14th of January, 1861, and
steadily worked until the following March when
quartz, bearing gold, was found at a depth of
80 feet. But it was not until the 2nd of July,
that undeniably payable quartz, at a depth of
85 feet, was obtained, and on the Bth of the same
month, the first crushing was obtained from the
lode that subsequently gave the following mag-
nificient returns :

tember 7th, 1861, and March 27th, 1862, have
been omitted, no account having been

r lhe reef from which the stone giving the
above results was extracted, has varied very
, , J
much in point of thickness, near the surface
not being more than about 3 feet. At a greater
depth, it had increased to 17 or 18 feet; the
X ’ tv J. | O.U V 5 lUC
reef has been worked up to within a very short
distance of the surface. Gold has been found
down to water-level, but no attempt has been
made hitherto to carry on work to any extent
below that point. There have been seven shafts
sunk, two or three of them are, however, shallow.
The two deepest have been worked by the aid
of a whim, the others by a whip and windlasses.
Tor a considerable length of time, this claim
gave employment to about 12 men. In No. 1,
iNorth, a very great amount of work was gone
through before gold was discovered. Two shafts
were first sunk on the highest ground of the
claim, but after they had been driven for a con-
siderable distance, it was determined to abandon
them, it being the general opinion that they
were too far westward. Mons. Combat, a share-
holder, (whose name has before appeared in


connection-with the Columbian,) gave it as his
opinion, that if the reef was to be obtained at
all, it would be by sinking a shaft 70 or 80 feet
eastward of the first workings. This opinion
was acted upon, and in the month of February,
1861, at a depth of about 60 feet, a body of stone
was cut, the first crushing from which, of 21
tons, gave an average of 4ozs Bdwts to the ton.
This, of course, raised the spirits of the share-
holders very considerably. “But ah !it was
delusive hope,” in this particular instance, for
in the following crushing, the average yield was
brought down to a little over an ounce, and the
next to four dwts to the ton. The following is
the detailed account of these crushings. Yield

Four dwts to the ton not being sufficient to
pay the expenses incurred, these workings were
abandoned, and operations were resumed in the
shaft, which was sunk to a depth of 170 feet,
but no fresh discovery was made. As the stone
had an eastern underlay, a drive was put in;
in that direction, at a level of 100 feet, the reef
was cut through, but here it had run out to a
few small leaders, having just the “colour” in
them. Again driving was commenced, this time
at 170 feet. On cutting the reef at this level,
it was found to have increased in size, but still
it did not “shape.” After following it down in
a monkey shaft, for a depth of about 20 feet,
making the deepest point gained 190 feet from
the surface, it was registered, but the original
shareholders did not at the expiration of the
time resume work, and the ground has since
been incorporated with the prospecting claim
under lease. In Nos. 2 and 3, an immense
amount of work has been done, but hitherto
without any profitable result. Plenty of stone
has been found, but trial crushings have rarely
given more than an average of 3 or 4dwts to the
ton.
The southern claims have a better tale to tell

than the northern. In No. 1, golckwas first got
at a depth of 140 feet in a drive, a very short
distance from the shaft. The stone was worked
the whole length of the claim, from the level
at which it was first obtained down to that of
190 feet, where it tailed out, but made again a
few feet deeper. The reef in this claim has
been worked down to water, the last crushing
at this level giving 5 dwts to the ton, the stone
being about 8 feet in thickness. No attempt
has been made to get below this level, and very
little work of any description has been done at
a shallower depth than 140 feet. Mr G. Gib-
bins has furnished the following list of crush-
ings, the correctness of which is vouched for by
that gentleman.

Add 12 ozs to the above amount for the
second crushing, and a general average is shown
for this claim of nearly 1 oz 7 dwts to the ton.
In No. 2, gold was first obtained at a depth
of 179 feet, in a continuation of the stone
worked in No. 1. The three first crushings
were taken out from this level. The lode in this
part of the claim was worked but very partially,
about 12 feet of the whole width only being
taken, the yield being not more than a £ of an
ounce to the ton. The width of the reef in this
part is sometimes 40 feet, consequently, an
immense amount of stone is still left here, all of
which would give a yield similar to the above-
mentioned average. This yield not being up to
the expectations of the shareholders, further
prospecting was commenced, and eventually
stone of considerably greater value was found
in a blind shaft in the old workings, the lode
being a continuation of that worked at the 179
feet level. M’Keone, one of the shareholders,
gives the following list of crushings, as the re-
sult produced from this claim.

The above account shows an average of rather
more than 10 dwts 10 grs to the ton. This
being lower than those of the neigbouring
claims, may be accounted for by the very large
amount of stone found here ; it is generally be-
lieved that there is considerably more than in
any other claim on the same line, sometimes (as
mentioned above,) showing a thickness of 40ft.
The following’items are copied from Mr M’-
Keone’s diary—“lB64, Aug. the 6th. Trial crush-
ing from the blind shaft south, yielded 16 dwts
6 grs. August the 18th, left off work. August
the 16th, registered.”
The next claims south, namely—Nos. 3 and
4, are amalgamated. The reef in this ground
was first struck at a depth of 90 feet, when a
trial of 3 tons giving a return of only 1 or 2
dwts to the ton, sinking was continued to
115 feet. The reef was here again
cut through, but was not found to be pay-
able. At 140 feet, the same result was shown.
Sinking was then continued to a depth of 170 ft,
when a fresh body of stone was struck in the
shaft, from which a good prospect was obtained.
The reef was here opened out, and a crushing
of 10 tons gave a yield of 15 dwts to the ton.
This stone was subsequently found to be a
small leader, stretching along the western side
of the main reef, which was here found to be
about 6 feet from the shaft. A trial crushing
showed its value at this level to be 6 dwts to
the ton, the thickness of the stone being 4 feet.
At a depth of 190 feet, its values had increased
to 7or 8 dwts to the ton. An opening out was
made at this level and some very good stone
was obtained. Mr Goodwin, one of the share-
holders, has furnished the following list of


crushings obtained principally from this part
of the claim.

Being an average of nearly 1 oz 7 dwts to the
ton. The body of stone from which these re-
sults were obtained was worked down to water
level, namely, 222 feet, by a length along the
line of 100 feet. Operations had for a time to
be suspended in these workings, in consequence
of foxil air, until another shaft was sunk, and
ventilation made perfect, by connecting the two
by a drive. After the mine had been opened
for two years, these workings fell in to such an
extent, as to induce the proprietors to abandon
them, but before the above accident happened,
the following knowledge of the ground at its
greatest depth had been gained, namely—that
there were two bodies of stone eastward of the
main line, of the respective widths of 4 and 2ft,
and one body westward, 2 feet in thickness, and
all this stone upon trial proved to be worth
about 5 dwts to the ton. Being in possession
of these facts, it induced the proprietors to clear
out the mullock, and re-timber the mine, but no
further work has been carried on in this part
since. The claim was subsequently worked on
tribute, at or about the 90 feet level, when the
following erushings were obtained. The


account lias been furnished by Messrs Chamber-
lane and Duncan, shareholders.

registered.
The foregoing comprises the history of the
portion of the Jersey Reef therein described, up
to the date of the publication of the first edition
of the present work. Since that time the
ground has been leased, and registered as the
property of a Joint Stock Company, called the
Jersey Eeef G-old Mining Company. Before
this latter event took place the prospecting
claim, which was the only portion of the ground
that was worked, produced the following list of

The Jersey Beef Gold Mining Company was
registered under the Limited Liability Act on
October 2nd, 1865. The capital consisted of
£B,OOO in 4,000 shares of £2 each. The whole
of the scrip paid up to £l, was taken by the
original holders of the ground as compensation,
leaving the amount of £4,000 which the direc-
tors can call up in the event of necessity. Since
the formation of the company the principal
operations have been in that portion of the
ground originally known as No. 2 North, and
from which ground the following crushings
have been obtained.

In addition to the above some smaller amounts
have been obtained, making the total yield pro-
duced since the company has been in operation
up to the present time, 367 ozs 10 dwts 21 grs.
This has allowed the company to declare two
dividends, namely 2s per share on 27th Decem-
ber, 1865 ; and Is 6d per share on 18th January,
1866 ; in addition to keeping in hand a reserve
fund of £7O ; making a total clear profit of £7OO,
for about two months’ work, including the time
taken in raising the first of the above-mentioned
crushings. The prospects of this company at
the present time are certainly encouraging to a
very high degree ; the manager reporting that
several years of good paying work may be de-
pended on, as being before them, and that, too,
without going below the water level. The
scrip of this company is quoted at a very hand-
some premium; the sellers in some cases ask-
ing as much as from 10 to 15 shillings on the £1
paid up.
In Nos. 5 and 6 (amalgamated,) the work up
to the present time has not been remunerative.
Two shafts have been sunk ; one of them to a
depth of over 200 feet, and stone in large quan-
tities discovered, the value of which, upon trial,


lifts been proved to be about 5 or 6 dwts to the
ton. Very little beyond work of the prospect-
ing character has been done in this ground.
The following ground, namely, Nos. 7,8, 9, 10,
and 11, is held by the Victoria Company.
Operations were commenced in May, 1862, and
have continued almost uninterruptedly ever
since. The company formerly carried on oper-
ations on the co-operative principle, but sub-
sequently reorganised and registered as a Joint
Stock Company, under the Limited Liability
Act, the registration dating April, 1865. The
books containing the account of the operations
of this company whilst working on the co-oper-
ative principle, have, it is supposed, been lost,
a complete account cannot therefore be given.
The following list of crushings and dividends
has been taken from Dicker’s Mining Record;
it is not stated from whence they were obtained,
but a shareholder in the company has personally
vouched for their correctness.

a clear profit of £BOO, or £4O per 20th share.
Since the registration 0 f the company in April,
18G5, the following crushings have been ob-
tained.
Yield of the Victoria Co’s Claim
The Victoria Company’s mine has been sunk
on to a depth of a little over 200 feet, that being
the water-level What the value of the stone
may be below the water, is a problem yet to be
solved, as with the present appliances the com-
pany has not been able to test it; but at the
deepest point reached a large amount of stone
is known to exist worth about 3 or 4 dwts t&
the ton. The size of the lode in this ground is
sometimes very large, stretching out at some
levels to a width of 20 feet.
All efforts to obtain a payable reef, south of
the Victoria Company’s claim, have proved
hitherto unsuccessful. The present sketch has
been rather an extended one, but that care and
attention only has been given that the import-
ance of the reef demanded. On reading many
of the above facts, especially those respecting
the prospecting claim, the reader will perhaps
smile, when it was known that at the time Mr
Aubin first canvassed for backers to help him to
open it, and failed to get them, some of the
funny dogs of the place, dubbed it “The Lone
Tree Hill Swindle.”


Chaptee XIY.
The Maxwell’s Reef.
Tliis celebrated reef was discovered in Decem-
ber, 1859. The Argus correspondent, in an
account of this reef in 1862, gives a most ro-
mantic tale with respect to its discovery. It
shows how a party of Scotchmen, all natives of
Dumfriesshire, were crossing the scrub—as the
Columbian men had done before them, un-
successfully and dispirited, uncertain in what
direction to turn their steps with a view to
“tucker,” better fortune discarded from their
hopes for a time. Further, how one of the party,
at the time not being in the best of tempers, fell
headlong over a block of quartz, and smashing
the aforesaid stone out of revenge, with a ham-
mer that he carrried in his hand, revealed gold
in such quantities as to induce them to travel
no further that day. Further, it is not shown
but imagined, that the magnificient reef that
was then discovered was named Maxwell’s after
the spot not far from their native Dumfries,
celebrated in song, as the scene where the dew
falls early, and where “Annie Laurie” of the
swan-like neck, plighted her troth to her poet.
All this is very pretty, but unfortunately for
the lovers of the marvellous, it is singularly de-
ficient of one very necessary quality, namely,
truth. The fact is, the discovery of Maxwell’s
reef was if anything, la her a prosy affair. A
party of five men, consisting of the three
brothers Laidlaw, and Messrs Gilchrist and
White, had so managed, that whilst one division
worked in alluvial, the other should prospect
in the neighbourhood for a reef, and so was
found the Maxwell’s reef, after a very fair share
of steady prospecting in ground that was in
those days covered with a dense scrub. On
opening the ground, the largest body of sur-
face stone that has ever been found in the dis-
trict was laid bare. Good specimens were
found for a width of about 30 feet, and the stone


taken indiscriminately from tkat width on
ing tried at Kingower, proved worth 4 ozs to
the ton. This lode was steadily worked from
the surface, downwards, and up to December,
1861, gave the fortunate possessors the follow-
ing list of crushings:—

At about the date of the last of the above crush-
ings, the prospectors paid a visit to England,
since which accounts do not appear to have
been regularly kept, but Messrs Laidlaw state
that the yield would amount, in the aggregate,
to rather more than 4,000 ozs., in addition to
the above list, making the gross yield of the
claim up to the present time about 10,000 ozs..
but it may be as well to state, that this amount
includes the yield from No. 1, south, that claim
having been purchased by the prospectors, and
incorporated with their original 'claim- The
prospects of this claim still -continue brilliant-


The water-level, namely, 200 feet, has been
reached some time since, and Messrs Laidlaw
and Co. have just erected most efficient steam-
pumping, and winding machinery. Work by
the aid of this machinery has just com-
menced ; the help of the pumps has not, how-
ever, been required, and it is thought that they
will not be necessary for another 20 feet, the influx
of water not being greater than will allow of its
all being sent up in mullock obtained in sink-
ing. Twenty specimens from this claim were
exhibited by the proprietors in the “Great Ex-
hibition” in London, for which a first-class cer-
tificate was awarded.
The Maxwell’s Eeee Gold Mining Company.
Since writing the above, by the aid of the
pumping machinery spoken of, the principal
shaft has been sunk to a depth of 250 feet, and
the reef at that level partially prospected, the
result of which work having been a determin-
ation on the part of the proprietors to erect
powerful crushing machinery, the amount of
auriferous stone being so great as to hold out
prospects of payable work for some years to
come. In furtherance of their project, the
owners of the ground resolved on the for-
mation of a Joint Stock Company, to be called
the “Maxwell’s Eeef Gold Mining Company,”
the capital to consist of £20,000 in 20,000 shares
of £1 each. The proprietors of the ground to
receive 10,000 shares paid up to 15 shillings, as
compensation for the ground. It is proposed to
erect a 25 horse-powen engine, with 24 heads of
stampers in six batteries of four each, together
with all the latest improvements in crushing
and amalgamation. The amount of available
auriferous stone known of in the company’s
ground at the present time, has been estimated
at 80,000 tons. On the erection of crushing
machinery this company will be in a position
to immediately commence profitable operations,
the mine being in first-rate working order.
No. 2, South, has been sunk to a depth of
198 feet, that is to say, to the water-level. The
only stone obtained in the shaft was some
rubble and a few small leaders at a depth of
10 feet. The shaft has been driven at the 100
feet level, eastward 85 feet, and westward 30ft.


At a distance of 24 feet from the shaft, a lode
of stone supposed to be identical with that in
the prospecting claim was discovered, which on
trial proved worth 7| dwts to the ton. This
lode was followed along the line a distance of
60 feet, the stone was then taken out, averaging
the whole distance nearly 4 dwts to the ton. A
drive has likewise been put in at the water-
level a distance of 90 feet eastward, the lode
was here again found, but only a few inches in
thickness, it was followed down in a blind shaft
as far as water allowed, where it was found to
be increasing in size. No crushing took place
from this point, nothing having been seen to
lead to the supposition that it would pay. At
the southern end of this claim, a small quantity
■of surface stone was obtained, that gave half
an ounce to the ton, this was taken from a body
5 feet in thickness, an immense quantity of
which is left worth 4 dwts to the ton.
No. 3, South, has sunk down to the
water-level. At a depth of 100 feet, a body of
stone was struck about 12 feet in width, which
on trial proved worth a few dwts to the ton only,
not sufficient to pay for working, at least accord-
ing to the system yet applied to it
No. 4, South, likewise has sunk down to
water. At a depth of 90 feet, there is a very
large body of stone, worth 5 dwts to the
The Enteepbise Company.
The nest ground south, namely, Nos. 6,6, 7,
8,9, and 10, comprises the lease held by the
Enterprise Gold Mining Company. The ground
was formerly worked by small parties of miners,
each holding their separate claim. During the
time operations were carried on in this way,
some very good yields were obtained, as for in-
stance, N os. 5 and 6 produced the following : —•

The Enterprise Company was formed about
♦the middle of the year 1864, the first half-yearly
general meeting having.been held 22ud January,
1865. The capital consists of £5,000, in 1000
shares of £5 each; 300 paid up shares having
■been given to the original proprietors for the
mine. At the second ordinary general meeting
■of the company, a proposition of amalgamation
from the Hope Company was submitted for con-
sideration, but which was, however, rejected, as
it was considered that the terms were extrava-
, gant. By the aid of the pumping machinery on
the prospecting claim the Enterprise Company
have been enabled to obtain two trial crushings
from under water-level, ;and the result has been
the obtaining the satisfactory .yields recorded in

tine last two crushings in the .above list. In the
report oi .the third ordinary .‘general meeting of
the company, the directors inform the share-
holders that, “when work -ceased at the water-
level, owing to the inability of the pump to
-drain further, the stone was enlarging as it went
‘down, and decidedly improving in character.’'
If it were possible for a doubt to exist in the
mind of anyone as to the permanent character
•of the Maxwell’s Beef, it would vanish for a
<certainty >upon an examination of the under-
ground workings of No. 1, North.
The shaft has been sunk to the water-1 <*vel,
that is to say to a depth of 200 feet, and cuts
through the main lode at a depth of 175 feet.
The {first workings are at a depth of 15 feet. The
stone at this level was worked down to a depth
-of 50 feet. The next opening is at a depth of
65 feet. At this level the best stone that the
-claim has produced has been obtained. Open-
ings have likewise been made at the following
levels, 95, 120, 150, and 175 feet. At the latter
the reef, as mentioned above, crosses the shaft,
the lode here is bet ter developed and more solid
than in any other part at present worked, and
'the walls of the reef, both east and west, are as
smooth as though they had been built by a
mason. Very little work has been done in this
claim at water-level, nothing in fact but a short
drive in the direction of the reef. The follow-
ing is a complete list of the crushings obtained
from this claii* :

This shows an average of nearly 15dwt to the
ton for all that the claim has as yet produced,
hut an inspection of the claim has shown that
the above crushings have been merely trials of
the reef at the different levels as yet opened.
Stone yet remains of quality, equal, it is pre-
sumed, to the above, in countless thousands of
tons, as the reef maintains an average thickness
from the surface to the water-level, of over 30
feet.
The Concord Company.
Nos. 2,3, 4,5, 6, and 7, are held under lease
by the Concord Cold Mining Company. The
first company of this name deserted this ground,
having failed in their efforts to float the specu-
lation. Another effort is about to be made by a
company having the same title, and it is thought
with tolerable chances of effecting their object.
A considerable number of shafts have been sunk
on this portion of the reef ; and stone has been
proved to exist in immense quantities, but no
large yields have as yet been obtained. The
water-level has been reached in several shafts,
and at that level in No. 3 a drive has been put
in to the east a distance of 60 feet, when stone
20 feet in thickness was discovered, which proved
to be worth 4dwt to the ton. It would seem


from this that a large amount of paying work
is actually known of in this ground for any
company possessed of an efficient crushing plant.
N os. 8,9, and 10 appear to be of very similar
character, namely, possessing plenty of stone,
but not of sufficient value to afford a profit to
the shareholders. No. 8 has had two shafts
sunk on it, the deepest being 183 feet; stone
was struck in this shaft at a depth of 150 feet,
but nothing but the bare “colour” could be ob-
tained from it. Sinking was then continued to
a depth of 183 feet, when a drive 20 feet to the
east once more revealed the reef; at this point
it was 8 feet in thickness, but on being tried it
proved utterly worthless. In Nos. 9 and 10
sinking has been carried to a depth of 200 feet,
and crushings have been obtained varying in
value from 2dwts to 1 ounce to the ton. These
last mentioned three claims are now held under
lease; no operations have been done in the
ground for some time; at the present time work
is totally suspended.
In No. 11, gold was first struck in August,
1861, at a depth of 160 feet. The reef in this
ground is not a lode of any regular thickness,
but what is known as a block reef, that is to say,
large bodies of stone that run out and make
again at a greater depth. The stone struck at
160 feet was not its first making, it has been
followed upwards to within a comparatively
short distance from the surface. From a depth
of 70 feet down to 200 feet all the stone has
been taken out, the lode for the whole distance
having averaged about 6 feet in thickness. The
shaft has been sunk down to the water-level,
which, in this claim, was found to be 233 feet.
At a depth of 220 feet the lode tailed out, but
favorable indications are observable at the
water-level of its making again. The secretary
of the company, F. Muhlembru, furnishes the
following account of the produce of this claim:—

Showing an average of nearly 12dwts to the
Jon for the l total produce of the claim.
In No. 12, gold was first discovered at a depth
of 140 feet, hut, as in No. 11, the stone has been
•worked upwards for a considerable distance.
From a depth of 100 down to 150 feet, the stone
has been removed from one end of the claim to
the other by a width of 30 feet; opening's have
likewise been made at the 60 and 200 feet levels.
This claim has produced from the different
levels as yet opened, the following splendid list
■of crushings; the account is furnished by the
secretary, of whom it may be related that he
purchased a 4th -share at the first starting of
the claim for the sum of Is, and, subsequently,
■sold the half of itfor nearly twice as many hum
dreds of pounds.

Giving an average of nearly one ounce two
pennyweights to the ton.
No. 13, undoubtedly, ranks next in value to
the prospecting claim on this line. In May,
1864, this claim received a notice in Dicker’s
Mining Record, hut the account has so many
glaring mis-statements or errors, that it is
thought desirable to correct them. In the first
place it is stated, on the authority of one of the
shareholders, that the claim yielded about 80
tons a month, from May, 1860, to June, 1862,
the whole of which averaged in value 2| ounces
to the ton ; whereas, gold was not discovered
until 1861, and from that time until June, 1862,
the total yield was 6440 z 17dwt 13grs, the pro-
duce of 771 tons of stone; this would give an
average of 59 tons per month for the twelve
months during which the stone was being ob-
tained, and of an average value of nearly 16f
dwts to the ton. It is further stated that the
first crushing gave 16dwts (all), and the next
2| tons gave 16 ounces to the ton —the correct
statement will be found in the list of crushings


appended to the present account of the claim.
The list of cruahings from this claim published
by “Dicker” is likewise incorrect in several in-
stances. It is probable that these inaccuracies
are typographical errors, as for instance, 223 ozs
I2dwt 6grs, value dat £ 1067 Is Bd. It is fur-
ther stated that the whole labor employed on
the mine has consisted of five miners and one
blacksmith; this was correct only up to 1862,
subsequent to this up to May, 1864, the labor
employed ranged between nine and eleven men.
The following is a correct list of the crush-
ings obtained from this claim from the com-
mencement up to the present time :

Showing an average of a fraction over an
ounce and a half to the ton for the total produce
of the claim. Sinking has been carried on to a
depth of about 280 feet. The whole of the lode
has been taken out and crushed from the 100 to
the 200 feet level, maintaining an average thick-
ness the whole distance of about 150 feet. The
operations that are being carried on in this
claim at the present time are of a prospecting
character only.
No. 14 first struck gold at a depth of 160 feet,
when four tons was obtained that gave a yield
of an ounce and a half to the ton. The lode was
found at the above-mentioned level, 14 feet west
of the shaft; this stone was steadily worked
down with the following results —the list is defi-
cient of two or three crushings that were ob-
tained when gold was first struck, no regular
accounts at the time having been kept.

Being a little more than an average of loz 13
dwts to the ton.
The width of the lode in this claim varies
from 6to 22 feet. The shaft has been sunk to
the water-level, which was here found at 240
feet; at this point the lode appears to be better
developed than at shallower depths, but of con-
siderably less value. The reef in this ground
has a most extraordinary acute dip to the north,
so acute in fact so as to have rendered it impos-
sible to trace it to the northern boundary, as it
gets lost in the water. No profitable results
have accrued to the shareholders working in
this claim for more than three years.
Great Extended Maxwell’s Beef Gold
Mining Company.
The neighboring claim northward is 6 acres,
held under lease by the Great Extended Max-
well’s Reef Gold Mining Company. The pros-
pected portion of this ground was originally
worked by Messrs Finn and Co., as Nos. 15, 16,
and ] 7 north amalgamated claims, but a law-
suit, arising from a portion being “jumped,”
deprived the original owners of a portion of
their ground. An immense amount of profitless
prospecting has been carried on in this ground,
the total yield of the mine up to the present
time having been only Boz 14dwt 3grs, the pro-
duce of 33 tons of stone. The first crushing
took place on March 13, 1863, when three tons
gave soz sdwt 13grs; the next occurred on Oc-
tober 22, 1863, when 25 tons produced 3oz 3dwt
14grs, or an average of 2dwt 18grs to the ton.
The above crushings were obtained from a pro-
jection of a small block of stone on the southern
boundary of the claim leading into No. 14, the
whole of which these crushings cleared out.
The shaft has been sunk about 40 feet below
water and a cross-cut east and west put in, but
without being attended with profitable relsuts,
but the dip of the reef northward in No. 14 is
so acute, that men who have worked in and
thoroughly understand the ground, give it as
their opinion that there is little hope of reach-
ing the top of the reef in this claim at a shal-
lower depth than 100 feet below the water-level;
if this opinion be correct the company have a
considerable amount of prospecting before them


before profits can be realised. Several small
leaders have been found in this ground, but they
are reported as valueless. The company is at
present erecting steam-pumping and winding
machinery, which will be ready for operations
in a few weeks.
Since writing the above in January, 1865, the
pumping and winding machinery spoken of has
been brought into operation, and, by its help, a
considerable amount of prospecting done. The
shaft has been sunk to a depth of about 340 feet.
Stone has been discovered, but not of sufficient
value to pay the expenses of working.
The following report of a meeting of share-
holders of the Great Extended Company is ex-
tracted from the Melbourne Herald, of 17th Feb-
ruary, 1866.
“An extraordinary meeting of the shareholders
of the Great Extended Maxwell’s Reef Gold
Mining Company was held on Friday at the
Criterion Hotel, Mr N. Harris presiding, for
the purpose of dissolving the company and re-
organising it on the basis of an agreement sub-
mitted at the ordinary general meeting of share-
holders held in January last. Some discussion
ensued as to the best mode of carrying out the
above objects, and ultimately the following reso-
lution was carried, on the motion of Mrßurgin,
seconded by Mr Whiffin —“That, in consequence
of several of the shareholders having declined
to enter into the agreement as to the intended
re-organisation of the company, thereby pre-
venting the same being carried out as desired
at the ordinary meeting of the shareholders held
in January, in the opinion of this meeting it is;
desirable to wind up this company; and the
directors are hereby authorised and empowered
to take such steps as they may deem proper for
the winding up of the company and disposing
of its assets.”


Chapter XV. The Dreadnought.
In the days when Dusty Town first deserved
and obtained its uncomfortable sounding cogno-
men ; when the spirited tradesmen of Inglewood
were spending between two and three thousand
pounds a week in prospecting, some of which
was laid out judiciously, and much of it other-
wise ; and when as a result for this outlay, some
of the most valuable reefs in the district were
discovered ; in those days then the northern
suburb of the township received its fair share
of that inefficient and superficial prospecting,
the traces of which may be seen to this day for
miles around, in holes deep enough to break the
leg of anyone who might happen to fall into
them, but certainly not sufficiently so to test the
value of a reef, the outcrop of which having
caught the eye of a prospector, induced him to
do the work he did. The discovery of the
Dreadnought Ileef is an illustration of this. In
September, 1862, a prospector returning home
in the evening after a day’s labor, accompanied
with the usual tools of pick, shovel, and dish,
and having (as a prospector should, notwith-
standing the day’s work done,) an eye to busi-
ness, chanced to glance down a shallow hole
close to a footpath in the scrub a little backward
from Claughton’s crushing machine, and saw
what appeared to be the top of a reef of appa-
rently considerable size. To descend the
shaft and bring up a dish of the stone was al-
most as a matter of course the next proceeding,
which, on being washed at a water-hole close by,
revealed so much more than the mere “colour’’
of the desired metal, that a claim was at once
marked out. Subsequently, the Dreadnought
Prospecting Company was organised for the
purpose of giving it a fair trial. The company
consisted of twelve members, including two
working shareholders. Payable stone was ob-
tainedaboutS orb feet belcwwhere the first trial
dishful was taken from, and at this level a trial
of 8 tons produced lOoz 4dwt 6grs of gold. The
stone was then partially removed down to a
depth of 70 feet, when another shaft was sunk
about 60 feet further south, in such a position

that the reef was struck at about the same level
as the deepest in the first shaft. By driving
along the reef northward the two shafts were
connected, and the best stone that the reef has
produced was obtained midway between the two.
The shaft last sunk has been carried down, but
very partially worked, to a depth of 130
feet; the reef for the whole distance maintain-
ing an average thickness of about three feet. It
is, without doubt, one of the most perfectly de-
fined lodes in the district, having a clear sand-
stone wall on the west side and slate on the east,
it has a sharp dip southward, and underlays
east. The Dreadnought Prospecting Company
abandoned this ground in May, 1863, the re-
sult of their operations having been as fol-
lows :

The above shows a balance against the com-
pany of £29 14s lid. But in estimating the
value of this ground a few facts must be kept in
view beyond those presented by the above
figures. For instance, it must be remembered
that almost as a rule the most disadvantageous
mining operations are those that are carried on
on a limited scale and without the aid of ma-
chinery. The fact that this disadvantage existed
must certainly be borne in mind with respect to
the Dreadnought Prospecting Company ; this is
proved from the fact that only £257 2s 6d was
paid for wages during the whole time operations
were carried on. Again, all the labor of raising
the stone, &c., was performed by windlasses
worked by hand, and when in connexion with
this it is considered that the highest current
rates were paid for crushing it is very likely
to be admitted that the ground in question has
not hitherto had proper usage, and will even-
tually, if worked under a proper system, turn
out a good and payable mine. The average
value of the produce of the ground up to the
present time would tend very much to strengthen
this opinion. One other fact in connection with
the Dreadnought Beef would tend very much
to strengthen a confidence with respect to its
future prospects, namely that it has been ascer-
tained beyond a doubt to be a continuation of
the once —and very probably to be again—cele-
brated Odin Beef. Shares have been sold in
this claim at various periods, at prices ranging
from £25 to £BO. Northward of the prospecting
claim no effort of any importance has been
made to find a reef. Southward, claims were
marked out to a considerable distance, and
prospecting to some extent was carried on, but
nothing of a permanently paying character has
been found. G-old has been discovered, and pros-
pects of a quarter of an ounce to the dish have
on various occasions been washed, but they
have turned out to be but stray patches. A
short time since, the prospecting claim was
again taken possession of, but the work since
done has been of a very useless character ; for
instance, a shaft has been sunk westward mid-
way between the two sunk by the Dreadnought
Company, and nothing resulting down to a


depth of 70 feet a drive was put in to the east.
Ey referring to the above account of the opera-
tions of the Dreadnought Company, it will be
seen that the reef has already been worked at
this level, and likewise that it has an eastward
underlay, ergo, the deeper the shaft is sunk,
being situated westw aid of the old workings,
the further operations will be earned from the
line of reef. The present proprietary will ere
long find out that up to the present time their
operations have been only a waste of time and
money, and that to place themselves in a pos-
ition to successfully prospect the ground they
occupy, they must sink a shaft south-eastward
of the workings of the first prospectors.
The above comprised the history of the Dread-
nought Ileef up to the date of the publication
of the first edition of the present history, The
operations therein spoken of as being carried on
by the last proprietors turned out as the writer
predicted, namely, utterly useless. The drive
alluded to as being put in at the 70 feet level,
broke into —as was intimated that it would—
the old workings of the first proprietors. A
blind shaft was then put down, following the
lode on its underlay to a depth of about 130 or
140 feet from the surface, but no profitable
discoveries resulted, the stone running out in
this part of the claim to a thickness of not
more than a few inches. A correct knowledge
of the ground would have taught the proprietors
to have expected such a result. Be it remem-
bered the stone has an eastern underlay and
dips sharply to the south, the run of gold fol-
lowing the dip of the stone. The ground is at
the present time deserted, but for the guidance
of anyone who may at some future time occupy
it, the opinion is here repeated that was ex-
pressed above, nearly a year since, “to place
themselves in a position to successfully prospect
the ground they occupy, they must sink a shaft
south-eastward of the workings of the first pro-
prietors.”


Chapter XVI. The Daly Reef.
(FORMERLY THE SOMERSETSHIRE REEF.)
This reef was opened about January, 1860, by
two miners, whose names the writer lias for-
gotten. Work was commenced On the western
side of the hill, on a small leader in which gold
was found on the surface. About a bucket
full of very rich specimens were obtained almost
as soon as Work was commenced, and "Sanguine
expectations were entertained that they had,
using the men’s own expression, “tapped the
jugular vein at last.” Unfortunately they were
doomed to disappointment, the specimens found
proved to be only a patch, and at a very few
feet deeper the stone ran out to a mere thread;
this leader had an eastern underlay, and the
prospectors thinking that it would make again
at a greater depth, commenced a shaft on the
eastern side of the hill, with the idea of inter-
secting or cutting it again by driving. In
putting down this shaft another body of stone
was discovered about two feet in thickness, from
this likewise some very good specimens were
obtained, but at a depth of thirty feet it like-
wise ran out to a few threads ; the shaft was
sunk, and these small leaders followed to a
depth of sixty feet, a drive was then put in. but
at a shallower depth, for the purpose of cutting
the leader first struck on the surface on the
western side of the hill, but from this work no
profitable results accrued. The prospectors’
funds having become exhausted They determined
to abandon the ground ; before doing so how-
ever, they washed the stone they had obtained
from the eastern shaft, about a ton and a-half,
and obtained from it 7 dwts of loose gold, and a
bucketful of small stone all showing specks of
the precious metal. Had there been crushing
machinery within available distance this stone
would doubtless have had a fair trial, but at the
time alluded to there was no machinery nearer
than Xingower, and the circumstances of the
men were such as placed it out of their power to
risk the expense of carting so great a distance
upon an uncertainty as to the result- Ultimately


the prospectors of the Somersetshire Beef, very
much against their inclination, abandoned it.
But the ground had too promising an aspect
for it long to remain without an owner, and
it was almost immediately taken up by Messrs
Johnson, Buchanan and Co., this time under
the title of the Daly Beef, the name being given
in compliment to Mr Italy, one of the then
resident wardens. After carrying on prospect-
ing for a short time in the old workings the
surface was examined a short distance further
north, resulting in the discovery of a very valu-
able body of stone, portions of it yielding as
much as 10| ounces to the ton, so rich indeed
was it that immense sums were offered for the
purchase of shares, but fortunately for the
would be purchasers the prospectors refused all
offers, as the stone run out to a few small
leaders at a depth of about thirty feet. A
detailed account of the produce of this block of
stone has not been preserved, but the gross
yield was 167 tons of stone, giving 272 ounces
of gold, 106 ounces of this gold having been
obtained from 10 tons. A considerable amount
of prospecting was then done, not attended how-
ever with any satisfactory result, and in July,
1862, the claim was registered. On the term
of registration expiring, work was resumed, re-
sulting in the abandonment of the claim about
the beginning of the year 1864. During pros-
pecting trials were made from various bodies of
stone, these crushings proved that the claim
contains a considerable amount of stone above
water level worth from 2 dwts to 7 dwts to the
ton. No attempts have been made to penetrate
to a greater depth, the water being an insur-
mountable obstacle. In No. 1 north, work was
commenced in April, 1860. Gold was first
found in a small slate leader, at a depth of about
30 feet, but the leader itself was of too small
proportions to think of crushing from it, sinking
was therefore continued to a depth of about 60
feet, prospects apparently payable were ob-
tained at this level, and 5 tons were sent to the
mill for trial and gave a yield of 6 dwts to the
ton, a further trial of 9’tons giving only 4 dwts
to the ton. Sinking was then again resumed,


when at a depth of about 60 feet a leader af
about a foot in thickness was discovered at the
western end of the shaft, from which a first-
rate prospect was obtained; one ton was sent to
the mill to test its value, and yielded the very
satisfactory result of 10 ounces ; an opening out
was here made, and the following erushings
were obtained.

Showing an average of 10 dwts to the ton.
The lode from which the above was obtained,
was eventually found to be identical with that
from which the prospectors obtained their rich
pitch; it was worked down to a depth of 110
feet, at which level it run out to a few small
leaders, but a drive at a depth of 140 feet in
the next claim north, had revealed the fact,
that the lode made again, and at the level at
which the drive had cut through, it was about
12 feet in width. Measures were then taken
in No. 1 to get on this stone, and as the work-


mgs at the 110 feet level were a considerable
distance from the first shaft, in consequence of
the lode taking a western underlay, it was
determined to sink a fresh one as far westward
as would enable them to intersect it in sinking,
at about the level at which it had been obtained
in ho. 2. The shaft was commenced and pro-
ceeded to a depth of 80 feet, when the unsatis-
factory and shabby behaviour of their so-called
backers induced the working shareholders in a
fit of disgust to abandon id But ground of
this sort rarely goes long begging for owners,
in this instance it was almost immediately taken
up. But the work executed by the new pro-
prietors has not been productive of profitable
results, all the work done having been, in the
opinion of the first holders, very wide of the
proper spot. The lode in this claim dips sharply
to the north. There has been but a limited
amount of prospecting, no driving having been
executed below a level of 4U feet. There is
stone left in this claim to almost an unlimited
extent, that would yield from 3 to 5 dwts to the
ton.
No. 2, North, has had a very great amount
of work done in it, but nothing has ever been
found sufficiently remunerative to pay for the
labour expended on it. In this claim, there is
an immense body of stone, from which crush-
ings amounting in the whole to about 50 or 60
tons, have been had at various times, giving
yields varying from 2to dwts to the ton.
There are two shafts on this claim, the western one
having had the greatest amount of work
expended on it, sinking having been continued
to a depth of over 200 feet. .Reference has al-
ready been made in the account of No. 1, to a
drive in this claim at the 140 feet level, in
which it was proved that the lode that had
there been worked and had tailed out, made
again This stone was found about 12 foot
westward of the shaft, it was driven through
and a trial of about 10 or 15 tons gave a return
of between 4 and 5 dwts to the ton ; the lode is
about 21 feet in thickness. At the time this
discovery was made, it was deemed valueless
by the proprietors, owing to fhe expense of cart-


ing and crushing, but the probability is that the
time is near at hand when a lode of stone of
this quality and size will be viewed with a
different eye.
In No. B, North, one shaft only has been sunk,
there has been a considerable amount of
driving, but no discoveries have been made
beyond that of finding an almost unlimited
amount of stone, worth from 1 to about 3 dwts.
to the ton.
Of the claim south of the prospectors, there
is little to record, the ground having hitherto
proved almost valueless; one small patch of
auriferous stone was found on the surface in
No. 1, but it very soon ran out, and all subse-
quent work was entirely unproductive of profit-
able results. In Nos. 2 and 3 (amalgamated)
a few specimens were once found in a small
leader about 12 feet from the surface, but as
nothing more was ever discovered, it was
generally believed that the few specks that were
found, were a small family of unfortunates, that
had strayed away from home, and had lost
themselves. The southern end of Nos, 2 and 3
terminate in the gully at the foot of the hill,
and ends what is called Daly’s reef, the ground
following southward, although, doubtless, the
same reef, has always been known as the
Kentish, the history of which will form the
subject of the next chapter.


Chapter XVII.
The Kentish Reef.
In pursuance of a rule adopted in writing this
history of noticing the prospecting claim first,
a stride of about a quarter of a mile southward
must now be taken from the point at which the
last chapter concluded, in order to enable a
starting to be made from the customary point.
The prospecting claim was marked out in about
the middle of the year 1860. There is very
little really authentic, and no documentary in-
formation obtainable respecting this, or any of
the half-dozen neighboring claims ; there have,
without doubt, been valuable patches in most of
them, but none were of an extent to give any
long continuous work. The most valuable
information in connection with this ground for
the guidance of future operations, is the fact
that at water-level a body of stone exists 30 feet
in thickness, which will yield 3 dwts. to the
ton all through, and one smaller leader on the
western side, the last crushing from which, in
the prospecting claim at the same level, gave
II dwts to the ton. As soon as water was
struck in this ground, the influx was so great
as to put all further operations out of the ques-
tion without the aid of steam pumping ma-
chinery. In No. 5, North, a body of stone
was struck in 1862, at a depth of 130 feet, which
was supposed to be payable. One of the share-
holders, a Mr G-reany, on an occasion of his
paying a visit to the claim, descended the
shaft to inspect the new discovery. On ascend-
ing, he unfortunately fell off the rope, and was
precipitated a depth of 100 feet and killed on
the spot. For reasons never satisfactorily stated,
(perhaps unwillingness to work where so
shocking an accident had happened) this shaft
has never since been worked. A fi’esh shaft
was sunk but the result of the work hitherto
has not been of a payable character. The
next ground, comprising Nos. 6,7, and 8, north,
is known as the Garibaldi claim. This ground
has been, and doubtless will be again, a valu-
able and paying property. Cmsbiug commenced


in this claim in 1861, and from this date to
November, 1862, stone was operated upon
amounting to 2871 tons, which yielded 1460
ounces of gold, showing an average of over 10
dwts to the ton. At this time the proprietors
agreed to form a joint stock company, for the
purpose of facilitating the erection of a crushing
and pumping plant. In furtherance of this
object, the claim was inspected by Mr King,
mining surveyor, who gave it as his opinion
that 27,000 tons of stone remained in the claim
above water level, similar to that already raised.
But the endeavors to establish this company
met with an abrupt interruption. The calamity
before referred to in this history, namely the
greatfire in December, 1862, rendered all efforts
in the matter utterly abortive. The last num-
ber of the first Inglewood Advertiser , published
before the fire, contains the prospectus of the
company.
Bather more than two years from the present
time of writing, the Garibaldi Company,—the
original holders of this ground—was broken up
and the claim sold. The work done by the new
proprietors was more with a view of testing
the mine, than any regular system of operations.
The lode at this time was tried at various levels
from 14 down to 70 feet. At 14 feet from
the surface 3 tons were tried, and it was found
to be worth 3 dwts to the ton. From the 20
feet level, 19 tons were sent to the mill; this
yielded only ]} dwts. to the ton. From the 50ft
level, 3 tons gave 3 dwts to the ton; and the
last crushing from the 70 feet level gave 6 dwts
to the ton. In the course of the above trial
work, 10 tons were obtained from a small
leader on the western side of the main lode,
which yielded dwts to the ton, but there is
no more of the same quality actually known of.
At the water level, namely 165 feet, the lode is
18 feet in thickness, and its value as proved by
crushing a very small quantity, is about 3 dwts
to the ton.
In the next claim, namely, No. 9, two shafts
have been sunk, one at the north end of the
claim to a depth of 130 feet, and one on the
south, 132 feet. In the latter shaft, a body of


stone was found twenty-five feet in width. Two
trial crushings were had, the first producing 2|
dwts, and the second 1| dwts to the ton. A
drive has been put in and the above stone cut
likewise at the 30 feet level. The lode was
here found to he seven feet in thickness. A
trial crushing of 10 tons from this level went to
the mill but gave a return of only 2 dwts to
the ton. The shaft has been sunk to a little
below water level, at which depth the reef
appeared to be increasing in size, and prospects
about equal to those at a shallower depth could
be obtained. The first proprietors abandoned
this ground in May, 1863, since which time no
work of any description has been done in it.
The neighbouring ground north —that is to say,
that extending as far as Nos 2 and 3, south
Daly Reef, has had shafts sunk on it in various
places, but has hitherto proved utterly value-
less, no work having been done on it for several
years.
The last era in the history of this line, is, the
formation of a Joint Stock Company, to be
called the Garibaldi and Kentish United Gold
Mining Company, the ground proposed to be
worked comprising a lease that includes within
its boundaries 460 yards of the line of reef. The
advertisement for registering the company
under the Limited Liability Act, appeared in
the columns of the Inglewood Sentinel, on the
12th Jan., 1866. The company is formed with
a nominal capital of £25,000, in twenty-five
thousand shares of £1 each. Since the com-
pany has started, their operations have been
entirely of a prospecting character, the principal,
part of the work done having been at the 140
feet level, and so far as the work has proceeded
the results have been of an encouraging
-character. It is the intention of the company
as soon as the mine is thoroughly tested to erect
a powerful crushing plant for the purpose of
'working the ground to advantage.


Chapter XVIII.
GENERAL SUMMARY.
It was stated at the opening of the present
history, that it was the intention to compile it
from “reliable sources,” as it was felt “that
records of this nature are worse than useless
if their authenticity cannot be relied on.”
Having arrived at the end of information of the
character above alluded to —at least so far as
accounts of returns are concerned—it is pro-
posed to draw the work to a conclusion, as it is
considered that no mining history can be in any
degree useful as a record for reference that
has not included in it an account of the yields
of the different claims, presented in such a form
as to enable the reader to trace the varying
value of the ground during the time it may have
been worked. As a fitting termination, the
following synopsis is offered, showing the gross
produce of the different lines of reefs, the num-
ber of tons crushed, the amount of gold obtained
from each, and the average value ; to which is
added a few remarks on each, bringing the his-
tory of the whole down to the present time.

It will be seen from the above list that the
Columbian stands first in point of average value,
it being a trifle over ozs 17 dwts 12 grs for


the total produce of the various claims. It was
stated at the end of the history of this reef,
that the operations of the company who now
hold possession of the whole line, were brought
to a dead stand; since then work of a prospect-
ing character has been resumed, the result of
which has been reported to be of an exceedingly
encouraging character ; the pumping and crush-
ing plant, however, remains in a state of inac-
tivity.
The Jeesey Reef has produced an average
of nearly If ozs to the ton. This average is
arrived at by allowing •§• an ounce to the ton,
for the first 2659 ounces produced from the
Victoria Company’s ground; this is supposed
by men qualified to judge to have been about its
value; the exact number of tons crushed to
produce the amount is not known, as the book
in which the amounts were kept has been mis-
laic. Nothing remains to be said of this line
of reef beyond what has already been written.
The Maxwell’s Reef ranks next; its average
being a trifle over loz 9 dwts to the ton. The
only circumstance remaining to be noted with
respect to this line, is that of arrangements
having been entered into by the Enterprise
Company for the erection of a pumping and
winding machine for the purpose of more
efficiently working their ground; along the
remainder of the line everything is at a complete
standstill.
The JV3 oening Stae shows an average of a
little over loz 7 dwts to the ton. This average
is produced exclusive of the stone produced
from No. 4 North in the early time of its work-
ing ; as before stated, authentic accounts can-
not be obtained, but as far as traditionary
accounts are concerned, there is every proba-
bility that if added they would tend to materially
raise the general average value of the whole
line. The project of forming a Joint Stock
Company, spoken of at the close of the history
of this reef, for the purpose of working the line,
has fallen through ; work after the old fashion
is going on in one or two claims, but the greater
part of the line is in a state of total inactivity.
Buchanan’s Reef stands next, the returns


showing an average value of 1 oz 5} 2 dwts to the
ton; the returns of this reef are, however, not
complete, there being a deficiency of a greater
portion of the yield of the Prospecting Claim,
which, if added, would considerably raise the
average value of the whole. This ground, in-
cluding the American and Nil Desperandum
Eeef s, is held under lease, and remains in a state
of complete inactivity. It is strange that this
state of things should so long continue in the
face of the well-known fact that stone in
enormous quantities and of a paying character,
is known to exist in this ground.
The Godwin Eeef has produced an average
of nearly oz to the ton, nothing remains to be
said of this line beyond what has already been
written.
The Eeality Eeef takes next place, its aver-
age being within a fraction of an ounce to the
ton. At the present time work of a prospecting
character is being steadily carried on; but
nothing producing a profitable result has been
done on this line for some time.
The Leicester Eeef has given an average of
nearly 18£ dwts to the ton. All that remains
to be said of this reef, is, that operations of the
same languid character as those that have
characterized it for some time past are still
-carried on.
The March Eeef has given an average of
rather over 17-2- dwts to the ton. This reef is
now distinguished as having produced more
stone than any other in the district. Since
writing the history of this line of reef, the Hope
and Anchor Company have made discoveries of
a very valuable character in their claim. A
lode entirely distinct from that originally worked
has been found; and on March 26th, a crush-
ing was completed from it of 113 tons, which
gave the satisfactory return of 120 ozs 19 dwts
17 grs; this has given an impetus to operations
southward, and prospecting is being carried on
on this part of the line with spirit. The ground
held by the Unity Company still maintains its
■name as one of the best claims in the district.
Operations in the prospecting claim are still in
a state of suspensio ~ pending the formation of


the Joint Stock Company spoken of in the
latter part of the account already written of this
claim. The Independent Company still remains
idle for want of rain-water to work their engine.
With respect to the claims north of the In-
dependent Company’s ground, nothing remains
to be added to that which has already been
written.
The Old Inglewood shows an average of
14dwt Bgr to the ton, but it must be borne in
mind that this does not by any means describe
the average of the total produce of the line, as,
for instance, gold to the value of £13,000, from
the Prospecting Claim, has not been taken into
account, in consequence of the amount of stone
from which it was produced not being known ;
but it is a well ascertained fact that stone in
large quantities has been produced from this
ground worth nearly 9oz to the ton; it is, there-
fore, tolerably certain that an account of the
different crushings from this claim would have
materially altered the above-mentioned average.
Since the history of this reef was written, the
lease by which a large portion of the line was
held became forfeited ; the ground was, how-
ever, immediately re-occupied, and a co-opera-
tive company, called “The Royal Standard,” or-
ganised. Prospecting operations have since been
carried on with spirit, the result of which has
been of an encouraging and satisfactory charac-
ter.
The Povebty Eeef takes next place, its aver-
age being 13dwt Bgr to the ton. Since the ac-
count of this line was written, the pumping
plant on the claim of Messrs Baragwanath and
Samuel has been again set to work, and the
shaft has been sunk to a further depth of 30
feet, making it in all 225 feet deep. On re-
ferring to the account already written of this
line, it will be seen that first rate prospects are
spoken of as existing at a depth of 195 feet.
This stone has been again broken into at about
12 feet further down, and the lode at this level
proves to be of an exceedingly valuable charac-
ter. There appears to be every probability that
the enterprise and patient energy of Messrs
Baragwanath and Samuel in working this ground


is at last about to meet with a well merited re-
ward.
The Yeldham Reef shows an average of
13dwt 2gr to the ton. With respect to this line,
nothing remains to be added to that which has
already been written, further than that it still
remains in a state of desertion.
The Daly Reef shows an average of lOdwts
to the ton; this is, however, exclusive of the
Prospecting Claim, the proprietors never having
kept an account of the yield of it; but it is
tolerably certain that if added it would tend to
materially raise the above-mentioned average.
One claim only on this reef is being worked,
namely, that situated on the crown of the hill.
The northern end appears to be deserted; the
ground south of that which is being worked is
held under lease.
The Kentish Reef, which is a continuation
of thj Daly, shows exactly the same average,
namely, lOdwt to the ton ; this, however, relates
only to the ground originally known as the
G-aribaldi Company’s claim. The average value
of the stone crushed from the claims north of
them is considerably less, whilst the value of the
produce of the claims south is shaded in uncer-
tainty. Information of the whole of a suf-
ficiently reliable character for publication can-
not be obtained ; it is therefore thought best to
pass over the few traditionary records of yields
that alone remain obtainable. Little remaius to
be added to the account already written of this
line. The Garibaldi and Kentish United Gold
Mining Company still continue their prospect-
ing operations, which latterly have been of an
exceedingly encouraging character.
The Dreadnought Reef has produced an
average of 9dwt 14gr to the ton. Nothing fur-
ther remains to be said of this line, beyond the
fact of its still remaining in a deserted con-
dition.
The Bendigo Reef is the last on the list, its
average being sdwt 13gr to the ton. The whole
of this line is at present deserted ; but from the
large amount of stone that the ground is known
to contain, this will doubtless not be its fate for
long.


The Ameeican Reef —Anything approaching
the average value of the stone produced from
this reef cannot be given, correct detailed ac-
counts of the different yields, as stated in the
account of this line, not being obtainable.


[Thcfollowing summary, written by Mr H.
J. Congreve for the Inglewood Advertiser in
1879, will form a fitting termination to the pre-
sent edition of “The History of the Inglewood
Reefs.”]
Ho. I.
Attention having been called to the quartz
Reefs of Inglewood, through the success attend-
ing the operations of the Jersey Reef Co., we
deem it wise to furnish our readers with a sketch
of the reefing capabilities of the district. We
deem it the more necessary as while there are
still many amongst us who are acquainted with
some of the lines which were famous of yore,
there are but very few who ever speak of them
as a whole. There are, besides, many new
comers into the district, and capitalists from a
distance who will possibly be glad of a guide
upon which they can depend. It is our inten-
tion for their guidance to glance rapidly at the
various lines that have been opened, summaris-
ing the returns and the operations that have
been carried on. In some instances—from the
lapse of time since work was abandoned—the
information may be meagre, but in every in-
stance we shall endeavor to be truthful. As in
most cases, miners were attracted to Inglewood
by large alluvial deposits, but long before these
were exhausted the rich discoveries in the reefs
diverted the operations of a large number, and
during the year 1860 reef after reef was opened
up with astonishing rapidity. As a number of
the claims yielded capital returns, and more
good prospects, while many gave magnificent re-
turns, an excitement set in. This excitement
continued during ’6l and ’62, claims being taken
up in all directions and without judgment, and
there remained scarcely a rise but what had its
shaft or cutting, or some other indication of the
prospectors’ visit. This injudicious mining in
most cases being resultless, was followed by the
abandonment of many lines, and the disastrous
fire of 1862 completed the work by depriving


those who believed in the auriferous nature of
the country of the means of continuing their
search. So far as the reefs have been traced
they are scattered over a tract of country about
three miles north and south by a width of about
the same east and west. They are divided into
three main lines, with a number of intervening
ones. The three mainlines are distinguished as
follows: —The Maxwell’s, the most eastern ;
the Columbian, in the centre ; and the Jersey, to
the west. These lines are about half-a-nule
separate the one from the other, and upon the
course of their separate lodes most of the claims
that have paid well have been found. There are
many intermediate -reefs (so-called), and to the
east and west for a considerable distance pay-
able claims have been opened, but the three
lines above enumerated are, so far as at present
discovered, the main permanent lodes of the
district. The localities where the lodes bearing
their distinctive names were opened are situated
on the southern slope of the small range to the
north of Ingleweod, and are on spurs that run
down to the township. From them the largest
amount of quartz has been raised and with the
best returns. Beginning in order, the Maxwell s,
the most eastern of the three lines, first deserves
attention, and in speaking of it only the portion
bearing that name will be described; the other
•portions known bv distinctive names, though on
the same lode, will be spoken of under the names
they are known by. The Maxwell s Feel was
first discovered on the surface by Messrs Jciid-
law and party, some of whom have continued to
hold interests in the ground until within the hist
few weeks. The reef was of great width -and
the returns very handsome, yields of from too
JOozs to the 1 .ad being obtained, the stone eon-
tinning down to the water-level, to" (
chin tv was subsequently erected, and the shaft
deepened to 250 feet. A company was then
formed -and the shaft carried down and her 10 -
feet, when operations ceased. Np doubt th-
fact that there were large shareholders who were
unwilling, or unabl', to continue to pay the cal *
that were necessarily made in order to carry on
vigorous operations, led, as in many other m-


stances, to the stoppage of the works. Along
the line, up to and beyond the summit of the
range, numerous shafts have been sunk, in most
instances to the water level, and a large amount
of cross-cutting has been done. The result has
been the development of a permanent reef of
from 4 to 30 feet in width, traced to the water
level and of value differing from 2dwts to 36ozs
to the ton. Both south and north of the pros-
pecting claim there yet remain many thousands
of tons of stone with gold more or less through-
out —not deemed payable at the time of dis-
covery, but which would with proper appliances
and a systematic method of working doubtless
return payable results. The run of payable
gold, after leaving the prospecting claim, dipped
and rose again in No. 11, north, about 200 yards
distant, and then continued through Nos. 12,
13, and 14, yielding capital returns, the reef in
many places being 30 feet in width, and averag-
ing a return of loz Sdwts to the ton. In pro-
curing these results no machinery has been used
beyond the ordinary horse-whips and whims.
The greatest depth attained has been reached
in the Havilah Co.’s ground, where the shaft is
about 400 feet deep, but work in this ground, as
indeed along the line, is at a standstill. It is to
be hoped that the improved prospects in the
Jersey may stimulate operations on this line,
and there is little doubt that perseverance and
capital will render the line as remunerative as
heretofore. South of the Maxwell’s, but still
upon the same line of lode, is the “City of
Bath,” from which excellent stone was obtained,
the best from a series of flat reefs. Three
ounces to the ton was not an uncommon yield,
and still there is a large body of stone contain-
ing more or less gold waiting systematic de-
velopment. Still further south is the “Nairn-
shire,” crossing the railway line a little beyond
the station, and from which rich patches or
pockets have been obtained. The line then
crosses the Daly Lead, dipping below it, and
emerges again in the “Buchanan’s Beef,” and
the “American,” which two latter have yielded
several thousand ounces, giving an average of
over I|ozs to the load. None of these have ever

To the north of the Maxwell’s proper the line
has not been developed, an occasional claim,
as the “John Bull,” obtaining a little gold, but
there are no evidences that the reef has been
discovered. An extension of the line apparently
leaves the reefs of Thompson’s Gully to the
west. In all these claims sinking has been in-
variably carried down to the water, but in most
cases the reef has been left there for want of
means to erect the necessary machinery, or be-
cause the prospects at that depth were not con-
sidered sufficiently encouraging to warrant the
outlay. From the large yields hitherto obtained,
and the strength and permanence of the reef,
experienced men are of opinion that, with a
proper system of working and machinery, for
years to come large returns will follow energetic
operations.

There are other claims along the line from which

cords are to hand.
No. 11.
Tire next line that attracts attention is the
■one known as the “Columbian,” which lies mid-
way between the “Maxwell’s” and the “Jersey.”
This extends from the “Welcome,” at Thomp-
son’s Gully, in the north, to the “Greeks” in the
south. Upon this lode are situated a great
many of the once famous claims of Inglewood.
It includes—beginning at the south end of the
line—the “Greek’s,” “Exhibition,” “Goodwin,”
“Morning Star,” “March Reef,” “Columbian,”
and “Welcome.” All these at one time were
supposed to be separate reefs, but competent
mining authorities assert that they are portions
of one and the same lode. The Columbian
proper was first marked out by Messrs Wright,
Wheeler, A. John, and Heron, on the 30th No-
vember, 1869, but it was not until some months
after that payable stone was obtained. Acci-
dent then discovered the stone which yielded so
magnificently, the fame of which spread through-
out the world and stimulated exertions for the
discovery of the reefs throughout the district.
This reef differs from the Maxwell’s in not be-
ing so well defined, the stone being in blocks
with often long intervals between, without any
connection, and in the enormous bodies of stone
found on some portions of the line. These blocks
are scattered at various depths and positions
over a width of 150 feet, as in the “Morning
Star,” and payable gold at a width of 7O feet
has been found, as in the “March.” The whole


line —a length of over three milt s -was once
the scene of busy operations, hundreds of men
being employed. The first stone crushed from
the “Columbian” realised 6oz to the ton, from
the surface block, which however soon run out.
Subsequently other blocks were discovered,
which yielded magnificently, one crushing of 22
tons giving a cake of 28160 z smelted gold, or
over lOOoz to tlre ton. The golden stone which
■broke the surface in the prospecting claim con-
tinued to dip through the adjacent claims to the
north, where it entered the water at No. 5, and
remains unfollowed to the present day. As the
gold progressed to the north the reef widened,
and the stone became correspondingly poorer.
The stone has averaged from two to twelve feet
in thickness. The amount of gold procured from
these five claims, from authentic returns,
amounted to 26,127 ounces, from 4,435 tons
crushed, or an average of nearly 6oz to the ton.
After all the payable stone had been removed
to the water-level that could be found, the reef
lay idle for a long time, a little fossicking occa-
sionally being done. Subsequently a company
was formed, and extensive machinery erected,
but beyond putting down a shaft a long way to
the east of the reef and driving in, no work was
done Had this reef been on Sandhurst it would
not have stood idle so long. The magnificence
of the returns would certainly have tempted a
■more systematic and persevering search for the
missing reef, which all mining authorities say
must eventually be found. Considering the
amount of payable stone procured, and the rich
average returns, there is no reef in the district
where so little prospecting has been carried on.
South of the “Columbian,” and in immediate
proximity, lies the “Polka.” Tn this claim a
great deal of prospecting has been carried on
without any permanent results. Payable blocks
of small dimensions have been found, and it is
said as much as Bloz to the ton has been ob-
tained. As we follow the line further south,
here and there claims have been worked, from
which small returns have been obtained, but
nothing of consequence resulted until we come
to the “March Reef.” H ere work of an ex ten-


sire character lias been done, and alargeamonnt
of stone removed. Tlie “March” lies due west
of the town, and has yielded a large amount of
valuable stone. This portion of the lode was
first opened by Messrs Smith, Jewell, Birney,
and Dahl, in March, 1862, who obtained a pros-
pecting claim. The stone removed was from 12
to 25 feet in thickness, and 5098 tons crushed
gave an average of over loz 3dwts to the ton.
The same stone was discovered in the adjacent
ground to the south, belonging to the Unity
Company. There, however, it widened in places
to 70ft, the whole being removed for crushing,
and averaging 19dwts to the ton. Upon both
these claims at one time powerful pumping and
crushing machinery was employed, but prospects
falling off, and a large expenditure being re-
quired in consequence of the inadequate power
to contend with the water, operations ceased.
Further south still is the “Morning Star,”
wTiere blocks of stone have been met with at
various levels from near the surface to the
v ater, over a width of 150 feet. These blocks
have varied in size from a few tons up to hun-
dreds of tons, and a valuable reef still exists un-
broken in the water. Several thousand tons
have been raised with an average of loz 7dwt to
the ton. Machinery was at one time erected,
but it was unable to contend with the water,
and it 9as since been removed. Further to the
south lies the “Goodwin.” An immense body
of stone, which continues through several claims,
averages at the water level where tried 20 feet
in thickness. There is gold throughout, but so
far as tried it has only been payable in patches.
It once excited great attention, and was the
cause of several mining lawsuits. The yields
have been as high as 12oz to the ton, and heavy
dividends have been paid. The returns from
the claims upon this reef—as indeed upon most
of the reefs in the district—have not been pro-
perly kept, so that it is impossible to give the
full returns. However, so far as authentic re-
turns are available, they will be found in the
table below. Following still south is the “Ex-
hibition.” On this reef a number of claims
have been worked, and several shafts sunk to

body of stone, and the site is one of great pro-
mise, hut no large yields have been chronicled.
Still further south again is the “Greek’s.” In
this claim a large body of stone has been pros-
pected and traced to the water, where it is said
it is worth nearly half-an-ounce to the ton.
Some good crushings have been raised, and oc-
casional magnificent “bunches” of specimens
have been found. As much as 150 oz to the
bucket has been obtained, and old residents will
probably remember the splendid show of speci-
mens exhibited in the broker’s window, obtained
from this claim. This reef was, however,
patchy, and is now deserted. There are many
other portions of the Columbian lode besides
those already mentioned, where operations have
been carried on, in some cases with a portion of
success, but it would exceed the limits of this
article to enumerate them all. To the north of
the Columbian proper, for a long distance,
though a great deal of prospecting has been
carried on. the reef does not appear to have been
discovered until it again rises in the “Welcome,”
at Thompson’s Gully. There a body of stone
was struck, Or rather a series of bodies, the re-
turns from which have been variable, though it
is known that as high as 4oz have been obtained
from a crushing of 28 tons reduced at the Kin-
gower mill. An immense amount of work has
been done. A number of shafts have been sunk
to a great depth, and crosscuts at various levels
have been put in, at one place nearly through
the hill from east to west with stone all the

From the other claims along the line no re-
turns are procurable, but the above will serve
to show the great richness of the ground. A.
•thorough examination of the workings and the
. . ; _
primitive manner in which all operations have
been carried out, would convince any practical
miner that there is here a wide field and very
promising prospects. With the exception of the
March Reef Company no company has been
sufficiently in earnest in the prosecution of
search for the hidden treasure, or has had suffi-
cient capital to enable it to persevere to a

Having briefly described the Maxwell’s and
the Columbian lodes, the Jersey, the last of the
three main lodes of Inglewood, now remains to
be dealt with. On this lode are situated many
claims, whose names were once ou every Ji}\


and from whence large quantities of auriferous
quartz were raised. South, of the Jersey no
payable claims have been discovered. To tha
north, however, along the line extending as far
as Mount Rose, at Thompson’s Gully, here and
there the auriferous lode has cropped up, and
the “Kelverton,” “Old Inglewood,” “Permanent
Strata,” “Leicester,” “Ophir,” “Nelson,” “Wild
Rose,” and “Shamrock,” have each added their
quota to swell the returns from the Inglewood
reefs. The gold on this line was not first dis-
covered in the Jersey. The Old Inglewood and
the Nelson had been in work, and had yielded
largely ere the discovery was made which
brought the Jersey so prominently forward.
This portion of the reef was originally called
the “One Tree Hill,” from the fact that a soli-
tary tree crowns its summit, and remains as a
memento of its former activity and as a land-
mark amid the scrub. Though operations were
■commenced on the 3rd May, 1860, no payable
results followed until the 2nd July, 1861, when
a payable block was discovered at a depth of 85
feet, 8 tons of which yielded over 13ozs of gold.
The reef has not been of a continuous character,
but has been found to have occasional intervals
between, of either comparatively barren stone
or of slate and sandstone. Four separate runs
of stone have been discovered in some of the
claims —two bodies to the east of the main lode
and one to the west. These, when tried, have
been found to average from 2 to 4 feet in thick-
ness, with a yield of about sdwts. But little
work has, however, been done upon them. The
main lode has a thickness of from 3 to 30 feet,
and has yielded an average of about If ozs to the
ton. This includes all the stone, poor or rich,
of which there are any authentic returns. The
reef has been carried down to the water, with
gold more or less throughout The prospecting
claim has hitherto been the most payable. From
the time (May 27th, 1862) when the first divi-
dend was made until October, 1864, £30,416
was divided, or £7604 per fourth share. There
are still large hoc ies of stone throughout the
ground, and above water, estimated to be worth
from 4to 5 dwts to the ton. Payable stone has


been found in all the claims from No. 1 North
to No. 11 South, beyond which no discoveries
of importance have been made. The payable
stone from the prospecting claim dipped
through Nos. I, 2,3, and 4 south, and was lost
in No. 5 and 6 (known as the Little G-ern). It
dipped also to the north from the Victoria
Company’s ground (Nos. 7,8, 9, 10, and II)
into the same claim. The Jersey Company—
recently formed—have discovered golden stone
in their ground below the water level, and are
now actively engaged in raising quartz from
their two shafts. South of the Victoria Com-
pany’s ground nothing definite or payable has
been discovered. Proceeding along the line
north we come to the Kelverton, a claim which
once bore a high character. Two separate runs
of stone have been discovered here, the junction
of which has been traced. No regular returns
from this claim have been kept, but it is be-
lieved very handsome results followed the
operations carried on. The gold appears to
have been in patches, as there is a record of
one lot of 201bs yielding 20ozs of gold. A large
amount of work has been done in the shape of
sinking and driving. North of this lies the
Old Inglewood, more recently known as the
Poyal Standard, which was opened on the 27th
November, 1869, by Messrs Carter, Stewart,
Edel, and Thompson. The stone has been
traced below the water, but though containing
gold it is not in sufficient quantities to pay for
working. G-old has been found from this claim
in an almost unbroken line to the north for a
considerable distance. From the prospecting
claim there are no authentic returns, though it
is known that in a few months gold to the
value of £ 1 3,000 was obtained. A large crush-
ing and pumping plant was eventually placed
on the ground, but the original proprietors
having cleared out, and the purchaser of the
mine and plant having gone to England, pros-
pecting operations were abandoned, and the
machinery was used for public crushing. The
owner then dying the plant was sold and re-
moved, thus stopping completely the efforts
that were being made in adjoining claims to


'follow tlie lead. Previous to tlie stoppage of
the works, stone worth loz 2dwts to the ton was
traced from No. 1 North into the prospecting
claim, but it dipped south at such an angle
that, although the engine shaft was sunk to a
depth of 260 ft., it was not deep enough. From
the other claims to the north the accounts pre-
sei’ved are very meagre, but sufficient is known
of the ground to state that there are large
bodies of stone containing gold, more or less,
waiting further development. The next ground
of importance is that known as the Leicester,
with the European on a parallel line. This line
was opened in July, 186 i. The Leicester con-
sists of a large body of stone, which continues
through several claims, and has been left at the
water, a depth of about 150 ft. In the pros-
pecting claim the stone averaged 7 or Bft. wide
to a depth of 150 ft., giving returns of an ounce
to the ton. In No. 1 .North the stone widened
to 12ft., with nearly an ounce average. From
the southern claims the accounts are not so
good, though it is asserted that at the water
level stone 8 to 10ft in thickness, with
to the ton, has been left. The European at one
time yielded well, as much as 3ozs to the ton
having been procured, but no returns have been
kept. Several shafts have been sunk to the
water, one of them a large one, properly slabbed
and prepared for machinery. Such returns, as
results of crushings, as are obtainable, will be
found below. Following still along the line
north we come to the Nelson, once so famous
for its yields. Here, again, no records have
been kept, though it is well known that a
quantity of the stone yielded as high as 30ozs
to the ton, and in the “musician’s” claim, No. 2
N orth, from 7 to 28ozs to the ton was obtained.
In this claim, at the 80ft. level, a large body of
.stone averaged 4ozs to the ton, and considerably
below this level I2ozs to the ton was procured
But little work has been done on this ground
since the palmy days. A company was formed
and tried a few crushings here and there, but
without sufficient prospects to tempt
the shareholders to invest in machinery. The

driving has been extensive, and though now the
scrub has in a great measure grown up around
it, there is sufficient to reveal its once impor-
tance. Following along north there is nothing
worthy of notice for a long distance, until
Thompson’s Gully is reached. Here the line
again crops up on the high hill formerly known
as Mount Eose, but as the reefs at Thompson’s
Gully have some peculiarities, they will be
grouped by themselves in separate chapter.

These returns, though imperfect, will tend to
show the richness of the line and what pros-
pects there are for the employment of capital.

Having now disposed of the three main lines
•or lodes of Inglewood, it remains to speak of
those reefs which are scattered indiscriminately
between or outside of them. As these are so
numerous, the more important of them can only
be alluded to, and that briefly. Sufficient, how-
ever, will be said to show that the whole tract
of auriferous country already mentioned is full
of blocks of stone containing more or less of the
golden metal. This will apply more especially
to the country to the west of the town, where,
from the “Duke of Cornwall” to the “Cam-
brian,” a breadth of fully a quarter of a mile,
blocks of stone of various sizes and values have
been discovered at different levels the whole
way across. The first to be mentioned is the
’“Kentish,” the indications of which almost
warrant its being designated as a fourth main
lode. The large body of stene developed, con-
tinuing as it does from the surface to the water,
and having been traced in several claims, cer-
tainly present indications of stability, though
the returns were not of sufficient value to place
it in a foremost position with the other lodes.
The “Kentish” lode lies to the north of the
town, and runs through a rise which contributes
the highest portion of the range on which the
main lodes are found, and to the east of the
Maxwell's. It was first discovered on the hill
known as Daly’s, in January, 1860. Payable
gold was, however, only found in small blocks,
none of which yielded well. From No. 3 north,
to what was known as the “Garibaldi,” a dis-
tance of quite a quarter of a mile, a large body
of stone has been proved to exist the whole of


file way, and is found in some places to lie 30lt m
thickness at tlie water level—l6sft. This stone,
where records of trial crushings have been kept,
has yielded from to 7dwts. This is exclusive
of the returns given below, and which show an
average of over lOdwts to the ton. The portion
of the line to the north is known as the
'“Daly’s," and the remainder as the “Kentish.”

other claims not being procurable ;—•

West of the Maxwell’s, and midway between
the Maxwell’s and the Columbian, is the “Co-
naisky’s,” so named after the discoverer, who
finally cleared out with about £I2OO, made from
selling shares and the result of crushings. Though
a large body of stone exists in the ground, only
a small block traced from the surface to 25 to
30 feet was payable. This yielded from 3to 11
ozs to the ton. The only records are as follows
—Trial ton, 6ozs; 13 tons, 1430zs ; 30 tons, 90
ozs. Immense excitement was caused at the
time, people believing that a second Columbian
had been discovered. Still further over,
but west of the Columbian, is the “iiising Sun”
and the “Humbolt,” both on the same line. The
returns have, never been high on this line, a patch
of 12ozs being obtained from the “Humbolt,”
and small bodies of stone from the “iiising
Sun” ranging from 4| to 19dwts to the ton.
There are, however, several parallel runs of
stone throughout the ground more or less
auriferous. After crossing the Columbian line,
still proceeding west, the “Yulcan” attracts
attention. This was an immense body of stone
that proved highly auriferous. In one claim
alone a large body was removed and crushed
that was 7<» or 80 feet long by 30 feet wide, and
30 or 40 feet deep- The stone yielded from


lhalf an ounce to IJozs to tlie ton. No records,
■however, are obtainable from any of tbe claims..
From insufficient timbering the whole of the
above excavation collapsed, the working men
having a narrow escape by making their way
up the shaft of a neighboring claim about three
minutes before the whole of the ground fell in
But little work has been done since. Further
north, and considerably east of this line, is the
“Bock of Cashel,” formerly the “Princess Ale-
xandra,” though when first discovered called the
“Wellington.” It is at the head of Wellington
Gully and to the west of what was once called
the middle road to Thompson’s Gully. A. good
deal of gold has been procured at various times
by different parties, each party working out
the patch or block discovered by him, and then
after a little fossicking abandoning the ground.
Gold has been discovered from the surface to
150 ft, and the following, the only returns pro-
curable, will tend to show the value of the
stone :

Two or three separate runs of stone have been
found. East of the “March” the “Odin” is the
most noted. From this reef at one time very
good returns were obtained, and shares ex-
changed hands at high figures. No returns are
however to hand. At one time a private com-
pany erected a pumping and winding plant on
.the ground, and after some prospecting obtained
splendid prospects in the stone. The ground
was however patchy, and did not yield to pro-
mise. The following are the returns of all

As the company was a small one and the ex-
penses heavy, after two years prospecting the


works were stopped and the machinery sold.
West of the Jersey, and on the opposite hill, a
body of stone was discovered previous to the
great fire, which yielded sdwts to the ton.
Operations were stopped by that event, as the
working miners could not obtain backers. Still
further west is a line at one time called the
■“Perseverance,” from which 3ozs to the ton was
procured, but the payable stone running out the
place was deserted. Still further west a body
of stone has been opened up, proved to be 15ft
wide and worth 2dwts to the tons. The “Dart-
mouth,” which lies to the west of the “March,”
may probably be on the Jersey line. A large
amount of work has been done here, and excel-
lent stone was atone time procured. No reterns
are procurable. Between the “Dartmouth” and
the “March” lines is the “Cambrian,” from
which from time to time good crushings and re-
spectable dividends have been obtained, and
the auriferous stone was traced to the water. A
company was formed and an engine erected, the
prospects foretelling good results. Like the
■“Odin,” however, the yields were very poor, and
the company collapsed. South and west of the
■“Yulcan,” on the range running beside the
Columbian road, lies the “Eureka,” a reef from
which at one time much was expected. Stone,
however, averaging half an ounce to the ton
was all that resulted. Several shafts have been
sunk, and a large amount of driving has taken
place. North and west of the Maxwell's is
■“SimmomTs Beef.” Through this ground runs
a large body of stone, from which a great many
tons have been raised with a paying result of
from Sdwts to over loz to the ton. There still
remain many thousands of tons which were con-
sidered too poor at the time of working. The
number of tons raised, with the average returns,
are not to be obtained. A reef running through
the flat to the east of the town once attracted
considerable attention. It was opened by T.
Wilson, and called by him the “Mariner’s.”
One block of stone averaged an ounce to the
ton, but subsequent operations failed to dis-
cover anything but barren stone. The “Tara
Hall,” south of the town, respectably


tor a short period, but difficulties among share-
holders and diminished yields led to the aban-
donment of the ground. There are a great
number of other separate claims from which
gold, more or less, has been procured ; but the
very names of most of them have faded from
recollection. Amongst others may be men-
tioned the “Norfolk,” north of the Maxwell’s
and about half-a-mile west. Two ounces to the
ton was procured, and expectations ran high as
to its probable future. After a few good crush-
ings, and a considerable amount of prospecting,
it was abandoned. The “Liberty,” west of the
“Nelson,” at Old Inglewood, may also be men-
tioned. There two or three runs of stone more
or less auriferous have been discovered and
some payable crushings obtained, varying from
7dwts to l|ozs to the ton. The next number
will conclude the notice of the Inglewood reefs
with an account of those in the neighborhood of
Thompson’s Gully, and some tables which pro-
bably will prove useful. Errata.—ln No. 3

With a brief account of the reefs at Thomp-
son’s Gully, our notice of the quartz reefs of
Inglewood will terminate. These reefs are
situated on continuations of the two main lodes,
the Columbian and the Jersey—the Maxwell’s
line lying to the east. On the Columbian line
are the “Welcome” and the “Union Jack;” and
on the “Nelson” line, the reefs which crop up
all over the hill formerly known as Mount Eose,
the highest ground in the neighborhood. Treat-
ing first the Columbian line, the “Welcome,”
being the most important, requires considera-
tion. The reef here crops up in several places
over a considerable breadth along the ridges
and payable gold has been found at intervale,
to a depth of 170 feet._ The grounds
having been previously prospected, was opened,
by Mr Cook on the 29th December, 1859, who


discovered gold on tlie surface, which was sub-
sequently followed to a depth of 40 feet, where
it ran out. The first trial ton, crushed at Kin-
gower, yielded 7ozs lodwts. Other crushings
from different claims have yielded from an
ounce to 12|ozs to the ton ; this from separate
bodies at various levels. The deepest shaft is
sunk to a depth of 240 feet, at which depth
stone of the value of 9|dwts to the ton was pro-
cured. On the claim known as No. 1 north,
three shafts have been sunk from east to west.
That known as the middle shaft is 150 feet deep,
the last 50 feet through solid stone of the
average value of 3|dwts to the ton. A singular
discovery of a pocket of loose gold, entirely free
from quartz and lying against the western back,
was made in one of the southern claims. It
weighed Bozs 15dwts, the neighboring stone at
the time averaging an ounce to the ton. This claim
was sunk to 200 feet. The sinking on this line
was of a tolerable degree of softness, but at
145 feet the rock became very dense and sinking
difficult. A vast amount of work has been done,
and large bodies of stone containing gold have
been developed. Further north is the “Union
Jack,” distant from Inglewood over four miles,
and is one of the first reefs discovered. It is
noted chiefly for the immense body of stone
which crops the surface, and has been followed
to a depth of 240 feel without striking water.
The stone breaks the surface for a distance of
say 300 yards, with an occasional dip, and gold
has been found throughout. The highest crush-
ing of which there is any record was taken from
the surface, 10ft of stone in width being crushed
with a yield of 15dwts to the ton; subsequently
the whole width was crushed (20ft) with re-
turns of half-an-ounee, 9dwts, 7dwts, and down
to Idwt to the ton. The stone is throughout
said to be of an almost uniform width. North,
and adjoining the “Union Jack,” is the “Fyfe-
shire,” once celebrated for its yields, as much
as six and seven ounces to the ton having been
realised. There are three separate lines of
stone in this ground, from two of which the
above results were obtained. The “Union Jack”
line, however, only realised one ounce to the


‘ton. No definite information of work or fC-
suits can be obtained. The rock in which the
quartz is embedded is a hard blue rock, similar
to Mount Horse. Through this latter hill the
'course of the Jersey lode runs. Here there has
been great disturbance of the strata, and from
the southern slope over the crown of the hill to
the western slope, leaders and bodies of stone
have been discovered more or less auriferous.
The principal line is about 300 feet from the
summit, and from north to south gold has been
found throughout. The south end was called
the “Wild Eose,” and the north the “Shane-
rock,” both extremties paying for the efforts
made to develope them. Though the line pre-
serves its northerly bearing, the intervening
strata is turned and twisted very much, as in
the “Shamrock” shaft, where the direction of
the stone worked was nearly due east and west,
twisting back towards its proper course at 90ft.
The “Wild Eose” was opened in the latter end
of 1860, and a shaft sunk 64 feet. The stone
■crushed only yielding 6dwts to the ton, the
claim was abandoned. In 1861 John O Brien
■and mate took up the ground, and from the
same shaft, at a depth of 12ft, raised five tons
with a return of sozs 13dwts. Subsequently
the whole of the stone was removed from the
surface to a depth of 90ft, with a width of from
6 inches to 9 feet, and back about 40 feet north.
The lode was patchy, some of it yielding as
high as 7 ozs to the ton, the gold always being
more abundant in the neighborhood of mundic.
The highest yield along this line was obtained
from a claim called “No. 2 South Shamrock.
Here one ton from a surface leader gave a re-
turn of 20ozs. The leader was very narrow,
and as it widened became much poorer. The
southend of the line—the “Shamrock”—was
discovered by Mr Banburry, who opened a body
of stone on the surface 5 or 6 feet wide, the first
trial from which yielded Bozs 4|dwts. The
■stone has been carried to a depth of 120 ft, with
variable results. No payable quartz was ob-
tained below 80ft. and the block which had been
worked, and which had been pointing almost
east and west, gradually turned until at the


greatest depth attained it lay within a point of
due north and south. The returns from this
line will be found below. These returns are not
perfect, as the records of many crushings, both
good and bad, cannot be obtained. Numerous
other leaders have been opened, containing
gold, right up to and on the crest of the hill,
but the line described is the most permanent
yet discovered. The run of gold was almost
invariably perpendicular. On the western slope
of the hill is the “Highland.” It is situated
about the same distance from the top of the hill
as the “Wild Eose,” but is of more recent dis-
covery. At least five runs of auriferous stone
have been discovered, being from 2 to 6 feet
wide. No remarkable returns have been ob-
tained; the works are of quite a primitive
character, the deepest shaft not being more than
50ft. The highest return that is on record is
from 26 tons. Several shafts have been
sunk upon this hill, the deepest being the
“Shamrock” —120 ft. The sinking, consisting
of blue rock, is the hardest in the district, for
after the first 4 or sft not a foot can be pene-
trated without powder; and the quartz necessi-
tates the same agent for its removal. Doubtless
this extreme hardness has acted as a bar to
much prospecting, and has prevented, notwith-
standing the good prospects, a thorough search
for a permanent reef. There are other claims
in this district, such as the “Curlew,” “Metro-
politan,” “Homeward Bound,” “Scandinavian,”
and Bristol,” but there is nothing distinctive
either in their character or yields. The “Cur-
lew,” though it attracted so much attention and
was thought so highly of that a fourth share
brought a very high figure, never realised to
promise. With the exceptions of a few tons
crushed, and a shaft or two sunk, after one or
two trials it was finally abandoned. The
highest yield was 4 oz to the ton, and the pros-
pectors worked it in the ordinary digger fashion.
£7O worth of gold was washed in a week out of
the surface rubble. Of the other claims no re-
cords are preserved.

ings from Thompson’s Gully reefs obtainable: —

The above returns give an average of nearly
I4dwts for the returns from the Thompson’s
Gully reefs. This paper —No. s—concludes5 —concludes our
brief epitome of the Inglewood reefs. As
many facts as could be gathered together in a
necessarily circumscribed space have been ar-
ranged with a view to their usefulness. We
think a careful perusal of them will lead to the
conviction that there must be still waiting the
explorations of the miner many valuable bodies
of stone, and that energy, capital, good machi-
nery, and intelligent labor, will again restore
the lost prestige of the Inglewood reefs.

At one time eight crashing machines were
kept tally employed in redacing the qaartz, bat
one fey one they were removed. Only one at
last was left, in the neighborhood of the Colum-
bian, and that was for a long time idle. It has
lately passed into the hands of Brace & Co., who
have pat it into thorough repair and erected
proper furnaces, and supplied all the appliances
for the redaction of the stone and the preserva-
tion of the gold. It is kept in fall work and
has given every satisfaction.
