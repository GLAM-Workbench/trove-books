BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS.
The College Buildings form a picturesque group on the side of a hill near
Galong, within convenient distance of the Railway Station. As the latest
additions were only completed in 1918, the College is fitted up with every
modern convenience. Electric Light is supplied from Burren Juck. Hot and
cold water are laid on while the sanitary arrangements are excellent.
The Buildings are spacious and thoroughly ventilated. The appointments
are most carefully arranged for the comfort and convenience of the pupils.
Ample provision for open-air sleeping.
The Grounds contain Tennis Court and Pavilion, Cricket and Football
Fields, while the beautiful open country surrounding the College provides
charming walks for the boys, in which rambles they are always accompanied
by the teachers.
A Wireless Receiving Set has been installed at the College.

SITUATION.
The position of the College is one of the finest in Australia, being on the
trunk-line mid-way between Melbourne and Sydney. There is no place iu
Australia more conveniently situated as to railway access. The climate is
extremely healthy, being subject to no extremes of either heat or cold.
Galong is situated on the Great Southern Railway Line, between Harden
and Yass.
SUPERVISION.
The Boys are under the constant supervision of the Sisters, whose aim is
to surround them with a homelike atmosphere while training them to habits
of interest and study.
In this way a solid foundation will be laid for more advanced work in
after years.
Boys are taken from the age of five years.
There is a Trained Nurse on the Staff.
Boarders do not leave the College during the term, but are allowed out on
Visiting Days, then only under the care of parents or guardians.
Visiting Days are the second Saturday and Sunday of each month.
