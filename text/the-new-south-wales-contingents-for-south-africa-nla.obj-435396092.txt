Australians €mplrc.
TIE NEW SOUTH WILES CONTINGENTS
man who prophesied a year ago that the close of 1899, and the beginning of 1900 would see the
Australia? seething with the war spirit would have been laughed at. Certainly we had many
enthusiastic volunteers. In years past a precedent was set by New South Wales sending a body of
her troops to the Soudan. Nothing of this prepared us for the actuality of to-day.
There were so many preliminaries to the war with the South African Republics that many Australians
believed that it would never eventuate, and if it did would be a matter of a few weeks. So when war was
actually announced the volunteering enthusiasm was practically confined to those desirous of having an
interesting adventure and some military training. There were not wanting men who declared that for the
Australians it would be “ a picnic,” and they would never see an angry shot fired. Therefore, although the
loyal enthusiasm was great when the first contingent was ready to go, although volunteers were so far in excess
of the number required that most stringent medical tests had to be adopted, with a view to weeding out the
men ; and although the public made a mighty demonstration when they left, it was all as nothing to what
was to come.
The accident of 100 of the New South Wales Lancers being at Aldershot for training enabled New
South Wales to land the first Australasian troops on African soil, as they called at the Cape on their homeward
voyage soon after war was declared. Some of the other colonies had been earlier in the field with their actual
contingents, but once underway “the mother colony” forged ahead of all. Volunteers poured into the
Sydney depots. The doctors would have nothing short of physical perfection, and men were rejected for a
few defective teeth. The first idea of the Colonies was that they should send mounted infantry, who would
be peculiarly fitted to meet the Boers at their own style of warfare. The War Office vetoed this, and said that
only infantry was wanted, and also declined to accept the very efficient A Battery of the Permanent Artillery,
the finest field battery in Australasia. They, however, agreed to accept a half Field Hospital Corps from the
New South Wales Army Medical Corps. The consequence was that New South Wales sent at first foot soldiers,
and put many of its best artillery horses and artillery men at the disposal of the medical corps. That the
Colony best grasped the requirements of the situation time has proved. The foot soldiers we sent out have
now been mounted. The half-field hospital proved better equipped than the Imperial corps, and the British
were blocked for both cavalry and artillery. During November the first contingent went away amid great
enthusiasm. It consisted of Infantry, Medical Corps, and a draft to fill the Lancers already at the front, with
horses for all the Lancers.
Presently the Imperial forces began to find the task set them much greater than they had imagined.
They found, too, the Colonials to supply a serious want in their army organisation. So there came a request
for another half section of the New South Wales Army Medical Corps ; and when the reverses at Magersfontein,
Stormberg, and Colenso, became known, and Mr. Lyne, the New South Wales Premier, voiced the feeling of
Australia in offering whatever men the Empire required, prompt acceptance came and enthusiasm knew no
bounds. Everywhere men offered their services, and the Defence Minister, Mr. See, was kept going night and
day organising the drafts. This time the A Battery was gladly accepted and all the mounted men offered.
So on December 30th, 1899, A Battery embarked, and on January 17th, 1900, amid a scene of unparalleled
enthusiasm, the Mounted Infantry, Australian Horse and Army Medical Corps embarked. After that the
Bushmen’s Corps, consisting of men trained in bush lore, was speedily organised and shipped, followed by
more Lancers, and still a third contingent prepared. And each check to the British arms but increased the
flow of volunteers and the determination of the Colonies to assist. What the enthusiasm was can best be
gauged from the pictures that follow.

CROWN ROCOCO PORTRAITS.
word “ ROCOCO ” had never been used in any part
of the world in connection with a photographic process
until we adopted it in June, 1894. But, by a point of
law, we were unable to retain it. At that time we adopted
a very delicate and beautiful process known as “ GELATINO-
EROMIDE ON BARYTA.” It consists of a perfect
blending of two of the most powerful factors in the production
of permanent photography. The effect being the pure whites
and decided blacks of the steel plate engraving, with the
addition of a highly burnished surface. Many experts had
for a long time endeavored to produce pure whites, with
decided blacks, but this result had never before been
obtained. This process requires the most skilful treatment
by practical operators. Each of our assistants has been
specially trained, and they are thus able to produce the best
possible results.
Crown Rococo Portraits are FAR AND AWAY better
than any other portraits.
