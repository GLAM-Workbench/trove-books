Gentlemen,
AS a General Election will shortly lake place,
consequent upon tlie death of our much beloved Sovereign, I
Hake the earliest opportunity of offering* myself as a Candidate for the
[distinguished honour of Representing you in Parliament.
| Having been born, and for many years resided. In your County, I
[must ever feel the most lively interest in your welfare; and should I
'be so fortunate as to succeed in this the highest object of my ambi-
? lion, and become the Representative of my native County, I hope by
>my public conduct, and attention to your general and individual in-
terests, to prove myself worthy of the confidence reposed in me.
i I arn detained here by my official duties, and when the last melan-
'choly ceremonies to his late Majesty have been performed, I shall
?have the opportunity of waiting upon you to solicit your support and
[interest.
\ I am, Gentlemen,
Your most faithful and obedient Servant,

I TO THE GENTLEMEN, CLERGY, AND FREEHOLDERS, OF
THE COUNTY OF ANGLESEY.
? Gentlemen,
,rpHE near approach of a Dissolution of Parliament
?JL again calls upon me to renew, with my warmest acknowledg-
ments for your past support, the tender of my services to become
[ your future Representative.
f I trust that I have fulfilled the expectations under which I originally
[attained your confidence, and that, should you again honour me by
jyour choice, I may have the happiness to confirm my claim to its con-
! tinuance by an unremitting attention to your interests.
I have the honour to be.
With the utmost gratitude and respect,
Gentlemen, your most faithful and obedient Servant,
London, July 6. UXBRIDGE. .
[TO THE GENTLEMEN, CLERGY, AND FREEHOLDERS OF THE
I COUNTY OF SURREY.
i Gentlemen,
AS by the lamented demise of his Majesty a Dis-
solution of the present Parliament must soon occur, I lake the
{liberty of again soliciting the honour of your suffrages at the ap-
[preaching Election.
j Daring the three Parliaments your kindness has elevated me f.� the
[station of being your Representative, it has been my earnest en-
[deavour to adhere to those public principles which first procured me
{(he favour of your support, and in no instance whatever to neglect
jyour internal concerns or local interests.
| Should I prove so fortunate as to be again returned the Member for
lyour opulent County, you may depend upon my firm attachment
? (through every political event) to the same line of conduct, and my
[best endeavours to lighten the burthens, economise the resources, and
[promote the prosperity of the country.
j* With every feeling of gratitude for the favours you have conferred
(upon me,
I have the honour to be. Gentlemen,
Your most obliged and faithful servant,

TO THE GENTLEMEN, CLERGY, AND FREEHOLDERS OF THE
COUNTY PALATINE OF LANCASTER,
j Gentlemen,
SOME lime since I had the honour of offering my-
self to you as a Candidate for the future Representation of this
[County.
I The recent melancholy event, which hastens the Dissolution of the
[present Parliament, compels me to intrude myself again upon your
[notice, and to commence u general canvass*.
| It is my anxious wish to have the honour of waiting personally upon
[each individual Freeholder, but the Elective body of this populous
[County is so immense, that I much fear time will not allow me fully to
[accomplish so arduous an undertaking. I must, therefore, throw my-
iself upon your indulgence, and beg that if, through accident or want
3of time, I should omitany Individual or any district, the omission may
[bo attributed to its proper cause, and not to any disrespect or uegli-
fgcnce on my part.
I I take tliis opportunity of expressing the grateful sense f feel of the
Ekhul and flattering manner in which my former Address was received,
[and of the friendly offers of support which have flowed in from all
[quarters. These, together with the gratifying reception I met with
|tn a tour through a considerable portion of the County, give me the
[greatestconfidence in attaining the object of my ambition; and I
[look forward with pleasure to that time when it will be my pride, as
I well as my duty, to devote myself to the interests of the County
I Palatine.
I have the honour to be. Gentlemen,
Your most faithful and obedient Servant,
JOHN WILSON PATTEN.
I Bank Hall, 30th June, 1830. ______
TO THE FREEHOLDERS OF NORFOLK.
j Gentlemen,
THE approaching Dissolution of Parliament ob-
Hges me once more to solicit your votes at the next Election,
j Gentlemen, I have no new promises to make. My whole life is be-
fore you. It is now half a century since I first had the honour of repre-
senting you. I came forward as a Whig; as racb 1 have acted from
that day to the present, and as such alone can I ever serve you. This
jit is that has kept me steady throughout all the changes and revolution
[of our eventful times, and I now lookback with honest pride to the
Mifferent effect of the Whig principles which I have followed, and the
[Tory principles which I have opposed, in producing good or mischief
[to my country.
I When I first took my seat the American War was raging with fury.
It was a war of the Court and the Tories to enslave our fellow-country-
|men. After many years of national delusion and disgrace Whig prin-
ciples, and the persevering assertion of them by Mr. Fox, produced a
[majority in Urn House of Commons against its continuance, and I had
[the distinguished honour of moving, and carrying up to tke Throne, in
]1782,an Address which put an end to it.
I After this Mr. Pitt was made Minister; the House of Commons de-
clared that it had no confidence in him. He continued Minister, not-
withstanding, for 18 years. What were the consequences of that de-
jparture from the principles and best practice of our Constitution ? A
[war against France to putdown liberty in that country; rebellion and
[insurrection in Ireland; taxes under which our agriculture and com-
merce are sinking every day; the lawful currency of our country
[changed under circumstances which rendered a return to it impossible
[without the certainty of private rain and the risk of public confusion;
|a series of the moat oppressive laws against our liberties; the sus-
Ipension of the Habeas Corpus; and, finally, the establishment of such
la system of Parliamentary corruption and almost general venality in
[the State, as to make it now doubtful whether it be not grown 100
[strong for an honest Minister to grapple with, or for any power to
jeontroul, except that of tl>e people themselves, derived through a
I tree and reformed House of Commons,
I Such has been the eflect of following Tory principle* and a Tory
iMihister.
I But, Gentlemen, there lives, happily, in the heart of man a feeling
Kwhich corruption cannot reach, and which persecution cannot extin-
|gui.sh? it is that of his right to worship God according to his own con-
JscteLCe. Although the cause of civil liberty, therefore, notwitbstaud-
ling all our efforts to maintain it according to our Constitution of 1688,
ihave so greatly suffered during this period, we may console ourselves
I with the reflection that, by our means, religious liberty is maintained
Bby us upon the same principles, with tlie same perseverance; and, at an
lequai sacrifice of every object of personal ambition, has finally
?triumphed over intolerance, and wc may hope, under the auspices of
la new reign, will now lend a helping hand to her sister cause.
I Gentlemen?St is the boast of my public life, and will be my comfort
|at its close, that it exhibits this contrast in a single page?that I can
?show you on one side the wars which I have opposed, the distresses
iwhich I have endeavoured to avert from you, the infractions of our
?Constitution which I have resisted; and, on the other, tyranny in
| America defeated, the Slave Trade prohibited, the Press, by Mr. Fox?s
i Act, protected and secured, the Criminal Law amended and mitigated,
Jthe Test Act repealed, and the Catholics* Disabilities abolished.
1 have the honour to remain.
Your faithful humble Servant,
| July 5, 1830. THOMAS WILLIAM COKE.
WESTMINSTER ELECTION. - At a MEET-
\ TV ING of ELEC TORS of WESTMINSTER, Friends of Par-
[liamentary Reform, held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Strand,
lon Friday, July 2, 1630,
Mr. THOMAS DE YEAR, in the Chair,
f It was Resolved Unanimously,
\ That the official announcement of an immediate Dissolution of Par-
liament renders it necessary that provision should be made without
[delay for securing the Representation of Westminster in men de-
|voted to the great principles of civil and religious liberty,
i That the undeviating rectitude which has marked the conduct of
[Sir Francis Burdett thiouglumta long political career, in all the great
[struggles for civil and religious liberty, entitle him to the gratitude,
[esteem, and confidence, of the Electors of Westminster, whose prin-
[c ijiles he has, upon all great occasion?, so zealously and eloquently
[upheld.
I Tuat the Electors of Westminster have equal reason to be proud of
[the disinterested zeal, talent, and integrity, which their other Repre-
sentative, John Cam Hobhouse, Esq., has evinced in advocating their
[cause, both in and out of Parliament; as also for the great labour and
[ability lie has displayed in promoting the local interests of the house-
[in Iders.
[ -That under these considerations invitations be respectfully given
[to Sir Francis Burdett, Bart, and to John Cam Hobhouse, Esq. for
[permission to put them in nomination at the next vacancy for the Re-
[ presentation of the City of Westminster; and, in the event of their
{consent being given, lo make the necessary arrangements for securing
[their return.
j That the foregoing Resolutions be signed by the Chairman of this
[Meeting, and be forwarded to Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam
[Hobhouse, Esq. THOS. DE YEAR,
j The following communications have been received in answer to the
[above; ?
? St. James?s-place, July 3,1830.
f ? Sir, ?After so long a connexion with the City of Westminster, it is
[no small gratification to me to learn, by the Resolutions which you
[have just put into my hands, that your brother Electors are again
[willing to honour me with their confidence. Any efforts which I have
been able to make in behalf of Civil and Religious Liberty have re-
ceived additional importance from their kind and steady support; and
so long as they shall think me a fit Representative of their own gene-
rous attachment to the true principles of the English Constitution, and
to that great cause of Parliamentary Reform, by which alone those
principles can fairly be called into action, it will bo my pride, as well
as my duty, to devote'myself to their service.
? I remain, respectfully, your faithful humble servant,
? FRANCIS BURDETT.
? To Mr. De Year, Chairman ofa Meeting of Electors of Westminster.?
? 21, Charles-sheet, Berkeley-square, July 3, 1830.
? Sir, ?I am happy to find that my public conduct has been approved
iby the Electors of Westminster, friends of Parliamentary Reform,
[whose Resolutions you have been so good as to forward me. I accept
[with much respect their offer of again nominating me for the Repre-
sentation of their great City; and should I be, for the third time,
[chosen to fill lhat important station, I hope to shew that I am hot un-
|worthy of their continued confidence.
| ?I have the honour to remain, Sir, your most faithful servant,
? JOHN C. HOBHOUSE.

. , IN THE MATTER OF JODRELL A LUNATIC.
Ibis petition was for the purpose of taking the ouinion
of lbe Court, whether the sum of 2,800 1, per annum, the annua?
allowance given for the maintenance of the Lunatic, should be
all paid over to the Committees?of the person in one sum, and
prospectively, or whether it shouH be paid quarterly for She
ftuure, in consequence of the Lunatic?s dangerous state of health
The petition had been ordered to stand over, to give the netL
turner an opportunity of answering the affidavits of the other
parties. On being mentioned to thei Court this day, it was pro-
posed that the Lord Chancellor should read over the affidavits of
each party, and give his opinion as to the necessity of paying the
whole sum ove.r in advance, according lo a former order of the
quarterly Wbetber lhe a| l��' a u a e should be paid for the future
The Solicitor General, with the consent of Mr. Horne
said, that the Learned Gentleman on a former occasion had
erroneously stated to the Court, that the object of this petition
was to reduce the amount of the?annual allowance, and that
such erroneous statement having got into the newspapers? he
wished it to be understood that the object of the petition was not to
reduce one shilling from the allowance ; but that tbe only object
W'as (as above stated) that the annual allowance, in consequence
of the dangerous stale of the lunatic?s health, might for the future
be paid quarterly, or as lhe Court should think proper.
