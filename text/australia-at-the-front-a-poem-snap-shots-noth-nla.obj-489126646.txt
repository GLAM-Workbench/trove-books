PREFACE.
It was my intention, when I first learned that the
Australians were about to proceed to Soutli Africa,
to endeavour to write a poem, wherein their career
would be followed throughout the war, and such de-
tails as I considered necessary entered into. But, I
found this would be impracticable ; I had overrated
my strength. The years I carried on my shoulders,
nearly eight-five, and many, many years of sickness
and suffering, had so sapped my physical and mental
powers, that I was compelled to throw up the sponge.
But, I was determined to have a say, however little
and unworthy it might be, upon a subject I had so
much at heart. I, accordingly, whenever an idea put
in an appearance, bearing upon the matter, dotted
it down in words. I afterwards strung them together
and made them rhyme in the best way I was able.
The poem, as I call it, is nothing more than a suc-
cession of “ SNAP SHOTS,” which I trust the mem-
bers of the contingents, my friends, and the public
may consider to be not very far wide of the
“ White.”

DEDICATION.
In dedicating “Australia at the Front” to you the
members of the Australian Contingents (including
these of New Zealand), I may be taxed with neglect-
ing the conventional courtesy of first asking permis-
sion to do so. To this I plead guilty, with extenuat-
ing circumstances, which are, that I could not possibly
obtain that permission, the * members ” being scat-
tered over so many thousand square miles of land
and water, that I could not reach them either col-
lectively or individually.
Such being the case, I conceived myself free to
take advantage of so favourable an opportunity of ex-
pressing my profound respect and admiration for you
who by your devoted loyalty, dauntless courage, and
the unflinching manner in which you faced dangers and
difficulties that appeared insurmountable, together with
the tact and skill you displayed in meeting the Boers,
as it were on their own platform, and beating them,
which undoubtedly had the effect of lessening the dura-
tion of hostilities, and hastening the coming of that
peace which had been so long delayed.
Your appearance on the stage, with your Cana-
dian brothers, where you played your parts, with a
nerve and coolness which equalled that of veteran
actors ; taken in unison with the wonderful enthusiasm
exhibited on every foot of British territory within


and beyond the seas, and the more than wonderful
resources of ttie Empire, which were not, for a mo-
ment strained, must have shown to Kruger that the
piomises made by European Powers to help him would
not be kept, while it must have been equally clear to
these Povers, that to interfere practically would ex-
hibit a fatuity beyond belief.
Again, the sudden and unexpected appearance of
an additional fighting element by the side of Great
Britain, which will grow in volume and importance
in proportion to the increase of population, and be a
lasting faithful and ever dependable ally, must result
in changing the open and concealed features of the
policies of the Continental Empires in their dealings
with Great Britain, even more marked that they were
when .Marlborough and Eugene drove the marshals of
Louis the Fourteenth before them, or when Welling-
ton drove those of Napoleon from Torres Vedras to
the Pyrenees, and afterwards Napoleon himself from
Waterloo to Saint Helena.
Whether those changes will tend to lessen or widen
the breaches which now exist, or whether the jeal-
ousies of one another which have hitherto prevented
three of the great Powers from appearing before the
gates of Britain and Constantinople, and Bussia from
swooping down upon India, it is impossible to pre-
dict. “No one,” says the Spanish proverb, “ has seen
to morrow.” But, whatever it may be, the men of
Australia will be ready to follow the example you
have set them, and, in my opinion, so long as you
stand “ shoulder to shoulder,” with one another, and


Avith your brothers in the old country, Great Britain
Avill maintain her supremacy, and proceed, without
pause, to fulfil the mission entrusted to her, by Him
who lias hitherto directed her steps, and given her
a place among the nations of the world, hitherto,
without parallel.
Trusting that my poor tribute of respect may
be received in a spirit like to that with which it is
offered, and that it may assist in keeping alive that
movement which has for its object the raising of a
monument to the memories of those who fought and
fell, and in honour of those who fought and returned
covered with glory, a monument which will be credit-
able to the people of the Australias, but, which, how-
ever magnificent it may be, cannot overshadow the
merits of those whose names will be inscribed thereon,
and the value of whose work is not yet grasped by
their fellow countrymen.
WM. HERBERT ROBISON.


Australia at the Front.
Vis Unita Fortior.
’ Up be bold.
Vanquish fatigue by energy of mind,
For not in plumes, or canopied in state
The soul wins fame.
Dante.
Snap Shots, Nothing More!
SNAP I.
Well done ! Well done ! Australia’s sons.
Your spurs you've featly won,
In highest strain of chivalry
You second are to none.
No story told that has survived,
The censorship of time.
Than in the one you play a part,
So near to the sublime ;
For minstrel, or for bard inspired,
No more exalted theme.
Nor one more brilliant with romance,
Wrought from his waking dream.
Go, search the annals of the past,
Since Hist Tv's Muse began,
To trace upon her virgin page,
The words and deeds of man.


Not one like yours is blazoned there,
No rival’s near its throne ;
It peerless reigns, unparalleled.
Transcendent and alone.
Waning never, linking ever,
The future with the past,
Illumining Time’s corridor.
From now unto the last.
A warning and rebuke to those,
Who seoffingly eschew.
What He has willed, what we have done,
And what we have to do.
A manifest to those who trust
In Him through good and ill,
Inspiring them, and strength’ning them,
To labour and fulfil.
With trembling lip and flashing eye,
Old folk the talc will tell,
How years ago, in Africa,
Their fathers fought and fell.
And not for glory or for fame,
Or with the mace of Might,
But for their Queen and Motherland,
For God and for their right
All honour and glory ever be.
To those who fought and fell ;
All honour and glory ecer le
To those who lived to tell
Of dauntless courage, high resolve,
Of loyalty which gives,
A lustre to a patriot’s grave,
A glory while he lives.


Raise up to them a monument,
Inscribe on it each name,
Or leave upon cur hist’ry’s page
A record of our shame.
For nobler, truer hearted men,
Have deathward ever trod.
To guard the ashes of their sires.
The altars of their God.
11.
Coming events for many years,
The fruitage of the past,
Had from the Transvaal o’er the Cape,
Their threat’ning shadows cast.
And as they lengthened day by day,
They frowned with darker hue,
While muttered threats and menaces,
To spoken utt’rance grew.
As fast as fly the Autumn’s leaves.
Before the Winter’s blast,
So wing the shadows and reveal,
The dangers long forecast.
Like storms unloosed the uncurbed Boers.
To instant action sprung.
Less fierce the blinded Cyclop’s roar
Their shouts with vengeance rung.
Untamed and brave as Goth or Hun,
When from their northern home.
They poured in hordes upon the South
To sack Imperial Rome.
While those who Britain hate and fear.
Looked on with pleased amaze,
To see that with rebellion’s fire.
The Transvaal was ablaze,


Amid the whirl the Kruger shrieks,
“ Go forth and lay them low.
The Lord is on our side, and will
Annihilate the foe.
Go ! Smite the tyrants hip and thigh
Their hosts and captains slay ;
Go ! Shed your blood and give your lives.
While I will watch and pray.
“ The Lord commands, by me, that you
Free born, shall free men be.
And that you drive these Britishers
Headlong into the sea.
Go forth, and these Egyptians spoil.
What’s theirs is yours by right ;
Too long they’ve battened on our soil,
A pestilence and blight.”
111.
As sudden as the vultures swoop
Upon their carrion prey,
Although no wing a minute since,
Was seen nigh or away.
So swooped the Boers, with vengeful cries,
(Their hatred so long nursed),
Upon the Cape and mad for loot,
They o’er our confines burst.
All compacts, treaties, laughed to scorn
Our Suzerainty denied ;
And with coarse taunts and insolence
Great Britain was defied.
Oom Paul with Fabian caution, and
With Mithridates craft,
His time awaited when to strike.
Then struck right to the haft.


Then once more Britain learned the truth,
So often taught of yore ;
That while she wooed the smiles of peace.
Neglected frowns of war.
She saw within her borders rage,
A fierce relentless foe.
And knew that she was unprepared
To ward or strike a blow.
Not greyhound loosened from the slips,
With more excitement springs.
Than Rumour, when all through the land,
War's dread alarum rings ;
As swift as thought, her brain coined news,
She scatters broadcast round,
And leavened as it was with truth.
It ready credence found.
She told of battles never fought,
Of sieges never laid ;
Of ambuscades and skirmishes.
Of sacks and moonlight raid ;
Of spies and traps, of stores of gold,
Of dynamite by tons,
Of eighty thousand Boers and armed
With eighty thousand guns.
She said that Dutchmen everywhere.
Would help with purse and hand ;
And that the Orange State had sworn.
To drive us from the land.
That Russia, France, and Germany,
Had promised Kruger aid ;
And France with Russia at her back,
Great Britain would invade.


That mercenary gutter snipes,
For blood and booty bound,
Were sneaking in, and some, oh ! “hame,
Were born on British ground.
Of this mixed seed, some fell on rocks,
And some by the wayside ;
Some blossomed, but, truth breathed on them.
And they as rumours—died.
With undiminished stock in hand,
And glib, unwearied tongue,
She raved and stormed about the clouds
That over Britain hung.
Then off she flew, but, looking back,
This Barthian shaft let fly,
“ You, like the hare, have many friends—
Like them—have no ally. - ’
IV.
Our giim old lion raised his head,
And shook his shaggy mane ;
“I see,'* he growled; “My Gallic friends
Are at their tricks again ;
Intriguing, titt’ring, chattering.
While sitting on a rail.
And boasting in falsetto notes,
Of jumping on my tail.”
“It strikes me very forcibly.
When they to jump prepare ;
Dare not will wait upon their would,
And murmur ‘As you were !’
They long, with their friends G. and R.,
For my sirloin a slice.
But taught by caution, dare not steal,
To buy—can’t pay the price.”


“That old fox Kruger’s bargaining.
Tor universal war.
That in the scrimmage he may keep
The Transvaal for the Boer.
Now, as this game would suit the books
Of 11. and F. and G.,
They’ve promised him—sub rosa—they
His faithful friends would be.”
“ The Kruger thinks that we shall do.
As we did years ago ;
Accept defeat, and give him best.
Without protest or blow.
But I have had more than enough,
Of G.O.M. device ;
I won’t put honour in my bag,
Nor buy peace at a price,”
“ But while a Cecil’s at the helm.
The old state shin to steer ;
And by his side, Joe Chamberlain,
Of that there's little fear.
They say that I have no ally,
They’ll find to their surprise ;
That when the fighting moment comes,
My Cubs are my allies.
“ And they who’ve promised Kruger aid ?
Whether they do or don’t.
Bests on this fact : If we should lose.
They will. If win, they won’t.
But, we can wait, my cubs and I,
My friends won’t leave the rail ;
They have the will, but not the pluck,
To tread upon my tail.”


V.
Britannica, from her sea girt throne.
Majestically rose.
To greet with frowns her surface friends,
With smiles her rooted foes.
Calm as the sea when softly breathes
The zephyrs o’er its waves ;
Firm as the rocks against whose base.
The storm-tossed billows rave.
Full well she, by experience knew,
Whose honeyed Avords were wiles;
Whose hate and envy lurked beneath
A thin veneer of smiles.
She knew their hopes to see her fail,
Their fears but ill concealed.
And laughed to see their keenest shafts
Fall blunted from her shield.
She knew France panted for the time,
When, without warning note,
Like tiger cat upon its prey)
To spring at Britain’s throat.
Her tierce vendetta ever breathes,
A deep, abiding threat ;
The sores of wounded vanity,
Forbid her to forget.
From Crecy to Saint Helena,
How oft by His decrees.
We’ve swept her armies from the land.
Her navies from the seas.
On Wagram’s blood-soaked field, she saw
All Europe ’neath her SAvay,
Save where Britannia’s trident blazed,
And sternly barred her way.


From Leipsic’s shambles, Moscow’s fires,
The conqu’rer conquered fled ;
Paving her way with human bones,
With dying and with dead.
Before the flutter of our flag,
Her plume torn Eagles flew ;
Wounded nigh death at Trafalgar,
They fell at Waterloo.
VI.
The people gather round the throne.
As in the days of old :
When Spanish wolves were ravening,
To spoil Britannia’s fold.
Twas then that our Elizabeth,
That grand old Tudor Queen,
A wiser, nobler, saving one,
The Earth has never seen.
As on through London streets she rode,
Thus to her subjects spoke ,
While they with loud exulting cheers,
A thousand echoes woke.
“ Go, whip them home, these boasting Dons,
Who dare invade my seas ;
Go, sink their lofty galleons,
And fire their argosies.”
“The Inquisition priests are there,
With tortures and with chains,
To rack and fetter English limbs,
And shackle English brains.
To sack your towns and villages,
Your women make their slaves ;
With fire burn out your faith, and fill
Unnumbered martyrs’ graves.


“ Let not 1 heir feet my shores profane,
Leave not a mast or sail
To cast a shadow on the waves,
Do it ! Nor dare to fail.”
They answer her “ So help us God,
We’ll back these braggarts drive.
And crush these hornets, who would sting.
Our Queen Bee in her hive.”
The mighty galleons were sunk.
The Argosies were burned ;
And of the “ Grand Armada,” but
A shattered half returned.
And not a sail was left to throw
A shadow on the waves,
And not a spar to rock above
A thousand nameless graves.
And English limbs remained unchained,
And English brains still free—
And from the struggle England rose
“ The Mistress of the Sea.”
And as along the lines she rode,
At far famed Tilbury Fort ;
“ I am not here to-day,” she said.
“ For pastime or for sport ;
But I have come to swear to you,
That, firm resolved am I,
To share with you the battle’s heat.
With you to live or die.”
“ Aye, even in the very dust.
Will willingly lay down,
For you my people, and my God,
My life’s blood and my Crown,


I liave the body of a weak
And feeble woman —true ;
But of a King I have the heart.
And King of England too.”
And through all time, more kingly words
Have never uttered been,
Than those that day were spoken by,
Our grand old Tudor Queen.
They lired the blood, they nerved the arm.
And fiercely rose the cry :
“As she for us, so we for her,
And for our Faith will die.”
Those wmrds by some forgotten are,
By some were never known ;
Or from the verge of memory,
A transient flash have thrown.
But the spirit they engendered is
The birthright of our race ;
Bequeathed by those whose entity.
There is not left a trace.
VII.
Will she, who had all Europe faced.
And down her gauntlet thrown.
And in her rectitude supreme,
Imperious stood alone.
Will she, with drooping crest look on,
Her meteor flag unfurled,
Though all the world upon her shores
Their countless cohorts hurled ?
Yes, when her dills have sunk into
The fathomless profound,
And when her w r orks of brain and hand,
Lie crumbling on the ground.


Will she stand by, with sword unsheathed.
And bide the will of those .
Who hate her, fear her, do not dare
To strike as open foes ?
Or tear with sacrilegious hands,
The records of her fame.
And purchase a degrading peace.
And chronicle her shame ?
By Heaven’s help—By Heaven No !
Sound to the very core,
She’ll stand as Freedom's Sentinel,
Prepared for peace or war.
And Europe, she will face again,
Her gauntlet in her hand ;
And doubly armed with Right and Might,
Alone imperious stand.
No ! Not alone ! That Court’s decree,
’Gainst which are no appeals,
And which by signs and miracles,
To man it’s will reveals ;
Has, by it’s living witnesses,
A Miracle—made known ,
That not again, come weal, come woe,
Will Britain stand alone.
VIII.
From out her globe encircling arms,
Where’er her banner flies.
By one resistless impulse fired,
Britannia’s children rise.
They knew not whence, nor questioned why,
That sudden impulse came ,
Or how what first appeared a spark,
Was kindled to a flame.


What ho ! What ho ! Who shall be first ?
A glorious strife began ;
By Heaven ! There was no first or last,
All struggled to the van.
And gallantly Australia’s sons,
Their country’s colours bore.
And kept them there, with those which flew.
The foremost at t lie fore.
Premeditation there was none,
Nor forward looking thought,
Of what to them of good or ill.
The future might be fraught.
They recked not they, who right, who wrong,
And who and where the foe,
That danger threatened Britain was
Enough for them to know.
They heard the Transvaal had rebelled,
That it had war declared
’Gainst Motherland, ’twas all they knew,
For nothing more they cared.
To some Com Paul was but a name,
The Transvaal little less.
But what the trouble was about
They did not risk a guess.
No fears, no doubts, no stop, nor stay,
No shall, or shall we not ;
No turning back while muttering,
That “Something was forgot.”
No jealousies of race or creed.
No wherefore, why, or pause ;
Dane, Briton, Saxon, Gael, and Celt,
One heart, one arm, one cause.


Although the fledglings long had flown,
Ami found elsewhere to rest,
They could not, would not, never did,
Forget the parent nest.
Their children now, are with their sires,
In loyalty alike ;
And they who strike a blow at them,
Must through their offspring strike.
And they resolved to show the world,
From j)easant to the throne.
In war or peace, Great Britain hence,
Would never he alone.
They vowed by Heaven, Earth, and Faith,
That they would stand between,
The hosts that dared to raise a hand,
’Gainst Motherland and Queen.
And these were not distempered words,
Repented when too late ;
But solemn words as strong as Death,
And fixed and firm as Fate.
It was no evanescent flash,
But everlasting light
Which will with clearer lustre flame.
The darker troubles light.
They spoke like men, whose liberties.
They knew by field and flood
Were won by their brave ancestors,
And purchased with their blood.
And if, like them, they fought and died,
How glorious it would be
To know, in Freedom’s home, that thev
Wore worthy to be free.


That Britain would not win the day,
Or dared to be untrue
To centuries of victory.
And for peace humbly sue.
It was as likely that the stars
Would fall, or that the moon,
Would sailing up the eastern sky,
Outshine the sun at noon.
But when ’twas rumoured Germany
Had promised Kruger aid,
And France with Russia at her back,
Great Britain would invade.
'J hough this was openly denied,
In secret they prepare,
Unitedly to strike a blow,
'They do not, singly, dare.
Twas this that made them knit their brows,
And sent a hasty flood
A' through their veins from brain to heart
Of their ancestral blood.
Twas then they felt, with glow of pride,
That, by dear Heaven’s grace.
The Freedom they inherited.
Was theirs by right of race.
IX.
Britannia, girded by her sons.
With mutual trust replete ;
Their hearts with hers, and hers with theirs,
In unison will beat.
With hand on hilt, and blade unsheathed,
What she has won she’ll keep,
And with God’s help what she has sown,
She will in good time reap.


She knows until the tenth Command
Is needed not—’till then,
The sword must be, as it has been.
Far mightier than the pen.
Henceforth, if wronged, the warping Word,
If heeded not—the Blow ;
Peace she will hail with Honour —YES !
Peace without Honour —XO !
X.
Away from country, kith, and kin,
And all their hearts held dear ;
Which memory, the far away,
Was ever bringing near.
While never ceased that childhood’s song.
That Heaven sent refrain
Of “ Home, sweet home,” which from home’s lips,
They might not hear again.
All they had done, and seen, and felt,
Joys, sorrows, smiles, and tears ;
All they had lost and loved, still loved —
The garnering of years.
The dear old mother's age-worn face,
Still beautiful to them — •
She, in their hearts’ exhaustless mine.
The fondly cherished gem.
The grand old Dad, whose snow-white hair.
Of time and rev’rence rife ;
A gift placed there by nature’s hand,
To crown a well spent life.
Brothers and sisters, mates and friends.
Their childhood’s, youthhood’s games ;
Their quarrels, fights, and makings up,
Their hopes, ambitions, aims,


The voices that “ God bless You ” sobbed.
Were floating in the air.
The last fond look, the hand’s last grasp,
They saw and felt them there.
The garden gate, the yielding waist,
The love light in the eye ;
The “ Yes ” a silver lining to.
The tear full cloud “ Good-bye.”
They hear the break-a-day’s boys song,
The dingo’s dismal yell ;
The lowing of the distant herd.
The drowsy cattle bell.
They hear the plover’s plaintive cry,
Upon the evening breeze ;
The watchdog’s bark, the woodman’s axe.
The crash of falling trees.
The angry howl of wounded hound,
(“ The old man is at bay ”)
The hawks arc circling overhead
Expectant of their prey.
They see the bush rats creeping out
From rotting hollofw logs ;
They hear the jacky’s jarring laugh,
And orchestra of frogs.
The wild, wild bush, the tangled scrub.
The fierce and desp’rate ride ;
With fire before, and fire behind.
Death riding side by side.
The plunge into the swirling flood,
The breathless, fearful strife
’Twixt man and horse, and rushing stream,
A very fight for life.


The cattle on the breezy downs.
Nigh hidden by the grass ;
The startled buzzards on the wing
In clouds before them pass.
The rounding up, the break away.
The crack of stockman’s whip ;
The branding, shearing, and the shed.
The cutting out, the dip.
All there and more, will ever come.
Wherever they may roam ;
The fantasque visions of a dream.
But —’tis a dream of home.
Although within their hearts nnfst lurk
That ever haunting pain ;
That fearful doubt, that all they love,
They ne’er may see again.
But never think those loyal men.
Will 11 inch or be untrue.
Or that they tremble at the thought.
Of what they have to do.
They have a duty to perform.
They’ve sworn it shall be done,
They know they have a goal to win.
And vowed it shall be won.
Oh ! doubt them not, those gallant men.
If tears should fall the while.
For they who weep not when there’s cause.
Don’t trust them when they smile.
XI.
“ That’s just where it comes in Tom,
’Tis time that we should know ;
If we came here to lick the Boers,
Or just sent out for show.


To whisper love to Dutchman’s vrow 7 s,
I know 7 it ain’t polite ;
But by the girls we’ve left behind,
I would much rather fight.”
Eight, Jack, I long to have a slap
At French and German scums ;
Who hate old England, but w 7 ho love
Their gold and silver crumbs.
They’re sneaking in by land and seas,
Like jackals on their prey,
To rob alike friends or foes,
Then cut their throats for pay.”
Their bosses say ’tis gainst their will,
But why don’t they prevent,
You know it is an adage old.
That silence gives consent.
It makes me sw r ear and grit my teeth,
I’d tie them in a sack ;
And range them at the cannon’s mouth.
And blow 7 them piecemeal back.
I’m tired of this do nothing game.
This weary “ stand at ease,”
Have we such very tender feet.
That we must boil our peas ?
The news is flying thick and fast,
Of fighting ev’rywhere ;
It is a darned tarnation shame.
That w 7 e can’t have a share.
If they won’t send us to the front.
And serve us all alike,
And give us chances to be killed,
Damn me, if I don’t strike.


There’s Kruger too, that cunning Boer,
Skulks snugly in his lair,
He smokes, and drinks, his Bible quotes.
And swears the Lord is there.
Who tells him ev’ry Boer who falls,
Will straight to Heaven go ;
And ev’ry Britisher will be.
Pitched headlong down below.
Look out ! Look out ! Here comes mad Dick,
Upon his crop-eared black ;
As if the law and all its limbs.
Were pow’dring at his back.
“ What’s up ? What’s up ?” They round him crowd,
As from his horse he springs ;
He snatches off Jem Newman’s cap.
And in the air it flings.
“ Hip ! Hip ! Hurrah ! We’re off my boys,”
“ When ? Where ?”
“ At break of day.
The front. We’re ordered to the front.
Hip ! Hip ! my boys ; Hurrah ! Hurrah !
We’re ordered to the front.”
And devil a bit did they sleep that night,
There was lots to do, before morning light ;
There were horses and saddles, and bridles and bits,
Girths, headstalls, and rifles, and billies and kits.
When this was completed, then down they all sat,
To tinned meat and damper, and dishes of chat ;
With nips now and then, but the now came so fast,
And the thens that for shame’s sake, would not be
surpassed.
That the wits they erep out, as the nips they crept in.
There was boasting and bragging of battles they’d
win ;


And how that the Boers, they would scuttle and run,
And how they would tackle them twenty to one.
When Dick thundered cut, “ Smith, give us a song,
You can pick up the words as you travel along ;
For you can write rhymes—Quite as good as your prose,
“ I’ll just whet my whistle. Attention ! Here goes.”
We’re off at break of day, my boys,
We’re ordered to the front ;
What will the old folks say at home,
To know we’re at the front ?
To know we’re at the front, my boys,
To know we’re at the front ?
We’ll show them how we Austral lads,
The grisly boar can hunt.
We’ll tan their hides for saddle straps,
When we come from the front.
When we come from the front, my boys,
When we come from the front.
We’ll show them how that we can face.
The battle’s fiercest brunt.
And mid a storm of bullets keep.
Our faces to tlie front.
Our faces to the front, my boys.
Our faces to the front.
They’ll drive us to the sea, will they ?
Their vicious tusks we’ll blunt ;
Their bristles keep to clean our pipes,
While we are at the front.
While we are at the front, my boys,
While we are at the front.


And as for that old preaching boar,
Him from the rail we’ll shunt ;
And pack him off to Jericho,
Before we leave the front.
Before we leave tlie front, my bovs.
Before we leave the front.
And blazes, won’t ho pray and swear.
And at his losses grunt ;
And curse the very day that we
Were ordered to the front.
Were ordered to the front, my boys.
Were ordered to the front.
And woe to Leyds, that lying cuss,
We’ll hire old Charon’s punt ;
And ’cross the Styx will paddle him.
When we come from the front.
When we come from the front, my boys,
When we come from the front.
But, they are plucky chaps these Boers,
Of fighting we shan’t stunt.
And some of us—my dear old pals.
Won’t come back from the front.
Won’t come back from the front, old pals,
Won’t come back from the front,
i... . . ,
And none the worse we’ll fight, said Dick,
For what’s the credit—say.
To lick a snarling dingo bred.
Who snarls—then runs away.
And I’ve a notion, there are thoughts,
Which round our heart’s strings twine.
And prompt, that life is victor, when
We die —for —Auld Lang Syne.


And they went forth these gallant men.
Without a doubt or fear ;
No matter where, when Duty called,
Their answer will he “ Here.”
They were to be, not dreaming it.
The champions of a cause ;
“ The unity of blood and race.
Of language and of laws.”
XII.
To tell how they redemed their pledge.
No trumpets’ blaz’ning needs ;
Their words they drove home by their acts.
And clinched them by their deeds.
They gained an envious world's applause,
A deathless fame they won.
Ihey earned Great Britain’s gratitude,
For noble work well done.
They strengthened her supremacy,
More firmly fixed her throne ;
And wreathing laurels for her brow.
They wreathed them for their own.
On many a blood-soaked battlefield,
With veterans by their side ;
Gainst desp'rate odds they fought and stemmed,
The onset’s fiercest tide.
Though shot and shell tore through their ranks,
And comrades round them fall ;
And lurid smoke like breath from hell,
Hung round them as a pall.
They blanched not, quailed not, but amid
The cannon’s deaf’ning roar.
They gave their lives for Motherland,
They could not give her more.


Their names will live with those who fought,
With sword, with tongue, and pen,
For Faith, for Country, Liberty,
For God and fellow men.
As patriotic as the Bruce,
Devoted as was Tell •
As they who died on Abram’s heights,
And at Corunna fell.
XIII.
“Steady!” The grand old Colonel cried,
As to the front he dashed ; __
“Give them cold steel for lead, my lads,”
Then from him instant flashed—
“ For God and Right, Australia —Charge!
Together bide the blow !”
One cheer ; one prayer ; one glimpse of home,
And they were on the foe.
The grand old Colonel wiped his sword.
Upon his charger’s mane ;
“Well done ! Well done ! I hope to live.
To bid you charge again.
You fought as did your fathers fight,
On deck and battlefield.
And like to them, knew' how to die,
But knew' not how to yield.
“ The Norse blood surges through your veins,
You’ve sprung from that old stock,
W Inch never feared the wildest storm.
Nor battle’s fiercest shock.
Your baptism of fire you faced,
Right nobly to the hilt ;
And showed of what sound, sterling stuff,
Tou Austral chaps are built.”


While flushed each brow, and ev’ry heart
With pride exulting glowed.
He bent low as his bridle hand.
And onward slowly rode.
Then stopped, mid cheers, and pointing to
The field so dearly won.
He muttered ’neath his grey moustache,
“ By God, ’twas nobly done.”
XIV.
V ith loyalty's pillar of fire in front,
ith the old flag Hying o’er them ;
By the menvries of the mighty dead.
And the glorious task before them.
Ihey will gather round Britannia’s throne,
Whene’er it shall call or need them ;
While alien races beneath her rule.
Will die for those who had freed them.
They have taught a lesson to all the world.
And the world will not forget it ;
It is graven on ev’ry heart by Him,
Who had in His wisdom set it.
They knew that we countless as are the sands.
And though foaming waves divide us,
Are linked by the adamant chains of race,
Whatever the coming betide us.
It has learned that the cravings to see us fall,
As chaff by the winds, are scattered ;
And that all the yearnings for our decay,
As waves ’gainst our rocks are shattered.
And we, too, have learned a lesson as true
As the love of those who bore us,
the desp’rate struggles before us.
United we stand, divided we fall.


Grasp this a faith, and to it hold fast,
With passionate fervour, and never
Can aught ’neath the Heavens our phalanx destroy,
Or the ties that now bind us can sever.
And be quite as sure, we’ve a task to perform,
For so the Great Master has willed it.
And onward we must, and not faint on the way,
But labour until we’ve fulfilled it.
We have spread far and wide, like the banyan tree,
And deep as our oak have we rooted ;
The seed that was sown by the Raster’s hand,
Has sprung up, and flourished and fruited.
And further and wider our spreading will be,
And deeper and firmer our rooting ;
Till the seed from the seed of the Master’s hand.
Will over the wide world be fruiting.
XV.
Peace with Honour ? Yes. But it is
Beginning of an end ;
No human will can hasten it.
Nor human will forfend.
And what that end ? No intellect
Or faith can hope to grasp,
Nor with its octopus-like arms,
Can doubting Reason clasp.
Imperial Federation ? Yes,
But beyond ?
To Christianise ; to civilise ;
The onward path to light ;
To strike the fetters from the serf.
With Justice, Truth, and Right,


yd Britain’s glorious privilege,
None with it can compare,
’Tis one with her our fathers shared,.
And we must henceforth share.
Oh ! cling to her. There safety lies,
Eemember what’s she’s done •
Then how she will her work perform,.
Judge by the work she’s done.
XVI.
What has She Done ?
Beneath St. Paul's Majestic Dome,
Entombed the ashes lie,
The all of him, its Architect,
That could for ever die.
His Epitaph ? A word. But one
Ear reaching as profound,
Sublime in its simplicity,
“ CIRCUMSPTCE.”
Look around.
What has Britain Done ?
“ CIRCUMSPICE.”
Look around.
