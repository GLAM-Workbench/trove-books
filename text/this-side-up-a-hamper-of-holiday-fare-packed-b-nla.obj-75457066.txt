INTRODUCTION.
Christmas comes but once a year,
And when it comes it brings good cheer.
How old these lines are, or by whomsoever they were first written, does not
much concern any of our readers, who will all agree with us, however, that they
are just as true now as they were of old, and that they apply equally in our day,
to this side up as well as the other side. Do not mistake our meaning, for
we know that an excuse for a bad title is, perhaps, as lame as the explanation
of a bad joke, which only makes it worse. When we say ? this side up ? we
simply mean this side of our terrestrial globe?this Australian home of ours;
and when we write ? the other side,? we do not mean just over the straits,
but that dear old land from which many of us, fathers and mothers, came years
ago, and for which, and its holiday customs, we desire to instil into the minds of
young Australia the same admiration, affection, and reverence that John Bull
feels wherever he may roam. It is true, as it has often been asserted, that the
observances attending Christmas in Australia do not and never will assimilate
to that of jolly old Father Christmas in other countries; but it is equally true that,
from its spiritual inception, Christmas will never change so long as that religion
which owes its origin to the day continues to exist. The outward observance,
the merry sports, the rustic gatherings, may not compare with those of the olden
nor yet modern English Christmas; but so long as the spririt remains, with its
congratulatory greetings, and hearty good wishes, and its happy family reunions,
which, be it remembered, might in some families never take place but for that
blessed day, it cannot with truth be affirmed that there is no Christmas in
Australia. '
Amongst the modern Christmas customs of England is the production of
stories and sketches in varied forms and at all prices, from the humble sixpenny-
worth to the bulky Peter Parley's Annual, ox more expensive and handsome pre-
sentation guinea book. In this respect, at least, we in Australia attempt to copy,
in a small way, the customs of the old land ; and to this is owing the appear-
ance of '? This side up,? which we trust, with its array of contributors? names,
needs no excuse at our hands.
* � * *
Once more have the seasons passed over their time-beaten tracks, unmindful
of aught else but the appointed limits_ which mark the beginning and the
end of their existence. The gloom of winter now has past, and the glories of
the antipodean summer are upon us. Christmas-tide?that season of festivity
and rejoicing of which the immortal bard of Avon wrote ?
Ever ?gainst that season comes
Wherewith our Saviour?s birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long,
And then they say no spirit can walk abroad ;
The nights are wholesome then ; no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch has power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is the time?
has again visited us, and all are imbued with the spirit of the time. The strides
of civilization and the march of centuries have worked wondrous alterations in
the Ceremonies and customs pertaining to the season, and a retrospective glance
of the now almost forgotten observances which were wont to be regarded in
? Merrie Englande.? long before the existence of our adopted land was ever
dreamt of, is fraught with interest.


Festivities at the close of the year were first instituted by the ancient Romans.
They were then called the Saturnalia or the libertas Decembri ?a name which
indicates pretty plainly the month in which they were held. This holiday,
which was a season of licentious folly, lasted for a week, and during its continu-
ance nothing was heard but the din of revelry, and the foul mutterings of
unbridled excess. One-tenth part of a man?s income was appropriated to this
orgie; all exertion of the mind and body was forbidden ; nothing was to be read
or recited which did not provoke mirth; the slaves were allowed the utmost
freedom with their masters, and, in midst of all this disgusting indulgence,
strange to say, the holly-branches were sent round on their friendly errand from
house to house. This, however painfully it may clash with the reverential
affection we have for him, is the ignoble origin from which dear old
Father Christmas is derived. The Saturnalia introduced into Britain by the
Romans soon became intermingled in that country with the ceremonies
observed by the Druids at the same period of the year, and subsequently became
incorporated with the wild and grotesque mythology of the Saxons, and with
many of the uncouth and barbarous customs of the Danes, After these latter
came the Normans, bringing with them additions to the Christmas obser-
vances in the rudiments of mysteries and miracle plays, and of mummeries,
maskings, and pageants ?in fact, all the better and more lasting popular amuse-
ments of the season. Christianity, too, which had already reached the British
shores, and which had adopted the old Roman holiday as the time for the
celebration of the nativity, while it withered with its breath the more hideous
practices of our pagan ancestors, gave a new and brighter colour to what then
became, in a certain sense, the great Sabbath of the year.
Traces of the ancient Druidical rites are still to be found in the present day.
Notably amongst these is the consecration, so to speak, to our season of the
year of the mistletoe, which scarcely claims any notice whatever at any other
time. By the Druids it was held in especial reverence, and was in their wood-
land rites gathered with great ceremony with a golden sickle as a prelude to the
human sacrifices which they made to propitiate the gods. At the present day
it is associated with no such terrible import, but is rather honoured for the
privilege it confers upon the happy swain who may have the good fortune to
catch a maiden fair beneath its shadow.
The, yule-log, which is an indubitable relic of pagan times, is an enormous
block of timber, generally the stump of a large tree, which forms the Christmas
fire, and which, were it only for its pleasant music as it blazes and crackles in
the frosty night, must remain for ever an item in the programme of an English
Christmas. It is customary in some parts of England still to have the yule log
drawn in triumph from the woods, and as it passes along, accompanied by the
strains of merry music, each wayfarer raises his hat to the huge child of the
forest that is chosen for so sacred a purpose. The reason of this act of reverence
is to be found in the fact that the flame of the Christmas block has a peculiar
efficacy to burn out old wrongs and heart-burnings, and the liquor which it
causes to bubble in the wassail-bowl is quaffed not rarely to the drowning of
ancient feuds and animosities. When the log is placed in the kitchen a yule
song is sung by some one standing upon it. It is then put upon the hearth in
the midst of many curious and cabalistic proceedings, and fire set to it with a
lighted remnant of last year?s log which has been carefully preserved for the
purpose. It used to be regarded as a sign of very bad luck if a bare-footed
person, one who squinted, or a flat-footed woman, entered the house while it
was burning. An accompaniment of the yule-log was the Christmas candle,


of monstrous size, which was formerly used in England, and still in Ireland, and
sheds its light on the festive boards.
Wonderful things are told of the Christmas fare which belongs to the olden
days. Amongst the dishes peculiar to the season, the boar?s head seems to have
been held in highest honour. Heralded by the sound of trumpets, it was
carried on a lordly dish into the banqueting hall at the head of a noble pro-
cession, who sang as they advanced?
Caput Apri defero
Reddens laudh Domino
The boar?s head in hand bring I
With garlands gay and rosemary ;
I pray you all sing merrily.
Yui estis in convivio.
Next in importance to the brawner?s head came the peacock, which was gene-
rally served in a pie, at one end of which the painted plumage of his head and
neck was seen protruding from the crust, and at the other the gorgeous brilliancy
of his outspread tail. Geese, capons, pheasants drenched with amber- grease
carps? tongues, and the national dish, furmante or frumety, formed the humbler
viands of the occasion, and mince pies found also a place amongst the peculiar
edibles of the ancient Christmas.
So much for the old country. We now turn to more familiar scenes, with which
we have become accustomed in our Southern colonies. What a contrast do we
find ! Hoar frost and snow-storms that made us glad to wrap ourselves up
closely, and gave their charm to the fire blazing brightly in the grate, give place
to the hot-winds and scorching sun that accompany an Australian Christmas.
After all, even the English Christmas itself has changed, and it is almost as
different as an Australian one from the jolly roystering Christmas of former times.
To be sure, the shops are still gay, the streets are full, all the journeymen of all the
tailors are put in requisition, the hatter brushes up his hats, the milliner beguiles
young ladies o.ut of their coin for the winter colours of the Modes du mois , and
the furrier?s shop has in it a world of comfort. There is sometimes still an odour
haunting the corners of streets where women sell baked apples, and piemen
loiter with their hot temptations. Spiced gingerbread is still vauntingly pro-
claimed, and managers of theatres and pastrycooks are in all their glory.
Pantomimes and cakes abound, and one gaudy night succeeds another, till we
almost grow tired of feasting, and late .hours, and the company of children.
Business is but a name, and drollery is the order of the day. Tragedy rears her
gorgeous head, jewelled and crowned, and ? with sceptred pall comes sweeping
by.? Harlequin, too, is welcomed still?that glittering mystery, a thing
between fairydom and humanity. Culumbine is admired, and Pantaloon
applauded; both, it would seem, born for nothing but to dance and smile
for the pleasure of enraptured thousands. The play-bills still flaunt about,
disclosing the secrets of the coming night, and they are as mysteriously mag-
nificent as ever in the announcement of wood demons, horsemen and vaulters,
brazen shields and facial masks, fire-eaters, jugglers, and quadrupeds of every
variety and shape. Except the climatic difference, much that can be said of the
modern English Christinas applies to the Australian festival. Everyone is bent
upon holiday-making, good cheer is abundant, and the spirit of pantomime
reigns supreme Long may it continue to be so, and may the recurrence of the
season have a benign influence upon our minds, and by keeping in remembrance
the grand old story of Peace on earth, good-will towards men, so arouse our
better feelings, and enable us to forget the trials and annoyances of the past,
and begin a New Year with refreshed energy and determination.


LITTLE KATIE?S CHRISTMAS.
Bv Donald Cameron, M.L. A.
(Author of Scripopolis, &c.)
O that our childish dreams would last
And never fade away.
And that the glamour which they cast
Would with us ever stay.
Lord ! how the Australian sun beat
down mercilessly upon the begrimed and
dusty world that terrible Christmas Day;
how the bush sweltered until even the
gum-trees blistered and withered. As
for grass, there was none, and so the
sun shone upon a red expanse of earth,
adding to the heat. Even the lizards,
which are supposed to stand any quantity
of heat, were glad to crawl under logs and
stones ; and the snakes coiled themselves
up in withered tufts, and forgot to bite.
The mosquitoes themselves lost their
bloodthirstiness and were glad to seek
some cool, underground spot, where they
ruminated upon the probabilities of the
night, when they would have a good drink
from some ? fountain filled with blood ?
from the veins of some distracted human
being. There was little wind stirring;
when a blast occasionally came it seemed
as if from an oven where a Cyclops was
baking his bread ?and a warm oven it
must be. Such was Christmas Day, 1876,
at Boggy Creek, in one of the outlandish
districts of Victoria.
Boggy Creek had once been a great
mining place. In the days long past,
thousands of miners had peopled its de-
serted banks, and the stir and bustle of
human life were there in all the glory
and excitement of mining times. But the
alluvial had soon given out, and the
miners had gone elsewhere. The fast-
growing underwood of Australia had soon
covered the places where mining camps
had been, and, save for the innumerable
shallow shafts, mostly caved in, which
dotted the banks here and there, few
would be able to tell that in 1854 this
had been one of the busiest places in
Victoria ?that here Ashton?s and Burton?s
circuses had played with their bands and
prospered?that G-. V. Brooke himself had
paid a visit?and that the ? wood-notes
wild ? of Catherine Hayes had been
heard in a great canvas tent which was
called the ?Theatre Boyal.? True it
was, indeed, that ? Decay?s effacing
fingers ? had worked havoc on Boggy
Creek.
And yet it was a wonderfully pic-
turesque spot, even under the arid sun
of December : the more picturesque that
a civilised past mingled with a barbarian
present. It reminded one of some of
those places where travellers can now
find traces of great cities which existed
three or four thousand years ago, whose
people and history is unknown, and whose
inhabitants are wild, ignorant creatures,
as unable to comprehend the past as they
are to ascribe those great monuments to
anything except the work of demons and
Dyhins. The similarity was the greater
as Boggy Creek was not yet deserted: a
few stragglers still lived there. The
flocks of the neighbouring squatter, who
from a poor man had become wealthy
through the diggings, still fed on the
spots whence they had been driven in
those days, unmolested even by the few
? butters ?? who vegetated on Boggy Creek,
earning a few shillings a week in working
ground that had been turned over and over
again, dreaming that one day they would
fall across a deposit of washdirt or a reef
which would make them rich beyond the
dreams of avarice! Dreams, indeed !
Their possessions in this world would be
limited to six feet by six on some of the
dreary, gravelly hill-sides.
One of these butters was named Henry
Fisher by his parents, but the nomen-
clature of the Creek called him Fossicking
Harry, because since the days of 1854 he
had never followed mining strictly, but
had always been a restless being, who
could not stick to one claim for any
length of time. Even then, when he was
comparatively a young man, he would
wander over the hills and through the


gullies in search of a ? bonanza,? as the
Americans call it. Harry bad never
found this bonanza. Perhaps the only
slice of luck which haddallen to his share
was that, when he was becoming a mere
loafer, a kind little creature, who was a
servant at the principal hotel, fell in love
with this wild-looking, but still hand-
some, man, and married him, bringing
more wealth to their little cabin than
Harry ever possessed since he came to
the colony. For a time Harry tried to
be steady to please the ? wee wifey,? for
she was a very wee thing indeed, not five
feet high, while Harry was six feet two,
but his nomadic habits soon prevailed,
and he was soon on the tramp again.
Not even the birth, in after years, of a
little creature, the counterpart of her
mother ?as sweet, as fair, as blue-eyed ?
kept Harry at home. I am afraid he
was a very bad kind of a hero. I fear
he spent the few shillings he picked up
in out-of-the-way gullies at the only
shanty there was to be found at Boggy
Creek. But, Lord! what will not
woman?s love forgive ? To the day of her
death Mary believed in and loved her
husband. It was only two years ago on
such a hot, merciless day as this, that
Mary Fisher laid down her cross, and,
pressing her husband s hand, his last
kiss on her lips, her wee Katie pressed to
her heart, passed away into the unknown
land. Hers had not appeared to be a
happy life, but God in his infinite mercy
tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, and
the delicious love which bad existed be-
tween the husband and wife had been
the silver lining to the dark cloud of
existence.
So these two helpless creatures, the
father?most helpless and childlike of
the two?and little Katie, were left alone
But for little Katie, Harry Fisher would
have gone mad. But a new life was in-
fused into him by the desire to do some-
thing for his daughter. Only it would
have been better if he had chosen to do
something for her in another way. It
would have been wiser not to leave the
poor little girl alone, while searching for
big nuggets in the gullies and rich reefs
in the mountains, neither of which were
ever found. It may well be imagined
that the poor little tiling had a terribly
lonesome time of it when ? daddy was
away. _
But she was a wise little child, and
more like an old woman than a little girl.
She had evidently been taught to rely on
herself, her father being so often away,
her mother so busy. And so, although
she was only eleven years old, Katie was
more worldly wise and careful than her
father, whose auburn hair was becoming
grey in patches. The little elf took up
all the household duties, and strove in
every way to make her father comfort-
able. She never murmured at the hard
fare, the occasional privations; and she
made her father a better man. He never
spent his few shillings now at the shanty;
he gave them to Katie, who spent them
in necessaries. Then she cultivated her
little garden so well that it supplied many
a needed dish.
Although Katie had never gone to her
school, her mother, who was fairly edu-
cated, taught her daughter all she knew,
and after Mary?s death Harry took up
the task. His happy hours were spent
in teaching the witty child the higher
branches of education, for Harry had
evidently been a gentleman, and was a
great scholar. It would indeed seem
ridiculous to hear an old man in the bush
teaching his daughter French and Latin,
and even a little of Greek, but Harry
used to say that there was no telling
what might happen. He might discover
a ? pot ? one day, or come into the inheri-
tance of which he had been unjustly
defrauded, in consequence of which he
had become a human waif.
But disease had at last seized upon the
once strong form of Harry Fisher and,
after a prolonged absence in the moun-
tains during rainy weather, he returned
in a fever. And now on this hot Christ-
mas Day he lay in a narrow bunk tossing
about in a delirium, in a stifling atmos-
phere, while his dutiful daughter strove,
between her sobs and tears, to cool his
fevered brow. Anon she would marvel
what to do, for the only money they had
in the world was one shilling Ihe hos-
pital was ever so many miles away, and
how could she get him there? Poor little
Katie ! she was in sore trouble indeed,
and she could think of no way except by
kneeling occasionally and praying in her
simple childish faith to the great T ather
who loves us all.
The day wore on, and the heat grew
fiercer and fiercer, and the delirium ot
the patient became greater. What a
Christmas Day for a child to spend, with


hardly any food, with a sick parent and
horrible fear of coming death and starva-
tion. She could not even go for help
lest her father should start up and go
into the bush. He alternately raved
about his relatives in England, the word
? Father? often occurring, and then he
would speak of the certainty of a great
golden vein running through Rising Sun
Hill, or a rich deposit of washdirt being
down in the Onti Gully. He would start
up at times, and it took all his daughter?s
little loving ways to keep him on his
pallet; and she knew that when the
delirium would increase, when he would
not be able to recognise her, her efforts
would be of no avail. It was an awful
moment.
Gradually, as the day wore on, the heat
overpowered Harry, and he fell into an
uneasy slumber. Katie looked at him
in tears, and wondered whether this
would last until she could go to Big
Ben?s hut, two miles away. She won-
dered Ben had not come to see them,
but when she reflected that Ben was
spending the day no doubt at Mother
Quinlan?s shanty, quaffing colonial ale,
the wonder ceased. But his son, Jerry,
surely ought to have come ; he ran once
that way when he had a birthday. Jerry
was a little older than Katie, and he was
the only companion of her own time of
life she had ever had. He was such a
kind, good little fellow, and made her
presents of wild ducks whenever he shot
any, which often eked out the larder.
As the girl thought, the overpower-
ing heat of the day worked, and soon
the golden head sank down upon the
sufferer?s pillow, and the little soul wan-
dered away into the realms of dreams,
happy as the visions of the miserable
always are, thank God !
She thought that the ruined hut van-
ished from her gaze, and that in its place
arose a fairy palace, such as she had read
of in books, surrounded with green-
leaved trees on which hung golden fruit,
and running streams of the clearest
coldest water. Birds sang, music sounded,
and the sky was of the deepest blue,
edged with amber. Oh ! what a glorious
change, compared with the desecrated
landscape she had left. Many beautiful
creatures of the loveliest forms, and with
golden wings, fluttered about, welcoming
her to the home of happiness. They
brought her to a bower where everything
was deliciously cool, and there treated
her to a thousand luxuries, many oi
which she had never seen, but all s(
sweet and toothsome. She thought tha !
to live here was to be happy for ever
It seemed to her that for clays and dayi
she lived there without a change ; th<
same light, the same music, the sam<
pleasures, yet never palling upon hei
senses.
One day a glorious being, who eclipsed
all the others, appeared, and, taking the
child by the hand, he asked her if she
was happy.
? Perfectly happy,? she replied; and
yet as she said so she felt as if there was
a great void, as if something was wan!
ing, even in that brilliant place.
? Is there none of your desires ungra-
tified ?? asked the Intelligence.
?Hone,? she said, but more doubt-
ingly-
? Do you know the name of this coun-
try P? he asked.
? Ho.?
? Then, child, leave it. The name ii
Selfishness. Here, no one thinks but o:
themselves ; hence those qualities knowi
elsewhere as love, self-denial, and dutj
have no existence.?
Something was struggling in her
breast; she began to feel that she was
not doing right. Suddenly a light shot
into her mind. Her father, Jerry, the
world, she had left. She burst into bit-
ter tears. In her own happiness she had
forgotten the poor creature she had left
on a sick-bed. O, how could she be so
cruel ? And, strange as it was, the bril-
liance of the palace seemed to fade, the
trees to lose colour, the gay inhabitants j
to darken and grow ugly.
?My father,? she cried. ? I wish he
were here ; I love him, I love him ?
There was a great noise as if the
heavens had burst, and on looking around
she was terrified to see that the whole
beautiful scene had vanished ; the trees
became stunted ?their fruit poisonous
berries, the fairies changed into hideous
newts and efts, and the grand palace into
a mean hovel. The only one who did
not alter was the Being who had spoken
to her ; he seemed to grow more glorious
than ever.
? Child,? said he ; ? you have become
a human being once more; you have
obeyed the call of love and. duty, and they
will be your reward. Let the lesson be


engraven upon your mind throughout
your life. Awake ! Farewell.?
Katie awoke and rubbed her eyes.
The beams of the evening sun fell upon
the bed, and at the door stood Jerry, in
company with two strangers, in one of
whom she recognised the kind doctor who
had attended her mother in her last ill-
hgss.
?Katie, Katie!? cried Jerry. ?Here?s
two gentlemen (Jerry never troubled
about grammar) who bring good news,
such news.?
? Hush, boy,? said the doctor, coming
forward. ? Katie, child, he is right. Is
your father asleep??
?Ha!? cried Harry, rising on his
elbow. ? Are you there, Dr. Good P Take
care of my child when I am gone. I
? Nonsense,? cried the doctor, taking
the patient?s hand. ?There?s lots of
life in you yet, Mr. Fisher. You only
want attention and some nourishing food.
Do you see this gentleman??
The stranger who had hithertofore
kept in the background came forward.
? John!? cried the patient. ? John?
No, no. I am dreaming. I am going
mad.?
? Not at all,? said the visitor, catching
the warm hand. ?I am John, your
brother John, who has found you after
after months of search. Your father
was resolved to see you ere he died, and
I was sent to find you. All is forgiven
and forgotten, except that you are my
brother, his son.?
?Oh God!? cried Harry, ?And I
thought thou had?st forgotten me.?
And the strong man burst into tears,
which perhaps did him more good than
any medicine. M
? And this is my little niece, said
John, catching the thin little form in his
arms, and kissing Kate. ? There, child,
you need never fear want again. I see
it in your face.? > .
? But, oh uncle !? said Katie, ? I will
always love my father and do my duty.
And we hope all children will make
the same resolve.
THE JARVIAD.
Garnet Walch.
He sits enthroned in lofty state,
A king amongst his kind !
A world to conquer lies before,
A conquered world behind.
With brow serene and smiling lips
His chariot wheels he guides,
And all within is calm and peace,
Though he has twelve insides.
Drive on, proud monarch, to the Mews,
Thy tribute coin deliver,
And I will mount thy steps and sit
At thy left hand for ever.
What feasts the poet?s vision paints,
As, throned by thee, he rides
-Gargantuan banquets all for thee,
Thee and thy twelve insides !
What happy hoards of wondrous wealth,
What latent stores of bliss ;
The camel?s inner joys are nought
To such reserves as this !
Had?st thou been born in toga-days,
Of Calends and of Ides, _
Lucullus would have pawned his boots'''
To own thy twelve insides.
What; sirrah ! heedest not my lay,
Or heed?st it but to scoff?
Thouhintest I?ve been ?getting on??
Behold me getting off!
And as, on reaching ground, I view
Thy visage, which derides,
I cry, ? Aha ! may fiendish pains
Rack all thy twelve insides ! ?

BURIED ALIVE,
Josh. Pickersgill.
Cubing the summer of 1865, some of
my readers may probably remember with
what terrible fatality the month of March
ended, the fell diseases colonial fever and
dysentery slaying the young, the middle
aged and the old colonist with terrible
unerring aim. With others, careless of
diet or sickening heat, I had vainly
endeavored to ward off repeated attacks
of the prevalent fever, lingering on in the
hope of a trip across the straits, or to the
more seductive station on the Murray
plains ; plying, like Hamlet?s father, an
afternoon?s custom, mine being the
homely shandygaff, or the more popu-
lar Ho. 2 Moselle with its soda adjunct,
of course medicinally.
It requires no strong mental effort to
guess the end of the then popular delu-
sion of defying medical aid, for the more
entrancing mundane stimulants mentioned
above. Enough to know that I settled
down within seven days to the common
custom of being found in bed in high
fever, with a medico on one side and a
small host of sympathisers on the other.
Those to whom the fever colonial is a
stranger can little reck of the parched
throat, the swollen tongue, the sickening
nausea, and singular nerve depression
awaiting, turn and turn alike, upon every
stage of this essentially and purely Aus-
tralian malady.
I have in my time suffered as a watcher
over many a death-bed scene, and the
reader will bear me out in the assertion
that the most trying and touching situa-
tions, to which all humans are liable to of
this saddening nature, are to be met
with when the vital spark is flickering
out slowly to an intense consciousness
lingering to the last with the resigned
sufferer. With the knowledge of expir-
ing hope, imparted in sorrowful kindness
from medical or non-scientific attendant,
and vividly apparent in the tearful glances
of relatives or tried comrades around
one?s death-bed, I found a lullaby sym-
pathy whose effect seemed weird-like to
console and soothe me. Tbe whisperings
of tired watchers in the passages leading
to the sick chamber, the ominous ceasing
of stimulants, the double relays of higher
pillows, and the efforts of changers of
watches to steal silently at the closing of
the wearied eyelids from the bed side,
were to me significant enough of the
? finale.? Three friends, old chums o?er
many a festive wassail, sat near as the last
hour approached, and their sighs, attuned
in sorrow, seemed to rise and fall in unison
as they bent their sympathising looks
through the dim lamplight which fell
athwart my couch. And to me it seemed,
as the light slowly and soothingly faded,
a cheering touch which Jack Gibson?s
hand yielded in mine as blank darkness
closed in on me, and a strange sense of
exquisite repose stole over my soul, to
which for days and nights my aching and
reduced frame had been a stranger ?I
had crossed over the stream where suf-
fering made way for exquisite rest ?the
stillness of my chamber, the lingering
cadences of departing voices, the deep-
drawn sigh and the awful stillness ?a
wave of falling darkness descended in
slow wreathings, and I slept, but only
the wild strange sleep of a deep, deadly
trance.
Trance mediums were uncommon in
those days, and, in fact, are rare enough
to-day, although in the years which have
intervened since my death I have never
lost an opportunity, as it offered, of com-
paring notes with one, like myself, who
had slept through a trance, and suffered;
and I have invariably found a singular
similarity in our compared experiences.
In my own case I well remember the
long, long sleep of that marvellous repose
which followed my apparent demise.
The first sensations I experienced were
of being tied down, and a strong desire to
speak, although knowing well at the time
that I could not move my tongue. I did
not seem to feel disappointment, although
I suffered a strange inward dread of noise.


I seemed to wake from my sleep with
the full knowledge that I was in a trance,
and that if I kept quiet my faculties
would be restored, sooner or later, through
the refreshing repose I had enjoyed.
I could trace most vividly every footstep,
and knew its owner; I could distinctly
understand every word spoken, knowing
right well each familiar voice; and the
distress which a sincere sob from an old
servant near the bed created within me
seemed more than my inflamed, unutter-
able thoughts could endure. The greatest
anxiety I felt rested in my desire to look
' around me; if I could only see one friend?s
face, and by so doing ensure his attention
to me, I felt that the trance would pass
away and that something would be done
to save me.
Musing on this increasing misery, and
reflecting upon the extraordinary sensa-
tions which were crowding through my
brain, I suddenly felt a hand pat my
cheek, and I thought surely I must have
started. The pat was continued, and, to
my horror and dismay, I recognized
the voice of G-us Sleight, the Collins
street dispenser of mourning coaches
and hearses.
? Poor Bob,? said the now familiar
undertaker, ? many a worse fellow have
I screwed up.?
?Yes,? answered Harry Bowler, ? with
all his faults ?and he had lots?there?s
many a worse man living.?
After recovering from Sleight?s famili-
arity with his hand, I thought,?? True,
Harry Bowler, true ; I had many faults ;
perhaps one of my worst being fool
enough to endorse your bills oft enough.?
rX Sleight, without wishing, I imagined, to
tickle me, felt me across and lengthways,
and pinched my nose. Why this was
done I never knew, and have often won-
dered whether all stiff noses are pinched
by the cheerless undertaker.
It seemed to me strange that for weeks
I thought I lay listening for some familiar
voice, and listening in vain. After all, I
had been left alone for only one night.
Yet, the terrible stillness of that room
thrilled me with horror, on thinking over
this memorable career in my death for
years afterwards. I had as yet barely
contemplated for a moment my fearful
position ; yet it suddenly dawned across
my fevered brain that there was an un-
usual stir of feet approaching my room ;
strange voices, too ?one singularly harsh-
toned, after the soft whisperings I had
been accustomed to for a fortnight.
? Catch a hold, Jim,? said the raven-
throated though fashionable mute, and I
knew instantly my situation was becom-
ing critical, for I was bumped, twisted,
and banged down into my coffin with
about as much ceremony as packing a
ham in sawdust.
? S?elp me never !? answered his mate ;
? blowed if the covey aint looking better
than when I seed him afore. They alius
does, Jim, coves like him as was fond on
a drop.?
? Was he, Bill ??
?So I heerd, Jim, from some of the
swells below.?
? When do we fetch the bloke ??
? Well, a rummy time ?late this after-
noon,? answered the dulcet-toned first
villain; and they walked off.
? Looks like old times,? said my friend
Harry Bowler, removing a soft handker-
chief which my landlady had placed
across my face.
? Yes,? answered a gay dog, jolly, irre-
pressible, and effervescent ?one Hick
Ellis ??poor old devil, he?s out of one
hot wind, unless he?s struck a worse.?
?What d?ye say?? said Bowler ; ?do we
put off the cards to-night? I?m out a
hundred yet.?
? Put off, be hanged !? answered Ellis.
? Old Bob would be just about in his best
form?wouldn?t you, old un? (slapping
my cheek) ?? if he could roll in, and take
a hand this hot night.?
? Yes,? replied Bowler, ? he owes me a
pony from the last go in.?
? That?s as big a lie, Bowler? (I yearned
to exclaim), ? as ever you told, seeing that
in my pocket-book, hanging over yonder
in the old grey coat, I?ve kept your
1.0.U.?s for overthree years, side by side
with your N.S.F. cheques.? But, being
unable to retort upon my cheerful chum?s
assertion, I just lay, and swore inwardly
that, if ever I got a show out of this
coffin, Master Bowler would have cause
for serious reflections given him.
After a few uncomplimentary remarks
from my sporting friends, as to my gene-
ral luck, though rolled over at last, et
cetera, they left me, Bowler remarking, as
a parting salute, ? We won?t screw him
up till the last minute; some of the boys


would very likely want to see his old mug
again.?
This was kind of Bowler, I thought,
anyhow; and I ignored his dishonoured
paper, becoming terribly anxious about
the last rites which awaited me within
seven hours.
I will not intrude the wretchedness of
that day upon my reader, but lightly scan
the leading events up to the cemetery.
They behaved nobly, my fellow-lodgers.
They sat around, during that long after-
noon, dividing my clothes and ornamental
memorandums. Bowler seemed contented
with the pocket-book. He had noticed
in one of the flap pockets, not one but
several acceptances determinedly over-
due, upon whose faces the familiar name
of Bowler appeared in undeniable charac-
ters. His clear eye had undoubtedly
fallen upon these mystic words, ? liefer
to drawer,? and Bob referred the bills
instantaneously to the acceptor?s pocket
?the pocket of Kobert Bowler. Dick
Ellis saw considerable satisfaction in the
residue of my estate lying around. He
felt that the curator of intestate estates
might be too busy to attend to my demise,
and he kindly made a home for the effects
of his deceased friend, without the inter-
ference of a Government official; and
thus the day wore on.
With that punctuality which is pain-
fully apparent in the minds and manners
of executioners, Mr. Sleight drove up. in
all the cold-blooded, and to him beautiful,
panoply of his office, his classic brow
slightly pursed with as much grief as he
could afford for a one-coach show ; and
the small gathering received his ministra-
tions in befitting silence ?a silence broken
only by the deep-drawn sighs from the
old servant alluded to in the early history
of my death, whose sincerity, clad in
borrowed black, seemed soothing to me
in the stillness of this never-to-be-forgot-
ten afternoon.
Sleight had evidently been remarkably
pushed for time all day. He consolingly
told my chief mourners what a busy
season he was fretting over, and that he
must make haste, having three more suc-
cesses on for that afternoon. I could
hear the quiet grunt of contentment
escape his lips as he ??finished off,? as
he called it, my little job ; and with his
words, which seemed to sound my last
knell of hope, ?Yes, Mr. Bowler, I saw
his old uncle, and he goes into their family
vault,? I fell into a deep, long, dreamy
sleep, winch ended in some most singular
surprises ere daylight next morning.
When reason again returned, a most
agonizing feeling of bitter consciousness,
mingled with fear, coursed through my
brain. Everything that had passed
flitted rapidly through my mind, and I
knew almost instantaneously my position.
With an effort which nearly strangled
me, I turned on my side, and unloosed
my arms. Placing my head against the
lid, and the palms of both hands against
the sides of my coffin, I brought super- �
human strength to my aid, and, as quick
almost as the effort was made, the lid
flew off, and one side of my gingerly deal
board mansion cracked, with a noise whose
echo froze my very soul with fear. I sat
up, but could not feel what I fain dreaded
to touch ?walls. I crept out of my lightly
strung-up tecement, and crawled along
the damp floor, passing two cold, clammy
coffins in my ramblings. Then, reaching
a corner of the vault, I came upon loose
earth, positively warm to the touch.
Looking upwards, I distinctly saw pale \
moonlight through a small opening, and <
I stood up, slowly standing nearly upright. !
Sleight, being uncommonly busy, backed
up as he was by many of the leading
physicians, and a malignant, pestiferous
fever, had banked up the entrance to my
vault with loose shingles, intending, when
his day?s successful and grim pleasures
were over, to attend to my humble require-
ments early next day, and finish me off
neatly?a fact which he tells with unctu-
ous glee to this day ; and in less time
than I have consumed in writing this half
sheet, I stood outside the vault, free
faint, with a thankful, heart-felt prayer *-
on my lips, at my terrible escape from
lingering agonies. In screwing me hur-
riedly up, my ever dear friend failed to
notice that a thick screw had become
embedded in the edge of my coffin, leav-
ing me absolutely a quarter of an inch
aperture at the head end of Sleight?s
handiwork ; and, no doubt, that tiny yet
important opening saved my life. In
those days few men took the trouble,
when dead, to observe trifles of this kind
about their coffins ; yet I would always
recommend, after my experiences in that
line, the tenant to see that the Sleights
of to-day close up their contracts neatly,
although I am told my friend finishes


now-a-days with, excellent compactness,
brought about by virtue of great compe-
tition in his profession.
It vas an extraordinary adventure for
one night, and it ended strangely. The
moon, nearly at full, shone out with sum-
mer brilliancy; the night reposed in a
warm air, not a sound disturbed the
melancholy stillness of that sacred spot,
until a clock-bell began its solemn striking
Carlton-wards. I listened, but heard only
two beats; then the terrifying silence
reigned gloomily around again. I felt
instinctively I had missed one or two
beats ; that, if I had missed two, it must
be four o?clock ; or, upon closer reflection,
I thought, could I have lost the early
striking, and that the hour must be about
midnight. Being at the end of summer,
I thought four o?clock a.m. would bring
flickerings of light in the east; and I
might have gone on wondering indefinitely
had not a slow footstep?singularly loud
as it seemed in its effect upon me ?dis-
turbed and alarmed me. I ducked behind
the ornamental railing of my temporary
lodgings, keeping my eye upon the shining
form approaching. I rubbed both eyes
anew, and trembled at the flashing figure,
whose very head seemed to blaze, and I
shivered as I crouched. On it came, with
step slow and majestic. It developed, at
ten yards distance, into a six-foot police-
man?a reflective, solemn-visaged, oil-
skinned, shiny-crowned bobby, upon whose
waterproofs the moonlight danced in
ghastly illuminations. My old larrikin,
worldly ways came back upon me intui-
tively, and I thought,?? Bobby, my dar-
ling, I?ll give you one fright in return,
which will straighten our accounts, and
yield to your contemplative mind matter
for discussion in your barracks to-mor-
row, dear Bobert.? He was comfortably
abreast my hiding-place, as, gathering up
my winding-sheet, I rose steadily, and,
stretching slowly my arms to their full
length, with averted face I waited the
issue. I shall never know how A224?s
features bore the trial; but this much I
do know : the dignified sentiments of
? Move on, now,? were exchanged for one
of the most unearthly yells conceivable ;
a voice, pitched wondrously high, ex-
claimed. ?Holy Mother!? with sundry
hurried" expressions in honest Irish ac-
cents ; and I don?t think the wildest hood-
lum could have lived in the paces which
overcame the bobby. In the distance I
could hear the iron gate bang to in the
most determined manner; and if that
bobby be still outside that old cemetery
?and I hope he may be, to read these
lines?the hurried causes of his matutinal
race with a ghost will now dawn upon
him.
Suddenly from out ?St. Mungo?s tower
three o?clock pealed; and, elated with
life, liberty, and the most exhilirating
sight of a lifetime, I determined upon an
extraordinary event ere daylight once
again broke upon my disturbed functions.
I made up my mind to scale the cemetery
wall, make down the University garden,
and disturb the card-party of my particu-
lar friends, Bowler and Co., knowing that
they were certain to play late through
the hot-wind night. Folding my winding-
sheet closer, I gingerly traced my foot-
steps o?er the gravel crossings, climbed
the old wooden fence which in those days
pioneered the present handsome iron rail-
ing, and, keeping the University walls
close to my right, I reached my previous
earthly lodgings, coursed by about thirty
of the most vulgar specimens of the
canine race ?dogs of all sizes and varie-
ties of yell. In our right-of-way I was
delighted to observe the light from our
lodgings. It played upon the dry gutters
from the little back sitting-room, and I
undid the gate-latch, and took a rest on
the wood-pile ?an effort which seemed
necessary after the extraordinary exploits
of the past few hours. I could hear
Harry Bowler cursing somebody s luck
in tones which undoubtedly betrayed, not
only a bad run, but considerable tumbler-
lifting. Harry was drunk. Frank Gib-
son ?as decent a fellow as ever cut a deal
?had evidently landed, not only Bowler,
but Dick Ellis, the same homely Ellis
upon whose person it would not have sur-
prised me to have observed my Sunday
clothes, _ .
I laid my plans immediately, seeing that
in the eastern sky the grey blue of daylight
seemed spreading; already the cocks were
vigorously using their lungs in loud defi-
ance at one another all round, and sundry
sniffing noses under the old fence proved
that my canine accompanyists had run me
in to their evident satisfaction. I ob-
served with particular fiendish delight that
Harry Bowler?s back rested against the
passage wall, and facing the door which
very soon would swing to the turn of a
living-dead man. Dick Ellis faced Bow-


ler ; the rest sat round, smoking like
chimnies in a high wind; and the pale,
curling mist of tobacco-smoke which
over-hung the table and furniture like a
shadowy pall suited the denouement glori-
ously. With a little music from the
Corsican Brothers given in, there was a
fortune in this tableaux, if the principal
performers could have been brought on
at some decent theatre nightly. Taking
a loose turn of my winding-sheet across
my bare arms left a considerable portion
of my legs exposed; but I knew right
well that the face would be the peculiar
attraction when I entered, which I did,
still as death, advancing just sufficiently
to throw the one kerosene light, swing-
ing over the table, full upon my face.
Bowler was in the act of passing over an
I. O. U., when he met my steady, solemn
look, earnestly and coldly scanning him.
His hand stayed its course, grasping
between thumb and finger the little white
memorandum of his indebtedness to the
pool, and dropped upon the table. For
a second he shaded his eyes with his dis-
engaged right hand, a guttural sound
escaped his lips, and, as he pointed to-
wards my figure, his head went back, and
Harry Bowler had swooned. Dick Ellis
seized Bowler by the shoulder, and shook
him. Then it suddenly struck Ellis?
Why did Bowler point towards the door ?
With a rapid movement Ellis stood up,
leaving Bowler?s head swinging over the
side of the chair, and he looked carefully
at me, bravely and coolly. He then pulled
Frank G-ibson?s arm, and silently pointed
towards me. Gribson turned ghastly pale
in a few seconds, and the rest of the gamb-
lers stood to their chairs. I saw at a
glance I had gone far enough. Drawing
back a few paces, I tried to speak, and
with difficulty succeeded, seeing that I
had been nearly sixty hours tongue-tied,
accosting Ellis jocosely with, ?Don?t give
way, Dick ; I?m all right; I?m not dead,
old fellow. Must have been a trance !?
And I remember a dismal mist, dark and
thick, coming between us; but nothing
more.
Dick Ellis told me afterwards that, as
I mentioned the word trance, I fell for-
ward, being caught by the two strangers.
I slept for twenty-six hours, wandering,
now raving, now imploring, in my sleep,
as my male attendants told me ?through
church-yard adventures, grim vaults, and
smothering enemies.
Poor Harry Bowler, through much
tribulation and neat brandy, came back
to reason just as the milkman pushed the
can on the back window-sill; and as I
slept on that eventful morning the re-
newed repose of my earthly connection
anew, the boys sat on the chairs around,
and in whisky and milk drank in silence,
accompanied with befitting glances, to the
strange reappearance of their chum, whose
adventures were then not known to them,
but whose welcome presence, although
asleep in their midst, filled them with
weird wonders and delights.
SINGULAR ADVENTURES OF MEDIUM SMITH
IN CONNECTION WITH A PHANTOM COACH AND HORSES.
Thomas Harrison,
Persons travelling from the Spencer
street to the Wodonga terminus will
have noticed how completely the North-
Eastern road has been put into the shade
by the North-Eastern line. For some-
times a score of miles at a stretch, the
two run nearly parallel with each other,
so that the ruin of this erst important
thoroughfare is rendered apparent to
every passenger. Loneliness now reigns
where busy traffic once ruled supreme.
The tolerably well macadamised high-
way no longer echoes with the footfall
of passing steeds and rolling wheels.
? Ichabod ? is written upon the gateways
of many hostelries, for their glory is de-
parted. In some few instances these
mementos of bye-gone activity still linger
out, serving as the seldom-visited houses
of call for benighted cattle-drovers or
wearied swagsmen; but in the majority
of cases closed doors, or a changed mode
of life, tell silently of the days that are
gone and of liveliness that has passed


away. The Coachmen?s Arms, on the
Melbourne side of Wangaratta, stands
as a monument of decayed fortune in a
manner somewhat peculiar. The doors
of the house are firmly closed, and deso-
lation is everywhere apparent in the once
busy stable-yards thereto attached. In
the latter, however, is to be seen one
remnant of the things that were, to wit,
a half-rotten four-horse coach, twenty
years ago the pride of Cobb?s array of
vehicles, the admired of all admirers
when on an afternoon it left the Albion,
in Bourke street, bound for Albury and
the border townships.
There is a mystery about this coach;
that is, with respect to its latter days, not
its origin. Ordinarily the vehicle stands
in its place silently enough, but once a
year, as is reported b} r at least a dozen
residents of the adjacent township, the
s'ame decayed conveyance is to be seen
glittering with new paint, brass, and gild-
ing of a supernatural lustre, drawn by
four fiery steeds, a Yankee driver on the
box, and three blazing lamps, pursuing a
wild and headlong career along the ad-
jacent road until vanishing finally among
the neighbouring gum trees. The ? Hi!
hi! ? and crack of the coachman?s whip
are said to be heard, but the spectral
group is accompanied by no other sound.
It is considered an ill omen to witness the
spectacle, and the great majority of those
who have seen the strange phenomenon
over night are found troubled with a
splitting headache the next day, or betray
often enough such a general tremor of
the frame that more than one adept has
remarked the result shows either that
something terrible has been seen by the
witness, or else that such witness is, by
evident mental aberration, totally un-
worthy of credence.
The fact that all the appearances quoted
had been witnessed on the night of a
festive day (Christmas Eve or Christmas
Night being the general time of the
phantom coach having been met with)
not unnaturally awakens suspicion. The
entire neighbourhood lived in hope of
the mystery being cleared up by the
calm, temperate, and philosophical inves-
tigations of Mr. Medium Smith. The
gentleman in question had given himself
vfp to careful researches into spiritualistic
matters. He was eu rapport with Kattie
King and a whole host of that celebrated
ilk. A table under his particular me-
diumship (the profane said hy the influ-
ence of the particular action of his knees)
would nod and rap out spiritualistic
communications without number. The
umbrella of this gentleman was as ortho-
dox as that of Mr. Stiggins, and Maw-
worm himself was not more rigidly sanc-
tified as to the nasal organ. The strong
point of Mr. Smith, however, was that he
specially eschewed strong drinks. Cold
tea, or more generally toast and water,
were his favourite beverages. These he
carried in a well-flattened pocket-pistol,
as though to convey a lesson of temper-
ance and self-denial through the medium-
ship of an article generally appropriated
to tippling habits.
It was on a Christmas Eve that Mr.
Smith set out upon his investigations.
His vigil was, of course, to be carried on
independently of stimulants and with no
companionship save the investigator?s own
thoughts and the well-known umbrella,
his constant companion upon other occa-
sions.
It is, perhaps, needless to say that the
watcher found his self-imposed duties
somewhat wearisome. His first step was
to investigate the veritable locality of the
coach itself. Having refreshed himself
with an extra long draught of the favorite
beverage in his pocket-pistol, he then
started on his wanderings about the road
said to be haunted by this strange ap-
pearance. We are not certain as to the
actual hours that elapsed, but quote Mr.
Smith?s own note-book as a record of the
fact.
It was nearly midnight, and nothing
strange presented itself. The small hours
arrived and the dawn evidently drew near,
when, instead of a general awakening of
nature, the watcher experienced a pretty
general drowsiness in his own frame, and
in the place of the aurora breaking over
the eastern hills he noticed that the road-
way close beside him was vividly illumi-
nated.
? Hi! hi!? cried a sharp, shrill voice, at
hearing which Mr. Smith turned round
suddenly to see himself very nearly run
over by a four-horse coach, the approach
of which, owing perhaps to his drowsi-
ness, he had not previously noticed.
? Why, you stagger like one half-seas
over,? said the voice, which proved to be
that of the driver of the coach.
?Like one dead beaten,? was the reply.
? Where are you going ? ?


? To the next township.?
? Then, as I have no passengers to-
night, jump up.?
Mr. Smith did not need a second bid-
ding, but scrambled up on the box.
? Why, man,? said the driver, ? you
are either drunk, or done for. Take a
drink;? and with that he offered a small
pocket pistol, the very counterpart of
the one carried by Mr. Smith himself.
The person to whom the offer was
made took hold of the bottle, raised it to
his nose, and drew back in horror.
? Rum !? said he. ? Abomination ! and
I am a Rechabite.?
? So am I,? ? said the person who had
proffered the gift.
? What, and drink spirits !?
? Nothing of the kind. What you see
there is the very latest invention of those
pledged to aid forward the good cause.
You know how weak the flesh is, and
how the mere taste craves after excite-
ment. The object of these drinks is to
tickle the palate, but not to intoxicate
the brain. See here : old tom, brandy,
milk punch, whiskey, egg nog, all of
the genuine flavour, but nothing inebri-
ating about them and, so saying, the
speaker presented Mr. Smith with as
many bottles, all like the preceding, and
all of which, it must be confessed, the
person addressed duly tasted and ap-
proved of.
The task of tasting had evidently so
engrossed the attention of the passenger
that he failed to notice how the convey-
ance had entirely left the beaten track,
and was dashing at headlong speed
through the neighbouring forest.
?What is tha black thing ahead?
said Smith, at last.
? Only the Buffalo Ranges, was the
reply. ?We are going through them;
and without more ado the team plunged
into the mountain on one side, and five
minutes later emerged from it on the
other. ? ,
? Good heaven! take care of that ra-
vine !? exclaimed the bewildered pas-
senger.
?No fear! Only a good leap. Sit
firm! We shall clear it.? And so they
did; a gully at least a thousand feet in
width, and twice that in depth, on the
slope of the Australian Alps.
A few moments more and the wide
Pacific was before them, but it mattered
but little for them now, as the coach
was leaving the earth fast, and pursuing
a journey through space.
? Mind yourself,? said the driver.
? That left horn of the moon is rather
sharp. Ran against it and knocked out my
left eye last Christmas.?
Mr. Smith looked round, and found
that the driver?s left optic was certainly
gone.
? That is Mars,? continued the former
speaker after a pause. ?We don?t stop
there this time. Never mind the planet.
I?ll take care to clear that, but look out
for the satellite ; it is rather a lively beg-
gar, so mind it don?t hit you on the
head.?
The caution was well-timed ; and the
person addressed turned, only just soon
enough to escape a rap on the cranium,
but not so quickly but that the heavenly
body in question knocked off his hat,
which afterwards went whirling round
the planet; and now goes to form the
second Martial satellite which astrono-
mers have only just discovered.*
The events were so startling that Mr.
Smith commenced to look about him.
He held fast to the seat, and there the
first thing that struck him was that the
fittings were rotten, and crumbled be-
neath the touch of his fingers.
?Where am I ?? said the poor fellow,
suddenly awakening to a sense of pro-
bable danger. ? This coach looks like
the old decayed one that I saw two hours
ago standing in the yard of the deserted
Coachman?s Arms.?
? Perhaps it is the same,? said the
driver. ? But where were the horses P?
Mr. Smith looked, and saw that the
four horses were in reality four wretched
skeletons.
?Mercy on us!? he exclaimed. ?What
is this P Who are you ??
The driver turned, and his companion
notice that his face was that of a skull,
and, for the first time, found out that
the lights he had previously taken for
those of the coach lamps really issued
from the empty eye sockets (not only
? With a view of substantiating Mr. Smith?s state-
ment we have made enquiries of the proper authorities.
Referring to this particular assertion we give the fol-
lowing:?
? I did not see the satellite of Mars myself, so cannot
say whether it resembles a hat or not. I may add, how-
ever, that a hat so knocked off, so propelled, and so

one but both eyes were gone) of tbe
strange being who sat beside him.
Mv. Smith would have jumped to the
ground, but there was no ground near,
so he simply fell off the box, and fell no
one knows how far, at least he confesses
that he did not.
The moon was just before the falling
man, and he tried hard to catch at her
crescent form, but missed his jump by at
least half an inch.
Destruction was evidently inevitable.
Already did the unfortunate investigator
see the lights of the earth, to all appear-
ance, rapidly approaching him, as he
neared the surface.
A few moments more and he would be
dashed to atoms.
A happy thought struck him. He
had his umbrella with him. To open
this was the work of an instant. It
acted as a parachute. He fastened the
hook to the waistband of his trousers,
and the full force of the fall was broken ;
but not altogether. The contact with
the earth, even with the speed so dimin-
ished, was quite sufficient to stun the
person so falling.
Strange to say, the revolution of the
globe on its axis had brought the very
yard of the Coachman?s Arms to a posi-
tion immediately coinciding with the
line of Mr. Smith?s rapid descent.^
Next morning he was found lying, or
rather sitting, close to the dilapidated
coach.
In his hand was a pocket pistol, but it
could never have been that of the owner,
but must have been rather one of those
furnished by the mysterious driver, since
it smelled strongly of ardent spirits,
which, as before stated, Mr. Smith never
touched.
The hero of the adventure persists in
saying that he has completely solved the
mystery, and that the reported appear-
ances are really due to the influence of
spirits.
The majority of persons in the town-
ship who have heard the story are fast
coming over to Mr. Smith?s opinion.
THE HIGHLANDS OF THE CITY.
William Black
The fairies and good people are all
gone away now, and even if any of them
were left, the neighbourhood of the Lon-
don Exchange is about the last place in
the world where one would naturally ex-
pect to find them. Nevertheless, a
worthy couple living in a lane not far
from the Mansion House were regularly
visited each New Year s Day by an old
gentleman who was quite as good as a
fairy, because he invariably left a sove-
reign behind him; and so implicitly did
they count on this visit that on each
recurring Christmas they indulged in a
few simple but unwonted luxuries, know-
ing that the old gentleman?s sovereign
would pay for these. Not being philoso-
phical persons they did not ask them-
selves why they ate better food on
Christmas Day than on any other day;
they 'were quite content to do as their
neighbours did. , .
The lane in which they lived had in
former days been a place of great com-
mercial repute ; but now it had relapsed
into dingy offices, restaurants, and billiard
rooms, the last much frequented about
mid-day by young gentlemen who were
supposed by their superiors or elder
partners to be at lunch. John Holloway
and his wife and two children occupied
the attic floor of one of the tall and
narrow buildings ; he was a salesman in
a boot and shoe shop in Gracechurch
street, and these rooms were at once
cheap and handy. Now one New Year?s
Day, just as he was finishing his mid-
day dinner, and preparing to return to
the shop, some one came up the
wooden staircase and knocked at the
door. His wife was looking after the
children; he himself answered the sum-
mons. He found before him a stout,
middle-sized, respectable looking old
gentleman, who, as he presently dis-
covered, spoke with a pronounced Scotch
accent. Perhaps it was scarcely the
accent that was so Scotch so much as the
grave, earnest manner of utterance which
is characteristic of old Scotch people;


for, as a matter of fact, the stranger fre-
quently, and apparently unconsciously,
used American colloquialisms. It was
the matter rather that the manner of his
speech which interested and even as-
tounded Holloway. The old gentleman
looked about him for a second or two in
absolute silence; then he said in a low,
deliberate way:
? You live here ? Ay, it is strange.
The place is little altered. That is the
outlet on to the roof, is it not ??
He looked at a square aperture above
his head, a sort of hatchway with a heavy
wooden covering.
? Well, yes, it is,? said Holloway, re-
garding the stranger with amazement.
The old Scotchman again stood silent
for a second or two, looking around him
in an absent way. Then he suddenly
seemed to recollect himself.
?My friend, I beg your pardon. lam
an old man ?-I forget sometimes. You
were saying that the place had not been
altered for years; has the roof been
altered ? Is the roof still the same ? Are
the ridges still there ? And the red tiles ??
Holloway began to think that the old
gentleman was a trifle off his head ; but
being a good-natured man, he answered
civilly that as far back as he knew the
attics of this old-fashioned building had
not been altered, and that the roof was
still in ridges and tiled. Thereupon the
old gentleman?whose voice seemed to
quaver at times ?asked if he might be
permitted to go up and out on the roof
for a couple of minutes by himself. It
would be a great kindness. He would
gladly give Holloway a sovereign for his
trouble in getting a ladder.
Holloway hesitated. There was no
trouble about it; for the steps were close
by ; but he began to suspect that all was
not right. What could be the object of
anyone in going out on this dilapidated
old roof ?on the grey and raw afternoon
of a January day ?with nothing visible
but the backs of a lot of buildings, and a
bit of the side wall of the Mansion
House ?
All the same, he looked at the old
gentleman. He did not appear to be one
likely to be connected with a gang of
housebreakers. In any case, what harm
could be done in a couple of minutes ?
He would himself go up and examine
the place as soon as the old gentleman
had gone.
So he got the steps, removed the
wooden covering of the hatchway, and
assisted the stranger to ascend. In two
or three minutes the old Scotchman came
down again, slipped a sovereign into
Holloway?s hand without speaking a
word, and hurried away.
By this time Holloway ought to have
been on his way back to the shop ; but,
just to make sure that he had done no
mischief, he went out and on to the roof.
Certainly there was nothing very wonder-
ful to be seen in the slopes of tiles rising
on each side to a stack of chimneys.
There was no trace of the old gentleman
having been there ; no rope thrown over
to a neighbouring building; no prepara-
tion for a burglary. He descended, told
his wife of the matter, and then hurried
off to the shop?puzzled, but a sovereign
the richer.
Well, year after year this mysterious
old 'cotchman punctually paid his visit,
and Holloway and his wife received their
sovereign, and were none the wiser. It
is true they gathered several particulars
about himself, for he was far from being
taciturn; and once or twice, when he
had brought the children some small
presents he stopped for a little while and
talked. He was a Mr. Duncan Macnab,
that they knew. They gathered from
his conversation that he had been many
years abroad engaged in commerce ; that
his return to England had taken place
just before his first visit to the lane; that
he was rich; that he had but few acquaint-
ances, and probably no relatives, for he
never spoke of any. But as to the object
of this annual visit no reference was ever
made by him, and of course they dared
not ask. But they talked about it be-
tween themselves, Mrs. Holloway being
especially curious.
One New Year?s Day Mr. Macnab did
not arrive at the usual time; and the
salesman and his wife began to look
grave, for a sovereign which they had
spent in anticipation was of consequence
to them. Holloway waited a quarter of
an hour, twenty minutes, half-an-hour
after the time at which he was due at
the shop; then lie gave up hope, and
went gloomily off to his business. He
had not gone five minutes when the old
gentleman arrived.
Now if Holloway had been at home
his wife?s curiosity would have been kept
within bounds; but as it was, it over-


mastered her courtesy, and she resolved
to find out at last what this mystery
was. No sooner had Mr. Macnab gone
out on the roof than she stealthily crept
up the steps, listening intently. There
was no sound. She ventured to put out
her head a little bit, and then she saw
that his back was turned to her. She
could not resist the temptation to wait
and see.
Yet what did she see after all P Here
was an old man standing on an old-
fashioned tiled roof, and apparently lost
in silence and contemplation. Then he
took out from his pocket a small bottle
and a glass, and she saw that his hand
trembled as he filled the glass. And
what was it he said?in a low and broken
voice?-
? I drink this glass to you,Ben-na-Braren;
and to you, Carrie- Cranach; and to you,
Ben Lena; and to any that may be alive
now and near ye, and to the memory of her
that kenned ye all.?
He turned his head as he spoke, and
she saw that tears were running down
his face. At the same moment, too ?her
curiosity had spell-bound her, and she
could not stir ?-she found him looking at
her. An awful sense of guilt rushed in
upon her conscience ; and in some wild
way she thought of standing her ground,
and making an excuse; but the old man?s
look had nothing in it of anger or vexa-
tion at being watched. He merely said,
coming forward to her :
? Take heed, my good woman, that ye
do not fall.?
? I ?l thought ,? she stammered,
and indeed, as she had no excuse at all,
she was forced to save herself from
further confusion by simply descending
the frail steps. He followed her.
The timid little woman stood before
him, with her eyes cast down, as if she
expected judgment to be pronounced upon
her. He seemed either unaware of her
indiscretion, or resolved to take no notice
of it.
? Where are the children, goodwife ?
I have some bits of things for them.
Guess they don?t know much about New
Year?s Day in this country ; but sweat-
meats and toys never come wrong.?
The children were soon put into pos-
session of these presents, the old man
meanwhile regarding them with a strange
and wistful look on his face.
? London bairns, ay,? he said, appa-
rently to himself. ? The cheek white?
the arms thin. But I suppose they?re
used to it, poor things. It is different
wi? them that come from the hills ?the
London air tells on their cheeks, too?
but that is only the first of it?only the
first of it.?
He roused himself from this reverie.
? Goodwife, when will your husband be
home the night ??
? A few minutes after eight, sir.?
? Well, tell him I will come down then,
and see him. I want him to do a bit job
for me.?
? Yery well, sir.?
In the evening the old gentleman came
at the appointed hour; and then it
appeared his errand was to ask Holloway
to take charge of a couple of flower-boxes
which he, Mr. Macnab, proposed to place
on the roof whicty. he had visited in the
afternoon. Mr. Macnab would send the
boxes, have them filled up, and supplied
from time to time with such plants as
were appropriate to the season ; all that
Holloway would have to do would be to
water the flowers from time to time.
? Yes, sir, I shall be very glad to have
the boxes,? said he ; but he looked rather
doubtfully at Mr. Macnab. He could
not tell where this mania was to end.
Perhaps something in his tone or look
struck the old Scotchman, who immedi-
ately said And I suppose now ye are
wondering what concern I have wi? that
roof o? yours. Well, it is an old story,
and a long story. I thought there was
no one left to care to hear it, until I saw
the goodwife?s head to-day peeping over
the tiles, and then I knew she was curious
as the rest of the women. Hoots, good-
wife, there wa?nt no harm done?none at
all?you go and fetch the supper in like
a sensible woman, and I?ll tell you the
story ?and I will take a glass of whisky,
if ye do not mind, which I have in my
pocket. It is not the first yarn I?ve spun
in this very room, Mr. Holloway, for I
was a tenant here thirty years ago. Good-
wife, could you give me a drop o : hot
watter ??
The story was a simple one enough ;
but it had its touches both of fun and
of pathos; and it was garrulous and
good-natured. The old gentleman did not
seek to conceal the fact that as a boy his
conduct had not been of the best. He
was more familiar with the hills and
glens?with the haunts of rabbit and


blackcock and snipe?in the neighbour-
hood of the small Highland town in
which he was brought up, than with the
interior of the parish schoolroom. In
fact, when he did present himself before
the dominie, the introduction to the day s
exercises was invariably a couple of
? liffies,? * administered as a punishment
for his having played truant. Moreover,
Killietown was famous for its herring
fleet; and young Macnab being a great
favourite with the fishermen, they were
always ready to take him off with them
when they left before sunset for the
night?s expedition, bringing him back in
the cold grey dawn much more inclined
for sleep than for vulgar fractions and
the reading of the New Testament. The
boy?s uncle, a shrewd and patient old
Scotchman of the name of Imrie, who
kept a shop for the kale of all sorts of
ship?s stores, and who was responsible
for the bringing up of this incorrigible
lad, knew not what to do with him. His
own daughter, a blue-eyed little lass of
eleven or twelve, aided and abetted the
ne?er-do-weel as much as she was able,
saying nothing about his playing truant,
standing by him when he was found out,
and sometimes even abandoning her own
lessons and domestic duties to join the
indolent young rascal in an excursion
after blaeberries through the neighbor-
ing glens. Of course these two became
sweethearts, and young Duncan declared
his bold intention of sailing away in one
of the King?s ships?as soon as he was
old enough?and going to the countries
that were filled with diamonds and.
jewels, and fighting and winning a heap of
these so that he might come back and
make Mary Imrie his wife. And she
was quite content to wait.
In the meantime, however, Duncan
Nacnab was forced to content himself
with less ambitious work. His uncle
took him away from school and wanted
to apprentice him? for the lad was tall
and strong for his age ?to a blacksmith.
That was no use. Duncan took as
naturally to the sea as a wild duck that
has been reared by the side of a mountain
tarn. He was continually with the
fishermen. At last his uncle let him
have his will. Duncan joined a crew
consisting of four brothers who had
? Obviously from loof, tlie palm of the hand. The
instrument of castigation is a good thick band of
leather, sometimes divided into two tails.
bought a smack amongst themselves,
and then his life as a fisherman began.
So the time went on, and Duncan
Macnab and his cousin, Mary Imrie,
were growing up. He, indeed, had so
far advanced to man?s estate that, in the
seasons when there was no fishing pos-
sible, he had gone to Greenock, hired
himself out for a voyage, and come back
with money in his pocket. He had not
yet fallen in with the King?s ship that
was to take him to the country of gold and
diamonds ; but he had found out a way
of earning a livelihood, which made him
independent of his uncle ; and he worked
hard, saved what he could, and drank as
little as any inhabitant of Killietown
could do. For all that old Imrie would
never look upon the lad otherwise than
as a wild, harumscarum fellow, who was
born to be a trouble to all his friends;
and at last, when some neighbour hinted
to the old storekeeper that his daughter
and Duncan Macnab were a likely-
looking young couple, and when the
question was asked whether anything
was as yet settled, Mr. Imrie brought
matters to a crisis. He told the young
man to look out for lodgings in the town,
and gave him to understand that he was
not to speak to his cousin unless when
he was formally invited to the house.
This abrupt and harsh conduct bore
its natural fruit. The young people met
by stealth, and vowed, with many tears,
that nothing on earth should part them.
It was the old story told again. In re-
counting it over his whisky-and-water,
in John Holloway?s parlour, old Duncan
Macnab seemed to be looking at a pic-
ture that was far away. The picture
was mostly of a wild and stormy night,
when the herring fleet had thought it
more prudent to remain in shelter ?the
harbour of Killietown a black expanse,
with one or two points of green and red
fire where the coasters had hung up their
lights?the town visible only as a semi-
circle of shops, their windows blazing out
in the dark ?the streets muddy and shin-
ing with the rain. Then he could see a
young fellow, not heeding the wet very
much, pacing up and down in the dark-
ness, and watching from time to time the
lighted doorway of one of the shops;
then the muffled-up figure of a young
girl coming out; then the hurrying away
of these two to the end of the pier, and a
brief, hurried, happy interview, notwith-


standing the rain and the darkness. But
it was quite different on one occasion,
when Duncan Macnab came home from
the longest voyage he had as yet under-
taken. It was in the summer time, for
he had got back for the herring-fishing ;
and when he arrived in Killietown he
heard that Mary Imrie was staying with
a certain Mrs. Mac Donald, a relative of
hers, who had a farm some few miles in-
land among the hills. Now, the sailor
lad was a great favourite with this Mrs.
Mac Donald, and he made no scruple
about going straight away to the farm,
and demanding that he should be allowed
to see his cousin. Not only was that
favour granted him, but the old High-
land woman also bade him rest content
at the farm for as long as he liked, seeing
that she had but few neighbours, and had
seldom a stranger-face to look at. The
young sailor remained at Sonachie Farm
for seven long happy summer days.
It was, indeed, a time which these two
ever afterwards remembered as the hap-
piest of their life ; and there grew up in
the girl more especially a sentiment of
gratitude even to the inanimate objects
around her?to the silent and beautiful
glen, called Corrie-Cranach, where she
and her lover used to wander; to the
mystic solitudes of the great Ben-na-
Braren, where sometimes they could des-
cry a herd of red deer trooping quietly
along the mountain-slopes ; and to the
more accessible Ben Lena, on the other
side of the valley, which they oftentimes
climbed to get a glimpse of the distant
sea. Mrs. Holloway observed that when-
ever the old Scotchman had to mention
the names of those places his eyes filled,
and he paused in his speech for a moment.
Well, it was at this farm of Sonachie
that these two young people made a
solemn compact with each other ?to this
effect, that, if Mr. Imrie would not listen
to any reason or persuasion, they two
would face the world together on their
own account. That is to say, if he would
not consent, they would do without his
consent ; and that was exactly how
matters turned out. The old storekeeper
said very little when he heard that
Duncan Macnab had been up at Sonachie
farm; but he went himself for his
daughter and marched her home ; and
he forbade her to leave the house for
one moment without his permission. She
did leave it?and for good. One wet and
misty morning Peter Imrie stood looking
at a heavy-looking sloop that was getting
out of the harbour on her way to Green-
ock. He had been offered a share in her
by the owners; and he was having a
speculative look at her as the great brown
sails got more and more of the wind, and
the vessel became more and more dim in
the rain. He did not know that both
Duncan Macnab and Mary Imrie were
on board that boat; though he was
speedily apprised of the fact by a letter
which he found on his return to the store.
He made no fuss about the matter. He
got another young lass to keep his ac-
counts ; and let his neighbours under-
stand that he did not wish to talk about
what had occurred.
Macnab and his sweetheart were
married in Greenock ; and then the girl
wrote to her father, begging his forgive-
ness (though she honestly declined to say
that she was sorry for the step she had
taken), and offering, on the part of
herself and her husband, to return to
Killietown, if her father would meet
them on friendly terms. That letter was
not answered. Then she wrote to Mrs.
Mac Donald, begging her to go down to
Killietown, and see what could be done.
Mrs. Mac Donald replied that she had
done so; that Mr. Imrie?s answer was,
that if his daughter returned to Killie-
town he would leave it; and that it was
quite hopeless to try to make him alter
his decision.
Now Duncan Macnab was a resolute,
enterprising young fellow, and having
patiently, out of deference to his wife?s
wishes, waited to see these negotiations
finished, he set about making the best of
existing circumstances. Moreover, the
girl, too, showed high courage. She had
thrown in her lot with a man whom she
most loved in the world ; and she was
too high-spirited to confess to certain
lingering lookings-back. She was not
afraid. She only bargained that, until
all other resources had been tried, Duncan
should not go to sea; for she did not
wish to be left alone in a town like
Greenock, the size and noise of which
bewildered her. To this Duncan replied
that, as he had been able to earn a living
at sea, he did not doubt he would be able
to do so on land.
Good fortune generally comes to those
who have the least fear of bad. The
young fellow had been only three days in


Greenock, making such applications for
work as he could, when he ran across the
owner of a ship in which he had made
two or three voyages, and on this occasion
the gentleman in question was accom-
panied by his brother, the manager of a
bank in London. The latter, on hearing
Duncan?s story, and perhaps a bit im-
pressed by the young fellow?s frank face,
said he thought he could get him a situa-
tion as hall porter to a bank in London,
with 1/. a week, free rooms at the top of
the house, and coals.
? These are the rooms we came to,?
said the old Scotchman at this point of
the story ?and there was a curious, sad
smile on his face?? this was the first
house we set foot in in London.?
The young Scotch girl carried her
brave spirit up with her to London, re-
solved to make the best of circumstances,
and the circumstances were not bad.
Duncan?s work was light enough ; and he
had plenty of leisure in the long evenings
for educating himself, which he immedi-
ately set to work to do. Then the young
wife knew little of the roar and bustle
of London ; she lived far above it, and it
was understood that she should not de-
scend from her Empyrean heights dur-
ing office hours. Accordingly she set to
make a home for herself, not only in the
lofty little rooms themselves, but actually
on the housetop; and there she had
flower-boxes with various flowers in
them; and on the quiet summer even-
ings, when Duncan had closed the heavy
doors of the bank and gone up to his
wife, that was a pleasant place for them
to sit, especially as there was a stone
coping to the wall which ensured their
safety. And then it was that the girl,
laughing at her own folly, began to make
this a Highland home for herself; and
that ridge of the red roof ?that was the
giant Ben-na-Braren; and that other
ridge?that was her beloved Ben Lena,
with the sea, invisible, behind it; and
the hollow between, with the flowers
down the centre of it?what could that be
but the beautiful, silent glen of Corrie-
Cranach ? In the gladness of her heart
she would laugh and talk to those friends
of her youth; and when she read in the
afternoon it was as if she were in the still
solitude of Corrie-Cranach, until the red
sun in the west went down behind the
Mansion House, withdrawing the ruddy
glow from the ridge of Ben Lena, and
then she knew it was time to descend and
prepare her husband?s supper.
He grew to have as firm a faith in
these fancies as herself. On high days
and holidays?when the birthday of one
of their distant friends came round again,
for example?they invariably paid a visit
to these Highland solitudes to drink a
glass to the health of the absent one.
But they had grown to regard the moun-
tains and the glen as personal friends
also; and the young wife?laughing,
though there were sometimes tears in her
eyes ?never failed to say, ? And T drink
to you, too, Ben-na-Braren; and to you,
Ben Lena; and to you, my beautiful Corrie-
Cranach ; and to all that we know that are
near you.
How, during the progress of this story,
if story it could be called, Mr. and Mrs.
Holloway had noticed that the old
Scotchman, who had begun in a jocular
and garrulous manner, had grown more
and more absent, and his talk had become
disconnected. He was obviously far
more engrossed with these circumstances
around him. At times it almost seemed
as if he were speaking to himself. Then
he ceased altogether: and his hand was
playing rather nervously with the glass
before him on the table.
He rose suddenly.
? Well, my friends,? he said, with an
effort, ?that is all the story ye would
care to hear. You wanted to know why
I come to see ye on the Hew Year?s-days.
That is it. We were Scotch folk; we
drank a glass to our friends on the Hew
Year?s-day ; and when I came back again
to England I thought I should like to
come and see the old place .?
There was an unusual flush in John
Holloway?s face. The worthy salesman
said, with some abruptness, ? I hope, sir,
you will come when you please. And
there is no need to pay us money for
going up above : and as for the boxes?
well, you may be sure, sir, we will look
after them ; and if you will come every
week, and every day if you like, to see
you will be welcome ?
He did not seem to take much heed of
this offer; he was looking absently about
the apartment.
? I do not remember much now,? he
said, slowly, ? about these rooms. They
are greatly altered ; but the hills and
the glen on the roof ?they are much as
they were when she and I sate there on


the summer afternoons. I can remember
them aye, better than the Ben Lena
and the Corrie-Cranach of our younger
days, that we never saw again. It is
strange, I will never see them again?
I had no thought I should ever see these
again. And I suppose that they have
built a great house now on the side of
Ben-na-Braren! and Killietown, I hear,
has become a watering-place wi? hotels in
it! and all the old things and the old
people are gone. Well, I thank ye,
friends. I did not think to find so much
remaining of what used to be.?
He was about to leave, with his sad,
half-suggested story but partly told.
Somehow they did not like to ask him
questions ; he was troubled.
He preceded them to the door, and
turned round with a brisker air.
? I wish ye good night. The boxes will
be here in a day or two, I guess ; and you
will pay good heed to them, good wife
? Indeed I will, sir,? said the shy little
woman, hurriedly. ? But if I might make
so bold, sir?you were speaking of the
flowers that the young lady put up there
?did she live here long ? ?
He paused for a moment.
? She lived in London, in this house, for
one year and two months ?and it seemed
a short time to both of us. When she
was dying, she said she would like to see,
only for once?But indeed there is no
more of that story that ye would care to
hear. Them that it concerns are all dead
now, I suppose, except myself?and I
shall not be long in following.?
With that he abruptly turned, and
disappeared down the narrow staircase.
Three days afterwards the flower-boxes
came : they were covered over with glass,
and had a few spring flowers?from a
greenhouse, of course, ?in them. A few
days after that, again, old Macnab called
on the Holloways, and had a look at the
boxes ; he was surprised to find that the
flowers had not withered by that time ;
but as they were evidently going, he said
he would send and replace them.
After that he used to call more fre-
quently, and made up for any trouble he
might give the Holloways by bringing
or sending'them presents, on various ex-
cuses. He became very friendly with
them; and was blithe and cheerful in
conversation; but he never referred
again to the story he had told them on
that New Year?s Night.
This state of affairs continued till May
last; and then Mr. Macnab?s visits
ceased altogether. The Holloways were
surprised; they were unconscious of
having given any cause of offence ; in-
deed, however friendly he might be in
his manner, they always treated him with
great respect, and they had grown ac-
customed to his periodical visits. They
knew his address; and they would
greatly have liked to know merely that
he was well; but it was not their place,
they considered, to go visiting a gentle-
man who lived in Connaught-square.
At length, however?somewhere about
a month after the old Scotchman?s visits
had ceased?a tall, grave person called
upon the Holloways, and asked them if
they had known a Mr. Macnab. They
said they had.
? The poor old gentleman,? he said,
?is dead. He died a few days ago, after
lying for a long time in a state of insensi-
bility which followed an apoplectic stroke.
You were very well acquainted with him,
were you not P ?
John Holloway merely said that Mr.
Macnab had come to his house several
times, and that his wife and himself had
been glad to see him.
? Because,? said the stranger, ?he
seems to have had no one about him who
was familiar with his ways. He has
left his fortune, which is a tolerably large
one, to various institutions, with the ex-
ception of'one small legacy, which falls
to you. It is �5O a year. There are no
conditions attached ; but there is one
very odd request, made in connection with
the legacy. It is about that, principally,
I have called in to see if you understand
what the old gentleman meant. He says
he does not bind you by this �5O to any
service, but he begs of you that, as long
as you remain in this house, you will
look after certain flower-boxes, and also
that on a particular evening, which you
know, you should a visit to certain
strange places .
The stranger took a piece of paper
from his pocket, and consulted some
memoranda.
? Ben-na-Braren, and Ben Lena, and
Corrie-Cranach, which, he says, are in
your immediate neighbourhood, and that
you should drink a glass ? to the memory
of her that knew them.' This is a very
strange request. Do you understand
what it all means P?


Apparently Mrs. Holloway did: she
was silently crying. As for her husband,
he said?
?It was not necessary for the old
gentleman to have left us money to do
that. We could have done that without
any money, I think.?
?Well, you rob no one by taking it,?
continued the stranger. ? Will you give
me a call in a day or two ? This is my
name and address.?
Since then the Holloways have faith-
fully attended to the first portion of the
old Scotchman?s prayer. As regards the
second, one may be sure that the honest
salesman will not forget, on the afternoon
of the coming New Year?s Day, to go up
and drink a glass, ?To you , Ben-na-
Braren; ond to you , Carrie- Cranach ; and
to you, Ben Lena ; and to the memory of
her that knew you.? And if his wife had
only some little knowledge of the High-
lands, she would doubtless burst into
laughter over his pronunciation of the
Gaelic names ; but perhaps she will not
be thinking of laughing at all just then.

A SLICE OF PLUM PUDDING.
F,
W. F.
Not a very sensational subject, you say.
Rather prosaic, and very suggestive of in-
digestion and nightmare. But why prosaic ?
Now, that is where so many mistakes are
made. In this enlightened nineteenth cen-
tury, life seems to pass so quietly that men
have no time, and perhaps less inclination,
to look a little beneath the surface. How
much is lost by this superficiality? If we
only paused sometimes in the headlong race
for existence to give a little attention to our
fellowmen, we should reach the goal quite
as soon as the others, possibly before them ;
and life would cease to be that terribly
monotonous burden, and increasing strain of
pain and muscle, that so many make it.
But I did not sit down to write a sermon,
so a truce to soliloquising, and attention to
my subject.
It was Christmas morning, not a tropi-
cal summer's day, with all its peculiar ad-
juncts of hot winds and dust storms, but a
genuine English frosty morning. The air
was crisp and invigorating, and I was glad
to walk sharply as 1 wended my way
through the streets of the great city. The
footpaths were crowded with pedestrians,
whose beaming faces and happy looks as
they hastened to their destinations told tales
of the pleasurable anticipations of the re-
unions of old friends and the gatherings of
relations to which they were looking for-
ward. Grandpapa and grandmamma, their
part in the race of life rapidly drawing to a
close, going to spend, perhaps, their last
Christmas with their only son, who, with the
loving partner in his joys and sorrows, has
just entered the list. The industrious work-
ing man, with his wife upon his arm, and the
little ones running beside him, chattering
with the volubility of infantile exuoerance ;
the young and the aged alike mixing in the
throng, and, although in different ways, for
the time being, at any rate, echoing the same
sentiments.
As I turned into the Barbican the merry
chimes of St. Giles?, Cripplegate, burst out,
repeating, in glad accents, the old story of
? Peace on earth, good-will towards men,?
and seeming to ask all to forget their litt e
differences and quarrels, and to begin the
New Year with increased encouragement and
minds unfettered with the remembrances of
the past.
Passing along Chiswell street, my atten-
tion was attracted by a scene that somewhat
sobered my reflections and tinged them with
sadness. Anyone who has visited London
cannot have failed to notice that valuable
institution to the poorer classes, the ? cook-
shops.? Without it many a family would
never know the luxury of a hot dinner from
one year?s end to the other. It was one of
these establishments that arrested my train
of thought and claimed my observation. In-
side all was bustle and activity. Men in
their shirt slevees were busily carving and
weighing out portions of roast and boiled
meats, slices of pudding of various descrip-
tions, and vegetables of every variety, to the
impatient customers waiting their turn at
the counter. A cloud of steam issued from
above the doorway and over the windows,
down which trickled streams of water that
had become condensed. The pavement out-
side was monopolised by a crowd of hungiy
men and boys, who flattened their noses
against the window-panes, and contented
themselves with gazing earnestly on the
tempting luxuries, to them, displayed in such
profusion inside. One little fellow particu-
larly attracted my attention He stood aloof
from the others, and ever and anon, as the
happy possessor of a penny emerged from the
steamy portal with the much coveted slice of
pudding that the bronze portrait of Her
Majesty had enabled him to procure, such an
expression of wistful sadness passed over his
countenance that I instinctively felt in my
waistcoat pocket for a stray threepenny piece
and went over to the boy, in whom 1 began
to take an unwonted though unaccountable
interest. He seemed startled when I spoke
to him, which convinced me he was not one
of the ordinary ? street Arabs,? who are never
at a loss for an answer ; and when I offered
him the silver coin he accepted it with such
diffidence, and yet his looks betokened such
gratitude, that all thoughts of the visit upon
which I was bent vanished; and I deter-
mined to see what he would do with the
money. I concealed myself at a near corner
and waited to see him come out of the shop.
In a few minutes he was again in the street,
with a large slice of plum pudding upon a
piece of paper scarcely the s ze of his hand.
Like the boys that bad preceded him, I ex-
pected to see him make an immediate atta k
upon the unexpected acquisition, but in this
I was mistaken. Taking off his cap he


placed the pudding upon the top of it, and
so, holding it with open hands as one would
a tray, h� started off at a rapid pace along a
narrow lane that would scarcely be accorded
the dignity of a right of? way. I followed him
without his seeing me, and after passing
through a labyrinth of courts and closes I
finally saw him enter a wretched tenement
that one would scarcely expect to find in-
habited by human beings. My curiosity was
aroused to such a pitch that, at the risk of
being unceremoniously bundled out, I quietly
entered the doorway and succeeded in escap-
ing detection. Looking through a gap in the
lath and plaster partition, I was able to take
in the surroundings at a glance. Everything
in the room was scrupulously clean, but the
evidences of terrible poverty were strikingly
apparent. Two chairs, a few blankets in a
corner, a broken teapot, and a cup and saucer
completed the furnishings. Seated upon the
outstretched apology for a bed was an aged
man, who, despite his rags, bore unmistake-
able signs of, alas ! long past prosperity.
The boy was speaking to him, and I overheard
the conversation. Taking the pudding,
which he had not attempted to touch, from
its hiding place, he showed it to the old man,
whom he addressed as father, and exclaimed,
with what I may term joyful sadness, ? See,
father; we shall have a Christmas dinner
after all ! ? His father, instead of, as the
boy seemed to expect, being pleased, looked
very grave, and began asking him with great
earnestness how he had obtained it, and it
was not until the boy had explained every
detail of the little episode in which I had
taken part that the old man?s fears were set
at rest. His voice was weak and he evidently
spoke with difficulty, for the ravages of time
and privation were making rapid strides upon
him. I at once saw that I had stumbled
upon one of those sad cases which occur so
frequently in the great metropolis that they
excite no comment beyond a passing expres-
sion of regret, or perhaps, as is often the
case, are never heard of at all; of people
of title and education utterly reduced by
misfortune, or perhaps early extravagance,
patiently succumbing to actual starvation
rather than solicit help from their friends,
which they know, if given at all, would be
afforded in such a way as to wound and
trample upon the feelings of independence
which as Englishmen they have always
regarded as sacred as honour itself. My
sympathies were touched, and I resolved to
see if something could not be done to alleviate
the sufferings of the little family.
Knocking at the door I entered the room.
The old man attempted to rise on seeing a
stranger, but the effort was too much for
him, and he sank back exhausted. My little
protege, as I already began to regard him,
recognized me at once, and whispered to his
father ; but my first efforts at conversation
were a complete failure, and my opening
questions were answered with such polite
frigidity that I began to despair of ever
getting any further. By degrees, however,
the old man?s reserve gave way, and in a few
sentences he told me the story of his life.
He was the son of a clergyman, and had
himself been intended for the Church. After
graduating at Cambridge, however, he re-
linquished the idea, studied for the bar, and
was called. His father died, and as his
slender income had only sufficed for present
necessities, there remained nothing after the
creditors had been paid in full. Left to his
own resources entirely, he succeeded well for
a time, and married a young lady to whom he
had been attached from childhood. His wife
died in giving birth to the boy through whom
I had discovered his retreat. Misfortune
followed misfortune, younger men stepped
over his head, his health was shattered, and
he was forced to relinquish his profession.
He tried other methods of obtaining a liveli-
hood, and succeeded in earning a miserable
pittance by copying, which sufficed to sustain
himself and his son, whom he watched over
with almost reverential solicitude, until he
was stricken with fever and found himself
without any resources. For weeks they had
lived he scarcely knew how, and now starva-
tion and death stared them in the face. For
himself he didn?t care; his only solicitude
was for the boy, whom, he dreaded to think,
would become an inmate of the parochial
workhouse, I listened to the sad tale with
deep emotion, and at once made arrangements
for his removal to more suitable lodgings,
and provided him with means for his tem-
porary requirements, A few weeks after-
wards he died, and I succeeded in placing
the boy with a wholesale bookseller, in whom
I had the utmost confidence, and who took
him into his family and initiated him into
the mysteries of the trade. The lad was not
unmindful of the confidence placed in him,
and by perseverance and energy he gradu-
ally rose. His education, which had been
neglected in his early days, he completed
during his apprenticeship, and on its termina-
tion he entered the employ of a large publish-
ing firm. His employers took an interest in
him, and assisted him to publish a work he
had written. The work established a repu-
tation for him, and so he was introduced to
the world as one of the most accomplished
writers of the present day. If these pages
should fall into his hands, I know he will
pardon me for telling the story; for lam
sure he will never forget how much he owes
to that slice of plum pudding, any more
than I do the gratification afforded me by
the opportune discovery of his retreat.


CHRISTMAS ON THE DIGGINGS.
J. McWhibter.
Twenty years ago, Christmas in Aus-
tralia was celebrated with the same Eng-
lish jollity that is observable now, but
under far different circumstances. Old
chums, especially on the diggings, will
readily remember this, and I for one have
a lively recollection of some of the diffi-
culties that had to be overcome. Unfor-
tunately, humanity generally is not endowed
with that happy character which Dickens
gives to Mark Tapley, whose happiness in-
creased under the most miserable circum-
stances. I have a profound respect for
Dickens and his wonderful knowledge and
perception of the character of men, yet I con-
fess that I have met with but very few Mark
Tapleys in my time. New chums in the
olden time cannot be described as such happy
beings. A long and dreary expanse of ocean
lay between them and the land so dear to
them ; and the romantic visions that the new
land they had sought glittered with gold and
riches were dispelled, and a feeling of dis-
appointment only was left. Yet there were
many jolly fellows in those times, though I
could scarcely have been reckoned one of
their number. To add to my discomfort, I
had displayed my ignorance of the land I was
coming to by bringing with me a young
wife and two children ; but I will rapidly
pass over the hardships I endured.
What a long journey it was to the dig-
gings in those days. Those arriving in the
colony now, and benefiting by the industry
of the old pioneers in the matter of railways,
would scarcely credit the undertaking that
it was, when the diggings first broke out, to
travel from Melbourne to Bendigo, for in-
stance. It was not the work of four hours,
as now ; but it was the painful journey of a
week. O yes, I recollect it; I have very
good reason to do so ; and I could give, at
this time, evidence concerning that journey
which, in all matters of detail, would satisfy
even a learned judge of the Supreme Court.
I could say that I formed one of a party
which chartered at an enormous price a
dray to carry a few things up to the dig-
gings. I was not mad (the explanation, I
think. is,necessary), but I took my wife and
children with me. Mad as the action may
now appear, I had good reason, while on the
diggings, to congratulate myself for it; be-
cause, on many occasions, while roughing
it my other self proved to be my better half,
and a solace and guide. This was not so,
however, on the way to the diggings. An
opossum severely alarmed my wife on the
second night of our camping out, and a
lizard did ditto with the whole of the com-
pany on the following day. We thought it
was a snake, and the drayman who was not a
new chum, enjoyed the mistake.
At length we entered Bendigo, I carrying
the youngsters, one of them minus a boot,
lost on the way, and not to be replaced for
love or money, and the wife holding on to the
long tails of my coat because there were so
many rude-looking, heardy, blue and red-
shirted men about. How some of them did
laugh at us; and now, as I look back and
picture the scene, in my mind?s eye, I can-
not help echoing the laugh even at this date,
because we must have cut a most ridiculous
figure indeed. But I did not laugh then ; I
was fiercely indignant, and did not even feel
kindly disposed towards some of those good-
natured fellows, who, I could now and then
see, cast glances of pity at the somewhat
frightened and pretty girl by my side.
But I will not enter further into an ex-
planation of the feelings by which I was
moved then. I would rather leave that
subject to the imagination of my readers ;
for my purpose now is to tell the story of
my first Christmas on the diggings.
It was Christmas week when we arrived ;
and I need scarcely say we did not lose
much time in selecting the first convenient
camping place that presented itself to us.
The dray was unloaded, and I set to work
with the erection of my tent; and goodness
knows how long it would have taken me to
complete the task but that I, for the first
time, learned the kindness of the hearts
which lay beneath the rough blue shirts of
some of the diggers. An offer of assistance
from two men was made, and although I
was at first inclined to be stiff and indepen-
dent, a desire to secure the comparative
comfort of my wife and children overcame
my stiffness, and the offer was accepted.
The tent was soon up, I standing helplessly
by, while my two new friends rapidly ac-
complished the work.
Armed with a pick and shoved, I next day
sallied forth in search of fortune, but in any-
thing but a confident frame of mind. My
wife was desirous that I should appear res-
pectable, and, to satisfy her, I wore a clean,
but somewhat ruffled, white shirt. Of
course I did not understand alluvial gold


mining, and being moreover bashful, I com-
menced operations as far away from the other
diggers as possible, and that was on the
side of a hill. I need scarcely say that on
that day I blistered my hands all to no
purpose. There was no gold there, and I
was laughed at; but I gained experience,
and received a lesson from some kindly dis-
posed miners, who showed me where to look
for and expect gold. One of the men pro-
mised to take me to a gully on the follow-
ing day, and show me where to sink. I
gladly accepted the offer, for my funds were
getting awfully low, but I kept that from
my wife, and alone bore the misery of the
thought that starvation might be in store for
my little family. It was then only three
days to Christmas.
Accompanied by the man who had offered
his assistance on the previous day, I left my
tent on the next morning, and under his
direction commenced operations in the bed
of a gully. It was hard, painful work for
me, but I toiled on. My digger friend bot-
tomed his hole on the first day, and his suc-
cess cheered me on. Off the bottom he
washed about five ounces of gold, and next
day I returned to my work with more hope.
On the afternoon of the third day I bot-
tomed. Old Donald (that was the name of
my digger friend) w ashed the stuff for me,
but disappointment was my lot. Only a few
specks of gold were obtained, but Donald
gave hopes, and told me that I had bottomed
in a dip, and advised that I should follow
the bottom up the rise, where the wash-dirt
looked better. Two or three coarse specks
encouraged me in this effort before I ceased
work for the night, and I returned to my
tent tolerably pleased. It was Christmas
eve, and a very hot one it was. I sought to
cheer my wife with a sight of the two or
three atoms of the precious metal of which
I had become the proud possessor. She was
pleased, I think, and we talked over the
Christmas eves and the Christmas days of
the past; and how happy did they appear to
have been as compared with the position we
were then in ! This train of reflection was
not calculated to enhance the pleasure of
this my first Christmas Eve in Australia,
and if I entertained feelings of peace and
goodwill towards all mankind, I certainly
did not extend the same feeling towards my-
self. Nor was the hot atmosphere, and
the prevalence of attentive mosquitoes,
calculated to improve or soothe the temper,
which I felt was ruffled to a degree, as I
reclined to rest?if the troubled sleep into
which I fell can be called such The night
wore into morning, when I was suddenly
startled, and I assumed a sitting posture.
? Robbers,? whispered my terrified wife,
and it at once became apparent to my
sleepy senses that someone was attempting
to remove the tent from over our head. Tug,
tug at the ropes, and the tent shook in every
part. I felt that it was time to do or say
something, so, arming myself with the only
weapon within reach, a tin candle-stick, I
called out as sternly as I could, ? Stand, or I?ll
fire ! ? Although I did say stand, I would
have been heartily glad to have heard
retreating footsteps, but the only reply I
received was tug, tug, tug at the ropes, while
a small scream from my wife nerved me
to further action. Springing through the
doorway, I made a dash with the candle-stick
at a dark object. A howl from the object,
which at once beat a hasty retreat, proved
an immense relief. The robber was a dog,
which had endeavoured to remove a piece
of meat which I on the previous night had
wrapped up and tied to the fly of the tent.
Thus my first Christmas on the diggings
was ushered in. A few men worked that
day, and certainly I never intended to do
so, but anxiety or something caused me to
visit my hole. When there the temptation
was too strong. I took my pick, which I had
left at a neighbouring digger?s tent, and
with it I gave two or three idle picks at the
wash-dirt, but with what a startling result 1
I shall never forget it. My blood seemed to
stop its circulation and my heart to beat;
for there, beneath the point of my pick
glittered the portion of a large lump of gold.
0, I knew it was gold, and while removing
the earth from around it I treated it with
immense respect and feared to give it even a
blow from my pick lest the treasure should
vanish from my sight. There it was, however,
and it turned out to be 120 ozs. in weight,
while a smaller piece of this precious metal
which lay by its side proved to be 30 ozs.
Need I say that we were happy that day.
My wife wept with joy when I presented her
with such an acceptable Christmas pudding,
while I conceived a sudden affection for the
colony, which has not, nor never will, be
erased. It is surprising what an effect that
piece of gold had; and, if my opinion is
worth anything, I should say that if money
at times is a source of evil, it is more fre-
quently the source of happiness, and is
especially so when the possession of it
enables us to secure the happiness of those
we love. Such were my experiences on my
first Christmas Day on the diggings.
