The War Service Homes Act provides the machinery
which has been set up by the Commonwealth Government
to assist ex-members of the Defence Forces and their
dependants, and other classes of eligible persons, to obtain
homes on what must be regarded as liberal terms.
The Act is administered by the War Service Homes
Commissioner, and this booklet outlines the conditions
under which homes may be obtained and the procedure
to be observed by intending applicants who desire to avail
themselves of the provisions of the scheme.

COMMONWEALTH WAR
SERVICE HOMES.
The War Service Homes Act is one aspect of the Common-
wealth’s general policy of rehabilitating ex-service personnel and
their dependants.
In some respects it is the most important aspect, because it
provides a means whereby they may acquire that basic necessity
—homes of their own.
The purpose of the War Service Homes Act is not merely to
enable ex-service personnel and certain other classes of eligible
persons to obtain homes on the easiest possible terms, but also
to ensure that those who take advantage of the facilities offered
are provided with substantial and durable dwellings.
Originating after the 1914-18 war as a part of the wider field of
repatriation, the War Service Homes scheme is administered by
the War Service Homes Commission and is distinct from the
Commonwealth-States housing scheme.
The War Service Homes Act has been liberalized by increasing
the maximum amount of assistance available from to 1,250,
and its provisions now apply to persons who served in either the
1914-18 war or any war which commenced on and after 3rd
September, 1939.
A condition precedent to the granting of assistance is that
an applicant must be married, about to marry or have dependants
for whom it is necessary for him to maintain a home.
Further, the War Service Homes Commission must be satisfied
that the home is intended to be used by the applicant as a home
for himself and his dependants.
Special provisions exist for the granting of assistance to ex-
members of the nursing services for the establishment of a hospital,
sanatorium or nursing home.


The War Service Homes Commission may refuse an application
by an eligible person, if it is not satisfied that the applicant has a
reasonable prospect of carrying out the terms of the agreement
made, or if it is considered undesirable.
The War Service Homes Commission must also be satisfied
that all homes will be substantial and durable, that plans and
specifications comply with prescribed conditions and that, having
regard to the locality in each case, the risk is a reasonable one for
the Commission to undertake.
THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR HOMES.
The War Service Homes Act defines the classes of eligible
persons. Briefly these are as follows—
(a) an Australian soldier (see definition below);
(b) a munition worker who served overseas under agreement
with the Commonwealth during the 1914-18 war;
(c) a war worker who served overseas under agreement with
the Commonwealth during the 1914-18 war;
(<s?) a member of the Y.M.C.A. who served overseas as a
representative of that Association during the 1914-18
war;
(e) a person who was awarded the Australian Mercantile War
Zone Badge or the British Mercantile Medal in respect
of his employment during the 1914-18 war and who,
during such employment, was domiciled in Australia;
(/) a person who from the outbreak of war on 3rd September,
1939, to 18th April, 1946, was employed under agreement
as master, officer or seaman, or under indenture as
apprentice, in sea-going services on any ship engaged in
trading between a port of an Australian State or Territory
and any other port, including a port of an Australian
State or Territory, and who was domiciled in Australia
during such employment;
(g) the widow of any person specified in paragraphs (a), (b),
(0, W or (/) above ’


( h ) the mother of any deceased unmarried person specified
in paragraphs {a), ( b ), ( c ), ( d ), (<?) or (/) above,
provided that —
(i) she is a widow and was, prior to the appointment,
enlistment, acceptance or employment, as the
case may be, of the person so specified,
dependent on him; or
(ii) her husband is so incapacitated as to be unable
to contribute materially to her support.
Australian soldier means a person who, during the 1914-18 war,
or during any war which commenced on or after 3rd September,
1939, and continued until the formal declaration of a state of peace,
(1) was a member of the Naval, Military or Air Forces of
Australia enlisted or appointed for, or employed on,
active service outside Australia, or on a ship of war; or
(2) was a member of any nursing service of the Defence Forces
of the Commonwealth accepted or appointed for service
outside Australia; or
(3) served in the Naval, Military or Air Forces of any other
part of the King’s Dominions, and who proves to the
satisfaction of the War Service Homes Commission that
he resided in Australia before his enlistment or
appointment; or
(4) served in any nursing service of the Naval, Military or
Air Forces of any other part of the King’s Dominions,
and who proves to the satisfaction of the War Service
Homes Commission that she resided in Australia before
her enlistment or appointment.
Attention is particularly drawn to the phrase “ enlisted or
appointed for, or employed on, active service outside Australia ”.
In certain circumstances, this definition would confer eligibility
for a war service home on a member of the Commonwealth Military
Forces who, although he may not have been enlisted or appointed
for such purpose, was in fact employed on active service beyond
the geographical boundaries of the Commonwealth. For instance,
active service in the South-West Pacific, New Guinea, Papua or the


islands to the north of Australia would bring such person within
the definition of an Australian soldier, although normally members
of the Commonwealth Military Forces are not eligible.
In certain circumstances, assistance may be granted under the
War Service Homes Act to the wife of an eligible person who is
temporarily or permanently insane.
In every case eligibility is determined by the War Service Homes
Commission in accordance with the requirements of the War
Service Homes Act and the Regulations made thereunder.
If any intending applicant is doubtful as to his or her eligibility
for assistance, inquiry should be made of the Branch of the War
Service Homes Commission in the State in which he or she resides.
Inquiries may be made personally or by letter, and will be dealt with
promptly.
THE ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE.
Application under the War Service Homes Act may be made
for the following purposes:—
(a) for the purchase of a dwelling-house and land under a
contract of sale; or
(b) for an advance by way of mortgage to—
(i) erect a dwelling-house on land owned or leased
by the applicant;
(ii) purchase land and erect thereon a dwelling-house;
(iii) purchase a dwelling-house together with the land
on which it is erected;
(iv) complete a partially erected dwelling-house owned
by the applicant;
(v) enlarge a dwelling-house owned by the applicant;
or
(vi) discharge any mortgage, charge or encumbrance
existing on the applicant’s holding.


MAXIMUM LOAN OR ADVANCE.
The maximum loan or advance which may be made under the
War Service Homes Act is £1,250. It is competent, however, for
any applicant to supplement the amount of loan or advance
approved by the War Service Homes Commission to meet the cost
of the home which he desires to build or acquire.
FORMS OF ASSISTANCE.
Assistance may take one of three forms:—
(a) Rent Purchase System, under which the applicant may be
required to provide a deposit of not more than 5 per
cent, of the purchase money. In such cases the security
is by way of contract of sale and the title to the property
stands in the name of the War Service Homes
Commissioner;
(b) Advance on Mortgage, under which the maximum
advance may not exceed 90 per cent, of the total value
of the property, or £1,250, whichever is the lesser. In
such cases the borrower must establish an equity of
not less than 10 per cent, of the value of the land and
dwelling-house; or
(c) Special Advance Case, in which the advance is made by
instalments and the applicant undertakes the responsi-
bility of erecting the home. The procedure relating to
special advances is set out in a later section of this booklet.
Irrespective of the terms under which assistance is obtained, the
genera] provisions of the War Service Homes Act relating to rate
of interest, terms of repayment and other conditions apply equally
to all applicants.
Normally, an applicant will be granted assistance under the
War Service Homes Act in respect of one home only and, except
in special circumstances, a loan or advance will not be approved on
more than one occasion.
It is competent for a purchaser or borrower to apply to the War
Gratuity Board for the payment of his war gratuity credit to the
War Service Homes Commission for use towards the purchase price
of the home.

RATE OF INTEREST.
Interest in all cases is at the rate of per cent.
REPAYMENT OF LOANS.
Loans under contract of sale or advances under mortgage are
granted for periods up to 45 years. In the case of a widow or
widowed mother of an Australian soldier this figure may be
increased to a maximum of 50 years.
Instalments are calculated to repay the loan or advance and
interest over the agreed term by monthly instalments.
The following are typical repayment instalments:—
( Note. —Figures in brackets indicate the weekly equivalent of the monthly
instalments).


The period of repayment is based in each instance on the
circumstances of the applicant, the risk involved and the nature
and condition of construction.
In addition to the liberal terms of repayment, the War Service
Homes Act provides sinking fund facilities for purchasers and
borrowers, who may lodge sums additional to the instalments
payable. Such sums earn interest at the same rate as that chargeable
on the loan or advance, and may be used to meet payments in
respect of rates, repairs, or instalments accruing due, or may be
allowed to accumulate to discharge the loan or advance at a date
earlier than that agreed on. A purchaser or borrower may discharge
his liability at any time.
In addition to meeting his obligations to the War Service Homes
Commission, each purchaser or borrower is required to pay
municipal rates, insurance and other outgoings in respect of his
property, and at his own expense to maintain the home in a satis-
factory condition of repair.
NO LIMITATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL CHOICE.
The War Service Homes Commission does not build homes in
anticipation of demand. Each home provided under the War
Service Homes Act represents a separate unit to be acquired by the
individual applicant, who may determine for himself the type of
home he desires, the design, the locality in which he wishes to
reside, and the price which he is prepared to pay.
An application may be lodged for the erection of a home either
on land already owned by the applicant, or on land to be selected
by him. Provision exists also for granting assistance for the erection
of a home on Crown land leased in perpetuity by the applicant
from a State.
Construction may be carried out in brick, timber or other
materials of approved standard and, where desired, the War Service
Homes Commission will prepare plans and specifications
embodying the applicant’s requirements. It will also call tenders
and supervise the building of the home. Fees to cover the cost of
these services are capitalized by the Commission and form part of
the final cost of the land and dwelling-house.


Alternatively, an applicant may prefer to turn to the Commission
only as a financing agent, and employ his own architect and
builder. This procedure is outlined in the following section.
SPECIAL ADVANCE CASES.
The applicant may himself undertake the erection of his home
with the aid of an advance by instalments granted by the War
Service Homes Commission.
The grant of a special advance by way of instalments imposes
certain obligations on the applicant, who is required to ensure that—
(a) the work of construction is proceeded with at a rate and
in a manner satisfactory to the Commission; and
(b) the erection of the building is proceeded with in accordance
with the plans and specifications approved by the
Commission.
Failure to observe these conditions may entail the Commission
taking action after notice in writing to —
(i) withhold payment of any instalment;
(ii) call in the amount due under the mortgage; or
(iii) enter on the mortgaged land and complete the work at
the expense of the applicant.
The dwelling-house may be erected on land already owned by
the applicant, including Crown land which he has leased in
perpetuity from a State, or on land selected by him. Where land
held by the War Service Homes Commission is selected and
allotted, the applicant is required to pay the full value of the
allotment in cash at settlement in order to acquire title to the land
in fee simple, after the proposal has been approved and a building
tender accepted.
The maximum amount of advance which may be granted under
the War Service Homes Act cannot exceed 90 per cent, of the total
value of the land and dwelling-house in respect of which the
advance is approved, or £1,250, whichever is the lesser.
The first step in connexion with the granting of an advance
is to lodge an application on the prescribed form for assistance
under the War Service Homes Act. Until this has been done, no
action can be taken in regard to the proposal.


An applicant for an advance by instalments must specify the
amount for which he is applying, the purpose for which the advance
is desired, and the approximate number of progress payments to
the contractor which he will require during the construction of
the dwelling.
On receipt of an application, the preliminary requirements of
the establishment of eligibility, land valuation, identification survey,
search against title, &c., will be dealt with. Provided these
are satisfactorily concluded, the proposal will be accepted and the
applicant advised. Where the land is owned by the applicant, the
title must then be lodged with the Commission.
An advance cannot be granted, or any part of it authorized for
payment, until the borrower has completed a mortgage in a form
approved by the War Service Homes Commission for the purpose
of securing the full amount of the advance. Until this has been
done and, in addition, the applicant has been advised in writing by
the Commission that he may proceed with the construction of the
home, no action should be taken to enter into a building contract.
Fees.- —Payment of fees for the preparation of plans and specifi-
cations and for the supervision of construction must be made by the
applicant direct to the private architect whose services have been
engaged. These charges cannot be included in the advance, but
they may be included in the total cost of the home for the purpose
of determining the equity of the applicant in the proposal. In
certain circumstances, an applicant may utilize the whole or portion
of his war gratuity credit to meet the fees payable to his architect.
Note also the sections below concerning fees and insurance.
Plans and Specifications. —On receipt of advice from the War
Service Homes Commission that the application has been accepted
and that the proposal is in order to proceed, the applicant may
arrange for the plans and specifications to be completed by his
private registered architect or other competent person. The name
and address of the person by whom the plans and specifications are
to be prepared, and also the name and address of the architect
under whose supervision the dwelling-house is to be erected, should
be notified to the Commission in writing.


Three copies of the plans and specifications should be submitted
to the Commission for perusal and examination. They must comply
with the following conditions: —
(i a ) Each plan must show —
(i) a plan of the buildings, section and two elevations:
(ii) general construction;
(iii) figured dimensions; and
(iv) levels and falls.
(b) Every specification must clearly describe the whole of the
work and the materials required for carrying out the
construction of the building.
(<r) Working details must be supplied for all construction and
built-in fixtures.
In addition, a block plan will be required showing the position
of all buildings and the drainage system to be installed. This mav
• appear on the same sheet as the plan referred to in (a) above.
Specifications should be typewritten or printed, and must
describe fully the method of construction, the materials to be used,
the sizes and spacing of all timbers, &c.
The plans and specifications must be endorsed with the approval
of the applicant prior to submission to the War Service Homes
Commission, and they must comply with the requirements of local
government authorities and of any title covenants.
A perusal fee of £3 3s. in the case of brick construction, and
£2 2s. for timber framed construction, is charged by the
Commission. This fee should be remitted with the plans and
specifications.
Should the Commission approve of the plans and specifications,
it will retain one copy and return to the applicant the remaining
two copies bearing its endorsement.
The plans and specifications must be approved by the local
municipal council or other local governing body before any
constructional work is commenced. This is the responsibility of
the applicant and/or his architect, as also is the procurement of
any building permit or other authority which may be required in
connexion with the building of the home.


Tenders. —Subject to the approval of the War Service Homes
Commission and the local government authority to the plans and
specifications, steps may be taken by the applicant and/or his
architect to obtain tenders for the construction of the home. A
copy of the tender which is recommended by the architect and
approved by the applicant must be submitted to the Commission
for retention.
The amount of advance to be granted will be based on the
estimated cost of the home, including the value of the land, tender
price, architect’s fees, &c.
After completion of the requisite legal documents and payment
of the prescribed fees, the applicant may authorize his architect
and builder to proceed with the construction.
Construction. —The building agreement with the contractor
should be completed by the applicant, or by the architect acting
on behalf of the applicant, and a certified copy lodged with the War
Service Homes Commission.
The applicant must accept full responsibility for the construction
of the home under the supervision of his architect in accordance
with the plans and specifications. The responsibility of the
Commission is limited to granting the advance and paying the
instalments as the wor\ proceeds.
In the event of any variation of the plans and specifications
after the agreement has been signed, the Commission must be
advised of complete details, as well as of any variation of the
contract price, and its approval obtained. Failure to do this may
involve the withholding of the advance, or of the unexpended
balance.
Finance. —The first instalment of the advance will not be paid
until the applicant has expended his proportion of the cost of the
home, i.e., the difference between the accepted tender price and the
approved advance.
When the applicant desires payment of an instalment, he must
give the War Service Homes Commission at least three days’ clear
notice in writing, and support the request with a certificate by his
architect. On receipt of such request, the Commission will arrange
for an inspection of the building by an authorized officer, who will


issue a certificate of value of the work completed. The amount of
the instalment paid will be based on the officer’s certificate, and will
not exceed 90 per cent, of the value of the work carried out, or
include the value of materials on the site. The officer’s certificate
will be conclusive evidence of the value of the dwelling-house at
the date of its issue.
A fee of 10s. 6d. will be charged for each certificate of value.
This may be paid in cash by the applicant, or may be recovered
from the sum advanced.
Interest at the prescribed rate will be payable by the applicant
from the date of payment of an instalment. Payment will be made
in such manner and at such time or times as the Commission
determines. Normally interest payable on progress instalments
is adjusted on completion of the erection of the home.
Survey Certificate. —Before his request for a progress payment
to the contractor the applicant will be required to arrange for the
identification survey to be brought up to date by a registered
surveyor or other qualified person, so as to show the position of
the foundations.
Completion of Building. —The applicant must advise the War
Service Homes Commission immediately the dwelling-house has
been completed in order that steps may be taken to finalize matters
connected with the advance. It is important that this should be
done before the applicant takes possession.
FEES.
The War Service Homes Commission charges fees in all cases
to cover valuation of land (other than land owned by the Com-
mission and selected by the applicant), identification survey, search
against title, and preparation and registration of the necessary
legal documents. These fees, which are kept to a minimum, are
payable in cash and ordinarily amount to about £6.
Usually the Commission’s documents are not liable for stamp
duty. This does not apply to an applicant’s purchase of land from a
private person or to other transactions between purchaser and
vendor, which are subject to State stamp duty provisions.


INSURANCE.
All buildings in respect of which loans or advances have been
made under the War Service Homes Act must be insured with the
War Service Homes Commission, which operates a special fund
for the purpose. The insurance is both for the benefit of the
Commission and the insured.
The amount of insurance for each home is determined by the
Commission. Usually it is for a sum equal to the replacement value
of the dwelling-house, outbuildings and fencing.
Premiums are generally less than those charged by private
companies.
The insurance is of a comprehensive nature and the policies
give coverage against fire, lightning, flood, tempest, damage by
explosion, thunderbolt, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, strikes,
labour disturbances, burglary or housebreaking (including any
attempt thereat), or aircraft and bursting of boilers, hot water
pipes or heating apparatus. A novel feature is the insurance of
instalments over a period of six months. This provides against
payment of both rent and instalments should the home be rendered
uninhabitable by damage under a prescribed risk.
A cover note will be issued by the Commission when the
building contract has been signed and materials are on the site.
In no case is insurance with a private company permitted.
RIGHTS OF HOME OWNERS.
The owner of a war service home may deal with it in any one
of four ways —
(1) He may discharge his liability at any time.
(2) He may sub-let it, subject to compliance with the conditions
of his contract or mortgage.
(3) He may transfer it to another person eligible for a war
service home on conditions approved by the War Service
Homes Commission.
(4) He may sell it to realize his equity.
Note. —It must be emphasized, however, that an applicant will
ordinarily be assisted once only, and that a second application by
one person for a war service home will be approved only in
exceptional circumstances.


HOW TO APPLY FOR A HOME.
Normally, applications are dealt with in order of priority of
lodgment and subject to the availability of labour and materials.
Building applications are proceeded with as expeditiously as
possible.
Where an application is for the purchase of an erected dwelling-
house or for the discharge of a mortgage, settlement is effected as
early as possible after completion of the preliminary stages covering
determination of eligibility, valuation, search against title and
identification survey.
In cases of hardship, or where an applicant suffers from extreme
war disability, the War Service Homes Commission may deal with
an application as one of emergency.
The War Service Homes Act is intended primarily to assist
those who are eligible thereunder and if an intending applicant is
to receive the full benefit of its provisions he is strongly advised not
to commit himself to the purchase of land, or land and dwelling,
or to enter into any contract until he has first consulted the War
Service Homes Commission.
The procedure is initiated by a formal application for assistance
which must be made in each case in order that the applicant s
eligibility may first be determined.
Until the War Service Homes Commission has indicated that the
proposal is one which it has power to consider every applicant is
strongly advised not to assume any obligation that he may have
difficulty in meeting in the event of his application being
unsuccessful.
Forms of application and all information connected with war
service homes may be obtained from any State Branch of the
War Service Homes Commission either by personal or written
inquiry.
Intending applicants are advised to begin by consulting the
Deputy Commissioner of War Service Homes in the State in which
he desires to obtain assistance.
