RIVER-BED CLAIM ON THE TURON.
Here are shown the men at the pump which is lowered to the depth of 12 or 14 feet from
the surface. It is supported by two saplins placed on either side and extending across the
pit or shaft which is generally from 12 to 14 in width. The workmen at the pump are
supported on a sheet of bark which is placed across the saplings as is also the figure hanging
over for the purpose of raising the bucket containing the earth or washing stuff. The bark
shoot which is attached to the pump conveys the water in the direction of the cradler who is
shown in the attitude of rocking and baling, and it requires both muscular power and
practice to make a good cradler. . * _
