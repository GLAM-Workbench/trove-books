GIVE !
A copper coin for the Belgians,
It is little enough to ask,
Bor the gallant hearts that have bled and
Doing their loyal task.
Don’t count the coins already spent,
Give, though you cannot spare,
They have given their homes, their lives,
And now their land lies bare.
their loved
w hat if your need is great, my friend,
Is their’s not greater still?
How would ye fare in your guarded land
If the Huns had had their will?
Battered, and torn, and bleeding,
Still Belgium barred the way,
And now that she lies at the tyrant’s feet,
Now is our turn to pay.
A copper coin for the Belgians,,
For the gallant hearts in their need.
Whilst death and famine stalk their land
Despoiled by the German greed.
Give, for their dying heroes,
Give, for their widowed wives,
Give, for their handless children,
And their saddened, tortured lives.
We have our hands to work with,
Our acres of hill and plain,
Let the gift be ne’er so heavy,
We can earn the gold again.
Gold for the starving Belgians,
Give, though we stint our own,
We cannot owe all to a loyal friend,
And leave her to pay alone.
—Harriett Lallan.
