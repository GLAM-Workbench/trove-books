PREFACE
On March 31, 1949, Newfoundland formally entered
Confederation as Canada's tenth province. The Dominion
Bureau of Statistics immediately proceeded to extend its
services to Newfoundland, As an early step in this extension
it seems desirable to assemble important available Newfound-
land statistics to serve as a background for the more exten-
sive compilations which are to be undertaken by the Bureau.
The material here presented varies in comprehensiveness in
the different fields and is not always strictly comparable with
data for the other provinces. The scarcity of statistical data
has been commented on as a special difficulty attending the
negotiations leading to Newfoundland's entry into Confedera-
tion.
The tables of this bulletin are presented primarily
as a source of reference material for writers, statisticians
and others desiring summarized information concerning the
new province and its people. It is hoped that the informa-
tion contained in this bulletin will fill the need for statistics
on Newfoundland until series fully comparable with the other
provinces can be published.

SECTION 1. - GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
The triangular-shaped Island of Newfoundland, situated between the parallels
46° 35' and 51° 39' N. and the meridians 52° 36' and 59° 25' W., virtually spans
the mouth of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In the north it is separated from the main-
land by the Strait of Belle Isle, about 11 miles wide at its narrowest point. In the
south west it is separated from Cape Breton Island by Cabot Strait which is about
60 miles wide at its narrowest point. The Island is the most easterly part of North
America. The port of St. John's is about 1,900 miles from Liverpool, while the air
line distance between Gander Airport and London,England, is 2,360 miles.
Geologically,the Island of Newfoundland is an integral part of North America,
It consists of the unsubmerged highlands of a now foundered extension of the Appa-
lachian mountain system; the lowlands form part of the banks of the North Atlantic
which lie off Newfoundland. The shore line is rugged and the deep indentation of
numerous bays and headlands creates a coastline some 6,000 miles in extent. The
greatest elevation is along the western border where the Long Range Mountains
rise to elevations of over 2,000 feet, From this, the general level of the land
slopes towards the Avalon Peninsula which has an elevation of about 700 feet. The
interior of the Island is undulating, low hills alternating with rolling plains, marshy
tracts and wooded areas interspersed with numerous lakes and rivers. Productive
forest is found on the better-drained valley slopes and is, normally, mixed soft-
woods and hardwoods with balsam fir, white spruce, and birch predominating. Many
of the lakes are bordered by tracts of agricultural land but the amount of arable
land is limited. ....
The climate is typically maritime, extremes of temperature being moderated
considerably by the influence of the surrounding ocean. The oceanic influence is
modified, however, by the cold Labrador Current and by the Island's situation to the
east of the continental land mass. Precipitation is abundant and well distributed
throughout the year.
In addition to the Island, with an area of 42,7 34 square miles, the Province of
Newfoundland comprises some 112,000 squaremniles of the Coast of Labrador, its
claim to this area having been confirmed by the decision of the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council in 1927. .
Newfoundland ranks seventh among the provinces in area. It is about one-
quarter the size of Canada's largest province, Quebec (594,860 sq. miles) and is
more than three times the combined area of Prince Edward Island (2,184 sq. miles),
Nova Scotia (21,068 sq. miles), and New Brunswick (27,985 sq. miles). The Island
of Newfoundland is about 83 p.c. of the combined area of the three Maritime Pro-
vinces.

(1) Day-degrees represent the difference in temperature between the mean tem-
perature of the air and the temperature of 65°F. multiplied by the number of
days during which the outside temperature was lower than that figure. Fuel
consumption for heating purposes will be proportionate to these totals.

SECTION 2. - POPULATION
The population of Newfoundland in 1945 was 321,819, mostly the
descendants of settlers from southern England and Ireland, More than
98 p. c, of the population is native born, .
The population is unevenly distributed, nearly one-half living on
the Avalon Peninsula in the eastern part of the Island, St, John's, the
capital and Newfoundland's only city, is a trading and commercial centre
of about 45,000 persons within the municipality, or 57,000 persons in
greater St, John's, Apart from St, John's, there are 25 places having a.
population in excess of 1,000, principal amongst these being Bell Island
and Carbonear on the Avalon Peninsula, Grand Palls, Windsor, Botwood
and Bishop's Falls in the interior and Corner Brook on the west coast.
The remainder of the population is distributed among more than 1,300
small settlements spread over 6,000 miles of coastline,
•• The three main religious denominations are Roman Catholic
(33 p,c,), Church of England (31 p,c.) and United Church (25 p.c,). Of
the smaller denominations the Salvation Army has the largest number
of adherents (7 p,c„), followed by Pentecostal (2 p,c,}.
During the past half century there has been considerable migra-
tion to Canada and the United States, Canada's 1941 Census lists 25,837
residents and the United States Census of 1940 lists 21,361 residents
as Newfoundland born.

(1) Refers to Bell Island as a whole, and includes such settlements as
Lance Cove, Freshwater and West Mines.
(2) The population shown for St. John's City represents the number living
within the incorporated limits of the city. Figures sometimes given
for St. John's include a one-mile strip outside the legal boundaries
which,although not actually part of the city, has lately been included for
i such purposes as town planning, etc. This area includes parts of the
following census sections: Boggy Hall, Freshwater Valley, Kilbride,
.Major's Path, Nagle's Hill, Quidi Vidi, and Southside. The population
of St. John's, including all of these sections, amounted to 57,496 in
1945. Some of the sections extend beyond the one-mile fringe but it
is not possible to show the population for the parts strictly within
this limit.

SECTION 3. - VITAL STATISTICS
Births. - Newfoundland r s birth rate is one of the highest among the
white peoples of the world. Daring the two decades before the war the rate
remained remarkably constant, varying from 23 to 28 births per 1,000 popu-
lation. Even during the depression years of the 1930 r s, there was an aver-
age rate of over 24 as compared with about 21 for Canada, Due, in all pro-
bability, to the social and economic conditions of the war years, the rate
increased sharply to a record rate of 36.3 in 1946. In general, the New-
foundland birth rates during the past 20 years are roughly comparable to
those of Quebec and New Brunswick.
. . ’ Deaths. - Newfoundland's death rate, which has varied between 10
and 14 deaths per 1,000 population during the past 20 years, is slightly
higher than the rate for Canada, Infant and maternal death rates have been
higher than in Canada. In addition, there has been high mortality from
tuberculosis and other pulmonary infections. However, the death rate has
declined steadily during the past decade and a half.
Natural Increase. -Up until the late 193 o's, the high birth rate was
offset by a high death rate, with the result that the natural increase in popu-
lation averaged about 11 persons per year per 1,000 population, -- some-
what lower than was the case for Canada. The increase in the birth rate and
the decline in the death rate during the last decade has given Newfoundland
one of the highest rates of natural increase in the world, roughly comparable
with the rate in Quebec.
Infant Mortality. - Prior to 1938, an average of 116 children out of
every 1,000 born alive died within the first year of life, as compared with
86 in Canada. By 1946 the rate had dropped to 74 as compared with 47 in
Canada.
Causes of Death, - Newfoundland has had relatively higher death
rates than Canada from tuberculosis, puerperal causes, congenital mal-
formations and diseases peculiar to the first year of life, diarrhoea,
senility, and pulmonary infections. However, deaths from cancer, intra-
cranial lesions, diseases of the hea-rt, nephritis, and accidents are, on the
whole, lower than in Canada.
Age at Death, - In 1946, over 25 p.c. of the total deaths were of
children under one year of age, and almost 40 p.c. of persons over 60
years of age. This compares with 13,4 p.c. and 56.3 p.c., respectively,
for Canada. Due in large measure to a high infant mortality rate, almost
half of the deaths in 1931 were of persons less than 30 years of age; by
1946; deaths in this group formed less than 43 p.c, of all deaths. The
general trend of the past decade is definitely towards a greater life ex-
pectancy. 4T"
‘Marriages, - Except for 1944 and 1945, the marriage rate has
been, consistently, lower than that for Canada and in only one year
exceeded 10 per 1,000 population. As was the case in Canada, there was
a rise in marriages during the war years.

SECTION 4. - PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE
Due mainly to economic factors, the standard of health in Newfoundland is
generally below that of Canada or the United States, although considerable progress
has been made in recent years. The greatest need for improvement in comparison
with other countries is seen in the high incidence of tuberculosis and malnutrition,
and in the high infant mortality rate.
The death rate for tuberculosis is about three times as high in Newfoundland
as in Canada and is one of the chief concerns of health authorities of the Island.
Recent formation of a Newfoundland Tuberculosis Association, expansion of sana-
torium accommodation, and a vigorous educational program on the value of early
X-ray have all contributed to the improvement displayed in the fall of the tuber-
culosis death rate from 191 per 100,000 in 1939 to 122 in 1946, comparable figures
for Canada being 53 and 470
A nutrition survey was undertaken in 1944 by English, Canadian and United
States investigator s, at the request of the Newfoundland Government, and the dietary,
deficiencies discovered, particularly in vitamins and minerals, led to the adoption
of such steps as fortification of margarine, reduction or removal of import duties
on fruit juices and canned milk, compulsory enrichment of imported flour, increased
relief allowances, and distribution of milk to school children. A similar survey
made in 1948 reported considerable improvement in the sample areas studied..
The general mortality rate in Newfoundland is somewhat higher than that
for Canada, the 1946 figure being 10.4 per 1,000 as compared with Canada’s 9.4,
The infant mortality rate, however, is much higher, being 74 per 1,000 in 1946 as
compared with 47 for Canada, Considerable variations in the rate exist as between
different parts of Newfoundland, some districts comparing favourably with the
Canadian figure while others, notably Labrador, show a rate in excess of 100. A
separate Division of Child Welfare has been set up to deal with the problem.
The administration of most health and welfare measures, including institu-
tional administration, old age pensions, war pensions, allowances to widows,
orphans and indigent persons, and public health preventive measures is the res-
ponsibility of the Department of Public. Health and Welfare. Scales of pensions
and allowances fall considerably short of those obtaining for Canada, due to
necessary limitations on public expenditure*
Newfoundland and Labrador have 22 government hospitals including an
infants' home, a home for the aged and infirm, a tuberculosis sanatorium, an
isolation hospital, a mental hospital, a merchant navy hospital, and an orthopaedic
hospital. Fourteen of these are cottage hospitals which serve outlying settlements,
together with a hospital ship and 6 nursing stations. In addition to these, there are
8 hospitals and 6 nursing stations operated by private companies and associations.
In the northern part of the Island and in Labrador the International Grenlell
Association plays a leading part in caring for the health and welfare of the people,
maintaining several hospitals, schools, orphanages, and handicraft centres. It
encourages agricultural activity and operates a small stock farm. Religious organi-
zations render an important, service in the maintenance of orphanages, several
hospitals and homes for the aged, and delinquents.
Wartime prosperity associated largely with the construction of defence
establishments has been reflected strikingly in the decrease in the numbers of
persons on able-bodied relief which dwindled to a monthly average of 17 9 persons

in 1945 from a 1938 average of 38,099, The improved financial position of the Govern-
ment. has; permitted a fourfold increase in public health expenditure since 1935.
The Newfoundland Government and the city of St. John's have jointly initiated
a large-scale housing programme in the St, John's area, and government grants have
been voted to assist several private housing associations,

SECTION 5. - EDUCATION
Educational facilities in Newfoundland were first, provided by the
various religious denominations and education is still, with few exceptions,
based on the denominational system, although today it is largely financed
from public funds,
Educational policy is formulated by an Education Council composed
of the Commissioner for Home Affairs and Education as Chairman, the
Secretary for Education as Vice Chairman, and a representative for each
of the major religious denominations. The latter are also executive
officers in the Department of Education, Local administration is in the
hands of some 225 Boards of five to nine members appointed by the Govern-,
merit, •
The children, in the majority of cases, attend schools of their own
denomination, The schools are financed by the Government, There is a
uniform and common teacher-training programme, a common curriculum,
and, with few exceptions, common text books. The system of external exam-
inations is common to all schools and a uniform Government scale legulates
the grant allocations to school boards and the minimum salaries paid to
teachers. The Education Act provides for the establishment of inter-
denominational Boards of Education and schools, Some of the largest schools
in the country are of this kind and are known as common or amalgamated
schools In 1942, an Act was passed providing for the free and compulsory
education of children between the ages of 7 and 14. ...
Teacher training is provided at Ivlemorial University College, a
state and non-sectarian institution. This college also provides for the first
two years of the degree course in arts and science, and for three years in
engineering,
* Great progress has been made in recent years in raising educational
standards in Newfoundland, particularly during the war years when improved
public finances enabled the Government to make larger contributions. Since
193 5, the annual cost of maintaining the educational services has more than
quadrupled, The median salary of teachers advanced from $483 in 1940 to
$920 in 1947.

Note. - A university grade certificate requires 3 years professional train-

training and 2 years experience; first grade 1 year of each; second and third
grades are older certificates. In Newfoundland, as elsewhere, a shortage of
teachers has resulted in the employment of unqualified personnel.

Note. - The percentages based on the number of pupils of age 10 indicates the
ages at which pupils are leaving school and gives some idea of the holding power of
the schools. In Newfoundland the first heavy loss comes between ages 13 and 14
despite the attendance laws requiring attendance to the end of age 14. A similar
situation existed in New Brunswick and some oY the other provinces before the intro-
duction of Family A.llowances.

SECTION 6. - INDUSTRIES
A. - FISHING
Traditionally, the chief means of livelihood of the people of Newfoundland
has been the fisheries. Until the end of the 19th century, the Island's economy was
based exclusively upon the export of fish and fish products. Since then, following
the construction of a railway across the Island and the increased accessibility of
forest and mineral resources, considerable economic diversification has taken
place and the export value of newsprint now approximates that of the fisheries.
Exports of fishery products comprised 43 p.c. of Newfoundland’s exports in the
fiscal year 1946-47 and 36 p.c, in the fiscal year 1947-48.
The paramount importance of the fishery in Newfoundland's economic life
lies in the numbers of the population dependent upon it, some 28 p.c, of all gain-
fully occupied Newfoundlanders being employed in the fishing industry as com-
pared with 7 p.c., in forestry and 3 p.c, in mining.
Cod, and particularly dried salt, cod, which holds first place in the fishing
industry, has steadily improved in quality in recent years due in large measure
to improved standards of packing and inspection introduced by the Newfoundland
Fisheries Board which was set up by the Government in 1936, Competitive sell-
ing was replaced by a group marketing procedure under the supervision of the
Board, which led to the establishment, in 1947, of the Newfoundland Associated
Fish Exporters Limited (NAFEL) which is now the sole selling agency for New-
foundland salt cod, The principal market for salt cod is the West Indies.
Modern refrigeration facilities have, in the past ten years, given rise to a
grow’ing recognition of the United States and Canada as markets for fresh frozen
fish, and currency exchange difficulties have fostered this trend by restricting
the markets for salt cod, Other products of the Newfoundland fishing industry are
seals, salmon, lobster, halibut, herring and whales. Fish meals and oils are pro-
duced in considerable quantity and there is a growing canning industry ,

SECTION 6. - INDUSTRIES
B. - FORESTRY
The forests of Newfoundland, comprising some 17,000 square miles,
or about 46 p.c. of the lan4 area (excluding Labrador), are one of her most
important resources, supporting an industry which enjoys second place (after
fisheries) in'the economy. It is estimated that about 17 p.c. of the forested
area, however, is not of present marketable value, due to inaccessibility and
the unsuitability of some stands.
Woods operations and forest products manufactures give employ-
ment to about 12 p.c. of all gainfully occupied males, and exports of forestry
products account for about 40 p.c. of Newfoundland's total, surpassing, in
the fiscal year 1947-48, the export value of fishery products. The chief
markets are the United States and the United Kingdom.
Pulp and paper (newsprint) is Newfoundland's most important
forest industry, Large areas of forest are held on long-term lease by two
pulp and paper companies which operate mills, one at Grand Falls and one at
Corner Brook. These two towns have, as a consequence, developed into
thriving communities supporting satellite industries.
Some 2,000 square miles of forest area is taken up by small opera-
tors of nearly 900 sawmills w'hich produce lumber chiefly for local use. The
Government has reserved a three-mile strip as a source of fuel and lumber
for the inhabitants of the fishing settlements. Much of the coast is bare and
rocky and there has been considerable depletion of this forest.

SECTION 6 - INDUSTRIES
C. - MINING
Mining ranks third (after fishery and forestry products) among New-
foundland’s basic industries, The value of mineral production in 1948 reached
an all-time high of $20,000,000 as compared with the previous record of
$ 15,7 1 1,000 established in 1947, This industry provides a living for some
4,000 workers whose wages and salaries in 1948 amounted to $7,253,000,
Except for a small amount of limestone, all minerals produced are exported
and accounted, in the year 1948, for 20 p. c, of total exports.
The chief minerals are iron ore at Bell Island on the east coast and
lead, copper, and zinc concentrates at Buchans in the interior, The Bell
Island deposits are of good quality but relatively costly as a source of high
grade steel, due to phosphorus content, Buchans' operations have been
carried on since 1927 and have contributed materially to the industrial growth
of that part of the Island,
Fluorspar, which is used as a flux in the manufacture of steel and
aluminum, is produced at St, Lawrence on the Burin Peninsula, and a large
limestone deposit is located at Aguathuna, on the west coast. The principal
market for both these minerals, as well as for the iron ore produced at
Bell Island, is the steel mill at Sydney, Nova Scotia, whilst practically all
lead, copper, and zinc concentrates are exported to the United States.
Recent discoveries of large additional deposits of concentrates in
the Buchans area, and of a very extensive body of iron ore in Quebec boundary
region of Labrador, indicate that the mining industry will continue to play an
important part in the Island's economy.

SECTION 6. - INDUSTRIES
D. - AGRICULTURE
Agriculture plays a relatively minor part in Newfoundland's
economy, rating fourth place (after fisheries, forestry, and mining)
among the Island's basic industries. The climate is not well suited
to the production of any but the hardier crops, and the amount of
arable soil and pasture land is limited. Most food is imported, com-
prising about a third of the Island's total imports annually. Two-
thirds of the food imports are from Canada and most of the remain-
der from the United States.
In the past fifteen years, an active policy of encouragement
of agriculture has been carried on making use of field advisors, soil
surveys and subsidization of livestock improvement, A laboratory
and a demonstration farm are maintained in the St, John's area and
a personnel training scheme for general and fur farming has been
introduced.
About a third of the Island’s improved acreage, including
pasture, is to be found on the west coast, the southern part of which
is better suited than any other region for agriculture. The largest
and steadiest market, however, is the St. John's area on the east
coast, which supports a neighbouring farming community of some
size, mostly of small holdings.
In the rest of the Island, cultivation is mainly on a part-time
family-plot basis by fishermen and loggers. The 1945 Census of
Newfoundland discloses that only 8 p.c. of persons cultivating the
land were full-time farmers, the remainder being fishermen and
others.

SECTION 7. - LABOUR
The distinctive features of Newfoundland's economy are reflected
in the characteristics of the gainfully occupied. As was shown in the pre-
vious Section,the economy rests primarily upon three industries, fishing,
pulp and paper, and mining, based on its main resources. Extensive agri-
cultural development has not been possible because of the generally un-
favourable soil and climatic conditions. Industrialization has been limited
by the restricted nature of the home market. The production of its basic
industries, which is far in excess of domestic requirements, is geared to
the demand in export markets.
The 1945 Census showed that 35 p.c, of the total population were
gainfully occupied, and that over 41 p.c. of the gainfully occupied wetfe
engaged in the primary industries - fishing, forestry and logging, mining,
and agriculture, with fishing (28 p,c.) far in the lead. Over 9p, c. were
engaged in manufacturing, with a large proportion of these in the pulp and
paper mills.
Most workers in the primary producing industries are located in
the central and western coastal regions of the Island, while St, John's,being
mainly a trading and commercial centre, has relatively larger numbers in
clerical, commercial and service occupations. Wage rates are generally
lower than in Canada for comparable trades.
With such large numbers of the population dependent on the fish-
ing industry, it is apparent that any fall in the demand for fish has great
repercussions on the country. A very high rate of unemployment persisted
throughout the 1930'5, mainly due to the poor demand and low prices for
fish exports. Statistics of the numbers receiving Government assistance
show that, prior to the outbreak of the war, as high as one-sixth of the
total population was, at times, on relief.
The wartime stimulus to Newfoundland's basic industries, parti-
cularly the renewed demand and high prices for fish, the enlistment of a
large proportion of Newfoundlanders of military age, and the construction
of large defence bases by the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United
States, resulted in a high level of prosperity during the war years. Pro-
duction and trade expanded greatly, employment reached an all-time high,
and income per worker exceeded all previous levels.
These conditions continued in the post-war period, During the
past year, however, there have been indications of less favourable economic
conditions in some areas. These include a lower fish catch in 1948, the
cessation of work on various construction projects and some slackening of
activity due in part to uncertainties associated with the impending con-
federation with Canada,

SECTION 8. - TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS
Railway and Shipping. - In the centuries while Newfoundland remained
a fishing colony, the sea provided a natural highway and the only means of
transportation for the inhabitants living in settlements along the coast. To-
wards the end of the 19th century, however, the exploitation of other resources
in the interior began to assume greater importance. The construction of a
trans-insular railway by a private company was begun in 1881 and completed
in 1896. In 1923, being in financial difficulties, the railway was taken over by
the Government.
The railway connects St. John's with various parts of the Island. The
main line runs from St. John's to Port-aux-Basques and there are four branch
lines, three of which are operating. In addition, there are several company-
operated spur lines. The total railway mileage is approximately 7 00. The
railway operates, in addition, several steamships which are used in coastal
services carrying mail, freight, and passengers between points in the Island,
as well as in Labrador. Service is also maintained between Port-aux-Basques
and North Sydney and between Corner Brook and North Sydney.
Climatic conditions and the nature of the terrain create special diffi-
culties for railway operation in Newfoundland; the provision of rail and steam-
ship services for the widely scattered settlements is costly and deficits have
been common. During several of the war years there were substantial sur-
pluses but these were more than offset by capital outlays.
<
Canadian steamship companies maintain freight and passenger ser-
vices between various Canadian points and St. John's. A number of small
locally-owned vessels engage in the carrying trade along the coast and also
between Newfoundland and points on the mainland. The regular steamship
services between Newfoundland and the British Isles have usually been com-
bined with services between the British Isles and Canadian or Canadian and
United States ports. With the exception of St. John's and ports along the
southern coast, shipping closes for several months in the winter.
The principal harbours in Newfoundland are administered by three
Harbour Commissions and seven Harbour Boards, and by Pilotage Com-
missions, all responsible to the Government. The Newfoundland Drydock at
St. John's is owned by the Newfoundland Railway.

Roads. - Newfoundland has some 2,000 miles of motorable roads, nearly one-
half of which are in the Avalon Peninsula. Approximately 100 miles are paved, the
rest, gravel surfaced. There are, in addition, some 3,000 miles of local roads within
or around the settlements.
Road construction policy has aimed primarily at connecting the more isolated
districts with St. John's or the nearest large settlements. Various sections con-
structed to serve local needs, however, will eventually be linked up to form a trans-
insular highway running from St. John's to Port-aux-Basques (approximately 625
miles). -
The expenditure provided for roads and bridges in the 1948-49 estimates was
$3,395,000. Of this amount $ 1,100,000 was for maintenance of roads and bridges
and $1,120,000 for construction of new roads.

Civil Air Transportation,, - Newfoundland occupies a unique position in respect
of trans-Adlan! ic aviation, "f>eing the most easterly part of North America and on the
great circle route between the most densely populated areas of North America and
Western Europe, Gander Airport, constructed originally by the British Air Ministry
in the late 1930‘5, is one of the largest airports in the world.
As a result of World War 11, Newfoundland’s facilities for aviation were
greatly improved. Both Canada and the United States were given the right to con-
struct air bases and to establish extensive wire, radio communication, and weather
services. These facilities were for defence purposes, and only such rights of civil
use as were incidental to the prosecution of the war were granted. After the war,
certain of the bases were re-transferred to Newfoundland and civil use of the various
airfields was put on a more permanent basis by means of various agreements,
The principal air fields in Newfoundland are Goose Bay in Lab-
rador, Two air fields built by the United States Government are located at Stephen-
ville and Argentia, Torbay is the eastern terminus of Trans-Canada Air Lines,
Buchans is near the mining development of the same name and Botwood is a sea-
plane base in the mid-north,
Canada has provided the meteorological service in Newfoundland for civil
aviation. Existing United States services are linked with the system.
Posts and Telegraphs, - The postal service and domestic telegraph service
in Newfoundland are operated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, In
addition, some local telephone services are provided as incidentals in certain out-
lying districts.
There are some 550 regular post offices in Newfoundland, including 33 in
Labrador, Of these, 17 0 in the Island and 2 in Labrador are also telegraph offices.
There are some 13 seasonal offices established yearly in transient fishing settle-
ments, In addition, there are several courier routes, aggregating more than
160,000 miles in the Island and more than 7,000 miles in Labrador,
The topography of the country, the lack of roads in many areas, and the
small and scattered settlements along some 6,000 miles of coast militate against
a frequent postal service for much of Newfoundland and make for high costs. The
rates are slightly higher than in Canada and the United States, Direct airmail
services between Newfoundland and Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom,
and several other co\mtries are now in operation.
As regards telegraph services, the Department maintains a trunk wire
circuit along the railway, and more remote settlements are served by wireless
from distribution points on the wired system, Many ot the post offices are also
telegraph offices. Modernization of this system is under way. The use of teletype
circuits has been tested and extended recently and linked with telephone circuits
in certain areas,
Newfoundland has played an historic part in the development of speedy
communication between Europe and North America, The first trans-Atlantic

Broadcasting in Newfoundland has been under the control of the New-
foundland Broadcasting Corporation, a government corporation established in
1939. The Corporation operated three radio stations, one in St. John's, one
in Corner Brook, and one at Gander,’ whilst a fourth is under construction at
Grand Falls. An independent system, the Colonial Broadcasting system
operates a radio station at St, John's. Two broadcasting stations in St. John’s
are owned by churches. The owns a station at Goose Bay, Labrador,
According to the terms of Confederation, broadcasting in Newfoundland came
under the control of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on April 1, 1949.
The radio is of particular importance in view of the isolation of the
people in many of the settlements. Radio licences purchased in Newfoundland
from Jan. 1 - Nov. 30, 1948, numbered 33,140, as compared with 25,253 in
the corresponding period of 1947 and 9,887 in 1937.


SECTION 9. - FOREIGN TRADE
On a per capita basis, Newfoundland's foreign trade
is higher than that of practically any other country in the world,
and has more than trebled in the past ten years. Since 1941, the
balance of visible trade lias been unfavourable, but Government
surplus revenues in the same period indicate that this has been
more than offset by invisible exports chiefly in the form of local
services purchased by foreign capital for the construction and
maintenance of military establishments.
Chief exports are fishery, forestry and mining pro- .
ducts which together account for more than 95 p.c. of the Island's
total exports. Principal markets are the United States, the United
Kingdom and Canada. These three countries buy nearly two-thirds
of Newfoundland's produce, the remaining third, which is mostly
salt codfish, being exported chiefly to the West Indies, Spain,
Portugal, Italy and Greece,
Practically all Newfoundland's domestic requirements
are imported and in the fiscal year 1947-48 amounted to $lO5
million of which foodstuffs comprised 32 p.c., textiles and cloth-
ing 11 p.c., metallic manufactures, machinery and vehicles 25 p.c.,
and fuel and petroleum products 13 p.c. Over 95 p.c. of imports
are supplied by Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the year 1947-48, 52 p.c. of the total imports were from Canada
and 38 p.c, from the United States,

SECTION 10. - PRICES
The wartime and post-war rise in prices in Newfoundland has been greater
than in Canada, The available information shows that the cost of living in October,
1948, in St. John's, was 85 p.c. higher than in October, 1938. In Canada, living costs
were 57 p.c. higher in October, 1948 than at the same date in 1938. Index numbers
of the cost of living in St. John's and Canada since October, 1938, are shown m
Table 102. The rise in the average retail prices of specified commodities in St.
John* s since 1938 is shown in Table 103. To provide a more direct comparison of
current Newfoundland and Canadian prices, the average retail prices of a selected
list of foods in St. John's and Halifax are shown in Table 104.
102.. - Cost of Living Index Numbers - St. John's Newfoundland
: •• and Canada, October 1938 - February, 1949
(October 1938=100) : , .. •
Note. - The Canada cost-of-living index has been changed to an October, 1938
base for comparative purposes. This is a simple mechanical operation using pub-,
lished figures on the base 193 5-193 9=loo. A similar series for Halifax, Nova Scotia,
is available back to August, 193 9, which is the base period month for these figures.
This index was 102. 9 for October, 1939 and 152.1 for January, 1949. The St. John's
series covers approximately the same range of commodities and rents, as the
Canadian series but has a less complete coverage of service rates. Differences m
construction methods are also fairly considerable.

SECTION 11 - NATIONAL INCOME AND PUBLIC FINANCE
NATIONAL INCOME
Statistical data for Newfoundland are not complete enough to permit
estimates of national income and gross national product in the detail published
for Canada, However, available information makes it possible to prepare
tentative estimates of aggregate national income, The value of exports and
imports classified by commodity groups is known, These statistics are parti-
cularly valuable because foreign trade is so important in the Newfoundland
economy., In addition, some information is available from the 193 5 and 1945
Censuses, Government revenues and expenditures are shown in Newfound-
land's Public Accounts, Miscellaneous information collected from time to
time for administrative purposes by various government boards and com-
missions also sheds some light on the problem as does the data relating to
expenditure on war installations in Newfoundland by Canada and the United
States,
Two independent estimates have been made of net national income at
factor cost for the year 1 945,utilizing the above-mentioned sources, and the
total by each method approximates $llO million. Income was somewhat lower
in 1947, following the decline in military spending in Newfoundland by the
United States and Canadian Governments, Preliminary estimates show
national income of $l2O million in 1948, the last year prior to union with
Canada, Because of the scarcity of statistical data the estimates given below
should be regarded as tentative. They will be revised if further information
becomes available,
Since changes in national income reflect price changes as well as
changes in real production, reference should be made to the preceding section
to assess the importance of the price factor in the estimates shown below.
Pre-war national income of Newfoundland (1936-39 average) has been esti-
mated at approximately $45 million, (See "Newfoundland, Economic, Diplo-
matic. and Strategic Studies", Appendix B), It should be noted that while the
estimates below are stated in dollars, the purchasing power of the dollar
was considerably less in Newfoundland than in Canada during the comparable
period. This is partly explained by the dependence of Newfoundland on
imported goods subject to relatively high custom duties,
105, - Net National Income at. Factor Cost .


PUBLIC FINANCE
Government financing on the national level in Newfoundland
was associated with a series of budgetary deficits up to the fiscal year
1940-41 when the wartime stimulus of defence base construction caused
an upswing in government revenues which has continued up to the present.
Revenue for 1947-48 was $40.6 million, or more than three times the
figure for 1939-40. Expenditures increased to a lesser degree, the net
result being a series of seven years of surpluses amounting in all to
$25.2 million. Customs import duties have comprised a growing pro-
portion (about 55 p.c.) of total revenue, despite substantial reductions
in import duty rates. Income and excess profits taxes make up about
28 p.c. of the total revenue.
The successive surpluses have enabled the government to reduce
the public debt considerably, with a consequent saving on current expen-
diture for debt service, to expand health and welfare services, and to vote
larger sums for road and wharf construction and maintenance, despite
greatly increased costs of other essential services. Public health and
welfare expenditure increased by 88 p.c. from 1943-44 to 1947-48, public
works expenditure increased by 146 p.c., and education by 55 p.c.
/.part from the capital city of St. John's, there were, in 1948,
fourteen local incorporated municipalities in the Island. There are no
incorporated "rural areas" in Newfoundland corresponding to this type
of local government in the other provinces of Canada. In certain cases,
however, where several communities are contiguous or are too small to
support a local government, they have amalgamated and are incorporated
as "rural districts". The national government maintains liaison with
local governments through the Eocal Government Division of the Depart-
ment of Public Health and Welfare, and all municipal accounts are
audited by the national .Auditor General.
It is not possible to present complete information in each of the
following tables for a consistent series of years. However, the information
given covers the broader aspects of public finance and gives a general
idea of Newfoundland's financial situation during the post-war years
leading up to confederation with Canada.
