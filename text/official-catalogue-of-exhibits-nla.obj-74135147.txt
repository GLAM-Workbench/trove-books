Although the days when every bucketful of washdirt was supposed
to contain sufficient gold to remunerate the miner for the voyage from
Europe to Australia are past, and the rich alluviums of the early gold-
digging era are almost ended, the production of the precious metal still
continues among the first of Australian industries. Quartz-reefing has
taken the place of alluvial digging, deep sinking has superseded surfac-
ing and paddocking, and the pick and shovel are supplemented by costly
machinery and scientific appliances. Of course the production of gold
from great depths entails a much greater expense than it did in former
times, but once found the returns are larger, and last most certainly for
much longer periods. As an instance of this may be mentioned the Long
Tunnel Company, Walhalla, which, for nearly seven years, has steadily
been paying dividends that represent a large interest for the capital
expended in the purchase of shares. Attention has been turned to the
other mineral wealth of Australia, and she bids fair to become promi-
nent amongst mineral producing countries, with Victorian gold and
New South Wales coal, South Australian copper and the various


mineral riches of Queensland, Tasmanian ironstone and tin, and
Western Australian lead. The intention of this essay is to review
shortly the mineral resources of Victoria.
GOLD.
The total area of the auriferous and quartz ground actually opened up
is 1063 square miles, and the number of distinct quartz reefs known to
he auriferous is 3398. From the commencement of the publication of
statistics relative to the yield of gold, up to the 31st of December, 1874,
the amount of vein quartz crushed has been 11,441,638 tons 6 cwt.; the
yield of gold therefrom has been 6,447,640 oz. 6 dwts., or an aveiage
of 11 dwts. 6-49 grs. per ton. During the eleven years ending 3let of
December, 1874, the quantities of tailings, mullock, &c., treated were
1 663 033 tons, which yielded 299,117 oz. 4 dwts. 2 grs. of gold, or an
average of 3 dwts. 14-33 grs. per ton. During the six years ending
31st of December, 1874, the quantities of pyrites, blanketings, &c.,
operated on were 25,445 tons 4 cwt., yielding 70,551 oz. 0 dwts. 14
oh, or an average of 2 oz. 15 dwts. 10-88 grs. per ton. It was only m
the?year 1860 that the treatment of these stuffs was commenced.
Statistics show, during the past two years and nine months (the time
attention has been turned to washdirt), that 3,351,467 tons 7 cwt.
yielded 214,767 oz. 10 dwts. 12 grs. of gold, or an average of 1 dwt.
6 "76 grs. per ton.
The vield of gold in the year 1874 from 967,069 tons 9 cwt. of quartz
was 573,220 0z.�17'5 dwts., or an average of 11 dwts. 20-21 grs.; from
?69 439 tons of quartz tailings and mullock the yield was 6866 oz. 11
<lwts. 10 grs., or an average of 2 oz. 16 dwts. 7-82 grs. per ton; from
?6725 tons of pyrites and blanketings the yield was 18,941 oz. 14 dwts.
13 grs , or an average of 2 oz. 16 dwts. i "82 grs. per ton.
As compared with 1873, there is a small decrease in the quantities of
vein quartz treated, but the gross quantity of gold obtained from vein
quartz in 1874 was 6006 oz. 10 dwts. 3 grs. in excess of that got in the
year 1873 During the past five years there has been a gradual increase
in the quantities of gold obtained from vein quartz, and the average
yield per ton in 1874, notwithstanding that much of the quartz is now
-extracted from levels at great depths, is . ,
Duriiv the year 1874 there was a great increase in the quantities of
-quartz tailings. The quantity of quartz tailings treated in 1874 shows,
as compared with the quantity treated in 18/3, an inciease of 44,052
tons, and the yield shows an increase of 3986 oz. 11 dwts. 5 grs. The
amount of pyrites and blanketing?s treated in 18/4 exceeded that
operated upon in 1873 by 1157 tons 15 cwt., and the yield of 1874
exceeded that of the previous year by 3053 oz. 16 dwts. 5 grs.
It is evident that very great attention is now being given to the vast
heaps of tailings, &c., that accumulated when the methods of extracting
o-old were not so efficient as at the present time. But the mineral
?statistics of Victoria for the year 1874 point out, that as quartz from
the mine is now being treated, quartz tailings and waste products
except those that abound in auriferous pyrites?are not likely to give
profitable results by any methods known at present. Nearly all the


old heaps will, however, well repay the miner if skill and economy be
used.
The quantity of washdirt puddled or sluiced during the year 1874
has been computed at 1,037,345 tons, the yield of gold therefrom being
54,725 oz. 18 dwts. 7 grs., or an average of 1 dwt. 6-76 grs. per ton.
The quantity of cement crushed during the year 1874 is set down at
85,010 tons, the yield of gold therefrom being 8789 oz. 9 dwts. 8 grs.,
or an average of 5 dwts. 0-50 grs. per ton. There is a decrease in the
quantity treated in 1874, as compared with that treated in 1873, of
41,041 tons, and also a decrease in the yield of 6136 oz. 7 dwts. 22 grs.
The number of miners employed in Victoria on the 31st of December,
1874, was 45,151, of whom 32,971 were Europeans and 12,180 Chinese.
The number of quartz miners was 14,473, and the number of alluvial
miners was 30,678.
The decrease in the mean number of miners employed during the year
1874 as compared with 1873 is 5545, and as compared with 1872
8147. Referring to this decrease the Secretary for Mines states;?
? The withdrawal of such large bodies of men from an occupation that
on the whole gives good returns for the labour bestowed on it, is the
cause of the great reduction in the produce of gold. While the average
earnings per man per annum continue to increase, the numbers
engaged in gold mining decrease, and if there were not great induce-
ments held out to miners to abandon mining operations, the yield of
gold, instead of falling off, would now be greater than in former years.
The miners have now better machinery and better appliances for saving
gold than they ever had, and yet they are leaving the mines in order to
engage in other pursuits. During the past nine years there has been an
increase of 33,523 in the number of persons engaged in farming,
manufactories, &c., and there has during the same period been a decrease
of 27,065 in tbe number of gold miners.?
The total gold exported and minted during the year 1874 amounted
to 1,155,971 oz. 19 dwts., and the value of this quantity divided
amongst the mean number of miners employed throughout the year will
give an average of �99 Bs. 3?o7d. per man. There has been no higher
average than this during the past eighteen years, except in 1868, when
the quantity of gold exported was 1,657,498 oz., and the average per
man for the year was �lO4 18s. 8 - 75 d.
The gross weight of rough gold received at the Melbourne branch of
the Royal Mint during 1874 was 29,391-54 oz., and the gross weight of
gold bullion was 222,426-41 oz. The amount of gold exported during
the year 1874, as returned by the Customs department, was 904,154 oz.
The lowest price of gold per ounce for the quarter ending 31st
December, 1874, was �3, and the highest during the same period was
�4 3s.
The lowest price charged per ton for crushing quartz and cement
during the quarter ending 31st December, 1874, was 25., and the highest
�1 Bs.
The approximate value of all machinery and appliances in use on the
several gold-fields for the year 1874 was �2,078,936.
The number of gold-mining leases in force on the 31st of De-


cember, 1874, was 1996, and the extent of the ground leased was
26,601 a. lr. 33|p.; while the number of gold-mining leases issued in the
year 1874 was 577, and the extent of the ground leased 9955 a. Ox-. 16|p.
The estimated value of claims and leased lands in the sevex-al mining
disti'icts on the 31st of December, 1874, was .�7,424,024, and the
revenue directly derived from the gold-fields during 1874, as compiled
from the Treasury statements of revenue, Arc., amounted to �23,089 2s. 7d.
Many of the quartz-mines ax-e now worked at great depths; and there
is, as far as caxx be gathered from the returns, no diminution in the
yield of gold in the deeper levels. There is one shaft at Stawell,
Magdala mine, over 1600 feet in depth, one 1420 feet, one 1260, and
two more than 1000 feet in depth.
From the deeper levels in these mines the quartz has yielded as
much as 3 oz. 9 dwts. 2 gx-s. per ton.
At Chines one shaft is 1012 feet deep, and another 1005 feet; at
Sandhurst one shaft is nearly 900 feet deep, and there are four exceeding
800 feet, and one exceeding 700. The yield from these deep mines at
Sandhurst at the deepest levels varies from 12 dwts. 22 gx-s. per ton to
1 oz. 2 dwts. 6 grs, per ton.
SILVER.
The total amount of silver raised in Victoria from ox-e is 12,468 oz., of
which 180 oz. were raised in 1874. The total quantity of silver that
has been obtained in Victoria is 36,625 oz. 15 dwts., of which 760 oz.
was raised in 1874, and 11,146 oz. was extracted at the Mint. The
total expoi?t of silver ore has been 10 oz. 6 dwts,, and the total export
of silver 16,368 oz. 6 dwts.
The largest yield of silver during 1874 from one mine is 276 oz.,
representing a value of �69. This was obtained at Wilson?s Hill in
the St. Arnaud district. The next large yield was from Crysolite Hill,
St. Arnaud, and was 68 oz., representing a value of �l9.
During 1874, as stated before, 11,146 oz. 5 dwts. of silver were
extracted from gold at the Melbourne branch of the Royal Mint, which,
at the current rate of ss. per ounce, gives a money value of �2786 11s.
The quantity of silver sold by the Mint during the same period was
10,560-28, thus leaving in the Mint 585-95 oz. not disposed of. Aboxxt
6000 oz. of Victorian silver found its way into the hands of the
manufacturing silversmiths, and was used by them in the business of
their trade, while about 3000 oz. were bought by those dealers who
manufacture the ingredients used by photographers, of which silver is
a component part.
There were three silver-mining leases in foi-ce at the end of 1874,
covering an ax-ea of 380 a. lr. 17p.; two leases were issued over an- area
of 605 a. 32p.
IRON.
Since the discovery of gold up to the 31st December, 1874, about
182 tons of iron ox-e have beexx raised in Victoi?ia, of which 130 tons
were raised dining the year 1874. Samples have been received, fox-
analysis, of brown iroxx froxxx Daylesford, browxx ironstone from Traral-
goxx Creek, Gippsland, axxd froxn Lake Tyei?s, Gippsland, mixed hematite


and brown iron ore from Wilson?s Promontory, and micaceous iron ore
from the Grampian Mountains. These ores contain from 26 to 72 per
cent, of iron. The only experiment made during 1874 was with iron
ore found at Limestone Gully, between Newstead and Sandy Creek.
About half a ton of ore was smelted, and yielded 55 per cent, of iron.
This is the iron of commerce, or grey iron, which, being soft and ductile,
is suitable for the manufacture of castings, columns, bronze and white-
smith?s work. It is estimated by those who have visited the two lodes
that over 50,000 tons could be easily obtained for smelting. As yet no
sufficient quantity of Victorian iron has been smelted to allow of the
metal being used for manufacturing purposes. English capitalists have
however turned their attention to Victorian iron, and at their request
have been furnished with samples of the various iron ores discovered in
the colony, accompanied with a description of the various localities and
the distances of the deposits from railway communication with Mel-
bourne. An extensive iron mine exists in the Ballarat district at Lal-
Lal. Excavations have been made to prove the lode, a furnace has been
erected, and the machinery is nearly completed. Beds have been made
for the iron, buildings have been put up, and the owners of the mine
expect shortly to commence active operations.
During 1874 the number of men engaged in mining for Aon was 27.
One lease to mine for iron was in force on 31st December, 1874, extending
over an area of about 46 acres, and another over an area of 320 acres.
About 30 tons of red ochreous clay have, since March, 1874, been raised
near Bendigo, and a quantity of the clay has been sent to England
in order to ascertain tiie value of the prepared red ochre of commerce,
and the value of the raw material in the English market. Information
respecting the nature and cost of the necessary and suitable machi-
nery for manufacturing the clay on the ground held under lease, and the
ruling prices in the English, Continental and Indian markets, with
statistics relative to home consumption, have been sought for.
COPPER.
Previously to the 31st of December, 1873, about 1255 tons of copper
ore were raised in Victoria, and up to the same date 31 tons 10 cwt.
were smelted, which at �ll2 per ton would give �3511. About 70
tons of regulus brought �1969.
During 1874 no copper ore was raised. Samples of copper ore from
Snowy Creek, Gippsland, from the ranges between Koetong and Bright,
Ovens district, and from a locality only three miles from Melbourne have
been subjected to analysis, and were found to contain from 25 to 90 per
cent, of copper. During 1874 the number of men engaged in mining
for copper was 21,
One lease was in force at the end of 1874 to mine for copper ore over an
area of 625 acres.
TIN.
The tin ore of Victoria promises to become a permanent source of
wealth to the colony.


The value of the tin ore raised up to the end of 1874 was estimated at
.�325,847. During 1874, 290 tons 2 cwt. of black sand, valued at
�16,333, were raised, of which 112 tons were exported, 152 tons were
smelted in the colony, of which 49 tons 2 cwt. were shipped to England,
and 103 tons 2- cwt. were consumed in Victoria. The smelting of Victorian
tin is confined to the Ovens district, the principal smelters being the Wel-
lington Co., El Dorado; W. G. Hensley, Eeed?s Creek; Ah Moy, Reed?s
Creek, and Tien Sing. The testimony of those trades that are accus-
tomed to use tin plates preponderates in favour of the Victorian material.
These plates are chiefly used for solder, the manufacture of which requires
160 lbs. of the best English tin to every 100 lbs. of lead, while 100 lbs. of
Victorian tin will take from 104 lbs. to 105 lbs. of lead. The wholesale
dealers and the trade consumers praise the block-tin prepared by the
Chinese smelters. One Melbourne firm of tinsmiths used during 1874
about 22 tons Victorian tin in the manufacture of solder, which at the
average price paid per lb. represents an outlay of �2420; another firm
consumed about 20 tons, for which they paid from 9d. to Is. per lb.
The Eldorado sand yields 73 per cent, of tin, the Ovens sand 30 to 71
per cent., and the Koetong sand 65 to 72 per cent.
Twelve leases to mine for tin were in force at the end of 1874, extend-
ing over an area of 961 acres. Eight leases, extending over an area of
234 acres, were issued during the same year, and 14 leases to search for
tin, extending over an area of 1824 acres, were issued. It occurs both as
stream and lode tin, but is mainly worked as the former at present.
LEAD.
Up to the end of 1874, the quantity of lead ore raised in Victoria
amounted to 518 tons, representing a money value of �4200, of which
111 tons, valued at �lllO, were raised during 1873. Up to the end of
December, 1874, about 67 tons of lead ore have been exported. Experi-
ments in smelting have not been successful. Early in 1874 a trial
smelting of two tons of lead from Murrindal, Gippsland, was made in
Melbourne, and a yield of 60 per cent, of lead was obtained, the metal
being valued at �22 10s. per ton. The cost of the transit of the ore
from the mine, and the cost of treatment combined, left no margin,
however, for profit, and further experiments were for the time abandoned.
The owners of the Murrindal mine, after erecting a Spanish reverbera-
tory furnace, and also a Flintshire furnace, found they could not over-
come the difficulty of separating the lead from the sulphur and antimony
which form component parts of the ore. A manager skilled in the treat-
ment of lead ore has been sent for to England, and, as there are large
quantities of the ore in the claim, the owners, on his arrival, hope to
make the ore of marketable value.
During 1864 six men were employed in the Murrindal and Buchan
Mines.
Two leases were in force to mine for lead at the end of 1874, over 605
acres.
Iron, Copper, Tin, and Lead, viewed as materials, will be more-
especially referred to in Juries 17, 18, 19.


ANTIMONY.
The total amount of antimony ore that has been raised in the colony
is 11,198 tons 4 cwt. 3 qrs. 9 lbs., representing a value of �80,870. Of
this quantity 588 tons, valued at �4707, were raised during the year
1874. The total amount exported is?antimony ore, 8061 tons 9 cwt.;
antimony regulus, 502 tons 5 cwt.; antimony, 430 tons 1 cwt. Of this
quantity 224 tons 7 cwt. antimony ore, and 231 tons antimony regulus,
were exported during the year 1874. Ore containing 60 per cent, ot
antimony brought, in London, from �l2 to �l2 15s. per ton, and
star regulus maintained as high a price as �53 per ton. About 234 tons
of antimony ore were treated in the colony during 1874.
There are four antimony smelting works in Victoria, one of which
employs steam power. The number of hands employed is 64. The
value of the plant is estimated at �3900, that of the land �ll5O, and
that of the buildings �2900. There is only one firm that does anything
considerable in antimony smelting, and a great part of the ore treated
by them is imported from Queensland. One of the smaller firms treated
17 tons 10 cwt. of ore, consisting of mixed lots, in 1874. Another
treated about 38 tons and obtained a yield of 22 tons of regulus, the
market value of which was �42 per ton; and a third obtained from 50
tons of ore about 20 tons of regulus.
The localities in which the ore is principally raised are Eingwood and
Costerfield.
Sulphide of antimony from Eingwood yielded, upon analysis, 65 per
cent, of antimony, and another sample 60 per cent. Sulphide of antimony
from Costerfield gave 45 per cent., and a sample from Whroo, on the
Goulburn, 65 per cent. Sulphide of antimony from Sandhurst gave 63
per cent. Oxide of antimony from Costerfield yielded 36 per cent.,
while a sample of sulphide of antimony with oxide, discovered 33 feet
below the surface at Eingwood, yielded, when assayed, 68-46 of
antimony.
BISMUTH.
A sample of nearly pure bismuth from Snowy Creek, Gippsland, was
received for analysis in 1874. The outer portions of the sample were
found to contain carbonate and oxide of bismuth, with ferruginous
clay. It contained no gold or silver. One licence to search for bismuth
over an area of 320 acres was issued during the year 1874.
COAL.
The total quantity of coal raised in Victoria is 5456 tons 8 cwt.,
valued at �8233. During 1874, about 2909 tons were raised, valued at
�4363. Of this amount, 2879 tons were raised in the mine of the
Western Port Coal Mining Company, and nearly the whole of the
quantity raised was forwarded to Melbourne and disposed of at market
prices. Five seams of coal, varying from 9 inches to 4 feet in thickness,
were opened on a lease at Eosedale. At Griffith?s Point the coal has not
yet been reached, though the shaft has been sunk some 250 feet. In
the mine of the Kilcunda Association, a shaft about 250 feet deep
has penetrated through clay, blue sandstone, and small riders of coal,
half an inch to three inches in width.


Several parties have been prospecting for coal in Gippsland, and good
indications have, it is said, been found on tlie La Trobe River.
It was reported that wbat was described as a valuable seam of coal
had been discovered at Lang Lang, South Gippsland. The coal deposit
is about seven miles from the proposed Gippsland railway line, and is
sixty-five miles from Melbourne. The seam at Lang Lang is stated to
be about two feet thick at a very short distance from the outcrop.
Towards the end of 1874, a landslip in the Wannon Valley exposed the
lay of the strata. Some ten feet from the surface there cropped out
what appeared to be a seam of coal four feet in thickness. The mineral
was found to burn with a smouldering heat like peat.
There were eighteen leases in force at the end of 1864, extending over
an area of 9412 acres; two leases to mine for coal, extending over 1280
acres, and twenty-one leases to search for coal, over an area of 11,363
acres, were issued during 1874.
LIGNITE.
The total quantity of lignite raised is 3500 tons, representing a value
of �2120. In 1874, 750 tons were raised, which, being valued at ss.
per ton, realised �lB7. The lignite is found to answer well as fuel for
steam engines, it throws out a good heat, and is economical. One reason
that it does not find more favour with those in charge of engines is that,
although the hard work at intervals when using coal as fuel is not
required, the furnaces need more continuous attention being paid to them.
When the lignite is compressed into bricks, as is done in Germany,
where it is extensively used, it can be used with very little trouble. The
owners of the mine intend importing machinery for compressing the
lignite into bricks. The principal places of occurrence are Lai Lai, near
Ballarat, and Cross-over Creek, near the line of railway to Gippsland.
The former bed is said to be about 120 feet in thickness, and that at
Cross-over 80 feet.
The mines of silver, tin, copper, lead, antimony, iron, coal, and lignite
give employment to 388 miners.
CLAYS.
The total amount of kaolin raised in Victoria is estimated at 1832
tons, representing a money value of �7444, twenty-five tons of which
have been exported. No kaolin was raised in 1874.
There are in Victoria 296 brickyards and potteries, in which 1271
hands are employed. The number of machines used are, for tempering
or crushing the clay 184, for making bricks or pottery 77. The approxi-
mate total value of the bricks is �164,266; pottery �24,822; machinery
and plant �45,785; buildings �53,858, and the land used in connection
with this industry �52,251. The number of bricks made in 1874 was
83,337,000, The general average of the working hours is nine, and the
value of the goods produced during the year 1874 may be set down at
�71,158. Wages average for men �2 2s. per week; boys, from 6s. to
�l.


The largest brick manufactory employs 100 hands, and the wholesale
?value of manufactures produced in 1874 was �30,000.
Another manufactory for bricks and tiles gives employment to 22
hands, whose average hours of work ax*e eight. The value of the manu-
factures produced in 1874 was �6500.
The largest pottery and drain pipe manufactory gives employment to
25 hands, who work eight hours a day. The wholesale value of the
manufactories in 1874 amounted to �lO,OOO.
A manufactory of pottery and glazed pipes employs 31 hands, who
work nine hours per day. The wholesale value of the manufactures in
1874 was �5OOO.
The largest manufactory for drain pipes alone employs 11 hands,
and the wholesale value of its manufactures in 1874 was <�5200.
For pottery, stone-ware and terra-cotta the largest works give employ-
ment to 13 hands, the working hours being eight per day. The whole-
sale value of the manufactures in 1874 was �4OOO.
There is one factory of red ware, the wholesale value of the goods
produced in 1874 being <�1560.
A sample of black shale found at Ballarat has been analysed. It
somewhat resembles plumbago. Upon being heated in an ordinary flame
the carbon in the shale burns readily, leaving a voluminous white ash
which fuses at a high temperature. The softer parts of the shale might
be used for the manufactures of crayons, or perhaps soft pencils.
CEMENT.
There are in Victoria two establishments for the manufacture of
cement,, one of which uses steam to the extent of 60 horse power.
Thirty-four males and one female are employed, and the value of the
machinery and plant is �5300.
LIMESTONE.
The limestone found at Limeburner?s Point and the Duck Ponds, near
Geelong, gives employment to 27 limekilns, in which 182 hands are
-employed. The machinery and plant is valued at �4027, the land �2122,
and the buildings at �1755.
The most extensive of these kilns gives employment to 50 men, who
work from eight to ten hours a day; the value of the lime manufactured
in 1874 was �lO,OOO. Another employs 13 men, working ten hours a day,
the value of the lime produced in 1874 being �1633. A third employs ten
men, working ten hours a day, and the value of the lime manufactured in
1874 was �l6O, During 1874 eight to ten tons of limestone found near
Moorabool have been used. It is valued at from 355. to 40s. per ton,
and is admirably suited for the manufacture of Alters. Several hundred
tons of Waurn Ponds limestone were used for building purposes. It is
found to resist climatic effects, and to harden by exposure to the air. Its
price is from 355. to 40s, per ton.
FLAGGING AND SLATE.
The total value of the flagging hitherto raised in Victoria is �35,629.
In 1874 the quantity of flagging raised was 1961 tons, valued at �2941.


Nearly all the flagging comes from Castlemaine and its neighbourhood,,
and is suitable for monumental purposes, hearthstones, footpaths, and
coreing.
MARBLE.
A discovery of a superior marble has been made at Waratah Bay,
commencing just north of the Bird Rock, about 44 miles to the north of
Cape Liptrap. In lateral extent the outcrop is rather limited, being
confined to the steep face of the shore escarpment, that is, from high
water mark for about 4 chains west, up to near the top of the escarp-
ment, where a ferruginous sandstone, as it seems, conformably overlies
it. North, beyond the cliff, succeed bluish gray shales and thinly-
bedded sandstones. In the south the marble appears to be suddenly cut
oft? by a broad dyke of an intrusive rock, which at the surface disinte-
grates to a highly ferruginous soil, interspersed with occasional lumps of
a vexy fine brown iron oi'e. Its texture is crystalline-gi'anular, varying
from fine to coarse grained, and it assumes in places (more especially at
the base of the bluff), the chai'acter of black and white mottled and veined
marble, suitable for chimney-pieces and other ornamental building woi?k.
A company is in course of formation to work this valuable deposit.
There ai?e 17 marble and stone works in Victoria, givixxg employ-
ment to 126 hands. The value of the total plant is �3275; of the land,
�14,195; and of the buildings, �3145. The largest marble and stone
works employ 20 hands, working eight hours a day; the wholesale value
of the manufactures in 1874 was �6OOO. Another employs 15 hands;
the hours of woi?k ai?e eight hours per day, and the wholesale value of
the work turned out in 1874 was �2200.
A manufactory at which the chief work is of a monumental chai?acter
gives employment to 15 men, who work eight hours a day. The whole-
sale value of the manufactures in 1874 was �5OOO.
An establishment for enamelling slate mantelpieces gives employment
to 16 hands, working eight hours per day. The wholesale value of the
work done in 1874 was �l5OO.
There are three stone-breaking works, which find employment for 90
hands. The total value of the plant is �6500; of the land, �200; and
of the buildings, �7OO.
There are six establishments at which stone-sawing and polishing
are carried on, in four of which steam-power is used. Employment is
given to 139 hands. The total value of the plant is �13,800; of the
land, �6100; of the buildings, �5400.
One establishment for polishing granite and Milestone employs 19
hands, and the value of the work turned out in 1874 was �3lOO.
Marbles at present unworked, but suitable for ornamental purposes,
are found at Lilydale and Yering, on the Yarra; at Mansfield and at
Geelong. A very fine shell marble occurs near Maude, in the Moora-
bool valley. The largest deposits of limestone in Victoria are found in
Gippsland, at Buchan and Bindi, covering many square miles of
country. They are of Devonian age, of a dense crystalline character,
and nearly black colour. The lead lodes of Buchan and Murrindal occur
in these rocks.


GLASS.
During the last few years the manufacture of glass has been gradually
developing into a permanent industry, and it could have become still,
more extended in its operations were it not for the difficulty of obtaining,
skilled workmen, who all, until lately, had to be imported from Europe.
Under the head of glass manufactories are included flint glass, looking
glass, and glass bottles. There are in Victoria five factories, three for
flint glass and two for the manufacture of looking glass, and the aggre-
gate number of hands employed is 87. The total value of goods pro-
duced during the year 1874 was �25,400. The wages of glass-blowers
average �4 per week; labourers, �2 10s.; and boys from 6s. to 15s. The
hours of work vary from eight to nine hours per day.
The largest factory for glass bottles employs 29 men and 14 boys, and
the wholesale value of the goods produced in 1874 amounted to about
�10,400.
The largest flint glass manufactory gives employment to 21 hands,
viz., 9 men and 12 boys. During the year 18/4 the wholesale value ot
the goods produced was �2OOO.
The most prominent of the looking glass factories gives employment
to 10 men, who earn on an average �3 per week each. The wholesale
value of the goods produced in 1874 amounted to �lO,OOO.
INFUSORIAL EARTH.
Attention has been turned to infusorial earth, in the Amherst district
of the Maryborough Mining Division, of a most superior qualityand
it has also been found at Sailor?s Creek, Sebastopol, and Spring Plains.
DIAMONDS.
The total number of diamonds found in Victoria is 104, valued at
�1 each, four of which were found in 1874.
SAPPHIRES, ZIRCONS, GARNETS, TOPAZ.
These stones are principally found at Eldorado, the Woolshed, and Pilot
Creek in the Beechworth district. During'the year 1874, the following
Victorian gem stones were cut by Messrs. Spink and Son, Melbourne: ?
Sapphires, from Beechworth and Gippsland, 12; Rubies, from Gippsland,
12; Topazes, from Beechworth and Gippsland, 100; Zircons, 40; Mala-
chite, from Gippsland, 20; Garnets, 6; Agates, 30; Crystallized

PERFUMERY.
The extraction of the scent from flowers by distillation, and the French
enjleurage process, are only canned on in the colony of Victoria by one
manufacturer," who has a laboratory in Melbourne. Considering how


rich we are in the article of sweet-scented flowers and leaves, it seems
somewhat remarkable that there should be only one expert devoting
himself to a branch of industry supplying an article so universally in
demand.
The reason may perhaps be found in the fact that flower farming
must be carried on to a large extent before perfumers can obtain their
material in sufficient quantity, and considerable capital is required
before floriculture can be made a lucrative business. The perfumer in
question uses only native flowers in his business, and last summer pur-
chased about half a ton of rose petals, which he distilled or salted down
for future use.
Roses are most useful in scent-making, as they are hardy, and will
impart their scent to water, fat, or spirit. Most of the roses in the
Melbourne market come from Northcote, whilst Heathcote and Geelong
send in the greatest quantity of lavender. Tuber roses, jessamine, and
violets are the most delicate flowers the perfumer has to handle, and
their odour is extracted by the enfleuraye process, which consists in pack-
ing the fresh petals between glass plates coated with carefully prepared
lard. The plates are laid in airtight boxes, and when the lard is suffi-
ciently loaded with scent it becomes an article of commerce.
The price at which odoriferous blossoms can be bought in Melbourne
may be thus tabulated: ?
s. d.
Ordinary roses ... ... ... ... 0 3 per lb.
Lavender, about... ... ... ... 0 2 ?
Orange blossoms... ... ... ??? 2 6 ?
Violets ... ... ... ... 2 6 ?
Jessamine ... ... ... ... 2 6
The tuber rose is so rare that a price can not be fixed to it.
TOBACCO.
There were in Victoria, at the close of the year 1874, 12 tobacco,
cigar, and snuff manufactories, giving employment to 399 men and 11
females. Four of the factories use steam-power. It is estimated that in
Melbourne alone some 200 working hands are employed in cigar-making,
and men?s wages average from �1 10s. to �2 a week; boys and young
persons earn from 4s. to 20s. per week. The hours of labour in the trade
average eight. From returns that have been sent to the Commissioners,
thi?ee tobacco manufacturers produced during the past year goods to the
value of �33,280. In these three establishments 68 men and 66 young
persons earn a living. For the year ending March, 1875, 6839 cwt.
of tobacco were produced, and 733 acres were under cultivation.
SUGAR REFINING.
There were two Victorian sugar refineries, both of which employ steam
to the extent of 610 horse-power, and give employment to 270 men. The
value of the plant and machinery used is �80,000; of the land upon
which the refineries are erected, �8000; and of the buildings, �75,000.


A short time ago, the Victoria Sugar Company?s works at Sandridge
caught fire, and at present the bare walls alone remain. The proprietary
of the destroyed sugar refinery are now carrying on its business at the
Yarraville works, which have passed into their hands.
CHEMICAL WORKS.
Of chemical works the colony possesses eight, three of which are
worked by steam. They employ 41 hands. The machinery and plant
is valued at �8100; the land covered by these mills is worth �3500;
and the buildings, �5710, The Commissioners have received returns
from the owners of chemical works, showing that the aggregate value of
merchandise turned out last year was about �40,000. The hands em-
ployed in the works from which returns have come in number 17 men, 5
women, and 3 yOung people, and the wages earned range from �1 16s. a
week to �3 for men, 15s. for women, and 10s. for young persons. The
articles produced in these factories include sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic
acids, soft soap, sheepdip, &c.; they also prepare chemicals and drugs
generally.
SALT.
There are five salt works in the colony, employing 29 hands.
FERTILISING COMPOUNDS.
For the manufacture of bone-dust, and artificial manures made there-
from, fourteen steam-mills are at work. The horsepower of the united
engines is 170, and 121 men are employed in the works. The value of
the plant is �10,635, the land �8055, and the buildings �11,775.
One factory turned out in 1874 bone-dust and animal guano worth
�20,500; and another, during the same period, ground bone-dust to the
value of �2OOO.
ESSENTIAL OILS.
The statistical returns for the year 1873-4 give four manufactories
producing essential oils. One of these distillers makes oil worth �ISOO
per annum, and employs eight men, who are paid at the rate of 355.
per week. The oil is mostly extracted from Eucalypti, which, in various
varieties, constitute our forests. The gum-trees of Australia are, as is
well known, rich in gums, oils, and essences, possessing valuable
medicinal and wound-healing properties, the value of which is beginning
to be fully recognised by the medical profession both here and in
Europe.
The pioneer in the manufacture of these essential oils is Mr. Bosisto,
M.P., of Richmond, who has devoted years to the pursuit, and by
bringing his large experience to bear, has been able to arrive at the
most satisfactory results. His chief products are:?Essential Oil from the
Eucalyptus globulus, or blue gum. This is an antiseptic stimulant and
anthelmintic. Eucalyptol, for inhalation in bronchial and throat affec-
tions. This is obtained from the essential oil, and is a homologue of


camphor. Eucalpytic Acid, ordinary strength and concentrated, a
volatile obtained by fractional distillation, most abundant in the blue
and red gum. Liquor Eucalypti Globuli, antiperiodic; this is a bitter
tonic, obtained from the leaves of the tree in an amorphous condition.
It is an ague remedy, and appears to counteract malaria without exerting
the prejudicial effects of quinine on the nervous system. Cigarettes,
made from blue-gum, are used as a disinfectant in bronchial and
asthmatic affections. Essential Oil made from the peppermint-gum;
this oil is known as the Eucalyptus Oil, and is employed in rheumatic
?affections and in the manufacture chiefly of perfumery, soaps, &c. It is
an agreeable and excellent disinfectant if mixed with sawdust in the
proportion of four ounces of oil to the bushel. Essential Oil from the
Mallee scrub, employed chiefly in the manufacture of oil and spirit
varnishes. Varnishes containing the oil in the place of spirit of
turpentine are said neither to bloom nor crack. Essential Oil from the
Mallee scrub is a perfect solvent of indiarubber. Potashes may be
-obtained from the Mallee scrub, after its volatile oil has been extracted.
Inspissated Juice of the Red-gum of Victoria, an astringent and tonic
?employed successfully in cases of dysentery and diarrhoea in the form of
syrup. Essential oils are also obtained from the messmate, apple tree,
white-gum, ironbark-gum, peach-gum, and the scented gum of Queens-
land. These oils will show the variety of aromas existing in the
Eucalypti. The Eucalypti, besides possessing those properties met with
ns general constituents of ligneous vegetation, possess a tannate gum
resin, a volatile acid, and a volatile oil of eucalyptic origin. The first
two are to be found in most parts of the tree, but the last-named only in
the leaves. The blue-gum yields a continued steady supply of oil
throughout the year; but when the tree is extra resiniferous the acid is
abundant and the oil small in quantity. The red-gum produces a very
small quantity of oil, but the volatile acid is very abundant, so much so
that the red-gum wood owes its aroma entirely to this acid. The iron-
bark supplies oil abundantly; but the leaf surface on each tree is small
in comparison with other species. Here the resin is so abundant that
the bark is everywhere studded with gum resin. It has been demon-
strated that the Eucalyptus oils absorb atmospheric oxygen, transforming
it into peroxide of hydrogen.
Amongst the products obtained by Mr. Bosisto from other indige-
nous trees and plants are Essential Oil from the bark of the native
Sassafras. This oil is said to exert a specific lowering influence on the
heart?s action; and also Antherospermine, an alkaloid obtained from the
bark, which also yields a volatile oil, very bitter. From the Musktree
is obtained a brilliant colour called soap-green. Resin is also obtained
in quantity from under the pines growing on ridges in the Mallee
?country. A resin is also obtained from the Grasstree of Australia.
This is soluble in spirit, and is of a deep amber colour, and is obtainable
in large quantities. It is employed in staining wood to imitate cedar.
Successful experiments have also been made with non-indigenous
plants and trees. Opium has been obtained from the Sleeping Poppy,
cultivated in Gippsland, and an Essential Oil has been distilled from the
English Peppermint, which likewise is cultivated in Gippsland.


CONFECTIONERY.
A good demand exists for Colonial Confectionery, and the skill shown
in its manufactux-e is considerable. There are six confectionery estab-
lishments in Victoria, five of which use steam-power. They give em-
ployment to 158 hands, 145 men and 13 women. The value of the
plant and machinery is �8750, of the land �3550, and of the buildings
�B7OO. The aggregate wholesale value of the manufactures produced
in 1874 amounted to �62,900. Some idea of the magnitude of this
industry will be gained when it is stated that one factory employs 47
hands?l 9 men, 6 women, and 22 young persons; the value of the
goods produced in 1874 being �26,000. In this establishment the men
work 9 hours, and the rest of the employes 8; the wages are?men 405.,
women 10s., young persons 7s. per week. A second establishment
turned out with 42 hands?2s men, 2 women, and 15 young persons?in
1874 goods to the value of �14,500. The working hours are 53 per
week, and the wages are?men 455., women 155,, young persons 12s. per
week. Another employs 36 hands?l 4 men, 2 women, and 20 young
persons, who work 10 hours per day, earning?men �3, women Bs.,
young persons 9s. per week. The wholesale value of the manufactures
produced in 1874 was �ll,OOO. The remaining factories employ hands
varying in number from 11 to 18, and wages average, for men, from �2
to �2 14s. per week. The wholesale value of the work turned out in
1874 ranged from �l2OO to �6OOO.
EXPLOSIVE COMPOUNDS.
There are in this colony four factories where blasting powder is made.
These give employment to thirteen people, who, on an average, earn
wages according to the following scale?men �2, women 155., and young
people 10s.
It is only natural that in a mining country where hard rock is preva-
le nt, the attention of chemists should be given to explosive compounds
The advance made by science of late years in Europe with respect to the
most powerful destructive force that can be packed in a small space, has
resulted in the manufacture of a large amount of explosive material that
can at present be imported and sold at so cheap a rate, notwithstanding
the danger of transit, as to give little encoui'agement to Axxstralians
who desire to compete with the home max?ket. We have close to
Melbourne a volcanite factory, where a rock-tearing compound, which
gives forth no smoke on explosion, is made, and in the manipulation of
this ax?ticle twelve persons are employed, at wages averagixxg from 10s. to
�2. The mill turns out per week three tons of volcanite, at �B4 per
toxx. Nitro-glycex?ine compouxxds ax*e being manufactured in the colony
xxpon a small scale.
Axx idea of the importance of this industry may be, however, to a cex-
tain extent axrived at when it is stated on soxxnd axxthoxdty that a manu-
factory, sitxxate on the bank of the YaiTa, turned oxxt dxxring the financial
year ending December, 1874, fuse, &c., valued at �9OOO. The wages in
this factory are per man �2, and boys 12s. The number of hands
employed is 19.


DYE WORKS.
The number of dye works in Victoria is 16. Three only use steam-
power, and the total number gives a means of living to 47 males and 36
females. These establishments occupy land valued at �6OOO, and have
plant worth �2805. The places of business are valued at �9060. The
value of the dyeing trade cannot be given here, as the Commissioners
have only been placed in possession of special information by one dyer,
who, with five assistants, realised by his work last year the satisfactory
sum of �1248. The colouring matter used in this trade is nearly all
imported.
VARNISHES, PAINTS, PIGMENTS, GUMS, AND RESINS.
There is only one wholesale establishment in the colony where var-
nishes, enamels, and paints are prepared, and in this workshop none
(with one exception) but imported materials are used. The exception
alluded to is white zinc, which can be made here from scraps, and
profitably.
The gentleman who has provided the Commissioners with information
relative to this branch of trade has invented a patent composition for
coating the bottoms of iron ships, and the preparation is most favourably
spoken of by nautical men. The Cerberus is coated with the enamel in
question, and her commander, Captain Pan ter, R.N., has publicly stated
that he thinks it the best he has seen out here. This manufacturer
employs 10 skilled artizans, who can earn per week from �2 10s. up to
�6; exports to the several Australian colonies yearly ship-coating enamel
to the value of about �2000; and also does a large trade in prepared
colours and carriage varnishes.
VINEGAR, INK, AND BLACKING.
We have in the colony three vinegar works, employing 10 persons.
The value of the plant and machinery in these is �l5OO, and the build-
ings where the industry is carried on are worth about the same amount.
The Commissioners have been put in possession of data showing that the
three factories produced in 1874 vinegar to the value of about �4OOO
wholesale.
Two manufacturers in Victoria who combine vinegar-brewing with ink
and blacking making, give �11,388 as the result of their labour for year
ending December, 1874. These two employers give work to 16 persons,
whose wages range from 10s. to �4 per week. It should here be
stated that the total number of ink and blacking factories in the colony
is 7, in which 56 persons are engaged. Two of these are worked by
steam.

The districts in Australia in which the Vine has been cultivated, or in
which Wine-making forms an industry of any extent, are well represented
in the Exhibition, both as to the number and variety of samples. There
are 270 exhibits, 155 of which are from Victoria, 68 from South Aus-
tralia, and 47 from New South Wales. The wines are divided into
Light White Wine, Light Red Wine, Full-bodied White and Full-bodied
Red.
Some idea of the growth of wine culture in Victoria may be gathered
from the fact that the number of vines in the entire colony in the year
ended March 31st, was 8,545,364. From these were gathered 19,999
cwt. of grapes, which were not made into wine, as against 20,372
cwt. in 1874. The quantity made into wine and brandy was 90,988
cwt., as against 85,279 cwt. in 1874, showing an increase of 5709
cwt. The total produce of the vines for 1875 is thus set down at
110,987 cwt., as against 105,650 cwt. in 1874, or an increase of 5337
cwt. The quantity of wine produced for the year ending March, 1875,
was 577,493 gallons, and for the year 1874, 562,713 gallons, showing an
increase in favour of 1875 of 14,780 gallons. Brandy in 1875 was
manufactured to the extent of 148 gallons, which shows an increase over
that manufactured the preceding year by 48 gallons. It is to be borne
in mind with reference to the returns of vines, that whilst the number of
vines are for the year ending March 31st, 1875, the quantity of grapes
gathered, and of wine and brandy made, are for the previous season.
The grape crop comes too late to admit of its being returned when the
statistics for the yearly agricultural return are collected. At the end of
March, 1875, the extent of land taken up with vines was 3510 acres.
As stated before, Victoria contributes to the Exhibition 155 exhibits
of wine. The district of Ararat is represented by two growers, Messrs.
Trouette and Blampied, and Mr. J. Best, the former of whom have twelve
exhibits, and the latter two. From Beechworth four growers are repre-
sented, of whom Messrs. F. G, and J. B. Docker are the largest exhibi-
tors, with nine exhibits. Six vineyards in the Castlemaine district con-
tribute samples of their produce, the largest number of exhibits shown
by one grower being four, the grower being Mr. Carl Jung. Echuca is
worthily represented by Mr. J. Vettler, who sends twelve exhibits.
Geelong is represented by five exhibitors, the largest of whom is Mr. C.
Buchanan, who shows three exhibits.
From the Goulburn vineyards there are four samples, the Tabilk vineyard


heading the list with four exhibits. Mr. G. S. Smith represents
Wahgunyah, and Mr. George Spink Tarrawingee. The Melbourne
district is well represented by nine growers, of whom Mr. H. de Castella
is the largest exhibitor ; this gentleman has sent six exhibits. Sandhurst
is represented by eleven growers, of whom Mr. Carl Pohl takes the
lead with twelve exhibits.
The number of samples exhibited are divided into about thirty varieties
of wine, the most common being Hermitage, Burgundy, Eiesling, Yer-
deilho and Chasselas. The rarer occurring varieties are?Malvoisie,
Esparte, Pineau, Roussette, Muscatel, Tokay, Aucarot, Ugni blanc and
Leverdun (Gloria of Australia).
The great complaint that has hitherto existed against Victorian wine
was its newness. This arose from the fact that the manufacturers could
with few exceptions afford to keep a large stock on hand, and were
obliged to sell to the dealers, who in their turn were averse to seeing the
capital invested lying idle for any length of time. This will seem now
in a great measure to have been got rid of, for on looking over the
returns of the exhibits, it will be found that the Ararat growers exhibit
mixed white and Hermitage four years old, Burgundy four years old,
Chasselas and Riesling three-quarter, Muscatel one-quarter, seven years old,
Riesling, white Nice and mixed grapes, five years old. Amongst the
Beechworth exhibits will be found Riesling, seven and five years;
Shiraz, six and five years, and Yei?deilho four years old; Castlemaine
Hermitage is five and four years old; Burgundy six years; Riesling,
Black Cluster, and Roussette four years old. From Echuca we
have Little Riesling sherry and Carbinet and Sauvignon four years old;
Hermitage, Grenache, Burgundy and Carbinet five years old. Amongst
the exhibits from the Melbourne district are Mataro, Hermitage, Riesling
and Yerdeilho four years old; Gouais five years old, and Hermitage six
years old; Riesling six years; Chasselas four and six years; large and
small Riesling seven years old. In the Wahgunyah collection there are
Shiraz and Malbec and Muscatel six years old; while amongst the
Sandhurst exhibits are to be found Yerdeilho six years old; Hermitage
five years; Carbinet six and Hermitage six and seven years old; and
Gouais five years.
A new feature has been introduced by the Commissioners with respect
to the wine exhibition of 1875. In former years visitors to the Exhi-
bition saw the bottles containing the wine, read the labels, and had to
take for granted that the taste of the experts as to quality was correct.
This year the public will be able to decide for themselves upon the merits
of the various Colonial wines exhibited. The Commissioners have made
arrangements with the exhibitors by which some of them have provided a
cei'tain quantity of each variety of wine exhibited to be sold to the public
at retail prices. For this purpose a handsome bar has been fitted up in
the Rotunda, to be devoted exclusively to the sale of Colonial wine. The
Court near the Rotunda, in which the fountain is situated, will also
be provided with small tables placed under the shelter of covering
ferns and evergreens, so that those who desire may sip the juice of the
Australian grape at their leisure in the open air. If not able to enjoy
the Hermitage and Tokay under the clustering parent vine, this is the

SILK.
This branch of industry, though as yet in its infancy in the colony, is
one of great importance, and by no means to be undervalued or over-
looked.
It seems difficult to imbue persons with new ideas, but it would be a
pity indeed were the pioneers in this rich industry to toil on singly and
laboriously through years of difficulties, whereas a little public energy
and exertion might speedily crown the effort with success, and add its
contribution to swell the public revenue.
?Speculation? is a misapplied term for an industry known throughout
the world as one most lucrative. Where the mulberry tree will grow,
the silkworm will flourish. Labour is quoted as the great drawback- to
the production of the mulberry, but is the cultivation of this tree more
difficult than that of the olive, the vine, or the orange 1 ? Where the

will is good, the difficulties will vanish one by one, and there will be
added another to the valuable industries of the Colony of Victoria.
The statistics for the year 1870 will give a good idea of the importance
of sericulture:?
It has been urged that were Australia to add, on an extensive scale,
her contribution to the silk market, that it would become overstocked,
and that prices would fall to the minimum. This, however, is a mistake.
As the stocks have become larger, the value of raw silk has not
diminished. The demand has increased with the supply, and prices
have remained steady,
California, where traders are so tenacious of early profits, and where
the price of labour is similar to that of Victoria, has understood the full
value of silk culture; there have already been planted in California within
three or four years half as many trees as there are in France. It must
be remembered that in sericulture labour is only required at certain
periods of the year, viz., those when other demands for labour are dull.
The success of California lies in a great measure in the hearty spirit of
co-operation that exists in relation to sericulture. Mulberry trees were
imported, and the means of commencing operations were granted gratis
to those who were desirous of giving sericulture a test. The experiment
lias proved highly successful. The Californian sericulturists possess
already 600,000 mulberry trees, and have received large contracts for
their silk grain. In 1871 the Government offered bounties of �SO for
each 500 mulberry trees of the age of two years, and it is calculated
that in three or four years California will produce from one to two
millions pounds of silk.
The first and great means of success is public interest and support, so
that an impetus be given to the industry at the outset. Robinet, one of the
chief of French sericulturists, declares that in a new country the sericole
industry cannot ?be expected to take deep root unless it is initiated by a
large model establishment which is a nursery, not only of plants, but of
worms of the right sort, and at the same time a training school for
reelers and breeders.? This opinion is corroborated by facts; for if we
follow the history of sericulture we shall find that in every country
where it is flourishing this industry invariably originated in a model
establishment formed and supported by public money. In our days
France has establishments of this sort; she has founded one in her


infant colony of Algeria; and on her own soil Government lias lately
founded a vast establishment, comprising the three branches of the in-
dustry, and superintended by two eminent professors, where the young
are admitted and trained for sericulture.
Will our Colony, which in many ways is so energetic and advancing,
repel the numerous and daily increasing attempts to place this industry
on a marketable footing 1 ?
The sericultural history of Victoria is very brief. The pioneer was
Mrs. Timbrell, a zealous, indefatigable woman, who has persevered
through great hardships for fifteen years, and who as yet has received
no support or encouragement beyond medals accrediting her capability
and a bonus of �2O. The last two years the public has shown an
awakening interest in sericulture through the ardour and eloquence
of Mrs. Neill, than whom no one seems more capable of inspiring
people with zeal for the work she herself has undertaken. A ladies?
company has been formed, and the best European grain is received,
and dispensed by them to pupils duly qualified to educate it. A market
has been opened in Europe, the grain and cocoons are pronounced of
first-class quality, and it only remains to fulfil the earnest of what was
begun with so much spirit.
It is high time that the Government of Victoria should form a proper
?estimate of the value of sericulture, in order to extend to it that foster-
ing support for which it languishes. The Chinese allege ?that eight
acres of mulberry plantation can be made as valuable as 100 acres of
farming land.?
ROPES, JUTE, AND COIR.
The manufacture of rope and twine is in Victoria carried on by com-
paratively few persons, but the few who give their time and capital to
this branch of trade appear to be making it a paying business. According
to the Government returns there are 15 ropewalks and twine factories in
the colony. Three of them employ steam engines to work the machinery,
and the total number of workpeople employed in twisting raw material
into cables, ropes, line, string, and twine of all thicknesses is 208. The
information at hand is not such as to enable us to give the value of the
work turned out yearly by Victorian rope and twine makers, but from
returns submitted to the Commissioners, they are in a position to say that
one ropewalk in a Melbourne suburb-has during the past year produced
�9500 worth of twisted fibre, and that another rope and coir-making
factory has realised �31,276. A third ropewalk, where manual labour
only is employed, produces to the extent of �llOO.
In the fabrication of articles made only from jute, there are at present
two establishments at work, and the aggregate value of the manufactures
produced in 1874 was �5296. The articles which have realised the
amount above mentioned are sacking, woolpacks, &c., and the number
of hands employed in making them is 51 men, 154 women and girls,
and 58 lads. Wages in the jute-working trade average thus:?Men, from
�2 to �3 10s. per week; women and girls, from 6s. Bd. to �1 55.; and
lads from Bs. to 15s.


HAIR.
There are three establishments where horse-hair, etc., is dried and
curled, one of which sends on the market �3500 worth of goods yearly.

The Wool trade is?not even excepting the gold-mining interest?the
first in importance in the Australian colonies. Of com se, fi om an actual
money point of view, the amount realised by gold-mining exceeds that
derived from the sale of wool. Gold-mining is, however, piecaiious, and


now that the alluviums are nearly worked out, and mining at depths
involves the outlay of capital and time, it is more so than ever. Wool-
�10.w^n8> 011 the contrary, affords a permanent and secure occupation to
which capitalists can turn their attention. It may be urged that wool-
growing is also precarious; reference will be made to the continued
drought of a few years ago, and it will be pointed out how want of
water entailed death to the flocks and ruin to the squatter. This is
tuie, and it is not to be expected that the propitious seasons which have
existed for the last four or five years will last for ever. Those who
follow pastoral pursuits have learnt a lesson from their own misfortunes
or from the bitter experience of others. Over the length and breadth
of Australia precautionary measures against the evils inflicted by pro-
tracted drought have been taken. At enormous expense dry water-
courses have been made into permanent rivers, reservoirs and tanks
have been formed, wells have been dug, dams have been made, and
stations have been so provided with such a water supply that, with the
exception of isolated cases, a recurrence of the catastrophe of the year
1806 need not be feared. The occupation of wool-growing is increasing
C^ aS Le tloek-masters push their way into the interior
What were but a few years ago ?Back Blocks,? another name for the
ulUma thule of civilisation, are now populous districts containing
thriving townships and hamlets. The vast tracts of country, unknowii
until trodden by the unfortunate Burke and Wills, are dotted with
station homesteads, and the Babel of voices about the shearing-shed is
now heard where but a short time ago the stillness of the bush was only
broken by the cooee of the blackfellow. Northward Ho will soon be the
cry, and it will not be long before adventurous men will be found to try
the capabilities of the Northern Territory, opened up by the trans-conti-
nental telegraph line, for sheep-farming. Great therefore as the wool-
gi owing interest of Australia is, it has not nearly reached the limit of
its extent or importance as yet.
As compared with New South Wales and Queensland, with their
immense areas, the annual increase in the wool grown in Victoria
is not large; but if it be considered what extent of land has
been taken up and how rapidly selection has been going on, and
how little is left for the squatter beyond what is his own by
Purchase, then it must be conceded that the smallest of these colonies
manages to hold its own. Some idea of the magnitude of the Victo-
rian wool trade may be gathered from the fact, that for the year ended
si!� ! 18 ' 5 > thf f e ? exported 45,365,693 lbs. of greasy wool,
6,879,963 lbs. scoured wool, 36 416,355 lbs. washed, representing a
money value of �6,3/3,641. This includes a large quantity of wool
grown in the Riverine Districts of New South Wales, but it is impossible
to arrive at the exact proportion.
Messrs. Goldsbrough & Co.?s Monthly Circular for February, 1875, states
uxt during last season 144,335 bales were catalogued and 103,455 bales
sold, the largest quantity hitherto offered and sold in the colony in one
year. Hie sales made represent a money value of �2,000,000 sterling
ihese large operations show that the attractions of this market are
becoming fully recognised by the trade generally in Europe and America.

The condition of the clip last season was good, more especially the
unwashed portions, the greater part of which lots were secured by
America, the dealers of that Continent having by their spirited operations
gained the largest selection of Australia?s choicest flocks. The prohibi-
tory tariff of the United States precluded American buyers from
purchasing washed wools.
From the Ist of October, 1874, to February, 1875, the number of
bales exported was 258,753, showing an increase of 28,116 bales over the
corresponding period of the year before. In the increase must be
included several thousand bales which in previous years were shipped
from Hew South Wales and South Australia. The late extension of
Victorian railways has induced many flock-owners to send their clips to
Melbourne in preference to shipping from Sydney and Adelaide to
London direct. The increased shipments from Melbourne and Geelong
include nearly all the increase of the Australian colonies, in proof of
which it may be stated that the exports of Hew South Wales show an
actual decrease of over 11,000 bales, while from South Australia the
increase is only 5000 bales.
As an illustration of the wonderful progress made in the production of
wool, Messrs. Goldsbrough and Co. have furnished the following state-
ment of the number of bales exported each year from 1837 to the present
time, and from which it will be evident that the pastoral resources have
been developed at an almost unprecedentedly rapid rate:?
Table showing the

of Victoria, from
1837 to the Present
Note. ?Up to 1860, the Returns are made out for each year inclusive, and are
approximate only; the Customs clearances being given in pounds weight, which
we have divided into bales. From October 1, 1860, to October 1, 1874, our own
Returns are copied.
Contrasting the shipment of 514 bales in 1837 with the enormous
aggregate of 265,540 bales exported last year, it must be a matter of
surprise that such a result has been attained in the comparatively short
space of thirty-seven years. Taking a moderate estimate of value, the ship-
ments of last year would probably represent over �6,000,000, and this
does not comprehend nearly the entire revenue derived from pastoral
pursuits, as the value of the tallow, hides, sheep-skins and other animal
products must be added.


The climate of Australia is most favourable for sheep and cattle, which
thrive wonderfully. It is especially suited for the Merino sheep, which
here attains its best development; consequently the wool produced has
Achieved a high standard of excellency, unsurpassed, if indeed equalled,
in any other part of the world. This is due chiefly to the enterprise
and judgment of flockowners, who have spared no cost to import and
produce the most valuable sheep that can be bred.
A recent return published in London states that for seven years past
there has been little or no increase in the imports of wool from South
America, the total yield for 1874 being 237,458 bales, whilst the yield
for 1868 was 234,916 bales. The fact that the supply of 1874 only
shows an increase of 2542 bales over that of 1868 can scarcely fail to
cause surprise when we take into consideration the almost boundless
extent of country generally believed to be available for sheep farming
in the different provinces; in fact, only a few years ago, so rapid was the
increase of imports from the River Plate, that it became almost a cause of
alarm to wool-growers, a general reduction in the value of the article,
consequent upon an excessive supply, being anticipated. Various causes
Are assigned for the check which sheep-farming has evidently sustained
in the country referred to, amongst which may be mentioned the diseases
and epidemics to which sheep are stated to be subject, the mortality
amongst the lambs during dry seasons, and the insecurity of tenure,
arising from the frequent disturbances.
The increase from the Cape of Good Hope also has been much less
than might have been anticipated, for we find that whilst in 1868
141,916 bales were exported, the total yield in 1874 was onlv 164 194
bales.
The great increase in the production of wool has therefore been in
these colonies; the total yield from Australia, (Tasmania, and New
Zealand in 1868 being 491,218 bales, whilst that of 1874 was 651,576
bales. But this increase, large though it may at first sight appear, has
evidently not had a depreciating effect on the value of the article?on
the contrary, wool has advanced enormously in value during the past
four years, notwithstcnding a constantly increasing supply. At the
beginning of last year there was an almost general impression that the
great increase available for the year would inevitably have a depressing
effect, and cause a reduction in prices, but the result has shown that the
trade can readily absorb all that we have produced. Even in the sales
of August and September, 1874, when the largest quantity hitherto
catalogued in one series was offered, the total being 332,962 bales, so
brisk was the demand that not only was the whole of the wool readily
sold, but an actual advance of Id. to 2d, per lb. on the preceding series
?of May and June was realised. In fact, it is clear that although the
production has increased, the demand has more than kept pace with it.
New markets have been opened up, population has been increasing, the
labouring classes have been prosperous, consequently the manufactured
article has met with ready consumption. So long as these causes operate,
and no warlike disturbances arise, no doubt the article will continue in

The Australian climate is pre-eminently favourable for Live Stock,
which thrive and increase rapidly, the weather being generally through-
out the year mild and genial. For cattle and sheep the climate and soil offer
advantages possessed by almost no other country in the world, and stock
of this description, whether from the rich pasture land of the western
portion of Victoria, the broad plains of Riverina, the fertile pastures of
the Darling Downs, or the vast tracts of country in Northern Queens-


land, arrive at a state of excellence and condition that fully proves Aus-
tralia to be second to no other country as the home of these two classes
live stock. We hear a great deal of the excellence of English beef,
and invidious comparisons are often made between it and the meat
exposed for sale in the butchers? shops of the chief towns of the Australian
continent. A glance at the contents of the principal butchering establish-
ments of Melbourne when exposed to please the eye of consumers will
dispel all doubts upon the subject of Australian meat. It must be borne in
mind that in the old country fat stock is conveyed from the breeder?s
pasture with all care. Comfortably transported to London and other
large cities by rail, they arrive in a comparatively short time, and
in a condition no worse than that in which they left the fattening pas-
tures. Here it is different. Cattle have in most instances to travel long
distances to market, and now that selection has so rapidly increased here,
to do a great part of the journey between fences; that is, they have to travel
along roads, where there is, of course, but scant pasture. This is notably
the case with those cattle coming from Riverixxa, for although by the
laws of New South Wales travelling cattle are allowed to depasture for
a mile on each side of the road, the accommodation is not sufficient for
the herds that weekly wend their way to the Victorian markets.
These drawbacks must, of course, be detrimental to the condition of the
animals. A beast, however, that is driven slowly from the pasture land
to the stockyard of a station homestead, and which is left in quiet for six
or a dozen hours, will present, when killed and dressed, an excellence of
condition and an appearance of alternate fat and lean, which in the
vaunted sirloins of the mother country form a theme of expatiation for
writers whose pleasing duty it is, at each succeeding Christmas time, to
vaunt the merits of the ?roast beef? of old England. Great praise is
due to Australian stockholders for the energy they have displayed in
their attention to breeding, and the prices obtained by many of the
large breeders are a guarantee that their efforts in this direction are fully
appreciated. There is a desire and a determination, too, on the part of
stockowners to supply themselves with sii?es whose strain is undoubted,
and in Victoria the credit and honour of being able to supply such
undoubtedly belongs to the eminent breeders who for years have de-
voted all their experience and time to improve the breed of Victorian
horned stock. The number of Horned Cattle is 958,658, of which
241,137 are milch cows, and 717,521 other cattle.
The number of Sheep in Victoria at the end of March, 18 <5, was
11,221,036. With the sheep farmers the long woolled sheep have
gradually been coming into favour, and lately, in some portions of
Victoria, especially the North Eastern district, where a large portion of
the ground is moist and marshy, the introduction of Romney Marsh
sheep has been tried with success. In limited flocks the Merino has
been tried in competition with the Lincoln and Leicester, and the
crosses with these breeds and the coarse-woolled sheep have been found
to be pi'ofitable. The Lincoln thrives well hex?e, its fleece being remark-
able for weight ox? bxightness of staple; and the cross with the Merino
produces a wool held ixx much favoux 1 by manufacturex?S. By many, the
Lincoln is looked upon as too large-framed and coarse to cross with the


Merino, but the experience of some years would appear to prove the
fallacy of such a dogma. The Lincolns that have been imported have
not been much larger or bigger in the bone than the Leicesters, and
have the advantage of yielding nearly double the weight of wool.
Some years ago Cotswold and Southdown were the favourite varieties,
but the wool was found to be dry and harsh, and as the fleece was found
to be of more importance than the carcass, these varieties made way for
others. Without wishing to institute a comparison between Australian
and English mutton, it can safely be said that Australian mutton will
satisfy the palates of connoisseurs who have dined off Welsh and South-
down mutton.
During the last few years experiments have been tried with the
Angora Goat. Pure-bred animals were obtained from the Acclimatisation
Society, as well as half-bred goats, and these form the nucleus of
what may, at some future time, prove valuable flocks. As far as it has
gone the experiment has proved successful, the price obtained for the
wool comparing favourably with that obtained in other countries, and
being such as to offer encouragement to still further prosecute the
breeding of the Angora goat.
Australia has almost since its first discovery been famous for its
Horses, The New South Wales stock horse, a race now almost
extinct, is still fondly remembered by old identities, who love to dwell
upon its breeding, speed, agility, and endurance. The last quality is
particularly the great characteristic of Australian-bred horses. The
Arab, in its native desert, is, if subject to long and forced journeys,
cared for by its owner. We are told how it is tenderly groomed, and
how it is offered protection from climatic influences by being allowed to
share the tent of its master. No such care is vouchsafed to the Australian
bush horse. After each successive day?s journey it is relieved of its
saddle and, perhaps hobbled, is turned out to look for provender, which
is often scanty enough, especially in summer, and still, morning after
morning, the animal is ever fresh and ready to carry its rider another
day?s journey. The Australian stock horse is a genus per se. To see
him in his element one must be present at mustering, and see him going
through the intricacies of cutting out an obstinate beast. How he
dodges, turns, stops, and turns again in a manner that outvies the
trained steed of the hippodrome, or the agility of the mustangs of the
pampas. Of late years, much attention has been turned to the breeding
of thoroughbred stock, and no expense has been spared in importing
sires and brood mares of undoubted pedigree. A visit to any of the
principal breeders? establishments in Victoria, New South Wales, or
South Australia, and a peep at the youngsters, will show that breeding of
blood-stock in Australia has, been successful. Other proof will be found
in the numerous entries for the sires? and mares? produce stakes, the
prices that young stock realise at the yearly sales, and at the performances
of the Australian-bred youngsters on the turf It would be invidious to
particularise the breeders of blood-stock in Australia when there are so
many who have made for themselves a name. The same may be said of
our draught stock. The best imported sires have been procured, and
breeders have spared no pains to keep up the standard of this class of


horse, and the high prices which they realise for their three and four
year olds is a proof that their efforts have been successful. The classes
of horse in which some improvement might be made are those of
carriage horses and hackneys. These two classes, as specialties, seem
entirely neglected, chiefly, it is thought, on account of the difficulty
there is in obtaining brood mares of the requisite breeding, size, and
form, to produce progeny fitted for these two classes of horses. A
number of Arab entires have lately been imported, but the time has not
yet arrived to judge of their success as sires. Many of them have been
taken to districts where there is a dearth of mares, and have been
obliged to cover the weedy animals of the surrounding farmers or selectors.
This is not giving them a fair chance. The Arabs which have been
imported do not average over 15 hands 1 inch to 15 hands 2 inches height.
To produce anything like good stock they require big, roomy, well
ribbed up, broad backed, strong loined mares, not too coarse in breeding,
and these are just the class of which there is a decided dearth. Until
such however are obtained, trials of a cross with the Arab will not obtain
a fair chance. There were in Victoria at the end of March, 1875, horses
to the number of 180,254.
All Englishmen are fond of Dogs, and here in Australia the axiom
holds good to its fullest extent. For years past great attention has been
paid to the breeding of setters and retrievers by gentlemen who have
taken care to import dogs from the best kennels in England. Latterly
the energy that has been displayed in coursing has turned attention to
Greyhounds. As no expense has been spared in importing dogs and
sluts that have figured creditably in the old country, or whose pedigree
is inscribed upon the ?Doomsday Book? of Altcar, there can be but little
doubt that greyhound breeding in Australia will prove successful.
The feeding of Pigs forms an adjunct of dairy work, but prices just
now will not permit the farmer to indulge in pig farming to any great
extent. He cannot compete with those who buy large mobs and allow
them to run in the bush until thought fit for market, or with those who
import them from the east settlements of New South Wales, where
they are reared for little or nothing on swampy or inferior land, and fed
for a few weeks on maize when large enough for shipment to the Vic-
torian market from Sydney. At the end of March, 1875, there were in
Victoria pigs to the number of 137,941.
The Wild Animals of Australia are but few. The Kangaroo and other
marsupials of this class still continue numerous, and consume so much
grass on the squatters? runs that battues have to be held to keep them
down. Opossums and Native Bears inhabit the gum forests, and in
sandy districts the Wombat forms his burrows, while the duck-bill Platy-
pus still haunts the banks of our rivers and streams. The Native Dog,
the bane of the squatters? flocks, is, as population extends, becoming
scarcer. The Tasmanian Devil, the most repulsive and fiercest looking
animal in existence, and the ferocious Tasmanian Tiger, although once
inhabiting Australia, as proved by the teeth found in the Wellington
caves and also in Victoria, are now confined to Tasmania.
Hares have been successfully introduced into the colony, and have
thriven beyond expectation. They breed three times a season for once


in the mother country, and have as many as six or seven at a birth.
Rabbits are exceedingly abundant, and they are killed wholesale for
food for the Melbourne market, and, notwithstanding, they are with
difficulty kept within bounds.
The Birds of Australia are not numerous. The Emu is the monarch
of the feathex-ed tx-ibe of Australia. This species of the ostxdch possesses
the same strength, speed, and wonderful powei-s of digestion, as the rest
of the genus. The chief of the other Australian bix-ds are the Native
Companion, the Bustai?d, commonly knowxx as the Wild Tux-key?now
beconxixxg somewhat scarce, except on the plain country of Riverina?
the Laughing Jackass or Settlex-?s Clock, the Mopoke, Hawks, vax-ioxxs
vax-ieties of Cx-axxes axxd Waterfowl, axxd the Black Swan, axxd the
Native Goose, a bix-d most xxnlike its fax-myard namesake, and the Bx-oxxze-
wixxg Pigeon and the Mallee Hen. The talkative Cockatoo axxd the chat-
tex-ixxg Magpie mixst xxot be fox-gottexx, nor the vax-iegated Pax-x-okeets
of Australia, the vax-ieties of which are legioxx, axxd the vax-ioxxs classes of
Hawks. Of the game species there are the Black and Wood Duck, Quail,
Sxxipe, and Plover. Sad havoc was made with these species by those so-
called sportsmen who were wont to slaughter them all the year round.
Since, however, the game laws have enfox-ced a close season, the num-
ber of these birds has again begxxxx to incx-ease. Pheasants and Cali-
fox?xxian Qxxail have also beexx acclimatised, axxd promise to be a success.
For yeax's gx-eat attexxtion has beexx paid to the x-eax-ixxg of Poultx-y axxd
Sixxgixxg Birds, as a list of the exhibits at the yeax-ly poultry shows will
testify. The success that has attended the breedixxg of this class of
feathered stock is in a gx-eat measure due to the efforts of the Poultry
bociety of Victox-ia, to excite by tlxeix* prizes an emulation amongst
bx-eedex-s.
One of the exhibits ixx the Exhibition is a handsome and complete col-
lectioxx of edible bix-ds, watex-fowl, game, &c. This collection is from the
Melboux?xxe max-ket, axxd the specimens, sciexxtifically xxamed, ax-e ixxtended
for sciexxtific ixxfox-mation, as well as to x-epresent the supply of the
nxax-ket.
The Reptiles of Axxstralia ax-e xxxxmex?ous, soxne of them beixxg vexxomoxxs,
the bite of the Scorpion and Tarantula exceedingly so. The White
Axxt is most destructive to timbex-, axxd the bite of the Red and Bulldog
species is very severe. Alligators are to be foxxxxd in the tx-opical rivers
of the continent. Snakes are found all over Australia, the chief species
beixxg the Black, Browxx, Carpet, Tiger, and Whip Snakes, and the Death
Adder. Some of these, such as the black axxd tiger snake, and the death
adder, are known to be so poisonous that death is the result from coxxtact
with the fangs that contain the vix-ulent juice. Science has been at wox-k,
axxd Professor Halford, after numerous experixnents, boldly asserts that
ammoxxia, if ixxjected in time, is a specific against the bite of these reptiles.
Other experts deny the efficacy of the treatment, but although much has
been said axxd wx-itten on both sides, the preponderance of testimoxxy rests
with Professor Halford. One difficxxlty exists in fully proving the pro-
fessor?s assertions. Ixx the most cases whex-e a pex-son is bitten the reptile
escapes, axxd it is nearly always impossible to idexxtify the class to which
the sxxake belonged. As it is assex-ted that some vax-ieties of sxxakes, the


carpet snake to wit, are harmless, it is urged that many of the bites treated
with ammonia would have proved innoccuous as far as loss of life is con-
cerned, even if Professor Halford?s treatment had not been resorted to.
As a contrast to the apathy that exists with regard to natural science
in this country, must be mentioned the useful labours of the Acclimatisa-
tion and Zoological Society, which, with limited means, has not only
formed the nucleus of a fine menagerie of living animals, but has exerted
itself to introduce the natural products of other countries, which may
one day prove to increase its natural wealth.
PISHES.
Amongst Fishes the perch family (Percidce) has a numerous representa-
tion. The chief of the freshwater perch is the Murray Cod ( Oligorus
Macquariensis) which often attains the weight of over 100 lbs. When
fresh, and first taken from the Murray, it is a good fish; but after a
journey by rail to Melbourne it loses much of its flavour. Another
mistake is vending the larger fishes of from 30 to 60 lbs. weight. They
are coarse, the best size for eating being those weighing from 5 to 8 lbs.
This fish has been introduced by the Acclimatisation Society into the
Yarra, and small specimens are often caught.
The Gippsland Perch (Lates colonorum) is very similar to the sea sort,
and is frequently brought to Melbourne in the winter time. This fish
will, however, not stand a long carriage, and to be fully appreciated must
be eaten fresh.
The most important of the Murray fishes after the cod is the Golden
Perch (Dales auratus), which sometimes weighs up to 6or 7 lbs. There
is also the Murray Silver Perch (Therapon Pichardsoni), found in nearly
all the streams of Riverina, and often brought to the Melbourne market.
The genus Arripis is entirely Australian, and is represented by the
Roughy (Arripis. Georgianus) and the Salmon Trout (A. truttaceus)
the full-grown specimens of the latter being called salmon by fishermen.
Both specimens are frequently brought to market, but caution is required,
as their flesh often causes painful poisoning, which sometimes results in
death. The Red Gurnet (Upneichthys jiorosus), belonging to the family
of Mullidce, is a welcome table fish, and is remarkable for its beautiful
carmine hue and the pretty blue stripes of its head.
The most important of the family of the Sparidce are the Snapper
(Sagrus unicolor) and the Bream (Chr ysophris Australis), the first of
which often weighs upwards of 50 lbs. It is remarkable for its beautiful
pink, and red colours, and is an excellent table fish. The bream never
attains large dimensions, but is esteemed as an article of food, and is
always plentiful in the Melbourne market.
Black Perch ( Melanicthys oricuspulata) so called from its colour, is a
good eating fish, and is frequently obtainable, but another sort, dark grey,
with broad transverse black bands, is far more rare.
The Butterfish is one of the commonest in the Melbourne market.
The Hobart Town Trumpeter ( Lastris Hecateia), is a fish that finds
favour with the Australian gourmets. It is often from two to three feet
long, and has four broad longitudinal bands extending over its generally


grey colour. Although large quantities are brought both fresh and salted
from Tasmania, the trumpeter is found in the Victorian seas. The Bas-
taid Trumpeter (Lastris I osier IJ, of which great numbers are found on
some parts of the coast of Grippsland, is not so generally known, and
for this reason, perhaps, is not so much appreciated.
Of the 1 riglidce the Gurnet ( jVeosebastes scorpcenoidesJ is the most
common, especially in winter. It sometimes reaches 16 inches in length.
The Pentaroge marmorata, a fish with a large movable sword-like spine
below the eye, is found in these waters.
The Flatheads species is the most common and cheapest of the Mel-
bourne fishes. There are several sorts. Common Flathead (Platycephalus
Bassensis), Rock ditto (P. kevlgatus), and Grass ditto (P.fuscus) are
all very abundant, are firm, of good flavour, and constitute an important
portion of our fish supply at a seasons of the year.
The Flying Gurnet (Triglot polyommata) is a fish of great beauty;
its body is crimson silvery, and its pectorals are of a fine green bordered
with purple, and dotted with an oblong black spot lined with white. It
is stated to be a good table fish.
The Stonelifter (Katheosloma lave), all fish of the most unprepossess-
ing appearance, is often met with in the Melbourne market, but Is held
in little estimation as an article of food. The Whiting (Sellago punctataJ,
on the contrary, though very common, is one of the best of the edible
fishes. It is very like the English fish of the same name, and when
salted forms a favourite article of food.
The Pike (Sphyrcena Novce Ilollandice), which attains a large size,
is considered by many as the most delicate of Victorian fishes, while
equally as good is the species often called by fishmongers the Skipjack
Pike (Neosphyrcena).
The appearance of a large sort of Kingfish (Scicena AntarcticaJ in' the
market proves that the family of Scicenidce is present in the Australian
seas. The fish is a great delicacy, resembling the English salmon in
flavour. It is not to be confounded with the Yellow-tail.
The family Trichiuridoe contains one of the principal edible fishes, viz.,
the Barracouta (1 hyrsites atumJ. It is caught in large quantities in
Bass?s Straits, and is very similar to the Cape species.
There are several representatives of the Scombridce, all esteemed as an
edible. The principal of these is the Mackerel (Scomber Antarcticus).
It has an air-bladder, but differs from the Pneumatophorus by the small,
irregular, very numerous punctiform dark spots, which cover all the lower
parts of the body. It is said that in the South Australian seas there are
two species of the Mackerel, which stand to each other in the same sort
of relationship as the Sc. scomber and Sc. pneumatophorus do in the Medi-
terranean, but are both specifically different from the European ones.
The Bonito rarely appears in the market, and is not thought much of
for the table.
The John Dorey is very similar to the European sort of the same name.
It is called the Zeus Australis, and is considered a great delicacy, but is
not often obtained.


The Boarfish, so called from its long muzzle, although often sold, is con-
sidered decidedly inferior as an edible fish.
The Silver Bream, which sometimes attains the length of two feet,
although the greatest number are from 8 to 10 inches, is good for the
table, as is also the Snutgall, found in all the warm and temperate seas
of the world. It is very common at the Cape of flood Hope, where it is
called Elftvish, and is much esteemed.
The Blenny, as it is called by fishermen, is very scarce, but when
obtained is considered to possess highly culinary qualities. There are
three species known in the colony.
The Devilfish forms a new genus of the Nandidce, and is characterised
by the soft part of its dorsal and of the anal being considerably elongated,
and its ventrales formed of one spine and only three rays.
Mullet are plentiful. A particular species is found in the lakes of
Gippsland, locally called Fat Mullet. Its scientific name is Agonosto-
raata loscustris. The Sand-mullet ( Mugil Waigiensis), first found in
New Guinea, is much esteemed.
The Sand-eel (Gonorphynchus golgi) is found here, and is considered
a delicate article of food.
The Parrot-fish (Salrichthys Bleekeri), though of beautiful colour and
large size, is not often sent to market, as it is not genei?ally considered
good food. The Stranger (Odex Richardsoni) is common at all seasons.
It is remarkable for its parrot-like beak and its colours.
The Black fish ( Gadopsis marmoratus) inhabits nearly all the rivers
and streams of the southern part of Victoria, and is also found in Tas-
mania. It sometimes attains a length of two feet, and is a veiy good
edible fish.
Rock Cod ( Pseudophycis barbatus) is much esteemed for food, and is
common in the market, particularly during the winter months.
The Rock Ling (Glenipterus Australis) is not often to be got, and is
considered delicate. It is sometimes two feet long, and is covered with
large brown marbled blotches, and has two long barbels.
The family Flatfish is almost entirely composed of sorts esteemed good
for the table. The most common of these is the Flounder (Pleuronectes
Victoria). The Sole (Rhovibosolea Bassensis) is sometimes, but very
rarely, taken in these waters.
The family of Silurida, so common in the fresh-waters of warm
countries, is represented here by the Murray Catfish (Gopidoglanis Tan-
danus). Althotigh fit for the table, as are most of the species to which
it belongs, it is a hideous-looking fish, attaining over two feet in length.
The Yarra Herring (Prototroctes maroena) used to be common in that
river, but of late years it has disappeared. It is nearly the only repre-
sentative of the genus Salmonidce we have, and has been classified by
Gunther and Castelneau as above.
The Sergeant Baker is a large and beautiful fish, which, though very
rare on the Victorian coast, is more common at Sydney. Its colours are
a mixture of grey, scarlet, and orange.
Yarra Trout (Galaxias ocellatus) abound, and, though small, are used
as articles of food. There are, according to Count Castelneau, five species.


The Garfish (Hemiramphus melanochir) is abundant throughout the
year, and is one of the best breakfast-fish. Its chief characteristic is the
extraordinary length of its jaw.
Whitebait (Engraidis Antarcticus) are common in the fish market. It
is larger than the English whitebait (which is allied to the herring
family), and when fresh is good eating.
The Pilchard ( Culpea sagax), which is caught in large numbers during
the summer months, is very delicate eating. It appears to be the only
representative of the Culpea we have, and is supposed to be closely
allied to the Japanese species.
The Smelt (Meletta Novce Jlollandue), a light green pretty little fish,
is common and is good eating.
A large Conger (believed to be Wilsoni of Black) is very common
towards Hobart Town, and is often brought salted to Melbourne. It
rarely appears in Hobson?s Bay.
The Leather Jackets (Sclerodermi) found in Victorian waters, are not
generally used as food, though fishermen say that when their thick skin
has been removed they are not to be despised.
Toadfishes (Tetrodon), Sunfish (Orthagoriscus), and Globefish (Dio-
don) belong to the Gymodontes, a class possessing dangerous qualities,
many of the sorts being poisonous.
Sharks and Rays belong to the order Plagiostomata. Of the latter
several sorts are brought to market, the most common being the Raya
Lemprieri and the Raya rostrata.
Two sorts of Lamprey (Geotria Australis and Mordacia Mordax) are
found here. The first acquires sometimes an extraordinary pouch, which
gives it a singular appearance. Lampreys in all countries are esteemed as
food.
Several varieties of European fish have been introduced into Aus-
tralia, such as Salmon Trout, Brown Trout, English Perch, and Carp.
All these, except the Salmon, are known to be a success, and increasing
rapidly. Several of the inland lakes are abundantly stocked with Perch
and Carp, and Brown Trout have been captured weighing 9 lb.
One of the exhibits is a collection of over forty different kinds of
edible fish and others. This is intended for scientific information as well
as to represent the supply of the Melbourne market.
The Victorian Oyster is almost extinct, owing to over-dredging ; expe-
riments are, however, being made to re-establish it. The principal
supply used in the Melbourne market is imported from New South
Wales and Queensland, and sold under the name of Sydney Rocks.
The Shells of Victoria are not, either in size or quality, such as to com-
mend them as objects of ornament. Some beautiful samples are, how-
ever, imported from the South Sea Islands, and receive their final polish
in Melbourne. The same may be said of coral.
Some beautiful specimens of Algae are found about the coast, and
when grouped together in harmony of colour form pretty seaweed
pictures.
Whalebone is obtained in small quantities from Tasmania, where
whale fishing is carried on to a limited extent, and is used by some
of the Victorian artisans in the business of their trades.

PRESERVED MEATS AND HAM AND BACON CURING.
V ERY few years ago Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, Fortnum and Mason
and other celebrated London purveyors had the monopoly of the world!
Now, thanks to individual enterprise and the fattening capabilities of


Australia, Victoria was enabled to enter into competition with the old-
world manufacturers. In this year of 1875 meat rules considerably
higher than it has done for some time past, and Meat Preserving is not
flourishing as a trade. During the past year so many meat preserving
companies have been compelled by non-paying results to stop work,
that it is almost impossible to fairly estimate the value of the industry.
Of course it will be understood that game preserving can only be carried
on during the open season. Beef and mutton are preserved mostly for ex-
portation, but there is a fair demand for them in districts remote from the
great centres of population, and on board the intercolonial steamers the
ai'ticle is also a considerable item in the providore?s stock. The most
prominent items on the list of Australian ?canned? meats of an epi-
curean order are sheep?s tongues and curried rabbit. Australia is rich in
waterfowl, but as ducks come under the Game Act, the demand for
them during the season is too great to permit of their finding their way to
any extent into hermetically sealed cans. Rabbits have since their
acclimatisation multiplied so greatly as to become the farmer?s deadly
enemy; but as a pair of fat ones can be bought in the streets for Is. 6d,,
there is but small request for the article in a tin packet.
The black swan is by no means a rara avis here, but is little cared for
as an article of food, though when ?jugged? it can hardly be dis-
tinguished from hare.
Hares have, since they were let loose from the Acclimatisation
Society?s grounds, been most carefully protected by Government, and
though they bid fair to rival the rabbit in prolificacy, they are not as
yet quoted in the market price.
The total number of meat preserving and curing establishments in
Victoria is twenty-onp, nine of which employ steam-power. The
aggregate number of hands employed is 413, viz., 407 males and six
females. The value of the plant and machinery is estimated at �22,325,
the value of the land �13,310, and of the buildings �33,240. The
aggregate wholesale value of the manufactures produced in 1874
amounted to about �300,000.
Australia is the Fruit Garden of the southern hemisphere, and
Tasmania is undoubtedly the forcing-house where the finest specimens are
grown. Queensland contributes its quota of pine apples; and the oranges
from Parramatta are known throughout the length and breadth of Australia.
The great quantity of fruit grown makes prices reasonable, and the
epicure can discuss his pine-apple at 6d. a-piece, and grapes at the com-
mencement of the season for Is. per lb., a price that in a week or two
declines to 3d. As a natural consequence, fruit-preserving and jam-making
has become a stable industry, in the carrying out of which Tasmania
and Victoria take the undoubted lead. There are in Victoria eight jam
manufactories, giving employment to 111 hands?ninety-four males
and seventeen females. The value of the plant and machinery used
is estimated at �1000; the land on which the factories are erected,
�1415, and the buildings, �3035. The aggregate wholesale value of
the manufactures produced in 1874 is estimated approximately to be
�35,000.
Colonial-made Pickles are excellent; and the manufacture of Sauces is


rapidly becoming a growing and remunerative branch of trade. Tomatoes
grow here in profusion, and form the staple of most of the sauces made.
Colonial Worcester sauce is being produced in such large quantities as
bids fair before long to supersede the imported article, which is only
slightly superior and twice as costly to the consumers.
The only manufacturer of Macaroni in the colony is an Italian, who
turns out five tons yearly, at an average price of �35 per ton. He also
makes most excellent Dried Sausages, which compare favourably with
the articles usually sold over the counter as Bologna and Saucisson de
Lyons. These sausages sell at �6O per ton.
GLUE, SOAP, CANDLES AND ANIMAL OIL.
There are forty-three soap, tallow and candle-making works, which
massed together employ 354 male working hands, and twenty-four
females. More than half of these factories use machinery worked by
steam. To this list must be added nine mills, where glue is made and
animal oil extracted from the refuse of slaughter-yards. These nine
mills give work to thirty-six people, and in four out of the nine steam
machinery is at work. From the forty-three factories twelve heads of
establishments have sent to the Commissioners statements, showing the
value of the marketable outgoings of their several places of business, and
from the information thus given an idea of the value of the united trades
may approximately be arrived at. Two glue-factories manufacture
between them glue to the value of �2640 per annum; and one glue-
making establishment, where animal oil is also prepared, sent upon the
market during the year 1874 prepared material worth �3OOO. The
nine owners of soap and candle woi?ks give the total value of the goods
they produced during the past twelve months at �127,540.
The rate of wages in the glue-making, soap and chandlery trades is at
the rate of �2 ss. per man per week, and lads may easily earn from 10s.
to �l.

So much has been written about the vast flocks and herds raised by
Australian squatters, and so universally is it known that kangaroos and
rabbits multiply at this side of the world to such an extent as to become,
like locusts, a perfect pest to farmers, that little need now be said about
the sources from whence are obtained the hides and pelts for tanning.
Tasmanian Kangaroo leather is the best in the world for certain pur-
poses. The Victorian skins, being inferior, are woi?ked into whips,
whipthongs, and laces, and are exported for that purpose to the neigh-
bouring colonies and California. A large number of Tasmanian skins
are tanned here, and a very large export business in them and in sheep-
skin of all sorts, from the pelt with the wool on to the same article
tanned into basil, and various forms of fancy leather, is the result. Visi-
tors to the Exhibition will be able to estimate for themselves not only
the value of the leather our tanpits can turn out, but also the skill of the
craftsmen who manipulate the skins from their raw state until they are


ready for saddlers, harness-makers, bookbinders, shoemakers, and, in a
word, all workers in leather. In the Colony of Victoria alone there are
47 fellmongeries, and 87 tanneries; 27 of the tanneries nse steam-power,
and employ 983 working hands. Among the fellmongers, fifteen factory
owners employ steam, and one establishment has its machinery worked
by a water-wheel. In this branch of trade 911 persons earn their living.
The average of wages in the two trades is �2 2s. per week for men, and
about 15s. for young persons. It is impossible to give the value of the
goods turned out in tanyards and fellmongeries during the statistical year
ending 31st March, 1875, as the value of the manufactures can only be
obtained from persons willing to supply the desired information. From
returns kindly furnished to the Commissioners by forty-two owners of
fellmongeries and tanneries, it appears that the value of the merchandise
sent out of these forty-two centres of labour, amounted during the past
year to the sum of .�701,729. At a fair estimate, our fellmongers and
tanners are now producing pelts and well-tanned leather worth about
�2,000,000.
From the raw material we come to the most prominent articles of use
to which leather is put after leaving the hands of the tanner.
The number of Saddle and Harness manufactories in Victoria is set
down in the official records as sixteen, and none of them employ steam
motive power, though their machinery and plant is estimated at �lBOO
value. The master saddlers give work to 243 males (including, of
course, lads and apprentices). There are four saddle-tree factories in the
colony, one of which possesses steam machinery, and the four combined
give employment to twenty-two workers. The rate of wages in the
saddlery trade may be put down as about �2 10s. a week per man.
Besides the all-important item?leather, catgut and curled hair enter
largely into the fabrication of saddlery. In the colony there are two
factories where catgut is made, and one of them turns out per annum
catgut and other articles made of the twisted intestines of cattle to the
value of �2400. A considerable number of Victorian saddles are sent
to India, and some, principally for hunting purposes, to England.
Whip and Thong factories are officially recorded as three in number,
but only one tradesman in Victoria devotes himself entirely to whip-
making. He has imported the very best machinery that can be pro-
cured, and turns out weekly whips to the value of between �6O
and �7O. The mountings?except for presentation whips?come from
the old country; but the catgut and leather used are all colonial.
Australian twisted gut is considered by the trade to be much better than
the imported article. The cane used in whipstocks is made from
?dunnage,? or, in other words, the split lengths of cane used to bind
Mauritius sugar bags. Two-thirds of the whalebone worked up is
imported ready split, but the other third comes mostly from Tasmania
and is taken from whales killed in our waters. In Europe and America
pigskin is in general use as a covering to first-class whip-handles, but as
we do not dress hogshide here, kangaroo-skin takes its place and looks
and wears equally well if not better.
As a material for whipthongs kangaroo-hide cannot be surpassed for
toughness and flexibility.

A comparatively new industry in Victoria is the manufacture of
Woollen Cloths. Although an attempt was made some years ago to
establish a woollen mill in Melbourne, the venture at that time was not
brought to a successful close. To Geelong belongs the credit of having
been able the first to establish a factory of this description, and to
commence active operations. With such beneficial results was the
venture attended that Melbourne and Ballarat soon followed suit.
There are now in working order six cloth manufactories in Victoria, all
employing steam-power. The aggregate number of hands employed is
462, i.e. 350 males and 162 females. The aggregate value of the plant
and machinery is �97,000. The value of the land upon which the
factories are erected is �5350, and of the buildings in which the busi-
ness is carried on �47,500. The Commissioners caused inquiries to be
instituted as to the wholesale value of the manufactures produced in
1874, and information upon the subject was requested from the owners
or managers of each factory. Some have neglected to comply with the
request, and hence only an approximate computation of the value can
be arrived at. The wholesale value of the products during 1874 is
estimated at �75,000. One factory employs 68 hands, viz., 25 men, 33
women, and 10 young persons. The men?s wages average 405., the
women?s 155., and the young persons 10s. per week, the working hours
being 10 per day. The wholesale value of the manufactures produced
during 1874 was �13,700. Another factory employs about 80 hands;
the wholesale value of the manufactures produced during 1874 being
�ll,OOO.
There are 43 manufactories in Victoria, all of which are in full working
order. The demand for colonial clothing is fast increasing, and year by
year the imports of foreign slop clothing are growing less and less.
Sopie of the largest soft-goods warehousemen have combined the
manufacture of clothing with the other branches of their business.
Under the head of clothing manufactures are meant Crimean shirt facto-
ries, tailoring establishments, mantle, dressmaking, and millinery,
underclothing, crinolines, frilling, and fancy trimmings. The number of
clothing factories from which returns have been received is 43. They give
employment to 3897 hands; of whom 3308 are females, and 589 are
males. The value of the plant and machinery used is �12,513. The


value of the land occupied is estimated at �51,410, and the value of
the buildings at �55,380. The aggregate wages paid during the year
1874 are estimated at �180,274.
Of Hat and Cap manufactories there are 14, one of which employs
steam power. The aggregate number of hands employed is 155, being 89
males and G6 females. The total value of the plant and machinery used
, is <�3285, the value of the land upon which the factories are erected is
estimated at <�7320, and the value of the buildings wherein business is
carried on may be set down at �9375. One factory in Melbourne for
the manufacture of felt hats by patent machinery, furrying and wool-
scouring for hat-making purposes, gives employment to 21 hands?lo
men, 5 women, and 6 young persons?and taking the extent of the
premises, machinery and plant into consideration, work could be given,
if wanted, to four times the number of hands at present employed. The
working hours are 8 per day, and the weekly earnings of the employes
are as follow:?Men, �3; women, 285.; young persons, 10s. The whole-
sale value of the manufactures produced in the year 1873 was �4OOO.
Another establishment with eight hands?s men, 2 women, and 1 young
person, turned out work in 1824, the wholesale value of which was �1344*
The average working hours are 8 per day, and the weekly earnings are
men, �2 10s.; women, �1 ; young persons, 6s. A hat manufactory
at Ballarat gives employment to 4 hands?2 men, 1 woman and 1 young
person : the earnings per week being?men, �4 10s.; woman, �2 55.;
shop boy, 7s. The wholesale value of the manufactures produced in
1874 was �550.
The manufacture of Fur enters largely into the native industry of
Australia. The skins of the indigenous animals are all adapted for rug-
making purposes, and are capable of not only being made useful, but of
being rendered pleasing to the eye. The skins of the opossum and native
bear make plain serviceable travelling rugs, and can be tastefully
ornamented by inserting a few squares of the beautiful skin of the rock
wallaby or the variegated coat of the native cat. Kangaroo rugs are
useful as mats for inside doors or dressing tables, while the skin of the
emu, with the plumage attached, forms a pleasant and somewhat
picturesque hearthrug. The skins of the platypus, pelican, and black
swan are also much used. The skin of the flying squirrel makes pretty
muffs and feet-warmers. There are in Victoria two manufactories, in
which 9 hands are employed?viz., 3 men and 6 women. Of course these
are strictly manufactories, but there are also a number of retail establish-
ments, where the skins after they have been prepared are made up
into articles of use and luxury. The prices that rule for skins are as
follow:?Grey opossums, 4s. per dozen; black do., �1 per dozen in the
rough; native cats, from 3s. to Bs. per dozen; bibbies, from Bs. to 12s.
per dozen; platypus, from �1 10s. to �3 per dozen; emu, from 3s. to
10s, per skin; pelicans, from �1 per dozen; kangaroo, small sorts, from
4s. to Bs. per dozen; wallaby, the same; swan, 30s. per dozen.
Felt-making is likely to become an important industry in Australia, as
since the acclimatisation of the English rabbit, felt-making fur can be
obtained to any amount. All that is wanted is a market for the article,
and when that market is open there will be no lack of enterprising

The history of the rise and progress of the trade of the several ports in
the Colony of Victoria must be looked for in the elaborate statistics
published by the Registrar-General. It is sufficient in this place to
note the number and tonnage of the steam and sailing vessels belonging
to the Colony, and the number of their crews on the 31st December,
1874, the date of the last returns: ?
Among the other subjects enumerated in the groups named may be
mentioned the fine lifeboats which are in use on the coasts of this
Colony. These are five in number, are maintained entirely at the cost
of the Victorian Government, and are in charge of the Harbour
Department. They are built on the self-righting principle, and are, in
all respects, constructed on the model of Mr. James Peake, late Master
Shipwright of Woolwich Yard, who improved upon the boat which
took the Duke of Northumberland?s 200-guinea prize in 1851, built
by James Beeching, of Yarmouth. The Victorian lifeboats are
stationed at Queenscliff, Portland, Belfast, Warrnambool, and Port
Albert. Their crews are exercised twice a quarter, and men who are
employed outside the Government service on such occasions receive 12s.
a day. The heaviest weather is selected for the exercise, and the
various crews are now become thoroughly efficient. Each boat cost
between jQ 700 and and a spare (single banked) boat is kept in the
Marine Yard for the Special Coast Service. Each station is also supplied
with Dennet?s rocket apparatus, and Manby?s mortar and lines, and the
men are practised in their use periodically. From the wreck of the
Admella in 1859, to that of the Eliza Rpmsden in July, 1875, these
lifeboats have been frequently the means of saving life. They are
managed and worked under the same rules as that excellent institution,
the Royal National Lifeboat Institution of England.


There are three Steam Dredges, two Steam Dredge Tugs, and about
forty Punts, belonging to the Government, which are kept up at a cost
of about 18,000 per annum. It is hardly possible to get at their
original cost, but on one alone (the Griper), between 1853 and 1855
the sum of 000 was expended. They are employed as required in
the River Yarra, alongside the Williamstown Railway wharf, and at
Geelong.
In the Colony of Victoria there are 13 Ship and Boat builders, 1
Blockmaker, 1 Floating Dock, 2 Graving Docks, 5 Patent Slips (4
worked by steam and 1 by manual labour); one Graving Dock engine is
of 116 horse-power, and the other of 87, making a total of 203 horse-
power.
In the 13 Shipwrights? yards there are employed 51 males; in the Float-
ing Docks, 29 males; Graving Docks, 66 males; Patent Slips, 82 males.

TOYS, GAMES, &c.
The only loys we make for ourselves are wooden horses, waggons,
?carts, and wheelbarrows, and wickerwork baskets, dolls? peram-
bulators, &c.
Ihe toys in use among us are chiefly of European manufacture, and
?are imported from England; a few also come from China. The im-
portation amounts to about �12,000 a year. Every novelty for the
amusement of the young that is introduced in London very speedily
makes its appearance here also.
Games and the materials of games require more extended notice,
because out-of-door sports and amusements fill a very important part in
the lives of our boys and young men, and are among the most potent
of the influences under which a Victorian national character is growing
up, while their tendency is almost wholly in the right direction. Our
climate is exceptionally favourable to muscular play; a dry, clear
?atmosphere stimulates the energies of the people, and impels old and
young to find an outlet for their superabundant vitality in vigorous
sports. In and around Melbourne and the other towns of the colony
there are numerous spaces of ground which have been wisely reserved
for public uses, and these form excellent arenas for out-of-door games.
The conductors of our principal schools afford every encouragement to
rational play, and the parents of the colony are liberal in supplying their


sons with the implements necessary to their prosecution. Under these
favourable conditions cricket, football, rowing, &c., are pursued with an
ardour and perseverance seldom witnessed elsewhere. Every college
and high school has its senior and junior club for the cultivation of each
of these sports, and matches are of constant occurrence, at one sport or
another, all the year round, sometimes among the pupils of a college or
school, at other times between one school and another. The physical
training which our boys thus receive makes them hardier and more
generally efficient than they would otherwise be, and the moral training,
concurrently received is even more valuable. Boys who are accustomed
to put forth the whole power of their bodies and minds, to sulfer fatigue
and even some danger, in knocking a ball about, will certainly make
better soldiers or sailors in after-life, better explorers or bushmen.
And there is reason to believe that the benefits of these sports are already
to be discovered in the character and manners of our young men.
Teachers who have had great experience in middle and upper class
schools both in Great Britain and in Victoria, say that our lads compare
favourably with those of the old country ?that they are gentler in their
manners, less addicted to rough practical joking or to precocious
smoking and drinking, and much less given to the surreptitious study of
prurient literature.
The Cricket and Football materials used in the colony are imported,,
and are the best procurable.
Of Aquatic Sports we have the usual variety, and for these there are
good natural facilities. Two rivers afford favourable fields for practice,
and there is within a mile of the capital a spacious lake, 3 to 4 feet deep,,
on which sailing-boats can be used even by the inexperienced without
risk, Hobson?s Bay and Port Phillip Bay afford opportunities for more
venturous voyaging. Our rowing boats are nearly all made in the
colony. The best are planked with cedar, their timbers, knees, &c.,.
being of English ash. These cost about 1 a foot, and some of them,.
8-oared, are 56 feet long. Cheaper boats are made of Kauri pine.
Sailing boats of 20 to 25 feet cost, with sails, &c., to
Yachts of sto 12 tons burthen disport themselves in the waters of the
bays already named, and the handling of them requires both skill and
dexterity. On a regatta-day a flotilla of these has been seen to start
in a gale of head-wind to beat down to the Heads, a distance of 30
miles, and during many hours the young men who formed their crews
have had to perform all the duties of seamanship, making and shortening
sail as required, repairing damages, &c., and all the time wet to the
skin.
Our youths have not much opportunity to acquire dexterity with the
Fowling-piece. There is some quail-shooting in the season, and a great
abundance and variety of wildfowl in the lakes and lagoons; but the
haunts of the birds are too distant from the city to be reached by
schoolboys except during holidays. As they grow up, however, many
of our lads practise assiduously with the rifle, and become expert in its
use. For Fishing there are better opportunities. Mullet and bream visit
our coasts in large numbers, and enter our rivers, where they are some-
times caught freely. A basket of 501b. of bream has been secured in a


few hours. These fish are good to eat, but do not show much sport.
They are caught with mud-worm or shrimp bait. In the waters of the
Bay good sport is sometimes found by the fisherman; schnapper, flat-
head, trevally, flounders, etc., reward his patience when he is lucky. All
our fishing material is imported. A silver-mounted rod, in 4 pieces, and
12 feet long, of hickory or wabash-wood, costs 755., and a luxurious
fisher can spend the balance of a�s note in other requisites. At the
same time, a fit-out can be procured for 6d., so that every purse is suited.
The sixpenny apparatus consists of an imported hazel rod at qd., and
the balance in string and hook. The boys take to fishing with great
eagerness, and at certain seasons of the year are to be seen in hundreds
plying their craft by the banks of the Yarra and Saltwater rivers, from
the piers and banks, etc.
Nothing in what has been here said must be understood to imply that
sports and games are only followed assiduously by the sons of well-to-do
parents. As there is a sixpenny stand of fishing gear, so is there also
the materials of other games at very low prices. It would appear that
our eight-hour system tends to the success of muscular sports. Appren-
tices and factory boys are unable to get work enough for themselves in
the usual hours of labour, and rush madly to cricket or football when
released at dinner time or in the evening.
TYPOGRAPHIC AIDS TO THE PRESERVATION AND
DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE.
At the Government Printing Office there is the best of printing
machinery, added to and renewed from time to time at considerable
expense. At the Argus office there are three four-feeder Hoe machines
with flying attachment, and two platten machines, used for printing the
illustrated newspaper issued from the establishment. Also, eight folding
machines and other apparatus. Two powerful 'steam engines give
motion to them all. At the Age office, where the stereotyping process
is in use, there is a Victory machine and others, folding machines,
etc., with the necessary steam power. At other newspaper offices in
town and country, and in the job offices, other machines are to be
found in great variety, as well as presses of all kinds. Lithographic
and copperplate presses also abound. Our manufacture of type is
limited to the supply of sorts, in which manufacture old ?letter? is
used up. The work turned out from our newspaper, book, and job
offices is inferior to none.
BOOKS, PERIODICALS, NEWSPAPERS.
There is a considerable production of Books and Pamphlets in the
colony. Of the latter, a list comprising hundreds could be compiled?
reprints of sermons and lectures, controversial tracts on religion, science,
and politics. If our publishers and printers were as trustful and
sanguine as our pamphleteers could wish, the list by this time would
have swelled to thousands, but they have a disconcerting way of looking


for payment on account. Of more ambitious Victorian publications,
Mr. George Robertson?s list contains a considerable number. Among the
most important of his publications which are Victorian in every respect
may be mentioned the works of Professor Hearn, Rev. P. Menzies, &c.
Among works published by him under arrangement with publishers
elsewhere, are Trollope?s ?Australia and New Zealand,? Farrar?s ?Life
of Christ,? ?Supernatural Religion,? ?Kenelm Chillingly,? ?The
Innocents at Home and Abroad,? ?The Gilded Age,? ?South Sea
Bubbles,? ?Bret Harte?s Tales and Poems,? and many others. Some of
these works were brought out with great promptitude, in the best style,
and had a large sale. Of some of them second issues have appeared at
the same prices obtained for cheap foreign editions. Mr. Samuel Mullen
produces Handbooks for the University Matriculation Examinations,
for which there has been a great demand since young ladies were
permitted to ?go up;? also, lectures and sermons. Mr. Bailliere has
been an extensive publisher, chiefly of medical works, gazetteers,
directories, and legal works. His ?Victorian Gazetteer,? of 442 pages
Bvo, sells at 21s. Gazetteers for the other colonies produced by him
sell at the same price. Messrs. Gordon and Gotch publish annually an
excellent Handbook Almanac, which is full of statistical information,
and also a monthly ?Guide,? which gives all necessary information
in regard to the railways, coaches, steamboats, and hotels of all the
colonies, besides a great deal of other useful information. Messrs.
Clarson and Massina produce a large number of Song Books, which
find a ready sale. It was they who printed Gordon?s Bush Ballads,
&c., which proved the most successful poetical venture the colony has
witnessed. The poems were sold to the number of many thousands.
Mr. Calvert makes a specialty of coloured Picture Books, which his
authors cleverly adapt from familiar English models. They are turned
out in excellent style. There is a considerable production of religious
and temperance tracts in the colony, and a large number of almanacs.
Also a ?Bradshaw?s Guide,? ?Turf Register,? etc.
Thirty-two newspapers are published in the city of Melbourne, 22 in
the suburbs, and 76 in other parts of the colony. Of the city journals five
are daily (three morning, and two evening), one bi-weekly, 12 weekly, one
fortnightly, and the rest monthly. Of the monthly newspapers two are
illustrated, two are scientific, and the rest religious or temperance. Of
the country newspapers ten are daily, the others appearing thrice, twice,
or once a week. The Argus is an eight-page paper of the usual size, but
it has 10, 12, or 16 pages, according to the demands upon it. On Satur-
day it generally is of 12 pages. The Age and Telegraph are four-page
papers, except on Saturdays, when the former is of 8 and the latter of
6 pages, both giving in these issues a great deal of miscellaneous reading
matter. The Australasian and Leader are weeklies of 40 pages. These
papers circulate extensively in the other colonies and New Zealand.
The Weekly Times , Town and Country , etc., are on the same plan as the
Australasian. The Illustrated Australian News and Australian Sketcher
are monthly pictorial newspapers, which are turned out in a style equal
to those of London. They are of 16 pages, half of which are occupied
with illustrations. They are published before the departure of every mail


for Europe, and serve as pleasant remembrancers to friends in the Old
Country.
In regard to the newspaper press of the Colony, it may safely be said
that it is inferior to that of no other country in the world. In the as-
siduity with which its materials are collected, it rivals the press of the
United States, while in its tone it more resembles the English, avoiding
personal details and sensational items.
CHARTS, MAPS, AND GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS.
MAPS,
The exhibits under this section include specimens from the various
ocal publishers. But the greater portion of the mapwork done in the
colony is issued from the Department of Lands and Survey, and this
will bear favourable comparison with similar publications produced in
other countries. Of these exhibits special attention may be drawn to
the three large maps of the colony engraved under the direction of Mr,
A. J. Skene, the Surveyor-General, and Mr. A. C. Allan, Inspector-
General of Plans and Survey. These are beautiful specimens of map-
work, engraved on copper by Mr. Slight, and afterwards transferred to
stone. The first is a large map of the colony in four sheets, drawn on
a scale of eight miles to the inch, showing the hill and other physical
features of the country. The second, in two sheets, on a scale of sixteen
miles to one inch, is intended to display the relative positions of Vic-
toria, with those parts of South Australia, New South Wales, and Tas-
mania which it includes. The third map shown is on a scale of two
miles to one inch, and is based on the Geodetic survey, which it is to be
regretted was suspended about a year since, on the score of economy
and press of other work. The maps now in process of construction by
the Department on this scale will eventually become the standard
county maps of the colony.
Besides the above, there are some 300 original parish maps repro-
duced annually by the Department. Twenty-five copies in fac simile of
every original map are printed on paper for the public use, and the
original is put away as a record. These, as a rule, are again reduced to
half-scale for sale plans, and a vast number are disposed of at every
land auction at a nominal price, which is, however, sufficient to cover
the cost of production. All these lithographic transfers are obtained by
the well known photo-lithographic process first invented by Mr. J. W.
Osborne, in September, 1859, in Melbourne, and now used all over the
world. Since iB6O this process has been worked with slight modifica-
tions by Mr. J. Noone, the successor of Mr. Osborne, with admirable
facility and exactness.
ADMIRALTY SURVEY CHARTS.
About the year 1855 it was found necessary by the Government to
have surveys made of the principal ports of Victoria. The coasting


trade had become very extensive, and the existing charts were on a
small scale, and not closely sounded. Those in common use had been
constructed from the surveys of Commander Stokes and other naval
officers, and were for the most part what are called il running surveys.
It became necessary to meet a want daily growing in magnitude, and
Commander Ross was accordingly engaged on the special work, which
he carried on for some three or four years. It was then found advisable
to obtain from the Imperial Government a staff of Admiralty Surveyors
and New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania, made the same
proposal. The application from each colony was complied with, and
the stipulation in the case of Victoria was, that until a steamer was
required for the outer soundings, the cost would not be more than
a year, of which the Admiralty agreed to pay half. In iB6O Commander
Cox and his staff of assistants accordingly arrived and proceeded to
make surveys of Port Phillip and Westernport Bays, on a six inch scale.
On the retirement of Commander Cox, the surveys were continued by
Lieutenant Stanley until Commander Wilkinson?s arrival. On that
officers death in 1867, after a temporary charge, which again devolved
on Lieutenant Stanley, Captain Sidney assumed the conduct of the sur-
vey. Finally, on his promotion, Lieutenant Stanley was placed in
charge, and still continues to carry on operations. In 1868, when Com-
mander Stanley became Admiralty Surveyor, the only part of the outer
coast which had been surveyed was from Cape Otway to Cape Wollamai.
By the end of 1873 the coast of Victoria was all surveyed, and a
survey of King s Island made. Without this last the marine survey of
the colony would have been complete in 1872, but it became also
necessary to re-survey the West Channel and the Rip at Port Phillip
Hc3.ds.
In 1874 the West and South Channels were again re-surveyed, and at
the latter part of the same year a survey of Bass?s Strait was com-
menced, the expense being borne conjointly by Victoria, Tasmania,
and the Imperial Government. This piece of work was in progress
when it was suspended for a time by the necessity for a re-survey of
Hobson?s Bay, and this being now complete, the staff will shortly return
to Bass?s Strait.
It follows that in all these operations the trigonometrical survey which
had been carried out under the superintendence of Mr. R. 1,. J. Ellery,
the Government Astronomer, had been of the highest value. The large
amount of useful work thus performed by the Admiralty Survey in Vic-
toria must be self-evident, and has been highly honourable to its con-
ductors.
The countrymen of the distinguished hydrographer, Maury, will well
know how to appreciate such labours, and the seamen of all nations
will not fail to recognise the value of their patient toils. That fruitful
source of disaster at sea?inaccurate charts of the coasts of Australia?
has been greatly diminished, and among the peaceful victories of science
the work of the marine surveyors of Victoria is worthy of record. No
more honourable duty has been performed than that in which Cox and
Wilkinson, Boucher and Gowland fell a sacrifice.


The following is a brief synopsis of the Victorian Admiralty survey:?

GEOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL MAPS.
Amongst the most beautiful of these works of art and utility are the
maps published by the Mining Department, under the superintendence
of Mr. R. Brough Smyth, the Secretary for Mines. These have been
so frequently described in the elaborate publications of the department in
former Exhibitions as to require only a passing reference in this place.
Among them may be named the geological maps of Ballarat, Beech-
worth, the Cape Otway district, the Mitchell River, and Sandhurst dis-
trict; a sketch map of Victoria, showing the distribution of forest trees;
and 64 quarter sheets of various parts of the colony, all of which are
sold at a very moderare price.
GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS.
The diagrams illustrating the Patents issued in Victoria fall within
this head. They are represented in the Exhibition by nine quarto
volumes. From these we gather that the first patent registered in Vic-
toria bears date 9th August, 1854. For two years afterwards only 20
specifications appear to have been deposited. In 1856, however, a new
Patent Law, offering greater facilities to inventors, came into operation,
and the result was a large increase in the applications. Since that time
to the end of July last the number reached 2081.
In 1866 was commenced the compilation of a set of indices in a.
printed form, and upon a plan adopted by the English Patent Office.


The names are arranged alphabetically, the titles chronologically, and
the inventions under headings in accordance with the subject-matter. In
the last-named index short descriptions are given with the view of facili-
tating search. In 1869 these descriptions were largely extended and
illustrated by drawings. In addition to the indices the publication of
the whole of the Victorian specifications in abstract has been com-
menced, the drawings of which are mostly reduced by photo-litho-
graphy.
It is in contemplation to follow up a pamphlet already published on
the processes of food preservation by other volumes, showing the pro-
gress of patented inventions and contrivances bearing upon important
branches of colonial industry. The Patent Office also offers to public
inspection, free of charge, a museum of models, specimens, etc., and
the reports and specifications patented in New South Wales, New Zea-
land, Canada, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the United States.
TELEGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS.
The processes in Telegraphy in Victoria cannot but be highly interest-
ing to visitors at the Philadelphia Exhibition. There is nothing specially
new in the instrument exhibited in Melbourne, but it affords an oppor-
tunity to enumerate a few facts respecting the electric telegraph in
Victoria, and to add another testimony to the value of the system
invented by the illustrious Dr. Morse.
Twenty years ago only 72 miles of telegraph lines were in operation
in Victoria. The colony now possesses 5600 miles of wire, 155 stations,
and 400 instruments, which have cost something like �370,000. This,
compared with the gigantic telegraph systems of the old world, may
appear small, but those who remember the initiation of the project in
1854 may draw an instructive comparison. On the 3rd of March in that
year Mr. Samuel Walker M?Gowan, the present head of the Telegraph
Department, sent from Melbourne to Williamstown the first message over
a line constructed by him. It was received in a little room 8 feet
square, in a building dignified with the name of ? The Observatory,? by
Mr. R. L. J. Ellery, the present Government Astronomer. By the end
of the year Geelong was in communication, and Queenscliff on the 30th
January, 1855. The instrument adopted was Morse?s Recording Tele-
graph, and the cable wire laid across the Saltwater River was constructed
and laid by the Penal Department. The first contract between Mel-
bourne and Williamstown was taken at �193 15s. per mile; that from
Williamstown to Queenscliff at �ll5 15s. per mile. Grove?s nitric acid
battery was used for the main line and Daniell?s local battery for the
instruments.
The extension of telegraphic communication followed with the suc-
ceeding years. In 1857 Melbourne was in connexion with Adelaide,
and in 1858 with Sydney. In 1859 a cable was laid from Cape Otway
to King?s Island, and thence to the coast of Tasmania. This, however,
failed in iB6O. The one now working was laid via Flinders in 1869.


The network of wires gradually extended over the colony. The coast
stations were established at Cape Otway, the Schank, Wilson?s Pro-
montory, Queenscliff, and at all the outposts, whence signals of disasters
at sea have been frequently received. Lines were erected on the routes
of railway of Nos. 6 and 8 gauge of galvanised iron wire. The German
porcelain insulator (No. 5) with screw insulating pin was invariably used.
These lines were constructed at 22 poles to the mile, and these were
chosen from red gum, ironbark, stringybark, or other hard wood.
On the North-Eastern Railway line 120 miles of iron poles have been
recently finished, which, as they are imported from the patentee
Oppenheimer?stand in over each.
Upon all long and important circuits the single current close circuit
system, with the Morse embossing and ink writing instruments (second-
ary action) are used; and upon short and unimportant circuits the
Wheatstone?s alphabetical dial instruments.
Of Morse?s instruments there are 250 in use, of Wheatstone?s 125.
There are 3100 cells in the main battery, 750 cells in the local bat-
tery, total 3850.
Meidinger?s sulphate of magnesia battery, and Chester?s form of
Smee s battery, are both in use for mam batteries. For local batteries
the sulphate of copper battery is chiefly used. For electric bell cir-
cuits, the Leclanche battery is employed.
Over all these lines in Victoria the uniform rate of one shilling for ten
words came into force on Ist January, 1870.
The coast stations report three times each day, passing, arriving, or
departing vessels, state of the weather, etc. Time signals from the Mel-
bourne Observatory for comparison or correction of mean time are
passed over all the lines throughout the colony at 1 p.m. daily. The
clocks at the Railway Stations, in Parliament Houses, at the General
Post-office, and at several clockmakers?, are controlled by the Electric
Clock at the Observatory. The principal railway stations are connected
by telegraph wires, and the arrival and departure of trains notified.
Private telegrams are received from and transmitted to other telegraph
stations. Letters containing telegraphic messages are forwarded from
any post-office (of which there are some 850), to the nearest telegraph
office, without extra fee, and thence transmitted. Franked transmission
form books are also provided. The Department offers inducements to
operators to become expert by a bonus allowance from five per cent, to
fifty per cent, on their salary, and the awards are made annually by a
Board of Examiners appointed for the purpose.
In thinly populated places where a telegraph office is necessary, but
where the business is light and the revenue small, lady operators are
placed in charge.
So well recognised are the advantages of having telegraphic communi-
cation, that in several townships where offices are now open, the depart-
ment is guaranteed against loss by several of the principal residents.
Besides this, private wires are growing very popular. Business men of
all classes, large factories and other establishments, are utilising the
system. The Public Library, the Crown Lands, and the General Post-


office, are all in communication with the fire brigade, and it is intended
to extend these fire alarm signals all over the city.
During the year 1874, the sum of ,�24,134 was expended on the con-
struction and maintenance of the telegraph lines in Victoria.
Before May, 1876, there is every probability that New Zealand will be
in communication with New South Wales, and the West Australian line
from Adelaide is also in course of construction.
In conclusion, to show the marvellous results of electric telegraphy
in the colony, one fact may be cited. Nineteen years ago Messrs.
M?Gowan and Todd ?the latter of whom has since carried a wire
across Australia?in pressing on the various Colonial Governments the
necessity of extending the telegraph system to New South Wales and
South Australia, showed how it would draw closer the relations which
should exist between the principal Colonies, and was still more im-
portant as being a step in the direction of one ultimate telegraphic con-
nexion via India and England, ?a scheme which, vast and difficult as
it may appear, and really is, will, we doubt not, at no very distant day
be carried out.? Turning to the records, we find that during the first
year of telegraphy in Victoria the number of words in press reports
passing over the line was 1546. At 2 p.m. on the 21st July, 1875,
orders were received from the Telegraph Department to place the
Argus newspaper in circuit with Adelaide in contemplation of
the arrival of the English mail steamer. Circuit was completed
at 5.30 p.m., and at 8 p.m. the operators at each end commenced
work. By a quarter to 4 a.m. nearly 20,000 words, filling four-
teen columns of that morning?s paper, had been received and set in
the composing-room. These comprised the whole of the letters of the
London correspondents, dated nth June, and a letter of a German cor-
respondent. Thus a full and complete summary of European intelli-
gence was published at least thirty-six hours before the mail steamer
could be expected to reach Hobson?s Bay, and two clear days in
advance of the time at which the paper could have been published had
the arrival of the steamer been waited for as usual. Since then a still
longer telegram has been received and published by the same office.
Comment would be superfluous: the rival claims of the automatic or
other systems of telegraphy may very well be left for discussion to the
Victorian Telegraph Society or the columns of the London Telegraph
Journal, but the astonishing feat named above stands at present un-
equalled in Australia.
Mr. Charles Todd has been worthily decorated by Her Majesty for
his distinguished services in carrying a line across the island continent
of Australia from Adelaide; but there is little doubt tire Superintendent
of Victorian Telegraphs?Mr. M?Cowan ?must have felt an equal thrill
of satisfaction when receiving the first ?through? message from the Old
World.

IMPLEMENTS OF PRECISION AND APPARATUS OF
PHYSICAL RESEARCH, &c.
The extent to which implements of this kind are manufactured in the
country is not great. At the University, at the Observatory, and at the
Technological Museum, skilled implement makers are employed repairing
and altering instruments, and making new ones, or new parts as circum-
stances demand. In the trade a few skilled men are similarly employed
and among the new articles made by them may be enumerated tele-
scopes and microscopes, barometers and thermometers in great variety
hydrometers and saccharometers, &c. Of these some of the portions
are usually imported. At one time and another instruments of con-
siderable delicacy have been produced in die country, and there are
men in our community quite capable of making them, but they can be
imported more cheaply than they can be made.
. Of imported instruments we have a great many in use. The follow-
ing are the most important of those in use at the Observatory?
1. Transit Circle. Diameter, 4 feet; focal length, 6 feet
2. Great Melbourne Telescope. Cassepain construction; large
mirror, 4 feet in diameter: focal length, feet; small mirror, 8 inches
m diameter: focal length, 74 feet 7 inches.


3. South Equatorial Telescope, 8-inch aperture, 9 feet focal length.
4. North Equatorial Telescope, 4 -inch aperture, 5 feet focal length.
5. Newtonian Reflector, 12 inches diameter, 8 feet focal length.
6. Altazimuth, aperture, 29 inches focal length.
7. Zenith Sector, not used; no dimensions given.
8. Anemograph, or self-recording wind-gauge.
9. Barograph, for recording height of barometer.
10. Thermographs (2), for recording temperature shown by dry and
wet bulb thermometers.
11. Magnetic Theodolite.
Also, seven astronomical clocks, seven box chronometers, and the
usual barometers, thermometers, rain-gauges, &c.
At a great many stations throughout the country meteorological obser-
vations are made and recorded, the results being forwarded periodically
to the Government Astronomer, and by him formulated and published for
the information of the public. At these stations there are barometers,
thermometers, rain-gauges, etc. Similar instruments are also placed at
our seaports for general information and guidance. Our Department of
Customs and Excise is provided with the necessary apparatus for the
examination of spirits and wine, and our Government Analytical Chemist
has a complete laboratory provided with all the necessary apparatus.
In the Departments of Public Lands, of Water Supply, and of Public
Works, there are also beautiful instruments in use. At the Melbourne
branch of the Royal Mint there are many instruments of great beauty
and nicety. In the assaying room there is a balance that weighs to the
thousandth part of a grain, its load being 10 grains. There is also a
physical balance, of which the load is 21b., which weighs to the hun-
dredth part of a grain. This is provided with an apparatus first intro-
duced by Gauss, but improved upon by Mr, Foord, of the Mint, for
shifting the body being weighed from one end of the beam to the other
without opening the glass case in which the whole apparatus is enclosed.
The apparatus used for assaying silver by the humid method, as intro-
duced by Guy Lussac, has been improved upon in our establishment,
and is now highly complete and effective. There are many other beauti-
ful instruments and machines in the Mint, but they do not differ from
similar machines in use elsewhere. Our Microscopical Society has given
a great impetus to the kind of inquiries to which it devotes itself, and
the use of the microscope is now very common in this country both by
professional and amateur investigators. Most of these have been im-
ported, but some have been made in the colony. The most costly have
a magnifying power of 500 diameters, and sell for about 50 guineas. When
the Transit of Venus was coming due, there was a considerable demand for
telescopes, and these were manufactured in numbers in Melbourne and
exported to the other Australian colonies and to New Zealand.
WATCHES, CLOCKS, &c.
There are no chronometers made in the country, but a great many
are repaired and timed. The latter duty is sometimes performed at
the Observatory, but oftener in private establishments. Watches have


been made in the country, but rather as an experiment than in the way
of business, as they can be imported at a cheaper rate. Turret clocks
are made, however, as these have generally to be specially planned
with a view to the requirements of the position they are intended to
occupy. A very fine specimen of this kind of timekeeper is the clock
at the General Post-office. It was designed by Mr. Ellery, the
Government Astronomer, and manufactured in the Government Railway
workshops. It chimes quarters on three melodious bells. It is on the
dead beat projection, and an excellent timekeeper. It is regulated
from the Observatory by electric current. Every day a time-ball is
dropped by the same Means, for the information of ships? officers, clock-
makers, &c. Our railway clocks and other public timekeepers are also
so regulated. Turret clocks are made in Melbourne up to 3 feet dial,
and at a cost, with strike movement, bells, &c., up to Hall and
office clocks are also made in the city in considerable numbers. A
cromoscope in the present Exhibition, made in Melbourne, is a very fine
piece of work.
WEIGHTS, MEASURES, AND COINS.
The weights and measures used in Victoria are the same as are used
in the United Kingdom, from which standards have been obtained at
different times, duly authenticated. These are in charge of different
departments of the Government and of other ruling bodies. Some are
at the Observatory, others at the Mint, and others in the possession of
the City of Melbourne. One of the most important of our standard
measures is a 10-feet base bar, which was used in the geodetic survey
of the colony.
MOSAIC AND INLAID WORK.
Mosaic was a term originally applied to the combination of cubes, or
veneers of various coloured stones in patterns; but it has long ceased to
be thus confined, and is now understood to include all kinds of inlaid
and veneered work in every kind of material.
The art of mosaic was known amongst the Greeks, and was exten-
sively used amongst the Romans for flooring, and for the decoration of
walls; the material ranging through all extremes, from tiles of earthen-
ware, to the costliest marbles, arranged generally in geometric forms, but
frequently culminating, towards the centre, in an elaborate picture. An
incised ornament upon the surface of the marble, filled with a cement
of a contrasting colour, was also of frequent occurrence. In the same
form and for the purpose of flooring the art has been practised down to
our own days, and is almost the only form in which it is known amongst us,
tessellated pavements in which the materials vary from the commonest
tiles to the most elaborate productions of Minton and of Copeland,
being common for the paving of halls, verandahs, &c.
In true mosaic work the whole of the surface is embedded into,
or veneered into, a back ground of baser material; of this sort is


the Venetian, sometimes also called the Byzantine mosaic, speci-
mens of which, for the purpose of personal adornment, are common
in our jewellers? shops; Roman mosaic, in which the tesserae
are composed of thin slips of glass, is essentially a work of
fine, and at the same time most patient art. Such also is
the* Indian mosaic so common as a decoration on workboxes, card-
boxes, cnbbage boards, fans, and the like; the material in this in-
stance being ivory, a white metal, and a pale green opaque stone. A
form of mosaic extensively used in Russia for wall and surface decora-
tion might not inappropriately be practised amongst us, as the material,
malachite, is produced in the neighbouring colony of South Australia.
In this the forms are not geometric, the art being to arrange the pieces
so as to run the dark green contour lines of one piece into those of
another, producing an effect not unlike the intricate markings of knotted
wood. , , _ . .
Florentine mosaic, the pietra dura of the Italians, can also be seen in
our jewellers? shops, worked up into articles of personal adornment. In
this form of the art the groundwork is a thin slab of marble, generally
black, on which the pattern to be wrought, generally foliage, flowers, or
insects, is outlined, and then chased out to a depth of about the fortieth
of an inch. Into these depressions the inlaying material, already polished
and finished, is worked to the required shape by the ordinary processes
of gem-cutting. The stones generally used are the pseudo gems, such
as varieties of quartz, agate, jasper, lapis lazuli, chalcedons and cornelian,
and these are worked to that exquisite degree of nicety that in good
specimens the joints cannot be detected by the naked eye, for the
depressions are not fitted simply with one piece, a petal of a flower, foi
instance, being simulated by perhaps half a dozen different pieces
changing the colour by the most exquisite gradations.
A variety of the Florentine mosaic, both in detail of manufacture and
similarity of design, has been acclimatised in Derbyshire, where the
manufacture was fostered by the late Duke of Devonshire, who placed
his fine collection of Florentine work at the disposal of the native artists
for the purposes of study. In lieu, however, of the hard stone, which
can only be cut by the lapidary, the Derbyshire mosaic is inlaid with
the native spar and marbles, shell, glass, cement, &c. On account of its
comparatively low price it is frequently palmed off on the inexperienced
as real Florentine.
Of late years Glass mosaic, in imitation of the old Venetian w r ork, has
been reintroduced, and has been extensively used in large works at the
South Kensington Museum under the direction of Dr. Salviati.
jyfarquetry is that form of mosaic in w'hich the effect is produced by
woods of different colours, and was first used as early as the fourteenth
century by the Italians, amongst whom it was known as tassia work.
By them it was chiefly applied to the decoration of furniture. At first
the attempts in this direction of art were confined to the production of
a w r hite pattern on a black ground, the process being almost identical
with that described for Florentine mosaic, the material being generally
ebony for the groundwork, whilst the figures were w r orked in a w r hite wood,
sometimes in ivory. Simple as this w T as, by force of contrast of colour,


by artistic design, and by precision of pattern, this primitive marquetry
became a very efficient decoration.
By the beginning of the fifteenth century, however, the process had
undergone a marked change; the whole surface was covered with a
mosaic of wood, and its artists had succeeded, by the use of penetrating
oil and of colours boiled in water, in staining the wood with tints suffi-
ciently varied to indicate the foliage of trees, the clearness of water, and
even those gradations of tint which produce the effect of distance, and
at a still later period the brilliant tints of fruits and flowers were repro-
duced. The introduction of stained wood was, however, always looked
upon as somewhat irregular, and within the last century there has been a
decided return to that development of the art which seeks to produce its
effect by the employment of woods in their natural colours, and which
frames its designs on a geometric pattern.
Immediately connected with marquetry is the process of parquetry,
which, designed upon the same principle, is carried out on altogether a
bolder scale. Like marquetry, it is of foreign growth, but has of late
years been introduced into England, where it is now much used, par-
quetry floors being supplied at a price not much greater per superficial
yard than a good Brussels carpet. Parquetry is always constructed on a
geometric pattern, in some instances only one wood being used, whilst in
others as many as four, or even five, are introduced. In those patterns
where only one kind of wood is applied, the design depends for
a portion of its effect on the sharply defined outline of the tesserse,
which are so placed that the grain of wood appears to interlace.
The manufacture of parquetry is one of the mechanical arts which
ought to find a home amongst us, as parquetry floors are admirably
suited to the climate, whilst no better material could be found than some
of our colonial woods, properly seasoned.
Buhl is another process of marquetry in which the metals, generally
the gilt bronze known as ormolu, are inlaid upon grounds of tortoise-
shell or ebony, and vice versa. This work took its name from two French
cabinetmakers?father and son ?who designed most of the furniture at
Versailles.
The present Exhibition will be found rich in inlaid woods, in conse-
quence of the magnificent specimens exhibited in the Japanese Court, in
which the inlaying is rich with those specimens of harmonious composi-
tion which seem to result from the very abandonment of design, but
which are really the result of an intuitive perception of some of the most
subtle laws of composition, of proportion, and of balance of parts.
A beautiful form of inlaying applied to small articles, in which the in-
laying, or rather veneering, is coloured straw, will also be found in the
Japanese Court, and will be found well worthy of attentive study, the
patterns being most effective, and the colouring rich and at the same
time harmonious.
DECORATION AND FURNISHING OF INTERIORS OF
DWELLINGS AND OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The subject of interior decoration and furnishing has so wide a range,
that it would be perfectly impracticable, within the limits of a volume


such as this, to do more than sketch the rise and progress of the two
kindred arts, so that it would be but idle labour which should attempt to
deal exhaustively with them in an essay of a few pages. The task, how-
ever, is considerably lightened when, leaving furniture to the place into
which it more properly falls (Jury 14), our attention is simply confined
to interior decoration as it is known and practised amongst ourselves, and
to a few of the essential rules which should determine its application.
Before proceeding further, however, it is necessary to keep sight of one
or two important principles. Ihese are ?that to be beautiful, an object
must fitly answer the purpose for which it has been designed, that utility
must precede beauty; that all true decoration is the decoration of con-
structive necessities only, and that no one material should attempt to
arrive at a result which can only be perfectly done by another.
The ordinary basis of all internal decoration of a high class in the
present day is stone or wood, and of these the modes of treatment are
as various and as manifold as the applications of art. Leaving behind us,
then, the nobly framed, moulded, and carved ceilings of an Elizabethan
mansion, or the earlier use of wood for wainscoating, as being almost
obsolete, and as having been displaced for all work except that of the
very highest order by plaster, which is, we might say, the base of all inter-
nal decoration as practised amongst us, we propose to confine our remarks
wholly to that material, simply premising that the rules of harmonious
colouring, the laws of contrast and of surface ornament, are equally
applicable to wall-papers.
The art of making a smooth surface on walls by plaster was not only
known to the Greeks and Romans, but was practised by the latter people
in Britain. The art, however, appears to have been lost during the dark
ages, to reappear amongst the mediaeval architects both in England and
on the Continent of Europe about the twelfth century. Its operations are,
however, so well known that a description of them here may w ell be
spared. In that portion of the plasterer?s work which falls within our
province, the decorative portion, the basis of the whole is sulphate of
lime, or gypsum ?whether simply burned and slacked in the same manner
as ordinary lime, in which state it is known as Plaster-of-Paris; or com-
bined during certain stages of its manufacture with borax, in which case
it is known as Parian; or with alum, in which case it forms Keene?s
Cement, the last being the material chiefly in use for highly-finished
plaster-work amongst us.
is scarcely the place in which to go into the oft-debated Question
of the use or misuse of plaster. To borrow the words of one of the
principal architects of the age, Sir G. G. Scott, ?no material has either so
sinned, or been sinned against.? It has, however, its legitimate use as a
vehicle for art, namely, to cover plain surface, or surface broken with
incised ornament depending for effect on artistic outline, or surface
diapered in low relief. It passes beyond a legitimate use when on either
wall or ceiling it simulates a construction in either stone or wood. But
in this, which has been characterised as an age of shams, the use of
plaster'has been too deeply engrained in our building system as a vehicle
for ornament to be easily got rid of, so that perhaps the best thing to do


is to suggest the means by which it can be rendered effective, and most
readily made to serve as the ground for the labour of the decorative
artist, to whose work we now pass.
The simplest and most mechanical form of the work of the House
Decorator is that known as paperhanging. Its more advanced form is
such wall decoration as that of the large Hall and the Rotunda of this
Exhibition, each being the work of different artists, but guided by the
same principles; the most pronounced form of the art amongst us
being the decoration of the large room of the Melbourne Town Hall.
This style of internal decoration has only been revived of late years,
and has in some instances been carried to extravagant extremes, as was
but natural when it is remembered that it is but the reaction from the
theory which considered the classic form so complete that the extension
of colour was a direct departure from good taste. In its better
development the style may be said to have been popularised by the late
Mr. Owen Jones, and like all that is true and genuine in art it readily
adapted itself to every variety of style, being equally effective in connection
with the most severe classic, as with the most elastic Gothic, the
character and form of the ornament alone being altered. The harmony
of the colouring being founded on the laws of nature, like these laws
survives every change of style, adorning and beautifying all. The two
essentials of the style are involved in beautiful form of flat-painted
decoration, and harmonious colouring. There is generally a conventional
method of representing a botanical form like the Grecian honeysuckle,
or a rigidly mechanical form like the Grecian feet, in monotone, or in gold,
so that it relies for its effect on grace of outline rather than on the beauty
which is derived from the blending of colours, or from the effects of light
and shade. In choosing the form, preference should be given to those
figures which consist of two corresponding halves on each side of a
vertical centre, and those intended for vertical surfaces should have a
distinct top and bottom, or right side upwards; whilst for a horizontal
surface the principal ornament should consist of members radiating from
a common centre.
The principles which govern harmonious colouring are as old as the
hills, and although they come intuitively to some natures, so that we find
their results amongst the ornaments of the most savage tribes as in the art
of the most cultivated nations, they are really founded on the most rigid
and exact laws. Colour has its source in light, for by the decomposition
of light we obtain colour, which science tells us exists in light in the pro-
portions of 3 of yellow to 5 of red, and to 8 of blue, and all systems
of colouring, whether worked out in the primaries, the secondaries, or
the tertiaries, or in some of the multitudinous compounds of which they
are capable, are harmonious only in so far as they preserve the three
primary colours in these relative proportions.
However, harmony does not necessarily exclude contrast, and some of
the most artistic effects in surface decorations are the result of bold, nay
almost daring contrasts of colour, but so applied as not to destroy the
harmonious balance of the whole composition. The laws of contrast,
however, are but imperfectly understood, and a few of the golden


maxims relating to it promulgated by the great master of this develop-
ment of art may not inappropriately close this essay:?
?When ornaments in a colour are on a ground of a contrasting colour,
the ornament should be separated from the ground by an edging of
lighter colour ?as a red flower on a green ground should have an edging
of lighter red.
?When ornaments in a colour are on a gold ground, the ornaments
should be separated from the ground by an edging of a darker colour.
?Gold ornaments on any coloured ground should be outlined with
black.
?Ornaments of any colour may be separated from grounds of any
other colour by edgings of white, gold, or black.
?Ornaments in any colour, or in gold, may be used on white or black
grounds, without outline or edging.
?In ?self-tints/ tones, or shades of the same colour, a light tint on a
dark ground may be used without outline; but a dark ornament on a
light ground requires to be outlined with a still darker tint.?

But comparatively a few years have elapsed since Australian Art emerged
from its swaddling clothes. The first stage of its progress has been as
marvellously rapid as the growth of the magic shrub germinating from
the tiny seed sown by the cunning hand of the Oriental juggler. The
promise which the efforts of infancy, bold in their crudeness, artistic in
their very simplicity, gave of blossoming into the talent of adolescence,
has been fulfilled, and anew a promise of the true genius of mature
manhood is held out. Australian Art can as yet be scarcely said to
possess a history, but it can fairly lay claim to a distinctive character of
its own. Public taste, too, has been steadily undergoing a course of art
education. The National Gallery was the primer out of which a great pro-
portion of Victorians were first initiated into the mysteries of the artistic
alphabet, while the collections that love of art or the spirit of speculation
have tempted private individuals to accumulate, have been the lesson
books by which the course has been further continued. These first stages
in the way of knowledge have been highly beneficial. A just appreciation
of nature?s wonders, human imagination and artistic ideality has been
awakened; admiration for the beauties of art has been engendered,
and art patrons have become a reality. Thus public taste has aided
Victorian art in its struggles to emancipate itself from prehistoric dark-
ness, and the liberality of patrons has stimulated its devotees to that per-
severance and study without which even heaven-born genius can achieve
but a comparatively small success.
The exhibitions under the auspices of the Victorian Academy of
Arts have also been most beneficial. Artists have entered into a
friendly competition with brother artists, and by exhibiting their works
have challenged criticism. This in itself is an advantage, as it
stimulates emulation, and calls attention to the beauties and defects of
the works of each individual painter. Art criticism here is, however, in
its infancy, and critics are too prone to deal in generalities, to refer
to the old masters, and to dip too deeply into the pages of Pilkington;
as a rule, every brown-faced Madonna or dusky-hued beggar-boy is
in their eyes a Murillo, a pallid blueish-complexioned saint a Guido;
?dark inscrutable pictures relieved by dabs of the palette knife here and
there are dignified as bearing the impress of the genius of Salvator
Rosa; who other than Hondykoter could have put those dainty touches
into the ruffled feathers of that group of domestic fowls; every battle-
"cene in which a white horse is prominent is set down as a Wouverman?s;


every glowing sunset is a Turner, and every canvas upon which the
varied aspects of the sea are depicted is assumed to be a Melby. There
is far too much reliance placed upon these landmarks of painting, and
critics have yet to spring up who, with every veneration for byegone works
of art and masters of other countries, will be content to criticise Victorian
artists upon their own individual merits. This is wanting, but such criti-
cism as we have is better than none at all, and has been productive of
good results.
Amongst the ranks of Victorian artists in oils, M. Buvelot stands
unrivalled as a paysagiste. He follows closely the footsteps of a school
adopted by two modern compatriots, who, however, are little known out
of France. As delineators of French scenery, the names of Millet and
Corot have become as familiar as household words in the country that
gave them birth. The beauties and eccentricities of nature, the novelty
of atmospheric effects, the gloriously-blended tints of summer time, and
the calm grey tone of winter have been wonderfully depicted by these
two artists. And what they have done for France M. Buvelot is doing
for Victoria. Nature is the fount from whence he draws his inspiration.
Amidst the towering gums of the Australian forest, he finds material for
his canvas; the bush track, the winding creek, the tortuous Yarra, the
rugged slopes of basaltic hills are reproduced witli unerring faithfulness
and skill, surrounded with the halo of Nature?s realistic poetry that gives
to his pictures life and soul. How faithfully is depicted the knarled
giant of the forest. It could not be mistaken for anything but one of
the tribe of the Australian Eucalypti. How wonderfully, too, has the
changing colour of the bluegum been caught! What Victorian meeting
with ?The Water-hole at Coleraine? in a far-off land would not pick it
out at once amidst thousands of paintings as a pure bit of Australian
scenery, to be looked at for hours, and in which the longer looked at new
beauties, new distinctive characteristics, of Victorian scenery and wood-
land effect are to be discovered. M. Buvelot excels, too, in the manner
in which he treats the luminous atmosphere of Australia. The soft trans-
parent mist that hangs about his ?Summer?s Morning,? and his winter
effects, bespeak the artist and the true student of nature.
M. Eugene von Guerard is a most painstaking artist, given, it is
true, to a pre-Raphaelistic precision in detail, which detracts from the
undoubted merits of his paintings. The coast scenery, the hills and
plains of Australia have been in them faithfully represented.
Another aspirant for fame as a delineator of Australian scenery is Mr.
Isaac Whitehead, who, during the last three or four years, has made
wonderful progress, and may now be said to be most successful in repro-
ducing upon canvas the distinctive features of the scenery he pourtrays.
A prolific paysagiste is Mr. H. L. Van den Houten, whose performances
are most unequal. Many of his bush scenes have, however, the impress
of a close adherence to nature. Mr. T. Wright is another delineator of
Victorian scenery who is well known and is appreciated as he deserves.
Careless he is at times, but at times he rises to excellency. Mr. H. J.
Johnstone is decidedly a rising artist, and if it be considered how compara-
tively short is the time since he first began to exhibit, it must be con-
ceded that he made great progress. Mr. Johnstone combines delicacy


of touch with a true eye for colour, and is very felicitous in reproducing the
characteristics of Australian scenery. Mr. J. W. Curtis decidedly has
merit, but his pictures are generally too sombre to find many admirers.
He is the Australian Jencault, and although his pictures do not present
the horrors of ?Death on the Raft,? they are tinged with a melancholy
and uniform tint of coldness and desolation that are sometimes worked
up with really artistic effect.
It is to be deplored that an almost total absence of figure painting
exists in Victoria. _ Mr. Chester Earles is the only artist in oils who
may be said to paint figures. His heads of women, while being well
painted, betray a faulty conception of the character he meant to pour-
tray. This was noticeably so in his ?Beatrice? and ?Katherine.? One
missed the flashing yet maidenly eyes, the pouting lips, and the scornful
brow of the vivacious coquette, that made such havoc xvith poor Be-
nedict, Just as are missed the characteristic traits of the shrewish
?Kate.? As artists who deserve to be mentioned in connection with
Victoria, are Mr. Wm. Ford and the Misses Livingstone and
ton. These two ladies are the best copyists that we have. It may
not be quite fair to claim Mr. Gully as a Victorian artist, but certainly
he is appreciated here and belongs to Australia. As a water-colourist he
stands pre-eminent in this quarter of the globe. His subjects are all taken
from New Zealand, and certainly he has been most happy in reproducing
the boldand imposing scenery of that colony. Mrs. George Parsons is a
water-colourist of no mean merit. This lady possesses a boldness and
dash of treatment, and it is quite refreshing to see the effects she brings
out with her broad washes after the insignificant stippeling employed bv
the majority of artists. 1 J y
The Schools at the National Gallery possess pupils who give promise
of talent, and some of the work of those who are studying from the
round and devoting themselves to anatomical drawing points to a
decided progress in this branch of art.
Lithography in all its branches, viewed as a fine art, finds a home in
Victoria, and the specimens that are exhibited will prove to what per-
fection it has been brought here. y
The representative of the Plastic Art is Mr. M'Kennal, who as a
modeller, has executed a variety of works in a truly artistic manner
His ?Horses of Phaeton? is a production that at once stamps him as an
artist. Sculpture is not well represented. However, in the Exhibition
will be found a marble figure of. ? Prayer,? the figure and the marble
from which the statue and pedestal are cut being sculptured and manu-
factured in the colony.
The art of Illumination has also its representative in the person of
Mr. R. Shepherd, who possesses originality of design, an artistic touch
and an eye for the harmony of colours. We stand in wonderment over
the decorations of middle-age missals, and grow enthusiastic over the
excellence of monkish skill in the art of illuminating, but at the same
time an inspection of the works of modern artists such as Mr. Shepherd
will afford proof that illumination, if not now so much in vogue as in the
times of early Christianity, is still an art that has not fallen into
oblivion.


The science of Photography has of late years made rapid strides from
an art point of view, and our local photographers have kept pace with the
times. The photographs taken by Mr. Noone, of the Crown Lands Office,
are choice specimens of the art. The ateliers of Messrs. Johnstone and
O?Shannessy, Mayall, Batchelder, Chuck, and Botteril, have made names
for them in portraiture, whether plain photographs, or tinted, or coloured
in oils. Landscape scenery and architecture are felicitously handled
by Mr. Nettleton, whose latest achievement has been the reproduction
by photography of various pictures in the National Gallery by the order
of the trustees. The work has been well executed, and the result is a
decided triumph for photography, as the means of obtaining a me-
mento of the art, and disseminating a knowledge of the art treasures we
possess.
Amongst the objects of Miscellaneous Art which will, no doubt, attract
notice, are carved wood, frames of leather composed of grapes, fruits, and
flowers, cases of stuffed birds and fancy work in feathers, wax and wool,
and other exhibits, which will be found duly chronicled in the Catalogue.

The groups of subjects arranged under this heading are not of a
character that admits of the exhibition of illustrative objects to any
appreciable extent. In the absence of exhibits, therefore, we must
content ourselves with some general descriptions and statistics of an
explanatory nature.
Group 100.?PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND
CONDITION.
This group was meant to include exhibits having reference to the
Nursery and its accessories, Gymnasiums for athletic exercises, manty
sports, the practical means in general use for rendering Dwellings com-
fortable and healthy, and the accommodation supplied by Hotels, Baths,
and other institutions w T hich minister to the daily physical wants of a
civilised people. It is obvious there are no portable objects suitable for
transport to an Industrial Exhibition in a distant foreign country which
could throw any special light, or convey any instructive information,
upon the habits and condition of Victorian society as viewed from the
standpoint of this group. The management of the Nursery, for instance,
and its requisites are pretty much the same here as they are in every
other English-speaking country. Gymnasiums, in like manner?of
which there are several private establishments both in Melbourne and
some of our principal towns?are with us what they are with European
and American countries, as well in their appliances as in the use made
of them. Gymnastic exercises are not, indeed, so much in vogue with
our population as might be desired, especially as regards the young and
the children of the public schools; but they are practised hy the latter
to some extent. Active manly sports in the open air, however, such


as cricket, football, boating-, and competitive contests in rowing-, swim-
ming-, and, we may add, ride matches and military drill amongst the
volunteers, are much in favour with our young people. The great
mildness and salubrity of the climate of Victoria conduce very much
to encourage the universal practice of all these forms of invigorating
physical exercise in the open air; and they are all entered into with
such zest by the youth of the country that it is quite certain the future
generations of Victoria will exhibit no decline from the parent stock
in physical development, or in bodily vigour and activity. The dry,
elastic, stimulating atmosphere and the bright sunshine give to out-of-
door athletic sports a charm for the young that has all the intensity of a
passion, just as it -was in classic Greece of old, and from the same cause;
and here at the present day, as it was in the land of the Isthmian
?Games in early times, the beauty and mildness of the climate impel
the young, as it were, to those active sports which insure strength of
muscle and a robust constitution. The naturally temperate habits of
all native-born Australians?a result doubtless also due to climate?
conduce likewise to this love of energetic exertion in the open air. In
fact, properly to convey an idea of the ??physical development and con-
dition ? of the people of Victoria, the exhibition to be presented should
be the display that is to be witnessed at one of our great competitive
cricket matches. For that purpose, however, the student of sociology
must resort, not to Philadelphia, but to Melbourne.
BATHS.
With respect to Baths, the employment of this source of health is
almost universal, especially in Melbourne and most of the chief towns,
where the houses are generally provided with the means for that pur-
pose. There are also in Melbourne public and private bathing establish-
ments, in which the warm bath, the Turkish bath, vapour and shower
baths, are all to be had at moderate charges. There is likewise a free
public swimming bath on the banks of the Yarra, and with respect to
sea-bathing, there are few cities in the world better supplied tvith
facilities than our metropolis and all the localities situated on the shores
of Hobson?s Bay. At one of the popular sea-bathing establishments
in the suburb of St. Kilda, it is a common occurrence on the evening
?of a hot-wind day in summer to see 500 or 600 persons at a time
refreshing their heated frames in the briny waters. Indeed, sea-bathing
is universal with all classes throughout the protracted duration of the
summer season.
HOTELS.
By a strange misuse of terms, the appellation ? hotel? is given to all
public-houses in Victoria, although there are not many of these which
properly answer to this description in the European sense of the word,
and none according to the American meaning. They are for the most
part what are properly called public-houses for the sale of spirituous
and fermented liquors, and relying chiefly on their bar trade for sup-
port. The number of these houses in Melbourne and in all the towns

of the country is very great. All are obliged to provide accommoda-
tion for travellers, and a*e in that respect somewhat analogous to inns
in the United Kingdom. But the hotels properly so-called,are estab-
lishments of a very different order, and furnish superior accommodation
of a most unexceptionable kind to the better class of travellers and a
limited number of boarders. There are several of these in Melbourne,
Ballarat, and Sandhurst, and, in a word, in all the principal towns.
Boarding establishments on a vast scale designated hotels, which are
such a distinguishing characteristic of the cities in the United States,
have no existence in the Australian colonies. The domestic habits of the
people are not favourable to such institutions. Families prefer the privacy
and comfort of their own independent dwellings, and such unmarried
people as have not made a home for themselves usually live in private
boarding-houses, which accommodate only a few inmates each, perhaps
about six or eight at the utmost. In a word, the state of matters in
Victoria, and in all the Australian colonies with respect to hotels,
public-houses, and boarding establishments, Ac., is an exact reflex of
what is to he found in this respect in the United Kingdom. There is
one exceptional feature, however, which is almost peculiar to Victoria.
This is the existence of a large number of Wine Shops, where nothing
but Australian wine is sold, at various prices, according to quality, from
2d. to 6d. a tumbler. These establishments, which only came into
existence about 10 years ago, are now very numerous, especially in
Melbourne and its suburbs, and tend very much to popularise the con-
sumption of Victorian wine, greatly to the health and sobriety of the
humbler classes, who patronise them.
Group 101.?MEDICINE AND SANITARY.
Group 102.?BENEVOLENCE.
There are few communities better supplied, in proportion to the
numbers of the population, than the people of Victoria are, with insti-
tutions both for the curative treatment of disease and suffering in all
forms, and the relief of the helpless poor, whether aged or infirm, or
neglected and orphan children. These institutions are supported partly
by voluntary contributions and subscriptions from the public, and partly
by annual grants of money made by the Legislature. These latter, for
the financial year 1875-6, classified under their respective heads, were
as follows, viz.:?


As the subscriptions and donations from the public, every year, form
the basis, and usually reach to about the one-half, of the sum granted
annually by the Parliament, that is, in the present instance, about
�135 000, the amount available in the present year (1875-0) for the
hospital relief or cure, and the maintenance, temporary or permanent
of the afflicted poor and destitute, is no less than �404,000 in round
numbers. Thus a payment of something over 10s. per head per annum
for every man, woman, and child in the colony is contributed to the
work of public charity, independently of numerous undertakings of
private benevolence wliich are well supported. Amongst the various
modes adopted for adding to the funds derived from public beneficence,
the establishment, a couple of years back, of what is known as the
�Hospital Sunday,? has been most successful. On one special Sunday,
previously nominated for the purpose in each year, all the churches and
chapels of every religious denomination make a special collection from
their cono-regations assembled for Divine service, and the aggregate of
the sums� thus collected are paid into a fund, which is subsequently
distributed in certain proportions amongst the several institutions formed
for the relief of bodily suffering and disease. The sum collected in this
way last year (1874)" amounted to �5408.
THE CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS
Of Victoria are not only numerous, but are of the most diversified char-
acter givin�? succour to all forms of human distress, providing asylums
and schools for the deaf and dumb, for the blind, for orphans, and for
neglected or criminal children, hospitals for the insane, houses of refuge
for?the destitute, retreats for fallen women, infirmaries and dispensaries
for the poor, lying-in-hospitals, ladies? benevolent societies (the latter
very numerous), Dorcas societies, together with public hospitals for the
treatment of disease and casualties, and minor establishments also of a
curative character, and having some specialty, such as the Eye and Ear
Institution, the Homoeopathic Dispensary, etc. When it is mentioned
that all these in the aggregate, amount to upwards of eighty institutions,
and that of these thirty are public hospitals, it will be seen that a
detailed notice of them is not here possible. Nor, indeed, is it necessary,
in order to convey an adequate idea of the vitality with which an active
spirit of benevolence is at work amongst our community, inasmuch as
the mere statement of the numbers, and distinctive characters of these
establishments is sufficient to show the varied and comprehensive man-
ner in which the calls of charity are practically responded to by our
population. It will be sufficient to furnish some details and statistics
relatino- to the principal institutions, since all those of minor importance
are formed upon their model, as far as circumstances admit. This
remark especially applies to the
HOSPITALS.
Amono-st the charitable institutions of the country the Hospitals
claim the first rank. The hardships and exposure, the excitement
and disappointment, incident to life on the gold-fields, aggravated often


by intemperance and utter neglect of the laws of health by those
engaged m the feverish search after the precious metal, together with
the frequent occurrence of mining- accidents?all develop
at an early stag-e of the gold discovery a large amount of sickness and
human suffering and distress of various kinds at the great minino-
centres The public, however, quickly recognised the necessity for
hospital accommodation and in conjunction with the Government took
steps to furnish an adequate supply. Hence it has come to pass
that an hospital both for the surgical and general medical treatment
of disease, has become an adjunct to every mining township in the
country, as well as to each of the more early settled localities, which
date their origin prior to the gold-fields era.
What the faculty? and the educated public, whether in the
United States or Europe, will be desirous of learning with respect to
these institutions is not mere historical or financial details relative to
them foundation, but the evidence they afford of the state of the healing-
art in this newest of the new countries of the world. The information
statistical and otherwise, which we propose to give with regard to the
two principal hospitals of the colony which are situated in' Melbourne
will, we think, fully justify the conclusion that we venture to submit?
namely, that the curative treatment of disease whether in the hands of
the physician or surgeon will be seen to have reached a point of per-
fection both scientific and practical, in this region of Australia, equal
to what is witnessed m the oldest and most civilised countries ofVe
world. The hospita sin the mining and the rural districts are, of course
on a very much smaller scale than those in Melbourne. But the skill
of the professional staff in each of the latter finds its fair reflex amount
tle medmal officers of the former; and in furnishing statistical details
of the numerous and varied cases dealt with in the Melbourne institu-
tions, we are also illustrating the character and success of the profes-
sional work accomplished in the country hospitals, though of course in
amount this work necessarily falls below what is achieved in the We
?establishments of the metropolis. Chief amongst these is? �
The Melbourne Hospital.
This noble institution, which is the largest and most important of the
Hospitals of Victoria, stands within its own grounds in the heart of
he ci y It was founded in the year 1816, when Melbourne wasbut
a small town, with comparatively few inhabitants. Of modest dimen
sions at first, it has grown with the growth of the city and has now
become an extensive establishment, of great capacity for the relief of
inman suffering and of stately proportions. It is supported partly bv
subscriptions and contributions from the public, and partly by an
annual grant of money from the State. The conduct of its ?affairs is
under the control of an elective Committee of Manaoement whose
members meet weekly, together with a resident secretary who is a
salarmd officer. The chief office-bearers are the Patron who is
usuaHy the Governor of the colony; the president, vice-president
m4ee reaSU T�e Vh . 0 e are i 8 honor 1 as * ell as members of com-
mittee. Ihere are also counsel, solicitor, and auditors. The pro-


fessional staff is composed partly of honorary and partly of paid
officers. It consists of four physicians and four assistant-physicians,,
four surgeons and four assistant-surgeons, a resident physician, and a
resident surgeon, a pathologist, a dispenser and assistant-dispensers r
together with matron, nurses, &c.
Objects of the Institution.
The objects of the Melbourne Hospital are, in the first place, to-
afford medical and surgical aid to poor persons requiring it, and foi
treatment of casualties; hut no person found able to pay for aid
receives further than temporary assistance. And in the next place, to
serve as a practical school of medicine and surgery, in which capacity
it is affiliated to the Melbourne University.
Admission of In-Patients and Out-Patients.
Patients are admitted on Tuesdays and Fridays at half-past eleven
o?clock. . . ,
All sick persons are admissible as in-patients, on the recommendation
of a contributor, provided they appear to the Committee of Manage-
ment as proper objects of charity; and that the physician or surgeon
of the. week reports that they are likely to receive benefit by treatment
in the Hospital. , . ,
Accidents and cases of emergency are at all times admissible without
letters of recommendation, where delay might prove dangerous
The Committee may admit articled seamen on payment of dos. per
week, or in that proportion, on the order of the Shipping Master of the
port, countersigned by the captain or agent of the vessel, in accordance
with an agreement made with the Government.
No lunatic, or person having the small-pox, or person suffering from
chronic epilepsy, or from ulcerated legs of long standing, or pregnant
female for the purpose of confinement, or person whose case might be
equally relieved as an out-patient, is deemed a proper case for admis-
sion as an in-patient. . ,
Whenever the applications for admission are more than can be ac-
commodated in the house, the most urgent cases only are admitted.
Convalescent Fund.
There is also established a small Convalescent Fund, for the purpose
of affording casual relief to destitute patients in certain cases, and also*
for providing' chang'e of air in cases of convalescence.
The Convalescent Fund is applied by the Committee of Management
towards the following objects: ? > .
1. To defray the expenses of patients going to the seaside or the
country, and, when necessary, of boarding them.
2. To the purchase of clothing. ,
3. To defray the expenses of removing patients to their homes.
4 To supplying small sums of money to patients leaving the house
to assist in maintaining them until they are able to return to their
� T s* To providing, wholly or in part, trusses or other surgical instru-
ments or appliances for persons unable to provide themselves with the
same.


Nature and Extent of Hospital Work, 1874.
The number of cases treated during- the year 1874 was 26,037; of
this number 22,130 received treatment as out-door patients and casual-
ties, and 3907 were received into the Hospital. Of these, 3059 were
discharged cured or relieved, 535 died, and 313 remained in the insti-
tution on the 31st of December.
Financial.
For the year ending December 31, 1874, exclusive of bequests, the
ordinary receipts on account of the maintenance-fund amounted to
�5321 2s. 2d., in addition to which the sum of �2357 9s. 9d. was
received from the Committee of Management of the Hospital Sunday
Fund. These, together with the votes of the Legislature of �l5 000
made a total of �22,679 Is. lid.
The expenditure for the year amounted to �22,370 17s. 10d., which
with the debit balance of �2962 19s. from the previous year, made a
total of �25,333 16s. lOd. The building-fund had, at the com-
mencement of the year, a credit balance of �1721 7s. 2d.; this sum
was augmented by subscriptions and donations amounting? to �834.
The expenditure for sundry alterations and improvements to the out-
patients? department and other parts of the building was �264 16s 3d
leaving a balance in hand of �2290 10s. lid., which the Committee
proposed to expend upon the erection of a new laundry and other
works urgently required.
The balance to the credit of the endowment fund at the date of the
previous year?s report was �3449 16s. sd. During the year 1874,
benefactions were received in various sums of �3OO, �5, and
�l2O ss. 2d. respectively; and in bequests of �6O, �5, and �2O each
from deceased patients; and from others of �5O, and �lO 17s. 8d
These amounts, with interest, �244 6s. 3d., make a balance of
�4265 6s. 6d.
Amongst the donations acknowledged are two of? �lOO each from
the Chinese Pak Cup Pew Trading- Company.
THE ALFRED HOSPITAL.
This establishment ranks next in importance to the Melbourne Hos-
pital. It was founded in commemoration of the visit of His Royal
Highness Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburg-h, to the Australian Colo-
nies some few years back. It is a handsome building-, pleasantly
situated in one of the fine parks lying to the south of the city, and the
site has the advantage of being open to the healthful sea-breezes, which
now in from the bay about a mile distant. The photograph sent to
the present Exhibition gives a good view of the building and the
grounds in which it stands.
The hospital is iinder the control of a president, and a Board of
Management consisting of 15 members, together with a treasurer and
paid secretary. The professional honorary staff consists of three phy-
sicians and three surgeons attending in-patients, and of two physicians
and two surgeons attending out-patients, together with a paid resident


medical officer and a dispenser. There is also a matron, and the usual
corps of nurses and male and female attendants.
Kecent though the foundation of the institution is, it has already
proved a great boon to the afflicted poor, whether suffering from the
special ailments of disease, or from accidents, especially in those
quarters of the suburbs which were found to he inconveniently remote
from the Melbourne Hospital; and its usefulness is yearly on the
increase. ? , _ . ?, r
From the Fourth Annual Report of the Board of Management we
learn that the number of patients cured and relieved was greatly in
excess of that in the previous year; whilst the death-rate was much
lower, being only 8 l / 9 per cent., against IU/is per cent, in the year
1873. The following tables indicate the number of patients attended
to: ?

Out of the 83 deaths, 71 cases were in an incurable or dying state on
admission to the wards.
The number of in-patients treated during 1874 was 148 in excess of
the year previous, and the out-patients 51. There was a decrease in
the number of casualties of 308; this arose in consequence of the great
care in preventing imposition on the part of many persons who had
applied for relief without presenting any order or recommendation,
l I? � * l * _ _ l A. 1.. i, i.l . AWW WWW AM A M /l Artll 4* /"V
and whose appearance indicated that they were not destitute.
The number of prescriptions dispensed during the year was 21,152,
the cost of drugs having been 2fd. for each prescription.
The number of patients treated in 1874 shows that the demand for
hospital assistance is on the increase. The hospital at times was so full
(the male wards mere particularly) that many cases had unavoidably
been refused admission from want of accommodation. The daily average
for the last six months of the year of in-door male patients was 62,
whilst the total number of beds in the male wards was 64. It is thus
apparent how small a margin remains for emergencies. Under these
circumstances, it is considered the time is approaching when it will be


necessary to enlarge the building, and the Managers, remembering how
liberally their appeal to the public was responded to when the Hospital
was founded, have perfect confidence that when it is found.necessary to
make another application to the charitably-disposed to contribute to the
building fund, the matter will he taken' up with undiminished o-ene-
rosity. b
Incurables.
The Managers invite attention to the subject of incurables, many of
whom are treated in this and other hospitals, there being no separate
asylum for their reception. It has been found that the presence of
such cases is prejudicial to persons afflicted with diseases that may be
cured; as many of the latter, applying when the wards are full, cannot
be admitted for want of accommodation. The establishment of an
Asylum for Incurables is therefore strongly recommended.
HYDROPATHIC ESTABLISHMENTS.
The Victoria Hydropathic Establishment in the Town of Prahran
three miles from the City of Melbourne, was established in 1856 by the
present proprietor, J. F. W. Fulton, who had many difficulties to con-
tend with?the cold water cure at that time being Very little known in
the colony. The premises will in no way bear comparison with the
magnificent water-cure palaces of older countries, the accommodation
being limited to twelve resident patients; in summer the applicants for
admission are sufficiently numerous to fill a place six times as large.
The present proprietor had in contemplation the erection of laro-er and
more commodious premises, but increased experience suggested that
the enterprise could only be successfully carried on by a companv, as
are most of the establishments in other countries.
MELBOURNE BENEVOLENT ASYLUM.
t The object of this excellent institution, which is now in the twenty-
fifth year of its existence, is to provide a home for ao-ed infirm
and disabled persons of both sexes, without'reference to creed
or nation. It is a large and commodious structure, located on a site
which a few years ago was on the extreme outskirts of the city, but
which is now the centre of one of its most populous new quarters. It
is in consequence at present in contemplation to remove the establish-
ment to a site at some distance in the country, where the inmates can
enjoy the advantages of a pure atmosphere and out-of-door employment
in the extensive grounds with which it is proposed to surround the new
building, which is to be made large enough to afford the increased
accommodation required for the augmenting number of applicants.
Ihe institution is under the control of a Committee of Management
numbering thirteen members, three of whom belong to the honorary
medical staff. There are also an hon. treasurer and auditors, a
resident medical officer, a superintendent and secretary, a matron and
a dispenser. The health of the inmates is attended to by two physi-
cians and two surg'eons. The Governor of the colony is president of
the institution, and two of the judges of the Supreme Court act as vice-
presidents. Its income is derived from public subscriptions and dona-
tions, and an annual grant-in-aid from the Legislature, and it amounted


Ast year (1874), to �12,768. Of this sum, �8750 came from the
o-raiit-in-aid. The expenditure, including- a balance from the preceding-
year, reached to �12,078, leaving- a surplus to go towards 1875 of �690.
There is also in process of formation an endowment fund derived from
leo-acies, bequests, and special gifts, which are to be allowed to accu-
mulate with interest until the sum of �IO,OOO is realised, when the
interest is to become available for the current expenses of the institution.
The formation of this fund is of very recent date, but it has already
reached the sum of �1435.
There is no one charitable institution in the country which effects a/
o-reater amount of good than the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum. It
freely opens its doors to all those who are deserving of assistance or
support, and thus evidences amongst our population that true civilisa-
tion and community of kindness which should ever characterise a
Christian people. The total number of cases relieved during the year
1874 Avas 858. At the commencement of the present year (1875)
there Avere 634 inmates in the Asylum. But there had been refused
admittance, for Avant of room, no less than 259 applicants.
IMMIGRANTS? AID SOCIETY?S HOME.
This charitable institution Avas established upAvards of 22 years ago,,
when the first great influx of population to the gold-fields brought
with it many avlio Avere ill-fitted to cope with the hardships and priva-
tions incident to that period of colonial history. There Avere soon,
found numbers of destitute, helpless, and sick persons Avho needed the
Good Samaritan?s aid, and the charitable spirit of the public speedily
provided that aid by founding this ? Home.? The Government also
lent its assistance, "and these tAvo sources still furnish its means of
support. The Home, hoAvever, has long ceased to be_ appropriated to
new arrivals in the colony, or immigrants in need of succour. It is
the refuge of the houseless, the destitute, and the casual poor, whether
able-bodied or infirm, sick or in health, the blind and the maimed, old
and young, Avomen and men alike. An honorary Committee of
Management, honorary treasurer and secretary, a resident superin-
tendent, a medical officer, and a matron constitute the staff of office-
bearers. All comers are received if there is room for them. In the-
case of the able-bodied a labour-test is applied as a means of securing
a fair return for the relief afforded, and to prevent imposition. The
number of inmates at the commencement of the present year, 1875,.
Avas 455, comprising 289 men, 90 women, and 76 children. The daily
average ?number admitted during- the previous five years varied from
379 per diem in 1870, to 464 in 1874. Many of these were ?casuals,?'
who sought a night?s lodging and supper, and Avho, on getting break-
fast next morning, performed the small quota of labour required of
them, and then left. The adult male inmates are described as for the
most?part ?suffering from disease, and requiring medical treatment and
hospital care. The female inmates were deserted wives with families,
voun�- women Avith infants, aged and infirm, incurables and imbeciles.?
Tire school for children had a daily average attendance of 52, and those of
any length of residence in the Home are reported as having made satis-

factory progress. The receipts from all sources of income for 1874 were
�6784 3s. Bd., of which �SOOO was furnished by the Legislative grant.
The expenditure amounted to �6852 Is, 5d., showing a-debit balance
of �67 17s. 9d., represented by a bank overdraft. The strict economy
with which the Home is conducted is shown by the fact that the net
?cost per head was only �l2 4s. 4d. for the support of the inmates
during the year. The establishment was formerly situated close to the
heart of the city at Princes Bridge, south of the Yarra. But the
improvements in the Government House Domain necessitated its
removal in July last to Sunhury, some considerable distance from
town, where the Government had some buildings suited for the
accommodation of the inmates.
HOSPITALS FOR THE INSANE.
There are four public lunatic asylums in Victoria, viz., at Yarra
Bend, at Kew, at Ararat, and at Beechworth, the two first-named being
in the vicinity of Melbourne, the others in the interior of the country.
There is also a private asylum (Cremorne) at Richmond, a suburb of
Melbourne. The maintenance cost of the four public asylums repre-
sents a considerable item in the annual expenditure of the State, being-
fixed at �88,579 for the financial year 1875-6. They are all first-class
-establishments, conducted, under the management of resident medical
officers of high skill, upon the most recent and approved principles of
science. A board of visitors and official medical inspectors make fre-
quent periodical investigations during each year into the working of
the Asylums, their condition, sanitary and otherwise, the treatment of
the patients, and all other matters concerning them, so as to preclude
the possibility of any abuse, irregularity, or neglect arising in their
management.
The following table shows the
NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE INSANE IN VICTORIA.

Victoria appears to be neither much worse nor much better than
other civilised countries in reference to the prevalence of insanity
amongst the population. During the past six years the proportion of
patients received annually into the asylums to the population of the
country varied from 1 in 1350 to 1 in 1352. The total number of
lunatics, idiots, and persons of unsound mind in proportion to the total
population is?in Victoria 2-96 per 1000, and in England 2-54 per

1000. But in calculating? these proportions the large number of un-
registered patients in England are not included, so that it is obvious
Victoria is more favourably circumstanced, on the score of insanity
among the population, than England.
This is also shown by a comparison of the ratio of increase of patients
in reference to increase of population in the tw r o countries respectively.
In Great Britain and Ireland the proportion of increase of lunatics
compared to increase per 1000 of population is 13?20, and in Victoria
B?l9. The number of cases recovered and relieved in England is, on
the average, 33?8? per cent., and in Victoria 55?39 per cent., showing
a difference extremely favourable to tbe colony. The death-rate in
England averages 10.33 per cent., and in Victoria 7.45 per cent., which
also shows well for this country. Nearly one-fourth of the deaths are
due to diseases of the nervous system. With respect to the causes of
unsound mind, the medical inspector inclines to the opinion that
intemperance is not the great cause of insanity in Victoria that some
persons thought it at one time to be. The following table has been
prepared, showing the percentage, calculated on the admissions, of cases
in which drunkenness is assigned as a cause of insanity in Victoria and
other countries:?
One more point of comparison must be mentioned, viz., with respect
to the cost of maintenance. The average maintenance rate of lunatic
patients in 54 English county and borough asylums is 9s, 10|d. per
Aveek, in 1(5 lunatic hospitals (England) it is �1 3s. 3d. per week, in
Scotch asylums it is 9s. s|d. per week, in Irish asylums it is 9s. per
Aveek, and in the four Victorian asylums it is 13s, lOd. per week.
The increased rate in the colony is due partly to higher salaries and
Avages given to the officers and attendants, and partly to clothing and
bedding being dearer in Victoria than in the United Kingdom. This
comparison of details between the parent country and the colony will
convey a more distinct idea of the condition of things relating to
insanity here than could otherwise be given.

Group 103.?GOVERNMENT AND LAW.
The administration of public affairs in the colony is carried on by the
Governor-in-Chief and Vice-Admiral of Victoria, as the representative
of the CroAvn?the present Governor being Sir George Ferguson
BoAven, G.C.M.G.?and an Executive Council, whose members consti-
tute the Ministry, or ministerial heads of the several departments of


the public service, and are designated as follows, viz.:?The Chief
Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General,
the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, the Commissioner of Crown
Lands and Survey, the Commissioner of Railways and Roads, the
Minister of Mines, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The office
of Minister of Public Education, as also that of Postmaster-General,
is usually filled by one of the Ministers in conjunction with his own
special department. The number of Ministers is limited to nine, and
the Chief Secretary is generally the Premier or Prime Minister, though
from July, 1874, to August, 1875, this rank was held by the Attorney-
General. Of the nine Ministers four are obliged by law to be members
of Parliament; but as a matter of fact the whole of the nine have
always seats in the Legislature, one of them at least, and sometimes
two, being members of the Legislative Council, and all the others
having seats in the Assembly. But in whichever House they sit, they
must be elected thereto in the ordinary manner as the representatives
of separate constituencies or electorates, just as the unofficial members
of the Parliament are elected. They hold office as long as they can
command a majority in the popular Chamber, or Legislative Assembly,
and their administration may last over the duration of one or two
Assemblies. The general elections for the latter take place every three
years in the ordinary course, but often at much shorter intervals, when
the political aspect of matters in Parliament occasions the dissolution
of the House. The Legislative Assembly consists of 78 members re-
presenting 49 constituencies, and the Legislative Council of 30 members.
These latter represent six provinces, and are elected for ten years, one
member for each province retiring in rotation every two years. The
opportunity for the introduction of new blood from time to time is thus
afforded, although the Council is never wholly dissolved.
LAW.
For the administration of the law there are established the Supreme
Court, with its several Circuit Courts of Assize in the country districts,
the Vice-Admiralty Court, the County Courts, the Insolvency Courts,
the Courts of Criminal Sessions, and the Police Courts. There are five
Judges of the Supreme Court, namely, the Chief Justice and four
Puisne Judges, one of whom sits in Equity. There are also aMaster-
in-Equity and in Lunacy, a Prothonotary, and several Sheriffs, with
their Deputies. The Judges of the County Courts are nine in number,
and they preside also over the Courts of Insolvency in the country
districts, there being a Chief Judge of Insolvency in Melbourne. Under
the head of Law Officers, there are ranked a Crown Solicitor and six
Crown Prosecutors, also the Registrar of the Supreme Court and of
Titles. There are 32 Stipendiary Police Magistrates, who are assisted
in the discharge of the business of the several Petty Sessions Courts
throughout the country by the unpaid local Justices of the Peace, who
constitute a numerous body, and are selected from the most intelligent
and respectable members of the community. The police constitute a
very superior civil force. It numbers 967 constables, commanded by
78 Sergeants, 3 Sub-Inspectors, 8 Inspectors, 13 Superintendents, and


one Inspecting-Superintendent, all under the control of a Chief
Commissioner. There are, besides, 13 Detective Officers. The Penal
Establishments and Gaols are under the management of the Inspector-
General. He is assisted by 140 warders, who act as constables, and by
several other gaol officials.
Group 104.?RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS AND
SYSTEMS.
The religious denominations in Victoria are numerous, and of great
diversity. Amongst those professing Christianity there are?the
Anglican, or Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, the
Presbyterian Church, the Free Presbyterian, the Presbyterian Synod of
Victoria, the Congregationalists, the Baptists, the Free Church of
England, the WesDyan Methodists, the United Methodist Free
Churches, the Primitive Methodists, the Methodist New Connection,
the Bible Christians, the German Lutherans, the Danish Lutherans,
the Unitarian Christian Church, the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist
Church, the Catholic Apostolic Church, the Christians, or Disciples of
Christ, the Christian Brethren, the Swedenborgian New Church, and
the Quakers or Society of Friends. These are the most prominent, but
there are several others of minor note. There are also two congrega-
tions of Jews, and a large body of Pagans in the Chinese population.
Up to a short time ago all the leading churches who would accept it,
received pecuniary aid from the Government, in the form of annual
grants and allowances of money. But this practice has been put an
end to, and they all depend now for their support on the voluntary con-
tributions and subscriptions of their respective congregations. These
voluntary supplies are generally on a liberal scale, and the various de-
nominations carry out their operations zealously and vigorously by
means of Mutual Improvement Societies, Sunday Schools, Sunday
School Unions, Bible Societies, Missions, Temperance Societies, and
other methods of organisation.
Groups 105 and 106.?EDUCATIONAL?SCHOOLS,
INSTITUTIONS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT
OF SCIENCE AND ART, &c.
Public education is well provided for in Victoria, At the head of the
educational establishments stands
THE MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY.
This is a fine pile of buildings, and when completed will constitute a
very handsome structure. It is situated in the northern quarter of the
city, in a domain of forty acres, four of which are set apart as a Botanic
Garden, the remaining thirty-six acres being laid out in ornamental


?grounds, which exhibit a fine rich sward, composed of artificial grasses
?of various kinds. The grounds are interspersed with trees, shrubs, and
plants, indigenous and exotic, such as may be grown in the open air
around Melbourne. These have been collected from the different
geographical limits within which they have been distributed by the
hand of Nature. The system of planting adopted affords a pleasing-
diversity. Thus one portion of about four acres is devoted to the
productions of Europe found within 36� of N. Latitude. Others, of
nearly the like area, are each planted with those peculiar to North
America, Northern Asia, China, and Japan, with those of Southern
America, Southern Africa, New Zealand, and Australasia respectively.
Five avenues radiate from the front of the buildings, planted with
trees distinct in kind. Between these and the specific nrhoretn referred
to, miscellaneous plantation is introduced, so that pedantic stiffness is
avoided, and each quarter of the grounds presents some distinctive
?characteristic attraction for the visitors.
The Botanic Garden has been laid out on a plan by which the
natural orders are exhibited in their exact sequence of mutual affinity,
beginning with the highest in organisation, and ending with the lowest.
By this arrangement it is found that the students rapidly acquire
sound ideas of the natural relations of the orders of plants, their visits
of study and observation to the garden constituting so many object
lessons in botany. The Museum of Natural History , Mineralogy ,
-Ac., is not large, but it is excellent of its kind.
The government of the University is vested in the Chancellor, Vice-
Chancellor, Warden, the Senate, and the Council?the Governor of the
-colony acting as Visitor. The Professors are those of Classics and
Logic, Mathematics, Natural Science, History and Political Economy,
Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathology. The Lectures are those of Law,
?Chemistry and Practical Chemistry, Materia Medica, Surgery, Civil
Engineering, Theory and Practice of Medicine, Midwifery and Diseases
of Women and Children, Forensic Medicine, There are also a Regis-
trar, Secretary, and Librarian, and an Assistant Librarian.
Although not yet twenty years in existence, the Melbourne Uni-
versity has proved itself a most acceptable and popular institution for
the higher education of the youth of Victoria, as is shown by the yearly
increasing number of candidates for admission to participation in the
advantages which it offers. There are held entrance examinations
three times a year, namely for the February, July, and October terms;
and these examinations apply not only to candidates for matriculation,
but also for candidates for admission into the civil service of the
colony. For the July and October terms of 1874, and the February
term of 1875, there were altogether not less than 857 candidates for
?examination, including a large number of young ladies. Of these
574 presented themselves for matriculation, of whom 211 passed, the
lady students being well represented; and for the civil service ex-
amination there were 825 candidates, of whom 407 passed. The sub-
jects of examination for matriculation are Greek, Latin, English,
French or German, Arithmetic, Algebra, Euclid, History, and
Geography. Candidates are not permitted to matriculate who shall not


have passed in six at least of these subjects. To pass the civil service
examination, four of these subjects only are requisite, of which English
and Arithmetic are compulsory.
A great want which has hitherto been felt has been that of a Hall
where the due solemnisation of the ceremonies incident to University
life should be celebrated. This want is now on the point of being sup-
plied through the munificence of a private citizen, the Hon, Samuel
Wilson, M.L.C., of Ercildoun, near Ballarat, who has recently made a gift
of �30,000 to the Council of the University, on the sole condition that
the amount should be expended in the erection of a Hall. This build-
ing, the plans of which are now in preparation by the architect, will be
160 feet long and 53 feet wide, presenting* an apartment well suited for
the purpose which it is intended to fulfil, and when complete it will
form a conspicuous architectural ornament of the University.
The income of the University is derived from an annual endowment
from Parliament of �9OOO, from fees, and other incidental sources.
The total income for the year 1874 was �15,753 18s. 4d., and the
total expenditure �16,392 16s. 3d., leaving a debit balance, represented
by a bank overdraft of �633 17s. lid.
The Melbourne University is strictly secular in its constitution, and
is open to all religious denominations.
GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, &c.
The sons of well-off colonists receive their education in private
schools, or in quasi public schools or colleges more or less connected
with religious denominations. The number attending private schools is
about 15,000, but these are not necessarily all superior to the State
schools, Some of them occupy ground which the State school system
has not yet covered. Of the buildings in which the private schools are
held, and of the teaching apparatus used in them, there is nothing to be
said except that they do not differ from the appliances of a like nature
used in Great Britain.
In regard to the colleges or grammar schools, a few details will be
found interesting. These are five in number ?viz., the Scotch College,
the Church of England Grammar School, St. Patrick?s College, the
Wesley College, and the Scotch Ladies? College. The cost of education
in these institutions is about 20 guineas a year; of board and
education about 100 guineas. In all of them the instruction is exceed-
ingly good, as is proved by the large number of pupils from each that
pass the exigent civil service examinations and the matriculation
examinations at the University. The constitution of the five schools
varies in some respects. The principal of the Scotch College receives
the revenue earned, and pays to the Presbyterian body, under whose
auspices it is, 12 per cent, on the amount, paying all expenses, and
having whatever is left over as his profit or remuneration. At some
of the others the denominations concerned keep the speculation in
their own hands. These institutions have suitable premises, occupying
sites granted to the religious sects before State-aid to religion was
abolished, and denominationalism eliminated from the State-school
system.


The sectarian element is not permitted to become prominent in the
management of the schools. Pupils may absent themselves from the
religious teachings if they please, and, as a matter of fact, Catholic boys
attend Protestant colleges, and Jewish boys and girls attend Christian
colleges.
The number of pupils in these high-class schools is about 1000, and
these are they from whom our legislators will have to be chosen in a few
years, and who will be the merchants, professional men, and wool or
wine growers of the future. It is therefore of much consequence to the
community that the training received in them should be sound and good.
A few particulars in regard to the largest of them, the Scotch College,
will show what kind of institutions they are. In this there are 361 pupils,
of whom 44 are boarders. There are twelve resident and eight visiting
masters. The teaching and residence portions of the school building are
commodious and well kept. In addition to the ordinary school appliances,
there are here to be found a gymnasium and swimming bath, apparatus
for illustrating lectures on physical science, a chemical laboratory, etc.
The institution is managed as systematically as a bank, and the whole
school history of every pupil can be ascertained in a moment. No bully-
ing or fagging is permitted, no buying and selling, no bad language, smok-
ing, or other offensive practices. Quiet, order, decorum, and gentlemanly
bearing are vigorously enforced. A visit to the school when in full
operation is very gratifying. The pupils are a fine-looking set of lads,
and give an intelligent devotion to the work in hand which speaks well
for teachers and taught, and gives promise of good results. Of the other
advanced schools of Melbourne the same good account can be given.
The Ladies? College is a comparatively new institution, but it is already
thriving, and promises to grow into great importance. At Geelong,
Ballarat, and elsewhere throughout the colony, there are also advanced
schools doing good work.
OUR STATE SCHOOLS.
There are 281,876 persons in the colony between the ages of 3 and
16 years, and of these 181,131 receive free education in our State Schools.
Our system of public instruction is thus seen to be a subject of the
highest national importance, and the apparatus by which the system is
worked is deserving of every attention. First among the apparatus of
our Department of Education must be ranked the school buildings. The
present Education Act came into force on the Ist of January, 1873, and
as it compels parents to send their children to school, it of course
became the duty of the Government to provide necessary and suitable
school accommodation. Parliament supplied money liberally for this
purpose, and the building of schools has been going on briskly during
the past two years.
The school buildings are designed on the assumption that the best and
most convenient size for the general school-room is about 53 feet long
and 20 feet wide, containing two divisions of a class, which are worked
by a teacher and pupil teacher. The new schools, therefore, have
generally a number of rooms of the above size, or approximately so, with a
proportion of class rooms about 20 feet square, fitted with galleries, into

which the classes are drafted for collective lessons. Each large school
has also a room for the head-master, for the general transaction of school
business, and which is used also for the meetings of local Boards of
Advice. The part of each large school set apart for infants is generally
about one-third of the whole accommodation. These rooms may be
larger than 53 feet, but are of the same width as the others, 20 feet, and
are generally fitted with galleries at each end for collective lessons, and
low desks in two or three groups for silent lessons. The proportion of
gallery accommodation in the infant department is generally about 66
per cent, of the children.
The main school-rooms have the floor stepped longitudinally for the
desks, with three steps four inches high and about three feet wide. Each
room has three or four rows of desks in two double groups. The length
of desk most desirable is about 12 feet, so that a 53 feet room is fur-
nished with two double groups of 12 feet desks, divided by a thick
curtain, which can be withdrawn at pleasure. Desks are generally of wood,
?screwed to the stepped floor. See pattern of desks, also plan of gal-
leries. The desks are graded in heights, 24, 26, 28, 29, and 30 inches.
The class-rooms are made 20 feet x 20 feet, arranged in proportion of
one class-room to two large school-rooms, and sometimes two class-
rooms to three school-rooms. Galleries, generally in five or six tiers, and
with steps of from 10 inches up to 15 inches. Each step passes a seat,
and is provided with a solid back. The furniture supplied for the teachers
use is a table and chair, and a book-pier to each school-room.
The system of dual desks, so largely employed in America and in many
of the Board schools in England, has not been approved for use in the
schools of Victoria.
The out-office accomodation usually provided is for three seats to 100
children, with the necessary urinals for the boys. The earth-closet system
is universally adopted, except in remote country schools, where it was
found impossible to get it efficiently carried out for want of suitable
labour.
The schools are of brick, a few cemented. Competitive designs were
invited in the beginning, but most of the schools have been planned
and executed under the direct supervision of the Department. The
cubic space provided for each pupil varies from 140 to 210 feet, and the
ventilation is sufficient. The following is, approximately, the number
of State schools now in use:?
The average cost per head was


In cases of the smaller schools the above cost includes quarters for
teachers.
The books supplied by the Government for use in the State schools
are, in the English language, n in number, including Sullivan?s and
Morell?s ?Grammar;? in geography, 3; writing models and copy-
books of 9 different kinds; and 11 different arithmetic books. It
also supplies 21 maps, 4 of them by W. K. Johnston, and 36
sheets of domestic and wild animals. Also slates, blackboards, easels,
notation frames, &c. There is no mention of either cane or birch in
the Board?s schedule of necessaries, although chastisement is inflicted in
its schools under certain restrictions. Perhaps the pupils themselves
provide the necessary implements. In connection with the State-school
system there is an excellent gymnasium, where teachers in training
receive instruction which they will in time communicate to their own
pupils. At the larger schools, too, gymnastic apparatus is provided.
THE INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL MUSEUM.
This is another most valuable educational collection, containing
apparatus illustrating the laws of physics, apparatus for class instruction
in chemistry, especially for laboratory practice; models of construction
for building timber and masonry; mechanical models for illustrating
course of lectures in mechanics; models for drawing, mechanical and
architectural; instruments for the teaching of telegraphy, etc.
The Museum was opened in a splendid hall, 220 feet in length, in
September, 1870, its collections consisting mainly of specimens pre-
sented by the exhibitors at the Intercolonial Exhibition of 1866. Since
then many thousand specimens have been added, and the collections
classified, not only scientifically, but in manufacturing groups, the aim
being to make the Museum an educational institution, affording instruc-
tion to those who desire to study the applicability of the mineral, vege-
table, and animal products of Australia to the arts and manufactures.
The present collection is as follows:?1500 specimens of animal sub-
stances, 3500 specimens of vegetable substances, more than 5000 speci
mens of rocks and minerals, 3500 models of mining and agricultural
machinery, and more than 5000 specimens included in the metal-
lurgy, pottery, glass, and building materials collections. In the
manufacturing groups or series, each is made to include the raw
material, the process of conversion into the finished article, the tools
and appliances with which the work has been done, and foreign
specimens to serve as standards of comparison and a means of educa-
tion. For instance, when the student has obtained a knowledge of the
rock and mineral specimens, he passes on to the means by which they
are obtained from the earth?the operations of mining and quarrying?
and then their preparation for manufacture. The appliances used for
these purposes are all placed ready for his examination in the Museum
machinery court, and include mining tools, boring, winding, and pump-
ing machinery; also, models illustrating methods of ventilation; timber-
ing and masonry used in mines; methods of crushing, grinding and
separating the ores and minerals raised. Then follows illustration of
the industrial process through which the raw materials pass in being


converted into manufactured articles. All the metals that occur in Aus-
tralia are discussed in this exhaustive manner, as well as the clays,
earths, sands, etc., used in the manufacture of pottery and porcelain,
glass, etc. And so with other substances. Wool, wheat, or grain
is exhibited in its natural state, and in every shape in which it
appears until it is finished off - for man?s uses. Besides the apparatus
already enumerated, the Museum is well provided with microscopes,
balances, and other aids to scientific research. The success of the
collection, and of the instruction afforded with its aid, is in a great
measure due to the zeal and ability of the gentlemen engaged in the
task, Mr. G. H. F. Ulrich, F.G.S., and Mr. J. Cosmo Newbery.
The course of study is not scholastic, but it is merely intended to aid
the student in acquiring sound practical knowledge of the various
branches and divisions of the Museum. Besides the two gentlemen
just named, who teach, respectively, practical chemistry and mineralogy
and mining, there are also lecturers in mathematics, practical geometry
and mechanics, and telegraphy. This fine Museum, being always open
to the public, is a source of much profit and pleasure. The Industrial
and Technological Museum and School are managed by a committee of
the Trustees of the Public Library, Museum, and National Gallery, of
which the Hon. Samuel Bindon is President.
SCHOOLS OF DESIGN.
Under the auspices of the Trustees of the Public Library, etc., there are
twenty-four Schools of Design in operation in the colony, and performing
very useful work. The pupils are of both sexes, and are chiefly engaged
in mechanical trades. Journeyman and apprentice engineers, carpenters,
carvers, plasterers, painters and decorators, moulders, cabinetmakers,
etc., are receiving instruction in these schools, and acquiring consider-
able proficiency in several branches of graphic art. The annual com-
petitive exhibitions of the pupils? work attract a good deal of attention,
and it is gratifying to observe that good progress is being made. The
branches taught are drawing of the human figure; ornamental, landscape,
mechanical and architectural drawing; drawing from the round and
from nature; perspective and isometrical projection. Instruction is
also given in colour as applied to decoration, in designing from Aus-
tralian plants, trees, leaves or flowers, etc.; also in practical geometry,
linear drawing, etc. The machinery employed in teaching consists of
models, drawings, diagrams, specimens of natural objects, and is being
added to as often as the funds at the disposal of the Commissioners will
admit.
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL.
This institute is situated in the University grounds, and contains the
usual dissecting-rooms and lecture theatres. The several branches of a
complete medical education are here taught by one professor and six
lecturers.
A medical library and reading-room is provided for the use of the
students. In the museum attached to the school are anatomical
and pathological specimens, abnormal developments, skeletons, and


other osteological preparations, etc. For the illustrations of the
lectures in materia medica there is a collection of the substances used in
the manufacture or compounding of drugs and medicines. There is
also an excellent collection of coloured diagrams for use in the anatomy
and surgery class-rooms. Bodies for dissection are obtained from the
Melbourne Hospital. The lecturer on chemistry and his assistants have
the use of a commodious laboratory, fitted with the apparatus necessary
for practical teaching.
MISCELLANEOUS.
At the Asylum and School for the Blind all the apparatus usually em-
ployed in teaching people bereft of sight are in use, while skilled masters
instruct the inmates in the w T ork of basket, brush, and mat making,
sewing, &c. At the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb there are also
all necessary appliances and materials. At Ballarat and at Sandhurst
there are good Schools of Mines, where instruction is given in the arts
and sciences necessary to be understood by the miner, and these are
supplied with instruments of research and materials for illustration.
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
The Melbourne Library, Museums, and Gallery, are all under the
management of a body of Trustees, of whom Sir Redmond Barry is
President, who have under them a librarian, sub-librarian, and several
other officers as assistants, attendants, &c. The cost of maintenance
for the present year, 1875-6, is fixed at �14,095, of which one item is
�6OO, for books to be lent to country libraries. This sending out of
books on loan to the rural and mining- districts is a peculiar feature of
the institution, which deserves to be noticed both as exceptional and
commendable in its character.
The number of books, pamphlets, &c., in the Library at the
commencement of the present year (1876) was 69,299 volumes of printed
books, and 14,747 parts and pamphlets, making, a total of 84,046
works.
The number of visitors to the entire building during the 3 r ear
{1874-5) was 406,256. Of these, no less than 242,842 resorted to the
reading-room of the Library proper.
THE MELBOURNE OBSERVATORY,
With its mammoth telescope and most complete astronomical apparatus,
is too well known to the scientific world to need any special notice
beyond stating that it is pleasantly situated on elevated ground in the
centre of the Government-House Domain. In conjunction with it may
fitly be mentioned the Royal Society of Victoria, which, like its
namesake in England, has been founded for the advancement of science.
To the same category belongs the Zoological and Acclimatisation
Society, which has done much to further the special and interesting
objects which its title indicates it to have in view. The gardens of
this society, in the Royal Park, are a very attractive resort for the
public. The Medical Society of Victoria, the Pharmaceutical Society,
the Agricultural Society, the Horticultural Society, with its beautiful


o-ardens on the banks of the Yarra, the Law Institute, the Institute
of Architects, the Athenceum or Mechanics' Institute ?all by their
titles denote the purpose and character of their operations, and it is
sufficient to say that they are all in a nourishing- condition.
In fine, Science, Art, Art-manufacture, the institutions properly per-
taining-to them, and the results harvested, have attained asing-ularlyhig-h
and advanced position in Victoria, which contrasts remarkably with the
fewness of its years as one of the latest-settled of the newly-peopled
countries of the world. This is to be accounted for by the fact that the
rush of immigration produced by the g-old discoveries brought with it large
numbers of highly educated men from all parts of Europe and America.
When matters had settled down after the first tumultuous influx, these
men naturally betook themselves to the avocations they best under-
stood, and tlie general prosperity resulting from the abundant pro-
duction of gold readily supplied the means which secured a permanent
local habitation for the labours, accomplishments, and instructive
operations of these enlightened new colonists.
Group 107.? C0-OPERATIVE EFFORT.
Co-operative associations, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
whether for the production or distribution of marketable articles, have
not been to any extent domesticated in Victoria, although some two or
three efforts of the kind have succeeded. The most signal instance of
the success, however, of combined effort on the part of the industrial
classes in towns has been achieved by the Building Societies, of which
there are about a score altogether in Melbourne and the chief towns,
with operations extending to some millions of pounds sterling.
Benefit, or Friendly Societies, such as the Oddfellows, the Foresters,,
the Druids, the Good Templars, &c., are most extensively established
amongst the operative classes, and have branches in all the leading*
towns.
Group 108.? MUSIC AND THE DRAMA.
Both these features of modern advanced civilisation are well developed
in the Victorian community. Melbourne maintains a first-class theatre
(the Royal), where the drama in all its varieties ?legitimate, sensa-
tional, farcical, and burlesque?by turns meets with due representation
all the year round. The theatre-going public are an intelligent and
critical audience, who have always shown a keen appreciation of the
talents and accomplishments of the great actors and actresses from
Europe and America who have from time to time visited Melbourne.
The Italian Opera also flourishes here. The Opera-house is a hand-
some and commodious structure, well adapted for its purpose, and is
usually filled during the operatic season.


Music is in high favour with the Melbourne people. Concerts,
sustained by a host of able performers, are given once or twice a
Aveek in some one or other of the public institutions, and the perio-
dical celebrations by the Philharmonic Society and the Liedertafel
always attract crowded audiences. The Melbourne City Council have
furnished their noble and spacious Town Hall with a magnificent organ
at a cost of upAvards of �4OOO, and this splendid instrument is occa-
sionally used at grand concerts with fine effect. It is not, hoAvever,
employed frequently enough to roll forth its thundering harmonies,
and there is even a danger that it may become deteriorated from
disuse.
Like all metropolitan cities, Melbourne has a full supply of enter-
tainments and exhibitions of different kinds, those which offer musical
attractions, however, greatly preponderating.
Gkodp 109. EXHIBITIONS ART AND IN-
DUSTRY?THEIR INFLUENCE.
The Victorian Academy of Art sends some of the works of its members
to the present Exhibition, and it is itself a practical and successful
illustration of the advantageous results Avhich flow from those most
characteristic institutions of modern times?viz., formally oganised
periodical expositions of the products of art and industry in various
countries, the latest and greatest of which is the Grand Centennial
American Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876.

TASMANIA.
Tasmania, the recognised sanatorium of Australia, was undoubtedly
formed by nature in her kindliest mood. The whole island is replete
with natural beauties. Mountains, upon the summits of which are
lakes miles in extent, frown in snow-capped majesty on peaceful
valleys and extended plains, framed as it were by sinuous rivers, the
banks of which form a fit theme for the pen of the poet or the pencil of
the artist. The prosperity which marked the progress of the colony in
the year 1873 has in no way diminished, and the expired portion of the
year 1874 will bear favourable comparison with the improvement in the
?condition of the colony which caused such general satisfaction at the
date of the last Intercolonial Exhibition. On the 7th of December,
1870, the population, according to the census then taken, numbered
99,328 souls, of whom 52,853 were males, and 46,475 were females.
The estimated population on the 31st of December, 1874, was 104,176,
the number of males being 55,117, and the number of females
49,059. The revenue for the year 1874 was .�327,925, and the
expenditure The amount expended for public works, roads,
bridges and railways, inclusive of the expenditure on the Launceston and
Western District Railway, amounted during the year 1874 to
The value of imports during the same period was /?1,257,78c:, while that
?of exports wa5^925,325.
Education is compulsory, and of a most comprehensive character;
there is no district so remote that there are no schools, and no loophole
is allowed to the careless parent to permit him let his children drift into
ignorance. Numerous industries have been established, and those who
were not content to observe the wool growing on the sheep?s back are
astonished at seeing how rapidly and beautifully the Town and
Launceston mills convert the raw material into articles of luxury as well
as of domestic consumption.
The total area of the island ofTasmania is 16,778,000 acres, of which
3,902,000 acres are alienated from the Crown by grant and sale;
L34 8 >400 acres are held under depasturing licenses from the Crown.
The total area under cultivation in the colony is 331,366 acres. Wheat
takes first rank in extent and importance, 57,633 acres being allotted to
this cereal; barley, 5129 acres; oats, 32,704 acres. Consequent on the
high duties enforced on agricultural produce by the Northern Australian
colonies, and the fluctuating state of the intercolonial markets, the atten-
tion of Tasmanian agriculturists has of late years been turned to the
production of wheat for the English market, and this has become the
most important article of strictly agricultural produce.
Salubrity and comparative coldness of climate, owing to lower latitude,
makes Tasmania an excellent breeding station of stud stock for all the
Australian continent, especially as regards animals whose features of
excellence consist in that massiveness of form of muscular development,
in the dewy mellowness of skin, and of that hardy constitution so requisite
in the ox, the mutton sheep, and the draught horse. The number of horses
in Tasmania in 1874 was 23,208, cattle 110,450, and sheep 1,714,168.


The bulk of the wool produced is Merino. The export of wool during
the season 1874-5 amounted to 6,069,299 lbs., which represents a value
of 1, j
The mining industry for many years past was confined to gold and
coal, but during the past year tin, iron, and slate have attracted much
attention. The yield of gold for the last twelve months was ?alluvial,
850 oz., or 680 oz. less than in the preceding year; quartz, 3800 oz.
14 dwt., or 669 oz. 14 dwt. more. The quantity of quartz crushed was
345 2 ?tons, or 731 tons less than last year. The average yield per
ton of stone was 1 oz. 5 dwt. grs. The average value of gold per
ounce was �3 6d. ibr alluvial, or is. per ounce more than in 1873?
quartz, �3 19s. 6d. with no variation.
The mineral which occupied the greatest share of attention was tin;
the supply of ore being practically unlimited ?the character of the
deposits at Mount Bischoff admitting of no question. The total amount
of tin shipped since the opening of the tin works is 286 tons 12 cwt. 2
qrs The only locality in which silver ore has been worked in Tasmania
is Penguin Creek, but at present operations have ceased.
With respect to the iron resources, it is stated that a small parcel of
271/ tons of ore was sent to the United Kingdom during the twelve
months. The quantity raised during the year is set down as 1400 tons;
of this quantity 1000 tons were raised at Middle Arm, West Tamar, and
400 tons at Lewisham. . . . . ,
The discovery made since the beginning of the present year of a large
lode of bismuth, is regarded as one of the most important that has yet
taken place, and it is alleged that if the lode should prove permanent it
must become a source of considerable wealth to the colony.
The island of Tasmania is intersected by many very valuable coal
measures. At present the output of 1 asmanian coal is not extensive, and
the island is mainly supplied from Newcastle, New South Wales, although,
for domestic purposes, Tasmanian coal is used to a considerable extent.
During the past two years attention has been directed to the slate
denosits of Tasmania; the high prices ruling for English slates in the
colonial markets has induced the Australian Slate Company to commence
work on a fair scale, and they are turning out some excellent slates.
At Ilfracombe Bay there is an extensive bed of a pure white clay
vvViich seems very refractory, and which when mixed with fine quartz
7d o abundant Ind close at hand) forms an admirable fire brick.
Common clays are found in all directions, and the iron companies are
now manufacturing bricks. Kaolin or porcelain clay is also found at
Cl T C n Tamar district limestone quarries have been worked for
vpars -oast There is an immense mountain of blue limestone,
situated about two miles from the township of Latrobe, on the River
Mersev At the River Don there are very large deposits of pure carbo-
nate of lime, and the eastern districts, especially Fmgal, abound with
lime of various kinds and qualities. .
The principal timber trees of Tasmania-such as Blue Gum, Stringy
Rnrk White Gum, or Gum-topped Stringy Bark, Swamp Gum, and
Peppermint Tree-fumish a hard, close-grained, and strong timber.


Huon Pine is very durable, and is employed for boat-building and for
house-fittings, &c, Blackwood makes excellent naves and spokes, cask
staves, &c. Native Myrtle is valuable for house-fittings. ? Swamp Gum
yields the finest palings and other split-stuff in the world. Sassafras
affords timber for house fittings, bench screws, &c. Celery-topped Pine
is chiefly used for masts and ship?s spars. In addition to these, Silver
Wattle is used for wool staves and trenails. Mallets, sheaves of
blocks, and turnery are manufactured from Iron Wood, while the Native
Cherry is used for tool handles, gun stocks, &c. White Wood is a fit
wood for engraving purposes, while Pink Wood and Native Pear are
suitable for turnery. Tonga Bean Wood and Native Box have both
a pleasant odour?that of the latter being fleeting.
Bark is largely exported to England and New Zealand for tanning
purposes. The price ground varies from �4 to �6 per ton at the
ports. During the year 1874 about 4870 tons were exported.
Phe principal animals are the kangaroo, wallaby, opossums and
bandicoots, the skins of which are all of avail for tanning purposes, the
fur being highly valuable as rugs, etc.| The devil and Tasmanian tiger
are formidable beasts, and make great havoc amongst the flocks. The
tiger is a low, long-bodied animal, with powerful forequarters, and a
dog-like head, weighing sometimes from 60 lb. to 70 lb. The devil,
though not so large, is far more hideous in appearance than the tiger.
Of birds, 171 species have been observed, but of these only 20 species
are supposed to be peculiar to Tasmania. The notes of many of the
birds are very musical, the most remarkable being the reed warbler, the
tones _ of which approach those of the nightingale, the black and white
magpie, and the butcher bird. The principal edible birds are varieties
of quail, duck, snipe, golden plover, and Cape Barren goose.
Reptiles are represented by the whip snake, so small as to be harm-
less, the black snake and diamond snake, the bite of which is venomous.
There are twelve species of freshwater fish, the most valuable beino-
the cucumber grayling. Amongst the estuary fish, those most appreci-
ated as edible are the sole, whiting, and gar-fish. The best of the deep
sea fish is the trumpeter, king fish, and rock cod. During the last ten
years the trout, the tench, and perch have been established in many of
the rivers and lakes. Fine salmon and salmon trout are supposed to
have succeeded, as young salmonids have during the last four years been
seen.
The chief industries are brewing, jam making, fellmongering
tanning, and coopering. Some of the beer is excellent, and is fully
appreciated in the other colonies. In 1874 ale to the amount of 23,000
gals, was exported. The amount of jam exported in the same year was
nearly 3,000,000 lb. Tasmanian leather is excellent, all varieties from kip
to kangaroo basil being supplied of such quality that a great falling-off
m importation of inferior leather from European ports has taken
place. The woods of Tasmania, particularly the silver wattle, black-
wood, and some of the gum woods, are admirably adapted for cooper?s
The exhibits from Tasmania will be found interesting in elucidating
the resources and industrial progress of that colony.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA-NORTHERN
TERRITORY.
The Northern Territory of South Australia embraces an immense
tract of country, and contains an area of 340,000,000 acres. This part
of the continent, though as yet little known, will without doubt soon
command attention, from the impoi?tance of its geographical position,
situated as it is in close proximity to the fertile islands belonging to the
Government of the Nethexlands-India, China, the Straits Settlement,
Borneo, &c. The climate is tropical, the soil generally rich. All the
tropical and semi-tropical fruits and plants thrive, and the grasses grow
from five to seven feet high. During the summer months a dearth of
water is a decided drawback to settlement, but what there is is good;
none appears to be brackish, a fact perhaps to be accounted for by the
absence of salt.
The settlement is presided over by a Resident, who is dependent for
his instructions upon the Government at Adelaide. In the year 1872 a
Land Act was passed by the South Australian Parliament, enabling
persons to select land to the extent of two square miles or 1280 acres, at
an annual rent of 6d. per acre, with a right of purchase at any time
during the currency of a ten years? lease, at 7s. 6d. per acre, or to select
any extent of land at 7s. 6d. per acre, cash, and without conditions of
settlement or cultivation. For plantation purposes 1280 acres may be
selected at the same rental, or if one-half of the land be in cultivation at
the end of five years, and the land enclosed, the land grant from the
Crown will issue without any further payment beyond the five yearly
payments of 6d. per acre. The construction of the telegraph line across
the continent, which unites Australia with the other parts of the world,
has tended to bring the settlement into notice. The laying of the sub-
marine cable between Port Darwin and Banjoewangie, and thence to the
Eastern world, was commenced in October, 1871, and completed in
November. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining white labour, Chinese
and coolies have been introduced under the auspices of the Government.
It has been proposed, with a view of encouraging trade, to make Port
Darwin a free port. During 1875 the Government intend expending
�15,000 on public works and buildings in the Territory. The chief
harbour is Port Darwin, into which vessels of any tonnage can enter and
beat out with safety. The River Roper is navigable for nearly 100
miles, and the Liverpool, South Alligators, East Alligators, the Adelaide
and Laby Rivers are also navigable to from 20 to 40 miles.
The principal resources of the Northern Territory are at present its
minerals and timber. Important discoveries of gold, copper, tin, and
lead point to a great mineral future for this part of Australia. Its
gold mines have already attracted attention, and are being actively
worked. Numerous quartz reefs have been discovered, the returns from
Avhich are of an encouraging character.
The Northern Territory has contributed valuable specimens of her
resources and productions to the present Exhibition. Samples of the


STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.
Owing to the interest taken by the late Governor of the Straits
Settlement, Sir Andrew Clarke, the list of exhibits at the Inter-
colonial Exhibition of 1875 has been considerably increased in
number and value by the contributions from Singapore. Singa-
pore is one of several dependencies called the Straits Settlement,
and is an island on the south-western extremity of the Straits of
Malacca. The circumference of the British settlement is 120
miles, and is composed of about seventy-five islands; the chief of
these is separated from the main-land by a strait, which in the
early period of European navigation was the thoroughfare from
India to China. But the commercial highway between the
eastern and western portions of maritime Asia now passes along
the south side of the island, on which the town is built. The
settlement was founded in 1819, the islands being covered with
primeval forest, and the only inhabitants being a few Malay
fishermen. The right of the British to found a settlement was
disputed by the Netherlands Government, on the ground of a
prior cession to them by the native sovereign. The objection was
withdrawn, and Singapore and numerous of the adjacent isles were
by a treaty concluded in 1824, ceded to the East India Company.
Singapore from its foundation has always been a free port, open to
flags of any nation and without either export or import duties on
goods. The only charge made is a small one for ships, which goes
towards the maintenance of lighthouses. To this, combined with
the manifold advantages of its position, it is indebted for the rapid
progress of its commercial prosperity. Singapore is the entrepot
in which are brought together the products and manufactures
of the western world, of India, Cochin China, Siam, the Malay
Peninsula, and of the Eastern Archipelago, from its western
limits in Sumatra to the meridian of New Guinea and the Philip-
pine Islands. The Straits Settlement is of itself rich in products.
Tin is found in Malacca and at Penang; the former being re-
markable for keeping its brightness, while the latter is, on ac-
count of its greater purity, of more'commercial value. Singapore
pepper is _ the largest product of the Straits, and is mostly
produced in Johore and Karimons. The pepper is both black
and white, the difference in colour arising from the fact of the
outer skin being removed in washing. Tapioca is produced in
Singapore, Malacca, and Penang, while supplies of sago flour
are derived from Borneo. The production of the latter article is
rapidly increasing. Coffee is grown in the Celebes, at Timor, Deli,
and Bally, and to a small extent in Sumatra. The production in
the Straits is restricted to a limited quantity from Penang,
Borneo also yields white gutta and an article called Borneo


rubber. From the island of Banda is derived the chief supply of
nutmegs, although they are produced at Penang, Province Wel-
lesley, and on the west coast of Sumatra. The attempts to
acclimatise the nutmeg tree at Singapore have as yet all been
failures. Mace worth 3s. per lb. is derived from Banda, and a fine
description of cloves from Penang. An enormous quantity of
copal is produced at Celebes, while gambouge striclse, produced
by an insect and formed on twigs of trees, comes from Siam and
Cochin China. Teel-seed is exported in great quantities from
Siam to the south of Europe, where an oil is extracted to
imitate olive oil. Sugar is derived from Penang, and supplies of
cutch come from Burraah, and a vegetable tallow principally
from Sumatra. Everyone is acquainted with Malacca canes and
rattans, which, together with Chichi canes, form no inconsiderable
portion of the Straits exports. Bete-nut, much used by the
natives as a masticatory in conjunction with serai leaf, gambler,
and lime, is another article of export.
Exhibits of all these various novelties of products and speci-
mens of plants have by the kindness of Messrs. Bonstead and Co.
and Mr. D. Little, the chairman of the Baffles Library, Museum
and Garden, Singapore, been collected and forwarded to-
Melbourne, with full information as to their commercial value
particulars of which will be found in the Catalogue.
BONSTEAD & CO., Singapore.
3995 No. 1. Sample of Malacca Tin.
8996 No. 2, Sample of Penang Tin.
These are sent to show the shape of the slabs. Malacca tin
is usually moulded in slabs weighing about 84 catties =
1121b5., and Penang in slabs of 50 to 75 catties.
3997 No. 3, Cutting of Malacca Tin.
3998 No. 4, Cutting of Penang Tin.
These show the difference in quality between the two descrip-
tions. The Malacca, it will be noticed, shows considerable
roughness, caused by the presence of impurities, while the
Penang is smooth where bent, being more pure. For this
reason the latter description of tin is preferred for most
purposes, but the Malacca in some cases is taken in pre-
ference in consequence of keeping its brightness longer.
Total production in 1874 was about 129,000 piculs = 13,000
tons; of which was received at Penang from Laroot, Junk,
Ceylon, and Perak, 159,000 piculs; and at Singapore, from
Malacca, 60,000 piculs. The exports were as follows:
United Kingdom, 79,000 piculs; Continent of Europe,
3000 piculs; United States, 47,000 piculs; China, 70,000
piculs; India, 20,000 piculs. Owing to the discovery of

JAPAN.
It is only within the last few years that a more accurate know-
ledge of the earlier Japanese history, than is contained in the old
hooks written in European languages, has been obtainable. Now,
however, every year adds to the amount of information, by the
translation of native historical works, the chief of which is Nihon
Guaishi (published in 1827) containing twenty-two volumes, and
which occupied the author twenty years in compilation. This is
the chief source of Japanese education, and from which they
derive their acquaintance with the history of their own country.
Ihe earliest history of Japan is wrapped in mystery. The tradition
is that after the erection of heaven and earth, an island of soft earth
swam upon the water like a fish. At the same time between heaven
and earth, a thing was born similar to the plant A ski. This was
changed into a god, and he was the first of seven celestial spirits,
lie reigned ten millions of years, as did also his two successors.
The first three spirits were self-born and were males. The fourth,
fifth, and sixth spirits had female companions and reproduced by
mutual contemplation. After a fabulous number of years arose a
male spirit Izanagi-no-Mikoto and a female spirit Izanami-no-
Mikoto. To them were born two daughters, the Sun Goddess
and the Moon Goddess, and two sons. After living on earth for
many years Izanagi and Izanami returned to heaven, and it is
asserted that the present Emperor of Japan is descended without
a single break from the ? Sun Goddess.? This is the legendary
account of the foundation of the Japanese Empire. It is not
known whence the invaders came who dispossessed the aborigines
of the land now called Japan. There is certainly Chinese, Mongolian,
and Corean blood in their veins, and as it seems Malay also. The
first mortal ruler of the country was Jimnu, who probably came


from Asia. He it was who established the Kioto or capital.
From the aborigines who remained attached to their native soil,
and who became the bondsmen of the conquerors with an admix-
ture of the invaders, sprang the flat-faced peasantry which form
the lowest class of Japanese society. From the ranks of the
invaders was formed the military class which constituted the
nobility of the land. The form of Government established by
the early emperors was purely monarchical. The history of
Japan during the seventeenth century is taken up with intestine
broils and civil wars. The Daimios or chiefs, strong in wealth
and the number of their followers, rose up against the emperor,
and the struggle for ascendancy was carried on with bitterness,
and much blood shed on both sides. Constituted authority
appears to have at last got the upper hand, for at the end of the
century an ordonnance was issued compelling all the daimios to
live in Yeddo. Between the years 1859-60 Japan entered into
diplomatic relations with other countries. It would- occupy too
much time to do anything in a short introduction like this but
to recall the passing events of the next few years. Every one
will no doubt remember the advances made to Japan to open her
ports to foreign trade. How, after much demur, foreigners were
allowed to effect settlement in the land. How some of the law-
less natives, backed up by powerful chiefs, took the lives of
the settlers and their dependents. Great Britain took up the
matter warmly, and the results of Sir Rutherford Alcock?s mis-
sion to Japan, and the payment of the indemnity asked for, must
be fresh in the minds of all students of European history.
Japan remained for some time obstinate to the offers of inter-
change of trade held out to it, now seeming willing to comply,
then retreating sullenly, and negativing every advance made. At
last a better policy prevailed, and about the year 1867, the
Japanese ports were opened to the world. Since this time Japan
has prospered so rapidly that she now stands in the foremost
rank of modern states, and to the enlightened policy of govern-
ment she owes her success.
The power of the Mikado is absolute, and he governs through
the medium of an executive Ministry, or Great Council, to whom
are submitted all important measures. The provinces, of which
there are seventy-five, are administered by prefects, whose
position is exalted, and whose powers are most extensive. The
Daimios, or feudal lords of Japan, and who seem ever ready to
incite broils and insurrections, have been forced to surrender
up their castles and troops to the reigning Mikado, who,
since then, ? has been pushing forward reforms of a social and of
a political character, which have stimulated the trade and
industry of the country, and raised the standard of education
amongst the people to a remarkable degree.? No sooner did


Japan come in contact with other nations than it began to
assimilate to itself the sciences, arts, and manufactures of
the strangers. Railroads were projected and carried out,
telegraphic communication was established, lighthouses were*
erected, roads and bridges constructed, and all other appliances
of civilisation were quickly copied. Factories were rapidly es-
tablished, and not only were articles of commerce fashioned by
native skill, aided by foreign science, but the difficult branches of
engineering were soon carried on with success, so that a great
portion of the railway plant needed, and the engines for the
Japanese steamers, are manufactured in the country. Deter-
mined to master all the advantages of civilisation, embassies were
despatched to Europe and the United States to observe and
report upon the political institutions and the social aspects of
the countries that they visited. One of the results of these
observations is, it is to be presumed, that the Japanese Govern-
ment have authorised the formation of a Parliament, consist-
ing of two houses of legislature. The Upper House will consist
of the heads of the departments?of which there are eight?
and of nominees of the Mikado. The members of the Lower
House ? will be elected by popular vote.?
Great attention has been paid to the education of the people.
In 1871 a Board of Public Instruction was appointed, which not
only established public schools, but encouraged the formation
of private schools throughout the land. In 1873 a number of
European professors were called to Japan, at the expense of the
country, to teach the inhabitants the languages of the
civilised West, while at the present time Japanese students
are, at the public expense, studying in Europe and America.
The principal exports of Japan are silk and tea, but the
greatest attention is now being turned to agriculture and
the breeding of cattle. The mines of Japan are virtually
Government property, for the royalty payable for working them
is so large that it leaves but little margin for profit. There is
a gold and silver mine ninety miles from the city of Osaka,
and a gold, silver, and copper mine twenty miles north of the
same city. The Japanese Government have purchased the
machinery and apparatus lately belonging to the Hong Kong
mint, so that they are now in a position to coin and assay
their gold and silver.
One of the principal native industries is cabinet-making, and
it is wonderful how skilfully myriads of separate pieces of wood
are blended in colour and design into one harmonious whole.
Wood, inlaid with brass, making a sort of original ormolu work,
shows most artistic taste and design. As artisans of potteryware
and china, the Japanese workmen have made themselves a name.
Nothing comes amiss to their skilful fingers, whether a vase of

coarse ware, six feet high, or the delicately-coloured and chastely-
designed ornaments that have become the fashion in modem
boudoirs and in the china collections of cognoscenti. In the
grotesque, too, the Japanese excel. As workers in metal they are
proficient, and the ornaments made of a dull metal resembling
platinum in everything but weight, inlaid with gold and silver-
designs of artistic value, would do honour to Albert Durer or
Cellini. Their silk fabrics are exquisite, and their painting on
silk is unique in its way. As manufacturers of nick-nacks?
such as fans, cigar-cases, glove-boxes, &c. ?they display great
art in skilfully manipulating the most fragile materials.
The Government of Japan, although at first afraid that they
would be unable to take any part in the Victorian Intercolonial
Exhibition of 1875, have made their desire to enter into
communication with other countries subservient to their own
convenience. Every assistance was given to the Japanese
merchants who wished to exhibit 'in Melbourne, and the
Government further gave evidence of the interest they took in
the matter by appointing an Imperial Commission to visit
Australia, and to represent Japan during the Exhibition. The
Commissioners thus appointed, and who arrived here a few weeks
ago, are M. Hashimoto and Harua Sakata, both gentlemen hold-
ing high official positions in the civil service of Japan. The
exhibits under their charge will be found to fully represent the
industries of Japan, and are of such a nature that they cannot
fail to attract the attention of all those who take an interest
in the progress of manufactures and arts.
