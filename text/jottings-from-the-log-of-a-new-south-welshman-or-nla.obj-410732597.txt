PREFACE.
A book is not a book without a preface, so wishing you the compliments
of the season, I must preface my yarn with the hope that it may be the
means of inducing some of the youth of my birthplace (New South
Wales) to take to “a life on the ocean wave, and a home on the rolling
deep,” stick to their profession like men, and not give it up after a
trial trip. As “ a rolling stone gathers no moss,” so a lazy sailor is
little use to himself or others. Australians ought to make good sailors,
as they take less liquor than Englishmen and Foreigners, and are there-
fore more trustworthy.
The accompanying yarn, made up as it is from jottings from my log
book, is perfectly genuine, except my own name, and that of the Brig
I commanded. Should curiosity prompt any one to ask the meaning
of my Chinese signatux*e, any Amoy Chinamen, plenty of whom are to
be found in Sydney, can translate
"SIN TATJKA.”

JOTTINGS FROM THE LOG
NEW SOUTEI WELSHMAN;
OR, SIX YEARS IN THE OPIUM TRADE.
CHAPTER I.
SIY APPOINTMENT TO TAKOW STATION.
It does not concern you, Low I, a New SontL Welshman, readied Amoy, but be
content that my story dates from that place, the 25th January, 1860. On this day
I became commander of the opium clipper schooner Eamont; she was owned by
Messrs. Dent & Co., of Hong Kong, carried six 18-pounder, two swivel, and four
broadside guns, and a crew of thirty hands all told. Her cargo this trip was
fifty chests of opium, and her destination Takow, Formosa.
We were unable to weigh the anchor at the 10 a.m. tide, the chain having
swept a rock; I therefore buoyed it and left it in charge of the chief officer of the
receiving ship Lord Amherst, slipped and stood out with a light west wind and
all sail set, in company with the Wild Dayrell, Captain Wilson. At 10'30, we
drew up alongside the Wild Dayrell, which until then had been ahead, and, hailing
Captain Wilson, bid him good-bye, the Eamont being the fastest vessel when the
wind was astern. After passing through the Six Islands, and when abreast of
the Chawchats, it fell calm and a flood tide. Here the Eamont and Wild Dayrell
both anchored, but a light wind setting in from N.E., both vessels got under
weigh in the afternoon, and stood out under all sail, close hauled on port tack.
About 4 p.m. a thick fog closed in and we lost sight of the Wild Dayrell, but
I afterwards heard that she got on Quemoy Spit, which, without doing her any
damage, detained her some few hours. As it now fell calm, we had to anchor
close to Chapel Island. This dense fog and calm continued all night, so that we
could not see 200 yards ahead. We heard a steamer pass and anchor close by;
hailing her we found her to be the Shanghai, with English mails for Amoy.
On the morning of the 26th, with a fresh N. wind, we up anchor and stood
across channel, steering S. E. At 7 a. m. we passed through a fleet of fishing
junks, belonging to Haimunkon, but not seeing them until too late we could not
avoid going right over one of them. A crash and yell, and then all was quiet
again.
The fog continued, but the vessel was darting along at 10 knots. At 10 p.m.
we made Pescadore Islands, got a peep of Fisher’s Island through Rover’s Channel,
with a heavy press of canvas, anl going a good thirteen knots over the ground.
At 4 a.m. made Ape’s Hill, and, mchoring off the port of Takow, fired a gun and
ran up a signal to the receiving siip. At sa.m. a boat from the port came along-


side with Captain Oliver, captain of the receiving ship, and head of that station; to
him I delivered my despatches, and placing myself and vessel under his orders
learnt that I should have to wait in the roadstead for some time, the vessel draw-
ing too much water for the bar. We were also to take part in an expedition
against Yamtaya, the inhabitants of which had murdered the master of the Ham-
burg schooner Macto, which had been driven ashore sometime previously during a
typhoon, and as these same villagers of Yamtaya, had been committing other
depredations and interfering with commerce, it was determined to give them a
lesson while the Eamont was off the port.
Under these circumstances we close-reefed all sails and veered out to seventy
fathoms chain on a single anchor, (so that should it come on to blow the vessel
would ride easily,) landed the drug, and went ashore with Captain Oliver, leaving
the vessel in charge of the chief officer, with orders to pay attention to any dags
that were hoisted at the Science (receiving ship’s) mast head.
The following vessels were in harbour : —Science, owned by Dent & Co., the
J. H. Becker, dying Jardine, Matheson & Co.’s dag, and the Martha and Emily, a
British brig, Captain J. G. Carter.
The head man of the village was now written to, and requested to pay a dne
for having permitted the plunder of the schooner Macto and indemnity for the
murder of the captain; in default of which we threatened to burn his village to
the ground. This letter they tore up, and dogged the messenger. With the
break of day we signalled the Eamont to send two armed boats ashore in charge
of the chief officer, the second officer taking charge of the vessel. We now pre-
pared to attack the village at high water, with six boats and forty men, placing
two field-pieces in the two largest cutters. About 10 a.m. we were abreast the
village of Yamtaya, and attacked it in three divisions, I myself going up the river
with two boats and one deld-piece ; in fact, ours was the only division able to land
close to the houses. This, we did not know at starting, else we should all have
made for the same point, as the other boats, after being exposed to a shax’p dre
from the village while ashore on the various sand banks, had eventually to come
up the creek. Some of the men waded in shore on the south and west sides,
sending their boats round to me. I now opened dre from the north-west side,
landed after the drst discharge, and making a rush at the houses, left but four men
in charge of the boats. In almost less time than it takes to write it, we were
under cover of the drst house, had dred it, and now virtually, the village was ours.
The Chinamen evacuated it on the eastern side, making for the town of Sarta-
chui, (orders had been issued that no one should be hurt save dghting men) ; they
blazed away at us as they retreated, but their shots fell harmless. Captain
Oliver and the rest of the party now joined us, we having dred the village at
every point and placed sentries round it, the women and children being prisoners
close to the boats. By this time the men had all skedaddled inland, except the
few who had been laid low by our ride balls. I found Captain Oliver had placed
my mate under arrest, for having cut an old woman down who was trying to save
some of her goods from her blazing house; his excuse was that he had mistaken
her for a man. I discharged him on the spot, and advised him to clear out of the
country with all speed; he being only too glad to escape punishment so easily.
The houses of the village, built of bamboo, burnt quickly, and in half-an-hour
from our drst entrance it was entirely destroyed.
Elated with this victory and being in such force we determined to walk
through the streets of Sartachui, a large town further inland, under the jurisdic-
tion of the Bed Button mandarin, of the walled city of Petow. Liberating all
the women and children, and leaving half our force in charge of our boats, we
marched to Sartachui, walked through the streets, called on the head man of the
town, who gave us a good dinner of which we partook fearlessly, as we had left a
guard outside. In return we gave him some brandy, upon which he swore eternal
friendship to the Englishmen, and, on our leaving, loaded us with presents, and
afterwards purchased opium from us. We gave him a bundle of Illustrated London
JSTeivs, with which he papered his house; we gave others a picture of the Great


Eastern, and some sets of stereoscopic pictures ; thus was opened up the trade at
Takow, which has now risen to be of no little importance. Without casualty we
reached our respective vessels, and a fortnight later I sailed for Amoy with thirty
boxes of treasure and one passenger, who was no other than my discharged mate.
I made several successive, and successful, trips to and from Amoy and Takow
in command of the Eamont, and on one of these voyages the vessel nearly foun-
dered. We were in the centre of the Formosa Channel, wind blowing very hard,
with a high beam sea. We carried only close-reefed fore-and-aft canvas, but the
current setting to windward caused the sea to topple and break aboard, stopping
her way, and washing five men overboard, the man at the wheel amongst the
number. Standing close to the wheel myself, I was washed with considerable
violence against it, but mechanically put it up, when the vessel trembled and paid
off. The old mate, Mr. Mery weather, said “ She’s gone, sir !” “ Not yet,” said
I, * ‘ she is shaking herself clear. ” The water was at this moment over the rail,
the decks completely flooded, and the cabin half full. As I predicted, however,
she rose again, the men swimming on board before she could clear herself of the
water and start ahead again. I ordered another reef shaken out, and close-reefed
topsail set, keeping her close up instead of allowing her to go free ; now she tore
at it with a vengeance, cutting her way clean through the green seas, until we
made one of the Pescadore Isles; when under its lee we were able to square away
on our course, carrying a tremendous press of canvas, and making her literally jump
through the water.
While thus making sail I missed the mate. On going below to look for him,
found him on the cabin deck asleep, with his head pillowed on an empty gin bottle.
The old man had been scared, and taken to liquor so that, as he said, “he might
go down glorious. ” He was really one of the best navigators that had ever stepped
aboard a vessel, was a Greenwich schoolboy, and had been six years in command
of a fine vessel; but liquor had cooked him, poor fellow. He afterwards died a
miserable death at Amoy, having no one near him but Chinamen, and was at the
last moment plundered by a Chinese woman.
While at Takow this time, we were lying off the port discharging opium into
the cutter Pearl, when Captain Oliver and Captain Carter of the brig Martha and
Emily, requested me to protect Captain Carter’s men, who were engaged trying to
stop a fleet of small sugar junks, under convoy of a fore-and-aft schooner. Captain
Carter represented to me that the sugar was his property, and that they were run-
ning away with it. As my superior officer, I said, *‘ if Captain Oliver gives me
written instructions to act, or fires first from the Pearl (she was heavily armed)
I shall consider it my duty to assist him if he needs it.” We then went to
quarters, Captain Oliver firing an 18 lb. shot from the Pearl’s midships, which
struck the mast-head of the convoy schooner, and brought her round like a
top. Captain Carter’s boat then whipped up the whole fleet and brought them
into port,
Ho shot had been fired from my vessel, but having gained his object, Captain
Carter sent an account to the Hong Kong papers, stating, that the opium schooners
were pirating on the Formosa coast. (I believe his object in doing this was to
secure himself a good situation, but he missed his mark.) A Chinaman, however,
hit his, by shooting Captain Carter on the same coast, about eighteen months sub-
sequently, he having allowed his vessel to go ashore, officers asleep, and failing to
keep a look out. The consequence to Captain Oliver was being put down a peg,
to command the Eamont, while the Yindex, the largest and fastest] schooner in
the opium trade, was given to me. She was built by Hall of Aberdeen. Mr,
Howard succeeded Captain Oliver in command of the Takow station. He was a
good clerk, but no seaman.
I made my next trip in the Yindex, carrying Captain Howard and his staff to
Takow, and while they were settling up accounts, I amused myself sometimes by
going up the bay duck shooting, and at other times mounting Ape’s Hill in quest of
monkeys ; but during the whole time I was trading to Takow, and during a resi-
dence there of some thirteen months, I only succeeded in shooting two monkeys.


They were always too nimble for me, scampering off into caves at the least sound.
These caves appeared to be all bottomless, so that there was no following them.
The Chinese frequently trapped them and then made a good roast, stew, or soup,
mixed with beche de mer, shark’s fins, bird’s nests, or dried mushrooms, the mix-
ture being considered quite a luxury.
Hence we sailed for Amoy, with Captain Oliver and staff as passengers, a strong
N.E. gale blowing, and the weather bitterly cold. We worked up along the For-
mosa coast until abreast of the Pescadores, and then stood across. One of the
Lascars while engaged taking the bonnet off the jib, lost his hold and fell into the
sea ; the schooner passed over him and he never rose again. We lost half an hour
in going through the form of looking for him, for after all it was only a form, the
wind blowing so hard and raising so much salt water spray, that it was impossible
to see any distance from the vessel.
Cutting away again, we crossed the channel under single-reefed mainsail, fore-
sail, storm jib, and storm staysail. Upon making the China coast we were com-
pelled to batten the forecastle scuttle down, to keep the men on deck, and
flog them along with a reef point, so as to circulate their blood and get them to
work, that we might have enough sail on the vessel to prevent our falling to
leeward of our port. The Lascars were quite benumbed, so bitterly cold had been
the weather, and, I regret to say, one Englishman was in a similar state.
By great exertion we succeeded in getting in, weathering the Merope shoal and
Wosue, through the Six Islands, and safe into harbour on the 14th of April.
Here I got the hint to resign and apply for the command of the brig Sin Tauka,
which had been bought by a captain in the service of Jardine, Matheson, & Co.
On resigning, Captain Roper assumed command of the Yindex. The Sin Tauka
having been chartered by Jardine, Matheson, & Co., as receiving ship for Takow,
I went over in command of her. On Saturday, 2nd J une, 1860, we anchored in
Takow harbour, relieving the J. H. Becker, hoisting Jardine’s house flag, and
mooring the vessel by four chains, made all snug for a long stay.
CHAPTER 11.
RESCUE OF CHINESE JUNKS, AND CHINESE FISHING,
The 22nd June, 1860, introduces you to my second chapter, and finds me still at
Takow. On the morning of this day, the Yindex schooner, outward bound, in
trying to cross the bar, struck heavily, and remained fast, the tide leaving her. I
went out with a boat’s crew to render what assistance I could, but Captain Roper
did not require my services. I did not immediately return, however, but chatted
to Lieut. Prowse, Ist lieutenant of H. M. S. Acorn, who had been on a visit to
me and was rather unwell. Returning to the harbour the men went to dinner,
when I observed the schooner moving off the bar and running end on to the beach,
with all sail set. In double quick time we jumped into the boat and pulled out
with a hedge and line —-we dropped the hedge well out, gave way for the bows of
the schooner, up which we scrambled with the line, giving it a turn round the
windlass-bitts. I sang out in Malay, “let run all the halyards and clew up.”
I was just in time, for as the line slewed her bow round seaward, her heel
took the ground. I lost no time in running out the bower with my boat, and
ordered the crew to make fast all sails. By this time, hundreds of people had
collected on the beach, under the impression that the schooner would become a
wreck, and as she was deep with rice and had besides 60 boxes of treasure, it
would have offered a good chance for plunder. This time, however, they had
calculated without their host, for when we hove on the hedge warp and bower


chain, with the assistance of the flood tide making, the vessel began to move off,
to the intense disgust of John Chinaman. In half-an-hour she was all afloat and
at high water I ran her up harbour and made her fast to the receiving ship. Cap-
tain Roper was very grateful and drank my health in a bumper of champagne.
The next day I had the Job of piloting her out to sea, and during the remainder of
my stay at Takow was always sought to render similar services. The only good
fresh water obtainable at Takow was from a spring on the summit of a hill at a
distance of about half-a-mile. I therefore pressed a number of Coolies into my
service, and made them cut a channel from the top of the hill to the beach, we
then shaped some bamboo shoots to conduct the water into the boats. All the
ships in the harbour derived the benefit arising from this, but I did not seek any
remuneration from them. The Chinese cut the supply off once, but I gave the
old mandarin of the port such a severe reprimand, that he took good care it was
never molested again.
Every week we had shooting excursions or a pic-nic inland. I imported two
troop horses and several ponies, and we had always one or two to spare for visitors.
We rode all about the country, and the officers of H. M. S. Acorn, which was at
this time stationed at Amoy, took it in turns to come across and visit us, as also
did the masters of merchant vessels which occasionally came to Takow. Under
all these circumstances we used to make ourselves very jolly, for, besides drawing
good pay, we possessed boats of all kinds, from a bamboo raft to a house boat,
in which six of us could sleep comfortably and still leave room for a crew of seven
men. Our pleasure trips were, therefore, got up on quite an extensive scale, and
the harbour, eight miles long by one broad, and averaging a depth of about five
feet, was no mean one, on which to go for an excursion. There are various creeks
abounding with numberless wild fowl, some of them very rare specimens. Some
were forwarded to the Great Exhibition by the British Consul, and Captain Rorie
sent four deer of an unknown kind. I obtained a large one to send to Sydney,
but in trying to ship him, he burst a blood vessel, so that we were obliged “to kill
him, to save his life,” as Paddy says. We, however, had the satisfaction of eating
him, and as it was cold weather he kept well, hung up for thirty-two days. One
haunch I forwarded to the Amoy Race Dinner and the guests declared it excellent.
Our trade was principally in opium, and our average sales per month about
150 boxes, 150 per month each ship, or a total of 300. In exchange we received
gold and silver dollars, sugar, rice, oil cake, and camphor.
A flourishing trade was done in sugar ; at first it was bought and shipped at
one dollar per picul and bought in Shanghai at over three dollars, large quantities
being here used for dying silks. Latterly the Chinamen have chartered ships and
■shipped it on their own account.
In rice there is still a good trade done, as it yields a good profit for simply
taking it across to Amoy.
There is only a certain quantity of oil cake made yearly and this is all bought
for the Amoy market. In fact, I used to buy it all myself before it was made.
Captains Howard, Rorie, and I had occasionally to go to the city of Taiwanfoo.
Sometimes we rode thither on horseback, and at others in a kind of sedan chair,
carried by three men. There were eight resting stations, and at one of them,
Arkontiem, which is a large town on the banks of a river flowing into a salt-water
lake, in length six miles by two in breadth, we generally had a chance to bag some
wild fowl.
Taiwanfoo is an immense walled city, and is in fact the capital of the island. It is
situate about two miles from the coast, and it has been estimated that its inhabi-
tants number 100,000 souls (if Chinamen have souls). The city is well built,
although some parts of it are falling into decay. Whenever we were at Taiwanfoo
we put up at Goe Loutea’s house. His name means “fifth mandarin,” but in
reality he was the head man of the island of Formosa, and owned a large tract of
country and the greater part of the camphor monopoly. He lodged and fed us like
princes, both he and his sons paying us every attention.
Upon Captain Tho, O’Sullivan’s representation, he fitted up a palace next to


Ms own for tlie reception of the British Consul, whose arrival was then expected
to enforce the new treaty. The Consul, however, left the greater part of this
business to the traders. I had the job of taking him to Taiwanfoo, and of bringing
him away again some time afterwards. The distance from our ship’s anchorage
at Takow to Taiwanfoo, was about twenty-five miles, and we accomplished the
journey in seven or eight hours by chair, and about four and a half on horseback.
The journey necessitates the crossing of several streams, and it is only safe to'
go well armed and prepared for robbers.
You pass through different districts under the command of local mandarins,
the head mandarin of Taiwanfoo having very little power over them. They occa-
sionally go to war with each other, district against district, town against town,
and one side of a ditch against the other. Those with most money to spare
employ braves to go and fight for them, whose interest it is to spin the battle out
to an indefinite length, or as long as the cash lasts. They fill bags with sand, lie
down behind them, and when each is behind his bag, with perhaps some mud
bricks piled up, he blazes away with matchlock at mud bricks and bag opposite
Mm. In one case a war between one end of a village and the other to settle the
right of using some water lasted three months, with only one killed, and his death
was an accident, he having got on the wrong side of his bag at which another fellow
was popping. Several of our party walked from one side of the village to the
other, when they all down matchlocks, and came to have a look at the Whana, or
Barbarians. They grinned and tasted our brandy, and when we left them they
resumed their matchlocks, and commenced popping at each other’s bags. Morning
and evening was their favourite time ; in the middle of the day they mutually
knock off to work in the Paddy field; at last one day the head soldier man-
darin requested us to go and witness how quickly he would settle the dispute.
We accordingly went, taking with us a guard of Manila men, with Enfield’s in
case of a disturbance. His Highness the Bed Button Mandarin, called the dis-
putants before him by a crier or headsman. They all down on their marrow
bones, and beat a tatoo on the ground with their foreheads, presenting at the
same time a red paper slip containing their grievance. Some he admonished and
threatened, and others he had gently patted on the back and feet with a wooden
batten. The two richest he had secured by the tail until they had stumped up
1000 dollars, and quartered fifty soldiers on their place for a month. After a
good feed and a “Chin Chin ” he started for Petou (his home) altogether having
made a good day’s work, and being considerably in pocket by his operations. I
also did very well, for I sold him an old broken down troop horse for 250 dollars,
and another to his secretary for 150 dollars, they respectively having cost me
in Amoy 150 and 50 dollars. That which was purchased by the secretary, was as
blind as a bat, and when one of his men mounted her to try her, she charged
straight at a brick wall which was in front of her, and coming right against it
lodged her rider on terra jirma t’other side. I immediately endeavoured to per-
suade him that that showed how brave she was. He appeared to be quite as
well satisfied with his bargain as I was myself, and having brought a chest of
opium with us done up in Chinese travelling trunks, and our provision basket, we
sold it for cash at a good profit, in addition to which it escaped both duty and
Liekam.


CHAPTER 111.
FORMOSA. —AN EXCURSION INLAND.
Without, I hope, feeling wearied, you have now entered upon the third chapter
of this yarn. The morning of the Bth of August, 1860, broke with an awfully
wild appearance of both sea and sky. The bar. standing at 29 'OO, blowing hard
from N.E., and every indication of a rapidly approaching typhoon. Doubling
the shore fastenings, and sending the lower yards on deck, we left nothing stand-
ing save the lower masts. Rolled up the awnings, and prepared, in every way,
for the now momentarily expected gusts. At 8 a.m. the gusts from the hills were
frightful—bar. 29.20. At 9 a.m., the hurricane had increased, if anything, and
squalls and whirlwinds came sweeping along with irresistible fury. The sea was
breaking clean over the island at the entrance to the harbour, the wind shifting
in heavy gusts to IST. W. and S.W. The barometer now standing to go up. About
midnight, and during a terrific gust, both anchors came home, and we went broad-
side on to the beach. When day broke the wind had decreased to a heavy S.W.
gale. We then got out the anchors, hove off the beach, and remoored the vessel.
On the 10th the Danneverke arrived from Hong Kong, reporting having encoun-
tered the typhoon, which from Takow had travelled across towards Hong Kong with
increasing violence, expending itself on the China coast after having done immense
damage. The 14th saw the Wild Wave and Yindex, both off the Port, they
having raced over from Amoy, the Yindex coming in sight half an hour before the
Wild Wave. These vessels had only met the latter end of the typhoon, but when
they arrived the sea was so heavy on the Takow bar, that we could only commu-
nicate with them by signals. Next day we crossed the bar in a cutter, and
received our letters and despatches. Mr. English, the paymaster of H.M.S.
Acorn, was this trip a passenger by the Yindex, and had come on a visit to us.
The Yindex crossed the bar on the 16th, and we then planned a trip to Peton and
to the foot of the mountains, but we were obliged to postpone it until the Wild
Wave, Commodore, Captain Thos. O’Sullivan, was despatched to Hong Kong. Cap-
tain O’Sullivan was the ablest and oldest captain in the employ of Messrs. Jardine,
Matheson & Co., and was one of the kindest-hearted men that ever breathed.
The Wild Wave got away on the Sunday, and on Monday, the 20th, we started
on our trip—some of us on horseback, and others in chairs. Captains Rorie,
Howard, Roper, Mr. English, and I, crossed the river by Sartachui, passed
through the town and called on the head man. We then proceeded across the
Paddy fields, steering about S.E., making Petou city, which was at a distance
of about seventeen miles from our ships. We found it a walled city, containing
about 50,000 inhabitants, and doing a large trade with the natives of the moun-
tains. Petou is the principal city at the south end of the Formosa.
We found the house of a Chinaman named Atto, who trades largely in opium.
He received us demonstratively, and introduced us to both civil and military
mandarins, who were very gracious to us. We distributed any quantity of Illus-
trated London News, and traded in stereoscopic views, watches, &c. Atto gave
us a good spread, and found guides to conduct us towards the mountains. They
evidently did not like our going further inland. We, however, started; but
when we reached the foot of the range our guides refused to go any further. We
scrambled about for a bit, bagging game, and getting a peep at the mountain
natives, who instantly made off for the hills as if we had been emissaries in the
employ of His Satanic Majesty. We eventually succeeded in purchasing a few
mats, spears, trinkets, &c., from them. We knew that there was gold here-
abouts, did not know where to find it, but received some in exchange for
opium. Tired of this place, the guides conducted us by a shorter road to Petou.
We put up for that night at Atto’s house, all sleeping on the flat roof. Before
retiring, we showed ourselves to the crowd in the street, had a dance, and gave
those nearest us some beer, they wishing us to take some samshaw in exchange.
The ladies seemed very anxious to get a peep at us behind the curtains.


and after we had retired got on the neighbouring roofs to try and see
ns. When, however, we opened a conversation in Chinese (Formosa dialect)
they vanished, but continued talking about us and giggling. At daylight we
struck southward, making Tongkan, purposing to have some shooting, and then
return to the vessels by the sea beach. After journeying about six hours we came
to a river spanned by a granite bridge. On its banks were the remains of
a large city that had evidently been well built of granite and brick. There
were very few inhabitants, and these only lived in hovels near the river. We
shot some water-hen, curlew, plover, and snipe in this locality. The weather
commencing to look threatening, we crossed a fish dam and made tracks along the
beach towards our ships. On the way we passed the bones of an immense sperm
whale, which some fisherman had, captured about two months previously. About
6 p.m, we arrived safely at Takow, very weary, but all the better for our excur-
sion. About this time some of us nearly lost our lives. We went to dine on
board a vessel in the roadstead, and whilst so engaged a storm arose, causing a
heavy break of water on the bar. We made all haste to reach the port before
dark, but were retarded by a strong ebb tide; there was a heavy sea tumbling on the
bar by the time we reached it. Several seas broke into the boat, and she was in
imminent danger of being swamped, until at last I was driven to put her head out to
sea again, and by hard work we managed to regain the ship which we had left in
the afternoon. The captain had been keeping a careful watch for us, and burning
a bright light, otherwise we should not have succeeded in reaching her. The fol-
lowing day we got safely into the harbour, but even then had a narrow escape in
crossing the bar. This was a lesson to us not to venture outside again in unsettled
weather.
On the Ist September, we received orders from head quarters to prepare for
any emergency, as the Pirates were on the coast and purposed attacking the
station. We up masts and yards and got everything ready, fixing a target on
the sand-bank at 1000 yards, and once a week exercised both small and great
guns. Several heavily armed pirates soon came into the harbour, some flying
the Portugese flag, but as they saw we were fully prepared they did not attack us.
Several Mandarin soldiers, and two of our own men were, however, killed
ashore, by the Pirate men ; our ships thereupon consulted went to quarters and
sent a message to the Pirates to stand out to sea, otherwise we should open fire.
After a great deal of noise, and firing a few shots over their vessels and the town
opposite, they saw that we were in earnest and therefore departed.
We wished to avoid an action, as they carried a larger number, and heavier
guns, than we did, and a much larger crew. From Takow they went down the
coast, and plundered and burnt Tongkan.
I afterwards saw one of them, the captive of an English gun-boat.
CHAPTER IV.
A CRUISE AFTER PIRATE VESSELS ON THE FORMOSA COAST.
It will be recollected that the receiving ships in harbour at the termination of the
last chapter were my own, Sin Tauka, and the Science, in charge of Mr. Howard
and owned by my former employers Messrs. Dent and Co. On the 16th of Sep-
tember we received an official visit from the mandarin of the port, seeking our
assistance in an attack against the Pirates who had captured several trading
vessels belonging to the trading village of Nangaleow, and which were loaded with
rice for the Science, being part payment for opium they had received. The man-
darin opium trader represented to us that unless assisted in putting down the


Pirates of this particular town, they would he unable to pay for the opium they
had already received, and that their coasting trade would be entirely destroyed.
After a consultation with the mandarin we agreed to assist them, he paying all
expenses for amunition, provisions, &c., and allowing us prize money should we
be successful. One of his mandarins accompanied us with a banner of authority,
and to point out the place, junks, and chief Pirate, we took two interpreters so
that we might make no mistake.
The following day we prepared the cutter Pearl of three guns, one long twelve-
pounder swivel gun, amidships, and two brass cannonade sixes on a raised quarter
deck. The Pearl was thirty-five tons, of great beam, and light draught, had been
built expressly for running opium, and sailed remarkably fast. I also took my
cutter, of twelve oars with a six-pounder in the bow, and a complement of fourteen
lascars, six Manilamen, three Europeans, and Mr. Taylor the commander of the
Pearl. Captain Howard and I assumed joint command of the cutter. We had
a good supply of small arms, an Enfield rifle for each man, and six breech-
loaders ; each man had a sword, and we had four revolvers ready for close work.
Our pilot was the escaped master of one of the captured junks. We cleared
Takow at three p.m., everything in tip top order, stationed and exercised the
men : light wind and smooth water.
We had left our ships in charge of the chief officers with written instructions,
in case of accident.
Portachui, the pirate port, was 52 miles IST.W. of Takow, inside sand banks,
and had, up to this time, never been entered by Europeans. We parbuckled the
twelve-oared cutter in board, and made but slow progress during the night. At
daylight we were off Arkon Teim in a calm, anchored in six fathoms water, exer-
cised our men, and cleaned our arms. A fisherman, from whom we purchased
some fish, told us that the junks then in sight were pirates, but there being no
wind we could not r get near them, and they drifted away to the South out of
range. At 3 p.m. on Tuesday we raised the anchor, and proceeded slowly north-
ward with a very light air.
At midnight, it again fell calm and we anchored in five fathoms, offVoloy
shoal. We put out the cutter and sent her to go and sound, and found that at
low water it was only covered by about two feet.
Next day with both land and sea breezes we make Portachui about noon ; it
was a large fortified town, surrounded with dykes and ditches; there were several
sand banks, but as it was then high water we stood boldly in, anchored in five
fathoms water inside the first sand bank, across a bar with about two and a half
fathoms, and within 1000 yards of the town and a fort, which lay to the eastward.
We manned the cutter with fourteen men and the six-pounder field piece, and
put a spring on the Pearl’s chain from the port quarter, piped all hands to quarters
and hailed a fisherman, by whom we sent a message to the chief of the town
demanding the restoration of the junks within one hour. As we lay at anchor we
could see the junks beached and gutted close under the fort. In about half an
hour, the Chief man sent his son and four other men to spy our force. The
master of the captured junk knew them, as they had assisted in torturing him on
a previous occasion. We took the liberty of detaining them as hostages, sending
a message ashore to that effect. About 10 o’clock, a message came from the chief
Pirate, wishing us to go ashore to treat with him. I went on board the cutter
with an interpreter, and pulled up the serpentine channel towards the forts, with
the twofold object of shewing them that we did not fear them, and wished to
treat with them. I also intended, if we were thus far successful, to burn
the junks and set fire to the town, as those houses near the water were built
of bamboo and thatched. By doing this we expected to draw their attention from
the forts, and so, perhaps, get a chance to spike the big guns, which would have
been a complete victory. The plan, however, did not succeed, for when about
half way to the shore, it being half ebb, we took the ground, and could not find a
channel deep enough to take the boat up. The men had therefore to get out and.
back the boat into deep water, and while so occupied, the temptation offered to the


pirates was very great; they rushed at us and endeavoured to obtain our rifles and
guns, at the same time discharging a gingal at us ; one shot carried my cap away and
two of our men were wounded. I ordered half our party to open fire, while the re-
mainder backed stern out so as to give our six-pounder in the bows working power.
The crowd on the beach was very dense and quite close to us. I gave the order ‘ ‘ fire, ”
and almost while I spoke a “bang and deafening yells” showed that our charge of
grape had done its work ; and gure enough it had cleared quite a lane through
them ; the rest ran for the cover of the banks near the forts, and we assisted them
in their flight with a dose of round shot. The Pearl also fired at them over our
heads; we got back safely, moored the cutter to the Pearl on the seaward
side. We still wished to treat with them if possible. I hoisted a white flag, but
they answered by hoisting a black flag and firing a shot at us from the forts, which
whizzed over head, and struck fair on the bar, showing that the guns had evidently
been trained for the entrance of the harbour ; and as these guns were fixtures we
-considered ourselves pretty safe from their fire. We had, however, to fear being
stormed by numbers during the night, as the rascals, at low water, could come
within ten yards of us ; and as they could easily bridge this distauce with their
bamboo catamarans it behoved us to prepare for them, or leave the harbour before
■ dark if possible.
We hauled down the white flag, ran up the British ensign, and opened a rapid
fire of shot and shell from the guns of the Pearl against the forts and town. The
five captives we placed in irons and put below with a guard to watch them. The
forts kept blazing away at us, but had as yet failed to strike us. They now hauled
the black flag down and waved it along the sand banks, and inland, swarms of men
continued to come into the town; in fact, they were getting reinforcements from
all quarters. We fired several shots at the junks as they were hauled up on the
beach, and succeeded in riddling them so that they conld not be made ready for
use. We had also committed great havoc on the town; houses were knocked
down or on the verge of falling, and in one place the shells had set fire to it.
At 4 in the afternoon (low water) the enemy had taken advantage of the sands
and ditches, and crept close to us, and were now firing at us with matchlocks.
They had also got some light kind of gingals to bear upon us from one of the sand
banks, with which they several times hit us. One of the interpreters was wounded
and one of the lascars killed. I now sent Mr. Taylor with the cutter to try and
intercept the gingal party, but directly they saw him approaching they took to
their heels and made a bolt for the fort, thus giving us a second chance to help
them along with round shot. The cutter captured one gingal and several match-
locks, and then returned to the Pearl.
While we had been thus employed, a large party crept round the banks astern
of us and opened fire, their first shot killing one of our Manilamen and wounding
several others, and myself slightly.
We slewed round the swivel in double-quick time, and gave them a heavy dose
of grape, which left the sand bank covered with dead and wounded ; a second
shot of grape completed the work we had commenced so well, aod now the vagabonds
ceased firing and made for the town. We also ceased firing, and surveyed our
damage. Our bulwarks, galley, and mast were slightly hurt, and the cutter had
a hole through her, which was immediately repaired. We bound up the flesh
wounds received by the crew, and placed the two dead men in the hold.
Our prisoners were in great terror lest we should behead them when they saw
our dead men, and we found that one of the mandarins had been threatening them
with torture. To silence him, we threatened to put him ashore on one of the
sandbanks and leave him to the tender mercies of the pirates, and this had the
effect we desired. We were now caught in a trap; it was five o’clock with a
strong ebb tide, leaving us no chance of getting out that night, All hands, in-
cluding our prisoners, had supper and a glass of grog. As the flood came in a good
many fishing catamaran arrived ; we allowed them to pass, and from one bought
some fine fish, paid for them with Mexicans, and sent a letter from the mandarin,
tojhe chief man ashore, demanding money for the rice and junks.


We could see from tlie ship that a great many messengers were despatched by
different roads inland, probably for reinforcements and perhaps better artillery, as
we were aware that they had been using better guns against the mandarin’s troops
inland. All firing had ceased, and as we wished to harbour our strength in case
■of an attack in the night, we set a double watch and guard, loaded midship guns
with grape, quarter-decks with canister and broken soda water bottles, and the
gun in the bows of the cutter, with glass and broken bottles.
The night proved very dark. At ten p. m., the tide reached its full height, the
wind blowing hard from the N., the barometer going down very fast, and giving
every indication of an approaching typhoon. It was too dark to attempt to
leave the harbour, but we feared, that if caught in a typhoon within it, all
hands would perish. While contemplating our situation, I noticed a catamaran
close to, hailed in Chinese, and was answered by the fisherman from whom we had
purchased the fish; he came alongside and told us we were to be attacked at low
water, and advised us to get out if possible. This I was afraid to attempt at dark,
-and after consulting Captain Howard, we determined to remain at anchor until
daylight, for if in attempting to put to sea, we touched, we should most probably
be lost. We rewarded the fisherman and let him see the captives, that he might
report ashore that they were alive and well treated. We recommended him not to
come near us again that night lest he should get a stray shot.
Midnight. Blowing still harder, bar. 29'80. There were plenty of lights
burning about the shore, but we could hear no noise on account of the wind. Kept
an anxious watch until 4 a.m., and could then descry a number of figures moving
along the banks, and rafts approaching us. Hailing them in Chinese we re-
ceived no answer, on which the sentry discharged his rifle at them. In an
instant they set up a furious yell; the multitudes ashore rushing towards us, and
those in boats towards our cable. “ Steady lads, and fire.” Bang, bang, bang,
went our three guns one after the other, and then a deafening rattle from our
small arms. All the time the gunners were reloading with grape and broken glass.
The enemy gave us one volley, but not a shot took effect; whereas our first dis-
charge caused them to break and fly. As day broke we could see them gathering
in great numbers with gingals, matchlocks, and spears. The forts opened fire
again, and the weather looked extremely bad. We run a kedge out to the K. W.,
towards the bar, so that we might haul out as the tide made, preparatory to a bold
push at high water. It was evidently our only chance as a typhoon had com-
menced in earnest.
Mr. Taylor, with eight men in the cutter, guarded the kedge and lines. The
enemy saw what we were about, and, determined to try and prevent our ac-
complishing our object by attacking us on all sides ; some swam to the kedge line
to cut it, but our rifles turned them over one after the other. One had succeeded
in getting hold of the line, but was killed with a revolver bullet just in time to
save the line. The tide made very rapidly, owing to the strong wind, this being
immensely in our favour and carrying their shots wide of us.
We repulsed several determined attacks before 8 a.m., and must have killed
an immense number as all our shots told well. At nine o’clock we had warped
up to the kedge, got the cutter alongside, up jib, tripped the kedge, and ran up a
closed-reefed mainsail, standing straight for the bar.
The pirates now made a frantic rush towards us, but were too late, enabling
us, however, to give them a smart parting salute, after which we secured the guns,
dashed over the bar in two and a half fathoms of water, rounded to and hoisted
in the cutter. A catamaran came out to us with a white flag flying, wishing to
treat for the captives, but as the storm was rapidly increasing we could not wait,
but told them to send to the mandarin of Taiwanfoo and Petou. We now
bore straight away for Takow, under triangle-sail, square-sail, and main-sail, and
jib-stowed. A furious gale blowing, bar. 29 ‘6O, and the vessel literally flying
through the water. By 4 p.m. we were off fort Zelinda, and saw two large junks
riding at anchor, the seas breaking clean over them; we afterwards heard that
they were lost during the night and all hands drowned.


It was now so dark that we could not see land, and had to steer by sounding.
At 7 p.m. we thought we must have run the distance and hauled in but did not
shoal the water so fast as we expected, we therefore conchided that we had over*
run the port, and could hear the breakers ashore. We tacked and stood out under
close-reefed main-sail and stay-sail; took the bonnet off the jib, reefed and set it.
A partial clearance in the weather enabled us to get a glance of the Saracen’s Head,
proving that we had over-run our distance by about a couple of miles. At 10 p.m.
we were off Takow, and fired a gun, the vessels inside burning blue lights. The
wind was now blowing with terrific force and a tremendous sea breaking on the
bar. I stood her at it however, cleared it and the Heads safely, and ran her nose
on the mud, close to captain Howard’s vessel. It being too dark to choose an
anchorage we made her fast to the shore, shifted the provisions into the Science,
and all hands went to their respective vessels to strike yards and masts, as it was
now blowing quite a typhoon.
Thus ended our cruise after the pirates. It had been only a partial success,
and the reader knows how nearly a failure. We had gone thither underrating
the Chinese who fought well and stood any amount of killing ; and, had we been
half-an-hour later in getting away we should probably have been lost in the
typhoon; besides which our ammunition was exhausted.
The chief of Portachui afterwards paid a heavy ransom for his son and four
comrades. My share was 300 dollars, and all the others received portions accord-
ing to their rank. I regret to say that the Toutai, of Taiwan, broke faith with
the pirate chief, for he allowed the prisoners to get clear of the city, but had them
intercepted on the road and murdered. War still continues between this place
and the mandarins. Pirates will always be found along these sand banks, and
all vessels trading on this coast ought to be well manned and armed, and always
ready for action.
CHAPTER Y.
I spent Christmas Day, 1860, ashore in the house of Coe Loutea, in the city of
Taiwanfoo. I had come hither with Captain O'Sullivan, of the Wild Wave, on
duty, he engaging with Loutea to get the camphor monopoly contract, and have
released a quantity of sugar which was seized for liekam dues. We, each armed
with a Colt’s revolver and sword, waited upon Tontai and had an angry dis-
cussion with him, threatening him with all sorts of revenge if he failed to deliver
up the sugar at once, or send us a stamped order for its delivery. Bounce carried
the day, he released the sugar, visiting us at Loutea’s house, tasting our brandy,
and altogether, made himself quite agreeable.
Captain 0 ‘Sullivan engaged a house for the British Consul and arranged with
Loutea to put it in order, as we expected his arrival on an early day.
On the 26th, having secured the sugar, we returned in the Wild Wave to
Takow, and I resumed my position in my own vessel.
This season we were visited with one of the Egyptian plagues in the form of
millions of locusts, which came with a S. E. wind and covered miles upon miles of
the island, remaining three days and suddenly disappearing, after having eaten
every green thing in the place. In some places the dead locusts were lying twelve
or fourteen inches deep. Our crews fed on them, cooking them in various ways,
curried, boiled, stewed, and making chutney with them. I tasted, but did not
relish them. Bice rose in price at a jump, and sales of opium were not nearly so
brisk. The poorer classes had to live on sweet potatoes and flying fish, vast
numbers of which are caught in a curious fashion. Fishermen go out on dark


nights in their bamboo catamarans, with a net twenty-four inches high, rigged
round them. When ready to fish they form in line, each raft burning a bright
fire in an earthen vessel. The smaller rafts pull away some distance and then
beat furiously on gongs and blow horns. The line of rafts gradually curves until
it has made the circle and the frightened fish fly for the fires and are secured in
the boats by nets. Shoals are taken in this way very rapidly. It is a grand sight
when a large number of rafts go out. The whole water appears to be on fire and
looks like a city on the sea, or, as a cockney remarked, “like Regent-street at night
underweigh. ”
I was awakened one night about this time with an alarm of fire, and found
volumes of smoke coming up through the cabin skylight,—we did not use the cabin
to sleep in, as it was too warm, but lived under a double awning with closed curtains.
We fastened down all the hatches, mustered the hands, and placed a lookout man
at each gangway to prevent any of the men deserting, as they made a general rush
to save their own baggage. We then formed two gangs of men to hand buckets of
water along to myself and the gunner. We went into the cabin and after being
nearly suffocated we succeeded in extinguishing the fire. We had had a very narrow
escape, for the fire had reached to within a foot of our powder magazine. We
could never ascertain how it originated, but our suspicions fell upon the butler,
and I discharged him.
On the 28th April we had a strong gale from the S.W., with rain, thunder,
and lightning—high seas breaking over the bar. We saw five junks in the offing
making for the harbour, under low sail. The ebb tide was too strong for the sail
they carried, consequently, when they reached the break they hung there, one
turning right over, driving her masts clean through her bottom and drowning all
hands. The others anchored just inside the worst break, but were fast dragging
towards the breakers, where crowds of wreckers awaited them. I could not
remain longer and see them all drowned or speared, which is the fate of all cast-
aways on this coast. I therefore called for a volunteer crew for the cutter, and
more offering than I required, I picked the best of them, made them strip to their
trousers and take a kedge and coir line in the boat. Mr. Taylor waited just inside
with another boat and crew, in case I required assistance. When I got between
the heads, I let fall the kedge, veering away on the coir hauling line until we got
alongside the first junk and secured it ; we then warped up to the kedge where
Mr. Taylor with a bay line relieved us of this junk, we returning and saving the
rest in like manner; the last was, however, in the breakers before we reached him,
and the poor wretches were in a great state of terror. We ourselves, ran a great
risk and got swamped several times, some of the crew getting severely bruised.
One of our Manilamen behaved splendidly and swam like a fish—when a roller
came he dived through, it clutching the line and clambei’ing up the junk’s side
before the next roller reached him, then again, he would leap from the junk into
the surf and be alongside the cutter when required. The following day the owner
and crews visited us, bringing us poultry, eggs, fruit, and samshaw (the owner was
one of our largest opium purchasers), the men dropped on their knees, struck the
deck with their foreheads, and chin-chined me very much. I was glad when it
was over and distributed the gifts amongst the crew. The owner became one of
our best customers until his death, which, owing to his excessive fatness, took
place about six months later. We got nothing substantial for salvage, but the
news of the rescue went along the coast and inland, and my Chinese name became
known from one end of Formosa to the other. This subsequently proved of
frequent use to me.
During April and May sperm whale and hawksbill turtle visit this coast. I
have seen twenty whales in a season, and turtles can be purchased at three dollars
each.
On the 20th May, 1861, the steamer Hellespont anchored in the roads, having
towed the Pathfinder from Amoy to relieve me and the Sin Tauka. I piloted the
Pathfinder into the harbour in the afternoon, the Hellespont sailing the same night
for Hong Kong.


On the 23rd of May we transferred all our drug and treasure to the Pathfinder,
cast off and moored midharbour. On the 24th, hauled down Jardine, Matheson,
and Co.’s flag, hoisting our private house flag instead, as the charter with Jardine,
Matheson, and Co. expired that day. I then chartered her to Atto, the Chinaman
before spoken of, for 1000 dollars for the run over to Amoy, being allowed ten
lay days.
June 3rd, I crossed the bar, bound to Amoy, and met the barque Ternate,
which had come to relieve the Science ; the latter vessel was sold to a Chinaman,
and broken up for firewood. On the 4th, the brig commenced leaking badly, not
having been filled with cargo for more than three years. I received eight extra
men from the Pathfinder for the run across. Clapped on both pumps and kept
them constantly going, they proving just sufficient to keep her free. At 8 p.m. we
weighed anchor, proceeded on our voyage, and arrived safely in Amoy harbour,
on the 7th June, after an absence of thirteen months. We moored off the town,
lightened ship and stopped the leak.
CHAPTER VI.
On the 20th of June, 1861, I chartered the vessel to Atto for six months, at
1000 dollars per month, all pilotage and port dues to be paid by him. I. calcu-
lated that this would be a very profitable undertaking, as the vessel would
principally be in harbour, and thus escape wear and tear. I arrived at Takow
after a very fine passage, and on the sth July H. M. S. gunboat Cockchafer
arrived with Consul R. Swinhoe and staff. He was the first British Consul
appointed to Formosa. I received a letter from Captain Fitzgibbon, the owner of
my brig, asking me to render whatever assistance he might require ; he wished
me to pilot the gunboat along the coast to Taiwanfoo. This I did, anchoring
there off Fort Zelinda, in four fathoms of water, and warning the Lieutenant in
command to stand out to sea directly a south-wester set in. I went ashore in a
fishing boat with my servant, taking a message to Loutea that the Consul had
arrived, and wished to laud in state the following day. I purposed returning to
my vessel overland, as she was ready for sea, and there were indications of an
approaching gale.' I reached Loutea’s house at 8 p.m, quite exhausted and sick,
having fasted all day, owing to the want of courtesy shown by Lieutenant Holder,
the commander of the gunboat, who had not the grace to offer me any thing. I
delivered the Consul’s message, hired chairs, and at midnight was lowered over
the walls of the city. The gates were shut at 8 p.m., as the country was at war
with the city. We were passing round a village about 10 p.m., when a band of
armed men stopped us and said we could not proceed until daylight, as there were
robbers in the neighbourhood who had set fire to their village. One house was in
flames, and gave sufficient light to enable us to see that the party round us was
composed of the most villainous-looking Chinamen, armed with spears. My boy
explained that robbers or not we could not delay, but they seized our chairs,
whereupon I let out at them in Chinese, and floored the nearest with the back of
my sword. They charged at us, but as I immediately fired two barrels of my
revolver at them, they bolted with all speed for their houses. We then proceeded
without immediate interruption. Next day, as I had predicted, a strong gale
sprang up from the southward, and the chair bearers with difficulty made head
way against it. I was too sick to walk, and having fasted too long in the first
instance, my stomach refused the Chinese dainties procurable on the road. The
chair bearers now wished to give up, but by dint of threatenings they carried me
to within two miles of the ships, and then dropped us in a ditch and bolted across
the river. I was too sick to walk, but fortunately some junk men, to whom I


had been of some service, came by and carried me down to my ship.
Next day the Cockchafer came back with the Consul still aboard, who went
overland instead of landing near the city.
On the 17th, having recovered from my sickness, I crossed the bar for Amoy,
made another trip back to Takow, and run some opium, upon which we made a
good profit.
I sailed for Shanghai on the 21st of August, rice laden, all going well until in
lat. 29 - 09 N., long. 122° 20' E., the wind N. E. by N., bar. 29 - 7, weather threat-
ening, and the vessel bearing to the eastward on port tack. I concluded that I
could not find shelter before the storm broke, and therefore endeavoured to get as
much offing as possible; bar. still falling fast, and wind momentarily increasing.
By midnight we had shortened sail, carrying double-reefed topsail and storm
staysail, and at daylight on the 30th only close-reefed main topsail, top-gallant,
and royal yards, and fore-top gallant mast, were sent on deck. At noon, with the
bar. 29 ‘SO, we were under bare poles, and Eolus had let loose the Spirit of the
Storm with a vengeance. The clouds rolled along in dense masses, the sea and
heavens blending together, obscuring from sight every object beyond the ship’s
rail. We now battened everything down, turned the quarter boat bottom up on
the quarter-deck, and made all the crew creep under her, except the mate and
gunner, who stood by me with axes ready to cut the masts away if necessary.
We each had a lashing round our waists, and there was a tremendous cross sea on;
one high wave would strike on one bow, and a second on the other; now one
astern, then one on the bow; each one larger than the last, and threatening to
engulph the vessel. She was plunging, lurching, surging, and groaning terribly.
The roar and shriek of the wind was now something awful; bar. 28 ‘9O. At
midnight the typhoon had increased, if anything, or, as Jack says, “ Eresh hands
had gone to the bellows, ” and if it was possible to blow harder, it blew harder
then. With one mighty roar the spanker went from the boom, although we had
double-lashed it. We were perfectly helpless and at the mercy of the elements ;
nor could we stir ; in fact, had it not been for the lashings round our waists, we
should long ere this have been blown overboard. Everything was carried off the
deck, and the bulwarks blown clean away. In the height of the gale we could not
ascertain how low the bar. had fallen, as we remained lashed until the wind
abated. At 3 a.m., during a slight lull in the storm, we saw a large ship disap-
pear close under our lee; she looked like the Flying Dutchman, —there one
second, and gone the next. It proved, however, to have been the Malakoff,
British ship, foundering. A few of the crew were saved by a dismasted vessel,
lying a little to leeward of her. We were all more dead than alive, and the wind
veering to the eastward blew with renewed fury. A temporary lull enabled us to
get a biscuit and glass of grog, which removed the cold clammy feeling we had
previously had. Death still hovered round us. At noon we got a look at the
bar. —29 - 00 —and I placed our position in lat. 28’33 N., long. 122 - 28 E. It con-
tinued to blow a hurricane all day, the gusts being too severe to show any canvas.
At night it took off, and we got the close-reefed topsail set, and at midnight set
still more sail. Leaving the deck to change my clothes, I heard the words—
“ Hush! Listen! Captain—a schooner close to! No—A Bock !” What was
that lump in my throat ? It soon Avent, and I gave one spring on deck. A
look to leeward revealed a rock right abeam and close to (I thought, it’s all up
with us, but, if we must die, let us see what we can do first.) To a willing crew
I now gave orders “Hand—in—the —chains ! Set—the—courses ! Out—all-
reefs ! Up—jib—bear a hand and make all the sail you can, sir ! Cut the gaskets
booker lier-lacas lacas booker, trinket, burrah sail ancha jib putong gasket lacas
lacas. Down—Avith—your—tacks—and aft sheets ! Bun your topsails up ; none
of your yahooing here ; run away with them. Jump, you beggars ! Well done,
my boys! bravely done! How much water there?” “ Seven fathoms, sir.”
“ All right. There she jumps to it; Avell done, old girl, you’ll do it yet! Is the
jib up ? ” “Yes sir,” “Take another pull on your lee braces! Clean full—
don’t shake a rag —or .” “ Clean full it is, sir.” “Is the anchor clear ?”


“ No, sir ; chain foul.” “ Stand by all.” “Half six, hard bottom.” “Silence!
fore and aft.” Thank God ! she just cleared the perpendicular face of the rock
by a bare yard, the spray from the receding wave falling on our deck. From the
first order until she cleared the rocks did not occupy as much time as I have taken
to write it, and I never saw men work better, —they were like giants in strength
for the time.
At daybreak it proved to be the Shung Rock, off the Taichow group. Find-
ing more land ahead, I had the chain cleared, ran in and anchored in Chychow
anchorage. Having four feet of water in our well, we pumped out, and put all in
order. The following day we proceeded on our voyage, and when off the island of
Video, September 6th, met another typhoon travelling towards the China coast.
Carried a press of canvas, seeking shelter. Anchoring off the S.W. end of Pootoo
Isle, in 9 fathoms, we sent yards and masts below, and rode the gale out; it
lasted three days, and blew nearly as hard as the first : bar. 29 T 5. We lost
three anchors and chains here, as they became so imbedded that when the gale
terminated we could not purchase them. The supercargo, a Chinaman, said Josh
was against him going to Shanghai this voyage, and wished me to go to Ningpo
instead.
With one more narrow escape, the vessel getting high and dry on the spit
during the night, Dame Fortune ceased to persecute us, and we arrived safely at
Ningpo, without further mishap, on the 16th of September. On our arrival our
China charterers chin-chined Josh very much.
CHAPTER VII.
ENGAGEMENT WITH PIRATES OPE HOWBTOW BAY.
November Ist, 1866, I was off Takow, having called at Taiwaifoo en route, and
landed five chests of drug. I found the Consul at Takow waiting for a chance to
cross to Amoy, as he had got tired of his Consulship at Taiwan, and purposed
removing to Tamsui instead. While staying here we went on many shooting
excursions with him, and lived most luxuriously. On the 7th we sailed for Amoy
with the Consul, Vice-Consul, and staff as passengers. We called at one of the
Pescadore islands, and learned that a vessel had been wrecked on the outer island,
and all hands drowned. From the appearance of the wreck we thought she must
have been a large British ship. We landed the Consul and suite at Amoy on the
12th, the British minister forgetting to pay the.passage money. We continued to
trade throughout the winter from Formosa to Amoy, carrying opium to Formosa,
and oil cake and rice to Amoy—a very profitable trade.
In April, 1862, while standing towards the China coast with a light westerly
wind, and fog so thick that we could not see past the end of the jibboom, thinking
we must have run our course, we hauled up the courses and kept the lead going, all
hands at their stations. Twenty-four fathoms of water when we ought not to have
had ten. Suddenly we heard breakers, and thereupon stood out, but anxious to make
the port we stood in again, breakers ahead and ten fathom, wore ship, and
anchoring in sixteen fathoms we lowered the quarter boat, took an interpreter and
compass, and armed the crew. Leaving word with the chief officer to keep the
bell sounding to enable me to find the vessel again, we pulled for the breakers, and
soon landed. On gaining the high ground the brig’s royals were visible above the
fog. Walking along the shore we soon observed the Obelisk on the North Point of
Hoetow Bay, and a fleet of junks at anchor inside. The brig had been visible to
their look out some time, and we learnt from some Chinamen that they were getting
underweigh to attack us, as they thought we had struck on the reef, and were in a
crippled condition, more especially as they had heard our boat put off. We made all


possible baste back to tbe brig, up anchor, and stood out, but it immediately fell
calm. I anchored with a hedge and warp, a strong current running to the north-
ward. We soon heard the junks sweeping towards us, and boats being launched
from the beach close by us, but we could not see a dozen yards from the vessel.
We were all at our quarters prepared for them, and directly the first junk showed
through the fog we gave it to them from the forecastle swivel-gun which had been
loaded with grape. The junk was sweeping across our bows, when the discharge
demolished his quarter with a tremendous crash, and put her crew into a great
state of confusion. They fired their forward guns without aim, and then turned
tail. The cannonade rent the fog, and discovered to view innumerable small junks,
all retreating. We fired away at them right and left, touching them up with
round shot until the last was under shelter of the point. We then fired at the
men and boats on the shore, the former seeking shelter among the hills, our round
shot smashing most of the boats. We must have killed a good many men on
board the junks, as they were all huddled close together, and we could scarcely
fire without hitting them. They had evidently expected to find us an easy prey,
and hence their confusion at our first discharge. With the cessation of the firing
the fog closed in again, and lest they should attack us again during the night we
made everything ready, even to boiling water, to scald them at close quarters, but
we saw no more of them. Towards morning, with a IST.W. land breeze, we
tripped anchor and proceeded slowly towards Amoy, going entirely by soundings.
On our arrival we found that the news of the attack had preceded us, the people
of Amoy knowing that a brig had succeeded in beating off the Pirates, and con-
cluding it was us from the fact that ours was the only brig in the opium trade,
and that no others were likely to go so close in for the sake of making a rapid
passage. Everyone congratulated me on our narrow escape, and the owner of the
vessel on the termination of a very profitable voyage. About this time the Pirate
Chief offered a reward for my head, and I got warned not to venture out any-
where unarmed. On my return trip to Formosa I heard that a large fleet of
heavily armed junks were lying in wait for me at the Pescadores. I shipped an
extra large crew and a couple more guns before leaving Amoy, and made Fisher’s
Island at dusk. By the time we got to Hover’s Channel it was quite dark ; and
when just clearing the Eastern Island we plunged into the middle of the fleet. I
considered it best to stand on and run through them, as they might let us pass,
taking us for some other vessel; but if I altered my course they would recognise
us, and might sink us with their heavier metal before we had a chance to escape.
With a fresh breeze from the N.W., and all sail (including studding-sails on both
sides set), we were just clear of the last one, and I was talking to the mate, congratu-
lating ourselves on our escape, when Bang—whiz-z-z came a shot over our heads
making a hole through the topmast studding-sail. “Where are you yawning
her to? Steady!” “Here, gunner, take the wheel and keep her steady. ” “Aye,
aye, sir. ” The gunner, a first-rate man for a fight, was a strapping Portuguese,
and had been with |me for years. The junks were now in full chase, making a
tremendous noise with gongs, and blazing away at us with, their guns. One or two
more holes in the studding-sails, the shots whizzing over us every second or two.
Crack!!! and our starboard boom was shot away by the iron. I hauled her upon
shore a point or two, which allowed the sails to have all the wind over the port
quarter. Slap ! came another messenger into our starboard quarter, scattering
splinters about in every direction. We had just altered our course in time to prevent
its coming right into our quarter-deck. As yet we had not fired a single shot, nor
did I intend to fire unless they came to close quarters. Another half hour and the
shots failed to reach us, and the junks hauled their wind to the westward. By
daylight we were off Takow, took the bar, and got in safely. A few days after-
wards a junk arrived which had fallen in with the same fleet. They had taken
all he had on board, and he reported that they were very savage at having allowed
us to escape. We loaded this time for Ningpo and Shanghai, so that they lost
sight of us, and from Shanghai we traded to Japan throughout the summer
months. We reached Amoy on November 12th, 1862, the vessel changing owners,
as the former owner had made his fortune and retired to his estate in Ireland.


CHAPTER VIII.
“SIN tadka” poisoned at howlung.
On the 4th of December, 1862, I sailed again for Formosa, on account of my new
owners ; and after making one trip to Takow and back, I went to Tamsui, where
we lay at anchor a considerable time, affording protection to the Europeans ashore.
One night Mr. McPhail (owner’s agent), Mr. Powell (his clerk), and I, went up the
river to Banka, taking five boxes of opium and two of treasure; we had four
Chinamen as a crew. In shoving off from the vessel I found I had left my sword
behind, but as they were a long time finding it, and it was blowing hard, I ordered
them to hoist the sail and run up the river, which we did until the high land took
away the breeze. We then put out the oars; McPhail and Powell lay down in
the stern sheets to sleep while 1 steered. When about half way to Banka I
observed a boat following us. I remarked, “why here is the jolly boat with my
sword. ” However, so soon as we ceased rowing, the boat pulled ashore on the left
bank. We were very close to it at the time. I stood up in the boat to see what
they were after, when a Chinaman ran along the bank until abreast of us, took
deliberate aim, and fired at us, the wind of the shot, as it passed my head, moving
my cap. The villain then ran back through the sugar cane towards his boat, but
one of our leaden messengers brought him to earth, whose, we could not say, as
we nearly all fired together, and discharged three rifles and three revolvers at him
and his boat. We then proceeded on our journey, rejoicing at our narrow escape.
We reached Banka, and exchanged our cargo for camphor, and then returned to
the ship. As we passed down we saw the Chinamen’s boat riddled with our shot,
and the villagers howling over the dead man.
On the 16th of February, 1863, I received a despatch from Vice-Consul Braun,
requesting me to remain at anchor abreast of the Consulate, and arm my men, as
the foreigners ashore expected an attack from the natives, and the Mandarin had
not sufficient force to repulse them. He also requested me to land an armed force
to protect the Consulate. Ordering the men to quarters, I went ashore myself
with six men, leaving the rest on board armed, and under the charge of the mate,
with strict orders to watch the shore for signals. I posted a guard at the several
Hongs, and went the round during the night every quarter of an hour, which
passed over without the expected disturbance. At noon the following day I got
orders from the Consul to land as large a force as possible, upon which I brought
fourteen men with rifles, twenty more coming from the Wild Wave, and twelve
from the Vindex under the command of Captain Caw ; in all, including the gen-
tlemen ashore, we mustered about fifty. The Consul, putting himself at our
head, we marched through the town to the farthest end, and surrounded some
houses near the water, unroofing them, and taking the inmates prisoners. These
were the head Coolie men of the town, and had thrown stones at the Consul, and
threatened to exterminate the English. We took them to the Mandarin, and the
Consul ordered him to have them flogged with bamboo, and then put in irons.
Our little demonstration had a remarkably beneficial effect, for from threatening,
John Chinaman becomes very civil. We re-embarked, leaving a guard ashore.
On the 18th of February, all being quiet here, Mr. Neil McPhail came
on board and we put out to sea, running down the coast to Teukcham, off
which place we anchored, to see if the camphor was ready for shipment. Next
day we anchored off Howlung, and in the night, during a gale, one chain parted,
the other anchor came home, and the vessel dragged out to sea. It took us
twelve hours to get this anchor up ; we then worked back and hired a rattan
cable and anchor from a junk, and found the brig rode beautifully by it, springing
and riding over the seas like a duck, and keeping the deck dry although there
was a strong gale blowing. We got a full cargo, weighed anchor, and stood across
the channel, landing Mr. McPhail and six boxes of treasure. We remained one
night off Amoy, were out of sight of the signal station before daylight, and
arrived at Hong Kong safely, landing the cargo on the sth of March. We arrived


at Amoy again on the 25th of the same month, where the brig was docked,
re-rigged, and newly coppered.
On the 18th of April, we sailed for Formosa with Mr. Hughes, Commissioner
of Customs, and Mr. Milisch, as passengers. Unfortunately we could not procure
any good officers at Amoy, and therefore had to take a foremast hand to act as
mate. While standing in towards the Formosa coast on the 19th, in 9 fathoms of
water, Mr. Hughes and I were eating dinner on deck, when crack went the fore-
top mast, carrying away with it the main mast head ; down came all the sails,
masts, and yards, into the water, and we were occupied until daylight on the 21st
picking them up and re-rigging the vessel, anchoring without further mishap at
Tamsui on the 23rd. Here we made a party to visit the sulphur springs, -and
proceeded about five miles up the river in boats ; for those that cared to ride,
chairs were waiting, but Mr. McPhail and I preferred walking, carrying our guns
ready for any chance that might offer. About three miles from the boats, in a
small rugged hollow, w r e found the sulphur springs. There were about thirty
springs, besides innumerable cracks in the ground from which the sulphur was
issuing. Some of the large springs were twenty and thirty feet across, and were
boiling and bubbling furiously; others we could not approach, on account of the
dense cloud of steam. While we remained on the outside part for a second or two,
all the metal about our persons, rings, watches, &c., &c., were stained black, About
two hundred Chinamen were at work, collecting and making the sulphur into
cakes ready for export, but I believe double this number are employed here at
times. They have sheds erected all round the holes, with three or four pair in
each, making the cakes. Adhering to the rocks around the holes are numerous
fantastically shaped pieces of sulphur. We placed some eggs in a handkerchief
and lowered them into one of the springs, and in a very short time we found them
quite hard and impregnated with sulphur : we, however, eat them, along with the
other good things we had brought with us for our tiffin. The ground around
the springs was quite hot, and to stand by one of the cracks gave one the idea
that he had approached the residence of the Arch-enemy of mankind.- After
dinner, some of the party proceeded further up the springs and had a warm bath,
which they imagined had renewed their health for another term. One of the
party, who had previously been troubled with a skin disease, was perfectly
cured. The natives warned us, through our interpreters, against one part of the
stream, in the following words :—“ Suppose you go wash there, Josh no likee,
you chop chop go downee; he pay one debil to takee you downsides, makes you
die,—what for ? Me no sabbee ; any man go that place never look seehefacee no
more.” We were not ambitious enough to try our luck, but came to the conclu-
sion that there must be quicksands there. Having thoroughly enjoyed our trip,
we then returned to our vessel.
The Ist of May was a black day in my calendar, for hearing of the where-
abouts of two deserters from my ship, Mr. Millisch and I went after them; unfor-
tunately I went wholly unarmed, but Mr. Mlilisch carried a revolver. We met
one of the men squabbling with some Chinese, and I told him, in Malay, to go
quietly back to the ship. He answered, “Yes, sir—yes, sir; I will go,” springing
towards me at the same time, and stabbing me very rapidly in thirteen places—
one rather serious on my head. As soon as I became aware what he was doing,
the knife having broken on my breast, I struck him with all my might in the
face and knocked him down. Getting up, he made at me again. I called on Mr,
Millisch to shoot him, as he had another knife, and I was beginning to faint. Mr.
Millisch’s boy ran between us with a stick and struck him across the face, and the
Chinese surrounded him with hoes and kept him from me. I dropped from weak-
ness, and Mr. Millisch then fired three shots at the man from his revolver, but I
suppose he must have missed him, as he darted into the jungle and retreated. I
was rapidly losing consciousness from loss of blood, when some Chinamen from a
village brought me some water and bathing my wounds, covered them with dry
tobacco, and bound them up from cloths off their heads. The news had, by this
time, reached the Consul, and Foreigners at Obay; and Messrs, McPhail and


Powell ran out, rifle in liand, determined to shoot the runaway. Mr. Rainbow,
of Messrs. Dent and Co., had just finished dressing my wounds, when Awung’s
dead body was brought into the British Consulate. His body had been found
lying in the mountain stream, with the lanyard of his knife twisted round his
neck, and a wound on his neck where he had sawn away at it. He had killed
himself something like a butcher kills a pig. There were no bullet wounds about
him, and he must have destroyed himself immediately after his attack upon me.
No doubt he thought when he saw me fall that he had succeeded in ending my
career. On Sunday, the 10th, we sailed for Foo Choo, with Messrs. Milisch,
McPhail, and Powell, as passengers. We anchored off Sharp Peak the following
day, and I called at Pagoda Island on my up and had my wounds dressed by Dr.
Sommerville, returning to the vessel the same night.
On the 15th I received written orders from the head of the house to go to sea
at once, and be careful not to allow my vessel to be taken by the Customs’
steamer, there being one sent expressly to search for me. I read these instructions
as orders to blow up rather than allow the vessel to be captured, and this, if
necessary, I determined to do. At daylight I proceeded to sea, and with a fair
breeze ran across the channel, anchoring off Howluug on the 17th. After watch-
ing here until the 27th, I could not get any camphor, so I returned to Tamsui,
and on the 30th landed some men, at the request of the Consul, to take some
native prisoners. On the 7th of June I anchored off Howlung again, seeking
camphor., The Salamander and Vindex were in sight, anchored off Teukcham,
and the Wild Wave beating up to her anchorage, all after camphor, and all anxious to
finish our contracts before the Customs’ cruisers found out our whereabouts. Mr.
McPhail went ashore in quest of the camphor, for which we had already paid.
The Chinese from the south side of the creek fired at him, and he took refuge in
an Amoy junk until I went with the cutter and brought him off. We now deter-
mined to attack the town and take the head men prisoners until they gave us back
our money or the camphor. We landed a party, and entered the gates of the
town without interruption. We left a guard at the gate, with orders to fire the
adjacent houses if we were attacked. McPhail and I, with an interpreter, and
six of our best men, proceeded to the house of the head man, entered, and took
him prisoner, much to his astonishment. We immediately saw that he had plenty
of camphor, and that he had received news of the steamer’s coming on the coast,
and hoped we should be taken, and so save him paying us. Too late, however,
he found he could not stir without being shot, and finding himself in this fix he
put a good face on it, and sent our camphor off immediately. When McPhail
had squared accounts with him he offered us refreshments. I had taken up some
water, and was drinking it, when my boy knocked the cup from my hand, saying,
“No drink that, Sir; perhaps makee die.” I laughed at the idea, but did not
drink any more.
We shortly afterwards left, the old gentleman having got extremely polite,
and wishing us God speed. Hardly, however, had we cleared the walls when I
felt very ill, commenced retching, and was unable to move, The men crossed
muskets and carried me to the boat. I was delirious all the following night and
day. McPhail had given me a powerful emetic when we got on board, and this,
I think, saved my life. My legs swelled frightfully, and I had to use crutches for
many months afterwards. No doubt the head man had intended to poison us all,
but fortunately I was the only one that had partaken of his spread, and that only
in the little water I drank.
On the 18th of June we sailed for Hong Kong, Mr. McPhail going back to
Tamsui in an open boat. When about half-way across a pirate junk attacked
them, whereupon McPhail laid down in the boat, and with a rifle, double-barrel
gun, and a revolver, positively beat them off ; in fact, he fired away at them until
he had killed them nearly all, the junk drifting ashore and becoming a prize to the
fishermen. McPhail was a plucky little Scotchman, and a good friend, and was
rewarded by the mandarin of Obay for having destroyed one of the most trouble-
some pirates on the coast. When about five miles off the land, we saw the long


looked-for Customs’ steamer coming towards us. It was squally from the S. W.,
and while one squall obscured us from her view I altered our course and night set
in before it again cleared, so that the first peep was all we saw of each other. I
called off Amoy, sending a letter in by a fisherman, proceeded to Hong Kong, and
arrived safely on the 29th of June. Hence we sailed for Foo Chow, and loaded
tea for Sydney, bringing hardwood back to Foo Chow, for the use of the dock,
and arrived in May, 1864.
CHAPTEB IX.
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN BURNT AND CONCLUSION.
I made several trips across to Formosa with opium, returning with cargo in
exchange to the China coast. One voyage, however, the old brig commenced leak-
ing so badly that I determined to resign. The cargo of hardwood which I brought
from Australia, and two typhoons which overtook me on the Formosa coast, had
told severely on the old vessel. In one of these typhoons two vessels at the same
port were totally wrecked and most of their crews drowned, and I was compelled
to beach my own vessel until the storm was over. I therefore parted company
with the old girl, and accepted the invitation of her owners to stay a short time
with them at Foo Chow. Throughout January, February, and March, 1865, I did
so, going on frequent shooting and pleasure excursions. In April I joined the
Baron de Meriten’s corps of Imperialists, as extra aide de camp in an expedition
against the rebels at Chang-chaw-foo, which is a large walled city, to the west of
Amoy. The Vindex was now a Chinese man-of-war, having been purchased by the
Imperial Government, and was still under the command of Captain Caw. In her I
sailed to Amoy ; we had thirty French officers and 100 Chinese soldiers besides
artillery. Owing to various delays we did not arrive until June. Burgevine, the
American fillibuster, had already been captured and handed over to the General of
the Chinese army. We had scarcely anything to do ; the rebels made one or two
sallies and the villagers fired at the rebel chief, who was on horseback ;he im-
mediately had 500 of them taken prisoners, and then and there beheaded. The
Imperialists fired upon them but failed to hit them. The foreign corps grumbled
a good deal about the delay made in storming the place, as it was well-known the
inhabitants had consumed all their provisions and were eating human flesh. One
morning, seeing the city on fire, the order was given to move forward, but we were
too late, the enemy having escaped inland. General Koe followed them, keeping
at a respectful distance and leaving the foreign corps in charge of the burning
city. It continued burning for many days, and it was estimated that about
100,000 inhabitants were consumed. When we were able to enter the mass of
ruin, for it was no longer a city, the sight was sickening. Chinamen held their
tails over their nose, while we resorted to the use of our handkerchiefs. The
stench from the thousands of half-burnt bodies was frightful, and the miserable
Joss house in the centre of the ruins alone stood, on the walls of this we found
charcoal writing in English
He that this city takes,
Will get little for his pains,
For it is plain to any coon,
That little here remains.
Little there certainly was save of the stench of dead men and beasts. Numbers of
coolies were set to work to collect the dead ; skulls, limbs, hands and feet, of all
sizes were heaped up ready for burial; the small feet of the women with their


bandages and shoes still smouldering. Other coolies were at work digging trenches,
ready for the burial. From the walls of the look-out tower we could see inland
ten miles, excepting N. W., on which side there were some high hills.
The Imperialists could never have captured the city by themselves, starvation
alone having done the work for them. The wall of the city was twenty feet high
and ten feet thick, and ran round the city on the top of a natural ridge excepting
near the river, where there was a foundry for casting guns and shot, and it had
evidently been in use up to the time of evacuation.
We took some of their guns, which were well made and of good metal.
Many Chinamen were employed opening the better made graves in search of
plunder. A guard was set to put a stop to it, but only increased the mischief by
joining in the work themselves.
We saw troops of dogs like the Australian dingo snarling and fighting over the
human remains. They must have come across from the neighbouring villages, for
when we entered the city there was not an animal alive in it.
We left this city of horrors on the 10th of June. Glad we all were to get away,
fro what, with the rain, heat, and stench, it was a wonder any of us survived.
The Hai Ching, Chinese gunboat, took us all down to Amoy, where the Foreign
Corps was disbanded.
I went to Hong Kong with the Baron de Meriten and suite and saw him
embark for Paris. I then returned in the Yindex to Foo Chow, as my health was
bad and my legs still shakey from the effects of the poison. From Foo Chow I
sailed in a tea ship for my native country, and arrived in Sydney in December,
1865, in time to spend Christmas with my relations. Since then I have heard that
Mr. Milisch is Jardine, Matheson, and Co.’s agent at Tamsui, Mr. M'Phail a
merchant at Takow, Captain Caw still in the Yindex, Captains Roper, Rorie, and
Howard well to do in England—the latter married, and the former two preparing
themselves for a similar fate. Dr. Sommerville has gone to Scotland for the same
purpose, whereas I, Sin Tauka, have recovered my health, and, like Cooper’s Last
of the Mohicans, am preparing to follow the war trail until the Great Spirit calls
me to the happy hunting grounds.
