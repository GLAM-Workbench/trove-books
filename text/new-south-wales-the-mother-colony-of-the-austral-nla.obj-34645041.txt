INTRODUCTION.
The purpose of this book may be very briefly told: As there are
stages in the life of the individual when he naturally pauses, or is
made to pause, and takes stock, so to say, of his actual position, his
profit or loss account to date, his probable or possible prospects
for the future, so there maybe in the case of a community. Such a
time in the affairs of this community to the projectors of this
volume appeared to be the present. We are on the eve, rather, at
the starting point of a totally new departure in our political and
commercial, and therefore, it may be hoped, in our industrial and
social, career; and in order that due note may be possible here-
after of our progress or otherwise, it behoves us to know exactly
to-day, in all these respects, where we start from. Hence the
engagement of experts in all these departments, and in every
branch of them, to set down, in no great detail indeed, which
would swell the volume to a library, but with absolute accuracy,
precisely where and how we stand at the present moment in regard
to each ; and hence, we think may be added, within the covers of
this book one of the most marvellous records ever written of any
country in the world.
It is perhaps needless to say that the credit of the inception of
this work rests with the same bold, brain to which also is
due mainly the new departure it is meant to mark. It was the
present Premier, the Hon. G. H. Reid, who first suggested the
idea of some such publication, which, with his long experience in
such matters, was speedily put into form by the publisher, the
Government Printer, Mr. Potter, to whom also is due chiefly the
excellent choice of writers to deal with the several subjects. Any
editor might well be proud of such an array, and the present one
may fairly take this opportunity of saying that an easier task than
his, so far as any revision or correction of his contributors is con-
cerned, probably never fell to editor’s lot Doubtless this was due
mainly to his contributors’ own perfect competence, and something
perhaps may be put down to the inspiration, so to say, of the mar-
vellous tale which many or most of them had to tell. As he must
be a dullard indeed who can read some of the papers in this book


describing the wondrous achievements within little more than a
human lifetime, and the yet more wondrous possibilities of this
young land without feeling a glow of patriotic pride that he
belongs to such a country, so he must be doubly a dullard who
could wiite them without himself being moved with something of
the spirit of the brave deeds or bright visions he was recounting.
This in truth has been the editor’s chief difficulty—rather to restrain
the zeal of some of his contributors, if not exactly in painting the
lily or gilding the gold, at any rate in making what was meant to
be simply a plain matter-ot-fact record of Australian progress read
like nothing so much as an Arabian Nights tale. Not indeed
that even that would be in every case such an extravagance. There
have been marvels, not to say miracles, in Australia’s short story,
outrivalling Sindbad’s; magical transformations—witness Ballarat
or Broken Hill—to which Aladdin’s palace was the merest mush-
room. But the object of this book being to set forth, not the
romance, nor even the wonder of the country’s progress, but the
plain facts of its position to-day, and chiefly the practical side of
that, there has necessarily been some pruning in this direction, and
hence if any of these papers seem wanting in the warmth or colour
proper to the subject, let it be put down to the strictly business
scruples of the Editor, and not to any lack of enthusiasm on the
part of the writers.
Of course there are subjects dealt with here which needed no
such precautions. It have been difficult for instance for
Professor Pitt Cobbett to “enthuse” much on his subject, the
Law and Constitution of New South Wales, admirable as on the
whole both are, or for Mr. Harris Curry on his, the Laws relating
to Crown Lands, though he does properly describe them as
“ characterised by comprehensiveness and liberality.” Both these
papers will be found excellent digests of their respective subjects,
and for all interested in either subject—and wffio are not r —very
useful for reference. Commerce and speculation naturally go to-
gether, and doubtless in some quarters, in a sense, the most purely
speculative papers in the book may be said to be the commercial.
To some extent this was inevitable, since, as one of them admits,
the change in the fiscal policy is still too recent to allow of any full
or fair judgment, much less positive prediction, as to its results.
At the same time it can hardly be called mere speculation to say
that “with the loosing of her fiscal bonds the commercial supremacy
of New South Wales is assured,” seeing that that appears to have


been very fairly maintained, even without the loosing, and consider-
ing—which perhaps, after all, has had more to do with the matter
—this colony’s immense natural advantages. In any case no one
can question the ability and perfect knowledge of the subject with
which these papers —by Messrs. Nash and Rendall respectively—
are written, while he must be a very rabid opponent of the new
policy who will not join in the hope that their most sanguine
anticipations of its results may be fulfilled. Another paper of
marked ability is that by the first-named of these two writers, on our
railways —in their splendid success, under the management of Mr.
Eddy and his fellow commissioners, not the least remarkable of the
many instances in these pages of the country’s progress. Accord-
ing to this writer, not only are they “ the most efficiently main-
tained, the best managed, and the most profitable of all the state
railway systems of Australasia,” but in many important respects,
“will stand comparison with the admirably maintained railways
of the old country,” and he adds, “ cannot by men like myself,
who have studied the working of the railways of the United King-
dom and elsewhere, fail to be viewed with admiration.” It
would be difficult to overrate the value of such a paper as this, in
the proper appraisement to the world of one of the country’s prin-
cipal assets, and the confounding of those who are in the habit of
criticising the working of our railways without studying anything,
except, perhaps, the display of their own ignorance or spleen.
To the general public, however, the papers of most interest and
value will probably be those treating of the country’s several great
industries in esse or in posse, her productions, and grand natural
resources. It is not too much to say that here may be found, set
forth by the most competent authorities, a complete course of infor-
mation and instruction on every phase and feature of the country’s
practical development; and it may be noted that while the older
industries are dealt with as fully as the exigencies of space would
permit, not less attention is given to the very newest, or to those
later developments, in each and all, on the intelligent study and
prosecution of which depends so largely the future progress of the
colony. Thus, while the great pastoral industry in its more familiar
aspects is ably dealt with in the papers by Messrs. Bruce and Wright
on Live Stock and Wool respectively, it assumes quite a new or at
least even larger importance in the admirable paper on the Meat
Export Trade by that undoubted enthusiast on the subject, Mr.
Cuthbert Fetherstonhaugh, whose vision of Australia, and specially
h


New South Wales, becoming the chief or one of the chief food pro-
viders to the hungry millions of the old world, if realized, must
certainly, in his own words, “ soon restore the great pastoral
industry to its pristine preeminence.” As much may be said of
the papers by Messrs. McKinney and Boultbee respectively, on
Water Conservation and Artesian Boring, setting forth the incalcu-
lable benefits to be derived not only by the pastoral industry but
by the country generally from a thorough system of irrigation,
as the one writer has it, “ giving encouragement to dreams of
progress and development, even in the most arid districts, far beyond
the conception of the present nomadic, purely pastoral population/''
or as the other, “ equivalent to the addition of a new province.”
Then there are the group of papers relating to the several
branches of agriculture, following the excellent one by Principal
Thompson, of the Agricultural College, on the main subject. These
include every conceivable phase of this great industry, from grain-
growing to tobacco culture, wine-growing to butter-making, and
may be said to form a veritable farmer’s wherever in
this wide country of infinitely varied soil and climate, and therefore
of production, his lot may be cast. Principal Thompson’s paper may
be specially noted both for its eminently practical character and
the excellent account it gives of the work being done in the way of
agricultural education under the auspices of the Department of
Agriculture, established in 1890 by the present Minister for Mines,
etc., the Hon. Sydney Smith. Certainly it would seem to be all
needed, for though the Principal of the Agricultural College is
naturally sanguine as to the future of agriculture in this country, his
conditions are absolute. There must be, he declares, much im-
proved methods of culture, more intense cultivation, a better system
of rotation of crops and more careful husbanding of resources, all
directed to the raising of only the best class of products. In a word
agriculture must be made a science. And when we are told that the
course of education at the Agricultural College includes, besides all
practical farm work, such subjects as the principles of agriculture,
agricultural chemistry, botany, geology, physics, mechanics, &c.,
that the Department of Agriculture is for ever gathering and dis-
tributing fresh information for the farmers, and that at the several
experimental farms throughout the country tests are being made as
to the best crops and methods of culture for the special district,
there is evidently good hope that the requisite scientific knowledge
will be supplied.


The much neglected Fish and Timber industries find sympathetic
treatment at the capable hands of Messrs. Ogilby and Maiden,
which, it is hoped, may tend somewhat to their improvement.
Much useful information as to the Mining Industry is furnished by
the Chief Inspector of Mines, Mr. Slee ; and a series of thoughtful
papers by Mr. Frank Donohue and others deal fairly, if not very
fully, with the several features of our social and educational progress.
But why run further through the long list ? The book is here to
speak for itself, and may be described generally as a sort of literary
panorama (though necessarily, from the purely practical character
of most of the papers, with few literary pretensions) of the
present condition and prospects, from almost every point of view,
of the Colony. That it will altogether escape criticism, of course,
cannot be expected; that it will answer largely its main purpose
as an authentic record of the country's progress up to date, and
further, as spreading far and wide, both among her own people and
those of other countries —the book has been translated into French,
and will be well distributed —a fuller knowledge and appreciation
of the splendid resources and capabilities of this glorious land, may,
the Editor thinks, as certainly be hoped.

Physical Geography and Climate.
BY H C RUSSELL, B.A., C M.G., F.R.S., Government Astronomer.
Very early history points definitely to the knowledge of a great south
land, the “ Terra Australis incognita/’ and the stories which were told
of its gold and other treasures for ages inflamed the minds of the
adventurous navigators of those early days. Later the actual Australia
seemed to contradict these stories, but colonisation and exploration show
that there was a solid basis of fact as to the enormous natural treasures
of gold and precious stones, and many invaluable stores of other
minerals, which fully justify the dreams of early navigators. Whether
the natives ever did barter gold for European or Asiatic products cannot
be decided now, but the fact remains that the old myths about Australian
natural wealth are fully borne out by actual experience. These earlier
references to Australia treated the country as a whole. Our present
purpose is to deal only with New South Wales where the first colonists
landed. It is only a fraction (one-seventh) of the whole continent. Its
eastern boundary is the coastline between latitudes 28° 15' and 37° 30'
south, the northern boundary is the 29° parallel south latitude, except a
small distance near the coast where the river Maclntyre and the Moun-
tains come in and are used. The western boundary is the 141st meridian,
and the southern boundary is the river Murray. Its climate is without
doubt that of the best part of Australia, and very similar to that of
Southern Europe, with extremes that place the hottest point of New
South Wales on Sicily, and its coldest town, Kiandra, with an elevation
of 4,600 feet, upon Edinburgh.
General Features.
New South Wales is divided by its natural features into three distinct
areas in which there are essential differences of climate.
First we have a strip of country 800 miles long bounded on the one
side by the ocean, and on the other by the mountain chain, known as
the coast districts. This area varies from 30 to 150 miles in width, and
in it there are no less than fifteen considerable rivers—a good index of
the general abundance of rain on the coast, which ranges from 36 to 76
inches. About these rivers there is found an abundance of first-class
agricultural soil, a genial climate, with rain and sunshine alternating, and
hence a natural forest of luxuriant growth, only a part of which has been
brought under the plough. The details of the climate on the coast as to
the distribution of temperature and rainfall will be found in the accom-
panying charts, and it is only necessary to add that in the summer the
prevailing winds which are from east to south are cool and pleasant.
The numerous rivers, of which we will say more presently, make
this coastal area a well-watered country, and greatly facilitate the
transport of agricultural products to the Sydney and other markets.
A


Tlie second division likewise extends tlie wliole lengtli of tlie Colony
and comprises tlie wliole of tlie liigdi lands ranging in altitude from
1,000 to 7,000 feet; tlie greater part, however, is from 2,000 to 3,000
feet. Here, also, tlie rainfall is abundant, from 26 to 50 inches per
annum, and, as a consequence of this rainfall rivers and smaller streams
are very numerous, making this section of tlie Colony a well-watered
area. ( See maps.) There are vast areas here of first-class soil for the
growth of cereals and fruit, and all of this section is good for pastoral
purposes.
The third division includes the great plains of the west intersected
by the Darling, Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, and Murray, with many
smaller rivers. The rainfall varies from 10 inches in the extreme west
to 25 inches in the eastern part. [S maps.) The soil is chiefly good
for pastoral purposes, the rainfall being too small for agriculture,
except in the south-eastern part, where the comparatively abundant
rains of winter, spring, and summer, coupled with most suitable soil,
make wheat-growing a profitable investment, and the finest wheat
oi Australia is grown here. In the early days of the Colony much of
this flat country was without surface water in dry years; but a larg’e
capital has been devoted to making tanks that are invaluable and the
wells of artesian water afford an abundant and perennial supply. Of
these an enormous number have been made, which yield, literally,
rivers of water, and the number is being added to every year. Prac-
tically these wells and bores have solved the difficulty as to surface
water in dry seasons. The distribution of rain is best seen in the small
map of rainfall; and the temperature map gives the seasonal tempera-
tures, the mean, and the highest and lowest temperatures.
Inland Rivers.
The inland rivers of New South Wales are the longest and most
important in Australia. The Murray, which is the most permanent,
has never been known to be dry. Fed, as it is, by the snows of the
Snowy Range, capped by Kosciusko, the highest point in Australia,
it is always in flood in summer, for the summer melts the snow. It is
navigable for 1,708 miles, 1,216 in New South Wales, and 487 in
South Australia. The Murrumbidgee, its chief tributary, is 1,850
miles long’, and the Lachlan, its other tributary, is 700 miles long.
The Darling is really a tributary of the Murray, and discharges into
it at Wentworth; but it is by far the longer river of the two, and is
navigable from Wentworth to Walgett, 1,758 miles. It must, however,
be understood that its existence depends upon rain. Its tributaries are
important streams measured from the Darling to their sources :

From the head of the Culgoa to the sea, vice the Darling and Murray,

Coast Rivers.
It lias already been shown that the coast district has abundant rain,
the annual fall ranging from 86 to 76 inches. Most of this rain is
brought in by easterly winds, laden with moisture, which, when they
reach the mountains, rise up oyer them; and in doing so they drop
abundance of rain in accordance with a well-known law of nature that,
if a cloud rises it drops some of its moisture, and this abundant downfall
feeds the numerous rivers. Pfie find, then, no less than fifteen rivers ox
various sizes, but all helping for navigation and the general water supply
necessary for husbandry. Beginning, we pass these rivers in review :
1. The Tweed River flows into the sea at the northern boundary of
the Colony, its abundant stream is fed by the rain on the highest of
the coast mountains ; it flows to the north-east 30 miles, but its naviga-
tion is by its bar harbour made only possible to small craft.
2. The Richmond River, immediately south, rises in part in the same
high range as the Tweed, and flows through some rugged pastoral
country and large areas of very rich soil, parts of which are covered
with valuable timbers, and it reaches the sea in 120 miles, and drams
an area of 2,400 square miles. It is navigable in one branch to Casino
40 miles, and the other branch to Lismore 65 miles. Products, sugar
and tropical fruits.
3. The Clarence River. Rising in the mountains it reaches the sea
after a course of 240 miles, in latitude 29° 26'. It is one of the finest
rivers of the east coast, and drains an area of 8,000 square miles, which
is rich in minerals and tropical vegetation. Climate perfect in winter,
but warm as Southern Europe in summer; it is, however, tempered by
the trade wind, and abundant rains. The river is navigable for 136
miles, and is in places half a mile wide.
4. The Made ay River rises in the northern tablelands, flows through
magnificent gorges, with many waterfalls, one of which is 240 feet; in
places the mountains rise almost perpendicularly from the river to 3,000
feet. The river is 200 miles long, passing through a country very rich
in timber, it drains 4,800 square miles, and is navigable for 30 miles.
5. The Hastings is a fine stream flowing into the sea at Port
Macquarie. It drains 1,400 square miles of country, with abundance of
fine timber and rich alluvial soil.
6. The Manning River rises in the mountains near Nundle, flows
easterly through a fine timber country and rich soil, draining an area
of 3,000 square miles; navigable 20 miles.
7. Karuah River rises in the Mount Royal Range, flows for 45 miles
through rich agricultural soil to the sea at Port Stephens. It drains
an area of 600 square miles.
8. The Hunter River rises in the Liverpool Ranges, and makes a
south and east course for 200 miles to the sea at Newcastle; it drains
7,900 square miles, and is navigable for large steamers 35 miles. The
Williams, one of its tributaries, is navigable for 20 miles to Clarence
Town; and the Paterson, another tributary, is navigable 18 miles. The
whole of the Hunter River district is very rich in pastoral and agricul-
tural products; it is famous for its vineyards, its corn, and its tobacco;
and minerals are not wanting, the finest deposit of coal in the Colony
is found here.


9. The Ilawkesbnry is another very fine river, which rises in the
Cullarin Range and flows northerly for 190 miles ; then its course turns
to the east, and near this point it is joined by large tributaries, the
Colo and the Macdonald. Sections of the river are, unfortunately,
known by different names, the upper portion being the Warragamba,
the central portion the Nepean, and the rest the Hawkesbury. The
river is navigable 140 miles, to Windsor, and in its lower reaches the
scenery is magnificent, far exceeding Sydney Harbour in grandeur and
extent, but of the same general character. The alluvial lands of this
river were the first wheat fields of the young colony, but wheat has
long since given place to lucerne, a far more profitable crop. The
whole length of the river is 330 miles, and it drains an area of 8,600
square miles, and has eighteen tributary streams.
10. The Shoalhaven River is the largest of those south of Sydney. It
takes its origin in a swamp called Carombars, at an elevation of 2,800
feet. This river is 260 miles in length, and drains an area of 3,300
square miles. In its upper reaches it passes through very rough coun-
try, in which minerals abound, especially gold. In its lower reaches
it flows through rich agricultural land. Owing to obstacles in the
river, it is only navigable for 12 miles.
11. The Clyde River is an important stream, taking its rise in the
Pigeonhouse Mountain, and flowing 70 miles in a southerly course to
Bateman’s Bay ; it drains 450 square miles of country, which is rich in
dairy and agricultural land.
12. The Morava River rises near Aralnen, and flows 80 miles to S.E.,
into a wide estuary. This river drains 350 square miles, and is the
only outlet by water of the rich auriferous districts of Aralnen and
Braidwood. In its lower reaches are found magnificent alluvial flats.
In its upper course it passes through rugged country containing abun-
dance of gold-bearing quartz and very rich silver ore. The river
abounds in fish and oysters.
13. The Turas River rises in a lofty mountain known as Barren-
Jumbo, and takes a N.E. course through rich pastoral and mineral
lands. It drains 600 square miles of country.
14. The Bega River is a fine stream, rising in the coast ranges and
flowing east 60 miles to the sea through a rich pastoral and agricul-
tural land. Great quantities of butter, cheese, &c., are produced in the
district, while amongst its mineral stores are abundance of coal and
kerosene shale.
15. Towamba River rises in the eastern slopes of the coast range ;
thence it flows 40 miles through a rich pastoral and agricultural dis-
trict into Twofold Bay, 280 miles south of Sydney. This is the port
from which cattle for the Tasmanian market are shipped.
Neglecting the smaller streams and the portions of these rivers which
could easily be made navigable by the removal of a few trees, we have
in actual use 545 miles of navigable water in onr coastal rivers.

New South "Wales has a coast-line of 800 miles on which, compara-
tively, very little stormy weather is experienced.
Before the coast was well lighted easterly gales were dangerous,
but now the lighthouses guide the mariner into the places of shelter

The Constitution and Laws.*
BY PITT COBBETT, Challis Professor of Law, in the University of Sydney.
Earlier Forms of Government.
The first settlement of New South Wales dates back to the year
1788 The history of the government of the Colony since that time
may be roughly distributed into four periods ;-(l)
and despotic government, extending mom 17°8 to adapted
only to the circumstances of a penal settlement; (2) A period of civil
but non-representative institutions, extending from 18 -.3 to 1842, during
which the Colony was ruled by a Governor and a Legislative Oounci
appointed by the Crown;* (3) A period of partially representative
institutions, extending from 1842 to 1855, during which the Legislative
Council consisted in part of elective members, although the executive
government was still conducted by officials who were appointed by
and responsible to the Home Government ; c and (4) A period of
responsible government, extending from 1805 to the present time,
durino- which the Legislature has consisted of two Houses, one nomi-
nated 13 and the other elective, whilst the executive government has
been virtually conducted by Ministers responsible to the elective
chamber. 11 Each of these periods has left its mark on existing
institutions.®
The Present Constitution— (i) The Imperial Element.
The Colony, although it possesses a domestic constitution of its own, is
strictly a dependency of the British Empire. This involves the exist-
ence of two sets of legislative, executive, and judicial authorities e
one imperial and the other local —the line between whose jiirisaictions
is not always clear and is often drawn in one way by law and in
another by convention. Of the Imperial element it will oe sufficient
to say that it is represented by two fundamental principles or .motors
* Within the limits of space allotted to this subject it was found impossible to do
than give the briefest possible survey of the more important institutions of govnrn
ment g The writer has, however, where possible, appended references, fiom which
complete information may be gathered.
a The dates <d V en are those at which the Acts inaugurating the changes referred to
were passedTthe V changes themselves did not actually take effect in the Colony till some-

#


the supremacy of tlie Imperial Parliament, and the Royal prerogative.
The former, although, still an active principle, is greatly limited in
practice by considerations of policy, under which imperial legislation
is virtually confined to matters of general or imperial concern and to
cases where such intervention is requested by the Colony itself. a The
prerogative powers of the Crown in relation to the Colony have not
only been considerably modified by statute, b but are still more largely
qualified by the convention which precludes the Crown, under ordinary
circumstances, from interfering in matters of local or domestic concern.
These powers, moreover, are no longer wielded by the Crown itself,
but by a minister responsible to the Imperial Parliament —the Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies. 0 From without , the Royal preroga-
tive manifests itself mainly in two ways —(1) the control which is
still exercised by the Secretary of State over colonial legislation
and over the colonial Governor ; and (2) the maintenance of the
appellate jurisdiction of the Crown as exercised through the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. Within the Colony, the pre-
rogative powers of the Crown, so far as they are delegated to the
Governor, still constitute the basis and measure of local executive
authority, except indeed in so far as they have been modified by local
or imperial statute/
(n) The Local Element.
So far as relates to local affairs, therefore, the Colony enjoys the
fullest measure of self-government. Its domestic constitution rests
partly on statute, 6 partly on the common law/ and partly on conven-
tion.® Its groundwork is furnished by the Imperial statute 18 and 19
Vic., c. 54, to which the local Constitution Act is appended by way of
schedule. 11 The latter has, however, been considerably modified by
later acts, such as the Constitution Act Amendment Acts of 1857, 1884,
and 1890, the Triennial Parliaments Act of 1874, the Parliamentary
Representatives Allowance Act of 1889, and the Electoral Act of 18937
The chief factors that require to be noticed in connection with the
local constitution are the Governor, the Legislature, the system of
Administration, and the Judicial system.
a As illustrations of the former class of cases we may take Foreign Enlistment and
Extradition Acts; as illustrations of the latter, the passing of the Federal Council of
Australasia Act, 1885, and the proposed reference of the Federal Constitution to the
Imperial Parliament.
b 18 and 19 Vic., c. 54, sec. 2 ; Constitution Act, secs. 47 and 48.
c Anson, Law and Custom of the Constitution, ii. 249.
d For a judicial recognition of this principle see ex parte Leong Kum (7 N.S.W. R. at
p. 262), which on this point is not affected by the later decision in Chun Teeong Toy v.
Musgrove (1891, App. Ca. 272).
e The statutes affecting the Constitution are partly imperial, such as 9 Geo. IV, c.
82, 18 and 19 Vic., c. 54, and the Colonial Laws Act, 1865 ; and partly local, such as the
various Constitution Act Amendment Acts 1857, 1884, 1890. With them we may class
orders and regulations made under this authority.
f The Letters Patent and Instructions take effect under the Royal prerogative as it
exists at common law.
s The Ministerial system rests on convention, the only reference to it in the Consti-
tution Act being found in sec. 37.
h The Constitution Act is not strictly a local statute, having been altered by the
Colonial Office before being assented to by the Crown.
1 Strictly the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act, 1893.


The Office of Governor.
The office of Governor is constituted by Letters Patent from tire
Crown under the Great Seal. Tbe present Letters Patent bear date
tbe 29th. April, 1879. The powers and duties annexed to th© office
are conferred partly by this instrument/ and partly by Imperial or
local statute/ The permanent Instructions, also, provide a standing
body of rules for the guidance of the Governor in the exercise of tire
duties conferred on him. The present Instructions bear date the 9th
July, 1892. They may, however, at any time be supplemented by
particular or further instructions issued by the Secretary of State.
The duties of the office, as thus constituted, may be discharged either
either by the Governor himself, by the Lieutenant-Governor, or by an
Administrator of the Government; a separate commission being pro-
vided for each of these officers. The Governor himself is appointed by
the Crown, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, and holds
office at the pleasure of the Crown, although the usual term of office is six
years. 0 His salary is at present fixed at £7,000 a year, this sum being
charged on the Consolidated Fund. The commission of the Lieutenant-
Governor is usually issued to the Chief Justice of the Colony, but is only
operative 11 in the event of the Governor dying or becoming incapable or
departing from the Colony. It is also usual to issue a third commis-
sion to the President of the Legislative Council or some other high
official, authorising him to administer the government in the event
of both Governor and Lieutenant-Governor being unable to act. But
both these commissions may at any time be superseded by a special
commission issued to any other person. The Governor is the connect-
ing link between the Imperial and local authorities. His functions
may be roughly grouped under three heads : —(1) Those attaching to
him as the local representative of the Imperial Government. Here
he acts not as a local constitutional ruler but as an Imperial officer
subject to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 6 In this capacity
he is the medium of communication between the Imperial and local
authorities; and exercises also certain powers of reservation in regard to
colonial Bills. (2) Those attaching to him as the titular head of the
Colonial Government. In this capacity he is charged with a multitude
of functions relating alike to legislation, administration, and judica-
ture. These functions he is required to exercise, for the most part, on
the advice of his Ministers, who are in their turn responsible to the
Legislature. Even here, however, he is invested with some discre-
tionary power, the nature of which will be referred to hereafter.
(3) Those attaching to him as the representative of the Crown, in its
august capacity. These functions are for the most part of a formal or
ceremonial kind, and their exercise depends on his own judgment and
discretion. It is at this point that the Imperial and local aspects of
his office blend, and it is hard to say which predominates.
a See Letters Patent, cl. 2,5, 8 to 11.
b Constitution Act, secs. 2,7, 9, 37, 54, 55. There are also a vast number of local
statutes which confer administrative powers on the Governor, to be exercised on the
advice of the Executive Council.
c Colonial Office Regulations, 1894, No. 7.
d Except for the purposes of precedence.
e On this subject generally, see Todd, Government of the British Colonies, ch. xviii.


The Legislature,
The Legislature of the Colony is made up of the Sovereign, who is
for this purpose locally represented by the Governor, and two Houses
of Parliament —a nominee Council and an elective Assembly. a This
body is invested by statute with a general legislative capacity, in-
cluding the power of making changes in its own constitution and
judicial system, 13 subject only in certain cases to the necessity of
reservation. 0 Its powers are, however, limited —by the principle of the
supremacy of the Imperial Parliament, in virtue of which any colonial
enactment that conflicts with the provisions of an Imperial statute
extending to the Colony is deemed to be inoperative and void ; d by the
principle of territoriality, in virtue of which a colonial enactment is pre-
cluded from having any extra-territorial effect, except where authorised
by imperial statute f and also by certain provisions restricting the
imposition of certain kinds of fiscal duties/
The Legislative Council.
The Legislative Council consists of not less than twenty-one mem-
bers, who are appointed by the Grover nor on the advice of the Executive
Council/ The present number is sixty-eight, 11 of whom one-fourth con-
stitute a quorum/ There are certain personal qualifications, but no
property qualification. Pour-fifths of the members at least must consist
of persons not holding any office of profit under the Crown. j Subject
to certain provisions as to the vacating 1 of seats and resignation, mem-
bers hold office for life/ The chief officer of the House is the Presi-
dent, who is appointed by the Governor and Executive Council from
amongst the members. Although appointments to the Upper Chamber
can only be made by the Governor on the advice of the Executive
Council, yet it would seem that the Governor possesses a discretionary
power of refusing to act on such recommendation in certain events; as
in the case where there was good ground for believing that such
recommendation would not be endorsed by the Legislature or the
constituencies/
The Legislative Assembly.
The Legislative Assembly consists of 125 elective members, of wdiom
twenty, exclusive of the Speaker, constitute a quorum. 111 Members
are subject to certain qualifications imposed by the Electoral Act 1898, n
and the Constitution Act. 0 Of these perhaps the most important is
that which excludes any person holding an office of profit under the
Crown, with the exception or the chiefs of the nine great administrative

one of tlie latter offices lias tlie effect of vacating tlie seat of tlie memoer

ceive an allowance at the rate of £3OO a year/ The chief officer
of the House is the Speaker, who is elected by the House itself, on the
occasion of the assembling of a new Parliament after a general election,
or on an intermediate vacancy occurring.
The Electoral System.
The system of Parliamentary representation is now governed by the
Electoral Act of 1893/ This Act establishes in the Colony a uniform
system of manhood suffrage, single-member constituencies, equal elec-
toral districts, and self-registration of voters. It also attempts to pro-
vide additional safeguards against illegal voting and corrupt practices.
Electoral Districts.
Under this Act three Commissioners were appointed, whose duty it
was to distribute the Colony into 125 electorates, each returning one
member, and each containing, so far as was consistent with practical con-
venience, the same number of electors. For this purpose the Commis-
sioners were directed to ascertain from the rolls then in force the total
number of existing electors qualified by residence, and to divide this total
by 125/ The result was to give the quota, or proportionate number of
electors for each district. This was found, in fact, to amount to 2,513
electors. The Commissioners were, however, allowed a margin of 600
above or below this quota/ to enable them to give some consideration
to existing boundaries, natural features, lines of communication, and
community or divergence of interest. 6 On these principles the Colony
was ultimately distributed into eleven city districts, thirty-nine subur-
ban districts, and eighty-five country districts. The new system came
into operation on the 29th of December, 1893. To guard against future
inequality arising from changes in population, the Act requires this
distribution to be readjusted on the same principles, and by means of
the same machinery, after each decennial census; whilst it also authorizes
a readiustment in the fourth or fifth year after any census, in regard
to any part of the Colony where the electoral roll of any district shows
an increase or decrease in the prescribed quota of not less than 25 per
cent/
The Parliamentary Franchise.
The Parliamentary franchise is also regulated by the Electoral Act
of -1893. Under this Act every person claiming to vote for any
district must be the holder of an elector’s right for the district; must

be entered on tbe electoral roll for tlie district; and must also, at the
time of tendering his vote, retain the qualifications in virtue of which
his right was issued to him. a An elector’s right is a certificate
issued in the form prescribed by the Act by the registrar of an
electoral district to a duly qualified person, entitling him to vote for
that district. 13 These rights are required to be renewed at intervals
of three years, from the 31st December, 1896. c In the first instance
they were distributed by the police ; but for the future they can
only be obtained by personal application, although a right once
obtained may be renewed by written application, accompanied by a
statutory declaration in the prescribed form/ A substituted certi-
ficate may also be issued on change of residence from one district to
another, or on the loss or defacement of the original right.® The
electoral roll is the official register of persons primd facie entitled to vote
at parliamentary elections for the district. For registration purposes
each district is, where necessary, subdivided into divisions/ The
Act also provides for the periodical publication and revision of a
general and a supplementary list of voters for each division; these
divisional rolls when printed together constitute the electoral roll for
the district. s The more important qualifications necessary to entitle
a person to receive an elector’s right and to be entered on the elec-
toral roll are as follows : —The applicant must be a British subject,
of the male sex, of the age of twenty-one years, and absolutely free;
he must have had his principal place of abode in New South Wales
for a continuous period of one year, 11 and in the electoral district
for a continuous period of three months prior to the date of his
application. 1 There are also certain disqualifications set up by the
Act, such as service in the regular naval or military forces or con-
stabulary, unsoundness of mind, and conviction for certain offences.- 1
The Method of Holding Elections .
On the occasion of a general election the polling throughout the
Colony takes place on the same day/ Every candidate must be
nominated by at least six registered electors for the district, the nomina-
tion paper being in the form prescribed by the Act. 1 No money
deposit is now required from candidates. The method of voting is by
ballot. For this purpose every elector after exhibiting his right, and
having had his name checked on the roll, receives a voting-paper
containing the names of the candidates, and punctured and initialed
by the presiding officer. The elector then retires to a compartment,
and strikes out the names of all candidates, except that candidate for
whom he wishes to vote. The ballot-paper is then folded up and
delivered to the presiding officer, and deposited by him in the ballot-

Contested Elections,
The Legislative Assembly still retains the right of determining ques-
tions arising out of disputed elections. Under the Electoral Act of 1893,
however, this function is required to be exercised by a committee of the
House, called the Committee of Elections and Qualifications. 0 This
consists of nine members appointed by warrant under the hand of the
Speaker, with the approval of the House, at the commencement of each
session. d The Committee is empowered to decide, finally, all ques-
tions respecting the validity of elections, or the qualification of any
person returned; and to investigate and report to the Assembly upon
any other matter referred to it.®
The Duration of Parliament.
The power of convening the Legislature is vested in the Governor
subject to the condition that one session at least must be held in
each year. g This power is really exercised on the advice of the
Ministry, who, both for the purposes of legislation and supply, find it
necessary not only to convene Parliament frequently, but also to
maintain it in session for a considerable part of each year. Once in
being, Parliament may be prorogued, or dissolved, or may expire by lapse
of time. Prorogation has the effect of putting an end to the session;
it applies equally to both Houses ; and is effected by proclamation of
the Governor. 11 The effect of prorogation w r as formerly to put an
end to all business not then completed; but both Houses have now
made provision for enabling bills commenced in the previous session
to be resumed in a subsequent session at the point at which they were
dropped. 1 Dissolution has the effect of terminating the existence
of the Assembly and of suspending the functions of the Council ; J it
also is effected by proclamation of the Governor. The duration of
Parliament is limited to three years by the Triennial Parliaments Act,
1874. If not previously dissolved, the Assembly will, ipso jure, cease to
exist after the lapse of three years from the date of the return of the
writs on the occasion of the last general election. 1 " Whether it ceases
by dissolution or by lapse of time, a new Parliament must be convened
within forty-six days. 1 The powers of prorogation and dissolution are
commonly exercised by the Governor on the advice of his Ministers ;
but with respect to dissolution he is invested with a somewhat wider
discretion than usual, it being his duty to see that this prerogative
power is only resorted to in cases in which a recourse to it is dictated
by the public interest." 1

The Conduct Public B usiness in Parliament.
Tlie conduct of public business in Parliament is regulated in part by
statute/ in part by rules and orders framed by botli Houses in pursuance
of statutory powers/ and in part by usage. The English lex et con-
suetude Parliamenti has no application except in so far as it may have
been expressly adopted under statutory authority. 0 The present Stand-
ing Orders of the Legislative Assembly were adopted and approved in
1b94; and those of the Legislative Council in 1895. The general
methods of procedure, both in respect to the conduct of debates, the
■passing of public and private bills, and the transaction of miscel-
laneous business, are for the most part modelled on those of the
Imperial Parliament/ In recent times special provision has been made
for the purpose of protecting Parliament against obstruction; this
includes ( inter aha) certain limitations which have been placed on
formal motions for adjournment; and the adoption, subject to certain
restrictions, of the principle of the closure. 0 The conduct of financial
business is subject to the following rules: —(1) All money bills must
originate in the Legislative Assembly; 1 (2) The Assembly will not pass
any vote or bill for the appropriation of revenue or taxation, except
on the recommendation of the Governor/ whilst, (3) All financial
measures brought before the Assembly must be founded on previous
resolutions come to in Committee of the whole House/ Ho public work,
the estimated cost of which exceeds £20,000, can be commenced, unless
previously reported on by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
Public Works, and approved by resolution of the Assembly. 1
The Relation of the tiro Houses.
■ •
Technically, each House possesses co-ordinate powers ; the concur-
rence of each is necessary to legislation; whilst, in general, any
measure may originate in either House. To the latter rule, however,
there are two exceptions, viz., that all money bills must originate in
the Legislative Assembly; and that bills affecting the constitution of
either House, ought to originate in that House. J With respect to
money bills, there is a general recognition of the principle that, under
a representative system of government, the control over revenue and
expenditure ought primarily to rest with the elective chamber, never-
theless, the Legislative Council both claims, and has occasionally exer-
cised, the right of rejecting measures of taxation/ It also claims the
right of amending money bills, except, perhaps, where the amendment

would have the effect of imposing any additional charge on the people ; a
but this claim lias commonly been resisted by tlie Assembly. 1 " With
respect to general legislation, although the powers of the two Houses are
formally equal, yet the Assembly exercises in the long run a predomi-
nating influence, owing, no doubt, to its representative character, its
control of the public purse, and, perhaps, in the last resort, to the pos-
sibility of u swamping/’ Although this extreme step has never, so far
at least as relates to the Colony, been authoritatively sanctioned, 0 and
although it may, perhaps, be unconstitutional, yet the fact that there
is no maximum limit to the number of the Council, and that the right
of making additions to it is vested in the Executive, undoubtedly tends
to diminish the chances of any permanent deadlock/
The Royal Assent.
The assent of the Crown is essential to the validity of colonial
legislation. This assent, however, is usually given as a matter of
course, through the Governor. 8 Strictly, a colonial Act, even after
it has been assented to by the Governor, may be disallowed by the
Crown, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, within two
years ; f but in practice this right is not taken advantage off There
are, however, certain bills which the Governor is required either by
statute 5 or by his Instructions to reserve. By his Instructions the
Governor must reserve all bills relating to divorce, or involving* any
grant of land or money to himself, or affecting the currency of the
colony, or imposing differential duties, 11 or inconsistent with imperial
treaties., or interfering with the discipline of the Boyal forces in the
colony, or to the prejudice of the prerogative or the rights and property
of British subjects outside the Colony or the trade and shipping of
the United Kingdom, or containing provisions to which the Boyal
assent has already been refused. 1 But even these bills the Gover-
nor is empowered to assent to, in case of emergency, except where
the bill is repugnant to the law of England or inconsistent with
Imperial treaty. This obligation of reservation is perhaps a necessary
measure of precaution ; but in practice the colony enjoys the fullest
freedom of legislation in regard to its own domestic affairs. Between
1855 and 1890, only 15 bills were reserved, and none of these were
finally disallowed.- 5
The Executive Council and Ministry.
The Governor is the titular head of the executive department of
government, but like the sovereign in England he is required to
exercise these powers, at the instance and on the responsibility of
certain constitutional advisers. Many of his powers he is expressly

required to exercise with the formal assent and advice of the Executive
this obligation being imposed partly by statute a and partly
by the Instructions ; b other powers he exercises on the advice and
responsibility of a single Minister. 0 The constitution of the Execu-
tive Council; and the duties of its members; are regulated by the
Letters Patent/ by the Instructions/ and by statute! It is usually
presided over by the Governor; and consists of the Vice-President;
and nine other members; who are at the same time the heads of
the great executive departments. Saving the presence of the Gover-
nor; the Executive Council is in fact identical with the Ministry
or Cabinet. It was no doubt originally intended that the Executive
Council should constitute the real executive organ; but the presence of
the Governor appears to have led to the adoption by its members of
the practice of deliberating in private; and this; in its turn, gave rise
to the Ministry or Cabinet as a distinct thougdi informal institution.
Hence the Council has come to assume the character of a formal body;
through the medium of which the more important acts of State are
sanctioned or allowed ; but whose action is prompted or set in motion
by a responsible Minister; after consultation with the whole Ministry
in matters of moment; or on his own responsibility in minor or
departmental matters. Members of the Executive Council resign their
offices on ceasing to be Ministers. The Ministry or Cabinet is virtually
a committee of the leading members of both Houses; who possess the
confidence of the majority in the Legislative Assembly; and generally
represent the dominant party in that House. It is made up of the chiefs
of the executive departments; who are at liberty to sit in the Legis-
lative Assembly/ and whose tenure of office depends on political
considerations; 11 together with the Vice-President of the Council.
The Ministry or Cabinet is thus an informal deliberative body; it has
no corporate existence or official recognition; and no formal record is
kept of its proceedings. In the Colony there is no distinction; such as
exists in England; between Cabinet and Ministry. 1 For the rest; how-
ever; the relations between the Ministry and the Legislature; are much
the same as those which exist in the United Kingdom/ Although
the Governor is as a rule bound to act on his Ministers’ advice; yet he
is expressly authorised by his Instructions to refuse such advice in case
of need/ In practice; however; such cases are not very frequent.
It is difficult to reduce them to any satisfactory principle; but roughly
they may be said to include : —(1) Cases where the Governor acts as
a Constitution Act, secs. 3, 37 ; besides which there are an immense number of local
statutes, which confer new administrative powers, but expressly require these to be
exercised on the advice of the Executive Council.
L Instructions 1892, cl. 6. This clause, however, expressly authorises the Governor
to act in opposition of such advice, if he deems it necessary, subject to certain conditions.

The Cabinet, under the English system, is strictly a committee of the larger body or
Ministry. The tendency in the Colony is to use the term to indicate a sitting of the
Ministry.

In tlie event of bis refusing to act on tbe advice of bis Ministers in
matters of domestic concern, it will be incumbent on him, if bis Minis-
ters should resign, to procure other Ministers who will accept tbe

The Administrative Departments and the Public Service.
For tbe purposes of administration, tbe public business of tbe Colony
is distributed between nine different departments, each of which is pre-
sided over by a responsible Minister, as bead, and worked by a staff of
permanent officials. These Ministers are : —(1) Tbe Colonial Secre-
tary ; e (2) Tbe Colonial Treasurer; (3) Tbe Attorney-General; (4)
The Secretary for Lands; (5) Tbe Secretary for Public Works; (6) Tbe
Minister of Justice ; (7) Tbe Minister of Public Instruction ; (8) Tbe
Secretary for Mines and Agriculture; and (9) Tbe Postmaster-General.
Tbe functions of tbe departments respectively presided over by these
Ministers are fixed partly by statute and partly by Executive minute.
Tbe Ministers or political beads of these departments are technically
appointed by tbe Governor alone/’ but are really selected on tbe recom-
mendation of tbe political leader who may be invited by tbe Governor
to form an administration, and who appears to possess tbe confidence
of tbe Assembly; they also retire or are dismissible from office on
political grounds. Tbe appointment and tenure of other public officers
are now regulated, in tbe main, by tbe Public Service Act, 1895. g This
Act was passed for tbe purpose of effecting a complete reorganiza-
tion of tbe Public Service, and of withdrawing both appointments and
promotions, as far as possible, from tbe sphere of political influence.
To this end tbe Act constitutes a Public Service Board, consisting of
three Commissioners, who are appointed for a period of seven years,
and are irremovable during that period except by resolution of both
Houses, although they are liable to vacate their offices in certain
events specified by tbe Act.' 1 This Board is charged with tbe duty
of investigating both tbe organization and working of each depart-
ment of tbe Public Service, and of determining (subject to tbe
restrictions imposed by tbe Act) tbe number, grade, and salaries of
tbe officers employed. 1 Tbe Board is endowed with tbe power of
making administrative regulations; and is also required to furnish
an annual report on tbe state of tbe Public Service for presentation to
Parliaments Tbe officers of tbe Public Service are distributed into
five divisions —tbe special, professional, clerical, educational, and
a E.g., refusal to sanction the issue of public moneys in violation of statutory require-
ments : see Constitution Act, sec. 55 ; Todd, 628 et 726.

interests, by the Ministry in office ; Todd, 662, 73 Qet seq.

general. a As a rule all future appointments to tlie permanent service
are to be made by the Governor and Executive Council either at the
instance of the Board itself, or at the request of the political or per-
manent head of a department addressed to the Board, but in any case
only on the certificate of the Board ; b the appointees being under
ordinary circumstances selected by competitive examination, and being
further subject to a probation of six months. The control of future
promotion is also vested in the Board, subject, however, to certain
conditions prescribed by the Act, which include [inter alia) the passing*
of a qualifying examination on transfer from the lower to the higher
g*rades recognised in the certain divisions/ Public officers still con-
tinue to hold office at the pleasure of the Crown/ although they
enjoy the protection of certain provisions of the Act designed to guard
against arbitrary or unfair dismissal. 1 Officers appointed after the
passing* of the Act are not entitled to any pension or allowance f
bid/ are subject to an obligation of compulsory insurance, or to an
equivalent deduction of salary. 11 Public officers are prohibited, except
by express permission of the Governor, from engaging in commercial
or professional business outside the duties of their office. 1 The con-
trol and working of the Government railways and tramways are
vested in the Railway Commissioners, under the provisions of the
Railways Act of 1888. j The Agent-General is the representative of
the Colony in the United Kingdom; it is his duty to look after its
general and commercial interests in the United Kingdom and Continent
of Europe, and to carry out such instructions as may be given to him
from time to time by the Executive.
The Fiscal System — Revenue — Appropriation.
The fundamental principles which underlie the fiscal system of the
Colony are ; —(1) That no tax or impost shall be levied on the inhabi-
tants except with the consent of the Colonial Legislature ; k (2)
That all public revenue raised within the Colony, whether by taxa-
tion or otherwise, belongs to the Colonial Legislature / and (3) That
no public money shall be expended except under the authority of an
Act of the Legislature/ 1 The main sources of the Colonial revenue
are : —(1) The proceeds of taxation, including customs duties, excise
duties, stamp duties, and licenses, to which must now be added a tax
on the unimproved value of land, and an income tax ; n (2) Revenue
derived from Crown lands, including the proceeds of sales, interest on
unpaid balances, and rents ; (8) Moneys received for services rendered,
including the revenue derived from the Government railways, tram-
ways, and postal and telegraph systems; and (4) Miscellaneous
receipts, such as the proceeds of fines and forfeitures. The proceeds

control and supervision of the Anditor-Ceneral. b No moneys can be
paid out of the Consolidated Fund; with the exception of the civil list
and other charges specified in the Constitution Act/ except under
the authority of either a permanent Act/ or the annual Appropria-
tion Act. Temporary supply bills are, however, passed in anticipation
of the Appropriation Act; with a view of putting the Government in
funds to meet current expenditure. A fund is also provided; called
the Treasurer’s Advance Account; for the purpose of enabling the
Government to meet expenses of an unforeseen nature; the amount of
this fund is fixed by the Appropriation Act for one year ; whilst
payments made out of it are allowed in the supplementary estimates
of the following year. Subject to this exception; all payments out of
the Consolidated Fund must be sanctioned by legislative enactment.
Payments out are also required to be made in pursuance of warrants
under the hand of the Governor/ and in the manner provided by
the Audit Act. 1 All public accounts are subject to audit by the
Auditor-General who reports to Parliament thereon. g The financial
year commences on the Ist July and ends on the following 30th June.
A periodical statement of receipts and expenditure is required to be
published in the Gazetted
Military and Naval Forces of the Colony,
The military forces of the Colony comprise : —(1) The Permanent
Forces; (2) the Partially-paid Forces; and (3) the Reserve Forces;
together with a Head Quarters and General Staff. 1 The Governor is
titular Oommander-in-Chief; but the actual military command is vested
in the General Officer commanding the Forces ; J whilst the civil con-
trol over both military and naval establishments is vested in the Colo-
nial Secretary; as Minister of Defence/ The engagement; discipline;
and discharge of members of the Permanent Forces are regulated by
the Military and Naval Forces Regulation Act of 1871 / whilst the
Partially-paid Forces are subject to the Volunteer Force Regulation
Act of 1867 and the regulations made thereunder.” 1 A local defence
committee has been recently instituted for the purpose of assisting

the defences of tlie Colony. The Naval Forces of the Colony comprise
the Naval Brigade and a corps of Naval Artillery Volunteers, both
of which are partially paid. a By an agreement concluded in 1887
between the Imperial Government and the Australasian Colonies, an
additional naval force of five armed cruisers and two torpedo boats,
is to be maintained by the Imperial Government on the Australasian
station, the Colonies undertaking to pay interest not exceeding £35,000
a year on the cost of construction and equipment, and a further
sum not exceeding £91,000 a year towards the cost of maintenance.
The agreement is to continue for not less than ten years, but may be
terminated at or after that time by two years’ previous notice. This
agreement was ratified so far as related to the United Kingdom by the
Imperial Defence Act, 1888, b and so far as related to the Colony by
the Australasian Naval Forces Act, 1887.°
Public Education.
The educational system of the Colony now rests on the Public Instruc-
tion Act, 1880. d This Act provided for the establishment through-
out the Colony of a system of compulsory and non-sectarian education;
the Council of Education, established under the previous Act of 1866,
was dissolved ; and the control and working of the new system,
together with the administration of all moneys voted by Parliament
for educational purposes, 6 were transferred to the Minister of Public
Instruction; at the same time it was provided that all aid previously
given to denominational schools should cease after 1882/ The
different classes of schools at present existing comprise (1) elementary
public schools, in which only primary instruction is given ; (2) superior
public schools, for the purposes of higher instruction; and (3) a limited
number of high schools, both for boys and girls, in which a still more
advanced course is followed, and which are intended to constitute a
link between the public schools and the University/ The Act also
provides for the establishment of evening public schools ; for the
appointment of provisional schools and itinerant teachers in sparsely
inhabited districts; and for the establishment of a training school for
teachers.' 1 Attendance is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14
for not less than 70 days in each half year, unless the child has been
or is being otherwise efficiently instructed, or is prevented from
attending by infirmity or distance. 1 The instruction given is non-sec-
tarian, but embraces general religious and moral teaching*; in addition
to which provision is made for the giving of separate unofficial re-
ligious instruction by voluntary teachers, at the option of the parents!
Parents are required to pay certain small fees which are fixed by
the Act, but may be remitted in case of poverty or inability ; k a
higher rate of fees, however, is payable in the high schools. 1 Pro-
vision is also made for the establishment of Public School Districts
and School Boards for the inspection of schools and the supervising of
a Comprising in 1894 about 591 men. b 5l and 52 Vic., c. 32. c 5l Vic., No. 22.

teachers within the district/ A system of State bursaries and scholar-
ships exists for the encouragement of poor but proficient students.
A technical college has also been established in Sydney, and various
technical schools and technical classes in other parts of the Colony.
Local and Municipal Government.
No complete system of Local Government has as yet been adopted;
but under the Municipalities Act of 1867 b and the Amending Act of
1874/ provision is made for the incorporation of Municipal Districts
and Boroughs/ Incorporation is in no case compulsory, and requires
the consent of a majority of the prospective ratepayers/ The affairs
of the municipality are conducted by a Municipal Council varying in
number according to population, and elected by the ratepayers. 1 The
Council is empowered to frame by-laws, to borrow money, to levy
rates, to construct and maintain roads and other local works, such as
those relating to sewerage, lighting, water supply, public health, and
recreation/ The Municipality of Sydney is governed by special Acts. 11
Altogether there are now some 170 municipalities, comprising less
than one-hundredth part of the area of the Colony, but somewhat
more than one-half of its total population.
The Judicial System.
The central feature of the judicial system of the Colony is the
Supreme Court. This wms first established by the Charter of Justice
of 1823/ but its jurisdiction has since been regulated and modified by
subsequent legislation.- 1 The Court now consists of a Chief Justice
and six puisne Judges, together with a staff of ministerial and other
officers. The judges hold office during good behaviour, but are never-
theless removable by the Crown upon an address of the two Houses of
Legislature/ Their salaries and pensions are charged upon the Con-
solidated Fund and cannot be reduced during their continuance in
office. 1 The Supreme Court exercises both a civil and a criminal
jurisdiction, the former being distributed into various branches, includ-
ing a jurisdiction at Common Law/ 1 in Equity/ in Probate, o in Divorce, 11
and Bankruptcy. q
The Common Law jurisdiction, both in civil and criminal cases, is
exercised in part at Sydney, and in part at Circuit Courts held through-
out the country. The Court also exercises an appellate jurisdiction both
from the decisions of its own judges sitting in the first instance, and
from the inferior courts. It also exercises a supervisory and correc-
tive jurisdiction over inferior courts and magistrates. A final appeal

lies to tlie Judicial Committee of the Privy Council —(1) in certain cases
specified by the Orders in Council/ 1 and (2) in other cases by special
leave of the Council. Besides the Supreme Court there is also a
system of local Land Boards and a Land Court of AppeaP as well
as a Yice-Admiralty Court. 0 The inferior Courts include —(1) The
District Courts, which exercise an inferior civil jurisdiction ; d (2) The
Courts of General and Quarter Sessions, which exercise a subordinate
criminal jurisdiction and are presided over by a District Court Judge
as chairman 6 ; and (3) the Magistrates' courts, which exercise a petty
jurisdiction both in civil and criminal cases/ The magistrates of
the Colony include —(1) Stipendiary Magistrates, who are appointed
to act within the metropolitan district; (2) Police Magistrates, who are
appointed to act at different places throughout the Colony; and (8)
Honorary Justices of the Peace. The system of jury trial has been
adopted in the Colony and applies to the trial of all criminal offences
except those punishable by courts of summary jurisdiction; as well as
to civil issues of fact or damages triable before the Supreme Court at
common law. In other cases the adoption of this mode of trial is made
to depend sometimes on the consent of the judge/ sometimes on
the agreement of the parties, 11 and sometimes on a claim to this effect
being made by either party/ There is no g’rand jury in the Colony,
the functions of that body being performed by the Attorney General.
The Laws of the .
The laws in force in the Colony may be classed, according to their
origin, under three heads : —(1) Rules of English law, which became
applicable to the Colony, either at the date of the original settlement,
or by virtue of 9 Geo. IV, c. 83. Under the latter statute, all rules
which were then (1828) in force in England, and which were reason-
ably suited to the circumstances of the Colony, were to be applied in
the administration of justice/ These rules are, however, capable
of being altered, and have to a large extent been altered by local
legislation/ (2) The Imperial law, which includes such Acts of the
Imperial Parliament as apply to the Colony either by express enact-
ment or necessary implication, together with orders and conventions
made in pursuance of them/ Rules derived from this source can-
not be altered by the local Legislature, except under express powers
conferred by Imperial Act. 1 (3) The Colonial law, which includes
rules derived either from colonial legislation or the interpretation
of the local courts, together with a slight element of local usage.
Even the colonial law, however, embraces many rules of English

j Thus the devolution of land upon intestacy has now been assimilated to that of
personalty ; see 26 Vic., No. 2; 54 Vic., No. 25, sec. 32.
k Some of the Imperial Acts apply to the Colony alone, such as 18 and 19 Vic., c, 54 ;
some to the Australasian Colonies generally, such as the Australian Colonies Duties Act,
1873; and some to all British territory, such as the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870.

sec. 547.


origin, some of these having been directly adopted, whilst others have
been embodied with modifications in Acts of the colonial Legislature.
Much colonial legislation, however, is of an original character, having-
been framed to meet the peculiar conditions and requirements of the
Colony. Amongst other things, a system of registration of titles to
land has been established/ as well as a system of registration of
deeds/ whilst the old distinction between the devolution of real and
personal property in intestacy has been abolished. 0
JSfatura liza tion — Chinese .
The subject of naturalization is governed by the local Naturalization
Act of 1875, under which any alien who has resided in the Colony for
five years and intends to continue such residence, may on complying
with certain conditions and paying a small fee obtain from the Gover-
nor through the Chief Secretary a certificate of naturalization/ He
will then become entitled (although only within the Colony) to all
the rights, and will be subject to all the obligations of a natural born
English subject/ Naturalization in the United Kingdom or in any
other Colony does not extend to New South Wales, but special facili-
ties are afforded to persons who have been so naturalized of obtaining
naturalization certificates in New South Wales/ Aliens, whether
domiciled within the Colony or not, are virtually entitled to all civil
rights except (1) political or public rights, and (2) the right of being
registered as owners of British vessels/ The immigration of Chi-
nese, however, is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Chinese
Restriction and Regulation Act of 1888. By this Act a poll-tax of
£lOO is imposed on every Chinese entering the Colony; vessels arriv-
ing in the Colony are prohibited from bringing more than one Chinese
for every 300 tons of tonnage; no Chinese even after entering may
engage in mining without the consent of the Minister for Mines ;
whilst the naturalization of the Chinese in the Colony is altogether
prohibited/
Miscellaneous Points.
The principle of religious equality has long prevailed in the Colony.
There is no established church, and all religious denominations remain
on the footing of voluntary associations. 1 Notwithstanding the
desire of the Imperial Government to maintain, as far as possible, a
uniform marriage law, the facilities for divorce have of late been
considerably increased by local legislation. Under the present divorce
law a wife may obtain a dissolution of marriage by reason of adultery
only on the part of the husband, J whilst wilful desertion for three
years and upwards, habitual drunkenness coupled with cruelty or
neglect, or conviction for certain offences will, also, under certain

visions of tire Extradition Act of 1870, and the treaties entered into
thereunder, apply in the Colony, subject to certain differences in the
mode of procedure. b The surrender of criminals as between British
possessions in general, and between the Australasian colonies in par-
ticular, is governed by the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881.° A system
of judicial co-operation has also been established, under which facilities
are given, as between adjacent colonies, for the mutual furtherance of
judicial proceedings, and the mutual enforcement of judgments.

THE LANDS OFFICE.


The Laws Relating to Crown Lands.
BY H. A. G. CURRY, Department of Lands.
It may be at least claimed for tlie laws relating to Crown lands of
New South Wales that they are characterised by liberality and com-
prehensiveness, and it is a fact deserving of more than passing
mention that each succeeding enactment exhibits broader and more
generous provisions than any of its predecessors. In Parliament no
subject excites keener or more general interest than land legislation,
and its importance is so widely recognised as to ensure the fullest
possible consideration and criticism. The growth of the present body
of laws has been rapid, and is an evidence both of the desire and the
determination of successive Governments to keep pace with the ever-
varying requirements, which are a necessary consequence of the pio-
gressive conditions, of the Colony. In the year 1884 the Acts then
in force* were repealed, and the “ Crown Lands Act of 1884” t by which
they were superseded has since been amended and largely supplemented
by the “ Crown Lands Act of 1889” J and the “ Crown Lands Act of
1895,” § leaving out of account a large number of intermediate Acts of
more or less importance. Prior to the commencement of the Act of
1884 the provisions of the law were somewhat indiscriminately opera-
tive over the unsold land of the whole Colony. One of the features of
that Act was the modification of this condition of things by the separa-
tion of the Colony into three divisions, termed respectively the Eastern,
the Central, and the Western, in connection with each of which the
provisions of the law were made to differ; and by an alteration of the
tenure under which pastoral leases had previously been held. Happily
the Crown Lands Act of 1895 —an Act wide in its scope and partaking
more of the character of an original than of an amending measure-
has followed with a long-desired provision which admits of the classi-
fication and survey of land before selection. Sucn a provision is well
calculated to prevent the complications and delay which experience has
shown to be almost inseparable from unsurveyed land being applied for
without due regard to conflicting interests or to the question whether
& The principal of these were the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1861, the Crown
Lands Occupation Act of 1861, the Lands Acts Amendment Act, 1875, and the Lands
Acts Further Amendment Act, 1880. The Acts of 1861 were known as the late Sir
John Robertson’s Acts. The Act of 1875 was introduced by the late J. S. Parnell, and
the Act of 1880 by Mr., now the Hon, James Hoskins, M.L.C.
+ Introduced by the late James Squire Parnell. Took effect from Ist January, 1885.
+ Introduced by the Hon. James Nixon Brunker (now Colonial Secretary), when
Minister for Lands in Sir Henry Parkes’ Government.
§ Introduced by the Hon. Joseph Hector Carruthers, Minister for Lands in the piesent
Government. The Hon. G. H. Reid, Premier, 1896.
Note. —It should not pass unmentioned that Mr. Henry Copeland, M.P. , and the late
Mr. Garrett were both associated with important proposals of land legislation.


the land is legally available, while at the same time it affords protec-
tion to the public estate against indiscriminate absorption in detached
portions without reference to any general symmetry of design.
Administration.
The head office of the Department of Lands and Survey is in Sydney,
and is presided over by the Minister for Lands —the permanent head
of the Department being the Under-Secretary for Lands.* Branches
of the Department are now situated in various parts of the Colony.
Prior to 1885 the whole business of the Department was dealt with at
the head office, but during that year it was largely decentralised by
the calling into existence of local Land Boards. Each Board is
presided over by a Chairman, who is a salaried officer of the Govern-
ment, his coadjutors, of whom there are two, being local residents,
remunerated by fees. At the head office of each Board a District
Surveyor and a staff of clerks and draftsmen are employed, besides
whom are surveyors and other field officers located elsewhere within
the boundaries which mark the Board’s jurisdiction. Applications for
certain classes of holdings, such as Homestead Selections, Conditional
Purchases, Conditional Leases, &c., come before the Board in the
first instance for investigation, and applicants are not entitled to
finally (though in some cases they may provisionally) take possession
of the land applied for until their applications have been what is
termed tc Confirmed ” by the Board. Against a Board’s decision an
appeal lies to a Land Appeal Court, which consists of a President and
two Commissioners.
Each Board District includes several smaller districts, called Land
Districts (for each of which, however, there is a separate Board), which
have been established for the convenience of the public. In each
district a Crown Lands Agent is stationed, whose duty is to supply
information to persons seeking land, and to receive applications,
deposits, and other payments under the Crown Lands Acts.
At the head office in Sydney an Information Bureau is in existence,
where the fullest and latest particulars as to the situation of available
land in the Colony, and the prices and conditions under which it may
be taken up, are always obtainable.
Reserves , Dedications,
The Governor is invested with large powers of temporarily reserving
Crown lands either from sale or lease generally, or from any specific
kind of sale or lease. Reservation takes effect immediately upon noti-
fication in the Government Gazette. Revocation of reservation does not
mature until the expiration of sixty days after Gazette notification.
The purposes of reserves are various: for instance, for water supply,
for preservation of timber, for commonage, for the convenience of
stock travelling through the country, &c. Reserves of the last-men-
tioned description may be up to one mile in width, and are associated
with camping reserves usually 640 acres in extent.
* William Houston, Esq.


Within one month after Gazette notification, an abstract of the
reservation is laid before both Houses of Parliament, if in session, or,
if not in session, within one month after the commencement of the
ensuing session.
The Governor is also invested with the power of dedicating Crown
land in such manner as may seem best for the public interest, and
he may, if thought necessary, issue a grant in fee-simple and vest the
land in trustees. An abstract of any intended dedication has to be
laid before both Houses of Parliament before the dedication can
be made.
When a Government township or village is laid out, it is usual to
define the boundaries of adjoining suburban lands, and beyond these
again to define the boundaries of what is called a te population area.”
Methods of Disposal of Crown Lands,
The principal methods by which Crown lands are alienated are by
Homestead Selection, Conditional Purchase, Purchase by virtue of
Improvements, and Purchase at Auction. The principal methods
under which Crown lands are let are by Settlement Lease, Pastoral
Lease, Occupation License, Conditional Lease, Homestead Lease,
Improvement Lease, Scrub Lease, Lease of Inferior Lands, Annual
Lease, Artesian Well Lease, Special Lease, and Residential Lease. It
will be convenient to refer to each of these under separate heads.
Limitations as to Selecting.
The intention of the authors of the various Land Acts has been to
provide land on easy terms for those who might require it for their own
bond fide use and occupation. Unhappily this intention has been too
often disappointed, and the liberal provisions of the law taken advan-
tage of for speculative purposes, and for the aggregation of large
estates. To prevent a recurrence of, or to limit, this evil, stringent
provisions were necessary. These have been supplied by recent
legislation, and may be summed up as follows : —-
1. An applicant for a homestead selection, an original conditional
purchase, an original homestead lease, or a settlement lease, is
debited with the quantity of land already held by him in
fee simple or under conditional purchase or conditional lease,
and can take up only such an area, as, added to that already
held, will keep within the maximum area allowed for the
holding applied for. Provision is made against defeat of
this restriction by any fraudulent transfer.
2. A person who shall obtain a homestead selection, an original
conditional purchase, an original homestead lease, or a settle-
ment lease, will be precluded from obtaining any further
holding of any of these four classes unless he has obtained
a certificate that adverse circumstances compelled him to
abandon or surrender his holding.
3. If his holding consists of a homestead lease or a settlement
lease, the disqualification will, however, in any circumstances
cease when the term with which the lease started shall have
run its full course.


Every application of any of tlie classes referred to is required to be
made in good faith, and an application is not taken to be made in good
faith unless the sole object of the applicant is to obtain the land in
order that he may hold and use it for his own exclusive benefit
according to law.
Qualifications to Select.
A person or, or over, the age of 16 years (of either sex) may make a
Conditional Purchase or Homestead Selection, but no person under
the age of 21 years can apply for any lease other than a Conditional
Lease, or in certain circumstances a Homestead Lease. For the last
mentioned lease a minor may apply if not less than 16 years of age
and of the male sex. Minors, so far as concerns their transactions
in connection with certain holdings under the Crown Lands Acts, enjoy
the rights, and are subject to the liabilities, of persons of full age.
A person who is not a naturalised subject of Her Majesty is
debarred until he obtains letters of naturalisation, or until lie has
resided in Hew South Wales for twelve months, and then at the date
of application he must lodg’e a declaration of his intention to become a
naturalised subject within five years from that date.
Married women are disqualified unless they are judicially separated
and actually living apart from their husbands.
Homestead Selectun .
The Homestead Selection system owes its introduction to the
Crown Lands Act of 1895, and offers special advantages to the small,
capitalist, inasmuch as the land may be held for the first five years
at the extremely low rental of IJ, and thereafter at an annual rental
of 2\ per cent, of its capital value. The rental period dates from
the date of confirmation of the application by the Local Land Board,
and the rent is payable in advance half-yearly. The initial capital
value is determined and advertised before the land is thrown open,
and is not susceptible of alteration for the first fifteen years. For every
subsequent period of ten years the land is revalued by the Local
Land Board, a fresh appraisement being necessary for each decade.
It is important to note that no minimum value is fixed by law, and
it is thus made possible from the beginning, and throughout, to
accommodate the rent to actual and changing values, an advantage
which, during a period of depreciation, must necessarily be felt by
the land owner. Land before being made available for Homestead
Selection (and there is no restriction as to the division of the Colony
in which it may be situated), is ascertained to be suitable for the
purpose, and is measured into blocks, estimated to be each sufficient
for the maintenance of a family, not, however, in any case exceeding
1,280 acres in extent j but, for the convenience of town residents,
lands within easy distances of their places of business, are some-
times made available in comparatively small areas. After a given date
(which is notified in the Government Gazette) the land may be obtained
on application to the local Crown Land Agent, the earliest applicant
having the right to the block which he may have chosen. Where


two or more applications happen to be tendered simultaneously foi the
same block, the Land Agent determines their priority by ballot. At
the time of application one half year’s rent and one third of a tee
charged for survey (see appended scale) have to be deposited. Payment
of the balance of the survey fee is spread over the first two years, one
half of such balance being payable within the first, and the other halt
within the second twelve months after confirmation. To illustrate the
foregoing : —lf a block of C)TO acres (1 square should be adver-
tised at £1 per acre, or £640 in all —but it should be mentioned heie
that land is frequently thrown open at prices considerably oelow this
—the first annual rent would be £B, and the survey fee £8 Is. 3d.
Of the former £4, and of the latter £2 13s. 9d. (i.e. £b 13s. 9d.
in all) would be required at the time of application. This
initial expense will be recognised as small, and it will be that
the selector is not called upon afterwards to expend any but a
nominal sum in improvements. All that the law requires in this con-
nection is that he shall within the first eighteen months after confir-
mation of his application erect a dwelling house worth at least £2O.
A condition of perpetual residence, commencing within three months
after date of confirmation of the application, however, attaches to
the holding, the object of which is to secure that the land shall be
used for its intended purpose, and as a salutary check against, what
has hitherto been, a prevailing tendency to take advantage of the
law for merely speculative purposes. To such purposes a short
definite term of residence has, unfortunately, hituerto been round to
lend itself, land freed from all but monetary obligations being readily
taken over.
Should the land selected contain improvements at the ciate or appli-
cation, the Selector is required to pay for them in rour equal yeaily
instalments, with interest at 4 per cent, per annum.
The title of a homestead selection is a freehold one, but the issue of
a grant in fee simple is deferred for five years, and during this term
the land cannot be transferred. The issue of the grant is contingent
upon the Land Board granting a certificate that the conditions
attaching to the selection have, up to the time of inquiry, been pro-
perly fulfilled. The grant contains provisions for “the annual pay-
ment by the grantee, his heirs, and assigns for ever of a perpetual
rent; the performance by the grantee, his heirs, and assigns for ever of
an obligation to live upon the homestead selection, having his or their
home and place of abode there f; and forfeiture to the Crown of the
lands granted in case the obligation to live thereon or to pay any sums
due as rent be not duly performed.”
The condition of residence may perhaps appear stringent, but it is
not inflexible, as before issue of the grant the Local Land Board
may grant leave to the selector for a necessary cause, and for such
period as may be determined, and, after issue of the grant, the
& This provision as to ballot applies to conflicting applications of all kinds, including
applications for Conditional Purchases, Homestead Leases, &c.
d After issue of the grant the minimum period of living on the land may be defined
by the Governor by regulations. The period, however, cannot be less than seven months
In every year.


Governor, although expressly debarred from abrogating the con-
dition altogether, is invested with the power of granting exemptions
from, or relaxation of, its performance in such cases of inability
or hardship (such as sickness, &c.) as are likely to arise. No one
exemption can operate for a longer period than one year; but as no
limitation is placed upon the number of exemptions which may be
granted, it follows that an original period of exemption may, if
necessity should dictate, be extended by a series of exemptions fol-
lowing one upon the other.
To meet the circumstances of persons who, though anxious to
secure a Homestead Selection, may be prevented by their occupations
from immediately entering* into residence, the law provides that, until
issue of the grant, that is during the first five years, the condition may
be performed by an approved deputy, on the understanding, how-
ever, that when the grant does issue, the selector himself will take
o\er the obligation. In such cases the general conditions differ from
those attaching to an ordinary Homestead Selection. The survey fee
is payable in full at the date of application, the rent up to the issue of
tne grant is instead of per cent, of the capital value, the
dwelling-house has to be worth at least £4O in value, and, in addition,
one-tenth of the land has to be in full tillage within three years after
the date of confirmation, and one-fifth during the fourth and fifth
years after that date.
TV hen a number of selectors comprising not fewer than twenty
families desire, for the sake of social conveniences and advantages, to
settle together, the Governor may allow their respective conditions of
residence to be performed within the boundaries of a village or hamlet
adjacent to their selections, subject to such conditions as he may see
fit to prescribe.
There is one special advantage conferred upon a homestead selector,
wnich has, so far, not been extended to other purchasers from the Crown.
This is protection for his holding. He is at liberty, by a simple process
of registration at the office of the local Crown Land Agent, if not in
insolvent circumstances at the time, to secure himself against depriva-
tion. His land cannot then be sold under a writ of execution, will not
be affected by his bankruptcy, or in any way taken from him for the
satisfaction of any debt or liability under process or constraint of law.
He himself is precluded from transferring the land while the registra-
tion iemains unwithdrawn, and the registration becomes inoperative
when he ceases to live on the land, or obtains protection for another
holding.
A Homestead Selection may be surrendered, in which case the
surrenderor is entitled to tenant-right in improvements. Tenant-right
may also be conceded in the case of a forfeited Homestead Selection.
Conditional .
# The Conditional Purchase (or, as it is sometimes called, the Free Selec-
tion) System, dates back to the year 1861. As the words imply, a con-
ditional purchase is a purchase in fee simple subject to the fulfilment
of certain conditions. These conditions include residence for a term


of ten years, tlie fencing or other improvement of the land, and
the payment by annual instalments of the purchase money with
interest at 4 per cent, per annum. A conditional purchase may be
of land in the Eastern or Central Divisions, and may comprise unre-
served, country land not held under pastoral or other lease. The fact of
land being held under annual lease or occupation license and containing
improvements is not a bar to purchase, nor is survey or classification of
the land a necessary preliminary. If an applicant selects land con-
taining improvements, he accepts an obligation to pay for them, but
payment is usually spread over a period and arranged for in instal-
ments. In either of the divisions mentioned the minimum area is 40
acres, the maximum area being in the Eastern Division 640 and in
the Central Division 2,560 acres. The maximum areas referred to
may be acquired by degrees at intervals, that is to say, the selector
may take up a comparatively small area at first, and graduady supple-
ment it by what are called additional purchases.
Land applied for under conditional purchase is ordinarily taken at a
statutory price of LI per acre, but the law contains a provision foi the
setting apart of what are termed Special Areas (which may be in the
Western as well as in either of the two divisions already mentioned),
and the price of land within these may be fixed at 30s. per acre and
upwards. A conditional purchase within a special area cannot exceed
320 acres in the Eastern or 640 acres in the other divisions, andhn the
Eastern Division carries no right to a conditional lease. One xeatuie
with respect to special areas is that they may include land wiilnn
suburban or population boundaries, but it is to be understood that the
minimum anc. maximum areas of all special area conditional purchases,
whether within suburban or population area boundaries, or not, are
governed by the terms of the proclamation setting them apart.
With an application (which has to be made to the local Crown
Lands Agent) for a conditional purchase of ordinary land, a deposit
of 2s. per acre and a survey fee according t 3 the appended scale
are required, hlo other payment to the Crown is necessary for thiee
years. At the end of the third year from the date of application an
instalment of Is. an acre is due, and thereafter a like instalment is
payable annually. Three grace is allowed for the payment
of each instalment. The deposit and the first instalment are wholly
devoted to reduce the debt, interest not being charged for the first
three years. The balance, after payment of the first instalment, is
therefore 17s. per acre. Out of each succeeding instalment interest is
taken and the residue credited in reduction of the debt. The interest
is computed on the balance as reduced from year to yeai, and is, con-
sequently, a diminishing quantity. Dnder this system it takes thiity
instalments of Is. per acre, together with the original deposit, to clear
off the debt; but the holder of the land may, after he has obtained a
certificate from the Local Land Board that he has fulfilled his condi-
tions, pay oil two or more instalments, or the whole of his balance
according as it suits his convenience.
On a conditional purchase within a special area a deposit of 10 per
cent., and annual instalments, each 5 per cent, of the price of the
land, are required. A survey fee is payable at the date of application.

Tlie following is a complete illustration of tlie metliod of payment
referred to. Tlie figures refer to a conditional purchase of 40 acres
applied for on the 3rd September, 1891, at £1 per acre : —•
A conditional purchase holder who may, for any year, be unable to
pay his instalment may obtain the Minister’s permission to suspend
payment, in which case the interest alone is payable, or may itself
remain unpaid, and become part of the original debt. During the
period of suspension the holder must reside on the land. °
If oi, or over, an area oi 100 acres a conditional purchase may be
subdivided, and the balance paid up on one or more of the blocks into
which the land has been subdivided.
In certain circumstances a conditional purchase may be converted
into a homestead selection.
An original conditional purchase cannot be transferred until the
conditions of the first five years are certified to have been fulfilled.
Conditional Lease .
# An 7 applicant for, or holder of, a conditional purchase applied for
the Ist January, 1885, is entitled to hold adjoining land under
conditional lease. With an application for a conditional lease a deposit
of 2d. per acre and a survey fee as for an additional conditional purchase
are payable. A conditional lease may comprise up to three times the
area of the purchase by virtue of which it is applied for, and the total
area of conditionally purchased and conditionally leased land may reach
1,280 acres in the Eastern, and cannot exceed 2,560 acres in the


Central Division. Tire lease lias a term of twenty-eight years, subject
to payment of an annual rent as appraised by the Land Board, and to
the fulfilment of sucli conditions as apply to an additional conditional
purchase. Pending appraisement of rent, a provisional rent of 2d. per
acre is payable. The rent, which is calculated from the date of
application having regard to the fact that the lessee may enter into
immediate occupation, is payable annually in advance, and is subject
(on the application of the lessee or at the instance of the Minister)
to reappraisement at the expiration of fifteen years, the new rent
applying to the balance of the term. The lessee is entitled to convert
his lease wholly or partly into an additional conditional purchase at
any time during its currency, and to continue to hold the balance
under lease. Although, therefore, in the Eastern Division a con-
ditional purchase cannot be applied for in excess of 640 acres, double
this area may be secured by the agency of a conditional lease.
Tenant-right in improvements is given to the last holder of an
expired lease, and the Governor may concede it where the lease has
been forfeited or surrendered.
Condition of Residence attached to Conditioned Purchases and
Conditioned .
The term of residence is computed so as to expire ten years from
the date of application, and although the applicant may enter into
residence immediately, he is not required to do so until his application
has been confirmed by the Land Board. He then has three months
grace to do so. Residence is defined as “ continuous. and bond fide
living* on the land as the holder’s usual home without any other
habitual residence.
A separate condition of residence attaches to every additional con-
ditional purchase or conditional lease, but in this connection certain
qualifications have to be pointed out.
An original conditional purchase and any additional conditional
purchases and conditional leases of the same series are treated as one
holding, so that no alteration of the original place of residence is
O' i
necessary.
The new condition of residence is abrogated altogether so long as the
additional conditional purchase or lease is held by the same person who
applied for the original conditional purchase; but this exemption will
not apply if the holder has previously taken up or is the owner under
conditional purchase or conditional lease of 1,280 acres in the Eastern
Division, 2,560 acres in the Central Division, or 1,920 acres partly in
two or more divisions.
Even although the holder of the additional conditional purchase or
lease may not be identical with the original selector, if he has, prior to
taking up the additional area, been continuously resident on the earlier
selections, his previous term of residence will be calculated in reduc-
tion of the new term, but in no case will he receive credit for more than
five years.
These provisions are calculated to relieve the resident from
unnecessary conditions, while at the same time they provide a check
c


against non-residential holders of large areas of conditionally pur-
chased land extending their holdings, to the exclusion of selectors
willing to take up land to make their homes thereon.
Where a parent and child hold land under conditional purchase or
conditional lease adjoining each other, the child may continue to reside
with the parent until the age of 21 is reached in the case of a boy,
or 24 in the case of a girl.
In the case of an unmarried man and an unmarried woman holding
incomplete conditional purchases, and then marrying before the
completion of the term of residence, they are permitted to reside for
the balance of the term on either one of the holdings.
The condition of residence on any conditional purchase may be
suspended by the Local Land Board for a definite period in case of
illness, drought, or for other sufficient cause.
Condition of Fencing or Improvement.
Land held under conditional purchase or conditional lease has to be
fenced in within three years from the date of confirmation of appli-
cation ; but the selector may dispense with fencing, provided that he
effects substantial improvements to the value of 6s. per acre within the
first three years after the date of confirmation, and brings their value
up to 10s. per acre within the next two succeeding years. In no case,
however, need the expenditure exceed £384 within the first, or £640
within the second term. In other words, no greater expenditure is
required on 2,560 acres in the Central Division than on 1,280 acres in
the Eastern Division.
Conditional purchases and conditional leases held by a parent and
child may without the imposition of any extra conditions be enclosed
together with a ring fence.
Local Land Boards are empowered to extend the period for fencing
in any case, and in case of illness, &c., &c., to suspend the condition
of fencing or improvements.
Non-residential Conditional Purchases.
Provision is made for conditional purchases exempt from any condition
of residence. The minimum area is 40, the maximum area 820 acres.*
The price, deposit, and annual instalments are double those which would
be payable for the same land if taken up under residential conditions.
This does not apply to the survey fee. Within twelve months after
the date of confirmation of the application the land must be fenced, and
within five years from that date improvements (excluding the fencing)
have to be made to the value of £1 per acre. With the permission
of the Land Board the fencing may be dispensed with, in which case
the improvements within the five years referred to are required to be
of the value of £1 10s. per acre. Anyone who has made any con-
ditional purchase is disqualified from making or holding a non-
residential conditional purchase; and the making of a non-residential
conditional purchase disqualifies the conditional purchaser from at any
* If the land is within a special area the maximum area is limited by the terms of the
proclamation.


time thereafter making either a residential or another non-residential
conditional purchase, unless the latter is necessary to enable him to
reach his maximum area. A non-residential conditional purchase does
not carry a right to a conditional lease.
Auction Sales.
S' Crown lands may be sold by auction without conditions; but from
considerations of policy the law provides that during any one year not
more than 200,000 acres shall be disposed of by this method. Town
and suburban lands are for the most part disposed of in this manner.
Lands are put up in blocks, each not exceeding \ acre in the case of
town lands, 20 acres in the case of suburban lands, and 640 acres in
the case of country lands. The blocks are offered at upset prices, which
necessarily vary according to their situation and advantages; but such
upset prices cannot be lower than for town lands £8 per acre, suburban
lands £2 10s. per acre, and country lands £1 ss. per acre.
In all cases a deposit of 25 per cent, is payable by the purchaser at
the time of sale. The balance, in ordinary circumstances, is payable
within three months; but in the case of town or suburban lands, or
portions not exceeding 20 acres, the Minister may submit the land to
sale on deferred payments, in which case the balance is spread over
a fixed period (not exceeding five years), and is payable in annual
instalments with 5 per cent, interest.
Town or suburban land, or land within a population area, which
has passed at auction may be applied for at the upset price. A
deposit of 25 per cent, of such upset price is payable at the time of
application, the balance being payable on the terms fixed for the
auction sale.
Purchases hy Virtue of Improvements on Gold-fields.
The discovery of gold naturally attracts a large population to the
locality, and is frequently followed by the setting out of a town with
suburban and population limits. Under the provisions of the Mining
Act, persons are authorised to occupy small areas for residential or
business purposes; and these areas they are permitted —under the
Crown Lands Act —to purchase in fee-simple by virtue of the improve-
ments.
Application is made to the Local Crown Lands Agent with a
deposit of £l, and a survey fee of £l.
The holders must be in residence on the land; but the place of
residence, though it must be of substantial materials, need not exceed
a few pounds in value. Indeed, so far as the actual requirements of
the Land Act are concerned, it will be sufficient if the improvements
should be of the value of £8 per acre on town, and £2 10s. on other
lands. The purchasable areas cannot exceed J acre of town lands,
or 1 acre of other lands. The value of the land is subject to appraise-
ment by the Local Land Board, but cannot go below £8 per acre for
town land, and £2 10s. per acre for other lands, or for any block
containing less than 1 acre. The purchase money is payable within
three months after notification in the Government Gazette that the
purchase has been approved.


Settlement Leases for Agricultural or Grazing Purposes.
Tlie settlement lease system, like tliat of liomestead selection, is of
recent origin, and is a further attempt to place land within easy reach of
the small capitalist. The land does not become available until after clas-
sification and survey, but there is no restriction as to the division of the
Colony in which it may be situated. The quantity of land which may be
taken np is regulated by the size of the farms into which the land may be
subdivided. Where the land is suitable for agriculture a farm cannot
exceed 1,280 acres ; but where it is suitable for grazing a farm may
contain up to 10,240 acres. Before being thrown open, the capital
value of the land is determined and the lease is subject to an annual
rent (not susceptible of alteration) of 1J per cent., or 3d. in the £, of
this capital value. Application has to be made to the Local Crown
Lands Agent, and with the application a deposit of one half-year’s
rent and a survey fee according to the appended scale are required.
The application has to be considered by the Land Board, and after it
has been confirmed the granting of the lease is a matter for the
Governor. The lease has a term of twenty-eight years.
In addition to payment of rent, the conditions of the lease are : That
the lessee shall pay the value of improvements which may be on the
land at date of application, either in one sum or in three equal yearly
instalments, with interest at 4 per cent, per annum; that he shall
reside on the farm and make it his bond fide residence during the whole
term ; that he shall fence it within five years ; that he shall not assign
or sublet without the Minister’s consent; and that he shall conform to
any regulations made by the Minister with respect to keeping the farm
clear of rabbits or other noxious animals, and also to clearing the farm
of scrub and noxious weeds.
Upon the expiration of the full term of the lease the last holder is
given tenant-right in improvements, and during the last year of the
lease the holder may convert 1,280 acres into a homestead selection.
Pastoral Leases and Occupation Licenses.
Up to the year 1885 the whole of the unsold lands outside town and
suburban limits were, broadly speaking, held under pastoral lease.*
Lessees, however, although they nominally held for a term of years,
had no security of tenure, inasmuch as the land could be disposed
of by the Crown in various ways, and was open to the selector on any
Thursday. Lessees possessed the privilege of buying portions of the
land by virtue of such permanent improvements as they had effected,
but this was found to invite artificial expenditure on their part, and the
privilege, in fact, came to be limited, and at last abolished, by law. In
the meantime they had yielded to the temptation of securing parts of
their runs by purchase at auction, and indirectly by conditional pur-
chase —a course which, no doubt, was in some measure induced by
the fact that speculative selection directed against their interest had.
come to be somewhat freely indulged in. It has thus happened that
most pastoral properties at the present day consist of a proportion of
« It has not been thought necessary here to make any special reference to what were
called the first-class settled districts in which the land was held under annual lease.


%
freehold, conditionally purchased, and leasehold land, and indeed, at
the present time, many extensive runs practically consist wholly of
lands which have passed out of the possession of the Crown.
After the Act of 1884 came into operation every pastoral holding in
the Colony was subdivided.*' The lessee was left in occupation of
the whole area under new rentals, but his tenure of one-half differed
entirely in character from his tenure of the other. Of one (called the
Leasehold Area) he was granted a lease for a definite term and without
risk of disturbance. Of the other (called the Resumed Area) he was
granted an occupation license, renewable annually, but as the land
has remained open to the public under the various provisions of the
Crown Lands Acts the area over which the license operated has been
liable to constant diminution. This is characteristic of all occupation
licenses, including those that may come into existence in future, as
well as those in existence now.
Leases in the Eastern Division were granted for five years, those in
the Central Division for ten years, and those in the Western Division
for fifteen years.
The Eastern leases expired in the year 1890, and the land is for the
most part held under occupation license, a preferential right to which
was granted to the outgoing lessees, together with ownership in
improvements
The Central leases expired in 1895, but by virtue of a provision
of the Act of 1889 some of the lessees by improving their holdings
earned, and are now in the enjoyment of, an additional term which
varied in different cases from less than one up to five years. Such out-
going lessees as did not apply for, or did not obtain, or withdrew their
applications for, an extension of lease were entitled to remain in occu-
pation of the land on the same terms as outgoing lessees in the Eastern
Division.
In connection with these extended leases the Crown, on the expiration
of the lease, will claim all improvements made before the Ist June,
1895, taking them as the price paid by the lessee for his extended term;
but such as may be made subsequently will, if the Crown’s permission
to their being effected be first sought and obtained, be treated as the
property of the lessee upon his continuing in occupation of the land
under occupation license, a preferential right to which is given him to
exercise.
With respect to the Western leases the term of fifteen years was by
the Act of 1889 converted, on application by the holders, into a new
term of twenty-one years, and by the Act of 1895 an additional term
of seven years has been added. This term of twenty-eight years
dates from the year 1890, and is divisible into seven-year periods, the
rent applicable to each period being subject to reappraisement.t On
the expiration of the term of a western lease, the last holder is given
tenant right in improvements. During the last year of the lease 640
* A few holdings were not subdivided on account of their limited area, the whole of
which then became a Leasehold Area.
+ Under the Act of 1895 holders of Pastoral leases in the Western Division have been
allowed to apply for an immediate reappraisement, which includes the balance of the
current seven-year period and the succeeding seven-year period.


acres may be applied for under Homestead Selection. There is now
a provision in the Act of 1895 under wliicli a resumed area in the
Western Division may be re-attached to the leasehold area.
It will be understood from the foregoing that the term of the new
pastoral leases brought into existence under the Act of 1884 varied with
the situation of the land, being shortest in the Eastern, longest in the
Western, and of intermediate duration in the Central Division. In
this way a progressive supply of land was kept up extending from the
coast to the interior, and a further provision has been made in the Act
of 1895 for withdrawing land from pastoral lease in either the Central
or Western Division, the lessee obtaining by way of compensation
an extension of lease of the residue of the leasehold, proportioned
to the area withdrawn, and a right to a preferential occupation license
of the land withdrawn. In the case of a Central Division lease up to
one-half, and in the case of a Western Division lease up to one-eighth
of the area may be resumed.
No conditions attach to a pastoral lease or occupation license other
than the payment of rent annually in advance.
The Minister may direct a re-appraisement of the rent of an occupa-
tion license at any time.
Homestead Leases.
A Homestead Lease is confined to land in the Western Division, and
may be applied for over vacant land, or land held under occupation
license, but must in either case be outside the limits of a town, or its
suburban or population area. The lease is for grazing purposes, and
offers an invitation to the small pastoralist. The minimum area is
2,560 acres, the maximum area 10,240 acres. Application has to be
made to the local Crown. Lands Agent, and at the time of application
a deposit of Id. per acre is payable, together with £lO towards cost of
survey. The application is subject to consideration and recommenda-
tion by the Land Board, by whom also the rent is appraised. The
granting of the lease devolves upon the Governor. The approval of
the lease is notified in the Gazette , and within sixty days thereafter the
balance of cost of survey and any rent due are payable. The rent is
calculated from the date of application (which gives the applicant a
right to enter into occupation), and pending the Gazette notice a pro-
visional rent of Id. per acre is payable. The lease has a term of
twenty-eight years, the rent being payable annually in advance, and
subject to reappraisement every seven years.*
The holder of a homestead lease is required to enter into occupation
within ninety days after the Gazette notification of approval of the
lease, and during each year of the first five years (computed from the
date of application) to reside continually on the land for the space of
six months.
Within the first two years of the lease he is required to fence the
boundaries of the land, but the Land Board may for sufficient cause
extend this term.
* Under the Act of 1895 holders of Homestead leases in existence when that act
became law have been allowed to apply for an immediate re-appraisement, which includes
the balance of the current seven-year period and the succeeding seven-year period.


A lease of this character cannot be transferred (except by way of
bona-fide mortgage) until the residential term has expired.
On expiration of the lease the last holder is given tenant right in
improvements, and during the last year the holder may apply for 640
acres as a Homestead Selection.
Leases ofi Scrub and Inferior Lands and Improvement Leases.
These leases are classed together, having regard to the fact that,
although there are separate provisions in the Crown Lands Acts
applying to each, they all have features in common; and in fact the
question whether land shall be offered under one provision or another
is largely a matter of choice. Some of the scrub-infested lands in
the Colony are of a high-class character, and the aim of the law is to
offer such, land on terms and conditions calculated to render their
occupation profitable both to the lessee and to the Crown.
Before land can be offered under Scrub Lease it is necessary that the
Local Land Board should recommend it to be declared scrub land; and
in connection with inferior lands a report from the Board has also to
be first obtained. This procedure is not technically necessary with
regard to lands proposed to be offered under Improvement Lease.
There is no limitation as to the area of a Scrub Lease or of a lease
of inferior lands, but an Improvement Lease cannot exceed an area
of 20,480 acres.
A Pastoral or Homestead Lease may be converted wholly or in part
into a Scrub Lease.
Scrub Leases may be granted on application or disposed of by
auction or tender. Leases of the other two classes may be disposed
of by auction or tender only. The rent of a lease obtained by appli-
cation is determined by tlie Local Land Board. A lease offered by
auction or tender of course ordinarily falls to the highest bidder or
tenderer. In all cases the rent is payable annually in advance.
Tire initial rent of an Improvement Lease or a lease of inferior
lands applies throughout the whole term of the lease, and this may
be the case with respect to a Scrub Lease; but it is in the power of
the Minister when offering a Scrub Lease to arrange that the term
of the lease shall be divided into periods, and that the rent for each
period shall be determined by appraisement.
The term of the lease is fixed by the Minister and cannot exceed
twenty-eight years. Indeed Scrub Leases or leases of inferior land are
limited in the first instance to twenty-one and twenty years respectively,
but under the Act of 1895 the Governor now has the power of extending
the term to twenty-eight years after once a lease has been granted.
A condition of residence does not attach to any of these leases.
The conditions imposed are directed principally to the destruction of
scrub or the improvement of the land. The provisions of the law in
this respect are :
Scrub Leases. —Every bolder of a Scrub Lease shall as a condition of
his lease be required to take all such steps as the Local Land Board
shall from time to time, subject to appeal, direct, for the purpose of
destroying such scrub as may be specified in his lease or promise of
lease, in and upon the land under Scrub Lease, or in and upon any


land within the boundaries of the lease, or in and upon any reserves
or roads within such boundaries; and when so destroyed to keep such
laud free from the same ; and shall commence to destroy the same
within three months after the commencement of the lease. And if
the rent thereon shall not be paid within the time allowed, or if in the
opinion of the Minister, after report by the Local Land Board, subject
to appeal, the holder shall have failed to comply with any condition
of his lease, the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, declare
such lease to be forfeited; and all improvements on such lands shall
be the property of the Crown.
Leases of Inferior Lands. —Such leases shall be subject to such con-
ditions as may be specified in the Gazette.
Improvement Leases. —The lease may contain such covenants and
provisions as to the Governor may seem expedient, according to the
circumstances of each case, and all such covenants and provisions shall
be notified in the Gazette, and in a local newspaper before the lease is
offered for sale or tenders called for. The lease shall contain covenants
and provisions for the improvement of the land leased, and for the
expenditure of money thereon, for the payment of rent, and for the
determination of the lease upon any breach by the lessee of the
covenants and provisions thereof.
The last holder of an Improvement Lease is granted tenant-right in
improvements, and the Governor may grant tenant-right to the holder
of a Scrub Lease or a lease of inferior lands. With respect to any of
these leases (where the land is not within a Pastoral or Homestead
Lease) 640 acres may be converted into a Homestead Selection.
Annual Leases .
Annual Leases of unoccupied land may be obtained for grazing pur-
poses on application to the local Crown Land Agent and payment of a
deposit of £3 for each 640 acres or less area, or may be offered by auction
or tender. They carry no security of tenure, but are somewhat
largely availed of for temporary purposes; and if the land should not be
absorbed by conditional purchase, &c., they are renewable from year to
year by payment of rent in advance on or before the 31st December.
No one lease can comprise more than 1,920 acres ; but there is no limit
to the number of leases any one person may hold. No conditions of
residence or improvements are attached to them, the only condition
being, as already explained, payment of rent annually in advance.
With respect to a lease applied for, the land is allotted, and the rent
appraised, by the Local Land Board. The Minister may refuse any
application, and, after three notice, cancel any Annual Lease.
Leases Surrounding Artesian Wells.
The discovery of artesian water in large quantities promises to be a
fact of the largest importance to lands in the Western Division of the
Colony, and, as an encouragement to the holders of land in that
division under the insecure tenures of annual lease or occupation
license, the law contains the following provision : —Any such holder
desirous of boring and searching for water may, on making application
to the Minister and depositing £lO, obtain the reservation of an area


up to 10,240 acres surrounding tire proposed position o£ the bore.
The effect of the reservation is to protect the land for the applicant’s
own use, and, should boring operations be, in the Minister’s opinion,
sufficiently successful and promising, a lease may be granted of the
land at the same rent as already paid for it, but for a term which may
be as long as the unexpired term of the associated pastoral lease.
Special Leases,
The law provides for a class of leases termed Special Leases. Such
leases (which do not involve a condition of residence) are to meet
cases where land, in any Division, is required for some industrial or
business purpose —such, for example, as for a brick kiln, tannery, wool-
washing establishment, &c., &c. Land under the sea or under the
waters of any harbour, lake, river, &c., is deemed to be Crown lands,
and may be leased for the erection of wharves, bathing places, &c. A
Special Lease may be obtained on application at an appraised rent, or
disposed of at auction or otherwise. The area leased cannot exceed
320 acres, nor can the term exceed twenty-eight years. The conditions
are accommodated to the circumstances of each case. The rent is
payable annually in advance.
Application for a Special Lease is made to the Chairman of the
Local Land Board with a deposit of £3 and a survey fee according to
the appended scale.
Residential Leases,
A “ Residential Lease ” of land within a Grold or Mineral Field may
be granted to the holder of what is termed a “ Miner’s Bight ” or
“Mineral License.” Such right or license is obtainable under the
provisions of the Mining Act. Application for the lease is made to
the local Crown Lands Agent with a deposit of £l, a provisional rent
of Is. per acre and a survey fee according to the appended scale.
The maximum area which may be leased is 20 acres, and the maximum
term of the lease is fifteen years. The rent is determined by the Land
Board, and is payable annually in advance. The Minister may at any
time direct a re-appraisement of rent. The principal conditions of
the lease are residence during the currency of the lease, and the
erection within twelve months from the commencement of the lease
of such buildings and fences as are necessary for the performance
of this condition. The lessee is given tenant-right in improvements.
Exchange of Land between the and Private Polders.
In the chapter dealing with Pastoral Leases reference has been
made to the fact that Pastoral Lessees before the granting to them of
security of tenure had made it a practice to secure portions of their
runs by conditional purchase or purchase in fee-simple. The practice
was in many instances disadvantageous to the public estate, inasmuch
as the Crown lands were left in detached blocks, severed by the
lessees’ freehold properties, and, moreover, the lessees themselves have
come to find that it would be convenient to them to gather their free-
holds together into one or more consolidated blocks, especially within
their leasehold areas. This result can be secured by the Crown
accepting a surrender of private lands, and granting lands in exchange

elsewhere. An exchange may apply to land actually granted, or land
(such as that held under conditional purchase) of which a grant could,
by the payment of purchase money, be demanded, and it is possible
to exchange lands on which a balance is owing for lands to which the
debt is transferred. Any proposal for exchange before finally maturing
has to be made the subject of an investigation by the Land Board,
and while the private owner’s interests are fully respected, the Crown’s
interests are not less jealously guarded. The carrying of an exchange
into effect ultimately depends upon the mutual agreement of the
private owner on the one hand, and the Crown on the other.
The provisions with regard to exchange extend to cases where the
Crown is desirous of securing lands for public purposes, and in such
cases the question of consolidation of lands does not necessarily enter.
For a Homestead Lease, the survey fee is such sum as may be specified in the Gazette notification of
approval of the application, but not exceeding' £1 per linear mile.
* Where the cost of survey of a Settlement Lease is less than the scale rates, the difference may be
refunded.

force onh" on the Ist June, 1895, and little time was given between that date and the 31st December, 1895,
to make land available under these new systems. During this short period, however, the popularity cf the
new systems has been made evident.

Commercial Relations.
BY R. L. NASH.
A Preliminary Comparison.
New South Wales lias for some years past carried on a more extended
commerce witli tire motlier country and witli tlie world in general than
any otlier Australasian Colony. This was the case even while the
population of Victoria outnumbered that of New South Vales, and
while the people of Melbourne considerably exceeded those of Sydney
and Newcastle combined. But now, when this is the most populous
Colony, and when Sydney is the most wealthy capital, the supremacy
of New South Wales, both as a producer for the outside world and as
an importer, is clear and increasing. Her most steadily advancing
rival is, probably, at the present time, Queensland, and as a producer
of beef, hides, tallow, sugar, and gold Queensland is a very worthy
rival. But the clear lead of New South Wales in the total volume of
trade is indisputable, and will, I doubt not, be amply maintained until
Federation shall wipe away these trading distinctions.
It is not the purpose of these pages to institute detailed comparisons
with neighbouring colonies, but the change referred to has been going
on gradually for years, and now that New South Wales has definitely
determined upon the freest of free-trade in all her ports, it may be
expected to develop in a yet more marked degree. The following*
figures show the expansion of external trade over a period of years of
all the seven Colonies in the Australasian group; but, as will soon
appear, the returns are open to some very material qualifications.

It is necessary to go back to tbe year 1880 and previous years to find
tbe time when Victorian gross exports exceeded those of New South
Wales; but the Victorian imports exceeded those of this Colony as late
as the year 1889., although in 1894 the New South Wales shipments
showed an excess valued at £3,331,342. But this is not a fair statement
of the relative importance of the trade of these colonies. For instance,
in 1894, New South Wales wool was exported, via Melbourne, to the
value of £2,030,645, and thus to this extent swelled both the imports
and exports of Victoria, while a further £488,115 worth went by way
of South Australia, to be dealt with in like manner by that colony.
The South Australian returns were also swollen by £562,966 of New
South Wales imports, and by £2,510,542 of New South Wales
exports in and out of Broken Hill; and upon making due allowances
for these movements in through trade, a very material difference is
disclosed. This may be judged from the following comparison :
* Including New South Wales produce, as above.
This, of itself, serves to indicate that the mother country and Europe
have already, in a considerable degree, selected Sydney as the entrepot
whence their manufactures may be best distributed throughout Aus-
tralasia ; and but for the recent depression in the import trade the
marked difference in the “ produce of other countriesexported by
New South Wales would have been yet more striking.

The Disadvantage of a Comparison based upon 1894 Values.
It must be acknowledged that tbe year 1894 was one of great
depression in the import and re-export trade. The financial crisis of
1893 affected the purchasing powers of all the colonies for the time
being very considerably, and imports of European manufactures were
much restricted. This may be judged from the general contraction in
the imports shown upon contrasting the returns for 1894 with 1891.
Again, the depression, which was world-wide, helped to contract our
purchasing power by giving us unprecedentedly low prices for almost
every article produced here for exportation. Wool, tallow, metals of
all kinds, meats and coal—-of which the exports of Hew South Wales
mainly consist —were all afflicted in the same way; and low prices
told extensively upon the cash value of the shipments in the face of
the more extended quantities exported. Mr. Coghlan, when Govern-
ment Statistician, computed that the average prices of Hew South
Wales exports in 1894, excluding gold, were as much as 48 per cent,
lower than in 1873; 41 per cent, lower than in 1884; and 29 per
cent, lower than in 1890; and it was impossible, especially in the
sudden collapse of prices in 1893-4, to make good these extreme
differences by increased quantities. Thus 1894 is an altogether ex-
ceptionally adverse year upon which to base a record of the trade of
Hew South Wales, and the money value gives us an altogether fore-
shortened picture of the real importance of that trade. Let us there-
fore shift our ground from values which were disheartening*, and in a
large measure temporary, to quantities which are encouraging, and to
more than their full extent permanent.
* In many instances there must have been considerable increases in 1895, including hides, skins, tallow,
leather, copper, and meats (frozen, preserved, and live).
Here there is seen undoubted and sustained progress. In wool,
silver, and silver ores, in coal, tallow, frozen and preserved meats, hides,
sheepskins, leather, the increase is unmistakable. In gold the pro-


duction diminished by one-half between 1870 and 1880, only to revive
rapidly between 1890 and 1894. The reasons for this revival are
various. Many of the New South Wales gold ores have proved suffi-
ciently refractory to resist the old-fashioned methods of treatment.
But modern science has brought the vast and widely-distributed gold
ores within reach of the practical miner, and old abandoned workings,
as well as fresh discoveries, point to a considerable extension of the
gold-fields of New South Wales in the early future. It is not possible
to write so hopefully of the prospects of the copper and tin exj3orts.
For a time the remarkable fall in the price of copper resulted in the
closing of most of the New South Wales copper mines, which found it
difficult to compete against the vastly-increased output of America.
But latterly it has been found possible to successfully work some of
the mines upon the tribute system; and there can be no question that
a fair rise in the price of copper would at once augment the produc-
tion. The extension of the railway system to Cobar and other locali-
ties has also aided in a revival of the industry, which will tell upon
the production of the metal within the next few years. Tip to the end
of 1894 New South Wales has produced tin to the value of £6,040,035.
This industry reached its limit of greatest production in 1881; but the
shallow deposits have now been largely worked out, and the present
operations in stream tin are mainly in the hands of the Chinese. There
are, however, lodes worked in the north of the Colony, although the
production of tin is not at present increasing.
It is apparent that the present surplus production for exportation—
the surplus by which New South Wales is known mainly to markets
beyond Australia —lies in her pastoral and mineral industries. Her
agricultural, dairying, and manufacturing occupations have hitherto
in the main been carried on for internal consumption. The growth of
cereals has been extended, and could well be developed to the point
when there would be a surplus for shipment; and in 1892 and 1893
there were moderate exports of butter and small exports of cheese.
But it is evident that, so far, the Colony has not availed itself of its
many and great advantages in its wide extent of lands both for grain-
growing and dairying. Considerably more attention has been paid to
such industries since the crisis of 1893, and a few years hence the
position will be altered materially. But up to the present cattle have
eeen mainly raised for their meat, tallow, and hides, and sheep for
their wool, meat, tallow, and skins. Such industries for many years
made a high return upon the labour expended. But the late fall in
wool and tallow has now directed attention towards making the most
of the herds and flocks of which the Colony is possessed, and it will
prove to the great permanent advantage of New South Wales that this
has been the case.
The External Trade Classified,
The great majority of the staple industries of the Colony are dealt
with separately in these pages, and it would, therefore, be a repetition
of the other portions of this work if they were enlarged upon here.
The following classification, however, of the imports and exports, based
mainly upon that made by the Government Statistician, will give an
effective general survey of the external trade.

Note.— The total imports in 1895 were £15,992,415; the exports of domestic produce were £16,456,123;
the other produce exported was £5,478,662, and the grand total of the exports £21,934,785.
It may at first appear remarkable that under such heads as foods,
live stock, and bullion and specie New South Wales should, in the
year 1894, have imported more largely than she exported. But it
must be remembered that hitherto the Colony has not produced
enough wheat, oats, and sugar for her home consumption, that she
imports tea, coffee, and dried fruits, and that her food exports, con-
sisting mainly of frozen and preserved meats, have not yet attained
such magnitude as they bid fair to do. Indeed, the following com-
parison will serve to show that, with due attention to breeding and to
slaughtering at the proper ages, there is room for vast increases in the
food exports :
The greatest need in the development of trade in such perishable
product is that of adequate and suitable transport, and upon this point
the Government and the leading’produce merchants are now interesting
themselves greatly. A regular supply of shipping possessed of adequate
frozen storage, proper warehouse accommodation at the ports of ship-
ment, slaughtering places up the country in touch with the railways,
where freezing can at once be effected, and cold carriage over the rail-
ways are all requisite to a proper development of the trade where the
principal flocks and herds are located hundreds of miles inland, for it
is an essential that the meat should be delivered in the United Kingdom
in the best condition. Thus, there is much still to be accomplished
before this industry can be brought into full bearing.

The Significance of the Present Surplus Exports.
In the years when New South Wales, as well as neighbouring
colonies, was importing British capital extensively for investment, the
imports, as was to be expected, exceeded in value the exports. But
we must never lose sight of the fact that probably something like
£100,000,000 of British capital is invested here, or is in the hands of
non-residents ; and that, taking the average of the five years, 1890-94,
payments to the extent of over £5,000,000 a year had thus to be made
to other countries —mainly to Great Britain. The Government
Statistician places this payment upon British capital, and by way of
incomes to non-residents at £5,163,900 per annum in the five years,
1890—94, inclusive; and even after the curtailment of dividends and
incomes since the crisis, these payments probably exceed £4,000,000.
In view of this important factor in New South Wales finance, the
following marked change since 1890 carries considerable significance:—
In 1895 the excess of exports is very striking; Thus, upon the face
of these returns, it is evident that this Colony is more than paying
its way in the shape of an excess of exports. But these valuations are
those at New South Wales ports; that is, after all the imports have
been swelled by the cost of carriage to our shores, while at the same
time the exports are returned minus all shipping charges. Nor do
all these shipping charges accrue to the outside shipowner. There are
968 vessels upon the New South Wales Register, with an aggregate of
109,372 tons, upon which 5,806 men find employment; and if these
earned a gross average of £lOO per head there would be an addition of
£580,000 a year to be added to the surplus exports after meeting all
payments to British investors and others to the full. There were
questions raised in the United Kingdom at the time of the great
collapse in prices, and after the financial crisis in Australia, whether
these colonies could meet their obligations. Those questions need
not have been raised; but figures such as those given above answer
them fully. When, too, it is taken into consideration that the pro-
duction of New South Wales is not only capable of development,
but is at the present time actually expanding’ greatly, the power
of her people to deal with that indebtedness and to honour their
obligations lies beyond the bounds of dispute. That, for a time, the
extravagance of the “ boom ” period, and its heavy commitments, were
followed by loss and hardship, and a curtailment of the spending
powers of the people was inevitable. But that period of extravagance,
with its actual restriction of production, is at an end, the losses have
already, in a great measure, been lived down, and the lesson, bitter as
it was at the time, has not been without its advantages. Even old






countries like the United Kingdom have experienced the effects of
such transitions, and have been slower than this Colony to recover.
During’ 1895 there was a material recovery of confidence in New South
Wales, and that in spite of a deficient rainfall; and 1896 is opening
with yet increased buoyancy.
Sydney and Newcastle as Ports.
Naturally, with the largest share of the trade of these colonies, the
shipping returns of New South Wales are likewise the most extensive.
The harbour of Sydney, not seldom with nearly a hundred great ocean
steamers and sailing ships on its waters, affords the most indisputable
evidence of being a busy port, for which its natural advantages
entirely fit it. It is, indeed, the busiest port in the Southern Hemis-
phere. For many miles the depth of water is ample for tonnage of the
deepest draught; its tides average but 3 feet 4 inches, and the flow
and ebb of water in the centre of the stream is almost imperceptible.
Again, the harbour is almost entirely landlocked, even the com-
paratively narrow opening through the Heads being unseen from any
part of Sydney, while the great rollers coming in from the Pacific
expend their entire force upon the rocks which face the entrance or
upon the nearest shores of Middle Harbour, another extensive water-
way at present given over to the Sydney excursionist, but which will
some day add to the importance of Sydney as a port. The accom-
panying plan of Sydney Harbour will serve to show the dimensions of
the port better than many pages of description would do; and the
multitudinous bays and coves, separated for the most part by high
land, afford ample protection in all weathers.
Upon the shores of Sydney Harbour the Government have constructed
some 15,500 feet of the wharfage, the major part with a depth along-
side from 25 to 30 feet at low tide ; and the private wharfs are very
numerous, and in the aggregate of fully equal extent, though the
depth of water alongside varies considerably. Still, many of the
private wharfs will accommodate vessels drawing from 20 to 25 feet,
and one has a depth of no less than 35 feet. The bottom, too, being’
soft, even, and free from currents, vessels may rest thereon at low
waiter without risk. These 7 miles of wharfs are fitted with ample
crane pow T er and storage, and additions are constantly in progress.
At Newcastle, there are also about 12,000 feet frontage of Grovern-
ment wharfs, wdiich will accommodate vessels drawing from 20 feet to
23 ft. 6 in., in addition to 1,500 feet of private wharfs.
The dock accommodation in Sydney is extensive. The two Govern-
ment graving docks on Cockatoo Island stand first in importance.
The Sutherland Dock is 600 feet long by 84 in width, and would
admit a vessel drawing 32 feet; while the Fitzroy Dock is 470 feet
long by 59 in wfidth, and would admit a vessel drawing 211 feet.
Next in importance is MorFs Dock, 410 feet by 66 feet, which wfill
accommodate vessels with a draught of 19 feet; and there are, in
addition, a number of floating docks and patent slips at Sydney, and
two patent slips at Newcastle.
It would be possible to extend information of this description very
greatly. The lighthouse and tug services are excellent; and the

accommodation at such minor ports as Wollongong, the Bichmond
and Clarence Elvers, Twofold Bay, and elsewhere, are also subjects
which might be enlarged upon, as New South Wales possesses many
harbours which will in the course of years come into greater pro-
minence. The developments now in progress at Lake Illawarra
are also of considerable importance. But to enter into these matters
would extend these remarks to an inordinate length.
The Shipping Returns.
According to the published returns of the different Australasian
colonies, the shipping tonnage entered and cleared during the year
1894 were as under: —
But bald figures such, as these need a great deal of qualification.
For instance, a P. and O. or Orient liner reaching Sydney as its final
port is entered and cleared only once, and Sydney is admittedly the
most important port which it enters in Australian waters. Yet on
its outward voyage it calls at Albany (Western Australia), Adelaide,
and Melbourne, and is entered and cleared, and the same process is
repeated on its homeward voyage, and upon this weekly mail service
alone these duplications add something like 300,000 tons per annum
to the apparent tonnage entering and clearing Victorian, South Aus-
tralian, and Western Australian ports. In New South Wales, too,
a vessel proceeding from Sydney to Newcastle for coal is not included
as tonnage entering the second port, but only the first port of entry
and the port of final departure are returned, and purely coasting
services are excluded. Thus the above comparison does not adequately
indicate the relative magnitude of the shipping returns of New
South Wales. If however, we take the average value of the exports
per registered ton cleared in 1894 at £7 3s. in New South Wales, at
£6 12s. in Victoria, at £5 3s. in South Australia, and at £1 18s. in
Western Australia, ,we obtain a clearer insight into the relative
significance of these shipping services to the different colonies.
A quarter of a century back the shipping returns of Victoria
exceeded those of New South Wales materially, and even as late as
1881 the shipping cleared from the ports of this Colony showed,
apparently an excess of only 137,000 tons. Last year, however, the
excess was as much as 750,000 tons, and as has been shown, the
utilisation of that tonnage here was relatively greater.

Nationality of the Shipping.
The question of nationality is important as indicating the extent to
which foreign competition has been carried. The following figures
show the tonnage cleared in 1894, the tonnage entered being very
similar ;
* Excluding overland traffic.
It may be a surprise to some readers that the Australian tonnage
should so considerably exceed the British tonnage. But the explana-
tion is not far to seek. The Australasian coasting trade deals to _a
larger extent with passengers to and from intercolonial ports, and in
low-priced goods, such as coal, as movements coastwise of goods of
higher value are discouraged by the excessive tariffs in the different
colonies. There can, indeed, be small doubt that were Australia
federated the coasting trade would grow vastly in importance, though
it would cease to be classed as imports and exports.
But looking to values, it will be seen that the exports to the United
Kingdom in 1894 reached 51*8 per cent, of the total shipments; and
in reality it reached a yet larger proportion as the bulk of the over-
land exports to Melbourne and South Australia were destined for the
United Kingdom. It cannot, so far, be said that in spite of heavy
subsidies to certain foreign shipping lines, they have appropriated
any very large proportion of the merchandise actually conveyed from
New South Wales. The direct shipments to France, Germany, and
Belgium amount to 20*2 per cent, of the above values, and consisting
largely of wool, such exports naturally represent a high cash value.
These comparisons, are, however, in a considerable degree vitiated by
the tonnage being in part employed in conveying goods to other
destinations, and probably an exact comparison, which is not attainable,
would considerably vary the foregoing* results.
That Germany and America have materially undermined the dealings
of the British manufacturer with New South Wales importers in
certain trades, such as musical instruments, iron and steel, machinery,
toys, clocks, and fancy articles, is strongly in evidence, even though

much of such merchandise is apparently shipped from ports of the

nearly doubled.
Sydney and Newcastle.
Any comparison of the trade of Sydney and Newcastle is also diffi-
cult, owing to the fact that vessels are entered only at their first port
in the Colony and cleared from the last port of departure. The follow-
ing figures are, however, available : —-
The most important export of Newcastle is coal, and there are
facilities for the shipment of upwards of 23,000 tons of coal daily from
the Newcastle wharfs.
These are big figures. It is strange, even absurd, to peruse the
writings of certain organs of public opinion at home in England
decrying the progress and stability of Australia when the evidences of
that progress are so great, the magnitude of its productions already
so enormous, and, to those who study the position, the power of further
expansion so evident. There are only three ports in the whole of the
United Kingdom which carry on a more important export trade than
Sydney, in spite of all the recent unprecedented fall in the market
value of New South Wales products. The expansion, too, in the trade
of the Colony has been very rapid. In 1871 only 794,500 tons repre-
sented the shipping cleared from all ports of the Colony; in 1881 the
total was swelled to 1,330,300 tons, while in 1894 it had increased to
2,878,600 tons, and in the years to come the total will be far more
considerable. The coast line is free from obstructions and easily
navigated; living is exceptionally cheap to the labouring population;
and the most material hindrances to progress in times past, wdiich have
been found in recurring’ labour troubles and in the distance from
O _ _
European markets, are certainly less prominent than they were, lor
labour disputes, measured by the number and importance of strikes,
have been fewer during the past two years, and the improvements in
modern shipping tend steadily towards the annihilation of distances
and to the cheapening; of freights. Freights have never been so low
from this Colony as they are at the time of writing these remarks.
The Australian people are themselves growing steadily in numbers,
and in New South Wales they number four-fold what they did a quarter
of a century ago. This is a land in which we are accustomed to look
forward; and in another quarter of a century how small and pioneer
in character all the facts and figures herein quoted will necessarily
appear!


CIRCULAR QUAY, FROM CUSTOM-HOUSE.




Import Trade.
BY W. G. RENDALL.
There is perhaps no department of commerce which has exerted so
great an influence on the wealth and progress of New South Wales, or
the social condition of the community, as that of the Colony’s import
trade. With the loosing of her fiscal bonds the port of Sydney gives
promise of becoming the entvepot of Australasia and Oceana, and this
can hardly be wondered at considering the unrivalled geographical
position, combined with the splendid facilities offered alike for import,
transhipment, or distribution. Here traders of every clime will find
a ready market for their products and manufactures, to return laden
with the wealth of our own soil. If the trade of New South Wales
has made such substantial progress under the rule of protective duties,
the expansion of operations under the flag oi freedom can hardly be
estimated. Recognising the advantages which must ever accrue to
the trade of the port of Sydney, a brief glance at some of its details
will be of interest.
Foreign trade with this Colony may be divided into two distinct
branches —home consumption and re-export. The latter is by no
means a small quantity in the aggregate of the Colony’s annual turn-
over, and it is worthy of note that the volume of our export trade has
been largely augmented in proportion to that of the other colonies by
reason of our lighter duties and the more liberal scale of port charges.
The local import trade of to-day is a totally different business from that
of a few years ago. Easy communication and rapid transit have
brought about a set of circumstances which the pioneers of Australian
trade never dreamed of. With the advent of a liberal cable system
between all the principal manufacturing and producing centres of the
world, aided by voluminous codes and the choice of numerous steam
services, the pulse of the local market has learned to beat in harmony
with that of the Antipodes, and spot stocks now feel the effect of fluctuat-
ing cost more keenly than was the case when our supplies made long
voyages by sailing ships. The result of these new conditions has not
been all profit to the average importer however. The strictly “ whole-
sale ” trade is a thing of the past, and the occupation of the “ middle-
man ” has almost gone. It is now within the means of small retailers
to set up as u direct importers ” in every part of the Colony, and the
business which once transpired within the walls of a few city ware-
houses has become distributed over the length and breadth of the land.
This has been particularly the case with the soft goods trade, and with
each succeeding season large warehousemen find it more difficult to
place their goods or realise the profits of bygone days. Nor is the
importer of soft goods alone in this respect; hardware merchants.


wholesale grocers, and providers have experienced a similar change in
the order of things. Not only has the retailer undertaken to represent
some particular house in London or on the Continent, or it may he in
America or the East, hut the pastoralist or agriculturist, prompted hy
the same example, has taken upon himself the task of importing or
indenting his own woolpacks, cornsacks, or fencing wire, though it
does not always follow that he makes the hest bargain hy so doing.
Indeed, it not unfrequently happens that the would-he importer, un-
acquainted with the vagaries of foreign markets, pays higher prices
than he would hy filling his order on the spot. It is sufficient for
him, however, that he has bought first-hand, no matter how much it
has cost to do so.
These observations are sufficient to show that the modus
of import is easy, and that it obtains very largely among traders
quite independent of the acknowledged import trade. The result of
all this has been distinctly to the advantage of the consumer;
moreover, the splitting up of bulk operations has brought general
business nearer a cash basis, and at no previous time has general
trade been in a more healthy condition than it is at present. Profits
have certainly been narrowed down to a very small margin, and
importers look to turning their stock over three or four times a year
at 3to 5 per cent, rather than once or twice at larger profits. Keener
competition has meant being in closer touch with the world’s markets,
buying sparingly, and limiting credit, and the sequel has been the
purification of trade and the stronger growth of confidence.
The comparatively independent position which importers occupy
with relation to each other has given rise to a want of unity as regards
current prices, and merchants are more inclined to sell on the basis
of individual cost than on actual import values, as compared with
prices ruling at export centres. This has no doubt done more to cur-
tail bulk business than any other cause, as in the most buoyant mar-
ket sellers can always be found willing to quit at below recognised
ruling rates. Between the advantages for export and the rapid transit
to this market, the opportunities for controlling local stocks do not
often present themselves, and it is only by reason of the light stocks
carried during the period of fiscal uncertainty that extra profits have
been secured by “ buying up the market.”
The purification which trade has undergone with the experience of
a retail class of business has not been without its disadvantages, the
most prominent of which may be considered the increased cost of dis-
tribution. In past years it was the custom of the country trader to
purchase supplies sufficient for three, six, or even twelve months’ re-
quirements. Now, however, orders are generally made up of a few
cases of each line, to be renewed again from time to time. The cost of
handling has necessarily become greatly increased, and buyers’ prices
have become weighted with extra expense in the way of selling charges,
freight, and packing. The return to a short, permanent tariff, how-
ever, may be considered likely to remedy this evil in a general way,
although it is most unlikely that the distributing trade of the Colony
will ever return to what may be called a “bulk basis.”
The currency of low prices and over-competition has stimulated a
number of efforts among importers to combine for the purpose of


fixing convention rates for leading lines of goods. The life of
ciations ” formed for the purpose has invariably been of short dura-
tion, or they have failed to come to a working head ; and, apart from
the soft goods and wine and spirit trades, rules and regulations for-
mulated by the various departments of trade have been honoured
rather in the breach than the observance. The Wine and Spirit Mer-
chants’ Association, however, has proved the most successful venture
of its kind, and is doing good work in the suppression of illicit dis-
tillation and the adoption of salutary measures for the regulation of
the more important branches of the import trade. High duties have
been synonymous with the importation of wines and spirits of an un-
desirable quality, and what has failed to find consumers in the local
market has been readily absorbed by the island trade, to the detri-
ment of traffic in a better standard of liquor. As the revenue derived
from the import of intoxicants and narcotics amounts to nearly
£1,000,000 per annum, the importance of an association having for its
special object the regulation of trade in these items cannot be over-
estimated.
With imports valued at £15,000,000 to £25,000,000 per annum, it
is not to be wondered at that competition has grown keen with manu-
facturing and export countries, especially between the eastern and
western worlds. While increasing rivalry for the trade of Port
Sydney has reduced prices to their lowest possible level, it has pro-
moted increased communication with foreign ports, and stimulated a
reciprocal interchange of natural products. The official division of
the import trade of New South Wales between the United Kingdom,
the continent of Europe, America, the East, and intercolonial ports,
is set forth in the following table; but it is perfectly certain that the
trade from and to Germany, the United States, and France, is far
more considerable than these figures would indicate, and that in many
descriptions of goods it is increasing. Take, as an instance, such an
item as fencing wire, the imports of which in 1894 were £97,400. Of
this it appeared that under £50,000 worth came from the continent of
Europe, whereas in reality the true amount must have been from
£BO,OOO to £90,000 worth, the supply of the vast bulk of the imports
having passed into German hands. The imports of such goods from
Victoria and other colonies merely represents the sorting up of stocks
between the different ports.
Although the figures in the following table are incomplete as repre-
senting the whole trade of the Colony, they are fully sufficient to show
that the operations of the port of Sydney are spread over a very wide
area. It must also be distinctly remembered that the returns furnished
do not include business in transhipments from ships’ side, for which
entry is never passed, which means that the “unknown quantity” in the
export transactions must be very considerable, and would show very
much larger results in the aggregate. The most superficial analysis
of the table is sufficient to reveal the fact that Sydney holds the key
of the Queensland and Pacific trade at least, while that of other inter-
colonial ports shows that the exchange of imported goods is equally
important, and it may be fairly assumed that whatever increase may
take place in trade with the East is pretty sure to trend towards this
port.

NEW SOUTH WALES.


With reference to the Pacific Island trade, it is worthy of note that
the change in the fiscal policy of the Government is already showing
indications of increased trade with Sydney, and this has been made
more apparent by the expansion in transactions between the west
coast of America and Sydney, which gives promise of enhancing the
volume of trade with the Pacific, and nothing can be more conducive
to its development than the improved steam service which is now
available in that direction. One of the most practical and significant
features in connection with the development of this trade has been
the recent establishment of an oil-mill in Sydney for the treatment of
copra or cocoanut, for the extraction of cocoanut oil and the manu-
facture of oil-cake. In opening this new venture, which is the first
of its kind in Australia, if not south of the Equator, Lever Brothers
(Limited) will concentrate in Sydney a large proportion of raw material
for manufacture which previously was only transhipped for London.
Not only will the island trade be directed to our port by this new
project, but with the manufacture of oil-cake the dairy-farming industry
will receive a stimulus which will place butter manufacturers and
exporters beyond the dangers of droughts and their disastrous effects.
Sydney being in a position to shortly absorb the bulk of the copra
production at her doors, will hold an impregnable position with respect
:o a reciprocal trade with the islands, and a glance at the table given
above shows that this is no small quantity. The expenditure of some
tens of thousands of pounds of English capital in such a venture is at
once significant, and illustrates in a practical way that English manu-
facturers have some confidence in the future of trade in Sydney.
This undertaking is one which must necessarily succeed, inasmuch as
all the oil which can be produced here will be at once absorbed for
manufacturing purposes by the Company mentioned at their English
works, so that a market is secured which will stand to the producer
without fear or favour. Under such advantageous conditions the
future of our trade in the direction of the Pacific seems assured.
A cursory glance at the details of the import trade in some of the
items enumerated may not be out of place, as the trade of Sydney
carries with it distinctive features of interest to the foreign manu-
facturer, producer, and the local importer alike, and which may be
summarised thus :
Tea.
Until quite recently the direct import of tea to New South Wales
was a small proportion of the trade done with Australia. Now, how-
ever, this commodity has taken a strong list Sydneyward, and compe-
tition has grown strong between China and the more enterprising
growers of India and Ceylon for a first place in our markets. Becent
Eastern hostilities certainly gave a great fillip to business with Colombo,
and Calcutta has left no stone unturned to be well within the running.
The result has been heavy consignments and large offerings at auction,
upon which the blender and retailer have thrived at the expense of
growers and importers. India has proved a powerful rival both in
quality and price, which has tended to flood the market with common
descriptions, and not always of a very desirable quality, against which
Ceylon has held her own fairly well, notwithstanding the loss of


demand for higher grades. China teas, however, especially the finer
descriptions, have suffered materially in the conflict, and costly
Foochows have long since been banished to the realms of neglect.
Sugar.
The periodical apparition of “ beet sugar,” either of continental or
threatened colonial production, has levelled the market for Queens-
land sugars fully 50 per cent, during the past few years, while China,
Java, and Mauritius have been active in reducing prices to their
present level of £l5 10s. in bond. The introduction of beet sugar has
not proved a success, inasmuch as recent shipments have invariably
resulted in “sweated” cargoes, involving importers in heavy loss.
Although the partial failure of the 1895 Queensland crop has
strengthened market values, prices have been so completely held in
equilibrium by Mauritius and other imports, chiefly to the southern
colonies, that the realisation of higher prices has been out of the
question.
Breadstuff's.
The return to freetrade has heralded what may be regarded as a
phenomenal departure in wheat and flour transactions. At the moment
of writing over 20,000 tons of wheat, and several thousand tons of
flour, are on the way from San Francisco to Sydney as the first bulk
instalment of American breadstuff s to aid in making good the shortage
in the 1895-6 wheat crop, which is estimated at between 4,500,000 and
5,000,000 bushels less than the Colony’s requirements. This wheat is
being brought alongside our wharves at 3s. 4|d. to 3s. sd. per bushel
(c.i.f. and e.), as compared with 4s. to 4s. 3d. for new season’s local
wheat, although 4s. 6d. was paid by Sydney millers for the first parcels
of new wheat. Considering, however, that the prices paid to farmers
the previous season only averaged Is. lOJd.’per bushel, there is no
reason to complain at competitive value of grain introduced duty free.
Flour is in a very similar position. The present quotation is nominally
£lO 10s. to £ll (£1 per ton duty paid), as against £6 10s. a year ago,
so that the import of American flour at a concession of £1 to 1 10s.
on ruling rates can hardly be considered a calamity by the local miller.
Victoria and South Australia will prove light contributors to local
requirements for 1896, so that the advent of American wheat and
flour may be regarded as very opportune.
Dried Fruits.
Notwithstanding the fact that this market has had to exist under
the burden of a 50 per cent, duty in the past, the volume of business
has been very considerable as well as expansive, especially during the
latter part of the year just closing. When it is stated that currants
purchased at 11s. (f.0.b., London) are sold by importers at Ifd. to
and elemes or sultanas, first cost of which is 15s. 6d. and 19s. 3d., are
quoted at 2Jd. to 2Jd. and 2Jd. respectively (duty under the existing
tariff on which is 2d. additional), it will be seen that profits are not
large, and this is considered a good year, as the margin of one eighth of a
penny per pound is about 50 per cent, above the past five years


average. Dates are sold at l|d. as against a cost of 10s. 6d. (f.0.b.,
London), but on the better classes of dessert fruit the margin is slightly
better. It was generally expected that the irrigation schemes which
have been floated at Mildura and elsewhere would have resulted in the
heavy production of colonial dried fruit, but so far the ventures have
not had any appreciable effect on the local market. America has been
the only rival to Southern Europe who may be regarded as having
appropriated any of the Australian trade, and business with the United
States in all kinds of fruits is certainly on the increase.
Pi •eserves .
The reduction in the price of sugar, and the extension of orchard
farms throughout the Colony, has had a direct effect on the import of
jams and preserves, more especially in the better classes of goods,
which have made severe inroads into the volume of business with the
United Kingdom, and with a liberal supply of these goods at ss. per
dozen for reputed 1 lb. tins, and 6s. 6d. for English lipped glass jars,
local manufacturers have a pretty good hold of the trade. What
importation is done lies between Tasmania and Victoria, with a
moderate contribution from South Australia, and the balance from the
United Kingdom, while the bulk of exports go to Queensland and the
Pacific Islands.
Oil-stores.
The import of pickles and condiments has suffered with increased
-A- A # «
local production of a better article at a lower price, while potted meats
have been slightly influenced in a similar manner. The extension of
dairy farming has had no visible effect on the importation of condensed
milk, for which there is an ever-increasing demand, especially in the
droughty areas of this and the northern colony. Several efforts have
been made to produce this article locally, but, on the principle “ that the
imported article must be the best/’ consumers have not taken kindly to
the local production, notwithstanding its superior quality and lower
price, which is ss. 9d. per dozen, as against 6s. 3d. for the imported
article (Id. per Tb. duty paid). It is worthy of note that a large quan-
tity of pickles and sauces are put up locally, which are represented
as English, or Eastern pack, and the attractive get-up of these goods
has given them extensive sale. ISIo doubt the advent of freetrade will
have a salutary effect on trade in these items. Despite such unde-
sirable competition, the import of reputable brands of condiments
has held its own fairly well, and for pickles worth from ss. to (say) 6s.
per dozen laid down cost there is an active demand. Business in
starch has been chiefly confined to the United Kingdom and the
Continent, on a basis of about £25 per ton cost. Local manufacture
has not been attended with much success, although a good deal of
cornflour has been produced on the spot. America, England, and the
southern colonies have contributed liberally to the supply of fancy
and special kinds of soap, in addition to extensive manufactures of
commoner descriptions on the spot, so that prices have been pretty well
levelled to their present limit of 12s. 6d. to 13s. per cwt. for the latter.
Preserved fish, especially tinned varieties, have had a good deal of


attention, witli an increasing* demand for American goods. The con-
sumption of canned salmon in Australia is about 60,000 cases per
annum, of which 20,000 are taken by Sydney and 25,000 by Melbourne.
Prices this month (December) have reached the satisfactory level of
ss. 6d. for pink, Gs. for red Alaska, and 7s. for Skeena (Id. per
lb. duty paid). Cheap sardines have also been scarce and in request
at 2s. 9d. for quarters. Demands for these goods have, on the whole,
fallen off owing to the lighter observance of the Lenten period, com-
bined with the cheapness of other classes of goods and the larger
supply of fresh fish from our local waters, as well as from New Zealand
and America, which has largely affected the EurojDean trade.
Oil and Kerosene.
English brands of linseed oil have had to meet strong competition
with Calcutta. The present position is, as compared with £l9 10s. per
ton (f.0.b., London), 2s. 6d. per gallon for English andt 2s. 4d. for
Indian (each half and half raw and boiled). Castor, China and other
kinds are on a parity of value ruling in the East, although more often
than not they are below the level of the ever-shifting markets at
producing centres. The kerosene market has been mainly at the bid
of the American Standard Oil Company and American speculators,
while local manufactures from shale have had trifling attention at
about 2d. a gallon under imported oil. Even protected to the extent
of 6d. per gallon, the manufacture of kerosene has not paid except in
the matter of by-products. The local market being supplied by sailing
ships from New York, provides ample opportunity for local speculation
with the 40,000 or 50,000 cases generally held in bond, but the results
are not as satisfactory to importers as might be expected, owing to the
large number of small holders who keep prices at bed-rock levels.
Candles.
It is a remarkable fact that antipodean manufacturers absorb our
tallow staple, and return in the form of candles at lower prices
than they can be manufactured for on the spot, and this is even more
to be wondered at when it is known that local makers of these goods
have laid down the most costly and perfect machinery and plant known
to the trade, but without effect so far as competitive prices with Ger-
many are concerned, although the colonial article leaves nothing
to be desired either in quality, appearance, firmness, or illuminating*
power. Prices for the better grades of local stearine candles range
from about to s|d., as against 4|d. in bond or 6|d. duty paid
for the best imported kinds. A large number of inferior goods are put
up on the spot, selling as low as 3|d. Germany, both direct and
through London is by far the largest contributor to this ColonyN
requirements, although, as will be seen above, Victoria and South
Australia lend a good deal to our imports. The extension of the use
of g*as, electric light, and kerosene, and the low charges for these fuels
and illuminants, have considerably curtailed the demand for candles,
and during the past two or three years especially the falling off in
trade has been very pronounced.


Metals and Hardware .
There is no department of trade which has shown such a satisfactory
response to improved cost as that of metals. For some years until the
middle of that just closing the hardware trade of this Colony, in common
with that of Australia, was in a most deplorable condition. Small
demand, keen competition, and sacrificial prices often prompted by
financial straits, were few of the many drawbacks the larger and
sounder import houses had to contend with, and the losses made were
very considerable. The present year has led the hardware trade to
fresh pastures however, and the general character of business has been
most encouraging. Unfortunately stocks have run down so low as to
give merchants very little opportunity of recovering much advantage
from old low-level cost prices; on the whole, however, the position
is very cheering, and this department of the import market has never
been in such a satisfactory condition to welcome the return of freetrade
as at the present. Some items have shown results far beyond expec-
tations ; barbed wire, for instance, has improved to the extent of fully
£3 10s. per ton, the present price being £l4 per ton in bond. America
has quite distanced English and German competitors in the supply of
this article, and on all hands the American product has been pro-
nounced superior alike in quality, finish, general utility, and price.
Germany has retained the largest share of business in fencing wire
owing to the lower prices demanded as compared with English
manufactures, notwithstanding the efforts of British makers to intro-
duce “rolled” as a substitute for “annealed steel drawn” wire.
Continental manufacturers have also made a strong bid for the supply
of baling hoops, both black and galvanised. Spot values for these lines,
although greatly improved, are not yet up to a very profitable standard,
as the present ruling quotation of £7 7s. 6d. for No. 8 and £7 12s. 6d.
for No. 10 fencing wire is fully ss. under laid down cost. The
same state of things prevails with galvanised iron, ordinary brands of
which are worth £l5 to £l5 ss. in bond, although stocks could not be
replenished at the price. Iron bars, plates, and sheets, tees, angles, and
the like, have found increasing demand at higher prices. Stocks of
nails, Muntz metal, zinc, and similar lines have become so completely
skeletonised that there is every reason to believe that in spite of the
higher range of values ruling the import of these lines will show rapid
expansion. Tinplates, too have run up to 13s. as their high-water mark,
and anything above 12s. is regarded as a certainty for some time to
come. Operations in this line are pretty extensive, and imports are
valued at £60,000 per annum. America has proved a lion in the path
of English and Continental manufacturers of tools of trade and general
ironmongery so far as this Colony is concerned, as will be seen by the
figures given above. In the colonies “lightness combined with
strength” seems to be the great desideratum in this class of goods,
and the “ Utili Dulci ” trade-mark, which American goods seem to bear,
has threatened to completely displace the more familiar wares of con-
servative English manufactures, or the common-place goods purporting
to be “ made in Germany.” In this connection too Continental manufac-
turers have not been slow to adopt the names of English manufacturing
centres to furnish their goods with a passport to Australian consumers.


Trade in tools and hardware is certainly inclining towards the United
States, and with the increasing communication with that busy manu-
facturing world the older channels seem likely to become neglected.
Leather.
Notwithstanding the important place this and the northern colony
hold in the export of hides (and recent operations have been on an
increased scale), the local tanneries have failed to grow independent
of the outside world. Here again the American manufacturer asserts
himself strongly, yieing with the English market for the supply of
our wants, which he does by one-third. With an export of three
times that of our imports, it is almost a wonder that we should require
to approach foreign markets, but no doubt time will effect a great
revolution in this particular, as already the local manufacture of
leather goods has become an important industry, so much so that
some of our factories boast of the most modernised appliances in the
world.
Soft Goods.
Reference has already been made to the distribution of the imports
of this most important class of manufactures, contributing as it does
about one-fifth of the entire revenue of the Colony. The volume of
imports has been practically untouched by local manufacture, and even
the most optimistic forecast of the manufacturer cannot bring within
measureable distance the establishment of self-supporting industries
for the absorption of the bulk of our great wool staple locally. Mean-
time, the supply is practically in the hands of English and foreign
houses, and the variety and extent of the requirements of this Colony,
as well as the demands made upon its stocks from other consumers, are
such as to encourage the importer to believe that in spite of the retail
character of the distributing trade, this Colony has an immense future
before it, and one which gives promise of placing the port of Sydney
at the head of the list of commercial centres south of the line, not
only in the import and distribution of soft goods, but in all manu-
factures which are inseparable from the extension and progress of
civilisation.
Import Charges.
Costs incidental to import form an important factor in the import
trade, and one which cannot fail to have the closest attention of both
importers and producers or manufacturers at sources of supply. The
Australian trade presents peculiar advantages in the matter of freight
at the opening of the wool season, when bottoms can be secured at
English berths at 50 per cent, or even greater reductions on current
rates. This was brought under very prominent notice last season when
several outward-bound ships to load wool were supplied with cement
at the rate of about Is. per cask, as against 2s. to 2s. Bd. in the
ordinary course. This is a matter which is worth the closer attention
of English and Continental shippers, and one which would amply
repay investigation. Competitive steam rates have done much towards
reducing' sail freights, indeed so much so at times that fears have been
entertained that the white wing’s of cargo traders will ere long become

extinct in Australian waters. In prospect of tire expansion of trade
with Sydney, however, this calamity to shipping should he averted,
and although a lower range of freights may be paid than in the past,
there is every reason to believe that the actual tonnage required will
be much larger. The charges made at the port of Sydney, although
lower than at either of the sister colonies, are now having a good
deal of attention, and the probabilities lie in the direction of lower rates.
The present tonnage charges are 4d. per ton in, one payment holding
good for any number of movements in and out for a period of six
months. The pilotage charges are 4d. each way, and £8 for each removal
within the harbour, to which has to be added other importers’ costs,
such as wharfage Is. Bd. per ton dead weight, on the associated
and Government wharfs, and by arrangement on private wharfs.
Goods which may become subjected to “ imperfect entry ” are fre-
quently laden with excessive charges in the matter of wharfage.
Cartage, 2s. per ton. each way in and out of store; commission, 1 per
cent.; discount, 21 per cent.; and exchange about 34 per cent. (60
days) comprise the most important charges attaching to imported goods.
In the case of transhipment the items of wharfage and cartage are
omitted, and that of 2s. per ton lighterage substituted, which is a
distinct advantage to the importer selling for export. Bonding and
store charges are made upon all goods which are not taken immediate
delivery of. The aggregate charges at the port of Sydney are the
lowest imposed at any port in Australia, except Newcastle, where con-
cessions are given in the way of remission of wharfage, which is under
the control of the Government.


Wool Industry.
BY HENRY W. WRIGHT.
Tlie development and prosperity of pastoral enterprise in tlie Aus-
tralasian group of colonies, and particularly in New South Wales, since
the dawn of the present century are not only marvellous in themselves
but without parallel in the history of states. The growth of the cotton
trade in the southern portions of the United States of North America
has undoubtedly been sufficiently remarkable to constitute one of the
principal of the many features of industrial expansion which have
marked the course of the same period; but even that gigantic industry
can show no such stupendous an increase as has been witnessed in the
case of the Australasian wool trade, nor can the pecuniary results
derived from the growing and exportation of the great vegetable textile
fibre in North America be for one moment compared to those which
have accrued from the promotion of wool-producing interests on this
Continent. Born almost with the birth of the mother colony herself*
the national industry —mainly through which it has been possible for
Australia to advance —of producing what may justly be regarded as
the most valuable fibre used in the manufacture of textile fabrics has
gone on expanding decade by decade until for some time past Australia
has stood unrivalled among all the countries of the world for the
quality and quantity of her wool products.
The handful of sheep in this colony a hundred years ago have
given place to countless numbers, which have spread throughout
Australasia and are now approximately estimated at upwards of
121,000,000. This rapid spread of the flocks has fortunately been
accompanied by a no less surprising growth in the colonial wool trade.
Happily truly marvellous advances in the manipulation of raw wool
and other fibres of a like kind, and in the manufacture of textiles
in the old world, have been coincident with the development of pas-
toral enterprise in the southern hemisphere. But for this fact such
phenomenal progress as that witnessed in the Australian wool trade
could scarcely have been possible. The people of these colonies as
a body freely acknowledge the debt of gratitude they owe to those
who first formed flocks of fine-woolled sheep in New South Wales ;
but the good which has either directly or indirectly accrued to these
young countries through the successful efforts of such captains of
industry as Donisthorpe, Lister (now Lord Masham), Isaac Holden,
and others, in Yorkshire and Lancashire, is probably less generally
recognised and is certainly less frequently referred to. It was mainly
through the instrumentality and wonderful ingenuity of these and

contemporary inventors tliat it became possible for tbe manufacturing'
industries to expand with sufficient rapidity to absorb the ever-
increasing supplies of raw material produced in Australia. Not only
has the nineteenth century witnessed almost incredible results in the
way of mechanical invention, but also in the development of inherent
capabilities of taste, and as a consequence, in times of normal trade,
the wool products of this continent have always been in great request,
and the comfort of woollen and worsted wear has been extended to
millions of people who even half a century ago could not have aspired
to its use. At the outset all the wool grown in this colony was
consigned to London for sale, and this method of dealing with the
annual output for long remained the most popular one, notwith-
standing the fact that by its adoption growers practically lost all
control over the disposal of their produce, and had moreover usually
to wait patiently for the best part of a year to elapse before the actual
result of the sale of same became known to them. With the progress
of modern industrial civilisation, and the improvement and extension
of the mechanism of distribution, the isolation of small and remote
communities has long ceased, until to-day, through the medium of
steam and electricity and trade competition, the whole world has
become a neighbourhood so to speak. Nowhere is this more clearly
recognised than in Australia, where, as the tendency of commerce to
draw the producer and consumer into closer relationship with each
other gradually acquired momentum, the old-time system of dealing
with the annual wool clip was completely changed, and large local
markets for the sale of our principal product were successfully estab-
lished. Once the wool-combing machine was brought to perfection,
people in all parts of the world were encouraged by the increasing
supplies of raw material and the facility with which the newest
machinery could be obtained from England to seek to fill their own
requirements in the way of textile fabrics, and were no longer content
to turn to Yorkshire and Lancashire for nearly every stitch of clothing.
On the continent of Europe the development of manufacturing interests
was especially very rapid, and in the race for commercial success and
distinction which followed in the train of the partial shifting of trade
from its old and accustomed channels, the movement in the direction
of acquiring the raw material at the various points of production was
speedily initiated. In having to visit London and buy wool there
Continental users soon found themselves at a great disadvantage as
compared with their English competitors, whose closer proximity to
that entrepot naturally enabled the latter to land their purchases in
the factories at a less cost and in less time than was possible in the
case of wool bought in London for use in the French and German
industrial centres. It gradually became manifest that the only way
for the manufacturers outside the United Kingdom to equalise matters
was to go beyond London and purchase at least a portion of the wool
required at first cost in the colonies. In this way wonderful changes
soon came to pass in the colonial wool trade. French and German
buyers quickly became staunch supporters of the system of selling
wool in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and the operations of a
comparatively few firms speedily forced others to follow suit or content
themselves with running the risk of having to take merely a secondary

position among the textile workers of tire world. Once fairly estab-
the Australian markets grew at a marvellous rate. They came
into existence because they filled a natural want, and the business
now annually transacted in the leading selling centres is on a scale of
such magnitude as to warrant the belief that the time is not far distant
when all the wool grown in Australia will be sold locally, prior to
shipment. Some colonies there are in which markets have not yet
been established ; but notwithstanding this, during the past two years
50 per cent, of the total quantity of wool produced was disposed of on
the spot chiefly to English, Continental,- and American buyers, some
small quantities being purchased for the far East, with which latter
quarter there is a prospect of a large direct trade being done in years
to come. Users have found that by securing the first pick of the clip
each year in Australia, and by making their own freight and insurance
arrangements for their purchases of wool, important economies are
possible ; while from the building up of markets at his door, the grower
has likewise reaped unlooked for advantages. To the latter, the per-
sonal supervision of the sale of his produce, which he is thereby able
to exercise, is no small matter, and the promptness with which the
whole transaction is completed, and the net proceeds of the sale are
made available, is another important consideration. The grower has
also derived great good from being brought into close contact with
his best customers, with whose requirements he thus becomes more
thoroughly familiar. For long past it has been the practice to sell all
the wool dealt with in the Australian markets by public auction, and
for cash before delivery. Public wool sales were inaugurated in Sydney
by Mr. T. S. Mort in the year 1843, at which time the buying was
nearly all done on speculative account, but few purchases being made
for direct shipment to the mills in Europe and America, as at present.
No record of the annual turnover in wool in the Sydney market since
auction sales of that product were first held has been kept; but this is
a matter of small moment, as it is more particularly during the past
decade that the local market has assumed really important dimensions,
and for that period the returns are available and are as follows :

The foregoing figures afford a striking illustration of the growth of
the Sydney wool market, an increase in the sales since season 1888-89
of 100 per cent, being shown. For many years past Sydney has ranked
as the principal wool emporium in Australia, and if there is one thing
more clearly demonstrated than another in connection with the wool
trade here, it is the independence in the long run of this interest of
anything like artificial encouragement. That a locality so naturally
favoured by its geographical position and splendid shipping facilities
as Sydney should year by year accentuate a prominence gradually
gained by the possession of these advantages, is perhaps not so very
surprising; but it must be borne in mind that a very large proportion
—nearly one-third —of all the wool grown in New South Wales still
finds an outlet via the border, and is either sold or shipped from Mel-
bourne or Adelaide. Large quantities of the staple are also owing to
the financial arrangements of growers forced past Sydney every year
to other and less important markets, where higher selling charges are,
moreover, in vogue. Complaints are constantly being made that many
station properties cannot now be worked so as to enable the owners
to properly fulfil financial obligations entered into some years ago, and
pay interest on mortgages; and there can be no question that so long
as the produce of such properties is hauled unnecessary long’ distances,
and saddled with unnecessary intercolonial freightage, the capital
employed will naturally be robbed of no insignificant proportion of
its legitimate due. A cursory glance round the magnificent wool stores
to be found in Sydney will at once show that the commercial principles,
energy, and enterprise, which have already built up a colossal trade in
wool here, such as has no parallel in any other colony, may be relied
upon to accomplish even larger successes in the future than any achieved
in the past.
The relative importance of the Sydney market at the present time will
be most clearly seen by the following returns, which show the quantities
of wool sold in all the Australian markets between Ist July, 1894, and
30th June, 1895 :
The distribution of the foregoing quantities of wool is approximately
estimated as follows : —•


Tlie purchasing power lias at all times kept steadily abreast of tlie
growth of tlie local wool markets, to which large numbers of buyers
flock from all points of the compass with the approach of each wool
season. Many manufacturers now find it to their advantage to be
permanently represented in Sydney, where, in consequence of the
increasing support accorded to the market by Queensland growers,
who shear early, a large business in wool is regularly transacted all
the year round. Undoubtedly the most prominent feature in connection
with the Sydney wool sales is the ever-increasing direct trade done
with Continental users of the staple; and the wonderful development
of industrial enterprise on the Continent of Europe is, probably, largely
due to the foresight exercised by those by whom it is directed in being
so well represented at all the great producing centres of Australasia
and South America. In Yorkshire less disposition to move out of old
grooves has been shown, partly because the coarser varieties of wool,
more peculiarly adapted to the Yorkshire trade, have not hitherto been
largely grown here, and partly because English manufacturers, through
their close proximity to London, derive some advantages oyer their
foreign rivals. "With the industrial centres of the United Kingdom a
large direct trade is, however, done every year, and this will, doubtless,
expand more rapidly in the future than it has done in the past, owing
to the cheapening in transit charges brought about by the building of
the Manchester Ship Canal. Tariff tinkering in the United States
has hitherto formed an insuperable hindrance to the development, on
anything like a satisfactory scale, of reciprocal international trade
between Australia and America; and tne quantity of wool purchased
in Sydney for the latter quarter fluctuates year by year, but, on the
whole, remains comparatively small, notwithstanding the efforts
repeatedly put forth by American users of the staple to obtain a firm
footing in the colonial wool market. The most serious interference to
the progress of the American manufacturer of woollens and worsteds
has come from his cramped and uncertain position, which renders him
utterly unable to compete successfully in the long run with his rivals
in other countries who steadily enjoy free access to the world’s sources
of supply of raw material, and are thus enabled to turn out the soft
and supple goods demanded by modern civilization at reasonable rates.
Fortunately for growers of wool in Australia no class of manufacturers
of such textile fabrics as owe their primary origin to the animal king-
dom can afford to even partially close their doors to the productions
of this Continent, as without them it is impossible to obtain tne best
results, whether it be in the manufacture of articles either of utility
or ornament. Few creatures are there of greater variety than the
genus sheep, and few are so widely scattered over the different parts
of the globe. Coming originally, as there is reason to believe it came,
from the mountain fastnesses of Yv estern Asia the sheep has spread
throughout the world developing distinctive features in different places,
and these local variations, engendered by culture, feed, climatic, and
other causes, have become permanent characteristics. The require-
ments of the present age necessitate the unencumbered use of the fine-
haired descriptions of wool grown so largely and successfully in Aus-
tralia. In this wool the individual fibre embraces not only unequalled
softness, elasticity, brilliancy, and pliability, but possesses formations

more delicate and numerous and witli an irregularity in the free
margin of the scales more distinct than is found in any other variety
of the epidermal covering known as wool. In a word, all the truest
characteristics and best attributes of wool are found in their highest
degree of perfection in the Australian merino. It is not to be expected
that all legislators can ever become thorough masters of the principles
and laws which underlie all the processes and reactions which the
raw material undergoes in its transformation either mechanically
or chemically into the finished condition. Such knowledge is only
imparted by a sound technical education. A slight comparison of
general principles is however sufficient to make it at once obvious to
all who take an intelligent interest in questions of industrial import-
ance that it is impossible for those manufacturers of the woollen and
worsted goods demanded in these times to whom the best facilities for
the selection and comparison of raw materials are denied to take a
foremost position in the industrial ranks.
"While the growth of the Sydney wool market is a matter ot national
pride it is to the Hew South Wales wool export returns that reference
must be made in order to fully appreciate the degree of success attend-
ing sheep farming in the colony, and the extent to which the welfare
of the whole people is dependent upon this great industry. In this con-
nection it is to be regretted that it is impossible to obtain absolutely
reliable data respecting the export of wool for each year right back to
the inception of this important branch of commerce. So far as can be
ascertained, however, the first merchantable parcel of wool exported
from Sydney was shipped in 1807, and consisted of 240 lb. or less than
one bale. The official records date back as far as 1821, and in that
year 172,880 lb. were exported. Twenty years later this quantity was
increased to 8,610,7/5 lb., and in 180 l there were 02,061,829 lb.
shipped. In 1820 the British Government not only removed the duty
on wool received from this colony but remitted the auction duty upon
public sales of Hew South Wales wool. In the same year a gold medal
was offered by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufac-
tures, and Commerce in London for the best two tons of wool from
Hew South Wales delivered in England before February, That
the wool produced in these latitudes early acquired a high position in
the Home market is indicated by the prices realised by the first
exporters of the staple. Public auction sales of colonial wool were
commenced in London in 1820, and a London broker’s catalogue dated
1821 shows that in the latter year 329 bales, ex “ Shipley,” sold as
follows i The Camden Park clip realised from 2s. sd. per lb. to
3s. lOd. Two bales fetched ss. 6d., and one parcel reached 10s. 4d.
per lb. Hannibal Macarthur’s wool sold at from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 10d.;
John Wood’s, from Is. 9d. to 2s. 2d.; W. Howe’s, from 2s. to 2s. 6d.;
Jones, Biley, and Walker’s, from Is. Id. to Is. 9d.; and Berry and
Wolstencraft’s, from Is. Id. to Is. BJd. As against these prices the
cost of carriage was very heavy, and per lb. was up to 1818 the
usual charge for wool shipped from Sydney to London. Some little
time later the rate of freight fell to 3d. per lb., at which figure it
remained stationary for many years. Of the wool now annually pro-
duced in Hew South Wales a large proportion finds an outlet the
border towns, only about 70 per cent, being despatched by way of

a whole during the past thirty-five years can easily be seen by the
following table, compiled by the New South Wales Government
Statistician, in which the weights given represent the actual exports,
washed and greasy wool being taken together ;
In tlie wool trade itself tlie most popular method of ganging tlie
annual output of wool from Hew South Wales and its value is to take
the quantities exported as furnished by the Customs authorities, and
base the total value of the clip on the average value per bale, as ascer-
tained by the actual results obtained for that portion of the clip which
is sold in the Sydney market. Looked at from this point of view, the
position of the industry during the past three years is shown in the
following tables :

Note. —The average value of wool per bale in the Sydney market for the six months
ending 31st December, 1895, is estimated at £lO ss.
Very valuable information respecting the importation of colonial
wool into Europe and America from 1860 to 1894 is furnished by
Messrs. Helmuth, Schwarze, & Co., of London, who supply the fol-
lowing returns, from which the general drift of values may be conveni-
ently ascertained :
In comparing the London average value per bale in the foregoing
returns with the Sydney average previously given regard must b©
paid to the fact that freight and other charges have to be added to


the latter in order to arrive at a fair comparison. In addition to this
some allowance must also he made for the difference in the quality
and condition of the wool dealt with in London and in Sydney.
Large quantities of the more inferior portions of the clip, intended for
salexin the Home market, are scoured prior to shipment, and in this
way the London average value per hale is raised to a point relatively
higher than the Sydney average.
Since 1891 tliere liaye been unmistakable inaications in tlic sneep
returns of our colony that the expanding power of this great centre
of wool production is, at least, for the time-heiug, reaching ns limits.
A reference to the export returns and the actual money-value of same
hrings out no less clearly the unpalatahle fact that tne wooi gioveio
of the colony are now called upon to depasture increased
sheep in order to keep up the gross returns received foi w 001. Loi
can the decrease in the income arising from the sale of surplus sheep
of late years be ignored. It may he urged that a deciease in the
flocks does not necessarily imply a decrease in the quantity of wool
produced ; and that, as a matter of fact, up to tue piesent tmio the
falling off year by year in the number of sheep has not been accom-
panied by a corresponding shortage in the wool export. That, on die
contrary, while the flocks have latterly steadily decreased, the output
of wool has gone on increasing so much so that the 1894-5 clip topped
all its predecessors, and reached the magnificent total of 1,016,500
bales. This is perfectly true ; but, at the same time, a shortage in the
output oi wool for the current statistical year— Ist July, loas, to 30th
June, 1896—as compared with that of the two or three preceding
seasons, is imminent, and while this retrograde mo\ ement is mainly
attributable to the recently prevailing partial drought, it nevertheless
serves to d-isclose the real position of the pastoral situation in Lew
South Wales at the present time. The late drought—lB9s—was not
only partial, but it in no degree equalled many of its forerunners
either in point of severity or duration. Its effects, howevei, have been
sufficiently disastrous to show that, due regard being paid to
present capabilities, nearly all the more important sheep areas oj. the
colony are stocked up to an extent which is nothing snort of perilous, and
to demonstrate with much force the impracticability of xurthei progress
on those lines which have heretofore been most widely adopted. The
cost of production has of late years been reduced to some extent to
meet the shrinkage in wool and sheep values; but the reductions pos-
sible have not been such as to afford anything like ad.equate lelief and
place the profit and loss account of the pastoral industry on a perfectly
satisfactory and healthy basis. At the present stage in the history of
the pastoral and wool industry of New South Wales the question as to
what steps should be taken to ensure future advancement indeed
a very pertinent one. A survey of the past warrants the beLef that
no limit can be placed, on the productive powers of the enoimous aiea
of pasturage contained in this Colony, and yet it is cleai that the
pastoral productiveness of the country is just now being barely main-
tained. Flock-masters themselves may be relied upon to do much to
remedy the existing condition or tilings, an cl prepare the way foi future
prosperity. The skill and genius or breeders are, in an evei-mci easing
number of cases, being brought most successfully to beai in impi oving'

tlie quality and character of tire general flocks; and the remarkable
results attained in several instances, that could be cited if space
permitted, show that in this direction there remains a wide field for
enterprise and perseverance to labour in with the certainty of a rich
reward attending their application. The best sheep are at present
usually found on the larger properties. The contrary should be the
case, and the time is, probably, not far distant when the small flock-
owners, by the aid of subsidiary industries, such as agriculture, smaller
paddocks, and closer attention to breeding, will reverse the position,
and materially assist in augmenting the wool supply. Future progress
would seem, however, to rest mainly upon the successful solution of
the problem as to how to provide a more regular food supply for the
flocks. The results already achieved in the chilling and freezing of
meat leave no room to doubt that any grave difficulties which now
stand in the way of finding a profitable outlet for surplus stock will,
ere long, be removed; but the great fault of the Australian natural
pasture has ever been the irregular nature of the supply. This draw-
back now forms a serious obstacle to further extension, not only in the
sheep-raising industry, but to the proper development of the meat
export trade, from which so much is expected. Fortunately, there
are resources within the Colony which as yet remain almost wholly
undeveloped, and which may, in years to come, enable New South
Wales to accentuate her present pre-eminence as a wool centre. Com-
paratively little has as yet been done to tap the subterranean sources
of water supply known to exist, or to stay the hasty rush of the product
of the thunderstorm to the ocean. The bunds and tanks of Hindostan
and of Mesopotamia are monuments of ancient enterprise
and ingenuity. What was possible to the Assyrians thousands of years
ago should be capable of accomplishment in Australia in times to come.
Money is both cheap and plentiful; but those to whose care the destiny
of this splendid pastoral country is committed will do well to ever bear
in mind that capital is, above all things, timid. The time would seem
to have arrived when producers in New South Wales will have to be
both encouraged and enabled to seek to co-operate more intelligently
with the forces of nature. Progress in the future must inevitably be
slower than it has been in the past; but there is good ground for the
anticipation that with thoroughly sound land legislation, of a nature
that satisfies capitalists, the second century of wool-growing in this
Colony wfill become an epoch of improvement; and certainly no reliable
forecast of the probable sheep-carrying capacity of such a colony as
New South Wales can be made, providing proper attention be bestowed
on irrigation, water conservation, and forest conservancy.


Pastures, Grasses, and Forage Plants.
BY FRED. TURNER, F.L.S., F.R.H.S., &c.
Introduction.
The area of New South Wales is estimated at 310,700 square miles,
or 198,848,000 acres. If the surface covered by rivers, creeks, and
lakes be excluded, the area would be 306,066 square miles or
195,882,150 acres. When it is taken into consideration that the
greater portion of this area is devoted exclusively to grazing and raising
stock, it will be readily understood that the pastures are of consider-
able magnitude. According to Mr. T. A. CoghlaiTs “ Wealth and
Progress of New South Wales for 1894,” the capital value of the
pastoral property, including land, improvements, and plant, as well as
stock, was estimated, in 1894, to be £116,140,000, of which £46,000,000
represented the value of the land, £47,840,000 that of improvements
and plant, and £22,300,000 that of stock. The number of stock at
the close of the year 1894 was approximately as follows : —Sheep,
56,977,270; cattle, 2,465,411; horses, 518,181. The total quantity
and value of the wool produced in, and exported from, New South
Wales in 1894, was 331,774,424 lh, valued at £9,011,790.
An examination of the preceding figures at once shows how important
and valuable the pastoral industry is in this Colony, indeed, it is the
principal source from which the inhabitants derive their greatest
wealth.
The grazing areas of New South Wales may be divided into three
climatic zones. The coastal districts embracing an area of 38,200
square miles, the high tablelands covering’ an area of 84,900 square
miles, and the country lying west of the Dividing Range with an
area of 187,600 square miles. In the coastal districts the herbage, on
most of the grazing areas, is of a rich and varied character, and
provides feed for an immense number of dairy cattle; the dairying*
industry being a very extensive and important one. In other parts of
the Colony, in favourable seasons, dairying’ is also carried on, but to
a much less extent than in the districts just referred to. On a greater
part of the tablelands, the pasturage is, in an ordinary season, of a
rich and varied character, and immense numbers of sheep and cattle
graze and fatten during the summer months in that portion of the
Colony. The western division is, for the most part, devoted to
immense sheep stations. In that portion of the Colony a considerable


percentage of tlie herbage is, on some areas, composed of tire famous
salt-bushes, wliile over nearly tire wliole of tills immense area tliere is
a varied assortment of grass and other herbage of a highly nutritious
character.
The climate of New South Wales, except on some of the higher
portions of the tablelands, where animals require shelter against in-
clement weather that sometimes prevails during winter, admits of stock
of all kinds being left out in the open air the whole year round.
There are few countries of an equal area to New South Wales where
the climate is so favourable and the herbage so suitable and nutritious
for raising and depasturing stock. To give even a synopsis of the
valuable herbage growing in this country would require a very lengthy
treatise. As the space available is limited to a few pages, a popular
description of a few of the best kinds of grass, salt-bush, and other
herbage which are found in varying proportions on the pastoral areas
of this Colony, together with the three accompanying illustrations,
will give an excellent idea of the character of the herbage as a whole.
The descriptions, which will explain the habits and habitats of each
plant, give its economic value and time of seeding, will be as concise
as possible to ensure accuracy. To facilitate reference, the herbage
will be referred to in the order named.
Grasses.
As far as is at present known, there are one hundred and ninety
eight species and thirty three well-defined varieties of grass indigen-
ous to New South Wales. Out of this number there are sixteen
species which, when old, are somewhat dreaded by pastoralists in the
interior on account of their long seed awns, or sharp-pointed seeds or
leaves. This is not a formidable array, it must be admitted; still, of
sufficient importance to make their position felt and disliked by sheep-
owners. Most of these undesirable grasses are really good pasture
plants whilst young, and it is only at the season of ripening* their seeds
that they become troublesome to sheep. The following species are
amongst the best of the native grasses.
Agrostis scahra, Willd. “ Bent grass/' A slender, tufted grass,
growing from 6 inches to 14 feet high, which, together with two other
species of the same genus, forms a considerable percentage of the
herbage in some pastures on the high tablelands, more particularly
in the southern portion of the Colony. During the summer months
these grasses yield a fair amount of rich herbage, which sheep eat
with avidity. The seeds usually ripen during November, December,
and January.
Andropogon affinis, R. Br. A “ Blue grass." A perennial species
usually growing from 1 foot to 2 feet high, and is generally found
in the coastal districts and in the colder parts of the Colony. It grows
on various soils, but it appears to succeed best and yield more herbage
on those of a moderately strong loamy nature. This species is a
valuable pasture grass, and in sheltered situations will make consider-
able growth during the winter months ; therefore, it is doubly valuable


to tlie grazier. All herbivora are remarkably fond of tlie herbage,
and it will stand close and continuous feeding. It makes capital bay,
if cut when in flower. The seeds usually ripen during the summer
months.
Andropogoneriantkoides, F. v. M. Satin heads.” An erect, glauc-
ous, perennial grass, growing from 2to 3 feet high. It is generally
found on the rich plains in the interior, and is capable of withstanding
a long period of dry weather. Under ordinary conditions it produces
a great amount of rich, succulent herbage, which stock of all kinds are
remarkably fond of, and fatten on. It makes capital hay. The seeds
of this grass usually ripen during November and December.
Andropogon sericeus, E. Br. “ Blue grass.” An erect, perennial
species, usually growing from 1 foot to feet high. It is generally
found on good soils oyer a greater portion of the Colony. It is a most
productive grass, and during the summer months yields a bulk of rich,
succulent herbage, much relished by all lierbiyora. The ü blue grass”
is one of the best and most favourably-known of all the native grasses.
In ordinary seasons it perfects a great amount of seed, which usually
ripens during October and November in the interior, but in the coastal
districts and on the tablelands, one month or two months later. Five
other species of Andropogon are found in varying proportions in the
pastures in different parts of the Colony, and all of them are excellent
forag-e grasses.
O o
Anthistiria ciliata, Linn. “ Kangaroo grass.” A perennial grass,
often growing 6 feet high on rich soils. It is found all over the
Colony. In the coastal districts and on the tablelands it is very
plentiful in places, but in the interior it is more sparingly distributed.
It has a wide reputation, and many pastoralists consider it one of the
most useful of the native grasses. Stock of all kinds are fond of it,
and working* horses will keep in good condition when fed on it.
The “kangaroo grass ” makes excellent hay, if cut when the flower
stems first appear. Although this grass develops a number of flower-
ing stems, yet it does not perfect a great amount of seed. What
there is, however, usually ripens during the summer and autumn
months. Two other species of Anthistiria are found in the Colony,
and both of them are excellent pasture grasses. They are peculiar to
the interior.
Astrebla triticoides, F. v. M. “ Mitchell grass.” This perennial
species usually grows from 2 to 3 feet high, and is generally found on
rich soils over nearly the whole of the interior, though not too plenti-
fully. Pastoralists and stockmen hold this grass in high repute, and
it is said that cattle will fatten on its dry, broken stems and leaves.
The seeds, when ripe, are like small grains of wheat, and at one time
formed an important article of food for the aborigines. The variety
lappacea of this grass has ears 6 inches long, resembling large wheat-
ears, which contain a well-developed grain which separates easily from
the chaff. The seeds usually ripen during October, November, and
December. Two other species of Astrebla are found in the interior
of New South Wales, and they are highly prized, both for their
drought-enduring qualities and their fattening properties. All these
species are commonly called <{ Mitchell grasses ” by pastoralists.


G Moristr uncat a, R. Br. cc Star/'’ or “ Windmill grass.” A peren-
nial species, which is generally found growing on the richest of soils
oyer nearly the whole of the Colony. In some situations it grows
3 feet high, with the inflorescence a foot across. In other situations
it grows only from 6 inches to a foot high, with the inflorescence only
4 inches across. In all its varied forms, however, it yields a rich,
succulent herbage, which is much relished by all herbivora, sheep
being particularly fond of it. On loose soils it tillers well, and forms
a good sward. It makes capital hay. The seeds usually ripen in
October and November in the interior; in the coastal districts one
month or two months later, though occasionally in autumn. Two
other species of Clitoris are found in different parts of the Colony,
and form a good percentage of the herbage in some pastures. They
are good forage grasses.
Danthonia robusta , F.v.M. Oat grass.” A perennial species,
found on the southern mountains, where it forms a large per centage
of the alpine herbage. Its stout stems rise from a thick, horizontal
root to a height of 4or 5 feet. It is the largest species of the genus
found in Australia, and forms large patches of rather coarse-looking
herbage; this, however, when young, is rich and succulent, and in
that state is greedily eaten by all herbivora. The seeds usually ripen
during December, January, and February.
Danthonia semiannularis , It. Br. “ Wallaby grass.” A perennial
species found over nearly the whole of the Colony, from the coast to
the far interior. It also grows on some of the high mountain ranges
where snow falls occasionally. It is very variable as regards stature;
on good soils it grows 3 feet high, on those of a poorer description
it rarely exceeds a foot in height. In all its varied forms, however, it
is one of the most nutritious grasses in the Colony, and, unlike most
other species of the genus, will grow more or less all the year round.
It makes splendid hay. In the interior the seeds of this grass usually
ripen in October, but in the coastal districts, and in the colder parts of
the country generally one month or two months later. There are
eight other species of Danthonia, found in different parts of the
Colony, some of them fairly plentifully in many pastures. All of them
are excellent pasture grasses.
Deyeuxia billardieri, Kunth. e( Bent grass.” ■ This species has an
extensive range of growth, being found in the coastal districts and on
most of the high tablelands. It usually grows from 6 to 18 inches
high, according to soil and situation. It is a capital winter and early
spring grass, and on good soils yields a fair amount of rich, succulent
herbage, of which sheep are very fond. It produces a quantity of
seed, which usually ripens in October, November and December. Eight
other species of Deyeuxia are found in the Colony, principally on the
high tablelands, where they form a good percentage of the herbage
on some areas. Only one species {Deyeuxia forsteri, Kunth.) extends to
the interior, where it makes most of its growth during the winter and
early spring months, and is a valuable addition to the pasturage.
Eragrostis brownii, Nees. f<r Love grass.” A perennial species
growing from 1 foot to 4 feet high. There are several varieties of this
excellent grass found in different parts of the Colony, both on rich


and on poor soils. When growing on good land these grasses yield a
great amount of rich, succulent herbage, of which all herbivora are
remarkably fond, and fatten on. The seeds usually ripen during the
summer Twelve other species of are found in the
pastures in varying proportions over nearly the whole of the Colony,
btockmen call certain of them “never fail,” on account of their
drought-enduring qualities. Many of them will withstand a pheno-
menal amount of dry weather, and most of them are excellent pasture
grasses. r
Panicum decamp ositum, R. Br. “Australian millet.” This valu-
able grass is found over nearly the whole of the Colony, from the
coastal districts to the far interior, and in some places it is very
plentiful. In moist places, and by the side of watercourses, this
grass grows 4 feet high, but on the plains it rarely exceeds 2 feet in
icipiit. In all its vaned forms it yields a most valuable herbage
which stock of all kinds are remarkably fond of, and fatten on. ‘ It
makes splendid hay. The seeds usually ripen during the summer and
autumn months. At one time the aborigines used to collect the seeds
111 gieat quantities, grind them between stones, make the meal into
cakes, and use them as an article of food.
Panicum jlavidum, He tz. “Yellow-flowered panick grass.” An
erect, perennial species growing from 1 foot to 3 feet high, and
generally found on the Western plains. On good soils it produces a
great quantity of rich, succulent herbage, which stock of all kinds
are particularly fond of, and it is said to be one of the best fattening
grasses in the interior. It produces an enormous amount of seed ; in
fact, the panicles are often so full and heavy with grain that
weighed down to the ground. The seeds usually ripen during October
and IN ovember. Twenty eight other species of Panicum are found in
tne Colony, and they form a large per centage of the herbage in the
pastures in the coastal districts, on the high table-lands, and in the
interior. Most of them are excellent forage grasses, and are held in
high repute by stockowners.
Pollima j-idva, Benth. “Sugar grass.” A perennial grass which
attains sometimes a height of 4 feet, and is found from the coastal
districts to the far interior. It is much more common, however
in the latter than in the former portion of the Colony. When in
flower the “sugar grass” is easily recognized amongst other herbage
by its rich, brown, silky spikes. It is generally found growino* on the
richest of soils, and often on deep alluvial flats bordering rivers and
cieeks. During the summer months, in an ordinary season, it pro-
duces a_ great bulk of rich, succulent, sweet herbage, which is much
relished by all herbivora. This grass is held in high repute amongst
pastoralists and stockmen. The seeds usually ripen during* ISTovem-
ber and December. &
Sorghum plumosum, Beauv. “Wild sorghum.” This perennial
grass is found principally in the coastal districts, and in the colder
parts of the Colony, where it attains sometimes a height of 5 feet.
In the hew England district it is, when in flower, quite a feature in
tne pastuies, and is regarded as a valuable grass. Horses are said to
eat the seeds with avidity, and to thrive on them. In the colder

portions of tlie Colony the “wild sorghum” is essentially a summer-
growing grass, hut in the warmer parts it grows more or less all the
year round, and during an ordinary season will yield a bulk of valuable
herbage, which the larger herbivora eat with avidity. It makes good
hay if cut when the flower stems first make their appearance. The
seeds ripen during the summer and autumn months. Besides the
species referred to, there are the famous “ early spring grasses,”
(Eriochloa spp.); meadow rice grass,” , B. Br.) ;
“native millets” {Setaria spp.) ; “Mulga grasses” ( Neurachne spp.);
“ tussock grasses” {Poa spp.) ; “ wheat grasses” {Agropyrum spp.) ;
and numerous other valuable species which are found on the pastoral
areas of this Colony.
Salt-hushes.
Yery few plants so useful for forage purposes could exist under
such adverse conditions of drought and heat as do most kinds of the
salt-bush family. There are abundant proofs that when sheep are
depastured in country where plenty of salinous plants are growing
amongst the native grasses, fluke and other distoma diseases are almost
unknown. There are very few plants of the salt-bush family which
are not available for forage purposes, though exception might some-
times be taken to the following species. During protracted droughts
balls of cotton-like substance form on Kochia ophylla , B. Br.,
Enchylsena tomentosa , B. Br., and a few other allied plants. It is
generally supposed that this adventitious growth is caused by some
insect. The fulvous tomentum on some species of Sclerolsena , and
the woolly covering of the fruits of some species of Chenolea, have been
known to kill sheep when, they have partaken too freely of this indi-
gestible stuff, along with parts of the plants. The dorsal spines on
the fruits of all species of Anisacantha often cause some trouble to the
salivary glands of sheep and other small herbivora, if they eat too
greedily of these plants when the fruits are near maturity. Anisacantha
muricata, Moq., when dry, makes the troublesome “ roley poleys ” on
some of the western plains. Altogether there are eighty six species
of salt-bush, arranged under thirteen genera, at present known in this
Colony. Some are found on the littoral sands, but the great majority
grow in the interior, and are remarkable for their drought-enduring*
qualities.
The following species are amongst some of the best of the native
salt-bushes :
i '
Atriplex nummularia, Lindl. “ Bound-leaved salt-bush,” “ Cabbage
bush.” This is a tall-growing shrub, usually attaining a height of
from 6 to 10 feet, though occasionally it may be seen growing
15 or more feet high. It is peculiar to the inland plains, though
it is only moderately plentiful in places where it used to be very
abundant. All kinds of pasture animals eat the succulent stems and
leaves with avidity, and seem to thrive on them. The tender shoots
and leaves make a fairly good table vegetable when cooked and served
in the ordinary way. When allowed to grow undisturbed for a time
the “cabbage bush” produces a great amount of seed which ripens at
different times of the year.

Atriplex semibaccata, B. Br. “ Half-berried salt-bush.” A prostrate-
growings many-brancbed, slender, perennial plant, witli berbaceons
stems spreading 2 feet or more. It is found in many districts from
tlie coast to tbe far interior; it is much more common, liowever, in tlie
latter than in tlie former portion of tlie Colony. On tlie stations in tlie
Lacblan and Darling Elver districts pastoralists bold tbis plant in
bigb esteem and consider it a most valuable berb for sbeep. All
berbivora are remarkably fond of tbe plant, and fatten on it. Tbis
salt-busb bears a great amount of seed, wbicb ripens during tbe
summer and autumn months.
Atriplex vesicaria, Hew. te Bladder salt-busb/* An erect, busby
sbrub, growing about 2 feet bigb, and is found on tbe arid plains in
tbe interior and in some districts very plentifully. It is regarded as
an excellent forage plant, and botb sbeep and cattle thrive well on it,
tbe former particularly so. Tbe bladder salt-busb” produces a
great amount of seed, which ripens during tbe summer and autumn
months.
Thirteen other species of Atriplex are found in varying proportions
on tbe pastoral areas of this Colony, and most of them are excellent
forage plants. Tbe tender shoots and leaves of a number of them are
a good substitute for spinach.
Chenopodium atriplicinum, F.v.M. “ Atriplex-like goosefoot.” A
perennial plant branching freely at tbe base only, tbe numerous stems
usually attaining a height of 1 foot. Tbis plant is peculiar to tbe
arid plains of tbe interior, and in some districts it is fairly plentiful.
It is a capital forage plant, which all berbivora eat with avidity, and
pastoralists look upon it as a valuable and nutritious berb at all seasons.
It bears an abundance of seed, which ripens during tbe summer and
autumn months.
Chenopodium auricomum, Lindl. A “ Blue bush.” An erect-grow-
ing, perennial plant of from 3 to 5 or more feet bigb. It is pecu-
liar to tbe inland plains, though not abundant anywhere. Tbis “blue
bush ” is an excellent forage plant which sbeep and cattle are particu-
larly fond of, and fatten on. The tender shoots and leaves when
cooked make a good table esculent. There are six other species of
Chenopodium found in different parts of the Colony, and most of them
are good forage plants. All of them bear plenty of seed, wbicb ripens
during the summer and autumn months.
Kochia aphylla, R.Br. “ Cotton bush.” A rigid-branched, scrubby
sbrub, growing from 2 to 3 feet bigb, which is found on the western
plains, and in some districts it is very plentiful. Its presence is always
an indication of good country. The “ cotton bush ” will withstand a

phenomenal amount of heat, and grow through the most protracted
drought. During such times it often proves of great value on stations,
and great quantities are cut for fodder. Stock of all descriptions are
remarkably fond of the plant, and thrive on it. It is sometimes given
to stock in the form of chaff, and after it has been cut for a few ciays
it smells like “ new mown hay.” Horses and bullocks are said to
not only work well on this feed, but to fatten on it. Halls of cotton-
like substance sometimes form on this plant, hence stockmen call it
“ cotton bush.” Generally speaking, however, only one shrub in a
thousand is subject to this cottony “gall,” except in very protracted
droughts, when the “ galls ” are more plentiful. These “ galls are
generally supposed to be caused by some insect. The “ cotton bush
produces plenty of seed, which ripens during the summer and autumn
mcpitlis
Kochia pyramidata, Benth. “ Grey Bush.” This shrub usually
grows from 3 to 4 feet high, and is found only in the western country.
It will withstand a phenomenal amount of dry weather, and in adverse
seasons often proves a good stand-by for stock.

There are twelve other species of found in different parts of
the Colony, but principally in the interior. All of them withstand
drought to a marked degree, and in consequence often prove useful as
feed for stock in dry seasons when the more tender herbage is scarce.
Most of them bear plenty of seed, which ripens at different times of
the year.
Bhagodia hastata, R. Br. “ Salt-bush.” A shrubby plant usually
growing' about 3 feet high in a natural state, but under cultivation
attaining a height of from sto 7 feet. It is found in different parts
of the Colony, but principally in the interior. Stock of all kinds eat
this “ salt-bush” with avidity, and thrive well on it. Under ordinary
conditions this plant bears plenty of seed.
Bhagodia parabolica , R. Br. “ Old-man salt-bush. An erect-
growing shrub, usually attaining a height of from oto 10 feet. It is
generally found growing on rich soils in the interior, and sometimes
near swampy places, but not very plentifully. It is a good forage
plant, but is more readily eaten by cattle than by sheep, the foi mer
animals, however, can reach the tall branches much more easily than
the latter. Rabbits eat the bark of this shrub, and grass-hoppers are
particularly fond of its foliage. Five other species of Bhagodia aio
found in different parts of the Colony, irom the coast to the far interior.
All of them are excellent forage plants, and most of them bear an
abundance of seed when allowed to grow undisturbed for a time.


Miscellaneous Herbage .
In addition to the valuable grasses and salt-bushes, there are a num-
ber of herbs and shrubs which grow in varying proportions on the
pastoral areas of this Colony, and provide excellent feed for stock at
nearly all seasons of the year. During seasons of drought the branches
of certain trees are cut, the leaves of which provide feed for a great
many animals. Amongst a number of herbs, shrubs, and trees that
are favourably known to pastoralists and stockmen, the following may
be enumerated as illustrative of the varied character of the vegetation
that is suitable forage for stock : —•
Herbs.
Daucus brachiatus , Sieb. “ Native carrot.” An annual plant with
erect or decumbent, slender or stout, herbaceous stems. It is generally
found on rich soils all over the Colony, but more particularly in the
interior, where it often attains a height of 2or 3 feet. When young,
this plant is exceedingly good forage, which stock of all descrip-
tions are remarkably fond of; sheep particularly so, and they thrive
well on it. The fruits are covered with fine bristles, and when near
maturity are called “carrot burrs” by stockmen. These “burrs”
adhere to the fleece with great tenacity, and it is troublesome to get
them out of the wool. The “ native carrot ” produces plenty of seed,
which usually ripens during the summer and autumn months.
Tetragonia expansa, Murr. “Warngal cabbage.” The decumbent
or prostrate stems of this annual plant often grow to several feet in
length. It has a wide geographical range, being found from the brink
of the ocean to the arid interior, and in some districts it is fairly
plentiful. It is a valuable pasture plant, and in an ordinary season
yields a great amount of succulent herbage, which sheep and cattle
eat with avidity. The “ Warrigal cabbage ”is sometimes grown as a
summer vegetable in gardens, and when properly cooked, it makes a
good table esculent. This plant produces plenty of seed, which ripens
during the summer and autumn months.
Trigonella suavissima , Lindl. “ Scented,” or “ Darling clover.” The
prostrate or ascending stems of this plant are generally from 1 foot
to 3 feet long. It is peculiar to the western country, and in some
districts it is fairly plentiful. When growing on rich soils that are
subject to periodical inundations, it produces a great amount of
herbage, which stock of all descriptions are particularly partial to, and
fatten on. Though this plant grows best, and produces more herbage,
on rich soils, still it is often found growing on stony rises, and in such
situations makes considerable growth, which is a valuable addition to
other herbage. The succulent stems and leaves of the “Darling clover”
make a good table esculent when cooked and served in the ordinary
way. This plant produces an abundance of seed, which usually ripens
during the summer and autumn months.
Besides these, there are “crow’s foot” ( , Nees.);
“ crow’s foot” ( Geranium dissectum, Linn.); “hogweed” (Boerhaavia
diffusa, Linn.) ; “ native mallow ” (Lavatera ; plebeia , Sims) ; “ native
cress” [Blennodia nasturtioides, Benth.); “ native plantain”

oleracea, Linn.) ; and several other plants, which form a good per-
centage of the herbage on some of the pastoral areas of thib Colony.
Shrubs.
Dodonsea attenuate, A. Gunn. “ Hop-bush." A viscid shrub, usually
orowing from 8 to 10 feet high. It is peculiar to the arid western
plains, and in some districts is moderately plentiful, especially on soils
of a sandy nature, and the sand-hills are often covered with it. During
seasons of drought this shrub is a valuable stand-by for stock, and
large quantities are cut down when other feed is scarce. Dodonsea
lobulata, F.v.M., also grows in the interior, and on some stations in
the Lachlan district it is considered one of the best shrubs for forage.
In the early days of settlement the fruits of both these shrubs, as also
of some allied ones, were largely used as a substitute for hops, hence
the common name “ hop bush." These shrubs bear plenty of seed.
Eremophila longifolia , F.v.M. “Kerrigan." A tall, erect shrub
sometimes growing from 10 to 20 feet high. It is peculiar to the
interior, and in some districts it is fairly plentiful. In adverse seasons
it is largely cut down as forage for stock, and cattle and _ sheep eat it
readily. It is said that rabbits eat the bark of this shrub in
preference to the bark of any other tree or shrub. The “berrigan "
oears plenty of fruit, which is eaten by emus, and on this account is
often called “emu bush"; but under this appellation many berry and
drupe-bearing trees and shrubs are known in the interior. Besides
these there are “ butter bush" (Pittosporum phillyrssoides, D’C.) ;
“cassias" (Cassia spp.); “emu-bushes" {Eremophila spp.) ; “rose-
bush" [Eeterode ndronolesefolium, Desf.) ; “silver-bush"
obovatum, Gaud.) ; “ Sturt*s cotton plant ( Grossypium stuitii ,
F.v.M.); and several other shrubs found in different parts of the
Colony.
Trees.
Flindersia maculosa, F.v.M. “ Leopard " or “Spotted tree.** An
ornamental tree of somewhat pendulous habit, and glows to a height
of from 30 to 45 feet. Its trunk is remarkably spotted by the falling
off of the outer bark in patches, hence its common name “ leopard " or
“ spotted tree.** From its trunk and branches large quantities of an
amber-coloured gum of a pleasant flavour exudes, but fai as the
writer is aware, this has never been put to any economic use. During
very dry times, when feed is scarce, this tree is largely cut down and
fed to stock. Sheep are very fond of it, eating both the leaves and
young twigs.
Sterculia diversifolia, G. Don. “Kurrajong.” An exceedingly
ornamental tree often attaining a lieiglit of GO feet on the eastern
slopes of the Dividing Range, and from 20 to 30 or more feet m the
interior. As a rule, when feeding stock on the leaves of this tree,
the branches only are cut off by thoughtful persons, leaving the tiunc
standing, which soon throws out a fresh supply of branches and
leaves, thus providing a supply of fodder for future contingencies.


Cattle and slieep are very fond of the leaves, and they thrive on
them. The roots of the young “ kurrajong” trees, which resemble
turnips in consistency, but are sweeter to the taste, were at one time
used by the aborigines as an article of food. Water in considerable
quantity can also be obtained from them, and this, too, in the driest
of seasons. If the “knrrajong” seeds are roasted, pounded, and
macerated in hot water, and a little sugar added, a capital beverage is
obtained. In addition to these trees, there are the “ belar ”or “ bull-
oak” {Gasuarina glauca, Sieb.); “cattle-bush” [Atalaya Jiemiglauca,
F.v.M.) ; “ Wilga ” ( Geijera parviflora, Lindl.); “Tarren” ( Acacia
aneura , F.v.M.) ; and several others found in the interior.
All the grasses, salt-bushes, and miscellaneous herbage mentioned
in the preceding pages have been figured and fully described in the
writer’s works on the “Indigenous Forage Plants of Australia” and
“ Australian Grasses.”

BY ALEXANDER BRUCE, Chief Inspector of Stock.
Horses.
The number of borses m tli6 Colony since its foundation at tli© dates
liere mentioned was as follows :
Thte larger proportion of our horse stock is to be found in the coastal,
mountainous, and western slopes divisions. Their number is less in
the intermediate division, and much less in the salt bush.
The Draught Dorse. —It was estimated that at Ist January, 1895,
there were in the Colony 153,814 horses of the draught breed, one-fifth
of which may be fairly described as pure breds. If we except the
draught horses in the valleys of the Hawkesbury and Hunter Elvers,
where there were a few representatives of the heavy draught breed, the
draught horses of New South Wales some thirty-five or forty years ago
weremore of the large sized light harness type than of the true draught
horse. They were light, clean legged, active, and hardy, and were
treated and driven like bullocks —six, eight, and ten in a team —their
food while carrying on the roads being only the grass they could get
by the way. Since that time, however, a very great improvement has
taken place in our draught horse by the importation of first-class heavy
draught sires, principally Clydesdales, with a few Shire horses. Of the
active farm-horse type, again, there have been a good many importa-
tions of the Suffolk Punch, which have made a great change for the
better in that class also. And now, our draught horses as a whole will
compare favourably with those in any part of the world, while they arc
much better cared for, and fewer horses do the work and do it better.


Light Harness Horses. —Tlie number of tliis class of liorse was esti-
mated at 133,588, one-tentb of which may be ranked as pure-bred. In
the early days of tbe Colony only a few representatives of this breed
were to be met witli; but within tlie last thirty years, but especially
within the last fifteen, a good many Cleveland entires, some Yorkshire
coaching horses, and American trotters, with a few German coaching
horses, have been introduced, which have brought about a large increase
in the number of the better class of our light harness and coaching
horses, and a considerable improvement in their carriage and action.
The number of ordinary light harness horses has also been increased by
putting light weedy well-bred mares to the Suffolk Punch and smaller
Clydesdales, the result being a light harness horse of a very useful
stamp, but lacking in style and character.
Saddle Hoi 'ses . —It was estimated that our saddle horses at the Ist
January, 1895, numbered 212,636, one-tenth of which may be said to
consist of thoroughbreds and first-class hacks. In the early days of the
Colony our saddle-horses were greatly improved by frequent introduc-
tions of thoroughbreds from England; but the thoroughbred was then
a different stamp of horse from the racehorse of the present day. He
had a great deal more bone and muscle; and in substance and shape
the thoroughbred was a far more suitable sire for producing saddle-
horses than the racehorse now is. A good many high-class Arabs
were also imported, and when put to large well-bred mares they left
some very superior upstanding saddle-horses, fit to carry a man, and
carry him well, day after day perhaps 40 or 50 miles for a fortnight,
with nothing by the way but the natural grasses they had at night, and
at times but little of that. In fact, some forty or fifty years ago our
saddle-horses, taking them as a whole, were among the best, if not the
very best in the world; for it was no uncommon thing then to find
horses which could do a journey of 80, or even a hundred miles in a
day. With the outbreak of the diggings our saddle-horses began to
deteriorate, and from one or other of the following causes: —(1.)
Through the hands on the station leaving and going off to the diggings,
and the horses being neglected. (2.) Through putting draught entires
to the upstanding mares of the saddle breed. (3.) Through the use
of light weedy racing entires. (4.) Through the over supply of horses
of an inferior sort, and the want of a sufficient export trade in horses.
Improvement, or an Export Trade in Light Harness and Saddle-Horses.
Within the last twelve or fifteen years, however, very much more
attention has been paid to the sires used in breeding light harness and
saddle-horses, greater care has been taken in the selection of the mares,
and there have been frequent importations of Norfolk and American
trotters, Irish hunters, and Yorkshire coaching and saddle-horses, and
more recently of the English hackney. With, therefore, such an
excellent climate, and country so well adapted as ours for breeding
light harness and saddle-horses, we may, in the course of the next few
years expect, with proper care, to regain the position we lost, and to be
able to say that if our light harness and saddle-horses are not the best in
the world, no other country can produce better, and at so little expense.
The increased prices which the right stamp of horses of the light
harness and saddle breeds bring in our own market is sufficient to

induce our breeders to persevere in tbe improvement of their studs;
but the very high prices which the really first-class, thoroughly
broken, and well framed light harness and saddle-horses bring in
London, and the reasonable freights now charged on the large cargo
steamers trading between London and Sydney, add very much to this
inducement; and there are good grounds for believing that our
breeders will before long be producing high-class horses of both these
breeds in considerable numbers, and finding a ready sale for them in
London at remunerative prices.

Cattle.
The number of cattle in the Colony since its foundation, at the dates
here mentioned, was as follows : x
The great falling off in the number of the cattle stock from 1801 to
1871 was attributable partly to losses through pleuro-pneumonia, but
principally to owners changing their cattle-runs into sheep-stations.
This was, to some extent, from a dread of the disease, but chiefly because
sheep paid better than cattle. Thus, while the number of cattle at the
31st December, 1894, was only about the same as in 1861, the sheep
during that time have increased from 6,119,169 in 1861 to 56,977,270.
In other words, while in 1894 there were very few more cattle in the
Colony than in 4861, there were more than nine times as many sheep.
£


Still there have been considerable fluctuations in the number of our
cattle during the period mentioned. In the first place, there was a
heavy decrease through the losses from pleuro-pneumonia in the period
between 1861 to 1871. From the latter year, again, through a rise in
the price, the number was fairly maintained till 1881, when it once more
began to decline, with a fall in the price occasioned by a heavy influx
of cattle from Queensland, which up to nearly that time had been
taking considerable numbers from us to stock up new country. This
decrease continued till 1889, since when, through the increase of selec-
tion, and the adoption of the practice now generally followed of running
small lots of cattle in the sheep paddocks, cattle are again gradually
increasing.
General Description of Cattle.
At one time there was a great lack of uniformity in our cattle in
quality and form, and much room for improvement. These defects
were to a large extent attributable to the great variety of breeds from
which they were descended. There is in them more or less of the blood
of almost all our British and Irish breeds, and even of the cattle of the
Cape Colony; and, as if this was not enough of “ differentness, ” a
good many breeders in the early days, under the false notion that such
a course was necessary to the proper management of their herds, kept
up a continual round of changes in their bulls, to the perpetuation of
this incongruity and the deterioration of their cattle. The unenclosed
state of the country and consequent impossibility of keeping the different
breeds separate also tended to check improvement, aided as it was by
the scarcity of labour which followed on the outbreak of the diggings.
Within the last twenty-five or thirty years a great change has taken
place for the better; sounder ideas, too, on the principles of breeding*,
and the really valuable points of the cattle have come to be held j the
runs have been enclosed and subdivided, heifer paddocks have been
formed, and large numbers of pure-bred stock of higher quality, for
which long* prices were paid, have been introduced. The result that
the beef cattle both in this Colony and Queensland will now in ordinary
good seasons compare most favourably with those of any other part of
the world. Nevertheless, our owners have still a good deal to do to be
in a position to carry out a profitable export trade in either live cattle
or beef j and among* other things which will call for their attention, the
following may be mentioned :
(1.) They should continue to increase the early maturity, and
improve the quality of their cattle, and adopt a sound system
of cross-breeding for fattening purposes.
(2.) They should see that their cattle are supplied not only with
sufficient natural pasture, but also, in those portions of the
Colony where tillage can be profitably followed, with such
cultivated food as the lucerne, English, and other grasses and
green crops, so as to become thoroughly prime at an early
age, and furnish a steady supply of prime chilled and frozen
beef for the English and other markets.
(8.) They should de-horn their young stock, and accustom those of
them intended for shipment to being tied up, and to take
cultivated food.


The course here indicated with respect to providing cultivated food
to supplement the natural pasture, must eventually be followed in the
eastern and more temperate portions of the Colony, for it is impossible
that wheat-growing can be profitably carried on year alter year without
manure, that is without stock; and besides, as a rule, it pays better to
consume a large portion of the crops grown on a farm with stock, than
to send the crops to market.
Shorthorns. —Of the different breeds in this Colony the Shorthorns
blood is the most prevalent. By far the larger proportion of the im-
ported cattle have for the last forty or fifty years been of that breed ;
and there is little doubt, considering the improvement which has been
made in the quality of our cattle, that this was the best single breed
that could have been introduced. Here, as in every other part of the
world, the Shorthorns are allowed to be superior to every other breed
in size, squareness, compactness, early maturity, and imposing appear-
ance ; while the pure bulls of this breed possess the power in an eminent
degree of marking their progeny, even when put to inferior cows of
other breeds, and conveying to them the size, substance, and quality
for which they are themselves so justly distinguished. In fact, they
supply the very qualities which colonial cattle generally lack. There
have been repeated and frequent importations of high-class pedigree
Shorthorns from England during the last fifty or sixty years, interrupted
at times by prohibition. In some years as many as 100 head of the
different breeds, principally Shorthorns, were introduced from Great
Britain.
Herefords. —Herefords have proved themselves in Australia to be an
excellent race of cattle, with distinctive type, characteristics, and form,
thoroughly established and capable of being transmitted to any other
races with which they may be interbred. They are especially remark-
able for their weigdit, hardihood, and good meat. They are principally
located to the north of Sydney, in the eastern and north-eastern portions
of the Colony. The importations of Hereford pedigree cattle from
England have also been continuous, more particularly by Air. Beynolds,
of Tocal, whose herd is the oldest established and, it is believed, the
best in the Australian Colonies.
Devons. —Both Devon bulls and cows were imported as early as
1832—3, and their progeny made excellent crosses with the cattle then
in the Colony, both for meat and milk; but they did not gain favour
with stock-owners on account of their wildness. Further importations
were subsequently received, but they also were mixed with and lost in
the general herds ; and it was not till some forty-five to fifty years ago,
when Captain Holder formed a pure Devon herd on the Hunter, which
afterwards passed into the hands of Air. Reynolds of Tocal, that the
Devons came into favour. Regular, though not frequent, importations
of this breed from England have been kept up. When we consider the
good travelling qualities, and the excellence of the meat of the Devons,
there is no doubt they will ere long be found on many of the runs on
the back country ; and as fencing progresses we may expect to
find herds in these outlying districts with Devon cows breeding to
Shorthorn and Hereford bulls, the progeny being’ fattened off and not
bred from.


Black-polled.— lmportations of tlie Black-polled breed liaye at various
times been made, but, as in tire case of tke Devons, they were at first
all but lost in tire general lierd. Within tire last few years, however,
several breeders in this and the neighbouring Colonies have formed
Black-polled herds, principally from importations from New Zealand.,
where the breed is now fully established. As beef cattle, the Black-
polls, whether bred and fattened as pure, or used for crossing with the
Shorthorn, cannot be excelled; and although they are being introduced
by some of our breeders into their herds, this is not taking place so
rapidly as was to be expected. Having been accustomed in breeding
Shorthorns to cut out any that were black or of dark colour, our
breeders are unwisely prejudiced against the Black-polled; but this
prejudice cannot continue in the face of the fact that the Black-polls
and their crosses with the Shorthorn regularly “ top ” the London
market, and that no cattle pay their breeder and fattener so well.
Red-polls. —The Colony is indebted to Mr. Philip Charley, of Belmont,
Richmond, for the introduction of this excellent breed of cattle.
Although they do not carry the same depth of flesh, nor mature so
early, nor make such heavy weights as the Black-polls, their meat is
first-class, and brings very nearly as high a price in the London market.
The Red-polls are also fairly good dairy cattle, and this accounts for
their lightness of flesh as compared with the Black-poll. An addition
of four head from England has recently been made by Mr. B. Osborne,
of Jugiong.
Grosses. —It will be seen from the foregoing statement that the
number of cattle described as crosses is very large, the Shorthorn breed
taking, as it does in all other parts of the world where it obtains
a footing, the premier place among the crosses. There is no doubt that
crosses bred from pure or fairly pure cattle on both the sire’s and dam’s
sides are very profitable stock, especially for fattening; and this our
cattle-breeders have discovered; but unless crossing is carried out in
accordance with the correct rules of breeding, and as far as possible
stopped at the first cross, at any rate in beef cattle, it will not be
attended with success.
The Australian Dairy Ca tt le. —For many years the districts from which
our dairy produce came was from the country on the upper waters of
the Hawkesbury River, and from the farms on the Coast Division, but
principally from Camden, Wollongong, Illawarra, and Ulladulla districts.
Latterly, however, with the introduction of the Laval Separator and
other improved dairying appliances, and the formation of co-operative
dairy factories, for which the country is largely indebted to Mr. Dymock
of Kiama, a paying export trade in dairy produce has been established ;
and not only has the number of our dairy-farmers greatly increased,
but many of our larger cattle-owners in the Coast and Mountainous
Divisions, and even in the next division —the western slopes —who are
within reach of steam carriage, and who formerly devoted their attention
to fattening cattle, have gone extensively into dairying, and find that
dairy produce pays them«better than beef. This industry is bound to
increase, for although extensive tracts of the Colony are well adapted
for grain-growing, the same country is specially so for dairying and
fruit-growing. There are some 384 dairy factories in the Colony,
and their number is being steadily increased, while well-appointed


creameries with, artificial cold, and all the latest improvements in
dairying, are also being established. The output of dairy produce is
yearly on the increase, and large numbers of cattle are required to
improve and maintain the character and strength of our dairy herds.
It was estimated that at the 81st December, 1894, there were 488,211
dairy cows in the Colony, and they principally consisted of what may
be termed the Grade Shorthorn, with not unfrequently a dash of the
Ayrshire, obtained from the early importations of that breed. In some
few instances the herds are almost pure Shorthorns. Of late years,
however, considerable numbers of Ayrshire and some Alderney bulls
have been introduced into what may be termed the Australian dairy
herds with good results, so far as the dairy produce is concerned, though
not as regards the steers. Still, as dairy produce pays better than veal
or beef, the introduction of the pure milking breeds —or, at least, the
breeding of cattle for milk instead of beef —is bound to go on and
increase, especially as our dairymen are coming to see that if they are
to make their business pay, they must go very much more extensively
than they have been doing into providing cultivated food for the cows
during winter. Our dairymen in many parts of the Colony have been
altogether too slow to see and attend to this, and it is not an unusual
thing to find that even in districts in which dairying is the principal
industry only a very few dairymen provide winter food for their cows.
The results are, that the owners have little or no butter to dispose of when
it brings the best price ; their cows, if they have not died of starvation,
are “ bags of bones ” by the end of winter ; and the spring has run into
summer before they are in a condition to give a full yield of good milk.
The Ayrshire , Alderney, and Holstein Breeds. —Although during
the last forty or fifty years several Ayrshire and some Alderney and
other Channel Island cattle were introduced from Great Britain, it is not
more than fifteen or twenty years ago that pure herds of these breeds
were formed in this Colony. Two or three were so about that time,
and several others have been established since, the owners of which have
imported some highly-bred stock of both breeds, but more Ayrshires
than Alderneys. A good many Ayrshires have also been introduced
from New Zealand, where large numbers of Ayrshires of the best types
were imported from Scotland. We have also several representatives
of the Holstein breed, which has such a strong hold in the dairies of
Holland, Germany, and Denmark, but as yet in too few numbers for our
dairymen to know how the breed will be liked.

The Establishment and the Maintenance of our Merino -
growing Industry.
There can be no question whatever that to Captain Macarthur we
owe the establishment of this industry, which has done, and is doing,
and must continue to do so very much for the Colony.


The sources from which, the stud sheep have been drawn from the
time the fine wool industry was initiated by Captain Macarthur —and
that was almost from the foundation of the Colony—may in a general
way be stated as follows :
The Sources from which our Merino Studs have been Drawn.
The Camden Flock. —The first pure-bred merino sheep introduced
into this Colony were the small lot of Spanish merinos- brought from
the Cape of Good Hope —but originally from the Escurial or Royal flock
in Spain —by Captains Waterhouse and Kent in 1797, at the instance
of Captain Macarthur, who asked them, when they were leaving Sydney
for the Cape, to procure provisions for the Colony, to obtain, if they
could, some wool-bearing sheep. Then we had the importations from
the Royal Spanish merinos kept at Kew, in England, usually termed
the ‘'‘'George 111 flock,” by Captain Macarthur, in 1804. From that
date till 1823, there is no definite information on the subject; but we
can gather from the history of some of the leading flocks that, although
most of those who formed pure flocks at that time purchased sheep
from Captain Macarthur, several breeders imported high-class rams
from Germany, and some of them introduced German ewes as well as
1/ / r
rams; while several merinos from the Royal flock at Kew, and a few
of the Rambouillet blood from France, were also imported.
The Mudgeeand MerriwaFlocks. —From 1823 to 1833, although
Captain Macarthur’s Camden flock still held the premier position in the
estimation of the majority of sheep breeders, the flocks of the Hon.
George H. Cox’s grandfather, Mr. William Cox —who had purchased
some of the pure Spanish sheep and their progeny from Captain
Waterhouse —and that of Mr. Riley, of Rabey, which was founded on
high-class imported German sheep, came into very general favour, and
several of the other Mudgee pure flocks also began to be appreciated,
and sheep from them to be in general request. It was during this
period also that the now famous Collaroy flock was founded by Messrs.
Jones and Davidson by the importation of Saxon rams and ewes, to
which some ewes from the Camden flock were added. During the
seventeen years from 1833 to 1850, while the Camden flock had, mainly
through the deterioration of the pasture, brought about by the com-
paratively small area of the country on which the sheep were kept,
and its continuous stocking, lost ground, the Mudgee and Merriwa
flocks, favoured as they were with a better climate, especially for wool-
growing, more extensive pastures, and in the hands of equally able and
experienced breeders, gained in position and favour, and the majority
of our sheep-breeders then began to get their stud sheep from the flocks
in these districts. During that interval there w r ere several German and
Rambouillet sheep introduced.
Mudgee, Merriwa, Riverina,Victorian, and South Australian Flocks.
—From 1850 to 1870 there were only a few importations of German
sheep, and fewer still of French; and it may be said as regards the
central, the northern, the north-eastern, and the eastern portions of
the Colony, almost all the breeders went to Mudgee or Merriwa for
their stud sheep. They did so also to a considerable extent in River-
ina ; but during that time there were several local flocks in that

portion of tlie Colony —such, as Wanganella—of very liigli merit,, from
which a good many of tire breeders there drew their stud rams, while
a few introduced Victorian blood. In the extreme south-western
portions of Riverina again, and in the middle and lower Darling
country, South Australian rams were generally used.
The Tasmanian, Mudgee, Merriwa, Riverina, Victorian, and South
Australian Flocks. —Early in the seventies, our breeders began to intro-
duce Tasmanian merino rams, which, while most of them had Camden
blood as a foundation, were very largely descended from imported
German sheep. So well did these rams mate with our own ewes, that
they were afterwards brought over in large numbers, and in 1875 sales
of stud sheep, principally Tasmanian, were established by Messrs.
Mort & Co., and have continued ever since, at which as many as 3,000
Tasmanian sheep, with perhaps, 300 or 400 bred in this Colony, and, say,
100 from Queensland, Victoria, and South Australia, were sold annually
in Sydney. Latterly the number of sheep brought to these sales has
greatly increased —in 1894 some 9,000 were offered through the intro-
duction of large numbers of the different long-woolled or English breeds
from New Zealand, and some from Victoria and Tasmania. This increase
is partly due, also, to an increase in the number of merino, stud, and
flock rams now offered at these sales by breeders in this Colony.
The American Merino. —Some twenty-five or thirty years ago several
American merinos were imported into this colony, but with the excep-
tion of one ram which was used in Riverina they failed to find favour
with our breeders. About 1881, however, a few first-class rams of this
breed were brought from America by the Messrs. McEarland, of
Barooga, which they put to properly selected Australian ewes with
excellent results. This led to American sheep being imported in con-
siderable numbers; and so far as regards increased density and yolk,
and heavier and better covering, there is no doubt they improved our
sheep. They are also straighter on the back and shorter on the leg,
but they are often sharp on the shoulder and narrower in the chest,
which shows they are less robust than the Australian merino. It is
questionable, therefore, considering the comparative harshness and
roughness of the wool in many of the American sheep, whether, notwith-
standing the increased weight of fleece which the get of the American
sheep give, their introduction in a large and general way would be
advantageous, and whether their use should not be confined to men who
are acknowledged breeders and can engraft the desirable qualities of
these sheep on their flocks without introducing the undesirable.
The Victorian Merino. —The Victorian merinos have also on several
occasions been introduced into this Colony; but although it would be
to the advantage of our sheep-breeders if they could engraft the
brightness, softness, and high combing qualities of the best flocks in
the western portions of that Colony on their own, it has been found
from experience that these Victorian sheep do not maintain their
character with us, and, except, perhaps, in a few instances in Riverina
they are not now used in this Colony.
The South Australian Merino. —It is different with respect to the
South Australian studs. Considerable numbers of them are annually
purchased by our sheep-owners for their stations on the Darling, and

in the western portions of the Colony, for which they are well adapted,
being of the strong merino combing type, with good sized carcase,
and carrying a fleece of very saleable wool.
The Queensland Merino. —Some excellent stud merino sheep have
also been brought to our sales from Queensland, where several of the
breeders have for many years maintained pure bred stud flocks of high
merit.
The Present Sources of Supply of Stud Sheep.
The merino stud rams required by breeders in this Colony now come
principally from Tasmania, Mudgee, Merriwa, and Eiverina; but of late
years several other breeders of this class of sheep in New South Wales
have made steady progress in improving their position, and their sheep
have taken good places on the show-ground and at the sales. This, in
many instances, is largely due to the introduction of the American
merino which has taken place since 1883, and which still continues, and
there is no question as to the success of that blood at the show-yard
whatever the ultimate effect of its introduction on the stamina and
constitution oft the sheep and the quality and price of the wool may be.
We are still also receiving some merino stud sheep of high quality
from Queensland at our annual sales; and our sheep-owners in the
western and south-western portions of the Colony as a rule continue
to obtain their studs from South Australia.
So far, again, as regards our flock rams, a good many of them also
come from Tasmania, but the majority of that class of sheep are bred
in the Colony.
Progress and Future Prospects of the Wool-growing Industry.
The number of sheep in the Colony at the dates here mentioned was
as follows :
*ln 1851 the separation of Victoria took place, and involved the loss of more than 6,000,000 sheep ; while
in 1860 Queensland became a separate Colony, which led to another large reduction in the number of sheep
in this Colony, and these losses account for the heavy decrease in the number of the sheep returned for 1861.
It will be seen from tbe foregoing statement tbat from 1861 to 1891
there was a large, and, upon the whole, a steady increase in the number
of our sheep, principally because our stock-owners found that sheep
running at large in paddocks, instead of being shepherded, paid very
much better than cattle. This C( turning out,” as it is termed, of the
sheep led to a radical change in station management, which commenced
in this Colony about the end of the sixties. The runs were enclosed
and subdivided, and better provision was made for water by putting
down additional wells and constructing more dams and tanks. In these
ways the carrying capacity of the runs was increased by at least one-
third ; the expense of working the improved runs was reduced by one-
half ; the sheep were healthier; the fleece was better, both as regards
equality and weight; and owners, instead of having the greater part of

tlieir time taken up in tke management of large numbers of sbepberds
and hut-keepers, could then devote the necessary portion of it to the
improvement of their runs and sheep.
Since 1891 the increase in the number of sheep has stopped, and
last year (1894) there were about 5,000,000 less sheep than in 1891.
This has arisen from several causes, of which the following are the
principal:—
1. The carrying capacity of the runs in the present state of their
improvement had been more than reached.
2. The system of breeding for numbers and wool, and selling
breeding and store sheep, had ceased to pay, as the Queens-
land markets had practically closed through the increase of
the sheep in that Colony.
3. Through the fall in the price of wool and the want of an export
trade in mutton.
4. The uncertainty and high cost of labour.
5. The prevalence of the rabbit pest.
6. The comparatively high rents charged for Crown lands, con-
sidering the uncertainty of the seasons and the very low prices
of mutton and wool.
As to the probability of our sheep once more increasing, that can
be only looked for, to any great extent, if the rise which has recently
taken place in the price of wool be maintained; if the long-looked-for
export trade in mutton of an extent at all in proportion to the number
of our sheep be established; if the labour question be put on a satis-
factory footing; if more effective and continued action be taken in
dealing with the rabbits; and if the rents of Crown lands are fixed at
reasonable rates, and sufficient encouragement be given to the Crown
tenants to make improvements, especially by subdividing and clearing
their holdings of scrub and in artesian boring.
If these things take place, then we have a right to expect that
improvements, which are now practically at a standstill throughout the
Colony, will be proceeded with and the carrying capacity of the land
largely increased, especially on the eastern side of the Colony, where
the adoption of a system of supplementing the natural pastures by
cultivated food for the stock is urgently called for, both to make our
fat stock really prime at an early age, and to keep up a steady supply
for export.
Sheep in the Australasian Colonies.
As will be seen by the following statement, this Colony in 1894
possessed nearly as many sheep as all the other Australasian Colon
— i.e. } about half the sheep in Australasia.


Merino —Combing and Clothing.
Tliere are two principal divisions of merino sheep, “ Combing and
Clothing/’ and the returns show that in this Colony on Ist January
last, out of 56,977,270 merino sheep, 38,429,679 of the whole were
classed as “ Combing,” and 15,641,102 as “Clothing.”
Prior to 1870 a large majority of the merino sheep belonged more
to the “ Clothing ” than the “ Combing” division; but about that time
a change in the manufacture of woollen fabrics took place in the United
Kingdom from clothing to combing.
This of course led to increased demand for combing wool; and as
the change was to the advantage of our sheep-breeders, inasmuch as
it led to a considerable increase in the weight of the fleece, while the
price of the wool was at least maintained, they lost as little time as
possible in making the required change in the sheep. To do so they
introduced merino rams of larger frame, with wool stronger and longer
in the staple, and more of a combing type; and to such an extent has
this change been carried that there is scarcely a flock of any size in
the Colony with the fine and superfine short dense clothing wool which
about 1870 was grown in several parts of the Colony. It is true that
considerably more than one-fourth of the sheep of the Colony are
returned as clothing; but although this is the case, they might,
according to the true distinction between combing and clothing, be
classed as combing, if they possessed the necessary soundness and
elasticity; so that there are much fewer sheep of the true clothing
type in the Colony than the returns show.
The Different Grades of Merino Sheep, and the Country for which
. they are each adapted.
In the returns referred to, the merino sheep in each of the two main
divisions of clothing and combing are given as being of the different
types or grades, i.e., (1) “Fine and Superfine,” (2) “Medium,” and
(3) “Strong;” and as the size of the sheep, speaking in a general
Way, regulates the diameter of the fibre of the wool, it follows that the
“ fine and superfine ” will be the smallest framed sheep, the medium the
next, and “ strong-woolled” the largest.
This, again, speaking of the eastern portion of the Intermediate
division and the Western Slopes and Mountainous, will, if the manage-
ment is correct, be found generally to correspond with the description
of country in which the several types are kept. For instance, on
country where the soil though kindly is light, and the pasture com-
paratively thin, the small framed fine and superfine type of sheep
should be found; where, again, the soil is stronger and more fertile,
and the pasture closer and more nutritious, the next larger sheep of
the medium type should be kept; and when the soil is very good, and
the pasture very nutritious, the largest type of merino, and also the
cross-bred, should be kept. In this way it will be seen that the class
of country, the class of sheep, and type of wool in the portions of the
Colony indicated, to a large extent run on similar lines, where the owner
—as he should do, if he is to make the most of his holding —selects the
class of sheep for which his country is best adapted. Iso sheep-breeder
can expect success if he does not keep this rule constantly in view.


While making tins statement, tke fact is not overlooked that tke
circumstances whick are here mentioned as settling that question can
be altered by the owner supplementing the natural pasture to a greater
or less extent with cultivated food; and this must eventually be done
in the portions of the Colony here alluded to, and especially in those
nearest the seaboard, if we are ever to establish an extensive paying
export trade in meat.
There is an exception, also, to the rule here laid down as regards the
Salt Bush division, because the great heat and dust at times in that
description of country have a much more deteriorating effect on wool
of the fine type than on the strong ; and the owner there finds it more
to his advantage to keep the large-framed, strong-woolled sheep,
whereby he not only obtains a heavier and sounder fleece, but a much
weightier carcase of mutton.
Long-WoolledSheep.
It is scarcely necessary to say that the long-woolled sheep are bred
and kept almost exclusively for crossing purposes. The term f<r Long-
which is generally applied in the colonies to the British
breeds of sheep, is without doubt correct when we compare the length
of staple of even the South Downs, the shortest woolled of these breeds,
with that of the merino. It was at one time the custom with breeders
as well as manufacturers in the old country to divide the sheep and
wool of the British breeds into two classes “ Long-wools ” and “ Short-
wools ”; but as the merinos are really the “ Short-wools/’ they have
lately been known as such; and the term “ Medium-wools 5 ’ is now
generally applied to those breeds of British sheep at one time known
as “ Short-wools/’ The “ Long-wools include the English Leicester,
the Lincoln, the Border Leicester, the Devon, the Cotswold, the
Wensley Dale, the Romney Marsh, and the Roscommon; and the
“ Medium-wools ” include the South, the Shropshire, the Hampshire,
the Suffolk, and the Oxford Downs, together with the Clune Forrest,
the Dorset Horn, the Ryeland, and the Cheviot, and the British and
Merino Cross-breds. As, therefore, it would be likely to lead to con-
fusion if we in these Colonies continued to apply as we now do the
term “ Long-woolled ” to all British sheep, it should be dropped and
the term “ British ” used instead.
Lincolns. —The detailed statement given of the different breeds which
make up the above number of pure bred and {< long-woolled ” sheep
shows that more than half of what are termed Long-woolled Sheep are
Lincoln.—This has arisen principally through the Lincoln cross giving
considerably better returns as regards wool than any of the other British
breeds, while the mutton of the first cross of the Lincoln and merino
is very good, if marketed in prime condition and at an early age; and
this it can be on really good pasture, or with the aid of cultivated
food.
The English Leicester. —The breed with the next largest number of
representatives in the Colony is the English Leicester ; and while the
first cross of this breed and the merino has a good paying fleece, and
the sheep themselves come early to market, the mutton does not bring
the highest price as it carries too much fat and is wanting in red meat.


The Border Leicester. —In 1894 when the last available returns were
made, very few sheep of this breed were to be met with in the Colony;
but since then a considerable number have been introduced from New
Zealand; and as they are hardy, good sized, well shaped sheep with a
comparatively good fleece of saleable wool, and do better on second-class
country than the Lincoln, it is to be expected that they will in many
cases be used by our breeders for crossing with the merino, although
their cross-breds are somewhat short of red meat.
The Romney Marsh. —During the last two or three years several
owners, whose flocks have been suffering from fluke and foot-rot, have
introduced Romney Marsh rams; and they have acted wisely in doing
so, for while the Romney Marsh is an exceptionally hardy sheep, and
will no doubt lessen the number of losses these owners have lately been
sustaining from the cause mentioned, the Romnev Marsh crosses will
clip fairly weighty fleeces of good useful wool, and give a saleable
carcase of, say, 60 lb. of two-year old mutton, if well cared for.
The South Down. —This breed, which has a fair number of represen-
tatives in this Colony, was one of the earliest British breeds introduced;
but although the quality of the mutton of the first cross with the merino
is superior, the shape of the sheep excellent, and its hardness and con-
stitution all that could be desired, the great falling off in the weight
and quality of the wool in the cross has prevented the South Down ram
from coming into anything like general use for crossing purposes. Still
it will pay well to put the South Down rams to cross-bred ewes, especially
the Lincoln and merino cross, to breed lambs for the London market— —
a business in which it is believed an extensive remunerative trade will
before long be established.
Shropshire Downs. —Although the number of sheep of this breed
now in the Colony is small, there is no doubt but it will rapidly
increase; for while the shape of the sheep (a very important consider-
ation in the London market) and the quality of the mutton are very
nearly equal to the South Downs, the Shropshire cross kills heavier,
and the fleece in this cross both weighs more and is more valuable
than the South Downs. Like the South Downs, the Shropshire will
be principally used for breeding' lambs with the first cross ewes got
by rams of some of the British breeds out of merino ewes; but even
with merino ewes the Shropshire ram gets first-class lambs of fair
weight and prime quality.
Cross-hreds.
Previous to 1883 it may be said that it was not practicable to put
either beef or mutton in a fresh state on the London market; but
since that time this has all been changed, and there is not now, nor
has there been for the last ten or twelve years much more risk in placing
fresh beef and mutton on the London market than in shipping tinned
meat, or even wool.
This being the case, sheep-breeders in New Zealand have during
that time been taking advantage of this altered state of things, and
doing a trade in frozen meat, which, taking the relative number of
sheep in the two Colonies, was more than ten or eleven times the


magnitude of that done by our sheep-owners; and they have been
enabled to do so mainly through using British rams, and breeding and
exporting cross-bred sheep.
To show the result of this, it has only to be stated that while sheep-
owners in New Zealand were during the period alluded to making from
15s. to 18s., and sometimes 20s. each for their fat cross-bred two-year old
wethers, and from 1 Os. to 12s. for their fat six-months 5 old lambs, breeders
in this Colony, by clinging to the merino, although in many cases holding
country suitable for cross-breds, have only made from 7s. to 10s. for their
fat three and four-year old wethers, and from ss. to 75., or less, for their
seven to eight-months old fat lambs. During the last few years, how-
ever, with the low price of both merino wool and merino mutton, a good
many of our sheep-owners have introduced British rams into their flocks,
and it is to be expected that many more, where the country and circum-
stances admit, will follow their example, and take to cross-breeding.
When it is remarked that the country has to be suitable for the
large-framed sheep, it must not be thought that this refers only to the
country in which the climate and soil are similar in all respects to
those in New Zealand, where the cross-breds have been such a success,
for we have in this Colony at least three classes of country well adapted
for cross-breds: —•
(1) That in which the natural pastures are very nutritious, and
the water supply ample.
(2) That with the climate and soil like those in New Zealand, well
adapted to the growth of root crops and cultivated grasses.
(3) That in which lucerne is a paying crop; and it is believed
that even in comparatively poor country green crops and other
cultivated food will in many parts of the Colony be eventut
ally grown to supplement the natural pasture, and carry and
“ top off 55 the larger framed sheep; for if the agricultural
settlement is to be a success, a system of mixed farming and
rotation of crops must be adopted.
The production of cultivated food for stock has in some parts of the
Colony been already begun, and will, it is believed, before long be
generally taken up in those districts which are adapted for that
system. This is absolutely necessary if we are ever to establish a
steady paying export trade in chilled and frozen meat. But there is
still another very important reason why this system should in many
localities be adopted. A great deal of the land suitable for cultivation,
situated in the higher and colder portions of the Colony, is in its
natural state unsound, and the sheep there are in many cases afflicted
with fluke, foot-rot, and worms. This arises mainly from the pre-
valence of surface water on a great deal of the best feeding ground in
those portions, and the lack of nutrition in the natural grasses. Cul-
tivation will to a large extent remedy both these evils ; for if it is
properly carried out the land will no longer be, as in many cases it
now is, a breeding ground for fluke and worms, for the winter will no
longer lie upon it, and the cultivated grasses, clovers, and other crops
will not only have sufficient nutrition to keep the stock sound and in
robust health, but will enable their owners to turn off a large share of
them fat and fit for export, which they now find all but impossible.

Diseases in oue Live Stock.
Looking at otlier parts of tire world we can say that the live stock
of the Colony are comparatively free from infections or contagions
disease. Happily snch deadly and costly ailments as glanders, farcy,
rabies, rinderpest, sheep pox, and foot and month disease have never
obtained a footing among onr stock. Stringent measures are adopted
by ns in conjunction with the other Australasian Colonies to prevent
the introduction of such diseases : An effective code of regulations has
been agreed to which is strictly carried out and no stock are introduced
from places outside the Colonies except in terms of these regulations,
which, among other things, provide that no cattle or sheep can be
introduced into Australasia which have not come from Great Britain
or Ireland, and then only when accompanied by certificates that they
had. been repeatedly inspected previous to shipment. On arrival they
are inspected and have to undergo sixty days quarantine before being
allowed to land.
Ho rses. —Our young horses at times suffer from strangles, but usually
of a mild type. In country which is subject to inundations, or where
the ground is wet and unsound, the horses at times become infested with
parasites which bring on what is known as Australian stringhalt, and
also —it is believed —the blindness which attacks them when running
on inundated country in some of the hottest portions of the Colony.
There have been, too, epizootic outbreaks of influenza, but they occurred
at considerable intervals. We have also occasional deaths in horses
from anthrax, and a troublesome horse mange affects the horses in the
northern portions of the coastal division.

Cattle. —Some three or four years ago there were many cases of tuber-
culosis among our cattle, but its true nature has become known, and
owners are by killing and boiling down those showing symptoms of the
disease gradually lessening the number of affected animals. They are
adopting the same course with regard to cancer and actinomycosis
with like results. We have at times outbreaks of pleuro-pneumonia
(mostly traceable to Queensland cattle) which are stamped out by inocu-
lation. There are also occasional losses from blackleg and splenic
apoplexy, but the losses from these ailments are, as a rule, slight.
Sheev. —The diseases which have caused the heaviest losses in sheep
are fluke, worms, and foot-rot, for which owners are now generally apply-
ing the most effective remedies, i.e., surface draining, burning off old
pasture, and giving proper licks and drenches. A few years back a
good many sheep were lost from liver-rot, brought on by a series of
wet seasons ; but this disease has now almost disappeared. The most
deadly disease among our sheep is anthrax, but it is not generally preva-
lent, and is to a large extent kept in check, and it is hoped will be
eventually reduced to a minimum by the system of vaccination intro-
duced by the late Mons. Pasteur, and carried out in the Colony by one
of his pupils, M. Moment, and by Mr. J. A. Gunn, an Australian expert,
who prepares his own vaccine. There has been no scab in the Colony
since 1868, but the sheep suffer from tick, and in a few instances from
lice.


Agriculture.
BY J. L. THOMPSON, Principal of Agricultural College.
Agriculture, wliicli lias been described as “ tlie foundation on which
all civilisation rests,” is one of onr leading industries.
Climate.
Consequent upon tlie remarkably varied climates found in New
Sontb Wales, tlie products of cold, temperate, and sub-tropical
countries can be grown witbin its limits.
For farming purposes we may consider tliree distinct climates —
faj Coastal. —Area, 38,200 square miles ; average annual rainfall,
44*98 indies, varying from 64 inches on the coast to 31*48
at foot of dividing range. The northern portion is sub-
tropical ; chief crops, maize and sugar-cane. From Macleay
Fiver to the south, with a cooler climate, the chief summer
crops are maize, oaten hay, potatoes, lucerne, pumpkins,
melons, grapes, and other fruits; winter crops, wheat, oaten
hay, and potatoes, whilst dairying is largely followed.
(h) Tablelands. —Area, 84,900 square miles; average annual
rainfall, 30*84 inches, varying between 35 inches on the east
to 25 inches on the west. The northern tableland, New
England, grows sugar-beet and general English crops. To
the south wheat is the chief crop, whilst dairying is exten-
sively carried on.
(c) Western Districts. —Area, 187,600 square miles ; rainfall
varying between 21*6 inches at foot of the range and 9
inches west of the Darling. Characterised by dryness, long-
hot summer, cool winter, irregular rainfall, and want of
uniformity in the seasons. Near the range wheat is largely
grown, especially in the Fiverina; lucerne does well,,
exceptionally so under irrigation. The region is eminently
suited for drying fruit, of which many kinds grow luxuriantly;
cost of transport is, however, detrimental to growers.
In surface contour, Eastern Australia may be compared with a
portion of an unturned plate; the ridge representing the dividing
range forming the table-lands, with, outside, the coastal zone, and
inside, the western districts or interior.
History of Agriculture.
The earliest attempt at agriculture in New South Wales was made
by Captain Phillip, who, in 1788, endeavoured to raise wheat and
other crops at Sydney, with but indifferent success. In 1789 James
Fuse started farming at Parramatta. Later attempts were constantly


being made with varying success. In 1791 tliere were 700 acres
under cultivation; in 1792, 1,400 under crop, and 161 cleared. In
1795 Governor Hunter established successful farms on the Hawkes-
bury, 30 miles from Sydney, wheat and maize being the chief crops.
In 1800, 7,677 acres were under cultivation; in 1821, 32,267 ; in
1877, 513,840 ; in 1887, 975,471. For many years agriculture was
confined to the coastal zone and tableland. To-day over 2,000,000
acres are under agricultural operations in all parts of the Colony;
only about O’7 per cent, of the total area of New South Wales being,
however, actually devoted to the growth of agricultural produce. At
present cultivation is secondary to stock-breeding. There is plenty of
good, though variable, land; whilst the crop yields are large when com-
pared with those of other countries. Communication with the central
market, difficult in the past, is improving yearly; and there has been
a steady increase in the surface cleared for future use.
Establishment of the Department of Agriculture.
A new era dawned for agriculture in New South Wales when, in
February, 1890, a Department of Agriculture was established under
Hon. Sydney Smith, M.L.A.; a Director was appointed, and im-
mediate steps were taken to organise and get into working order a
comprehensive scheme of agricultural education, based on the best
points in the systems in vogue in Great Britain, Germany, and the
United States. Since 1890 operations have gradually extended; the
main objects in view being—
1. Dissemination of such information as will be likely to benefit
growers, looking to the position and needs of the different
districts.
2. Introduction of new useful crop plants.
3. Investigation of crop diseases, and recommendation of suitable
measures for relief.
4. Formation of a museum of agricultural products and a library
concerning the industry.
5. To educate farmers by lectures, demonstrations, and experi-
mental farms.
6. To educate young agriculturists in the sciences related to, and
the practice of, the art; by establishment of farm schools and
a central College.
7. To encourage growth of imported products so as to enable us
to supply our own wants.
8. To endeavour to show how to grow good .products, and best
prepare them for the market.
9. To assist in opening up new markets.
To carry out this programme various experts have been appointed,
who advise when required as to the best methods of procedure. An
official organ, The Agricultural Gazette, containing articles dealing
with every branch of agriculture, is published monthly, bringing the
Department into touch with growers ; manuals, dealing with dairying,
forage plants, grasses, and bulletins on various cognate subjects, have
been published and distributed freely.


Hawheshury Agricultural College.
Perhaps the great importance attached to education of the people in
agricultural matters is best evidenced in the establishment of the
TTawkesbury Agricultural College, at Bichmond, 08 miles from
Sydney. Opened in March, 1891 with 25 students, six months later
the number was doubled; and the new building, to be occupied
February, 1896, will accommodate 98. Three thousand acies of bush
land have been converted into a first-class farm, with cultivation
paddocks (600 acres), orchard (30 acres), vineyard (10 acres), mulberry
plantation for silkworm-rearing (10 acres), bee and poultry farm (lo
acres), grass (1,000 acres), the balance being uncleared at present. The
buildings contain lecture halls, chemical and botanical laboratories,
museum, library, offices, houses for principal and resident masters,
each student has a separate bedroom-study and electric light is to
be used throughout. All necessary farm buildings are provided. The
dairy is most complete, and the stock varied. Caipenteimg, black
smithing, farming, orchard, dairy, and other kinds of work are con-
stantly in full swing. The crops are varied and extensive, including
wheat, oats, maize, tobacco, potatoes, sweet potato, pumpkins, melons,
buckwheat, turnips, mangel, and rape. Experimental work is always
going on, and large numbers of economic plants are to be seen
growing. ' The orchard contains stone-fruits, pomes, fig, guava, citrus
fruits, persimmons, and a large vegetable garden. An irrigation
farm of 100 acres is in contemplation. Students take out-door work
and lectures on alternate days ; the latter comprise principles of agri-
culture, agricultural chemistry, botany (including vegetable path-
ology), geology, physics, mechanics, surveying, entomology, farm
book-keeping, veterinary science and practice, arithmetic and English.
The course of study covers two years, and to take a diploma, examina-
tions must be passed in eight subjects the three hist-named being
compulsory, together with practical work and good conduct.
Experimental Farms .
Experimental farms are to be established in every distinct climatic
region in the Colony j at Whgga (southern tableland), Lismoie
(sub-tropical coastal), and Bathurst (central tableland), work has been
commenced j tests are being made as to the best crops and methods of
work for the special district.
The water running from numerous artesian bores, put down by
Government in the western districts —chiefly west of the Darling—-
has been largely made use of for demonstrating possibilities of culti-
vation in the dry interior, 500 miles from the coast, and with
gratifying results ] lucerne, maize, wheat, tobacco, bananas, melons,
pumpkins, stone-fruits, quinces, date palms, poplars, Avillows, and
other plants grow remarkably well, showing that the hot interior,
when water is available, can be made to support a large population.
It may be remarked that, as yet, town sewage and ashpit refuse are
rarely used for irrigation and manurial purposes \ there is gieat room
for the utilisation of this material, properly prepared, as an economical
and useful fertilizer.


In forestry mucli lias been done, by planting and thinning, to improve
the natural forests, a most important matter to the farmer, in equa ising*
the flow of rivers and giving protection from the strong, hot, drying
winds frequently prevalent. The establishment of shelter belts of useful
trees, and new timber-producing areas, must come about in the future.
At Booral, on the Hunter River, a plantation of mulberry trees is in the
hands of an expert appointed to encourage silk production.
The Agricultural Societies, subsidised by Government, have done
good work in stimulating rivalry, and encouraging’ the breeding of
g’ood stock, and the raising’ of first-class products. Conferences are
periodically held for general discussion in matters relating to farming,
orchard, and related industries.
A travelling’ dairy for some years conveyed to dairymen the most
approved methods of butter and cheese making*. National prizes have
been freely offered, and awarded, for the best farms, orchards, pro-
ducts, or new implements; to encourage such a system of cultivation
as will give best results, and improve the general standard of crops,
stock, and holdings alike. This object is being assisted by an effort
now being made to secure correct names for our chief products ; when
we know what we are growing, growers can be advised what to discard
as poor and useless, and every effort made to induce the growth of
varieties suitable both for home consumption and export.
Such, in outline, is the important work initiated for an excellent
purpose. Distinct benefit has undoubtedly been derived from the
work already done; there may be seen in agricultural circles, by such
as are interested, an awakening* to the fact that scientific knowledge
applied to agriculture enables growers the better to meet those, often,
enormous difficulties found in variable seasons, insect and fungus pests,
commercial depression, and such influences as, in the past, have kept
cultivators from realising the maximum of return from a minimum of
labour.
It should not be forgotten that, under the Minister for Education,
instruction is given in agriculture at the Technical College, Sydney,
with such practical lessons as circumstances permit.
The Land.
Total area fit for occupation, about 190,000,000 acres; of this, 22
per cent, is alienated, held by 54,428 owners. The best land is said
to have been already taken up; in the past, however, position with
regard to water was the first consideration. Therp is plenty of good
land suitable for cultivation if water were only available. With
regard to conservation of water, surveys are being made throughout
the districts most requiring it, for the purpose of framing a feasible
scheme; when water is extensively conserved, millions of acres of the
interior will be yielding crops second to none in the world. Several
irrigation colonies have already been commenced, with great prospect
of success ; already 40,000 acres are irrigated by private enterprise.
Most of the available land requires clearing; this costs from 15s.
per acre in sparsely timbered country, up to £BO in the dense forests
of the northern districts; various labour-saving appliances have been
introduced for pulling down trees and extracting stumps.


The system of partially clearing land is sometimes followed ; scrub
and small trees are cut out, large trees being ringbarked. This ac-
celerates the ultimate clearing, for when they become dry they are
easily burned. Meantime the ground is cropped. Such a proceeding
is mostly followed by persons with limited capital, and such country
has not an attractive appearance; moreover, the roots, stumps, and
trees left in render cultivation difficult. Metayage (lessee paying a
share of the produce to lessor, in lieu of a money rent) is carried out
here and there, in some cases with advantage. Direct ownership by
the cultivator is, however, of greatest benefit to him.
Fences of various types are used in subdividing the land; those
most commonly erected being post top-rail and six wires up
to £BO a mile), post and three or four rails, post and five or six wires
(costing as low as £lB per mile where droppers are used for keeping
wires apart, the posts being further apart than usual) ; sometimes logs
are laid dog-leg fashion. Where timber is plentiful fences can be
erected very cheaply. Barbed wire is now largely used, and is invalu-
able for keeping in animals having a tendency to stray.
Chief Crops■ — Cereals.
Wheat is largely cultivated on the tableland and its western slopes.
Area* (1895), 647,483 acres, being much below that of 1894. Bust
prevents its cultivation in the coastal district. Average return for
thirty years, 13*26 bushels per acre, ranging between 4*/5 bushels, in
1889 (a rusty year), and 17*37, 1887. Cost of growing depends on size
of holding. On large farms, with first-class appliances, approximately
15s. 6d. per acre; medium-sized farms, 205.; small, 275. Average
return per acre —if grown for grain, £2 55.; for hay, £o 10s. Excellent
grain is grown ; an average weight of average samples from various
parts of the Colony gives lb. to a bushel. Our production does not
fulfil requirements. There are signs, however, that a great increase
in wheat production will shortly take place. Strong efforts are being
made at Wagga Wagga Experimental Farm, where there are 400
varieties under cultivation, to produce rust-resistant wheats with good,
gluten contents, and with every prospect of success.
Maize. —Area under cultivation, 1894-5, 208,308 acres; average yield
for thirty-three years, 31*5 bushels per acre —higher than that of any
other country. In 1894 we consumed 5,671,827 bushels and imported
46,294 bushels. Oneof our most valuable products, being usedfor a great
variety of purposes —green, as food for dairy stock and pigs and for
silage ; green cobs as a vegetable, either fresh or canned ; dried grain,
or the whole cob ground pith and grain together, for stock food ;
ground as maize-meal for man; starch is extracted from it; whisky
and schnapps are distilled from it; and sugar can be obtained from
the stems. Land is ploughed 7 to 9 inches deep ; seeds (soaked in
copper-sulphate solution as a precaution against smut, or in tar-watei
to keep away birds and vermin) are planted in September and October,
even'later, singly by the Farmer’s Friend Seed Drill about 16 inches
apart, in rows 4 feet apart, manure being dropped by the same
machine; sometimes sown by hand, four to six seeds in a hill, 4 feet 6

tion is constant; as showing the benefit of frequent shallow cultivation

The plant should be left undamaged whilst growing (no tasselling,
topping, or suckering). A rainfall of 30 to 35 inches per annum is
needful, but irrigation gives good results. Harvesting and husking
are done by hand. The stalks are not burned, but are cut up by a
roller fitted with steel blades and ploughed in to rot, returning much
valuable plant-food to the soil. Pests are numerous both in growing
crop and store, weevil, army-worm, and smut being the worst. Cost
of production, exclusive of rent and interest on capital, approximately
£ 4} 2s. per acre ; average return, £5 2s. 6d.
Oats. —This cereal is much neglected. Area (1895) for grain, hay,
and green fodder, 130,481 acres ; average yield of grain for ten years,
20*9 bushels per acre. Chiefly grown for hay; it should be much more
largely grown for grain, as it is the best of all grains for horse-feed.
Barley. —Area, 1894-5, 13,336 acres ; yield, 17*2 bushels per acre.
A sample of malting barley, grown in the Piverina district and for-
warded to England to test its value for malting purposes, was pro-
nounced by Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, Buxton, & Co. “ Of first-class
quality and equal to the best Chilian.” 150 acres are being grown at
the Wagga Wagga Grovernment Farm, in order to further test the
English market.
Bye. —1895, only 1,359 acres sown, yielding 15*2 bushels per acre.
Millets. —1,585 acres of various kinds grown in 1895 for grain and
green food; grain return, 11*2 bushels per acre. Sorghum is almost
entirely grown as green food for cattle, but experience shows that
maize is much better, whilst young or stunted sorghum acts dele-
teriously upon stock.
j ßoot Crops.
Development of the Sugar-beet industry bids fair to put an end to
the necessity for importing sugar (31,245 tons imported in 1891).
Boots grown at Hawkesbury College Farm yielded up to 15*61 per
cent, sugar, whilst others grown on the northern tableland went as
high as 24*75. Land is ploughed deep or subsoiled ; seed, soaked in
rain-water and urine, to hasten germination, sown 16 to 20 lb. per acre
1 inch deep if ground be moist, a little deeper if dry. To obtain roots
from to fb. in weight (the richest in sugar) careful thinning and
after-cultivation are necessary. Care must be taken in manuring, as
freshly-dunged soils tend to decrease quality of the root as a sugar
producer. Boots should be stored, at a temperature of about 50°
Fahr., if inconvenient to extract juice at once. Plant (sufficient to
cope with the produce of a fairly large district) can, however, be laid
down for washing roots, pulping, extracting juice, and evaporating
to a condition carriageable in bags, for £l5O. Approximate cost of


producing 1 acre, £7 125., exclusive of rent and interest on capital.
Average return, 15 tons at, say, 16s. per ton, £l2. Sugar-beet makes
a good rotation crop with cereals and lucerne, clover, or grasses, whilst
the refuse pulp makes excellent stock-food, especially if mixed with
chaff.
Potatoes. —Grown both as winter and summer crop.* Area in 1895,
30,089 acres, yielding an average of 2*83 tons per acre. Sometimes
15 tons are dug per acre. As a field crop, about 15 cwt. seed used
per acre, ploughed under every third furrow ; kainit, superphosphate,
and bone-dust mixed, largely used as a manure; Ito 2 cwt. per acre.
Cost to grow, £5 to £6 per acre; average return, £lO 9s. per acre.
Turnips. —Commonly grown in winter; to 11b seed used per acre,
drilled in with manure. Yield, up to 80 tons per acre.
Mangold. —A valuable heavy yielding crop, coming in when turnips
are nearly done. Cultivation of this and the preceding root is greatly
neglected; they should be extensively grown in a rotation as stock
food.
Various Crops. — Onions, Arrowroot (Canna edulis), Chicory (average
yield, 40J cwt. dried root per acre), Carrots (a useful field crop, good
horse-food) are also grown, but to a very limited extent.
Leguminous Crops.
Lucerne (Medicago sativa), perhaps our best fodder plant, does
remarkably well wherever the natural rainfall is sufficient or irrigation
can be applied; keeps green and luxuriant during hottest months of
summer if roots are within reach of moisture; stands drought well if soil
is deep; frequently yields 7or 8 tons per acre, and as many as eight
cuts in the year, and it will last twelve or fifteen years. By means of
a box apparatus fitted on a wheelbarrow, 35 acres have been sown by
one man in a day. Broadcasting is better than drilling, using about
12 lb. seed per acre. It should not be fed down close the first season,
and the best results are undoubtedly obtained by cutting, and carting
it to the animals. Dodder, its chief enemy, is readily kept in check
by timely eradication. Every stock-owner in the country should grow
it; and as a paddock runs out it could be put under rotation (legumes
improve the ground much more than other plants if ploughed under)
and another paddock laid down. Red Glover and Tares are grown
(largely with rye-grass) for dairy food ; and to assist the former in
setting its seed humble-bees have been introduced from Kew Zealand.
Lentils, Field-peas, Beans, and other pulse crops should be extensively
grown for stock food. Our leguminous crop plants, and many wild
forms, possess root nodules, indicative of the presence of soil bacteria,
now known to extract nitrogen (the most expensive of manures) from
the air and store it in such a ■way as renders it available for the host-
«y
plant.
Sugar-cane. —Productive area in 1895,14,204 acres, confined to north-
east portion of the Colony. Average production, 18'6 tons cane per
acre ; five years ago it was 24 tons. The decrease is largely due to the
prevalence of disease, believed to have been induced by constant crop-

ping of cane witliont change. The Departmental Pathologist diagnoses
the disease as a clogging of the vessels by a gummy substance, the
result of a Bacillus present in the plant. Steps being taken, by
burning diseased plants, improved methods of cultivation, careful rota-
tion, importation of new clean varieties, and raising of seedlings, to
stamp out the disease. Average return per acre, £l2.
Pumpkins and Melons are largely grown as field crops. Average
yield 3| tons, though 20 tons may occasionally be obtained from an
acre. They command a ready sale ; the former largely used as stock
food and as a vegetable, the latter for jam-making and eating fresh.
Tobacco. —Tobacco-growing was attempted in the early days of
settlement, and a few years ago attained some importance ; of late,
however, it has gone out of favour. In 1895, 716 acres yielded 11*4
cwt. per acre (against 4,833 acres in 1889). Mostly grown in small
areas. It requires constant attention to keep it in good condition and
free from insect pests. To revive the industry energetic steps are
being taken, and as good quality of leaf can be grown, there is no
reason why the bulk of our home requirements could not be grown,
and possibly a surplus exported; instead of, as at present, importing
nearly all we require.
J Tons can be grown on the tableland, and, if near towns, the
necessary labour for picking could readily be obtained at reasonable
rates. We imported in 1894, 841,938 lb.
Flax. —Owing to the fall in prices in many kinds of farming produce,
other newer crops should be tried, such, for instance, as linseed flax.
In 1894 we imported various products of this plant to the extent of
£85,832. Yery good samples of seed and fibre have been grown at
the College, Richmond.
Castor Oil does extremely well. gives great variety of
useful products, is very easily grown, thrives everywhere, and con-
sequently is available for the dry interior: it is a good bee-plant, as
also is Buckwheat. There are numerous other useful plants that ought
to be more widely grown, looking to future needs as well as imme-
diate returns; in fibre plants, oil producers, perfume plants, tanning
materials, dyes, starch plants, insecticides (pyrethrum and hellebore
are both largely used here), willows (an inquiry was lately made for
wood from a particular species to the extent of £200), which can be
planted along watercourses, and are useful in a variety of ways. All
shelter trees might be of return-giving kinds.
Other Fodder Plants.
Of our other fodder plants, rape is most useful. We hear of sheeps-
burnet thriving where other plants failed. Lately, a species of Poly-
gonum (sachalinense) has been introduced as a marvel for weight of
crop (80 tons greenstuff per acre) ; so far, however, this, with prickly
comfrey and other belauded inferior plants, has not proved a success.
Of introduced grasses little need be said; certain species are largely
sown for improving pastures in the cooler districts. In warm districts
greater use is being made of tbe native grasses and fodder plants for


the same purpose,, they being accustomed to the climate, and more
likely to do well than the generality of exotic forms, though a few of
the latter thrive almost anywhere. 26,080,814 acres have been ring-
barked (trees killed by cutting through the bark and Cambium layer
with an axe), in order to encourage growth of grass for grazing pur-
poses : over much of this country great improvement would take place
if suitable seed were scattered at seasonable times and paddocks given
a periodical rest: the natural herbage is not allowed time to shed its
seed, owing to country being fully or over stocked. The saving of
seed from good kinds of native grasses would bring in profitable
returns.
Orchard and Garden.
As an adjunct to farming, orchard and garden are too often
neglected. In no district in the Colony need the farmer be without
fruit and vegetables ; all house water could be used for irrigating.
Tree-planting is of much greater importance to farmers than they
generally imagine, and profitable trees might be just as well put in as
unprofitable.
Olives. —We can grow fine olive trees, though only a few exist, at
Camden, Mudgee, and Inverell. At Albury and Wagga and other
places in the Colony, the soil and climate are almost exactly similar to
that at Dookie in Victoria, where I made olive oil that took prizes
wherever shown. There is always a sale for pure olive oil. The trees
might be grown 24 or 30 feet apart in clumps in corners of paddocks,
the land subsoiled 15 to 18 inches deep ; giving beauty, shade, shelter,
and profit. Easily propagated, they grow in any soil except heavy
clay or where wet. Irrigation can be advantageously applied where
the rainfall is short of 30 inches annually. In our hot, dry climate
mulching is necessary. They require pruning, keeping the inside well
open, in order to obtain the best fruit, which is borne on two-year-old
wood only. Many other useful trees could with advantage be planted
round the paddocks or homestead.
Weeds.
Of weeds, native and introduced, we have legions ; the climate suits
them, and, unfortunately, little or no notice is taken of them when
first seen. Where energetic measures are taken to stamp out
the first arrivals little trouble is experienced. Over 250 introduced
species are scattered over the country; some, e.g., prickly pear and
sweet briar, reducing large areas to such a condition that many pounds
per acre must be expended in clearing, possibly for the second time.
Pests.
Fungus pests and noxious insects are numerous; our annual loss
must be hundreds of thousands of pounds, largely preventable. It is
satisfactory, however, to know that the practice of trying by spraying
and other measures to lessen or prevent such evils is rapidly on the
increase. Growers are finding out by experience that it pays to spend
a little money to save crops that would otherwise be lost; and it may


be noted tliat at tlie Agricultural College over eighty lectures (with
suitable practical work) are devoted to this subject during a student A
two years’ residence.
Large numbers of noxious animals are destroyed every year,, whilst,
unfortunately, we have many native plants possessing properties
poisonous to stock.
Stock.
The best farmers’ Sheep, for carcase, is the cross-bred ; for love-lying,
undrained land Romney Marsh should be tried, or a cross between
Merino and Romney Marsh. Merinos are pre-eminently wool-producers.
Our best Dairy .Cattle are Ayrshire, Jersey, and Holstein; for beef,
Shorthorns and Herefords ; for workers, Devons. Other breeds and
crosses, however, give good general-purpose cows. The average yield
is, with separator, 200 lb butter or 500 lb cheese from 500 gallons or
more of milk. The factory system is well established, and dairying-
may be looked upon as one of our most paying industries. Shipments
of dairy produce are now regularly sent to England. Cheese sent
from the Hawkesbury Agricultural College was pronounced by experts
“ equal to the best English Cheddar.” College butter sent to the
British Dairy Farmers’ Association, Islington, was reported by the
Colonial Consignment and Distributing Co. “as being of real choice
quality with fine aroma,” realising 128 s. per cwt. It is satisfactory to
note that this butter was made by a student of the College.
Polled breeds of cattle are coming more into prominence, or dis-
horning is resorted to —a hot iron or caustic potash being applied to
the horn-bud when a few weeks old. The chief advantages lie in the
greater gentleness of manners and security in travelling. It is
unnecessary to house stock in winter except in the cold parts of Hew
South Wales, but shelter should be provided against sun heat. One
very important matter, especially so in a country with variable
seasons and subject to drought, is provision of winter food for dairy
stock, in the shape of ensilage, hay, or green food. Nothing can
surpass the first-named ; any plant that stock will eat, including such
things as spotted thistle, mangold and turnip tops, and all surplus
fodder, can go into the silo. Chaffed maize, cut when the cobs are
fully formed but before they ripen, makes excellent silage.
The chief farm Horses are Clydesdales. Much orcarhd and light
farm work is done by the product of thoroughbred stallions and clean-
legged draught mares. Suffolk Punch is used to a small extent. The
climate is well adapted for horse-breeding, and of late a good trade
has been developed with India in horses for military purposes.
Cleveland Bay or hackney stallions with good-actioned, sound,
medium-sized draught mares should give the stamp of horse required.
Small holders could bring up such horses with advantage, as they
would be much more docile than if reared on a large run.
Pig-breeding and bacon-curing are largely carried on, and make a
profitable industry. When farm produce is low in price, or inferior in
quality, it pays well to fatten pigs for market. Berkshire, Poland-China,
and Tamworth are our chief breeds. Every farmer should keep pigs,
and if in dry-curing, half coarse salt, half sugar, with J oz. saltpetre to
each pound of the mixture be used, a sound, sweet bacon results.
n


Poultry-breeding is largely carried on, both for home consumption
and export. Eggs and birds have been sent to England from the
Agricultural College with great success. A large trade will result if
care be taken that all birds are of the finest quality, large, young, and
regular in size and condition. Indian game are now largely used for
crossing with Dorkings and Houdans. Plymouth Rocks and Brahmas
are also greatly fancied.
Bee-farming is successfully carried on ; the annual yield of honey
being sometimes extraordinarily large, though largely dependent
upon the season.
Future of Agriculture in New South Wales.
Our agriculture must become of greater and greater importance
to us, and probably to Great Britain also, as years go on. Southern
position enables us to market products when northern countries
are lacking, whilst we can produce the very best class of products.
As to future success, much depends on farmers keeping abreast with
the times with regard to crops, methods of growing, use of labour-
saving appliances, harvesting, and packing for the market. Small
farmers are at some disadvantage compared with large owners, but
many minor industries can be carried on concurrently, “ Many a mickle
makes a muckleA A good living' can be made oh the land and a fine
free healthy life enjoyed. In this country land can be obtained on
very reasonable terms, farming operations can be carried on almost
continuously, hay is ready to stack the third or fourth day after cutting,
manures, in many cases, need not be largely used, winter and summer
crops can largely be grown, whilst the mild and varied climate gives
extraordinary variety of crops. Of drawbacks there are many, most
of them surmountable. Notwithstanding difficulties, found wherever
the soil is tilled, there has been an all-round advance in farming the
last few years. Matters are fairly prosperous, and prices, which show
great range of variation during the year, have now an upward tendency.
An export trade in produce is being developed, and cool storage pro-
vided ; water is being conserved, and will be much more largely so as
time goes on; scientific knowledge relating to farming is rapidly
spreading. It is recognised that cultural methods must be improved,
cultivation made more intensive, and only the best class of products
raised; whilst under a good system of rotation and careful husbanding
of resources the soil will improve greatly, resulting in better returns.
Pests must be battled with: America and France have shown that
it pays well to carry on a systematic and persistent war of extermina-
tion. Not the least important point, a careful system of bookkeeping
needs to be followed, “ double entry ” being the most suitable.
When we remember, in the light of the foregoing statements, that
Great Britain alone imports in one year food-stuffs to the value of over
ninety millions sterling; that our own requirements are yearly increas-
ing, whilst we import food-stufis to the extent of over one and a-half
millions; we may safely conclude that there is ample room for expan-
sion of the farming industry, with no need to fear for its future success.


Fruit Culture.
BY ALBERT H. BENSON, Department of Agriculture.
Few parts of tlie world possess greater natural facilities for the pro-
duction of fruit in greater variety tlian tlie Colony of New Soutli Wales.
Owing to tlie extent of country, and the great differences in climate,
ranging from that of the temperate regions on our higher table-lands
to that of the tropics on our north-eastern seaboard, from a moisture
laden atmosphere and a rainfall of over 100 inches per annum to a
dry desiccating air and a rainfall of from 6 to 10 inches per annum,
and with every graduation between these extremes, we are able to grow
every kind of fruit from mangoes to gooseberries, or, leaving out a few
extreme tropical fruits, all the cultivated fruits of the world. Not only
are we able to grow this great variety of fruits, but many of them of
such quality and to such perfection, that they cannot be excelled if
equalled in any other part of the world.
On the north-eastern seaboard of the Colony, we have a climate
and conditions that are almost tropical, and in a few favoured localities
quite tropical. Here the rainfall is heavy —the air is laden with
moisture, and in sheltered positions frosts are almost unknown. The
soil generally is of great natural fertility, and the land in its virgin
state is covered with a dense impenetrable scrub composed of masses
of most luxuriant vegetation with immense trees interspersed. Here
all the fruits of the semi-tropics flourish —the mango, custard apple,
banana, and pine-apple, grow side by side, and the passion-fruit and
guava grow wild, and produce an abundance of the finest fruit without
any cultivation whatever. These fruits spring up every where that
they have a chance iu the scrub, as the fruit is eaten readily by birds,
and the seeds are distributed widely in their castings.
The orange, lemon, and citron, grow here with very little attention,
and though many of the trees are found to be badly infested by scale
insects and other pests owing to an entire lack of attention, there are
in my opinion few districts where they will pay better or where they
can be grown to greater perfection, provided that only the choicest
varieties are planted, and that the trees and orchard are thoroughly
attended to. The common or rough lemon and the citron, grow with-
out the slightest trouble, and it is not at all an uncommon thing to
meet with these fruits growing in the scrub from chance seedlings
producing fruit in abundance, and holding their own against the
indigenous vegetation, thus showing’ the adaptability of citrus fruits
to the soil and climate, and the ease with which they can be grown.
In the central seaboard district, which embraces the Hunter and
its branches on the north, and extends to about Kiama on the south,
we have a large tract of country where the orange and other citrus


fruits still flourish, but where tbe place of tlie tropical fruits of tlie
nortb-eastern seaboard is taken by tlie peach, nectarine, apricot,
oriental plum, pear, early varieties of apples, and several varieties of
plums, as well as table grapes. In this district the soil generally is
of a much poorer character, but with occasional rich tracts of alluvial
land, such as that of the Hunter and Hawkesbury. The rainfall,
though still large, is much less than that of the north-east, and the
conditions are only subtropical. This district is essentially the home
of the peach, as it grows wild wherever the stones are deposited along
the banks of creeks, and anyone who takes a trip up the Hawkesbury
will see numbers of large peach-trees, bearing heavy crops of tine
fruit, that have never been planted, cultivated, or pruned, and that
have been grown from chance peach-stones that have been carried
down and left by floods. When cultivated the peach is very prolific ;
in fact, it is much given to overbearing, as are also plums and apricots,
with the result that the quality of the fruit grown often suffers from
the number that the tree has to bear. Where, however, the trees are
properly attended to, and only allowed to bear as much fruit as they can
bring to perfection, the quality of the fruit is good; grown with an ease
that is probably unsurpassed in any other part of the world. Here the
pear, when once established, is as hardy as a native tree, and large
numbers of old pear-trees can be seen in the neighbourhood of Sydney
which are growing without the slightest attention, and, when not
attacked by the Windsor pear blight, bearing heavy crops of fruit. These
old neglected pear-trees are often of large size, and they usually mark
the site of old orchards from which all other varieties of fruit-trees have
long since disappeared, the pears alone remaining and defying neglect.
This is the oldest fruit-growing district of the Colony, and it
grows fully three-quarters of all the fruit raised, its nearness to
the Sydney market enabling the fruit-growers to readily dispose
of their fruit, as Sydney always has been, and probably will continue
to be, the greatest consuming and distributing market for fruit in the
Colony. Here in the past fruit-growing, when properly carried out,
has been a very paying industry, and many growers have succeeded
in building up comfortable homes and in saving considerable fortunes,
and more money has been made from well-kept orchards, taking into
consideration the amount of land occupied and the capital expended,
than from any other branch of husbandry. How, however, the times
are somewhat changed, owing to the great increase in the production
of fruit, which has been caused by the planting of many new orchards,
not only in Cumberland, but throughout the Colony, and this increase
of production has caused the supply at times to be in excess of the
local demand, so that the markets are glutted, and inferior fruit is
hard to dispose of at any price. Good fruit, however, still meets with
a ready sale, and often at prices that are rarely equalled in other great
fruit-growing centres, as the Sydney market has hitherto been able
to absorb all our first-quality fruit, and is so far the best market for
such fruit. As I purpose dealing* more fully with the disposal and
utilisation of fruit later on, I will pass on to other districts of the
Colony, but before doing so I must say that in many cases fruit-
culture has been carried out in a very slovenly manner in this district.
Though the oldest and largest producing district, it contains at the


same time tlie dirtiest, most neglected, and most diseased orchards in
the Colony, and grows a large proportion of the greatest rubbish,
which is due in a great measure to the prevalence of the insane system
of trying to grow every possible variety of fruit in the same orchard,
instead of confining the attention to the growth of those varieties that
the soil and climate are capable of producing to perfection.
In the table-land districts of the Colony there are large tracts of
country widely separated from each other, but which have a climate
and rainfall that is just suited to the production of the fruits of the
temperate regions, including apples, pears, plums, quinces, cherries,
and all kinds of berry fruits and hardy nuts. In these districts the
winter is more or less severe, snow being not uncommon, and frosts of
frequent occurrence. The summers are generally bright and warm
during the days, but always cool at night, so that though there is
sufficient sun-heat to put plenty of sugar in the fruit, the fruit does
not ripen as rapidly as in warmer or more humid districts, and the fruits
grown possess much greater firmness, and are much better keepers
and shippers. In these table-land districts the rainfall is usually
sufficient for the successful growth of all the fruits adapted to the
climate, but the rainfall is often badly distributed, and there are
longish spells of dry weather, which necessitate the orchards being
kept in a high state of culture in order to obtain the best results. Ho
trees in this district require irrigation, but where berry culture is gone
in for extensively, it will always be advisable to have a supply of
water to fall back upon during a dry spell. Most of the table-land
districts are well supplied with water, and contain numerous running
streams, the water of which could easily be conserved for use in a dry
time, as the hilly nature of the country gives many opportunities,for
the formation of natural reservoirs by damming up gullies, so that,
should water be required for berry culture, there is often little diffi-
culty in conserving it. Apples, pears, plums, and cherries, when
Manted in suitable soils and properly looked after, are usually heavy
bearers in these districts, and the fruits are of firmer texture, higher
colour, better flavour, and better keeping qualities than the same
fruits when grown in other parts of the Colony. Cherries do remark-
ably well in many parts, the red Kentish cherry growing almost wild
and without the slightest cultivation, and yet bearing heavy crops of
fruit; in fact, this variety is such a hardy grower that it is planted in
hedges to form a breakwind or protection for the orchard against the
prevailing winds of the district.
In the central districts of the Colony we have an enormous extent
of country that is suited for fruit-culture but of a totally different
type from that of the districts I have already mentioned. Here
we have a soil and climate that are best adapted to the growth of the
vine, the olive, the fig*, the apricot, the prune, and drying peaches, in
fact, for nearly all varieties of drying fruits. Here the rainfall is much
smaller, the summers hotter and drier, and the winters much milder
than in the table-land districts, but everywhere throughout this dis-
trict, where the rainfall exceeds 20 inches per annum, all the fruits
that I have mentioned can be grown to great perfection without irri-
gation, provided that suitable soil is chosen, and that the right varieties
are planted. Here the success of fruit-culture depends mainly on


thorough cnltiyation and tlie retaining in the soil for tlie use of
as much of the rainfall as possible. On this retaining of moisture in
the soil the whole success of fruit-culture in this district depends,
and the retention of moisture is accomplished by a thorough system
of cultivation. For example, after every rain the surface of the
ground is broken as soon as the land will carry horses without injury;
this prevents the formation of a crust on the surface, as well as of the
capillaries right to the surface, and it is by means of the capillaries,
or rather through them, that heavy surface evaporation takes place,
and consequently dries out the soil. The breaking of the crust after
rain is followed by deeper cultivation, the implements used stirring
but not turning the soil, and if this is continued throughout the dry
time the land will retain all the moisture required for the proper
development of the trees and fruit. In order to show the result of
thorough cultivation in this district, the following illustration will
give some idea of the growth of Muir peaches at the Government
Experimental Farm at Wagga Wagga, sixteen months after planting,
which have been grown in the average soil of the district entirely
without irrigation, but under a system of culture such as I have just
described. During the past winter the trees were pruned back to
within 8 inches of the main trunk, and all the growth shown in the
illustration has been made in sixteen weeks, and during an unusually
dry season. The trees are planted 25 feet apart each way.
The cultivation of the olive both for oil and for pickling is destined
to be a great industry in this district. The tree is a rapid and vigor-
ous grower, cropping heavily and bearing good fruit, and, in addition,
coming into bearing in much less time than it does in Europe; in fact,
the conditions prevailing in this district are, as a whole, much more
favourable to the growth of the olive than the most favoured districts
of Spain, Italy, or Southern France. In addition to the fruits men


tioned, apples and pears, cherries, and citrus fruits in favourable
situations do well, though tbe quality of the pomaceous fruits is not
equal to that of the same fruits when grown in our table-land districts,
and the citrus fruits are inferior to those grown in more suitable
situations ) where cherries will grow they are usually very early and
of large size, but are, as a rule, inferior to the same fruit grown in the
colder districts.
Our dry western country also grows good fruit, but here its suc-
cessful culture depends largely on having water available for irrigation
when necessary. 'With irrigation on suitable land, apricots, peaches,
almonds, figs, grapes, olives, oranges, and lemons can be grown to great
perfection, those varieties of deciduous fruits that dry well being the
most suitable. Oitrus fruits do well, and produce fruit of exceptional
quality ; in fact, I question if finer citrus fruits were ever grown or
seen in Australia than the collection of citrus fruits grown by Lord
Banfurly at Old Mildura and exhibited in Melbourne at the Mildura
Citrus Fair held during August, 1895. Though Old Mildura is not in
New South Wales, it is only separated from it by the river Murray,
and we have many places in our western country that are capable of
producing citrus fruits equal to those grown at Old Mildura.
As artesian water has now been found over a large portion of our
western country, and as there is every reason to believe that the supply
is practically inexhaustible it is impossible to say to what extent fruit-
culture may be carried by its use. This district contains immense
areas of perfect fruit soils that are easily irrigated as they possess
g’ood natural drainage, and respond well to the application of water
when it is properly and judiciously applied. Experimental fruit-
culture is now being carried out by the Department of Agriculture at
Pera Bore, near Bourke, with every prospect of success, and in my
opinion there is practically no limit to the quantity of fruit that this
district is capable of producing under a combined system of irrigation
and thorough cultivation.
I have now dealt with all the different parts of the Colony, and have
endeavoured to show that owing to the wide range ox climate a very
large number of fruits can be grown here successfully. I have also
endeavoured to show the class of fruit that are best adapted to the
different districts, and to give some sligdrt idea of the capabilities and
possibilities of the Colony as a fruit-producing country.
In the early days of the Colony, fruit-culture was looked upon more
as a hobby of the rich than as an industry suitable to the Colony and
capable of supporting a large number of persons, the soil and climate
of the first settled districts being considered unsuitable for fruit-
growing. The trees planted, however, did so well that the cultivation
of fruit soon increased largely in and around the older settled districts
of Cumberland, with the result that the industry often turned out to
be a very profitable one, and many of the growers became comparatively
wealthy men, as the demand for the fruit was in excess of the supply,
and the prices obtained were consequently highly remunerative. The
fruit trade remained in this condition until some ten years ago, since
when the area under fruit-trees has been very largely increased, and
the production of some kinds of fruit is now in excess of the demand,


tlie result being that tlie prices realised, as a whole, are now much
lower than they used to be. It is, however, only inferior fruit that is
over-produced and is unremunerative, as first-qualit}?" fruit always sells
well in our markets, and is easily disposed of at satisfactory prices.
In the past the growers have simply looked to one market, viz., the
market for fresh fruit, and now that this market is occasionally over-
supplied there are many complaints from the growers that the trade is
overdone, and that there is no longer any money in it. How, because
one market happens to be overdone for a short time during the
summer season, that is no reason at all that the industry, as a whole,
is overdone, and anyone who looks at the imports of fruit into this
Colony, both green fruit and preserved fruit, either in the form of
canned fruit, dried fruits, jams, or jellies will see at a glance that we
are still very far from supplying our own requirements, and that there
is still a considerable scope for an increase in the production before
we need to talk much of over-production or have fruits for export.
In the past the fruits grown have usually been those that have pro-
duced the heaviest returns with the least trouble, quality being usually
of secondary consideration; the fruit has been grown simply to supply
the green fruit market, and now that this market is overstocked during’
the height of the season these fruits which are usually valueless for
any other use, should be supplanted by varieties valuable not only for
the green-fruit trade, but, which, if this market is over-supplied may
be utilized by drying, canning, jam-making or otherwise.
Fruit-growing in the future will have to be carried out on totally
different lines from what it has been in the past if our growers intend
to keep even our own markets; and before we can hope to compete in
the world’s markets with any chance of success, and be able to hold
our share of these markets we must grow better fruit than we are
doing at present, and when grown market it in such a manner that it
will be a credit to our Colony, and hold its own on its merits. There
has been an enormous increase in the production of fruit throughout
the world during’ the past ten years, and the following figures, which
I have taken from The Californian Fruit-grower for 21st September,
1895, will give some idea of the immense production of fruit in California
alone, and of the rate at which production is increasing there. In 1894
the following quantities of fruit were shipped from California, viz.:—
Ih.
Fresh fruit .. 179,576,500
Citrus fruit ... ... ... ... ... ... 118,125,300
Dried fruit ... ... ... ... ... ... 103,500,400
Canned fruit.. ... ... ... ... ... 106,125,200
Raisins fruit ... ... ... ... ... ... 94,112,350
Nuts fruit ... ... ... ... ... 7,901,112
Total ... 609,340,862
Which is equal to 25,391 carloads of about 24,000 lb. or 12 tons
American each.
The total shipments in 1890 were only 330,313,900 lb., or only a
little more than half of 1894, so that the output has nearly doubled in
a period of five years, and it is estimated that the gain for the next
five years will be equal to that of that of the period shown. This
enormous increase in the production of fruit is not confined to California
alone, but many other of the United States are becoming heavy fruit


producers as well. The Cape of Good Hope is paying considerable
attention to fruit-culture, and in all the colonies of Australasia the
industry is very much on the increase.
With this very great increase in the production of fruit the only
chance of making fruit-growing pay in the future will be to grow
nothing but the best varieties, and only such as the district is suited
to, and which it will produce to the greatest perfection. If this is
done I believe that we will be able to hold our own markets easily,
and I also believe that it is possible for us to raise fruit of such
quality that even with the great increase in production it will be able
to hold its own in every market. In order to do this the fruit-
growers of the future will have to be a very different individual from
the fruit-grower of the past. He will have to conduct his business on
the strictest commercial lines, and use his brains as well as his hands.
He will have to employ improved methods of culture, systematically
prune and thin his trees, keep his orchard in a state of vigorous health
by the eradication of all insect and fnngus pests, and by the application
of manures when necessary ; grow nothing but the finest fruits that it
is possible to produce, and when he has grown them market them in
the best possible manner. The fruit-growing of the future will be a
science, and no one will make a success of it unless he keeps abreast
of the times, and takes advantage of all the assistance that improved
machinery can give him, as well as of all the information on diseases,
&c., published by scientists in all parts of the world. Fruit-growing
in New South Wales, if properly conducted, will, I believe, have little
to fear from foreign competition, as we possess several advantages
that the older fruit-growing countries do not. In the first place, we
can grow a greater number of fruits to perfection than any other
country of the same size on earth. Secondly, we have a large area of
the best fruit-growing land which is available for fruit-culture at a
very low price. Thirdly, the rainfall over a large portion of the country
adapted for fruit-growing is sufficient for the successful culture of
deciduous fruits without irrigation, provided that the land is kept in a
state of perfect tilth.
Fourthly, our large belt of artesian country with its probably
inexhaustible supply of water, and water that can be utilised with
the least expense, is capable of producing all kinds of drying fruits
at a rate that few countries if any can compete against.
Fifthly, if our growers will lay themselves out to grow the right
kinds of fruit for exporting to Europe, we have a large market for
choice fruits during the European winter when the local fruits are
out of season. Owing to the reverse of the seasons here, their off
season is our harvest, and we can thus supply them with fruit at a
time that there will be little European or North American fruit, save
oranges, on the market, and in the case of citrus fruits, the same rule
applies as our fruits ripen at the time that these fruits are scarcest
in Europe.
Despite the advantages this Colony possesses for the building np
of a big fruit industry, it will depend entirely on the energy of our
growers whether this Colony will take the place that it should in the
fruit production of the world, or whether it will be pushed aside by the
more energetic growers of other countries, who even though they may


be growing fruit under less favourable conditions than those possessed
by onr growers, yet lose no chance to extend their industry, and find
a market for their produce whenever and wherever they can. In onr
own Colony we should endeavour to popularise the consumption of
fruit as much as possible, and this can only be done by supplying the
general public with good fruit at low rates. At present fruit is looked
upon more or less as a luxury, instead of which it should be considered
as an essential part of every meal, as it is nature’s greatest remedy for
keeping the mind and body in vigorous health, it is especially valuable
in a climate like this, and should take the place in a great measure of
the large quantity of animal food consumed by all classes of the
community.
In conclusion, I can only state that there is still a good opening for
energetic fruit-growers in this Colony—men who will not be contented
with “ good enough,” but who will have the push and energy to take
advantage of any information that will tend to advance their industry,
and who will never be satisfied till they are able to turn out fruit
second to none in the world, which will go direct from the orchard to
the consumers whenever it is possible to do so. This can only be
accomplished by an active co-operation of all of our growers, as it is
by this means only that we can minimise the cost of production and
distribution, and be able to compete successfully against other fruit-
producing countries. Keen competition and low prices have compelled
the Californian growers to co-operate for their own protection, and the
same causes will compel our growers to co-operate if they intend their
industry to prosper.


Viticulture.
BY P. F. ADAMS.
The following paper is designed to sliow tlie capabilities, in botb soil
and climate, of New South Wales as a wine-producing country; that
the pests to which the vine is subject to are controllable, and to give
reasons why the wine trade is not more prosperous, and suggest the
remedy
Soil
In soil, New South Wales possesses all the elements of a great wine-
producing country.
Commencing in the south, the valley of the Murray is formed of
hills of Silurian formation, abounding in the most important elements
of mineral plant-food—potash and phosphate. Even in the alluvium
of the river these elements are in such abundance that, taken together
with the nitrogenous matter of the alluvium, vines planted therein will
go on producing heavy crops for twenty years without manure.
Here and in the Upper Murrumbidgee Valley are thousands of acres
of land capable of producing the thin wines required for making
brandy. By the adoption of viticultural machinery, and judicious
design in planting, the maximum quantity could be harvested with a
minimum expenditure of labour. Yet until legislation removes existing
restrictions nothing can be done in distillation, and these unrivalled
capabilities remain in abeyance.
The foot hills adjacent so abound in potash, lime, and phosphate,
that they only require nitrogenous manure or humus in small quanti-
ties to go on producing crops for all time.
The only drawbacks to the upper valleys are late frosts, but the
fertility is so great that if two crops out of three are harvested the
result will be greater than that of most other districts.
Lower down, the valleys of both rivers open into undulating ground,
possessing all the principal mineral elements, and at Corowa the soil
is further enriched by nodular concretions of sulphate of lime.
The wealth of these valleys lies in the natural endowment of the
very mineral elements which are the most expensive to supply arti-
ficially.
Travelling northerly, the country rises, and the tablelands are too
cold for viticulture; but on their western border a margin, ranging
from 50 to 100 miles, exists, all more or less suited to the vine.
At and around Forbes, on the Lachlan River, the watershed of that
stream embraces a considerable area of soil well suited to viticulture,
although not to the same extent as in other western valleys —again in
consequence of the encroachment of the high tableland thereon the
area is limited.


At Dubbo the valley of the Macquarie River and its tributaries
opens out; enormous areas exist, principally of upper Silurian or
Devonian origin, containing the mineral constituents of wine, with
limestone in abundance.
Nearly all the tributaries of the Macquarie River above Dubbo
pass through country of this character, and upon the higher waters
are thousands of acres suitable to the production of wines of a very
high character, the climate being also favourable.
Passing northward to the watershed of the Namoi and its tributaries,
we find in the neighbourhood of Quirindi, both in soil and climate, every
thing that could be desired, and very promising wine has been sent to
Sydney for exhibition from this part. It is surprising that the growers
of the Hunter River Yalley do not avail themselves of the opportunity
of acquiring vineyards north of the Liverpool Range, and grow a suffi-
cient quantity of full-bodied wine to supplement the product of the
Hunter vineyards in wet seasons by blending. The best soil for viti-
culture will be found on the eastern margin of the great black soil areas
of the Liverpool Plains, especially where the waters rise in granite
country. This also applies to the watershed of the Peel River;
scattered all over this area are innumerable sites for vineyards.
Of the district watered by the upper tributaries of the G-Avy dir River
the writer has not sufficient personal knowledge to describe, but he
believes that a large tract suitable for wine-growing may exist, and
has also seen promising samples of wine produced there.
The last area to be described on western waters is the Macintyre
River and its tributaries, on which unlimited areas exist so rich in
potash and phosphate that the vines g’row and produce to excess, but
the product, although admirably suited for blending, and of great value
for that purpose, does not find the favour with the public it merits.
Some very excellent samples have been produced in these localities,
particularly where the basalt had thinned out and exposed the under-
lying granite or other old formations.
The geological character of the district is granite of several varieties
overfioAved by a general volcanic outburst, from which the potash and
phosphate are derived.
Of the vast areas Avestward of the country already described, there
is any quantity of land in which the soil is all that can be desired, and
Avhere the vine grows luxuriantly if supplied with a very small amount
of Avater. The fruit is luscious and excellent in flavour, but the cli-
mate is unfavourable to the production of wine of delicacy.
Having described the climate of the western slope of the Main
Dividing Range Ave now take its eastern watershed Here we find a vast
extent of excellent soil, but the prevalence of rain during the season
of vintage deters vignerons from planting. However, exception may
be taken to the western waters of the Clarence.
The same drawback exists as far south as the Manning River,
although on the Upper Macleay some very good wine has been pro-
duced in favourable seasons.
At Port Macquarie the only grape which flourishes is the Isabella,
and wine is made from it, but it does not find much favour with the
public.


We next come to the Hunter and its tributaries, where the greatest
variety of geological formation is found; consequently in the alluvium
of its lower waters there is a great and favourable mixture of soil, and
heavy crops of light wine are harvested. Higher up the soil of the
hills improves, and wines light in character and in certain seasons of
excellent quality are produced. In fact, as far as soil goes, this district
has everything required within a comparatively short distance of navig-
able water. The Paterson district is of Devonian formation; the Lower
Hunter carboniferous and sub-carboniferous, with occasional volcanic
remains, which supply potash, iron, and phosphate. The valleys of Black
Creek, the Wollombi Brook, Mulbring Creek and Groulburn Eiver are
sub-carboniferous, and abound in lime. At Singleton, beds of old
alluvium exist, rich in all the vine requires, and on the Upper Hunter, Pal
Brook, and Isis, wherever the coal measures have been either worn away
or have never existed, the soil derived from sub-carboniferous forma-
tion and further supplemented by the washing down of Devonian
formations, is admirably suited to the production of high-class wines.
Of the counties of Cumberland and Camden, except in a few
localities where the remains of volcanic outbursts exist, the soil is not
favourable to wine-making. Further south, beyond the coal measures,
the soil is good all the way to the Victorian boundary, but the
humidity of the climate about vintage time prevents it being availed
of for wine-growing.
It has now been shown that for quality of soil, and extent thereof,
Hew South Wales has certainly no reason to complain, having in fact
all that can be desired in that connection.
Climate.
We now pass on to climate, of which this Colony has indeed every
variety, but weighted with an uncertainty of season, which has exer-
cised a depressing effect on the wine industry and caused other colonies
having a more equable climate to pass her in the race of development.
How this has occurred, and the action proposed in remedy, will
appear later on.
Success or failure depends on rainfall. If it occurs in fair quantity,
at the proper time, all is well. If rain is denied altogether, or abundant
at the wrong season, failure occurs.
In winter, rain is required to enable the vine to absorb its mineral
plant-food. In spring, to bring down nitrogen from the atmosphere
and enable the vine to assimilate its plant-food. The summer or
“ Tropical 93 rain continues the action of the spring rain, and finally
swells the fruit before ripening. This rainfall occurs usually in Janu-
ary, and is an absolute necessity in the elevated districts of the west,
where vines are later in ripening than in the east, and the summer
climate is less dry.
As in describing the soil, we begin with the climate of the valleys of
the Murray and Murrumbidgee. Excepting for late frosts, the climate
of the upper parts of these valleys is all that can be desired ; but as
we proceed downwards these frosts are scarcely felt. The winter climate
is excellent; the cold causes the vines to shed their leaves early and
bud late, giving the vines a long rest, which appears to brace them for
the work they have to perform in summer. At an elevation of BUO


feet the late frosts occur in October, at a time when the canes are
nearly 12 inches long, and so frequently that in one year out of three
the crop will be lost unless precautions are taken by raising a smoke
before sunrise. To provide the necessary straw or litter, and distribute
it, is no great work, and it need only be burned to save the crop.
Many intending vignerons are deterred from planting in districts so
affected, never considering the advantages accruing on the other
hand. I believe that the time will come when existing restrictions to
distillation will be removed, and, despite late frosts, the upper valleys
of the Murray and Murrumbidgee will become the great brandy-
producing areas of New South Wales.
In the lower valleys if the spring rain is not sufficient the tropical
rain generally falls in time to save the crop.
As we proceed westward down these valleys, the tropical rains de-
crease in volume, and if absent the result on the vintage is disastrous—
the grapes wither and can with difficulty be pressed, and the result is
coarse, inferior wine. The remedy for this is watering; no plant
returns so much profit for the cost of watering, and no plant gives
such results from so small an expenditure of water, and yet no pre-
caution against failure is so much neglected. In the districts in
question facilities for obtaining a supply by pumping are frequent.
The time will come when one of the principal objects to be kept in
view in designing new vineyards will be water and a free flow of it
along the rows of vines by easy and gentle grades. A little attention
to this will save labour eventuallv.
V
Northward from the Murrumbidgee the belt of climate suitable for
vine-growing is narrow and confined to an elevation from 600 to 1,000
feet; below this the tropical rains do not generally reach, having been
intercepted by the high tablelands over which they pass.
The valley of the Lachlan at and about Forbes possesses a dry but
even climate, with command of water within certain limits ; with a
supply of water to the vineyard, wine of a very saleable character
could be produced in almost any season. The quantity of land on the
Upper Lachlan is limited, the country falling from the tableland too
rapidly, leaving’ but a narrow belt of available land.
Continuing northerly to the valley of the Macquarie, the climate at
Dubbo, elevation 800 feet, is drier still, and admirably suited to the
production of raisins, but without watering the wine produced has a
tendency to strength and coarseness.
Ascending the river to Wellington, 1,000 feet elevation, the climate
improves, and the tropical rain falls generally at the right time and in fair
quantities. The valley of the Oudgegong from Wellington to Mudgee.
1,500 feet and upwards, has a climate almost unequalled in the Colony,
the tropical rain falling in sufficient quantity to secure an abundant
yield, capable of producing excellent light wine. If ever a true hock
is made in the Colony, it, in all probability, will reward the grower
who plants in this district the German Eiesling grape, the only vine
capable of producing a true hock. The next western water is at the
heads of southern tributaries of the Namoi Eiver, about Quirindi,
elevation 1,300 feet, and extending northerly on this watershed is an
area not extensive, being limited to a certain geological formation,
but, for both soil and climate, unequalled for the production of wine


by any otlier district in New South Wales. The Great Northern Rail-
way passes through it, and the produce is therefore readily available
for blending with the wines of the Hunter. Nature has done so much
for this district that, with the most ordinary care, bad wine ought
never be made, nevertheless the writer had, up to 1891, never tasted a
really well-made wine from it, and unless an improvement has since been
effected, it is a pity to see such capabilities wasted.
The main branch of the Namoi, the Peel Eiver, from its junction,
flows through a country having great capabilities. Tamworth, 1,300
feet elevation, is situated near the lower extreme of the viticultural area,
but all the country drained by the Peel River and its affluents below an
altitude of 2,500 feet possesses a climate as nearly perfect for viticul-
ture as any that can be found in New South Wales, and being well
watered ought to produce some of the most saleable wine in this Colony.
The grapes ripen here as at Mudgee and Quirindi, after the tropical
rain, the elevation being sufficient to counteract the effect of low
latitude. Tamworth, on the Great Northern Railway, is the entrepot
and outlet of this promising district, and situated near its lower
boundary.
The next valley is that formed by the tributaries of the Gwydir
River, which fall rapidly from the high tableland of New England,
and in all probability it includes a belt of good viticultural soil and
climate; but of this the writer has no personal knowledge.
The next western watershed is that of the Macintyre River and
its tributaries, with Inverell at an altitude of some 1,600 feet as its
centre. The climate being dry during the ripening of the grapes,
the wines have a tendency to richness which will in time make them
valuable for export to Europe for blending with light wines of
bouquet from the Mediterranean. The recent reduction in the rate of
railway freight charges will be a great boon to this district.
Having described the climate of the western watersheds, we now
take the eastern. Very little can be said however, as the tropical
rain occurs on or about the time of ripening, therefore success is the
exception rather than the rule. There are, however, on the upper
waters of the Clarence places where high lands intervene, and inter-
cept the tropical rain before it reaches them; it is probable that good
wine may be produced here in dry seasons.
From the Clarence to the Hunter the influence of the tropical rain
is so great that only the Isabella grape thrives; this vine retains its
fruit in spite of wet and mildew, which decays the produce of all the
European varieties.
We now come to the valley of the Hunter, and its tributaries, which
extend from one to two hundred miles from its mouth. Here, as at
the Clarence, high lands intervene between its northern affluents and
the coast, and attract the tropical clouds which discharge the bulk of
their rain before reaching the valley.
Until a distance of 30 miles is attained from the sea board the
climate is too moist for a certain crop each year.
As we progress westerly to the neighbourhood of Gresford and Sin-
gleton, although at only a trifling elevation above sea level, the climate
improves, becoming more regular, so much so that several wine-growers
have succeeded by blending together the vintages of certain years in


producing wines so nearly resembling each other from year to year that
buyers have no reason to complain in this respect. However, the large
amount of capital locked up in this kind of business increases the cost
to the buyer.
Higher up these rivers the climate is dryer, and in localities favoured
with a suitable soil, wines of considerable strength are produced.
Climate alone will not produce good wine, and, with the exception
of the old alluvium, all the good wines of the Hunter are grown on
soil derived from geological formations below the coal-measures.
The climate of the Counties of Cumberland and Camden is unsuited
to wine-growing; excepting in their most western parts very little
good wine is made, and further south the tableland approaches too
near to the coast, the heat and tropical rain preventing the slow process
of ripening so necessary to the production of wine.
Those good wines which have been made in Cumberland and Camden
are the result of the skill and attention which have been brought to
bear upon them, and no person unless thoroughly qualified through
having made wine in a similar climate, in Europe for instance, should
engage in wine-making in these parts.
Pests, I) iseases, and Treatment.
In late years the Australian viticulturist has to contend with plagues
unknown to early colonists. About twenty-five years ago the O'idium
Tuekeri spread over all the grape producing countries of the globe,
and has never left. However, it is now understood, and may be fought
by preventive measures. The best known is sulphur applied before the
fungoid is visible. Once seen treatment is too late for the spot observed,
because the fume of sulphur is only fatal to the germ as it floats in the
air, therefore it is in an invisible state that the fungoid can only be
successfully fought. During rain and immediately afterwards the
spores abound and multiply ; therefore as soon as the leaves are dry is
the time to apply sulphur with greatest effect. Treatment should com-
mence when the first leaf breaks from the bud, and if the weather is dry
at the time, the sulphur will remain effectual for many days, perhaps
until rain falls. If applied after every rain until the grapes are as large
as peas, no injury by Oidium will result. The smallest quantity of
sulphur fume present in the air is fatal to the spores. The quantity
required is small. If ten pounds weight could be equally and evenly
distributed over an acre it would be as effectual as a hundred weight.
Some vignerons mix their sulphur with equal parts finely sifted lime,
wood ashes, or even road dust, and this is supposed not only to help
to distribute the sulphur but to have a curative effect mechanically.
ISText comes the black spot, or anthracnosis. This is also a fungoid
pest, attacking the muscat tribe and several other valuable vines.
The treatment is spraying with Bordeaux mixture. Full directions for
preparing and applying the remedy will be found in Yol. 2, page 421,
of the Agricultural Gazette.
The first spraying should be administered when the young shoots
are about four or five inches long, and continued every three weeks,
or oftener, if the weather is wet or the black spot appears. Spraying'
should not be done during the blossoming of the vines, at which time
sulphur should be applied instead. When the berries are formed


continue spraying till they are as large as peas, at wliicli time tlie disease
ouglit to be got under. But if tlie spot still shows, tbe treatment must
be changed, and Eau Celeste substituted.
If caterpillars are troublesome, tlie addition of Paris green at tlie
rate of a teaspoonful of tlie powder to every 22 gallons of tlie Bordeaux
mixture will destroy them at once. Tlie above-mentioned treatment,
if persisted in, will be found effectual with black spot, Oidium, and
caterpillars, and sulphuring except during flowering is not required.
We now come to the most dreaded of all plagues, the phylloxera.
In this the writer had recent experience, and an opportunity of
observing, all of which leads to the belief that vigorous action in
inspection and treatment will eradicate it in a short time.
In this connection there are two important facts. First, as an insect
the phylloxera is easily killed; its vitality is nothing compared with
peach or apple aphides. Secondly, it is transmitted in the course
of nature only in the winged stage. Of course the insect in its
under-ground stage may be carried, but this can only be by either
wilful or gross negligence; therefore, practically we have to take
measures to destroy it before it has time to reach the winged stage.
This can only be done by careful and repeated inspections, and when
found, destroy at once by application of specific in such quantity as to
kill the vine itself. A few hours after such an application all mature
insects die, and the eggs, if they hatch, find nothing but dead roots.
Vitality will remain in the stock, and, after a time, if not removed,
fresh shoots and roots will sprout. It is therefore necessary to dig
out the stocks and burn them. After destroying all infected vines,
and a belt of apparently sound ones round them, a preventive dose
of specific should be administered to all the vines left. The remedy
lies in constant and vigorous inspection and prompt destruction
wherever the disease is found. Enough money has been spent in
trenching out vineyards in this Colony to have maintained inspectors
sufficient to deal with all the vineyards in Australia. It is only through
want of knowledge of the habits of the insect and of the necessary
preventive treatment that it has been allowed to get such a hold that
no other course than trenching out remained.
Present State of the Wine Industry.
Having shown that Hew South Wales possesses extraordinary
advantages in both soil and climate, the question arises, Why is not
the wine industry in a more prosperous state ?
The answer is that our wine-growers have heretofore taken no steps
to counteract the effect of variation of season, and to produce from
year to year a wine that does not vary with soil, climate, and season —
one that will always have the same strength, character, and quality.
In Hew South Wales there may be at the present time some one
hundred brands of wine in the market, and with few exceptions they
all vary f rom year to year to such an extent that the ordinary customer
fails to identify the wine, and thinks he has been imposed upon.
How, this is hard upon the wine-grower who has done his best, and
bas produced a good, honest article, but unfortunately irregular in
character.
i


For a parallel to tire present state of tlie wine trade, let ns look to
tlie butter industry a few years ago compared witb its present pros-
perous condition, and we shall find tliat tlie remedy for tlie wine trade
lies in tlie same direction.
Practical Suggestions in Remedy.
Tlie first step in reform will be tlie establishment of a ‘'‘'winery” in
each of our most important districts, either by co-operation or by
capital —preferably the latter, as it is desirable to have both the
vintages and export business under the same control.
The small grower who cannot sell his wine with any degree of
regularity will find it far more to his advantage to sell grapes to the
winery for cash on delivery. He can then put his whole capital into
a certain venture.
There is too great a difference between wine farming and wine making
for both to be successfully carried out by one and the same individual.
In a winery where machinery is used, and everything done on a
large scale, a better article can be produced at less cost than by the
small grower.
A winery need not necessarily be very expensive at the outset, if
designed with a view to extension. The first requisite is an abundant
water supply. Choice of site should be given where a sloping bank
exists, rising, say 30 feet in 100 above the drainage outlet; such a
rise from cellar floor to level of crushing mill will admit of performing
all the heaviest work by gravitation. If the natural slope cannot be
found, the height must be got by staging, although at an additional
cost. In this case the grapes would have to be hoisted to the level of
the sorting tables. The machinery employed in pumping water, must,
and wine, crushing, and separating*, also the wine-presses should be
of the best quality, and designed for saving labour. Care and fore-
thought must be exercised in this, or economical working will not
result.
The fermenting house or cellar, if the slope of the ground admits,
should be placed at such a height that vats or presses may be filled
from trollies bringing the mark from the crusher; the floor on which
they stand should be sufficiently raised to enable the must to run by
gravitation into the fermenting casks from which it would be pumped
to the storage casks.
In some districts, where the vintage is early and the climate hot,
refrigerating machinery may be necessary. This, however, would be
of the simplest make, as it would be only necessary to reduce the
temperature a few degrees; consequently neither first cost nor working
expenses would be great.
The principal object in establishing local wineries is to focus, or
bring together the whole product of the district into one wine—or in
technical phrase, “ the vintage of the year.” Of vintages there may
be several, red, white, or sweet, for instance, but the fewer classes of
wine attempted the better.
In order that choice may be afforded in selecting wines suitable
for the general blend, a winery would be required in the far south;
another in the limestone district of the Macquarie, another at Tam


worth, two on the Hunter, one of them on the lower river, and one
above Singleton, all connected by railway with a central export depot
located upon navigable water.
It will be necessary to exercise great care and judgment in selecting
the due proportion from the district wineries, with a view to incorpora-
tion, and the production of a wine that will require little or no subse-
quent treatment to assimilate it to standard.
The system now proposed is not new; it has been in vogue for a
hundred years in France and wineries are almost universal in California.
If Hew South Wales is ever to be a great wine exporting country,
we must be in a position to supply from year to year a wine of even
strength, character, and quality, and this can be done by no other
means than by vatting the wines of different districts in those pro-
portions which the peculiarity of the season may suggest.
It may be urged that blending destroys the individuality of wine.
This is true. But where is the advantage of an individuality which
varies with every season ? Except with the wine-grower who has
already an appreciative constituency of custom, local individuality
must be sunk and a general one adopted.
It is not proposed to blend mature wines, especially those having
unequal alcoholic strength. The objection to this is well known to
every practical winegrower. The blending will be done in the Eastern
wineries by adding stronger vintages of the previous year during
fermentation, the result will be complete incorporation and an average
standard strength, or so near an approach thereto that blending will
not cause disturbance.
Three-fourths of the wine will be grown on Eastern waters, perhaps
within 100 miles of the port of export, and only one-fourth will be
subject to distant trainao*e.
. O
Before entering largely into the wine export trade several subjects
will require careful and deliberate consideration.
First, the classes of wine most likely to find favour, and, secondly,
the standard alcoholic strength to be maintained in each.
In the opinion of the writer four classes will be enough, say full-
bodied red and white, with an alcoholic standard of 25 per cent, proof
spirit, a light red and a light white, strength 20 per cent, proof spirit;
but it is probable that the industry would be started with one red
wane of 21 per cent, proof spirit called Claret, with the name of the
company as a prefix, and if ultimately it was deemed advisable to
introduce a stronger, the strength of the claret could be reduced 1
per cent, without prejudice.
As to the manner of placing our wines on the English market, I
cannot do better than quote from the report of the special commissioner,
Sydney Morning Herald , of 81st December, 1895, as follows :
“ But since writing the lines mentioned I have had opportunities to observe that large
quantities of good sound wdnes suitable for hotel and restaurant dining-rooms were badly
required. But you might have good wines in London and not be able to sell them. You
would require to push and advertise your wines, and gain the goodwill of hotel managers
and the chief men of big companies before you could hope to sell the good wines profitably.
The causes of the South Australian Wine Dep6t not being a complete success are that in
the first place the trade is in but few hands, and in the second, the depdt has not the
millions of gallons of good wine.


When the day comes that the millions of acres in New South Wales which are suitable
for wine production are respected by capitalists, there will be some prospect of Australian
wine being well respected in England. My limited experience here leaves the impression
that the present system of marketing Australian wines or of using the name Australian
on wines sold is doing much injury to the future trade. I know a London wine house
which is said to have 2,700 agents in Great Britain. It would be a difficult matter on the
part of a single winegrower to influence these agents in favour of Australian wine, but a
winegrowing company with a good capital could have its own depots and its own agents.
I am strong in the opinion that a good reliable market for Australian wines can be
obtained in Britain. I know that the light wines (they must be light and sound) can be
readily sold in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and that the same countries will willingly
pay fair remunerative prices for sound red wines. I would not be afraid to place some
of my small savings in a strong Australian Vineyard Company. I have many times put
the plan of such a company before readers in Australia. The plan has been discussed,
but when the call for capital was made the sums offered were too small to start a venture
of the kind. There is profit in wool-growing, and small sums set it going, because wool
is easily marketed, and is an annual crop, but more than six years are required before the
vineyard company can hope for a return.”
The above is perhaps the most recent opinion to hand on the
subject, and, moreover, from the pen of an able business man, and
one who is disinterested; therefore, his opinion is worthy of the
serious consideration of those interested in the progress of the wine
industry of this colony.
Writers in California also deplore the state of the wine trade in
Eastern markets and also in Great Britain; they complain that there
is no encouragement offered to growers to plant vines of higher class
which do not bear so freely —that low-priced wines only are in demand
by dealers ; they further regret the want of judgment on the part of
consumers, who, if they understood the subject, would repudiate an
inferior article.
It is not to be expected that wine-brokers and dealers will take
much interest beyond the cjuestion of immediate piofits, neither can
the wine-growers wait till the popular taste so far educates itself that
inferior wines will be shut out of the market.
In the meantime a favourable opportunity occurs for a strong com-
pany operating on the lines herein projected to step in and sell a good,
sound, wholesome wine at present ruling rates.
If the dealers find it remunerative to pay fees and commissions, it
will pay a company to do the same.
By working on a large scale, employing labour-saving machinery,
having command of strong wines to bring up weak musts, and theieby
keep up a uniform strength and character, New South Wales could
compete with any other country. It would simply be a question of
capital and time. ... £
The returns published in the Statistical Register an aveiage ot
only 207 gallons per acre as the produce of New South Wales vine-
yards. But these figures do not represent the producing power of
properly cultivated vineyards, and the crops of which had been pre-
served exclusively for vintage. For the purposes of this paper it will
be necessary to add 70 per cent, to the averages of districts given _ in
the Statistical Register, and with this addition a very good criterion
can be formed of the yield to be expected from vineyards cultivated
as they would be by a strong company.


In the Southern and Western districts, in the localities where
watering is advised, fully cent, per cent, may he added in order to
get an estimate of production under high cultivation.
Failing the necessary enterprise to take advantage of our natural
resources, the question arises as to how far the Government could
assist in developing a trade. The subject has been fnlly considered,
and deemed to be one for private enterprise alone. This view of the
case will most likely be taken by future administrations, and therefore
the subject may be dismissed.
A proposal to establish an CEnological Laboratory met with more
success, and had the financial condition of the Colony warranted the
expenditure of some £5,000, it might have now been in operation. In
order to derive fall benefit therefrom an CEnological Laboratory must
be situated centrally in a district where grapes come so quickly
under the influence of fermentation that transport by rail would be
impossible.
The object of such an institution is to test practically under scientific
control the important questions of fermentation, blending, and matur-
ing, and also to impart instruction to students in such subjects.
In order to do this, cellarage and casks for 5,000 gallons would be
required, together with appliances for crushing, pressing, and reducing
temperature.
The first expenditure would be the greatest, and with no less sum than
£5,000, could the attempt be made on the smallest scale. However,
after a few years, the sales of wine and brandy would pay working
expenses. A really pure brandy would be a boon to the hospitals.
This paper runs into greater length than originally expected; but
to set forth our resources in soil and climate, how a wine of even
character and quality may be produced from year to year, and,
finally, to combat existing trade restrictions, could not have been
done in a few words.


Sugar Growing and its Manufacture.
BY W. S. CAMPBELL, Department of Agriculture.
The cultivation of the sugar-cane and the manufacture of sugar from
it have within the last thirty years developed into a very important
industry in that semi-tropical portion of New South Wales., which is
the north-easternmost corner of the colony, and the most easterly
portion of the Australian continent.
It does not seem to he generally known that the sugar-cane was one
of the first of the exotic plants introduced into Australia in a.d. 1788.
It was obtained by Governor Phillip, at the Cape, with other plants,
on his voyage to form a settlement at Botany Bay. These exotics
were planted somewhere near the site of our present Custom House
in Sydney. Whether the sugar-cane made any progress there does
not appear, for history has not supplied any further particulars respect-
ing it.
About thirty-three years after the arrival of Governor Phillip, a penal
settlement was established at Port Macquarie, at the mouth of the
Hastings Eiver. Three years afterwards “at a Government plantation
established at Port Macquarie, some sugar was manufactured from
cane grown on the spot. Six hundred acres were planted with the
cane, and it was stated that the sugar and rum produced repaid the
Government for the outlay incurred.” This plantation, according to
the Sydney Herald, 1882, was situated on Wilson's Eiver, a northern
tributary of the Hastings. It was formed by the late Mr. Thomas
Scott, who introduced the sugar-cane from the tropics in 1822. Mr.
Thos. W. Scott, of Port Clare, Brisbane Water, son of the late Mr.
Scott, informed me that from the first crop of cane which his father
succeeded in producing, he made 70 tons of sugar, which was sent to
the Commissariat Stores in Sydney. Shortly afterwards the penal
settlement was abandoned, and nothing further was carried out to
develop the sugar industry. Mr. Thos. Scott, who was the pioneer of
this industry in Australia, was born in the year 1776, and died so
recently as 1881, having attained the great age of 105 years. When
a young man he managed his father's sugar plantation in the West
Indi es, where he acquired his experience. For many years, indeed up
to the time of his death, Mr. Scott strongly advocated the cultivation
of the sugar-cane in New South Whies and Queensland, and it is
probably due to his perseverance that the sugar industry finally became
established and developed into its present importance in both colonies.
For upwards of thirty years he was a constant contributor to the press
—the Sydney Morning Herald, the Empire, and the Queenslander —on
the subject. In 1838 he made a small sugar plantation at Port Clare,
Brisbane Water, near Gosford, and manufactured small quantities of
sugar there which he distributed about this colony and Queensland for
public inspection. For his services in introducing the industry, he


was granted, shortly before bis death; a small pension by Parliament.
Mr. Scott was the first and only person for many years to send bananas
to the Sydney market. These were produced at Brisbane Yv 7 ater.
About the year 1865 much public attention was directed to the
possibility of cultivating sugar-cane profitably in this colony, and
experiments on a considerable scale were carried out on the Clarence;
the Hastings; and the Manning Rivers; and in 1867 fairly large areas
were planted with this crop on these rivers, and arrangements were
made for the erection of sugar mills on the Clarence and Macleay by
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and on the Hastings by Mr.
Morrison, in conjunction with the late Mr. Thomas Mort. In 1869 the
last-mentioned mill was worked for a considerable time, and that year
two of the Sugar Company’s factories were completed; but it was not
until the following year that any considerable quantity of cane was
crushed at these mills. In 1870 the Company’s two mills at Southgate
and Chatsworth on the Clarence were worked through the whole of the
season. During the same year the mill at Darkwater, on the Macleay
River, was at work during the season. The returns to both producers
and manufacturers were, however, very unsatisfactory on account of the
extremely wet season and the want of knowledge of those concerned in
the industry. The results, however, justified further experiments and
expenditure, and from that time onward there was a steady increase
in the area of cane planted on the Clarence; but the cold winter that
followed 1870 showed that sugar-cane could not be profitably grown
either on the Hastings or the Macleay, and in 1873 the Colonial Sugar
Company removed their mill from the latter river to Harwood, on the
Clarence, while the industry was abandoned on the Hastings. For
some years the three mills erected by the Company were worked with
success, and in consequence a number of farmers erected small mills
for the manufacture of sugar from their own cane and that grown by
their neighbours.
For many years the chief industry on the Clarence was the produc-
tion of maize for the Sydney market. At one time this was a very
profitable crop ; but, by degrees, as the area under maize was increased
in other places, the industry apparently became less profitable. The
farmers, therefore, gladly welcomed a new crop which seemed likely to
become a reliable one; and for many years, and until comparatively
recently, the growing of cane has proved a good investment of labour,
and should continue to do so as long as the present prices paid by mill
proprietors continue.
In 1879, the Colonial Sugar Company’s large mill at Southgate, on
the Clarence, was worked for the last time, and four years later the
machinery at Harwood and Chatsworth was amalgamated in one large
factory at the former place. This Company has at the present time
only three large mills at work in the Colony, instead of five, as before;
but the capacity of these three mills is much in excess of the former.
The rich alluvial land on the banks of the Tweed River caused
considerable attention to be directed to the locality as being a very
suitable one for cane-growing.
The Tweed is the most northern river in Hew South Wales, and
an exceedingly beautiful one, being adorned in many places with rich
tropical vegetation, and backed up by an elevated and rugged range of


mountains, which forms the boundary between this colony and Queens-
land, known as the Macpherson Eange. In 1877 the Colonial Sugar
Company decided to erect a mill here, and in 1880 it was started, and
has since been continuously at work. A few other mills small and
large had also started, but about three or four only are still at work.
About this time the rich country on the Richmond River, which is
south of the Tweed and north of the Clarence, attracted great attention,
and a vast number of selections were taken up, both along* the banks
of the river and its tributaries, and on the beautiful, undulating, vol-
canic country lying between the Richmond and Tweed Rivers, generally
known as the ec Big Scrub.” The rush for land in this district was
extraordinary, and large areas were taken up by selectors who could
not hope to make use of them, except for speculative purposes ; many
of these selections afterwards changed hands for large sums of money.
Areas were cleared, cane planted, and numbers of small, and in some
cases large mills were erected, and the manufacture of sugar attempted
by persons who were entirely ignorant of the process. Some of these
mills did fairly well for a time, and the owners were able to employ
a good deal of labour; but, owing to the fall in sugar, and ignorance
of the proper processes of manufacturing it, only a few now remain.
The country about here is extremely fertile and well watered by almost
overflowing creeks of excellent water. In its natural state it is clothed
with magnificent vegetation quite tropical in appearance. Owing to the
peculiar nature of the red volcanic soil common to the “ Big Scrub ” the
heavy tropical rains which frequently occur do not impede to any great
extent farming operations, for ploughing and cultivation can be carried
on almost immediately after heavy rains. This is not the case on the
alluvial banks of the rivers and creeks where the bulk of the sugar-cane
is produced, and it is oftentimes extremely difficult to carry on necessary
work. Notwithstanding the advantages the farmers enjoy in this red-soil
country, the cultivation of the sugar-cane is in too many instances but
indifferently attended to, for only too frequently weeds may be seen over-
topping the sugar-cane even after it has attained its maximum height.
The sugar-cane produced on the beautiful undulating country within
a few miles radius of the village of Rons is purchased under agreement
by the Rous Sugar Company’s mill, which is situate at the village.
This mill, which is an extensive one, has been working for many years
through many difficulties and changes. The price paid for cane here is
about 7s. to Bs. per ton. This company grows a large quantity of cane
for its own use.
A considerable area of land which was at one time cultivated for sugar-
cane in this <c Big Scrub ” country is now used for grazing purposes,
for which it is well adapted; and dairying has taken the place of sugar-
growing to a considerable extent. The dairying seems likely to become
of great importance to the whole district, for it is doubtful whether a
better country could be found for the production of high-quality butter
and cheese. Sugar-cane succeeds well here, and frosts sufficiently severe
to cause injury to the cane do not seem to occur.
A State experimental farm has lately been established in connection
with the Department of Agriculture on a portion of the “ Big Scrub,”
and experiments are being carried out with as many varieties of sugar-
canes as it is possible to obtain from various parts of the world, and

numbers of sets have been distributed to cane-growers in tbe district.
Altogether, about sixty varieties are at present being tested. Not-
withstanding the fact that during the past winter the severest frosts
known in the district occurred, the canes were but little affected, the
majority not in the slightest degree.
Some very important and useful experiments are being carried out
by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on their farm at Keith Hall
on the southern bank of the Richmond River, which must prove of
considerable value to all those farmers who are intelligent enough to
take lessons from them.
In 1881 a large sugar mill was erected on the south bank of the
Richmond River at the Broadwater by the Colonial Sugar Company,
and owing to the liberal terms offered by that company many farmers
were induced to plant cane under contract to supply the mill, conse-
quently, and notwithstanding the failure of numbers of small mills, the
greatest development of cane cultivation in the colony has taken place
on and about this river—to such an extent indeed that the original
factory has been trebled in size, and is now one of the largest and
most complete mills in the world, capable of producing 10,000 to 12,000
tons of sugar in a season of about five months.


As will be seen from tlie preceding table, published by Mr. Coghlan,
the industry lias been a progressive one until 1892,, except during tlie
years 1887-8-9, which Mr. Coghlan attributes to the facts that “ the
low price of the staple and the disturbed state of the markets of the
world a few years ago forced the sugar manufacturers to correspond-
ingly reduce the price offered for the cane, and so caused for a time
the abandonment of this cultivation by the small farmers who found
in the growth of maize less variable results for their labour.”
The following information from the same authority will give a good
idea of the extent of the industry: —
The County of Rous (that is, the country chiefly drained by the Tweed, Brunswick,
and Richmond Rivers) is now the principal centre of sugar-cane cultivation, there being
948 holdings within its boundaries in 1894-5, or a total of 18,774 acres, devoted to its
production, an area comprising nearly three-fifths of the total acreage in the Colony under
sugar crops. The yield obtained from 7,855 acres of productive cane amounted to 168,162
tons, thus showing an average of 21‘4 tons per acre. In the County of Clarence there
were in 1894-5 631 holdings on which cane was grown, the aggregate area being 9,573
acres. In this, as in other sugar-growing countries, the majority of the farmers cultivate
sugar-cane in addition to other crops, and only a few estates are entirely devoted to its
production. Some farmers have areas of from 25 to 100 acres in extent under cane ; but
this number is limited. The yield in the County of Clarence was 60,426 tons, or an
average of 15 2tons per acre, cut on an area of 3,970 acres. In the county of Richmond
the holdings under sugar-cane numbered 221, and aggregated 4,232 acres, of which 2,297
acres were cut, giving a total yield of 34,572 tons of the staple, or an average of IST
tons to the acre.
Tlie amount of sugar-cane grown in oilier parts of tlie Colony was
insignificant.
The estates on which sugar-cane is grown number 1837, and the whole crop eluting the
last season amounted to 264,254 tons of cane, obtained from 14,203 acres, showing the
average production of 18'6 tons per acre, which is 5'9 tons below the average of the former
ten years.
The total consumption of sugar in New South Wales during the year 1894 amounted to
56,639 tons, of which 25,292 tons were the product of the local plantations, the area cut
for the year’s yield being 14,204 acres. The quantity treated by the New South Wales
refiners, including imports, during the twelve months was 37,810 tons. The yield of
sugar per ton of cane varies, of course, according to the viscidity of the juice ; but in
ordinary seasons it may be set down at somewhat over 9 per cent, of the quantity treated.
Until 1892 tlie yield of cane maybe said to liave averaged well, tlie
farmers receiving satisfactory returns, and tlie manufacturers being
content with tlie yield of sugar tliey obtained; but in 1893 tlie con-
tinuous cropping of tlie land witli one kind of crop, and without
manuring, combined witli adverse weather, caused an outbreak of
Oy ' '
disease known as “ gumming,” which has wrought great havoc on the
Clarence and Richmond more particularly; though it is considered and
hoped that a change in the seasons from wet to dry, combined with
better cultivation, may arrest the progress of the disease. During the
last winter unprecedented frosts affected the sugar-cane to a consider-
able extent on the rivers and low-lying land; but that on the high
lands seems to have escaped damage.
Notwithstanding the outbreak of the gumming disease, the farmers
on the Richmond and Tweed have been anxious to increase the area
they have under cane, and have done so to a certain extent, but would
have planted much more largely were it not for the disinclination of


tlie Sugar Company to invest a greater proportion of their capital in
the manufacture of sugar in New South Wales, and the unwillingness
of other capitalists to take any part in the business. The extension
referred to has taken place mainly on the rich volcanic table-lands
between the Richmond and Tweed Rivers on that part of the “Big
Scrub,” nearest the Tweed River and close to the Lismore-Tweed
railway line, between Byron Bay and the Tweed River, the greater
portion of suitable river frontages on the Clarence, Richmond and
Tweed, being already planted with cane.
The amount of capital expended on plant for the manufacture of
sugar in New South Wales from the inception of the industry must
have been very large; it is impossible to give the total, but the sum
at present invested in the business by the Colonial Sugar Company
and others is said to be about £750,000 in buildings and plant alone,
while the outlay by the farmers in clearing, preparing, and planting
their land has probably averaged between £lO and £l5 per acre under
crop.
The system of planting the sugar-cane is as follows : —The cane is
planted in the spring—August to October included —and the first
crop is cut in tire following summer, or if then not sufficiently ripe
for manufacture, it is allowed to stand over until the end of the
winter or early spring* of the following year. From the stools then
left two crops of ratoons are usually taken, when they are ploughed
out and the land replanted.
The price paid by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the
growers was at first 10s. and is now 12s. per ton, the Company bearing
the whole expense of cutting and removing the crop from the field,
this amounting to about ss. a ton. Other mill-owners pay consider-
ably less, even as low as from 7s. to Bs. per ton.
It is a remarkable fact that New South Wales is the only country
in the world, with the exception of the southern portion of Spain,
where sugar-cane is cultivated and sugar manufactured entirely by
white labour. It is impossible to predict whether cane-growing and
sugar-making will be profitable in the future in view of the gradual
removal over two years of the present sugar duties of £5 per ton which
has been decided upon by the Legislature, and the competition of
cheap coloured labour, but it certainly is not likely to be so profitable
as at present.
In a circular issued by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the
cane-growers last year, the General Manager remarks : —“ It only
remains for me to add in regard to the impossibility of bringing the
cost of the New South Wales sugar close to that of sugar made in the
tropics with coloured labour, that through the f gumming ; of the
cane the Harwood sugar last year cost at the mill nearly £6 per ton
more than the average of that made at our Queensland and Fiji
factories, and was, as before stated, of a lower value by 15s. per ton;
and further, that £5 a ton represents the subsidy which must be
given to enable the makers of cane sugar outside the tropics with
white labour to compete with men in the same trade in the tropics
who have much sweeter cane, and grow and handle this at a much
lower cost, a certain proportion of the sum being needed to cover the
inevitable loss in the colony from floods and frosts.” In the same


circular Mr. Knox informed tire cane-growers under contract to the
company that “the removal of each £1 of the present duty of £5 a ton
must cause a reduction in the price we pay for your cane of 2s. a ton.”
Should the cane-growing industry continue after the duty has been
it can only be by superior cultivation, a greater yield per
acre, and an improvement in the quality of the cane. In the October
Bulletin of the Botanical Department, Jamaica, appears the following
important paragraph : —“ The improvement in yield and quality of
sugar from canes may be looked for in two directions —selection of
the best canes on an estate for planting, as determined by chemical
analysis or otherwise, or by growing some of the new seedling canes
of proved high sucrose content.”
In the Bulletin for January, 1894, a list of seedlings were given
which had been received from Mr. Jenman, Superintendent of the
Botanic Gardens at Demerara, and are now growing at Hope. Speci-
mens were sent to Dr. Stubbs, Director of the Louisiana Sugar
Experiment Station, and the following communication has been
received ;
I send you herewith the analysis of the canes which survived with us. From them you
will find that No. 96, the richest cane, is far ahead of anything that we have had during
the past year. We have here seventy odd varieties, besides our home cane, and this is
fully 25 to 33 per cent, better than the best of these. I am this year propagating it
quite largely, and will try to have enough to have a thorough test in the sugar-house
next year. ... lam greatly encouraged by the results of this cane, and
hope that in this way I may be able to obtain what I have failed in every direction, that
is, getting a cane with a high sucrose content.
Tlie extraordinary improvement in tbe sugar-beet of late years, and
tlie wonderful advance of tlie sugar industry in Europe is causing
those dependent on cane-growing to set about improving tbe sugar-
cane if possible. “ Tbe crop of beet-sugar in Europe in tbe season of
1877-8 was 1,420,827 tons. Tbe crop of tbe season 1894-5 readies
4,800,000 tons, an increase in seventeen years of 350 per cent.”
Considerable attention has been directed lately to tbe possibility of
manufacturing sugar profitably from beet-root, as it has been found
from carefully conducted experiments that in many localities tbe sugar-
beet thrives admirably, and yields a very high percentage of sugar.
Some years ago, experiments were made at Bathurst in beet culti-
vation and sugar manufacture, but they failed. Sugar was made, and
beet grew well enough, but tbe cost of manufacture was altogether
too great. It is said that the variety of beet grown at this time con-
tained a very low percentage of sugar.
Tbe matter of sugar-beet cultivation, and sugar manufacture, has
been taken in band very warmly by Mr. Cbas. A. Lee, M.P., of Tenter-
field. He has induced many of tbe farmers to try experiments, and
tbe results of yield per acre of the beet-root, and percentage of sugar,
are considered extremely satisfactory. These experiments were con-
ducted under tbe supervision of Mr. 0. Van de Velde, tbe seed having
been obtained from Europe by tbe Department of Agriculture. Mr.
Van de Velde savs that
The prospects of the introduction of the beet-sugar industry in the tablelands of this
colony are extremely brilliant. He can safely state that no country where this great
agricultural industry is carried out has soil and climate equal to those of New South


Wales. It is true that labour is dearer in this part of the world than in Europe, but
ample compensation will be found in the cheapness of the land, the better and larger
crops, the larger extent of the season for sowing and harvesting, the better market for
the manufactured products, &c. The difficulty of the introduction of this industry in
those colonies is the backward state of farming and agriculture brought about by the too
flourishing conditions of the past. The sugar-beet industry means intense cultivation
and high farming with productions of manure with the by-products of the farm to keep
up the fertility of the land. The permanency of the industry can only be assured on
these conditions. It will raise the present methods of agriculture and farming from their
present level to the highest state of modern perfection, and it shows its importance from
a national point of view.
The farmers about Tenterfield are taking a keen interest in the culti-
vation of the sugar beet. There is under crop this season upwards of
40 acres on small portions. This area would have been largely in-
creased had not an unprecedented drought during the winter months
prevented the soil being ploughed sufficiently deep. Mr. Lee expects
that next season from 80 to 100 acres will be sown with sugar beet, if
seed can be procured, in areas to be limited to one acre each. He
says that the farmers appreciate the value of the roots as winter
fodder for stock —cows in particular —and many of them will in the
future grow sugar-beet in preference to turnips, mangels, or other root
crops.
As an encouragement to experimenters in the growing of sugar beet
the Minister for Agriculture has granted a sum of £5O to be divided
into twenty prizes varying’ from £1 to £8 for the most satisfactory
results this season.
It seems not at all improbable, judging from the results obtained by
the farmers who were entirely new to the method of cultivation neces-
sary for the production of good quality beet, that the heavy yield and
high percentage of sugar likely to be obtained in Hew South Wales, as
cultivation improves, may result in a profitable new industry.
The absolute necessity for extreme care and attention to the cultiva-
tion of sugar beet, must of itself be productive of much good to our
farmers, who will thereby learn that similar care to other crops will,
most likely, prove highly profitable.
I should not like to close this article without a very earnest reference
to what is in reality the turning point of productive industry in Australia,
and that is the establishment of a name for our produce which we offer
for sale in distant markets. The leading idea should be that the very
name, Australia, should convey the impression that the article is excel-
lent of its kind and worthy of the name, Australia.


Horticulture.
BY W. S. CAMPBELL, Department of Agriculture.
Perhaps 110 portion of tlie worlds of tire same area, is better favoured,
tliau Hew South. Wales, with its varied climates and sons, for the pio-
dnction of fruits, vegetables, and flowers. It is really surprising how
great a variety can be grown to perfection and at a minimum expenditui e
of labour. Exotics from cold, temperate, and even tropical countries
thrive equally well within the limits of this comparatively small area;
and still more remarkable is the fact that so many of these plants
from different climates will grow side by side in many favouied
localities. With all these advantages it seems strange that but little
attention is devoted to the raising of vegetables for home use, or to the
cultivation of flowering and ornamental plants for the adornment of
the homes of the settlers in the country. Occasionally one may meet
with a well-cared-for beautiful garden, like an oasis in the wilderness,
but, as a rule, few attempts are made even to grow the commonest
vegetables for the family 5 s requirements, and dependence 101 supplies
is placed on Chinese gardeners, whose gardens are generally to be
found dotted about the country, especially in the most populated
districts. The raising of vegetables, the selling’ of unit, and tne
hawking of g*oods seem now to be almost entirely in the hands of the
Chinaman, the Italian, or Syrian, and the Indian; at the same time
that a vast proportion of our white population consists 01 unemployed
men tramping through, the country in search of woik, and dependent
on the hospitality of the settlers. _
Considering* the little difficulty there is, in most seasons, in pioducing
a sufficiency of fruits and vegetables for a family’s requirements in
most parts of the Colony, it seems almost incredible that our settleis
or farmers do not grow everything they need. This may be due in
many instances to apathy, and in others to a want of knowledge; but,
whatever the cause, it is very much to be lnstances are
known where vegetables are brought hundreds of miles to localities
where the same kinds of vegetables can be grown to periection with
but little trouble. In some places Chinamen travel 40 to o 0 miles
carting vegetables to settlers who have soil sufficiently rich to _ grow
all they need if they took the trouble to devote but a few minutes
a day to the work.
All this will probably be altered as knowledge spreads. When
the principles and practice of horticulture can be taught in our Public
Schools it will be a boon to the Colony, for it is to the coming
generation we must look for improvement. Here and there in the
country instances may be seen of admirable work effected by the
examples and kmdlv encouragement of masters at Public Scnools when

they happen to he enthusiasts in the subject. Far away in the country
the writer met one day near a Public School a number of boys and
girls —quite a string of them —toiling along under heavy loads. On
inquiry it turned out that these loads consisted of, bags of vegetables,
bottles of honey, &c., &c., the produce of the children’s own industry
from little plots of ground adjoining the Public School. The land
was inferior in quality, bOl ng stony and difficult to work, but by the
judicious encouragement of the master these children —boys and girls
.—had become so interested in their gardening that they had been able
to raise considerable quantities of produce after school-hours. Not
one of those boys and girls will ever forget the admirable lessons
thus learnt, which were entirely apart from the ordinary school
curriculum. It cannot be expected that every teacher could succeed
so well, for probably but few have any practical knowledge of the
subject; but it would be well that all those who are being trained for
the work of teaching should have every opportunity afforded them of
acquiring some insight into the various branches of horticulture.
It is somewhat difficult to trace the progress of horticulture in New
South Wales, as but little information on the subject is given in the
early history of the Colony. The first plants introduced were doubt-
less those obtained at Pro de Janeiro and the Cape by Governor Phillip
in 1787, when in command of the “First Fleet.” Collins, in his History,
says :
.As it was earnestly wished. t<? introduce the fruits of the Cape into the new settlement,
Captain Phillip was ably assisted in his endeavours to procure the rarest and best of
every species, both in plant and seed, by Mr. Mason, the Iving s botanist, as well as oy
Colonel Gordon, at that time the Commander-in-Chief of the troops at the Cape ; a
gentleman whose thirst for knowledge amply qualified him to be of service to the
colonists, not only in procuring a great variety of the best seeds and plants, but in
pointing out the culture, the soil, and the proper time of introducing them into the
ground. The following plants and seeds were procured at the Cape and at Bio de
Janeiro. At Bio de Janeiro : Coffee —both seed and plant; cocoa, in the nut (probably
coconut) ; cotton-seed ; banana-plant; oranges, various sorts, both seed and plant ;
lemon-seed and plant; guava-seed ; tamarind prickly-pear ; plant with cochineal on it;
Eugenia, or pomme-rose, a plant bearing a fruit like an apple, and having the flavour and
odour of a rose j ipecacuanha, three sorts 5 jalap. At the Gape of Good Hope . The fig*
tree, bamboo, Spanish-reed, sugar-cane, vines of various sorts, quince, apple, pear, straw-
berry, oak, myrtle.
lii 1791 a supply of “ 200 fruit-trees and a quantity of garden seed”
were brought by H.M.S. Gorgon from the Cape. It is mentioned in
Phillip’s “ Voyage to Botany Bay,” Chapter XIII, that in 1788
All the plants and fruit-trees brought from Brazil and the Cape which were not
damaged in the passage thrive exceedingly, and vegetables have now become plentiful,
both the European sorts and such as are peculiar to this country. In the Governor’s
garden are excellent cauliflowers and melons, very fine of their kinds. The orange-trees
flourish, and the fig-trees and vines still more rapidly. In a climate so favourable, the
cultivation of the vine may be carried to any degree of perfection ; and should not other
articles of commerce divert the attention of the settlers from this point, the wines of Bew
South Wales may, perhaps, hereafter be sought with avidity, and become an indispensable
part of European tables.
In 1792, Collins says :
The Colony had now been established within a few 7 w'eeks of five years, and a review of
what had been done in cultivation under His Excellency’s direction in that time cannot


111016 pioperly lie introduced, tluin n.t tlie close of liis government. An accurate survey of
the whole ground in cultivation, both on account of the Crown and in the possession of
individuals, had been taken by the Surveyor-General and transmitted to England by that
ship ; and from the return which he then made the following particulars were extracted :
Ground in cultivation, 16 October, 1792—in wheat, 208| acres ;in barley, 24 ; f acres; in
maize, 1,186 i acres ; garden ground, 121 \ acres; ground cleared of timber, 162|- acres ;
total number of acres, 1,7031.
Such was tlie initiation of Horticulture into Australia, a small
beginning, but gradually to develop into an important industry. It
was doubtless exceedingly difficult and expensive in tlie early days of
tlie Colony to introduce plants from distant countries by means of tlie
slow sailing sliips, which, took months on the voyage from England,
bo different to the present time, when the latest horticultural novel-
ties can be obtained here almost as soon as they are in the market in
England, and oftentimes very much cheaper.
Amongst the earliest of private individuals to develop horticulture
was Mr. John Macarthur, of Camden Park. The late Sir Win.
Macarthur and the present Mrs. Macarthur Onslow, have continued
this work in a praiseworthy degree.
The Australian Agricultural Company appears to have introduced
many different kinds of plants to its large estate, north of Port
Stephens, and the remains of old gardens may still be seen about the
pretty little village of Stroud, which was once the head-quarters of
the Company. This village was once greatly famed for its gardens.
Much good work in developing a taste for horticulture has been
effected through the medium of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney. When
these gardens were first started, in 1816, the work seems to have
been confined pretty well to the cultivating of fruits and economic
plants, and until the present Director, Mr. Chas. Moore, F.L.S., was
appointed in 1847. These gardens have been gradually so greatly
improved under his direction that they are now renowned throughout
the world for their beauty and usefulness.
Here we now have a magnificent collection of plants, and repre-
sentatives from nearly every country in the world, growing side by
side in great perfection. As might be expected, a vast amount of
horticultural or botanical knowledge can be acquired here by anyone
interested, and days may be spent with profit. Some years ago the
annual exhibitions of the Horticultural Society used to be held on the
lawn in the Lower Garden, and very attractive and interesting they were.
This Society seems to have had its origin about 1848, in the' Aus-
tralasian Botanic and Horticultural Society. It then became the
Australian Horticultural and Agricultural Society, and afterwards
developed into the Horticultural Society of Hew South Wales. Much
good has been effected by this Society in improving horticulture and
developing a taste for the beautiful and useful in flowers, fruits,
plants, and vegetables.
A few years ago many of our leading* citizens were deeply interested
in gardening*, and encouraged a love for the art by their example.
Amongst them were the late Messrs. T. S. Mort, H. Prince, H. Moore,
H. H. Bradley, Dr. Bennett, 0. Stephen, J. Young, and the then well-
known nurserymen the late Messrs. T. W. Shepherd, R. Henderson,
Guilfoyle, J. Graham, and J. Baptist.


Of recent years gardening lias become exceedingly popular about
Sydney and some of tbe country towns; and gardeners, professional
and amateur, exbibit remarkable skill in tbe art. There are several
Horticultural Societies in tbe city and suburbs ; and others in tbe
country, which are chiefly connected with Agricultural Societies. At
some of their Exhibitions may be seen wonderfully good specimens of
flowers and ornamental plants, difficult to excel, perhaps, anywhere.
The rose seems to hold its own as a favourite, although the chrysan-
themum has many admirers. The rose, in this Colony, succeeds to
perfection, and is one of the easiest and most satisfactory of plants
to grow, for it will withstand a severe drought and much ill-treatment.
When properly attended to, manured, pruned, and cultivated, it repays
tenfold this attention, and many varieties will blossom, almost continu-
ously, throughout the year. The tea-scented, and those termed hybrid
tea-scented, are by far the most floriferous, and consequently have
become the favourites. The varieties termed hybrid perpetuals are
not grown now nearly so much as used to be the case a few years ago,
and this is to be regretted, for there are many exquisite kinds amongst
them. The best season for hybrid perpetuals is about the month of
October, and if the spring should be showery and moist, without hot
winds, the flowers come to great perfection.
The chrysanthemum seems to be perfectly at home in almost all
parts of New South Wales ; and, strange to say, and quite contrary to
the general impression, it succeeds wonderfully well in the dry atmos-
phere of the inland parts of the Colony, provided it can be supplied
with water. There is generally great competition amongst chrysan-
themum-growers at the Horticultural Shows, and some remarkable
flowers are frequently exhibited. Nearly all good novelties raised in
Europe or America seem to find their way here almost as soon as their
qualities are known. Some few good varieties have been raised here ;
but it seems rather surprising that the work of hybridising and raising
new kinds is not taken more in hand by amateurs. The same may be
said with respect to other plants, for few really good varieties are raised
here, although garden-plants seed with great freedom and are so easily
hybridised.
The Camellia thrives exceedingly well, and is a useful ornamental
plant even when not in full bloom. After it becomes fairly well
established it needs but little attention, and will in time attain a
considerable size. Unfortunately, many of the plants grown are poor
varieties which bear indifferent, semi-double, ugly blooms, when their
places could just as well be occupied by others bearing beautiful flowers.
A flower which has come greatly into favour amongst floriculturists
is the Bouvardia, which belongs to the Order Ruhiacese. There are
many varieties now in cultivation, and they all succeed remarkably
well in most parts of the Colony. It would be difficult to find more
beautiful, graceful, or useful plants. They blossom continuously for
many months during the year, and the more the flowers are removed
the better the plants seem to blossom. The first varieties introduced
into the Colony were JB. triphylla and JE». Jacquinii, but of late years
great improvements have been effected, and all the beautiful varieties
have been introduced.
K


Carnations, pinks, picotees, and all members of tlie Dianthus family
thrive to great perfection, and are very useful and ornamental flowers
for the garden. The variety of carnation most preferred is that known
as the t( Tree, or Perpetual-flowering/’ which blooms for the greater part
of the year. Considerable interest has been taken in the carnation
lately, and flowers of great excellence, and in great quantity, are
grown by florists for decorative purposes. Plants need attention and
watering during very dry weather, or they may die off suddenly. Some
fine varieties of the tree Carnation have been produced in the Colony.
Bulbs and tuberous-rooted plants succeed admirably in various parts
of the Colony, and many of them need little or no care after they are
once planted. They may be left in the ground year after year with
impunity, unless it is thought necessary to thin them out. Great
quantities of Daffodils, Liliums, Jonquils, Hyacinths, Snowflakes, and
Snowdrops are grown by the nurseymen and florists for sale during
the season. Some of them succeed best in elevated coolest parts of the
Colony. Hippeastrums succeed admirably, and without any care.
Some fine hybrids have been raised in the Colony from time to time by
amateurs and others.
Pelargoniums were at one time great favourites, but although still
grown largely, interest in them seems to have fallen off considerably;
the reason probably being that they can be grown so easily —almost
like weeds, if permitted. The same thing may be said with respect to
many other kinds of plants which are glass-house treasures in some
countries. Indeed, some plants which have been introduced for
ornamental purposes thrive so well that they have become great pests,
as, for instance, a Lantana from China ; and the prickly-pear,
vulgaris, which has spread to such an extent in some parts of the
Colony that vast tracts of country have been ruined by it for pastoral
purposes. The sweetbriar, also a garden favourite in some countries,
has spread here almost beyond control; and the common blackberry
has become a great pest in some places, and most difficult to eradi-
cate. Numbers and numbers of species of beautiful trees, shrubs, and
flowering plants thrive in this Colony in great perfection. Magnolias
of various kinds, Azaleas, Phododendrons, Cactuses, Abutillons, Palms,
Yuccas, Bamboos, Berberis, Crataegus, Daphne, Jacaranda, Deutzia,
Dracaenas, Gardenia, Hibiscus, Hydrangea, Lasiandra, Spirea, Annuals
of almost every kind, Perennials, and beautiful creepers of wonderful
variety are quite at home in the various climates. It is not possible
here to mention the names of more than a very few of the exotics
which have become quite acclimatised.
Our native flora abounds with many species of beautiful flowering
plants and Palms, Ferns, and Macrozamias well adapted for cultivation
in our gardens, and some of them are used with great effect, although
others are somewhat difficult to grow under cultivation, strange as
this may appear to the uninitiated.
In the rich semi-tropical districts in the north-east of the Colony, and
in patches extending considerably to the south of Sydney, near the
coast, the indigenous vegetation is extremely beautiful, especially that
in the north. Here and there in this rich country may be seen vast
groups of graceful Palms, the Bungalow, Pytchosperma Cunninghamii ;
the beautiful little Walking-stick Palm, or Midgimbill, Areca or


Bacularia monostachya , and tlie Cabbage-tree Palm., Livistona Australis.
In tlie dense “ brushes ” grow magnificent specimens of the Silky
Oak,” Grevillia rohusta, a most useful tree for ornamental purposes in
large gardens and for street-planting. Strange to say, this tree thrives
well, and flowers and seeds abundantly when planted in our dry
western districts, which have quite a different climate to that of the
moist, humid climate in which it is indigenous. In these “ brushes”
also grow the beautiful Hymenosporum jasminoides, frequently culti-
vated in our gardens ; the Flame-tree, Br achy chiton acerifolium, which
is one of the most gorgeous trees it is possible to imagine when bear-
ing its masses of scarlet bell-shaped flowers before the leaves appear.
This would be an acquisition to any garden in the world where it
would thrive; the Richmond River pine, very ornamental when
young; the Moreton Bay chestnut, Gastanospermum Austrcde, one of
the most beautiful and ornamental of trees; the Queensland nut,
Macadamia ternifolia, which bears sweetly-scented flowers and after-
wards excellent nuts. This tree is very ornamental, and worth grow-
ing. Handsome creepers and climbing plants abound here also—
Passifloras, Hoyas, Jasmines, and the beautiful jasminoides,
bearing large, bell-shaped, pinkish flowers, which is frequently culti-
vated in our gardens. In swampy places and along the edges of creeks
the handsome white-flowered Crinum abounds, and all
through the brushes are millions of the large ornamental-leaved Goloc-
asicL macrorrhiza.
Perhaps the most beautiful flowering plant in the north is the
water lily ( Nymphese gigantea), some flowers of which were lately
sent to Her Majesty the Queen, in ice, by a Sydney florist. This grows
in creeks and lagoons about the Richmond and Clarence Rivers, and
beautiful indeed it is to see in its natural state floating in great masses
on the still water. The fig-trees, Ficus F.
F. aspera, and F. vesca are deserving of mention, for they are used
extensively, especially the first mentioned, for ornamental and shade
purposes. Ficus vesca is exceedingly handsome, but not so well known
as the others. Some of these figs grow to extraordinary perfection in
the north, but it would need pages to describe them and their remark-
able peculiarities. Along the coast, in poor country, some of
our prettiest flowers grow to great perfection. The Christmas Bells
[Blandfordia) , the Christmas Bush , the
VYaratah ( Telopeaspeciosissima) , all easy of garden cultivation; the
Flannel Flower ( Actinotus helianthi) , made popular by Lady Carring-
ton ; the Epacrids, Correas, Boronias, Gigantic Lily
excelsa), and numbers and numbers of other pretty flowers. Some of
the native orchids are grown in our gardens, chiefly the handsome,
Dendrohrium speciosum, which thrives well about Sydney. D.
ianum is exceedingly pretty ; and there are several other species worth
the growing, but not often collected. One of our most beautiful
orchids is Sarcochilus Fitzgeraldi, which, howmver, is rather rare. Of
ferns sometimes collected there are Adiantuns of several species, several
Alsophelas, Cyatheas, Todeas, Gleichenias, Tricomanes, Hicksonias,
Lygodium scandens . Aspleniums, Polypodiums, Lomarias, and numbers
of other ferns, including the remarkable Stag and Elk Horn Ferns,
Platycerium alcicorne and grande.


Several varieties of Acacias are in cultivation, for their beauty is
becoming well recognised. One of the most beautiful is the Coota-
mnndra Wattle {Acacia Bailey ana). The dry western portion of the
Colony is remarkably rich in leguminous plants, including many species
of Acacia, which are exceedingly beautiful when in full bloom —perfect
masses of gold. No doubt in time they will be treasured in our
wardens. In the dry west too we have the handsome Eremophilas
and Sturt's Desert Pea {Clianthus besides numbers of
pretty things hardly known at present beyond their immediate neigh-
bourhood.
The magnificent palms indigenous to Lord Howe Island are well
known and valued throughout the gardening world. These are the
Howeas, best known as Kentia Belmoveana } K. o antei‘hil1 ’ yaila , K*
Fosteriana.
A considerable trade is carried on by the nurserymen and florists in
these palms, chiefly in K. Belmoreana. They succeed admirably in
gardens about Sydney, and when planted with tree-ferns grow freely
and quickly, and are wonderfully effective. They are useful for glass-
house, bnsh-honse, and indoor decoration, being able to withstand ill-
treatment and neglect better than any other palms.
The bush-house is one of the most useful of structures in connection
with the garden in all the warm parts of New South Wales. In it a
multitude of plants can be grown which would be liable to perish in
the hot sun. It can be, and is, constructed of all sorts of material,
sometimes tea-tree brush, laths, bamboo-blinds, and indeed anything
that will break the rays of the sun without altogether obstructing
them. In many gardens about the metropolis and large towns there
are glass buildings where tender exotics of warmer climates than New
South Wales are well grown, perhaps as well grown by some of the
gardeners and amateurs as in any part of the world. Everything
indicates that the taste for floriculture is improving rapidly, and will
continue to improve, and this is due in a great measure to the fact that
we have many excellent gardeners, professional and amateur.
Unfortunately, the “vegetable” branch of horticulture is greatly
neglected ; and it is a disgrace to the Colony that we should be obliged
to import many of the vegetables we use from onr neighbouring
Colonies, chiefly from Victoria, where vegetable-growing is in the
hands of Europeans. In New South Wales we have equal facilities for
the production of every vegetable we need of the best quality, but
we seem to lack the enterprise, or spirit, or go, of onr exemplary
neighbours.
As previously stated, our vegetables are chiefly produced by Chinese
gardeners. Consequently they are of but poor quality, insipid and
watery, owing to the peculiar method of over-watering and over-
manuring adopted. Although these vegetables are of such poor quality,
they are absolute blessings in many parts of the Colony where Europeans
either will not or cannot grow those they need. Vegetables of excellent
quality can be produced, even in dry districts, with but little irrigation
if they be properly managed, but unless a Chinaman has a super-
abundance of water he is lost.
The vegetable chiefly grown and used in New South Wales is the

be tlie object chiefly in view. Quality seems to be generally ignored,
although cabbages of superb quality are frequently to be met with in
private gardens, or even in small market-gardens worked by Fiuropeans;
the difference in quality is extraordinary, proving beyond all question
that the best cabbages can be grown, not in one or two localities, but
throughout the Colony, as the writer has had many opportunities of
proving. .
The potato is a vegetable largely used, and can be grown of the
best quality and in almost any quantity; but not nearly enough for
our own consumption is produced. Coghlan says:
The amount of potatoes imported for local consumption during 1894 was 31,013 tons,
while the quantity available from the fields of the Colony, after allowing for seed,
was 78,237 tons. The net imports amounted, therefore, to 28 per cent, of the total
consumption, as compared with 42 per cent, in 1893, and 52 per cent, in 1892.
As with fruits and flowers, the variety of vegetables that can be
produced throughout the year in New South Wales is surprising.
In some of the warmest localities near the coast, in the north-eastern-
most portion of the Colony, tender vegetables like the French bean
and tomato can be grown all the year round. The latter may be seen
growing - wild in some places, the seed having probably been spread
about by birds. Here the sweet potato, the Papaw aople, and varieties
of yams are grown in conjunction with such vegetables as cauliiowers,
cabbages, onions, and potatoes.
Probably every vegetable worth growing for domestic purposes can
be produced in various parts of New South Wales of the very best
quality. Splendid asparagus and celery can be grown, but it is
difficult to obtain them of good quality or at a reasonable price.
Rhubarb, too, can be grown equally well, but is neglected, and
quantities are imported, and, of course, being stale when used, cannot
be equal to that freshly gathered. The most surprising thing is that
we import and use considerable quantities of tinned vegetables, such
as tomatoes, asparagus, peas, and others, when it really should be the
other way about, and our exports should be large.
Melons, cucumbers, squashes, pumpkins, and marrows grow to
great perfection, but very often they are grown together, and become
crossed and recrossed to such an extent that good varieties deterio-
rate and become greatly spoiled; but good seeds true to name can
always be obtained from seedsmen in the city and their agents in the
country, and at very reasonable prices.
Not" much attention has been given to seed-raising, although it
should be a profitable industry. At one time in our short history,
when cultivation was confined to the County of Cumberland, it was
considered that seed deteriorated greatly, and no doubt this was the
case with some kinds of vegetables, but it has since been proved that
seed equal to any imported, and indeed in many instances better, can
be raised in our cool climates. This is a branch of horticulture which
might be made profitable by anyone skilled in such work, if sufficient
care be given to it.
From the foregoing remarks it will be apparent that our horti-
cultural potentialities are practically unlimited, and it only needs the
necessary knowledge, skill, and perseverance for our settlers to develop
them for their own profit, pleasure, and health.


Silk Culture.
BY W. S. CAMPBELL, Department of Agriculture.
It is becoming very apparent to tliose wlio have given the matter
serious consideration tliat tlie settlers in tire country districts of this
Colony will find it necessary, in tlie near future, to give more attention
to tliose branches of Agriculture which are generally known as ‘ f minor
branches” than has been the custom up to the present time.
There are complaints on all sides that such crops as maize, wheat,
sugar-cane, hay, &c., &c., yield very little profit; and numerous inquiries
are made from time to time to the Department of Agriculture for
advice as to other crops likely to be suitable to our various climates
which may prove more profitable and more sure than those which the
farmers have been accustomed to produce.
In course of time necessity will compel our settlers to practise better
systems of cultivating their lands; to produce more food for their own
use ; to improve their productions for foreign markets ; and to concen-
trate as much of their produce as possible into as little bulk as can be
effected without deterioration.
There seems to be no reason why very many settlers cannot fol-
low the admirable examples of some of the European nations, where
each family produces on its own small farm most, if not all, the food
required, and even the greater part of the raw material for clothing.
In countries with climates far more severe and trying than ours, the
requirements of the families are produced on remarkably small aieas.
An area of 10 acres would be considered a large farm, and on this a
family will live contentedly, and nothing would induce the members to
leave their little plot. This is the case in many districts in France,
which is probably in consequence the most wealthy country in the
world, and where about 50 per cent, of the population is engaged in
farming operations. On their little areas of perhaps lor 2 acres, a few
olives, some vines, figs, mulberries, maize, wheat, vegetables, &c., are
grown, and fowls, goats, and a few other kinds of stock are kept, and
every inch of land is made use of. In this Colony of New South Thales
many settlers with, hundreds of acres each, can hardly make a bare
existence.
In Germany, <c In 1882, at the time of the last occupation census, the
total number of farms (including arable land, pasture, meadow, culti-
vated pastures, orchards, and vineyards), each cultivated by one house-
hold, was as follows :
Under 1 hectare (2*4-'7l) acres) 2,323,316
Between 1 and 10 hectares (2-471 to 24’71 acres)... 2,274,096
~ 10 and 100 hectares (24*71 to 247 acres) 653,941
Above 100 hectares (217"1 acres) ••• 24,991
Total .. ... .. .• ••• 5,276,344
These farms supported 18,840,818 persons, of whom 8,120,518 were
actually engaged in agriculture/’


SILK-CULTURE.




Amongst tlie many industries liiglily suited to the climate of New
South Wales, but hitherto neglected, is that of the rearing of silk-
worms, for it has been well proved that their food —the mulberry —suc-
ceeds well, and that the mulberry silkworm is perfectly
at home, and produces silk of the best quality, showing that the
mulberry grown here yields not only good food, but that it also secretes
the peculiar resinous substance which is so necessary for the production
of silk of the best marketable quality.
It seems somewhat remarkable that, notwithstanding the facts, which
are beyond all question, that the mulberry thrives here in the greatest
perfection, that silkworms are remarkably healthy and vigorous, and
that the necessary skill in rearing them to the best advantage is forth-
coming, the colonists have not, until recently, given consideration to
silk culture. This may be accounted for, to some extent, to the fact
that the rearing of silkworms has generally been made a sort of play-
thing of by children, and it has become the custom to consider it
merely as a kind of toy, and unworthy the serious attention of adults.
However, it is somewhat singular (and perhaps a sort of consolation to
those who desire to see the industry prosper) that the introduction of
silk culture has met with serious difficulties in all those countries where
it has subsequently become so profitable. It will therefore be interest-
ing to give some instances.
It seems to be beyond all doubt that the industry had its origin in
China. Huhalde, in his work, “ Description de la Chine,” says : “Up
to the time of this Queen (Si-ling-Chi), when the country was only
lately cleared and brought into cultivation, the people employed the
skins of animals as clothes. But these skins were no longer sufficient
for the multitude of the inhabitants. Necessity made them industri-
ous. They applied themselves to the manufacture of cloth wherewith
to cover themselves. But it was to the Princess that they owed the
useful invention of silk stuffs. Afterwards the Empress named by
Chinese authors, according to the order of their dynasties, found an
agreeable occupation in superintending the hatching, rearing, and
feeding of silkworms, in making silk, and in working it up when
made.”
Figuier mentions that “M. Stanislaus Julien tells us of many
regulations made by the Emperor of China to render obligatory the
care and attention requisite to rearing silk.
“ Tchin-in, being governor of the district of Kien-si, ordered that
every man should plant 50 feet of land with mulberry trees. The
Emperor, under the dynasty of Witei, gave to each man 20 acres
of land on condition that he planted 50 feet with mulberry trees.
Hien-tsang (who ascended the throne in 806), ordered that the inhabit-
ants of the country should plant 2 feet in every acre with mulberry
trees. The first Emperor of the dynasty of Song (who began to reign
about the year 960) published a decree forbidding his subjects to cut
down the mulberry trees.
CC B y all these means, according to the testimony of M. Stanislaus
Julien, the business of the fabrication of silk became general in China.
This great empire soon furnished its neighbours with this precious
textile material, and created for its own profit a very important branch
of commerce.”


The history of the spread of the industry in other countries from
China is extremely interesting, but limited space forbids further par-
ticulars being given, beyond those which appertain chiefly to their
compulsory nature.
The greater part of the silk produced in Europe is raised in Italy
and France, but great difficulties were experienced in establishing
silk culture in those countries, and there, as in other places, it has been
effected by the efforts by far-sighted, and even sometimes despotic,
individuals. “ The culture of the mulberry and rearing of silkworms,”
says Cochran, “ is said by some authors to have been begun in France
during the 18th century, in an amateur way, in Languedoc, 1 rovince
and the Comtat d' Avignon, but the experiment does not appear to have
made much progress,” however, later on, cc it was enthusiastically
encouraged by King Henry quatre,” during whose reign the industry
may really be said to have begun. u This king,” says Figuier, saw
with grief considerable sums of money leaving France each year for
the purchase of raw silk or silk stuffs. Two men marvellously furthered
his project of encouraging the silk trade” —these were Barthelemy
Laffemas and Olivier de Serres, who used great efforts to establish
sericulture — c< but, notwithstanding’ this great impulse, sericulture
dwindled away on the death of the king. It received a fresh impulse
under Colbert,” to be brought to a standstill by the revocation of the
edict of Nantes. After the first French Revolution the industry
revived, and Cochran says, “ One of the very few good things Napoleon
Bonaparte did for France was to foster sericulture, so that under his
encouragement the crop once more began to increase and progress,
and after the European peace of 1815, rapid progress up to the end
of 1853 was attained,” when the disastrous silkworm diseases almost
annihilated the industry in Europe.
In Italy there seem to have been considerable difficulties in the
way of establishing the industry. Figuier mentions that in Tuscany,
“in 1440, each Tuscan peasant was forced to plant at least five mulberry
trees on the land he cultivated.”
His Excellency, our late lamented Governor, Sir Robert Huff, who,
with the members of his family, took considerable interest in seri-
culture, caused a translation to be made and published on the
<c History and present state of Sericulture and Silk-spinning in
Hungary, 1891.” The writer of the article says, Ci Silk culture was
begun in Hungary towards the end of the 17th century; the industry
was most successful until the end of the last century, when it was
almost entirely abolished by various unfavourable circumstances. In
1811 a Commission was instituted, under the protection of Joseph (the
late Archduke of the Palatinate), for the promotion of silk culture,
and through his zeal the industry gradually revived, so that in 1826
the amount of cocoons gathered rose to 152,000 kilogrammes
(1 kilo. = 2*2055 lb.) The present Archduke Joseph, following the
example of his father, is one of the most ardent supporters of this
grand industry. Between 1835 and 1845 the amount of cocoons pro-
duced reached the maximum of 250,000 kilos., and this amount was
maintained until the political crisis of 1848—9. At that period the
industry began to decline, and during 1850 and the few following


years the remains of it were so completely crushed by the f Pebrine/
a silkworm disease which raged all over Europe at the time, that by
1860 silk culture seemed to have disappeared entirely from Hungary.
“ About 1870 the Hungarian Government once more directed its
attention to this branch of commerce, and instituted a Board for the
official inspection of silk culture at Szagzard.
(t In 1880 Baron Gabriel Kemeny, the Minister of Agriculture, re-
organised the Board of Inspection, granting it a more independent
sphere of action, and urging and encouraging the occupation in the
country.
“ The arduous task of its development was assured by M. Paul de
Bezeredy, who threw all his energies into the work, and strove per-
severingly to attain his object not only from an agricultural point of
view, but especially in a philanthropic sense, and he sacrificed a large
part of his own private fortune for the success of the enterprise.
Thanks to the zeal of this able man, and also to the valuable aid of
M. W. de Ritter, of Gorice, whose enlightenment and technical know-
ledge were important acquisitions, the success surpassed all their
highest hopes. The following figures are sufficient to show the
enormous strides with which the industry advanced: —In 1880 there
were 71 communities, producing 10,000 kilos of cocoons; in 1891
there were 2,268 communities, producing 1,110,000 kilos of cocoons.
“ M. de Bezeredy did not attain these marvellous results without
constant hard work and perseverance and overcoming many obstacles.
The ignorance and carelessness of the people was a continual obstruc-
tion, and in combating this he was assisted by the Royal Government,
who invested the president of the Board with the power of requiring
from the local authorities the use of the public forces to check dis-
orders in any part of the kingdom and to punish the culprits who
resisted the picking of the mulberry leaves and even damaged or
destroyed the trees/’
From the examples given in the above brief extracts it might
reasonably be supposed that there would be many difficulties to over-
come in establishing sericulture in Hew South Wales, or in any of the
colonies, and such, in part, has been the case.
In the earliest days of the Colony, when it was found that the
mulberry succeeded admirably, some thoughts were given to the
establishment of the industry. In 1825 the Australian Agricultural
Company expected good results from silk culture, but no steps seem
to have been taken to further it at that time.
In 1842 Mr. Surgeon R. T. Jameson, in his work “ Recent Travels
in Hew South Wales,” remarked “ of these prospective resources the
culture of silk is especially deserving of attention. The mulberry
tree grows to great perfection, and the silkworms already introduced
have shown by their instructive industry that a great trade in raw
silk might be carried on from the shores of Australia as easily as those
of China and Italy.”
A gentleman named Buezeville, about the year 1848, made an
attempt to establish silk culture on a farm at Eastwood, near Ryde,
but this collapsed through want of means and profitable varieties of
silkworms. Flanagan, in his “ History of Hew South Wales,” says


“ tlie experiment wliicli had been made to grow silk on an extensive
scale in the Colony proved a failure,, chiefly in consequence of the want
of the proper species of mulberry.”
Various attempts were made from time to time to promote the
industry, but they seem to have failed chiefly either from a want of
proper knowledge of the subject or from inadequate supplies of food
for the silkworms.
At the time the terrible silkworm diseases were so prevalent in
Europe, and which threatened to completely ruin the industry there,
the price of healthy silkworms’ eggs or graine rose enormously, and
nearly every part of the world was searched by agents from France
and Italy. This gave a stimulus to sericulture in this Colony, where
healthy eggs could be raised without difficulty. The silk manufac-
turers in England became alarmed at the probability of importations
of raw silk becoming short, and “the Silk Supply Association was
formed in London to take measures for the arrest of the evil, and
promote silk farming in every English country devoted to the growth of
the mulberry. * * * The effect of these diseases was gradually
to curtail the annual crop of silk available for international com-
mence, until a point was reached when the silk industry of the
world was threatened with extinction.” Happily, Pasteur took in hand
the investigation of the silkworm diseases, with such splendid results
that the expected calamity was averted.
At this critical time “ we had in this Colony pure-bred races of the
old original stock of silkworms, perfectly free from diseases of any
kind, owing to the careful efforts of Mr. Charles Brady, who had
succeeded in eliminating all traces of disease.” Dr. George Bennett,
M.D., Hon. Secretary to the Acclimatisation Society of New South
Wales, writing to Her Majesty’s Minister at Florence, 18th May, 1870,
said, “ It is well for me to explain that the subject (the rearing of silk
and silkworm graine in the Colony) is not quite a new one to us, and
under the immediate observations of this society some remarkable ex-
periments have been carried on here continuously for several years last
past. Diseased and weak worms have been introduced by Mr. Charles
Brady from Europe and from elsewhere, others sound but more or
less inferior in quality. Some of this diseased and feeble stock, after
treatment by him for several generations in this climate, have, under
the influence of fresh food grown in the new soils of the Colony,
gradually improved in constitution, and some breeds even appear to
afford reasonable hope of becoming perfectly sound and absolutely
restored to the original vigour of the parent stock before the disease
appeared.” Dr. Wallace, of England, in an article on Sericulture in
“ Cassell’s Technical Educator,” remarks, “ I have myself received
from Mr. Brady eggs of a celebrated European race (Milanese), now
very subject, in Europe, to disease, which have been pronounced after
microscopic examination by skilled experts to be perfectly free from
all signs of disease.”
After Pasteur’s investigations and discoveries, the silkworm diseases
were sufficiently stamped out to permit of the silk industry being re-
established, and the price of healthy eggs fell from £3 3s. per ounce,
which had been received by Mr. Brady for his graine, to a price which


was not nearly so remunerative, and tlie hopes of those colonists who
were making preparations to embark in the industry of rearing graine
for export were damped considerably in consequence.
Amongst the various colonists besides Mr. Brady who made con-
siderable efforts to establish the industry about this time were
the late Thos. S. Mort, Mr. George Thorne, Dr. G. Bennett, Mr.
Jas. Manning', Revd. Father Pacilio, Mrs. Bladen Neill, Messrs.
Affleck and Howard, Mr. R. D. Adams, Mr. F. Wentworth, Mr.
S. D. Gordon, Mr. J. Fry, and Mr. J. T. Hobbes. From that time
until the present, Messrs. Brady, Fry, and R. D. Adams have con-
tinued their efforts, and at last there seem to be good prospects of
sericulture being properly established on a system which obtains in
no other part of the world, discovered and worked out success-
fully by Mr. Brady. Attention was directed to this system by the
late Dr. Bennett. Writing to the Colonial Secretary, 7th June, 1870,
he said ; “ Secondly, the well-known operations of Mr. Brady in the
Colony -have already -caused considerable attention to be directed to
Australia, and the very remarkable system originated by that gentle-
man, and carried on from time to time during several years under the
observation of this society (Acclimatisation), of producing a succession
of daily broods and crops of silk during a great part of our long
season, is highly encouraging.” This very important fact, so honour-
able and, if rightly understood, so calculated to do good to the Colony,
was thus commented on by Mr. Dickens, President of the Silk Supply
Association of London, at a public meeting held at Coventry : —“ The
fact of producing silk day by day was most wonderful, and was what
was not done in any other part of the world.” And Mr. Chadwick,
M.P., at the same meeting, took occasion to say, in reference to this
Australian plan, that “ the daily production of silk which would be
as important a fact as ever occurred in the silk trade.” The late Mrs.
Bladen Neill, who lectured before the Society of Arts in London, 1876,
remarked : “No account of silk culture in Australia would be com-
plete without a tribute of praise to the unwearied and scientific labours
of Mr. Chas. Brady, of Antony, Tweed River, who has devoted his
life to the study and improvement of silk culture. We owe to him the
means of producing successive and daily hatchings at pleasure, as well
as the introduction into Australia of the best races of silkworms
known. These will doubtless produce in time. He probably knows
more about silkworms than any man living.”
It has been necessary to give the above particulars to enable the
reader to form a clear idea of the operations to further the establish-
ment of silk culture, which are now being carried on by the Government.
Before entering into particulars respecting these operations, mention
should be made of the sericultural work carried on by a small settle-
ment of Italians at New Italy, a comparatively poor tract of country,
situated between the Richmond and Clarence Rivers.
These Italian settlers are a remnant of the ill-fated expedition to New
Ireland organized by the Marquis de Ray. They were practically des-
titute when they settled at New Italy, but, by indomitable perse-
verance and thrifty habits, succeeded in clearing small areas of
heavily-timbered land, and building comfortable homes. ithin the
last few years they have planted mulberries, reared silkworms, and


produced excellent reeled silk; and when it becomes possible to
establish a market for dried cocoons in Europe and Asia, the Italians
will doubtless enter as largely into the business as their means will
permit. These worthy people had been accustomed to silk culture in
Italy, and were more than surprised at the ease with which the silk-
worm can be reared here compared with the difficulties at home. A
lady, resident in Sydney, who takes a great interest in the estab-
lishment of sericulture in this Colony, recently obtained some reeled
silk from New Italy and forwarded it to the well-known silk manu-
facturer, Prat Salle, Yilleurbonne Rhone, near Lyons. In order that
the best opinion respecting this silk might be given, the services
of an expert were obtained. The report sent was to this effect: —
“ This silk loses a little less than our own silk in its manufacture, not
quite such a good quality as the best French silk, but it is a little less
nervous, and it would be intermediate between the silk of the Cevennes
and the silk of Japan. What you sent me was too little to judge
what we could give per kilo. For the silk reeled which you sent me
the price, net, would perhaps be 38 francs per kilo. I hope your
efforts will be successful in the splendid enterprise of the production
of silk. The silk carried well and was clean and regular.”
One of the settlers at New Italy succeeded, after wonderful per-
severance, in erecting a small silk hand-loom with its various appli-
ances, and has manufactured small pieces of silk fabric from the
cocoons raised at the settlement, which is the first, as far as is known,
that has been manufactured in Australia.
Some two years ago an association was formed in Sydney under
the energetic management of Mrs. Sanger Evans, termed the Women’s
Silk Growing Association, having for its objects the growing of the
mulberry, the production of silk, and the raising of fruits and vege-
tables, to be managed and worked as far as possible by women.
Some land was purchased at Wyee, near the railway line from Sydney
to Newcastle, and about 1,000 mulberries were planted recently.
Sufficient time has not yet elapsed to determine the success or other-
wise of this philanthropic association.
In consequence of an exhaustive report on Sericulture in New
South Wales, published by direction of the Minister for Mines and
Agriculture, a considerable impetus was given to the industry, not
only in this Colony, but in the adjoining colonies as well, and much
attention is at the present time being devoted to the subject.
Thousands of mulberry plants have been raised at the State Nursery,
Gosford, and distributed to applicants free of charge by the Govern-
ment, who also secured the services of Mr. Charles Brady. An
agreement was made with that gentleman by which he engaged to
instruct certain persons in his system of successional rearings. Under
this system it is possible to rear successive crops of the annual silk-
worm throughout the year, if desired, or as long as food may be
available. In some portions of this Colony some varieties of mulberry
bear leaf throughout the year, and in other parts leaf may be relied
upon for nine or ten months of the year. The benefits likely to be
gained from carrying out Mr. Brady’s system must be obvious when
it is known that in the chief silk-producing countries in the world
only one crop of the annual silkworm is reared during the year. It

may be mentioned tliat other species of silkworms known as hi-
voltine or mnltivoltine hatch out twice or several times during the
year, but they are liable to degenerate and their produce does not
compare favourably with that of the annual silkworm.
Under the usual method of raising one crop only, it is clear that all
the appliances for rearing that crop must be idle for the greater
portion of the year, whereas, on the other hand, provided there be a
sufficient supply of mulberry leaf, under the method of successive
rearings, those appliances, the rearing shed, &c., can be kept con-
stantly occupied and in use.
In January, 1894, operations were begun at an old mulberry plantation
at Booral, near Stroud, about 25 miles north of Raymond Terrace.
This plantation, of about 7 acres, was made by the Australian
Agricultural Company for the purpose of inducing settlers to take up
the industry, and silkworms were reared to some extent, but the pro-
ject was abandoned after a short time, and the plantation became
greatly neglected. The Government leased this property at a nominal
rent, as many of the mulberries appeared to be sufficiently vigorous to
justify a start being made there.
Thanks to the liberality of an Italian gentleman. Signor Martelli,
who many years ago had made great efforts to establish sericulture
in Victoria, but without success, a good start was made with the
industry. He has lately resided at Fiji, and visiting Sydney on
a journey to Italy, happened to read press comments on the report
on sericulture before mentioned. His interest in the subject revived,
and desiring to assist as much as possible in promoting it, procured
in Italy, and brought out successfully, a fine supply of the best
varieties of Italian silkworm eggs. These he presented to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and Mr. Brady took in hand their rearing; and
notwithstanding the poor shed accommodation at the Booral plan-
tation, and the indifferent quality of the mulberry leaf, owing to the
generally neglected condition of the trees, the results of the rearing
were satisfactory; the silkworms acclimated, and a splendid stock of
graine secured for future requirements.
It may be mentioned that the main object at Booral is an educational
one, the intentions of the Government being to enable persons having
a real desire to acquire a knowledge of the arts contributory to the
rearing of silkworms to acquire the practical knowledge and experi-
ence up to the stages in which they have been developed in Australia.
One of the inhabitants at Booral, Mr. S. Carnell, a local landholder,
on witnessing the various operations which were carried on in the old
shed, placed his property at the disposal of the Government, and
engaged to erect improvements required, and to lease the whole to the
Government on very favourable terms. The demonstrations made in
consequence have proved most attractive; many preconceived but
erroneous ideas have been eradicated; more just appreciation has taken
the place of prejudice and doubts, and the utility of such an establish-
ment is already upheld. The rearing of successive crops is in full
operation, and will continue as long as there is food available.
Intending pupils who wish to acquire a mastery of the art of raising
silk for commercial purposes should make application to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

In order to give an idea of the enormous value of the silk industry
to France and Italy, the following tables from Mnlhall , “ Dictionary of
Statistics,” edition, 1892, are given.
The balance-sheet (France) of the silk industry since 1830 was
approximately as follows :
In 1820 the number of mulberry trees was 9,632,000 ; in 1835 the
number of mulberry trees was 14,880,000; in 1884 the number of
mulberry trees was 6,100,000.




SANSOON TOBACCO (CIGARETTE),
Growing at Department of Agriculture, Sydney.


Tobacco Culture.
BY SAMUEL LAMB, Department of Agriculture.
The history of tobacco-growing in this Colony dates back to very
early times. Mr. Ed. Hardy, now residing near Nabiac, on tire
Wollamba River, told me that lie well remembered being employed
in the tobacco-fields on the Hastings River more than sixty-five years
ago; that large quantities of tobacco leaf were then grown and
cured there, pressed in wool-presses into wmolpacks, and shipped
away by sea from Port Macquarie, he thought, to England or Scot-
land. How far Mr. Hardy's memory served him correctly I have
no means of verifying, but it is common knowledge that tobacco
was grown on most of the old sheep stations for the purpose of
making sheep-dip, and tobacco plants are even now growing wild in
the neighbourhood of many old sheep-runs. These plants are not of
any Australian species or varieties, but evidently of American origin.
Especially in the northern coastal districts, from the Hunter up to
the Tweed, tobacco plants of American origin are to be found every-
where, occasionally, as at Tintinbar, Richmond River, in great pro-
fusion and growing luxuriantly, some plants attaining the height of
10 feet.
It is not easy to identify the variety from which these wild plants
are derived; having been long uncultivated, they have reverted to-
wards the original type of wild tobacco discovered by the Spaniards at
Yucatan when they raided Mexico nearly four centuries ago, but the
difference in soil and climate has somewhat modified their character.
There are four, possibly five, different tobaccos indigenous to Aus-
tralia, not one of which has any commercial value. Nicotiana
Suaveolens is a very pretty plant, having leaves of a deep green colour.
The flower-stalk is about 2 feet high, and bears numerous almost
pure white trumpet-shaped flowers, which, in the evenings and early
mornings, give out a very delicate perfume, but close up in the heat
and glare of midday. It is found in abundance under the shade of
oak trees, on the steep banks of creeks, in the upland valleys of the
table-land. It is very hardy; has long, tough, running roots ; flowers
in October, and produces a succession of blooms for several months;
it is subject to the attacks of the same insects that injure tobacco in
cultivation for commercial purposes. The finest specimen of this plant
I have seen was growing in a lane off the main street at Gunnedah last
year. In some parts of Queensland it attains a much larger growth,
and invades the cultivation, from which it is difficult to eradicate it. It
is worthy of a place in any flower-garden, and is grown in hothouses
in England as an ornamental plant.


Many localities in New South Wales have at various times enjoyed
a good reputation for the tobacco they have grown —the Hunter River
and its tributaries, notably Jerry’s Plains, Paterson, Alleyn Brook, the
Williams, Glendon Brook, Bandon Grove, and the district around
Dungog. At one time tobacco seemed to have established itself as a
permanent industry at and around Tumut, which place has often been
credited with having produced the best tobacco yet grown in the
Colony. Very large plantings were also made in the Tarcutta district,
lying west of Gundagai. The district around Bathurst also grew
large crops of tobacco, while a great portion of Nemingha Flat, near
Tamworth, was at one time under this crop.
The northern coastal district has always sent more or less tobacco
to Sydney.
But of late years tobacco-growing has lost favour with Australian
farmers, and has fallen into the hands of the Chinese, while the
manufacture of tobacco, which was carried on in a number of small
factories in country districts, has ceased almost entirely, and is now
for the most part concentrated in Sydney.
The farmers and those who formerly manufactured tobacco on a
small scale are of one mind in denouncing the Tobacco Acts of 1884
and 1885 as the cause of what they term the ruin of the industry. I
have constantly endeavoured to combat this opinion, which is not
founded on a true appreciation of the facts. Ido not deny that the
imposition of the excise duty, with its accompanying regulations and
restrictions, has had some influence in producing the result; but Ido
say and maintain that there have been many other causes at work
exerting much greater force. The small factories in country districts
were bound to go down before the competition of the big firms in
Sydney, which have a greater command of capital, cheaper and more
constant supply of labour, and whose working expenses and cost of
supervision are, in proportion to turnover, 60 per cent, less than those
of the small manufacturer.
The same thing occurred in England at a time when the tobacco
trade was most prosperous. During a period when the consumption
of tobacco more than doubled, the number of manufacturers’ licenses
issued decreased by nearly 10 per cent. The small concerns were
swamped by the competition of the big ones, and had to shut up.
Our farmers complain that they cannot now get a fair price for
their leaf, and some of them lose their tempers when I tell them that
this is the consequence of their own action and the effect of a law
which has always been in operation, and can never be repealed or
altered.
Paradoxical as it may at first sight appear, I have no hesitation in
affirming that the exceeding profitableness of the crop has had more
to do with what is called the “Ruin of the Industry” than all the other
causes put together. It is the action of a natural law that, so long
as a crop is unusually profitable, more people plant it every year.
When tobacco is at 7d. or Bd. per lb. “the farmer plants who never
did before, and he who always planted plants the more,” and if the
quantity required for consumption remains the same, or does not
increase in proportion, the supply soon overtakes the demand, and
prices have to come down.


What are the facts ? The annual consumption of tobacco in New
South Wales is about 3,000,000 lb., of which about one-third is
imported in a manufactured state and about 600,000 lb. in the leaf.
The remainder, say, 1,400,000 lb., is therefore of our own growth;
that is to say, that about 45 per cent, of the tobacco which pays duty
is colonially grown. This does not include the very considerable quan-
tity which escapes payment of duty. In tobacconists’ shops in
Sydney and Newcastle, and in some other towns, tobacco-leaf is
openly sold at from Bd. to Is. per lb. Consumers purchase this free
of duty, and make it up for their own use and that of their friends.
The quantity thus disposed of must be very considerable. Every
grower of tobacco-leaf makes up some for his own use and to give to
his friends; this also pays no duty, and does not appear on the
statistics. We may therefore fairly assume that the average annual
consumption of tobacco of native growth in this Colony is about
2,000,000 lb., or 17,800 hundredweights. (I turn this into hundred-
weights because Mr. Coghlan’s statistics are in hundredweights.) This
quantity does not vary much from year to year, and is not increasing.
Now let us take the production from Mr. Coghlan’s (( Statistical
Register” :
The crop of 1884 was 20,006 cwt.
„ 1885 „ 9,914 cwt.
~ 1886 ~ 22,917 cwt.
~ 1887 „ 13,642 cwt.
66,509 - 4 = 1G,627j.
Add them together and divide by four to find the mean, which is
16,627 cwt., or about 1,200 cwt. less than the average consumption;
stocks became exhausted, and the price rose to B|d, and upwards, with
the result that the production for the three succeeding years was— ■
1888— cwt.
1889— cwt.
1890 — 27,721 cwt.
106,671 - 3 = 35,557 cwt.,
or almost exactly double the quantity required to supply the average
consumption; consequently prices went down, needy growers were
compelled to sell at any price they could get, and the planting was
reduced to very small proportions, accordingly the production for the
three following years was —
1891— cwt.
1892 — 9,311 cwt.
1893 — 8,341 cwt.
31,679 -f- 3 = 10,559 cwt. average,
or about 7,241 cwt. per annum less than is required for the annual
consumption. Stocks are now again becoming exhausted, and a time
of higher prices may confidently be looked for.
So it is clear that the industry is not ruined, but is only suffering
from over-production for a limited market, consequent on the exceed-
ing profitableness of the crop.
L


That the crop is a very profitable one is clear. I have put the ques-
tion to a great number of tobacco-growers as to what price would leave
a profit, and in almost every instance have had for reply that if there
was a sure sale at 4d. per lb. they would always put in an acre or two.
Many men, now in good circumstances, have told me that they made
their first rise in tobacco-growing, but perhaps the most notable ex-
ample of success in this industry is that of the late Mr. Holtz, of Glen-
don Brook, who purchased a freehold farm for £BOO, and received
exactly £BOO for the crop from 16 acres of tobacco grown on it the
first year. A few years later he planted acres, and sold the crop
for £1,340.
It would be easy to multiply instances of large profits, but enough
has been said to show that in a fairly good season tobacco-growing* is
so profitable that whenever the price reaches 6d. per lb. more is pro-
duced than can be sold; a glut ensues as a matter of course, and prices
go down until planting ceases and the glut is worked off again.
Is there any remedy ? Yes, I answer, more than one. The first and
most obvious one is to so far improve the quality of our product that
it will be saleable in the open markets of Europe, so that when a crop
exceeds the requirements of our colonial consumption the surplus can
be exported at a profit. This is a remedy that will act in two ways,
because if our tobacco can be so far improved as to be saleable outside
the Colony, it will be good enough to take the place of the 1,700,000 lb.
which we now import, and when that is the case the growers will be
able to demand a much higher price than heretofore. If we can raise
tobacco that will sell for Bd. per lb. in London, Bremen, or Antwerp,
it ought to be worth Is. Bd. per lb. here, because of the Customs duty
of Is. per lb., which has to be paid on imported leaf tobacco coming’
into the Colony. As things are the tobacco-grower does not get the
benefit of the protection afforded by this duty, but only gets from 3d.
to 4d. per lb. for leaf which costs him nearly as much to grow. If
there is any benefit at all it goes to the manufacturers and dealers.
Another question arises as to whether the desired improvement in
quality is possible, whether we have soil and climate which will produce
tobacco fit for European markets.
The great variety of soils and climates in Hew South Wales renders
it a reasonable expectation that some localities may be found in which
very choice tobacco can be grown, and my experience here has justified
the expectation, affording sufficient proof that there are localities in
this Colony capable of producing high-class tobacco of each of the
three principal grades, namely, for cigar-making, for cigarette-making’,
and for manufacturing into plug for pipe-smoking.
I think that I have shown that until we can produce tobacco fit for
export we shall not be able to avoid the great fluctuations in prices which
have been the chief bar to the establishment of tobacco-growing in
Hew South Wales as a permanent source of wealth and prosperity.
The question naturally presents itself as to whether there are markets
abroad which would form an outlet for our surplus tobacco, and I
think that this question can be answered in the affirmative very shortly
and very conclusively. England is a great buyer of tobacco ; she
requires a supply of about 2,000 cwt. daily, and wants it good; she
grows none herself, and has to depend on outside sources for her


supplies. There is, perhaps, no other place in the world where
common tobacco can be bought so cheaply. I have seen larg*e parcels
sold in London at prices varying from |d. to 2d. per lb.; such tobacco
she does not consume very largely, it is mostly exported. On the
other hand, there is no place, except perhaps Moscow or St. Peters-
burg, where such high prices are paid for exceptionally fine, or what
are sometimes called fancy, tobaccos. I have seen as high as 4s. 3d.
per Ib. paid for fine Borneo cigar wrappers, and a -small lot of 600 Hj.
of fine cigarette leaf was sold for 12s. per lb. exclusive of the duty,
which is Bs. 2d. per lb. The buyer in both cases was well satisfied
with his bargain, and made substantial profits, as well as increased
his reputation by the purchases. Indeed, there never has been a time
when really fine tobaccos were not readily saleable in London.
Besides London, Dublin, and Glasgow, there are very large markets
in Bremen, Antwerp, Hamburg*, and Amsterdam, whose requirements
far exceed those of the English trade, and then the Government
factories of France, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and some minor European
States, are large importers of tobacco leaf.
It is first to England, and then to Europe generally, that we should
look for markets for our tobacco, and there is no valid reason why
Australian tobacco should not be as welcome in the Old World as
Australian wool has become.
Then, again, we have Federation slowly but surely advancing, and,
if Hew South Wales is true to herself and uses her opportunities
wisely, she ought to supply tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes to the
Federated Australian Colonies.
But, before this vision can become a fact, there is much to be done.
Naturally enough, every tobacco-grower would like to grow good
leaf, but very few Australian tobacco-growers have ever had a correct
idea of what constitutes good tobacco. The common notion is that
the biggest is the best, and I have found it difficult to combat this idea.
Until a true ideal is instilled into the farmer’s mind he will continue
to work up to the false one, and go on producing big, heavy leaf,
which is now almost entirely out of fashion.
There are five points in judging tobacco : the first, flavour ; second,,
colour ; third, texture ; fourth, burning ; fifth, size of leaf. The only
one our tobacco-growers regard is the last, and least important.
Another cause for our want of success in tobacco-growing is the
continual use of colonially-grown seed. In other crops the farmers
change their seed frequently, because it is apt to run out; but in
tobaceo they go on growing plants from their own seed year after
year on the same soil. The tobacco consequently acquires a character
of its own, and its peculiarities become exaggerated.
Again, in the eagerness for a heavy crop, tobacco has almost
always been planted in the richest river flats. Now, I have constantly
pointed out that the best tobacco cannot be grown on these rich flats,
which can only produce big, fat leaf of low commercial value, and I
have constantly urged tobacco-growers to try the second bottoms on
the upper reaches of the rivers and creeks. I was speaking on this
point at West Maitland three years ago, and Mr. Buxton, the manager of
the tobacco factory there, who has had fifty years of tobacco experience


in the Colony, said that he had always found the tobacco from the
upland valleys much filter, both in flavour and colour, than that grown
on the lower flats.
The A ictorian Government sent Mr. Sinclair to America last year
to inquire and report on the cultivation of sugar-beet and tobacco.
In his report, page 37, he says : —'“ It is not on these rich bottoms
that the best tobacco in Kentucky is grown, as might be expected.
Here the farmer has his corn patch. For the tobacco crop the upland
slope, if not too steep and not liable to be washed or scoured, to the
loss of soil or plants, and the elevated flat portion of the rising*
ground is cleared of timber for tobacco-growing. In this upland,
undulating timber country the finest tobacco is produced/’
The example of Java is also very much to the point. There are two
classes of Java leaf sold in Europe. One brings 6d. to Bd. per lb.,
and the other from 2s. to 3s. per lb. The former is grown in alter-
nation with rice on the flats, the other in the upland valleys.
If we will persist in growing from the same seed year after year
on these rich flats, there is no help for it, the leaf will g*et bigger,
stronger, and coarser every year, until at last it becomes unsaleable.
At an early stage of my Australian experience, I used to insist that
tobacco should not follow tobacco year after year on the same soil. I
still hold to that opinion as a general rule; but lam bound to admit
that there are exceptions in which better tobacco has been grown in
the third and fourth years than in the first and second on the same
land, but they are exceptions. The growers had waged successful war
with the weeds, grubs, and caterpillars that infested the land when
newly cleared, so that, as the land became cleaned and sweetened by
constant tillage and care, it yielded better crops of better tobacco year
after year. But, as a rule, it is far better to alternate the tobacco crop
with a grain or fodder crop.
There is another matter which has worked against the tobacco
industry—it is the want of an efficient organisation for the disposal of
the crop when harvested and matured. Two brothers cultivated
tobacco on the halves on a certain piece of ground. WTien the crop
was fit for market it was evenly divided into two portions, one brother
sent his share down to Sydney, and it was sold at sd. per lb. The
other sent his to the same firm a fortnight later with a letter, pointing
out its excellent quality, and it was sold at 6|d.
The practice of sending small lots of tobacco to be sold at auction
at the produce sales amongst pumpkins, maize, potatoes, hay, chaff,
and onions, is altogether bad. It is not worth a manufacturer’s while
to keep a man to go round every day to look for and buy these little
parcels, so the middleman or jobber comes in and makes a big profit
for any small lots of good tobacco that come up for sale. We want
some system by which we can ensure a fair price being obtained for
every parcel of well-grown, well-cured, and well-assorted leaf sent to
Sydney, so that careful growers might be encouraged to even greater
care ; but while it is a mere chance what price he gets, no man cares
to bestow much labour in putting up his crop for market.
Another difficulty which we have to contend with is the uncertainty
of the seasons. There have been times when it has been possible to


cure tobacco in tbe open air, without a shed of any sort, simply
scaffolding it on poles in the field, and chancing the weather; but, of
course, this is very risky.
A grower at the foot of the Toowoomba Range, Queensland, told
me that he had harvested a crop by simply cutting it down and letting
it lie on the ground till dry, turning it every two or three hours.
When sufficiently dry, ho carted it to the shed and stacked it; there it
cured itself in a little over a fortnight. He said that the crop cost him
£l6 per ton and sold for £37. I only accept this with a grain of salt—
it is possible , perhaps, but the chances are a thousand to one against.
The uncertainty of the seasons in Hew South Wales renders the
proper curing of tobacco a matter of much difficulty. I have examined
many hundreds of samples of tobacco grown in this Colony, and in the
great majority of them I have found mildew on the stems or on the
tips and margins of the leaves. In many of the samples the mildew
was plainly apparent, in others only to be discovered by the aid of a
magnifying glass or being subjected to moisture for a few hours. When
mildew once becomes established it can never be entirely destroyed.
Even after the most skilful treatment at very high temperatures it
will reassert itself when it is placed in a moist atmosphere. The
effect of this fungus is to destroy the natural aroma of the tobacco.
In a favourable curing season it does not make its appearance, but if
a few damp days intervene while the leaf is in a partially dried state
it is very apt to be developed, sometimes very rapidly. If a week or
two of such rains as we frequently experience should occur, nothing
but fire can save the tobacco. It was because Mr. Holtz, of Grlendon
Brook, knew this, and provided against the contingency, that he could
always sell his tobacco at the top price of the market. He built very
ample sheds and provided abundance of suitable wood for fuel, and on
the occurrence of rain lit a number of fires in each shed, and kept them
constantly going as long as the damp weather continued.
The curing of tobacco by the natural air process occupies from five
to nine weeks in ordinary seasons; but there is a process of drying
by artifically heated air, by which it can be accomplished within a
week. This process was employed, though with very imperfect and
makeshift appliances, by Mr. Hungerford and Messrs. Rose, of
Baerami, under my directions, with very fair results, last year, and is to
be thoroughly tested this season at the experiment stations at Moonbi
and Nemingha. If it proves a success (as I have every reason to
believe it will), mildew can be banished from New South Wales
tobacco-sheds. One very important question to be proved is whether
tobacco cured by this process will retain the texture that is wanted in
cigar wrappers, and if not, whether any modification of the process
will be possible to secure that texture.
The Department of Agriculture is making great efforts to assist the
development of an export trade in tobacco. Not only is the new sys-
tem of fire-curing to be thoroughly tested, but seed has been obtained
of many choice varieties of tobacco, which are being acclimatised at
the experiment farms which are being established in various parts of
the Colony. Some of these new tobaccos promise very well, in spite of
the dry season. It is very desirable that no tobacco-leaf shall be sent
from this Colony to foreign markets, except the very best we can


IDroduce. We cannot hope, or even wish, to compete in the supply of
..ow-grade tobaccos against the cheap labour of other tobacco-produc-
ing countries, and, as we can grow high-class leaf, it would not be
wisdom to grow the inferior grades.
I have already spoken of the want of an organisation for placing
the crops of small growers on the Sydney market, so as to secure to
the grower the fair market value of his leaf. In the development of
an export trade the want of some system will be even more sharply
felt, especially in its earlier stages. The capitalist who goes in for
tobacco-growing on a large scale by hired labour may well be left to
take care of his own interests; but in this Colony, at least for some
years to come, tobacco will chiefly be grown in plots of acre to 3
acres by farmers having families of boys, and to enable such to ship
their crops, some organisation will be required, and this, I think,
should be undertaken by the State. It is palpable that isolated ship-
ments of a few bales of tobacco, sent by individual growers, would be
at a great disadvantage on arriving at a new market, where it would be
quite unknown. Small lots of unknown tobacco would not be worth the
notice of any of the larger firms, and would only be taken up by a few
of the smallest class of manufacturers, and by them only at very cheap
prices. It will, therefore, be necessary to collect these small crops into
a large shipment (of some thousands of bales, if possible) so as to
challenge the attention of the largest firms of manufacturers.
There will be difficulties in the way, of course. Any plan which
proposes to establish a new source of wealth, and does not present
difficulties, would scarcely be worth considering. It has been in over-
coming difficulties that the best features in the Australian character
have been manifested.
About five years ago, in a conversation I had with Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith as to the best means of developing the tobacco industry
in Queensland, I urg*ed strongly the advantages that would accrue to
the Colony if the tobacco trade was made into a State monopoly, on
lines somewhat similar to the French Regie system. I pointed out that
the trade was then drifting into what was, or would shortly become,
practically a private monolopy —hostile alike to the interests of tobacco-
growers and to tobacco consumers. That the American Tobacco Trust
was using great endeavours to secure a monopoly of the Australian
tobacco trade, and was on the high road to success in regard to one
portion of it—namely, the cigarette business, which was large, and
rapidly increasing. I pointed out that a monopoly, owned and con-
trolled in the United States of America, could not be to the advantage
of Australians, but served only to enrich Americans at our expense.
• ar-n-4 1/
Sir ihomas promised to consider the matter, but said the time was
scarcely opportune.
Since then the American Tobacco Trust has virtually established a
monopoly in cigarettes in all the Australian colonies, and, I am
informed, is working to secure the control of the tobacco trade also.
I think that a modification of the French Regie system would be of
great service in New South Wales at the present time.
Very briefly, the French Regie system is as follows: —It is enacted
that the growth, manufacture, and merchandise of tobacco or any of
its products shall be carried on solely for the benefit of the State.


Tlie Regie owns all the factories, machinery, utensils employed in the
industry, and also all the stocks of tobacco, whether manufactured or
in the leaf, or in process of manufacture.
The director of the Regie at a fixed date in each year estimates the
quantity of home-grown leaf which will be required for the supply of
the factories in the year following, and he fixes the price to be paid
for it in three classes —first quality, second quality, and third quality.
The director decides which of the provinces of the empire shall be
permitted to grow tobacco, and what proportion of the total quantity
required shall be grown in each of the selected provinces. This
decision is published by proclamation and advertisement-. Farmers
i t ,
who are desirous of growing tobacco for the Regie make application to
the officer appointed in each district, and the quantity allotted to the
district is divided equally amongst the applicants, who must be bond
fide cultivators of the soil, and be provided with the proper appliances
for cultivating and curing the quantity of tobacco allotted to them.
The largest area allowed to any one applicant is a little over 3 acres.
Licenses to grow tobacco are issued to the successful applicants, who
enter into bond and give security that all the tobacco grown shall, when
harvested and cured, be delivered into the depots of the Regie, which
are established in each of the tobacco-growing districts, and to utterly
destroy by fire, in the presence of an appointed officer, all damaged and
unripe tobacco, and to uproot and destroy all growing plants which
remain after the harvesting.
When the crop is harvested, cured, and properly classed into Ist,
2nd, and 3rd, it is to be delivered at the depot, where it is received and
examined by the officer appointed to that duty, who gives the cultivator
a docket, stating the weight and classification of the tobacco received by
him. The cultivator takes the docket to the office or treasury of the
depot, and there and then receives prompt cash payment for his leaf.
Cultivators who desire to grow tobacco for export, apply in the same
way, but receive a different form of license, and enter into a different
bond.
Under such a system there is no possibility of a glut in the market;
no more leaf is permitted to be grown than is required. The price is
fixed before the license is issued, so that the grower knows what he is
likely to receive. The only chance is that in a good season he gets a
heavier crop containing a larger proportion of first quality, and in a
bad season a smaller crop containing a larger proportion of second and
third quality. The careful cultivator has the advantage that he has
always a larger proportion of first quality in his crop than the careless
grower has, and he always gets the full value of what he delivers. The
State factories having no competition to face, have no interest in
paying second price for first quality.
In its relation to the consumer the State factory having no private
interests to serve will have no inducement to accept or manufacture
inferior or damaged leaf, and will, therefore, always turn out sound,
good tobacco. At the same time, as tobacco manufacturing is a very
profitable business, States which have adopted the Regie system have
found it to yield a large and increasing revenue.
I think that some modification of this system would be very helpful
in establishing this important industry on a satisfactory footing.


Timbers of the Colony.
BY J. H. MAIDEN, F.L.S., Superintendent of Technical Education, &c.
The Geographical Conditions of the Colony as regards the availahleness
of her Timber Supply.
Without entering into tlie much-debated question as to tlie extent
of the relation of cause and effect between forests and rainfall, we
may state that, roughly speaking, the rainfall of New South W ales
gradually diminishes from the coast-line to her western boundary,,
while the altitude and denseness of the forest vegetation diminishes
in a similar direction. The general forest conditions of the rich-soil
gullies of the intervening mountains and elevated table-lands a good
deal resemble those of the coast belt.
What is known as the Dividing Range forms a huge vertebral
column, whose general direction is north and south, extending through
nearly the whole length of the Colony. This range is roughly parallel
to the coast, and at no great distance from it. As far as the com-
mercial timbers of the Colony are concerned, it separates the territory
into two divisions, —the first comprising the eastern slopes and the
comparatively flat country thence to the sea, which yields the great
bulk of our readily available forest wealth, while the country to the
west produces timber available only for utilisation in the districts in
which it is grown, partly because of its inferiority of size and value
(with a few notable exceptions), and partly because of the cost of
land-carriage to the coast. In considering the availableness of the-
western timbers, it must be borne in mind that none of our rivers,,
flowing east and west, are of any great length, because of the proximity
to the sea of the Dividing Range already alluded to, and therefore
the advantages of cheap water-carriage between the inland forest
regions and the coast are not available.
Brush and open Forest.
The timber-trees of New South Wales are found, for the most part,
in either what are called brushes or open forests. The brush perhaps
corresponds to what in India would be called jungle, and consists
of well-watered, rich-soil areas in the coast districts, which not only
support rich arboreal vegetation, but also creepers and climbers of
various kinds, and shrubby undergrowth. The tree-vegetation is of a

WALES TIMBERS FOR LONDON, SEPTEMBER, 1895.




most varied character, but rarely includes Eucalypts. In open forests,
on the other hand, Eucalypts form the prevailing vegetation in the
coast districts, and frequently attain a great size. As compared with
biush foiests the soil is less rich and moist. Of the open forest timbers
(including she-oaks, cypress pine, &c.), we may say that we possess
a fair knowledge; it is mainly in regard to the brush-timbers that
our knowledge is defective. This results from a variety of causes.
In brushes the variety of trees is very great, and they are less gre-
garious than those of the open forest. There is a good deal of uni-
formity in the barks of the trees, a nearly smooth bark being of
very common occurrence, while the trees are so close together, that
their leafy tops intertwine, and it is impossible, in many cases, to get
a fair idea of the shape and general appearance of a particular tree.
Only those who have visited our dense northern brush forests can form
an idea of the difficulty of distinguishing more than a few kinds of
trees. The massive trees, wonderfully vertical, remind one of cathe-
dral columns; craning the neck for an upward view in the dim forest
light is inconvenient and even painful, and results in only general
impressions, while if a gun be fired with the view of bringing down a
twig for purposes of identification, the probability is that it cannot be
stated, with certainty, from what particular tree the specimen has
fallen. If one cuts through a tree, it very often happens that other
trees prevent its falling down, and thus its leafy top is not available
for examination.
Botanical Classification ofi Trees.
The principal forest vegetation of the Colony consists of trees
belonging to the genus Eucalyptus. Those which have smooth (or
comparatively smooth) trunks are known as gums, and this term is
qualified by adjectives such as white, blue, and red. A white gum
has a white trunk. A blue gum has a trunk or leaves (or both) with
a bluish cast. A red gum has the timber red, and so on. Others
have rough bark, thus those with a rugged, hard bark (accompanied
by a timber of great hardness and durability) are known as iron-
barks; those with a thick, fibrous bark (accompanied by a timber
which is very fissile) are known as stringybarks. The common names
for the various kinds of Eucalypts are very numerous, and they vary
so much in different localities, and also for the same tree, that an
accurate knowledge of them can only be acquired by much travel and
study.
The natural allies of Eucalyptus are the other genera belonging to
the Myrtaceae, of which the principal are Angophora (apple-trees),
Syncarpia (turpentine), Tristania (brush-box and water gum),
Melaleuca (tea-trees), and Eugenia (myrtles).
The next genus to Eucalyptus in point of number of arboreal species
is Acacia, which includes many trees generally known simply as wattles,
or qualified by the prefix black, green, silver, golden, broad-leaved,
weeping, &c. Other Acacias are known as hickory, blackwood, myall,
boree, mulg’a, brigalow, dead finish, sally, gidgee, yarran, ironwood,
and a host of other names. The Acacias rarely form forest trees of the
largest size.

During 1894 we exported 46,000 spokes and 9,600 felloes to Victoria
and 31,500 spokes to South Australia. The exports of these articles
to New Zealand approximately equal those to Victoria. “ Felloes and
spokes ” are enumerated in the Customs statistics under the heading
of “ Carriage-makers’ materials.” Hubs and naves are included in
the same classification, but no figures are available as to the imports
and exports of those articles.
Following are some statistics re our saw-mills, &c., for the years
1892 to 1894:
We now proceed to a more particular examination of tlie various
kinds of our timbers.
Hardwoods .
After ironbark, a convenient practical classification of our liardwoods
is into ff Pale hardwoods/ 5 hardwoods 55 (both these comprising’
the commercial or best hardwoods of the Colony), and the inferior or
doubtful hardwoods.
Ironbark stands alone as the embodiment of the combination of a
number of qualities valued in a timber, viz., hardness, strength, and
durability. It may he called the king of New South Wales timbers.
It is extensively used in bridge-construction, for railway sleepers, for
posts, for shafts, framing, &c., by the waggon and carriage builder;
for large beams in buildings, particularly in stores for heavy goods—
in a word, wherever great strength is required. For such purposes as
railway sleepers it will last an indefinite period, and in many cases has
only to be taken up, not because it shows signs of decay from exposure
on the permanent way, or disintegration because of the vibration to


which it has been subjected, but because holes have been made in the
sleeper by the renewal of bolts and spikes. Sleepers which have
borne the heaviest traffic of the main line near Sydney for twenty-five
years are now as sound as the day they were laid. While by no means
a scarce timber, it is in such active local demand (particularly for
railway purposes), that it would appear not to be desirable to actively
stimulate an export trade in it.
Pale Hardiuoods.
Timbers of this character are to a certain extent under a cloud in
Europe. The reason is that some of our inferior timbers —those which
we in New South Wales would never use except for inferior or tem-
porary purposes, and which are of a pale colour —have been exported
under misleading names. The man who substitutes an inferior timber
for a superior one specified, trusting to the ignorance of the purchaser
or his inspector not to detect the substitution, is gmilty of dishonesty,
and I believe the ordinary machinery of the Courts is quite adequate
to deal with conduct of this kind. But the best remedy lies in the
spread of knowledge in regard to our timbers, and meantime, if a
purchaser lacks the knowledge, he should employ a timber expert to
inspect for him. A business man, as a rule, obtains expert opinion in
regard to the quality of a line he is buying if necessary, and if this
principle be applied to timbers, the death-stroke to substitution would
be given. I would like to emphasise what I look upon as a great truth,
that is, that one of the main reasons why colonial timbers are not more
used is because users are nervous through ignorance. I have no
intention of touching upon the fiscal question, but I will express the
opinion that if it be desired to stimulate the use of our indigenous
timbers, and conversely, to discourage the use of imported ones, the
best plan will be the diffusion of knowledge concerning the trees in
our forests. How many persons in this Colony, learned in Oregon,
redwood, spruce, Baltic, and so on, could turn over a heap of sawn
stuff from our mills, name the timbers, and then state the most
approved uses for them ? The present is not a suitable occasion foi
discussing the various ways by which a knowledge of our timbers
may be diffused, but the question is connected with our national
prosperity, and X should be lacking in my duty if I failed to emphasise
the point on every occasion that presents itself.
One of our best pale hardwoods is the blackbutt ( E. pilularis , Sm.),
a thoroughly safe and well-tried timber, and one so valuable for
wood-paving that if the municipal authorities of Europe and America
knew its real worth, an active demand would spring up for it. We,
in New South Wales, look upon this as a timber of the front rank for
wood-paving, and we have not only had extensive experience of wood-
paving, but also of the merits of our own timbers. Yet in Europe it
is mistrusted because of its pale colour !
White mahogany (E. acmenoides, Schau.) is also a valuable timber,
but comparatively few know of its merits, because it is often confused
with other timbers, particularly stringybark, confusion which has
resulted in the appraisement of the durability of stringybark at too
high a figure.


FOREST OF YOUNG BLACK-BUTTS, MANNING RIVER, NEW SOUTH WALES.
TALLOW-WOOD LOGS, BROUGHT FROM FOREST TO WHARF ON WOODEN
TRAIN-RAILS, MANNING RIVER, NEW SOUTH WALES.




The tallow-wood (E. microcorys, F.v.M.), which does not extend
south of the Hawkesbury River, is a picturesque tree. The timber is
so valuable (it is easily worked, is of good appearance, shrinks little,
and is very durable), that the opinion is generally held by experts
that, next to ironbark, it is our most valuable hardwood. When
freshly sawn it is of a canary-yellow (rarely reddish) colour, but its
most remarkable property is its greasy nature, which is turned to
practical account in the laying of ball-room floors.
Spotted gum (E. maculata , Hook, f.), a tree with a smooth bark,
with the outer layer peeling off in blotches, giving it a spotted
appearance, is found both north and south of Sydney. It is a timber
that has probably suffered both from unqualified praise, and from
unreasoning prejudice. Its sap-wood is worthless, being more ready
to decay than perhaps that of any other hardwood in Hew South
Wales; its heartwood is perhaps below the average as regards brittle-
ness. But, given mature spotted gum, with its sap and heart carefully
removed, it is an admirable timber, in some respects unrivalled
amongst colonial timbers. For toughness and elasticity it is simply
unrivalled amongst our hardwoods, rendering it a formidable rival to
American hickory for carriage-building. As regards its durability,
we have indisputable evidence of its value in such trying situations
as wood-pavements, tram-rails for logs from forest to mill, &c.
Grey box (E. hemiphloia, F.v.M.) is a tough, inlocked timber, really
valuable for purposes where these properties are brougdit into play.
For instance, it can be recommended with confidence to railway-carriage
builders and others, who require a strong, durable timber for framing,
&c. The pastoralist looks upon his tree with especial favour, as usually
indicative of good grazing country.
Bed Hardwoods. '■
Timbers of this class bear a good reputation for durability, con-
sequently we sometimes hear a person say a send me only red hard-
woods.” The idea has arisen because some of our Red Hardwoods are
amongst the most durable of our timbers, but it should not be forgotten
that timbers at least as durable are to be found amongst our Pale
Hardwoods. Consequently a purchaser who insists on a red timber,
limits his choice, and shuts himself out from what experts consider to
be the most durable of our timbers.
One of the best, and perhaps the best of our timbers belonging to
the Red class, is the so-called red mahogany (E. Sm.), a
rough-barked, handsome tree mostly found in the northern forests.
It resists destructive agencies of all kinds. It resembles the Western
Australian jarrah a good deal, and, in my carefully-formed opinion,
is quite as durable a timber. I have seen jarrah as well as red
mahogany attacked by cobra, but the mature timber of both trees is
excellent. Red mahogany has a rich, handsome colour, hence it is
used for substantial furniture.
Grey gum [E. propinqua, Deane and Maiden) is a timber which
resembles red ironbark a good deal, to which, however, it is inferior in
strength. Its durability is, however, notorious, and for such purposes
as posts, paving-blocks, &c., it can hardly be excelled. A drawback in


its liability to gum-veins, consequently large sizes are often defective.
Gum-veins of moderate size do not affect tbe durability of a timber,
and my advice to municipal authorities would be to encourage its use
for paving-blocks, kerbing, &c. The authorities of some country and
suburban municipalities, where suitable stone is not available, might
be reminded that many of our hardwoods form cheap, durable, and
neat kerbing. And in a township hardly anything is more important,
both for aesthetic and sanitary reasons, than well-defined roads and
paths. The grey gum is well known, amongst forest trees, by the dull
grey appearance of its bark, with irregular white blotches.
The Murray red gum {E. rostrata, Schlecht.) is chiefly found on the
flats, subject to inundation, adjacent to the rivers Murray, Edwards,
and other rivers and creeks near the New South Wales-Victorian
boundary. It is also found in the western districts, always either on
the banks of a river, or on land subject to inundation. The great
bulk of the Murray red gum forests are in New South Wales, and
are largely worked for the purpose of supplying Victorian demand.
In the southern colony it is used in enormous quantities for railway
sleepers, wood blocks, and other situations, such as for posts, house
blocks, &c., in which a very durable timber is necessary. A draw-
back to it is some tendency to shell off, which limits its uses for such
purposes as flooring and decking.
Closely allied to the preceding is the Forest red gum (E.
cornis, Sm.) which is found in open forests, and is not a riverside tree
like the preceding. As might be expected from its wide geographical
range, and the various soils in which it is found, it varies in quality,
but in most parts of the Colony the mature timber is of a very durable
character, and hence is used for posts in the ground, a severe test of
the durability of any timber. It is a tree that is often gnarled, and
shows unmistakable evidence on its trunk of the twisted, interlocked
character of its timber. It is consequently difficult to season, but it
is worth taking some pains over.
Both the Murray and Forest red gums are smooth-barked trees,
with the thin outer layer of bark falling off in small ribbons.
The Sydney blue gum [E. saligna, Sm.) is, for the most part, a
smooth-barked tree, but the lower part of the trunk has rough, fibrous
bark for a height which varies in different districts and situations. It
is usually found on the well-drained sides of hills, but a variety
(known as Flooded gum) usually frequents the banks of streams, or
land subject to inundation. In exceptional cases the two timbers
grow intermingled. The flooded gum yields a timber usually inferior
in quality to blue gum, and it must not be confused with the Murray
red gum, of which the name flooded gum is a synonym. The blue
gum of Tasmania and Victoria {E. globulus ) is a pale-coloured timber,
quite different in appearance to the Sydney blue gum, which is a red
timber usually paler in colour than red mahogany or red gum. It
is straight in the grain, comparatively easy to work, and therefore,
for a hardwood, a favourite with carpenters. It is the timber most
largely used in this Colony for felloes of wheels.
The Woollybutt {E. longifolia, Link, et Otto.), so called because
of the fibrous, woolly texture of its bark, is a tree that attains its best
development in the southern coast districts. It is not one of our best


timbers, being deficient in strength and elasticity; but it is a very
durable timber, and its defects are no drawback to its use for such
purposes as wood-paving.
Most people in the coast and coast mountain districts know a tree
with a scaly bark, which is often stained with a blood-like exudation.
This is the Bloodwood ( E.corymbosa, Sm.). It is usually faulty, owing
to the presence of gum-veins, but it has two important properties to
recommend it. One is that it is one of the most durable timbers in
the Colony, the other is that when the cut-end of a log is exposed to
the ardent rays of the sun it does not open out like most colonial
timbers. For posts, piles, timbers for culverts, wharfs, &c., it can be
safely recommended, its gum veins, unless very large, merely offending
the eye, and in no way affecting its durability. lam of opinion that
the presence of this gum (kino) is actually a preservative of the wood.
Supplementing* the timbers enumerated in these two great classes, I
may mention that we have four Stringybarks, which, however, are of
unequal quality, viz.:— E. obliqua, , and
eugenioides. The Yellow Box (E. melliodora) of the southern and
western districts is a tough and durable timber, but never available in
large sizes. The Red Box ( E. poly anthe a), which strongly resembles
ironbark in appearance, strength, and durability, is one of the most
valuable timbers the Colony produces, but it principally occurs on the
western side of the Dividing Range.
Inferior Hardwoods.
In this class we include those hardwoods which are of either
doubtful quality, or are inferior to those already enumerated.
White gums of various kinds (E. panel for a, E. hsemastoma, E.
viminalis), messmate (E. amygdalina), peppermint (E.
and E. piperita) , mountain ash (E. , swamp mahogany
(E. robusta) , bastard mahogany (E , mountain gum
goniocalyx) , apple fE. stuartiana), swamp gum fE. gunniij. Some
of these are timbers of fair value, e.g., mountain ash, swamp and
bastard mahogany, and mountain gum.
Closely allied to the Eucalypts are various hardwood trees known
as apple fAngophora) , myrtles (E , water gums
laurina and Rhodamnia), tea-trees (Melaleuca) , turpentine fSyn-
carpia), and brush box fTristania).
Botanically they all belong to the Natural Order Myrtacese, and
are confined to the coast and coast mountain districts. As a rule,
these timbers are of inferior quality because of their liability to shrink
and twist in seasoning, and of some tendency to dry rot, but I am of
opinion that they have been neglected because of the ready availability
of Eucalyptus timbers of high class. Two timbers, however, stand out
as possessing conspicuous merit, namely the turpentine ( Syncarpia
laurifolia, Ten.) and the brush box ( Tristania conferta, R.Br.).
Amongst the more immediate allies of the turpentine and brush box
may be mentioned the tea-trees ( Melaleuca ), whose names have become
synonymous with durability. As posts in the ground, as palings, as
flooring-boards, as corduroy roads (saplings being of course used for
this purpose), as piles in rivers for, say, small boat jetties, tea-tree, and


particularly prickly-leaved, tea-tree [M. styphelioides , Sm.) is not excelled
in durability by any other timber we have, but its excessive hardness,
and its great tendency to shrink irregularly are against it. The water
gum ( Tristania laurina, 8.8 r.) makes perhaps the best mauls of any
timber we have, while for axe and tool handles it is nnapproached save
by spotted gum. The rough-barked species of apple (. Angophora )yield
useful timber for the naves of wheels, for bullock-yokes and for fuel.
The turpentine {Syncarpia laurifo Ten.) prefers the shaded
gullies of our coast and mountain districts. It is one of the most
umbrageous and handsome trees we have, and deserves conservation,
and extensive planting for ornamental purposes. Its name suggests
inflammability, but it is really one of our timbers most difficult to
ignite, hence it is used for joists and pillars in buildings. With the
bark on it is one of the best timbers (perhaps best timber), we
have to withstand the attacks of Cobra in sea-water. Between the
fibrous bark and the sap-wood is a layer of oleo-resin (known as
“ turpentine” in the vernacular), and the immunity of this timber to
destruction by various pests is attributed to this substance. Cobra is
very much more active in brackish than in pure sea-water, and tur-
pentine is not absolutely resistant to Cobra in brackish water. Of my
own knowledge I do not know any timber that is—jarrah certainly is
not, and I would much like to pit a pile of British Guiana greenheart
(Nectandra) against one each of prickly tea-tree, turpentine, jarrah,
and New Zealand totara at, say Kempsey, in this Colony.
The brush box ( Tristania conferta, B. Br.) is another umbrageous
tree, —one of the best we have for street planting in the coast dis-
tricts from the Illawarra northwards. It yields a very durable timber,
which is universally used in the north coast forests for tram-rails for
haulage of the logs to the mill. It is not cut by the iron-wheels,
while it becomes polished by the traction. It is one of the most
perfectly durable timbers we have for wood-blocks. Like most of the
timbers of its class, it warps and twists if cut at the wrong season,
hut I have seen inch boards of it exposed to the atmosphere without
warping, and, in view of its pre-eminent merit as a resistant to wear
and to attacks by fungus and insect pests, I feel that it is desirable
that more attention should be given to the proper season for felling it.
I look upon it as one of our timbers whose merits will be recognised
in the near future.
Wood-paving.
This subject being of such great practical importance at the present
time, both as regards our local demand and the export trade, I may
mention the following timbers as of well ascertained suitability for the
purpose.
Pale Hardwoods. —Blackbutt, tallow-wood, whitemahog any, spotted
gum.
Red Hardwoods. —Bed mahogany, grey gum, Murray red gum, forest
red gum, Sydney blue gum, woollybutt, bloodwood.
In addition to the above, turpentine and brush-box are worthy of
extended trial, particularly the latter, which is especially wear-resisting.
For further information the reader is referred to the remarks under
each timber.


Cedar and Rosewood.
We now leave the hardwoods, which term in practice is restricted
to Eucalyptus and its allies, and which does not usually include the
brush hardwoods, some of which rank amongst the hardest timbers of
the Colony.
One of the most valuable timbers of this or any other country is the
red cedar ( Cedrelaaustralis, F.v.M.), which resembles the mahogany
of commerce a good deal, with the advantage of possessing only half
its weight. It is a superb timber, easy to work, handsome in appear-
ance, and durable. It has for many years been the principal furniture
wood of the Colony, and it has been so much appreciated that it is
now getting scarce. It is one of our few deciduous trees, and is found
in the rich brushes from the Illawarra northward, though in market-
able quantities only on the northern rivers. Closely resembling cedar,
and a fair substitute for it is the onion wood ( Owenia cepiodora, F.v.M.)
found on the northern rivers. Botanically very closely related to these
are the rosewood (Dysoxylon Fraserianum ßenth.), and the red bean
(D. Muelleri, Benth.) The rosewood has a dainty rose odour, as its
name denotes, while the red bean may be described as a scentless
rosewood. The rosewood is very abundant; the red bean less so.
Both are admirable furniture woods, and may be recommended for
many purposes where a timber a little harder than a soft wood is
required. They have a handsome red colour, with often a pleasing
figure. The rosewood is particularly valuable as a resistant to white
ants, a circumstance that citizens contemplating the building of a house
would do well to bear in mind.
Fines.
W e boast of two kinds of pines which, though not true pines
fPinus) belong, like them, to the cone-bearers (Conifers). One is
the Colonial or Moreton Bay pine, and is confined to our well-watered,
rich-soiled northern forests. Its botanical name is Araucaria Cunning-
hamii, Ait. It is an inferior pine compared with many of those that
are imported, for it lacks durability, and is often a bad colour; but,
on the principle, I suppose, of “ A prophet is not,” &c., our colonial
pine does not always receive fair treatment. It should ever be borne
in mind that the pine from the mountain side is so superior to the
pine from the low coast lands as to be practically a different timber;
and secondly, seasoned colonial pine is comparatively light in weight,
of good colour, and works well. I have never had a desire to
encourage the use of colonial timbers merely on sentimental grounds,
but I can state that hundreds of times I have shown planks of
colonial pine to citizens who have expressed surprise at its good
quality. It has the recommendation of being cheap, and certainly
its uses could be advantageously extended —but let it be seasoned.
Our other pine includes a number of species belonging to the genus
Callitris (Frenela) , closely related to the North African tree which
produces the sandarach of commerce. We call these pines cypress
pines, and different ones red or black pine, Murray or white pine,
Richmond River cypress pine. Port Macquarie pine, &c. The chief
recommendation of these cypress pines is their power of resistance to
white ants —an important recommendation in many parts of Australia
M


Cypress pine lias a pleasant odour —camplio ra ceou s, or reminding one
of sandalwood. Many of tire plants liaye a most gorgeous figure,
almost too gorgeous, in fact, while others are so neat that they would
not offend tlie most refined taste. Tire chief drawbacks to this timber
are its brittleness and its inflammability. It chiefly occurs in the
western parts of the Colony.
Beech and Beech substitutes.
It is an easy transition to pass from pine to white beech, which,
like most colonial timbers, resembles very slightly its prototype. Its
botanical name is Gmelina leichhardtii , F.v.M., and it belongs to the
Yerbenacege. It never was one of our most abundant timbers, and now
it is getting scarce in readily accessible localities. It is pale-coloured,
white with a tinge of brown. Its chief recommendation is that it
shrinks so very slightly, hence it is used for verandah-floors. It is
valued for house-fittings generally, ships' 5 blocks, wine-vats, &c.
We have a number of timbers which are best known as colonial
beech substitutes, and some of them are in some respects superior to
beech. It will be sufficient to mention (1) Flindosa or Cudgerie
(Blindersia australis, B. By. J a large tree found in the brush forests
of the northern districts, extending nearly as far south as the Hawkes-
bury; (2) Various kinds of Blue-berry ash, or Pigeon-berry ash, and
belonging to the genus Elseocarpus. Most of them are distinguished
by their blue fruits. They are found in the coast districts, and give
a white-coloured timber of good appearance, bright looking, tough,
and easy to work. Every collection of timbers shows others, pos-
sessing much in common with these timbers, —white woods, rather
harder than soft-woods, and very generally useful. To what extent
they can be utilised, and in what abundance they are, can only be
decided as the forest trees become more familiar to the timber-getter
and saw-miller. These remarks apply also to an enormous number
of usually unfigured brush timbers of whose merits, and of whose
relative abundance we are at present but imperfectly informed. In
our luxuriant brush forests there are, I am fully convinced, very many
kinds of trees hiding, as it were, their merits, and promising to reveal
their true value only to the diligent inquirer. As there is hidden
mineral wealth, so there is hidden, unrevealed timber wealth. I have
already entered a plea for the fuller study of our timbers.
Black Bean, Myall, fyc.
What we might call our colonial walnut, the black bean, or
Moreton Bay chestnut [Castanospermum A. Gunn.), may
come next. It was greatly admired by its discoverer for its handsome,
glossy foliage, and its umbrageous, symmetrical character. It
produces its seeds in large cylindrical pods, which seeds or “ beans ”
resemble in size those of the horse-chestnut of Europe. These seeds
are tempting to horses, and being eaten by them have caused their
deaths in large numbers from a form of indigestion. Consequently
station-owners on the northern rivers have waged war against it, to the
regret of the timber merchant, for it has been shown to be an excellent
substitute for American walnut. It is somewhat capricious in


seasoning, but it is a really valuable timber, always admired by
visiting timber experts, particularly tliose interested in the furniture
trade.
Our Acacia timber may conveniently be divided into two classes —
tliose dark-coloured and heavy, of which the brigalow and myall are
examples ; and those which are paler-coloured and more fissile, of
which the black and green wattle and hickory may be cited as
instances. Speaking generally, the former are interior species, while
the latter are most developed in the coast and coast mountain districts.
Timbers of the former class are intensely hard, heavy, dark-coloured,
and smell more or less of violets. They are used chiefly for turnery
work. The trees attain no great size (say, 30 or 40 feet), with a trunk
diameter of 12 to 18 inches. Considerable railway freights add to
their cost, but not to a prohibitive extent, as these timbers are usually
used for small articles, —such as presentation mallets, and the better
class of turned work generally. True myall {Ac ada pen dula ), briga-
low {A. Tiarpophylla) , yarran {A. are the principal
timbers of the above class. There are others, and the quantity
available will satisfy any demand ever likely to be made upon them.
She-oak, Silky-Byc.
The genus Gasuarina , so called because its leafless wiry branches
were thought to resemble the plumes of a cassowary, is known as oak
or she-oak throughout the continent. Various species yield timber
pale or dark, and varying a good deal in the oak-like blotchy markings,
but there is a strong family likeness throughout. Different she-oaks
are known as forest oak, black oak, swamp oak, river oak, bull
oak, belar, and other names. They grow in the arid plains of the
interior, amongst the rocky crags of the mountains, on the table-lands,
by the banks of rivers, and in salt-water swamps, no genus of Aus-
tralian timber-trees being more accommodating as to soil and situation.
O O
The timbers of some yield excellent bullock-yokes, others shingles,
while most of them are excellent for turnery purposes. A limited
quantity is exported to Europe for the purpose of making veneers for
the backs of brushes and such like uses; also for panels for furniture.
We have still another oak, —a so-called silky oak (Grevillea rohusta,
R. Br.), a pale-coloured, ornamental timber of a very fissile nature.
This property has led to its extensive use for such prosaic purposes as
casks for tallow, and kegs for butter. For staves for wine-casks it
requires to be strictly cut on the quarter to avoid leakage. It is used
to some extent as a furniture wood. It is a very handsome tree, with
beautiful fern-like foliage, and rich masses of orange-coloured blos-
soms, which have caused it to be a favourite in gardens, parks,
avenues, &c., in the warmer parts of the coast districts. The red
silky oak or beefwood (Stenocarpus salignus , R. Br.) yields a timber
of a similar character, but much darker in colour. It is found in the
coast districts from the Illawarra northwards. Even a cursory account
of our timbers must take cognizance of the needlewood
coptera, R. Br.) a tree of the dry western parts of the Colony, and
whose root-stock makes (so expert smokers tell me), a pipe cooler to
smoke than even the briar. The making of needlewood pipes, which


lias been left in tlie bands of busbmen for balf a century, bas now
developed into a regular Sydney manufacture, the recognition of the
value of needlewood being looked upon as of some importance,
especially in view of the failing supply of briar-root.
The two silky oaks and the needlewood all belong to the Protea-
ceas; to these I will add the honeysuckle [Banksia) These trees are
present in the coast districts in countless millions, and prefer poor,
rocky, or sandy soil, some of them being found on the sea coast. As
a rule they are gnarled and picturesque, and have flowers called
honeysuckles or bottle-brushes. Their timber is of an inferior
character as a rule, its chief specific use being for boat-knees.
Tulip-wood.
The tulip-wood [Harpullia pendula, Planch.) is one of the hand-
somest of Australian woods. It is tough, close-grained, and marked
with different shades from black to yellow, and is therefore much
esteemed for cabinetwork. With selected pieces the effect may be
described as gorgeous; it is also very durable. It resembles olive-
wood somewhat in general appearance. It is found in our northern
brush forests, and is moderately plentiful.
Root-stock for Veneers.
I would like to draw attention to a fact often lost sight of —namely,
that the gnarled roots of trees often produce timber of great beauty.
In fact, in clearing, the most beautiful timber is often left in the
ground. The number of trees whose root-stocks produce ornamental
timbers suitable for veneers, &c., is very large, and includes, amongst
others many specimens of the ever-present Bucalypt. It is only in
special instances that it will pay to utilise these root-stocks, but I
would advise attention to the matter, as I am convinced that a market
may be fostered for veneering woods.
Concluding Remarks.
In this little essay on New South Wales timbers it is obviously
impossible to describe with any detail, or even enumerate, many of
the miscellaneous timbers of our forests, and I have had to content
myself with referring to the principal of them. I shall be satisfied if I
have given some idea of the variety and value of the timber wealth to
be found in our State forests, and I trust that the hands of the Forest
Department may be strengthened in its efforts to conserve this
valuable national heritage—the property of the whole of the Colony.
By reasonable conservation we may have an abundant timber supply
for our own use, while discharging the trust we hold for posterity in
regard to our timber wealth. Meantime, I plead for a wider interest
to be taken in our trees and our timbers, and that in place of the
apathy which exists in the minds of so many worthy citizens in regard
to them, it may be realised that study of them is not only full of
interest, but, as a mental discipline alone, worthy of attention by the
best intellects of the Colony.


Some Minor Vegetable Products.
BY J. H. MAIDEN, F.L.S., Superintendent of Technical Education, &c.
Introductory .
The commercial depression of the last few years, wliicli lias caused so
much distress in this Colony, as well as in other parts of the world,
may prove to he, in some measure, a blessing in disguise. A hopeful
sign has been the increased attention which dwellers in country dis-
tricts have been giving to the products of the bush, and it is now more
than ever realised that some of our less abundant vegetable products
are worthy of collection, preparation, or cultivation for commercial
purposes. In more prosperous times far less attention was paid to
such, but I trust that the exploitation of these substances will hence-
forth form regular industries in the Colony, and be the means of
rendering the existence of many a struggling selector, or other
industrious citizen, more tolerable.
The principal difficulty is, of course, the finding of markets for our
products, but the Government is giving all the aid possible in this
direction, while many shrewd commercial men are taking the matter
in hand. The products of new countries are always difficult to dispose
of in the markets of the world, as manufacturers will only buy them
when they are satisfied that they can receive adequate and continuous
supplies ; otherwise the routine of their operations is interfered with.
Merchants wishing to do business in the products of the bush, should
bear in mind the circumstances of our country residents. The Colony
itself is only a century old ; the western interior has only been settled
for about half that period. Our products of commercial value have in
many cases found their way into the world’s markets comparatively
recently. The dwellers in the country districts have not, like Europeans
and Asiatics, been in the habit of collecting these products for many
generations, and thus information as to the best season for collection,
the best method of collection, and also high technical skill, the result of
long experience, perhaps handed down from father to son for many years,
is in Australia frequently wanting. Many of our products are not
collected unless they are asked for; the merchant if he chooses to make
it known that he will buy a certain article at a certain price, will, as a
rule, find business result, but if he expects that he may obtain some
of our bush products in the same way that he would obtain tea, sugar,
and such well recognised articles of commerce, he will be mistaken.
In some respects the merchant must look upon rural Australia as
he would upon the lesser known parts of Africa; he will find that he
has not only to buy, but also to take steps to show our country people
how to collect and prepare an article for him to buy.


Take, for instance, tlie indigenous gum arabic of tlie western country.
It remains on tlie trees until washed off by tlie rain, and tlie vast
majority of our people have no idea that it is of any commercial value.
If they did they could collect it at odd times, or the children of a
family could collect it more systematically, and it could accumulate
until sufficient had been obtained to trade to the local storekeeper, through
whose intermediary it would find its way to the wholesale house in
Sydney in the ordinary course of business. People in England and
other parts of Europe have no idea of the bartering and miscellaneous
trading relations which, from the very nature of things, take place
between the country storekeeper and his isolated customers. The
storekeeper is usually an educated or, at all events, a shrewd business
man, with an intimate knowledge of his district, and, having obtained
information (through advertisement or otherwise), that a certain
product is in demand, we may readily imagine him saying to one of
his selector-customers: “You see this article, Mr. X.; I have seen
plenty of it on the trees at Dingdong Creek ; I will give you so much
a pound for all you can bring me.” Business is often done in this
way; the product is often not in the market until the demand for it
has been communicated to the country districts.
I propose to deal with a few of our vegetable products which may be
obtained in quantity, —some of them in the greatest abundance, and
trust that some of the suggestions I make, and the advice I give, may
either enable my readers to make money, or prevent them wasting it.
Eucalyptus Oil.
A good many people have the idea that Eucalyptus Oil is an article
of approximately uniform composition, like water, but such an idea is
a very erroneous one.
A Eucalyptus oil varies in composition primarily on account of the
species of Eucalyptus (gum, tallow-wood, ironbark, peppermint, &c.),
whose leaves have been distilled. To a less degree it depends upon
the season of the year (whether young or mature foliage has been
distilled), the locality whence the trees were obtained, and other cir-
cumstances.
The two principal constituents of Eucalyptus oils are cineol
(eucalyptol), a colourless and transparent liquid, of specific gravity *93,
and boiling point 176°-177°C., and phellandrene, likewise a colourless
and transparent liquid, boiling at 170°, a hydrocarbon, while cineol is
an oxygenated product. Some oils contain both these substances in
varying proportions; others contain one or other body almost or entirely
to the exclusion of the other.
At the present time European buyers mainly buy oils containing
cineol, rejecting those which contain a large percentage of phellan-
drene. We are in the position that some of our Eucalypts which
yield oils most abundantly yield phellandrene oils; at the same time
we do not possess information with any degree of fullness concerning
the oils produced by 10 per cent, of our Eucalypts. New South
Wales has the greatest number of species of Eucalypts of any colony
of Australia (Queensland coming second, and Western Australia
third in this respect), and it seems highly improbable to suppose that


we have not a number of species yielding cineol oils. As regards
this question, we (as well as our sister colonies) lack two things, first,
a botanical survey of the territory, from which would be at once seen
the distribution of our various Eucalypts; and second, an exhaustive
series of experiments to indicate the average composition of the oils
produced by the various species of Eucalyptus. Until these two things
are done, the Eucalyptus oil industry will never make the progress
and assume the dimensions that I believe it is capable of doing in
this Colony. Meantime the experiments are largely left to private
enterprise/with the result that some firms turn out very creditable
oils. The following species promise good results, and should receive
careful, practical tests on a commercial scale : —Narrow-leaved iron-
bark (Eucalyptus crebra), grey box (E. , tallowwood
(E. microcorysj ,Argyle apple (E. Murray red gum
(E. rostrataj, and the various mallees near Balranald and in different
parts of the Colony. Space forbids the matter being dealt with at
greater length here, and I will only add that I will with pleasure give
intending Eucalyptus oil distillers any further information or advice
in my power.
Wattle-harhs and Extracts.
That our tan-barks are both abundant and excellent is now recog-
nised by everyone who has given attention to Australian vegetable
products. They are the product of ornamental, usually yellow-
flowering trees, botanically known as or in Australia popu-
larly as wattles. Hence wattle-bark, but in England the trade-name
is usually Mimosa bark, our Acacias having been called Mimosas at the
beginning of the century and later. Our richest wattle-barks contain
from 25 to 40 per cent, of tannin. Most of the bark which comes
into the Sydney market is the product of one or other of the forms
of Acacia decurrens, popularly known as black or green wattle. We
have other kinds of wattle yielding bark containing a fair percentage
of tannin, which will best be utilised when extract-works are more
abundant than they are at present.
We want a little more enterprise in this matter of extract-making.
Extracts for tanning are thoroughly well known in the trade, are
made in enormous quantities in America and Europe, and in small
quantities in, at least, three Australian colonies. The advantages of an
extract are mainly two, —uniformity of product and saving of carriage.
What is the sense of conveying, perhaps thousands of miles, large and
varying percentages of unnecessary ligneous matter ? The poten-
tialities of wai tie-bark extracts are enormous, and what are the
difficulties ? Surely to the practical man, determined to surmount
them, by no means insuperable. The raw-material (including small
and refuse pieces of bark, twigs, &c., which are wasted at the present
time), can be digested in wooden vats, the heat of the sun being
permitted to assist in the evaporation in some places and some seasons.
The wood of the stripped trees, and the exhausted “trash” are available
for fuel, while the evaporation can be pushed as far as expedient in
vacuum pans which, owing to the vicissitudes of the sug'ar-industry,
can now be obtained at a low rate. The key to the difficulty of
getting rid of the superfluous gum in extracts lies, in my opinion, in


tlie judicious use of alcohol, which can be recondensed and largely
saved. Arrangements might be made, if necessary, for constituting
each extract works a bond, and using duty-free spirit.
I feel so strongly on the subject of tanning extracts that, if I were
not precluded from entering into business, the making of extracts on
a large scale is one of the first things I should turn my attention to.
I say this in perfect sincerity.
Wattle and other Gums.
Wattle-gum is the produce of various species of wattle [Acacia), a
genus which is very largely developed in this continent, comprising
over 320 species, besides a large number of well-marked varieties.
Gum has, however, only been recorded from comparatively few species,
as by far the great majority have no local names, and where it has
been collected at all it has been simply known as “ Wattle-gum.”
Best selected turkey gum arable is the ideal gum of the group to which
wattle gum belongs, and if judging were to be by points, it would
take the highest place as regards absence of colour, freedom from
accidental impurities, ready solubility, and adhesiveness of mucilage.
Our wattle-gums as a rule fall far behind this high standard, although
specimens of yarran, myall, and prickly wattle [Acacia sentis) gum
compare with it very favourably. As far as my observations go, those
samples obtained from, the interior (comparable in its aridity to the
Soudan and other gum-producing countries), are completely soluble in
water, and make good mucilages, while those obtained east of the
Dividing Range, i.e., in well-watered districts, in which vegetation is
comparatively luxuriant, are more or less insoluble, portions at least
merely swelling up in water like cherry gum.
Australian wattle-gum (chiefly, however, from the other colonies),
frequently finds its way into the London market, and may often be
seen noted in the drug sales. Following are a few extracts from
recent London market reports (auction sales), none of them, however,
referring to the best wattle-gum :
“ Of 71 bag’s Australian only 7 bags sold at 82s. 6d. per cwt. for fine
frosted palish.” (April, 1895).
cc Of Australian gums a considerable quantity (239 packages),
including some nice lots, was offered, but only 8 packages ordinary to
common glassy red sold at 21s. 6d to 235. per cwt.” (June, 1895.)
“ The market was rather quiet for most varieties, several lots being
held above current value. The only kind which sold with really
good competition at full price was Australian gum, which appears to
be wanted for Russia. The following is the result of the auctions :
‘'Australian, of 295 packages, 180 sold at 31s. to 335. for bold, partly
woody mixed red; 275. 6d. for frosted reddish; 265. 6d. to 275. fof
ordinary quality red; and 20s. for siftings/ ” (October, 1895.)
‘'‘'Good, bright glassy to fine bold frosted Australian sold at 275. to
335. per cwt.” (November, 1895.)
I would, therefore, earnestly recommend dwellers in the drier parts
of the country, where there are wattles, to look after the gum, and
carefully collect it. I would also include such trees as the leopard tree
[Flindersia maculosa), which yields a gum arable of excellent quality.


If a man were to set out witli tlie deliberate intention of collecting
wattle-gum, wbat with its capricious exudation, and the uncertainty
of an odd shower washing* it from the trees, he might find his under-
taking unprofitable; but in this, as in the collection of other of our
minor bush products, children and others should be apprised of the
value of these gums, and whenever an opportunity presents itself
of collecting them it should not be lost. If a permanent resident of a
district be on the lookout for such a product, depend upon it, not
much will be lost in the course of a year. If kept dry and clean it
does not deteriorate on keeping, and it can be accumulated until a
convenient opportunity of disposing of it presents itself. In spite of
the various gum substitutes, there will always be a demand for wattle-
gum, particularly for the finer sorts.
Grass-tree Gum.
This “ gum,” or, to speak more correctly, “ resin,” is obtained in
large quantities from the stems and around the roots of the so-called
“ grass-trees,” whose botanical name is Xanthorrhxa. We have
several species, which vary a good deal in height; they are usually
indicative of poor soil. One species yields a yellow gum, —the others
a gum of a red colour. It is the yellow kind that is the more highly
prized. The demand for it fluctuates. The monthly circular of one
of our best Sydney firms quotes the value this month (December,
1895) at from £ll to £2O per ton.
This article has been used in the making of an inferior French
polish, as an ingredient in waxes, fumigating pastilles, &c., and its
use as an explosive has been patented. Ido not doubt that additional
uses will be found for grass-tree gum, and that the demand for it will
be more steady than it has been of late years.
In gum-collecting the articles required are an axe, a flail, a coarse
sieve, and a sheet. The stems of the grass-trees are chopped down,
broken up into convenient pieces, and allowed to fall into the sheet.
A stout stick or flail completes the work of disintegration. The
substance is then passed through the sieve, the ligneous portions of
the grass-tree for the most part failing to pass through its meshes.
A gentle breeze is considered sufficient to winnow what has passed
through the sieve, and render it ready for the market, though it
often comes to Sydney without having been subjected to any win-
nowing process. Comparatively large pieces of grass-tree gum are
also often found near the roots of grass-trees, or where grass-trees
once stood, having been melted and caused to flow into the ground
by the bush fires.
Grass-trees are very abundant in Australia, and a considerable
quantity of the “ gum ” would be available with any reasonable
inducement, sufficient for the men to earn a few shillings a day
collecting it.
Australian Sandarach.
The clear resin of our cypress pines (Gallitris or Frenela) is a
perfect substitute for the sandarach of commerce, used in varnish-
making and for other purposes. What the actual demand for this resin


is is not thoroughly ascertained, and inquiries are being made at the
present time concerning it. Meantime, residents in the pine districts
are recommended to collect the better qualities whenever they can
conveniently do so.
Astringent Gums or Kin os.
These are natural astringent extracts which some of our gum-
trees in certain seasons and certain districts exude very freely. They
vary somewhat in composition, and therefore it is necessary that the
products of different kinds of trees should be kept separate, to be
afterwards classified by experts. I believe that if tanners could
obtain these gums (Kinos) in quantity at a cheap rate they would
replace some of the extracts at present in use. Although the demand
for the officinal kino as an astringent medicine is far less than what it
used to be, I am of opinion that some of our kinos can replace the
kino of the Pharmacopoeia, and the introduction of kinos of known
composition, and comparatively low in price, might result in an
increased demand for astringent medicines of this class. The only
kino in regular Australian demand at present is that of the Murray
red gum (. Eucalyptus rostrata), and we have several species of
Eucalyptus yielding exudations of similar composition, but our local
market might be readily over supplied.
Miscellaneous.
Some Australian vegetable products are in demand for research
work, or for the medicinal principles they contain,'in this and other
countries. The leaves of the corkwood myoporoidesj and the
bark of the bitter-tree (. Alstonia constrict a) , may be quoted as examples.
Seeds and fruits of Australian plants, or the plants themselves, noted
either for the beauty or peculiarity of their flowers, leaves, &c., and
pressed specimens of our rarer plants are often merchantable commo-
dities. From time to time I have known quite a number of men who
have supplemented their incomes by miscellaneous collecting of this
kind, which, of course, can only be undertaken by those who have
studied the plants of their district. By correspondence, advertisement,
and various means, the collector discovers the demand for the articles
he is able to supply. So much depends on the individual collector
that it is quite impossible to speak even approximately as to the remu-
neration to be expected from this source.
Grading. •
In conclusion, a few words on grading may not be out of place.
This is an important matter, but one too often lost sight of. In a
mixed parcel of any product, the value tends to that of the most
inferior portion of it. The sorting of a product and division into
various qualities always pays, as the buyer can readily see what is
offered to him. In wattle-gum, for instance, separate the large, pale-
coloured pieces from the dark-coloured ones, and these again from the
fragments and those admixed with accidental impurities. The extra
labour involved is more than repaid by the extra price a well-graded
product realises.




“HONEYCOMB,” THE CHAMPION DAIRY COW OF THE WORLD.
Bred by Jno. Lindsay, Esq., J.P., Kembla Park, Unanderra, New South Wales.


The Dairying Industry.
BY A. A. DUNNICLIFF, Department of Agriculture.
Hr dealing with the dairying industry of New South Wales,, from our
earliest times to the present day, it is my intention to confine my
remarks strictly to the methods practised in this colony, avoiding
comparisons with systems in vogue elsewhere, and endeavour to give
such a resume of its conditions and opportunities as may be helpful in
a general way to those who may feel disposed to adopt this industry
as their occupation in New South Wales. Beyond this, I would say
to those who require more detailed or specific information on any of
the points here lightly touched upon, that by referring to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture their requiremeuts may be promptly met.
In a British community milk, butter, and cheese are indispensable
articles of diet, and from the early times of the colony to the present
the production of these necessaries has been an honourable and fairly
profitable occupation; sometimes very much so.
Our first record of note concerning the industry is that of the late
W. C. Wentworth, who, in writing about Sydney in 1820, said the
market was very well supplied with grain, vegetables, poultry, butter,
eggs, and fruit. In Langes “New South Wales” (1834) we learn that
large quantities of dairy produce were sent regularly to Sydney from
the rich districts of the Hunter Eiver, Camden, and Bathurst. He
also states that large quantities of both butter and cheese were manu-
factured on farms throughout the colony, and prices then were not
very different from those of to-day, being for fresh butter Is. per lb. ;
cheese, 4d. to 6d. per lb.; bacon, sd. per lb., &c.
As early as 1832 we find New South YCales doing an export trade
in butter and cheese to the extent of £5,279, nearly the whole of
which went to the other British colonies. During the same year her
imports of these products were only £872.
Bathurst was then noted for the superior quality of its cheese, which
was largely sought for by the Sydney provision merchants. The
industry appears to have been initiated by Mr. Geo. Ranken, of that
district, who brought his practical knowledge from Ayrshire, Scotland.
The first estate said to have been devoted specially to the manufacture
of butter was Glenlee, on the banks of the Cow pasture River,
owned by Wm. Howe, about this same time. The products of this
estate were recognised throughout the colony as being very superior,
and for fully thirty years maintained their reputation. The dairy
stock consisted of a fine herd of Ayrshire cattle. During the next
twenty years the industry had located itself in the rich districts of
Illawarra, from Bulli to Shoalhaven, then called the Garden of
Australia, and extended to Ulladulla, Moruya, and Bega in the far


south.. In fact it had possession of the whole South Coast. Distinct
dairy herds were formed by such shrewd progressive gentlemen as
Alex. Berry, of Shoalhaven (who was exporting butter in quantity to
California in 1849) ; Henry Osborne, of Marshall Mount, A. McGill,
De Mestre, and others; and thousands of acres of the richest
lands were specially devoted to dairying, The discovery of gold,
and the consequent large influx of population, enabled farmers of all
classes to obtain remunerative returns for their labours, and the
writer has very frequently, during the fifties, both bought and sold
fresh butter at 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per lb. wholesale. Sometimes extra-
vagant rents were paid for lands in favoured localities, even as high
as 505., 555., and 60s. per acre were not unknown. Consequently the
increased dairy production was such that, notwithstanding the rapidy
increasing population, the supply during the summer months exceeded
the local demand, and prices receded to perhaps 6d. per lb. The
surplus was then exported to the other colonies, chiefly Victoria, and
was 79,990 lb, in 1855, valued at £6,636. There does not appear to be
any authentic records showing the actual quantities of the dairy pro-
ducts of the colony at this time, but from data which may be taken as
reliable, I estimate the output of butter for 1855 at 1,300 tons, the
greater part of which was from Illawarra, or the strip of coast country
between Bulli and Shoalhaven.
One matter which tended greatly to the extension of the industry
was the system of “clearing leases,” which found much favour in
Illawarra at this time. By it, any respectable family with an aptitude
for, or knowledge of, dairying, could obtain virgin lands on lease from
landed proprietors to convert into dairy farms. The intending settler
or lessor, who was generally a new arrival in the country, took a lease
for seven or ten years of, say, 20 or 50 or perhaps 100 acres of rich,
well-timbered bush or forest land, undertaking to clear and grass the
same, to erect such fences, yards, buildings, &c., as he might need to
work the place. He would usually have the place rent free for the
first half or more of the term, and pay to the lessee probably 10s. per
acre during the latter part. Conditions, of course, varied with indi-
vidual cases, and at the expiration of that lease the lessor generally
stayed on the land as tenant at £1 or more per acre per annum. Under
this system many hundreds of acres of heavy brush lands were brought
into profitable work without the outlay of a single penny by their
owners, and many poor but industrious families that went on those
lands with almost nothing, soon found themselves in very independent
positions. Upon the advent of “Free selection ” under the Land Act
of 1861, many of the best men of the coast districts, who held either
clearing leases or rented farms, now felt the landowners’ demands
upon them to be too heavy, and determined to make a move to
obtain lands for themselves. They spread out north, west, and
south, taking’ with them their herds, and the industry which had
proved so profitable to them. By these means some of them obtained
what are now princely estates.
From this time until the advent of the factory system of dairying,
a quarter of a century later, the industry struggled along with varying
vicissitudes, through seasons of prosperity and of adversity, times of
luxuriance and abundance, and spells of drought, when the pastures


were burnt up, and tire cattle perished by thousands throughout the
country. If remunerative prices were obtainable the local market
was almost sure to be immediately glutted by imports from colonies
which had previously been purchasers from us.
I should here mention that during this period the late Mr. Seccombe
of Ulladulla carried on the manufacture of condensed milk, for about
twenty years, or from 1858 until his death. The article always found
a ready sale in Sydney, successfully competing with European makers.
A company was also formed in Kiama, and a factory well equipped
for the same purpose; but, as the quality of the output was variable,
the establishment was subsequently closed.
The initiation of the system of separating cream from milk by
machinery was due to the importation in 1883 of two Danish cream-
separators by the Fresh Food and Ice Co., a most progressive company
formed by the late T. S. Mort, for the purpose, primarily, of sup-
plying pure new milk and other foods to the citizens of Sydney. This
company, always on the alert to take advantage of any advance in
science or practice applicable to their business, immediately recognised
the immense advantage to be derived from the then newly invented
machine. Two separators were obtained from Europe, as already
said, and placed at their milk depot at Mittagong, where the surplus
milk, not required for sale in Sydney, was then separated; the cream
being made into butter of extra quality, and the skimmed milk
utilised for fattening pigs for hams and bacon.
Mr. Pateson, the company’s manager, freely gave the dairymen every
information and assistance; and laboured hard personally, by lectures
and otherwise, to induce them to take up the new and better system
of work. Shortly afterwards, when a co-operative company was
formed at Kiama, and a butter factory erected (1884), he further
encouraged them by taking the whole of their output at an advance
of 3d. per lb. over the top market price in Sydney for best hand-made
butter. The soundness and success of the system being thus demon-
strated at the factory, as well as at Mittagong, many oi
the best dairymen furnished themselves with separators, and the
farmers in various dairying centres formed themselves into co-operative
companies for the erection and mechanical equipment of butter
factories, to which all the shareholders might take their milk.
The farmers very speedily recognised the great advantage of the
factory system of manufacture ; the great diminution of labour in the
absence of milk setting, cream skimming, churning, with the end-
less washings and scourings of ntensils, &c., &c. The females in
particular were relieved from much work, whilst the men had some
hours per day more, which could be devoted to the improvement of
their lands, fences and buildings, or production of more fodder, and
consequent handling of more cows. Besides these benefits there was
the supreme one of more actual monetary returns from the same
quantities of milk, as a larger quantity of butter of much superior
quality was obtained therefrom. Factory butter or separator butter
also realised a higher price than the best hand-made brands under the
old system, and of course formed the standard of values.
By the end of 1885 there were about fifty separators running in the
Colony. There were also other results from the introduction of the

factory system, which, were very evident. Large numbers of farmers
who were deeply involved with the banks and storekeepers, or were
struggling with a hand-to-mouth existence, were soon enabled to re-
duce or clear their liabilities, and obtain for themselves and families
very comfortable positions ; whilst the general condition of all engaged
in the industry was materially improved. Again this system also allowed
other districts which had hitherto been purchasers of quantities of
butter in Sydney to join in and secure for themselves the benefits of
the industry.
Farmers who had long endeavoured to grow grain and hay at un-
remunerative prices, and whose crops were mortgaged as soon as they
appeared above ground, who dreaded more than the drawing of a tooth
to meet the storekeeper or banker if they went into the local town, by
converting their arable fields into pastures and consuming their crops as
fodder to milking cows on the farm, producing all the milk they could
for their local butter factory, soon found they could take their families
into town in well-appointed buggies, and the aforesaid formerly-
dreaded individuals would be pleased to raise their hats and smilingly
greet them. Formerly the farmer saw or handled but little money,
and then only once a year, when the crops of grain, hay, or wool were
sold; but now he had the cash for his milk every month, and larger
returns than he had received before. Besides the prosperity of the
farmer, the community was benefited in a multitude of ways, and whole
districts were changed materially and socially. Without any extraneous
aid tins industry has developed solely by private energy and enterprise
during the eleven years since the erection of the old “ Pioneer ” factory;
and co-operative factories, also proprietary factories, both of companies
and individual dairymen, have spread over the whole length and
breadth of the coast districts and tablelands.
The present number of butter factories and creameries (January,
1896) is approximately 400, with many more in course of erection.
Besides these, there are numerous other establishments not bavins’*
o
steam power, and therefore not designated “ factories,” but having
either horse or hand power cream-separators. The total number of
separators at work in the colony now reaches about 1,500.
The factory system has proved equally successful when applied to
the manufacture of cheese, and we have about 80 factories where
cheese is made, either alone, or in conjunction with butter or bacon.
The official records of the year ending 31st March, 1895, give the
colony’s production of butter and cheese to have been
and during the same period 4,590,606 lb. of butter were exported to
the United Kingdom.
The number of persons employed, more or less, in this industry, in
factories and farms, is, approximately, 26,800. The present number
of milking cows may be set down at 450,000, and the total dairy stock
of the colony is estimated to exceed 1,000,000.


Present and future Conditions of Work.
As I have previously intimated, tlie introduction of tlie factory
system of dairying lias caused a radical cliange in tlie methods of
work on the farms. Formerly nearly all tlie internal labour of the
dairy fell to tlie lot of tlie female members of tlie household. There
was the setting of the milk in pans twice daily, the skimming of the
cream, the churning, making and packing of butter, with the daily
washing, scouring, and scalding of numbers of utensils ; and sometimes
the feeding of pigs and calves with skimmed milk, fetching the cows
from pasture, and always a full share in the milking. These labours
beyond their domestic duties were frequently anything but light, and
a woman’s life on a dairy farm was not as enviable as many thought it
to be. Now she is not troubled beyond the care of her home, except
to assist perhaps with the milking; for the milk as soon as it comes in
from the cows is in the care of the man, who at once after aerating it
puts it through the cream-separator, if he has one, or puts it into large
cans, and takes it to the local factory, where a record is taken of
the quantity and quality of his delivery. The cans are cleaned and
scalded before leaving the factory. A partial load of skimmed milk is
usually taken back for the farm animals. This cartage of milk to and
from the factory may be done by a stout lad, who also feeds the animals.
In an adjoining Colony I have seen young women take the milk to the
factory; the young men there vieing with each other who should render
her most help.
Some other advantages of the rearrangement of labour in the dairy
farms I have already detailed ; but beyond those there is one which
stands out not less prominent. I allude to the healthful spirit of co-
operation which has been developed, and its successful application to
this industry, whereby many thousands of pounds have been put into
the pockets of our producers instead of going into those of speculators
or monopolists. And there is no doubt that by the system of co-operation
in vogue amongst us, the dairy farmers of this colony have received
higher prices for their products and better returns for their labours
than those elsewhere.
Co-operative factories owned and controlled by the dairy farmers
themselves have been, not merely in favour, but almost the only ones
obtaining footing in New South Wales until just recently. In any
locality where the farmers could supply the milk of say a minimum of
600 or 700 cows, they could combine into a company to erect and
equip a butter factory, or even a less number for cheese. Each farmer
would take up shares proportionate to the number of his milking cows.
Sometimes it was necessary to accept extraneous help to get the thing
started, but these investors’ shares were not viewed with favour by the
farmers, and were always paid off at the earliest opportunity. The
farmers usually selected five of themselves for directors. These
appointed the manager, engineer, and butter maker, or whatever
labour was required in the factory, and supervised the whole businsss.
The products were sold on behalf of the company, and the proceeds
were divided proportionately amongst the milk suppliers, after deduct-
ing all expenses of manufacture, &c. These factories, with few excep-
tions, very successfully served the purposes for which they were


formed; tlieir output found a ready sale with the retail trade, leaving
generally, as surplus production, what were known as “ dairy” or hand-
made butters.
The demonstrated fallacy of hoping to establish a profitable and
permanent export trade with anything but a really high class product,
the keen competition among European and other countries for the
British market, with the demand for a higher and more uniform stan-
dard of quality, and the rapid development of scientific knowledge
and practice as applied to dairying, have shown the need for and
caused the erection of a series of larger factories, equipped with the
very best and latest improved machinery and appliances, with refri-
geration for controlling temperatures during manufacture, or for cool,
storage as required. These factories have each several outposts or
creameries attached to them, and located in centres of farms beyond
the reach of the central factory. These creameries gather each some
hundreds, or even thousands, of gallons of milk daily, from which the
cream is separated and conveyed to the factory. All of these creams
are then there blended together, ripened, and churned daily; thus the
whole output of the district is of one superior and uniform quality,
produced at a minimum of cost, instead of, perhaps, a dozen different
brands, colours, and qualities, as previously.
The former factories are now confining themselves to the simple
work of creameries—gathering milks and separating cream therefrom.
There are large numbers of small creameries and private separators,
the cream from which cannot be sent to a local factory.
Meeting this difficulty, we have a number of proprietary factories
in Sydney, equipped in the latest and most approved style, to which
these said creams may be sent. Prominent amongst them may be
mentioned Messrs. Denham Bros., Messrs. Foley Bros., and the South
Coast and West Camden Co-operative Company. They each have
numerous constituents, who send their creams regularly, some indeed
long distances, say 200 miles by rail 'and over 400 miles by steamer.
These firms are noted butter makers, and do all the receiving,
handling, chilling, churning, and making, and return the cream cans
thoroughly cleaned for a very nominal charge, and the privilege of
selling the butter when made. This arrangement appears to be
found mutually advantageous. On very liberal and slightly differing
lines is managed the butter factory of the J. Ireland Company of New-
castle. This unites in an admirable manner the best points of a pro-
prietary concern, with the advantages to the producer of co-operative
principles. Whilst they do everything on similar lines to the last-
mentioned, they have also initiated a system of export, in which the
interests of the firm and the farmers are combined, frequently result-
ing at the close of the season in a substantial dividend being added
to the satisfactory payments already made to the latter. This firm
also receives cream from long distances by rail and boat, as producers
are eager to avail themselves of the benefits offered by this enter-
prising firm.
Yet another form of co-operation may be mentioned, one distinctly
in advance of previous efforts, and one whereby the mutual interests
of tenant and landlord, or producer and capitalist, are both blended
and conserved.


The Berry Estate, one of the noblest properties in the country,
consisting of between eighty and ninety thousand acres, was formed
by the late Alexr. Berry in 1822, at the southern end of Illawarra,
locating his homestead at the foot of Ooolangatta Mount, near the
month of the Shoalhaven River. The work has been largely pastoral,
with a considerable portion devoted to agriculture and dairying. It
has been a hive of progressive industry from the first, giving employ-
ment to all kinds of workmen ; and the administration under Mr. Berry
and his two succeeding brothers has always been kind and liberal,
almost paternal. In 1839 the estate carried a resident population of
3,500 persons. Besides the multitude of men employed on the estate,
there have always been numbers of tenants who were on the “halves”
system, by which respectable families with nothing of their own, but
their ability and willingness to work, were entrusted by the Messrs.
Berry with good farms, stock, implements, &c., on an equal division
of the yearly results; the worker and the capitalist thus taking
equal shares in the success or failure in the joint enterprise. Many of
these families have in time been enabled from their savings to take up
good estates for themselves elsewhere. On the death of Mr. David
Berry, a few years ago, the estate cams into the hands of Dr. Jno.
Hay, who has within the last three years spent £135,000 in improving
the estate, and providing homes for 150 more families.
Of late much of the cultivated lands have been put into pasture for
dairyings and all such farms are now held under a definite rent. The
district has always been one highly esteemed by dairymen, and until
this year has supported twelve independent dairy factories, either on
or adjoining this estate, and working up yearly the cream of over
6,000,000 gallons of milk from 12,800 cows.
Recognising the necessity before pointed out for high class butter
being made in larger quantities, and so obtaining more uniformity of
quality, Dr. Hay erected at his own cost last winter one of the best and
most complete butter factories in the country. One of the churns
turns out over half a ton of butter at once; and the capacity of the
present establishment is about 10 tons per day. Although, owing to
the severe drought of the present season, the daily output is but little
over 4 tons. The whole of the twelve butter factories just referred to
were invited to come in and support this central factory, sending
their creams to be manufactured into one uniform and standard article,
instead of having twelve different brands of butter, of varying quali-
ties. With one exception, they have all recognised the economic
advantages of this system. The business is supposed to run almost
entirely in the interests of the producers, and justly so; but the
indirect benefit to the estate in the increased prosperity and content-
ment of the tenants, will no doubt prove an appreciable factor.
Another large dairying estate of perhaps 30,000 acres in the far
south of the colony is worked on different lines again. Here the pro-
prietor has erected a most complete and efficient establishment for all
kinds of dairy-work, recognised as one of the best in the colony.
Besides several large herds of milch cows worked by the employees of
the estate, there are many others worked by dairy families on agree-
ment, thus : The manager, on being satisfied of the respectability and
N


industry of any family which may be recommended to him, will admit
them to a farm and homestead with every necessary convenience, &c.,
and a herd of cows, with any further and reasonable help to stimulate
the production of milk. The area of land and the number of cows
may be as large as the applicant is capable of managing ; and in return
the farmer agrees to deliver the whole of his milk at the factory or
depot near by at a proportionate and fixed price. Many families have
thus raised themselves from nothing to comparative affluence on this
estate.
The foregoing is one form of the proprietary factory in contradis-
tinction to the usual co-operation. There are others where a factory,
being placed in a farming district by an investing company, the milk
is bought from the farmers supplying at a price fixed by the company
and the profits arising’ from manufacture, advancing markets, or
exportation, are retained by the company. The benefits of this system
are not recognised by those producers who have enjoyed successful
co-operation.
One of the greatest difficulties connected with the dairying industry
is the question of milking; paid servants seldom have the same kindli-
ness and care with the milch cows as the members of the family
owning them. Many a man having to depend on paid help has had to
abandon the occupation, and until the advent of an efficient milking
machine, which is always coming but never here, the same difficulty
will remain. It is the custom of some large dairymen to let out their
milking to families by contract, payment being made at a stated sum
per vear, the owner seeing that the number of cows milking is kept
up. * Others again contract to pay so much per gallon for all milk
obtained from the cattle, in which case it is usual for the family,
during the milking, also to do certain work on the farm, for the
purpose of increasing the milk production, such as cleaning and
fencing in of pasture lands, the cultivation of fodder crops, soiling or
hand-feeding of the milch cattle, &c., &c.
Cleared lands, let for the purposes of this industry in the older and
more favoured portions of the Colony, may be estimated to realise an
average of 30s. per acre as yearly rent; while some obtain much
more,°and others a trifle less. Their values are largely dependent on
their access to a factory or creamery, proximity to a market, or social
benefits. But further afield in all the settled districts there are thou-
sands of acres equally suitable in themselves as regards soil and
climate, and having other advantages, which may be rented at merely
a proportion of the above, or obtained on reasonable and profitable
terms. Then again our land laws now allow almost any man who desires
it to obtain an area of good land on such nominal payments as have never
been known in this liberal land before. Many of these areas are
clothed with such rich and luxuriant pasture that nature offers a
premium in immediate returns to those who will accept her gifts and
use them. And how little our settlers do, either from ignorance or
apathy, to preserve and improve their pastures, either natural or arti-
ficial ; or still less supplement them, by growing fodder for winter
use. This is particularly noticeable with those men who have taken
refuge in dairying to escape from ill success in other branches of
agriculture.


To provide an ample supply of ricli succulent pasture or fodder is
so necessary that it may be esteemed the basis of the industry. To
this end the grazing lands should be fenced oh into paddocks of con-
venient size, so that one enclosure after being eaten oh., may be shut
up and allowed to recover whilst others in turn are being eaten.
Pastures, whether natural or artifical, will give much better returns by
being thus systematically grazed than by indiscriminate use. More-
over, neither sheep nor horses should ever be allowed to graze with
dairy cows ; they may follow them, if necessary. If the pastures are
bare after the cows have eaten them oh, and it be not deemed advis-
able to renew them by breaking up, a top dressing of fine manure and
a few pounds of grass seed and clovers, lightly harrowed in, will prove
beneficial and remunerative. To such an extent do some of our most
intelligent and industrious dairymen try to save their pastures, that
they have green fodder crops growing and in cut for their milch cattle
ail the year round, except just in the great flush of grass in the spring ;
at any rate, for fully nine months in the year. By this means it is no
uncommon thing for a farm to be carrying a milking cow to the acre,
with the dry cows and young growing stock upon another “ run.”
For this method of work a favourite fodder is green maize, which is
sown broadcast, and at such a time in the spring as will allow of cutting
and feeding* to the cows to commence in the early summer when it
should be cobbing. This plant sustains a good flow of milk, rich
in butter fat, and successive crops should be sown to keep up the
supply. During the summer maybe sown “imphee” or “planters'’
friend/’ to be cut alternately with the maize crops, or after, as it
will stand a little later towards the winter. It also yields well of
good rich milk. For autumn or winter months wheat, barley, rye, or
oats, each mixed with vetches, or alone as preferred, will be found
very useful; and if supplemented with grass and clover, or oaten
hay, sound ensilage, or other good foods, they will not only keep the
cows in profit, but wonderfully lessen the tax on the pastures until the
spring returns.
Another matter of vital importance to the dairyman is the quality
of his dairy stock. I have already shown how early in the colony’s
history this principle was recognised, and the efforts made to estab-
lish herds of true dairy cattle. Illawarra has always been famous for
its milking herds, and no doubt the best representatives of the colony
are to be found there; but it has been acknowledged by the local
agricultural societies that the majority of the dairymen’s herds are not
all that could be desired, and that the first half-century of their exist-
ence, with its many trying seasons of drought and vicissitudes of
owners had not brought them to that high excellence which was antici-
pated years ago. In the hope of making the herds more profitable to
the average dairymen, the agricultural societies of Kiama and Berry
districts have their own Dairy Herd-books, the qualification for regis-
tration therein being based on actual 'production, the minimum for
which is lb. butter, or 100 Rj. milk in 48 hours. Hand-feeding
or milk-feeding is not allowed. So successful have these efforts been
that improvement is distinctly noticeable in the dairy stock competing
at the local annual shows, whilst the test trials for registration show
an advancing average.


Some of the Herd-book entries refer to animals worthy, in point of
profit, to be inscribed on any Dairy Roll in the world; and the progeny
of such stock are sought for by dairymen in all parts of the colonies.
Space will not permit me to speak on the breeding of these cattle;
but, in the “ thirty s,” Alex. Berry imported for this purpose several
high-class bulls from England, both Durhams and Ayrshires, also
Holsteins. At the same time Mr. Howe, of Glenlee, was dairying
with a fine herd of Ayrshires, and many noted importations have been
made covering the intervening years. The basis of the Illawarra
breed is, undoubtedly, the milking strain of Shorthorns, crossed
according* to the exigencies or judgment of the dairymen, chiefly with
the Ayrshire, sometimes Holsteins, and latterly with the Jerseys.
Some of the best herds, however, claim to be still pure Shorthorns.
There is no doubt that the higher type of the Illawarra cow of to-day
is admirably adapted to local conditions, and a decidedly profitable cow
for Australian dairymen.
We give a portrait of “ Honeycomb,” a typical beast of this breed,
bred by the late John Lindsey,of Kembla Park. Her test record is
gji lb. of milk per day, yielding 4 Tb. 4 oz. of butter, or 29 lb. 12 oz.
per week. With such a profitable strain of cattle we felt no suipuse
on receiving a letter this morning from a dairyman supplying a factory,
which said : u My herd is worth from £lB to £l2 each annually,
according to the price of butter.”
Want of space precludes me going into the matters of the rearing of
calves, pigs, and poultry, which are inseparably attached to our dany-
farms. I may briefly say, however, that the skim-milk is generally
utilised with other products in the rearing of pigs for bacon or the
butcher; and it is considered by many farmers that on an average
these pigs pay the annual rent. The poultry and eggs, similarly pro-
duced, are regarded by thrifty housewives as equal to providing for
the sustenance or clothing of the family.
Possibilities and Means of Extension.
The great expansion which has taken place in the dairying industry
of the Colony of late is strikingly illustrated by the fact that notwith-
standing the severe drought which has existed here for months, whereby
some thousands of cattle are reported to have died, and many factories,
both large and small, have had to close for months for want of milk,
the output for the whole Colony both of butter and cheese foi 1895,
as far as may he judged by returns up to the present, appears to
have been as large, if not larger, than for 1894. Not only have the
local demands been well supplied, but the imports of New South Wales
butter in the United Kingdom between Ist January and 21st December,
1895, were 30 per cent, more than during the same period of 1894,
and exceeded twice that of 1893. It is, therefore, just to suppose that
had we been favoured with an average fine season all through, the
output for the past year would have been surprisingly large. The
dairy export trade of this Colony has grown hitherto but slowly, but
from the large areas of lands and thousands of cattle that are now just
entering the industry, there cannot be the slightest doubt but that in
the immediate future it will be one of our most important sources of
income, and may expand indefinitely and rapidly.


We hear the question frequently asked, “Is there not a probability
of the thing being overdone in these colonies ? ” and grave doubts are
expressed as to the wisdom of further extension, lest prices will become
unremunerative. I see by the report of the Colonial Consignment
and Distributing Company, Limited (London), dated 27th December,
1895, that the United Kingdom imported during 1895, 137,840 tons of
butter, of which the Australian Colonies and New Zealand together
sent 15,250 tons, or about 11 per cent, only; whilst of cheese the
imports within the same period were 104,855 tons, of which Australia
and New Zealand contributed 4,665 tons, or near per cent. only.
We see no reason why we should not secure a much larger share of
this trade; in fact, we intend to do so. Our present competitors,
Denmark, Sweden, France, Holland, United States, Canada, Bussia,
Germany, and Belgium have advantages over us in much quicker
transit, with very low freights, and cheap skilled and careful labour.
But we have equally good or better opportunities on other lines.
Whilst they have to house and feed their cattle on hay and other
expensive foods for six months in the year, we have usually such
genial climatic conditions that abundance of rich succulent fodders
may be grown at all seasons, and throughout the year the cows are
never taken off their pastures.
Besides those now in work, thousands of acres of rich lands are
available, at very low rates, to be brought into the industry, and we
can remuneratively produce at prices much lower if need be, than have
been hitherto obtainable. The greatest factor, however, in our favour
is that of our seasons being the opposite to theirs, the time of onr
greatest and easiest production, is the time of their scarcity, with
increased costs and values. Still, it is not wise to be too optimistic,
and whilst we are confident that a large and remunerative trade may
be done by us, we must not overlook the indications of increased efforts
on the part of the aforesaid countries to retain their markets; and also
that we are likely to have a dangerous rival in Argentina with her
great economic advantages, to be followed by Cape Colony with cheap
lands, black labour, and only half our distance from market.
Keen competition and increased production mean receding prices,
and, notwithstanding the favourable position in which our dairymen
stand, by reason of their natural advantages, it is well to look and
decide how lower prices may be met without reducing the net returns
to the producer. Year by year we have improvements in the mechanical
appliances of the industry, in its working methods, and the extension
of co-operation on broader lines; but beyond these we require more
scientific and technical knowledge amongst our butter and cheese
makers and factory managers, and it is necessary that all such
should undergo a special course of instruction to qualify them for
such positions. The old days of “rule of thumb work are over, and
these men, like officers in a great army, must be scientifically trained if
they would be of equal skill with their opponents. At the Hawkes-
■ bnry Agricultural College such a course of dairy instruction is given,
both scientific and practical, and it is gratifying to record that students,
having passed through this course, are now holding responsible posi-
tions in connection with dairy manufactures. Bespecting our dairy
farmers, it should be said there are large numbers who thoroughly


understand their business —none better —whose methods of work are
most economical and profitable ; but, then again, we have large num-
bers in this colony, as elsewhere, who haying but recently taken to the
industry, have little real knowledge of anything connected with it, and
who, consequently, are doing much unremuneratiye work. These men
require to be yisited by travelling instructors to fully advise them in
pastures, fodders, improved and economic farm methods, with other
allied subjects, for the purpose of cheapening the production of an
ample and regular supply of clean rich milk.
The Government might take a more extended oversight of the
industry than is given by the present Dairies Supervision Act, and
take cognisance, not only of the farm and dairy buildings and cattle,
but also of the suitability and condition of dairy machinery, and the
qualifications of dairy managers. Also the compulsory registration of
export brands, and the penalising of misrepresentation on the exterior
of a package. There are some who advocate the official grading of
butter before exportation, which I am assured by exporters and large
salesmen in England to be of no value whatever at the port of arrival,
as the article may not be landed in the same condition in which it was
shipped, and when put on the market it is always sold on present
merits.
The simple method of registering export brands would throw the
responsibility of quality on the shipper, who would strive to maintain
the reputation of his brand. A minor benefit I can see in grading is
that a number of our present butter-makers, whose goods, through our
faulty system of selling, obtain top price, would soon learn that their
makes were not really of first quality, and would have to mend their
ways or give place to better men.
The Government has expressed its intention of assisting the industry
by means of increased facilities for transit to place of manufacture or
port of shipment, providing* cool storage if necessary, and in various
other ways. For this purpose, it has already appointed a Board oi
Advice, which is intended to work in various ways in the interests of
producers and exporters.




NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT MEAT-MARKET, DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY.
Lessees :—Geddes, Birt, & Co., Limited.


Meat Export Trade
BY CUTHBERT FETHERSTONHAUGH.
Impeoved methods of distribution have once and for all exploded tire
Malthusian theory, which for a term took such a hold of the public
mind, and instead of the population of the world outpacing food pro-
duction; we find every year food becoming cheaper and more easily
procured. Without running the risk; therefore; of being considered
altogether Utopian one may picture to oneself a time when; on account
of increased facilities of distribution; there will be no starving men and
women on the face of the earth.
Meat Export a New Departure.
The export of meat from New South Wales is almost a new departure;
and was forced upon graziers in 1891; when; after three exceptional
good seasons; they lound all local avenues for the disposal of their surplus
stock closed. It was plainly seen that in some shape or other; whether
frozen; chilled; canned; or as tallow; surplus stock would have to be
got rid of by exporting it out of the colony. There were nearly
62;000;000 sheep; and the country was at that time very much over-
stocked. The surplus consisted for the most part of animals not fit
for export as dressed mutton; so that the “pots” were called into
requisition; and the old wasteful; but prompt; method of boiling down
for tallow was resorted to. Millions of sheep were thus disposed of;
and together with numbers of good sheep; a great clearance was made
of old and inferior stock; leaving more room also for sheep to be
fattened.
On all sides we hear it said that the meat export trade of Australia
is capable of almost unlimited expansion; and the writer has at all
times freely expressed the opinion that an immense future lies before
that trade. On no industry is Australia so dependent as the pastoral;
and in its turn that industry is dependent on the successful disposal of
its surplus stock. Until, therefore, a satisfactory minimum value has
been established for that surplus, the great pastoral industry must
continue in a depressed condition, and in sympathy the whole Colony
must needs suffer.
The present depression, intensified, it is true, by the uncertain state
of the labour market, which deters capital from being invested, is
chiefly due to the enormous fall in the value of pastoral products.
There is, however, now a decided advance in our staple commodity,
wool, an advance which there is good reason to believe has come to
stay. If, therefore, by judicious action, the disposal of surplus stock
can be placed on better lines, we may reasonably look for a very
marked revival in our greatest industry, and a consequent improve-
ment all along the line.

The number of lambs annually weaned from 56,000,000 slieep should
be, as near as possible, 12,000,000. Tire annual decrease from mortality,
&c., on 56,000,000 is estimated at about 3,000,000. We have, therefore,
an annual surplus of some 9,000,000 sheep to dispose of, if the flocks of
the Colony are to be kept at an even number. Of this 9,000,000, some
4,000,000 are consumed locally, including those sent to Tasmania and
Victoria, leaving, say 5,000,000, for export as frozen and canned meat,
extract, and tallow. To this we must add imports from Queensland,
which will vary from half a million to a million, according to the seasons.
If the seasons were regular, and there were no droughts, there would
therefore be abouts,soo,ooosheep for export; but during the last twenty-
one years the losses from adverse seasons amount to over 33,000,000
head, or an average of over 1,500,000 sheep a year. We cannot, there-
fore, count on more than 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 sheep as being available
for export. Some years there may be as many as 6,000,000, some years
only 1,000,000. If sheep-breeders take up cross-breeding to any extent
there will be a large available surplus, as numbers of cross-breds go
away as lambs, while all mature from a year to eighteen months earlier
than do merinos. If there are 4,000,000 sheep available for export, not
more than half of that number can be expected to go away as frozen
mutton, the balance will leave the country canned, or as extract and tallow.
There ought not to be much difficulty in disposing of 2,000,000 frozen
sheep annually from New South Vales, and this is as much as we can
count on exporting in the present state of the development of the Colony.
Cattle.
The cattle and beef export trade of New South Wales is very small as
compared with that of sheep. As a matter of fact we have no surplus of
our own for export. Everything above our own wants comes from
Queensland, and until the present year the export of frozen beef has
been nominal. If beef recovers in value at home it is more than pro-
bable that there will be in future a considerable trade with England in
frozen beef, as sheep have done so badly in some parts of the Colony of
late years that a little encouragement would without doubt induce
graziers to substitute cattle for sheep in those parts. The number of
cattle in New South Wales on the Ist of January, 1895, was about
2,455,500. The yearly increase may be estimated at 400,000 and the
net imports from Queensland 100,000, while the average loss fromadverse
seasons may be put at 80,000 a year. The relative position of the
principal beef-exporting countries can be seen from the following table
in which 700 lb. has been assumed as the average weight per beast : —•


Fi •ozen Meat.
The export of frozen meat was initiated as far back as 1880, but
ic demand for slieep to stock new country caused tke trade to be
neglected, and New Zealand growers took up the running with suck
good-will tkat from an experimental cargo in 1881, landed in splendid
order after muck difficulty, tke trade kas expanded into tke enormous
dimensions of over 2,409,000 skeep in 1895. In 1891 New South
VV ales skeep-owners were forced to take action, and some kundred tons
o± frozen meat were sent to London. Tke trade grew to 365 000
carcases in 1893 to 534,000 in 1894, but 1895 kas seen a great develop-
ment in tke trade, and over a million carcases of frozen mutton
kave been exported. The shrinkage from drought and from the late
very severe winter will, without doubt, largely curtail the export
of meat from New Soutk Wales for tke next few years. Should any
considerable shipments be made the local market must advance rapidly,
with the result of at once curtailing any more shipments. Since 1883,
which was shortly after tke first large shipment of frozen meat from
-New Zealand, there kas been a heavy fall in England in tke value of all
meat, but the fall in value of frozen meat kas been very muck more
pronounced than tkat in home grown. In 1884 tke value of prime
home-grown mutton was 7Jd. a Ik. In 1887 it fell to a little over 6d.
recovered again in 1889 to BJd., and fell again to 7d., at about which
average value it kas stood for tke last five years.
New Zealand mutton has fallen from an average of 6d. in 1884 to
an average of 4Jd. in 1893. Tke average for 1895 will be muck lower.
ustralian mutton was worth 5Jd. in 1884, and it also kas steadily
fallen in value till now the average price is under 3d. It will be seen,
t reiefore, that while there was only Id. a Ik. decline in value of
best English mutton from 1884 to 1893, New Zealand declined in the
same time nearly 2d., and Australian, 2Jd. a Ik. We need not
look behind the scenes for an occult reason for this difference in the
it ative decline. The cause is without doubt to be found primarily in
t le increased supplies of New Zealand and Australian meat; but the
irregular and spasmodic manner in which frozen meat has been put
on the market has also very much to do with it. In this connection
it must be borne in mind that the period at which frozen meat was
first introduced was one of exceptionally high prices, and meat had
been quoted higher than for forty years previously. The apparently
ov prices that have ruled since may be only a return to previous
noimal conditions ; but it must also be remembered that owing to a
variety of causes the value for all products have been at a lower level
than ordinary during the last few years.
Pi ozen meat has in no way affected the value of best
mutton ; the two commodities never come into competition. They
inn, in fact, on parallel lines. The price of either is not influenced
by the relative value of the other, but by the supply on hand of each
particular meat. For instance, in 1886 there was a substantial rise of
neaily Id. in English mutton because English sheep had decreased in
that year by nearly half a million, yet at the same time there was a
fall in frozen mutton in sympathy with the large increase in importa-
tions of 700,000 frozen sheep. Again, in 1888, there was a rise of

Ifd. in English mutton owing to a decrease in the number of sheep in
the United Kingdom, but there was scarcely any advance at all in
frozen mutton, as the importations of that article were large. In 1890
and 1891 there was a steady all-round fail, and no wonder, as in those
two years there was an increase of over 2,500,000 sheep on the
market, of which 1,500,000 were drawn from the United Kingdom.
It will thus be seen that the sympathy so often expressed for the poor
English sheep farmer has so far been thrown away, as frozen sheep
importations have in no way affected the value of prime, home-grown
mutton, though without doubt it does come into competition with
inferior home grown. In considering the English market, it must
further be noted that side by side with the large increase in frozen
meat imports, during the eight years previous to 1894 there had been an
enormous increase of United Kingdom sheep, in fact 5,000,000, giving
an increase of some 300,000 additional sheep annually* That the
United Kingdom has been able to absorb so great a number augurs
well for the future of our trade. But it is well to mention here that
while the total meat bill of the United Kingdom amounts to over
£100,000,000 sterling a year, of which one-third consists of imported
meat, Australia up to last year only contributed per cent, of the
imported article.
The share of British trade enjoyed by the principal exporting
countries can best be seen in the following table: —
It will be seen that Australia bas doubled its exports since 1892,
in four years, while New Zealand increased its output from 1,500,000
to nearly 2,500,000, tire advance being principally in lambs. The Plate
also increased its exports by about 500,000 sheep in the same period.
The total addition in the four years was nearly 2,000,000 head, or over
55 per cent, advance.
In spite of the largeness of the above figures, only about 23 per
cent, of the meat supply of Great Britain is drawn from abroad though
the dependence on outside sources for food is each year becoming
more evident. In this connection a comparison between the home and
imported article, and the total meat consumption is of interest.

* Estimated Supply and Consumption of Meat annually per head of
the Population of the United Kingdom :
The tendency for the consumption of meat to increase is clearly
visible in the above table. The check received in 1893 was due to the
falling off in the supplies of chilled meat from the United States and
the recovery is not yet complete. Doubtless, if the meat is available
and British trade is fairly brisk, the rate of consumption of 1892 will
soon be again reached, if not passed.
Canned Meat.
Until lately we have had only one meat-preserving factory in Hew
South Wales putting out any quantity of meat —namely, the Sydney
Meat Preserving Company. In 1887 that company exported some
4,000 tons of preserved meat, increasing the output to over 7,000 tons
last year. This company has been a g*reat relief to the graziers of
New South Wales, who, recognising its value, subsidise it liberally.
Several other canning factories have lately come into operation,
notably those at Bourke and -Aberdeen, while the Graziers’ Meat
Export Company propose to preserve meat on a large scale. The
increase of meat-preserving will materially assist gfaziers, and it is
estimated will add from Bd. to Is. to the value of a sheep. The
making of extract should always be combined with that of meat-
preserving, and between the two it may reasonably be hoped that,
useful as graziers have found it of late years, the wasteful system of
boiling' down sheep for tallow only will be at an end. A new method
has been lately patented in Hew South Wales which it is considered
will materially lessen the cost of production of extract. Unfortunately
the value of this article is at present at a very low level, so that,
unless more economical methods of extraction can be found, it will
hardly pay to make it.
The increase of meat-canning operations will tend to regulate the
frozen meat export, for canning adds from 10 per cent, to 15 percent,
to the net value of a sheep as compared with boiling only. Frozen
meat at times rules so low in the Home market as to cause owners to
send their sheep to the pots. It xollows that, if, say, 12 per cent, more
can be obtained by canning, owners will often boil and can in
preference to trying the Home market, and this applies more especially
to second-class sheep. The value of canning to graziers has been
much overlooked. Old ewes and second-rate rather lean wethers,
neither being sheep that pay to export in a frozen state, will yield
* From Weddell’s Review for 1895.


from 12 to 18 Ib. of raw, lean meat, which should return to the owner |d.
a Bb. As this meat would scarcely yield any tallow, if boiled, the
return from canning is all gain to the grower, and the Colony generally
gains in an increased export of produce. There is, without doubt, a
great future before the preservec. meat trade of Australia, as first-class
meat for canning is cheap, costing not over fd. a lb., while inferior
meat, such as is used for canning operations in America, is not worth
more than l 2 d. a lb., whereas for such meat the American packer has
to pay from Id. to a lb., and he could not buy such meat as
ordinarily is here available under 3d. The difference in freight is
very trifling, and the cost of putting up the meat need not be any more
here than in America. It follows, therefore, that we should be able
to capture this valuable trade.
Live Cattle.
The export of live cattle cannot be considered a success, nor is it
likely to become one. There are difficulties in the way which could
only be surmounted by good management, but this one essential has
hitherto been conspicuous by its absence. The cost of freight, and the
fact that the beasts are all bush cattle and not accustomed to being
artificially fed, are the main drawbacks, otherwise there are no insur-
mountable obstacles. Given the right sort of cattle, proper ships, good
and suitable food, and experienced men in charge, there is no reason
why cattle cannot be delivered in England in first-class condition, but in
any case the cost of freight will always be a very serious item.
Chilled Meat.
The four shipments of chilled meat that have been made to England
have scarcely resulted in success. The first failed owing’ to a break-
down in the machinery. The money results in the second were good;
but although the third shipment of beef arrived in a very satisfactory
condition, it met with an exceptionally bad market, and as the beef
was from New Zealand, and purchased in a high market, the shipment
must have resulted in loss. Nothing but failure could have been
expected from the fourth shipment, which was from Queensland, as the
one essential was neglected, namely, the keeping the meat at an even
temperature for which a thermometer was required, and none was used.
Chilled meat is carried in America 1,500 miles to New York, then by
sea 3,000 miles to Liverpool, and then railed over 200 miles further to
London and delivered in perfect order. Great care is exercised from
start to finish, but the beef is packed both in the cars and on the ships
nearly as closely as if it were frozen. There would seem to be no
difficulty in carrying beef from Australia to England at 28*50 F., that
is, just a little below freezing point. The juices in beef, it may be
remarked, freeze at 28*80° E., as against water at 32° F., and chilled
meat should be carried at not under 29°, and if possible at about 31°.
Many experienced practical men are satisfied that the conveyance of
meat in a chilled condition to England will prove a success, and they
are not in the least discouraged because the shipments so far have been
attended by partial failure. If the meat be chilled in chambers in
which the air has been sterilised, and out of which all moisture and
gases emanating from the meat are extracted, and kept in cold, dry.


sterilised air till delivered in London, success will, in all probability, be
attained. At tire same time, it will most likely be found tliat if tire
meat be drilled at the outset in chambers in which the air is kept dry
and sterilised, and from which the moisture emanating from the
carcases is carefully extracted, that afterwards it may be carried safely
in ordinary cool chambers ;but this will have to Ire ascertained by
actual experiment. The sterilisation of air, by means of which it is
thought chilled meat can be successfully conveyed long distances could
be very easily effected by a slight modification of the now discarded
Haslem dry air system. But this system is much more expensive than
the ammonia system. At the same time it may be mentioned here that
some of the large passenger steamers are using the dry air machines in
preference to the ammonia machines on account of the danger of
leakage. There is no difficulty at all in carrying chilled meat by rail,
for Dr. Perkins, of California, has successfully introduced a process by
which the overflow air of the Westinghouse brake is ingeniously used
for the supply of cold, dry, sterilised air in the conveyance of fruit or
meat in the cars. Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance
of bringing the conveyance of meat by this method to a successful
issue, as once Australian meat is successfully put on the Home market
chilled instead of frozen, future progress will be comparatively simple.
To conserve and convey meat by cold, dry, sterilised air need not
involve much expenditure, while the article produced will yield much
higher returns than frozen meat, and will keep better after being
opened up than meat chilled in the usual way.
Defrosting .
It is, however, more than possible that the lately introduced process
of defrosting meat will give better results to the grower than chilling.
So far, defrosted Australian meat of similar quality as American
chilled beef has not been able to compete with the chilled, in spite of
the smaller cost of conveyance, as chilled meat occupies more space
than frozen. The system of defrosting must assist the sale of frozen
meat, and it is perhaps just as well that it can only be successfully
applied to really good meat that has been well taken care of. An inde-
pendent witness writes of it : <e I saw defrosted beef and mutton looking
as fresh, clean, and bright, as if only a few hours from the slaughter-
house. It was, I understood, for the West End trade.” The operation
of defrosting costs Jd. a lb., while the meat thus treated realises |d. a
lb. over similar meat not thus treated.
Future of the Trade.
That an immense future lies before the meat export trade of Aus-
tralia is apparent when we consider the wonderful expansion of the
Hew Zealand frozen meat trade, which from an export of a few sheep
in 1882 has grown to over 2,000,000 head in 1894, valued at over
£1,162,000. In 1883 only 5,400 tons of frozen meat was exported
from Australasia and the Plate as compared to 118,000 tons in 1894.

meat received in 1894 in England was equal to 8 per cent, of the total
consumption of beef and mutton in the United Kingdom, and last year
no less than 4,500,000 frozen carcases were received. Again, although
the irregularity of our frozen meat consignments is one of the gravest
difficulties with which we have to contend, yet the gluts and low prices
caused by this irregularity have been the means of forcing the meat
into consumption; and the masses have become alive to its value.
Until this occurred its use was confined to the middle and upper
classes. Once the masses get over their prejudices, and get their
teeth into good meat, retailed to them at moderate prices, we need not
fear for the future. The opening of the Manchester ship canal, giving
direct trade with Liverpool and Manchester, should be of great
assistance in the expansion of Australian meat consumption, as Man-
chester itself is considered the greatest centre of distribution for Aus-
tralian mutton in all England. Most of the important railways are
connected with the canal, and within a radius of 40 miles of Man-
chester there is a population of some 8,000,000 of people, said to be
the largest consumers of merino mutton in England. At present all
our meat is shipped to London, situated in one corner of the country,
whence it has to be railed into the provinces at a cost of a and
over per lb. By shipping direct to Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow,
Cardiff, and other ports considerable expenditure in rail freight will be
avoided, as well as depreciation in the quality of the meat, while the
advantages of having four or five centres from which to distribute,
instead of only one, cannot be overestimated. The first shipment to
Manchester arrived in excellent condition, and already steps are being
taken to increase the facilities for distribution from this centre by the
reduction of railway rates into Yorkshire. Excellent accommodation
for storing perishable goods is available at Manchester, more especi-
ally for the reception of frozen meat, and the initiation of the trade
has been under most favourable conditions. In 1888 experts declare
that it was not possible to put Australian meat on the Dome market
at under 6d. a Th., yet it can now be sold at a profit at less than half
that price. In 1883 a London salesman advised Kew Zealand exporters
that a supply of 4,000 frozen sheep a week would be ample, and that
any large increase on that number would create a glut; yet in 1898
the average monthly imports of frozen meat amounted to 75,000 sheep,
and there was no glut. Moreover, the reduction in freight and charges
enables exporters to net more now selling sheep at Bd. a lb. than they
did formerly when sold at double the price.
There has been a remarkable development lately in the meat export
works of our Colony, and within a few years some twenty sets of works
have been erected. Shortly, almost every district of Yew South ”W ales
will be supplied with a meat factory. During the past year two of our
largest companies have duplicated their works : a third, which we may
say started in that year, propose to greatly extend theirs, another has
added meat-freezing works to their ice-making plant. The largest
meat-preserving factory in the Colony has been enlarged and improved ;
another inland meat-preserving firm has greatly extended its opera-
tions. An extensive new freezing works, thoroughly up to date, has
made a most successful start in Riverina. Two more inland chilling
works have been completed, and three others are in course of construe


tion. All tills shows very plainly that those most intimately con-
nected with the meat export trade are fully convinced that a most
successful future lies before it.
Continental Trade.
Though it will probably be a considerable time before Australian
frozen meat makes its way on to the Continent, yet it can only be a matter
of time, for the interests which are at play at present to keep out
imported meat mush sooner or later, give way. Once the Continent
of Europe relaxes existing restrictions, and allows our meat to compete
for place, our difficulty will be not to find a market for the surplus
stock, but to find sufficient stock to supply the demand. Only a few
years ago, France was an exporter of sheep; now we are told she
requires 1,000,000 sheep and 20,000 cattle annually to meet her
demands. Were it not for the restrictions which at present hamper
the import of Australian meat into France, that country should be an
excellent market for frozen merino mutton and canned meat. The
last-named should more especially find a ready sale if put up in 14-ffi.
cans, for the use of restaurants ; for in France joints are not so much
in favour as stew r s and soups.
JL.
The prospects of the trade have of late become far more hopeful. The
Special Commissioner of the Sydney Morning Herald writes that a new
company initiated by Mons. Brun with a capital of £230,000, has built
cold storage rooms, sale rooms, and insulated cars, to bring frozen
meat from Havre. Beef and mutton is quoted wholesale in this market
at Bd. to 12d. per lb., and choice joints run to 18d. per lb. retail. As
the sheep most favoured in France is small, good lean young meat of
from 35 lb. to 42 lb. the carcase, there should be an opening for exactly
that class of sheep which at present it is found difficult to sell to
advantage, viz., young ewes cast for wool and ewes 5 or 6 years old
cast for age. If the Continental governments would open their ports,
or even reduce somewhat the present duties and restrictions placed on
Australian meat, great headway would immediately be made.
A comparison of population and live stock will afford some idea of
the extent of the market. G-ermany, with 60,000,000 inhabitants, has
only 14,000,000 sheep. France, 38,000,000 people, and 30,000,000 sheep.
Belgium, 6,000,000 persons, and only 366,000 sheep. Already there
are storerooms and refrigerating works in Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne,
and other places, and with care and energy on the part of exporters,
the huge continental outlet must ere long be won.
We think enough has been put forward to show that there is an
unlimited market for our surplus stock if certain conditions are
observed.
Conditions to he observed at this end.
In the first place, the supply of meat should be ample and continuous,
in the second place it should consist of a palatable and marketable
article, and, finally, the price should be sufficiently low to enable it to
displace less attractive and less palatable food products. The first
condition is the one most difficult to fulfil, not only is it difficult to
keep up a continuous supply of fat stock fit for export; but occasion-
ally it is no easy matter to maintain a full supply of the raw material.


as it were; that is to say, stock that can be put into marketable con-
dition when the season is favourable. This first condition is the stilfest
problem the Australian grazier has to solve. A combination of agri-
culture with grazing, by means of which large quantities of ensilage
and hay might be conserved, not for a rainy, but for a dry day, would
enable much stock to be saved through a drought, which otherwise
would perish. These animals would be ready to be fattened when the
season improved, but to fatten sheep right through a drought is, we
fear, beyond the capabilities of the Colony. In spite of adverse
seasons we are, however, of opinion that, given a good market at the
other end, the requisite sheep will be readily fattened and supplied.
Up to the present time there has been no inducement to graziers to
fatten stock. The fat market has been most uncertain, and at times
store stock has actually ruled higher than fat stock. The cry in New
Zealand at the initiation of their great meat trade was that a supply,
ridiculously small compared to present exports, could not be possibly
kept up. But events have shown that, given a good market, the supply
will be forthcoming. Wiseacres used to say that a supply of 300 to 400
head per day would soon deplete the Christchurch, New Zealand, dis-
trict ; but now 6,000 sheep per day are put through the two big works
near Christchurch.
The second condition, that the meat shall be presented as a palatable
and marketable article, is entirely in our own hands. We need not
necessarily export heavy, or even prime fat sheep. The London market
no doubt looks for prime crossbred sheep, sheep of moderate weight;
but the markets which we hope to open up more fully by means of
direct trade to Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, &c., prefer leaner and
smaller mutton, such as we can so easily supply. The Londoner likes
a fat sheep, but the artizan of Birmingham and Manchester working
constantly amongst oil, has acquired a strong dislike to fat meat, and
lean merino mutton should just suit. But it must in all cases be a good
marketable article, well handled, well killed —in a word, well taken care
of. There can be no doubt that the system in vogue in New South Wales
in killing the stock close to their own pastures will be of the greatest
assistance in producing a good article; and we are of opinion that the
system of chilling inland and freezing later on at the port of shipment
will be found more conducive to the production of a palatable and
tender meat, than that of freezing inland where the stock are slaughtered.
A sheep chilled from twenty-four to thirty-six hours, before being
frozen, after having been cooled for six or eight hours previously, must
necessarily be more tender and palatable than a sheep that is frozen
within a few hours after it leaves the butcher’s hook. It must be
borne in mind, that the British consumer is still to a great extent
prejudiced against frozen meat, and more especially against frozen
beef. It is, therefore, necessary to make every exertion in every
possible way to improve the article we put before him. That some
progress is made is evident, for we are told that Australian sheep
have during the last two years shown an all round improvement.
The managers of meat export companies should resolutely decline to
send away objectionable sheep, and under this head should be ranged,
not only sheep too lean and shelly, but sheep too fat and gross. It
would also bo a great improvement were the sheep properly graded.


merino wethers, say, in two classes of 45 18. to 55 53., and 55 15. to
65 15.; merino ewes, 40 15. to 50 15.; crossbred wethers, 56 15. to 60 15.,
and 60 15. to 70 15.; and crossbred ewes, 50 15. to 60 15. No sheep
outside these classes should be sent away. In this way the market
can much more readily be met.
A good can be learnt from America. In the States the
system for the disposal of meat products is almost perfect. Packers
have found out by experience exactly the description of animal or of
meat that suits the consumers in each portion of that immense
territory. No packer, for instance, would consign light cattle to
Boston or New York, or heavy beasts to Baltimore. They consider
their customers" tastes and cater accordingly. Australia, on the
contrary, dumps all her meat upon one market, and then finds fault
with the taste of the consumers instead of endeavouring to meet
their requirements. If success is to be secured, it must first be
ascertained exactly what is the description of sheep in favour in
different parts of United Kingdom, and then a wise descrimination
must be shown in the shipments. The American “ packer ” never
loses sight of his meat until it is actually sold to the consumer. The
Australian, on the contrary, seems to think his responsibility and
interest ceases when once the meat leaves the freezing room. It may
be at zero to-day and at 20 degrees to-morrow for all he can tell, and
as a matter of fact this not infrequently does occur on board ship.
Sometimes it is exposed and softened and dust-begrimed between the
ship and the market, where, as we have said, it is committed to the
tender mercies of consignees competing to quit their stuff.
We must not leave to others what we should do ourselves, and we
must not be discouraged by rebuffs and failures, but steadily put
our meat on the Home market regularly and systematically, satisfied
to accept a moderate average price one month with another. As to
the third condition, the meat export trade of Australia can be indefi-
nitely expanded only by the displacement of other food products in
the Home market, and this fact is much overlooked. To achieve this
either a letter article must he produced at equal price, or as good an
article at a lower price. Exporters must, therefore, seek profits not
so much from high prices for the meat as from a lower cost in pro-
ducing it. High prices would simply cripple the trade. It may be
very pleasant for individual growers to hear of their meat selling well,
but increased values will be followed by a decreased consumption'
and a steady trade will be impossible. The reaction will not
infrequently be to lower rates than would otherwise have occurred
and in fine, it is these fluctuating prices which to a great extent
prevent the meat export trade from being put on a stable basis.
Growers must not pay too much heed to the ups and downs of the
Home maiket. Through good and bad tunes they should continue
steadily to ship, for the low prices of to-day will be counterbalanced
by the high prices of to-morrow, and a fair average will in the long
run be obtained. If only 5 per cent, of the families in England would
consume 3 15. of meat additional per week, it would require 1,000,000'
sheep to supply them. This may be achieved. The prejudice aga'inst
frozen mutton is doubtless wearing away as consumers learn its value
and become more expert in thawing and cooking it.
o


It is absolutely necessary tliat those who supply retailers should be
in a position to give a steady, constant supply of meat at a uniform
and moderate value. The aim should be, therefore, not high prices,
but a large trade at moderate values and low cost. A large volume
of business will enable ship owners to carry meat at reduced freight,
will cause lower insurance and cold storage charges, and will enable
salesmen to reduce their rates.
Conditions to he observed at the other end.
When we come to the conditions to be observed at the other end,
in order to ensure success, we have a much more difficult problem to
solve, especially when the matter is considered from this side. There
seems to be very little doubt that there is among Home buyers that
which is so much lacking among sellers —viz., organisation and com-
bination. It will be generally conceded that Australian meat goes
into too many hands, there are too many consignees, many of them the
reverse of strong. Hot infrequently very full advances have been made
on meat received in England, and consignees do not care to increase
the risk by incurring storage expense, which is extremely high, being*
9 d. per lb. a month, as against in the Colony; consequently the meat
is put on the market irrespective of the state of supplies. More con-
centration and combination are wanted. As things are at present con-
ducted the competition in the disposal of meat is among sellers instead
of among buyers. It seems to be fully admitted by those who ought to
know that Australian meat does not get fair play; and it is evident
when Home-grown meat is at 6|d. to 7d., and good frozen mutton at a
great deal less than half that, there is a screw loose somewhere. Here
are some quotations with regard to the sale of Australian meat on the
Home market: —“At Home our meat gets no recognition, and producers
get no benefit.” “The Smithfield salesmen and butchers get all the
profit. These men naturally do not wish to expand a trade that is
capable of making their fortune within its present small and compact
limit.” u Four million of frozen carcases may reach London in one
year, and yet but little frozen mutton be found on the retail market.
These frozen carcases disappear among the Smithfield butchers and
cannot be traced.” “The butchers make fortunes, the producers
nothing. There is no doubt about the sheep exporter being bled by
the London retailers, and still the Smithfield ring dictates prices.”
“ The rise and fall of frozen meat here is simply a matter of bulls and
bears.”
There is no open sale, we are told, and most of the business is done
in “whispers.” A great deal of the meat passes at times through
three or four different hands before it reaches the consumer.
Our meat is, for the most part, not sold on its merits. It is stated
by shrewd men, who have carefully looked into the matter, and their
statements are fully borne out by the sworn evidence of butchers,
given before the Royal Commission on Meat Marking, that quantities
of Australian frozen meat are sold as Welsh and even as English
mutton, while a good deal more is sold as New Zealand, and the
inferior only goes before the British consumer as Australian. It is
evident this course of procedure must exactly suit the Home purveyor,
for the lower the wholesale price for Australian mutton the more


profit lie must make. Again, tlie way commission is paid to salesmen
must militate against the exporter obtaining tbe highest price avail-
able, for salesmen are not paid commission on values realised but are
paid on the weight of meat sold irrespective of value. It is of no con-
sequence to them whether the meat fetches 2d. or 3d., they get their
commission just the same.
• We are apt to lay a great deal of stress on English prejudice; but
if there be prejudice, it is better that it should be respected, and that
endeavours should be made to remove it. This has not been the course
pursued; but on the contrary, quantities of unsuitable and inferior meat
is exported both from New Zealand and Australia. It has been well
said that “ It is only by carefully catering to the tastes and by respect-
ing even the prejudices of foreign consumers that the export trade can
be built up.”
Reduction of Cost of Production.
Since the establishment of meat export companies by sheepowners,
the consolidated charges for putting meat on the Home market have
been reduced from 10 to 25 per cent. That means a reduction of about
|d. a lb., which, on a 56-lb. sheep, amounts to no less than 2s. 4d. When
it is remembered that Id., a lb. net return is more than the average
received by growers, it will be seen that a reduction of |d. a lb. in the
charges means an advance of 50 per cent, in the net return to the
grazier. The reduced charges enable Australian meat to be now sold
in England at 2|d. a lb., and still yield a moderate profit, and this
figure is sufficiently low to displace the other foods such as currants,
edible tallow, and hog products if a supply of good meat can be main-
tained. The cost of production must be brought to the lowest possible*
point, and as we cannot grow our meat for any less, it follows that we
have been moving in the right direction by endeavouring to reduce
the factory charges, freight, and other costs. It is in reduction of cost
rather than in the advance of values that the efforts of Australian
graziers must be directed. In this connection, it may be mentioned
that during the month of January, 1894, the United Kingdom took
from the United States no less than 35,200,000 lb. of bacon, equal to
700,000 50-lb. sheep. Bacon is worth in England wholesale about
s|d. a lb. Now, here is a food which should easily be displaced by
good mutton. Before frozen sheep were put on the Home market,
hog products were the cheapest meats going into consumption, but
frozen meats have been sold at such a low price as already to displace
large quantities of this food, a fact which is admitted by the Secretary
for Agriculture for the United States.
Irregularity of Supplies.
Nothing so much retards the expansion of the demand for Australian
meat as the irregularity of shipment. It is almost always a case of
either a glut or a famine. Sometimes two months elapse without an
arrival in England of frozen meat, and then two or three immense
cargoes arrive together. One week the market is in short supply, the
next it is over-stocked. And this is not altogether due to the inter-
mittance in available freight, but to a great extent to the irregularity
of the supply of tonnage. With seventy-six vessels in the Australian


and New Zealand trade. Laying' a carrying capacity of over
2,500,000 sheep, and equal to the conveyance of 6,000,000 sheep a
year, there should certainly he no difficulty as to tonnage, and if they
could he sure that growers would regulate supplies at this end, there is
no doubt that the owners of these seventy-six ships would manage to
accommodate themselves to the trade. In fact exporters have it in
their own hands whether to he at the heck and call of shipowners, or
to have the movements of the vessels governed hy the requirements of
the trade. As an instance of the irregularity of shipments, it may he
mentioned that in the first three months of 1893 there were 386,000
frozen carcases delivered in London; hut in the first three months of
1894 there were only 216,000 so delivered, while for the remaining
nine months of 1894 there were 1,800,000 carcases put ashore in
London, as against 1,470,000 in 1893—a deficiency in the first three
months of 170,000, and a surplus in the last nine months of 330,000.
No trade can stand this. Again in 1894, owing to a short supply,
Queensland heef went up in price, and unfortunately the only Queens-
land heef in the market was hy no means prime. The result was that
buyers turned to American cliilled heef, and dropped the Queensland
Trade, and even lower prices did not bring them hack. No attempt
seems to have been made in the Colonies to remedy this, though action
to that end has been mooted more than once. Obviously much could
he done hy having abundant cold storage in the Colonies. Better
terms could then he made for freight, and the power to hold and to
regulate supplies would to a great extent obviate gluts and famines at
the other end.
Cold Storage.
There is now abundant cold storagn in England, and more is being*
constantly added. It has been estimated that there is already room
for 1,200,000 carcases of sheep. In addition to the extensive cold
stores in London, there are others at Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle,
Liverpool, and Cardiff, besides those of NelsoiTs, Eastman's, and the
Plate. Cold stores have been lately erected at Sheffield, and are
being erected at Birmingham and Hull, and it is intended to erect
extensive premises at Glasgow and other places. The large new stores
being built close to Smithfield will also be of great service to the
trade; at the same time the charges for cold storage are far too high,
and the erection of cold stores for the accommodation of New South
Wales produce both in the Colony and at the other end is a matter
well worth the consideration of our Government. There would be
considerable advantage in increasing the cold storage accommodation
in the Colony. There would be less probability of deterioration in the
meat from exposure, &c., if held at this end, and the accumulation of
meat in the Colony would affect prices less than the heavy stocks held
immediately under the notice of buyers. The regularity of shipments
could also much more easily be secured.
Distribution.
The opening of retail shops in the old country for the sale of frozen
meat is strongly advocated by some people j but we are of opinion
that what is required is an adaptation of the system that obtains in the


United States. Almost every town in the States is provided with a
cold storage wholesale meat market, whence retail butchers are
supplied with all they require, and where meat can be kept for them.
If this system could be introduced into England, nothing could so
much assist the expansion of the frozen meat trade. A great saving
would be effected, and the Home consumer could be provided with
Australian meat in a much more attractive form, especially if a
defrosting department were combined with the wholesale meat market.
If Home consumers could be encouraged to use cold storage for the
preservation of their own food products, it would help greatly to
introduce and accustom them to the use of frozen meat. Nothing*
would so much assist the expansion of the trade as the establishment
of these cold stores throughout the length and breadth of the land.
The possibility of providing cold storage all over England is a matter
which should occupy the attention of Australian meat exporters, and
is of far more importance, while being more practicable, than the
establishment of retail shops. One handsomely fitted up shop might
possibly be added to the wholesale meat market with advantage, but
more in the way of an advertisement than for the purpose of direct
profitable distribution.
Forward Business.
A considerable business is done with Australia and New Zealand on
the c.i.f. principle, that is, cost, insurance, and freight are paid by the
exporter, who either delivers over the ship’s side at the other end, or
f.o.b. at this end. The buyer of course takes all the risk of the
market, a division of chances which should be encouraged as much as
possible; for although it is the buyer’s business to buy at as low a
price as he can out here, yet it is necessarily also his business to keep
the market up at the other end.
A considerable quantity of meat has been purchased in Sydney
during the past year by Home speculators at about Id. a lb. and
under; but in order that the owners should get a fair margin of profit,
it is necessary that Id. a lb. should be netted after paying all charges.
All meat sold for forward delivery should be approved by the con-
signee’s agent at this end previous to shipment.
Inspection.
No meat should be allowed to be exported without a certificate
having been first obtained from a Government inspector, declaring
that it is sound and free from disease, and this should, of course, also
be done in the case of all live stock sent away.
The United States has a complete system of inspection, and lately such
stringent regulations have been issued as to cause exporters to object.
But the result is that freedom from disease is guaranteed, and the
consumer is satisfied. All animals shipped from the United States are
examined at the centre of exportation and a tag fastened i:i the ear.
A complete record is kept so that a beast can be traced. The most
careful examination possible of hogs is made. Samples of every hog
destined for inter-State commerce or export is taken and microscopically
examined.


Sooner or later the Home authorities will stipulate that all exported
meat shall he thoroughly inspected, and certified as sound, at the port
of departure, and the sooner we forestall this development the better
for the trade.
The following are the means by which, it is thought, assistance to the
meat export trade can be rendered by the Government : —Special reduc-
tion of railway freights on live and dead stock for export might be
conceded, with increased facilities for rapid transit; special legislation
should be introduced annulling the power of the Sydney Municipal
Council to claim dues on stock intended for slaughter for export, and the
supervision under the direction of the Board of Health of all meat for
export at place of slaughtering, including a certificate testifying to its
fit condition for human consumption, should be provided, and the
export of any meat without such certificate should be absolutely pro-
hibited. There are several difficulties in the way of this development,
however: first, to obtain men suitable for the work; secondly, to
determine a standard of quality; and, third, where the inspection is
to be made. It would be ruinous to graziers to have to freeze meat
and pay rail freight to Sydney on meat afterwards rejected. It could
then only be boiled down or canned at a heavy loss. The alternative is
to place a Government inspector at each works.
Competition.
Powerful as the chilled beef of the United States is as a competitor
with Australia, controlling as it really does the Home market (for
whenever chilled beef is in heavy supply frozen beef has no chance at
all, while frozen mutton also declines from sympathy), yet our most
formidable competitor, in the future, is Argentina. Her resources
appear to be almost inexhaustible, and her live stock export trade
both in sheep and cattle is assuming enormous dimensions. While we
have the Argentine competition we may once for all dismiss all idea of
any higher average for merino mutton than 3d. a lb. Bather should
the aim be to put it on the Home market at A full and continuous
supply, ensuring low freights and insurance, will enable growers in
time to put down meat at a consolidated rate of alb. from the sea-
board ; and even at the low rate of 2ld. a lb. this would leave the
grower Id. a lb. net for his merino mutton. This, in addition to the
skin and fat, w r ould give sheep-growers what they have been aiming
at, in establishing their own works, namely, a satisfactory minimum
price for their surplus sheep, for Id. a lb. net, in addition to the value
of the skin and fat, means a net 7s. for a 52-lb. sheep with a six
months’ fleece.
Mr. Gibson’s interesting book on the Argentine Bepublic conveys
some valuable information, for we find at the date at which that book
was written that, in spite of the wonderful resources of that great
country, their stock of sheep had decreased from a former maximum
of 96,000,000 to about 80,000,000. As the country is capable, accord-
ing to Mr. Gibson, of carrying* 150,000,000 sheep, we must look for
the cause of this decrease to adverse seasons and disease, and it is,
therefore, just possible that the competition from Argentina may be
thus considerably weakened. Nevertheless, Argentine owners have


an immense advantage in tliat they pay wages, rent, &c., in papei or
silver currency, and are paid for tlieir meat in gold at an enormous
premium. Freight charg’es also only amounts to ird. perlb. as against
fd., tlie rate from New South Wales.
Conclusion.
It was tlie slieep-farmer wlio initiated and found woik foi tlie fiist
freezing’ companies of New Zealand and g’uaranteed them fi eight, audit
was by & tlie interest and guidance of these sheep-farmers that the com-
panies were controlled. AAhat New Zealand has done we can do. If
Australia has disadvantages, she has also advantages ; and if the meat
export trade is economically and wisely managed it must result in great
benefit to the whole Colony. It will not come in a month nor in a year,
but it will come. As has been well said of the American trade, It is
a trade that like every other good thing has had to be fought for and
conquered,” and Australian stockowners need not expect to come out
on top without a tough struggle. Ihe capacity of European popula-
tions for meat-eating has never yet been tested. That is now our
business, and we must not expect it to be all plain sailing. The popu-
lation of the world is every day increasing, and in spite of all that can
and will be done to develop the food-producing powers of land there is
and must be an unlimited market for food. With a revival in trade,
more meat will certainly be consumed. The population of our great
competitor, the United States, is steadily, if slowly, overtaking the
meat supply. That supply is not increasing, but has actually decreased
during the past few years. In any case the States meat production is
not likely to go beyond its former maximum, and an increase in the future
can only come from more expensively fed stock, as by degrees what are
called range, or merely grass-fed cattle, must die out. W ith economy
in production, abundant, and inexpensive cold storage, with lower lates
of freight and insurance, the frozen meat industry of Australia is indeed
capable of great expansion. Fastidious British consumers may turn up
their noses at our frozen meat; but in time the great mass of the
people will find in it a palatable and necessary food, and it is to the
masses we must look for support.
The possibilities of the expansion of our meat export trade with the
United Kingdom are simply enormous. The country must take our
meat. The awful consequences that would result from the cutting oft
of foreign food supplies from the United Kingdom were strongly urged
lately in London, and attention was directed to the enormous amount
of English capital invested in the live and dead meat trade, itven a
few days’ failure in the foreign meat supply of London would be a
national disaster. The Board of Trade returns for September show
that over 2,400 tons of frozen meat is landed in England every month
in addition to 33,000 live cattle and 75,000 live sheep. We have only
made a small start in what will prove to be one of the greatest
industries in which New South Wales has ever engaged. Merino
mutton at a price is becoming distinctly more marketable, not so much
because consumers are changing their taste, as because we are finding
out those consumers to whom that particular meat is acceptable.
Doubtless, too, prejudice is being to some extent removed.


The last census showed that out of 38,000,000 people in England,
25,000,000 were represented by working men and their families. The
scale of living in the old country is rising steadily, and the low price
at which our frozen meat is being sold has introduced it to thousands
who never otherwise would have heard of it. Our present Governor,
Lord Hampden, drew attention lately in an address to the vast field
which existed in the old country for Australian enterprise. “ The old
country,” he said, “is prepared to take Australian produce almost
without limit.” A prominent London firm, in their circular of 1893,
say, “that at moderate prices and with increased supplies reasonably
regulated, there can be little doubt that the outlet will prove co-
extensive with the producing capacities of the colonies.”
There are great possibilities for frozen meat and even greater for
canned in time of war, and as already stated, the European markets
must before long be opened to colonial produce. “ The markets of
the civilised world disclose no growth in food production corresponding
to the growth of population, and perhaps no greater boon has been
accorded to the world of late years than the supply of good meat at
low cost by means of the frozen meat trade.”
We would in conclusion sum up our hopes as to the future of the
meat export trade as follows : —That the supplies in the United King-
dom are decreasing : that the Continental nations from being exporters
have become importers; that if the supply of frozen meat were cut off
from England for one month there would be a meat famine; that the
population of the United States, America, is increasing in greater pro-
portion than the meat supply; that the reduction in the cost of the
production of frozen meat is causing, and will still further cause the
displacement of other food products; and that the prejudices against
frozen meat are fast dying out.
The part of Australian stockowners is plain enough. To produce a
good article —to put it on the markets of the world at as low a price as
possible —to use all legitimate means in the distribution, and to open
up all possible new markets. The world is before us —the whole busi-
ness is in its babyhood —the possibilities of the future development of
this great industry are simply immense. Let us then go to work with
vigour, with hope and with a big heart, determining that no obstacles
shall deter us, and that success must and shall crown our efforts. We
must have a little patience and a good deal of perseverance. We can
produce the best meat in the world in Australia, and at the lowest cost.
We must, therefore, in spite of all difficulty, command the Meat Export
trade of the world. The possibilities and future of this enterprise are as
great as ever, and should inspire the weak-kneed among us with a little
more hope and energy. The Meat Export Trade will yet save the
Pastoral Industry.


Fish Industry.
BY J. DOUGLAS OGILBY.
Owing to tlie numerous bays and estuaries which, everywhere indent
its shores, the Colony of New South Wales is peculiarly adapted to the
successful prosecution of various fishing industries, which should greatly
increase the wealth of the community at large.
In the space to which I am limited it will be impossible to do more
than enumerate the fishes which are likely to prove valuable to us,
those families being specially selected which, from their numbers and
quality, may in the future become available for export.
Apodes. —Several species of Eels are brought to our markets, but
only one, the Long-finned Eel, Anguilla is obtained in suf-
ficient quantities to entitle it to a place among our food fishes. Like
all its congeners it is an excellent table fish, and as it is abundant in
all the rivers and estuaries of our eastern watershed, and from its great
tenacity of life may be depended on to remain fresh through weather
which would quickly taint other fishes, it is always sure to command
a high price.
Malacopterygii. —Among* the Malacopterygians proper only one
group which can in anywise lay claim to economic value occurs; this is
the great congeries of families of which the Herring and the Anchovy
may be taken as representatives.
It has long been known that at certain seasons our seas teem with
Herrings ( Clupeidse ) of various species, three, perhaps four, of which
pass northwards along our coast in almost incredible numbers yearly,
the season of migration being, roughly speaking, the last six months
of the year.
Only tw r o of these are, however, likely to become of commercial
importance, though a more accurate knowledge of the composition of
the mighty shoals which visit our shores may reveal the presence of at
least two other species in remunerative quantities.
Of these four the Pilchard, Clupea sagax, is the most valuable, and
is no doubt destined to become at some future period a source of
considerable wealth to the Colony, perhaps even, when a regular fishery
has been inaugurated and the necessary factories erected and worked
under expert management, to enter into no mean rivalry with its
more famous northern relative. In a fresh state its flesh is of equal
excellence with that of the Atlantic Pilchard, and, given its capture
in sufficient numbers, there is no reason why it should not compete
successfully with the bloater and the sardine of foreign production;
at the least we ought to be able to produce sufficient for home


consumption, and tlms check tlie annual outflow of money now ex-
pended in tlie importation of these luxuries, even if we fail to reverse
tlie process by becoming in our turn exporters.
The only other species which bears any external resemblance to and
is, therefore, likely to be mistaken for the Pilchard is the Maray,
Etrumeus jaclcsoniensis, and it may be easily distinguished by the
character of the ventral profile which is rounded, broad, and smooth to
the finger, whereas in the genus Glupea the same part is compressed,
sharp, and carinated. The Maray is said to pass northwards about the
same season of the year as the Pilchard, and in the same prodigious
shoals, and if this be the case it would, of course, be liable to capture
and utilisation for the same purposes as that fish. In habits also it
appears to be very similar, both species being exceedingly unwilling
to approach the shore too closely, indeed so marked is this aversion
in the Maray that the writer only knows of three examples in the two
Sydney Museums. On their approach to the Queensland coast the
shoals deflect in the direction of the open sea, and to insure the success
of any fishery carried on beyond our borders, the fishing craft would
have to be prepared to venture further afield, and to be provided with
ice or salting chambers for the necessary preservation of the take;
this deflection is doubtless due to the influence of warm currents
setting in a southerly direction from inside the Great Barrier Beef.
Several other species of edible clupeiform fishes are found more or
less numerously in our waters, among which may be mentioned the
Big-eyed Herrings, Elopssaurus and Megalops ,
both of which attain a length of three feet, and the Salmon Herring
or Sabalo, Ghanos salmoneus {Ghanidx), which grows to at least a foot
more; the two latter species, probably also the former, thrive well when
kept in fresh- or brackish-water ponds or tanks. The Bony Bream,
Eorosoma richardsoni ( Dorosomatidx ) of our western rivers is said to
be of good flavor, but so phenomenally full of bones that the flesh is
not worth the trouble of separating from the framework, though it
is said that by soaking them in vinegar prior to cooking this difficulty
may be removed.
Iniomi. —Only one species, the Sergeant Baker, Aulopus pur pur is-
satus, is worthy of inclusion among our food fishes, and as it is only
taken by hook and line, and is of superior quality for the table, the
demand is always in excess of the supply. The Cucumber-fish,
Glilorophthalmus nigripinnis, is abundant at moderate depths outside,
and might be taken plentifully by the trawl net, but is not of sufficient
size to command a market, though they would probably be delicious
if preserved like sardines. One or two species of Lizard-fishes {Sy
are occasionally to be found in the market, but they cannot be con-
sidered further than in the light of stragglers.
Teleocephali. —ln the suborder we find some of our
most valuable food fishes. Among the Halfbeaks (. Hemirhamphidse)
six species have been recorded from our waters, but two only can
at present be considered with propriety as possessing an economic
value; these are the Sea Garfish, Hemirhamphus intermedins, and the
Biver Garfish, H. regularis, the latter of which, though the smaller,
is generally considered the more delicious of the two. Both species




SEA-MULLET.
(Mugil dobula.)


are very common along our shores, and are taken in quantities by
special small-mesked nets. The Sea Garfish, as its name implies,
frequents the outer beaches and those of the more open portions'of our
bays and harbors, while its congener confines itself more strictly to
the tidal waters of our estuaries; the deposition of the ova takes place
during the three last months of the year, but as the parents rapidly
recoup they may be regarded as being’ in good condition all the year
round. lam not aware that any attempt has been made to preserve
these fishes by a similar process to that to which the half grown
Pilchards are subjected in order to convert them into sardines, but I
have no shadow of a doubt that under a like manipulatiomthey would as
far excel that fish in their tinned form as they do in their fresh. Of
course, for preserving in this way the immature Sea Garfish and the
River Garfish would be the more suitable.
Percesoces. —Of the numerous families of fishes which frequent our
shores there are none of such commercial importance as that to which
the Sea Mullet and its allies [MugHidse) belong. At least eight
species of Gray Mullets occur in greater or less abundance within our
limits, all of which are justly esteemed as food, and several of which
conjunctively constitute a large proportion of our fish supply. Some
of these are marine forms which at stated seasons make their way
from the open sea into our bays and estuaries for the purpose of
depositing their spawn; others again inhabit the brackish water of
our estuaries at all seasons of the year; while yet another section,
whether from choice or otherwise, are permanent residents in fresh
water, and successfully propagate their species therein.
In point of size and quality the Sea Mullet, stands out
preeminent among its congeners, attaining to a weight of ten pounds
and upwards, and affording, in one or other of its stages of growth,
a permanent supply of excellent and wholesome food throughout the
year.
During the latter part of the summer and the autumn months enor-
mous shoals of these fishes make their appearance oft the coast, moving
in a general northerly direction; these shoals are composed entirely of
adult individuals on the way to their spawning grounds, and are now
in the most perfect condition, and admirably adapted either for con-
sumption in a fresh state or for preservation; it is to these shoals, while
on their annual migrations, that we must in future .look to supply the
ever increasing demand upon the resources of this our premier food fish.
From these vast masses a larger or smaller portion breaks off at such
intervals of their passage northwards as enables it to arrive each at its
special breeding haunt in time for the autumnal spawning. In our
southern bays and estuaries this important function commences in
March, but the season grows gradually later as we proceed northwards,
until in the Richmond and Clarence district May, and even June, find
the shoals still engaged upon the spawning beds.
As soon as the ova have been deposited upon the extensive mud flats
which fringe the mouths of our rivers, the bulk of the fishes, such at
least as have survived the numerous dangers to which they have been
subjected on their passage to and during their operations on the spawn-
ing beds, make their way individually or in small parties seawards, and
the ova having meanwhile rapidly germinated on the warm shallow flats.


tlie emancipated fry quickly seek tlie skeltered bays and quiet readies
of our rivers, and there, in suck security as may be possible from tkeir
numerous enemies, pass tkis first and perilous period of tkeir sentient
existence. In suck localities tkey remain for some eighteen montks,
during wkick period tkey have- ventured out from tke skallows and
drop up and down witk tke tide, approacking tke skore witk tke rising
flood in searck of food. At tkis age tkey average about twelve indies
in length, and are of marketable size, and tke pick of our Mullets for
consumption in a fresk state. It is at tkis stage of growth that tkey
are known to fishermen and dealers as tke Hard-gut Mullet, and have
received tkeir specific name of dohula. During tke spring and summer
montks skoals of these immature fishes are gradually but continuously
working tkeir way down from tke nurseries to tke sea, where tkey serve
to reinforce tke mighty armies of adults now gathering together for
tkeir annual pilgrimage.
In order to avert tke impending destruction, or at best lamentable
depletion of tkis valuable species, stringent regulations providing for
and insuring its more efficient protection when on or approacking tke
spawning grounds are already requisite, and will soon become abso-
lutely indispensable; and as these breeding places consist of tke
shallow muddy flats outside and just within tke embouchure of our
rivers (for tke gravid females do not, as many suppose, penetrate to
any great distance up tke rivers) it is evident that once the skoals
kave passed inside tke various Heads,” tkey should be jealously
secured from further molestation until after tkis, tke most important
function of tkeir lives, has been safely brought to a conclusion.
In both tke adult and immature stages tkis species, when freshly
caught, is justly held in high estimation for tke table, and commands a
ready sale at reasonable prices wherever offered; owing, however, to
tke lack of suitable establishments for preserving tke captured fishes
on a scale sufficiently large to make tke industry remunerative, many
tons weight are annually suffered to decompose, and thus a bountiful
supply of cheap and wholesome food is wasted; and tkis waste, great
as it frequently is, forms but an inconsiderable trifle in comparison
with tke myriads of unimpregnated ova wkick are totally lost through
the ceaseless and short-sighted persecution to wkick tke breeding fishes
are subjected from tke moment of tkeir first appearance on tke spawn-
ing beds until tke last wearied and weakened survivor shall kave suc-
cessfully run the gauntlet of these countless dangers, and escaped for
a season to tke safer skelter of tke ocean depths.
When to this appalling destruction of ova is superadded that of tke
young fry, wkick the continual sweeping of tke foreshores of our
harbors and estuaries by small-meshed nets necessitates, it is abun-
dantly evident that no kind of fish, wkick is by its nature compelled to
deposit its spawn within tke shallow w T aters of the littoral zone can
successfully cope for any length of time witk tke ravages caused by so
great, so inexcusable, and so easily avoidable a drain upon its re-
sources, so blindly ignorant and wilful a contravention of all natural
laws.
In addition to tke Sea Mullet, at least seven other members of tke
family are known to occur, more or less abundantly, within our limits;
by far the most important of these, whether in regard to its numbers,


its size, or the delicacy of its flesh, is the Flat-tailed Mullet, Mugil
peroni, which, thougdi never attaining to the same dimensions, nor, in
general estimation, to an equal standard of excellence as its more
favored relative, is, nevertheless, a good fish for the table, and as well
adapted for smoking as is that species.
The spawning season corresponds in the main with that of the Sea
Mullet, but apparently extends over a longer period, specimens with fully
developed ova being obtainable in the Sydney markets at any time
between December and June. They chiefly frequent shallow sandy
and sheltered bays, and have not been proved to migrate along the coast
to the same degree as do their larger congeners, though a partial move-
ment from one inlet to another, induced doubtless by the restlessness
consequent upon the approach of the spawning season, is said to be
perceptible.
Acanthopterygii. —Among the Acanthopterygians proper, the first
family to claim attention is the Berycidse , to which the FTannygai,
Beryx affinis , one of our most delicious edible fishes, belongs. They
are only caught by hook in moderately deep water, and, being in great
demand, the small supply which finds its way to the markets is eagerly
purchased at high rates. It is one of the most beautiful of all our
fishes, attains to a length of twenty inches, and is said to be a great
delicacy when slightly corned and smoked.
Several kinds of scombroid fishes frequent our coast, the most
important of which is the Southern Mackerel, Scomber ,
That enormous shoals of these fishes visit our shores we cannot but
believe on the evidence adduced, but the intervals between these
appearances are so irregular, that the idea of a remunerative fishery
dependent on the Mackerel alone is not for a moment to be entertained.
The paucity or abundance of the supply of food is probably responsible
in great measure for this irregularity of behaviour, so far at least as
their presence in our bays and inlets is concerned, but it does not in
such a degree alfect the great shoals, which, by general consensus of
opinion, are believed to pass northwards in the offing at or about mid-
summer, as with these shoals, being fully engrossed in the business of
spawning or of reaching their accustomed spawning grounds, food is
a secondary consideration. As is the case with the Pilchard and other
ocean surface fishes, the Mackerel shed their spawn in the open sea en
masse j owing to the contained oil globule, the ova are lighter than
the sperm of the male fish, and, as when engaged in spawning the
females swim at a slightly deeper level than the males, each extruded
ovum as it rises gradually to the surface is obliged to pass through the
slowly sinking masses of spermatozoa, and thus becomes impregnated
and fruitful; the ova floating on the surface quickly germinate, and
the liberated fry are wafted from place to place under the influence of
the tides, currents, and winds, until, the yelk-bag being exhausted, the
young fish enters untrammeled upon the primal phase of its free exist-
ence. Either fresh or pickled Mackerel are delicious eating, but they
decompose with such rapidity that great care has to be exercised in
selecting individuals for use at the table.
Among the Scads ( Garangidse ) we find several species which, from
their numerical abundance and their excellent food qualities, play no
inconsiderable part in the fish resources of the Colony.


The Trevally, or more correctly Orevalle, is
another abundant fish along our entire sea-board from north to
south, and forms a conspicuous feature in our fish supply; the young
and half-grown are much more numerous than the adults, and are very
generally present in our markets, while the latter prefer to keep off at
some distance from the land, though not in so marked a manner as the
adult Yellowtail, TracJmrus s aunts, does.
The Kingfish, Seriola lalandii, and its congener the Samson-fish,
S. hippos, also belong to this family; the former is by far the more
plentiful and is found along the entire length of our coast all
seasons; they school at the surface during the autumn when they
shed their spawn, but it is a noteworthy fact that, unfixe the two
preceding fishes, the young do not appear inshore at a very early age,
in fact not until they are of the marketable size of quite a root in
length. It is a bold predacious fish, and does considerable damage
to the inshore fisheries, such as those which are carried on for the
different kinds of Mullets, Whiting, &c., by harassing the parents
when on the spawning beds, as well as by the consumption oi the
fry, which is illimitable on account of its insatiable voracity. The
Kingfish attains to a weight of sixty pounds, and when even a small
shoal is enclosed within a net it frequently proves no unmixed blessing
to the owners, for their determined efforts to escape often prove
triumphant, the rush of so many large fishes, acting in conceit, being
irresistible. Smoked or salted, the Kingfish, when taken in sufficient
quantities, would doubtless form a desirable article of export.
Closely allied to the Garangidss is the family Pomatomidse, of which
the Tailor, Pomatomus saltatrix, is the sole representative. The spawn
is shed in the open sea but within tidal influence, and the young fishes
soon find their way to the shelter of the harbors and estuaiies, wheie
they rapidly increase in size, and whence they are sent to market in
large numbers for sale as bait in company with Yellowtails, &c. The
half-grown and adult fishes form a conspicuous feature in our markets,
and are bought up with avidity, being indeed one of our most delicious
food fishes, though care must be observed in selecting individuals for
the table, as the flesh deteriorates very rapidly; they take smoke
excellently, and no doubt, when our factories shall have become un
fait accompli, will be turned to profitable account in that way, while
there is no reason to doubt that, carefully prepared in tins, they would
readily commend themselves to purchasers, and form no mean rival to
the imported Salmon for home consumption.
In the great family of the Basses several species claim
our attention, either because of the excellence of their flesh or because
the capture of them may at some future time attain to such dimensions
as to necessitate their taking rank among those of economic import-
ance.
First in the list may be placed the Australian Perch, Percolates
colonorum, a common fish of our cismontane rivers mid estuaries,
which is often well represented in our markets, where it commands a
ready sale, being held in some estimation as a food fish. The lange
of the species is rather limited and may be roughly given as the
coastal rivers of south-eastern Australia, from the estuary of the Rich-
mond to that of the Murray River, and northern Tasmania. V\ ithm




THE SCHNAPPER.
(Sparosomus auratus.)


these limits, however, it is plentiful in suitable localities, such as the
Gippsland Lakes, and might well repay a little care in its culture and
preservation, especially as it lives and thrives in land-locked ponds, is
very hardy, grows to a weight of three pounds and upwards, and gives
good sport to anglers.
In the Murray Cod, Oligorus macquariensis, our western rivers can
boast of a fish -far beyond the Perch in intrinsic value, a fish too
which, in the quality of its flesh and the great size to which it grows,
is the compeer of any known purely fresh-water species.
To the species above mentioned must be added several marine
Serrauids which occur more or less numerously on our coast. The
best known and most esteemed of these is the Black Rock-Cod,
Epinephelus dsemeli, a fine fish which grows to upwards of a hun-
dred pounds in weight and is in great request for the table, but has
from some cause or other become very scarce in the metropolitan
district, and is now rarely seen in our markets and then of small size,
even though it always commands a high price. On other parts of
the coast, however, such as the Seal Rocks and the Solitaries, and
at Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth Reef, they may be taken of the
largest size and in almost any quantities, and if regularly sought
for —which would be the case if there were an assured market —
would probably develop into a valuable article of commerce whether
salted, smoked, or tinned. An allied species, the Giant Cod, Epinephelus
itaiara , is taken not unfrequently in the estuaries of our northern
rivers, and attains to at least three times the weight of its congener.
Another well known species is the Wirrah, Acanthistius serratus, which
is much more common, but does not nearly grow to the size of the
Black Rock-Cod, nor is its flesh so much esteemed.
The small family Arripididce is represented on our coast by the so-
called Salmon, Arripis trutta , and as this species is exceedingly
abundant, and schools at the surface at stated periods, it might bo
taken in enormous numbers during its migrations, in the same way
and by the same nets as the Mullet, as well as by the seine on the
ocean beaches, and such as are not consumed locally could be utilised
to form an inferior brand of salt fish.
One of the most important families which frequent our seas is that of
the Sea Breams {Sparidse) , to which belong some of our most common
and valued edible fishes, such as the Schnapper,
the Black Bream, Chrysophrys australis, and the Tarwhine, C. datnia.
So much has been written about the Schnapper and Schnapper-fishing
that it seems supererogatory to increase the literature of the subject
here. In this Colony the supply of Schnappers is almost entirely due
to the line fishermen, who seek them on well known reefs at moderate
depths, and off rocky points and bomboras. During the early summer
months these fishes school, the shoals consisting of adults intent on
breeding ; but as to where, or under what circumstances, this important
operation is carried out, or in what localities the ova are deposited,
we are still in the dark. They cure well, and are said to be ecpial to
the finest Cod, and much superior to Ling for that purpose.
The Black Bream is everywhere abundant in our seas, and makes
its way up our rivers even beyond the limits of the tide; its favorite
haunts are, however, sheltered bays and estuaries, where it is taken in


large numbers, both by net and book, affording with the latter good
sport to the amateur fisherman. The Tarwhine is more distinctly a
northern fish than its congener, differs but little from it in its habits
and might be utilised in the same way.
To the Kyphosidas belong several edible species, such as the Sweep
Lsesiosoma seqmpmnis, the Drummer, Pimelepterus sydneyanus, the
Dlackfish, Girella tncuspidata, the Ludrick, simplex, and the Blue-
fish, G. cyanea. The Blackfish is abundant in the metropolitan
markets at all seasons, and when perfectly fresh is a good pan fish, as it
is also when smoked. The Sweep, Drummer, and Ludrick occur in
moderate numbers during the year, but the Bluefish is scarce with us :
is is mainly to be accounted for by its preference for the open sea •
thus we find it very abundant at Lord Howe Island, where neither of
the other species is found, and where it is a staple article of food amono-
ivr m T lla f lt ?' either salted, smoked, or fresh; from thence and from
Llizabeth Reef it could be brought in any quantity required and
transhipped to other countries.
. j- sma H hut well flavored fish, which inhabits our inlets and swims
m large shoals, is the Silver-belly, Xystsema ovatum (Gerridse ). It
grows to a length of about eight inches, and would no doubt be
delicious preserved like sardines.
Among the Gropers and Parrot-fishes [Labridse) we find several
species, which have a great reputation for the table, and are always
readily saleable, but they are neyer caught in such quantities as to be
ot economic importance; among them may be mentioned the Blue-
spotted Groper, Choerops ommopterus, a fine firm-fleshed fish, attaining
to a length of two feet and upwards, and common in our northern
districts; the Blue and Red Gropers, Achoerodus gouldi and hadius,
the former of which is abundant in all suitable localities, and is highly
esteemed, the head and shoulders being considered an especial delicacy •
and the Pigfishes, Lepidaplois oxycephalus and hellis. ’
A very important family in our seas is that of the Sciwnidse, though
but two marketable fishes belong to it; these are the Jewfish, Scisena
hololepidota, and the Teraglin, Atractoatelodus. The former is
very common along the coast of Hew South Wales, from north to
south. The Jewfish grows to the length of five feet, but for the table
the half-grown examples of two feet and under are preferable ; at this
stage they are sold as “ Silver Jews," and roam along the coast in laro- e
shoals, entering the various harbors and inlets, and thus coming within
the scope of the seine fishermen to whom they prove a valuable harvest,
as they are always readily saleable at fair prices.
I he Teiaglin is a much better fish for the table than even the Silver
cw, but is not obtainable at all seasons as is its relative, nor does it
grow to so large a size. The air vessels of all the members of this
family aie of \ory large size, and as the best quality of isinglass is
manufactured from them it would be necessary when our factories
shall have been established, to devote some time and space to the
collection and preparation of this product. P
The Cottidm hold a place in our list by virture of the Flatheads
(Platycephalus ), five species of which occur in the Sydney markets.
By far the most abundant of these is the Common Flathead, P.fuscus ,
which may fairly be reckoned among our best food fishes. * 3


To many persons, the writer among the number, the Whitings will
commend themselves as being, perhaps with the sole exception of the
HemirJiamphidse, or Halfbeaks, at once the most delicate and the most
deliciously flavored of all Australian fishes. Two species minister to
the wants of our tables, the larger of which attains to a length of twenty
inches, is a clean, handsome fish, and is taken in numbers both on the
outer and inner sandy beaches, either by net or by hook. This species is
the Sand Whiting, Sillago ciliata , but though its congener, the Trum-
peter Whiting, S. maculata, does not reach to such dimensions, it is
held by many to be the more delicately flavored fish of the two. It is
as a rule more partial to the flats and reaches of our estuaries than the
more exposed beaches which its congener prefers. Both species deposit
their spawm in holes formed in the sand, and both old and young bury
themselves in the sand or mud when threatened by any danger.
A very interesting family [Gadopsidse) , which only contains a single
species, Gadopsis marmoratus, is an inhabitant of our southern rivers.
This family has been generally included among the Anacanthines, but
its affinities apparently approach more closely to the blennioid type;
it is a common fish in many of the rivers of our south-eastern watershed,
and is said to be excellent eating; it takes a bait freely.
Heterosomata. —The Flounders [P furnish us with two
or, at most, three species worthy of mention as an addition to our food
supply. These are the Large-toothed and Small-toothed Flounders,
Paralichthys arsius and multimaculatus , both of which are fairly
common, and the Long-nosed Flounder, Ammotretis rostratus, which is
scarcer, but is a thicker and even better flavored fish than either of
the others.
Only two species of Soles ( Soleidas ) can be classed among our
marketable fishes, namely —the Harrow-banded Sole, Aserragodes mac-
leayanus, and the Black Sole, Synaptura nigra , the latter being the
most abundant of our flat-fishes.
Plectogxathi. —The Trigger-fishes, Balistidte, are well represented
in our seas by numerous species of Leather-jackets, several of which
grow to an edible size, and must be classed among the most delicate of
our fishes, care being taken to skin them before cooking.
I cannot conclude these observations without once again pointing
out that a remunerative trade might, with little initiatory expense, be
developed with China in shark fins, and that the oil extracted from
the livers of the Plagiostomes contains valuable medicinal properties

Mining Industry.
BY W. H. J. SLEE, Esq., F.G.S., Chief Inspector of Mines, &c.
The gold-fields of New South. TV ales are very numerous and extensive,
stretching from Mount Browne, the extreme north-westerly part of the
Colony, on to the river Murray, a distance of nearly 700 miles, and the
extent of the auriferous area at present known covers fully 80,000 miles.
The Mount Browne Gold-field was first discovered in October, 1880,
in an arid country, .the average annual rainfall being about 8 inches.
The district is known as Sturt's Stony Desert, and here, owing to a
severe drought, the explorer, Sturt, was obliged to camp for some
months in 1845 on a water-hole now known as Depot Glen. Here,
too, the second in command named John Poole died; the exploring
party underwent great hardships and privations; John Poole's grave
ias since been discovered and fenced in, and is now a historical spot
in New South Wales. Within 200 yards of Depot Glen, the first
payable gold on the Mount Browne Gold-field was discovered just
thirty-five years after Sturt and his party departed from Depot Glen.
The geological formation in which the gold occurs is Silurian slates
and granite, and the highest elevation —that is, Mount Browne and
Mount Poole —is about 300 feet above the surrounding cretaceous
plains; forming, as it were, an island surrounded by the former
cretaceous sea; the extent of the auriferous area is about 40 miles in
a north-easterly by south-westerly direction, and from 1 to 5 miles in
width. The gold generally is coarse and water-worn; nuggets up to
30 oz. in weight have been obtained; the gold is of the highest quality,
the local price being £4 per oz. Generally the gold is found on the surface
or in shallow sinking, but lately ground from 150 feet to 200 feet has
been worked with payable results. The quartz reefs, which vary in
thickness from a mere thread to several feet, have in several instances
proved payable, and new payable discoveries have only very recently
been made. A 10-stamp battery for quartz-crushing and gold-saving
purposes is on the field. There are also a large number of puddling
machines erected all over the field, which are, however, frequently idle
for want of water. Milparinka and Tibooburra are the principal
towns, and are now connected by telegraph.
Cobar, about 300 miles from Mount Browne, also in our north-western
district, was opened about twenty-five years ago for copper-mining,
and thousands of miners were employed. Notwithstanding this, rich
and extensive gold discoveries were only made within the last five years,
and that within only 3 miles of the copper-mine referred to, proving
beyond doubt new gold discoveries may be made throughout the Colony


BROKEN HILL SILVER-MINES.




hi close proximity to our older mining districts. Highly payable
crusliings have lately taken place from the Cobar gold-mines, such as
the Occidental, Albion, Young Australian, Chesney, and others.
Hold was also discovered about 20 miles westerly of Cobar on places
known as theßillygoe and Mount Drysdale, which only recently turned
out some enormously rich yields. There are now five different crushing
and gold-saving plants, consisting of stampers and Huntingdon mills
within 3 miles of Cobar. Huntingdon mills have also been erected in
the Mount Drysdale district.
Peak Hill, a gold-field situated about 42 miles from Dubbo, and about
30 miles from Parkes, was discovered in 1890. There are to be found both
quartz and alluvial deposits, some of which turned out very rich. In
May, 1881, a shaft was bottomed in dry alluvial at a depth of 130 feet;
the size of shaft being only 5 feet long by 2 feet wide, thickness of wash
3 feet from which 71 oz. of gold were picked by hand as the auriferous
wash was brought to the surface. In consequence of this a large
rush set in, and within a fortnight the population increased from 1,600
to 12,000. But as only a few claims obtained payable gold, the popu-
lation decreased, and is now about 1,500 to 2,000. Some rich dis-
coveries have only very lately been made in the district.
The Parkes district has for many years supported a large mining
population. The gold deposits consist of alluvial and quartz. The
alluvial has been very extensive, shallow and dry, and the quartz reefs
have proved to be permanent and rich. Some of these quartz mines
have yielded, and are now yielding, thousands of pounds sterling to
the fortunate shareholders. There are several quartz crushing plants
with the latest improved gold-saving appliances on the field. About
50 miles west of Parkes are the recently discovered Burra, Fifield,
and Platina gold workings.
At Forbes, about 22 miles from Parkes, where enormously rich
alluvial gold deposits have been worked in shallow as well as deep and
wet leads for the last thirty-five years, mining has lately received a
fresh impetus through the discovery of rich quartz veins in the vicinity
of Grassett’s Lead.
In the Wellington district, at a place known as Mitchell’s Creek
(Daviesville), quartz reefs which had been abandoned years ago were
reopened with satisfactory results. These reefs prove at a depth of 000
feet to be well defined ; average about 20 inches in thickness, and have
yielded during the year 15 dwts. 14 grs. of gold per ton; no free gold
can be seen in the quartz, the latter being heavily charged with pyrites.
The machinery consists of a 15-stamp crushing battery; the crushed
stuff runs over copper plates and mercury wells, then through wooden
shoots about 400 feet in length on to the Manners, after which the
concentrates are treated by the process of chlorination.
The Mudgee district is also very extensive, both for alluvial and
quartz; of the latter Hargraves and Clarke’s Creek are the principal.
Some satisfactory returns are still obtained from capital and labour. In
the alluvial, such as Gulgong, Happy Yalley, and other localities, very
large auriferous deposits have been worked, and out of small claims 120
ft. x 120 ft. over £30,000 worth of gold has been won. The Gulgong
Gold-field was discovered twenty-eight years ago, and it still contributes


largely to tlie production of gold. New and ricli discoveries of alluvial
gold have recently been made in said district near a place known as
Cobbora. The auriferous area in the district is very extensive, and
has only been partially prospected. In the Bathurst and Hill End
district, gold-mining operations are still carried on with various success.
Some very rich finds were made at Hawkins’ Hill, Hill End, of which
some may be mentioned, namely, the proprietors of Krohmann’s claim
crushed 4361 tons quartz, yielding 24,079 oz. 8 dwt. gold, valued at
£93,616 1 Is. 9d., and Beyers and Holtermanncrushed 415 tons of quartz,
yielding 16,279 oz. 6 dwt. 3 grs. of gold, valued at £63,234 12s. From
the Monte Cristo Mine, several crushings w r ere taken out of a quartz
vein, yielding 200 oz. of gold per ton. Eecently new shoots of gold
have again been discovered.
The Blayney, Carcoar, and Cowra districts also largely contribute
to the yearly yield of gold. At Brown’s Creek, near Blayney, a 60-
stamp battery, with all recent improved gold-saving appliances, is now
in course of erection to w r ork the large deposit of the old Brown’s
Creek Mine.
A great deal of gold is still obtainable in the Orange district, the
Lucknow Mines alone contributed last year 36,208 oz. of gold, valued
at £128,197 sterling. The quartz in the Lucknow Mine is heavily
charged with pyrites, and although there is large crushing power, and
improved gold-saving appliances on the field, only the free gold is
dealt with on the spot, and the concentrates are forwarded to Europe
for the extraction of gold. New gold discoveries have also very
recently been made at Gilgunnia, about 30 miles from Nymagee, and the
same distance from Mount Hope. So far, only quartz veins have been
discovered. These occur in an altered sandstone and slate formation,
and vary in thickness from a few inches to several feet. Several crush-
ing from 5 to 20 tons were treated at the Clyde Works, near Sydney,
with highly payable results. Crushing and gold-saving machinery is
now in course of erection ; but, being in a very arid part of the Colony,
water is scarce. Here, like Mount Allen, the gold is associated with
iron. This district, only a few weeks ago, was a mere sheep-walk;
it is now a settlement of about suo persons, which number is likely to
increase and remain for years to come.
The Mount Allen district has also largely contributed to our yearly
yield of gold. The gold is greatly associated with an iron deposit. This
part of the Far West has not as yet been thoroughly prospected, and
new gold discoveries may be looked forward to in different parts of
the district.
The Kiandra Gold-field, situated in the Australian Alps, has yielded
very large returns of gold, both in alluvial and quartz, b.ut specially in
alluvial. The gold is generally found in the creeks and river flats, and
ground sluicing is mostly the mode by which the gold is extracted
from the auriferous drifts. Here, too, a trial was made with extensive
hydraulic sluicing, but owing to the great thickness of non-auriferous
strata, from 80 to 120 feet, which had to be sluiced away before the 2 to 3
feet auriferous wash was reached, and the inability to obtain sufficient
fall in the tail race, the enterprise had to be abandoned and the old
system of driving and timbering reintroduced. Nevertheless there is
a very large amount of sluicing carried on throughout the Australian

Alps by small parties of miners who have constructed dams and races,
and are generally able to sluice at least nine months out of the twelve
months.
New discoveries of gold-bearing quartz reefs have recently been
made in the mountains of the Upper Murray in the Albury district in a
locality known as Bulgandra, several samples from 5 to 50 tons have
been crushed with highly payable results.
Gold was also discovered by boring on the river Murray Flats, near
Corowa, and payable prospects were obtained at a depth of 320 feet. It
is now considered a certainty that those deep rich alluvial leads which
are so successfully worked in the Rutherglen district in the Colony of
Victoria will be traced across the river Murray into New South Wales,
and for this object a local company has already started operations at
Corowa in the vicinity of the bores referred to.
Numbers of persons are earning a living in the Monaro country
working in quartz reefs, or for alluvial in the creeks and gullies in
the Cooma district.
In Adelong great improvements have lately taken place in the yield
of gold. The Adelong quartz reefs proved very rich; but blanks
occurred in the quartz, the consequence of which was that some of the
best mines were abandoned. They have, however, been retaken after
lying idle for some years, and after sinking through the barren quartz
only a few fathoms, the gold again appeared in highly payable quan-
tities. For instance, the Gibraltar Mine, within miles of Adelong,
had been lying idle for years, it was retaken, sunk through the barren
quartz, and since then several hundreds of tons of quartz have been
crushed, yielding about 5 oz. of gold per ton. The reef averages about
18 inches in thickness, and is impregnated with pyrites rich in gold.
Some years ago, the Great Victoria Company, of Adelong, received
the Government reward of £l,OOO for having been the first quartz
mine in New South Wales which obtained payable gold below the depth
of 1.000 feet.
y
There are at present two crushing machines on the Adelong Gold-
field. One known as the Perseverance consist of a 45-h.p. engine with
a 20-stamp battery of five stamps in each box. After the crushed stuff
discharges through fine gratings, it runs over two sets of copperplates
and wells charged with mercury into Chilian mills, of which there is one
to each five stamps; from the mills it passes into Denny’s pulverisers,
of which there is also one to each five stamps ; from here on to the usual
blanketing tables into a patent buddle to concentrate the pyrites, the
residue passing afterwards into a Renfray’s separator for further treat-
ment, and after this into a reverberatory furnace, thus reducing the
loss of gold and mercury to a low minimum. Further improvements
are intended to be made by adding the most recently improved gold-
saving appliances obtainable.
The other crushing plant is driven by water power, and is known as
the Reefer’s Machine. There are two water-wheels, one overshot, the
other undershot, giving a double power from the one water race; a
15-stamp battery, and all the modern gold-saving appliances. For a
public battery, that is a battery only crushing for the public, it is pro-
bably the best and most complete of the kind in New South Wales.


The Adelong quartz reefs are heavily charged with pyrites, mis-
picket, galena, zinc blende, and copper; hence more attention has been
given to the saving of gold than has been done in districts where free
gold in quartz veins predominates.
In the G-nndagai district large quantities of gold have been obtained
both in quartz and alluvial, and only recently very rich discoveries
have been made. Prospecting is very extensively carried on. There
are several crushing plants in the district; the deepest quartz mine is
only 300 feet in depth.
1 emora, in the Bland district, where gold was first discovered in
1880, is again coming to the front. Some very rich reefs have been
■discovered lately at a place known as Scrubyards, where one party has
just finished crushing 286 tons of quartz, yielding 1,788 oz. 12 dwts. of
gold, or about 6 oz. 5 dwts. of gold per ton, with a quartz vein from 3
to 12 inches in thickness, the country rock being soft. This reef has
now reached the depth of 100 feet, and has so far been traced over
400 feet along the surface. There is an extensive tract of auriferous
country between Scrubyards, Temora, Reefton, Barmedman, Wyalong,
and Yalgogrin, which is well worthy of r, thorough prospecting.
Reefton, Barmedman, and Wyalong ai.y so far, essentially quartz-
reefing districts, no payable auriferous alluvial discoveries have been
made. But there is no reason why auriferous alluvial discoveries should
not be made in those localities. Only very recently several new gold
discoveries have been added to our already known mineral wealth.
Foremost are those at Wyalong in the Bland district. The first dis-
covery of the Wyalong Gold-field was made in October, 1893, when the
locality was a wilderness and mere sheepwalk. In March, 1894, the
first actual rush set in, and in a few weeks the population reached about
10,000. But the present number is about 3,000, and the latter number
is likely to be settled on the field for some years to come. Yearly
20,000 tons of quartz have been crushed from this field, yielding, with
the gold from the concentrates, about 29,500 oz. of gold. The gold is
valued at nearly £4 per oz.
Wyalong is a poor man’s gold-field ; the reefs occur in decomposed
hornblendic granite and diorite; can be easily worked without explo-
sives, and have been tested to about 200 feet, or water level. The yield
of gold has varied from a few pennyweights to 10 oz. per ton. Up to
date no gold leases have been granted on the Wyalong Gold-field. This
course has been adopted by the Hon. Sydney Smith, M.P., Minister
for Mines and Agriculture, for the purpose of preventing monopoly,
and encouraging a systematic and thorough prospecting of the field.
When an application for lease has been made for any particular area,
no other person can interfere with same, and no labour need be
employed until the lease is granted, and then fewer persons are
required to comply with the labour conditions than would be if the
same area were held as a quartz claim by virtue of the miner’s right.
Hence it will be seen that the course adopted by the Hon. Sydney
Smith, M.P., Minister for Mines and Agriculture, was a far-seeing,
prudent, and wise one, whereby great encouragement has been given
to the individual miner to follow his avocation of prospecting unmo-
lested, and without fear of trespassing on some area held under appli-
cation for lease.


All claims at Wyalong arelield by virtue of tbe miner’s right, which
costs 10s. per annum, and entitles the holder to occupy and work 60 feet
along the line of any quartz vein or reef by 400 feet in width, eight
such chaims may be conjointly held, that is, 480 feet along the line of
reef by 400 feet in width. As a rule, four, six, and eight men’s claims
are the areas worked.
There are forfeiture clauses in the Mining Regulations, by which a
miner’s right holder can apply to the Local Warden to be put into
possession of any share, interest, or claim, which has not been efficiently
represented and worked for a period of three consecutive days, and
which the Warden, after taking evidence on oath, declares abandoned
and hands over to the applicant. This cannot be done under the
leasing system, as the Hon. the Minister for Mines and Agriculture has
alone the power to cancel a lease on account of the nonfulfilment of
the labour conditions. This is the reason that the leasing system is in
favour with capitalists, as they consider the title of a gold lease is
better than if the same area were held under miner’s right only. The
real fact is that a claim, or mining area, held by virtue of a miner’s
right, must be efficiently worked, or it becomes liable to forfeiture,
whereas leaseholders have many safeguards, even if they do not comply
with the labour conditions of their lease.
In addition to the claim allowed by virtue of the miner’s right, a
miner’s right holder is also entitled to occupy one quarter of an acre of
land for residence purposes.
Ho gold leases are granted in alluvial, unless in old or wet ground,
which requires large capital, and is beyond the means of the individual
working miner.
The area allowed in alluvial, that is, in dry and shallow ground, is
100 feet by 100 feet for one man, and 300 feet by 300 feet for six men,
the largest area allowed for one claim.
The Wyalong quartz veins are not large, they vary from a mere
thread to about 18 inches, and the g’old is associated with g*alena and
zinc blende, hence they may be classed as refractory ores which require
a special treatment. Where the concentrates have been saved they have
yielded as high as 4 oz, of gold per ton; and it is roughly estimated
that during 1895 fully 3,000 oz. of gold have been extracted from said
concentrates, which have mostly been collected by the primitive mode
of blanketings. Hitherto these concentrates have been forwarded to the
Clyde works, near Granville, and some to Victoria and South Australia
for treatment; there are now, however, in course of erection and just
completed, improved gold-saving appliances, including chlorination
works, which will in future do away with the forwarding of concen-
trates to other parts for treatment.
ihe Lambing* Flat, or Young Gold-field, once so famous for its
shallow alluvial gold deposits, is still producing gold in sufficient
quantities to a number of miners. Grenfell is famous for extensive
quartz and alluvial auriferous deposits. This gold-field was discovered
in 1866, and at one time yielded as much as 8,000 oz. of gold per
week. It has supported a large number of miners ever since its first
discovery. The Grenfell quartz reefs are generally of a great width;
in one instance as much as 15 feet, yielding oz. of gold per ton,
whereas quartz reefs in the same district yielded as much as 7 oz. of


gold per ton, with reefs from 3 to 6 feet in width. In only one
instance the workings have been carried down to the depth of 720
feet. But the remainder of the reefs, of which there is a large number,
have not been worked below the depth of 400 feet. Lately an impetus
has been given owing to the payable yields from the Young O’Brien’s,
the Homeward Bound, the Enterprise, and other reefs. Extensive
prospecting operations are also carried on all over the field, on which
there are two quartz-crushing batteries ; but the gold-saving appliances
are rather primitive.
The Hillgrove Gold-field in the Armidale district may be considered
as being at present the greatest gold-producing field in the northern
districts, employing the largest number of men and most extensive
machinery both for crushing and gold-saving purposes. At the Eleanora
Company a 30-stamp battery has been erected, and as antimony is
associated with the auriferous quartz, furnaces and other machinery
have been erected for special treatment. The yield of the gold from
some of the Hillgrove mines has been extraordinary. The Baker’s
Creek Mine is on payable gold 772 feet below the surface, or 600 feet
below the creek. This mine has a 40-stamp battery in full work with
all the most improved gold-saving appliances. Over £210,000 has
been paid in dividends out of this mine. There are a large number of
mines in the district, all more or less payable, and indications are not
wanting to prove that these quartz reefs may be profitably worked at
a very great depth.
The auriferous area extends in all directions around Armidale.
At Nundle and Hanging Rock quartz-mining has been successfully
carried on, and sluicing on a large scale has been carried on for some
considerable time.
Mining operations, both quartz and alluvial, are also in full swing in
the districts of Uralla, Walcha, Swamp Oak, Niangala, Tamworth, and
Bendemeer. At Barraba rich gold discoveries have very recently been
made in calcite veins, and at Stewart’s Brook and Bingara the gold-
mining industry is making satisfactory progress. The same may be
said of Tenterfield, Grafton, Yana Creek, and Halmorton.
The beach-mining industry in the Ballina and Maclean districts have
lately largely contributed to the annual yield of gold.
In the Fairfield or Drake district there is a large area of auriferous
country still unprospected, and a number of persons are obtaining a
living by working in the numerous creeks and gullies for alluvial gold.
Some of the quartz reefs are yielding highly payable returns.
Silver.
Notwithstanding the low price of silver, there are still several mines
in the Colony paying highly satisfactory dividends to the shareholders.
The most extensivO and important (silver) argentiferous deposits
are being mined upon in the Barrier or Broken Hill district, near the
borders of South Australia. Here the ore deposits are very rich. They
contain all the different species of silver ore, some of the chlorides or
horn silver have been of very high quality, and it is generally admitted
by mining experts that the deposits in the Proprietary Mine, Broken
Hill, cannot be surpassed in quantity or quality by any of the present
known argentiferous deposits in the world.

In addition to silver, tlio oro deposits also contain a fair percentage

The following total yields, taken from the last report of the Proprie-
tary Mine, Bioken Hill, from 30th November, 1886 (the commencement
of the Company’s operations), up to the 28th November, 1895, being
nine years, speak for themselves : —• 3
The profit of the company for the half-year ending 31st May, 1895
amounted to £344,760 7s. Bd. This is certainly the principal company
in the Colony in connection with the silver-mining industry. There
are other large mines at Broken Hill, such as Block 10, the Central
the South Broken Hill, Block 14, British Blocks, the Junction, and
North Junction, and others, which are all producing’ silver in payable
quantities. About 0,000 miners are employed on these mines. Payable
argentiferous deposits have also been discovered in different parts of
New South Wales, some of which are now in actual work. Boorook
in the Tenterfield district; at Emmaville and Inverell, Glen Lines
distinct; also in the Scone and Armidale district; at Sunny Corner,
and other parts of the Bathurst district; Lewis Ponds and other parts
in the Orange district; also near Binalong, Grenfell, and other places.
In fact, the argentiferous area in the Colony is very extensive. The
gieatest question of the day in connection with our silver-mining
industry is the successful treatment of our sulphide ores. If once
this pioblem can be satisfactorily solved then a larg’e increase in the
production of silver may be looked forward to. Larg’e and costly
experiments have been made to solve this vexed question, and little
by little one difficulty after another is overcome, and silver ores which
only two or three years ago were considered as too refractory can now
be treated with a profit. Strong companies are now starting with
the sole object of buying and treating sulphide ores. The value of
machmeiy in connection with the Barrier Silver-mines alone is esti-
mated over £1,000,000, and this machinery is still beiim- added to
from time to time.
Copper.
Theie is a large area of cupriferous formation in different parts of
New South Wales, covering an area of about 4,500,000 acres. The
laigest and most important lodes or deposits so far discovered are in
the and part of the far west. Of these lodes Cobar has the most
important. The Cobar lode varies from 6to 100 feet in width; the
ore being of a very high percentage. The greatest depth so far
obtained is about 600 feet. Even at the present low price of copper
the Cobar mine is dividend-paying. All the different classes of copper
ores have been met with in working this mine during the last twenty-
five years. But up to date the sulphides form the principal deposits,


all tlie richer and easier smelting ores are nearly worked out. The
same may he said of the Nymagee and the Mount Hope mines situated
in the same tract of country as Cobar.
Copper lodes and deposits have also been worked, and some of them
are still working with profitable results (one formerly known as
Thompson’s Creek, now Burraga, has employed a large number of
persons for the last eighteen years), at the Canoblas, Cadia, Peel-
wood, Cow Flat, Wiseman’s Creek, Carcoar, Molong, Goodrich,
B alar a, Snowball, Frogmore, Currawang, Wellington, Murrumbidgee,
and other districts. Thus it will be seen that New South Wales
possesses a large area of cupriferous country which, with improved
machinery and methods must sooner or later greatly add to this
Colony’s output of copper. Although the low market price of copper
has greatly retarded enterprise in copper-mining; nevertheless there
are at present about 1,500 miners profitably employed in the industry.
Tin.
Our principal tin deposits occur in the Vegetable Creek (Emma-
ville), Copes Creek, the Inverell and Tenterfield districts. The stanni-
ferous deposits, as far as is known, occupy an area of 5,500,000 acres.
Tin, both in alluvial as well as lodes, has also been found at Jingellic
and Dora Creek, Albury district; also at Tumbarumba, and at Sandy
Creek, Tumut district; also at Tibooburra, and some Toadseye or
Wood Tin has been discovered in the auriferous drifts at Milkman’s
Flat, near Grenfell. But as stated above, the Tenterfield and Glen
Innes districts have supplied the principal of our tin productions.
Some of the alluvial stanniferous deposits were very rich, and in
some instances as much as 10 feet in thickness has yielded 000 cwt. of
stream tin of 72 per cent, to the ton. Large fortunes have been made
by working miners in alluvial tin-mining ; but so far, with the excep-
tion of one lode near Tent Hill, Emmaville, known as the Ottery Lode,
few, if any, of the numerous lodes have had even a fair trial.
Professor David, one of New South Wales’s most eminent geologists,
gives it as his opinion that very extensive stanniferous areas covered
over by basalt will sooner or later be prospected and worked, and
bring forth a large increase in the production of tin ore. Careful
geological surveys made by Professor David have brought out facts on
which he based his belief that numbers of deep channels or leads
covered over by basalt, are still lying undisturbed; hence, with the
rise in the price of tin, we may look forward to a great production of
tin, and a healthy reaction in that industry. About 1,500 miners are
still employed in tin-mining.
Antimony.
Antimony in payable quantities has been found in several parts of
the Colony, but principally in the northern district. At Hillgrove, in
the Armidale district, the Eleanora Company alone produced several
hundred tons of smelted antimony, which is only one company of
many. A large quantity of antimony is also produced in the Hillgrove
district by individual miners. Deposits of antimony have also been
discovered at Lunatic Beefs, in the Drake district, at Deep Creek near


TENT HILL TIN-SMELTING WORKS, EMMAVILLE.




Bellinger, and at Bowraville and Taylor’s Arms, in the Kempsey
district. Large blocks of antimony were also obtained at Pyramid in
the Windeyer district.
Iron.
Iron ore is plentiful in almost all parts of New South Wales, but so
far New South Whies can hardly claim to have amongst its many
industries that of iron mining*.
o
Chromium.
Chrome mining has recently made great strides, inasmuch as large
deposits of high quality chrome have been discovered and worked in the
Gundagai district, and it appears to have become a permanent industry.
Chrome in large quantities have also been found at Bowling Alley
Point, in the Nundle district, and other places. °
Bismuth.
This mineral has been found in large and small deposits in different
parts of the Colony; the principal deposits were found in the Glen
limes distuct (in the north), and the Pambula district (in the south).
But as there is so little demand for bismuth no extensive works have
been carried on.
ilium.
Platinum has also been discovered in different parts of New South
Wales, on our northern beaches north and south of Byron Bay. Also,
near Broken Hill, in the far west, and recently in connection with the
auriferous alluvial deposits at Burra Burra, Fifield, and Platina, localities
situated about 60 miles west of Parkes, on and near the Melrose Plains.
This field was opened in 1893, and since that time several thousand
ounces of platinum have been won, the price given is from 20s. to
225. 6d. per oz.
Wolfram.
This mineral has been found in various parts of New South Wales,
mostly at and near our tin-fields; but as the market is very limited
little, if anything, has been done to develop said deposits.
Cohalt, Nickel, and Manganese.
Although these minerals have been found in various parts of the
Colony no mines have been opened, and no miners are employed. A
few tons of cobalt have been forwarded from the Carcoar district to
the European market, but nothing further has been done in the
matter.
Plumbago.
This mineral is also plentiful in New South Wales, but so far it has
not been discovered in really good quality, being’ generally impure.
A shipment has lately been sent to England, and if results turn out to
expectation a start may be made in the industry.
Diamonds.
These precious stones are found in large quantities in the Bingara
and the Inverell districts; but they are generally very small, which
depreciates their market value. It is stated that the Bingara and


Inver ell diamonds are the hardest of all diamonds which reach the
Amsterdam, London, or New York markets from any pait of the
globe. Diamonds have also been found in the Mndgee, Mittagong,
and other districts.
Sapphires, rubies, topaz, garnets, and zircons are plentiful in the
stanniferous drifts of onr tin-fields.
Opals.
This mineral is now found in different parts of New South Wales.
The principal opal mining is now carried on at the "W lute Cliffs,
about 60 miles from Wilcannia, and 160 miles from Broken Hill.
The White Cliff opal, which is of very fine quality, is found in the
cretaceous formation, in small veins varying from a mere thread to
2 inches in thickness at different shallow levels, the deepest so fai
obtained being about 60 feet; and the only guide the miner has is
small veins of common opal known to the miner as potch. Although
these opal fields have only been opened comparatively for a shoit time,
about £lOO,OOO worth of opals has already been extracted. The stratum
is soft, and generally horizontal. As much as £2O has been paid on
the field for 1 oz. of opal. The population on this opal field is about
500. There is a very extensive area of this cretaceous formation
between White Cliffs and Tiboobnrra, or from Wilcannia, including
White Cliffs, Milparinka, and Tiboobnrra, on to the Queensland and
South Australian borders, where, sooner or later, precious opals may
be discovered which may be the cause of turning this hot and an
country, now mere sheep walks, into flourishing mining localities.
Precious opals have also been found in the Carcoar and other districts.
Emeralds.
These were frequently found on the £ eg’etable Gieek (Bmmaville)
Tin-fields. A lode was discovered at Bmmaville containing some very
valuable emeralds; but owing to the hard nature of the countiy in
which they occurred requiring blasting the emeralds became liawec
and fractured, and therefore valueless; hence very little has been done
in emerald mining.
Turquoise.
Works are now carried on in connection with this mineral in the
Wagonga district, but it has not as yet been sufficiently developed to
rank it with payable mining operations. . .
It will thus be seen that there are great opportunities for mining
enterprise. Almost every known mineral, or precious stone, is found
in New South Wales ; the extent of our mineral resources is enormous.
Machinery for the reduction, extraction, and saving of the several
minerals is daily improving, and mines which were abandoned and
considered not payable have lately been retaken, and by improve
machinery are yielding payable returns. _ ,
Mining in New South Wales is certainly only at the first stage
of its existence. Perhaps poor men's fields such as Lambing Flat,
Braidwood, Mudgee, parts of the Tenterfield district, and similar others
may not again be discovered. But gold and tin in large deposits and
areas may be discovered and profitably worked in our extensive river




DIAMOND-DRILL PLANT.


flats, and in the large areas of country covered by basalt in various
parts of New South Wales. Our quartz reefs and lodes will be worked
to greater depth than hitherto, and at a far lesser cost. New discoveries
of rich and payable deposits of different minerals may be expected to
be made not only at or near the old mining fields, but in the hitherto
sparsely prospected mountainous country and the vast scrub lands of
the far west.
Does mining pay ? This is a question frequently asked which can
be easily answered in the affirmative. Mining does and will pay
provided it is made a business, like any other profession, trade or
calling. It requires honesty of purpose, system, economy, energy, and
perseverance, tempered by common-sense and blended with practical
and scientific knowledge. _ If such methods were adopted, then the
lethargy towards mining’ investments would disappear j our mining’
industry would be placed on a solid foundation. Capitalists and miners
should work hand in hand for the mutual good; they should place
confidence in each other, as the injury of one section must leave behind
injurious effects on the other j such actions would tend towards the
employment of large additional numbers of miners and the payment
of dividends for capital invested in our mining industry.
The Gfovernment Diamond Drills under the supervision of Mr. W.
H. J. Slee, Chief Inspector of Mines and Superintendent of Diamond
Drills, have been the means to a very great extent of the rapid
development of our mining industry. This is generally admitted and
duly appreciated by the public. These drills can be obtained from the
Government on very easy terms at a certain rate per foot. As they
are costly, they are never handed over, or allowed to be worked by
parties; but are worked by men engaged and paid by the Government
under the supervision of the above said officer. These drills, while
really assisting in the discovery and development of the great mineral
wealth of this Colony, are almost self-supporting, and very little, if
any, loss to the State. Through g’ain of experiences, and alterations,
and addition in machinery, the cost of boring with Government Diamond
Drills has been considerably lessened.


Collieries.
BY JOHN MACKENZIE, F.G.S., Examiner of Coal Fields.
New South A Vales can, without any exaggeration, claim to be in
possession of the richest, most accessible, and most extensive coal-
fields in the Southern Hemisphere, and with such elements of wealth
and greatness, it possesses the essentials to national prosperity and
power, which are so necessary to make it become a country of the
greatest industrial importance.
Its bituminous, semi-bituminous, splint, anthracitic, and cannel-coals
are equal in thickness and quality to any found in other parts of the
world, and we have numerous deposits of boghead mineral or petroleum
oil, cannel-coal, equal, and some superior to any found in England or
elsewhere. With such resources, the country has the creative power
that must in time (especially as labour becomes cheaper, as it is now
doing) bring to its smelting works and furnaces large quantities of
iron, copper, tin, galena, argentiferous, and other ores, not only from
within its own territory, but from other countries adjacent to and at a
distance therefrom; and coupled with its extensive and varied de-
posits of rich iron ore, it will be able to produce iron in sufficient
quantity to supply the wants of a nation in times of war and peace.
Great Britain and America furnish instances of the value of coal to
those wdio have and utilise it. The continued prosperity of the former
country depends upon the duration of its coal-fields, and all avail-
able means are being taken to economise this primary source of her
prosperity and greatness.
The area over which the coal measures are found embraces an area
of about 23,950 square miles which once formed one large coal basin,
and since its formation upheavals and disturbances of the strata near
the edge of the basin, have there thrown it into a series of anticlinal
and synclinal curves.
During the last few years, the output of the Hew South Wales coal
trade has increased from 2,830,175 tons, valued at £1,303,164, in 1886,
to 3,738,589 tons, valued at £1,095,327, in 1895; and the boghead
mineral (torbanite) from 27,462 tons, valued at £67,239, in 1885, to
59,426 tons, valued at £75,218, in 1895.
Newcastle Harbour (the principal Coal Port Southern Hemisphere)
and its Facilities for Shipment.
Newcastle, in the county of Northumberland, the trade of which is
second only to that of Sydney, owes its great commercial importance
to the different coal-mines which have been opened out close to and
within 32 miles of the harbour.


NEWCASTLE, FROM THE CUSTOM-HOUSE.




On tlie south or town side of tlie harbour, there is a continuous line
of wharf 3,607 feet long belonging to the Government, 2,130 feet of
wbicli is occupied for cargo berths for deep draught vessels, 500
feet reserved for Sydney passenger steamers; and the remaining 977
feet is used as a general cargo wharf, including a lumber berth for
loading vessels with timber. The whole length of this wharf is lit
with gas.
At Bullock Island, on the western side of the harbour, a substantial
timber Government wharf, 7,760 feet in length, and four ballast jetties,
each 50 feet long and 200 feet apart, has been constructed along the
face and round the south end of what was formerly known as the
Ballast Dyke; at present 5,550 feet of this wharf is set apart chiefly
for the shipment of coal. The loading is performed by hydraulic
cranes of which twelve are erected, capable of shipping 1,000 tons of
coal each in twenty-four hours —six being 15-ton, four 9-ton, and two
25-ton cranes, the latter for discharging heavy machinery, &c., and
three 15-ton steam cranes. The remainder of the wharf and the ballast
jetties are used by vessels discharging ballast or waiting their turn to
load. Ships of the largest class can load under the hydraulic cranes,
and proceed direct to sea through deep water channels recently dredged.
It is proposed to spend immediately £150,000 to further increase the
shipping facilities at Bullock Island. This wharf is now lit by electric
light, which greatly facilitates the loading of coal at night, and is one
of the finest systems of electric lighting in existence, consisting of fifty
large arc lamps, each 5,000-candle power.
A branch double line of railway connects the wharf with the Great
Northern railway, and along the back of the wharf is laid a very
extensive system of sidings and standage room for working coal traffic.
A sand dredge is reclaiming foreshore in front of the hydraulic
engine-house, where 2,000 feet of wharf will be erected as a commence-
ment of a 90-acre basin inside the present wharf, which basin it is
intended to dredge to a depth of 25 feet where vessels will be able
to lie in slack water, and the whole will be lit up with the electric
light.
At Stockton, on northern side of harbour, there is a Government
wharf 600 feet long with a shoot capable of shipping 1,000 tons in
twelve hours. A sand dredge is also reclaiming foreshore at Stockton.
In addition to these Government cranes, the Australian Agricultural
Company have three large private shoots capable of delivering 2,000 to
3,000 tons of coal per diem. Vessels loading from them can discharge
their ballast on to the company’s ballast wharf, lying alongside at a
draft of 18 feet 6 inches, and upwards. Vessels drawing 22 feet can load
at the company’s shoots. The Waratah Company also have a shoot at
Port Waratah capable of shipping about 50 tons per hour, and Messrs.
J. and A. Brown have two shoots on the Hunter Biver, at Hexham, 10
miles from Newcastle, capable of shipping 100 tons per hour.
Newcastle Facilities for Shipment of Coal .
The present estimated capabilities for shipment of coal at the above-
mentioned places in Newcastle Harbour is about 24,000 tons per day
by the hydraulic cranes belonging to the Government, and about 4,800
tons per day by private companies.


At Catherine Hill Bay, near Lake Macquarie, the Wallarah Coal
Company have a jetty 1,060 feet, in length, 30 feet above high-water,
with two shoots capable of shipping 1,000 tons in eight hours.
Coal shipped from N
The quantity of coal shipped in 1895 to foreign and intercolonial
ports was 1,920,378 tons, valued at £678,217; and the largest
quantity of coal taken by a steamer (May 30, 1895) was 5,235 tons, by
the “ Port Stephens/’ and by sailing vessel, 4,558 tons, by ship
“ Eoyal Firth,” on June 14, 1895.
Collieries at T Vorh, fyc., in the Northern District, viz., Newcastle, Four-
mile Creeh, Maitland, Greta, East Greta, Singleton, Curlewis,
and Gunnedah.
In 1895 there were sixty-nine collieries at work and opening out in
the Northern district, which raised 2,631,221 tons of coal, valued at
£813,227, and the number of men employed in and about the collieries
was 6,777. The Borehole coal seam is the principal one worked
at the Newcastle collieries, and it varies from 18 feet to 4 feet
2 inches of marketable coal. It is very free from faults, and lies
almost horizontal. It is a bright, bituminous, caking coal, of first-
class quality for steam, smelting, household, and coking purposes, and
a good gas coal. The cost of hewing it is now 2s. Bd. to 3s. per ton, and
the supposed selling price 7s. per ton delivered on board vessels at
Newcastle Harbour. The cost of hewing the Burwood coal seam,
proved to be the next best in quality at and near Newcastle, is 2s. 7d.
per ton, and the selling price is about Is. less than the Borehole coal.
The cost of hewing the Greta coal, situated 35 miles by rail north-west
of Newcastle, is about 2s. per ton.
The Newcastle-Wallsend Goal Company has the Government railway
contract for furnaces at Eveleigh, at 6s. 6d. per ton; the New Anvil
Creek Coal Company has the Murrurundi district contract, at ss. 4d. ;
the East Greta Coal-mining Company has the Newcastle and Singleton
district, at ss. 6d. per ton; the Centenary Coal Company the Werris
Creek, Narrabri, and Armidale district, at Bs.; and Green and Curley,
of Gunnedah, have also the latter contract at 7s. 9d. per ton —this
colliery being situated 294 miles from Sydney.
\
IllawarraDistrict, and its Facilities for Shipment of .
The Wollongong Harbour and Basin is situated 45 miles south of
Sydney Harbour, and at low tide there is a depth of 13 feet of water
at its entrance and alongside the wharf, where there are three cranes
capable of shipping 1,800 tons of coal per hour. The Belmore Basin
has a depth of 17 feet of water at its eastern side, where there are four
shoots, each capable of shipping 100 tons per hour; but as only two
vessels can load there at the same time the largest quantity of coal
shipped by them is 200 tons per hour, or 2,000 tons per day. The
largest steamship which has coaled at the harbour drew about feet
of water, and carried about 900 tons of coal; and the largest sailing
vessel has taken away about 700 tons of coal.


NEWCASTLE HARBOUR, SHOWING STEAM-CRANES.




In addition to tlie Government appliances for shipment of coal at
Wollongong, tlie Coal Cliff, North Illawarra, Bulli, Bellambi, South
Bulli, and Mount Kembla Companies, have jetties of their own, from
which coal is sent by steam colliers, &c., to Port Jackson and else-
where.
The Coal Cliff jetty has a depth of 18 feet of water at high tide,
and 14 feet at low tide, and can ship 100 tons per hour.
The North Illawarra Coal Company, Bulli, Bellambi, South Bulli,
and Mount Kembla Jetties have a depth of about 26 feet of water at
their shoots and can ship about 120 tons per hour.
Goal Shipped at Wollongong Harbour, or the Jetties, and sent by
Rail,
The coal raised in the Illawarra and southern districts in 1895 was
910,123 tons, valued at £239,035.
Collieries at Work in the Illawarra or Southern District.
In 1895 there ware twelve collieries at work in the Illawarra district
that raised 681,782 tons of coal, valued at £174,780, and the number of
men employed in and about the collieries was 1,477, and one colliery
(Metropolitan) in the southern district, at Helensburgh, adjacent to the
Illawarra and South Coast Railw'ay, 27 miles from the Metropolis and 29
miles from Darling Harbour, Sydney, that raised 228,341 tons of coal,
valued at £64,255, and employed 403 men in and about the mine.
The coal seam worked at these twelve collieries is the uppermost one
or No. lof the upper coal measures. It is a semi-bituminous coal used
for steam, smelting, household, blacksmith, and coking purposes, and
varies from 10 feet to 4 feet in thickness. With the exception of the
Metropolitan and South Clifton Collieries, the coal is principally
wrought from adits driven into the seam in the high ranges fronting
the Pacific Ocean at heights of from 20 to 750 feet. The coal seam is
very free from faults, and lies almost horizontal.
The cost of hewing the coal is now 2s. per ton, and the selling price
at the jetties and Wollongong Harbour is supposed to be about 6s. per
ton.
The Metropolitan Coal Company have the Government railway con-
tract for supply of coal to southern district railway depots and portion
of Penrith railway requirements at ss. 4d. per ton, and for Metropolitan
District at ss. lOd.
Collieries at Work in the South-western District.
The South-western Collieries (3) are situated at Joadja, Mittagong,
and Moss Yale, near to the Great Southern Railway. In 1895 they
employed 69 men in and about the collieries, and raised 6,379 tons of
coal valued at £2,803.
The Western Collieries, their Railway and Shipping Appliances.
The Western Collieries are situated 91 to 158 miles from Sydney,
and are adjacent to, or within a short distance of, the Great Western
and Mudgee railway. Their coal meets with a ready sale for railway,
<5


manufacturing, household, and other purposes in all the suburban and
inland towns, and large quantities of slack are there sold for brick and
tile making.
Collieries at worh in Western District.
In 1895 there were fifteen collieries at work, that raised 190,864
tons of coal, valued at £40,260; and the number of men employed
in and about the collieries was 296. The coal seam worked is the
lowest one in the upper coal measures. It is a splint coal, used for
steam, smelting, household, and blacksmith purposes, and is 10 feet
to 11 feet in thickness. About 5 feet 8 inches of it is the portion
wrought and sold. The coal seam is free from faults, and lies almost
horizontal.
The cost of hewing the coal is now Is. Bd. per ton, and the
Lithgow Coal Association supply it to the Railway Department, for
their Penrith requirements, at 4s. 9d. per ton, and for the western
district other than Penrith at 55.; and the Cullen Bullen at 4s. 3d.
per ton, delivered at colliery sidings.
The Gremorne Bore.
On 9th November, 1893, the Sydney Harbour Collieries Company
bored through the Illawarra No. 1 coal, at a depth of 2,917 feet, at
Gremorne, adjacent to the Sydney Harbour, 10 feet 3 inches in thick-
ness, of splint and bituminous coal, which proves the correctness of
the opinions expressed by myself and others that the metropolis is
near the centre of our extensive coal basin, and that the Newcastle
and Illawarra coal measures would be found there. The Company are
in treaty for some land adjacent to their harbour leasehold, on which
two shafts are to be sunk.
Boghead Mineral and Petroleum , Deposits.
These deposits are very irregular in their area, and are found in
isolated patches, generally at a considerable distance apart, in the
midst of the workable coal measures of New South Wales. Whilst
the coal seams are very regular in their character (with the excep-
tion of their generally improving in quality, and thickening as they
leave the edge of the coal basin), the Boghead mineral (tor-
banite) is most irregular, and there is nothing to guide us in telling
where the seam is likely to be, but by finding pieces of it at or below
its outcrop. Near the edge of the deposits this rich mineral deteri-
orates, and gradually changes into indurated clay, bituminous and
non-bituminous shale, coal, or ironstone.
There are four companies getting and selling the mineral, and
two of them manufacture oil and other products therefrom. These
mines are situated at Hartley Yale, Genowlan, Ruined Castle, and
Nellie’s Glen in the western district, and at Joadja in the southern
district, and prospecting is going on in the Capertee Yalley, situated
about 150 miles north-west of Sydney. The richest of the mineral
yields about 100 to 130 gallons of crude oil per ton, and 17,000 to
18,000 cubic feet of 35 to 40 candle gas when gas only is extracted
from it.

The following are extracts from a report furnished by Mr. W. A.
Dixon, F.C.S., F. 1.0., upon the analyses of coals from the principal
coal-fields of Great Britain, which come or may come into competition
with the coals of New South Wales :
Specific weight of Newcastle (New South Wales) and British
coals :
The averages and highest and lowest percentage of sulphur in
Newcastle (New South Wales) and British coals : —•
The averages and highest and lowest quantity of ash in Newcastle
(New South Wales) and British coals :
The averages and highest and lowest percentage of bituminous matter
and water in Newcastle (New South Wales) and British coals : —-
The above results show that the coal from our northern coal-fields
is practically equal for all purposes to the best English coal, and that
for gas-making it is on a par with English Newcastle.

Water Conservation, Irrigation, and Drainage.
BY H. G. MCKINNEY, M. Inst. C.E., Chief Engineer for Water
Conservation.
One of the most remarkable characteristics of tire continent of Aus-
tralia is the absence of bigli mountains and of great mountain chains.
Perpetual snows which elsewhere feed the rivers during spring and
summer are almost unknown, so that Australian rivers, as a general
rule, are irregular in their flow, while in many cases they disappear
altogether in marshes or on sandy plains. These serious drawbacks
are felt throughout Australia, and constitute a formidable barrier to
the progress of settlement; but their effect throughout a large portion
of New South Wales is slight in comparison with other parts of the
continent. The mountain range which runs through this colony from
south to north, approximately parallel to the coast, and the summit of
which is roughly about 70 miles from the coast line on an average, is
the source of many important rivers flowing both east and west, and is
also the source of vast deposits of rich alluvium on the western plains
and of smaller though important and not less rich deposits in the
coastal districts. But the Dividing Eange, as it is termed, is not the
only one which exercises great and far-reaching effects in connection
with the water supply of New South Wales. This range extends
northward through Queensland j but near the southern boundary of
that colony, the range which forms the northern boundary of the
drainage area of the River Darling, strikes off in a north-westerly direc-
tion. As it passes westward, this watershed becomes less clearly
defined, and is in places represented merely by high rolling downs.
The area in Queensland south of this watershed is considerably over
100,000 square miles, so that New South Wales receives surplus water
and silt from that area beyond its northern boundary. In addition, it
is considered to be now practically proved that the source of the
splendid supplies of artesian water which have been found in southern
Queensland and in the northern and north-western districts of this
colony have their source in the watershed described.
The Dividing Range varies generally from 2,000 to 5,000 feet in
height, but the Snowy Range, which is the name given to the most
elevated part of it, is seldom, if ever, without snow in some of its
ravines, and among its peaks includes Mount Kosciusko, the highest
mountain in Australia. The Snowy Range is the source of the River
Murray, while the Tumut River, the principal tributary of the Murrum-
bidgee, heads from the northern side of the same watershed. With
such a source as this it naturally follows that both the Murray
and Murrumbidgee have an abundant flow in the spring months, while


the former always, and tlie latter generally, lias a good supply during
the greater part of summer. These two rivers are the most valuable
in the Colony as a source of water for irrigation purposes, and as their
courses, after leaving the mountains, pass through immense alluvial
plains of great fertility, the utilisation of their waters in irrigation
canals is a question to be dealt with in the near future. Schemes for
this object have, in fact, already been prepared. The rivers north of
the Murrumbidgee, which flow westward from the Dividing Range,
are more uncertain in their supplies. The land along the courses of
these rivers is of a very fertile description, and has been proved to be
well adapted for irrigation.
The outline of the country east of the Dividing Range differs widely
from that of the country extending westward. In the case of the latter
there are broad expanses of tableland, the mountains decline gradually
till they finally disappear beneath the great sea of alluvium, and the
plains which thus extend from the slopes of the hills, though to all
appearance perfectly level, have a fall varying generally from 3 feet
down to 1 foot per mile. On the other hand, between the summit of
the Dividing Range and the coast the mountains generally fall rapidly,
and, beginning abruptly from their base, the alluvial flats, including
extensive areas of swamps, and of land subject to inundation, extend
seaward.
For the consideration in outline of questions relating to water con-
servation, irrigation, and drainage, and, in fact, for the elucidation of
important points in connection with settlement on the land, it is most
convenient to regard the Colony as consisting of four great natural
divisions. These are, first, the coast district; second, the Dividing
Range and the high tableland; third, the western slopes of the
Dividing Range ; and, fourth, the great plains of the interior.
The Coastal District.
Taking the coastal district as a whole, it may be broadly stated that
as the eastern slope of the Dividing Range is steep, the fall of the
rivers rapid, and the alluvial flats difficult to irrigate satisfactorily,
the conditions, as a rule, are not favourable for any large schemes for
water conservation and irrigation. Besides, the average rainfall is so
nearly sufficient for ordinary farm crops that irrigation would not, as a
general rule, be rumunerative even under favourable conditions as
regards the nature of the land, and the facilities for obtaining water.
It is otherwise in the case of crops like fruit and vegetables, which
require more care, and the value of which per acre is comparatively
high. For such crops, irrigation, if conducted under fairly favourable
circumstances, and in a business-like manner, is highly remunerative.
In the best instances of this in the coastal district the land irrigated
consists of rich and deep river deposits underlaid by boulders and drift
and the water is raised by steam power to a height of thirty to fifty
feet. The soil is sufficiently porous to allow of gradual percolation
down to the drift and boulders, which provide excellent subsoil drain-
age. Under such circumstances, experienced fruit-growers have found
that an initial outlay of £2O per acre on pumping plant and fittings is
more than justified by the results.


Hitherto irrigation has been carried on in the coastal district in
comparatively few places, and on a very moderate scale. The results
have, however, been sufficient to indicate fairly the direction in which
further development may be expected. The alluvial deposits along
courses of the coastal rivers and their tributaries are in many, if not
most cases underlaid by drift and boulders in which good supplies of
water can be obtained. There is a strong probability that water derived
from such sources will play an important part in future irrigation.
Water can be obtained direct from the rivers and streams in many
places by pumping, and in a few by gravitation; but as the coastal
rivers rise and fall rapidly, and their range of surface level is generally
great, there is considerable risk and expense with either method.
The question of drainage is more important than that of irrigation,
so far as the coastal district is concerned. Extensive areas of low-
lying swampy land are found near the mouths of the majority of the
rivers, and in some cases extending to along distance up their courses.
These tracts of swampy land are, as a rule, adjacent to the tidal
portions of the river, and they are generally composed of rich deposits
washed down from the higher parts of the river basins. The early
settlers soon discovered the richness of these delta lands, and all the
parts easily accessible were soon taken up. As a large proportion of
the delta lands were subject to inundation from the rivers, while in
addition there were extensive areas which were more or less liable to
be affected by tidal waters, the necessity for drainage works was
obvious. It proved, however, that legislation was necessary to authorise
the construction of such works, and to compel all landowners who bene-
fited by them to contribute to their first cost and cost of maintenance
in proportion to the benefits received. Hence the “ Drainage Promo-
tion Act ”was passed, an Act which has been of very considerable
service, particularly on the alluvial lands of the Macleay, Hunter, and
Shoalhaven Rivers.
Notwithstanding the fact that the alluvial lands of the coast district
are, as a rule, of great fertility, and that the means of carrying out
drainage works by co-operative effort have been available for more
than thirty years, the progress made with the drainage and reclama-
tion of lands subject to inundation has been comparatively small.
Doubtless this is in a large measure accounted for by the immense
areas of land available for settlement which did not require such
labour and expenditure as are involved in the construction and main-
tenance of a system of drains. As labour has become more abundant,
and labour-saving appliances are more efficient and better understood,
there is a near prospect of a more extended effort being made to utilise
to the best advantage the extensive areas of deep and fertile soil
which only require systematic drainage, and the produce from which
will, in most cases, have the great advantage of water carriage. The
best evidences of the results of successful drainage are to be seen on
some of the larger properties, where swamps which were of little or no
value, have been converted into first-class land for pasturage or agri-
culture. Enough has been done to indicate the importance of the
question of drainage and reclamation and to give some idea of the
great development which will result from systematic and well-con-
sidered action.


The Dividing Range and the High Tableland.
As regards water conservation, irrigation, and drainage, this portion
of the Colony calls for little remark. Possessed of a fair average rain-
fall, and a comparatively temperate climate —the average temperature
at Cooma, in the southern part of the tableland, for instance, being
almost identical with that of Paris —the necessity for irrigation is
seldom felt. This division of the Colony must in the course of time
become a highly interesting one as regards water conservation; for
here, and on the western slopes of the Dividing Eange, storage
reservoirs will be required to regulate the supply of water in the
western rivers. The site of one such reservoir has been fixed near the
head waters of the Murrumbidg’ee; but works of this description will
naturally await definite action towards fully utilising the supplies of
water at present available.
~ ’ The Western S 'lopes of the Dividing Range.
The part of the Colony included under this head extends from the
border of the high tablelands to the edge of the great western, or,
rather, central plain. Referring to the map of the drainage area of
the river Murray, it will be observed that on the east, south, and north
sides of this basin there are important tributary rivers which flow into
the great central plain. This central plain may be compared to a sea
of alluvium, in which tracts of ridgy country, and occasional isolated
ridg’es and hills, stand out like islands. On the slopes of the watershed
the courses of the rivers lie through mountainous or hilly country, and
follow ravines or well-defined valleys ; but from the places where they
reach the g'reat central plain, their valleys cease to be defined, and the
courses of the rivers are in a state of perpetual change. The points
on the principal rivers of this Colony at which this change occurs are
Bungowannah, about 6 miles below Albury, on the Murray; Narrandera,
on the Murrumbidgee; Forbes, on the Lachlan; Narromine, on the
Macquarie; Gunnedah, on the Namoi; and Pallamallawa, on the
Gwydir.
As only currents of high velocity will move boulders and pebbles,
it is naturally found that while the western rivers carry fine silt for
hundreds of miles, the coarse deposits are, as a rule, found only near
the mountains. Thus it may generally be assumed that the soil in the
valleys of the western slopes of the Dividing Range is underlaid by
boulders, pebbles, or coarse drift. Hence these valleys are specially
adapted for irrigation, and as instances of this fact there is an irrigated
farm near Gunnedah which has no superior in the Colony, and irrigation
has been practised with success at Forbes, on the Lachlan, and on the
Tumut River which is a tributary of the Murrumbidgee. The valleys
in this division of the Colony can in some cases be watered by gravita-
tion, in others by pumping from the rivers, and in others by pumping
from wells sunk into the drift. The depth and fertility of the soil
will in many .cases warrant considerable outlay on irrigation works.
The adaptability of such land for producing under irrigation first-class
crops of fruit, fodder, cereals, tubers, &c., has been abundantly proved.
In every case where the watering of crops has been dealt with in a
scientific and business-like manner the result has been highly satisfac


tory. But the population is still sparse, and only a few of the land-
owners understand the value of water, while of those who do only a
small proportion know how to manage irrigation systematically. Hence,
although in favourable seasons good crops have been obtained without
artificial watering, the true capabilities of the valleys of the western
slopes of the Dividing Range are comparatively little known.
In connection with this division of the Colony, it is worthy of special
mention that this is probably the safest place for the novice in irriga-
tion to gain experience. It is a common mistake for the beginner to
use far more water than is required. In many places this would be
ruinous to the crop,, but here, on account of the generally porous nature
of the soil and the excellence of the subsoil drainage, the risk of loss
from over-watering is reduced to a minimum.
The Great Central and Western Plains.
This division of the Colony, in which is included the whole territory
west of the Dividing Range, is the great field for water conservation
and irrigation. While a large proportion of the land is fertile, the
rainfall is light, especially in the extreme west. The courses of the
rivers after entering the Great Central Plains flow generally through
alluvial land, and the waters are diminished by absorption, percolation,
and evaporation, while there is no inflow of drainage to compensate
for these losses. The deposits of silt in the lower parts of the river
channels has contracted the waterways, so that the channels are unequal
to the task of carrying off the flood waters. Extensive inundations
are therefore frequent, while in many cases the overflowing waters
form effluent creeks, the great majority of which are liable to become
dry when the river falls.
The early settlers who took up the land for pastoral purposes found
at the outset that without tanks and dams only a small proportion of
the land could be utilised. With commendable enterprise, and not-
withstanding the want of any suitable law dealing with water rights,
and in many cases, despite a precarious tenure of the land, the pastor-
alists expended large sums of money on works for conserving water.
The construction of dams at intervals along the courses of creexs was
followed by the excavation of tanks in suitable places to catch and
retain the surface water. Subsequently, wells were sunk wherever a
surface supply could not be obtained, and where there was reason to
hope for underground water. The supplies thus tapped were made
available by horse power, and more recently by windmills. The
stock-carrying capacity of the Colony has thus been enormously
increased, and extensive tracts of country, which in the early days of
settlement were classed as uninhabitable, now aflord sustenance to
hundreds of thousands of sheep. The importance of the pastoral
industry thus rose with the numbers of tanks, dams, and wells, which
made the existing pasturage available for stock.
Throughout the western districts of the Colony, and particularly
beyond the River Darling, the storage of water was a matter of much
difficulty, owing to the lightness of the rainfall and the extreme dry-
ness of the climate; but the discovery that artesian water in large
quantities is to be found throughout a great part of the north and


north-west of the Colony has put a new and much-improved com-
plexion on the position of the landholders. A larg’e number of
successful artesian bores have been put down by the pastoralists, and
the water from these bores is conducted in some cases to a distance
of many miles for the convenience of the stock. The water thus
obtained and distributed has had a most important effect in increasing
the stock-carrying capacity of a number of large pastoral holdings.
In some cases the pastoralists combined to construct works affecting
great lengths of creek frontage. Two works of this description,
which were carried out without any aid from the Government, have
had an important effect in the districts in which they are situated.
One of these works was the improvement of the Great Anabranch of
the River Darling by deepening the outflow from the river, and
constructing a series of dams along the course of the Anabranch.
The other work referred to was the construction of a dam at the head
of the Teryaweynya Creek to prevent the return to the River Darling
of the flood waters which pass down the Lower Tallywalka. In each
of these cases the effect of the work constructed was to create several
hundred miles of water frontage, and to store large quantities of water
in lakes and depressions.
A heavy expenditure was incurred by pastoralists in improving
Yanko Creek, a natural effluent from the Murrumbidgee, and the
Willandra Billabong, a similar outlet for flood water from the
Lachlan; but in both of these cases the results were disappointing
till the works were taken in hand by the Government. Formerly,
when moderate to high floods were passing down the Murrumbidgee,
Yanko Creek carried off a portion of these waters to the Billabong
Creek, the waters of which flow through the Edward River to the
Murray. With the improvements which have been made in the
channel of Yanko Creek, it has been practically transformed into a
continuously running stream. As the united lengths of Yanko Creek
and its effluent, Colombo Creek, is about 250 miles, the result of the
improvement has been that about 500 miles of water frontage has
been created.
The Willandra Billabon g in its natural state flowed only during the
short and uncertain periods when the Lachlan was in flood. In this
case, also, the pastoralists expended a large amount in improving the
effluent channel; but the results were not commensurate with the
expenditure. When the Government took up the matter, it was found
that in addition to further improvements of the creek channel it was
necessary to construct a weir, so as to raise the surface level of the
River Lachlan about 12 feet at the outflow. A cribwork weir was
accordingly constructed, and its effect has been that a portion of the
waters of the Lachlan has flowed almost without intermission in the
Willandra Billabong since the weir was completed nearly five years
ago. This weir, which has successfully stood through an exceptional
series of floods, and has thoroughly fulfilled its object, is shown in the
accompanying view. As the river rises, the difference in level above
and below the weir diminishes; hence, as the view was taken when
there was a considerable depth of water in the river, a large portion of
the weir was covered. As the course of the Willandra Billabong


extends through a fertile but very dry district to a distance of
considerably over a hundred miles in a direct line from its head on the
River Lachlan, its importance for water supply purposes is obvious.
A weir on the Macquarie River, near Warren, with objects similar
to those of the Willandra weir, is now almost complete, and another
weir on the Macquarie, and a second on the Lachlan, are about to be
commenced. In all these cases, the effluent creeks, which constitute
ready-made distributaries for the water available from the rivers, are
to be utilised to the fullest extent practicable. The weirs which are
being constructed differ in design according to the of
each case. That at Warren, which is shown in the accompanying-
view, is constructed entirely of timber, while the weir about to be
commenced at a point about 80 miles further up the Macquarie will be
of concrete.
A comparatively small and inexpensive, but nevertheless important
work for water conservation, constructed by the Government, is a self-
acting floodgate, which retains water in Lake Cudgellico. This lake,
which is over 4,000 acres in extent, is filled in times of flood by the
overflow from the River Lachlan ; but under natural conditions nearly
all the water would flow back to the river as the floods subsided. The
erection of the floodgate has made the supply in the lake permanent^
The outline given of the means by which water has been, and is
being conserved for stock and domestic purposes throughout the
country west of the Dividing Range shows that both the landholders
and the Government are fully alive to the importance of the question.
The arrangements for water supply are, in fact, so far advanced that
in times of drought the stock suffer much more through want of food
than want of water. The time is therefore ripe for considering what
is best to be done to supplement the food supply for stock, to com-
pensate in some degree for the inequality of the seasons, and to lessen
the liability to losses through droughts.
The same class of enterprise which the early settlers showed in
adopting means for utilising the pasturage in the dry districts, has
already been shown by some of the present landholders in increasing
the food supplies for stock by irrigation. An interesting experiment
bearing on this subject was made some years ago on the Lower Darling,
in a district so dry that it was not considered safe to estimate that the
land could sustain more than one sheep to 10 acres on an average.
The object of the experiment was to determine how many sheep could
be kept in good condition by the produce of one acre of irrigated
lucerne. The result showed conclusively that over twenty sheep could
be so sustained. This was merely an experiment, but its result was
highly suggestive. The adoption of irrigation in connection with the
pastoral industry has, however, gone beyond the experimental stage.
On the lower parts of the courses of some of the rivers, the banks
are higher than the land adjacent to them. Taking advantage of this,
some of the landholders have made cuttings out from the rivers so as
to flood the land by gravitation. Wherever this can be done at
moderate expense, the result is highly satisfactory, and it has proved
remunerative to irrigate even the natural grasses in this way. As
an instance of the increase of grass produced by this method of irriga-
tion, it may be mentioned that two larger paddocks near the Lower

Lachlan, which had failed to sustain 4,000 sheep in the season before
the flooding commenced, successfully supported 12,000 sheep, 120
cattle, and 200 horses in the first season during which the flooding
was in operation. The rivers which can best be utilised in places for
this class of irrigation at a moderate expense are the Murrumbidgee,
the Lachlan, and the Macquarie.
Pumping from the rivers or creeks is, however, the commonest
method of supplying water for irrigation. Although no great area
has been irrigated in any one instance, there are steam pumps used for
this purpose on almost every river west of the Dividing Range, and on
some of the more important creeks. As the river or creek bank is
frequently the highest ground in its neighbourhood, and the land slopes
away gradually from the bank, the natural facilities for distributing-
water raised by pumping are excellent. The crop most commonly
grown by irrigation in this manner is lucerne, but wheat for hay,
cereals, and root crops have all been grown successfully, while an irri-
gated orchard and vegetable garden is now looked on as a proper, if
not a necessary adjunct to every homestead possessed of water frontage.
The artesian bores which have already been referred to as providing-
supplies of water for stock in the dry districts of the north-west part of
the Colony, have another most important function to fulfil, namely,
providing for the means of adding to the food supply. In some cases
the artesian bores have even now become the centre of little oases of
cultivation, but the question of the proper utilisation of the artesian
water is still in its infancy. The great value of reserves of fodder and
other crops to assist in tiding over droughts is beginning to be more
widely understood, especially in such dry districts as those in which the
artesian wmter is obtained. The altered conditions which may be looked
forward to when this part of the colony will be dotted over with
artesian bores, each of them the centre of an irrigated farm, will amply
justify the statement that the discovery of the extensive supplies of
artesian water was equivalent to the addition of a new province. As
this water has a high temperature, is frequently well-suited for wool-
scouring, and sometimes rises with such force as to be capable of
working powerful machinery, the field for its usefulness is wide and
varied.
The classes of irrigation already referred to are all such as have
been carried out by enterprising landholders for the improvement of
their own properties. But there is a wide field for works of an exten-
sive character which will benefit large areas, and provide the means
for high-class cultivation and closer settlement. This is no mere theory
or opinion, as the practicability of such works has been established
beyond question by comprehensive surveys carried out at the expense
of the Government. The Murray and the Murrumbidgee are by far the
best sources of supply for irrigation canals, and the country between
these rivers is singularly adapted for irrigation on a large scale. West-
ward from Albury on the Murray and from Narrandera on the Murrum-
bidgee, this district may be described as a great alluvial plain in which
the ground falls in a north-westerly direction from the Murray and in a
south-westerly direction from the Murrumbidgee. Schemes have been
prepared for irrigation on an extensive scale from both rivers, and the
conditions in both cases are highly favourable. It is estimated that


on the construction of the proposed canals on the south side of the
Murrmnhidgee there will he a fair return on the outlay if the water he
let on lease at the rate of £BO per annum for a right to 540,000 gallons
per day. As the lessee of such a right would have to take the risk of
the available supply in the river falling short of requirements, it was
necessary to calculate what the holder of such a right would have
received during the last ten years, and what rate the water would have
cost. It was found that during that period the actual cost of water to
such a leaseholder would have heen at the rate of 22,800 gallons for
one penny.
A scheme has also heen prepared for irrigation on a large scale on
the north side of the Murrmnhidgee, and the extent to which such
schemes are practicable in connection with the other rivers west of the
Dividing Range has heen determined. Hitherto the great obstacle in
the way, not only of large schemes, hut of irrigation even on a moderate
scale, has heen the want of suitable legislation dealing with water rights.
This drawback is likely to he remedied in the near future, as the
Government has the matter in hand.
The great question of locking the river Darling, which, in point of
length, ranks among the more important navigable rivers of the world,
has heen entered on. This will have the double effect of providing
cheap and permanent water carriage, and of affording greatly improved
and extended facilities for irrigation by pumping.
It will he seen from the foregoing that the progress of water conser-
vation and irrigation in the country west of the Dividing Range has
heen steady and natural. Bearing in mind that in the absence of
legislation dealing with riparian rights, the works in use exist only
on sufferance, the progress made must he regarded as creditable.
Operations have heen conducted on safe lines; and if less has heen done
than in some other countries and colonies, it is so far satisfactory that
serious mistakes have heen avoided. When the question of water rights
is placed on a sound footing, there is every reason to anticipate that
opportunities for water conservation and irrigation will rapidly he availed
of to meet the requirements of the country.




ARTESIAN BORE, WARREGO DISTRICT. Depth, 1,729 ft.; flow, 4,000,000 gallons daily.


The Rise and Progress of Artesian Boring.
BY J. W. BOULTBEE, Superintendent of Public Watering Places
and Artesian Boring.
Artesian boring* is an enterprise of comparatively recent date in tliis
Colony, and although the existence of supplies of artesian water was
demonstrated as far back as 18 79, by a successful bore sunk by Mr.
David Brown at Kallara Station, it did not then attract the attention
it deserved, and private enterprise languished entirely until the
successful completion of a bore put down by Mr. Davis upon the
Kerribree Station, on the Bourke to Hungerford road. From this
inception the work has spread until the present moment, and from
information collected by the Department it is shown that over one
hundred bores have been sunk by private enterprise, yielding a supply
of over 30,000,000 gallons of water per diem. By this means many
stations hitherto dependent upon wells, or the precarious supply pro-
vided by the conservation of the rainfall, and run oh in tanks and
dams, are provided with a copious and permanent flow, which gives
such properties an increase in value that cannot be estimated. The
water distributed by channels 20 and 30 miles in length throughout
the length and breadth of the holdings, gives a double frontage in
each case far superior to that of the river area.
The Government commenced operations in 1884 by undertaking a
series of bores upon the Bourke to Wanaaring road, under the direction
of the Superintendent of Drills. Some success attended the efforts made
—-the cost of the work and the ineffective appliances used induced the
Department to adopt the contract system, then in vogue successfully
in Queensland. This system was adopted in 1890, and since that date
the progress has been rapid and assuring. There are now forty-three
Government bores, yielding a supply of over 16,000,000 gallons per diem.
The work is carried out under the direction of the Secretary for Mines
and Agriculture, by the Superintendent of Public Watering Places
and Artesian Boring*. The policy of the Government in undertaking*
this work has been primarily to provide water upon the dry and im-
passable stock routes of the arid portions of the Colony, and by a
judicious selection of sites to also furnish geological evidence of the
limit and extent of the water-bearing formations.
It was until quite recently supposed that artesian water would only
be found to occur in the cretaceous formation, which occupies approxi-
mately an area of 42,000 square miles in the north and north-western
portions of the Colony. Palaeontological evidence, however, in the
form of fossil plants, tseniopteris daintreei and thinnfeldia odontop-
teroides, discovered by the Government Geologist, Mr. E. F. Pittman,
in the strata from the Coonamble and Moree bores, demonstrates the


existence of artesian water in rocks of triassic age. The importance
of this discovery cannot be estimated, as it practically opens up a new
field for this enterprise, and if, as the Government Geologist hints,
the formation possibly extends across to the Leigh Creek coal beds in
South Australia, the area in which the occurrence of artesian water
may be looked for is enormously enlarged.
One of the most important questions that can be raised in connection
with our Artesian Supply is that of its permanency. This has been
fully dealt with by Mr. Jack, the Government Geologist of Queens-
land, who recently, in a most able paper, read before the Brisbane
meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement ot
Science, gave an account of his researches and explorations, m which
the intake beds of the cretaceous system were followed and marked
out showino- such an enormous increase in what had hitherto been
supposed to be the whole of the intake, that he could only presume
the exhaustion of the supply under conditions of such dioug t 1a
would mean the total annihilation of man and a greater part ot the
Australian fauna. His report reads thus ;
It is not within the scope of a single paper to consider the whole subject of artesian
water. My object in addressing this section has been to point out what light has been
thrown on the question, so far as it affects Queensland, by recent V e
have shown that an intake at sufficient altitude to account for the flow of water in the
artesian bores of the west exists along the eastern margin of the lower cretaceous, and
having found a simple explanation in agreement with known physical laws, 1 go no
further in search of another. I have argued that the loss of water by the river Darling,
and probably a similar loss of water by the western Queensland rivers, proves that the
water-bearing strata must leak into the sea, and hence that unless the strata be periodi-
cally replenished the sea level would ultimately become the level to which the water
would rise. A drought sufficiently long to bring about this result would, no doubt, have
for a prior result the destruction of the greater part of the land fauna of this part ot
Australia, including the genus homo.
Since that date, in a paper read before the Royal Society of New
South Wales (December, 1895), Mr. Pittman, the Government Geolo-
gist reports the result of his examination of the intake beds of the
triassic rooks, and shows that these occupy an enormous area to the
east of (and additional to) the intake beds of the cretaceous formation
as surveyed by Mr. Jack.
An important discovery was made by our Government Geologis.
during 1894. By an inspection of a supposed opal field in Bidura
Parish, County of Caira, about 40 miles north of the town of Balranald,
he discovered that cretaceous rocks _ occurred nearly 200 miles to the
south of the southernmost limit hitherto assigned to them. n a
report dated 14th June, 1894, he writes :
One fact in connection with these rocks is of very great interest, viz., that they have
all the appearance of the upper cretaceous beds, while the underlying clays, together
with the occurrence of concretionary fragments of calcareous sandstone, under the sam
ridges over a considerable area of this country, appear to indicate that the lower cretaceous
beds are also present.
The journey from Hay to Oxley was made during the night, and, therefore, I was
unable to examine the geological formation of the country between these two places;; but
from a point about 12 miles west of Oxley to Bidura, and thence south warn m Ba.ranald,
the same formation appears to extend.


It would thus appear that the cretaceous rocks occur nearly 250 miles to the south of
. 16 f outhermost limifc hithertp assigned to them, and the importance of this occurrence
m view of the possibility of their containing artesian water, can hardly be over-estimated.’
Ihe south-western corner of the Colony is very subject to long-continued droughts, and
le advantages to be obtained from supplies of artesian water away from the river
frontages would be very great indeed.
It may be that these cretaceous rocks are merely an outlying or isolated patch, in
which case it is hardly likely that they would contain artesian water, as I am not aware
of any high ground to the eastward, where porous beds come to the surface in such a
way as to form an intake for the rain supplies ; but, on the other hand, it is quite possible
that the area under consideration may be an extension southwards to the great northern
and north-western cretaceous basin, and, if this be so, the possibilities in regard to its
containing artesian water are very great.
I therefore venture to recommend that, with a view to testing the question, a bore be
put down on a travelling stock reserve within the area indicated.
In a report of later date (31st December, 1894), Mr. Pittman writes
as follows upon an area examined lying to the west of the Paroo
Kiyer, bounded on the north by the Queensland border, and on the
south by the line joining Broken Hill and Wilcannia •
Perhaps the most important conclusion at which I have arrived is that the artesian
basin has probably a much further extension southwards than had been previously
assigned to it. It has hitherto been considered that the southern boundary of the cre-
taceous basin was formed by a bar, or buried range of paloeozoic rocks, stretching west-
ward from Cobar, through Wilcannia, to Scropes’ Range. At Wilcannia the rocks forming
this supposed bar were regarded as Devonian, and this opinion appears to have been
ormed on lithological evidence only, as there is no record of any Devonian fossils
ia\ mg een found in situ, nor of any geological section in w r hich the relation of these
VV ilcanma sandstones is described with regard to older sediments. But in my opinion
ae lithological character of these sandstones points to their being of mesozoic rather
than of palceozoic age, and the small amount of geological evidence, that can be obtained
rom a surface examination, seems to strengthen that view. Deposits of hard sediments
which I observed at certain localities-such as at the west of the Koko range, at Koon-
ingberry, at the western end of Mount Murchison, at the western end of Woychugga
Lake at the Springs, and at the northern end of Scropes’ Range-may be, and probably
are, of Devonian age. They consist of hard, dense, thick bedded quartzites, similar in
character to those of Mount Lambie, near Bathurst, showing slicken-sided joints, and,
as a rule, lying at a high angle with the horizon. But the rocks at Wilcannia are of a
different character. They consist of soft, yellowish, greyish, and whitish grits and sand-
stones, frequently containing bands and pockets of kaolin, and lying, as a rule, at a very
ow angle of inclination. In fact, while one set of rocks shows abundant evidence of both
metamorphism and disturbance, the other is remarkably free from signs of either.
My conclusion in regard to these rocks is that they are probably of upper cretaceous
age, ana if this be correct it means that, instead of the cretaceous basin being cut off on
the south by an east and west boundary through Wilcannia, there may be a deep channel
somewhere between Woychugga Lake and Mount Manara, by which the Artesian basin
may have extended far to the southwards, possibly even under Eocene beds of the Lower
Darling of the north western portion of Victoria and part of South Australia to the
neighbourhood of Mount Gambier, where fresh water has long been known to escape as
springs on the sea coast, as was first pointed out by the Rev. Tennison Woods. It is
quite possible that this water, however, may be derived from the Eocene beds themselves,
and not from underlying cretaceous beds.
The policy of tlie Department lias not been to confine its proposed
operations to any stated district or area, but to give attention also to
the wants of the north-western and northern parts of the Colony, viz.,
R


Silverton to Milparinka, Milparinka to Wanaaring, Wanaaring to
Bourke, Bourke to Hungerford and Barringun, Bourke to Cobar,
Narrabri to Moree, Moree to Boggabilla, Collarendabri to Angledool,
Nyugan to Coouamble, Walgett to Coouamble, Brewarrina to Yyngan,
wliicli are for tbe most part arid districts; and tliis policy as now
extended will be found to be of great benefit to the country at large,
and do much to open up the country and promote settlement.
The Department has in all let 21 contracts for Artesian Boring, and
together with 3 contracts taken over from the Works Department,
make a total of 24. These comprise in all 81_ bores, of which 43 have
been completed. Of these contracts one has just been recently let for
bores at Mulga Valley and Cobham, on the "Whlcannia to Milparinka
road, and bores at Yalpunga and to the north, on the Milparinka
to Wompah road.
Complete records of the Groveruiuent Bores, as to strata, depth, flow,
temperature, pressure, diameter, casing, &c., are kept by the Depart-
ment for reference, and samples of the strata are preserved. Also
analyses of the waters and soils are made, with a view to the future
possibilities in the way of irrigation by means of artesian water.
The following is an extract made from a report of Mr. J. G. H.
Mingaye, F.C.S., M.A.1.M.E., Analyst and Assayer to the Department
of Mines, on the question :
It has been stated that our artesian waters are unsuitable for irrigation purposes, and
that when a water contains 30-40 or 50 grains per gallon of total solids, its use after a
time will kill all vegetation. That is so, as would also be the case with the ordinary river
water in time, without any system of proper drainage, the evaporation of the water
causing the saline matter to crust on the surface of the soils, and thus tend to destroy
plant life. A most important constituent in the composition of the total solids in these
waters is the rather large proportion of potash present, thus contributing this important
fertilizer to the soils which are irrigated with the waters. A large amount of valuable
work has been performed in America and India, i. e. , use of saline waters for irrigation
purposes, where in places great difficulty has occurred as to the rise of reh in the
soils. Our soils in the western district, where the most of these artesian bores are.
situated being of a sandy nature, and good depth, a water containing a fair amount
of saline matter could be used for irrigation, where the same water if applied to another
class of soil, i.e., stiff clay or loam, for some years, especially if the drainage was not
properly carried out, and occasionally the soluble salts worked out, cause the soil to
become saturated and in time kill all vegetation. It has been found in America that the
carbonate of soda is the worst form of salt that has to be contended against in the use
of these saline waters for irrigation purposes. It renders the soil caustic and corrosive,
and dissolves the humus which is shown by the dark colour of the water standing on
alkali spots, and the black rings left when such water evaporates. By the use of gypsum
(Calcium sulphate) in small quantities its corrosive action can be remedied to a great
extent. A chemical action takes place, the gypsum in contact with the carbonate
of soda forming carbonate of lime and sulphate of soda (Glauber s salt). The fiist is
beneficial to the soil, and the latter is a neutral salt, which, according to Professor
E. W. Hilvard, is from ten to twenty times less injurious than the carbonate of soda.
In America, in districts affected with the carbonate of soda in the soil, it has been found
in numerous cases that the simple use of gypsum, conjointly with summer tillage to keep
the soil loose, has sufficed to enable land that never before produced anything of value to
bear abundant crops. By the aid of deep tillage and rotation of crops it is often possible
to absorb a large amount of these soluble salts or “ reh” in the plant. Beets, carrots,
and many other root crops are known to absorb a large amount of soiuble salts (cidc

• In mer l ca Breat s f rides ai ’e feeing made in the development of
irrigation from artesian wells. It may not perhaps be generally
known to what extent this is now being used. F F Lj
As illustrative of the American experience, the following extracts are
g u ?T f j° m n Co ° T nel Rlckard Hmton s valuable reports « The Artesian
and Underflow Investigation,” published by the Secretary of Agricul-
ture, Washington, m 1892. Colonel Hinton states:
Artesian water is used more extensively for irrigation purposes in California than in any
b te m the Union, as at the end of the year 1891 it was estimated that out of ICO 000
«cies irrigated from artesian wells west of the D7th meridian, 50,000 acres were in


California. Irrigation with artesian water for raising all kinds of fruit, lucerne, veget-
ables, and to a small extent of grain, has been practised for years, and can be looked on as
a permanent success. This water, however, is generally too valuable for cultivation of
grain, and is mostly devoted to the intense cultivation, now so largely carried on in fruit
growing districts.
Engineer William Hall in liis report on Perris Irrigation District,
dated August/ 1891, states :
Between 18S0 and 1881 the canal of the Riverside Colony was a line of demarcation
between land worth no more in the market than 10 dollars (£2) per acre, and other readily
saleable at 250 dollars (£5O) per acre. Those above the canal were without irrigation, and
there w r as but a vague hope of ever securing it. But the building of the Upper Riverside
or Gage Canal (source from artesian wells) in 1885-6 made water rights available for these
upper lands, they paid a big bonus for the water privilege, and are now selling at 200
dollars (£4O) to 500 dollars (£100) per acre, without improvements.
It may also be of some interest to quote from tire report of Professor
Hill, Geologist for Texas, New Mexico and Indian Territory, U.b.A.
He points out that there are over 1,000 flowing wells in Texas, and
adds “ tbeir vast capability and adaptibility for making secure agricul-
ture, always rendered uncertain under bigb temperature,lias not become
a matter of general understanding.” He further adds that in the
development of suck wells tbeir use for irrigation was not dreamed of
originally, but that now they are being widely utilized. It may not
perhaps be generally known that the celebrated fruit ranch of River-
side, San Bernardino Co., S. California, derives a portion of its water
supply from artesian wells, and which works are known as the “ Gage”
system. There are 12,000 acres under fruit, served by 38 artesian
wells. The success of this system has encouraged others, and there
is now in progress another undertaking of a similar nature known as
the Whittier system, located in the Upper San Gabriel Valley, Los
Angelos Co., comprising 14 artesian wells. The works consist of 11
miles of cement conduit, bottom width 4 feet for a distance of 9 miles,
and 6,200 feet of fluming on piles and trestles. In the San Luis
Valley there are 3,700 flowing wells. The Alamosa Town well in this
valley is described as the principal source for the 30 miles of irrigating
ditches within the corporate limits of Alamosa.
In Utah the artesian wells in the Salt Lake Valley were first used
for irrigation about eight years ago, since then the area of cultivation
has increased from 25 to 35 per cent.
To go nearer home, in Hawaii, on the margin of Pearl Harbour,
20,000 acres of rice and large areas of bananas are under irrigation
from artesian wells, in addition to which they provide power for
several large mills. The immense strides in Algeria are perhaps too
well-known to refer to. All these facts are distinct encouragement to
ns here, and it is marvellous that so little is being done by private
enterprise in this direction, and few recognise the immense value of
the water now being poured aimlessly on the thirsty soil of the
western districts.
The following return showing the extent of the opera-
tions from the inception of the contract system up to the present time,
will give some idea of the magnitude of the work. The bores are
directly reproductive to a certain extent, while the indirect benefit


accruing to State and community generally by enabling stock to
travel, and facilitating the carriage of stores and wool to the rail
centies and thence to the Metropolitan markets and the seaboard,
cannot be over-estimated.

Sydney and Principal Towns.
BY FRANK J. DONOHUF.
The four cities of San Francisco, Chicago, Melbourne, and Sydney
stand almost alone as examples of the rapid growth of towns of the
first rank under modern conditions. The cities of the old world are,
according to the general rule, the result of centuries of the peaceful or
turbulent aggregation of human atoms, of growth in wealth, and of
expansion to meet the circumstances of national and urban life. The
cities named have no such long-drawn-out record behind them. In
the historical sense it is but as yester-year since Captain Phillip pitched
his tents at the head of the Tank Stream under primeval trees, and as
yesterday since the new population and the new era came in with the
gold discovery. To-day Sydney ranks as the third city in the empire,
estimating on the basis of the annual rating value. It has a population
of about 400,000 in the city itself and the congeries of suburbs imme-
diately surrounding it, a total capitalised value of ratable property
amounting to over £109,000,000 sterling’, and over 70,000 houses and
business premises, covering an area of about 91,000 acres. When it
is stated that the annual rating value of metropolitan property stands
at upwards of £6,600,000, and is nearly three times as great as that
of Birmingham, almost twice as much as that of Liverpool or Man-
chester and Salford, and about £2,600,000 above that of Glasgow, some
definite evidence is given of the wealth and expansion of a city which
has onlv been incorporated since 1842.
t/ JL , _
Figures like these tell their own tale of progress and prosperity, and
it is as well to begin with such a definite starting-point as they suggest.
Although in point of population and wealth Sydney is not to be com-
pared with London, yet the visitor never fails to be struck with its
metropolitan air; and for the same reasons as in the case of the city
on the Thames, though, of course, on a reduced scale. The population
of Sydney bears an even more disproportionate relation to that of the
rest of the country. The city itself is given up to business, so that on
Sundays and after nightfall the closed warehouses and comparatively
silent streets of what by day are among the busiest quarters strikingly
recall “ the City ” eastward of St. PauFs. The population is out of town
in the spreading suburbs that fringe the harbour or the ocean beaches,
or stretch away beyond Botany or towards Parramatta and the distant
outlines of the Blue Mountains, or cluster along the highlands of the
northern railway-line. Here the people of the metropolis make their
homes, withdrawing more and more as time goes on from the city
proper. Like it, each suburb may be said to have its own municipal
establishment, controlling local affairs, and supervising the expenditure
of rates to the best interests of the suburbs and its residents. Hand-


TOWN HALL, SYDNEY.




some town halls bear evidence to the generally prosperous condition
of the municipal councils and to the stability of the institutions, and
at the head of these stands the monumental edifice of the Sydney T own
Hall, completed in the centennial year. Its great hall is one of the
largest in the world, covering a superficial area of 14,110 feet, the
length, breadth, and height being respectively 166 i, 85, and 65 feet.
The splendid proportions and 200-feet tower of the Town Hall ma e
it a conspicuous object in the centre of the city, and a fitting centre
for that municipal organisation which has dotted the face of New
South Wales with important and well-governed towns during the past
fifty years. Among other noticeable edifices which serve as the land-
marks of the city may be named the University and associated college
buildings, giving an old-world air to the scenes in which they are
appropriately placed; the two cathedrals, the palatial public offices of
the Colonial Secretary, Lands, and Works; the Post Office with its
tower of 250 feet and its splendid Italian facade of colonnaded granite
and sandstone 358 feet in length; the Museum, many of the banks,
insurance officers, and commercial buildings, and the Australia Hotel.
In certain parts of the city, as in Pitt-street, the way is lined with a
succession of these magnificent buildings, testifying at once to the
wealth of the metropolis and to its position as the great commercial
port of the continent.
The history of the growth of Sydney has been plainly written in its
oround-plan and in the direction of its streets. Here, again, we get
something of that distinctively old-world look which has struck so
many travelled observers as characteristic of this metropolis. It grew
up from year to year as settlement progressed, without much tore-
thought, and certainly without much deliberate plan. In the old
charts and views the outline of what is now George-street and the
main artery of the city may be traced as a winding bullock-track,
starting from the vicinity of Dawes Point or of what was once the
King’s Stores, and pursuing its sinuous way round obstacles and past
certain fixed points without any r
e & ai d vvhateve
directness. These general characteristics the great thoroughfare still
preserves, though its course is now marked by great buildings and the
most valuable business frontages in this part of the world. On tle
promontory that lies between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour still
survives a good deal of picturesque old Sydney, with its rocky cuttings,
its narrow streets rising by steep steps, and its quaintly old-fashione
houses, the whole reminding the observer in its general features more
of the appearance of the older parts of Naples than of what might be
expected in an Australasian city. The movement of progress is rapidly
clearing away these features, and assimilating this oldest quarter and
by-drift of the city to the conditions that rule everywhere else. Hut
even in the city itself the streets, which are sometimes narrow and
winding, have that picturesque and comfortable irregularity which never
fails to have a pleasing effect on the eye, while in the hot summer
months these peculiarities afford a grateful shade which the citizen
would sadly miss. The process of beautifying the city is continually
going on, not without regard to this accidental picturesqueness, thougi
the enormously increased value of street frontages is an obstacle in the
way. In some portions of the metropolis the casual observer might


almost tliink himself within a walled town like those of old Europe.,
when the streets had to be made narrow to accommodate house-room
for the population within the walls, and palaces and cathedrals were
almost concealed from view for lack of space to give a prospect, or by
the meaner buildings that crowded and shouldered them out of sight.
Palaces like those of theßorghese in Rome or theßiccardi in Florence are
lost in the narrow streets and crowded ways of the older parts of those
ancient cities, and it is not until one passes the portals and discovers
the broad, open courtyard within that any adequate idea is gained of
the impressive character of these edifices. But of the public buildings
of Sydney it may now be fairly said that they do not labour under
such disadvantages. Generous spaces have been cleared and reserved,
compared with which the Piazza Colonna at Rome or the Piazza della
Signoria at Florence cannot for a moment compete in point of space.
Few cities, too, are so well situated for architectural display and pictur-
esque street effects; and though these were not much regarded in the
early days when the capital was allowed to grow in its own haphazard
and careless fashion, we may take credit for having done something to
adapt onr public buildings to their surroundings so soon as the claims
of the subject made themselves felt. Our Post Office has been relieved
of the neighbouring buildings that cramped its effect, and the widening*
of Moore-street has given ns a central plaza of which any city might
be proud. The block of buildings in which the Town Hall and St.
Andrew’s Cathedral are comprised once had much to contend with;
but the removal of the police-station and the substitution of a splendid
building for the City Markets has done much to throw these architec-
tural monuments into relief. The new Hospital in Macquarie-street
has cast new light on the possibilities of that fine thoroughfare, as it
defines the crest-line of the hill between the city and the Domain.
Doubtless the day will come when the idea these possibilities sng'gest
will be carried out, and the noble sites of the present Sydney Mint
and Legislative Chambers will be occupied by edifices more worthy of
that position. An adequate House of Parliament —perhaps to accom-
modate a Federal Legislature —will be fittingly balanced by new Law
Courts at the other end of the street, and it would be difficult to
imagine a better site for this much-required building than is afforded
by the situation at the top of King-street, with the Domain on one side,
St. Mary’s Cathedral and Hyde Park on the other, overlooking the
Queen’s Square, and commanding the sunlit perspective of one of our
principal streets.
This prospect gives us one of the characteristic street views of a city
singularly rich in that and other elements of the picturesque. It
crowns and slopes from a succession of gentle hills, falling away city-
wards in one direction, or to one or other of the innumerable reaches
of the waters of the harbour on the other. Macquarie-street and
York-street define these higher outlines, and between them the business
streets of the city lead down to the Circular Quay. Such an arrange-
ment could not do otherwise than lend itself to picturesque street-
views. Sometimes the perspective of the street architecture closes in
round sunny glimpses of blue water, as when one looks down towards
Darling Harbour. Sometimes it is lost among the towering spars and
idle sails of a forest of shipping, as when the eye traverses Pitt-street


GEORGE-STREET, SYDNEY.




and sees the bows of tall merchantmen from all quarters of the globe
projecting across the very footway, so that passers-by walk under
them as they go to and fro about the city’s busy affairs. Sometimes
t frames a block of buildings like the Joint Stock Bank, or a quiet
church, or a space of green grass and trees in one of the public parks.
Looking 1 citywards from the Domain entrance at Bent-street, the view
is made up of massive buildings outlined against the sky; and as the
observer looks up Bridge-street from the Exchange, the trees and
public offices lead the eye until the view is closed by Government
House gates. From Flagstaff Hill, near the Observatory, the prospect
is of a different character. It takes us away from the city across the
near arm of the harbour to where the two rivers thread their silver
way among the trees towards the folded hills that bound the blue
horizon; just as from the corresponding elevation near Governor
Bourke’s statue the eye follows the windings of the harbour until they
reach the imposing water-g’ates of the Heads, seven miles away.
Perhaps no city in the world has a fairer outlook. For mile after
mile on either side the shore-line winds in and out in sweeping curves
round an endless succession of bays and small peninsulas, where green
lawns slope down to the waterside from pleasant residences, and where
the native trees grow up to the very houses of the city. The blue
water, sparkles in the sun as the morning mists rise and disclose new
vistas of beauty. Here and there a green islet breaks the expanse of
water, and the shins of war ride at anchor near at hand. From the
' Jl
Palace Garden the view is one not to be lightly paralleled. Just below
the eye falls on the mass of green of the Botanical G ardens, and then
on the bright waters of the bay, where the sunlight plays in silver
beyond the dead white of a gliding sail. Perhaps an ocean-liner is
going down the harbour, delivering* the first deliberate half-power
strokes of those that are to drive her round the world. On the
northern side the eye follows the sinuous coast-line, tracing its cool
bays and leafy shades until the point is reached which conceals the
entrance of Middle Harbour, another arm of Port Jackson with a
beauty all its own. The beaches curve against the blue like sickles
of white sand,” and all the added charm that long distances and
hidden mazes can give are here to enhance the attractiveness of the
harbour and beautify it. This much-lauded charm and beauty of
Sydney Harbour are unique in their way. Other places have beauty
and many have charm. The Bay of Naples is seen at its best at the
close of a summer evening from the Capri terraces some miles away.
The whole sweep of the bay is before the observer, from the tomb of
Yirgil at one side to Sorrento on the other. The soft sky, the rosy
air, the strange blue of the Mediterranean, the outline of distant
Yesuvitfs with its cloud-wreath of smoke vanishing lightly into the
dim azure, the castle of St. Elmo overlooking the town, the ruins of
the buried cities and of the pillars of Passtum near at hand, make up
a picture as enchanting by its beauty as it is fascinating by its historic
and classic interest. From the heights above Hongkong the windings
of the Ly-ee-Moon Pass, the harbour with its merchant fleets of all
nations, and the stretch of the China Sea behind dotted far and near
with the junks of Chinese fishermen, picturesque in the di; stance, and
deluding the eye and the fancy together with their suggestion of the


galleys of old romances, are scenic effects to be treasured in tlie travel-
ler's memory. The brilliant colour and tropical charm of the harbour of
Colombo ; the fairyland beauty of the Japanese Inland Sea when the
draped and pleated sails float down against the sunset or in the glow of
early morning; the blue seascape seen from the terraces of Monte Carlo,
like the picture-scene in an opera; and the port of Marseilles, with its
curious suggestion of certain aspects of Sydney Harbour —all these make
striking and memorable pictures. The harbour at Bio Janeiro is said
by those who have seen it to rival the waterway of Sydney, but cer-
tainly none of the others named, as the writer has seen them, can
pretend to excel it in purely natural beauty. It is, then, hardly much
matter for wonder if our people value their possession of this beautiful
natural advantage; or that we appear to strangers, as one of them has
told the world, almost as proud of our harbour as though we had
excavated its basin ourselves.
No description of Sydney would be complete without some reference
to the Botanic Gardens. Although the city grew up under some-
what haphazard conditions, the citizens have always been indebted to
the foresight of Governor Phillip in setting apart certain areas for
public reserves. Among these are Hyde Park and the Sydney Domain,
to which the Botanical Gardens adjoin. Had this precautionary measure
not been taken it is more than likely that, in the expansion of the
city, what are now valuable breathing spaces would have oeen over-
grown with streets and houses, and the population would have to go
much further afield for recreation than is the case now. The site of
the Gardens was originally occupied by farms, whence the name I arm
Cove. But this admirable position has for many years been devoted
to its present purpose, and the beauty of its situation, with its far-
extending water frontage, has been used to make of the Gardens as
beautiful and attractive a pleasure ground as may be found anywhere.
The immediate purpose of the Gardens is, of course, to serve as a place
for the collection of botanical specimens from all parts of the world;
but while this object is in all respects efficiently served, the Gardens
fulfil the further office oi a public park under the most perfect condi-
tions. Here tropical foliage, flowers and shrubs of all kinds, and
trees brought with sedulous care from their native regions in all
quarters of the globe, unite to give interest to the scene. Here are
cloistral walks and shady pleasaunces, and broad stretches of lawny
grass, and cool air-wafts from the bay to temper the summer heats
from which the citizen seeks refuge, setting the flowers astir and gently
touching to a pleasant murmur the leaves of grateful trees. There is
the green arbutus by whose like Horace loved to lie lazily extended in
the shade, while he crystallised the life and philosophy of his time
into the odes and epodes and satires he has left us. Here is a Spanish
cork-tree like those under which Cervantes or his Don Quixote may
have squeezed a wine-skin by a wayside of La Mancha. Here are
waving plumes of palms, like those that first made the islands of
the South Seas distinguishable above the sea-line to the eyes of early
Austral adventurers. Here are rustic bridges spanning pretty water-
courses, with the old sun-dial, and a sound of the voices of doves in
the air. The sunlight lies broadly across the lawny stretches of fresh
grass, and some way off an occasional marble figure gleams white in


the clear air against the cool green shadows beyond. From rustic
seats under shady trees one gets vistas of green distance framed in
leaves, or sharply cut off by a brown shaft that flowers out overhead
into a canopy of palm, or set aside from the rest bv the Japanesque
tracery of the reedy stems of far Eastern bamboos. ‘ All this suggests
a wonderful variety ; and it is claimed, indeed, for the Sydney Gardens
that they contain a larger variety of plants growing out of doors than
the famous collection at Kew, and probably the most complete in the
world. The curator, Mr. Charles Moore, has spent nearly fifty years
at his post, having been selected by Lord Grey in 1847. Durino- his
time most of the improvements have been made. The first harvest
was reaped on the farm here the year after the Colony was founded.
In 1816 it first received its present name, and vines and fruit-trees
weie cultivated up to about 1850. The Lower Gardens were reclaimed
ten years later, while the circular sea-wall dates from about 1865. A
complete botanical arrangement has been carried out in the Lower
Gardens. Among the other recreation reserves of the metropolis
may be named Moore Park, and the Centennial Park—a noble reserve
dedicated in 1888, to commemorate the centennial year of the Colour’s
progress. Not many miles southward from the city is the National
Park, where thousands of acres of woodland and river, with miles of
ocean frontage, were set aside for a people’s playground by Sir John
Robertson. For summer resorts the citizens have the highlands about
Katoomba and Bowral, where they can escape the moist heat of the
city during the most trying days of that season.
Suburban Sydney is a greater city outside the city proper. While
the strictly urban population was set down at the official enumeration
our >ears ago as 107,652, that of the suburbs amounts to 275,631.
lo south, west, and north the city is continually spreading, and
can show the rate at which the process is going on better than a coim
panson of the population returns at ten years’ interval. Thus, in 1881
while the population of the city proper was 100,152, or, practical! v'
much the same as it is now, the suburban population was only 120 832
and only half that number in 1871. In the last ten years, while the
urban population has been almost stationary, that of the suburbs has
considerably more than doubled itself. Instead of about 21,000 houses
these suburbs have now over 52,000, or about three times as many
inhabited buildings as the city. This rush of population out of the
city has, of course, given rise to a rapid increase in the value of sub-
uiban building allotments and residential areas. Many neighbourhoods
around Sydney, which a few years back were part of°the original
scrub or bush, are now the centres of flourishing boroughs, with
well laid out streets, extensive municipal works, and all the require-
ments of permanent settlement. Like all other “ booms,’’ the suburban
land boom overstepped due limits and had to correct itself in the
usual abrupt economic fashion. Inflated values receded to normal
figmes, building rates came back to reasonable charges, and suburban
lents weie lowered; but building operations and the process of expan-
sion went on more or less all the time. The working men’s suburbs
are the more populous. Some of them, like Balmain and Redfern
have over 20,000 inhabitants, the most populous of all being the
foimer with 20,£75. in the next flight come these with upwards of


17.000 inhabitants, which includes Paddington, Newtown, North
Sydney, the Glebe, and Leichhardt. Marrickville conies next with
upwards of 13,000; then Ashfield with 11,000; Petersham and Wool-
lahra with about 10,000 each; Waterloo and Waverley with about
8.000 ; Alexandra with 7,000 ; Burwood, Camperdown, and Pandwick,
with about 6,000 each; Macdonaldtown with 5,000; Rockdale and St.
Peter’s with about 4,000 each; Darlington, Hunter’s Hill, Hurstville,
Manly, Hyde, and Willoughby with 3,000; Botany, North Botany,
Concord, Canterbury, Enfield, and Kogarah, with 2,000 ; Drummoyne,
Five Dock, and Strathfield with upwards of 1,000 each; and Homebush
which still falls below that figure. Owing largely to municipal
activity in the older suburbs, the sanitary condition both of the city
and suburbs ranks high.
The principal towns of the colony in the order of population are
Newcastle with about 13,000 (though Broken Hill figures have reached
to nearly 20,000), Parramatta with about 12,000, Goulburn with about
11,000, Bathurst with 9,000, East and West Maitland together with
about 10,000, West Maitland alone being returned at over 7,000; Tam-
worth, Grafton, Wagga Wagga, and Dubbo, with 4,000; Armidale,
Bourke, Orange, and Wollongong, with 3,000; besides the mining
townships of Plattsburgh Wickham, Lithgow, &c. Of these Newcastle
is the oldest, dating in reality from the first coal workings thereabout
in the earliest years of the colony. The town and surrounding
boroughs had a population of 24,600 last year, while the district included
62,406 people. It is 62 miles from Sydney by sea and 102 miles by
rail, and is the centre of the northern coal trade. The port is the the
second in importance in New South Wales, and possesses a remarkable
breakwater extending from Nobby’s Head to the mainland. The city
is well laid out, with well paved streets, handsome municipal and rail-
way buildings, an excellent theatre, about ten churches, and an annual
rating value of £191,323. A good deal of manufacturing industry
goes on in and around Newcastle, including boot, cordial, biscuit, and
carriage factories, shipbuilding and fellmongering yards, a brewery,
foundries, and engineering establishments. Goulburn is 134 miles
south by rail from Sydney, its two cathedrals, churches, colleges, con-
vents, &c., give it the ecclesiastical air of a quiet English town, and
the post-office, court-house, and hospital are handsome public build-
ings. The ratable property is worth £82,222, and the surrounding
district is chiefly given up to farming. The town is pleasantly situated.
Bathurst is 145 miles west by rail from Sydney, crossing the Blue
Mountains en route. It is an important and progressive town, with
strikingly commodious post and telegraph offices, courthouse, and
town hall, a school of arts, hospital, two cathedrals, colleges, and
several other churches. The annual value of the ratable property is
£67,013, the district is agricultural and pastoral, with nearly 40,000
acres under cultivation, and the town possesses several manufactories.
Maitland is 120 miles north of Sydney by rail, on the Hunter River.
It has fine streets and handsome buildings, and is pleasantly situated
in the heart of rich agricultural country. Tamworth is 282 miles
north of Sydney by rail, and 183 from Newcastle. It has ratable
property worth £37,500. A fine town hall, several handsome churches,
some public halls and a theatre, and an exceptionally fine post and

distant 528 miles by rail, and 342 by sea, north-east from Sydney It
has ratable property worth £33,866, and is an important seaport on

Railways and Tramways.
BY R. L. NASH.
It may be that if the railways of this colony had at the outset been
designed to cover the mileage they do to-day, they would to some
extent have followed different routes. They have been put together
piecemeal like the railways of the United Kingdom ; but at any rate,
there is not the same unnecessary amount of duplication of routes as
is to be found in the Old Country; and although they have grown
perhaps less with a view to a symmetrical whole than as the progress
of settlement suggested, New South Wales is to-day possessed of a
very serviceable network converging upon the two great ports of
Sydney and Newcastle. The miles of Government line in opera-
tion on the 30th June, 1895, may be classified as under :
Costing’ on the average £12,396 per mile for construction, and
£2,068 for rolling stock, &c., or a total of £14,463 per mile.
These Government Railways are all constructed upon the 4 feet 8|
inches English gauge, and are substantially built. There are, in
addition, some private lines. That from Deniliquin to Moama, on
the River Murray, is 45 miles, and constructed on the Victorian
gauge of 5 feet 3 inches by a Melbourne company, and it feeds the
Victorian railway system. The Silverton steam tramways are 35|
miles in length, with a 3 feet 6 inches gauge, and connect Broken
Hill with the South Australian railways. There are, too, two small
branches, together 3| miles, on the standard gauge, so that, in all,
there are 2,615 J miles of railway in the colony, the capital cost of

which has amounted to £37,156,224. Both the Deniliquin and the
Silverton Companies earn good dividends, and it is to be regretted
that they are not under government control, especially as in course of
time there will be an extension of the western system across the Dar-
ling to Broken Hill, and a direct connection will thus be established
between the New South Wales and South Australian railways—a
connection which ought to be established.
Historical
The early history of railway construction in Hew South Wales
was one of slow progress. The 14 miles from Sydney to Parramatta
involved no great engineering difficulties, and it was at first proposed
that they should be constructed upon the 5 feet 3 inches gauge. But
the Sydney Bailway Company, to which the work was entrusted, in
1853 obtained power to alter the proposed gauge to its present
dimensions, and being in financial difficulties, the Government took
the work in hand, and it was opened on the 26th September, 1855,
together with the mile and a half connecting Bedfern with Darling’
Haibour. These aie the two costliest lines in the colony, averaging*
nearly £150,000 per mile, with the widening since effected/ Thu? the
fiiSu lines became State property, and it has been a clear advantage
that the whole system, with the exceptions of the short sections
named, has remained in the hands of the Government.
The earliest extensions, from Granville, near Parramatta, to Liver-
pool and Campbelltown (opened in 1856 and 1858) and from
Newcastle to Maitland (1857-8) were also works upon which the
gradients were comparatively light. But then, the problem of sur-
mounting the mountain ranges which approach the whole coast-line
of the colony, had to be faced, and it presented serious difficulties.
These ranges to the west of Sydney rise to the height of from 3000
to 4000 ieet and in the north and extreme south to yet higher alti-
tudes, and, although they tend materially to keep the climate of the
coastal region temperate in the summer months, to the railway
engineer they presented grave obstacles. They rise abruptly, and
although they were mostly surmounted during the 'sixties, many of
the gi adients were as steep as 1 in o 0 to 33, and the haulag’e power of
the engines was thus greatly reduced and the wear and tear much
increased. On the "Western and Southern lines the difficulties of the
mountain slopes on both sides were fully overcome by 1875, and then
thvv progress of extension became rapid. The line to Adbury con-
necting with the Victorian system was completed in 1881, and the
Murray Bridge was opened two years later. The branch of the
Southern line to Hay was opened in 1882, as well as that of the
Northern line to Narrabn. The prolongation of the "Western line
right through to Bourke on the Biver Darling was completed in 1885,
and the extension of the Northern line to Wallang’arra on the Queens-
land border at the commencement of 1888. In the next year the
costly, but essential, connection between Sydney and Newcastle was
finished, and Sydney was placed in direct communication by railway
with the two neighbouring colonies. In 1889 the branch of the
Southern line as far as Cooma was opened, and in 1893 the South


Coast line was finished as far as Nowra, and the branch of the
Western line to Forbes was also brought into operation. These are
the principal developments of the system ; but there are other
branches in operation, and in time the isolated Lismore line will have
to be connected with the Northern system, though it presents many
difficulties and will be a costly work.
Other extensions are in contemplation, but they are all of the “ light
railway ” character, as it is the present object of the Railway Admin-
istration to keep down any inflation of the capital account as much as
possible. Instead of an average of over £14,000 a mile, the purpose
is to construct agricultural and pastoral lines costing from £2,000 to
£3,000 per mile only, and of such a character will be the authorised
extension of the Northern branch from Narrabri to Moree. There is
also the proposed extension from Forbes to Condobolin, along the
course of the River Lachlan, and before many years are passed an ex-
tension of the Western system across the Darling to Broken Hill will
have to be undertaken. This important work, which will place Sydney
in direct communication with the South Australian system, should not
be carried too far to the northward if it is to intercept the wool and
other traffic now flowing southward to Melbourne and Adelaide. In
addition to which, it ought to be possible to obtain a substantial par-
ticipation in the carriage of Broken Hill ore to the coal and of coal
to Broken Hill, thus filling the trucks upon both journeys. But these
lines upon the Western plains will none of them involve much in the
nature of costly construction, with the exception of the crossing of the
Darling.
However, it is not the purpose of these pages to sketch out the
future of New South Wales extension.
The Appointment of Railway Commissioners.
The rapid opening of new lines prior to 1888, some of them con-
structed without sufficient regard to the prospects of an early remunera-
tive traffic, an excess of political influence, an unwise effort to keep
down working expenses by restricting renewals, and the need of more
harmonious and expert control, resulted in an undue waste of resources
and a certain amount of deterioration ; and it was found that while the
capital expenditure had nearly doubled, the net earnings had not in-
creased. Hence, it was determined to secure the best technical know-
ledge available in the United Kingdom, and to place the entire system
under the control of a responsible body of Railway Commissioners, as
far removed as possible from political influences. The Government
Railways Act of 1888 was duly passed, and Mr. E. M. G. Eddy, whose
services to the London and North-western, and Caledonian Railways
had been generally and warmly recognised, received the appointment
of Chief Commissioner. With him were associated Mr. Charles Oliver
and Mr. W. M. Fehon, and these three gentlemen have, during 1 the past
seven years, had the control of the completed railways. The respon-
sibility in respect to the construction of new lines still rests with the
Parliament, but even in that case a report is required from the Com-
missioners, and no new work has been authorised upon which they have
advised adversely.


THE TURNING OF THE TURF OF THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN RAILWAY, AT SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES, BY THE HON.
MRS. KEITH STEWART, DAUGHTER OF HIS EXCELLENCY SIR CHARLES AUGUSTUS FITZ-ROY, GOVERNOR &C., &C.,
JULY 3, 1850.
(From a painting at the time by John Rae, Esq.)




To the energetic reforms initiated by this body is largely due the
fact that at the present day the New South Wales railways are the
most efficiently maintained, the best managed, and the most profitable
o all the fetate Railway systems of Australasia. Of course. Railway
Commissioners, however efficient, cannot create a traffic which is not
available, or can only do so by a very slow process, and it may be
argued that New South Wales, as the richest colony, should possess
the most profitable railways. But that does not follow. The costly
nature of the works necessary to reach the wide interior, the extremely
neavy gradients on the mountains, the competition of the river and
waggon traffic in the direction of Victoria and South Australia, the
hunger shown by Victoria for traffic from New South Wales, which is
attracted by excessive reductions in through freights to Melbourne,
and the considerable concessions granted upon certain descriptions of
pro uce brought from the interior, even now make serious inroads upon
the net returns. Beyond these, the past fewyears have proved anything
3ut prosperous to the colony, and the Commissioners have consequently
lad to contend against a very remarkable reduction in the first-class
passenger tiaffic. Through it all they have steadily refused to be led
into any short-sighted policy of restricting repairs, renewals, and even
improvements at the expense of revenue, and the result is that now, in
tne race o± the depression, they have a permanent way, which for rails
ballasting, and maintenance in all respects, a rolling-stock, which for
power suitability and comfort, a system of signalling, which for
ie la 11 y wi l stand comparison with the admirably maintained rail-
ways of the Old Country. The Commissioners have aimed at reducing
rain mdeage as far as possible, by increasing the power of the engines
and the capacity of the carnages and waggons, and the power of the
express engines, weighing tons, apart from the tender, of the goods
Consolidation engines, weighing 62f tons, and the capacity of the
bogie waggons which can each deal with a load of 23 tons, are points
which, by men like myself who have studied the working of the rail-
ways of the United Kingdom and elsewhere, cannot fail to be viewed
with admiration Such rolling-stock can only be worked safely upon
a thoroughly reliable permanent way, and then it tells with great
advantage. In the United Kingdom there are, I believe, no locomo-
tives possessed of such power as the New South Wales Consolidation
engines.
■ But the Railway Commissioners have accomplished much more than
ns. ni e e other railways of Australia, rates of wages have not
been reduced since the financial depression set in. But the aim has
been to get the most profitable work out of each employee: and
w ereas in October 1888, when the Railway Commissioners took office
there were 11,393 hands employed upon miles of railway and
Liamway, in 1894 there were 1,042 fewer employed, although the
mes operated had increased by miles, so that the employees were
i Qo 3 Ce an avemge of 5 ' 3 per mile in 1888 to 4 per mile in
1694. fret they adequately dealt with a traffic which had increased
in the interval by £583,000 in money value, and by a larger pro-
per ion if tonnage and the numbers of passengers were taken into
consideration. While doing so, considerably more in the shape of
new materials have been put both into the permanent way and rolling-
s


stock. Savings have been effected in stores, and such a comparison

Comparisons sucli as this need comment. It is apparent that the
capital account has grown faster than the traffic, and distinctly faster
than the gioss revenue, The hulk or this increased expenditure on
capital account had been sanctioned in 1888, and there was, there-
fore, no means of arresting it. The prevailing depression has
doubtless restricted the expansion in the gross revenue ; but when
the comparison is carried further, it is found that, although the gross
revenue has increased nearly 7 per cent, less than the the
working expenses have increased nearly 30 per cent, less than the
capital, as an additional £583,080 has been earned at an increased
working cost of only £37,038 ; and thus £546,042 has been added to
the net profit, which has grown by per cent. It is to this keep-
ing down of the working charges that the increase in the net return
upon the capital bj- f- per cent, is attributable in a comparatively
adverse year, 1 J
How has this been accomplished ? Any restriction of renewals
though it might improve the net return for a year or two, would be
injurious and in the end costly, and it has already been shown that the
addition to the working expenses has, practically all of it, been incurred
upon renewals. But this is not all. Materials are much cheaper than
they were in 1888, and an extra charge of 19 per cent, for materials
put into permanent way in 1894-5 means nearly 50 per cent, in the
actual mateiials used. But those 50 per cent, more materials were
put into the permanent way at an actual reduction in the cost of
labour of 16 per cent., so that per unit of the staif employed some-
thing like 60 pei cent, more work was accomplished. This is apparently
substantial evidence that renewals and maintenance have not been
restricted.
We must, therefore, look elsewhere. In the earning* of per cent
more gross revenue, only 13. i per cent, extra train mileage has been
employed. It has already been indicated what has been the savino*in
the stores departments. Then, too, the general expenses, including


office, audit, telegraph, and other departments, have been reduced, and
more work is secured in all departments of the service. The increased
power of the rolling stock is also an important consideration. It will
be seen from the figures supplied that it does not do merely to count
engines and carriages and waggons. On the average, the power per
engine has been increased 15 J per cent, and their combined horse
power per cent. In the same way with the passenger carriages,
there is no increase in numbers, but there is an addition of over 35
ner cent, in the area for seating passengers. The goods waggons, too,
have been increased in numbers by 19J per cent., but their carrying
capacity has been augmented by as much as per cent.; and these
facts must be borne in mind when dealing with the power of these
railways to accommodate traffic.
Another consideration is the extent to which the steepest gradients
have already been reduced ; and the sharpest curves, a number of them
on the mountains of only 8 chains radius, have been widened. The
evidence taken in connection with the Locksley deviation just sanctioned
will show the great importance of this question. The Committee
reported
Near Locksley, which is situated on the Great Western Railway, between Tarana and
Brewongle, at a distance of 15 miles from Bathurst, there are grades of 1 in 33 and 1 in
40 against traffic going westward, and of 1 in 40 against loads conveyed eastward or
towards Sydney. These heavy grades materially interfere with an economical and
efficient working of the traffic. Train loads which are in excess of what a single goods
engine can draw over the grades have to be divided and hauled in sections, or taken over
by employing additional engine power. This entails considerable expense and loss of
time. If the proposed deviation be carried out, the grades will be improved to lin 55
in the case of traffic going westward, and to 1 in 80 in that of trains travelling eastward,
by which alteration the number of trucks drawn by the ordinary goods engine over this
portion of the Great Western Railway will be very largely increased, and traffic opera-
tions will proceed without interruption, and with greater economy. The committee are
informed that by the improvement of grades on various portions of the railways the Com-
missioners have up to the present time effected a saving in working expenses to the
estimated extent of £lOO,OOO per annum by an expenditure of £330,000. In the present
instance, with an expenditure of £47,500, it is estimated that the saving will be £3,332
a year, or 7 per cent, on the outlay. Taking the traffic of last year as a basis, the Out-
door Traffic Superintendent states that by means of the deviation 750 trains fewer than
now will run between Eskbank and Bathurst in the year, and in connection with these
750 trains there will be a saving of 2s. 6d, per train mile in running expenses. The Chief
Mechanical Engineer explains that when the Locksley grades are removed the line as far
as Dubbo will be practically clear of difficulty.
Altogether, a very large number of the steepest gradients on the
most important sections of tire trunk lines have been dealt with, and
the carrying capacity of the trains in many instances increased 50 per
cent, thereby. All these matters have conduced, and will in the future
yet further conduce, to the cheapening of operating charges.
The Traffic and its .
It must always be borne in mind that, though the control of the New
South Wales Railways now centres in the Commissioners, they are still
Government property, and are not worked solely with a view to profit.
The object that they must be a tangible assistance to the people is still

kept more prominently in view tlian Avould be tbe case were they in
private bands and tbe Commissioners were answerable to a body of
shareholders, whose principal concern was about their dividends. If
New South Wales Railways were worked solely with a view to profits, it
is more than probable that first-class passenger return tickets would be
based upon higher rates than fd. to |d. per mile (about half the average
English charge) ; a parcel weighing 1 cwt. would not be carried 50
miles for Is. 9d. ; a ton of hay would not be carried at considerably
under per mile ; nor a ton of grain or flour for less than fd. The
up-country farmer is encouraged/ 5 and it is doubtless well that he
should be, even at some loss to the railway earnings. Take the traffic
in the year 1894—5 as a basis for consideration: —
It is necessary to point out that wool and live stock are both long
distance traffic, averaging over 250 miles per ton ; that grain, flour,
hay, and general goods average about 150 miles per ton; whereas
coal is carried an average of less than 20 miles. This will explain
some apparent anomalies in the above table. Towards the total earn-
ings, goods, minerals, and live stock contribute 64.5 per cent., or not
very far short of two-thirds ; and that, as a whole, it is the most
profitable traffic may in a measure be judged by the earnings per train
mile. The wool traffic is specially profitable while it lasts, though it
has all to be brought over the mountains; but the agricultural traffic
is carried at exceptionally low rates, and is far from profitable to the
railways. There is, too, a special list for the encouragement of local
products ; and fruit and vegetables, manures* drain-pipes, timber and
a considerable number of other goods are thus dealt with. It will be
understood, therefore, that the system is hardly worked upon commer-
cial lines, especially as Members of Parliament and others are entitled
to free passes over all lines.

The Gradients.
But taking the system as it is, the Commissioners have set them-
selves the task of ascertaining how the traffic may be worked safely
and expeditiously at the lowest cost. They found that in 1888 they
had 631 miles of steep gradients, varying from 1 in 30 to 1 in 75.
Taking the successive gradients on each of the three trunk lines and
the Sydney and Newcastle connection, the following comparison is
presented ;
Thus., on the Northern line., in the course of 343 miles, there is, owing
to the mountainous nature of the country traversed, a total climb for
the engines to accomplish of 11,623 feet; on the Western line there
is a total climb of 9,188 feet in 247 miles ; and on the Southern line
of 9,183 feet in 287 miles, with nearly corresponding descents, and
what this means to the cost of working heavy traffic and in maintenance
must be something’ very great. An engine which can haul 750 tons
at 18 miles an hour up an incline of 1 in 150, can only deal with 250
tons at half that speed up an incline of 1 in 30, and it can therefore
be well understood how strenuous are the efforts of the Commissioners
to reduce the steepest gradients where possible. The accompanying*
diagram showing the gradients on the Western line will indicate the
nature of the country traversed.
The Position and Prospects.
In all this there has, perhaps, been rather too much of technicality
for a popular guide. But an effort has been made to show what are
the difficulties to contend against, and what progress has been made
in overcoming them. We must recollect that in stating the New
South Wales Bailway system has been profitable in the year 1894-5
to the extent of 3*6 per cent upon the capital outlay, the period of
depression recently passed through affords insufficient data as to the
prospects when trade, and consequently traffic, shall have revived, and
the earnings of the people shall have expanded. This tells upon all
railways; and upon adequately maintained lines like those under the
control of the New South Wales Railway Commissioners, is certain to
add to the earning power materially. Beyond which, settlement is
steadily extending in the interior, and the development of agriculture,
dairying, and mining, as well as of those branches of the pastoral
industry represented by frozen and chilled meat shipments, preserved
meats, tallow, and so forth, will inevitably, at an early period, add
greatly and increasingly to the traffic. Money can now be raised for
railway construction at hardly more than 3 per cent, interest, and
even upon the present rate of earnings, this means that a profit can be
earned over and above the cost of construction. The costly trunk
lines through the mountains are already here; and future extensions






through the plains to act as feeders to the parent system, will tend
materially to reduce the average cost per mile. There are the “ un-
profitable lines/’ which last year earned a net £120,219, while the
interest upon their capital was £459,422. But this bald statement is
hardly fair as it stands. The bulk of them fed the main arteries of
traffic, and contributed towards the earnings of the “ profitable ” lines ;
and there does not exist any railway system where there are not
isolated sections of which it may be said that they by themselves earn
the interest on their capital. Even the action taken to attract long
distance traffic to Sydney and Newcastle has in some instances told
against the earnings of some of these branches. For instance, grain
and agricultural produce is now carried 500 miles forlOs. Bd. per ton,
as against 255. Bd. in 1888 ; coke is carried the same distance at 235. Id.
per ton, as compared with 465. 4d. in 1888; and horses and cattle at
186 s. 3d. per truck, against 2235. 4d. Such reductions are a great
boon to the producer in the interior, and have served their purpose.
The time will come when the question of the duplication of the
trunk lines will have to be seriously considered. Since the Bailway
Commissioners came into office they have quadrupled the first 8| miles
out of Sydney, and increased the double lines from 72 to miles.
But there are still 2,368 J miles of single line, and on portions of the
trunk lines the traffic is very heavy. The easing of the gradients and
curves, which will permit of much heavier and longer trains being
run, will enable them to defer these costly duplications, by permitting
of the carriage of goods in longer trains and at higher speeds; but it
is evident that years hence, as traffic grows, this question will become
acute. However, that will mean that the traffic has outgrown the
present capacity of the trunk lines, and will consequently mean that
the cost will be repaid in increased earning power.
But the problems presented in working an important system of
railways like those of New South Wales are very numerous, and it is
impossible to deal with all of them in a short descriptive article. There
happily is the traffic, and a steadily growing traffic. In spite of
numerous concessions to producers, that traffic has yielded an addition
of £700,032 comparing 1895 with 1885, and £593,060 of those in-
creased earnings have been added to the net revenue; and when
prosperous seasons return, it is certain that a large power of expan-
sion, at present latent, will be developed.
The Tramways.
The Sydney and Suburban Tramway lines are likewise under the
direction and control of the Railway Commissioners. They are to a
large extent street railways worked by steam motors, and it is remark-
able that with so many gradients, such sharp curves, and crowded
streets there are so few accidents. Two lines, however, are worked
upon the cable system and one by electricity. There is also a short
tramway at Newcastle included in the service. In all, there are 61
miles in operation, upon which last year 66,352,069 penny fares were
collected, the tram mileage being 2,503,161 miles, and the gross
earning per tram mile 2s. 3d. A few years back these tramways were
not a profitable investment to the government, and in 1888 when


nearly 54,000,000 passenger fares were collected, tlie net earnings
were under 2 per cent, upon a capital cost of £877,244. The position is
now materially improved, and though the capital cost has up to the
30th June, 1895, been increased to £1,428,518, they last year earned a
net profit of sd. per tram mile, equal to 3'69 upon the capital. The
gross receipts were £282,316, working expenses £230,993, and net
profits £51,323.
Some of these tramways are not as yet profitable. The Ocean-street
cable line was excessively costly, and last year —the first during which
it was operated —it only earned 1*64 per cent, upon its capital. Two of
the outlying sections were operated at an absolute loss. Still, as the
Sydney lines worked by locomotives earned as much as 4‘62 per cent.,
the deficiency on the other sections was made good, and the average net
profit of over 3*58 per cent, may be said to cover the interest upon their
cost of construction. They now, in fact, return slightly more than the
railways upon their capital.
As already remarked, the majority are worked by steam motors,
which draw two, or three, and occasionally four cars, each capable of
seating 70 passengers, and that they are extensively patronised and
are a great boom to the people is evident from the number of fares
collected. They are worked upon the section, or “ zone” system, and
the great bulk of the fares paid are paid by penny tickets, two being
charged for the first section out of Sydney, and generally one for each
section afterwards, the average being about a penny a mile for each
full section. The tramway conductor is required to ring a bell-register
for each penny ticket received, and to tear the ticket in half before
the passenger, and though cash is taken, it is discouraged by making
the payment in cash heavier than that by ticket. Tramway tickets
are to be purchased all over Sydney, and many people will accept them
as small change, though not adapted for the purpose as they show
wear rapidly.
As in the railways, the great problem in the tramway service has
been to keep down working expenses. The lines were always well
patronised by the public, but not many years back the cost of working
absorbed nearly the whole of the receipts. The Railway Commissioners
have, however, succeeded in introducing many economies, and this has
in the main conduced to the increase in the earning power. Considera-
tion has recently been given to the question whether the tramways
could not be worked more cheaply by electricity. There are certain
great advantages in a stationary motive power, and there is the initial
cost of introducing a change of this description to be taken into calcu-
lation, and it must be conclusively shown that such a change would be
to the advantage of the revenue and the public before it is likely to
be adopted. But the evidence in favour of electricity is so strong —
the power being generated at one central point for distribution over
all the lines—that the prospect of the change is steadily growing.
The result will be a far more frequent service of lighter trams, one
which will suit the convenience of the public better, yet at the same
time one less costly to operate. And the cost of working has always
been the difficulty in connection with the Sydney Tramways.




GENERAL POST OFFICE, SYDNEY.


Postal and Telegraphic Service.
BY S. H. LAMBTON, Deputy Postmaster-General.
Perhaps in no Brandi of the Public Service have facilities been more
extended during the last decade than in the Postal and Telegraph De-
partments, nor the extensions more appreciated by the public. Little
over 5 years since the postage on letters to different parts of the
world beyond Australasia varied from Is. 6d. to 6d. the \ oz. The
action of the Australasian Colonies in joining the Universal Postal
Union in October, 1891, resulted, amongst other advantages, in secur-
ing a uniform rate to all parts of the world, of 2Jd. per U oz - letter.
The passing of an amended Postal Act in 1893 enabled the Depart-
ment to bring about many long-desired reforms. The principal of
these were an Inland Parcels Post and the Postal Note system, which
latter system enables persons to remit small sums —the notes being
negotiable at any official and many non-official Post Offices. The
success which followed the introduction of these measures is evidenced
by the fact that during the year 1894 the revenue from the Inland
parcels post was over £16,500, the number posted being 315,243 ;
whilst the revenue or poundage from postal notes nearly reached,
during the same period, the sum of £3,900.
In addition to the weekly mail service with India, Great Britain, and
other parts of the world, carried on with such praise-worthy regularity
and efficiency by the P. & 0. and Orient Companies at an annual sub-
sidy of £170,000 per annum (£95,000 being paid by the Imperial, and
£75,000 by the Australian Post Offices, the latter being apportioned
between the Colonies on the basis of population) we have a four-
weekly service between Sydney and San Francisco via Auckland,
carried on by the Union S.S. Company, and maintained, so far as
New South Wales is concerned, at almost a nominal cost —our contribu-
tion being* £4,000 a year, of which we are recouped by postages to the
extent of about £2,100. As the result of a Resolution of the Legisla-
tive Assembly in June, 1893, a calendar monthly service between
Sydney and Vancouver, carried on by Mr. James Huddart, was subsi-
dised for a period of three years to the extent of £lO,OOO a year.
£25,000 a year being contributed by Canada.
This line is, however, looked upon more as a means of promoting
commercial intercourse between Australia and the Great Dominion of
Canada, than as a necessary mail service.
The average time now occupied by contract on the Suez route,
between Sydney and London, is about thirty-four days, the quickest
time of transit having been thirty-two days. The average and the
quickest time in 1884, were thirty-nine and thirty-four days respec-
tively.

Newspapers printed in the Colony are carried free if posted w'lthin

weight. Postage is, however, charged at the rate of per 10 oz.
on newspapers addressed to the other Australasian Colonies, and Id.
for 4 oz. to places beyond.
The question of an inland and intercolonial, or at any rate of an
inland penny postage, is frequently brought prominently before the
public. It is thought by many, that a similar result would accrue
from such a reduction to that which followed the introduction of the
Rowland Hill penny postage system in 1840, namely, a large increase
of revenue. The conditions are, however, widely different. Great
Britain with a comparatively small territory had then a population of
some 17,000,000, whilst New South Wales with its vast territory to
serve with mail communication has at present a population of less than
1,500,000. Given a population of even a third of that of Great Britain
in 1840, and it is probable that the Government, fully alive as it is to
the great advantages of cheap postage, would no longer withhold this
great boon. The question, however, as in the case of other conces-
sions, is one of revenue. With a debit balance in the working of the
Department of some £123,000 a year, the matter of giving up of
revenue is one which needs serious consideration, and it is proved that
every reduction, whether in the postal or telegraph tariff, has resulted in
loss, owing, of course, to the comparative smallness of our population.
Several concessions have, however, been made. The Id. rate granted
many years ago to Sydney and its suburbs (but which, as in other
cases of reduced rates, produced a loss) has recently been adopted
between some of our principal towns and their suburbs, and the postage
on wholly printed matter has been reduced to |d. for the first 2 oz.,
New South Wales being the only colony in Australia which, up to the
present time, has conceded such a reduction as last mentioned.
The following figures will give some idea both of the present work
of the Post Office and of its progress during the last decade :
That useful adjunct of the Post Office —the Money Order Branch—■
continues to progress rapidly, although the postal note system, pre-
viously referred to, is found to somewhat interfere with its business, as
persons desirous of remitting small sums of £1 and under prefer doing
so by postal notes, which, like bank notes, are payable to bearer on
demand, whilst money orders are only payable on the actual
signature, after being required to give the name of the remitter.
* Excluding parcels which have been already referred to.


The number of money orders issued in 1894 was 431,417, the num-
ber in 1884 having been 305,883. The value of these was £1,315,637
in 1894 against £1,068,068 in 1884. The amount of revenue received
as commission on money orders was £15,827, against £12,794 in 1884.
The number of money order offices on 31st December, 1894, was 615.
The number on 31st December, 1884, was 431. Seven new offices
were opened during 1895, making the number on 31st December,
1895, 622.
The Government Savings Bank, which is worked in connection
with the Money Order Branch, is a most prosperous institution.
Interest is only allowed on deposits up to £2OO made by any one
depositor, and the confidence leposed by the public is strikingly
Shown by the fact that, although it was determined to reduce the rate
of interest from 4 per cent, to 3 per cent, from Ist October, 1894,
except in the case of moneys remaining to the credit of depositors
for the full period of twelve months from the Ist January each year,
the amount of deposits made during the three months following the
reduction was £538,702, against £521,465 during the three months
preceding such reduction.
The total number of deposits received in 1894 was 294,393 ; the
amount was £2,160,610, and the interest added to depositors’ accounts
was £120,880. The figures for 1884 were 156,578, £1,033,701 and
£43,198 respectively. The number of withdrawals in 1894 was
183,909, and the amount £1,880,854. The withdrawals in 1884 num-
bered 71,532, and the amount was £969,487.
The balance at credit of depositors on 31st December, 1894, was
£3,633,925, and the amount for 1884 was £1,290,931.
The average balance to the credit of each depositor on 31st De-
cember, 1894, was £29 11s. 10^d.; the amount on 31st December,
1884, was £25 2s. 3Jd.
Promptitude and general efficiency are essentials in all public estab-
lishments, but nowhere are they so much sought for and expected as
in the Electric Telegraph Branch.
This important department of the Post Office has considerably pro-
gressed during the last decade, although the large extension of the
telephone system to the suburbs of late years has, as was, of course,
anticipated, considerably cut into that portion of the telegraph busi-
ness. The total number of messages in 1894 was 2,035,108, against
1,934,000 in 1884 ; the revenue accruing to New South Wales in con-
nection therewith was £147,903 in 1894, against £138,599 in 1884.
But to the receipts for 1894 must be added the telephone revenue,
amounting to £20,298, as the figmres for 1884 include the very small
sum then received in connection with telephones, a branch of the
postal business which has, verily, increased by leaps and bounds
during the last few years.
Looking at the immense convenience which the telephone system
affords, the only regret is that its use cannot be still more widely ex-
tended, or, in other words, that the annual subscription cannot be
made so low as to enable the department to bring the estimable boon
within the reach of almost every householder. The matter, however,
like the question of reduced tariff in other directions, is one of re-
venue. It has been urged by the advocates of cheap telephones that


in some continental cities the charges are only about half what they
are here ; but these critics possibly forget that cheap labour and conse-
quent favourable conditions for cheap telephones exist at those places.
It is understood, however, that the present Postmaster-General, having
given very careful attention to this question, has decided that from
the Ist April next some concessions shall be made in the annual sum
—sufficient, at any rate, to induce a very large number of subscribers
to come in whose means do not enable them at present to do so.
Besides the Central Exchange, there are now twelve suburban and
five country exchanges. [The regulations in regard to the reduced
rates have since been issued, and are very liberal, varying l from one
third the present rates to one half. —Ed.]
During the year ended 31st December, 1895, no less than 467 new
subscribers joined, showing that even the present tariff is by no means
prohibitive. The total number of subscribers to the Telephone Ex-
changes of the Colony in December, 1895, was 2,902.
For the convenience of those who are not connected with the Tele-
phone Exchange, what are termed bureaus have been opened at the
head office and at fourteen suburban offices. These provide for per-
sons using the telephone for the purpose of conversation with friends
who are telephonically connected on payment of 6d. for every three
minutes to places not exceeding 3 miles distant, a higher charge being*
made for longer distances.
The telegraph and telephone system and management of this Colony
are admitted by travellers and other competent persons, to be equal
to anything of the kind to be found elsewhere.
The total length of the telegraph lines (not including telephones),
on 31st December, 1894, was 28,085 miles 2 chains, and the total cost
to that date was £831,470. The total length in 1884 was 18,681 miles,
and the cost £601,459.
The number of telegraph offices open on 31st December, 1894, was
813, and the number in 1884 was 394. The number opened during
1895 was 15, making the total number at 31st December, 1895, 828.
In view of the insular position of Australia, it is necessary to
maintain an efficient means of communication, by sub-marine cable,
with the outer world. To secure this has, for the past 20 years or
more, been a subject to which great consideration has been given, and
has necessarily resulted in a lai'ge expenditure. To the enterprise of
the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company are we mainly indebted for
the success which has attended the exertions made. When we recollect
the difficulties and failures which followed the earlier attempts, some
thirty-five years since, to lay sub-marine cables, across the Atlantic for
instance, we cannot but wonder, in glancing at a map of the world,
showing the existing network of cables, at the achievements of science
and enterprise in this direction.
Australia was first connected by a single cable, laid in 1872, between
Port Darwin and the Island of Java, by the Eastern Extension
Company. In 1879 a duplicate cable was laid, the company having
contracted to lay this cable and maintain it for a period of 20 years,
in consideration of an annual subsidy of £32,400, io which all the
Australian colonies (except Queensland) and, also, Tasmania, contri-
bute on the basis of population. These cables would, however, have


been of little use but for the enterprise of the South Australian
Government'in constructing a land line from Adelaide to Port Darwin,
a distance of 1,973 miles, at a cost of over half a million. Later on a
third cable was laid by the Eastern Extension Company from Roebuck
Bay, Western Australia, to Java.
The tariff for these cables was found so high (in the case of New
South Wales being 9s. 4d. per ordinary word, and 2s. Bd. per word
for press messages), that at a Conference of Postmasters-General, held
in Adelaide in 1890, negotiations were opened up with the company
with a view to substantial reductions. These negotiations resulted in
an agreement being' arrived at at a Conference held at Sydney in
March, 1891, for a reduction of the cable rate to 4s. per ordinary word
and Is. lOd. for press messages, the agreement providing that the
company would share a half of any loss of revenue consequent on the
reduction, the contributing' Colonies bearing the other half on the
basis of population, and South Australia herself and the other
Colonies agreeing, on the same basis, to make up the South Australian
territorial revenue to the same amount as previously.
The reduced rates came into operation on the Ist May, 1891, but
the financial results therefrom proved disastrous. During the first
year New South Wales had to pay under the guarantee a sum of no
less than £ll,OOO, in addition, of course, to its share of the subsidy,
which is about £lB,OOO per annum. A short Conference was accord-
ingly held at Melbourne in August, 1892, to consider the position, and
it was thereupon decided to raise the rate on ordinary messages to
4s. 9d. a word, and although even the higher rate produced a loss,
this has gradually lessened, and the year ended March last resulted in
no liability under the guarantee.
New Zealand and Tasmania are connected with Australia by sub-
marine cables, landing at Sydney and Melbourne respectively. In
connection with the first cable to New Zealand —laid in 1876 —a
subsidy of £7,500 per annum was paid by New Zealand and £2,500 by
New South Wales for ten years. This agreement terminated in 1886,
after which the subsidy ceased.
A duplicate cable was laid by the company from the terminal point in
Sydney —La Peronse —to the New Zealand terminus at Nelson in 1890.
As in the case of the European tariff, that to New Zealand was con-
sidered high, and was reduced in 1893 from 6s. to 2s. 6d. per 10 words,
the company agreeing to bear one-third of the loss. New Zealand one-
third, and the other contributing Colonies one-third, on the population
basis.
The Tasmanian cable is subsidised under agreement with Victoria to
the extent of £4,200 a year, the other Colonies sharing on the popula-
tion basis.
A cable was laid by a French Company in 1893 from Bundaberg, a
port in Queensland, to New Caledonia, in connection with which this
Colony guarantees £2,000 a year and Queensland alike sum.
The foregoing is a brief statement of the means by which Austra-
lasia is kept in touch by submarine cable with the rest of the world.
Low as the rates are thought to be to and from Australasia, it is
considered by many persons that the time has arrived for still further
cheapening them, and there is, moreover, a strong desire in many


quarters for a cable across tbe Pacific Ocean to Canada, wbicli will
enable Australian messages to pass solely tbrougb British territory. At
a Conference field at Ottawa in 1894 it was decided, witfi a view to ascer-
tain tfie cost, to invite tenders for laying a cable by various specified
routes between Australia and Vancouver. Several offers were received
in response, and tfie most satisfactory appears to fiave been from a
company or firm to lay tfie cable and maintain it for 3 years at a cost
of £1,500,000, and it is considered by many wfio strongly advocate
tins competing line, tfiat a cable tariff of 2s. a word —after allowing for
tfie increased business following sucfi a large reduction—would be a
payable one. At 2s. a word Pacific cable tariff would mean a through
rate from blew South Wales to Great Britain of about 3s. 2d. against
4s. lid. now charged, and about 2s. 6d. a word to Canada and tfie
United States, against sums varying from ss. lid. to 7s. 7d. as now
charged. Tfie present position of tfie matter is tfiat tfie Secretary of
State for tfie Colonies having recently proposed tfiat a Commission of
two approved delegates from Australasia, two from Canada, and two
from Great Britain shall meet in London and discuss tfie whole question
in all its bearings, a short Conference at which all tfie Australasian
Colonies were represented was field at Sydney in January. It was
decided tfiat tfie Agents-General for New South Wales and Victoria
should be nominated for appointment to represent Australasia on tfie
Commission, witfi instructions to confer on all important points witfi
tfie Agents-General of tfie other Colonies. Resolutions were also
passed indicating tfie route, and tfie basis on which tbe cost of tfie
work should be shared.
The total number of persons employed on 31st December, 1895, in
tfie various branches of tfie Post and Telegraph Department, exclud-
ing mail contractors, was 5,063, and the average annual salary was
nearly £B7 per annum.

PUBLIC WORKS OFFICE, SYDNEY.


Public Works, including Roads and Bridges.
J. W. HOLLIMAN, Department of Public Works, Sydney.
In tlie opening up and settlement of a new country sncli as Australia,
it will be readily seen tbat the construction of roads, bridges, and
like necessary works for tke use and benefit of the people generally,
forms a very important feature. As the country is gradually taken
up and settlement proceeds, the want of proper means of com-
munication for the purpose of enabling the settlers to reach markets
for their produce, and for social intercourse, is very strongly felt, and
as the settlers are not usually in a position to help themselves, it being
necessary that their whole time and available capital should be devoted
to their holdings, they naturally look to the central Government to
supply their wants in this respect. Indeed it is a generally recognised
principle that the construction of roads, except in the case of towns
where there is municipal government, and where they are required for
purely private purposes, is a national undertaking, and, therefore, the
duty is one properly devolving upon the Government. In the early
stages of settlement cleared tracks and roads of the most primitive
character are sufficient to meet requirements, but as the population
grows and traffic increases, it becomes necessary to improve them by
draining, proper grading, metalling the surface, and providing bridges
where required. Then, in the course of time, when towns spring up in
various centres, buildings must be provided for the transaction of
public business, such as Post-offices, Lands Offices, Court Houses, Police
Buildings, &c., and as the towns grow they require works for water
supply purposes, and for sewerage, and in these matters they look to
the central Government to assist them.
All works of this character come under the designation of u Public
Works/’ and the object of this article is to give some idea of what has
been done in Hew South Wales in the way of constructing public works
for the development of the Colony. The railways, which in Australia
are constructed by the Government, are perhaps the first in importance
amongst public works, but as they are dealt with in a separate article
there is no need to touch upon them here.
In the early days of the Colony, and indeed up to the era of respon-
sible Government, all matters in connection with road construction,
as well as other public works, were carried out under the direction of
officers in the Imperial Service, generally belonging to the Royal
Engineers, and many of the best roads in the Colony bear testimony
to their skill. Although much good work was done by the early
road-engineers, the real engineering history of the colony dates from
the formation of the Public Works Department in 1859, shortly after


tlie inanguration of responsible Government in the Colony. Since
tliat time tlie Government liave been actively eng’aged in improving
tlie roads already in existence, and opening new means of communi-
cation to meet tlie demands of tlie increasing population. As an
illustration of wliat lias been done, it may be pointed out that since
the year 1857, the large sum of £16,546,160, lias been expended on
road and bridge works alone. To give anything like an adequate
statement of the immense amount of road work that has been carried
out would be impossible in the limits of a short article like this, and
reference can, therefore, only be made to some of the most important
of them.
The Great Dividing Range which runs almost parallel with the
coast, with the spurs running out from its eastern and western slopes,
gives rise to formidable obstacles which have to be surmounted in
order to establish communication between the coastal districts and
interior. One of the earliest works of this nature which was under-
taken was the Western Road running over the Blue Mountains to
Bathurst. The difficulties of passing over the mountain range were
very great, but they were eventually overcome, and the road was
opened to Bathurst in 1815, convict labour being employed in its
construction. This road with some slight alterations from the route
originally selected, is still maintained as the main trunk road running
westward into the interior. As a main road proper it now extends to
Warren, a distance of 342 miles. The other main roads are the Main
Southern Road from Sydney to Albury, 365 miles; which is part of
the highway between the two capitals of Sydney and Melbourne, and
passes through some of the most important pastoral and agricultural
centres of the Colony, such as Goulburn, Wagga Wagga, Albury,
&c.; and the Main North Road running from Sydney through the
Hawkesbury and Wollombi districts, and giving access to the rich and
fertile districts of the Hunter River and Liverpool Plains, and thence
to the north and north-western parts of the Colony. A large amount
of money has been expended on these main arteries, and as roads
they would do credit to much older and more populous countries.
They are macadamised for nearly the whole of their lengths, and are
fully bridged, so that communication is always open. The southern
table-land of the Colony has been tapped at various points from the
coast. A road from Eden, Twofold Bay, gives access to the Monaro
district, and passing through Cooma and Kiandra (which is the highest
town in the Colony, being 4,640 feet above sea-level) leads to Tumnt
and Gundagai, where it strikes the Southern railway system. One of
the first roads to be constructed, however, in this direction was that
from Clyde River (Nelligen) ascending the tableland to Braidwood,
the centre of an important mining and agricultural district. It is
about 17 miles long, the mountain pass in side cuttings being 3 miles
long at a gradient of 1 in 12. This road abounds, as do all these
coast roads, in great natural beauties. From Moruya, situate about 85
miles north of Eden, there is another road giving access to Braidwood,
via Araluen, formerly the seat of a large gold industry. North of
this is the fertile district of Shoalhaven, the chief road from the
centre of which (Nowra) runs over the Cambewarra Range, crossing
the Kangaroo Yalley, and ascending the Barrengarry Mountain to the


HAMPDEN BRIDGE, WAGGA WAGGA.




tableland at Moss Yale, where it reaches the Main Southern Eoacl and
the Great Southern Railway. The work on this road was of the
heaviest character, the mountain passes being some 8 miles in length,
and it traverses a fertile country which not much more than twenty
years ago a horseman could hardly cross with safety in wet weather.
North of this there is also a good mail-coach road from Kiama to
Moss Yale, and at the northern end of the Illawarra district the most
important road of communication is that from the Great Southern
Railway at Gampbelltown, via Appin, one of the oldest farming
districts in the Colony, and the Bulli Pass. This pass, which was
constructed in 1867, is remarkable for its great natural attractions
and wonderful vegetation, and is consequently largely resorted to by
tourists, and those in search of the beautiful in nature. The grades
of this pass are somewhat severe, being as sharp as lin in places.
There is also a road from Sydney along the coast to these southern
districts called the South Coast Road, which is trafiicable by vehicles
fiom the metropolis to as far south as Twofold Bay. All the rivers
intervening are either bridged or provided with suitable ferry accom-
modation to carry over heavy loads.
Northward from Sydney one of the roads of most importance is
perhaps the North Coast Road, which starts at Hexham on the Hunter
River, and passing through Stroud, Taree, Manning River, Port Mac-
quarie, Kempsey, Macleay River, Bellingen, Grafton, and Lismore, is
available for traffic to Murwillumbah on the Queensland Border. It
is possible, therefore, to travel by road along the coast right from the
k ictorian to the Queensland Borders, a distance of about 800 miles.
As in the case of the Southern tableland, the Northern tableland
of the Colony, which, roughly speaking, extends from a little below
Tamworth to the Queensland Border, is connected with the coast at
various intervals. From Ballina, on the Richmond River, a road which
crosses the Clarence River at Tabulam, and passes through one of the
richest sub-tropical portions of the Colony, connects with Tenterfield.
As in the case of most of the roads running from the coast, inland,
very heavy work had to be carried out on the mountain passes*
the cuttings at Sandylands on this road being especially severe.
Xhe formation of the road from Grafton, an important shipping
place on the Clarence River, to Glen Innes, was commenced about
1863. This road, which is commonly known as the Newton Boyd, is
one of the largest works of its kind undertaken by the Public Works
Department. It consists generally of a series of long* heavy mountain
cuttings, one of the bluffs being so severe that the expedient of
tunnelling on a common road had to be resorted to. This road was
followed subsequently by similar roads from Grafton to Armidale,
Bellmgei to Aimidale, which taps the Don Dorngo Scrub, a district
of most wonderful fertility, and from Kempsey, on the Macleay River,
to Armidale, the work on the latter being particularly heavy, but the
giades have been made comparatively even and easy throug*hout.
Ai midale, the centre of the important New Fngland district, is,
therefore, connected by excellent roads with the coast at three places*
viz., Grafton, Bellinger, and Kempsey. Mention should also be made
of the road from Port Macquarie to the New England district, one of
the earliest connecting roads made with this district. In former
T


days, Port Macquarie was a shipping place of considerable importance,
as most of the wool and produce from blew England went there, but
the construction of the Great Northern Railway from Newcastle,
and the opening up of other shipping places on the coast, has robbed
it of most of its trade, and the extensive stores and buildings which
were formerly used are now falling into decay.
The roads as main highways for traffic from Sydney have to a
great extent been superseded by the railways, but for a large part
of the Colony they are still the sole means of communication, and
as feeders to the railway system they play a very important part.
In the interior a vast amount of work has been done in providing
oranch roads to the main arteries; roads between townships, and for
access to the railway system; and routes for stock purposes. On
many of these latter, in the dry parts of the far interior, a large sum
has been expended in providing tanks and wells for supplying water
to travelling stock, and during the past few years artesian bores have
been put down for the same purpose in some of the driest regions with
signal success.
0 win of to the nature of the soil, and the absence of suitable stone,
O ' n
the cost of road construction in some of the inland parts of the
Colony is exceedingly high, so much so that where there is any large
amount of traffic it is absolutely cheaper to construct light railways,
which, in some instances, has been done, and will no doubt be con-
tinued on a much more extensive scale in future years.
The bridges are constructed in a very substantial manner, timber
being used wherever possible. The Colony is fortunate in having an
almost unlimited supply of hardwood eminently suitable for bridge
work and structures of a like character. The ironbark which is
mostly used for the purpose has a tensile strength of about one-third
that of wrought-iron, whilst its durability may be gauged from the fact
that some bridges 50 years old are still carrying traffic, whilst numbers
of others, totally unprotected from the weather, have been built over
80 years. Of course the wearing portions such as the deck planking
have from time to time been renewed, but the original main members
are still doing duty. A photograph accompanying this article illus-
trates one of the largest timber bridges yet constructed, which has just
been completed over the Murrumbidgee at Wagga Wagga, at a cost
of £13,200, to replace a wooden structure built 34 years ago. It con-
sists of three 110-feet truss spans with 315 feet of timber approach
spans, the floor space per span being 3,165 feet. Apart from timber
bridges, some very fine structures of steel, iron, or composite iron and
timber have been erected where the importance of the traffic warrants
the expense. Space will not permit of reference being made to them
at length, but a brief mention of the most important will, perhaps, be
of interest.
The Parramatta Bridge over the river of that name, near Sydney,
opened in 1881, consists of five 150-feet independent wrought-iron
lattice girders, and a swing-span with two 60-feet clear openings.
The piers are constructed of wrought-iron cylinders, and the abut-
ments are of sandstone masonry. The Iron Cove Bridge, over one
of the arms of Sydney Harbour, was opened for traffic in 1882. It
is of the same general design as the Parramatta Bridge, but without a

swing-span. The total cost of these two bridges complete was
<£llo,ooo. The Lane Cove Bridge, also near Sydney, was opened in
1885, consists of five 60-feet spans, with a swing-span pivoted on one
abutment and having one 60-feet clear opening. The cost of this
bridge and approaches was £42,700. The bridge over the Shoalhaven
River at ISTowra, the centre of the Shoalhaven district, a very fine iron
structure, with eigdit truss spans, cost about £39,000, and was opened
about 14 years ago. At Manilla, an important district in the north-
west part of the Colony, an iron lattice girder bridge of five spans has
been erected over the Namoi River, the cost being £34,485. Bridges
of this type, but smaller, have also been constructed over the same
river at Gnnnedah, at Yellow Bank, and at Bingera. At Taemas, an
important crossing of the Murrnmbidgee River near Yass, a bridge of
the continuous girder type, 462 feet long, with cast-iron cylinders and
masonry abutments, was opened for traffic in 1888. At Buckley's
Crossing of the Snowy River, in the Monaro district, there is also
another bridge of this class. At Cowra, a handsome bridge has been
constructed over the Lachlan River at a cost of £26,540; the design
being composite steel and timber trusses on cylinder piers, and the
total length 1,040 feet.
Bridges have been constructed over the Murray and Barling’ Rivers
at various points, and to provide for the river traffic a design has been
adopted which, while it permits of navigation at all states of the river,
does not offer any obstruction in flood time as would be the case with
bridges having a swing-span. The design which has been used is a
steel lift bridge placed 5 feet clear of the maximum flood. Bridges of
this kind have been erected at Wentworth (an illustration of which
accompanies this article), and at Brewarrina, Bourke, Wilcannia,
Tocumwal, and Mulwala.
The whole of these works are carried out and maintained by the
Public Works Department direct, which has a most efficient staff of
engineers stationed at various parts of the country who are con-
trolled and directed from the administrative office in Sydney. The
mileage of roads at present, directly or indirectly, under the charge
of this Department, that is exclusive of the roads in towns under
municipal control, is 36,070, of which 11,979 miles are simply bush
tracks, and 24,091 miles are cleared, formed, or metalled roads.
There are 3,659 bridges in the Colony having a total length of over
50 miles, and 27,603 culverts on small bridges with a total length of
nearly 79 miles. For ferry purposes in connection with roads the
Government maintains 98 punts and 2 steam launches, 1 horse boat,
and 187 other boats. Most of the northern rivers are very wide, for
instance at Grafton, on the Clarence, where there is a steam ferry
service; the distance across is 32 chains, or nearly half-a-mile.
Although the maintenance of communication by means of roads and
bridges is no doubt of first importance to a large part of the Colony,
the keeping open of the navigation of the rivers is of equal import-
ance to those districts where the settlers depend upon the waterways
rather than upon roads. As is well known, the interior of Australia,
considering the extent of the territory, is singularly deficient in per-
manently navigable rivers. There are, however, several streams flowing
eastward into the Pacific Ocean at various intervals along the coast line,


the most important of which lie north of Sydney, viz. : the Hunter,
the Manning, the Hastings, the Macleay, the Clarence, the Richmond,
and the Tweed. These serve important agricultural districts, with a
considerable population, some of the very richest land in the Colony
being comprised within these river areas. It therefore becomes neces-
sary that the navigation should be kept open and improved, and the
Government is obliged to keep a large dredging plant for the purpose.
Much of this work is necessitated by the frequent floods to which these
rivers are subject, causing them to silt up. The plant employed com-
prises 8 sand pump dredges, 14 ladder dredges, 19 grab dredges, 24
tugs, and 76 silt punts, the capital value of the whole being £46/,600.
A*great deal of dredging work is also performed in Sydney and New-
castle harbours, both for the purpose of deepening, and in connection
with the reclamation of land. During the past few years sand pump
dredges of the Dutch and Yon Schmidt type have been adopted with
very great success, enabling much more work to be done at a greatly
reduced cost. During* the year 1892 one of these vessels, working at
Newcastle, lifted and put ashore 534,600 tons of sand at a cost of D4B4d.
per ton, which compares most favourably with the cost of similar work
in Europe.
One of the great drawbacks to the navigation of the coastal rivers
is the difficulty experienced with the entrances, owing to the shifting
and dangerous nature of the bars. The only permanent remedy for
this is the carrying out of costly works, which the extent of the trade
does not in many instances warrant, at present at any rate. At the
entrances to the Clarence and the Richmond, two of the most im-
portant rivers, improvement works are now in course of being carried
out in accordance with schemes proposed by the late Sir John Coode,
the eminent hydraulic engineer, who was commissioned by the
Government a few years ago to visit the Colony for the purpose.
These works are of a very extensive character, as will be gathered
from the fact that the estimated cost in the case of the Richmond
River is £326,000. The works at the entrance to the river were
commenced in June, 1889, and comprise the formation of a fixed
navigable channel from the bar, through the unstable portion of the
entrance to permanent deep water in the river, and the construction
of breakwaters for the purpose of creating a permanent and safe
entrance. Already a very satisfactory improvement has resulted from
the works so far carried out, and there is little doubt of the ultimate
entire success of the scheme. At the Clarence Heads the scheme is of
a somewhat similar character. Works are also in progress for forming
a permanent channel at the Tweed entrance.
Newcastle, which is situated at the entrance to the Hunter River,
and is the chief coal-shipping port of Australasia, furnishes a remark-
able example of what can be effected by judicious engineering skill.
Little more than twenty years ago it was a port shunned by foreign-
going ships as dangerous to enter, and without accommodation when
entered; it is now second only to Port Jackson in all its nautical
requirements. Yessels laden with 4,000 tons of coal, at a draught of
23 feet, can safely cross the bar, and the facilities for coal shipment
are such that 6,000,000 tons of coal can be shipped annually. Direct
shipments of wool are now made to England, and merchandise is

directly shipped in return. Steamers of over 1,000 tons burthen ply
from Sydney to Morpeth, the head of navigation, 30 miles from New-
castle. Still further improvements are about to be undertaken with
the object of permanently deepening the channel at the bar, and
thus permit of vessels of the largest tonnage to leave the port fully
laden.
At Trial Bay, a few miles to the north of Smoky Cape, a harbour of
refuge is in course of construction by means of convict labour. Apart
from the nature of the works itself, it is of considerable interest as an
object lesson in prison administration. When the Colonial Govern-
ment decided, in 1875, to construct this harbour of refuge, the
opportunity was taken by the then Comptroller-General of Prisons,
Mr. Harold Maclean, and the Engineer-in-Chief for Harbours and
Rivers, Mr. E. O. Moriarty, men of most humanitarian ideas, to
recommend the establishment of a Public Works Prison for the
purpose, where long-sentence prisoners could be provided with
employment under healthy conditions, which would train them to earn
a living on their release, and also give them the opportunity of earning
the means to start advantageously in their future career. The pro-
posal was adopted by the Government, and buildings were erected
at a cost of nearly £BO,OOO. The work has been for some years in
operation and has been perfectly successful, the breakwater having
been extended 520 feet, at a cost of £43,919 18s. sd. The treatment
accorded to the prisoners is of the most liberal kind. They are paid
wages of 6d., Is., and Is. 6d. per diem according to behaviour and the
time they have been on the works, and are given an amount of liberty
probably unparalleled in any other establishment of the kind. The
prison buildings are situated in a large reserve where the prisoners
are allowed to spend their leisure time in healthy recreation such as
cricket, fishing, swimming, &c. They do not wear the regulation
convict uniform, and are permitted to grow their beards; in fact,
beyond the presence of an occasional warder, there is very little about
the works to remind the observer of their penal character. The
prisoners are allowed to associate together for mess and other purposes,
and they can spend a certain portion of their earnings in tobacco and
other small luxuries. Every encouragement is given them to acquire
habits of self control and industry, and to fit them to become, when
their term has expired, decent law-abiding members of the community.
The wise and humane intentions of the Government in establishing
the prison on these lines are much to be commended, and it is therefore
satisfactory to know that it has been found successful.
At Sydney Harbour, owing to its magnificent natural facilities, very
little has been required to provide for shipping* beyond the construction
of wharfs at which ships can lie to discharge and load cargoes. Although
much work of this kind has been left to private enterprise, some of
the most important wharfs have been constructed by the Government,
which now yield a very considerable revenue. Amongst them are the
wharfs at the Circular Quay, formerly known as Sydney Cove, on the
shores of which the first settlement was made and the foundation laid
of the City of Sydney. Here, within a stone’s throw of the centre of
the town, lie the magnificent mail steamers of the Peninsular and
Oriental, the Orient, the Messageries Maritimes, and other lines.


Ample facilities exist in Sydney for docking large vessels and
repairing tire skips of war on tke station. At Cockatoo, one of tke
islands in tke harbour, is situated tke Government docking establisk-
ment and works. It consists of two large graving docks, one of wkick,
v ke Sntkerland Dock, completed a few years ago at a cost of nearly
£280,000, is one of tke largest single docks in tke world, and is capable
of receiving vessels drawing 32 feet of water.
At Wollongong and Kiama karbours kave been constructed for tke
convenience of tke skipping engaged in tke sontkern coal trade, and
Government wkarfs are to be found at all tke ckief centres of popula-
tion along tke rivers of tke Colony and at all ports witk a trade of any
importance.
Tke works wkick kave been referred to in tke preceding paragraphs,
although of vital interest to tke Colony as a whole, perhaps more par-
ticularly concern tke residents in the country districts. Amongst the
most important of tke public works of the Colony, however, so far as
magnitude of cost is concerned, and as affecting tke health and com-
fort of a large number of tke inhabitants, are those wkick kave been
constructed for tke Water Supply and Sewerage of tke City of Sydney.
To take first tke water supply. The works now in operation are
quite of recent construction. For many years tke supply was in tke
hands of tke City Corporation, and was obtained from the sandy
swamps lying between tke city and Botany. This, however, proving
quite inadequate to tke demands of the increasing population, tke
matter was taken in hand by tke Government, and after careful
consideration of various projects, a scheme was adopted known as
tke “Nepean scheme.” Tke source of supply is the Upper Nepean,
Cordeanx, and tke Cataract Fivers, wkick rise in tke mountain country
running parallel to tke coast; tke catchment area being 354 square
miles entirely in sandstone country. Tke water is intercepted at a
height of 637 feet above sea-level, and flows through a series of con-
duits wkick are partly tunnel, partly open canal, and in places wrougkt-
iron aqueducts, to tke Prospect Reservoir. This reservoir has a capacity
of nearly 11,000 million gallons, and when full covers an area of close
upon 2 square miles. The water after leaving this reservoir, is con-
ducted by an open canal 4| miles in length, to tke pipe head basin,
and thence by wrougkt-iron pipes, 6 feet in diameter, to tke Potts
Hill Reservoir wkick has a capacity of 100 million gallons. From
thence tke water is conveyed by pipes to tke various reservoirs for dis-
tribution. Tke supply to some of tke higher portions of Sydney and
suburbs requires to be pumped, but the greater part of tke supply is
by gravitation. Tke works were completed about tke end of 1887,
and kave been in every way successful. The water is of first class
quality, and tke supply is sufficient to meet tke requirements of a very
muck larger population than is at present dependent npon it. Tke
works are administered by a Board formed for tke purpose in 1688,
composed of four members elected by tke ratepayers, and three nomi-
nated by tke Government, which has an intimate concern in tke
matter as tke capital invested represents part of tke public debt
of tke Colony. The Board’s operations kave given every satisfac-
tion ; tke service is a splendid one, and the cost to tke ratepayers
comparatively low ) in fact in this matter Sydney stands out in


striking contrast to some of the cities of the old world. The last
leport of the Board shows that during 1894 the average consumption
of water was 34*23 gallons per estimated head of population per diem,
the average daily supply being 13,739,000 gallons, and the estimated
population supplied being 401,380. The revenue received was £161,167,
which, after providing for working expenses amounting to
enabled the Board to provide interest at the rate of 3*54 per cent, on
a capital of £3,440,614. The cheapness of the Sydney water supply
is very clearly brought out by a table prepared by the Board showing
the water rates and charges of some 01 the principal cities of .Australia,
England, and America. The assessment for a house of £6O annual
rental in Sydney would be, as shown by that table, £1 ss. In Adelaide
the same house would be charged £2 10s. ; in Belfast (Ireland) £2
Is. Bd. ; Dublin, £1 9s. 4d. ; Bradford (England) £3 os. ; Liverpool, £2
16s. 3d.; Manchester, £2 10s.; Dundee (Scotland) £2 14s. 2d.; Edin-
burgh, £1 11s. 3d.; while under the London Companies it would be
about £2 10s. In Boston (U.S.A.) the charge is low, viz., £1 os. 10d.,
but in Montreal (Canada) it is as high as £4 Bs. 6d.
Mention should also be made of the works which the Government
hav carried out for places outside Sydney Almost every town of any
size in the Colony now has its water supply. The scheme for the towns
embraced in what is called the Hunter River District, viz., Newcastle
and suburbs, East and West Maitland, and Morpeth, is a very
extensive one, and is managed by a Board constituted on the lines of
the Metropolitan Board. In the case of other towns the works have
been constructed by the Government, and then handed over for
admimsti ation to the local municipalities, who enter into an agree-
ment to repay the cost in a certain number of years. The benefits
which these towns derive from a constant water supply, situated as
many of them are, in the dry interior, cannot be over-estimated.
The Sydney sewerage system, in its present complete form, is of
comparatively recent date, the works having been only commenced
in 1880, and although so far as the city and immediate suburbs are
concerned, it has now been in operation for some years, the works for
the outlying suburbs, although well advanced, have not yet been
completed. Briefly described, the works consist of a main northern
outfall sewer which collects the sewage of the portion of Sydney and
subuibs which naturally drain into Rort Jackson, and discharges into
the Pacific Ocean at a point about 5 miles to the south of Sydney Heads.
The sewage of the southern district is collected into a separate system
and conveyed to a sewage farm on the shores of Botany Bay. The
scheme also comprises a system for the western suburbs, which also
discharges on to the sewage farm at Botany. In addition to the
extensive reticulation works in connection with the main scheme,
numeious stoimwater drams have been constructed where foul and
insanitary creeks formerly existed. The amount expended on these
works up to the end of 1894 was £1,745,120, the revenue received by
the Water and Sewerage Board, by which they are administered, was
£93,x34, the net interest on capital after paying working expenses?
being 3*72 per cent. The effect which the construction of these works
has had upon the health of Sydney has been most marked. In 1875
measles and scarlet fever proved so destructive to life that a Royal


Commission was appointed to suggest remedial measures, and indeed
it was as tlie outcome of their recommendations that the present system
was adopted. The result of the steps taken has been that in the city
proper, the death-rate, which in 1875 reached 31'65 per 1,000, has
rapidly fallen till, in 1894, it stood at 17'07 per 1,000. The suburban
rates are even more instructive than those for the city. From 1872 to
1885 the death-rate gradually rose till it reached 24*47 per 1,000. In
that year the southern outfall sewer was brought into operation,
followed by the northern outfall, and the reticulation of the eastern
and southern suburbs has been since gradually extended. The statistics
show that, although there has been since 1885 a more rapid propor-
tional increase in the population than at any previous period, the death-
rate has steadily fallen till it has reached 13*14 per 1,000.
In the matter of public buildings the people of the Colony, and
especially the capital, have every reason to be proud. Probably no city
for its age contains such a large number of stately buildings, showing
fewer lapses from good taste, as Sydney. Building stone of a first rate
quality —a fine sandstone —abounds in the neighbourhood, and as the
better class of buildings have been fortunately built of this stone, the
streets and public buildings present a more monumental appearance
than would otherwise have been obtained. The principal Government
offices in Sydney, notably the Colonial Secretary’s and Public Works
Office (an illustration of which is given), and the Lands Office are very
handsome edifices well worthy of the beautiful city in which they are
situated. The General Post Office, not very long completed, will
challenge comparison with any building of the kind elsewhere. It con-
tains a facade 363 feet long, of remarkable dignity, and a lofty clock
tower. Government House, which was erected half a century ago, is
a fine building of cut stone in the perpendicular Gothic style, charm-
ingly situated on the shores of the harbour. The Sydney University,
in the same style of architecture, though erected at a later date,
contains a Great Hall that, for architectural features and charm of
design, vies with the better known ones of Oxford and Cambridge.
The Parliament Houses, Courts of Justice, and the Boyal Mint are
very old buildings originally intended for other and more modest
purposes, and must, in course of time, be superseded by more elaborate
structures. In every township of any importance throughout the
country, commodious Court Houses, Lockups, Police Quarters, Post-
offices, and Public Schools have been erected, and, in certain centres,
extensive Gaols.
The Colony possess two very large and important Hospitals for the
Insane, namely, at Call an Park and Gladesville, the former having
cost upwards of £300,000 to construct —the latter is surrounded by
noted gardens. A third hospital of an extensive character is now
being erected at Kenmore, near Goulburn. In addition, there are
others at Parramatta and Rydalmere, and one at Newcastle for incur-
ables and idiots.
The total expenditure on new buildings since Responsible Govern-
ment was instituted in the Colony, exclusive of that on Public Schools,
amounts to over £8,000,000.
From the particulars which have been given a fair idea will, doubt-
less, have been gathered of the work which has been done by the


Government of New South AVales. It may appear somewhat striking*
to a person unacquainted with the Colony that much is done by the
central Government which, in other countries, is left to local autho-
rities; but the reason for this is apparent. The population of the
interior is so scattered, and so small in comparison with the immense
area more than half as large again as France by the way —that it is
impossible for the people themselves to carry out what local works are
i equiied, except in the townships. .All of these of any size have become
incorporated and carry out their own municipal works, in which, in
the early years of their existence, they are assisted by grants from the
Government. It has been the policy of the central authorities, who
desire to see the principle of local government extended as much as
possible, to encourage this spirit of “ self help ”; but from the very
ciicumstances of the case, it must be many years before the people of
the Colony can be in such a position as to be independent of the
Government in the matter of public works, and it is, therefore, satis-
factory to know that such excellent work has been done in the past,
and that, all things considered, the system at present in operation is
a good one, intelligently and efficiently carried out.


Our Social Conditions.
BY FRANK J. DONOHUE.
Although it is tlie custom to think and speak of tke mother-colony as
being rather more than one hundred years old, dating from the arrival
of Governor Phillip in 1788, it is much more accurate for the purposes
of the observer of the growth of our social state to reckon from at
least fifty years later. The year 1837 saw the departure of Sir Richard
Bourke, whose administration as Governor may be said to have prepared
the way for Australian social conditions as we now know them. But the
population of the continent at that time only numbered about 100,000,
and it was not until Bourke’s term that Mitchell's exploratory expedi-
tion made known the advantages for settlement of what is now the
Colony of Victoria. But the historian of the future will probably
prefer to reckon, and with more justice, from the year 1850, regarding
all that went before as an experiment on different lines altogether.
Then was ushered in the era of the modern population, separate
colonies, the gold discovery, and responsible The popu-
lation began to increase by leaps and bounds, and the spirit actuating
the community altered itself almost as completely as though a new
experiment in colonisation had been launched. The gold fever brought
us a new race —young, energetic, and full 01 the ambition of life and
the desire to make the most of its brilliant chances. We received the
incalculable benefit of a full stream of that adventurous pioneer spirit
of which Kipling has written in stirring verses, with the advantage
that the new-comers found a field ripe for settlement as well as for
adventure, and for the assimilation of those liberalising and popular
ideals of politics and social relations which have given the Australia
of to-day that breezy healthfulness which is the characteristic note
of the institutions we now enjoy.
This is not the place to sketch the history of the growth of these
institutions; but the steps by which they advanced may be briefly
indicated. The year before the date named saw the cessation of
transportation and the removal of that shadow on the colony’s future.
The gold discovery came in 1851 —in Wentworth’s well-worn phrase,
precipitating the colony into a nation. From the twilight of an
obscure antipodean settlement, the colony emerged into the day, and
riveted the attention of the world as a theatre of boundless possi-
bilities. The people who came were of the type that turns possibilities
into certainties, and one of the first results of the extraordinary influx
was shown in the determination to make the country politically fit to
live in. For years the community had been struggling feebly towards
self-government and the privileges of free citizens. The stages had
been gradual but slow. Now the object was attained almost in a


moment, and within five years of the time the stream of the new
population set in, responsible government was conceded in its present
full measure —though not without the temper of the past expressing
itself in a whimsical proposal to create a peerage with hereditary titles
and legislative privileges. The scheme was strangely out of" touch
with the new spirit. It developed a mood of antagonism that carried
the new movement, perhaps, even further than it might otherwise have
gone; and a few years saw the introduction of the principle of manhood
suffrage, the throwing open of the public lands to settlement before
survey, the abolition of State aid to religion, the establishment of a
popular system of education, and the base-course laid for the progress
of subsequent legislation. The population, which for the whole con-
tinent numbered less than 150,000 in 1844, stood at 197,168 for New
South Wales after the separation of Victoria in 1851, rose to 357,978
by 1861, and more than doubled itself in the course of the next twenty
years, while the census of 1891 showed a total of 1,165,300.
In considering the conditions under which our population lives, the
first fact to strike the observer’s attention is the decided preference
shown for town life. The characteristic is common to most countries;
but to people at a distance the circumstance is the more noticeable by
reason of an impression that the life of the colonies is largely a life of
u the bush,” the sheep-run, or the gold-field, or at least of the open
air. The average intending colonist does not usually correct this
impression until he arrives in New South V ales, while many of the
critics who write about us never seem to trouble about the facts of the
case at all. In the section in this volume dealing with the towns of
New South Wales, something is said on this point; and here we may
content ourselves with observing that out of the whole population
of the colony 691,956 are town-dwellers. It might be better if the
case were otherwise, and, indeed, a disposition has set in of late years
to devote more energy to the direct development of natural resources.
But the prosperous conditions of existence in the colony, and the rapid
advances in the command of the comforts and arts of life have had
a great deal to do with the inclination of the population to collect in
towns. When the country was new and just beginning to show its
possibilities there was a tendency to take up vast tracts of country for
the breeding of sheep, or to enter upon the active work of alluvial
Those who went out to open up the country risked their lives
at first in flood and drought, and at the hands of the aborigines; but
that stage passed away, the social conditions solidified themselves, and
people settled down to enjoy, the fruits of their prosperity. A large
population collected in Sydney, as well as.in the more important inland
centres, surrounding itself with the comforts and elegancies of life.
Taste began to assert itself; the University and schools of art and
nublic libraries came into being ; the desires and aspirations of leisure
oegan to make themselves felt; and the wants of the population made
employment. Wages, the attractions of towns, the facilities for the
education of children, soon drew the people away from the country
and settled them around the larger centres.
_ Under normal conditions the life lived in New South Wales in these
circumstances commands a high degree of comfort. The average of
personal expenditure on food and drink alone was higher last year,


although we suffered from tlie consequences of tlie depression, tlian
in any otlier country in tlie world. Outside .Australia tlie inhabitants
of the United Kingdom headed the list at a little over £l4 sterling
per annum per head, while France showed a little over £l2, Germany
nearly £ll, and Italy not much more than £6. In New South Wales
the rate stood at £l6 6s. per year, or 10*7d. per day. Something has
to be said, of course, for the difference in prices of provisions here and
in the older countries ; but if some articles are dearer, others, like
meat, are cheaper, and in this way the discrepancy has a tendency to
adjust itself. If the expenditure on mere luxuries can be taken as an
index to the comfortable conditions under which our population lives,
it may be mentioned that about one-fifth of the whole expenditure on
food is paid away for wines, spirits, or beer; but even these figures
do not represent the standard of expenditure before the wave of
depression passed over the colony. Three years ago the daily outlay,
for instance, was returned as nearly one-sixth more, or over 12d. per
day per head ] but even as things are to-day it is something to be
able to point to the fact that a population of a little over 1,000,000
souls spends upwards of £20,000,000 sterling annually on food and
drink alone. To the working-classes of Europe meat and tea are
luxuries, and often unattainable. In New South Wales more meat
is used than in any other part of the world, and twice as much
tea, except as reg’ards Russia. Our people spend more money on
tobacco per head than any other country except the United States,
Turkey, Holland, and Brazil, and more on intoxicants than any other
country. On clothing’ we spend at the rate per individual of pei
day, which is a fairly high average when it is recollected that only 40
per cent, of the population are to be reckoned as adult males. Last
year the total cost of living 1 for the population of the colony amounted
to something under £47,000,000 sterling. This sum includes not only
cost of food and clothiug, but rent, furniture, miscellaneous household
expenses, religion, amusements, literature, medical and personal attend-
ance, and so on. The average expenditure per head was, therefore,
£B7 14s. Id. per year, representing, of course, not the cost of living for
each adult male, but the outlay equally divided among all the units in
the community. LVhat this means wdl be understood when it is com-
pared with the average outlay in other countries. In the United King-
dom, for example, where the conditions of life are so prosperous as
compared with other European countries, the average, according to
Muliall, is as low as £29 14s. 9d. For France the rate is about £24,
Germany £2O, and the United States £B2. While the Englishman has
to work 127 days in the year to earn the cost of the food he consumes,
the Frenchman 132, the German 148, and the Italian 15b, the worker
in New South Wales has met that portion of his responsibility after
working only 119 days. .And this is not because he eats less than the
others. Quite the contrary is the case. The average Briton makes it
his boast that he can challenge the average unit of any other country
in respect of a generous food supply; but the figures show that the
brawn-and-muscle fed in New South Wales absorbs nourishment
sufficient to produce more than one-third more working energy than
the average dietary scale in the United Kingdom. Thus, where the
one consumes 278 tb. of meat in the year, the other is content with


109 IB; where the Briton is content with 19 18. of butter and cheese,
his Blood relation in Blew South Wales expects and receives 24 IB.;
/8 oz. of tea are contrasted with 148 oz. , 7o 18. of sugar with 91 IB.•
while the consumption of grain foods is about equal, standing at
378 18. and 380 18. respectively. Even in the United States, where
the conditions of life are said to be so easy, the meat consumption is
only 150 18. ; grain foods, 370 IB.: potatoes, 170 18., as against 205 18.
in .New South Wales; sugar, 53 IB.; and butter and cheese, 20 18. ;
while the annual consumption of meat per head in France is only 77 18. •
in Germany, 64 IB.; and in Italy, 26 18. These figures convey a fair
approximate idea of the material conditions under which our people
live, as compared with those of other countries. They eat and
drink and spend more, work less for the necessaries of existence, have
a larger share of food luxuries, and in a general way get more out of
life than the masses of any other country in the world. And the calcu-
lations that show this, it should be remembered, are based on observa-
tions made not_ during a period of abnormal inflation, or even of
average prosperity, but at a time when the colony was feeling* the
effect of an unexampled depression. s
There are no striking extremes of wealth and poverty in New South
Wales. Some large fortunes have been made, and against the solid
background of average comfort indicated by the facts just given there
is the usual poverty common to all larg*e communities. But we know
nothing of the pooi as a distinct class, and it has never been necessary
to adopt anything in the colony to correspond with the English Poor
Eaws. Much of the lelief g’lven to the sick and necessitous poor is
paid foi by voluntary subscription, but the State has g*enerously
endowed hospitals and asylums to the same end, spending annually in
this way something like £300,000. The system of State children's
lelief is undei the control of a board, which supervises the industrial
schools and reformatories as well as the scheme by which State children
aie boarded out in pnvate homes. The spirit in which this charitable
enterpiise is administered has the excellent social effect of withdrawing*
the young from those associations which would otherwise recruit the
ranks of pauperism and crime. But the conditions of life are so favour-
able that, generally speaking, it is only the very young, the aged, or
the infirm who require to be assisted by the State. Under normal
conditions the opportunities for employment are ample. There are
12*3 per cent, of the population owning property to the value of £lOO
and oyer, against 7 per cent, in the United Kingdom. Two years a°*o
the private property in Kew South Wales was equal to £336 per head,
the total value being upwards of £400,000,000 sterling, while the actual
sum divided per year as earnings was upwards of £66,000,000. These
figures compare favourably on a population basis with those of any
other part of the world.
So much, then, for the material side of our social conditions. It is
only to be expected that, as wealth and leisure increased, there would
come a taste for the graces and intellectual luxuries of life, and that
as the pioneer effort of the early stages of colonisation began to bear
fruit the population would find time for an interest in something else
besides the mere struggle to live. That we have arrived at that°stage
is perhaps attested by the fact that we spend over two and a half


millions sterling annually on such, matters as literature and art and
the drama, on private education as apart from the huge State expendi-
ture for this purpose, on public amusements, charities, and religion.
So far as the question of public education is concerned, it may be said
here that it is the object of the State to ensure that every child in the
land shall enjoy the advantage of sound primary instruction, and any-
thing above that standard is, as a general thing, paid for by those
who want it. Religion has no assistance from the State. But litera-
ture and art are subsidised by the establishment of free libraries, a
National Art Gallery, and a school of instruction, the expenditure on
which is not reckoned in the amount above quoted as spent by the
people themselves.
The interests of sport have always received active sympathy from
all classes. Beginning in the schools, the love of sport in its various
forms is carried through life, and through all classes. The Australian
race seems to have fully inherited the Anglo-Saxon characteristics in
this respect; and perhaps for the future of the race it is well that
this should be so. During many months of the year our climate is
likely to prove relaxing, if not enervating, if active habits of life are
not formed to counteract it. In the country the value of the agricul-
tural, pastoral, and mining life led there supplies this in a sufficient
degree; but in the towns and cities a tacit attempt is always going
on to engraft English habits of food, dress, and ordinary life on not
always suitable Australian circumstances. We eat the same meals and
wear the same clothes, as far as possible, as our cousins in England
do under far different conditions, and up to the present, in New South
Wales at all events, very little progress towards adaptation in these
respects has been made in the sense illustrated by British residents at
Calcutta, or the West Indies, or Hongkong. But what we want in
adaptation is made up for to a large extent by our active habits of out-
door sport. Our races at Eandwick are a national institution. Our
cricketers are as well known at Lords 5 , or The Oval, as they are on the
Sydney Association Ground. Our rowers, like Trickett, Rush, Laycock,
Stanbury, Beach, and Searle, have won fame at home and abroad as the
world’s champions. A bicycle tournament crowds the grounds with
tens of thousands of spectators, and we have lately seen a world’s
champion go from our shores leaving a leaf or two of his laurels
behind him. Our people spend a million sterling on art and amuse-
ment, and a goodly proportion of this is represented by the outlay on
sport. The moralist may find in this characteristic of ours a bad sign
for the future, and of course it is not entirely a good thing to find
Young Australia enthusiastic to the highest point of his buoyant
capacity on the subject of some form or other of sport, while he
remains comparatively indifferent to the attempt to form a literature
or cultivate the interests of art, and to the higher political interests of
the country in the public life of which its free institutions invite him
to take part. But everything comes in its place and time, and for
the present the chief concern is to preserve the type of the original
founders of the colony, and to secure the permanence of an active
and vigorous race not likely to succumb to the enervating influence
either of prosperous conditions or a semi-tropical climate. We have
the examples of other colonising races before us as a guide, and a


warning* of wliat is to be avoided. Tlie Dutch not quite three
centuries ag*o founded a colony at Batavia, which flourished and
enriched itself beyond anticipation for a time. But the records of the
settlement show how bad habits and an indolent life gradually
enfeebled the dominant race and prepared the way for the condition
of decay now found there. The Spaniard in South America, and the
Portuguese at Goa and Macao, established a brilliant record in the
sixteenth century ; but the staple and fibre of the race decayed, and
no one reading the history of their past would recognise a trace of
the old spiiit in their degenerate descendants. In Australia we are
protected against the danger of a mixed population, and the struggle
against primitive conditions has been too earnest in the past to leave
much time for decay. The danger will come, if ever, now that the
pioneer work is done and the people are settling down to the enjoy-
ment of those established conditions which the labours of the pioneers
have made for them. It will be for the active outdoor habits and
athletic pursuits of Australians to preserve the men and women of the
future fiom degenerating into the type of indolent creole or fibreless
mestizo which now remains as the only surviving testimony to the
colonising activity of other nations in other times. The moral force
required to leaven the growing civilisation and conditions of life in
these communities, far removed as we are from the influences of old-
world culture, are a love of music and art and an appreciation of
iterature. The signs of this are encouraging, as we have seen, and
it is well that a community which has witnessed so much material
progress has not neglected the finer graces of civilisation. To do so
is a peril of young commonwealths, but we cannot always be young,
and communities age as much by progress and development as by the
tale of years.
A glance at the resources on which the superstructure of these
social conditions has been built up will supply satisfactory evidences
as to their stability. We have passed through two or three excep-
tionally bad years, and for the moment the reproductive power of
these resources has been severely taxed. But they have more than
stood the strain which, beginning with the Baring scare, has left few
parts of the world entirely untouched. We have learnt to correct
some of our extravagances of living, and to recognise that the
phenomenal prosperity witnessed in New South Wales is not above
the incidence of those ordinary mischances which wait on prosperity
roundly speaking, of some sixty
millions, and we pay interest at the rate of about two millions and a
quarter a year. Our population spends upwards of forty-six millions
annually on the daily wants of- life. But against this we have public
works to the value of eighty-five millions, the railway system beino*
worth about forty millions of that sum. Last year our State services
cost us about eight and a half millions, while our gross revenue stood
a ■^ ia millions. We have sold and unsold public lands
ot which the proportion still unpaid for amounts to nearly twice the
total of our Public Debt; and from public works, rents, and fees
we draw about two - and three-quarter millions per year, bein°‘
about half a million more than our annual interest charge! The
resouices behind these figures are the pastoral, agricultural, and


mining industries. Tliese tlie reader will find properly treated in
tlieir respective places in tliis volume. Our millions of sheep and
cattle themselves produce an enormous return to the colony. The
wool clip of 1892 was sold for over ten millions sterling, and had the
price kept up to what it was nine years before the return would have
been nearer fifteen millions. A difference of a half-penny or a
farthing per lb. means a difference of thousands to the wool-grower
and to the colony, as the recent slight rise satisfactorily evidenced. The
developments of our frozen meat and dairy produce trade are still in
the future, but they indicate a field for the expansion of the pastoral
industry. The agricultural industry is mainly directed at present
towards the supplying of our own wants, but the prospective field may
be judged of from the fact that out of 196,000,000 acres within the
colony’s boundaries only 5,000,000 are set down as quite unfit for
cultivation. Irrigation and water conservation will lay these vast areas
under tribute as time goes on. In 1894 the dairy cattle alone were
worth two and a half millions to the colony, and the value of the returns
for the year reached nearly two millions. The mining industry has
already returned the colony upwards of one hundred millions sterling,
and in 1894 the return was a little under five millions. These facts are
mentioned here to show that the favourable conditions under which
the population of Hew South Wales lives are stable and progressive,
and not the result of accidental and passing circumstances.


Literature and Art.
BY FRANK HUTCHINSON.
Literature.
It is just a generation since Mr. Gr. B. Barton (himself no unworthy
worker in the local literary field), in a book published “by authority”
on this subject, lamented the slow growth of letters in this community
and the little promise of the creation here of what he called a “national
literature.” The complaint was doubtless a just one at the time, and
as natural inevitable, indeed, under the conditions of so youno- a
country; and the question to be considered here is how far may the
succeeding thirty years be said to have removed it.
The chief names then on the roll of our literary worthies were, in
piose, Deniehy and Dailey; in poetry, though at somewhat wider
interval, Harpur and Kendall. They are the chief names still. No
writer amongst us in either field has ever matched in range or bril-
lancy the former two, nor in truth to nature and real poetic power the
latter. Of Daniel Henry Deniehy, once the eloquent, the witty, the
eiudite, it lias been said that “ with few advantages in his favour he
contrived to make himself master of almost the whole field of Euro-
pean literature, to obtain a thorough insight into the various develop-
ments of art, and to qualify himself for the most marked displays of
talent, both as a politician and a man of letters.” Yet the literary
“Admirable Crichton” is now almost purely traditional.
With the exception of a few essays and sketches, journalistic waifs

Inm. It Ins lifelong friend, and, one might almost say, fellow-meteor
in politics and letters, William Bede Dailey, was more fortunate both
in is private and public relations, he has perhaps been even less so
in regard to his literary fate. To the present writer, who had the
pnvi ege of his close friendship for many happy years, he once con-
tided how tor an assured literary fame he would willingly exchange
a his political or other distinctions. Alas ! for that pious wish. His
literary fame is already little more than the merest memory—probably
to many of the present generation not even that. The great charm of
his writings, as of his speeches, lay in their exquisite ease and grace
—-their abounding wit and humour, the one as bright and sparkling as
the other was tender and true —unrivalled powers of ridicule and
sarcasm, tempered by the gentlest and most genial of natures. No
u


loving hand has yet gathered together the fragments that remain of
that rich feast, scattered through many of the papers and periodicals
of his time —-none perhaps now ever will. A project started shortly
after his death for some such monument to his memory appears to
have been abandoned, and the literary remains of perhaps the two
brightest intellects the country ever knew seem likely to be doomed
to rest together in that common gTave where lie so many more such
treasures —the deep sea of journalism, which so seldom gives up its
dead.
A happier fate has attended the two poets. Excellent posthumous
editions of both Harpur’s and Kendall 5 s poems, selected by careful
hands, have been published, and remain, as we said, so far as any
efforts of the local muse are concerned, unmatched. Possibly in some
quarters that may not be held very high praise. The local poet, like
the proverbial prophet, is apt to have little honor in his own country,
and outside criticism is often careless, or ignorant, or worse. Thus it
has been objected to Australian poetry generally that it is lacking in
the true poePs first faculty —the lyrical. “ Australia, 55 once remarked
a somewhat supercilious literary visitor, “ may have had a poet or
two 55 —and we have reason to know that he referred specially to one
of these two “ but she has no songs. 55 The antipodean curse of
scentless flowers and songless birds extends, it seems,
according to this authority, to her bards. They may be brilliant of colour
as the flaming waratah or the flashing parroquet, but, like them too,
they have sweetness neither of scent nor sound, for they cannot sing.
Whatever truth there maybe in this as regards Charles Harpur, whose
somewhat unkempt muse, it must be confessed, had often more depth
of meaning in her than music, it is certainly the stupidest of literary
libels in the case of Henry Kendall, who as poet was emphatically
sweet singer or nothing. Nor can it be said that the graciously accorded
possible “poet or two 55 is much a reproach to a young country, the
story of whose short life is surely marvellous enough without adding
the discovery of a rich mine of poetic wealth to its other wonders. On
the contrary, we are not sure whether, under all the circumstances, the
allowance is not even liberal. How many great poets does even the
old country, with its long bead-roll of “ mighty poets gone before 55
produce in a century ? and Australia is little more than a century old.
America is the nearest case in point, though, of course, with a vastly
larger field for poetic growths; yet with sweet singers and poets
innumerable, of great poets, poets of the first rank, America has pro-
duced not one. Here, with little or no past to inspire, save such a
past as all poetry and all prose might willingly let die ; with a rough
and ready present —not without its poetical side indeed, but as
against its practical prosaic opposite, a very small side —with only for
spring, 55 the mystery of a half-known, long-silent land, the
wild beauty of a yet semi-savage Nature, or such glimpses of a better
day as only the strongest poetic vision may catch through the haze,
often the thick fog, of much sordid surrounding, the wonder surely is,
less that Australia should have had only a “ poet or two, 55 than that
she should have had a poet at all. However, she has had much more
than that. Australian poets have much multiplied in the land since
the two we have named first discovered, like the old explorers her


physical, her poetic capabilities, and there is the further notable fact
that, though this paper is limited strictly to the literature of New
South Wales, it may yet include most of the Australian poetry at all
worthy of the name, of the period. If the mantle of Kendall, or even
of Harpur, can hardly be said to have yet fallen on any quite worthy
shoulders and it certainly cannot —it is at least not due to any lack of
plucky local aspirants. The names of Holdsworth and Heney, of
I arrell and Daley, and later of Paterson and Lawson, may well be
added to the list at any rate of our minor poets —and minor poets, it
may be noted, appear to be about as much as the gods just now are
vouchsafing in this way to mankind anywhere.
But if the four chief names mentioned must still be said to stand
first on our literary roll, that does not mean, of course, that in regard
10 literature generally the country itself has been standing still. On
the contrary, there has been, specially of late years, a marked, even
rapid, advance along the whole line —a further honor, perhaps, to
those lost leaders who so gallantly in darker days (if they were darker)
showed the way. It would be absurd, indeed, to count as literature
all the late local production in this sort. Only a very liberal con-
struction of the term, we are afraid, could be made to cover much of
it. But the effort has been there, if not altogether the accomplish-
ment, and so far, if only like the poet’s
Plants bred in darkness, striving upwards to the light,
shows the right tendency. Here may be mentioned, perhaps, Sir
Henry Parkes’s “ Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History,”
certainly the veteran’s best literary performance, his famous ff poems”
not excepted, whatever may be thought of it as authentic history. The
mother colony, however, has always been strong in history. The
works of her historians—Collins, Lang, Flanagan, Bennett, &c.—form
no inconsiderable part, either as to quantity or quality, of her literature,
and the great work—the “ History of New South Wales from the
Becords ’ some years since undertaken by the Grovernment, promises
very worthily to crown the series. Two volumes by Mr. C. B. Barton
and the late Mr. Britten respectively—it is only fair to the first-named
writer to say, of very unequal merit—have already been published;
but the work is now in abeyance, pending the completion of the com-
pilation of the records, themselves in course of publication from time
to time under the editorship of Mr. F. M. Bladen. Then, there has
ceitainly been some little literary revival in the newspaper press. We
clo not know, indeed, that the leading columns are more literary than
t ey were rather, perhaps, the other way—but the short story, the
essay, the sketch, seem to find more room there, and more attention
appeals to be given to reviews or notices of the best new books and
current literature. At the same time, it must be said that the advance
las been much more conspicuous in one direction than in another —in
the consumption of literature than in its production. This, of course,
is not surprising, the one being so much easier a process than the
other, and may be set down perhaps as one of the excellent results of
our State education system, which at least teaches everyone to read.
It is to the State, too, that the people are mainly indebted for the
means of indulging this new taste or faculty. TV hen Mr. Barton wrote.


there was not a free public library in the land. To-day, besides the
main institution in Sydney, rapidly becoming a noble one, there is
scarcely a country or suburban town of any consequence which does
not boast one, while the same writer’s estimate of other libraries, the
circulation of foreign periodicals, and the importation of books is
exceeded very many times over. It is only of the locally-produced
book or periodical that there is still to be told the old story of no
advance or uniform failure. The colonial book still requires in author
or publisher, perhaps both, the recklessness of the spendthrift or the
courage of a forlorn hope, and it is the melancholy fact that of the
many magazines and reviews which Sydney has produced in her time,
there has survived not one. She has been rather a prolific mother in
that sense, but, like the members of a “rickety” family, her unfortunate-
offspring have all gone the same way/
Their graves are green ;
They may be seen.
Yet many of them seemed sturdy, promising youngsters enough;
the latest, The Centennial, not the least so, which yet, after a brief but.
brave struggle against invincible destiny, shared the family fate. It
hardly accounts for this strange fatality to say that there is not here, for
magazine purposes, sufficient local talent, though possibly it may help to
do so to add that there is not here sufficient appreciation of the talent,
simply because it is local. He that as it may, it remains that the one
resource for the local literary man here is in daily or weekly journalism,
and it is fair to say that in most cases, or where there is real ability
or capacity for useful work, a very effective resource it is. But of
course there are forms of literary ability for which journalism, especi-
ally daily journalism, affords little or no scope. The daily paper, with
its heat and hurry, its little regard for manner and all for matter, may
indeed be rather the enemy of literature, especially in its higher forms,
but the weekly might do much for it, and some of our weekly journals
—notably the Bulletin, thereby covering a multitude of sins—have
already done yeoman’s service for local literature by thus encouraging
and developing local talent. It was there that such rising writers as
Louis Becke and Ernest Favenc, who, we are glad to see, are fast
making their mark in a wider field, as well as our latest and best bards
of the bush, Messrs. Paterson and Lawson, graduated, and it was in the
columns of a Sydney weekly, if we remember rightly, that Australia’s
best novelist, also a New South MYlshman, the author of Robbery under
Arms,” Rolf Boldrewood, made his first bid for the fame, if not fortune,
which has since come to him. Still it must be said that the literature
which has only, or mainly, to look to journalism as its support or
outlet, can have small chance of becoming in any true sense national.
We must wait, no doubt, for the day of larger things, for the larger
literature. Federation may bring us it, with all the other promised good;
time assuredly will, for we are of the best literary lineage the world
knows, or ever knew, and “ blood will tell.” With time, too, the local
literary field must inevitably widen, and it is not to be supposed that our
magnificent educational institutions, our University with its large staff
of learned professors (less often heard of now in this connection than
when their numbers were far fewer), our crowded and ever-crowding


colleges and high schools, will forever remain afflicted with the curse
of literary sterility. Meanwhile it is something to have to say, as it
fairly may be said, of the Mother of the Australias, that in the day of
small things, in every department of literature, she not only well holds
her own with the other colonies, but in the highest branches of all —
in history, poetry, fiction—like her own mother country, u in arms, in
arts, in song,” stands easily first and alone.
Art
If the pursuit of literature in a young country is attended with
many disadvantages, much more so, it might be thought, must be
that of art. Yet of the twin sisters in a strange land it can hardlv
_ # _ v / |/
be said that here art has fared the worse. Rather, very much the
better, one might be inclined to say, since she has at least a local
habitation and a name, to say nothing of other patronage, afforded
her by the State, and moreover —including here music and the drama—
may appeal more directly to the sympathies of the public. And very
well upon the whole, even taking the word “art” in its strictest sense,
has that appeal been responded to. If this paper were a history of,
or an essay upon, art, much might be said of its first faint beginnings
in this (then) “ country of rude dwellersof here and there some
solitary artist struggling vainly for existence, or preaching vainly his
gospel of art in the midst of an unbelieving generation; of here and
there some cultured connoisseur, or (more probably) collector of
pictures for pride or profit’s sake, throwing open his private gallery to
the public, and consciously or unconsciously helping to cultivate in
the community something of an art spirit. But it is not; its more
modest purpose is simply to state briefly the position of art amongst
us to-day, and what appear to be its prospects or its possibilities.
First, then, art has provided for her in Sydney a very convenient
temple of her own, in the National Art Gallery in the Domain. If
not outwardly a very magnificent shrine, —perhaps in this connection
“mean” would be the better word—it holds richest treasures, and
the worshippers are always many. By common consent it is the best of
all Australian art galleries, reflecting' the utmost credit on the manage-
ment, especially the late director, the late Mr. E. M. Montefiore, and
the present one, Mr. Du Faur, who have been the most capable and
indefatigable workers in its interests from the first. Here are to be
found many admirable specimens of the several British and Continental
schools of painting, with some fine statuary and other works of art,
while a special court is set apart for pictures by Australian artists.
These last are selected by the Trustees at the annual exhibitions of the
societies, of which, at present, there are two —the Art Society and the
Society of Artists —and it may be that in days to come this division of
the National Art Gallery will form its most valuable or interesting-
feature, as showing the various stages in the art-growth of what, it is
hoped, may yet be known to fame as the Australian school.
These field-days or weeks of the societies are, of course, the great art
events of the year, and we wish we could say always redounded as much
to the profit as they generally do to the credit of the artists. But while
the patronage of the State is strictly limited (the Trustees cannot exceed


a certain sum), the patronage of the public to any appreciable extent
has not yet come. In any case, especially in these depressed times,
art patrons are few, and when found there is still sometimes the pre-
judice which, irrespective of merit, prefers the foreign article to the
local, or perhaps refuses the latter at any price.
But that this prejudice is passing every succeeding art exhibition
seems to tell. There can be no question of the increasing public
interest in these shows, and doubtless with the coming of better times
a better day will dawn also for the artist. One thing may certainly
be said —that if he has need, as he assuredly has, for much genuine
enthusiasm for his art, there is ample proof that he has it and to
spare. Nothing less could have enabled our artists, during the last
few years, to accomplish so much excellent work under such unfavour-
able conditions. And the conscientiousness of their work is equal to
their own courage. It would be easy to give the names of individual
local artists who, in their respective lines, have little to fear from com-
parison with the best of their old-world compeers, as well as of some who,
greatly daring, have challenged and won recognition at high art svery
head-quarters. But we prefer to treat them here as a whole, and say
simply that no body of harder or honester workers than the artists of
New South Wales, reaping less adequate pecuniary return, probably
exists anywhere. True, the (( potboiler” is not altogether unknown
to them, any more than to their literary brethren. But man cannot
live by enthusiasm alone, any more than he can by bread, yet some
modicum of the latter at least he must have, if only to help him to
keep up the other. A visit, however, to the Australian Court, or to
any of the exhibitions, furnishes abundant evidence at once of the
enthusiasm and conscientiousness of our artists, and of their capacity
to catch and transfer to canvas much of the true spirit of a nature as
new almost to art as, till but the other day, so to say, art was to her.
Here, too, may be seen, faithfully depicted, types of the life and
character of a time passed, or fast passing, away, which, if not of any
particular loveliness in themselves, have yet their historic or other
interest, and here, too, the counterfeit presentments of some of this
young nation’s leaders, the great men who, according to their own
account, made or saved the country, as to some of whom at least it may
be an interesting question with Art Gallery visitors of the future,
whether they were not as much counterfeit as their presentments.
State aid to art, however, is not limited here to the National Art
Gallery or the periodical purchase of a few pictures. There is also a
subsidy of £5OO a year to the Art Society for the conduct of instruction
classes, with which, by the way, another state institution, the Technical
College, in its art classes is more than suspected of competing. It is
objected in the one case by the students, that the instruction given
is not commensurate with the cost, and in both, perhaps, not altogether
unfairly, by the taxpayer, that high art education is not the proper
business of the State. One is reminded here of the Irishman’s famous
definition of the fine arts —“ Music, paintin’, and the ladies” —and
substituting here for the a ladies ” the poets, it is asked why the
Doet and the musician, who, like the painter and the sculptor, must
he made as well as born, and are certainly not less necessary, should
not have equal advantages. Moreover, there is the general objection


that those advantages, though paid for by the many, are enjoyed
mainly by the few, and they for the most part people well able to
afford them. But without going* into that vexed question, it is clear
that the present system of divided control of art education is very
defective, and far from giving' the best results either to the pupils or
the public. They manage this matter much better in Victoria, where
the control is entirely in the hands of the Government, and the classes
are conducted in direct connection with the National Art Gallery.
There is also the excellent institution of travelling art scholarships,
whereby the exceptional talent of the country is enabled to complete
its education in the great art centres of the old world. True, the genius
thus assisted to wing its flight to fairer fields of art may seldom return;
but even so, that is not altogether a dead loss, since one of the condi-
tions of the assistance is the supply to the Colony of a picture or statue,
original and copied, while there must always be the satisfaction of
having served the cause of art. It will not be the least of this country’s
many obligations to the present Government should it carry out its
declared intention of shortly introducing a similar system here.
As to the possibilities of art in this country, they are, of course,
from the purely artistic point of view, simply limitless. As we said,
nature is new in this young land, and must have a thousand yet
undiscovered charms and mysteries for the discerning eyes which
lovingly study her. Why, we know a mountain in this country, Mount
Imlay, the mere study of whose fleeting frowns and smiles, lights and
shadows, might last an artist a lifetime. There are atmospheric effects
to be caught here that no Turner ever dared, or that only the poet who
sang of “ the light that never was on sea or land,” ever dreamt of.
Then there are the infinite diversities of country and climate, con-
sequently of scenery and surroundings, life and occupation, therefore
of character, of which the pages of this book so fully tell—all or
most of them new to art, fresh as from a creator to the artist’s hand.
But in truth the possibilities of art in this country, as in any, are
only to be limited by the capabilities of the artists, and in the present
case, even if we had the capacity, which we certainly have not, that is
far too delicate a question to be gone into here. It can only be hoped
that, if destined never to be more nearly matched than they appear
to be at present, at any rate they may never be less. There can be
no reason to suppose, however, that in the general march of the
Australias to nationhood Art here will not share, albeit she may keep
somewhat in the rear. With her, as with the minstrel of old, the way
may be long and the wind may be cold, but she has at least within
her the spirit of youth and daring, and ever ahead, beckoning her
onward,
Hope on the mountains,
Beautiful as morn.


Religious Institutions.
BY FRANK J. DONOHUE.
Owing to the series of peculiar circumstances influencing and forming
social conditions in the colonies, there is perhaps no country in the
world, not even excepting the United States, where a wider popular
sentiment of religious freedom exists with an equal absence of inherited
prejudice. Every church and creed is at liberty to pursue its work
with an utter absence of restriction, and at the same time without any
unduly favourable countenance or assistance on the part of the State.
Such a thing as a State church is unknown, and with the exception
of a small grant to a few ministers under certain special circum-
stances, to be noted in their place, each denomination is entirely self-
supporting and dependent on the voluntary contributions of its
members. The consequence of this is that the activity, the enterprise,
the successes and failures of each body, are its own ; and to this cause
perhaps, more than any other, is attributable the healthy and self-
reliant spirit which characterises church energy for the most part in
all the colonies. In a community which has grown up like ours, it is
not to be expected that the same conditions would exist as may be
found in an English cathedral town or a flourishing Nonconformist
centre. With us it is no uncommon sight in a small town to find
half-a-dozen churches of different denominations within almost a
stone’s throw of each other, the members of which are in hourly
contact during the week as they go about their respective businesses,
and unconsciously learning from each other the lesson that good
citizenship and personal character are independent of creed. We
have already seen how the gold-fields and other attractions of the
colonies drew immigrants by thousands from all classes and from all
parts. Naturally, they brought their prejudices with them, and it
would not be quite correct to say that these died out all at once. But
the process of elimination went surely on, and as the younger genera-
tions grew up together prejudice became weaker, so that by this time
any attempt to excite ill-feeling on that ground would be more likely
to provoke amusement than resentment. The way had been gradually
prepared for this state of things, as a rapid retrospect of the develop-
ment of our religious institutions will show.
Although there is no State church in New South Wales, the Church
of England takes a leading place both by numbers and influence.
For a time in the early days it was really the State Church, and the
circumstance has not been without its later advantages. But of course
the very earliest beginnings were in keeping with the surrounding
modest circumstances of the settlement. The first ships brought out
with them a chaplain in the person of Eichard Johnson, a Cambridge

graduate. For a while lie pursued his duties as best he might, the
first church-building we hear about being set up by him in 1793.
Service was first performed in that wattle-and-p. aster structure on
August 25th in that year, but Mr. Johnson subsequently became a
Moravian Methodist, and left the colony after about fourteen years’
stay. Next came a man whose name is even better known—Samuel
Marsden, son of a Yorkshire blacksmith, and for many years subse-
quently a magistrate and senior chaplain of the colony. He arrived
in 1794, and lived long enough to see Responsible Government
established in the country which he had known in such an humble
stag’e. The father of the present Dean Cowper came out under his
auspices in 1809. Fifteen years later Mr. Thomas Hobbes Scott,
who had been secretary to Mr. Bigge’s Commission, was appointed
archdeacon of the colony at a salary of £2,000 per annum, anc. at the
same time the Church and Schools Corporation was instituted by
letters patent. This instrument practically constituted the Church of
England the State Church, with rich endowments. One-seventh of
the lands of the whole continent, following the Canadian precedent,
was set aside for its maintenance, and until this great asset became
of value the denomination was allowed to draw upon the Government
funds by way of advance. The privilege appears to have been freely
used. The amount spent on Church of England expenses in 1828, for
instance, when the population was less than 37,000 and the adherents
of the Church about half that number, is set down at £22,000. When
Sir Richard Bourke arrived the objections to this outlay were brought
under his notice, and in 1833 that Governor in a despatch to Lord
Stanley laid down certain lines of administration, in the spirit if not
in the exact letter of which the question has been viewed ever since.
He dwelt on the duty of the State to encourage religion in the interests
of public order, and urged that the Churches should be assisted from
State funds in proportion to the numbers of their adherents. He,
therefore, recommended that instead of confining the payments to the
Church of England arrangements of a similar character should be
made with the Roman Catholic Church and Presbyterian bodies, as
the next in numbers, and provision left to meet the case of any other
denominations afterwards making a claim. The suggestion was adopted
and continued in force until State aid was abolished altogether—about
a generation later. Meanwhile, the aifairs of the leading denomina-
tion continued to flourish. The Governor laid the foundation stone
of St. Andrew’s Cathedral in 1837. The first Australian bishop (Dr.
Broughton) was consecrated in 1834, and Dr. Perry and Dr. Tyrrell
took the episcopal charge of Melbourne and Newcastle respectively
in 1847. Bishop Selwyn of Auckland and Bishop Short of Adelaide
belong to the same year, while Dr. Nixon of Tasmania dates back to
1842. Perth and Lyttleton were constituted diocese in 1850, Brisbane
in 1859, and since that year the record of modern growth has been a
full one.
The Roman Catholic record begins with the chaplain of the French
expedition under La Perouse, who was buried at Botany Bay while the
First Fleet lay at anchor in Port Jackson. But the first clergymen of
that denomination who actually followed the duties of their calling were
the Reverends Harold, O’Neil, and Dixon, transported for complicity in


tlie Irish, political troubles of 1798. The first public service was held
by permission of the Governor in 1803, and the first ecclesiastically-
authorised clergyman, Archpriest O’Flynn, arrived in 1817, was sent
back as having no official authorisation; but two accredited and salaried
chaplains were then sent to take his place. Such men as Therry,
Conolly, Ullathorne (late Bishop of Birmingham, who recently wrote an
interesting book of early Australian reminiscences), and McEncroe fol-
lowed, and in 1835 Dr. Folding arrived as Vicar-Apostolic. Seven years
later he was appointed Archbishop of Sydney, and his assumption of
the title called forth from Dr. Broughton a public protest on behalf
of himself and his successors and of the Archbishop of Canterbury, in
which any act of episcopal authority ou the part of any one claiming
to derive a right from the Bishop of Rome was formally dissented
from. St. Mary’s Cathedral was consecrated in 183 G, eight vears later
the see of Adelaide was constituted, Hobart in 1842, Perth in 1845,
Melbourne in 1848, Brisbane in 1859, and Dunedin in 1869. The
changes made in the administration of church funds in 1835 largely
assisted the work and expansion of this denomination. Churches and
schools were built as opportunity offered, and the work of the organ-
isation was carried out with energy. The insignificant beginnings
were lost sight of as time went on, and when the stream of immigra-
tion began to set in this and other bodies began to augment in num-
bers in such a way as to bring them more nearly in line with the
leading denomination.
The Presbyterian Church was the most active of these. It owes to the
zealous advocacy of Dr. Lang, whose services in the cause of religious
freedom and equality benefited all the denominations, most of its early
success and organisation. The first Presbyterian churchbuilding erected
in the colony was opened by James Mein, at Portland Head, Hawkes-
bury, in 1809. Twelve immigrant Scotch families, who had brought
their affection for the kirk with them, subscribed the necessary funds
independently of State aid. John Dunmore Lang did not arrive until
1823, and at that time most of the work of organisation yet remained to
be done. But by the following year he had made such an impression
that Governor Brisbane was called on to lav the foundation stone of the
(/
first Scots’ Church in Sydney, which still stands on Church Hill as an
interesting memorial of its first minister and of the early days of the city.
For many years the record of Dr. Langes career was the history of his
denomination. Pie was largely instrumental in bringing about the state
of public feeling which led to Bourke’s despatch. In every part of the
settled districts he made his presence familiar and his energetic influence
felt, from Hobart Town, in Tasmania, to the little community at More-
ton Bay that pioneered the present capital of Queensland. He made
several voyages to Scotland at a time when an expedition of that kind
was by no means the pleasure excursion it now is, bringing out with
him immigrants and clergymen of his own faith. Among the former
were the sixty colonists known as the “ Scotch mechanics,” whose
labours left their traces for long afterwards on the growing city. He
founded the Scots’ College and schools for primary teaching, always
looking into the future and preparing for the developments which
his acute intelligence foresaw were to come. Between 1847 and 1849
six of his ships brought out thousands of his countrymen, whom he


settled at Port Phillip and Moreton Bay. In the books which he
wrote, historical and otherwise, he has left ns graphic accounts of
the progress of his own denomination, its local divisions in 1842, and
the General Union which brought it together again in 1865. An
active colleague of his early days was the Bev. J. McGarvie, who
arrived in 1826, while the first Victorian minister, the Bev. J. Forbes,
went to Port Phillip in 1838. From Sydney as a centre the evangel-
ising operations of the body went on actively in the New Hebrides,
where the names of Paton and Steel made themselves in a sense house-
hold words.
The Wesleyan Church dates from 1812, when there is a record of
the first class-meeting. The first minister was the Bev. Samuel Leigh,
who arrived three years later, and the first chapel was opened at
Parramatta, in Macquarie-street, in 1821. Among other well-known
names were those of John Williams, who is recorded as having preached
an anniversary sermon in 1822 ; Balph Mansfield, who went to Hobart
Town in 1823; Schofield, who came to Sydney in 1835 ; and J. B.
Waterhouse, who came as General Superintendent of Wesleyan
Missions in the South Seas in 1838. The Centenary Chapel in
York-street, the local centre of the denomination, dates from 1840,
and the Bev. W. B. Boyce —another honored name in the annals
of the denomination —arrived in 1846. These facts and dates may
be looked upon as indicating the historical outlines of Wesleyan
progress.
The story of Congregationalism begins with the pastorate of Mr.
Cover in 1798, though the first settled pastor, the Bev. Mr. Jarrett,
did not arrive until 1834. The first chapel in Pitt-street, then and
since the centre of the denominational life and organisation, had been
opened in the previous year. The year 1839 saw the arrival in Tas-
mania of one who became later on a well-known figure in this colony
and a forcible writer on public questions, in the person of the Bev.
John West. The present Pitt-street Congregational Church was built
as it now stands in 1846. The firs! Baptist Chapel in Sydney was
opened in 1835 by the Bev. Wm. Saunders, who arrived the year
before. The Jewish Synagogue was first built in York-street, in 1844,
the Bev. M. Bintel being rabbi, and the present handsome edifice in
Elizabeth-street was opened by the Bev. A. B. Davis in 1878. Besides
the denominations given, other bodies held services from the earliest
days, but without any elaborate attempt at organisation on the larger
scale.
Turning’ now to the present position and evidences of denomina-
tional activity in Uew T South Wales, we find both attested by the signs
of progress and vitality that on all sides meet the eye. It has been
said that the Australian temperament is not on the whole remarkable
for susceptibility to religious influences, but like most other generali-
sations the statement is a little vague. If it means that the growing
generations do not exhibit much inclination to take up the work of
Hie ministry in the different Churches, the statement has probably
more than a grain of truth in it. The fact is that the work of the
Churches does not offer many inducements to Young Australia. It
supposes, to begin with, a certain amount of training,—more now, it
should be said, and as the years go on, than in the past. The same


amount of study and preparation would fit young men for professional
or commercial life, where the emoluments are so much greater and the
prospect of comfortable domestic life is more assured. The average
stipends of clergymen hardly guarantee this, and since the payment
is contingent on public interest or good will, or the personal popu-
larity of the minister, the element of uncertainty and dependence
about it is not alluring to the self-helpful young Australian. And
then, if the critic finds the general temperament lacking in religious
enthusiasm, a question is invited as to how far that enthusiasm finds
itself encouraged. Have the Churches since they were thrown on their
own resources by the withdrawal of State aid developed sufficient
attractive power of their own to make their influence personally felt ?
It has been said that the education of the average Australian clergy-
man as compared with his fellows in other places left something to be
desired, that services lack attractiveness, and that church organisa-
tion is wanting in that element of effectiveness which is necessary to
make it part of the life of the people. How far their assertions are
true may be judged to some extent by the progress and present posi-
tion of the various denominations. Certainly, the colonies labour
under the disadvantage of being comparatively new. Bourget, in
remarking upon this subject in the United States, has something to
say about the modernness of it all, —its buildings, its traditions, its
methods, and its associations. His remarks apply to us. We have no
venerable buildings, no church life of centuries to look back upon, no
associations with an historic or personal past to kindle an interest and
a sentiment. Beligion in the colonies, like the institutions and the
towns and cities themselves, is new and modern. It has its history
and its traditions still to make. These pioneer conditions which made
the colony what it is are productive of a material and practical spirit,
and it would hardly consort with the fitness of things to expect that
the personal effort and public activity which have had so much to do
to make the country fit to live in, would have left much time for the
cultivation of a temperament over-favourable to the encouragement
of the religious or literary or artistic mood. This consideration must
be borne in mind in connection with our present subject; and yet,
after making every allowance, it is by no means certain that the Colony
of Hew South Wales has been behindhand in the development of
religious institutions.
The detailed figures of this subject are best shown in the census
returns of 1891, though later figures are of course available. From
that source we learn that for the year named, while the total population
of the Colony was returned at 1,123,954, the number of persons not
specifically included in one or other of the religious bodies was made
up from returns under various headings as about 30,000, while about
14,000 others either objected to state their religious belief or failed to
define it. Putting the whole at under 50,000, it will be seen that the
return does not show such a mixed condition of things as would be
reasonably probable, considering the various and widespread sources of
population, and the necessary difference between religious organisations
in Australian communities and elsewhere. Twenty years ago or more
Mr. Anthony Trollope, in the book he wrote about the Colonies, had a
sentence to the effect that he felt bound to record his opinion that


religions teaching and the exercise of religious worship were held
as essential to civilisation and general well-being by the people of
Australia. That writer was hardly the best authority on Australian
matters in a general way; but the figures given may be taken as bearing
out his opinions in this instance. “The people/’ he further said,
“are fond of building churches, and of having them in their villages,”
and here he was again accurate in his observation. The question of
church attendance, of course, is another question. The mere filling
up an entry in a census form may show the nominal position of the
Churches ; but it does not throw any definite light on the estimation
in which religion is practically held. In 1892 we find that 357,781
persons were returned as attending the services of their respective
denominations, being in the proportion of 30*3 per cent, of those
returned as nominal church adherents in the previous year’s census.
Twenty-four years ago, with a population of 502,861, the church
attendance was 172,320, or about 34 per cent. With a little more than
twice the population, therefore, the falling off has been something like
4 per cent.; which means that, proportionately speaking, about 44,000
persons less than in 1871 are in the habit of attending the church
services of their respective denominations. It is noteworthy that the
only body in which the attendance is up to 100 per cent, of nominal
membership is the Salvation Army. The Wesleyan Methodists come
next in proportion with 57 per cent.; then come the Congregational
body with 48, the Baptists and “ other Wesleyans ” with 43 each, the
Boman Catholic with 38, the Presbyterian with 28, and the Church of
England with 16, all in round figures. This way of looking at the
subject may serve to indicate the respective influence of each denomina-
tion on its own adherents; but it is not absolutely conclusive in itself
until the actual numbers of each denomination are given. These show
a church attendance of members of the Roman Catholic Church of
112,474; Church of England, 83,639; Wesleyan Methodist, 51,415;
Salvation Army, 45,765, the number of enrolled members being 10,312;
Presbyterian, 32,215 ; Congregationalist, 12,025 ; other Methodists,
10,020; Baptist, 5,903; and other denominations, 4,325. It should
be mentioned that these figures, however, only relate to adult attend-
ances, and the returns from Sunday schools show that the total figures
for church attendance would reach 476,000 if these were included.
There are some other considerations to be reckoned with before arriving
at final conclusions on these figures. One is that the population in many
districts of the Colony is so scattered that attendance at church services
is in some cases extremely difficult, and in others impossible. Another
point is that the average in New South Wales is much higher than in
England, where these adverse conditions do not exist. The supply of
clergymen and the number of church buildings must also be included in.
the calculation. The former shows a general average of 1,031 persons
to each clergyman, and the latter something like 4,885 churches, or
school buildings so used, for the whole denominational population,
providing seating accommodation for 448,492 persons.
The figures of the different denominations have fluctuated with the
growth of population as time went on. By the census returns it would
appear that about fourteen persons in every twenty belong to one or
other of the Protestant bodies (about ten in twenty being of the


Church, of England), while five in twenty are of the Roman Catholic
faith, and 302 persons were classified as unsectarian Christians. But
these proportions have not always ruled. The Roman Catholic returns
show a falling'-off in proportion to the growing population of 2*74 per
cent. Without quoting the actual figures of the returns too closely
it may be said that during the thirty years before the census the
Church of England increased with the population during the second
decade and decreased during the third; the Roman Catholic Church
fell away during both periods; the Presbyterians increased in both;
the Methodist bodies increased, as also did the Congregationalists and
Hebrews. At the same time, of course, the figures of each have been
steadily going' up with the population. Since 1861 the Protestant
bodies have been augmented by 557,740, the Roman Catholic numbers
by 187,971, the Hebrew by 3,725, and 11,589 for other persuasions.
Taking the whole population figures of the colony it is calculated that
44*75 per cent are members of the Church of England or other Pro-
testant Episcopalian Churches, 25*53 are Roman Catholics, 9*73 are
Presbyterians, 7*79 are Wesleyan Methodists, B*l4 belong to other
Protestant bodies ; 0*97 being Buddhists, Oonfucians, or Mahomme-
dans, mainly of the Chinese or Hindoo races, 0*49 being Jews, the
remnant being indefinitely specified. The proportion of the sexes
shows a marked preponderance of males over females under the
heading of each denomination, amounting in the cases of the two
largest denominations to about 36,000 and 12,000 respectively. The
relative positions of the different denominations to-day can be best
seen by a glance at the comparative facts and figures.
The Church of England in New South Wales consists of a Bishop
Metropolitan, the five Bishops of Bathurst, Goulburn, Newcastle,
Grafton and Armidale, and Riverina, with 327 regularly ordained
clergymen registered for the celebration of marriages, 159 laymen
licensed to conduct services, and a total number of nominal adherents
amounting to 502,980. The Church of England is still the largest
and wealthiest of the denominations, possessing 625 churches and
holding service besides in 832 school buildings and private dwellings.
The number of clergymen is smaller in proportion to the adherents
than in any other large denomination, the proportion being a minister
for every 1,510, but if the proportion to church attendance is taken
it stands at a clergyman for every 256 adherents. The church-holding
capacity of the denomination is 126,830, and the adult attendance is
one-third less. The head of the denomination is the Metropolitan,
the Right Rev. Dr. Saumarez Smith, whose position carries with it
the Primacy of Australia and Tasmania. Five of the principal towns
of the colony are also the sees of bishops, who have their cathedrals
at the towns from which the dioceses are named in four instances and
at Wilcannia for the diocese of Riverina.
The Roman Catholic Church has 444 churches and 718 school or
other buildings used for Divine Service. There are 313 fully ordained
clergymen and about 1,600 members of religious orders engaged in
teaching or works of charity. The proportion of adherents in the
returns to clergymen stands at 973, and the total stands at 286,895.
The church accommodation provides 76,663 sittings, and standing
room for 114,008 persons besides. At the head of the denomination


is his Eminence Cardinal Moran, wlio is also Apostolic Delegate for
Australia. He is assisted by a coadjutor bishop, and six suffragans
liaye cathedrals at Goulburn, Bathurst, Maitland, Grafton, Armidale,
and Wilcannia.
The Presbyterian Church is divided into three main sections, the
Presbyterian Church of New South Wales, the Presbyterian Church
of Eastern Australia, and the Free Presbyterian Church. There are
also the Church of Scotland and the United Presbyterian Church.
Altogether the denomination has 250 churches, and there are 485
public buildings used occasionally for worship. The total number of
ministers is 166, of whom 154 belong to the first-named branch, nine
to the second, and one to the third, while two others are unattached.
The church buildings accommodate 61,305 sittings, and the adult
attendance is about half. The Moderator is elected yearly.
The various branches of the Methodist body include the Wesleyan
Methodists and Primitive Methodists as its main bodies, but there are
other smaller divisions. In 1895 a movement for amalgamation made
considerable headway, the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia
visiting Sydney to advocate the union. Altogether, the denomination
numbers 110,112 members, of whom 87,516 belong* to the first-named
division, which has 133 ministers, or one to 658 adherents. It has
eight districts, with 401 churches and 518 other preaching* stations.
There are 490 local preachers, the church membership is about 9,631,
and the attendance of adults at Divine Service is over 50,000. The
Primitive, United, and other Methodist bodies, including the New
Connection, number about 22,500 adherents, with 37 ministers and 91
churches, with 21 other buildings offering seating accommodation for
16,718. The attendance stands at over 10,000, and the President of
Conference is elected yearly.
The Congregational Church has 24,089 adherents, and 65 ministers,
with an average of 371 adherents to each. There are 64 churches and
56 other buildings used for worship, with sittings for 20,390 persons,
with an average adult attendance of about half.
The Baptist Church includes the Baptist Union, numbering* 12,344
adherents and 27 pastors, or one to 257, and other subdivisions, which
include the Particular and Adventist Baptists. Altogether there are
32 pastors, 41 churches, and 61 other buildings, with sitting accommo-
dation for 10,875, and a regular adult attendance of about half.
The Salvation Army has 11 officers licensed to celebrate marriages,
and 208 buildings are used for service, with a Sunday attendance
computed at 45,765.
The Lutherans number 7,950, with five ministers ; the Bible
Christians 2,336, with nine ministers, and the Church of Christ enrols
2,042 members, with five ministers. The Unitarian body has one
minister, and 1,329 adherents. There are eight other ministers of
Christian sects, with 2,773 adherents, and 5,484 Hebrews, with three
rabbis. The Buddhists, chiefly Chinese or Hindoos, number 10,110,
while about 6,000 are agnostics or free-thinkers, about 3,000 profess
to have no religion, about 5,000 claim to belong to no denomination,
and about 11,000 refused to give any information on the subject at
the last census. Denominations numbering* under 500 adherents


include Christian Israelites, Moravians, New Church, Catholic Apos-
tolic Church, Calvinists, Quakers, Christadelphians, and Latter-day
Saints.
The only form in which State aid to religion can he said to exist is
in the shape of pensions in lieu of salary to clergymen in receipt of
State aid before the passing of its abolition act in 18G2. In 1868 the
amount so paid was £82,372 ; in 1892 it was £8,048. Of this, the
Church of England received £4,529 ; the Roman Catholic Church,
£2,121; the Presbyterian Church, £648 ; and the Wesleyan Methodist
Church, £750.

Education.
BY R. N. MORRIS, LL.D., Department of Public Instruction.
One of the dangers which beset young communities is that of pursuing
the path of material progress to the neglect of the cultivation of those
intellectual and moral qualities which, after all, must be regarded as
forming the foundation of social safety and national greatness. Every-
thing in a new country makes demand on physical energy; the very
exigencies of existence imperatively require that men shall work with
their hands to win subsistence from the soil. The disastrous results of
inattention to physical wants are immediate and fatal, and so cannot
be postponed; whereas the evil consequences of failure to supply mental
needs are not so clearly seen, neither are they so soon or so keenly felt.
Almost necessarily, therefore, everything that concerns the immaterial
man has to await a more convenient season. But too often that which
was at first necessity afterwards becomes habit. The flush of material
success and the inflow of wealth, with its seduction to wish for more,
is liable to make the pursuit of riches the mam object in the life, not
only of the individual, but also of the nation. Moreover, the country
having managed to get along without intellectual culture, such culture
comes to be looked upon as not being indispensable, and so is neg-
lected ; and, when a large majority of any community becomes imbued,
even though unconsciously, with this sentiment, public opinion lends
its support to the idea; and, in such circumstances, society is uncon-
scious of its own deficiencies.
The colonies of Australia, though not wholly escaping the usual con-
sequences incident to the early stages of national life in a new country,
were, however, never liable to the full measure of their force, inasmuch
as the first colonists included a certain number of men of scholarship,
culture, and refinement, who brought with them the traditions of
British civilisation, and who felt, on behalf of their children, the need
of educational advantages. This feeling from time to time received
fresh impulse as new arrivals came to these shores from the old home
across the sea.
During the first thirty years of the existence of this Colony educa-
tion was left entirely in the hands of private individuals, the Govern-
ment taking no part whatever in the matter.
The first State recognition of the necessity for general education
took the form of a subsidy to the various religious bodies, in proportion
to the amounts raised by them for educational purposes. The money
was given to assist in maintaining schools which were wholly under
ecclesiastical control. When this system was begun is not certain,
but the probable date is about 1820. It may be said generally that the
state of education from 1820 to 1848 was anything but satisfactory.
In 1831 Sir Richard Bourke drew the attention of the Legislative
Council to the importance of providing more ample and efficient means
x


for tlie education of the youth of the Colony. From year to year,
though with little immediate effect, he continued to press the matter
on the notice of the Council, and in 1836 he recommended the intro-
duction of the Irish National system, founded a few years before by
Lord Stanley. Bourke’s successor. Sir George Gipps, followed the
same line of policy as his predecessor, but without avail. In 1843 Dr.
Lang made a fruitless attempt to introduce a comprehensive system.
In the following year Robert Lowe succeeded in obtaining the appoint-
ment of a Select Committee to inquire and report. As a result of the
work of this committee Mr. Robinson moved that the Irish National
system should be adopted. After various amendments and much dis-
cussion, in which Mr. Cowper, Mr. Windeyer, Mr. Lowe, and Mr.
Wentworth figured prominently, it was decided to introduce the Irish
system, but still to recognise and assist Denominational Schools. It
was not, however, till 1848, four years later, that anything practical
was done, when on the 4th of January the first National Board was
appointed consisting of Mr. J. H. Plunkett, Mr. W. Macleay, and
Dr. Nicholson. At the same time Messrs. Riddell, G. Allen, Callaghan,
and T. Barker were appointed a Board “ for the temporal regulation
and inspection of Denominational Schools.”
This system, while it proved to be a great advance on the previous
method, or, rather, lack of method, nevertheless on the score of
expense, and by reason of its divided jurisdiction, was not so complete
a success as its promoters could have Avished; so, after many attempts,
at length in 1866 an Act was passed by Mr. (now Sir H.) Parkes,
which abolished the tAAm old Boards, and provided for the formation
of a new body, to be called the Council of Education, Avhich should
disburse all funds paid by the State for educational purposes, and should
have the poAver to make regulations having the force of IaAV unless
disallowed by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. By this Act
the Council was authorised to grant aid to such Denominational Schools
as met certain conditions, and were willing to submit to inspection by
the Council’s officers, and follow the course of secular instruction laid
down by the Act and regulations. The scheme was, however, so devised
as to give a preference to Public Schools as compared with those of
a sectarian character.
Any ordinary reader must be struck with surprise at the great delay
which occurred before any thoroughly efficient system was adopted; but
the truth is, that the reform of our educational system Avas really a pro-
longed struggle, a large section of the community clinging pertinaciously
to the idea that all schools should be ecclesiastically controlled.
The Council of Education did excellent work during the fourteen
years of its existence, and laid the country under great obligations;
but there was a conviction gaining strength among thoughtful citizens
that as the State had by manhood suffrage handed over complete
political control to the great body of the people, for her own safety
she must see to it that all should be fitted to give an intelligent vote ;
and that to save constituencies from mere schemers, charlatans, vision-
aries, and demagogues, she must place within the reach of all voters
that which Avould, as far as possible, enable them to read and think for
themselves. So, in 1880, further legislation, again under the direction
of Sir H. Parkes, was effected, Avhich abolished the Council, with


drew all aid from Denominational Schools, greatly reduced the fees pay-
able by pupils, made education compulsory, and created a Government
Department charged with the duty of carrying out the provisions of the
Public Instruction Act.
Up to the year 1880 the teachers were paid partly by fixed salary and
partly by the fees of the pupils, the fee payable being one shilling a
week per child, with a stated reduction where more than one child
attended from the same family; people who wanted a school had to
furnish some portion of the cost of erecting a building, and, in the case of
Denominational Schools, the whole cost. Under the present Act build-
ings are put up and kept in repair entirely by the expenditure of public
money; the teacher is paid wholly by the Department, and the fees,
now reduced to threepence a week, are paid into the consolidated
revenue. All children between the ages of 6 and 14 must attend at
least seventy days in each half year, unless they are otherwise receiving*
instruction, live more than 2 miles from the nearest school, are pre-
vented by some cause which the Minister deems sufficient, or hold a
certificate stating* that they are educated up to a fixed standard. The
instruction is secular, but this is defined so as to include lessons on
moral subjects and the bare facts of Scripture history, the text-books
being the Scripture lessons of the Irish National Board, Old and New
Testament, Numbers I and 11.
Classification of Primary Schools.
Public Schools are divided into ten classes, according to the attend-
ance. The
First comprises all schools whose quarterly average does not fall below 600

Any Public School which fails to maintain an average of 20 is reduced
to the rank of tenth class.
In localities where the average will probably not reach 20, schools
are established called Provisional. In these, if the averag*e is 18, the
school ranks as first-class Provisional; if between 18 and 15 as
second-class, if between 15 and 12 as third-class. Any of these Pro-
visional Schools may be declared Public Schools if the average for a
quarter rises to 20 or more.
Still smaller groups of children are provided for by Half-time
Schools, and House-to-house teachers. It must be difficult, as will
readily be seen, for any children to escape being enclosed in an educa-
tional drag net so comprehensive as that just described.
Public Scnools of the first, second, or third class are divided into
three departments: one for boys, presided over by the head master,
who is aided by a staff of assistants and pupil teachers ; one for girls,
with a head mistress and staff ; one for infants, with an infant
mistress and staff. A fourth-class school has two departments, one
for boys and girls and one for infants. In the case of schools divided
into departments, the head master has a general supervision, but does


not interfere with tlie internal management of tlie girls’ or infants’
department, tlie mistress being lield responsible for the organisation,
discipline, and instruction in her own department.
Fifth and sixth-class schools are taught by a head teacher and
staff. All schools below sixth are managed by one teacher.
Superior Public
The Minister may declare any Public School a Superior Public
School if the inspector certifies that there are not fewer than twenty
pupils therein who have been educated up to the standard of a fourth
class, which has completed its fourth quarter of enrolment. In those
schools extra lessons are given in Latin, Euclid, and Algebra to boys,
and in French to girls. Originally, pupils in the highest class
paid an extra fee of 7s. a month ; but in 1884 this was abolished,
and all pupils now pay the usual fee of threepence a week.
*
Appointment to Schools.
In order to be eligible for the chief positions in schools of the
various classes, the teachers must hold the several grades set out in
the following table :
For I Class School ... ... ... ... IA
For II )) ... ... ••• ••• IB
For 111 or IV Class School ... ... ... II A
For Vor VI „ „ 118
For VII ~ ~ HI A
For VIII „ „ HI B
For IX „ ~ ... ... ... lIIC
For X or Provisional no classification is necessary.
Classification of Teachers.
From the above table it will be inferred that the rank of teachers is
divided into three classes, comprising in all seven grades. All promo-
tions in status from class to class are made as the result of a twofold
test, a test as to attainments applied by means of a written examination
and a practical test by an inspector, who estimates the candidate’s
ability to teach, organise, and discipline a school. A certain fixed
standard must be reached both in attainments and also in skill before
promotion is granted. Promotion from grade to grade may be secured
without examination as the result of five years’ reports of the inspector,
all equal to the standard required for the higher grade. This is called
promotion by good service.
Pupil-teachers.
Beneath the rank of teachers comes that of pupil-teachers. They
are required to serve at least four years in this position. At the end
of each year they have to submit to examination, and, if their attain-
ments and skill warrant it, a step is gained, so that in the fourth year
of service, if they have passed all their yearly examinations, they occupy
the position of first-class pupil-teachers. More than one failure to pass
the same examination renders a pupil-teacher liable to be removed from
the Service. .
Training Schools.
All first-class pupil-teachers who have passed all their examinations
at the first attempt are allowed to compete for scholarships, which


entitle tlie holders to admission into the Training Schools. Of these
there are two, one for females and one for males. There are fifteen full
scholarships to each Training School, and the winners of these are
trained and supported wholly at the Government expense. In addition
ten half scholarships are awarded, and in the case of these the Depart-
ment hears half the expense. Others who pass the examination but do
gain scholarships may enter the Training Schools at their own expense
provided there is room, but they cannot sit for a classification at the
end of the course, nor gain any official advantage over those who do
not enter the Training School. The period of training is one year, and
at the end of that time trainees are examined and classified as third
or second class teachers according to the manner in which they acquit
themselves. Those first-class pupil-teachers who fail to gain scholar-
ships remain as ex-pupil-teachers, and occupy various subordinate
positions until they acquire the requisite skill, knowledge, and length
of service to enable them to secure promotion by examination. It may
here be remarked that students are encouraged to attend University
lectures and to work for a degree wherever such a course is at all
practicable. Special facilities for this are given to those students who
possess unusual ability and industry.
Instruction and Attainments of Pupil-teachers.
Each pupil-teacher receives instruction for at least one hour on each
school day from the head master of the school in which he is engaged.
The subjects are : —Reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography,
history, drawing, music, school management; and for males, Latin,
geometry, and algebra; and for females, French and needlework.
Each year they are expected to show an increasing proficiency in these
subjects, and also an improvement in practical skill.
Attainments of Teachers.
Candidates for a third-class certificate are examined in reading,
writing, arithmetic (including vulgar and decimal fractions, proportion,
practice, simple and compound interest), grammar (including the use
of words, Saxon and Latin derivation, and composition), geography
(European and Australian), history (outlines of English and Australian),
school management, drawing (blackboard and freehand), rudiments of
vocal music; and for females elementary domestic economy. Candi-
dates for second-class must pass in reading, writing, arithmetic (the
full course), mensuration (elementry), art of teaching, grammar, English
literature, geography, drawing (model and geometrical), music,history
(English and Australian), and (for females) sanitary science. Also in
one of the following: I, Latin, 11, French; 111, euclid (three books
with deductions), with algebra (to quadratic equations, including
surds); IY, Any two of the following : Experimental physics (Balfour
Stewart); chemistry, inorganic (Roscoe); geology (Geikie’s Class Book);
botany (Oliver’s Elementary Lessons); physiology (Huxley’s Elementary
Lessons). For a first-class certificate candidates must pass a more
difficult examination in the subjects enumerated for second class, and
among the alternative groups we find trigonometry, Greek, German,
and hygiene, introduced. University graduates of not more than five
years’ standing are exempted from examination in alternative subjects.


Number of
In 188(1, wlien tlie present Act came into force, tire number of State
Schools in existence was 1,265 ; in 1890 this number had risen to
2,423 ; and at the end of 1894 the total was 2,508, providing accommo-
dation for 231,370 pupils.
Number of Teachers.
In 1885 there were 3,528 teachers of all ranks, in 1895 it was 4,453.
Number of Pupils.
In 1880 the gross enrolment was 101,534; in 1885 it was 180,929,
and in 1894 the total reached 234,392.
Emoluments of Teachers.
Teachers are paid according to the class of the school in which they
work; but in order to secure appointment to the various positions
they must possess the requisite rank; thus salary depends directly on
the average attendance of pupils, but indirectly on the teacher’s classi-
fication. The pay received by teachers in charge of schools, provided
they hold the proper classification, is shown in the following table.
In addition to the salary here set down, residences are provided for all
teachers who are married. The teacher of a

The standard for a third class is given somewhat fully, as most
country pupils and many town ones go no further than this class. A
glance at the table will make it clear that they leave school fairly
prepared mentally for such duties as the great majority of men are
called upon to perform, and with an excellent foundation for subsequent
self-improvement. The standard for a fifth class shows what further
equipment is offered to those who are able and willing to remain longer
at school.


Inspection.
To see that pupils get the full benefit of the training placed within
their reach by the prudence and generosity of the State, an able staff
of inspectors is maintained, whose duty it is to visit every school once
a year at least, in order to examine the children in all subjects of study,
and to furnish a report in detail of the proficiency of the pupils and of
everything that concerns the efficient working of the school. It is
expected that short visits will be made at other times whenever oppor-
tunity is afforded. At the end of the year each inspector supplies to
the Minister a general report on the condition of the schools under his
supervision, and on the state of education in his district.

Attainments of Pupils.
At the inspector’s examination every pupil securing 50 per cent, of
full marks in any subject is regarded as having passed. All below
50 per cent, are set down as failures. The following table gives the
percentage of pupils examined in all Public Schools who passed, that
is, who gained 50 per cent, or more of the maximum number of marks,
for the years 1893 and 1894 :
Per cent., 1803. Per cent., 1894.

These columns disclose the remarkable evenness with which the work
is done, not only from year to year, but among the various subjects of
study.
The efficiency of the education imparted in Public Schools is gauged
in another way. From all parts of the Colony pupils go up for the
Senior and Junior University examinations. The numbers who have
passed these examinations from 1890 to 1894 are: Junior, 1,654; and
senior, 36.
Discipline in Public Schools.
A marked feature in Public Schools is the excellence of the discipline.
This is the more important, and indeed the more remarkable, inasmuch
as a large number of the pupils come from homes where the home train-
ing is bad and home authority very weak; nevertheless it is not very
long before these children, in a good school, fall into the orderly conduct,
respectful demeanour, and submission to authority which they find to


be the ruling’ habit of the school. This state of things is not due to an
excessive appeal to physical force, though, of course, it is known that
unusual delinquency may necessitate corporal punishment. The Depart-
ment has made stringent rules with regard to the subject of corporal
punishment, restricting its use to extreme cases ; no merely intellectual
failure is regarded as a proper reason for using the cane; and, while
there are no doubt some liberal interpretations of the phrase (( extreme
cases,” yet it may be affirmed that in the great majority of schools
discipline is maintained by the personal influence of the teacher rather
than by terror of the rod, the desire to secure and retain his approval
having much more weight than the knowledge that he has the power
to inflict physical pain.
Public High Schools.
In 1883 High Schools for boys and for girls were established in
Goulburn, Bathurst, Maitland, and Sydney. After a few years both
the Goulburn schools, and the Boys’ School at Bathurst, were closed
through lack of support. The others are still in operation. The fees
payable in these schools were originally two, now raised to three guineas
per quarter, the total enrolment in 1894 was 611. The curriculum
embraces all the subjects of a secondary school, completing the training
begun in the Public Schools, and preparing pupils for a University
course. The High Schools are subjected every year to a careful exami-
nation by the Departmental Inspectors, and the reports of these officers
show that good work is being done.
Technical Education.
In 1878, the sum of £2,000 was voted by Parliament for the promo-
tion of technical education, and in the same year the trustees of the
Australian Museum began the formation of a Technological Museum.
In 1883 a Board of Technical Education was appointed, which con-
tinued in existence till 1889, when the Technical Education Branch
was placed directly under the control of the Department of Public
Instruction, and the Board was abolished. Very fine buildings for the
Technical College and Technological Museum have since been erected
at Ultimo. Museums and Technical Schools exist also in Goulburn,
Bathurst, Newcastle, and West Maitland, and classes have been formed
in connection with a number of Public Schools. The amount spent
in 1894 on the maintenance of these institutions was £21,000.
The mere statement of the names of the various Departments will
show over how wide a field the instruction is spread : Department of
Agriculture. Sanitary Engineering.
Training in Sheep and Wool. Architecture.
Chemistry and Metallurgy. Art.
Pharmacy. Industrial and Decorative Art.
Mineralogy, Geology, and Mining. Domestic Economy and Cookery.
Mechanical Engineering. Lithography.
Electrical do Dressmaking.
Applied Physics. Manual Training.
Mathematics.
The number of students attending the various classes in 1894 was
6,543.


Oilier institutions supported by tlie State, and more or less con-
nected with education:
The Free Public Library.
Municipal Free Libraries.
The Australian Museum.
The National Art Gallery.
Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind.
Parramatta Industrial School (for girls).
Nautical School-ship “Sobraon” (for boys).
The boys sent on board the “Sobraon ” are those whose parents
habitually neglect them, or who have been guilty of small offences
against the law. They are subject to nautical training and discipline,
and receive regular instruction in the same manner as pupils attending
Public Schools. The system of treatment has proved itself a most pro-
nounced success, a very small percentage of boys taking to evil ways
after their discharge from the ship.
Institutions partly supported by the State:
Schools Arts.
In nearly all towns of New South Wales Schools of Arts have been
established. They receive assistance from the public treasury in pro-
portion to the support accorded to them by private individuals.
Sydney Grammar School.
This school was established in 1857. It is* managed by a Board of
trustees, but a portion of the cost is borne by the State. In 1894 the
subsidy amounted to £2,299, the number of pupils enrolled was 466,
so that the contribution of the Government averaged six guineas per
annum per boy. The school is not examined by any Government officer,
so that there is no direct way of judging of the merits of the general
instruction. Those pupils, however, who proceed from the school
to the University, as a rule, do well, and some take very high places
among the competitors for educational honours.
University of Sydney.
The University was founded by an Act of Parliament passed by Mr.
W. 0. Wentworth, in 1850, providing for the appointment of a Senate,
which should have power to engage professors in arts and to confer
degrees, after examination, in arts, medicine, and law.
A piece of land known as Grose Farm, comprising about 130 acres,
was given to the Senate in 1855, to serve as a site for the University and
fou affiliated colleges. Noble buildings have been erected to furnish
accommodation for the University proper. The endowment was origin-
ally £5,000 a year. In 1894 it amounted to £14,800. Some large sums
of money have been bestowed on the University by private persons,
notably the late Mr. Challis, whose gift amounted to £268,000. The
annual expenditure in 1894 was £33,6-39.


Numerous scholarships, bursaries, and exhibitions (public and
private) have been founded for the encouragement of talented boys,
and for the support during an academic course of boys whose means
are limited, but whose ability is beyond the average.
In 1852 actual operations were begun with 24 under-graduates, and
3 teachers. In 1894, there were 462 under-graduates, and 47 teachers.
The examinations for degrees are as severe as those of any University
in the world, and indeed many are less exacting than ours.
By Royal charter in 1858, it is granted that all degrees given by the
Sydney University shall as to rank, precedence, privilege, and prestige,
hold their face value in all parts of the Empire.
The Senate now has power to teach, examine, and confer degrees
in arts, medicine, law, science, and engineering. Other branches of
University work consist in the junior and senior public examinations
similar to the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations, Civil Service
examinations, matriculation examinations for those who purpose, with-
out seeking a University degree, entering the profession of the law,
and the system of extension lectures.
Affiliated Colleges.
Within the University area there are three affiliated colleges —•
Church of England, Roman Catholic, and Presbyterian.
The Wesleyans and Congregationalists have theological colleges,
but they are not affiliated to the University, and do not receive any
Government support. Prince Alfred Hospital is built within the
University enclosure, and is utilised for the instruction of medical
students.
Private Colleges and Schools.
Besides the institutions carried on wholly or partially by public
funds, a large number exist for imparting primary and secondary educa-
tion which are entirely independent of State aid. These may be divided
into denominational and undenominational.
Denominational Colleges and Schools.
Of these, the Roman Catholics have 285 schools, taught by 1,458
teachers, and having an enrolment in 1894 of 27,165 pupils. The
Church of England has 62 schools, with 246 teachers, and 2,682
pupils. Other denominations have 10 schools, 64 teachers, and 543
pupils. There are, of course, no means of ascertaining accurately the
efficiency of these schools, as neither teachers nor pupils are subject
to any kind of examination by persons holding a responsible inde-
pendent position. So far as can be judged by University examina-
tions, and by general observation, it would appear that many of them
are doing good work.
Undenominational Schools.
There are numerous private schools of this character scattered
through the Colony, principally in the more populous centres. In
1894 there were 506 in operation, having a staff of 1,203 teachers, and
12,000 pupils. These schools are devoted mainly to secondary educa-
tion. The remarks made above touching the efficiency of Denomina-
tional Schools are also applicable to those now under discussion.


Cost of Education.
Tlie gross expenditure on State Scliools for 1891-2-8-4 was —
1891 £769,565
1892 ... 768,395
1893 715,219
1894 661,055
This gives an average for the four years of £728,558. This sum
reduced to an average per head of the average annual enrolment of
pupils for the four years amounts to about £2 10s. (two pounds ten
shillings) ; that is, the average cost per child enrolled for the four
years ending December, 1894, was £2 10s. per annum.
The total amount spent by the Department of Public Instruction in
1894 was £661,000. This sum is independent of Government expen-
diture on institutions not immediately controlled by the department
last named.
It is not possible to give the exact figures representing the private
expenditure for the same object; but it is thought safe to affirm that the
entire annual cost to New South Wales of its educational system, both
public and private, is not less than £1,200,000. This means, reckon-
ing money as being worth 4 per cent., that the increase arising from
£30,000,000 is handed over every year for the purposes of education.


The Manufacturing Interest.
BY FRANK J. DONOHUE.
The employment of a people depends always in tlie first instance on
whatever may happen to he the natural outlet for its energies, and on
its own preferences. The settlers who went west in the United States
grew wheat, just as in Australia we grow wool. On the Californian sea-
board the population took to mining, and our people having learnt the
way followed them in the search for gold. When conditions are
favourable, as they are in England, and as they have grown to be in
the United States, the era of manufactures comes in, —but not, as a
general thing until from one cause and another, whether the increase
and spread of population or the decline of other means of employment,
the attention of work-seekers and capital-investors is forced in that
direction. We can hardly be said to have advanced very far to that
stage yet, but the evidences are present that it is beginning for us,
and that New South Wales will offer a tempting field for the pioneer
manufacturer on a large scale as time goes on. The fiscal policy of
the country has been, with few intermissions, one of consistent free-
trade. Now and then a politician of prominence has come forward
with a theory that in order to establish manufactures we must follow
the example of the United States and adopt a protective policy. Sir
James Martin eloquently advocated this nearly thirty years ago. He
drew a picture of the country given up to sheep-runs, employing a few
shepherds and station-hands, or working its mines for exportation from
Sydney; of which port, he said, it was the aim of the exporters and
commercial classes to make a bastard kind of antipodean Venice. He
introduced a protective tariff, as Sir Patrick Jennings and Sir George
Dibbs did after him; but the feeling of the country was against the
policy, and the year 1896 again sees the Colony under a free-trade
tariff. It is not the intention to discuss here the question as to which
of the two policies is best for the Colony. The subject has been
debated to weariness, and the electors have recorded their decision.
The development of a country’s industries, after all, depends not on
tariffs or politicians but on the preferences of labour and capital and
the natural law of supply and demand.
But the manufacturing interests have not been idle. The latest
returns available show that last year (1894) there were 42,751 persons
in the Colony actually employed in one branch or other of manufac-
ture, the principal occupations utilising their services being the prepa-
ration of clothing and textile fabrics, food and drink, metal works and
machinery, building materials, and pastoral raw material. Most of the
works in connection with these interests have been established near
the metropolis, where the conditions favour industrial enterprise; the


aggregated population more readily furnishing the workers, while
there is a plentiful and near supply of coal, with easy facilities of com-
munication from that centre. In its possession of coal the Colony
holds the greatest natural aid to manufacture, while our metals, wool,
timber, and other products offer abundant material. The great
obstacle is found in the high rate of wages obtainable by the workers
in other pursuits, and while these continue to absorb the bulk of the
available industrial population it will be always a difficult matter to
set our manufactures going on a scale adequate to our resources.
The industry offering the greatest amount of population to the
people in 1894 was that devoted to the manufacture of clothing and the
working-up of textile fabrics. In this direction it might be thought
that the staple industry of the country would insure the growth of a
flourishing and permanent industry. The conditions of pasturage on
a large portion of the country, especially in the salt-bush districts,
make it more satisfactory to raise clothing wool than the combing
variety, and as a matter of fact, the colonies supply the manufacturing
nations elsewhere with more than half of what they use in their local
factories. And yet the factories established here from time to time
do not seem to have depended entirely on cloth-makiug for their con-
tinuance, and the industry has not been a success. This is partly
accounted for by the circumstance that in no woollen mill is the
machinery of the best and most effective kind. Two years ago we
had in these mills plant worth £28,200, and machinery of 145 horse-
power, the clothing factories employing plant worth £4,473. The
forty-four boot and shoe factories in the Colony employ more than half
the total number of hands occupied in this general branch of industry,
the section next in number handling clothing, and the rest including
furriers, hat and cap manufacturers, and oilskin, woollen cloth, shirt, and
underclothing makers. The leather used in the boot trade is largely a
local product, and the plant employed is worth £36,500, with machinery
of 217 horse-power. 1894 saw an output of over 2,500,000 pairs of
boots, and 461,000 yards of woollen cloth and tweed. The workers in
food products find occupation in the largest proportion in sugar mills
and refineries, which employ 1,614 persons, with a capital value of
working plant worth over £600,000. The flour-mills come next,
employing about 700 hands, with machinery and plant worth £244,365,
while the Colony’s breweries employ 744 persons, and possess machinery
and plant to the value of £122,000, with an annual output of about
10,000,000 gallons. There is a growing industry in connection with
the making of butter and cheese, in which about 1,000 persons
are employed, while the factories have machinery and plant to the
value of over £50,000. Besides these there are other industries, but
they can hardly be treated for our present purpose under the heading
of this section. The manufacture of sugar is, as may be seen by the
figures quoted, an important industry, and its record shows it to be a
progressive one. The work is falling gradually, but surely, into the
hands of large establishments. In 1882 seventy mills worked by steam
and sixteen by cattle manufactured 270,000 cwt. of sugar and 560,000
gallons of molasses, while in 1890-1, the year showing the largest
yield, thirty-one steam and two cattle mills manufactured 530,660 cwt.
of sugar and 1,074,080 gallons of molasses, while the number of hands


increased in tire same time from 1,039 to 1,621. Last year there were
two refineries, melting 756,200 cwt., possessing macliinery of 650 horse-
power, and employing 440 hands. Most of the sugar industry is
worked by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which owns mills
on the Richmond, Clarence, and Tweed Rivers. The flour-mills keep
pace with the local requirements of grain-growers, the eighty-three
establishments at work making a little under 120,000 tons of flour, the
output in 1893 being 142,000 tons. In metal working and machinery
the most active branches are the smelting, engineering, and railway
carriage works. The first-named employed 1,516 hands in 1894,
though the number was as high as 2,354 two years before, the falling-
off being one of the consequences of the depression in silver. There
was in that year plant in the Colony to the value of somewhat under
300.000, with about 1,700 horse-power, and twenty-three establish-
ments. The railway workshops gave employment to 2,739 hands, the
highest figure being reached in 1890—1 at slightly over 4,000. The
plant in 1892 was valued at over £125,000, with a horse-power of 1,040.
The engineering works employed 1,920 men last year, the value of
machinery being quoted two years before at £186,074. Besides these,
upwards of 800 men are employed in iron works and foundries, and the
industries of boiler and agricultural implement making, wire works,
plumbing, and galvanized ironworks, blacksmith and coppersmith
work, tinware, &c., are actively carried on in a smaller way. In the
matter of machinery making and engineering, it should be said that
the employment figures show a gradual falling-off of late years, which
becomes somewhat considerable when comparison is made with the
returns of ten years back; while smelting, wire working, and railway-
carriage building has increased largely during the decade. In the
manufacture of building materials the saw-mill industry takes first
place. Last year 3,257 hands were engaged in 299 mills, having
plant to the value of about £292,000, and of 5,101 horse-power. In
that year 173,088,000 feet of timber of 1 inch thickness were sawn.
In 1892 the output was about 50,000,000 feet more, with 4,573 hands
at work, but only 288 mills. Next comes brickmaking ; but here the
slackness in the building trade in consequence of the depression made a
noticeable falling-off in the figures of the year as compared with others.
In 1886-7, for example, the number of bricks made reached just
under 244,000,000, the output of 330 brickworks, employing nearly
3,000 men. Last year the number made was only about 92,000,000,
and only 165 works were in operation, employing 1,243 men. Next
in order came the various industries of joinery, pottery, asphalt, lime-
works, cement, paint, monumental masonry, &c., all of which afford
employment, with those named, to upwards of 5,000 persons, though
two years ago the number so employed reached nearly 8,000. In the
preparation of pastoral raw material, forming the next branch of
industry, there were upwards of 4,000 men employed last year in wool-
washing, tanning, and boiling-down. In 1892 the number of persons
so employed was a little under 2,000. That year produced over
1.000. cwt. of tallow, of which we exported four-fifths, and 1,616
hands were engaged in the work; while some £30,000 worth of
tanning plant is in operation. In coach and waggon building the
extent of the operations may be judged from the fact that they employ


1,224 men, while saddlery and harness-making occupies 324, the
working plant of each being about £37,000 and £53,000 respectively.
In the business of shipbuilding we employ about 1,300 hands, the
Sutherland Docks at Sydney being one of the largest single graving
docks in the world. The value of machinery and plant employed
approaches half a million sterling. The furniture-making trades
employ about 800 hands, though here again the numbers have fallen
considerably in recent years. The plant in operation is worth about
£15,000. The printing and bookbinding trades employ about 4,000
hands, and the gasworks about 1,500, in fifty-seven establishments,
with plant worth over £BOO,OOO. The soap and candle factories of the
Colony employ about 470 hands, producing 4,750,000 lb. candles
last year and about 204,000 cwt. soap, and using £60,000 worth of
plant. The manufacture of tobacco is a promising industry in the
Colony, where the soil and climate largely favour the growth of the
tobacco plant, and where the population annually spends large sums
in its consumption. These facts might well invite the attention of
growers of special knowledge in other places. With us the cultivation
of tobacco has almost entirely fallen into the hands of Chinese. In
1894 we consumed a little short of 3,000,000 lb. weight. Of this
nearly 2,000,000 Ib. were made up in the local factories from about
500,000 lb. of imported American leaf and the balance of local
growth. In 1894 we had in the Colony 600 hands employed, with
machinery and plant worth £51,600 and of 191 horse-power. Seven
years ago the number of hands was 562, and the value of plant upwards
of £83,000, and we worked about 300,000 lb. more of native leaf.
Last year the output was 1,732,496 lb. tobacco, 5,117 lb. cigars, and
114,971 lb. cigarettes, to the value of £314,671. Seven years ago
the figures were, comparatively speaking, much higher, and the value
of the local manufacture in 1887 was set down at £350,000.
These particulars show the present position of the manufacturing
outlook in ISTew South Wales. Looked at in the light of the standard
of comparison afforded by other manufacturing countries, they are not
convincing enough to establish the Colony in that category; but
regarded in the view of our own local circumstances, the enormous
yield of wealth from easily-worked natural resources, the slow growth
of population until within the last forty years, and the brief record
represented by the period between the great influx of population in
the “golden fifties” and the present, they cannot be estimated as
otherwise than encouraging. Nor can the actual figures for the past
year be taken as presenting a fair ground for estimate. As we have
seen, these returns represented the effects of a depression which has
not been confined to the Australasian Colonies, and in many cases the
figures of a few years previously represent a much higher degree of
manufacturing activity than those of last year. The locking-up of
capital has a tendency to restrict manufacture and throw the popula-
tion back on primary production, and as it happens that the facilities
for this are exceptionally easy in New South Wales no active pressure
is at work to drive labour into other channels. Local capital finds an
outlet in mining enterprise sufficient for its present requirements, so
that no special inducement to promote manufactories is held out from
that side. A country which has produced over £100,000,000 worth of


mineral wealth in something like fifty years, and which raises £9,000,000
or £10,000,000 a year from the sale of its wool clip, is too rich in natural
wealth for the population to crowd itself into factories. For the
present, and in comparison with the yield from these resources, the
population is too small to work larger manufactures, though it should
be said that even under present conditions the number of the popula-
tion engaged in manufactories has more than trebled itself since 1860,
and about one-sixth of the whole is dependent on that interest. Forty
years is not a long time in which to build up large manufactures in
the face of the competing attractions for labour and capital, and what
has been done offers fair promise for the future.
That promise is strongly emphasised when we come to consider the
advantages New South Wales offers as a manufacturing country in its
wealth of raw material, in the demands of the growing Australasian
population, and in the prospects for export. With a larger working
population, and a more liberal employment of capital by manufacturing
experts, there can be no doubt that these are such as to ensure
exceptional success. In considering the advantages favourable to
manufacture the inquirer is naturally attracted first by the subject of
coal, and in our inexhaustible supplies of this, it is needless to say,
the Colony is singularly fortunate. The coal formation is found over
a large area of the Colony, while nothing even remotely approaching
our coal, either in quality or quantity, is to be found in any other of
the Australian Colonies. This fact alone seems to mark the mother
Colony out as the natural centre of Australian manufactures when the
right time comes. Although we have already raised coal to the value
of £29,500,000, the mining operations are still in their infancy. It is
calculated that our coal measures extend over about 24,000 miles of
territory; and after allowing one-third loss in working, the Government
Geologist computes that, going down only 4,000 feet, and excluding
seams of less than 30 inches, the supply of coal unworked amounts to
over 78,000,000,000 tons. Then, as to the quality of our coal, it has
been proved to compare favourably in the production of heat with the
best foreign coal. The mean specific gravity of some samples of British
coal tested for comparison was found to be 1-279, while the mean of
New South Wales coal was F 346, with less sulphur. The proportion
of carbon in British coal was found to be 80'40, while our own gave
about 76*47,- our northern and southern coal showing 79*28 and 79*40
respectively. For the purposes of the manufacturer who seeks a field
for investment these facts have considerable practical significance, as
well as the circumstance that the proportion of hydrogen, nitrogen,
and oxygen in our coal is much the same as that in English coal,
while its steam-producing power is, in coal from the Northern collieries,
nearly equal to English, while that from the south and west is a little
below the standard thus set up. The fact that our coal has a slightly
larger percentage of ash has an influence on locally manufactured coke,
which has 6 per cent, more than the imported; but certain improve-
ments in apparatus which have been adopted by some of the collieries
suggest a hope which the comparative figures of the years 1893 and
1894 seem to bear out; for while in the former year we imported upwards
of 61,000 tons of coke, in the latter we imported less than 48,000.
Nor was this difference due to a decreasing demand, owing to the
Y


depression or any other canse; for while in 1893 we manufactured
17,858 tons of coke, worth £20,000, in 1894 we made 34,458 tons,
worth £33,000. It is assumed to he only a matter of time when locally-
manufactured coke will take command of the market, thus materially
reducing the cost to manufacturers.
As regards the Colony’s natural advantages for the development of
a flourishing iron industry the same hopeful tale is to he told. The
deposits of iron-hearing ores in their richest forms are widespread
through the Colony, being almost always found in the near neighbour-
hood of limestone and coal. No other Australasian Colony can com-
pare with New South Wales in this respect, and taking our coal and
iron together it is evident that nature sufficiently indicates what the
industrial and manufacturing future of the mother Colony must he.
The principal forms in which our iron occurs are magnetite, brown
hematite or goethite, limonite, and hog-iron, with chrome iron in less
quantities. The promise of these ores is specially attractive to the
ironworker. Our magnetite has been found to yield 72 per cent, of
available metallic iron, hut of course this is exceptionally high; hut
at Brown’s Creek, near Bathurst, and at Wallerawang, samples have
been found yielding from 40'89 to 56*85 per cent, of metallic iron, and
the Wallerawang ore is specially commended by experts as being
extremely well adapted for reduction in the blast furnace. Brown
hematite ores have been found in the mountain ranges and at Mitta-
gong, Picton, Berrima, Lithgow Yalley, Wallerawang, Rylstone, and
Mudgee districts, and near Port Stephens, the analyses showing a
percentage of from 42*69 to 64*48 of metallic iron, the proportion in
most cases being over 55 per cent. Hematite from Maitland has been
found to show 60*83 per cent., and samples from Mount Pleasant, near
Wollongong, gave 54*28 per cent. The neighbourhoods of Lithgow,
Bskbank, Bowenfels, the Hunter River, and Bulli, carry limonite rich
in metal and averaging over 50 per cent, of iron, while the Mittagong
bog-iron yields about 45 per cent. We have already extensive works
at Eskbank, originally built for the manufacture of pig-iron, though
that has been for the time being abandoned. At Mittagong gas-pipes
have been made from iron smelted from the ore and taken thence to
the mould without the intermediate processes of converting it into
pig-iron. The Fitzroy works have also discontinued this manufacture,
though samples of its output were of sufficiently good quality to gain
a first award at the recent London Mining Exhibition. The stranger
may naturally ask why, with these exceptional natural facilities, we
have not already a flourishing iron industry in New South Wales; and
attribute the fact to a lack of demand for iron and its products.
A very cursory examination of the figures available on the subject
will be sufficient to show that is very far indeed from being the real
state of the case. During the past four years the Australian colonies,
which New South Wales in the future must supply, imported over
£26,000,000 sterling worth of iron and iron manufactures, and of this
trade New South Wales itself was a customer to the extent of over
£10,000,000 sterling. We have imported as much as £3,500,000
worth in one year, while all the colonies together in that year bought
over £8,000,000 worth of iron goods abroad. Had we during those
four years made up our own raw material into the finished article, this


Colony’s wants alone would have absorbed 190,000 tons of pig-iron,
Yvdiile the group of colonies would have required 480,000 tons. It
cannot be said that our resources are unequal to this demand, for in
1891 tlie Government Geologist officially reported tliat tlie districts of
Mittagong, Wallerawang, and Eylstone bad then in sight nearly
13,000,000 tons of ore, estimated to yield 5,853,000 tons of metallic
iron. It seems unnecessary to add anything to these facts to illustrate
the possibilities of the iron-trade in the Colony.
From what has been said it will be seen that the Colony holds out
a tempting invitation to capitalists and workmen willing to embark
their capital and labour in manufacturing enterprises in New South
Wales. The quality of our coal, as well as our enormous supplies,
and the metal-bearing richness of our iron ores, with their widespread
distribution within the Colony, are facts which speak for them-
selves. If we compare the iron-carrying average of these ores with
the 30 per cent, of the English clay bands, the advantage in our favour
will be apparent; and then we have our lines of railway, ensuring
rapid communication between the mines and the metropolis, and our
shipping facilities, to bring us into touch with the other colonies and
the new markets of the Far East. English experts have already visited
the Colony to inquire into its possibilities, and sooner or later we may
expect something like an adequate attempt to establish the iron
manufacturing industry on a proper scale in New South Wales.
Expansion is also invited by our wool production, and the extensive
sugar-works of the Colony claim attention, to say nothing of the
other avenues open to manufacturing enterprise indicated in their places,
like the tobacco industry, and only waiting for favourable conditions
of population and capital to make the mother Colony the manufac-
turing’ centre of Australasia.


Federation.
BY EDWARD DOWLING.
The most important national movement Australians liave ever engaged
in is that for securing the early union of the Australasian Colonies.
During the first half of the century the colonists had many public
demonstrations to endeavour to secure from the Imperial Government
the benefits of representative institutions, independent judicial autho-
rities, freedom of the press, cessation of transportation, opening of the
public lands, and other desired reforms; but it is evident that the
interests affected by the present federation movement are far greater
than those involved in any previous agitation. Although in the early
days of New South Wales the Colonial Office in London was opposed
to some of the aims of the colonists, the Home authorities are now
found desiring that the self-governing dependencies in Australasia
should become federated as soon as possible.
Considering that the vast majority of Australians are also in favour
of the early consummation of the union, it is remarkable that its
advocacy has not made much headway except during the past few
years. This past apathy can only be accounted for by the friction
principally engendered amongst residents in the various Colonies
through their taking into consideration only provincial interests, and
so wholly ignoring the compensating benefits accruing under a proper
form of Federal Government.
A competent authority on the working of civil government, Sir E.
C. Baker, President of the Legislative Council of South Australia, in
a recent public address, enumerates the following advantages that
would accrue from federation, besides the great boon of intercolonial
freetrade : —“ There would be gains in economy and efficiency in
defence ; in the status and powers of the Colonies ; in naturalisation ;
in the power to exclude undesirable aliens ; in economy and efficiency
of postal and telegraphic services; in quarantine; m marine; in the
control of the currency; in banking laws ; in copyright, trade marks,
and patents; in having uniform marriage and divorce laws; in pro-
viding for facilities for recovering debts and claims ; in regard to the
influx of criminals ; in the power to make treaties with other countries ;
in the regulation of the rivers ; in the consolidation of our debt; and
in regard to our railways.”
The peoples of the Australasian Colonies required to be specially
educated regarding the form and working of a Federal Constitution,
as, unlike the residents in Upper and Lower Canada, they have not had
a neighbouring Confederacy to familiarise them for nearly a century
with the benefits to be derived from a united political system. The


various Colonies of tlie Australasian group, however, have become
closely allied to each other through the circumstances of their isolated
geographical position, common speech, and similar institutions, so that
they are better prepared for union than the Provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, whose people when federating had to contend against different
languages, customs, and currency.
The idea of Australian federation is as old as the fact of Australian
subdivision. The territory of New South Wales once comprised every-
thing east of the 129th meridian of longitude, including the whole
present extent of Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Austra-
lia. Out of this enormous territory, the province of South Australia,
which had never yet been permanently settled, was carved in 1830.
The Port Phillip and Moreton Bay districts were settled from Sydney,
and continued to form part of New South Wales until the urgent
demands of the settlers for local self-government led to the separation
of Victoria in 1851 and of Queensland in 1859.
The agitations in the southern and northern portions of New South
Wales for separation only proved successful owing to the importance of
the settlements in which Melbourne and Brisbane formed commercial
centres, and the difficulty then experienced of securing effective repre-
sentation of local wants at a distant seat of government. Notwith-
standing, however, the vastly increased means of internal and external
communication now available, a proposal for \ ictoria to re-enter
partnership with New South Wales —made in 1894 by Sir George
Dibbs in a letter to the late Sir James Patterson —had but little
support in either Colony, as the great majority of their peoples,
although favourable to a federation of the various State Govern-
ments, are not prepared for amalgamation or unification under one
Government.
Probably the subdivision of the Australian Colonies has not yet
reached its limit. There is at present an agitation for separation in
Central and Northern Queensland; the Northern Territory of South
Australia is obviously destined to form a separate Colony; and the
great size of Western Australia makes further subdivision probable.
But the multiplication of states need not interfere with the question
of federation, and may even make some of its problems easier to
solve. '
From the very beginning, however, of the separation epoch states-
men, both in England and Australia, whilst recognising the need for
subdivision, foresaw the need of partial union for purposes of common
concern, and especially for the establishment of a common tariff. In
1849 a Committee of the Privy Council had, at the instance of Earl
Grey, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, inquired into the
government of the Australian Colonies, and had recommended that
Victoria should be erected into a separate Colony with a separate
legislature; but that to provide for certain common purposes there
should also be a central authority consisting of a Governor-General of
Australia and a General Assembly to legislate on specified subjects of
intercolonial interest. These recommendations were embodied in a
Bill introduced into the Imperial Parliament in 1850; but the clauses
relating to the establishment of a Federal Legislature, though actually
carried in both Houses, caused so much opposition that they were


abandoned by the Government as premature, and the Act as passed
provided for tbe complete separation of Victoria, postponing tbe
question of partial re-union for further consideration.
Again, prior to Responsible Government being granted in 1856 to
New South Wales and Victoria, statesmen in both Colonies unsuccess-
fully advocated that provision should be made for the establishment of
a General Assembly to legislate on matters of common Australian
concern. The reports of the committees appointed in New South
Wales and Victoria respectively in 1856 to draw up Constitutions for
those Colonies dwelt on the necessity of some such General Assembly;
but the Constitution Acts were eventually passed by the Imperial
Parliament without any provision of the kind, the Home Government
being of opinion (to quote Lord Russell’s despatch) that “■ the present
is not a proper opportunity for such an enactment, although they will
give the fullest consideration to any propositions on the subject which
may emanate in concurrence from the respective Legislatures/’
During the next few years the question of federal union was kept
before the legislatures of the several Colonies by means of select com-
mittees, royal commissions, and reports. The leading spirits seem to
have been Sir E. Deas-Thomson in New South Wales and Sir Charles
Gavan Duffy in Victoria; but the movement was confined to a few far-
sighted politicians, and produced no general effect. Their efforts,
however, helped to leaven the parliamentary mind, and the result was
a period of intercolonial conferences, dating from 186-3 onwards,
which were prolific in resolutions in favour of some form of union, but
ed to no definite scheme and no direct result. At this time we find
Deniehy —an Australian disciple of the philosophic De Quincey—-
lamenting, in an eloquent plea for the federation of the Colonies, the
difficulty of weaning many of the politicians of that day from the sole
advocacy of local wants.
At last a conference of all the Australasian Colonies, including Fiji,
which was held in 1883 to consider the question of French claims in the
New Hebrides, led to an Imperial statute being passed for the creation
of a Federal Council of Australasia, with power to legislate on a narrow
list of matters, neither of Imperial nor purely local interest, such as
fisheries, intercolonial legal process, and the influx of criminals. This
Act actually provided a kind of federal legislature for such of the
Australian Colonies as cared to join, and has since 1885 formed a loose
bond of union for legislative purposes between Victoria, Queensland,
Western Australia, and Tasmania. South Australia also joined for a
time, but afterwards withdrew. The Federal Council has no executive,
and no judicial powers, and consists only of two delegates from each
colony represented; so that it effects not a true federation, but only a
loose confederation like that of the American states of 1771, (< which
had no judiciary to enforce its Acts, and no executive head to represent
and administer its authority.” On these grounds New South Wales
has persistently refused to join the Federal Council, which, partly for
this reason, and partly owing to its want of popular initiative and its
imperfectly representative basis, has not achieved any important work.
At a conference of Australasian delegates held in London in 1887
a scheme of Australasian naval defence was approved, and a consequent
Imperial statute provides for the maintenance —partly at the expense


of tlie Colonies —during a period of ten years on tlie Australian station
of seven men-of-war ships, four of which, are to he kept permanently
in commission, the other three being held in reserve in Australasian
ports. In 1889 the report of an Imperial commissioner, Major-General
Edwards, on Australian land defences, gave great impetus to the
federal movement. Sir Henry Parkes took the matter up, and anothei
intercolonial conference was held in Melbourne in 1890, presided over
by Mr. Duncan Gillies, and attended by Sir Henry Parkes and Mr.
William McMillan as delegates from the Mew South Wales Govern-
ment. The result of this conference was the assembling of the Sydney
Convention of 1891, which for the first time crystallised die fedeial
movement into a definite shape by preparing a draft Constitution to
be recommended for the proposed Commonwealth of Australia. This
Convention was the most important conference of Australian statesmen
ever brought together. There were forty-four delegates present from
the seven Colonies of Australasia. Sir Henry Parkes was elected as
President; in addition to whom the following gentlemen were members
of the Mew South Wales Delegation : —Mr. William McMillan, Sir J.
P. Abbott, Sir George Dibbs, Mr. W. H. Suttor, Mr. Edmund Barton,
and Sir Patrick Jennings. _ .
The draft Commonwealth Bill, as adopted by the National Con-
vention of 1891, provides for a complete scheme ror federal govern-
ment —legislative, executive, and judiciary. It aims at a federation
of the modern type, but differs from the Canadian Constitution in
many respects, as the earlier federal systems of the United States and
Switzerland were conceived to be more suited to the circumstances of
Australia, especially with regard* to the maintenance of state rights.
The Commonwealth Bill is admitted to have been drafted in an admir-
able manner, although there had been much difference oi opinion
expressed by the delegates in the discussions which took place with
regard to the delimitation of central and provincial powers and the
right of the Federal Senate to amend money bills. The necessity for
the exact relation of the states to the general government being pro-
perly defined is illustrated by the fact that when the Constitution of
the United States was being made, both Hamilton and Madison left the
power to deal with the institution of African slavery open to doubtful
construction, which compromise afterwards led to the terrible Civil
War between the Morth and the South.
The Commonwealth Bill provides for a Federal Legislature of two
chambers ; a House of Eepresentatives (corresponding to that of the
United States) composed of elected representatives from each colony
in proportion to population j and a Senate (also comparable to that of
the United States) elected by the State Legislatures on a basis of
equality —the smallest State sending as many senators as the largest.
This fundamental compromise of the federal system —giving the pre-
ponderance in the one chamber to the majority of individual citizens, in
the other to the majority of States —is recognised in the Constitutions
of the United States and of Switzerland, and receives a partial appli-
lication in the Dominion of Canada, and in the Federal Empireof
Germany. It safeguards alike the interests of the smailei states who
would otherwise shrink from joining in the union, and the interests
of the nation, which is supreme in the national chamber oi the


Legislature. The form of Executive proposed is, as in Canada, the
Bi itish system of a ministry nominally appointed hy the Crown (that
is the Governor-General) but in reality responsible to and dependent
011 the confidence of the House of Representatives. A Federal Supreme
Court is also provided as a general court of appeal for all Australia, and
v ith an original jurisdiction in intercolonial matters. With regard to
the i elation or the Federal Parliament to the State Parliaments, the
bill adopts the principle established in the United States, where the
federal powers conferred by the Constitution are strictly delegated
poveis, and the states retain all ng’hts not expressly and exclusively
conferred on the Union. J
It was intended at the time that this draft bill should be discussed
in detail in all the Australian Legislatures, then referred to a second
convention to harmonise such amendments as might have been
suggested, and finally submitted in some way for the acceptance or
rejection of the people of each Colony. This process, however, broke
devil. The diffeient Parliaments could not spare time in the pressure
of provincial and party politics to discuss the Federal Constitution in
detail, and for a time the question of federal union dropped into
neglect, and the impetus of the Sydney Convention seemed lost. At
this stage the movement assumed a new phase by spreading* from the
parliament to the people. The Commonwealth Bill had been an
immense educational influence, had given definite shape to the national
aspirations, and aroused the interest and the criticism of a large
pioportion of the g’eneral public. At the same time a financial
panic and severe commercial depression made prominent the weakness
of isolation, and suggested practical arguments in favour of a speedy
national union. Tim movement neglected by the politicians began to
be taken up by the citizens. Foremost in this new movement was the
Australian Natives’ Association, who, taking* advantage of their estab-
lished organisation had already held a conference of delegates from
all its blanches in the five Colonies on the continent at the Melbourne
Town Hall, on the 25th and 26th January, 1890, under the presidency
of the late Sir John Bray, when resolutions were passed containing a
proposed basis for a federal constitution. °
Moreover, federation leagues to assist in the movement were
formed in metropolitan, suburban, and country centres, especially
along the Victorian border. It has been the policy of the various
blanches of the Australasian Federation League to assist every
Government in power in its endeavours to carry measures for securing*
the union of the Colonies at the earliest possible date. Central feder-
ation leagues were also inaugurated in Melbourne in July, 1894 (under
the Presidency of Sir John Madden, Chief Justice), and in Adelaide,
in August, 1895 (under the Presidency of Mr. J. H. Simon, Q.C.).
A motion in favour of Australian federation, proposed by Sir Henry
Parkes, in the Legislative Assembly, on 30th November, 1894, was
supported by the Reid Government, and carried by fifty-five votes to
ten. A federal party was subsequently formed under the presidency
of Sir Henry Parkes, which at the time of the last general election,
and for some time afterwards, carried on its operations and held
public meetings in the city, suburbs, and country towns.


The cause of Australian union lias been removed from tire academic
to a practical stage by the action of Mr. G. H. Reid, the present leader
of the movement, in convening a meeting of tire Premiers at Hobart,
in January, 1895, and in subsequently preparing and carrying through
the New South Wales Parliament a Federal Enabling Bill “broad-based
upon the people’s will.” The South Australian, Victorian, and Tasmanian
Legislatures have also passed that bill by large majorities; so that when
the Queensland Parliament has had an opportunity to deal with it ten
representatives to the statutory Convention, as provided for in the
Enabling Act, can be elected in each of the Colonies. The fact that
the Premier was triumphantly returned at the last general election
shows —although Australian federation was not the chief question sub-
mitted to the electors by the Government —that the great bulk of the
electors were not opposed to the proposals carried at the Hobart con-
ference for a popular initiative to the national work of moulding a
federal constitution.
Amongst the best advocates for the federation of the Colonies have
been representative ministers of religion, who in many addresses have
eloquently pleaded, away from provincial and party ties, fora political
unity of spirit. Cardinal Moran, of Sydney, the Rev. Hr. Bevan, of
Melbourne, and the Rev. Hr. Jefforis, of Adelaide, have from time to
time delivered special and important lectures on Australian federation
in several of the Colonies.
One of the most encouraging signs in connection with the federation
movement was an understanding entered into by leading politicians
that it would be something little short of wickedness to make Aus-
tralian unity a party question ; and they have accordingly on many
occasions advocated its claims from the same platform, whilst in open
opposition to each other on other political subjects.
It was when Sir Hercules Robinson occupied the position of Governor
of New South Wales that the question of the necessity for the unity
of the Australasian Colonies was ably revived by him, in an address
delivered at Albury in 1876, and many of Her Majesty’s representa-
tives in the various Colonies, appointed since that time, have also
expressed themselves willing, as far as they constitutionally could, to
further that desired end.
A late Governor of the Colony, the Earl of Jersey, in his report to
the Marquis of Ripon on the Colonial Conference at Ottawa in 1893,
as representative of the Imperial Government, says : —“ The visits of
the Australian delegates to Canada impressed them forcibly with the
advantages which accrue from the federation of neighbouring pro-
vinces.” History affords many examples of terrible feuds between
adjoining colonies owing* to there being no basis of unity between
them ; and the present Governor of New South Wales, Lord Hampden,
has but recently remarked with regard to reprisals between Victoria
and New South Wales : —“lt seems a strange thing to me an unac-
countably strange thing —to find on arriving” on these shores that there
is a wall of menacing tariffs and a hostile railway gauge between
friends and neighbours, residents in the same country, subjects of the
Crown, and divided only by an imaginary boundary line.”
Amongst the best workers in the federation movement are many
leading representatives of the various Trades’ Halls, who perceive the


benefits to the working class which will accrue from the union of the
Colonies on a democratic basis, and also the evils that would attend
white labour through a large introduction of the coloured races. The
representative sent by the London Times (Miss Shaw), after visiting
Northern Queensland, has reported “ that the maintenance and exten-
sion of the coloured labour system must lead to the division of
Australia into two sections —tropical Australia and temperate Aus-
tralia.” The labour leaders therefore advocate that it is most desirable
that the Australian Continent should not be divided into antagonistic
northern and southern states, with coloured labourers as a standing
menace to the working of free institutions like the African negroes are
found to be in America; but that the Federal Parliament should con-
trol the admission, into any of the states, of undesirable colonists who
may otherwise, before the end of the century, materially interfere with
the social conditions of the whole of Australasia.
The proximity of China, Japan, and India to Australia renders the
latter easily accessible to hundreds of millions of the Asiatic races,
and in this nearness to these Eastern human hives is seen one of the
great dangers to the preservation of the present homogeneity of the
Anglo-Saxon race on the southern continent. Notwithstanding the
edict against Chinese coming to the United States, it is officially
reported that numbers find their way over the Pacific to British
Columbia, who after payment of a poll-tax of £lO to the Canadian
Government cross a boundary extending thousands of miles in length
into the United States; and it is feared that as there are only similar
imaginary border lines in Australia a like condition of affairs is com-
mencing on the mainland, especially as no poll-tax is levied on servile
labour coming into the Northern Territory. The question of the
permanent settlement of coloured races in Australia may shortly
become a matter of international complication, as it is stated that the
Colonies as they are have no international rights; but with a united
government their claims to recognition would not be so readily denied.
An intercolonial conference is about being held in Sydney to consider
the desirability or not of these Colonies giving due notice that they
are prepared to make the treaty concluded between Japan and Great
Britain applicable to Australasia; and the results of this meeting of
representatives from the various Colonial Governments are looked
forward to with much interest by colonists, who, in view of 25,000
Japanese demanding the franchise in the Hawaiian group, are not in
favour of a large influx into the continent of even this intelligent,
ambitious, and warlike race from their now overcrowded island home,
as they would be far more dangerous as citizens than the com-
paratively inoffensive Kanakas from the South Seas.
Financiers and capitalists also acknowledge the good that would
accrue from colonial union, and Mr. Reginald J. Black has recently
asserted that, under a federal executive, a great saving could be
effected in the money expended for defences, and that even the cost
of a federal government might be recouped from savings made on
many overlapping services carried on by the several Colonies. He has
also shown that if one hundred millions of the public debts of the
Australasian Colonies were taken over and consolidated by a Federal
Government, Australian federal bonds would be regarded with equal


favour to Canadian Dominion bonds, so tliat tliere would probably be
a saying in interest of about £1,000,000 sterling, to be rateably shared
by tlie Colonies concerned. This calculation is borne out by a state-
ment made by Sir Mackenzie Bo well, Premier of Canada, when in
Sydney in 1892, that after federation the Dominion advanced so
rapidly that money was lent in tlie London market, most readily, at
three per cent., or about half the interest paid previously by the pro-
vinces. For the information of the Committee on Finance and Taxation
of the National Convention, an estimate was made by Mr. William
McMillan, M.P., that the outlay for the proposed Federal Government
would amount to £2,226,000, or about 11s. sd. per inhabitant, being
only one-twelfth of the expenditures of the several Colonies in 1889.
This approximate estimate, after revision by that Finance Com-
mittee shows the following items of expenditure : —Civil government,
£689,000; collection of revenue, £270,000; defence, £750,000; to
recoup loss on services, £200,000 ; and for interest on works taken
over by the Federal Government from the various Colonies, £367,000.
The advocates for the early union of the Colonies have often urged
the undesirability of federating them when the enemy is at the gate,
or during a war panic; as the important task of constitution making
should not be begun under pressure from without, but in a calm and
deliberate manner befitting the importance of the work. It has been
also urged that the task of defending Australia from attack by sea is
very great, as there are 8,850 miles of coastline around this island
continent; and more especially so as a naval authority like Lord
Brassey has recently stated that a Australians should not look to the
Imperial navy for defence of harbours, for effective defence could
only be given by the action of a combined fleet and land force.
Intercolonial freetrade and a common tariff would be the result of
a complete federal system, and the hostile Custom-houses now exist-
ing in Australian border towns could be entirely abolished, as in the
States of the American Union and in the Provinces of the Canadian
Dominion, in both which countries the traveller can pass across the
continent from province to province on railway lines over 3,000 miles
in length without interference of any kind by the various state
governments. At the present time all the Australasian Parliaments
levy taxes on protective principles, except that of New South Wales,
which has under the recent financial proposals successimly carried by
Mr. G. H. Beid, as Minister for Finance, adopted a freetrade tariff;
and by direct taxation imposed income and land taxes so as to make
up the deficiency of revenue from the Customs. The present Parlia-
ment of New South Wales displayed a generous spirit during the last
session by removing at once many restrictions to commerce between
her and the neighbouring Colonies, without requiring any reciprocity
or waiting until the Federal Legislature had dealt with the fiscal
question. This great concession should lead to the daughter Colonies
emulating the good example of the mother state, by voting that the
federal seat of government should be carved out of her territory,
somewhat as she has been dismembered for them in times past.
The selection of the national capital at Washington was due to a com-
promise entered into between Hamilton and Jefferson, and a similar
equitable arrangement might lead to the Federal City of Australia


being built on the wide peninsula bounded on each side by tbe Parra-
matta River, tlie nortli sliore of Port Jackson, and tbe Hawkesbury
River, called “ Walumatta ” by tbe Natives, wbicb for suitableness
and beauty of situation would bear favourable comparison witb and
resemblance to similar positions either on tbe Potomac River or tbe
Ottawa River, alongside whose waters tbe capital of tbe United States
or tbe capital of Canada has been placed.
Much of tbe opposition to tbe federation movement of late years
lias arisen from advocates for dealing forthwith witb local legislation;
who, however, forget that if tbe various Parliaments were relieved of
much of their present work they would be more likely to consider
domestic and social questions than at present. Other opponents of
federation object to surrender tbe control of tbe Customs, post and
telegraphs, the defences, tbe influx of aliens and paupers, tbe regula-
tion of the currency, banking, navigation, shipping, and other admin-
istrative arrangements of a federal nature ; although it has been well
minted out by Mr. Edmund Barton that this control is only a transfer
by the provincial parliaments and governments to tbe Australian
Parliament and Government, at tbe dictation of tbe citizens, who will
gain far more as Australians than they give as provincialists.
It is generally admitted that tbe federal union must necessarily be
of a character not easily to be changed; so that it is highly desirable
no colonial federation should be entered into without knowing its
nature, nor any national constitution adopted without a full conception
of its responsibilities. The discussions which have taken place, the
addresses which have been delivered, and the articles which have
been printed on the federation question, have done much to disarm
many avowed opponents in various sections of the community; and
especially to remove misconceptions of some working men as to the
purport of the movement, as it was shown to be truly “ one of the
people, by the people, and for the people.’ 5
One of the principal objections urged against the proposed federa-
tion of the Australasian Colonies is that they are not yet ripe or
important enough for union. But it will be seen by the following
comparison made between them and the Dominion of Canada —the
only country under the British Crown with a similar union—that
these Colonies are in many respects greater than even the magnificent
British provinces on the North American continent. The figures
given also show the great material wealth contained within the
borders of Australasia, which often hitherto has not been fairly con-
trasted by the figures published solely for New South Wales or some
other settlement of the Australian group being compared with total
figures of federated countries such as Canada, containing as they do
the total statistics for nearly all the North American provinces; so
that strangers, unacquainted with the geography of the Australasian
Colonies, sometimes gain a wrong impression of their collective
progress and resources through no recognised political union existing
between them.
As the other Colonies of the Australasian group are mainly off-shoots
from New South Wales it is only reasonable their progress should be
noted in connection with that of the parent settlement. The Colonies
of New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia,


New Zealand, Victoria, and Queensland occupy an area of 3,161,457
square miles, and are nearly equal in extent to tire territory possessed
by the Dominion of Canada. The population of the Australasian
Colonies at the end of 1894 numbered 4,153,766, being much more
than that of the residents of the United States at the time when the
independence of that country was gained. The trade of the Austral-
asian Colonies is, however, twenty times greater than that of the
American States when they declared their independence, and shows
the much greater commercial intercourse between nations during the
present century principally obtained by the extensive use of large
steamships instead of small sailing vessels. In 1894 the trade of the
Australasian Colonies with the United Kingdom was £50,544,660,
or more than double that of Canada, although parts of the latter
have been settled by Europeans three times as long, her cities
are much nearer the great centres of trading operations, and she
has nearly 1,000,000 more inhabitants. The prosperity of the Austral-
asian Colonies is greatly due to the large extent of excellent pastoral
and agricultural land, accumulated wealth, invested capital, home
manufactures, and foreign trade, which have made the average wealth
of the Australian to be greater than that of the inhabitant of any
other country. The revenues of the several governments for the year
1894-5 was £27,978,675, being three times as great as that for
Canada, notwithstanding her much larger population. The exports of
Australian produce increased from £20,000,000 in 1861 to £51,000,000
in 1894, and consist principally of the produce of the pastoral, mining,
and agricultural industries, such as wool, tallow, hides, gold, silver,
copper, tin, coal, wheat, meat, butter, wine, fruit, timber, &c.
The foregoing figures exhibit the wonderful progress that has been
made by the Australasian Colonies during the last fifty years, which will
be found far greater than the development of the Canadian Provinces
during the same period j but, it is believed, that under a snnilai
confederation to that of the Dominion of Canada the progress of
Australasia would have been much more than the totals given. The
trade of the Australasian Colonies in yearly value amounts to
£112,000,000, and the exports and imports reach a grand total sea-
wards of 17,350,000 tons. Australasia has constructed 13,788 miles
of substantial railways, connecting all the chief cities, and 47,558
miles of telegraphs on poles conveying messages to all parts of the
Australian Continent. Her pastures feed 121,161,000 sheep, 18,315,000
horned cattle, 1,891,000 horses, and 1,191,000 swine; and the increase
to the crops during the last half-century is much greater than what
has been reaped in the Canadian Dominion.
Many years ago the question was raised as to the policy of obtaining
freedom and independence for the golden lands of Australia, but it is
evident that the time for departure from under the 83gis of the
greatest empire in history has not arrived. Dismemberment of the
British Empire is now deprecated by English and Australian states-
men, and under the present liberal colonial policy of the Imperial
Grovernment —which has allowed the full enjoyment of fiee institu-
tions —many years must elapse before the great majority of Austra-
lians would desire to see their country an independent state. The
present century is remarkable for the achievement of Federation


in Germany amidst turmoil and bloodshed, but it is believed that
the foundations of the Australian Commonwealth will in a few years
be well and truly laid in perfect peace.
The Eastern home of the original inhabitants of the British Isles
is said to have been in the cities of the Medes, whence tribes of
them migrated westward along the shores of the Mediterranean until
they arrived in Britain 5 and 111 the same manner their descendants
afterwards crossed the Atlantic to America. As the tide of civiliza-
tion still rolls westward, continuous waves of immigration must here-
after flow, not only out of the countries of Europe but also from the
large populations in North America, to the Australian continent and
to the adjacent islands in Oceana, especially when the Nicaragua
Canal has been opened from the Atlantic to the Pacific shoies. The
island-continent of Australia from its unique geographical position
should, therefore, hereafter become the connecting* link between the.
civilizations of the East and West, and consequently the centre of
that Greater Britain which will doubtless form one member of a pact
between the English speaking races, who in another centuiy, judgixig
from their present progress, should number 1,000,000,000 persons,
and be the controlling powers in every quarter of the globe.

APPENDIX B.
FROM EUROPE TO SYDNEY, AND HOW TO LIVE THERE.
BY W. G. RENDALL.
Those who are about to migrate from the old world to the new will naturally be anxious
to gain some definite idea as to the cost of the process and the prospects which their
intended surroundings afford. In this short resumd of fares, routes, and cost of living
in New South Wales, it is only possible to take a most superficial glance at the circum-
stances attending such a change; but one which, it is trusted, will be of some little
service to those who are seeking fortune, pleasure, or change, amid scenes which have
much to recommend them, and which furnish many of the elements of happiness and
comfort to those who are provided with the necessary equipment of ordinary talent,
education, perseverance, and a little money.
Although the general condition of things in the Eastern Colonies of Australia may
be said to be similar, New South Wales presents advantages to those who are inclined
to try their fortunes in fresh fields and pastures new which should not be overlooked.
The geographical position of the port of Sydney at once gives the Colony a premier
position with regard to commerce upon which hangs her industrial and social welfare.
Then there is a vast extent of territory, taking in every range of climate suited to the wants
of diversified tastes and constitutions. That of Sydney proper is admittedly “delightful,”
the city being in close proximity to both the sea and mountains, which, combined with our
beautiful harbour and inland scenery, leaves nothing to be desired in this respect. Nearly
every department of labour and industry is fully represented, and the labourer, whether
in the mechanical branches of trade, in the arts or sciences, or other walks of life, receives
fair remuneration for his work, while living is comparatively cheap alike as regards food,
clothing, or house rent, added to which the possibilities are always in favour of colonists
who are in the van of progress, and who take an active interest in the well-being of the
community. There is no place in Australia for the idle or intemperate, and all such
invariably find a common level of destitution and wretchedness. Our skies are bright
and sunny, our surroundings each and all in harmony with light and warmth. Our people
are genial and sympathetic, and those who come to us in the same spirit speedily find
friends and companions, who aid in relieving the irksomeness of new surroundings. The
present purpose, however, is not to describe our social condition, or to dilate on our
modern achievements in the way of public or private conveniences, which invariably call
orth the admiration and surprise of much-travelled tourists, who discover that there is
something to be seen in Australia, and that modern progress in science and invention,
and the art of living well, find ample illustration in Sydney and her pretty suburbs, filled
with a busy population of about 400,000 souls.
Turning to the subjects under present consideration, the first one worthy of note is
that of
Routes and Fares.
The traveller from Europe to Australia has a variety of routes at his disposal, and as
to which to select, it is simply a matter of paying one’s money and taking one’s choice.

The leading companies, each and all, provide such a splendid service that one can hardly
make invidious distinctions. The prevailing rates from London to Sydney are as
follows :
Children between 3 and 12 years of age, half price ; one child under 3, free ; for more
than one under 3, quarter fare each, exclusive of one taken free. An abatement of 20 per
cent, off return journey for passengers taking single tickets returning by same line within
six months of landing, and 10 per cent, if within twelve months. An abatement of 10
per cent, off first and second class single fares to families equal to three adults, and 15
per cent, to families of equal to four adults and upwards. No abatement is made on
return tickets or third-class fares. Missionaries, cricketing teams, and theatrical parties,
can obtain an abatement of 20 per cent, off first and second class single fares. This
schedule is at present in force, subject to three months’ notice to be given by either of
the companies mentioned in writing.
In addition to these steamers should be mentioned the splendid line controlled by the
Messageries Maritimes Company, whose steamers run between Sydney and Marseilles.
The company also provide special facilities for passengers crossing the Continent en route
to Paris or London. The fares by this company are about the same as those of the P. and
0. and Orient lines. Then there is the American route, giving the tourist an illimitable
range of scenery and the choice of deviating paths in the great western world. The
Canadian-Australian line takes the traveller through Canada or the States, whither he
will, as well as to the Hawaiian and Fiji Islands in the Pacific, and thence to Sydney. The
Australian-American line carries the traveller across the United States, thence to New
Zealand, and on to Sydney. This route is also full of the most striking features of
interest. These routes vary in cost, according to the direction taken overland, and the
manner in which it is travelled. The hand books published by the various companies
are so complete in every detail that to go into particulars is superfluous. The American
route, as well as the British India line, carries passengers direct to Sydney without
touching Albany, Adelaide, or Melbourne. By the others, however, passengers can land
at the places last mentioned, and proceed to Sydney by rail if they wish, paying, of
course, the increased fare overland. The whole of the steamers find their destination at
Sydney, to which all through fares are calculated.
Wages Paid in Various Trades.
In providing a list of the various trades and occupations, and the wages paid, the
amounts set forth can only be taken as approximate, as during the past two or three
years retrenchment has been largely resorted to, and employes have been compelled to
accept low rates of wages in order to retain their posts. More recently the prevalence of
droughts has curtailed the demand for labour in the interior, which has caused a large
influx of persons seeking employment to the more thickly-populated centres, and for
similar reasons, as well as owing to the effects of the recent depression in the industries of

Victoria, a large number of unemployed have been attracted to this Colony. With a com
bination of such circumstances, persons in search of employment have been compelled to
accept smaller wages to enable them to bridge the season of depression. New South Wales
has been made a place of refuge during the interval of financial distress by reason of the
more advantageous position the Colony has occupied, so that the item of work and wages
has suffered more on account of the support which has been given outside of its own
legitimate labour market than had the task of remodelling pay sheets been between local
employers and employes only. This has been especially the case in Sydney, while the
same remark may be equally applied to the principal provincial centres. Such a state
of things has necessarily disorganised the local labour market, and the various unions and
trade organisations, which had their growth in more prosperous times, have become
powerless in dictating rates of wages and other matters in the labour market, as in nearly
every department of trade men and women are willing to work for what they can get.
Tow wages, or its attendant privations, however, must not be taken as synonymous with
the labour market of New South \Yales, but rather as an exception, almost without
precedent, so far as the thrifty and industrious are concerned, and there is every reason
to believe that the worst has been passed, as during the last year a large number of firms
and institutions have raised the salaries of employes who had been reduced during the
interval of financial depression, so that the return to a liberal standard of remuneration
may confidently be looked for, and with the rapid recovery which has been experienced
by this Colony, there seems every prospect of labourers becoming worthy of their hire in
all the ordinary branches of trade.
Wages in all pr ivate establishments are paid weekly, and the usual rate is forty-eight
hours, or eight hours per day. In some cases piecework is taken instead of daily wages
—an alternative which has led to a good deal of “ sweating'’ in the manufacture of ready-
made clothing. The general rule, however, is to calculate earnings on a weekly basis,
which, in a general way, may be enumerated as follows :
*Rate per annum. Other wages are at per week. The rates of wages paid on farms are similar to those
enumerated under the heading “ Stations.” With the exception of “ Businesses,” the whole of the above
include board and lodging.

* Rate per annum. All other wages enumerated are at per week, the whole of which include board and
lodging with the exception of waitresses in coffee palaces and restaurants, some of whom sleep off the
premises.
Shearers. —Outside districts have been paying 20s. per 100; central and eastern districts
a reduction to 17s. ; small stations, 15s. Rouseabouts, 20s. to 255. per week ; in some
cases 30s. per week, according to experience. Other hands, including wool-pressers and
overseers, engine machinists, range from £2 to £5 per week, according to arrangement.
Shearers’ cooks, 3s. to 4s. per week from each man on one board ; shearers’ rouseabouts,
2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per week from each man on the board. General station hands engaged
for boundary riding, &c., all the year round from 15s. to 20s. per week. Shepherds are
now being replaced with boundary riders as the country becomes fenced.
Shop Assistants, —Counter hands in the ironmongery, drapery, grocery, and similar
trades receive from £2 10s. to £3 per week for foremen and seniors, ordinary assistants
from £1 10s. to £2, and juniors from 10s. to 20s. per week; office and errand boys from
ss. to 10s. per week.
Bakers. —Foremen and first-class hands receive from £2 10s, to £3 per week, and
second-class from £1 to £2 per week.
Brass-finishers and Coppersmiths. —Wages range from Bs. to 12s. per day. A large
number of youths and apprentices are employed in the mechanical branches. The manu-
facture of brass foundry is very considerable.
Building Trades. —Wages are paid at per day, owing to the loss of time that happens
through inclement weather or other causes. Trade has been extremely dull for the past
two or three years ; but latterly the demand for labour has increased, and there has been
a little more activity in the building trade generally. Wages are somewhat unsettled,
therefore the rates given can only be taken as approximate. Masons receive from 10s. to
12s. ; bricklayers, Bs. to 10s. ; carpenters and joiners, 7s. to 10s. ; plasterers, slaters,
galvanized iron workers and plumbers about the same ; labourers, pick and shovel men,
and unskilled labour generally are in over supply, and men are glad to get work at as low
as ss. per day.
Butchers. —Shopmen get from 20s. to 50s; boys, 10s. to 20s. ; slaughtermen, 30s. to
50s. ; and small goodsmen from £2 to £3 per week. In many cases a slightly lower rate
of wages is accepted when board and lodging is provided. In the city very few butchers
make their own small goods, supplies being obtained from those whose special business
is to manufacture and deliver, as well as to take waste from the shops.
Coach-builders. —Smith and wheelers’ wages from 30s. to 50s. per week; bodymakers,
painters, and trimmers are paid at about similar rates ; and vicemen from 30s. to 355. per
week. There is a good deal of work done in this trade throughout the Colony, and large


quantities of manufactured stock are imported from America. While there is a large
demand for the more useful kinds of vehicles, a good deal of very superior and highly-
finished work is turned out.
Bootmakers. —This is a very large industry ; the manufacture of boots and shoes in this
Colony exceeds 3,000,000 pairs per annum. Nearly the whole of the work is done on
piece, and the rates paid vary very much. Earnings are at about the following rates :
Foremen, 50s. to 705.; machine-operators, from 255. to 605.; clickers, 30s. to 505.; cutters
and pressmen, 30s. to 555.; makers, 30s. to 605.; blockers, 30s. to 405.; finishers, 30s. to
555. ; female machinists, 15s. to 255. ; apprentices (boys and girls), ss. to 15s. per week.
Clothing Trades.—A. large proportion of the tailoring work is done on piece work, or
at employes’ own homes. it is stated that a good business suit can be purchased
retail at £1 10s. to £2 25., it goes without saying that very little is paid for the labour
which produces these goods. The same remark may be applied to women s clothing ;
“ready-made costumes” can be bought from 4s. 6d. each upwards, and other lines of
ready-made clothing are on the same scale. In the clothing trade the following are tne
rates paid per week : —Cutters, 50s. to 70s. ; foremen, 60s. to 100 s. ; coat hands, 30s, ro
60s. ; females, 15s. to 325. 6d. ; trouser hands (males), 50s. to 60s. ; vest hands (males), 40s.
to 455. ; females, 15s. to 20s. ; machinists, 15s. to 30s. ; machiners, 50s. to 70s, ; trimmers,
40s. to 60s. ; buttonhole finishers, 20s. to 255. ; boys and assistants, ss. to 20s. Dress-
making : A great deal of work is taken privately, and the rates for this class of work varies
considerably, according to style, cut, and finish. Articles are generally paid for at per
garment, for which no fixed rates can be given. In large establishments, where weekly
wages are paid, the following are about the approximate rates : —Forewomen at the heads
of large houses are sometimes paid as much as £4 or £5 per week, but more often the
amount is considerably less. Tailoresses, from 20s. to 30s. 5 bodice hands, from 12s, 6d. to
305.; while machinists and general dressmakers receive about similar amounts. Wages for
beginners and apprentices range down to 2s. 6d. per week. Millinery forewomen are
paid £2 or £3 per week ; milliners, 15s. to 30s. ; improvers, ss. to 10s. ; and saleswomen
from 15s. or £l, up to £2 or £3 per week, according to age and experience. Shirt-making
is generally done by employes at their own homes on piece, and the results are about the
same as those quoted in the departments noted above.
Metal Working Trades.— In this important constructive branch the remuneration given
in the various trades differs considerably. Classed as a whole, skilled labour commands
from 50s. to 60s. per week, although mechanics and engineers engaged in requiring more
than ordinary skill receive higher wages. Second-class labour may be rated from 30s. to
40s. ; junior apprentices and boys from ss. to 20s. per week. Persons engaged in ship-
building and repairs are paid rather better wages.
Miscellaneous.—ln the departments of joinery, wood-carving, and turning, pottery,
brick-making, marble-working, saw mills, and the like, wages vary according to the
nature of the work. In constructive works it frequently happens that contracts are
accepted by tender at very low rates, which necessitates employers cutting wages to the
smallest possible level to enable them to finish their contracts satisfactorily. It is almost
always the rule to let work on piece if it will admit of it, and competition frequently
reduces wages to a limit which employers are not anxious to follow. The current late of
wages for journeymen is from £2 to £3 per week.
A good tradesman in almost any ordinary branch of trade, no matter whether a
carpenter and joiner, cabinet-maker, saddle and harness maker, tinsmith, builder, watch-
maker, plumber, printer, lithographer, book-binder, potter, tanner, biscuit-maker, or any
similar fixed occupation, may regard his labour as worth 50s. to 60s. per week. If he has
more than ordinary ability, and shows a capacity for assisting the business with which he
is assisted, he will probably earn more, while he may be pretty sure of gaining less if he
is not up to the general average.
Unskilled labour is worth about 6s, per day. On the wharves and similar places, where
the hours of labour vary, overtime is allowed for at the rate of Is. per hour.
Mining labour forms a considerable item in the total of those employed in the Colony ;
but it is entirely beyond the scope and purpose of this work to give the smallest indica-
tion of the different rates paid by the different mines. Those actually engaged in the


work of mining coal earn from 2s. to 3s. per ton, or from Bs. to 11s. per day. A large
number of persons are employed in mining at various occupations at rates ranging
from a few shillings per day; on the other hand, foremen, overseers, paymasters, over*
men, engineers, and others receive better wages. On the gold-fields a large propor-
tion of the work is done on tribute —that is, the miners take a certain proportion of the
gold won as their share, in payment for work and labour done. In this way (say) 20, 30,
or 50 per cent, of the gold is paid to those employed in finding it, according to the richness
of the field. The rates paid on the silver mines are about on a par with those current
for coal-mining.
House Rent.
This important item in the cost of living may be estimated at about one-fourth or one-
fifth of the ordinary earnings of arfcizans and mechanics with families. Rates vary greatly,
according to position and the distance from the city. The same style of house even in the
same street frequently commands a difference of several shillings a week, simply on account
of its position. Rents are genei'ally paid weekly for the smaller class of tenements,
and fortnightly, monthly, or by arrangement, for the larger ones. Briefly stated, house
rents in the city and suburbs are as follows : —Workmen’s houses, in the suburbs, of about
3 or 4 rooms, 7s. to 10s. ; houses of 5 or 6 rooms, 15s. to 20s. ; and 6 or 7 rooms, 20s. to
255. per week. These are chiefly terrace houses, and, as a rule, include kitchen, with all
conveniences and offices. Detached houses of 7or 8 rooms are somewhat difficult to find
unless at high rents ; those within easy access by tram, train, or ferry command from £65
to £lOO per annum, and for gentlemen’s residences, with grounds, in the suburbs, some
little distance from town, £lOO to £250 per annum is demanded. In the provincial towns
rates are much lower, and, as a rule, more land is given to each tenement. The rates
enumerated above are within the range of twopenny and threepenny fares by ’bus or tram,
or one penny by ferry.
Board and Residence.
Living in apartments, with or without board, is comparatively cheap ; in fact, the scale
of “ quality and price” is sufficiently varied to suit all degrees of tastes and means. The
following gives a fair idea of the cost of living under such conditions :—Mechanics and
labouring classes can obtain fairly good accommodation from 15s. to 18s. per week ;
ordinary board and residence in private families, or at boarding-houses, from 18s. to 255.
per week; superior accommodation, from 255. to 30s. per week. Hotels charge Bs. to
10s. per day. Weekly rates in first-class hotels vary from 30s. to 60s, per week. Coffee
palaces charge from 6d. to Is. for single meals, and 2s. 6d. to 4s. for single beds. Charges
in the country are about on the same scale, perhaps a little less. A large number of
persons rent single furnished rooms at 4s. to 6s. per week, and obtain their meals at
restaurants.
The Price of Food.
The necessaries of life in the way of food, fuel, light, &c., are procurable in this colony
as cheaply as in any part of the world. There is an abundance of meat, fruit, and all
kinds of farm produce which is at the command of all classes at prices varying somewhat
according to the consumer’s proximity to the locality where his requirements are dis-
tributed or produced in large quantities. In the city or suburbs the ruling rates for pro-
visions vary according to the season of the year, but may be approximately set out as
follows :
Meat. —Retail prices for prime joints in the city and suburbs are —for mutton : fore
quarters, l|d. per lb. ; hinds, 2d. per lb. ; chops, 2d. to 3d. per lb. ; lamb : fore-quarters,
Is. 6d. each; hinds, 2s. to 2s. 6d. each ; ribs of roasting beef, 2d. to 4d. per lb. : sirloin,
4d. to sd. per lb. ; rump steak, 6d. per lb. ; plain, 2Jd. to 3d. per lb. ; corned beef, 2d.
to 3d. per lb. ; pork : loins, sd. to 6d. per lb. ; legs, sd. per lb. ; sausages : beef, 2d. to
3d. per lb. ; pork, sd. to 6d. per lb. ; veal : fillet, sd. per lb. ; loin, 4d. per lb. ; breast
and shoulder, 3d. per lb. Poultry commands high prices at Christmas and Easter.
Ordinary retail prices for live poultry range as follows :—Fowls, 3s. to 4s. per pair ;
ducks, 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. per pair; geese, ss. to 6s. per pair; turkeys ; hens, ss. to 6s.


per pair ; cocks, 6s. to 12s. per pair. Dressed poultry commands about double these
prices. Wild ducks in season, 2s. to 3s. per pair; teal, Is. 6d, to 2s. 6d., per pair;
rabbits, Is. per pair.
Dairy Produce. —Butter: Is. to Is. 6d. per lb. for best factory or creamery, dairy
from 6d. to Is. per lb. ; cheese, 6d. to 9d. per lb. ; bacon, 6d. to 9d. per lb. ; hams, Is.
per lb. ; eggs, Is. to Is. 6d. per dozen.
Groceries and Oilstores. —Arrowroot, sd. per lb. ; baking powder, Is. 2d. per lb. ;
