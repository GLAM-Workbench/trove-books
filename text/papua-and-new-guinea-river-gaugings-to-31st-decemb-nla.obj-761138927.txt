INTRODUCTION
Organised gauging of Papua-New Guinea rivers commenced in 1951 when the Commonwealth Department
of Works installed a station at Sogeri on the Laloki River.
The New Guinea Resources Prospecting Company Ltd. (a joint investigating organization of the Common-
wealth Government and the British Aluminium Company Ltd.) began investigations in Western Papua for a
large hydro station to generate power for a proposed aluminium refinery and installed their first recorder in
1952. The Company installed a number of stream gauging stations including stations on the Vanapa, Angabunga,
Tauri, Oreba and Purari Rivers. In 1956 the Commonwealth Department of Works took oyer the operation
and maintenance of all the Company’s gauging stations except the Purari which was finally taken over in 1961.
Where available, all records obtained from these stations while under the control of the Prospecting Company
have been included in this publication.
Since those early years a growing network of stream gauging stations has been established in the Territory
with the installation of automatic water level recorders and daily read staff gauges to provide design data tor
specific investigation projects such as dams, bridges, hydro electric stations, town water supplies, irrigation,
etc., and for the long range assessment of the water resources.
Some of the stations which were installed to investigate early proposals have served their useful purpose and
have since been discontinued because they were not sufficiently accurate or important to retain in the permanent
network. Where the records for these stations are sufficiently accurate and flows have been reduced, they have
been included in this publication.
Owing to the difficulty in engaging reliable permanent gauge readers and the fact that a single daily stage
reading on most rivers does not provide enough data, a greater dependence is placed on the use of long term
recorders which are serviced four to five times per year. At present the Department is operating 39 stream gauging
stations equipped with automatic recorders of which 24 are regarded as part of the permanent network. In
addition there are 9 stations equipped with staff gauges.
A five year expansion programme for the existing network is now in progress providing on completion in
1970, 51 base stations in the permanent network equipped with automatic water level recorders. The proportion
of the area of Papua-New Guinea covered by stream gauging stations will then be approximately 50 / Q .
The establishment, operations and maintenance of the gauging stations is carried out by the Port Moresby
Office of the Commonwealth Department of Works on behalf of the Administration of the Territory. Processing
of the stream flow data is carried out by the Head Office of the Department in Melbourne where daily mean
discharges and other flow statistics as set out in this publication are computed.
This publication is the first compilation of available data and covers the period from the commencement
of gauging in 1951 to the 31st December, 1964. Further publications will be issued at five-yearly intervals.
January, 1967.




WATER RESOURCES OF PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
The Territory of Papua and New Guinea lies wholly within the tropics. In addition to the mainland area—
the eastern part of the large island of New Guinea—it comprises New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, and
a multitude of lesser islands.
The land area of the mainland is approximately 158,000 sq. miles and the total area of the Territory 183,540
sq. miles. Practically the whole area, whether mainland or islands, is very mountainous and covered with dense
jungle or tropical grassland. The mainland is one of contrasting topography consisting of very high mountain
ranges, the principle peaks rising from 10,000 to 15,000 ft.; deep valleys with very high surface run-off; elevated
valleys of the Upper Sepik, Upper Ramu and Wahgi, and the flat swampy plains of the Sepik and Fly Rivers
and lower Ramu.
The available rainfall data indicates a wide variety of climates and rainfall regimes throughout the Territory.
The whole area can generally be described as “wet tropical” with a marked seasonal variation in the rainfall with
some areas receiving summer rainfall and others winter rainfall. Nowhere in New Guinea is there experienced
two wet seasons and two dry seasons in the one year, although this occurs at some places elsewhere in the tropics.
The general areal distribution of rain through the Territory is as follows. A belt of very high rainfall extends
through the central mainland of New Guinea to the south of the southern crests of the main mountain ranges
and from the Huon Peninsular to New Britain and Bougainville. Annual falls in excess of 270 inches have been
recorded on the south coast of New Britain. The drier parts include the Markham Valley west of the Huon Gulf
where annual falls of less than 50 inches are experienced; valleys between the central mountain ranges; dry
pockets along the north coast and extending inland into the Sepik Valley south of Wewak; and the dry coastal
belt either side of Port Moresby. This coastal strip is the driest part of New Guinea with an annual average rainfall
of 40 inches at Port Moresby.
The rather variable topography contributes to the high degree of climatic variation over relatively short
distances. An excellent example is the narrow island of New Britain where the area south of the mountain range
receives a winter rainfall and to the north a summer rainfall. A similar variation may be found on the mainland
where winter rainfall is experienced along the southern slopes and summits of the main mountain range and
on the plains for about 100 miles south of the ranges. In contrast dry belts are formed to the north of the ranges
from June to August when the south-east winds most strongly dominate the circulation. The dry coastal belt
on either side of Port Moresby is mainly due to the failure of the low coastal land area to present an adequate
barrier to the south-east winds. However, to the north west of Port Moresby at the head of the Gulf of Papua
very high rainfall occurs owing to the presence of the mountain barrier. Differential heating of land and sea
is of considerable importance throughout the whole area, convectional rainfall contributing a large share of the
total precipitation.
A general characteristic of the rainfall throughout the Territory is its marked diurnal variation. The pattern
is shown in the river flow where sharp rises and falls occur at similar times daily. Stations indicating this char-
acteristic are generally located close to the headwaters where time of run-off from the catchment is fairly uniform.
The lower reaches of the rivers exhibit smaller and more numerous peaks due to the larger catchment areas and
lower stream velocities. This diurnal variation in flow limits the usefulness of daily read staff gauges.
The heavy rainfall gives rise to some very large rivers on the mainland notably the Sepik, the Fly, the Ramu,
the Purari, the KikOri and the Markham. The Sepik, the Ramu and the Markham drain the northern side of the
mainland and the Fly, Purari, Kikori and numerous small ones, the southern side. There are no comparable
rivers in the big islands of New Britain and Bougainville, the drainage of their mountainous interiors being taken
care of by the many small rapid rivers.
The many thousands of square miles of high, elevated land, abundant rainfall, and the many large rivers,
give an indication of the potential available for the development of the Territory’s water resources. For this
development to take place, it is essential that accurate and continuous records of streamflow and rainfall data
be available to enable the safe and economical design of works such as dams, bridges, hydro-electric projects,
town water supplies, irrigation and drainage.
Because the value of hydrographic records is recognized, the Administration of Papua-New Guinea has
authorised stream gauging and provided funds for this purpose. A network of stream gauging stations has been
installed on their behalf by the Commonwealth Department of Works which also operates and maintains the
stations.
Rainfall measurement networks are maintained in Papua-New Guinea by two departments of the Australian
Commonwealth Government, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Commonwealth Department of Works. A
total network of approximately 300 daily read stations and 42 pluviographs were maintained in April, 1966.
Catalogues of daily read rain gauge and pluviograph stations showing location, and length of record for each
station, have been published by the Bureau of Meteorology. A small evaporation measurement network is also
maintained by the Bureau of Meteorology.


The streamflow measuring network comprises mainly automatic water level recorders of the float type or
pressure type and some daily read staff gauges. The current meter method of measuring discharge is used exclu-
sively. During high flows discharge measurements are taken from cableways, travellers, bridges or boats. Dis-
charge measurements or gaugings at each station are carried out four or five times per year for the remoter
stations and more frequently at closer and more accessible stations. Efforts are made to obtain a wide range of
gaugings to enable a reliable stage-discharge relationship to be determined. However, with the remoter stations
which are visited only four or five times a year, it is difficult to obtain gaugings of flood flows which form the
higher portion of the rating table.
Many difficulties are encountered in establishing and maintaining the gauging stations, particularly in the
remoter regions. Roads away from the centres of trade and agriculture are practically non-existent and access
is only possible by foot, boat, plane, helicopter or a combination of these modes of travel. Materials for the
construction of new stations have often to be flown to the vicinity and either air dropped, lifted in by helicopter
or carried along mountain and jungle trails by manpower. Visits to the remoter mainland stations and to stations
on the outlying islands often involve gauging parties in tours of over 500 miles.
The recent construction of a station on the upper Strickland River in the Western Highlands District provides
an illustration of the above. The station is over 400 miles from Port Moresby and is situated 15 miles from Lake
Kopiago Patrol Post which has a small airstrip and is located 120 miles from the nearest larger settlement at
Mount Hagen. Access is only by charter aircraft and a two-day walk over fairly rugged terrain. Construction
involved an engineer, a construction supervisor and approximately 90 local labourers engaged from Kopiago.
About 6 tons of construction material and gear was required and had to be transported, first by coastal ship
from Port Moresby to Madang, thence by D.C.3 charter aircraft to Tari, the nearest larger airstrip, by smaller
aircraft from Tari to Kopiago, and by helicopter from Kopiago to the recorder site. The 250-lb. gauging boat
was too large to fit into a small aircraft and was transported to Kopiago by a R.A.A.F. Caribou plane. From
Kopiago the boat was carried on the backs of labourers in relays of 10 for three days and arrived safely at the
recorder site.
The hydrographer is confronted with many problems and hazards in performing the duties of servicing the
recorders and taking gaugings. These include risky river crossings, particularly at high stages; floating and sub-
merged logs which can overturn boats resulting in loss of valuable equipment and on one occasion in loss of
life; dysenteric fevers; reliability of return transport particularly in adverse weather conditions; hiring of native
labour to act as carriers and to do the necessary periodical clearing of encroaching jungle and to assist with the
crosswire for gauging.
The task of operating established stations is also complicated by the deleterious effect of tropical climatic
conditions on recording instruments and the difficulty of maintaining stations in trouble-free condition on the
steep, unstable and silt-laden streams. These conditions contribute to the gaps in many of the records.
Despite the many difficulties, efforts are being made to expand the network of stream gauging stations into
remoter regions, soon after the area becomes accessible through the construction of airfields or other means
of transport.
The Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology has adopted as standard equipment for measuring precipitation,
the 8-inch diameter Australian standard rain gauge and float type pluviographs. The latter consist of a standard
rain gauge emptying into a container with a capacity of 60 inches of rain. A float inside the container operates
a long term (3 to 6 months) recording instrument. The U.S. Class A pan has been adopted as the standard
evaporimeter in the Territory.
Although the period of recorded observations of rainfall and streamflow is relatively short compared with
older and more developed countries, the information obtained has enabled the design and construction of a
number of small hydro-electric stations supplying small centres of population. The first major investigation
concerned the development of the Laloki River to supply hydro-power to Port Moresby.
The full hydro-electric possibilities of the Laloki River and other streams adjacent to Port Moresby were
investigated in detail and it was established that the Laloki River offered the best potential. The development
could be conveniently built in stages and it has so far resulted in the construction of Rouna No. 1 power station,
construction of Sirinumu Dam to provide a continuous regulated flow and construction of Rouna No. 2 power
station and associated works. Two further power stations may be constructed in the future giving an ultimate
development of the Laloki River to produce an effective output of 41.5 M.W.
The need to supply power to the larger centres of New Guinea has resulted in investigations for development
of the Upper Ramu River. The proposed scheme is concerned with the development of the potential head available
in the Ramu River gorge, extending from the edge of the eastern highlands down to the lower valley of the Ramu.
In this section the Ramu River falls about 2500 feet in elevation over a distance of about 5 miles, giving a total
power potential of about 250 M.W. at 55 % annual load factor. The scheme is well placed to become a central
generating source supplying electricity to Lae and Madang and large areas in the highlands.
The investigations for both of the above schemes have required the analysis of available records to obtain
maximum, minimum and average flow figures to determine whether regulation of the flow is required to satisfy
specific power requirements and the estimation of possible maximum flood flows for the safe location of the
works and on which further detail design will be based.


Many other rivers such as the Musa, Strickland, Purari and Wahgi offer potential for large hydro-electric
development.
Both the Department of Works and the Bureau of Meteorology have programmes for the expansion of the
measuring networks under their control to give a wider and more representative coverage to the Territory.
An expansion programme for the existing stream gauging network is now in progress providing a permanent
base network in which all the major rivers will be gauged. The eventual aim is to develop the stream gauging
network to the stage where all significant catchments are served by permanent base gauging stations, with lesser
streams served by short term stations for a sufficient length of time to develop a workable correlation with a
base station.
Some of the stream gauging stations installed to obtain information for the investigation of small power
supplies, bridges and other works have served their useful purpose and have since been discontinued because
they were not sufficiently accurate or important to retain in the permanent network.
In the future it is expected that the design of hydraulic works can be based on data obtained over a relatively
short period of time at the site of the proposed work and extended over a longer period by correlation with a
base station.




GENERAL NOTES
An index is given of 3.11 stations for which the records are included in this publication.
A schedule is given of all stations installed before the end of 1964, including stations which have been dis-
continued and stations for which records have not been published.
In the schedule the stations are grouped into the various drainage divisions shown on the map and are listed
under each division with stations on the main river shown in order upstream to downstream followed by stations
on tributaries in order of joining the main river upstream to downstream. Stations on small individual rivers
are listed last.
The series of maps included show the various drainage divisions and the location of all the gauging stations
listed in the schedule.
The records from each station are set out as follows:
Station Data showing the name, catchment area, location, map reference, geographical co-ordinates,
station serial number, history and reliability of the records.
A Table of Maximum Flows for each month of the station years.
A Table of Minimum Flows for each month of the station years.
A Table of Monthly and Annual Discharges in calendar years.
For the daily read gauges the maximum recorded flows correspond to the daily reading except where the
observer has given maximum flood heights or where they have been obtained from flood marks.
For continuous water level recorders the maximum flows given are those representing the instantaneous peak.
For daily read gauges the minimum flows recorded correspond to the daily reading. On streams where there
is a large diurnal variation in the stream flow, the actual minimum may be less than that recorded.
