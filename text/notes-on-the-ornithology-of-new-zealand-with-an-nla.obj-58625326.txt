[TRANSACTIONS OF THE NEW ZEALAND INSTITUTE y
Art. lll.? lllustrations of Darwinism; or, The Avifauna of
New Zealand considered in relation to the Fundamental
Law of Descent with Modification.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.R.S., &c.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 27th June, 1894.]
On my retirement from the chair last year I had to apologize
for my inability, owing to my hurried departure for England,
to prepare the usual presidential address, but I then promised
to deliver it later on ; and by the courtesy of Major-General
Schaw I am enabled to do so this evening in the form of a
paper.
The Turks have a proverb which says that ? the devil
tempts the busy man, but the idle man tempts the devil.?
Bearing this in mind, I employed myself during a portion of
my last six weeks? voyage from England in gathering together
from my New Zealand notes and recollections, and carefully
elaborating, certain facts and inferences that appear to me to
bear directly on the great doctrine of the evolution of species
by a natural process of descent with modification?that is to
say, the ever-operating law of natural selection by variation
and the survival of the fittest. And, as I must to-night take
up some special subject for my address, it seems to me that
I cannot perhaps do better than place before you, whilst the
matter is fresh in my memory, the facts and considerations
that presented themselves to my mind and the conclusions
arrived at in the course of this interesting study. Ido so the
more readily because I find that the distinguished and gallant
officer who succeeded me, and who still occupies the presi-


dential chair, in his inaugural address on the 14th June last,
placed before the Society, in very picturesque language, views
on this question of evolution which, in the light of modern
science I cannot but regard as unorthodox and, if I may use
the term, .pernicious. Major-General Schaw will not, lam
sure, object Co this personal reference, because in concluding
his address Imlrankly admits that he has ? thrown down the
gauntlet und opened the door to criticism and discussion.? I
will give jushone quotation by way of illustration. The Presi-
dent says, in his address, <ï¿½ In connection with these beetles I
would refer to one passage in the Manual, and employ it as my
text in what I wish to say on evolution, as it is in accordance
with the theories of evolution which are now very generally
accepted. The passage I refer to is at page 23, where this
swimming-beetle is said to be ?only what a ground-beetle
might naturally become if forced to lead an aquatic existence.?
Now, my imperfect observation leads me to believe that any
ground-beetle now forced to lead an aquatic existence- x.e.,
being put into water ?will not become a swimming- beetle, but,
if it cannot get out, will inevitably become a dead beetle.? Now,
it seems to me that such a passage as that is worthy of the
Dark Ages of Science. At any rate, it shows that the author
of it has utterly failed to appreciate the plan and method of
Natural Selection, for his argument entirely ignores the neces-
sary postulate of Time. It is true that, later on in his address,
he says, ? We may undoubtedly accept as a working hypothesis,
which has very strong arguments in its favour, that the re-
markable unity in structural design which we discern in the
animate world has been brought about in some way through
heredity, or natural descent, with variations? ; and, in comment-
ing on the complete correspondence in all essential features
between the Scriptural account and the facts of nature, he
acknowledges that ? Science fills out the pictures with endless
and wonderful details, and teaches us that the days of creation
were not days of twenty-four hours, but of many thousands of
years.? But here I fear his faith is weak ; for, instead of limit-
ing the Mosaic ? days ? to thousands of years, science claims
space for vastly extended epochs of time. Sir Charles Lyell
computes the age of the world, since the Cambrian period, at
270 millions of years, and in the opinion of most geologists
this is a very moderate estimate. And Darwin says, ?If the
theory [as to the formation of the stratified rocks] be true, it
is indisputable that before the lowest Cambrian stratum was
deposited long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far
longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age to the
present day, and that during these vast periods the world
swarmed with living creatures.?
Before proceeding to my subject, I may refer incidentally,


also, to a paper by one of our members, Mr. Coleman Phillips,
? On a Common Vital Force,? which appears in the last
volume of our ? Transactions.? This essay affords pleasant
and amusing reading, but it is impossible to take it seriously.
For example, when a writer, professing to deal scientifically
with his subject, brackets together the Moa and our domestic
fowl a Eatite bird with a Carinate?as ? one species alone of
living things, there is an end to any attempt at rational dis-
cussion. Mr. Coleman Phillips, in this paper, admits that he
has not yet finished reading Darwin?s ?Originof Species,? but
says, ?What I have read has filled me with pain,? and he pro-
ceeds to treat in a slighting spirit a book which, in the vigorous
language of Professor Newton, ? has effected the greatest
revolution of human thought in this or perhaps in any other
century.?* For my own part, I regret, as well for the author?s
sake as foi the credit of the Society, that such a paper
was allowed to appear in the ?Transactions.? With these
introductory remarks, for clearing the ground as it were, I
shall proceed to discuss the subject which I have selected for
my theme this evening.
The ornithology of New Zealand, apart from its intrinsic
interest, presents to the thoughtful naturalist several aspects
of great philosophical significance. Not the least of these is
that of the many peculiar forms which it contains, and their
local distribution, because of the remarkable evidence hereby
furnished in support of the now generally accepted Darwinian
theory of the creation of species in the organic world?that is
, , ? J he theory of evolution was started as an hypothesis by Buffon, and
defended and modified by Lamarck and others, but was regarded by most
scientific men as a wild dream, until Darwin and Wallace, after years of
patient accumulation of materials, overwhelmed the learned world with
such a vast array of facts that with scarcely an exception scientific men
acknowledged their defeat, and the hypothesis of evolution was raised to
the rank of a theory as firmly based on facts as Newton?s theory of gravi-
tation, or the undulatory theory of light The great charm of
Darwin?s theory of natural selection is its simplicity. The theory of
evolution by descent with modification had a great deal to recommend it;
but the difficulty always presented itself, By what possible machinery
could it be worked? To suppose a special creation of every species was
bad enough, and looked weak, as if the clock always wanted mending or
altering to make it go right. But to suppose not precisely a special crea-
tion but a special interference, in a given direction, with the law of like
?producing like, at every generation, was a thousand times worse ; and, con-
sequently, of two evils scientific men chose the least, and the theory of
evolution was laid on the shelf until Charles Darwin and Wallace took it
down again. The fact of the survival of the fittest in the struggle for
existence is such a simple theory that a child can understand it; and not
only the scientific world, but almost every educated man, accepted
the new theory of evolution as soon as they saw?or thought they
saw?the simplicity of the machinery by which it is worked.??See-
bohm.


to say by a natural and gradual modification of charactei,
due to the survival of the fittest in the universal struggle for
existence. , .. , , ?
The principle of natural selection is expressed by Darwin
himself as that of ? the preservation during the battle of life ot
varieties which possess any advantages in structure, constitu-
tion, or instinct.? He says, and with great force, ?In
scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypo-
thesis and if it explains various large and independent masses
of facts it rises to the rank of a well-grounded theory . . .
If the principle of natural selection does explain these and
other large bodies of facts, it ought to be received. On the
ordinary view of each species having been independently
created we gain no scientific explanation of any one ot these
facts. We can only say that it has so pleased the Creator to
command that the past and present inhabitants of the world
should appear in a certain order and m certain areas; that
He has impressed on them the most extraordmaiy resem-
blances, and has classed them in groups subordinate to groups.
But by such statements we gain no new knowledge ; we do
not connect together facts and laws ; we explain nothing.
In his ? Origin of Species ? Mr. Darwin has shown that all
organic beings, without exception, tend to increase at a very
high ratio, and that the inevitable result is an ever - recurrent
struggle for existence, in the natural course of which the
strongest ultimately prevail and the weakest fail. By this
process those variations, however slight, which are favourable
are preserved or selected, and those which are unfavourab e
are destroyed. This continued production of new forms
through natural selection inevitably leads to the extermina-
tion of the older and less improved forms, these latter being
necessarily intermediate in structure, as well as in descent,
between the last -produced forms and their original parent
species. The position to which this brings us is thus stated -
? Now, if we suppose a species to produce two or more varie-
ties, and these in the course of time to produce other varieties,
the principle of good being derived from diversification of
structure will generally lead to the preservation of the most
divergent varieties ; thus the lesser differences characteristic
of varieties come to be augmented into the greater differences
characteristic of species, and, by the extermination of the
older intermediate forms, new species end by being distinctly
defined objects. Thus, also, we shall see how it is that
organic beings can be classed by what is called a natuial
method in distinct groups?species under genera, and genera
* ?The Variations of Animals and Plants under Domestication,?
2nd ed., vol. i., page 9,


under families.? Following the subject up with consummate
skill, and bringing together a marvellous array of facts and
observations, Darwin has shown very conclusively that de-
scent with modification has been from time immemorial the
means, whether naturally or artificially it matters not, of
producing new and distinct forms of animal and vegetable
life. The subject is on the face of it a very attractive one,
and, when we come to deal with the actual facts, there is
room for almost endless speculation in all directions. But
what I propose to do this evening is to single out some well-
established features and peculiarities of the New Zealand
avifauna, to which, as you are aware, I have for many years
given special attention, and to consider their direct bearing on
the theory of evolution, or, putting it the other way about, to
endeavour to find in the Darwinian doctrine of natural de-
velopment their true and rational explanation.
Perhaps there is no country in the world where the pro-
cess of natural selection among birds has had so favourable a
field for its operation as New Zealand, owing to its great age
as a continental island, and to the entire absence of natural
enemies, up to the time, at any rate, of its occupation by
man and the introduction of domestic animals which after-
wards became feral. As a result, what do we find here as
representing the ancient order of Eatite birds? I will not
refer at present to the Moa and its kindred, because these
birds have become extinct, and, except by wav of analogy, do
not come into my present subject. But look at the genus
Apteryx, taking, for illustration, the eldest known member of
the genus, A. australis. Here is a bird with, so to speak, the
body of a turkey and the wings of a sparrow, these limbs
having become so dwarfed by the operation of natural laws
that they are reduced to mere rudiments ; yet all the muscular
parts, aborted and atrophied though they be, become perfectly
distinct under the dissecting knife. Unlike all other known
birds, instead of having the nostrils placed in the nasal groove,
or on the ridge of the bill (as in the Petrel family), they are
situated under a terminal protuberance at the extreme end of
the upper mandible ; and on examination it is seen that the
produced upper mandible is in reality a prolongation of the
facial bones?the result, no doubt, of long-continued gradual
development in that direction?the brain being pushed back,
as it were, into a remarkably small cranial pan for the size of
the bird. These modifications of structure are of course
adaptations to the feeding habits of the bird, which subsists
principally on earthworms, in search of which, aided by its
power of smell, it probes the soft ground or loose vegetable
mould in its forest haunts. In addition to this the head is
furnished with long rictal hairs or feelers, as sensitive as the

whiskers of a cat, and its hearing is known to be marvellously
A R Wallace, in his admirable work on ?Darwinism,?
says (at" page 114), ?So soon however, as we approach the
higher and more fully developed groups we see indications of
the often-repeated extinction of lower by higher forms, This
is shown by the great gaps that separate the mammalia birds,
reptiles, and fishes from each other ; whilst the lowest forms
of each are always few m number and confined to limited
areas Such are the lowest mammals ?the Echidna and
Ornithorhynchus of Australia ; the lowest birds-the Apteryx
of New Zealand and the cassowaries of the New Guinea
region ; while the lowest fish-the Amphioxus or lancelet-is
completely isolated, and has apparently survived only by its
habit of burrowing in the sand The great' .of
the carnivora, ruminants, rodents, whales, bats, and other
orders of mammalia ; of the accipitres, pigeons, and parrots,
amono- birds ; and of the beetles, bees, flies, and moths, among
insects, all indicate an enormous amount of extinction among
the comparatively low forms by which, on any theory of evolu-
tion, these higher and more specialized groups must have been
T)rGC6d.6(iï¿½
Now, whilst accepting Mr. Wallace?s general argument
and admitting its soundness, I must venture to differ entne y
with that distinguished scientist as to the position assigned to
the genus Apteryx. I cannot for a moment admit that the
Kiwi is one of the lowest birds in the sense implied. It
rather seems to me to be an extremely specialized form, and
one to which Mr. Wallace?s own felicitous remarks (at page
105) are specially applicable ; ?In species which have a wide
range the struggle for existence will often cause some indi-
viduals or groups of individuals to adopt new habits in order
to seize upon vacant places in nature where the struggle is
less severe. Some, living among extensive marshes, may
adopt a more aquatic mode of life; others, living where
forests abound, may become more arboreal. In either case
we cannot doubt that the changes of structure needed to adapt
them to their new habits would soon be brought about,
because w T e know that variations in all the external organs
and all their separate parts are very abundant and are also
considerable in amount. That such divergence of character
has actually occurred we have some direct evidence. py
way of illustration, Mr. Wallace reminds us that Madeira,
like many other oceanic islands in the temperate zone, is
much exposed to sudden gusts of wind, and that, as most of
the fertile land is on the coast, insects which flew much would
be very liable to be blown out to sea and lost. Year after
year, therefore, those individuals which had shorter wings, or


which used them least, were preserved ; till in process of time,
as we now see, the insects of Madeira have become wingless
and terrestrial, or, if they have not entirely lost their wings,
have had them so reduced as to be useless for flight. To my
mind it would net be right to confound these wingless insects
with the lower forms of the ? more generalized ancestors,? but
rather to assign them a place among the ? higher and more
specialized groups.? For it must be borne in mind that, as
Mr. Wallace himself expresses it (page 120), the ?remarkable
advance in the higher and larger groups does not imply auy
universal law of progress in organization, because we have at
the same time numerous examples of the persistence of lowly-
organized forms, and also of absolute degradation or degenera-
tion. Serpents, for example, have been developed from some
lizard-like type which has lost its limbs ; and though this loss
has enabled them to occupy fresh places in nature, and to
increase and flourish to a marvellous extent, yet it must be
considered to be a retrogression rather than an advance in
organization. The same remark will apply to the W 7 hale tribe
among mammals; to the blind amphibia and insects of the
great caverns ; and among plants to the numerous eases in
which flowers, once specially adapted to be fertilized by
insects, have lost their gay corollas and their special adapta-
tions, and have become degraded into wind-fertilized forms.?
But it seerhs to me that on this point Mr. Wallace is incon-
sistent with himself; because at page 481, after referring to
my figure of the wing in vol. hi. of our ? Transactions,? he
says, ? Even in the Apteryx, the minute external wing bears
a series of nearly twenty stiff quill-like feathers? ; and he goes
on to say, ?These facts render it almost certain that the
Struthious birds do not owe their imperfect wings to a direct
evolution from a reptilian type, but to a retrograde develop-
ment from some low form of winged birds, analogous to that
which has produced the dodo and the solitaire from the
more pronounced pigeon-type.? He adds that our best
anatomists agree that both Dinornis and Apteryx are more
nearly allied to the cassowaries and emus than to the
ostriches and rheas/" Now, from this point of view, I think
the language in which I long ago characterized the Kiwi?
although challenged by Professor Hutton and others?is fully
justified?namely, that it is the diminutive and degenerate
representative of the ancient colossal forms of wingless birds.
* At page 416, op. cit., Mr. Wallace says, ? Whales, like Moas and
Cassowaries, carry us back to a remote past, of whose conditions we know
too little for safe speculation. We are quite ignorant of the ancestral
forms of either of these groups, and are therefore without the materials
needful for determining the steps by which the change took place, or the
causes which brought it about.?


Its very existence, as we now finfi it, is an illustration of the
truth, as formulated by Wallace himself, that ? greater swift-
ness, increased cunning, nocturnal habits, change of colour,
or the power of climbing trees and living for a time on their
foliage or fruit, may be the means adopted by different species
to bring themselves into harmony with the new conditions ;
and by the continued survival of those individuals only which
varied sufficiently in the right direction the necessary modifi-
cations of structure or of function would be brought about,
-just as surely as man has been able to breed the greyhound to
hunt by sight and the foxhound by scent, or has produced
from the same wild plant such distinct forms as the cauli-
flower and the Brussels sprouts.
I have referred to certain superficial characters; and tor the
purposes of our argument we need not at present go beyond
these. The Apteryx then, I take, to be the most specialized
tvpe of its kind?an extreme form of degeneracy, using that
term in its Darwinian sense. But, besides Apteryx australis ,
there are five other species, more or less distinct the one from
the other, but all closely allied in every respect, size and
colour being the only distinguishing characters. I will
enumerate these species, with the ascertained range of each.
Apteryx australis , already mentioned, inhabits the southern-
most parts of the South Island ; Apteryx viautelli (= A. hulleri ,
Sharpe) is spread over the North Island ; Apteryx oioeni
(Gould) is met with in the wooded country in the northern
and eastern portions of the South Island; Apteryx haasti
(Potts) in the Heaphy Ranges and further south ; Apteryx occi~
dentalis (Rothschild) on the western slopes of the Southern
Alps, and, curiously enough, in the Tararua Ranges on the
west coast of the North Island; and, lastly, Apteryx laioryi
(Rothschild) on Stewart Island.- The dividing-lines be-
* This is the same as Apteryx maxima of my paper (Trans. N.Z.
Inst., vol. xxiv., pp. 91, 92). Mr. Walter Rothschild, in his revision of
the genus {lbis, 1893, pp. 573-576), says, ?Apteryx maximus is almost a
fictitious species, though I am inclined to agree with Professor Hutton
that it was only an overgrown A . haasti . The name was published
originally, without a description, by Bonaparte in the ? Comptes Rendus,?
xliii., p. 841, taken from an unpublished manuscript of Jules Verreaux,
and then Professor Hutton described a foot in his ? Catalogue of the Birds
of New Zealand ? and ascribed it to this species. Both references, how-
ever, distinctly refer to a bird from the South Island . In 1890 Sir Walter
Buller finally announced that he had discovered the true A. maximus on
Stewart Island, and I am fortunate in possessing the entire series from
his collection; but I most emphatically say that this species cannot be
A , maximus of Verreaux, and therefore I have much pleasure in naming
it Apteryx lawryi , after Sir W. Lawry Buller. Sir \V. Buller fully
described this bird before the Wellington Scientific Society. All that I
shall add is, therefore, that, though the differences between it and. A .


tween these species, at certain points, are so indeterminate
that ornithologists are not yet agreed as to how many inde-
pendent species should be recognised. Dr. Otto Finsch, the
well-known German scientist, contends that the North Island
bird cannot be separated from Apteryx australis, except as a
local variety, although in this view he now stands alone;
Professor Newton, whose opinion always carries great weight
with me, declares his inability to distinguish the former as
a species distinct from Apteryx lawryi of Stewart Island,
although he recognises Apteryx australis, which occupies an
intermediate range of country. But the Professor is also in
some doubt as to the propriety of admitting Apteryx haasti as
a species.
Mr. Walter Eothschild, who owns the largest collection of
Apteryges in the world (some thirty living birds, and I be-
lieve over a hundred skins), has, after mature consideration,
decided to separate the spotted grey Kiwis into two species?
Apteryx oweni (Gould) and Apteryx occidentalis (Roths.).
Of the latter he possesses a living example, obtained in the
neighbourhood of Milford Sound, nearly as large as Apteryx
haasti and very different in appearance from Apteryx oweni,
having banded plumage, a dark head, and blackish-grey feet.
To this he refers Mr. Morgan Carkeek?s example from the
Tararua Ranges (North Island), and a number of specimens
collected by .different persons on the west coast of the South
Island. Of the distinctness of his type I have no doubt
whatever; but I am not quite prepared to follow him in
uniting the others with it. They seem to me to be a form
intermediate between it and the Little Grey Kiwi (. Apteryx
oweni) with which we are all so familiar. Here, in fact, we
have an instance of the boundary-line between one supposed
species and another being so indistinct as to occasion constant
doubt and confusion in the discrimination of the forms.
Then, again, with regard to Apteryx mantelli, in the North
Island. You are no doubt familiar with the chestnut-brown
Kiwi which inhabits the Pirongia Ranges and is found all the
australis are very slight, they are apparently constant, owing, no doubt, to
the isolation of the species.?
Mr. Rothschild declines to adopt Dr. Sharpe?s proposed name of
Apteryx bulleri for the North Island Kiwi, on the ground that the bird
originally named Apteryx mantelli by Mr. Bartlett came from the North
Island, which fact, in his opinion, ? establishes, without a doubt, the
priority of Mr. Bartlett?s name.? He says, further, ?As regards A. man-
telli, I can only point out that Dr. Otto Finsch maintained that Mr.
Bartlett?s diagnosis was founded on a false basis, and he, moreover,
believed that the North Island Apteryx was barely worthy of sub-specific
rank. Sir Walter Buller, however, and all other ornithologists who have
expressed any opinion on the subject, maintain, and, I am convinced,
rightly, that the North Island bird is distinct from A. australis .?


way down the west coast to Wanganui. But all the specimens
I have seen from the east coast are almost black in plumage,
even the feet being blackish instead of whitish-brown as in the
ordinary bird. So far no attempt has been made to raise this
form to the rank of a species, or even of a sub-species ; but the
fact remains that the birds from this part of the country are
always dark-coloured, and, as such, readily distinguishable
from the common Kiwi. And, as I have mentioned in my
? Birds of New Zealand? (vol. ii., p. 310), there is likewise a,
rufous-coloured form, with plumage of a very peculiar texture
(? Kiwi-kura? of the Maoris), which I found breeding true in
the Pirongia Ranges ; but, as this bird inhabits the same dis-
trict as Apteryx mantelli, it can only be regarded as a variety.
Nevertheless it shows very clearly the latent tendency to
vary.
'Apteryx lawryi is the largest of these species, as Apteryx
haasti (which is next in size) is the most handsome, owing
to its chestnut-and-brown dappled plumage. Apteryx lawryi
runs as it were in parallel lines with Apteryx mantelli and
Apteryx australis, as Apteryx haasti does with Apteryx oweni
and Apteryx occidentals. But, whether all these species be
accepted as distinct, or some of them be regarded as mere
varieties of others (which will always be debatable ground),
there can be no doubt whatever that they have all come from
a common parent stock, and that within a period of time,
geologically speaking, comparatively recent. Going back to
earlier times, and reasoning by analogy, we may venture to
infer that the remote ancestor of the degenerate parent form
was a volant bird?probably one tolerably well furnished with
wings and tail, with a proportionately large head and short
bill, with the muscles of the posterior limbs far less developed
than in the Kiwi, and with very different plumage, both as
to form and texture.
It may be asked how it is that we find the Kiwi developing
a long stiletto-like bill, whilst another race of wingless birds,
the Moas, belonging to the same order and inhabiting the
same country, were perfecting themselves in an entirely oppo-
site direction. But it must be remembered that, according to
the ascertained laws of variation, divergence of character in
opposite directions may take place even among members of
one and the same species, at one and the same time, and
within the same geographical area. Isolation, for such a
purpose, does not necessarily mean insulation, as some writers
appear to assume. Wallace puts it very clearly : ?Isolation
will often be produced in a continuous area whenever a species
becomes modified in accordance with varied conditions or di-
verging habits. For example, a wide-ranging species may, in
the northern or colder part of its area, become modified in one


direction, and in the southern part in another direction; and,
though for a long time an intermediate form may continue to
exist in the intervening area, this will be likely soon to die out,
both because its numbers will be small, and it will be more or
less pressed upon in varying seasons by the modified varieties,
each better able to endure extremes of climate. So, when one
portion of a terrestrial species takes to a more arboreal or to a
more aquatic mode of life, the change of habit itself leads to
the isolation of each portion.?
Now, it is not difficult to imagine that in the case of a
country which was gradually emerging from the depths of the
ocean, presenting for long-continued periods of time low flats
more or less covered with scrubby vegetation, available for
purposes of concealment, a smaller size would be beneficial to
the already practically wingless birds, the more so if correlated
with a longer bill, for the purpose of hunting for annelids
and insects in the increasing deposits of mould covering
these newly-formed flats. And, bearing in mind that natural
selection acts solely ?by the preservation of useful varia-
tions, or those which are beneficial to the organism under
the conditions to which it is exposed,? we should in this
case regard the so-called degeneration of the Kiwi as an im-
provement in the organism of the bird in relation to its
conditions and environment. So also, in regard to those
wingless birds which continued to inhabit the table-lands, and
to subsist on fern-roots and the ever-present ? cabbage-tree,?
should we regard a longer neck and a stronger bill as beneficial
variations, especially if correlated with a more massive pos-
terior development, such as that which distinguishes Dinornis
elephantopus and Dinornis crassus. May not the giant Kiwi
(Megalapteryx hectori), the remains of which were discovered
and described by the late Sir Julius von Haast, represent one
of the intermediate forms which have been stamped out and
lost in the long-continued struggle for existence along the
borderland, so to speak, of these different races of wingless
birds ?
As I have already stated, each so-called species of Kiwi is
restricted in its range to a particular district. In the case of
Apteryx mantelli and Apteryx lawryi this is insular, save as to
the appearance of the Grey Kiwi on the Tararua Range, which
I shall presently endeavour to account for. Now, if any
sudden catastrophe were to overtake New Zealand, destroying
all animal life, the remains of the different species of Kiwi
(so far as they could be distinguished) would be found in dif-
ferent localities and never commingled. This is not the case
with Dinornis and its allies. The bones of about a thousand
birds were exhumed by Sir Julius von Haast from the Glen-
mark marshes, and these comprised the skeletons of several


genera and numerous species, varying considerably in stature,
all mixed up indiscriminately together, showing that these
birds had inhabited the plains of Canterbury at one and the
same time. I have endeavoured to furnish an explanation of
this in my introduction to ? The Birds of New Zealand,?
paaes xxx iv., xxxv. Adopting a theory first put forward
byï¿½Professor Hutton ?to whom I acknowledge my indebted-
ness?l have attempted to show how this could have been
brought about by natural causes. By going much further
back in time?and that is the charm of the evolution theory,
that it imposes practically no limits as to time and space?l
have supposed that in very ancient times two or more species of
brevipennate birds, themselves the descendants of volant birds
of a still earlier epoch, roamed over a great southern conti-
nent, which, by some convulsion of nature, w r as afterwards
submerged, leaving its higher levels and mountain-tops ex-
posed in the form of numerous scattered islands, on w Inch the
survivors of the wingless race of birds would naturally remain,
that this state of things continued long enough?how long it
is impossible even to conjecture?for the inhabitants of each
island to develop new characters suited to their special en-
vironment in each case, thus bringing into existence m the
end the various species of Dinornis and its allies as we now
know them; that a widespread upheaval or elevation of the
land followed, reuniting most of the islands, and resulting in
the areas now known to us as the Islands of New Zealand,
when, of course, the Struthious birds which had been deve-
loped in the smaller insular areas would be able, in process of
time, to commingle on common ground. ?In process of time,
I say, because it would naturally take a considerable time for
the newly-elevated areas to become covered with vegetation,
although, on the other hand, it is quite possible that this
elevation may have been gradual in its operation everywhere.
I suggested that when, by the gradual subsidence of their
domain beneath the w r aters of the great Pacific, they were
driven as it were into a corner and overcrowded, the struggle
for existence became a severe one, and the extinction of the
race then commenced ; that the more unwieldy giants, thus
cabined and confined, were the first to succumb ; and that the
smaller species, perhaps in course of time differentiated from
their ancestors by the altered physical conditions their
environment, continued to live on till their final extirpation by
man wdthin recent historic times. Professor Hutton supposes
two successive submergences and elevations of the land at
long intervals, but in this I am unable to follow him. With-
out that, the theory is sufficient, I think, to account for the
co-existence in comparatively recent times of the various
genera and species. But, as the modifications in form and


structure constitute important generic distinctions, very long
periods of time must have elapsed after the continental sub-
mergence before the final elevation of the land which made it
possible for these wingless birds to commingle as they evidently
did in later times. On the assumption that the North and
South Islands were never reunited after the great submergence,
these two areas having been independently formed by the
fusion of different sets of islands, north and south, when the
elevation took place, this theory will account for the singular
fact that the Dinornis remains found in the North Island
represent different species of birds from those of w T hich remains
have been so abundantly discovered in the South.
Professor Hutton is of opinion that the smaller forms of
Ratitae in New Zealand must have preceded the larger ; and
the fact that bones of only the smaller species of Dinornis and
Syornis have as yet been found in both Islands seems to
favour that view. But the evidence on this point is, I think,
far from being exhausted, for fresh discoveries of Moa-bones
are still being made from time to time, and in the most un-
likely localities. On the other hand, whatever date may be
assigned for the extinction of the Moa (and upon this question
there is much difference of opinion), there seems little doubt
that the colossal forms, such as Dinornis maximus , D. altus,
D. validus, and D. excelsus, were the first to become extinct,,
because none of their remains have ever yet been found in the
ancient kitchen-middens, mixed up with the rejectamenta of
human feasts, or bearing evidence by chipping or gnawing of
manipulation by man in a recent state ; besides which they
have sometimes been found in a highly fossilized or mineral-
ized condition, unlike the bones of the smaller species, which
contain much organic matter and often look perfectly fresh.
I am of opinion that the larger forms are the more ancient,,
and are those that roamed originally over the afterwards sub-
merged continent, and that the smaller-sized Moas, of differ-
ent genera and species, are the descendants of those which
had been specialised in the various islands during the long
epoch following the continental submergence. Professor
Hutton, accepting the outcome of Professor Parker?s import-
ant researches into the embryology of this form, admits that
in the Kiwi the hind limbs undergo a relative diminution in
size between the time of hatching and the attainment of fully
adult proportions, especially in the case of the female; and he
adds, ? This implies that the ancestral Kiwds were, like Megal-
apteryx, larger than the living birds; and we may infer the
same thing from the great size of the egg. It is a legacy from
a larger bird wPich is not easy to get rid of. The greater
proportionate size of the female is probably due to its having
to lay such a very large egg. The males have decreased in


size more rapidly than the females, who were handicapped by
such large eggs.? Professor Hatton suggests that the reverse
of this obtained in the case of the Moas ; but there is no
evidence of that. After a critical examination of all the
evidence afforded by the bones and their distribution, he says,
ï¿½Evidently Anomalopteryx and Palapteryx are the oldest
forms; but if Palapteryx had wings it could not have been
derived from the wingless Anomalopteryx ; and, if the birds
were increasing in size, Anomalopteryx could not have been
derived from Palapteryx.? Exactly so ; but on my hypo-
thesis these difficulties disappear, and the supposed conditions
are in harmony with it. In this connection I may mention
the curious fact that, although Anomalopteryx didiformis is
one of the smallest of the Moas, scarcely exceeding in size the
common Bustard, it had proportionately the largest skull of all
the Dinar nithidce. Commenting on this, Professor Owen
remarks that, if the peculiarly nutritious roots of the common
fern contributed, together with buds or foliage of trees, to the
food of the various species of Moa, the concomitant gain of
power in the locomotive and fossorial limbs does not appear
to have called for a proportionate growth or development of
brain or of bill.
As with the Kiwi, it would seem that the development of
the Moa was downwards, or in the way of degeneration, and
the restriction of its range to small insular areas would doubt-
less favour this dwarfing process.
One can understand how in process of time the various
species of Kiwi now known to us have become evolved from
the parent stock by means of natural selection and the sur-
vival of the fittest, operating under well-established natural
laws. Any divergences of character, however small to begin
with, long continued and persisted in, would account for any
number of so-called species in various parts of the country.
Eor, a species?what is it ? What does the name denote ? Of
what use is it to science except as an artificial definition, and
for the greater convenience of systematic classification ?
But the great difficulty in any theory on the subject is to
account for the presence of the Grey Kiwi on the west coast of
both Islands. Our knowledge of its existence in the North Island
rests on a skin brought to me in a fresh state by Mr. Morgan
Carkeek, who obtained it just below the snow-line on the
highest of the Tararua Ranges, where, he states, he could have
collected many more. Eor the present, I confess that the
presence of this species in the North Island is very perplexing.
One solution that suggests itself to my mind is that it may

have been introduced in former times through human agency.
It will be remembered that the Maoris have a tradition that
the Pukeko, or Swamp-hen {Porphyria melanonotus ) ?which,
until recent years, when its haunts were invaded and drained,
was excessively abundant in both Islands?was first introduced
by their ancestors, who brought tame birds with them in their
canoes from Hawaiki. It must be borne in mind also that the
range of the Grey Kiwi includes the north-west coast of the Nel-
son District, for specimens which I obtained from that locality
have been referred by Mr. Rothschild to his Apteryx occi-
dentalis ; and, furthermore, that the passage to and from the
Kapiti coast, on the opposite side of Cook Strait, could easily
be effected by the Maoris in their war-canoes. To entrap a
few Kiwis, and bring them across alive in flax cages, would
have been a very simple operation, and a far less ambitious
project than that of stocking New Zealand with the Swamp-
hen from far-off Hawaiki. The suggestion does not seem an
unlikely one, when we remember that the Kiwi was always
highly prized by the Maoris from the earliest times, both as
an article of food and on account of its feathers.
On the theory put forward, and assuming, as we fairly
may do, that the North and South Islands have never been
united since the continental submergence,?in other words,
that there was a simultaneous elevation of the two areas,
north and south, with a permanent sea-channel dividing
them, ?we can understand and account for the existence of
closely-allied representative species in the two Islands. I will
give some examples: In the North Island the Blue-wattled
Grow {Glaucopis wilsoni), in the South the Yellow-wattled
Crow ( Glaucopis cinerea ); in the North Island the Saddle-
back ( Orcadian carunculatus) , and in the South its grey ally,
Greadion cinereus. It is true that Orcadian caruncidatus is
found also in the South Island, ?which is the proper home of
Greadion cinereus. This may, I think, be accounted for by an
accidental colonization at some time, through the crossing of
stray individuals to the other side of the Straits: even a
single pair would suffice. Rare as this bird now is along the
w 7 ooded shore on the north side of Cook Strait, I can re-
member that about thirty-five years ago it was more abundant
there than in any other part of the country. But to resume
my list of examples : In the North Island we have the Thick-
billed Thrush {Turnagra hectori), in the South the common
Turnagra crassirostris; in the North Island the Wood-robin
{Miro longipes), in the South its congener Miro australis; in
the North Island the Whitehead ( Glitonyx albicapilla), in
the South the Yellowhead {Glitonyx ochrocephala) ; in the
North Island the White-breasted Tomtit {Myiomoira toitoi),
in the South the Yellow-breasted Tomtit {Myiomoira macro-


cevhala) ; in the North Island the Pied Pantail {Rhipidura
iiabellifera) , in the South the Black Fantail (. Rhipidura
fuliqinosd ). The same remark applies to the former of these as
to the Saddleback, and the same explanation! may be ottered.
It will, perhaps, be objected that this bird is too weak-winged
to cross the Straits under any circumstances; but, as against
this, I may mention that during the past twenty years there
have been several well-authenticated cases (as recorded in my
? Birds of New Zealand?) of the Black Pantail crossing the
Straits to the North Island; and of late years there has not
been wanting evidence of its breeding here. What therefore,
is there to prevent such a species becoming naturalized m the
North Island, and that without the intervention of any but
natural causes? A gale of wind, under favourable conditions
for the passage of the Straits, would alone be sufficient to
occasion this dispersal of the species.
Now, all the representative forms I have named are
accepted by ornithologists in general as good and true species.
But take any two of them and compare ttiem carefully. Who
can for a moment doubt their common parentage ??how far
back in time, it is not our present purpose to inquire.
?Species,? ?sub-species,? and ?varieties? are now terms
in general use among ornithologists, as well as among other
specialists, and, as it seems to me, simply for the purpose of
indicating the distinctness or otherwise of the lines ot de-
marcation separating one from another in their present stages
of development under the slow and invisible, but_ nevertheless
inevitable and sure, processes of that law of evolution which go-
verns the whole animal kingdom. When we come to study the
matter more closely it often seems well-mgh impossible to draw
any specific line at all. So-called species often appear to run
into one another by insensible gradations ; so much so, indeed,
that no two naturalists are agreed as to how much persistent
difference is necessary to constitute a species, as distinguished
from a sub-species or variety. Take, by way of illustration,
the various forms of Woodhen ( Ocydromus ) inhabiting New
Zealand. Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, who, as a rule, does not err
on the side of ? lumping,? has recently declared (Bulletin,
1893, p. xxx.), that he finds it impossible to distinguish
Ocydromus greyi of the North Island from Ocydromus earli of
the South Island. This difficulty arose, no doubt, from the
circumstance of his examination of the two forms having been
confined to dried specimens. If he had been permitted to
study the live birds he would have seen that, apart from the
unmistakable difference in the general hue of the plumage,
Ocydromus greyi has brown irides and legs, whereas the
southern form ( Ocydromus earli) has these soft parts of a
lake-red colour. He says further {loc. cit., p. xxix.) that he


prefers the simple arrangement in my first edition of ? The
Birds of New Zealand,? limiting the number of species to
three, to that of my second edition, fifteen years later, which
admits five species of the group. This alteration, however,
was not made by me hastily or without full consideration. I
believe I have critically examined a very much larger number
of Ocydromi than any other working ornithologist, and,
although I do not wish to underrate the perplexities pre-
sented by the intergrading of plumage, I think I have adopted
a very cautious rule of admission. Professor Hutton has
recognised at _ least two more?namely, Ocydromus hectori
and 0. finschi and a naturalist given to what is termed
splitting ? ? might easily have increased the number still
further. But this is the crux of the whole thing. In this
particular instance the species of one naturalist is the sub-
species of another, and the ? local variety ?of a third. What
is this but the existence of transitional forms under the
steady march of evolution ?
But the question of the great variability of the South
Island Woodhens opens up a larger one, which I con-
fess myself quite unable to answer. How is it that in the
North Island there is but one well-marked species of Wood-
hen spread over its entire area, whilst in the South Island,
undei practically the same conditions of environment, there
are at least four species, and possibly more, running into one
another in such a way as to puzzle even the most expert
ornithologists ?
The Woodhen genus offers an exceptionally good example
foi a study of this sort, because, although furnished with
ample wings, the quills are soft and useless, and the birds in
consequence are flightless.
To take another instance of the kind: the Kakapo or
Ground-parrot ( Stringops hahroptilus) has ample wings, and
yet it is incapable of flight. The presence of this flightless
bird, essentially the same in all respects, in both Islands, pre-
sents a difficulty which cannot be ignored. But, then, some
species are more persistent in their character than others;
and it may be that the Kakapo, as it existed in different areas
before the final elevation, had reached its full development,
and has remained stationary ever since. Its markings had
become so exactly like the green mosses and other vegetation
among which it feeds, thus effectually protecting it from birds
of prey, and, in the absence of feral animals, the faculty of
flight had become so unnecessary to it, that it is difficult to
see in what diiection natural selection could operate further
to the advantage of the bird. It may be asked why, seeing
that the Kakapo is flightless from long disuse of its wings,
these members have not been more completely aborted?


or dwarfed to mere rudiments, as in the case of the Kiwi ?
The obvious answnr is that, allowing the necessary time, in
how many generations it is impossible to say?the same
results would naturally come about. How long it may have
taken for the Kiwi to become practically wingless since the
process of degeneration commenced we have no means of even
euessin o- . But our pestilent civilization has, of course, put a
stop to all that, and within measurable time the Kakapo will
disappear altogether-passing out of existence, m full posses-
sion of its wings, but feeble in their quills, and crippled by the
atrophy of their muscular mechanism.''
This incidental reference to the Kakapo and its protective
colouring leads me into another very interesting field of observa-
tion namely, the gradual adaptation, by natural selection
of course, of certain species to their habitual environment by
the acquisition of protective colours. The olive-green Bell-
bird is almost invisible to the eye as it clings to the leafy
climbing tawhiwhi (. Metrosideros scandens), and inserts its
brush-tongue into the corolla of the crimson flower; the
grey-and-white Ground-pipit eludes the most practised eye as
it perches on a dry log, or nestles by the wayside ; the Bronze-
winged Cuckoo so harmonizes with its surroundings as it rests
silently on a low bough that you may be within a yard of it
without detecting its presence; the Dottrel and the Godwit
squat on the sands without being seen; the Wry-billed
Plover hides itself among the loose pebbles and shingles of
its own grey colour; the green Parrakeets are undistinguish-
able from the bright evergreen vegetation among which they
feed ; the Kaka, but for its discordant cry, would generally
be safe from observation in the midst of the brown branches
among which it loves to climb and explore for insects; the
Eifleman, the smallest of our native birds, is quite invisible as
it clings to the lichen-covered bark; and the Bush-wren hops
in safety among the moss and vegetation of the forest to which
its own colours so closely assimilate. And so one might go on
selecting examples almost without end, in illustration of the
well-known law to which I have referred as being almost
universal in its application and effects.
Leaving birds, however, for one moment, let us consider
the remarkable correlation of colour with its surroundings in
* I think there is a manifest advantage in questions of this kind being
investigated and discussed by ourselves on the spot. In illustration of
this I may refer to a very curious mistake made by Mr. Alfred Russel
Wallace, the great apostle of the creed of natural selection,?to whom,
indeed, we all metaphorically doff our hats in respectful admiration. In
writing of the New Zealand avifauna he confounds the Kakapo with the
Kea, declaring that the moss-eating Strhigops had become carnivorous,
and is most destructive to the settlers? sheep !


the case of many of our lizards. The beautiful green lizard
(Naultinus elegans) so exactly harmonizes with the manuka
bushes on which it is usually found that it requires a very
practised eye to distinguish it. The protective resemblance is
rendered more complete by the leaf-shaped markings of yellow
on the back and sides; and it is pretty clear that this par-
ticular character has been acquired by natural selection, or
descent with modification for protective purposes, inasmuch
as the young of this species is of a uniform green colour.
Ihese remarks apply with even stronger force to rnv Naultinus
pulchernmus, from Nelson, although, being a somewhat rare
species, it is perhaps less noticeable. Here the irregular white
markings, intermingled with the yellow and green, coupled
with the animal?s peculiar habit of curling up its tail in the
form of a ?Catherine?s wheel,? render the deception abso-
iutely perfect. In this case also the young is of an almost
uniform green colour, varied only with leaf-like markings of a
darker green on the back. Then, again, as I have previously
pointed out, the markings on the back of my Naultinus sylves-
tns (discovered by Mr. Annabell at Wanganui) so exactly
resemble the minute yellow lichens which cover stems of
dead wood m the forests as to render it at all times perfectly
sate from detection in such situations. Naultinus sulphurous
?whether we regard it as a distinct species or only a pro-
nounced local variety?is admirably adapted by its uniform
yellow colour to the sulphur deposits of Botorua, where alone
it has been met with. But to come to the common species :
where could we find a more beautiful adaptation of colouring
to the natural surroundings than in the case of our common
tree-lizard ( Naultinus pacificus), the shades and markings of
which present an almost endless variety ; or in that of the
variable Mocoa ornata and Mocoa zealandica, inhabiting our
stony places and roadside vegetation ? A case even more re-
markable still is that of our wonderful Sphenodon punctatum
-or luatara lizard. Now this lizard is so abnormal in its cha-
racter that it forms by itself a distinct order of reptilia, and
exhibits the most bird-like skeleton of all existing reptiles It
is perhaps generically the oldest inhabitant of the earth, being
closely allied to the Prohatteria of the Permian period, its
nearest relations being the various forms of Bhyncocephala
which occur m the Trias. I have not time now to refer to the
wonderful peculiarities of this living representative of a re-
motely ancient race; but I may mention that the Tuatara has
been found to possess, concealed under the tough skin of the
forehead, the vestiges of a third but now obsolete eye, the
functional parts being present, even to the optic nerve 1 It
has become extinct on the mainland; and it is a very curious
fact that, through long isolation, it has become differentiated


in colour in the several islands or groups of islets which it in-
habits. With the exception of a green form, exhibiting some
structural modifications, which I have dedicated to our great
herpetologist, under the name of Sphenodon guentheri, it has
been found impossible to distinguish these forms except as
local varieties, sufficiently well marked however to admit of
their being referred to their respective island habitats. What
are these, I would ask, but incipient species ? Allowing suffi-
cient time under the existing conditions of life, and, reasoning
by analogy, each island or group of islets must in the end
possess a distinct species of Sphenodon exactly suited to its
environment. It is, moreover, sufficiently clear that nothing
but the island asylum could have saved this lowly-organized
and archaic form from absolute extinction. I ''
Less fortunate has been another form of New Zealand
lizard, the Kawekaweau, whose quasi-arboreal habits of life
have prevented its taking advantage of this last refuge. From
the accounts of the natives, the Kawekaweau appears to have
been a form of iguana inhabiting the deep forest, and there
can be no doubt that it lingered in the land till within
the last thirty years, when the remnant _of its race suc-
cumbed to wild pigs and other natural enemies. It is always
described by the Maoris as beautifully marked with alternate
* I may here remark that one is surprised to find a naturalist like Mr*
H. 0. Forbes ?fresh from New Zealand, and with all the literature on the
subject at his command ?in his recent address to the Royal Geographical
Society, referring to the Tuatara as ? a curious and ancient form of lizard
now absolutely confined to an islet off the coast of the North Island. ,r
Here is a statement of fact, made with apparent scientific accuracy, and
yet far wide of the truth. It is quite true that the tuatara has become
extinct on the mainland, but it still exists in considerable numbers on the
rocky islands adjacent to our coasts. It is common on the Hen and
Chickens, on Cuvier Island, on the Poor Knights, on the Mercury Islands*
and on the Barrier Islands, in the Hauraki Gulf. Coming further south, it
is abundant on the Alderman Islands, on Motunau or Plate Island, on the
Island of Karewa in the Bay of Plenty, on the Rurima Rocks, on Whale
Island, and on East Cape Island. It inhabits the various groups of islands
in Cook Straits, such as Stephen Island, the Brothers, and the Chetwynd
Islands. It has been recorded from other localities; and it is highly
probable that it exists on many unexplored islets or rocks lying off the
coast of the North Island. The last recorded specimen from the main-
land was captured in Evans Bay about the year 1842, and was preserved
by Dr. Monteith, one of the early Wellington settlers. He presented it to
me some twelve years later, and it is now in the collection of the Colonial
Museum. The extermination of this lizard is attributed to its natural
enemies of modern times, pigs and rats, whose ravages it has hitherto
been able to escape on the small uninhabited islands. Unfortunately, of
late years even there it has been exposed to the persecution of travelling
natural-history collectors, one of whom is said to have forwarded at
one time to Europe no less than three hundred specimens preserved in
spirits.


bands of colour, and reaching at maturity to a length of 2ft.
or more.*
But, although these are good illustrations of the correlation
of colour and of the extinction of well-established forms
in the struggle for existence, I feel that I am rather digressing
from the real subject of my address.
Closely connected with this subject of assimilative colour-
ing is that of the gradual adaptation of structure to the con-
ditions of existence. In my ? Birds of New Zealand ? I have
called attention to some remarkable cases of this kind, and
notably to that of the Huia ( Heteralocha acutirostris) ?an
instance quite unique in the whole class of Birds?where the
sexes present differently-formed bills, specially adapted to their
habits of life and general economy. Now, on what principle
apart from the Darwinian theory can we explain this remark-
able sexual difference ?
And to mention another case, that of the Wry-billed
Plover (Anarhynchus frontalis ) is a very remarkable one. In
this instance the bird has the bill turned or twisted to the
right, _ this asymmetry being admirably adapted to this plover?s
peculiar mode of feeding among the pebbles of the seashore.
In the case of our beautiful Red-necked Avocet ( Rocurvivostra
nova-hollandia) , the curvature of the bill is upwards instead
of sideways; and in both forms this marvellous departure
lb is significant that the Long-tailed Cuckoo (Eudynainys tait-
ensis), whose streaming tail-feathers are handsomely barred in their
whole length with chestnut and black, is also known by the name of
Kawekaweau in many parts of the country. In like manner the name
Kakariki (indicative of the colour) is applied alike to the green lizard and
to the Green Parrakeet of our woods.


from the normal type of a plover?s bill is congenital, being
present in the unhatebed embryo. Then, again, what is the
Rock Wren {Xenicus gilviventris) but an extreme development
of the Bush Wren ( Xenicus longipes ) ?which has put off its
green plumage for the dun-coloured dress more in harmony
with its surroundings among the rocks on the open mountain,
and has acquired a longer hind claw, so as to fit it for this
different habitat ?or vice versa ? The particular direction of
the development does not of course affect the argument. And
it is a significant circumstance that I possess intermediate
forms; so much so, in fact, that I have been in doubt as to
which of the two species they really belonged. Or, to take
just one more case : who can doubt that the fleshy membrane
on the bill of our Blue Mountain Duck ( Hymenolcemus malaco-
rhynchus) has been specially developed to enable it to hunt the
more successfully for the peculiar stone-encased caddis-worm
of our mountain streams, which now forms its principal article
of food ?
But now, to revert to my main line of argument: In con-
sidering the problem of representative species in the North
and South Islands respectively, it must be borne in mind that
there are probably many broken links in the chain of succes-
sion through the disappearance of representative forms. We
all know that the existing avifauna is being stamped out and
destroyed by a variety of artificial causes, not the least
among them being the naturalization of foreign birds by way
of acclimatization, on the one hand, and the introduction of
bloodthirsty animals like stoats, weasels, and ferrets, on the
other. But long before the effects of our drastic coloniza-
tion made themselves felt, many of the ground species were
dying out, in obedience, no doubt, to that inscrutable law
of nature whereby races of animals and plants, apparently of
their own accord, die out and give place to other forms of life.
I remember, when I was a boy, the interest with which I
followed the Maoris? descriptions of birds that had even then
become rare or were disappearing from the land. One bird, a
species of Rail apparently, was often mentioned to me under
the name of Pukunui?so called from the abnormal size of its
stomach. It was described as a reddish bird, frequenting
swamps and marshes, and I was constantly hearing of it.
Indeed, I never made an excursion among the Maoris any-
where without making diligent inquiry for the Pukunui, so
much so that the older men thought I had Pukunui on the
brain. I offered liberal rewards, and often felt that the bird
was almost within my grasp. At length, at the small bush
settlement of Mareikura, on the North Wairoa River, one was
caught at the edge of a raupo swamp near the village by my
trusty lieutenant, Tamati Nui. It had been taken unhurt,


and, pending an opportunity of forwarding it to me, it was
kept tethered by a flax-string in the marae or open court-
yard. A passing Maori unconsciously snapped the string
with his foot, and, unfortunately for me and for science, this
? rara avis in terris ? made its escape. More than forty years
have elapsed since this occurrence, and I have never so much
as heard of the capture of another Pukunui!
In this connection, and also as marking the tendency
towards extinction in certain lines, it is of interest to notice
that the Ralline genus Notornis was contemporary with the
smaller species of Moa, and that the bones of the living bird
obtained in Otago differ so much from those of the fossil
remains discovered by Mr. Walter Mantell at Waingongoro,
in the North Island, and referrred by Professor Owen to a
form which he named Notornis mantelli, in honour of the
discoverer, that Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, proposes to
discriminate two species, distinguishing the southern form as
Notornis hochstetteri, in compliment to the Austrian explorer.
Assuming Dr. Meyer to be right in his determination, we
have here a beautiful instance of representation, the North
Island species having long since disappeared, whilst the South
Island species is verging on extinction.
I think I have now noticed all the main points bearing on
this question arising out of a study of the birds of the North
and South Islands. But it is to the smaller insular areas
that we naturally look for the strongest proofs in support of
our theory, because the conditions there are altogether more
favourable. Let us first take the Chatham Islands, lying
about four hundred miles to the south-east of Wellington.
It is very clear that there has been no land communication
between the Chathams and New Zealand since the con-
tinental submergence. This has allowed time for the pro-
duction by natural selection and the survival of the fittest
of several distinct species. Now, let us see what we have.
Notably, a new species of Bell-bird (Anthornis melanocephaja)
has come into existence?a much larger and finer species
than our Korimako (Anthornis melanura), although presenting
the same adolescent and sexual phases of plumage. But the
curious thing about it is that, side by side with this endemic
species, our Bell-bird is also to be found in the Chatham
Islands and on the adjacent islets (Pitt Island and Mangare).
To my mind the only explanation of this is the same that I
have given in a former paper (Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxiv.,
p. 65) for the occurrence side by side of Platycercus unicolor
and Platycercus erythrotis on Antipodes Island?namely, that
the smaller species owes its existence there to a corapara-
tively-recent colonization, the result of some accidental flight
or migration from the mainland, ?with this difference : that in


the case of Platycercus erythrotis the irruption of the parent
form must have been long anterior to the colonization, so to
speak, of the Chatham Islands by the New Zealand Bell-bird,
inasmuch as there has been time for a sufficient modification
of characters to entitle it (in the opinion of many ornitholo-
gists) to take specific rank, distinct from Platycercus novce-
zealandice. As to such occasional migrations there would be
nothing in the distance, at any rate, to negative such a sup-
position. Then, again, we have a Wood-pigeon ( Carpophaga
chathamiensis ) very similar to the New Zealand bird, but
sufficiently differentiated to be accepted as a good species.
Other representative forms are the Black Robin ( Miro traversi),
the Bush Warbler ( Gerygone albofrontata) , and the Chatham
Island Fern-bird ( Sphenoeacus rufescens). The near relatives
of all these are to be found in New Zealand. But, instead of
Ocydromus, there is a small flightless rail ?a degenerate Ocy-
dromine form?which Professor Hutton has made the type of
a new genus, Cabalas modestus. To this genus (although the
form is less aberrant from the typical JRallus) I have referred
Dieffenbach?s Rail, which is now extinct, the only known
example being the one in the British Museum, obtained about
the year 1815.
So far as we are aware no bones of Dinornis have yet been
discovered in the Chatham Islands, but I have no doubt that
they will be sooner or later ; and I feel pretty sure that when
discovered they will be found to be of different species (per-
haps of different genera) from those known to have inhabited
New Zealand in comparatively recent times : that is to say,
our theory seems to require, for the sake of consistency, that
this should be so, inasmuch as the same differentiation would
be taking place in the Chatham Islands as in the other in-
sular areas after the great submergence. And, as the Chat-
ham Islands unquestionably formed part of that ancient
continental area of which I have been speaking, we may
reasonably expect to find there, sooner or later, fpssil remains
of the earlier forms (such as Palapteryx), similar to those that
have been unearthed in the North and South Islands of New
Zealand. As to the remarkable avian remains recently dis-
covered by Mr. H. 0. Forbes in the Chatham Islands, and
referred by him to a genus allied to Archceopteryx, we may
feel equally assured that similar remains exist in New Zea-
land, and will hereafter be found in abundance to reward the
diligent explorer.
The Auckland Islands, again, offer several good examples.
Among the species specially developed there may be mentioned
a Ground-pipit ( Anthus auclclandicus), very readily distinguish-
able from our New Zealand bird by its rather larger size and
warmer colouring ; and a Green Parrakeet ( Platycercus auck-


landicus), much smaller, but in other respects similar to our
Platycercus novce-zeatandice. Representing our Ballus philip-
pensis, there is a very distinct species of Rail {Ballus muelleri,
Rothschild), of which the only known specimen is in the
Natural History Museum at Stuttgart; and, as if representing
our Anas chlorotis, there is a flightless Duck ( Nesonetta auck-
landica) frequenting the seashore as well as the streams. But,
what is still more significant and curious, there exists in the
Auckland Islands a species of Merganser {Mergus australis), of
which there is no representative in New Zealand, or indeed
anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere. The Bell-bird is
there also, but it seems to be absolutely identical with the New
Zealand form {Anthornis melanura ), showing, as I think, a
comparatively recent introduction.
On Antipodes Island, as already indicated, there is a
strictly endemic Parrakeet (. Platycercus unicolor ), a species
living abundantly on this oceanic rock, but not to be met with
in any other part of the world, and commingling with a species
{Platycercus erythrotis) more nearly approaching to the typical
Platycercus novce-zealandice. Going further south we come to
Macquarie Island, where there is a Rail differing sq, perceptibly
from ordinary examples of Ballus philippensis that Professor
Hutton has proposed to distinguish it as Ballus macquariensis;
and, although I am not prepared to concede to it distinct rank
as a species, its presence there is another proof of the existence
of transitional forms. It is an inexplicable fact, however, that
on the same island is to be found the flightless Ocydromus earli,
differing in no respect from examples obtained in New Zealand
and on Stewart Island. *
On the Snares, a group of islets about seventy miles south
of the southernmost extremity of New Zealand, there is a
peculiar form of Fern-bird, which I have recently distinguished
under the name of Sphenceacus caudatus, very similar to
Sphenceacus punctatus of New Zealand, but quite distinct as a
species, and being intermediate in character between the last-
named bird and Sphenceacus rufescens of the Chatham Islands.
Now, no ornithologist who has studied the subject can doubt
that these three closely-allied forms, although now perfectly
distinct as species, have sprung from a common parent-form.
Curiously enough, another Chatham Island bird, the Black
Robin {Miro traversi ) is abundant on the Snares, although not
found in any part of New Zealand.
* Since the above was written I have had from Captain Fairchild
what seems to be a sufficient explanation of this. He states that, about
the year 1830, Captain Gilroy (who is still living at the Bluff) was first
mate of a small sealing vessel visiting the Macquaries, and that, in order
to provide another source of food-supply, he brought a number of live
Woodhens from New Zealand and turned them loose there.


Then, again, the Kermadec Islands possess a Green Parra-
keet which Mr. Rothschild declares to be distinct; and,
although many naturalists will insist that this and the other
island forms are, for the most part, local varieties of the well-
known Platycercus nova-zealandia, their very existence as
such is the best evidence of the constant operation of the law
of development by variation and the survival of the fittest.
Even the sea-birds, whose range is practically unrestricted,
furnish additional and, indeed, very important evidence. Mr,
Rothschild, with the aid of Mr. Salvin, our great authority on
the Petrel family, has lately been investigating the Albatroses
of the Southern Hemisphere. Talking over the result with
me, he said, ? Why, every group of islands seems to have its
own species of Albatros! ? And, in a sense, this is true.
Here we have birds enjoying the freedom of the wide ocean ?
commingling daily on their great hunting-fields on the face of
the deep; and then, on the approach of the reproductive
season, separating themselves, according to their species, and
repairing to their own island-nurseries to breed. As far as
our information at present goes, Campbell Island is held ex-
clusively by my Diomedea regia, the noblest member of the
group. The Auckland Islands are occupied by thousands of
Diomedea exulans, with the exception of a small colony of the
former breeding in a remote corner of the main island, and at
a somewhat earlier season ?according to Captain Fairchild?s
observations, four or five weeks earlier. On the Snares Dio-
medea salvini (hitherto known here as Diomedea cauta) reigns
supreme. The Albatros breeding on the Sisters, some outlying
islands in the Chatham group, on which the Maoris are said
to have collected as many as a thousand young birds in one
season, is probably Diomedea melanophrys, which is plentiful
in that latitude ; but I have not yet been able to obtain any
specimens from that locality for identification. The breeding-
place of Diomedea bulleri, Rothschild (hitherto confounded with
Diomedea culminata ), I have not yet discovered, all the speci-
mens of that form known to us (some twenty in number)
having been captured off the Otago coast.
Many of the smaller species of Petrel, it may be observed,
confine themselves to particular islands : for example, Puffinus
carneipes is the commonest of birds on the Island of Karewa,
in the Bay of Plenty, but, so far as I am aware, has never
been found breeding on any other island off our coast.
As with the Petrels, so in a limited sense with the Shags
and Penguins, many of the species of both having their par-
ticular island group, which they resort to, for breeding pur-
poses, to the exclusion of all others.
Finally I may refer to the Snipes, the local distribution
of which is very remarkable indeed. My Gallinago pusilla,


the smallest of the Snipes, is an inhabitant of the Chatham
Islands, where it is apparently very plentiful, Mr. Rothschild
having, as he informs me, received from his collector, in one
lot, fifty-four specimens. Sir James Hector has recorded two
specimens from New Zealand, but it is evidently only a
straggler with us. Galli?iago aucklandica appears to be con-
fined to the Auckland Islands, Gallinago tristrami to An-
tipodes Island, and Gallinago huegeli to the Snares. It will
be seen therefore that these island-species are very sedentary ;
and they have no doubt acquired their distinctive characters
through long isolation. Whether they are accepted by all
ornithologists as true species or only as local varieties does
not affect in the slightest degree the force of our argument in
favour of the creation of new forms by a process of descent
with modification. But I have probably pursued this branch
of the subject quite far enough. There is another aspect of
the question upon which I should like to say a few words
before I close.
I have always stated my belief that our colossal forms of
Dinornis were the most ancient and were the first to become
extinct. Those on which the Moa-hunters feasted (as attested
by the remains now found in the old kitchen-middens) were
confessedly of a smaller stature. Probably the very last to
disappear was the small Mesopteryx didinus. In 1878 Mr.
Squires, of Queenstown, obtained and sent to the British
Museum the head, with a continuous part of the neck, of this
species of Moa, with the trachea enclosed and covered by the
dried integument, and exhibiting even the sclerotic bone-ring
of the dried eye-balls; also the bones of both legs with the
feet covered by the dried skin, with some feathers adhering to
it, and with the claws intact. Be that as it may, the only
representatives of this Struthious race we have at the present
day are the diminutive Kiwis, of which I have been treating.
This remarkable sequence in the development of animal life
on the earth, the larger forms preceding in geological time the
smaller, appears to have been universal. The distinguishing
feature of the Mesozoic period was the development of Sau-
rians of marvellous size. From the Oolitic beds in the Rocky
Mountains of North America the remains of huge Dinosau-
rians have been obtained, among these being the Atlaniosaurus,
the largest land animal yet known to have existed on the
earth; for Professor Marsh describes it as ?having been be-
tween 50ft. and 60ft. long, and, when standing erect, at least
30ft. high! ? At the present day our largest saurians are
crocodiles and alligators. But, coming down to Pliocene and
Pleistocene times, we have only to think of the mammoth and
the mastodon, the dinotheriura and the megatherium, the
diprotodon and the Irish elk, and compare them with the


elephant and the hippopotamus, the rhinoceros and the
buffalo, of the present epoch, to realise the full force of this
truth. But these revolutions in the animal world have, in
both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere, been ac-
companied by corresponding alterations on the earth?s surface,
and by climatic changes of a very extensive kind. To give
one illustration: The mammoth was an animal which sub-
sisted on herbage and vegetation of all kinds ; and, looking to
its unchecked and ever-increasing numbers, it would clearly
have required a growth of tropical luxuriance to satisfy the
wants of its capacious stomach. But where do we now find
the remains of these ancient herbivora ? Not buried in tro-
pical regions, but frozen and embalmed amid the eternal
snows of Siberia, where they have been preserved intact for
thousands of years. What a revolutionary change of climate
do these facts imply ! And how sudden must have been the
translation from ultra-tropical verdure to the utter desolation
of Arctic frigidity when the entombment and refrigeration of
these herb-eating leviathans took place fresh from their feed-
ing-grounds !
But now let me give another illustration nearer home?one
drawn from the recent discoveries of Dr. Stirling, F.R.S., in
South Australia, the importance of which, from a scientific
point of view, it would be impossible to overestimate. I will
shortly state the facts so far as they have yet become known.
In the central part of South Australia there is a vast stony
desert lying to the eastward of Lake Frome and to the west-
ward of the Grey Range. It is described as being unspeakably
arid and desolate, abounding in salt-pans, of which Lake
Mulligan is the largest. This forbidding district is entirely
destitute of fresh water and almost absolutely devoid of
animal life of any kind. The intrepid explorer, Captain
Sturt, in 1844 penetrated about half-way across this inhospit-
able plain, and then, after suffering great hardships, had to
make his way out of it to escape absolute starvation. Up to
the present time this region has been to all intents and pur-
poses a sealed book. But a few months ago an important dis-
covery of fossil bones was made at Lake Mulligan, and, chiefly
through the scientific enterprise of Dr. Stirling (aided all
through by the generous liberality of Sir Thomas Elder), this
discovery has been followed up with very astonishing results.
A correspondent of the Scotsman, waiting on the spot and from
his own knowledge and observations, states that, after four
months? digging among the gravels of the valley of the Mulli-
gan, some two thousand bones, representing seventy different
mammals and birds hitherto unknown, have been unearthed,
and safely lodged in the South Australian Museum at Adelaide.
This collection comprises the first complete skeleton of Dipro-


todon australis, a gigantic marsupial considerably exceeding
the rhinoceros in size, the remains of a giant wombat as large
as a half -grown bullock, several kinds of colossal birds
equalling in stature the Moa of New Zealand, and several
species of gigantic kangaroos ! The writer?s reflection is as
follows : ? What a different picture of the past history of this
country is brought to light by these discoveries ! On the sides
of these mountains lying between Lake Frome and Lake
Torrens must have grown huge trees, and all around there
must _ have been a dense tropical growth, exceeding in
luxuriance the forests of the eastern slopes of the Andes in
South America ! ?
Commenting on this remarkable sequence of animal life on
the earth at different periods of its history in the same
geographical areas, Sir John Lubbock observes, ? Our pre-
historic ancestors hunted the mammoth, the woolly-haired
rhinoceros, and the Irish elk; the ancient Britons had the
wild ox, the deer, and the wolf. We have still the pheasant,
the partridge, the fox, and the hare; but even these are
becoming scarcer, and must be preserved first in order that
they may be killed afterwards.?
X fear I have already trespassed too long on your kind
indulgence, but the subject is a very seductive one, and, in
treating of it, however briefly, it is difficult to keep within the
ordinary limits of an address. But just one word in con-
clusion. As you will have gathered from the views I have
had the privilege of placing before you this evening, I am a
thorough disciple of Darwinism in the higher sense of that
term. I do not think it is possible to explain on any other
hypothesis the wonderful variety and complexity of living
forms that inhabit this beautiful world of ours. We must, as
it seems to me, acknowledge with the author of ? The Origin
of Species,? in one of his later works, that ? man, with all his
noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most de-
based, with benevolence which extends not only to other men
but to the humblest living creature, with his godlike intellect
which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of
the solar system?with all these exalted powers, man still
bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly
origin.? I do not accept, however, as many do, the purely
materialistic theory, because I am a believer in the truths of
revelation and in the spiritual destiny of man. As that of a
humble worker in the field of science, earnestly seeking the
truth, this is, so to speak, my confession of faith ï¿½as a
naturalist. To adopt Mr. Wallace?s admirable language on
this point, I am ? thus relieved from the crushing mental
burden imposed upon those who maintaining that we, in
common with the rest of nature, are but products of the blind


eternal forces of the universe, and believing also that the time
must come when the sun will lose his heat, and all life on the
earth necessarily cease ?have to contemplate a not very
distant future in which all this glorious earth ?which for
untold millions of years has been slowly developing forms of
life and beauty, to culminate at last in man?shall be as if it
had never existed; who are compelled to suppose that all the
slow growths of our race struggling towards a higher life, all the
agony of martyrs, all the groans of victims, all the evil and
misery and undeserved suffering of the ages, all the struggles
for freedom, all the efforts towards justice, all the aspirations
for virtue and the well-being of humanity, shall absolutely
vanish, and, ? like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a
wrack behind.? As contrasted with this hopeless and soul-
deadening belief, we, who accept the existence of a spiritual
world, can look upon the universe as a grand consistent whole,
adapted in all its parts to the development of spiritual beings,
capable of indefinite life and perfectibility. . . . We thus
feel that the Darwinian theory, even when carried out to its
extreme logical conclusion, not only does not oppose but lends
a decided support to a belief in the spiritual nature of man.
It shows how man?s body may have been developed from that
of a lower animal form under the law of natural selection; but
it also teaches us that we possess intellectual and moral
faculties which could not have been so developed, but must
have had another origin ; and for this origin we can only find
an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit.?
Art. IY. ? Notes on the Ornithology of New Zealand; with
an Exhibition of Bare Specimens.
By Sir Walter L. Bullbr, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.R.S., &c.
\_Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society , 25th July , 1894.]
When I had the pleasure of reading a paper before you on the
13th July, 1892, I referred to the steps that had been taken
by Mr. Ballance?s Ministry, at the instance of our late
Governor, Lord Onslow, towards preserving the native avi-
fauna of New Zealand by setting apart island reserves and
placing them under strict supervision. Having taken an
active interest in these steps myself, naturally my first inquiry
on returning to the colony, in March last, was as to how far
the good intentions of the Government had been carried into
-effect. I was indeed glad to find that the negotiations for


the complete acquisition of the Little Barrier Island were being
pushed forward, and with every prospect of speedy success,
and that both there and on Resolution Island a custodian or
ranger was being maintained by the Government. It is dis-
heartening, however, to learn from the last report of the
Auckland Institute that ?in the meantime several natives
and Europeans are living on the island, fires have been
allowed to spread, and in the last week of January of this
year a serious one was reported, which lasted at least a week.?
It is also alleged in the report that ??the island has been
visited by collectors, and specimens of the very birds which it
was hoped might survive have been shot and brought to Auck-
land. I understand that effective steps are now being taken
to pi event such depredations for the future. And, from what
I can gather in the department, there is every reason to hope
that within a measurable time the last of the native owners
will have been settled with, and the private title extinguished.
The whole of the island will then be Crown land, and will be
under more effective control. All over the scientific world the
action of the Government in this matter has been applauded.
The efforts now being made, whether in the end completely
successful or not, will in any case save us from the reproaches
of posterity. If they should prove successful, as I believe they
I venture to think that this service to science will bring
credit and praise to the present Government when many
their more ambitious schemes and projects have been buried
and forgotten. But it must be borne in mind that the conserva-
tion of the two islands I have named is only a partial carry-
ing-out of Lord Onslow s recommendations and of the decision
come to by the Government in 1892. The original proposal
was not merely to protect the birds already existing on the
two island reserves, notably the Stitchbird and the Whitehead
on the Little Barrier, and Notornis mantelli, Kiwis, and
Kakapos on Resolution Island ; but that many other ? birds
now living on the mainland, although becoming scarcer every
year, should be systematically trapped from time to time and
turned loose upon the islands. In addition to a further supply
of Kiwis and Kakapos, of the different species, the birds
specially marked out for these attentions were the Huia
(Heteralocha acutirostris ) and the Blue-wattled Crow (Glau-
copis wilsoni ) in the North Island, and the Thick-billed
Thrush {Turnagra crassirostris ) and the Orange-wattled Crow
(Glaucopis cinerea) in the South Island. This could be done
now, and at comparatively trifling cost; but every year it will
become more difficult. It has now become a truism that the
rarer New Zealand birds are passing away and will soon be
extinct. But even species that were formerly very abundant
all over the country are following suit, not only on the main-


land but on the small islands where the conditions of exist-
ence are so much more favourable. Mr. W. Hawkins, the well-
known collector, writing to me from the Chatham Islands in
August last, savs, ?The Fern-bird (Sphenoeacusrufescens)
and the Black Eobin ( Miro traversi) are gone. The Mako-
mako and Cahalus modestus are going fast; and the Eigeon
too In fact Pitt Island is the only place where Pigeons and
Bell-birds are to be got. ... On the Sisters ten years
ao-o the Maoris got a thousand Albatroses; last year they got
only three hundred and fifty. They say that if I go there
I?ll frighten the Albatros away altogether, so they have abso-
lutely prohibited my collecting there.
I shall now proceed to place before you my customary
budget of ornithological notes. Dr. Sclater, the accomplished
editor of the Ibis] has referred in terms of commendation
to my practice of exhibiting at our meetings here the more
important of the specimens to which the observations refer.
I shall continue this practice, because it tends to keep up the
interest of members in what is being done in this depaitment
of science. It is quite a mistake to suppose that because ex-
haustive works have appeared on the birds of New Zealand
nothing remains to be done by the ordinary obseivei. In
opposition to such a view, I may mention that since the publi-
cation of my last edition of ? The Birds of New Zealand,? in
1888, I have, through the medium of these periodical notes
(without including those contained in the present paper),
added no less than ten species to the list of our birds, recorded
thirtv-four albinisms and other abnormal varieties, and made
original observations, more or less important, on eighty-four
ordinary species. Others have been working in the same
direction, and registering interesting facts, the most important
of these contributions being a paper on the birds of the Chat-
ham Islands by Mr. H. O. Forbes, which appeared (with two
excellent illustrations) in the Ibis for October, 1893.
Heteralocha acutirostris, Gould. (Huia.)
Sir John Lubbock, in his charming volume ? The Beauties
of Nature,? in an account of what he terms the Hura (mean-
ing of course the Huia), pp. 48, 49, makes two mistakes. In
the first place he calls it a Crow, whereas it has been proved
to be a Starling ; and, in discussing the curious modification of
the bill in the two sexes and its use, he says, ? When the
cock has dug down to the burrow the hen inserts her long bill
and draws out the grub, which they then divide between them ?
the italics are mine?? a very pretty illustration of the wife
as helpmate to the husband.?
Now, I believe I was the first to observe and record the
peculiar ?adaptation of the Huia?s bill to its habits of life, in a


paper which I read before this Society in 1870, describing the
conduct of a pair of live birds then in my possession (Trans.
N.Z. Inst., vol. hi., pp. 24-29). But I had previously told Sir
George Grey all about it, and he, with his usual felicity of
expression, told the story at a meeting of the Zoological
Society on his return to England. It seems a pity to destroy
the pretty sentiment of the case as put by Sir John Lubbock,
but science is inexorable, and the truth must be upheld.
What I stated in my record of observations was this: ? The
very different development of the mandibles in the two sexes
enabled them to perform separate offices. The male always
attacked the more decayed portions of the wood, chiselling out
his prey after the manner of some woodpeckers, while the
female probed with her long pliant bill the other cells, where
the hardness of the surrounding parts resisted the chisel of
her mate. Sometimes I observed the male remove the decayed
portion without being able to reach the grub, when the female
would at once come to his aid, and accomplish, with her long
slender bill, what he had failed to do. I noticed, however,
that the female always appropriated to her own use the
morsels thus obtained.? I am sorry that the stern truth
detracts from the poetry of Sir John Lubbock?s narration.
Creadion carunculatus, Gmelin. (Saddleback.)
Irom Stephen Island, in Cook Strait, I received last
year a fresh specimen, which was interesting as being in the
full ? saddleback plumage, although a very young bird. It
has very small caruncles, and a narrow yellow membrane at
the angles of the mouth. The plumage is somewhat duller
than in the adult, but the distribution of colours is the same.
Such a specimen as this, which is still in my collection,?
establishes beyond all doubt the validity of CTeadion cineveus
as a distinct species.
Miro traversi, Buller. (Black Eobin.)
The young of this species has the plumage slightly tinged
with brown, and the feathers of the underparts have obscure
margins.
Anthus aucklandicus, G. R. Gray. (Auckland-Island Pipit.)
In the Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxi., p. 388, Mr. Eeischek
after consultation with Professor Thomas and Mr. Cheeseman,
described a new Ground-lark or Pipit from Antipodes
and named it Anthus steindachneri, after the Director of the
Imperial Museum at Vienna. I have not seen the type, but
the description of the bird given by Mr. Eeischek indicates no
difference between this bird and Anthus aucklandicus
3


Rhipidnra flabellifera, Gmelin. (Pied Fantail.)
In October, 1880, during a storm-bound visit to Motutaiko,
in the Taupo Lake, I found the nest of this species, with four
eggs in it, secured very neatly to a twig of kawakawa ( Piper
excelsum), a tree to which, as I have observed, the Fantail is
very partial for nesting purposes. We had made our camp-fire
immediately under the nest before discovering it, and, although
we remained there several hours, the birds did not appear to
be in any way inconvenienced by the volume of smoke that
came from the driftwood fire, and enveloped them completely
from time to time. Both sexes incubate in turn. There
could be no mistake in this observation, because one of the
birds had lost its tail, and could be readily distinguished from
the other.
Rhipidura fuliginosa, Sparrm. (Black Fantail.)
On a recent visit to Papaitonga, I was much pleased to see
a fine specimen of this South Island species in a clump of
native bush near the homestead. It was associating with the
Pied Fantail, which is particularly numerous in that locality.
It was appreciably larger in size, and was in beautiful plumage,
the white ear-spots being very conspicuous.
Mr. J. C. McLean, of Gisborne, in the Ibis for January
last, gives an interesting account of the interbreeding in that
district of a female bird of this species with a male of
B. flabellifera. There were two eggs in the nest taken, and
Mr. McLean thinks they are richer in colour than the ordi-
nary egg of the Pied Fantail, ?the spots being of a purplish
tint, while in eggs of the pied bird they are brownish.?
Petrochelidon nigricans, Yieill. (Australian Tree-swallow.)
Several instances have been recorded of the occurrence in
New Zealand of flights of the Australian Tree-swallow. Mr.
H. Guthrie-Smith, writing to me from Tutiri Lake, on the
20th August, 1893, says, ?While up at the Mahia last week,
I observed some birds like Martins or Swallows. They have
been there for some weeks, I believe. They were flying high
above some blossoming gum-trees when they were first pointed
out to me. It was a dark afternoon; but, as far as I could
see, their tails were not forked. I should be much obliged if
you could tell me to what species they belong. Could they be
a flight of Hirundo nigricans ? ?
Mr. James Dali, of Collingwood, also writes to me, under
date of the 25th June, 1893, ? During this spring, summer,
and autumn there have been large numbers of Australian
Swallows or Martins visiting New Zealand?apparently all
parts, as I see by a late Canterbury Times that a pair have
built a nest and are hatching young ones in a mill about


Oamaru, where they are being greatly cared for by every one.
In the spring of 1892 flocks of two or three dozen were
observed in the neighbourhood of Cape Farewell.? I have no
doubt these visitants are referable to the above species. (See
? Birds of New Zealand,? 2nd ed., vol. i., pp. 74-76.)
Prosthemadera novse-zealandise, Gmelin. (Tui.)
On examining a series of ten eggs I find that they vary a
good deal both as to shape and colouring. For the most part
they are of a narrow ovoido-elhptical form, with a very pro-
nounced smaller end, but a few of them are less acuminate,
and one is broadly ovoid. A typical one measures F2sin. by
0-80 in.; the more rounded one I have mentioned measures
lT2sin. by 088 in. This is almost entirely "White, with only a
few indistinct, widely-scattered, rusty or pale-red spots towards
the larger end. The most highly-coloured example is of a
delicate creamy-white or salmon tint, the larger end darker
and thickly spotted and dotted with pale brown, these mark-
ings forming an indistinct zone. Two other eggs are almost
exactly similar to this one, but with a paler ground, and all
three are probably from one nest. Another set of three have
scattered, somewhat obscure pale-brown markings over the
entire surface. The three remaining ones (presumably from
one nest) are white, with here and there a speck of pale
brown, chiefly at the larger end.
Anthornis melanura, Sparrm. (Korimako.)
At 7 p.m. on the 26th October we left Tokanu for Tapuae-
haruru in a four-oared boat, manned by a good crew of Armed
Constabulary. It was a beautiful, calm day, and the surface
of the lake was a perfect mirror. Five miles from land we
could still hear the hollow boom of the Bittern, and the bark-
ing of the curs in the Maori village. There was not a breath
of air to cause a ripple on the bosom of the lake, and the
rock-bound margin of Motutaiko danced in the mirage of the
morning sun. _ Our men were settling down to a long pull of
twenty-five miles, and we had just arranged to make straight
for Motutaiko and rest there for an al fresco lunch, when the
seaman Todd, who was in charge of the crew, pointed to
an advancing ripple from the southward; and, without a
moment?s warning, we were overtaken by a squall which in-
creased in fury with amazing rapidity. Within the brief
space of five minutes, instead of dreamily rowing on the placid
waters, we were pitching and tossing in an angry sea?the
rudder was powerless, and the oarsmen had the utmost diffi-
culty in keeping the boat?s head on. We shipped several
heavy seas, and_ struggled on for hours, sometimes drifting, at
others just holding our own, as the storm varied in force, the


men all pulling with desperate strength, knowing that to relax
for a moment meant swamping and destruction to us all; tor
the best swimmer could not long have survived a capsize in
such a sea, and with the atmosphere and water so intensely
cold. After some four hours of unflagging labour, a lull m
the storm enabled us to get under the lee of Motutaiko; but
half an hour after we had landed, in a little rocky cove on the
western side of the island, the storm redoubled in force, and
for some hours such a gale blew as had not been^ witnessed in
the lake for years. The ?little white horses? of the sea
chased each other in quick succession, and the spray rose in
clouds as the winds swept over the tempestuous waters. Of
course the first consideration on reaching land was a sense of
gratitude at having escaped from a very perilous position; but
I was delighted on landing to hear on all sides the silvery
notes of the Korimako. As is well known, this little songster,,
which formerly was so abundant everywhere, has for a long
time past been practically extinct in the North Island. At
the time of this visit to Motutaiko it had not been heard of
for several vears on the mainland, although it was known to
exist on certain islands off the coast, such as the Little
Barrier in the Hauraki Gulf, and the Island of Kapiti in Cook
Strait; and the generally-accepted theory had been that the
chief factor in its extermination was the introduced rat. That
certainly was my own belief. But a fact now came to my
knowledge which seemed to tell very much against that
theory. It was this : The island on which Iso unexpectedly
met with the Bell-bird is famous for its rats. It is covered
with pohutukawa trees and koromiko scrub, and the whole
island swarms with rats. The ground is in places almost
honeycombed with their burrows, for in one spot I counted
no less than five holes within a radius of eighteen inches. So
numerous were they that Topia Turoa had found it necessary
to turn some cats adrift on the island to reduce their numbers
before he could put in a crop of potatoes on one of the slopes;
and wdnd-bound boats lying in the little sandy cove at night
have, it is said, been invaded by multitudes of rats and had
all their provisions carried off.
Then, again, as to the rat theory, it is a significant fact
that, although the Korimako has disappeared from the North
Island, it has continued to exist in the South Island, although
in somewhat diminished numbers; and, so far as lam aware,
the introduced rat is as plentiful there as in the North. There
may be destructive causes in operation of which we have no
present knowledge.
I lately had an opportunity of examining a collection of
twenty-three eggs of this species, all from the South Island.
I made the following notes They vary only very slightly in


size, but exhibit a considerable amount of variation in the
markings. In most of them the ground-colour is white, in
others it is suffused with a delicate pinky blush. Some have
the larger end smeared and the rest of the surface irregularly
spotted with rusty-brown; in others the brown markings
form an indistinct zone; in some the brown is concentrated
at the larger pole, the rest of the shell being entirely free from
markings. In some specimens these markings are irregular,
being streaky or blotchy; in others they are rounded dots,
being more or less confluent at the pole. Their colour varies
from a dull umber-brown to a warm reddish-brown. In a few
of them the markings are distributed over the entire surface
in the form of minute speckles, without any appearance of a
zone or any congestion at the larger pole. Two that I
selected for the purpose measured, respectively, OToin. by
0 - 625 in. and 0 - 88 in. by 0 - 55 in., both being slightly pyriform.
Pogonornis cincta, Gray. (Stitch-bird.)
I have lately had an opportunity of examining a large
series of specimens collected for Mr. Spencer on the Little
Barrier Island, before that last resort of this species came
under Government protection. The young male has exactly
similar plumage to that of the adult female, except that there
is a broad spot of canary-yellow near the bend of the wing.
When the first moult commences this expands into a con-
spicuous band on the humerus, after which there is a gradual
change of the body-plumage. I have described in ? The
Birds of New Zealand ? a beautiful specimen in the Auckland
Museum in a transitional state of plumage.
Halcyon vagans, Lesson. (Kingfisher.)
I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Taylor White, of
Hawke?s Bay, for the opportunity of exhibiting this evening a
lovely specimen of our Kingfisher. It is a perfect albino,
every feather being of the purest white, and the whiteness ex-
tending even to the bill and feet.
Nestor meridionalis, Gmelin. (Kaka.)
This fine parrot is far less plentiful than it formerly was,
and this is the inevitable result of settlement and the conse-
quent destruction of the forests. In districts where formerly
it existed in thousands its scream is never heard, and to many
of the new settlers the bird is quite unknown. It is semi-
nocturnal in its habits, and towards evening becomes very
animated, flying over the trefe-tops in an excited manner,
generally in parties of three, uttering its harsh scream. This
changes to a soft musical whistle as the birds alight; and, in
doing this, they always select, as a post of observation, the


withered top of some aged tree, always climbing to the highest
limbs, their progression being by a succession of short hops.
Platycercus novse-zealandise, Sparrm. (Red-fronted Parra-
keet.)
At Tapuaeharuru, on the Taupo Lake, I saw a fine caged
example of this species in which the crown and sides of the
head had a wash of yellow over the green.
Platycercus erythrotis, Wagler.
Prom a specimen received by the ? Hinemoa,? on her
recent visit to Antipodes Island, I am able to give the
measurements of this species: Length, 17in.; extent of
wings, 12in.; wing from flexure, 5 - 75 in.; tail, Gin.; bill,
along the ridge 09in., along the edge of lower mandible o?6in.;
tarsus, 09in.; longer foretoe and claw, L2sin. It proved, on
dissection, to be a male.
Count Salvador! is of opinion that this species should be
regarded as Platycercus hochstetteri (cf. Salvad., Cat. B. 8.M.,
xx., p. 577), Platycercus erythrotis being the representative
form on Macquarie Island. I have never seen the British
Museum example mentioned by Dr. Finsch in his ? Die
Papageien,? vol. ii., p. 275; but he treats it as a mere
synonym of Platycercus novee-zealandioe. In any case there
seems to be much uncertainty about the origin of this speci-
men ; and Captain Fairchild informs me that he has been
unable to get any evidence as to the existence of a Parrakeet
on Macquarie Island.
Platycercus unicolor, Vigors. (Antipodes Island Parrakeet.)
I take this opportunity of exhibiting an egg of this species
which was laid by a captive bird on board the ? Hinemoa ? on
her last voyage from the islands. As will be seen, it is per-
fectly white, with a smooth surface, and almost spherical in
shape, measuring lin. in length by 09in. in extreme width.
Circus gouldi, Bonap. (Harrier.)
Although the Bush-hawk has almost entirely disappeared
from all the settled districts, the Harrier maintains its ground,
and is extremely abundant on some of the sheep-runs. At
Papaitonga my son lately saw one with a perfectly white
head, but it was very shy, and he was unable to shoot it.
These hawks are in the habit of hunting along the shores of
the lake, and are a perpetual tqrror to the young ducks. They
are destructive also to the eggs of birds nesting in the sedge,
on one occasion no less than fifteen eggs being taken from a
goose?s nest. They are bold enough, too, in their manner of
attack. One day I saw three or four large Sea-shags ( Phala-


crocorax novce-hollandia) perched on the naked branches of a
lofty matai near the edge of the lake, looking very fine as
they balanced their bodies against the blue sky beyond.
Presently a Harrier appeared in sight, and, without a mo-
ment?s hesitation, swooped down on the group of Shags, and
they, much to my surprise, instead of showing fight, made
precipitately for the water. On another occasion one of these
hawks made a determined attack on a flock of Black Teal
(Fuligula novce-zealandioe) well out on the lake. The ducks
splashed and dived, and evinced every sign of terror, and the
assailant kept up the pursuit for fully half an hour, but
without effect.
Apart from these depredations, I have reason to fear that
these hawks have been interfering with the Mallards and
other English birds recently placed by me on the Papaitonga
Lake.
Harpa ferox, Peale. (Bush-hawk.)
At Waipuna, in Hawke?s Bay, I saw, on the 17th March,
a young Bush Hawk boldly attack a litter of kittens, wfliilst
actually under the protection of the maternal cat! It seized
one of them and lifted it some feet in the air. The quarry
managed, how r ever, to disengage itself and dropped to the
ground. The hawk, which, from its size, I took to be a
female, then settled on the dry limb of a tree close by, ap-
parently to await another opportunity ; and there we left her,
balancing her body in an almost horizontal position, and loom-
ing large against the clear blue sky beyond.
Karpa novae-zealandiae. (Quail-hawk.)
The egg of this species is a very pretty object. I have now
four specimens before me. They are of uniform size, and
broadly ovoido-conical, measuring 2in. by l-4in. Pale-brown,
richly splashed and spotted over the entire surface with red-
dish-brown, especially at the larger end, where there is a
mixture of blackish-brown with the brighter colour.
Carpophaga novae-zealandiae, Gmelin. (Wood-pigeon.)
It is very regrettable to see how scarce this fine Wood-
pigeon is becoming in all the settled districts. Even as late
as 1880 it was extremely abundant in the Forty-mile Bush.
I find the following entry in my diary for April of that
year: ?
The Pigeon is now feeding on koroi, the small red berry
of the kahikatea, which is exceptionally abundant this year,
the trees by the roadside as we passed through the Forty-mile
Bush having a russet hue from the abundance of the ripe
fruit. The miro berry comes in next month, and the whanake


early in June. The pate (called ? patete ? by the Ngatika-
hungunu, and ? kotete? by the Ngatiraukawa) is now in fruit,
the long spikes or drupes of berries hanging in conspicuous
clusters along the edge of the forest. This, too, is a favourite
food of the Wood-pigeon at this season. The hoahou, which
has clusters of black berries, like the English elder-bush, con-
tributes likewise to the bountiful bill of fare ; so also does the
karamu ( Coprosma lucida), and a much larger kind, called
raurekau by the natives, producing a brighter-red berry, and
now in full bearing. The Tui and the Kaka also regale them-
selves at this season on these sweet berries.
The flight of the Wood-pigeon is rapid and direct at first,
then oblique and somewhat tumbling: that is to say, the bird
turns over first on one side, then on the other, in a very mea-
sured manner. The tail is partially spread during flight.
Many beautiful varieties of this fine Wood-pigeon have been
recorded from time to time, but there is a specimen in the
Colonial Museum of which no description has yet been pub-
lished. In this bird the plumage of the head, neck, breast,
and mantle is largely varied with pure white, which pre-
dominates on the neck, the normal bronzy plumage shining
out in the midst of it, especially on the breast, with a very
pretty effect; there are also a few scattered white feathers on
the wings and tail. This handsome bird was obtained at
Eketahuna, and presented to the Museum by Mr. R. R,
Greville.
There are two beautihfi specimens in the possession of Mr,
C. J. Robinson, of the Upper Hutt. One of these, shot by
himself on a miro tree at the summit of the western range,
opposite Wallaceville, in June, 1892, has the head, neck, and
breast, and the upper surface generally dull yellowish-brown,
shaded with darker; the primaries and tail-feathers clove-
brown, the latter darker; the higher interscapular region or
shoulders and the small wing-coverts rich vinous-brown ; some
of the outer coverts pale-brown with vinous edgings; the
whole of the under surface pure white. Bill and feet red. The
other bird was shot in the same spot about eight days later.
It is a lovely albino, the entire plumage being pure white, with
just the faintest tinge of cream, or, so to speak, another shade
of white on the breast; and on the smaller wing-coverts there
is a pale wash of cream. The primaries and tail-feathers are
pale cream with pure-white shafts. Bill and feet red.
A specimen which I lately received from Nelson has the
white of the underparts, especially along the junction with
the bronze plumage of the breast, washed with chrome-yellow,
and the under tail-coverts are entirely of that colour. It is
apparently an adult bird, and is marked ?female? by the
collector.


Carpophaga chathamiensis, Eoths. (Chatham Island Wood-
pigeon.)
I have very much pleasure in exhibiting this evening a
specimen of the new species of Pigeon mentioned by me in a
former paper,* as it is an excellent illustration of what I have
recently said about the developemenC of insular forms.
Gallinago pusilla, Buller. (Chatham-Island Snipe.)
Gallinago huegeli, Tristram. (Snares Snipe.)
The Bulletin of the British Ornithologists? Club for June,
1893, contains a communication from the Rev. Canon Tristram,
from which I extract the following: ?In the Ibis for 1869,
p. 41, Sir W. Buller described a second species [of Snipe]
from the Chatham Islands as Gallinago gmsilla. Very few
specimens have been received, but the species has twice been
obtained in New Zealand (to which it is evidently an occa-
sional wanderer); once by Sir James Hector, in the Gulf of
Hauraki, and once by Mr. F. B. Hill, on Little Barrier Island.
All doubts as to its being a distinct species have recently been
set at rest by the large number of specimens obtained in the
Chatham Islands by the collectors of the Hon. Walter Roth-
schild and Mr. H. 0. Forbes. I have examined more than
twenty specimens, and find that all of them agree in every
respect, and cannot be confused with the Auckland Island
species. But when Sir W. Buller published his second edition
of the ?Birds of New Zealand? he had, unfortunately, sent
back to New Zealand his only specimen from the Chatham
Islands, and borrowed from me a specimen which had been
obtained by Baron A. von Hfigel on the Snares, seventy
miles south of the southern extremity of New Zealand. This
I had put down as Gallinago pusilla, having at that time
never seen a Chatham Island specimen. It is very accurately
figured and coloured in Buller?s second edition ; but it proves
to be very different from the true G. pusilla. The only other
example in existence, so far as I am aware, is a second spe-
cimen obtained on the Snares at the same time by Baron A.
von Hfigel, and in the collection of the Hon. Walter Roth-
schild.?
Canon Tristram says, ? This species may at once be dis-
tinguished from its congeners by its much redder hue, and
especially by the remarkable fineness and delicacy of its
markings, the edgings of the upper plumage and the striation
and bands on the lower surface being much smaller, closer,
and more distinct. In the other two species ( Gallinago pusilla
and G. aucklandica) the abdomen and thighs are whitish, while
* Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxiv., p. 80.


in this they are thickly barred. In this species the three
outer tail-feathers on each side are attenuated, with a white
edging; in the others only the two outer pairs of tail-feathers
appear to be so attenuated.?
Gallinago tristrami, Eoths. (Antipodes-Island Snipe.)
I have much pleasure in exhibiting a specimen of this rare
Snipe, obtained on the last visit of the ? Hinemoa ? to Anti-
podes Island, and kindly lent to me by Mr. Bethune, the
second engineer.
In his communication relating to Gallinago huegeli, cited
above, Canon Tristram made the following remarks : ? There
would appear to be three species of Gallinago in the islands
round New Zealand: G. aucklandica in the Aucklands, G.
pusilla in the Chathams, and G. huegeli in the Snares, all being
sedentary, or nearly so, in their several localities. To these
further research will probably add a fourth from Antipodes
Island, wdience a single specimen has been received by Sir
James Hector, who states it to be larger, darker in plumage,
and with a more curved bill than the Auckland-Island species.
Unfortunately he has not described it.? Shortly after this
a specimen was obtained by the Hon. Walter Rothschild,
who described it at a meeting of the 8.0.C., and dedicated
it to Canon Tristram.
Larus dominicanus, Licht. (Black-backed Gull.)
Larus scopulinus, Forst. (Red-billed Gull.)
We have an excellent proof of the wisdom of protective
legislation in the numbers and increasing tameness of the Sea-
gulls that now frequent our harbours and estuaries. Not only
are these birds very ornamental as they rest on the wharves
and jetties, or hover lightly among the shipping at its anchor-
age, but they do good service to mankind as scavengers of the
water by devouring the garbage which will inevitably find its
way into the water in the vicinity of human habitations, and
which, unless consumed, decomposes, and vitiates the atmo-
sphere. On my last visit to Auckland I was much interested
at seeing scores of seagulls of both species ( Larus dominicanus
and L. scopitlinus ) crowded together on the ridge-boards of the
sheds on the Queen-street Wharf, in the very midst of the busy
traffic. After years of rigid protection the birds have become
quite familiar with the presence of man, and are, indeed,
practically domesticated. What will happen in the course of
time I saw exemplified at Glasgow, where hundreds of Kitti-
wake Gulls are to be seen all day long disporting themselves
in the turbid waters of the River Kelvin, as it flows through
the grounds in front of the Hunterian Museum. They are
just as fearless and confident as domestic fowls, being wholly


indifferent to the stream of passengers to and fro on both sides
of the river. I met with another instance of this at Blair-
quhan, the country seat of Sir Edward Hunter-Brown, Bart.
Here, owing to the close protection given to a small lake in
the park, a couple of hundred Wild-duck had become perfectly
tame, and would come up every day to the keeper?s house to
be fed. These same birds on being seen on the River Girvan
close by, where shooting is allowed, are as shy as ever. So
much for the intelligence of the common Wild-duck, which
has learned to regard the park lake as a sanctuary, where it is
perfectly safe from molestation ! But to return to the Sea-
gulls. The manner in which they have increased in Welling-
ton Harbour during the last few years, in spite of advancing
traffic, is a striking proof of the efficacy of this protection. At
Pitone, where the Gear Meat-freezing Works are situated,
there is of necessity a considerable discharge of refuse matter,
and the number of Seagulls, of both species, that congregate
there on the beaches and gravel-banks is something surprising.
On my last visit to Tokanu, on Lake Taupo, I noticed
many hundreds of birds flying overhead, and the natives
assured me these were the tarapunga ( Larus scopulinus) on
their regular migration from the Rotoaira Lake. This was
on the 25th October. The birds were at a considerable eleva-
tion, presenting peculiar combinations ; at one time flying in
closely-packed lines, then forming into a wedge-shape, and
then scattering again like a flock of crows, and uttering all
the time loud cries of kek ? kek ? kek. Large contingents of
the birds had already arrived, because they were to be seen
crowding together in large numbers on the exposed sand-
banks just above the surface of the water.
Sterna frontalis, Gray. (Common Tern.)
On the Taupo plains, where there are thousands of sterile
acres covered with manuka scrub, about five or six miles in-
land of the lake I observed two Terns, apparently of this
species, hovering over the ground, although I found it diffi-
cult to imagine what they could find to attract them in such
a barren locality. Probably they were in quest of lizards.
This species of Tern frequents the Taupo Lake, and so does
Sterna antarctica.
Sterna fuliginosa, Gould. (Sooty Tern.)
I have received a good many specimens from the Kermadec
Islands. Mr. Cheeseman writes, ?It is called the ? Wide-
awake ? bird by the Bells, and breeds in immense numbers
in the summer-time, but leaves the group altogether in the
winter.?


Ocydromus greyi, Duller. (North Island Woodhen.)
This species of Woodhen is still numerous on the wooded
hill - sides and mountain gullies in the Murimotu - Taupo
country. It is seldom met with in the open country, except
at one particular season, when the birds are exceedingly fat,
and the natives catch large numbers by running them down
with dogs.
It is a very remarkable fact in local botany that on the
arid lands forming the Onetapu Desert, and on the slopes of
Euapehu Mountain, where the climate is very rigorous, cer-
tain native pines, w r hich in the lowlands attain to a consider-
able height as forest trees, are represented by dwarfed forms
of the same species, not more than a few inches in height,
and often assuming a creeping habit. These degraded forms,
which are specifically identical with their forest relations,
resemble them exactly in their fructification. The berries
borne by these pigmy growths equal in size, and sometimes
even exceed, those of the forest trees, ?the fruit of the dwarf
totara, for example, being sometimes double the size of the
normal berry, while those of the miro, kahikatea, and rirnu
are at least fully equal to the berries produced by the forest
trees. When these miniature woods are laden with ripe mast
the Woodhen leaves the shelter of the woods and comes out
into the open to revel in plenty. As already stated, the birds
then become unusually fat, and, owing to their diminished
activity, become an easy prey to the natives. Captain Mair
informs me that he has known of a native with a good dog,
ten years ago, killing as many as eighty in a single day.
Pigeons and kakas, also, are said to resort to these subalpine
woods in considerable numbers to feed on the ripe fruit.
When camped on the edge of a red-birch forest near the
Mangataramea Stream (at an elevation of 3,000 ft.) I heard
the loud cry of the Woodhen every night, but I never met
with the bird in the open country, and the sheep-farmer with
whom I was staying appeared never to have seen one.
I was much struck with the beauty of these clumps of
bush in the Murimotu highlands, where the Woodhen was so
numerous. Some of them consist entirely of kawaka {Libro-
cedms doniana) a very ornamental tree of bright-green foliage
and tapering growth, with a trunk like a miniature Sequoia.
This is plainly seen when a fire has passed through the forest
and left the trees dead and naked. In some places you meet
with the strange sight of the whole forest apparently hewn
down, and strewing the ground with bleached and charred
trunks. The explanation is this: that these trees are gene-
rally hollow near the ground, and have only a feeble support
of lateral roots. Consequently, when a fire has passed through


and killed the trees, the dead timber cannot long resist the
action of the weather, and one after another the ? cedars ?
topple over with the passing blast, till at length not a single
trunk remains standing, and an appearance is presented of
utter wreck and desolation. For the most part the trees are
of small size, but Captain Mair informs me he has often met
with them 4ft. in diameter at the base. Another tree that
adds to the novelty of these subalpine woods is the silver-
birch ?a graceful and elegant tree of bright foliage, resembling
at a short distance the larch, and showing up conspicuously
amongst the black- and red-birch with which it mingles. In
these mountain solitudes, however, there is very little animal
life to engage the attention of the naturalist. On the summit
of Gentle Annie, in fine weather, I met with what appeared to
be a smaller and very bright variety of the Yellow Admiral
butterfly, but I could not catch any. I saw occasionally a
small lizard, which I referred to Tiliqua zealandica. Bird-
life is scarce, except at certain seasons and in particular
localities.
Ocydromus earli, Gray. (Brown Woodhen.)
I have to exhibit to-night another remarkable albinism.
It is that of the Brown Woodhen of the South Island. The
forehead, face, foreneck, and breast are pure white ; five of the
quills in one wing and six in the other are entirely white;
there are a few white feathers scattered among the wing-
coverts, and there is a large admixture of white in the plumage
of the abdomen, sides of the body, and flanks. The rest of
the plumage is normal. To judge from its large size, it is a
male bird. I obtained it, through a dealer, from the west
coast of the South Island.
Ocydromus brachypterus, Lafr. (Black Woodhen.)
Dr. Sharpe reports that he has examined the type spe-
cimen of Gallirallus brachypterus from the Caen Museum, for
the loan of which he was indebted to Professor Joyeux-Laffine,
the Director of that Museum. Dr. Sharpe points out that the
species has been the subject of much controversial opinion,
but that it is evidently the same as Gallirallus fuscus of
Duï¿½us, which must therefore be known as Ocydromus brachy-
pterus (Bull. 8.0.C., Jan., 1873). This being so, the Buff
Woodhen, which I referred to Ocydromus brachypterus in my
second edition of ?The Birds of New Zealand,? becomes
Ocydromus hectori, Hutton (Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. vi.,
p. 110, 1874), or, perhaps more properly, Ocydromus troglo-
dytes, Gmelin.


Porphyrio melanonotus, Temm. (Swamp-hen.)
I have to exhibit this evening a curious example of the
Swamp-hen or Pukeko, lately received by me from Nelson.
All the primaries in each wing are crossed near the tip with a
broad band of yellowish-white; the secondaries are similarly
marked, but not so sharply, and so are most of the wing-
coverts, imparting a mottled appearance to the upper surface.
The tail-feathers are broadly tipped with yellowish-white, and
there are a few scattered white feathers on the shoulders and
on the underparts. The rest of the plumage is normal.
I take this opportunity of mentioning a Swamp-hen from
the Chatham Islands described as new by Dr. Bowdler
Sharpe under the name of Porphyrio chathamensis (Cat. Birds
Brit. Mus., xxiii., p. 202). He gives the following diagnosis of
the species ; ? Similis P. hello, sed gutture toto nigro, pileo
concolore; praepectore saturate cyaneo : tibiis nigris, abdo-
mine imo concoloribus ??; and he adds, ?The tints are difficult
to describe, but the differences are well seen on comparison
with P. bellus.?
It seemed to me highly improbable that there should be
a differentiated species of this widely - spread form at the
Chathams, and, although holding Dr. Sharpe?s judgment in
great respect, I went to the British Museum to examine the
type for myself. A single glance satisfied me that the sup-
posed new species was nothing but our ordinary Swamp-hen
in an unusual, but by no means uncommon, phase of plumage.
The dark head and throat, the highly-coloured breast, and
dark underparts are merely individual differences of colour
and have no specific value. I would undertake to pick out
several birds exactly similar to Dr. Sharpe?s at the close of a
day?s shooting in any locality where Pukekos are numerous.
The Swamp-hen of New Zealand is abundant at the
Chatham Islands, and the existence there of another species
of so diffuse a form seemed on the face of it most unlikely.
Diomedea regia, Duller. (Royal Albatros.)
In the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow I saw an undoubted
example of this species labelled as Diomedea exulans. The
Curator told me the specimen had been in the Museum many
years, and that it was recorded as having come from the Cape
of Good Hope.
The following passage in Cook?s ? Second Voyage ? pro-
bably refers to this species, and, if so, it is without doubt the
earliest record of the bird: ?In the afternoon of the 21st
[January, 1773] being in the latitude of 64ï¿½ 24' South, longi-
tude 42ï¿½ 19' East, we saw a white Albatros with black-tipped
wings.?


Diomedea melanophrys, Boie. (Mollyhawk.)
In the perfectly adult bird the bill is of an uniform gamboge-
yellow, shaded with orange on the hook, and with a very fine
line of black around the base of both mandibles ; feet delicate
blue-grey, darker on the joints and interdigital webs; claws
white-horn colour.
Diomedea exulans, Linn. (Wandering Albatros.)
I have already mentioned the tame Albatros which lived so
long at Government House, under Mr. Gillington?s assiduous
care.* But there is a still more remarkable instance of the
kind, for Mr. Martin Chapman had a live one in his possession
for several months, having obtained it as a nestling from the
Auckland Islands. It partook freely of fat meat, and had an
inordinate appetite. It became quite tame, but on being pro-
voked would snap audibly with its mandibles.
Captain Fairchild informs me that when visiting the
Brothers and Stephen?s Island in June last, in perfectly calm
weather, he saw at least six hundred Albatroses resting on the
water, and that from the anchorage off the latter he counted
as many as a hundred. He says he has noticed that during
the last five years they have been getting more and more
plentiful off the New Zealand coast. Prior to that he never
saw more than a straggler now and then, and generally at
Flat Point, about midway between Wellington and Napier.
Diomedea fuliginosa, Gmelin. (Sooty Albatros.)
Captain Fairchild states that about the end of May last or
beginning of June, when off Milford Sound, in the ? Hinemoa,?
he saw fully a dozen Sooty Albatroses coursing about together
?a most unusual circumstance.
Diomedea bulleri, Rothschild. (Buffer?s Albatros.)
The bird which has hitherto been called Diomedea cul-
minata in our New Zealand lists has been pronounced by
Mr. Salvin a new species, and is described in the Ibis
(vol. v., 1893, p. 572) by Mr. W. Rothschild, who has been
good enough to dedicate this new form to myself. The type
of the species, besides a very large series of representative
specimens, are in the Rothschild Museum at Tring.
The following is the diagnosis: Thalassogeronti cul-
minate quoad colores similis, sed rostro pallidiore, culmine ad
basin latiore, ad latera attingente, culmine omnino flavo ; alis
subtus niveis. He adds, ?It differs materially from the
true Thalassogeron culminatus (Gould), a species of Ridgway?s
genus Thalassogeron, the base of the culminicorm being
* Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxv., p. 76.


separated by an interval of soft skin from the latericorn. _ In
this respect the present species is somewhat intermediate
between Diomedea and Thalassogeron, but the base of the
culminicorn, though not so well developed, distinctly spreads
and has a well-defined posterior margin.?
Diomedea salvini, Rothschild. (Salvin?s Albatros.)
On the same unimpeachable authority, Mr. Rothschild has
renamed the bird which has hitherto been knowm to us as
Diomedea cauta, and has referred it to the genus Thalassogeron.
The type of Gould?s T. cautus is in the British Museum, and
the present form is distinguished thus; Similis Th. canto, sed
rostro multo minore, ad basin minus elevato, plumbescente
nec albido, tarsis et digitis brevioribus quoque dignoscendus.
He adds, ? In coloration this species is apparently greyer on
the head and neck, the dark loral mark in front of the eye
being very conspicuous.?
Majaqueus sequinoctialis, Linn. (The ?Stinker? of
wï¿½alers.)
In a former paper (Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxv., p. 62) I
mentioned, on the authority of the carpenter of the ? Hine-
moa, ? a new species of Petrel at the Auckland Islands, of
which he had obtained two specimens, and which, from his
account of it, I referred to Majaqueus cequinoctialis. I have
now the pleasure to lay before you two specimens (male and
female), lately obtained through Mr. Smyth, the well-known
taxidermist at Caversham, so that the claim of this fine species
to a place in our list is beyond question. The peculiar
odour w 7 hich is characteristic of all Petrels in life, and never
entirely quits the dried skin, is very pronounced in this
species, and quite justifies the name by which whalers and
sailors distinguish it.
Majaqueus parkinsoni, Gray. (Black Petrel.)
Mr. J. Brough, of Nelson, in sending me a skin of this
Petrel, furnishes the following notes : ?This bird was killed
in February on a dividing-range between the head of the
Heaphy and the Big River. It was found in a hole at the
roots of a huge rata, in the midst of dense forest. lam quite
satisfied that this bird is the ? Night Demon ? of our diggers.
I had a live one some time ago from Collingwood, and I kept
it for three months; so I had every opportunity of observing
its habits. It was strictly nocturnal, and would never feed by
day. On windy nights the bird would become very excited,
and then it would give vent to the hysterical laugh or scream
from which it takes its name of * Night Demon.? ?


CEstrelata leucophrys, Hutton. (Kermadec-Island Petrel.)
Under the above name Professor Hutton has described a
Petrel received from the Kermedec Islands. The description
was to appear in the ? Proceedings ? of the Zoological Society
after I left England, and a beautiful plate of it had been pre-
pared by Keulemans. It is as well to have it on record, but it
is by no means certain that it is a good species. I had pre-
viously taken Home two specimens of this Petrel, which I had
received from Captain Fairchild. On submitting them to
Mr. Salvin, the great authority on the Petrel family, he
unhesitatingly pronounced it an aberrant form of CEstrelata
neglecta, which has a great tendency to vary. At Mr. Salvin?s
request, I afterwards examined Professor Hutton?s type at the
Zoological Society?s rooms, and found it was identical with
the species I had submitted to him. Mr. Salvin?s own verdict
was, ? a bad species and a bad name.?
CEstrelata nigripennis, Eothschild; This, vol. v., 1893,
p. 673.
A third new species pointed out by Mr. Salvin in Mr.
Walter Rothschild?s beautiful collection of Petrels at Tring,
and named as above, comes from the Kermadec Islands.
? This species belongs to the CE. coold (Gray) section of the
genus CEstrelata, of which CE. defilippiana is also a member.
It differs from all its congeners in having a short, stout, wide
bill, and in the almost total absence of white on the inner
webs of the outer primary beneath ; the under wing-coverts,
with the exception of a rather wide margin, being white, as
well as the axiilarv feathers.?
ï¿½/
I do not know what authority Professor Hutton had for the
following reference to me in his recent communication to the
Zoological Society (Proc. Z.S., 1893, p. 750), of which he has
kindly sent me a copy : ? CEstrelata nigripennis, Rothschild
(1893 ) CE. cooki, Cheeseman ( fide Buller), Trans. N.Z. Inst.,
vol. xxiii., p. 224; not of Gray.? lam not aware that I ever
saw Mr. Cheeseman?s specimen; and there is certainly no
warrant for this statement in that gentleman?s paper (op. cit.)
on the Kermadec Petrels. Where Mr. Cheeseman sought my
assistance in identifying his specimens he has mentioned the
fact.
CEstrelata axillaris, Salvin; Ibis, 1893, p. 264.
This is a very interesting addition to our list of native
species. In the collection of birds made by Mr. Hawkins at
the Chatham Islands, there were two specimens of a Petrel
allied to CEstrelata cooki, but differing in several marked cha-
racters, notably in having black axillary plumes. Mr. Salvin
states, ? The skins were not quite adult, but were marked


male and female. The birds had been shot on the south-east
island on the Bth May, 1892.
CEstrelata cervicalis, Salvin. (Sunday Island Petrel.)
Shortly before I went to Europe, Captain Fairchild kindly
presented me with a beautiful Petrel from Sunday Island, in
both adult and young states. The bird appeared to me to be
an entirely new species, but, as I was going Home, I decided
to delay my publication of it till I could compare my speci-
mens with the types in the British Museum. But 1 was too
late with it, for, in the meantime, a Captain Carpenter had
sent a skin to the Museum, and Mr. Salvin had named it as
above. It had fallen into good hands ; and my only regret in
the matter was that I had wished to connect Captain Fair-
child?s name with this fine species.
CEstrelata affinis, Buller. (Mottled Petrel.)
Professor Hutton is in error in stating ( loc. cit., p. 753)
that Mr. Salvin had identified my CEstrelata affinis with
?CE. gularis (Peale). Had our acknowledged authority on
Petrels, Mr. Salvin, so identified my bird, I certainly should
not have described and figured it as CEstrelata affinis in my
second edition of ? The Birds of New Zealand.? While ad-
mitting the species, Mr. Salvin suggested that it might prove
to be the same as CE. gularis, Peale (see Ibis, 1888, p. 358),
and so the matter rests. Professor Hutton knew this perfectly
well, because I had stated the facts in my account of the
species. The type of CEstrelata gularis is in the Smithsonian
Institution, and neither Mr. Salvin nor I have had an oppor-
tunity of comparing it with CE. affinis, mihi.
Puffinus gavia, Forst. (Forster?s Shearwater.)
A nestling obtained in the Hauraki Gulf, on the Bth No-
vember, was covered with very long and thick down of
extremely soft texture, and dark slate-grey, on the upper parts;
thick and close, and of a paler grey, on the under parts, fading
to whitish on the crop and foreneck. Black feathers just be-
ginning to appear on the wings.
Puffinus griseus, Gmelin. (Sombre Shearwater.)
A nestling obtained from one of the islands in the Hauraki
Gulf, on the 18th November, was covered with thick down,
long, extremely fine, and dark slate-grey in colour on the
upper parts, shorter and thicker on the under parts; paler
-grey on the sides of the body; white on the foreneck, crop,
and down the centre of the abdomen, in a broad band, to the
'vent. .. ? -


Puffinus chlororhynchus, Lesson.
I do not know what authority Professor Hutton had for
citing me thus, in a recent communication to the Zoological
Society of London; ?Puffinus chlororhynchus, Lesson; Buller,
?Birds of New Zealand,? 2nd ed., vol. ii., p. 235 ; P. caneipes,
Cheeseman (fide Buller), Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxiii., p. 226;
not of Gould.? On turning to Mr. T. F. Cheeseman?s paper
Ido not find any justification for the reference. As a matter
of fact I have never seen his specimens of this bird. I de-
scribed both species in my second edition of ?The Birds of New
Zealand ? (see pages 234 and 235), and am therefore familiar
with them. From the Kermadecs I received two examples of
Puffinus chlororhynchus, just as I was starting for England.
I took them with me, and, on submitting them to Mr. Salvin,
he confirmed my identification.
Puffinus assimilis, Gould. (Allied Shearwater.)
A fledgling which I have received from Sunday Island (one
of the Kermadecs) is a very pretty object. The plumage is as
in the adult, except that the longer wing-coverts and inner
secondaries are minutely tipped with white. But the long,
fluffy, dark-grey down still adheres to the sides of the body,
and as the bird squats it looks as if reposing in a luxurious
nest of down, which projects an inch or more from the body,
and has a charming effect.
Anas chlorotis, Gray. (Brown Duck.)
I am indebted to Captain Mair for another partial albino
of this species, which was shot by him on a lagoon near the
Manawatu River. It has the forehead, sides of the head,
nape, and hindneck white; shoulders and mantle with white
feathers intermixed with the brown, the former prepon-
derating. Rest of the plumage normal.
A specimen which came into my possession some time ago
(now in the Rothschild Museum) has the sides of the head,
crown, hindhead, and upper part of neck pure white, varied
only by irregular patches of brown extending from the base of
the upper mandible to the eyes, and thence across the vertex.
Most of the small wing-coverts, also one secondary and one
primary in each wing, are pure white ; of which there are
also touches near the tips of the other quills. The rest of the
plumage is normal, except that the margins of the dorsal
feathers are somewhat lighter than in ordinary birds.
Anas superciliosa, Gmelin. (Grey Duck.)
I have already recorded some remarkable eccentricities in
the breeding of the common Grey Duck. I find the following
in one of my note-books : At one end of the little island of


Motutaiko, in Taupe Lake, on a pohutukawa tree overhanging
the water, and at an elevation of 12ft. from the surface, a pair
of these Ducks, for several successive seasons, re-formed their
rude nest and brought forth their young.
Hymenolsemus malacorhynchus, Gray. (Blue Duck.)
A specimen of this Duck from Dusky Sound which passed
through my hands differed from ordinary examples in having
the whole of the plumage of a silky texture, and the entire
breast in front and on the sides thickly studded with dark
chestnut-brown spots, becoming almost confluent in places.
Aptenodytes longirostris, Scop. (King Penguin.)
The examination of a series of eight eggs gave me the
following result: They exhibit much variety in size and
shape ; the typical form is pear-shaped, but sometimes they
are elongate, inclining to an elliptical form, with an at-
tenuated smaller end. The largest of the former in this
series measures 4Tin. by Sin. ; and the smallest of the latter
measures 4Tin. by 2 - 7 in.
Apteryx haasti, Potts. (Haast?s Kiwi.)
Two eggs of this rare form were collected by Mr. Charles
Robinson on the Heaphy Ranges, on the west coast of the
South Island. The larger of these, measuring sT2sin. by
3T25in., was taken, in a perfectly fresh state, on the 20th De-
cember, with the female bird, under a grass tussock. The male
bird was found by the dog, also under a grass tussock, some dis-
tance away. The other egg, which is about one-eighth of an
inch shorter, was taken (with a single bird in the nest) on the
26th January. It unfortunately got cracked through the
struggles of the captive bird, and was found to contain a well-
advanced embryo. Both eggs when taken were much soiled
by contact with the birds? feet, especially the one that had
been long incubated; but, on being washed, they disclosed a
shell of a pale greenish-white. In form they are broadly
ovoido-elliptical, the smaller one being almost a perfect
ellipsis. These unique specimens are now in the Rothschild
Museum, at Tring.


Art. Y. ? On a New Species of Fern-bird (Sphenoeacus) from
the Snares Islands ; with an Exhibition of Specimens.
By Sir Walter L. Bullbr, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.R.S.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 25th July, 1894.]
I have much pleasure in exhibiting this evening some speci-
mens of a new bird, which I have distinguished as Sphe-
noeacus caudatus. In order to secure the advantage of early
publication, I have sent my diagnosis of this species to our
London ornithological magazine, the Ibis; but, as I think it
well to have everything of the kind on record in the ? Trans-
actions of the New Zealand Institute ? for the convenience of
local workers, I append a copy of that paper.
In a collection of birds made for me by Mr. H. H. Travers
on the last visit of the Government steamboat ? Hinemoa ?
to the various groups of islands adjacent to New Zealand,
there are a good many specimens of the Fern-bird or Utick,
obtained by him on the Snares, a group of islets lying about
seventy miles south of the southernmost extremity of New
Zealand. I have hitherto referred this island-form to Mr. G.
R. Gray?s Sphenoeacus fulvus. But the opportunity of examin-
ing so good a series (both male and female) has led me to
investigate the subject further, and I am now satisfied that
the species is distinct.
Mr. G. R. Gray?s description of Sphenoeacus fulvus ap-
peared in his very useful ? List of the Birds of New Zea-
land and the adjacent Islands ? which came out in the Ibis of
1862.
To commence with, his bird was from New Zealand; and,
although no locality is given, it cannot have come from the
Snares, inasmuch as there was no communication with these
small islands at that time.
According to his description, Sphenoeacus fulvus, although
of a ?rather larger size? than Sphenoeacus punctatus, has a
smaller bill and shorter tail. This is not the case with the
bird from the Snares, which is altogether appreciably larger,
the bill being more robust;, and the tail so conspicuously dif-
ferent that I have named the species from that feature : that is
to say, instead of its being composed of Emu-like feathers
with disunited barbs, the webs are closely set and compact,
not differing in any way from the typical tail-feathers of the
extensive family to which this genus belongs. Mr. Gray says
of his bird that ? the black streaks and dots are less pro-
nounced than in Sphenoeacus punctatus,? which is not true of
this bird ; and he adds that ? the abdomen is white, more or
less minutely dotted with black,? a description which is


equally inapplicable to this species. In Mr Gray?s bird the
white?superciliary streak is more pronounced than in Sphc-
nceacus punctatus; in this species it is less so.
The form which I am now distinguishing appears to be
intermediate between Sphenoeacus punctatus of New Zealand
and Sphencsacus rufescms, mihi, of the Chatham Islands, and
its occurrence on the Snares is the more interesting as another
inhabitant of these islets is the Chatham Island Robin (Mito
traversi, mihi), which has never yet been found in New Zea-
land.

This is the Sphenoeacus fulvus of my ? Birds of New Zea-

to as having come from the South, without any locality being
assigned, must, I now feel assured, have come from the
Snares. They reached me through dealers, and it is almost
impossible in such cases to get reliable particulars of the kind.
Art, YI. ?Notes on the Flightless Duck of the Auckland
Islands (Nesonetta aucklandica).
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.E.S., &c.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society , 25th July, 1894.']
I have lately had an opportunity of examining a large series
of skins of the small Flightless Duck (Nesonetta aucklandica)
collected by Mr. H. H. Travers at the Auckland Islands, to
which this species is strictly confined. The sexes in the adult
state do not differ much from each other, both exhibiting the
delicate reflections on the plumage of the upper surface ; but
the male may be distinguished by its darker head and neck,
by the black under tail-coverts, and by a greater abundance
of vermiculated markings on the sides of the body. The
young male, as I discovered, has exactly similar plumage to
the adult female, the head being of the same brown colour as


the body, with a paler throat. There is likewise an absence
of black on the under tail-coverts. The adult plumage is pro-
bably assumed in the second year. As with the insects of
Madeira, mentioned by me in a former paper, so with this
Duck: long disuse has rendered the wings useless for pur-
poses of flight; but, as if to compensate for this, the species
possesses the unusual faculty of being able to climb ?an accom-
plishment which no doubt would be of far more advantage to
the bird in its rocky habitat, surrounded by the ocean, than
the power of flight. I made the discovery by the purest acci-
dent. Captain Fairchild, on the return of the ? Hinemoa?
from her last visit to the Auckland Islands, presented me with
a live pair, which I at once placed on the Papaitonga Lake,
in the hope that they might breed there. I afterwards pur-
chased a pair from one of the crew, and, being desirous of
sending these to Europe, I placed them in a wire enclosure,
over 3ft. high, in a secluded part of my garden. I noticed
that they at once commenced to scale the perfectly upright
netting, falling back into the yard as they neared the top of
the fence. Never supposing that they would get over the
fence, I left them in the enclosure. In the morning the
male bird, being the more robust of the two, had made its
escape, and I had little hope of ever seeing it again, there
being much close covert in the garden. A few evenings after-
wards I found both birds again in the yard, the fugitive having
evidently climbed back info the enclosure for the purpose of
sharing his mate?s food. In the morning he had disappeared
again. This continued for about ten days, the bird (which is
semi-nocturnal in its habits) skulking and hiding during the
day, and coming back in the evening to share the food. When
I was ready to ship the Ducks I had simply to visit the
enclosure after dusk, and then, catching them without diffi-
culty, they were cooped and despatched to London by the
E.M.S. ? Tainui.?
Art. Yll.? Notes on Phalacrocorax colensoi, of the Auckland
Islands, and on Phalacrocorax onslowi, of the Chatham
Islands.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G-, D.Sc., F.E.S.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, sth September, 1894.]
Mr. H. O. Forbes, in his paper ? On the Birds inhabiting
the Chatham Islands,? which appeared in the Ibis for
October, 1893, describes, under the name of Phalacrocorax
rothschildi, a Shag found at the Chatham Islands and in the


south of New Zealand, separating it from Phalacrocorax
colensoi, and saying, ? This species is distinguished at once by
the approximation of the dark plumage of the head beneath
the throat, leaving a comparatively narrow white stripe
between them.? lie also makes the possession of both the
white alar bar and the white dorsal spot characteristic of his
new species.
In my opinion we have a good deal more to learn about
the Shags inhabiting New Zealand and the adjacent islands ;
and I think Mr. Forbes was somewhat rash in characterizing
this as a new species without further investigation.
The type of my Phalacrocorax colensoi was from the
Auckland Islands, but (like all the other specimens collected
there by Mr. Burton at a wrong season of the year) it was in
old and faded plumage, with dingy colours. Quite recently,
however, I have had an opportunity of examining a large
number of skins in good plumage, collected by Mr. Henry Travers
at the Auckland Islands and on Campbell Island during the
last cruise of the Government gunboat ? Hinemoa.? The
examination of this collection has satisfied me that Mr. Forbes s
? characters ? are of very little value. The form and width of
the white stripe down the foreneck, the presence or absence of
the alar bar, and the dorsal patch of white, are inconstant
features, due apparently to age or season. It will probably be
found, when we become better acquainted with the species,
that the bird is carunculated at one season of the year and not
at another, for all the specimens brought by Mr. Travers
(killed in May) are without caruncles on the face. They include
adult birds of both sexes, but presenting very different phases
of plumage. In three of them there is a slight coronal crest,
the feathers being acuminate, and produced beyond the ordi-
nary plumage of the head. In some the alar bar is very con-
spicuous, occupying the whole of the median wing-coverts, in
others it is broken and irregular; in one of the birds it is
wholly absent, whilst in another the only indications of it are
a few scattered white feathers among the dark wing-coverts.
Of the whole series only one presents the white dorsal spot.
The white throat-stripe is very uncertain in character: in
some of the specimens it widens gradually from the chin to
the breast, whilst in one of them it is narrow and of even width
in its w'hole extent; in some it is constricted in the middle;
and in one of them the dark plumage of the sides of the neck
almost meets above the breast, the white stripe being inter-
rupted and broken. Out of the whole lot only one gives the
wing - measurement of my type ?namely, lOfiin. In all
the others the wing, from the flexure, measures llin. It
will be seen therefore that, even in this respect, the species
is variable. The fact is that this Shag, like many others,


varies with age and season, and the only tiling to be done, so
far as I can see, is to make the characters of Phalacrocorax
colensoi somewhat wider.
In a specimen which I have since had an opportunity of
examining the dark plumage actually meets about the foreneck,
there being only a few minute white feathers along the line of
junction. There is a single lengthened coronal feather, evi-
dently the vestige of a crest that had recently been shed.
There is a broad alar bar of white, but no dorsal spot. This
bird, which presents old and faded, or out-of-season, plumage,
was obtained by Mr. Henry Travers on a former visit to the
Auckland Islands, about the year 1890.
With regard, however, to another species of Shag Mr.
Forbes has, I think, been more fortunate. He is probably
right in considering Phalacrocorax imperialis, with which I
had united the Chatham Island Shag, as being confined to
the Straits of Magellan, from whence the type came. I am
perfectly sure that the Chatham Island bird is distinct from
Phalacrocorax carunculatus of New Zealand, and if it cannot
properly be united with P. imperialis it requires a distinctive
name; and in providing this Mr. Forbes could not, in my
opinion, have made a better selection than he did in dedicat-
ing this handsome species to our late Governor. Lord Onslow
not only took an active interest in our native birds and their
preservation, but he was the first to send to Europe living
specimens of Phalacrocorax carunculatus, one of which, I
believe, still survives in the Zoological Society?s Gardens at
Regent?s Park.
The beautiful example of Phalacrocorax onslowi which I
have the pleasure of exhibiting to you to-night came, I pre-
sume, from the Chatham Islands, although I have no informa-
tion of locality with it. The specimen is in brilliant plumage,
and if you will handle it you will find the feathers of the neck
as soft and yielding to the touch as the finest silk-velvet. It
is a male bird in full breeding plumage, and has a superb
coronal crest, the feathers composing which are from one to
three inches in length, of narrow even breadth, and of the
same brilliant metallic blue as the surrounding plumage. Mr.
Forbes, in diagnosing the character of this species, includes
? an alar bar and doubtfully a dorsal spot of white as it is
absent in the specimens, though mature and crested, described
and figured by Sir W. Buller.? On examining the specimen
now before the meeting, you will observe that, although ap-
parently in the most matured plumage, the neck being adorned
with white hair-like filaments an inch long and the alar bar
being very conspicuous, there is not the slightest indication of
the dorsal spot of white. I think we may conclude that its
absence is characteristic of the species.


P.S.?Since the above was written I have had an oppor-
tunity of examining some further specimens of Phalacrocorax
carunculatus from the White Rocks, Queen Charlotte Sound,
the only locality in New Zealand, so far as we are aw T are, in
which this species is to be found. Captain Fairchild informs
me that there is still a small colony of these birds, numbering
from fifteen to twenty, breeding on the rocks. On the
occasion of his visit last week he found the young hatched
out, but still occupying the nests. Four of these, of different
sizes, clothed in thick down, he brought over with him in the
? Hinemoa,? and I have sent them up to the Papaitonga
Lake, where I trust they will thrive and ultimately breed.
Two old birds, both females, were shot by the crew and
the skins preserved. I had an opportunity of examining one
of these. The pad of orange caruncles on the brow, on each
side of the head, is very prominent, and as it is entirely
absent in some examples I take it to be a feature peculiar to
the breeding-season. There is no appearance whatever of a
crest, or even an elongation of the coronal feathers. The
white alar bar is very conspicuous; so is the dorsal double
patch of white. The naked space around and in front of the
eyes is entirely dark-blue ; and the feet are flesh-coloured.
Nestling. ?Covered with sooty down. Fore part of head,
face, and throat, perfectly bare; the skin, which is jet-black,
presenting a granulated surface, and having the appearance of
kid-leather. Upper mandible brownish-black; the under
mandible, except at the tip, as well as the skin at its base,
in a straight line from the angle of the mouth, bluish-white,
the black colouring of the skin beyond, however, being con-
tinued, in a tapering streak, to a point within the rami.
Under each eye there is a minute round spot of white. Legs
and feet dark-grey, the webs lighter.?W.L.B. Wellington,

Art. YIII. ? Note on GEstrelata neglecta; with an Exhibition
of Specimens.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.R.S.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, sth September,
1894.-]
When I had the privilege of placing before you on the 25th
July last a budget of ornithological notes I took occasion to
refer to Professor Hutton?s supposed new species of Petrel
from the Kermadec Islands, to which he had given the name


of CEstrelata leuco'plnrys, and, following Mr. Salvin, I then
stated my belief that, instead of being a distinct species, it was
only a form of CE. neglecta. We have not had to wait long
for confirmation of this view. I have the pleasure of exhibit-
ing to-night a pair of birds kindly lent to me for that purpose
by Mr. Bethune, the second engineer of the ? Hinemoa.?
The male bird is in the plumage of Professor Hutton?s CEstre-
lata leucophrys, whilst the female is in the ordinary plumage
of CEstrelata neglecta. They were taken by Mr. Bethune
himself from their breeding-burrow on Sunday Island. In-
deed, Mr. Bethune assures me that on every occasion he can
remember?and he has collected many of these birds in the
breeding-season?he has found the two kinds mated and
breeding together. From this it might be inferred that the
difference of plumage is sexual. As against this view, how-
ever, I have to exhibit a specimen in an intermediate state of
plumage, the sides of the head and neck being very prettily
rayed with dusky grey; also an example with a still whiter
head than Mr. Bethune?s male bird presents. All this
goes to prove the correctness of Mr. Salvin?s contention as
to the variability of this species in regard to plumage. It is
perfectly clear, therefore, that CEstrelata leucophrys will not
stand as a species.
At the same time that I submitted my specimens of CE.
neglecta to Mr. Salvin (as stated in my former paper, page 123)
I showed him also a pair in entirely dark plumage, which
seemed to me to be distinct, and which, in that case. I
proposed to dedicate to Captain Fairchild, who has done so
much to increase our knowledge of the birds inhabiting the
outlying islands. Mr. Salvin expressed a strong belief that
these were referable to the same species in a dark phase of
plumage, and said that nothing would satisfy him to the con-
trary short of finding the dark-coloured birds nesting together
apart from the lighter-coloured birds, and breeding true. I
felt bound to defer to the opinion of a naturalist who has made
the Petrel family his special study, so I abstained from re-
cording this supposed new form. The two specimens which I
exhibit to-night seem to prove that in this case also Mr. Salvin
was right in referring the bird to CEstrelata neglecta. In one
of them the entire plumage is brownish-grey, darker on the
upper surface, changing to brownish-black on the wings and
tail; the primaries, secondaries, and tail-feathers being white
in their basal portion, with white shafts, darkening towards
the tip. In the other specimen the under surface is much
lighter, whilst on the throat there are indications of a change
to the pale-grey characteristic of ordinary specimens of CE.
neglecta. I think, therefore, we may pretty safely assume
that this is the young state of that species.


In Mr. Bethune?s two specimens now exhibited the wing
measures, from the flexure, exactly lT7oin.; in my inter-
mediate example it measures 12in., and in the more matured
one only lOSin. In the two entirely dark birds the wing, as
in the first-named, measures 11-75 in. The dark birds have
brownish-black legs and feet, whereas in all the others the
tarsi are yellowish, and the toes ?sandalled? with black;
but this difference is no doubt due to the immaturity of the
former.
Art. IX. ? Some Curiosities of Bird-life.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.E.S.
.[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society , 19th September ,
1894.]
Pursuant to the title of my paper, I shall exhibit to you this
evening some remarkable ? freaks of nature,? or curiosities of
bird-life. One of them, as I shall presently show, is a pure
albino Kiwi, of the small species known to us as Apteryx
oweni, the ordinary plumage of which is of a speckled or
dappled-grey colour. But before proceeding to the specimens
I wish to say a word or two on the subject of albinism.
The inherent tendency to albinism is one of the distin-
guishing features of the New Zealand avifauna. Albinism in
the human subject is due to the absence of the minute par-
ticles of colouring-matter in the epidermis or outer cuticle,
the presence of which, in more or less abundance, gives colour
to the skin. In many species of quadrupeds, birds, and
reptiles, albinism, due to a precisely similar cause, often
exhibits itself, the skin, hair, feathers, and also the hard
tissues?even the horny sheaths and scaly coverings?pre-
senting an abnormal wKiteness. Sometimes, as in the case of
white rats, mice, and rabbits, this is accompanied by an
abnormal condition of the eyes, which become blood-red. The
whiteness of plumage, the purity of which is regulated by the
entire or only partial absence of the colouring pigment in the
feathers, is thus easily accounted for; but I have been unable
to discover any sufficient reason for the frequency of this con-
dition of plumage among the birds of New Zealand. It is
certainly not the result of disease, or of a low state of vitality,
any more than albinism in the human subject can be taken to
indicate an enfeebled condition of mind or body. May it not,
then, be in some way dependent on climatal conditions ?It
is significant that in tropical India the tendency is in an


opposite direction, melanism, as we are informed, being of
frequent occurrence there. Now, in the whole of my expe-
rience I have met with only two examples of melanism among
New Zealand birds?the subjects being Anthornis melanura
and Miro albifrons ?and I cannot say that in either case was
it very pronounced. Of albinism, however, in this country
there are endless examples. In my ? Birds of New Zealand ?
(2nd ed.) I have recorded albinoes, more or less perfect, of
thirty-three species (see enumeration on page xlii. of Intro-
duction). I have since recorded six more in the pages of our
?Transactions??namely, Myiomoira toitoi, Halcyon vagans,
Puffinus griseus, Diomedea regia, Diomedea fuliginosa, and
Apteryx haasti; and I am informed by the Hon. Walter
Rothschild that he has received a pure albino of Thinornis
novce-zealandice from the Chatham Islands.
It is, of course, the pigments in the feathers which produce
the colours that we admire so much. Dr. J. S. Kingsley, in
an excellent article on the subject, informs us that ? a colour-
ing matter which is called zoomelanin, and thought to be
identical with coriosulphurine, seems to produce all the black
and dark hues in birds, while some green colours are due
to an admixture of a yellowish pigment called psittacofulvine.
A really green pigment has only been found in the touracoes,
?hence the name turacoverdin, ?and no blue or violet pig-
ment has yet been discovered, while red (zooerythrine) is quite
common. Another red, turacin, causes the magnificent red on
the wings of the Musophagidxe. There is no white pigment,,
but w T herever that colour occurs it is due to the countless
number of interstices between the molecules of the feather,
the substance of the latter being colourless. Many tints?for
example, blue, violet, and certain greens?are not due to the
pigment, which is black-brown to yellow, but the blue results
from a particular surface-structure of the feathers, so that it
must disappear if the colour-producing parts be destroyed.
Thus, if we hammer carefully the deep-blue feathers of a
Macaw, the blue colour immediately disappears, and the
injured part looks grey or brownish, according to the underly-
ing pigment. Some green parrot-feathers, when treated in a
similar way, become yellow, since this is the colour of their
pigment.? We are told that the gloss of feathers, indepen-
dent of the colour itself, is the result of their surface being
. O
smooth and polished, while the metallic lustre is due to a
transparent sheath which acts like a prism.
Closely connected with this subject is that of ? dichromat-
ism.? Of this colour-problem the same author says, ?We
are accustomed to call it dichromatism, but of its true nature
and its significance in the animal economy we are quite ig-
norant. By this term we designate the peculiarity, in certain


species of birds, that individuals present two different styles
of coloration, or ? phases,? presumably more or less inde-
pendent of geographical distribution, present or past, or, in
fact, of any apparent cause whatsoever. The difficulty in find-
ing a plausible theory is much increased by the circumstance
that there are nearly as many kinds of dichromatism as there
are dichromatic species.? Among the examples put forward
by him is that of the dark and w'hite forms of Ossifraga
gigantea. In this I think he is mistaken. I have, from time
to time, recorded seven examples of the White Nelly from New
Zealand waters. Of these only two were absolutely pure
albinoes. One of them, which I obtained at Waikanae, about
forty miles up our west coast, and presented to the Colonial
Museum, was of snowy whiteness, without blemish of any
kind, even the legs and feet being whitish, whilst the bill was
yellowish horn-colour. The other, which is almost as pure,
was obtained at sea, about ten miles north of Milford Sound,
and presented to me by Captain Fairchild. All the other
examples are more or less marked with dark feathers, scattered
irregularly over the entire body. There are certainly two
phases of the dark plumage?the one uniform slaty-grey, the
other paler grey with whitish cheeks and throat?but these
differences are in my opinion attributable to age and sex.
In addition to ?dichromatism? there is what is termed
? trichromatism,? where, apart from the normal form, there
are twm different-coloured phases, although this phenomenon
appears to want confirmation, the evidence in support of it
being incomplete. If the theory be true it may help to ex-
plain the formation of new r species,?the original stock dying
out in the struggle for existence, and the dichromatic phases
becoming stereotyped into two invariable forms or species,
separated geographically but still identical in structure. Dr.
Kingsley mentions an example brought forward by Mr.
Eidgway, that of the Scarlet and the White Ibises ( Guam rubra
and G. alba), of which he remarks that they are now so dif-
ferent in colour that probably no one would deny their specific
distinction, though structurally so alike that a specimen of
the white one dyed scarlet would be indistinguishable from
G. rubra; and he concludes with this observation: ?The ques-
tion which finally impresses itself upon the inquirer, in view
of the above facts, is this : Are not the two or three phases
?of dichromatic or trichromatic species ? incipient species,? the
final state of which will be that of the White and the Scarlet
Ibises ? The subject is one of the most perplexing, and conse-
quently most interesting, questions in modern ornithology. It
shows what we know, and particularly what we do not know;
it shows that ornithology means more than a mere description
and naming of birds; that one of its aims is to contribute to


the solution of the great problem of the age? ? the origin
of species.? ?
There is another point on which I should like to say a word
before exhibiting the specimens. I have recorded only five per-
fect albinoes of Apteryx oweni and one case of partial albinism.*
It will be seen therefore that this condition of plumage is a
rarity. Ido not hesitate to say, however, that in a few years?
time a specimen of the Grey Kiwi in the ordinary plumage
will be as rare in New Zealand as the abnormal example I am
presenting to you to-night; and I will tell you why. Not
many years ago this species existed in great abundance in cer-
tain parts of the South Island. It was of course to be ex-
pected that a bird incapable of flight and devoid of any means
of self-defence would diminish in numbers as the country
became settled, and dogs and cats, running wild, spread them-
selves over the interior; but a new factor has come into exist-
ence which threatens the speedy extermination of not only
Apteryx oioeni but of many other indigenous forms. I refer
to the introduction, at the instance of a former Government,
of polecats, stoats, and w 7 easels. From a naturalist?s point
of view, I regard this act in the light of a crime. The vermin
that every farmer in the Old Country was trying to extirpate
as an unmitigated evil our wise Government bought up by the
hundred and imported into this country, in the vain hope that
these ?carnivorous beasts? would change their habits and
take to a rabbit diet, to the exclusion of everything else ! No
doubt, to abate the rabbit-nuisance, which was causing wide-
spread loss and even ruin to our sheepfarmers in many parts
of the country, was a most desirable object. But it is a ques-
tion whether, in the introduction of polecats, stoats, and
weasels, the Government was not establishing, even from the
farmers? point of view, a still greater evil. As shipment after
shipment of this vermin from over the water arrived in New
Zealand, I raised my voice in protest against so insane a
policy, and so did others?notably Professor Newton of
Cambridge?but all to no purpose. The imported animals
were turned loose north and south, and have now become
firmly acclimatized in a country where the conditions of life
are so favourable to their existence that no power on earth
will ever dislodge them. The Wairarapa was the principal
seat of the rabbit-plague in this provincial district; so the
destroyers, of whom so much was expected, were liberated
there. But they did not stay long with the rabbits. Swarm-
ing over the dividing-range, and crossing in summer the snow-
capped ridges of the Euahine, they descended upon the fertile
lands of the west coast, where they are now fairly established,
* ?Birds of New Zealand,? 2nd ed., vol. ii., p. 328.


and where there are practically no rabbits for them to prey
upon. They are making themselves felt, however, in other
respects. The rabbits devastated the pastures, but they left
the sheep alone. Not so with these ?Government immi-
grants.? One farmer at Kereru complains that in a single
night this season he lost forty lambs, each exhibiting a small
punctured wound, betraying the depredator. My sons had
their hen-roost visited at night, and a brood of valuable fowls
destroyed. The breeding of turkeys was at one time a profit-
able industry in these districts, the hen-birds forming their
nests in the scrub and along the outer edges of the bush ; but,
with these marauders abroad, a turkey has now very little
chance of bringing out a brood. Formerly, the Woodhen
(Ocydromus greyi ) was very abundant in the Horowhenua
and Manawatu districts, its loud and not unmusical whistle
being heard on all hands as the shades of evening deepened
into?the gloom of night. Now all this is changed. The
responsive cries of the Woodhen are seldom heard, and
there is nothing to break the stillness of the night but
the call of the Morepork keeping his vigils. The diminu-
tion in numbers of our introduced game Pheasants and
Californian Quail ?must, I think, be attributed to the same
CcIUSB.
Mr. Jonathan Brough, writing to me from the Pelorus,
says, ? I have now been camped in these woods for about a
month up one of the tributaries of the Pelorus River known
as Wakamarina. lam camped a long way up the creek, at a
place where I used to collect birds some years ago. In those
days I found this a good hunting-ground; a great number of
species could be then obtained in this locality, but now all this
is changed. I seldom see or hear any birds worth collecting.
The stoats and weasels have done their work. For three
weeks I was camped right up amongst the mountains and in
the heart of the bush, and I never saw a single Woodhen,
nor did I ever hear one. I heard one Kiwi calling, and I
found one dead on the ground with its head and neck muti-
lated by the stoats. I do not now see or hear any Saddle-
backs, or Pigeons, or Wrens, all of which were plentiful
enough in this place a few years ago. The Blue Duck used
to be fairly abundant in the creek, and they are now nearly
extinct. This time I have seen only one pair. They had a
brood of young ones, so I felt that I could not shoot them.
They had six young ones when I first saw them. I have an
opportunity of seeing them in the creek every day, and it is
very interesting to watch them. But the young ones are
getting fewer every week, and now T there are only three left.
1 attribute this also to the stoats, which are very numerous
about here. Collecting specimens of natural history in this


part of the country is a thing of the past, for the stoats and
weasels have swept away everything.?
An old settler at Wanganui, from whom I have received
many specimens in the past, writes me : ? Weasels have de-
stroyed all game, and I think Wekas will share the same fate.
I never see any. I have killed seventeen weasels on my
place in three months ; and of the many bad things intro-
duced I think this the worst.? And Mr. William Smyth,
the well-known collector, writing to me from Dunedin, says,
? I got only a few Wekas from Waimate last winter. They
have practically disappeared from the Otago country.?
Even the country babies appear to be scarcely safe, for
a paragraph has appeared in one of the newspapers stating
that a child playing on the open common at Palmerston North
was attacked by a pack of four stoats, and narrowly escaped
serious injury. * Whether this report was true or not I can-
not say, but it is just what is likely to happen when the blood-
thirsty animals become numerous enough. Side by side with
this wicked introduction into our fair country of animal pests
we have the reckless?and, to my mind, ignorant ?practice on
our sheep-farms of poisoning hawks. There can be no doubt
that the Harrier (Circus gouldi ) does occasionally attack
weakly lambs, tearing out their eyes and causing their death.
So, for that matter, does the large Seagull (Larus dominie anus).
But it is much easier for a hawk to attack and prey on a
young rabbit than on a lamb; and, as a matter of fact, we
owe to this cause that the rabbit, although it became esta-
blished on the sandhills of the west coast of this province
some twenty years ago, has never been able to sweep the
country as it has done elsewhere. The conditions for hunting
it on the open sandhills are favourable to the Harrier, and the
bird has effectually kept the rabbit-nuisance under. I have
always said that it is a dangerous thing to disturb the balance
of nature ; and I am persuaded that on our west coast at any
rate the farmers who sometimes poison with strychnine twenty
or more hawks in a week do themselves far more harm than
good. But that is an evil of far less magnitude than the one
we have been discussing?the introduction of polecats, stoats,
and weasels. The Minister who, in the excess of his ignorant
zeal, authorised this public expenditure will probably be
remembered in the colony long after we are dead and gone.f
* See Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xxiv., p. 90.
f Since the above was written it has been officially notified in the
Government Gazette that ferrets, stoats, and weasels are protected by law !
As a fitting commentary upon this the following paragraph appeared a
few days later in the New Zealand Times: ? Stoats are reported to be very
troublesome in the Hawera district. One settler reports that sixteen eggs
out of eighteen were destroyed in one nest by stoats last week.? And a


It is melancholy to reflect that the New Zealand avifauna,
which had already, from a variety of adverse causes, become
endangered, should be thus subjected to an overwhelming in-
fluence for evil. But for this unfortunate introduction there
would have been some hope of many of the species_ being
permanently preserved. Indeed, it had become a subject of
remark that such birds as the Woodhen, the Swamp-hen, and
the Banded Rail were becoming more numerous in ail the
cultivated districts, the conditions of existence being more
favourable. To show you that lam not raising an unneces-
sary wail over the birds that are vanishing, I will quote
a passage from Professor Newton?s admirable article on
? Birds ? (Enc. Brit., p. 742)
? As a whole, the avifauna of New Zealand must be re-
garded as one of the most interesting and instructive in the
world, and the inevitable doom which is awaiting its surviving
members cannot but excite a lively regret in the minds of all
ornithologists. This regret is quite apart from any question
of sentiment ; if it were otherwise, it could not be defended
against that sentiment which prompts our colonial fellow-
subjects indiscriminately to stock their fields and forests not
only with the species of their Mother-country, but with all
the fowls of heaven, whencesoever they can be procured.
The regret we express arises from the thought that, just as we
lament our ignorance of the species which in various lands
have been extirpated by our forefathers, so our posterity will
want to know much more of the present ornis of New Zealand
than we can possibly record; for no one nowadays can pre-
tend to predict the scope of investigation which will be re-
quired, and required in vain, by naturalists in that future
correspondent of the Evening Post, under the nom de 'plume of ? Bush-
man,? commenting on the Gazette notification, writes, ? I should like to
know when this craze of a few faddists is going to cease, for it seems to
me about time that some one entered a strong protest against the whole-
sale introduction of these pests into our beautiful adopted country. Any
one who, like myself, has kept ferrets for years must know that the habits
of the animal are entirely against its ever doing any real good as an ex-
terminator of rabbits, for, unlike a cat, a ferret will not hunt for the sake
of hunting ; and, as it almost always lays up and sleeps for two or three
days after a heavy meal, this must militate against its usefulness. Again,
ferrets and their congenitors will hardly ever touch fur if they can obtain
feathers, which is the reason that in many districts where pheasants and
quail were once plentiful they are now nearly extinct. And the last but
greatest evil is that ferrets are, and have been for years, killing hundreds,
and I might say thousands, of lambs yearly all over the country. Now, I
would ask, is it any use proclaiming such vermin as ? protected animals,?
when the above facts are well known? Is it not merely inviting people
to break the law ? I have for years killed every ferret, stoat, or weasel
that I could get a chance at; and many others that I know do the same,
or we should have long since been plagued by a worse pest than the rabbits
ever were.? , . .. ?


when New Zealand may be one of the great nations of the
earth.?
Without further preface I shall invite your attention to the
three very interesting specimens on the table, about each of
which I have a few remarks to offer.
E Nestor meridionalis, Gmelin. (Kaka.)
Mr. Gould, in the supplement to his superb work on ?The
Birds of Australia,? figures and describes several species from
New Zealand. Among these there is the Prince of Essling?s
Parrot ( Nestor esslingii, De Souance), upon which he remarks
as follows:
? A single specimen only of this magnificent Parrot has
come under my notice ; and this example is perhaps the only
one that has yet been sent to Europe. It formerly formed
part of the collection of the Prince d?Essling of Paris, but now
graces the National Museum of Great Britain. It is in a
most perfect state of preservation, and is, without exception,
one of the finest species not only of its genus, but of the
great family of Parrots. The native country of this bird is
supposed to be New Zealand ; but I, as well as M. de Souance,
have failed to learn anything definite on this point. In size it
even exceeds the great Kaka ( Nestor meridionalis), which it
resembles in the form of the beak, while in its general colour-
ing it closely assimilates to the Nestor jproductus; in some
features of its plumage, however, it differs from both. In both
those species the tail-feathers are strongly toothed on the
under surface with red ; and in the N. esslingii no such marks
occur, the toothing on the inner webs of the primaries is not so
clear and well defined, and the light-coloured interspaces are
much freckled with brown.?
Dr. Finsch, on the other hand, states in his ? Monograph
of Parrots ? that Nestor esslingii is in size and general colour
the same as Nestor meridionalis, but ? has the breast ash-
grey with brown terminal margins, and a broad yellowish-
white transverse band straight across the belly.? He quotes
De Souance to the effect that the red marks on the inner
vane of the quills and tail-feathers are precisely as in Nestor
meridionalis.
As far back as 1870 I expressed my belief that this was
only an accidental variety of our common Nestor meridionalis;
and a subsequent examination of the specimen in the British
Museum, on my first visit to England, confirmed this view.
At this time the specimen was exhibited, mounted with others
of the same genus, in a plate-glass show-case in one of the
main galleries. But Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, the able Curator
in charge of the collection of birds, has had them carefully
unmounted and reduced to the condition of cabinet skins, as


he feared that constant exposure to the light would have a
damaging effect on the bright plumage. In the ? Bird-room,?
however, they are always accessible to students, and may be
examined with more satisfaction than in hermetically-sealed
show T -cases.
The specimen which I have the pleasure of exhibiting to-
night is, so far as I can remember, almost exactly similar to
the type of Nestor esslingii. There is a very slight indication
of the toothed markings on the under - surface of the tail-
feathers ; but, as I have already shown, the authorities differ
as to their presence or entire absence in the original specimen.
The curious part of the story, however, is that the bird now
exhibited is one of three, all marked alike, recently obtained
in the same locality (District of Marlborough) ?all three of
which I have had an opportunity of examining. One would have
felt much inclined to rehabilitate Nestor esslingii as a species
but for the fatal circumstance that one of them has the lower
mandible on one side yellowish-white, betraying the latent
tendency in the bird to albinism. I still feel satisfied, there-
fore, that this handsome bird is only a variety of Nestor
meridionalis, the most variable of all our indigenous Parrots.
2. Stringops habroptilus, Gray. (Kakapo.)
I have described in ?The Birds of New Zealand? (vol. i.,
pp. 177-78) several remarkable varieties of this bird, the
tendency generally being towards a more or less yellow
plumage. The bird exhibited this evening is no exception to
that rule. It is paler-coloured than any specimen I have
hitherto seen, the entire under-surface being dull lemon-
yellow clouded with obscure green and brown, the upper
parts much suffused with yellow, the tail-feathers clear lemon-
yellow with black shafts and obscurely barred and toothed
with brown, the primaries lemon-yellow and the secondaries
greenish-yellow, with similar blackish-brown markings to
those of the ordinary bird.
3. Apteryx oweni, Gould. (Grey Kiwi.)
This bird is the nearest approach to a perfect albino that I
have yet met with among individuals of this species, there
being only a tinge of yellowish-brown on the plumage of the
upper surface. As already mentioned, I have recorded five
albinoes, all more or less stained with yellow or brown, and
one partial albino, presenting only irregular patches of white.
This specimen was received from Canterbury ; so also were
the other two birds described above.


Aet. X. ?On the Wetas, a Group of Orthopterous Insects
inhabiting New Zealand; zuith Descriptions of Two Nezo
Species.
By Sir Waltee L. Bullee, K.C.M.G., D.Se., F.R.S.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 19th September,
1894.]
In Gray?s ? Zoological Miscellany,? 1842, p. 78, there first
appeared a description of the great forest Weta of New
Zealand, under the name of Deiziacrida heteracazitha, White,
A further account of this remarkable insect was given in
the List of the Fauna appended to Dieffenbach?s ? Travels
in New Zealand,? from which I extract the following:
? The length of the specimen brought by Dr. Dieffenbach,
measuring from the forehead to the end of the abdomen,
exclusive of appendages, is 2in.; from the end of the tarsus of
hind leg to end of antenna stretched out, this specimen mea-
sures at least 12-|in. The specimen may be in the larva state.
The preesternum, as in Anostostoma, with two spines approxi-
mating in the middle; meso- and meta-sternum deeply
grooved behind, with a strong tooth on the sides behind.
Dr. Andrew Sinclair, since my short description was pub-
lished in the second part of Mr. Gray?s Miscellany, has
brought from New Zealand a specimen of this species
which, with its hind legs and antennae stretched out, is at
least 14in. long; its head and body, exclusive of append-
ages, being The specimen is a female ; its ovipositor
is rather more than lin. long, is slightly bent upwards
and compressed through the greater part of its length, the
two cultelli forming its principal part being somewhat
angular at the base. Nearly the whole insect is of an
ochry-yellow colour, the end of the ovipositor and the
extreme tip of the spines on the legs being brown; the
margins of the abdominal segments are of a lighter colour;
the transversely - ridged and rough - surfaced femora have
many light-coloured streaks. The greater portion of the
dorsal part of the thorax is somewhat ferruginous. This
specimen was found by itself on the marsh-pine in Wai-
heke, in the Firth of the Thames. Five other specimens
of smaller size Dr. Sinclair found congregated under the
bark of trees.?*
The last-mentioned specimens belonged, no doubt, to the
species afterwards described as Deinacrida (. Ilemideina)
thoracica, White (Voy. Ereb. and Terr., Ins., 1846).
* Op. cit vol. ii., p. 280.


In 1867 I published in the ? Zoologist,? page Bï¿½o, the
description of a new species, Hemideina megacephala, Buller,
distinguished by its enormous head.
In 1869 ten more names were added to the group, namely:
Hemideina producta (afterwards referred by Professor Hutton
to H. thoracica) H. Capitolina, H. figurata, H. abbreviata,
H. tibialis, Ceuthophilus (?) lanceolatus, Macropathus filifer,
M. fascifer, and M. altus (White, Cat. Locustidae); also
Hadencecus edicardsii (Scudder, Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat.
Hist., xii., p. 408).
In 1870 I communicated a paper to this Society (Trans.
N. Inst., vol. hi., pp. 34-37) in which I republished my
account of Hemideina megacephala, and described a new
species under the name of Deinacnda rugosa, Buller (with
figures of both).
In 1880 Mr. Colenso described (Trans. N.Z. Inst., vol. xiy.,
p. 278), under the name of Hemideina gigantea, ?a species
bigger in every way than D. heteracantha,? adding, ?it is also
much more spiny, and differs greatly in colours,? &c. He at
the same time described (tom. cit., p. 240) another species,
Hemideina speluncce, giving as its habitat ? dark underground
caves near the head of the Manawatu River, in the Forty-mile
Bush.?
Respecting the first-named of these Mr. Colenso gave some
very interesting historical particulars.
An admirable figure of Deinacrida heteracantha appeared
in the ?Zoology of the Erebus and Terror,? part ?Insects,?
p. 24, pi. 5, fig. i.; and in 1868 Professor Hochstetter pub-
lished a good figure in outline (? New Zealand,? p. 170),' with
a brief and somewhat inaccurate account of the insect, con-
cluding with this remark: ? Despite its hideous looks it is
perfectly harmless.?
Mr. "Colenso stated in 1880 (Z.c., p. 280) that his unique
specimen of Hemideina gigantea had then been forty-two
years in spirits with its colours unaltered, the liquid in the
glass bottle containing it being still clear and pure. To this
we must now add thirteen years more ; so that the specimen
has been canonized for more than half a century. I think
the beautiful female specimen of Deinacrida heteracantha in
my son?s collection can show almost as good a record. It is
amongst the earliest recollections of my life that, about forty-
five years ago, wandering through the woods at Tangiteroria
with my private tutor, Dr. Beard, we found this huge Weta at
the foot of a tree, and brought it home in a silk pocket-hand-
kerchief. Being something of a naturalist, the doctor care-

fully stuffed the insect and placed it in a small glass show-case
of his own construction, where it has remained hermetically
sealed ever since. It had perhaps a better chance than the
specimen in spirits of preserving its colours, and it is now as
fresh and bright as the day it was stuffed. I remember that
some years later, in riding through a strip of bush between
Mangakahia and Whangarei, I caught a pair of them on a
low tree, where they were apparently feeding on the young
leaves. Dismounting from my horse, I secured the two Wetas
in a pocket-handkerchief, and hung them up in a tree to await
my return a day or two later. On coming back, however, I
found that they had eaten their way out and made their escape.
For many years this fine insect has been looked upon as
extinct, and it certainly is extremely rare; but since my last
return from England I have been fortunate enough to secure
the large male specimen now on the table. I purchased it
from a dealer in Auckland, who told me he had procured it
from one of the small wmoded islands in the Hauraki Gulf.
Formerly it was very abundant in all the woods at the far
north ; but I never heard of its being found south of the
Waikato district. The Maoris attribute its disappearance to
the introduced Norway rat. They distinguish it as the Weta-
P In 1884 Mr. Colenso (op. cit., vol. xvii., p. 155) added
another species, under the name of DeinacTida amiget , from
Wairoa, Hawke?s Bay District, stating that it seemed allied to
H. megacephala. In 1886 he described (op. cit., yol. xix.,
p. 145) Hemideina longipes, from a specimen obtained in a
totara forest at Norsewood, in the County of Waipawa.
Finally, in 1888, he described, under the name of Hemideina
miens' 1 , ? a peculiar species, differing from other described ones
in its general very dark colour, extreme glossiness,? &c.
It will be seen, therefore, that Mr. Colenso has added no
less than five species to the list. I have not had an oppor-
tunity of examining any of his types, and cannot therefore
express any opinion as to the value of his specific characters.
After a careful study, however, of his descriptions, I am satis-
fied that none of them apply to the fine insect which I have
the pleasure of exhibiting to-night, and for the loan of which
lam indebted to Mr. Teutenberg, of Auckland. He informed
me that he obtained it at Coromandel, but he could give me
no particulars respecting it. Judging by its character, I
should say it is an inhabitant of caves or overhanging rocks.
Genus Macropathus, Walker.
Group 4.
Macropathus maximus, sp. Nov.
Male. ?Body stout, convex, smooth, not shining. General


colour rich tawny-brown, darker on the joints, and deepening
to reddish-brown on the hind tibiae; changing to yellow on the
face, front tarsi, and greater part of antennae. Head short,
fore part vertical. Eyes prominent, rounded, and blackish-
brown in colour, as is also the slightly-polished vertex.
Maxillary palpi long and slender; the fourth joint somewhat
longer than the third ; the fifth appreciably longer, and dis-
tinctly subclavate. Labrum prominent; labial palpi clavate
at the tip. Antennae extremely long and slender, being more
than six times the length of the body ; the first joint much
thickened, the rest smooth and even, being entirely free from
the minute knobs and spines that occur on the antennae of
Macropathus fascifer. Prothorax well covered with shield,
which is broadest behind, the lower border being slightly
reflexed. Mesothorax and metathorax presenting broad, even
segments; the eight abdominal dorsal segments much
narrower, closely set, and gradually diminishing in size
towards the extremity; cerci of moderate length and beset
with fine hairs, especially towards the base. Abdomen short,
slightly compressed. Legs slender, extremely long, and very
spiny; hind femora greatly swollen towards the base; knees
nodose. The four anterior femora have spines beneath, but
the number is uncertain ; thus, of the first pair the right-hand
femur has four spines, and the left-hand femur five spines ; of
the pair behind, the right femur has two on one side and five
on the other, whilst the left femur has three on each side ;
the hind femora, on their channelled posterior surface, have
twelve to thirteen sharp spines, set well apart, on one side,
and twenty-three to twenty-five small closely-set ones on the
other side. So also with the tibiae : the first pair have each
five extremely fine spines, or rather spurs, on each side, the
apical ones being the longest; of the next or middle pair the
right-hand tibia has three on one side and four on the other,
whilst the left-hand tibia has three on one side and two on
the other. The hind tibiae are armed with a regular double
series of sharp, slightly-decurved spines, exactly resembling
the thorns on a rose-bush, those towards the base being
extremely minute, and the apical or terminal ones very long ;
the right-hand tibia has twelve on one side and fourteen on the
other, wdiilst the left-hand tibia has twelve on one side and
eleven on the other. It will be seen, therefore, that the
number of spines is a very uncertain character. The body,
without the appendages, measures exactly lin. in length and
0-4 in. in its widest part; the hind femora measure 2in., and
the hind tibiae 2 - 25 in.; the cerci, which are slightly curved
upwards, measure 0 - 3 in.; and the antennae 6'2sin.
I have made this Weta the representative of a fourth group
of Walker?s genus Macropathus. It may, however, be neces-


sary to make it the type of an entirely new genus. It differs
from the typical Macropathus in having a dull or plain, and
not a shining, surface ; and, like Deinacrida, it has ten dorsal
segments behind the thoracic shield, instead of eight as in
M. fascifer. It has fine and slender antennae, in which respect
also it comes near to Deinacrida ; it has numerous spines on
the four anterior femora, whereas M. fascifer has only two ;
and, whilst the latter has only four or five minute spurs on the
inner edge of the hind femora, with ten on the outer edge,
this form has both sides spiny in their whole length.

Genus Deinacrida, White.
I have now to describe another new species of Weta, which
has been in my son?s collection for some years. It was ob-
tained by Mr. J. Brough in the Nelson Provincial District,
and sent over preserved in spirits. Unfortunately the antennae
are wanting, but in every other respect the specimen is per-
fect. It seems to belong to the genus Deinacrida, and conies
nearer to my Deinacrida rugosa than to D. heteracantha ; but
it is very small, even as compared with the former, and has
other distinguishing features.
I exhibit this rare specimen alongside of the larger species.
In addition to its diminutive size, it will be seen that the
dorsal segments, or dermal plates if I may so term them, have
a peculiar emarginate character, presenting the appearance of
of a miniature coat of mail.
Deinacrida parva, sp. Nov.
Male. ?Body rounded above, somewhat compressed on the
sides. Head slightly punctured on the vertex ; thoracic shield
more distinctly punctured ; of the ten dorsal segments behind
it, the two first have a slightly roughened surface, and the six
abdominal ones are distinctly emarginate in the middle, with
almost imperceptibly raised edges. Legs somewhat shorter
in proportion than in D. heteracantha. Labial and maxillary
palpi clavate at the tips. Cerci minute. Four anterior
femora free from spines. Tibiae quadrangular, both the inner
edges armed with sharp spines. Hind femora similarly arnied,
hind tibiae broader behind than on the sides, and furnished
with sharp spines coming out alternately; their posterior
edges also armed with minute spurs. General colour ochre-
yellow; the thoracic shield dull reddish-brown, and the
abdomen beneath darker. Length of the body, without
appendages, IT; hind femora, 075 ; hind tibiae, 075; tarsus
.and claws, 0-30.

Art. Xl.? Observations on some peculiar Maori Remains,
with Remarks on the Ancient Institution of Tapu.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.R.S.
[Bead before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 28th November, 1894.]
I have the pleasure of exhibiting this evening for your in-
spection two somewhat remarkable specimens of Maori re-
mains, respecting each of which I will offer one or two
observations.
The first of these is a portion of a cranium of extraordinary
thickness, exceeding even that of the Chatham Island Moriori,
of which an example drawn from the collection in the Colonial
Museum is now on the table. The specimen is too imperfect
to admit of my giving many measurements. But, with a
minimum frontal diameter of 100 mm. and an external bi-
orbital diameter of 113 mm., it presents a maximum thickness
of 10mm. The maximum thickness of the same bone in the
Moriori is Bmm. With these specimens I exhibit a very
typical Maori skull from the Island of Kapiti (presumably that
of a Ngatitoa warrior), and also, for purposes of comparison,
the skull of a Mallicolo Indian from the New Hebrides Group.
The former has a lofty forehead and presents generally an
intellectual character ; whilst the latter is so depressed that
it appears to have no forehead at all, this extraordinary shape
of the head being due, it is said, to artificial pressure during
infancy. Adopting the formula used by Professor Scott in
his able paper ? On the Osteology of the Maori and Moriori,?
which appeared in our last volume of ? Transactions,? it may
be useful to give the comparative measurements of these two
skulls, which are as follows :

assumed that its original owner was one of the ancestors of
the Muaupoko people, now residing at Horowhenua.
The other specimen is part of a Maori skull, in which there
is an abnormal growth of one of the teeth. It will be seen
that the left upper canine or ?eye-tooth? is turned com-
pletely upside down in its socket, the crown appearing in the
region of the nostril, and the fang coming out in the roof of
the mouth or palate. From the condition of the adjoining bi-
cuspid, the enamel being worn away by long grinding and the
dentine exposed, it evidently belonged to an adult, presumably
a person past middle age. The reversed tooth is of the normal
length, and its singular position is perhaps due to some injury
to the upper jaw during youth, but not during infancy, because
this is a fully-developed second tooth. The proper socket has
become obliterated by absorption, and a thick covering of
bone has been formed in front of the eccentric tooth, giving
quite a normal appearance to the jaw.
This relic was obtained by my son in 1878 from a wahi
tapu or sacred grove some six or seven miles up the Opotiki
River, on the East Coast. The place of sepulture w r as a
hollow tree about 4ft. in diameter. The bones of the dead had
been deposited within the tree from an aperture about 12ft.
from the ground, and the interments had been continued from
time to time, till the hollow tree was completely filled up with
human remains. For a long period of time this burial-place,
protected by a thick clump of bush, had been unvisited by any
Maori, the resident tribes having, with the advent of civilisa-
tion, adopted other modes of disposing of their dead. But
the hollow tree-trunk, containing the remains of a former
generation, had decayed with time and broken asunder, dis-
charging its ghastly memorials in a confused heap all around.
At the time of my son?s visit, in company with Captain Mair,
the place was so strictly tapu that it was considered unsafe for
any European to trespass upon it, to say nothing of inter-
fering with the human relics. My son had therefore to content
himself with only a hurried inspection, and, in order to bring
away the remarkable specimen now exhibited, had to break off
and leave behind the major part of the skull. I believe
the clump of bush is still under strict tapu, and it will pro-
bably remain so for many years to come. The island in the
Papaitonga Lake, on the other hand, where he obtained the
heavy cranium now exhibited, although the scene of a terrible
slaughter, and practically the cemetery of the Muaupoko tribe,
has never been tapu at all. This will no doubt seem strange
to you, but it is readily explainable. The two cases afford
a good illustration of the manner in which the Maoris of old
understood and interpreted what Mr. Colenso has fittingly
termed ? that mysterious and intricate institution of the tapu."


The tapu, with its many rites, forms, and observances, was,
so to speak, the foundation of Maori society, and the bulwark
of tribal existence. The tapu ? commenced with the birth of
the New-Zealander, continued with him throughout life in all its
varied scenes, and did not leave him until long after he was in
the grave. The tapu regulated, or pretended to regulate, all his
movements. It certainly enabled the Maoris to accomplish
many heavy and useful works which without it they could not
have done. Through it their large cultivations, their fisheries,
their fine villages and hill forts, their fine canoes, their good
houses, their large seine-nets, their bold carvings, and a
hundred other things were accomplished?without possessing
either iron or metal. Through it their fowl, and fish, and
forests were preserved ; ? and through it the tombs and graves
of their dead ?objects held sacred even by the most untutored
savage ?w r ere preserved inviolable. This far-reaching law of
tapu had, as may readily be believed, a powerful influence
over the Maori mind; so much so that, as Mr. Colenso adds,
?the stoutest and fiercest of the chiefs bowed like an infant
before it, and dared not disobey its behests.? The tribal
burial-place at Opotiki, primitive as it was, necessarily came
under the protection of tapu in its strictest and most uncom-
promising form. On the other hand, the beaten Muau-
poko, stripped of everything, and reduced in numbers to a
mere remnant, who took refuge in the mountains,, never dared
to impose the spell of the tapu on the scene of their discom-
fiture and entombment. No better proof, perhaps, could be
given of the complete conquest of the Muaupoko at that time
by the Ngatitoa and Ngatiraukawa than the inability of the
survivors ever afterwards to enforce the observance of this rite. r
The nearest approach to it is what I have myself done in this
present year of grace. I will explain. Among those who
were killed in the great fight at Papaitonga was a celebrated
chieftess named Te Eiunga, an ancestress of the well-known
chief Major Kemp Te Rangihiwinui. The island having come
into my possession, I have erected upon it, in front of a grove
of karaka-trees, the famous carved canoe ? Te Koangaorehua,?
brought from Wanganui for that purpose. This monumental
tomb, formed out of the end of a totara canoe of large dimen-
sions, and elaborately carved to represent three human figures,
one above the other, was erected some seventy years ago at
Pipiriki (fifty miles up the Wanganui River) to mark the
resting-place of Te Mahutu. After the battle of Moutoa, in
1863, when so many ? friendlies ? fell fighting on our side
* According to the doctrine of law which governs the Native Land
Court, conquest, unless followed by actual occupation, confers no title to
the land.


against the Hauhaus for the protection of Wanganui, it was
decided to bring this monument down the river to Putiki, and
erect it in the cemetery there in memory of those who had
been killed, for the bones of Te Mahutu had long since been
removed from Pipiriki to their final resting-place. This was
accordingly done, and, whilst the loyal Natives were erecting
their simple obelisk in the graveyard, Dr. Featherston, the
Superintendent of Wellington, was uncovering a handsome
marble monument in the Market Square at Wanganui, erected
by the province to the memory of these brave defenders. But,
owing to defective workmanship, in less than twenty years the
carved monument toppled over, and, being still more or less
tapu, was allowed to remain another ten years on the ground,
having become in time completely hidden from view by a
dense growth of vegetation. In order that it might be erected
as a tolm for his ancestress, Te Riunga, Major Kemp presented
to me this interesting monument, and it was accordingly con-
veyed by train to Papaitonga. It is still in an excellent state
of preservation, and will, I trust, in its new location long
remain to interest the visitor, whilst it marks the scene of one
of the most cruel passages in Maori history.
Having said so much about the institution of tapu, I will
ask your permission to quote here the evidence given by the
well-known chief Hohepa Tamamutu, of Taupo, in the Native
Land Court at Cambridge, at the hearing of the Whakamaru
case, in 1883, because it is a very clear and authoritative
statement; ?
? The law of tapu is a universal custom among our race.
There are many kinds of tapu, and it belonged to the owners
of the land to decide the nature of the tapu they imposed
upon any land. It was the right of the relations of the dead,
being owners, to impose a tapu; and theirs only. x\n at-
tempt by any others than the owners would be valueless.
? I will give instances : Wharengaro was one of the prin-
cipal chiefs of Taupo. He died at Te Ariki, in the Arawa
country, and was interred in the middle of a plantation where
potatoes and kumaras had been grown. In fact, he was
buried just where he fell ?in his blood as he was shot. Te
Hirapango was his companion, and shared his fate and his
grave ; but the tribe could not whakatapu the spot, because,
while the dead chiefs were Ngatituwharetoa, the land belonged
not to them but to the Tuhourangi. Had it been their own
land they could have proclaimed it tapu. Long after', when
the flesh was decayed, the bones were exhumed and removed
to Tongariro ; but the land was never tapu, and it is not so
now.
? On the other hand, Te Heuheu (the elder) was buried by
a landslip at Te Eapa, between Tokanu and Waihi. The


village was on the edge of the lake, and was completely buried.
In consequence of this, the entire lake and the land within
defined limits was tapu, lest the fish of the one and the pro-
ductions of the other should be eaten by any one. This was
proclaimed by Te Heuheu Iwikau. Nothing from the lake ?
fish, koura, &c. ?could have been eaten on pain of death. It
was not till five years after that the present Te Heuheu
removed the tapu. He was the man whose right it was to
do so, being the son of the deceased chief; and it was done to
secure provisions for the gathering held for the lamentation
over his father. No foreign chief could have done it. The
ceremony was that the fish were caught, then removed to a
place still tapu, and then cooked; then given to the priest,
the ariki, and then eaten by him solemnly. No meaner
person could have dared to do so. The high priest, the ariki,
on this occasion, was Te Takinga, and it was his office to eat
these first-fruits of the land.
? I take the instance of Te Eangituamatotoro. After his
death he was conveyed by Tamaira to Motu-taiko. An earth-
quake shattered the island, and the bones fell into the lake.
The water of the lake within certain limits was whakatapued.
Now, there was a certain shallow (tahuna ) in the lake that
was a favourite fishing-ground, but it has been tapu ever since,
and it is so still, and no one will dare to fish there.
? In all my experience I have never met with a single in-
stance of a tapu laid by a foreign tribe upon land not their
own property. Were such a thing attempted it would not be
respected.
?I knew Totoia; also his elder brother, Te Ihukino. I
heard of the tapu imposed because of his death. I was present
at Waikari wdien Te Kaperakau and the others were there.
Te Kaperakau?grandfather of Aperahama Te Kume [the
claimant] ?and the rest started to look for his body, but it
could not be found. Totoia was a man of great consequence,
as is proved by the land being made tapu for his sake. It was
Te Kaperakau and Te Eeweti who proclaimed the tapu.?
A witness, however, on the other side gave the following
evidence : ? When I and my party visited Maungaiti we found
Totoia living there alone. He was growing potatoes : that was
ail I saw. We slept there one night, and went on the next
morning. Totoia gave us supper and lodging. There w T ere
several houses, but much. dilapidated, and he himself had
grown very old. He said that was his settlement. He w r as
dressed in a cat-skin rug, painted inside with red ochre. The
skins were of different colours. He wore it by day and he
slept in it by night. We went on from Maungaiti to Tapapa
and took up our residence there. After this we heard of To-
toia?s death at Maungaiti. I do not know how he died. We


did not go to fetch his body or look for it. The Ngatikikopiri
did go, but I heard that it was supposed the pigs had devoured
him, for he could not be found. . . I heard that Wahineiti
died at Tauranga a natural death. His body was brought back
to Patetere by the Ngatikea and the Arawa, and was deposited
at Omaruapu in a small wooden hut in which he was seated.
Then all Ngatiraukawa were summoned by messengers to
come and see him. They assembled, and when they saw him
they chanted a funeral dirge, to which Ngatikea and the
Arawa responded; and then the Ngatiraukawa removed the
body to Maungaiti, resting at Tokoroa on the way. On the
birth of the child of Rangitaiki (the chief of Ngatikikopiri) it
was called * Nga-wi-o-Tokoroa,? and Hape?s child was named
Horohau, from the grass on which the corpse had lain and
the wind that blew over it as it rested there. The body was
then interred by the Ngatiraukawa at Maungaiti, because
that was his own special territory. His remains were sub-
sequently removed to Waotu when those of Hape were re-
moved from Mangatautari, for the chiefs of the Ngatikikopiri
decided that the two brothers should rest together.?" 5
Referring to this, Hitiri Paerata (the hero of Orakau), who
also gave evidence in the case, said, ? Wahineiti was travel-
ling through and died, and was taken to his own place. It
was only the great people who were taken to the tribal
sepulchres. The common people were buried where they died
?anywhere.?
I offer no apology for giving you these long extracts, be-
cause this evidence has never been published, and appears to
me of considerable interest. lam of opinion that there would
be no surer way of compiling a true history of the Maori
people than by sifting and comparing the evidence recorded by
the Judges of the Native Land Courts all over the country
during the last thirty years. Of course much of it is unreliable
and worthless; but that there are treasures of unspeakable
value to the future Maori historian scattered through these
countless volumes cannot for a moment be doubted. The real
information is to be found in the private note-books of the
Judges rather than in the minute-books of the Court, which
for the most part are mere records of proceedings, or, at best,
contain a mere outline of the evidence. For a period of six-
teen years an accomplished Maori scholar occupied the posi-
tion of Chief Judge of the Native Land Court, and I believe it
was always his desire that a systematic effort should be made
* Wahineiti, the elder brother of Hape, died at Tauranga. He said
to Ngatikea, ? Don?t take me to Maungatautari, but to Tokoroa, that the
rushes of my land may grow over me ; that I may drink the dews of Toko-
roa. ? This occasioned the name of ? Horohau.? Therefore ? Nga-wi-o-
Tokoroa ? became a proverb. (Evidence of Aperahama Te Kume.)


to collate this information and place it on record in some per-
manent form. A volume of ? Important Judgments ?of the
Court was published some years ago, but nothing more has
been achieved, if we except the publications, from time to time,
of individual Judges of the Court. It is not too late now, for
it is well known that the most capable of these Judges have
preserved all their note-books. In the hands of a skilful com-
piler, possessing the necessary qualifications, a most interest-
ing and valuable volume would be the result. For example,
what could be more spirited than the sketch of Maori history
contained in Mr. Fenton?s judgment in the celebrated Pukeha-
moamoa case at Hawke?s Bay?one of the last delivered by
him ?or what more poetic than the evidence in that case of
Noa Te Huke, who rested his whole title on the dying words
of his female ancestor, ? Take me not away from the land, but
bury me within hearing of the Eangitahi waterfall ? ?
There is another consideration to be borne in mind, and it
is this : that, in the case of evidence given on oath, the natural
tendency to romance is necessarily somewhat if not entirely
curbed, and that consequently by this means a truer narrative
ought as a rule to be obtained than by any other mode of
inquiry. What, for example, could be more realistic and
apparently truthful than the following passage taken from the
evidence of Matiaha Peko, in the Rangatira case (1882), about
the killing of Totohu ? ?? I was born at Te Ngei, and am the
son of Takiau, the same man who killed Totohu in company
with Te Kapiti, at Te Karangi, on the Pourewa. They killed
him for stealing the eels there. Then they cut him up and ate
him ?ate the whole of him, except the head, and that we put
on a pole. We dried it, Maori fashion (mohomo'kai) , and took
it to Turakina. There was a kumara ground there, and we set
up the head on it to scare the pukekos. Afterwards it was
thrown into an eel-pond or lagoon at Waxwhero. I helped to
eat him. I saw the head. It was a huge head, with crisp
hair, like a negro?s ( poriki ), and the face completely covered
with tatooing. He was said to belong to Ngatihauiti.?
It would not require much play of the imagination to sup-
pose that the remarkably thick cranium which I have exhibited
this evening belonged to just such a head as that so graphi-
cally described by Matiaha Peko?that of the unhappy eel-
poacher, Totohu.


Art. Xll. ? Note on the Vegetable Caterpillar (Cordiceps ro-
bertsii).
By Sir Walter L, Buller, K.C.M.G., D.Sc., F.E.S.
[Read before the Wellington Philosophical Society, 20th February, 1895.]
Plate VIII.
In the discussion which followed the reading of Mr. Haskell's
paper on the 14th November, I maintained, in opposition to
that gentleman's definition??animal at one end, vegetable
at the other??that the so-called Vegetable Caterpillar, as we
now find it, is entirely vegetable substance. The author, as
I understood him, contended that the body of the caterpillar
had become permeated with vegetable tissue, but that the
outer integument or skin was still dried animal matter. To
put an end to any possible doubt on the subject, I forwarded
to Sir James Hector a specimen of the Vegetable Caterpillar,
and asked him to get it examined and tested by the Govern-
ment Analyst, for the purpose of ascertaining its true con-
stituents. The following result has been officially commu-
nicated to me ;
Mr. Skby.
The question at issue is, whether the skin of the caterpillar re-
mains, or if it has been converted into fungus like the soft internal tissues.
The presence or absence of chitine will determine the question. Save
the specimen for reference.
James Hector. 22/11/94.
Vegetable Caterpillar.?For animal matter in the so-called skin.
The skin does not give any indication of the presence of chitine or
other animal substance. It burns without intumescence, and does not
evolve the odour of nitrogenous matter in combustion.
William Skey. 23/11/94.
In the course of my remarks at the meeting I stated that
I had dug up in the woods hundreds of this singular product,
and that in every instance that had come under my observa-
tion the caterpillar, in the living state, had descended into
the ground tail-foremost, the stem of the fungus afterwards
springing from a point between the back of the head and the
first fold of the neck, and then ascending vertically to reach
the light. Since that date I have been examining the speci-
mens in my collection, and I have found one very curious
example in which there is evidence of a different proceeding
on the part of the caterpillar, with exactly similar growth of
the fungus. In this instance the caterpillar had evidently
buried itself head-foremost, and then turned its head slightly
to the left, whereupon the fungus had commenced its stem-
growth at the usual point and travelled upwards in a line


with the body, curving and twisting somewhat before emerg-
ing at the surface of the ground.
In most specimens the stem is more or less twisted and
sometimes bifurcate before it reaches the surface, after which
it assumes a perfectly erect character, the fructification being
at the top, Sin. or 4in. of the terminal part being covered
with closely-set spores, having externally a granulate appear-
ance. The longest stems I have met with ordinarily measure
Tin. or Sin. from the insertion to the extreme tip.
I trust I have made myself sufficiently clear, but the
peculiarity I have been describing is better seen on the ac-
companying plate (reduced from a photograph), in which
fig. 1 represents this abnormal form. Figs. 2 and 3on the
same plate exhibit the Vegetable Caterpillar as it is ordinarily
met with (upper and lower aspect), the smaller of the two
showing the branched process I have mentioned, about an inch
from its head. Fig. 4 illustrates the curved manner in which
the caterpillar sometimes disposes its body before undergoing
its final transmutation into fungus. The body of the speci-
men represented by fig. 1 measures 75mm., and its stem,
measured in a straight line, 150 mm. Although the cater-
pillars are of about equal size, the stem of No. 1, owing to its
eccentric manner of growth, is 2-sin. longer than that of
No. 2. (The body of the largest of the caterpillars here
figured measures exactly Sin. in length.)
The popular notion that the Vegetable Caterpillar is found
only under rata and kauri trees is quite an erroneous one. It
is abundant in the southern parts of the North Island, where
the kauri does not exist, and I have found it in localities from
which the rata is entirely absent ?for example, in small
clumps of bush in the Taupo country. Indeed, it may be
looked for in all suitable places, although, as a rule, it is more
numerous near the summits of the wooded ranges, the fungus
shooting up its little stem, like a miniature bulrush, among the
dead leaves and decaying vegetation which cover the ground
in such situations, often to the depth of several inches. After
scraping away this surface covering it is necessary to dig out
the Vegetable Caterpillar very carefully with a sheath-knife,
the slightest attempt at forcing it up breaking the stem and
destroying the specimen. Sometimes several are found
grouped together within a foot of each other ; but it requires
a practised eye to distinguish the tiny stem among its sur-
roundings of a similar hue. It is often rooted up and eaten
by the wild pigs, and in the Taupo country I found the Wood-
hen digging up and devouring it. When fresh it has a
pleasant nut-like flavour.
