The
Martyrdom of Servia.
A cablegram published in the
Australian daily Press on Janu-
ary 17th, 1918, stated that: —
“A Servian manifesto has been issued
protesting against the annihilation of
the race.
The Austrians, it is stated, have car-
ried on wholesale deportations of Servian
boys to Germany and Galacia, and have
sent 15,000 to concentration camps. They
have also deported 2500 young children.
Simultaneously thousands of lads have
been sent to Asia Minor, and thousands
of girls to Turkish harems. Now the
Bulgarians are systematically deporting
whole, families for the purpose of wip-
ing out all traces of Servian nationality.
They are also removing priests, school-
masters, and doctors.”
A later cablegram stated: —
Sir Charles Wade, Agent-General for
N.S.W., in writing to the Premier that,
on behalf of New South Wales, he had
allotted £470 to the Serbian Relief Fund
and £lOO to the Montenegrin Red Cross
and Relief Fund, enclosed the copy of
a speech by a Serbo-Croat Deputy in
the Austrian Parliament, exposing “the
horrors perpetrated on Serbo-Croats.
Austrian subjects, with the sanction of
the Austrian Government.
The speech referred to the systematic
extermination of Serbo-Croats “by hal-
ter, bullet, and bayonet, dungeon, de-
portation, imprisonment, and evacua-
tion; by court-martial, famine, concen-
tration camps, and by intentional! y-
induced disease.
Serbs were compelled to dig their own
graves and lie down in them. Many
women lay in their graves with their
children in their arms. The soldiers
shot them one by one. The survivors
had to shovel earth upon the dead until
it came to their turn to be shot, and
then the graves were filled in by sol-
diers.
In one village a priest was hanged
as a hostage, and in another the soldiers
drove the inhabitants at the point of
the bayonet into the courtyard of the
school, and shot them down like rabbits
in a battue. Other people were drown-
ed, and another lot were tied to hay-
stacks, which were set on fire. Many of
these innocent victims remained up-
buried for weeks, and their eyes were
picked out by ravens.
Evacuated Istrians died in thousands
like flies of hunger, cold, spotted typhus,
and other diseases.
Picture this hideous atrocity in
your mind, if you can! Think of
the horrors and sufferings that
must have associated with
this wholes»«*« deportation of
men, women, and children to
foreign lands; and in the case of
girls, to a vile servitude that must
be worse than death. What had
these people done to deserve such
treatment? And who were the
inhuman monsters that planned
and perpetrated it? The cable-
gram supplies the answer. The
unhappy people are natives of
Servia, and their destroyers are
the Austrians. But the cablegram
conveniently hides the real perpe-
trators of this horrible crime, as
well as the motives that inspired
it- To get at these we must re-
view the conditions of the two
countries before the war began-
The Driving Power.
The prime movers in the whole
catastrophe have their seat at the
Vatican. Servia is a small nation,
whose people almost wholly ad-
hered to the Orthodox Greek
Church, Austria, on the other


hand, is intensely Roman Catho-
lic, having been dominated for
centuries by the Papacy. During
the long reign of the late aged
Emperor Francis Joseph, the
Jesuits were the real rulers. The
Emperor was a mere baby in their
hands, and he did all they wished.
Within the last ten years of his
life he had become such a fanatic
that he would not sign a public
document without consulting the
Papal nuncio- The Vatican
wanted to be supreme in Servia,
and under the Jesuits’ per-
nicious advice the attitude of the
Austrian Government became
horrible. The Emperor virtually
closed the country to any com-
mercial intercourse with the rest
of the world. The poor people
could find no market other than
Austria for their scanty products.
They were under 'heavy taxation,
and were obliged to sell at prices
dictated by the Austrian com-
merce. They had to suffer greatly
on account of their religion.
Rome named the Government of
Austria “Protector Fidi” in Ser-
via. Priests and monks were sent
into the country by thousands. A
Jesuit in Servia could do just
what he pleased by merely
threatening to report to the Aus-
trian Government if his actions
were in any way interfered with-
Thus the Servian people groaned
under the heel of their oppressors,
hoping that at the death of the
old Emperor there would be a
change for the better-
But, though monarchs pass
away, the Papacy never dies. The
Vatican, with an eye to future
conquests for the Church, called
to its aid the Archduke Franz
Ferdinand, and promised him the
crown on condition of submission
to certain stipulations. The Arch-
duke now became a devoted in-
strurnent of the Church. Ihere
was not a church feast at which
he was not present. He sub-
scribed to all pious congregations
and societies. Visited the poor,
and made tours of the country,
religion being the theme of all his
speeches and conversations. As
to Servia, he declared that he
would break down the religious
and political barriers that separa-
ted the two countries. And he suc-
ceeded under the guidance of the
Jesuits at every step, in obliging
the Government of Servia to
make a concordat with Rome. It
was signed July 6, 1914, and had
the effect of uniting the Roman
Church with the State. It gave
to the Church of Rome in Servia
a place of privilege and leverage
for which there was no warrant
in view of the overwhelming
Greek Orthodox character of the
population. Romanism obtained
a footing in the schools such as it
could not have had before. Reli-
gious teachers were to be paid by
the State for imparting instruc-
tion to the Roman Catholic chil-
dren. Children born of mixed
marriages were to be handed over
to the priests to be reared as Ro-
man Catholics. The Roman Cath-
olic Archbishop and Bishop were
to be granted an annual salary,
and a pension on retiring. Roman
Catholic priests were to be re-
leased from military service, and
the ecclesiastical courts were to
be given special privileges in cer-
tain categories of cases, notably
those relating to marriage and di-
vorce- All these articles were de-
signed to pave the way for the
ultimate domination of Austrian
Roman Catholicism, and with it,
of the Austrian Monarchy.
This Concordat, it is needless
to say. was most abhorrent to the
Servian people, and they became


infuriated with indignation. The
Holy Synod of the Greek Church
took the part of the people
against the Servian Government,
which had been hoodwinked by
Jesuit intrigue, and asked Rus-
sia if it would leave a people, at-
tached to it by ties of treaty and
religion, to perish. The Crown
Prince, Franz Ferdinand, was the
representative, above all others,
of this political intrigue. Hence
to Servian patriots he was a man
marked for death, and before the
month of July was out his assas-
sination took place.
The death of the Archduke was
a great blow to the Vatican’s
schemes. Austria’s forty-eight
hours’ ultimatum to Servia fol-
lowed. Servia had to consult
Russia, and could not reply in the
limited time accorded. Austria
declared war, Russia came to Ser-
bia’s aid, Germany sprang in,
attacking France through Bel-
gium ; then came England and
Italy, until nearly half the world
has become the scene of strife
and carnage such as has never
before been witnessed.
Thus the world can clearly see
that the ambition of the Papacy
for worldly domination is re-
sponsible for the immediate cause
of the war. The cable tells us
that it is “the Austrians” who are
now deporting the native popula-
tion to other countries; but the
Austrian people and Government
are merelv pawns in the game of
Papal supremacy; the moving
hand is at the Vatican. If “the
Austrians” are to be execrated
for their inhuman cruelties, it
should be remembered that they
are what the Roman Church has
made them. They are but carry-
ing out the requirements of their
spiritual directors, who keep out
of sight-
The Same as in the Days of Old.
Nor is this annihilation of a
people anything new in the an-
nals of the Papacy.
In the valleys of Piedmont there
have lived from the times of the
Apostles a people called Albigen-
ses, who held the faith of Christ
as it was first preached by St.
Paul in the City of Rome, and had
never assented to the corruptions
that were introduced into the
Church during the succeeding
centuries. That they were sound
in the faith may be gathered from
the first Article of their Confes-
sion, which reads. “We believe
and firmly do hold all that is con-
tained in the twelve articles cal-
led the Apostles’ Creed, acount-
ing for heresy whatsoever is dis-
agreeing and not consonant
thereunto.” By the beginning of
the 13th century Biese people had
become very numerous, and Pope
Innocent 111. determined to de-
stroy them. He began by issuing
a decree of excommunication
against them, to render them
odious to the princes and people
of his obedience, bidding no per-
sons to hold communion or com-
merce with them; declared them
to be unworthy of any position
of honour, or inheritance, not so
much as to have a place of burial
among Christians; confiscating
their goods, disinheriting their
children, and razing their houses
to the ground. He issued com-
mands to kings, princes, and
magistrates to search for and root
them out without mercy, giving
their accusers a third part of their
goods.
About the year 1198 this “In-
nocent” erected the Inquisition,
an institution for discovering and
exterminating persons accused of
heresy, with St. Dominic as its
first president. The unhappy Al


bigenses, or Waldenses as they
were sometimes called, were the
first to suffer its cruelties. The
Pope sent out Bulls throughout
Europe, promising paradise to all
who would take up arms against
these people for forty days, grant-
ing to them the same pardons and
indulgences as he did to those
who went to recover the Holy
Land from the possession of the
Saracens. He promised them
freedom from all taxes, a dis-
charge of all debts, the protection
of St. Peter and the Pope, a full
pardon of all their sins here, and
a greater degree of glory here-
after. With such inducements,
“the faithful” flocked to the
Pope’s standard, until about
500,000 men were in arms. He
encouraged the troops with the
title “the army of the Church,”
and called the expedition “the
War for the Crucifix.” Spurred
on by the exhortations of Saint
Dominic, the infuriated host
rushed upon the helpless Al-
bigenses, who were for the most
part unarmed, and with every
kind of cruelty destroyed multi-
tudes of them. One remarkable
instance we have of the Legate’s
zeal who commanded the army at
the storming of Beziers. He gave
strict orders to spare none; and
when he was told there were
many good Catholics among
them, he refused to recall his or-
ders, but cried out, “Kill them all,
the Lord knows who are his.”
Thus in one city alone 6000 were
murdered.
This persecution continued for
about forty years, by which the
chroniclers of the time state that
a million men lost their lives, on
one side or the other, for the per-
secuted defended themselves
when they could, and sold their
lives dearly.
The history of the Papacy
shows that wherever the hier-
archy has been able to command
the secular sword in the interests
of the Church, they have endea-
voured to exterminate those who
would not accept the Papal dog-
mas. Thus in France, that faith-
ful son of the Church, Francis I.
committed thousands of unoffend-
ing citizens to the flames for
nothing but their opposition to
the pretensions of the See of
Rome.
The massacre on St. Bartholo-
mew’s Eve, 1572, is another in-
stance of the Papal policy. In
five days ten thousand Protest-
ants were butchered in Paris
alone, and within two months
thirty thousand more, including
those who perished in the pro-
vinces. The entire massacre
throughout France is rated by
some historians as approaching
a hundred thousand victims.
Again, in 1683, another obedi-
ent son of the Church, the in-
famous monarch, Louis the Four-
teenth, revoked the Edict of
Nantes, which had been passed
for the protection of Protestants
by Henry IV. There was noth-
ing then to protect them from the
cruelty of the Papists. Those who
could fled to other countries, but
the mass of the Protestants had
to remain and suffer. Their
houses were put under double
guards; the gates of cities were
closed upon them ; and those who
were seen trying to escape were
butchered on the spot, or cast
into dungeons. The prisons were
filled to suffocation with innocent
captives, and by exile, massacre,
and incarceration the Protestants
in France were nearly extermin-
ated.
Spain furnishes an awful exhi-
bition of the persecuting spirit of


the Papacy when it has the power
to work its will. There the un-
holy Inquisition, carried on by
the Dominican Order of monks,
quenched in blood every effort of
the people to gain a knowledge
of Scriptural truth. Spanish his-
torians have computed that thirty
thousand persons were burnt at
the stake in Spain alone, and in
1869 their calcined bones were
discovered and laid bare at the
“Quemadero de la Crux” (Burn-
ing-place of the Cross). The
workmen of the corporation of
Madrid, in making some new
streets, cut through the spot were
the burnings took place. The re-
mains of the fires were exposed in
regular layers of long black bands
of 650 feet in length, and of vary-
ing thickness- There were seen
blackened earth and coal, greasy
with human grease, pieces of
burnt clothing, bones, and parti-
ally burnt hair.. All Madrid went
to the spot, and many carried
away portions of the black mass.
“The Imparcial,” of Madrid, May
10. 1869, speaking of the discov-
ery, said:—
“It was the place where Catholics,
pious and bewitched monarchs, permit-
ted rational human creatures of all ages
and of both sexes, to be burnt alive,
victims of the implacable Inquisitions,
slippery monks, and impious ‘defenders
of the faith,’ as those executioners of
Auman thought called themselves. It is
where that unjust and dark tribunal
did its work; where they caused men
and women, boys and girls, accused of
sacrilege and heresy, to breathe their
last breath in the midst of horrible
torments. There the coal, whose re-
mains we now see, after being blesseed
by the Dominican fathers, burnt all
who did not think and believe as the
King and the monks thought or believ-
ed, and who would not serve the in-
terests of tyranny, royal or clerical.
There in the bands one • over another,
we see mixed up with fatty black
earth remains of muscles consumed by
the coal, .calcined bones, remains of gar-
meats singed by the flames, halters still
with coagulated blood, locks of hair im-
perfectly burnt —irresistible witnesses
to the fact that brothers of ours expired
amidst the flames, their hearts beating
with protests against men worse than
hyaenas, judges of perfidious heart and
granite soul, who in the' name of Christ
delivered them to those- fires.”
In the Netherlands, which were
subject to Spain, the Protestants
had a fearful experience. The
publication of the -New Testament
in the Dutch language opened
the eyes of the people, and
brought them into conflict with
the Papal authorities. Fifty thou-
sand persons suffered persecution
in various forms at the instiga-
tion of Charles V. The history of
the Inquisition, in its march of
death through the Netherlands is
one of the darkest pages on re-
cord. There was no kind of
cruelty it did not practise in the
name of “religion” on all who
dared to express an opinion at
variance with the dominant
Church. Philip IT., of Spain, and
the Duke of Alva stand out as
faithful servants of the Pope, and
as monsters of ciuelty; and after
the year T 566 eighteen thousand
persons, under Alva’s order, per-
ished by the hands of the public
executioner.
England would have had a simi-
lar experience had the Spanish
Armada succeeded in its mission,
but by the mercy of God and the
braverv of the British seamen, the
nation was spared the horrors
prepared for it by that Papal visi-
tation.
These events reveal the malig-
nant spirit that is characteristic of
the Papacy towards the people of
any nation who will not accept
its unchristian dogmas or submit
to its assumed authority. And
the annihilation of the Servian
people that is now proceeding


proves that the Church of Rome
has not improved in the least
since the dark days when by the
zeal of the ferocious Dominic, In-
nocent 111. effected the extermin-
ation of the primitive Christians
who dwelt in the valleys of Pied-
mont- Nor is it possible that a
Church that professes to be in-
fallible can improve. Indeed, it
is the proud boast of the Papal
Church that, bein r infallible, she
is incapable of reform. Even were
the Vatican authorities now de-
sirous of eliminating the persecut-
ing spirit entailed upon the
Church by the Bulls of Gregory
VIE, Innocent lIP, Boniface
VIII.. Paul IV., and Pius IX., the
doctrine of Infallibility forbids
them to do so. How can a thing
that is irreformable be reformed?
The Church of Pome cannot re-
nounce her errors and get back to
the spirit of Christ. Every Pope
is bound to maintain the decrees
of his predecessors; and every
bishop and priest binds himself
by oath as follows ;
“I will take care, as far as in me
lies, that it shall he held, taught, and
practised by my subjects, or by those
the care of whom shall appertain to
me in my office. This I promise, vow,
and swear, so help me God.”
So there is no-probability that the
Papal Church will ever be any-
thing but the persecuting Church
that it was in the days when it
could command the secular sv/ord.
If she does not treat the people of
Australia to-day as she is now
treating the oeople of Servia, it is
not because she has not the right
to do so, according to the decrees
of her Popes, but because she has
not the political power. And it
is the business of the Protestant
people of Australia to see that she
does not gain that power. —“Aus-
tralian Christian World.”
Italy’s Raid on Papal Spy Centres.
A German Spy Discovered at the Vatican.
A special telegram from Rome to the
Paris Journal in May 1917 (which was
afterwards cabled to Australia), inform-
ed the world that Monsignor Gerlach, a
German prelate and one of the Pope s
private secretaries, had been arrested
by the Italian Government on a charge
of espionage.
The report refers to what is known
as the “Ger’ach Confederacy,” the chief
of which was Monsignor Von Gerlach,
who, taking advantage of the immun-
ity which he enjoyed at the Vatican, or-
ganised a complete and far-reaching
netword of intrigue.
One ramification of this organisation
was in introducing sabotage into the
Italian navy. Another group of conspir-
ators busied themselves with industrial
sabotage, while a third branch was mob-
ilised for the transport of contraband
across Switzerland.
Every effort was made by Rome to
prevent the publication of the discovery
of this conspiracy. Influence was
brought to bear on the press agencies
to prevent it being cabled. But “The
Menace,” published at Aurora, Missouri,
obtained the facts from the Paris Journ-
al and the “London Star” and gave


them to the public. Then there was a
demand by the American editors that
produced the following account of the
affair. The incident shows the hand of
the Papacy in controlling news agencies
that is disconcerting to the lovers of
liberty. When a pro-German con-
spiracy is discovered in the Pope’s own
household, it leaves no room for doubt-
ing where the sympathies of the Vati-
can are.
The discovery was due to the daring
and cleverness of a naval officer, through
uhose energy the Italian Government
was enabled to lay hands on the entire
band of traitors. This young man dis-
appeared from Italy more than a year
before. He went to Austria, pretending
to be a deserter, and offered his services
to the enemy. They accepted him with
alacrity, and sent him on important
missions throughout Austria. Satisfied
as to his reliability, they dispatched him
to Zurich, to assist in the espionage
against Italy. He was careful to con-
ceal the fact that he spoke German
fluently, and the German and Austrian
officers discussed their plans before him
freely.
He thus learned of the existence of a
strong room belonging to the Austrian
Consulate at Vienna. Great ingenuity
had been expended in making it a se-
cure hiding place for papers of value
to Italy. The Italian officer, by piecing
together scraps of conversations, con-
trived to learn all about this strong
room.
He returned to Italy and placed his
information before the Italian authori-
ties, who immediately set to work.
There were in an Italian prison two
notorious safe-breakers, who had been
sent to prison for life. These were en-
gaged, on a promise of their freedom
and a large spin of money, to break the
safe and secure the papers. They were
told that the safe was filled with deadly
gas, and it was said that if anyone at-
tempted to open it they would be
struck dead on the spot. For attached
to the bundle of documents so highly
desired by three governments was an in-
tricate series of wires. With almost
devilish ingenuity the Germans had pro-
vided that if the safe were opened and
the papers removed, a cloud of poison
gas, deadly in effect, would envelop the
disturber and render the room which
contained the safe, uninhabitable. At
the same time a cleverly devised burg-
lar alarm would call sufficient military
police to the scene to deal with any
number of intruders. A warrant for
the release of these prisoners was sign-
ed by the Prefect of the Italian police,
and on a dark night early in January
they were conducted from the prison
outside Rome and smuggled into
Vienna. They were provided with gas
masks and every tool for safe opening
known to the police or criminal world.
Breaking the safe and evading the cer-
tain death of the gas and the alarm sig-
nals was a comparatively simple mat-
ter to these experts, and the papers
which incriminated prominent persons
throughout Italy were soon in the pos-
session of the secret service.
For obvious reasons they could not in-
stantly communicate their knowledge
to headquarters at Rome, and in the
meantime, while announcing the robbery
of a “large sum of money,” the Aust-
rians succeeded, by means of a secret
wireless, in communicating with Mon-
signor Gerlach, who left the papal court
unceremoniously. With the evidence in
hand, the Italian police were able to
round up several hundred of the most
dangerous German plotters, and to
strike into the heart of a Teutonic ele-
ment in the highest circles in Rome.
Among the accused are persons of all
grades of society. The defendents, it is
charged, are members of the vast or-
ganisation of spies directed by Prince
Bulow, from Lucerne.
On April 6, Vienna dispatches announ-
ced the robbery of a house, adjoining


the German embassy . A large sum of
money was said to have been obtained
by the robbers, who escaped.
* The same night a stir was caused in
Rome by Monsignor Gerlach, who was
said to have escaped across the
Swiss border. Italian secret service
agents burst in the doors of his house
two hours after his escape and found
the proof of a score of pro-German
plots. The next day more than 300 ar-
rests resulted in Italy, including edi-
tors persons connected with Parliament,
and anarchists. Gerlach had not been
found. He is probably safe in some con-
vent or monastry not far away, where
the foot of justice does not enter. The
trial was held in his absence. A cable
dated Rome, June 24, states: Monsig-
noi Gerlach formerly attache at the
Vatican, was yesterday found guilty ol
being head of pro-German propaganda
in the Papal Court and throughout high
circles in Italy, and \yas sentenced to
life imprisonment. Pomarice, an accom-
plice, was sentenced to be shot. Both
convicted men were fugitives from
Italy.
That the Papacy is pro-German is a
conclusion to which every impartial stu-
dent of the war has been forced by the
course pursued by the Pope and his
satellites in every part of the world.
Wherever the Jesuits are powerful, Ger-
man conspiracies have flourished. 1 his
is particularly noticed in those portions
of the British Empire where Papal in-
fluence is strongest. Roman Catholic
Ireland has had its rebellion, and Irench
Quebec is threatening one at the present
time. In Australia, leading ecclesiastics
have been outspoken in giving expres-
sion to their anti-British sentiment. The
Jesuit agents in Mexico did their best
to aid the cause of Germany, as the re-
velations made to the American Govern-
ment disclosed.
But perhaps the most convincing evi-
dence of the friendship of the Pope and
the Vatican for the cause of Germany
is to be found in the conspiracies of
Monsignor Gerlach, which were organi-
sed and carried on under the very walla
of the Vatican.
The Pope and his councillors are try-
ing to maintain an attitude of friend-
ship for Germany in the hope of realis-
ing their ambitions for the restoration
of the temporal power in the event of
a German victory ■ They are, at the
same time, doing their best to covei
their tracks, so that the Pope may
claim a place in the Peace Conference
in the event of an allied victory. With
all their astuteness they are unable to
steer a course that is likely to land
them at the desired destination when
the forces of Germany are defeated.
There is no doubt in the minds of the
men who are in charge of the Imperial
affairs as to the real attitude of the
Papacy and in the part that it is play-
ing in the overseas dominions. The Papacy
claims to represent Jesus Christ on
earth; it promulgates its decrees in His
name, it violates every principle pf His
teaching. The Pope professes to speak
for the Prince of Peace, and is found in
an alliance to enslave the world by the
most ruthless methods that the in-
genuity of men can conceive. Retri-
bution will surely come to a so-called
religious institution which is founded on
superstition and maintained with hy-
pocrisy.
