THE ARRAN'DA LANGUAGE, CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.




THE ARRAN'DA LANGUAGE, CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.
By R. H. MATHEWS, L.S.
(Read October 5, 1906.)
We encounter the southern limit of the Arranda language about
Oodnadatta, the present terminus of the trans-continental railway
from Adelaide towards Port Darwin. The language continues
northerly from Oodnadatta to Charlotte Waters and onward to Glen
Helen Cattle Station and Alice Springs, in the Macdonnell Ranges.
The distance from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is 347 miles along
the public mail-coach road, but as the Arranda language extends
some 50 miles farther north, we may say that the length of territory
occupied by the people speaking that language, or dialects of it, is
400 miles, by a width of say 200 miles at the widest part —the
greatest width being near the northern end in the Macdonnell
Ranges and sources of the Finke River.
In 1875, more than thirty years ago, Mr. Christopher Giles, who
was then station master at Charlotte Waters telegraph station,
reported that the tribes in that neighborhood spoke the Arrinda
(my Arranda) language and were divided into four sections, the
names of which he stated, together with their intermarrying rules. 1
From information obtained from W. H. Willshife and other men
who had resided many years in the district and were well acquainted
with the natives, I communicated an article to this Society in 1899
showing a correct table of their intermarrying laws. 2 In 1900 I
sent another article to this Society, with a map defining the southern
boundary of the Arranda speaking people. 3
In 1891, Rev. L. Schulze, a missionary at the aboriginal station
at Hermannsburg, on the Upper Finke River, reported his discovery
that the natives of that district were subdivided into eight sections.
Four of these eight have the same names as the four sections men-

tioned by Mr. C. Giles, already referred to, with four new section
names added, making eight divisions in all. 1 In 1899 I supplied a
complete table showing the rules of marriage and descent among the
eight sections of the Arranda. 2 The reader who wishes to study
their sociology is invited to peruse the works quoted.
On the present occasion I shall endeavor to give a short account
of the grammatical structure of the Arranda language. In 1890,
Rev. H. Kempe, another missionary at Hermannsburg, published a
grammar and vocabulary of this language, 3 and I propose to make
use of some selections from his work, in addition to fuller informa-
tion collected recently at my request by a capable friend and corre-
spondent who resides in that district. It may be mentioned here
that Mr. Kempe failed to observe the double form in the first person
of the dual and plural in the pronouns which is now reported by me
for the first time.
It may perhaps be as well to repeat that I was appointed by the
Government of South Australia, a Land Surveyor in 1883, and a
Justice of the Peace in 1884, both of which positions I still hold.
By means of these appointments I have had opportunities which
would not otherwise have occurred of carrying on my inquiries
respecting the customs of the Aborigines in that State.
GRAMMAR OF THE ARRANDA LANGUAGE.
Articles.
There are no words strictly corresponding to the English articles
a and the. The demonstrative adjectives, this and that, in their
various aboriginal forms, supply the place of the definite article.
Nouns.
Number. —There are three numbers —the singular, dual and plu-
ral. Atua, a man; atuantatera, a couple of men; atuantirbera,
several men. Another form of dual is: wora, a boy; worananga,
two boys. The latter form is used only for persons.

Soc. South Australia, XIV., 223-224.
2 Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc., XXXVIII., 76.
3 Trans. Roy. Soc. South Australia, XIV., pp. 1-54.


Gender. —There are two ways of indicating gender in nouns—
one of which consists of using different words for male and female,
and the other by adding some word indicative of sex.
Atua, a man. Aragutya, a woman. Wora, a boy. Kwara, a
girl. Katyia, a child of either sex. Among animals, words signi-
fying “ male ” and “ female ” respectively are employed, as : Aranga
kaluka, a buck kangaroo. Aranga mala, a doe kangaroo. Among
some animals there is a name for the male, quite independent of the
creature’s usual name.
Case. —The principal cases are the nominative, causative, genitive,
instrumental, dative and ablative.
Nominative. When the act remains with the subject, the noun
is not declined. For example, atua indama, the man sleeps. Katyia
lama, the child goes.
Causative. When a transitive verb is used, the noun takes a
suffix, la, as: Worala gama, the boy eats. Apmala utnuma, the
snake bites.
Genitive. This case is formed by adding ka to the nominative,
as: Kata, father. Kataka wora, father’s boy. The genitive case of
a large number of nouns is effected by an abbreviated suffix corre-
sponding to the person and number of the pronoun required, as:
Katanuka, my father. Katankwanga, thy father. Katakura, his
father; and so on through all the persons and numbers. See table
of Pronouns.
Instrumental. This takes lela, as, ilupa, an axe. Ilupalela, with
or by means of the axe.
The accusative is the same as the nominative, thus, Ta Kwatya
nyuma. I water drink (I drink water). In some expressions the
accusative takes the dative inflection, as: Atuala worana tukala, the
man to-the-boy beat, resembling our expression “ the man gave (to)
the boy a hiding.”
The dative terminates in na. Ta Katyiana ndama, I to-the-child
give.
Ablative. The case ends in nga. Era ulbarinya itityinga
erbuma, he a boomerang from—mulga makes. Yinga woranga
tarama, I laugh for (the sake of) the boy.


Adjectives.
Adjectives follow the nouns which they qualify and are subject
to the same declensions for number and case. Comparison is effected
by using words signifying, “ This is good—that is bad.”
Pronouns.
Pronouns take inflexion for number, person and case. There
are two forms in the first person of the dual and plural; one in
which the person or persons addressed are included with the speaker,
and another form in which the persons addressed are exclusive of
the speaker. In the following table the first of these forms is marked
“ inclusive ” and the second “ exclusive.” The “ inclusive ” form
of the pronouns in the Arranda language has never been published
by any other author. I was also the first to report the double “we ”
in the languages in the southeastern districts of South Australia A
There are two district forms of the first person in the singular
number, namely, ta and yinga. Ta is always used when connected
with a transitive verb, as, ta tuma, I beat; ta ilkuma, I eat. Yinga
is employed when connected with an intransitive verb, as, yinga
indam'a, I sleep. Yinga lama, I go. In the second person singular
there are also two forms of the pronuon —unta for use with transi-
tive verbs, and nga with intransitive verbs. The third personal
pronoun, era, is regularly declined in all the numbers.
The following is a full table of the nominative pronouns. “ Tran-
sitive ” and “ intransitive ” are respectively noted against the double
forms of the first and second pronouns in the singular, to show the
verbs with which they are employed. “ Inclusive ” and “ exclusive ”
are marked against the double forms of the dual and plural.

The possessive pronouns are as under:
Singular Mine nukara { -kwangara } His ekurara
Dual { SuS «ci: ilmakara fa } Yours mbalakar a Theirs ekuraratera
Plural { Ous ‘excl. anunakar k a ara } Yours aragankara Theirs etnikara
These pronouns are generally used in the nominative case. For
example, the question may be asked, “ Whose spear is this ?” and
some one could answer, “ Nukara (mine).” If used in a sentence,
the dual and plural forms sometimes have a reflexive or reciprocal
meaning, as the verb may determine. There are other forms of the
pronouns, meaning “ for me,” “ with me,” “ to me.”
There is also a suffix, arpa, by annexing which to the personal
pronouns gives them an emphatic meaning, thus:
Ta arpa, contracted to tarpa
Unta arpa contracted to untarpa
Era arpa, contracted to erarpa
Myself
Thyself
Himself
Another emphatic form is obtained by the suffix atara in the
singular, which is altered to watara in the dual and plural. I (in
place of anyone else) ta-atara; we, dual, ngilinawatara; we, plural,
nganunawatara. '
In regard to the double “ we ” in the dual, there are some varia-
tions, according to the relationship existing between the speaker
and the person referred to. If a father speaks to his son he says
Ngilaka instead of Ngilina, thus: “ Ngilika araka larityika, we
(dual) kangaroo-for must go. Emphatic forms are, Ngilanta,
we (dual) only. Ngunanta or ngunantara, we (plural) only.
Demonstratives. This, rana. These (dual) nanatera. These
(plural) nanirbera. This (is mine) nananuka or nanuka. That,
tana; those (dl.), tanatera; those (pi.), tanirbera. Other shades
of meaning are given by using nakuna and arina for “ that.” This,
lena.
Interrogatives. Who, nguna? Who (did it), ngula? What,


iwuna? In the declension of nguna, the forms of the genitive,
dative and ablative are inserted between the root and the termina-
tion of the word:
Genitive.
Dative.
Ablative.
Ngu-fea-tera,
Ngu-aw-atera,
Ngu-wgo-tera,
of which (dual) ?
to which (dual) ?
from which (dual) ?
In the plural we would say, ngu-£a-irbera, or contracted to
ngukirbera, of which? And so on.
Nguna unta nama, or ngununta nama, who thou art? Ngula
nana nilknalinaka, who this stolen has?
Ntakina, how (in what way) ? Ntakinya, how (many) ? Ntak-
ata, how (large) ?
Indefinite pronouns. These are regularly declined. Arbuna,
another. Arbunatera, others (dual). Arbunirbera, others (plural).
Nintamininta, one by one or, each one.
There are no relative pronouns in the Arranda tongue and in
this respect it resembles all other Australian languages with which
I am acquainted.
Verbs.
The termination of the verb differs in each tense. For example,
in the Indicative mood, the word tuma means, beats now; tukala,
means, did beat; tutyina, shall beat. Any required number and
person in any tense can be shown by using the proper pronoun. In
other words, each tense form remains constant through all its num-
bers and persons. There are, however, modifications of the termi-
nations of the verb in all the moods and tenses to express different
shades of meaning, of which I shall give a few examples later on.
Verbs have the usual numbers, singular, dual and plural, each
of which can be distinguished by the termination, if connected with
a pronoun. When the proper pronoun is used, the dual or plural
form of the verb may be omitted. There are three principal moods,
the indicative, imperative and conditional. The form of the in-
dicative has already been stated. The imperative is formed by add-
ing ai to the stem, as, tu-ai, beat! The conditional mood is formed
by the addition of tnara to the stem, as, tu-mara, should beat. All
the moods have a negative as well as a positive form, by infixing
or adding itya or gunia to the positive.


Auxiliary Verbs. —The intransitive verb, nama, to sit, and having
also the sense of our auxiliary, “ to be,” is employed as a suffix or
augmentation in conjugating transitive verbs. The intransitive
verb, lama, “to go,” is similarly used. Sometimes the whole —
sometimes only a part —of these auxiliaries are used as additions to
active verbs.
In order to enable the reader to more easily understand the
terminations or addenda to the transitive verbs, a short outline of
the auxiliary, nama, will now be submitted. The present tense is
given in full, but in the remaining tenses and moods the first per-
son only of each number is taken.

Negative: Singular, tutyinagunia. Dual, tula narityinagunia.
Plural, tula narirityinagunia.
Middle Voice —Reflexive Form.
The middle voice, in its reflexive form, describes an action which
the subject executes directly upon himself. The sign of the reflexive
is inserted in the middle of the verb, consisting of the particle -la or
-li, according to the vowel in the adjacent syllable. For example, ta
nukara tulama, I beat myself; to nukara tulaka, I have beaten my-
self; ta nukara tulityina, I shall beat myself. Ta is generally
omitted, because nukara conveys the meaning of the first personal
pronoun.
Indicative Mood —Present Tense.

The negative is expressed by adding -gunia or -itya.
Reciprocal Form.
This form of the middle voice is a modification of the verb which
applies itself to a case where two or more persons reciprocally beat
each other, and is consequently limited to the dual and plural num-
bers. It is known by the termination rama for the dual and rirama
for the plural. Example, ilina turama, we (dual) beat each other;
anuna turirama, we (plural) beat each other. A few examples in
the third person of the plural will be sufficient to show how the verb
is declined in the different moods and tenses.
Indicative Mood— Present Tense.
They, pi., beat each other, Etnikara turirama.
They, pi., beat not each other, Etnikara turirityikana.
Past Tense.
They, pi., have beaten each other, Etnikara turirakala.
The negative form of the word is turirityimakana.
Future Tense.
They, pi., shall beat each other, Etnikara turirityina.
The negative consists of adding gitnia.
Imperative Mood.
Beat each other, aragankara turirai!
They, pi., must beat each other, etnikara turirityika.
Conditional Mood— Present Tense.
They, pi., should beat each other, Etnikara turiramara.
Future Tense. (Past is wanting.)
They, pi., should beat each other, Etnikara turirityinala.
Participles— Present.
They, pi., are beating each other, Etnikara turiramanga.


Negative, turirityikananga.
Past Tense.
They, pi., were beating each other, Etnikara turiramala
Negative, turiramalikana.
Future Tense.
They, pi., should beat each other, Etnikara turirityinanga.
The negative is expressed by gunia or itya,
There are modifications of the verbal suffixes of the past tense
to indicate the immediate past, the recent past, and the remote past.
Similar modifications exist for the proximate, or more or less distant
future. There are likewise forms of the verb to express repetition
or continuance of the act described, and many other complexities,
which must be only briefly referred to in the present article. In
these respects the Arranda resembles the Kamilaroi, Wiradyuri,
Thurrawal and other Australian tongues, the grammars of which
have been published by me. 1
Tutyigunala, to beat by and by.
Tutyilbitnima, to come to beat.
Tutyalbuma, returned to beat.
Tutyikamanityikana, to beat not again.
Tualbuntama, to beat running away.
Tuatalalbuma, to beat on the way home.
Tulinya tulindama, to beat always.
Tulatulauma, to beat seldom. <
Tuatna lama, to beat on arrival at another place.
Adverbs.
Derived adverbs, corresponding with English adverbs ending in
ly, are formed by adding the particle la to adjectives, as, Era ekaltala
erguma, he "firmly holds.
'Adverbs of time: Now, lata. Soon, lilika. Yesterday, tmurka.
Day before yesterday, tmurkarbuna. To-morrow, ingunta. Long

Prepositions.
There are two sorts of prepositions, one class comprising separate
words, and the other consisting only of small particles annexed to
the nouns—both being placed at the end of the word to which they
belong. The separate words are as follows:
In front, ulara. Behind, topala. Outside, gatala. Between,
mbobula. Other side, ntuara. This side, nunkara. Beside, nkelala.
Close by, itinyawara. Through, ntuarintyirka. Upon, katningala.
Over, katningalagana. Down, kwanakala. Inside, kwanala.
The prepositions annexed to nouns as suffixes are: Upon, into,
una. Example, kwatya-una, abridged to kwatyuna, into the water.
Bira-una (biruna), upon the tree. By or with, lela. E. g., atualela,
by the man. At, la, ,as Tyoritya-la, at Alice Springs. With or
along with, gata. Without, raba. For, or in exchange, gityala.
For (the sake of), kaguia. On (as, on a nail), kieka. From, out
of, ibena or ibera.
Conjunctions.
This languages possesses very few conjunctions, most of them
being combined with the verb. There is not even a proper word for
the copula, and the following are the only examples found: Too,
also, tuta or urungara. Yet (nevertheless), etalinya. But, bula.
Only, wara. The suffix, -nta, also means only. As, than, ngetyina.
Then, gurunga.
Interjections.
Hear! aai! lam sorry! apu! Behold! erai! Woe! tyikabai.
Indeed, verily, nturbai! Calling attention, tyikai!


Numerals.
Ninta, one. Tara, two. Several, urbutya.
