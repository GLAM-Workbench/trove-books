Interesting Notes on West Australia
LAND-THE SAFEST INVESTMENT.
John Jacob Astor was a shrewd speculator in land and calculator of the
unearned increment. We are told that when he first trod the streets of New
York in 1784, the city, situated at the extremity of the island, was a snug,
leafy place of 26,000 inhabitants. By 1800, when he began to have money to
invest, the city had more than doubled its population, and had advanced
nearly a mile up the island. The hint was not lost upon Astor, and he
immediately set "to work buying up land and allotments just beyond the
boundary of the city. There is a story told of him which illustrates his method
capitally. In 1810 he sold an allotment near Wall-street for 8.000 dol., and
the purchaser seemed disposed to chuckle over the bargain. “ Mr. Astor,"
he exclaimed, “in a few years this lot will be worth 12,000 dol. ! ” “ Very
true,” replied the future founder of a dynasty of millionaires ; “ but, now, see
what lam going to do with this money. With 8,000 dol. I buy eighty lots
above Canal-street. By the time your lot is worth 12,000 dol. my eighty
lots will be worth 80,000 dol. ] ” And this, we are told, proved to be a fact.
He bought the Richmond Hill Estate of Aaron Burr, 160 acres, at 1,000
dol. an acre, and in 12 years the value had increased by 50 per cent. It
should be remembered that these and similar operations were carried on
within the limited area of Manhattan Island, of which there is not an avail-
able square foot remaining unutilised by the overgrown city; and the single
taxers have drawn many a clenching argument from the circumstance that
the man who thus made his fortune out of the natural expansion of the chief
city of the State, without any exertion of his own, was able to lend that State
its own money, so acquired at 80, during the war of 1812, and realise on it,
if he wished at 120, a year after the peace. “In course of time,” we read in
this sketch, “ the whole island on which New York was built is dotted all
over with Astor lands, to such an extent that the whole income of the estate,
for fifty years, would be invested in new houses without buying any more
land.” One of his greatest achievements, however, was his coup in connec-
tion with the Morris Estate. The original owners forfeited through their
adherence to George 111. in the revolutionary war, and the State sold the
land in small portions to farmers, giving a title. In 1809, 700 families
occupied the 51,102 acres of which the State was comprised. Someone
discovered, however, that the original owners only held a life interest in the
property, and on their death the land and all improvements thereon reverted
to their heirs. Astor bought these rights for £20,000, and in 1815, at the
close of the war of 1812, proceeded to claim possession. The land was
valued at 667,000 dol., and Astor offered to accept half. The matter was
not settled until 1827, though negotiations were revived in 1819, when the
speculator claimed interest on his previous offer, alleging the venerable plea
that “ he had lain so long out of his money, which, if employed in commercial
operations, would more likely have produced better profits.” When the
matter went before the Courts, it was decided that the State had no power to
confiscate more than the life-interest held by the attainted Morrises, although


the great Daniel Webster and Martin Van Buren argued the case on its side.
Astor received about half a million dollars in “ Astor Stock ” as his share of
this little exploit, and the State was mulct in that amount to secure rightful
titles to the existing holders.
To the thinking reader, who is able to apply what he reads to the condi-
tions around him, the story of the life of this great millionaire is very
instructive; it is full of lessons of success. His great fortune was
practically made out of land. Jacob Astor did not miss the golden oppor-
tunity, he foresaw the great future of New York ; he took the tide of his
affairs at the flood, and it led on to fortune.
Similar opportunities have occurred in every Australian Capital City ;
first in Sydney, then in Melbourne, and later on in Adelaide, Brisbane, etc.
The fortunes of most of our wealthy men originated through land purchased
whilst these cities were gradually growing into importance.
However, it is not so much to the past, as to the present, we wish to
draw attention.
As we all know, there is one Australian Colony which (though possessed
of a grand climate, unbounded mineral wealth of a varied character, millions
of acres of magnificent pastoral and agricultural lands) has barely passed out
of its infancy. We refer, of course, to West Australia, once known as the
Cinderella of Australia, but now acknowledged as the coming Colony. Even
as keen, prudent men in the past made fortunes out of land in rising cities,
so there exists to-day (for every person who wishes to avail himself or herself
of the opportunity by purchasing now good building land in and close to
Perth, the capital city, and Albany, West Australia), the certainty of a very
large profit on every pound invested. The price of land in Perth and Albany
is at present comparatively so low that it cannot decrease in value ; but, on
the other hand, every new settler, every pound of outside capital introduced in
the colony, every pound expended by Government and the people in opening
up the country, improving and cultivating it, in constructing railways and
other public works, every acre of land put into use, and every ounce of gold
won from the earth, gives an added value to land in the principal cities. The
“ unearned increment ” silently, but swiftly, mounts up.
Make inquiries into the resources of West Australia, into the progress
of the colony generally, and its principal cities in particular, into the prospects
(mineral, agricultural, and pastoral) of the colony, and you will be more than
satisfied to put a few pounds into Perth or Albany land. A few pounds thus
spent will turn you in hundreds, and be a grand “ nest egg ” for your
children.

MELBOURNE.
In 1837, the choicest sites of this city, between Flinders, Collins, Bourke,
William, King, and Elizabeth Streets, were sold, realising on an average
£35 each half-acre block.
Two years later the corner of Flinders an 1 King Streets was re-sold at a
profit of £1,591, and the corner of Collins and William Streets at profit
of £2,535, and it is now worth, probably, over £7OO per foot. And we
could quote similarly large increases in value, not only in other Capital
Cities, but in the suburbs surrounding every Australian Capital. Will
not like increases in value take place in property at Perth, the capital
city of West Australia ?


THE ADVANCEMENT OF PERTH.
A Year’s Buildings.
LARGE INCREASES IN CITY AND SUBURBS,
Statistics were recently published in the West Australian with regard to
the building trade in Perth during the past year. It was shown that there
had been unusual activity in connection with this industry, no less than
1,245 new tenements, representing an estimated aggregate value of £600,000,
being registered. This strikes the casual observer as being a very large sum
to have been spent in bricks and mortar ; but, on closer inquiry, and by
comparison with the state of affairs existing in other cities, it becomes an
even more important fact as evidencing the great advancement in recent
years of the capital of West Australia. The South Australian Advertiser
estimates that a sum closely approximating to a quarter of a million was
expended during 1897 “in Adelaide, Unley, Norwood, Kensington, and
Thebarton alone.” It further states that, “if to this amount be added the
money spent in Hindmarsh, St. Peter’s, Port Adelaide, Glenelg, Semaphore,
and other environments of the capital, it may safely be stated that the total
would reach at least £325,000, independent of the £24,000 devoted to the
Government buildings either erected during the year, or for which tenders
have been called.” Here, then, we have a basis on which to test our material
progress ; and the comparison is very favourable to the city on the banks of
the Swan, which, numbering only some 2,500 buildings in 1895, has more
than doubled itself in size in a little over two years. Our Adelaide con-
temporary considers that it speaks well for the building trade there, that
£325,000 should have been invested during the year in new properties in the
city, suburbs, and adjacent watering-places, embracing even Port Adelaide,
which stands in the same relation to Adelaide that Fremantle does to Perth.
On our side it is estimated by the building surveyor of the city that in Perth
alone £600,000 was expended in buildings last year. If we add to this the
value of the properties which have sprung up during the term in Victoria
Park, South Perth, Subiaco, Leedervibe, Bayswater, the stations intervening
between Subiaco and Fremantle, and Fremantle itself, we would have a sum
in excess of a million of money, or more than three times that which was
spent in the capital of South Australia and its environments.
The people of West Australia are, therefore, justified in viewing with
pride the advancement which Perth is making. To the charming situation
of the city are being added majestic edifices, imposing public buildings, and
innumerable residences of a character which will compare favourably with any
to be found elsewhere in the Australian group. The laudable aim of the
Government has been to permanently attract those visitors from the other
colonies who have come over to “spy out the land,” and it would appear that
that object is being realised, if we may judge by the commodious and
beautiful residences that are being established in all directions. A sweeping
change has come over the appearance of the business portion of the city. The
low single-storey buildings which formerly disfigured the chief thoroughfares
are giving place to stately piles of brickwork and masonry, and even what
were considered substantial buildings in the old era are now being pulled
down to make way for structures three and four storeys in height.
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


The speedy erection of numerous terraces of houses, cottages, and
residences of a more spacious character has been especially gratifying to the
great bulk of the population, as it has brought down the rents (hitherto so
excessive) to a more equitable level
From time to time a detailed description has been given in the West
Australian of the more important additions to the city properties.
The suburb which has grown most rapidly during the year is Subiaco.
Here the population has increased from 1,051 in August, 1896, to 3,406 in
December last. The residences are of a useful rather than ornamental type,
suitable to the requirements of a working population. Mr, W. North, the
Town Clerk, states that there are now 720 houses in the municipality, and at
least 30 in course of erection. In April last year there were only 500
houses, including 30 in progress. It is difficult to estimate the value of the
buildings. The municipal valuation made in May, 1897, gave the capital
value of the ratable property at £17,611, and a supplementary valuation in
November following made it £37,112, It does not by any means follow,
however, that this represents an increase of £20,000 in the value of the
buildings. Mr. North states that in the latter valuation a lot of unimproved
land was taken in. The most imposing building in Subiaco is Subiaco
Hotel, which, with its turret-shaped tower, forms a landmark in the suburb.
Other prominent structures are the Government Industrial School, the Public
School, Post-office, the Church of England, Wesleyan and Presbyterian
Churches.
The Leederville Municipality has also advanced by leaps and bounds,
300 buildings being erected during the year. Mr. Johnson, the Town Clerk,
states that the increase in capital value of the property is £45,233. The
chief buildings erected in 1897 were the Municipal Chambers (£400), Post
and Telegraph Office (£2,000), and Golden Age Hotel (£3,000). The
Leederville Hotel was improved to the extent of £2,000, and the extensions
to the Government School cost £l,OOO. St. Kevin’s Glendalough, the
institution recently opened by the Oblate Fathers, also comes within the
municipality.
South Perth is perhaps the most fashionable suburb close to Perth. It
is very extensive, reaching from the Causeway to Mill Point ; Mr. E. C.
Shenton is the chairman of the roads board, the local governing body, and
he has set an example to other residents by erecting a beautiful residence
containing 20 rqoms. South Perth has gained much in favour since the steam
ferry boat service became regular, rapid, and frequent, and no doubt many
professional and business men in the city will be attracted in the near future
to build homes in a spot so favourably endowed by nature. Amongst the
chief residences are those of Mr. Justice Stone, Mr. R. S. Haynes, Mr. S. H.
Parker, and Mr. Ewing, M.L.A. Figures concerning the capital value of
the property are not available, but it is considerable.
Victoria Park was declared a Municipality in June last. The population
was then only 600, but it has doubled itself since. Byrne’s Victoria Park
Hotel, on the Albany road, cost £1,500, and there is another hotel being
built for Mr. A. G. Russell at a cost of £6,000. At present there is an
absence of Government buildings, although private residences are going up
rapidly, over 100 being constructed during the year. The value of the
buildings is roughly estimated at between £20,000 and £30,000. A railway
siding having been granted to the Park, its progress should be materially
•enhanced.— West Australian , January 25th, 1898.

Expanding Trade.
Since the boom in 1896, it has been the fashion rather to run down
West Australia, and to regard her as the Cinderella of the colonies.
This tendency has been encouraged by the failures of certain mining
enterprises which never should have been floated at the prices. Nor
have matters been much improved by the eloquence of anti-federal orators,
who have made it their business to belittle the western colony. But, if
West Australia is the Cinderella, it is in gold-dust that she is waiting for
her complete emancipation. For full evidence of this we need only refer to
the report for 1897 lately issued by Mr. C. T. Mason, the Collector of
Customs at Fremantle. This shows a strong advance in almost every
particular of trade. Imports of merchandise stood at £6,350,515 in 1897,
as against £5,512,468 in 1896. The decrease in the total sum of all
imports—from £6,493,557- in 1896 to £6,418,565 —is satisfactorily
explained by the decrease—-from £980,639 to £65,850 —in the value of coin
imported by the banks. General merchandise showed al5 per cent, increase.
The exports rose from £1,650,226 in 1896 to £3,940,098 in 1897 ; mainly,
of course, gold, which reached the value of £2,564,976 —or an increase over
1896 of no less a sum than £1,496,168. If we compare this with the gold
exports in 1887, £18,517, we shall have some idea of the extraordinary
growth of West Australia as a gold-producing country. The Collector of
Customs regards the figures as very satisfactory, and adds, “ When it is
mentioned that these exports are now the produce of fifteen goldfields, several
of which have been gazetted by Government during the past two years, it
will be seen that largely increased returns may be expected as the develop-
ments now in progress manifest themselves.” The other important article of
export is timber, and this amounted to £782,077 in 1897, as against
£116,420 in 1896, and £33,888 in 1893. The customs revenue from imports
has advanced from £621,805 in 1895 and £996,804 in 189*6 to £1,076,330
in 1897. These figures may appear small enough to financiers accustomed
to deal with millions, but they represent a large and growing amount for a
a small and growing population. In process of time much that now has to
be imported into West Australia will be grown in the colony. Just at
present, however, the population is more profitably employed in gold-mining
or timber-cutting than in agriculture. The return shows a sensible advance
in prosperity, and it might suggest to New South Wales the advisableness of
devoting still more attention to so rich and important a field of trade and
commerce. —Sydney Morning Herald, 20th June, 1898.
Opening of Parliament.
THE GOVERNOR’S SPEECH.
Perth, 4th July, 1898.
Political. —The last session of the third Parliament since the advent
of constitutional government in West Australia, was opened on 16th June
with the usual ceremony. The Governor’s speech was a lengthy one. The
Royal Mint, it was stated, would be opened on the 13th inst. The Coolgardie

water scheme was being carried on, and would soon be fully in hand. The
Fremantle harbour works were progressing satisfactorily, A channel 25 feet
deep and 200 feet wide had been dredged, and as the berthage space at
present available on the South Quay (4500 feet) was already constantly
occupied, additional wharves had been erected on the north and south moles.
It is anticipated that in about twelve months the works will have sufficiently
advanced to accommodate the P. & 0. and Orient mail steamers within the
River Harbour. The breakwater at Bunbury had been extended for upwards
of 3000 feet, and had been found to be a great protection to shipping at the
jetty. Respecting the export trade His Excellency informed the House of
the following interesting facts : —That the export of timber in 1897 showed
an increase of 65 per cent, on that of the previous year; that respecting gold
this colony now occupied the proud position of being the largest gold
producer in Australasia, the export for the first five months of the year
having been 389,944 ozs., with a prospect that the year’s exports would reach
1,000,000 ozs.; that agricultural settlement was proceeding satisfactorily,
650,000 acres having been selected under compulsory conditions of improve-
ment during the last eighteen months, and last year showed an increased
acreage under cultivation of 51,000 acres ; that the erection of smelting works
near Fremantle will soon render the colony independent of the eastern
smelters in the treatment of the rich refractory ores which the colony yields ;
that parliamentary sanction will be sought for an extension of the present
water supply of Perth and the inauguration of the much-needed system of
deep drainage for the city.
Statistics. —lt is satisfactory to find that the statistics for the year
ended 30th June show a substantial increase to the population of the colony
of 9097 souls, the aggregate population being 116,023 males and 54,998
females ; total, 171,021.
Good Production. —The monthly returns of the output of gold are
looked for with the keenest interest, and now that the “ Cinderella ” of
Australia is in the proud position of being the largest gold producer in
Australasia, a little laudation of the expanding resources of the colony is
allowable. The export of gold during the month of June was 80,749 ozs.,
valued at £306,846, or a total export during the first six months of 1898 of
470,690 ozs. It is confidently prophesied that before the close of the year
the total will have reached one million ounces.
Considerable sensation has been caused by the alleged discovery of
alluvial close to the town of Coolgardie.
Simultaneously with this alleged discovery comes the report of a deep
lead near Kalgoorlie. —lnsurance and Banking Record , July 19th, 1898.
Extract from Sir John Forrest’s Budget Speech,
August 18, 1898 :
The Trade of the Colony.
I now come to some facts connected with the position of the colony,
which I consider interesting and satisfactory—these relate to trade. The
trade of West Australia for 1897 amounted to £10,358,663. Our im-
ports for many years far outstripped our exports. I consider that due' to
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


the large introduction of foreign capital. That is the chief reason why our
imports have so largely exceeded our exports during previous years. It is,
however, a condition of things that is rapidly changing.
The imports for 1895 were £3,774,951. In 1896 this total was raised
to £6,493,557. In 1897 it amounted to £6,418,565. I will show our
exports directly, but I will say now, that I shall not be surprised if our
exports soon equal our imports, especially if the gold yield increases as we
anticipate. During 1897 we imported from the Australian Colonies
£3,277,300, of which £2,562,694 was local produce. If this is not the
record of a good customer of the other colonies I don’t know what is.
The Exports.
The exports for 1897 are one of the most satisfactory features of our
present position. It is really a wonderful increase. The exports for 1896
were £1,650,226, whereas for 1897 they were £3,940,098, an increase over
the previous year of £2,289,872, an increase of 140 per cent, over the
previous year. I think that is a splendid record, one that we should all be
proud of. The principal export was gold, to the value of £2,564,977, this
having increased by £1,496,169 on that of the previous year. For 1896 the
exports of wool were £267,506, and for 1897 £295,646, showing an increase
of £28,140 —a small increase, but still in the right direction, and satisfactory.
I think this Legislature should encourage the three great products of this
Colony—gold, wool, and timber. The last-named is a splendid industry and
a splendid product, and deserves every encouragement. While we get some
revenue out of it, we must not hamper those who are willing to put their
money into it. We must guard our own interests, but at the same time we
must be liberal to those who come here to invest their capital, and, in fact, by
their agency to help in transforming this wilderness of trees into homes for
the people. I hope, Sir, that we will be able soon to add to these two great
products of gold and timber the production of coal, lam as certain as lam
of anything that we have in chat Collie coal a magnificent fuel. The day is
not far distant when it will be used in Perth and Fremantle for domestic fuel
exclusively. I use it in my own house, and it gives a splendid heat. It does
not require refreshing with wood. It is a magnificent fuel for domestic
purposes.
The timber industry is fast becoming a large export, and is attracting
much attention in England and elsewhere. In fact, it is generally
stated that there are no better hardwoods in the world than those of
West Australia. There is no better timber than our jarrah, of the quali-
ties of which we have had half a century’s experience. The export of timber
for 1897 was valued at £192,451, while for 1896 it was £116,420, so that in
the one year it increased by £76,031.
I regret that I cannot give the details of the imports and exports for the
half-year ending June 30th. I have, however, the totals. The exports
during that period were £2,151,925. I have not the particular items of the
imports, hut for the first five months of the half-year they were valued at
£2,258,067. It seems, therefore, that our imports slightly decreased, and
our exports largely increased. One is bound to confess that we are fast
getting into a self-supporting condition.
Land Settlement.
During the financial year ending 30th June 2,004 blocks were taken up
under conditional purchase, comprising 334,745 acres. There have been
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


during the same period 462 free farms selected, with an area of 70,012 acres.
During the same period there were granted 65 homestead leases, containing
97,301 acres, and 257 pastoral leases, comprising 6,452,647 acres. On the
30th June, 1898, there were held 7,056 conditional purchase licenses, equal
to 2,832,964 acres ; 2,689 pastoral leases, equal to 90,461,580 acres ; 191
timber leases, equal to 1,052,426 acres : 191 miscellaneous, equal to 67,595
acres. There was a good increase on all these items over those for the
previous year, showing that the settlement of the soil was going on rapidly.
I think that we are within measurable distance of being self-supporting.
The area of land under crop for 1897 was 270,525 acres, as against
163,288 acres for the previous year, showing that there is an increase in
favour of this year of 107,267 acres of land under crop.
Live Stock.
In regard to stock, there are increases shown of 4,695 horses, 45,178
cattle, and 38,234 sheep over the figures for the previous year. On 31st
December, 1897, there were in the Colony 62,222 horses, 244,971 cattle,
2,210,742 sheep, and 31,809 pigs. lam very glad to say there are pros-
pects of a very large increase of stock all over the colony, that is if the good
season we are now blessed with continues.
Railway Revenue.
The estimated revenue from the railways to 30th June last was
£1,200,000. The actual revenue raised was £1,032,178. The expenditure
was estimated at £866,396, but the actual expenditure was £852,647. For
the present year it is expected that the railways will earn £187,823 more
than last year, and that the expenditure will be £12,077 less than last year ;
and it is expected that the profit will be £379,429. The estimated interest
of the whole of the public debt is £348,000, and £53,000 for sinking fund.
Gold Export.
I now come to the gold export. Up to June 30 last the Colony had
exported £8,035,593 worth of gold, of which £4,853,613 worth had been
exported during the last 18 months, or actually more than the total export
prior to the commencement of the year 1897. We have exported since the
year 1897 considerably more than all the gold we produced before that. I
would like to ask hon. members if it is not a record to be proud of ? When
we know this record to be true, what is there to be afraid of ? Those who do
not know what our resources are must be taught them, and that not only are
we a self-reliant and progressive people, but that we have good reason to be
so. For the six months up to the 30th of June last we exported
£1,788,636, as against £1,008,254, showing an increase of £780,382, or
nearly 80 per cent., in six months. Our export for the twelve months ended
the 30th of June last was valued at £3,345,359, as against £1,650,210 for
the previous 12 months, or an increase of 103 per cent. On the 30th June
last West Australia was the greatest gold-producing Colony in Australia.
Queensland produced 427,348 oz. ; Victoria, 398,177 oz. ; New Zealand,
127,263 oz. ; and Western Australia, 470,694 oz. I was pleased to
read in a newspaper the other morning a dividend list from a reliable authority
showing the dividends paid in 1897 and in six months of 1898 from the gold
mines. In 1897 £480,084 were paid in dividends, and during the six
months ended June 30th last £435,516 were paid. It was expected the
dividends for the whole of 1898 would reach £BOO,OOO.

(By odr Minino Representative.),
West Australian Branch Office.
Kalgoorlie, July 5.
The particulars of the gold export for June have been issued by the
Customs Department, complete for the first half-year of 1898. The immense
strides made in the gold production of West Australia since it first figured
as a gold-producer are marked in the extreme.
The progressive output for the colony is graphically shown in the follow-
ing table :
1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.
August ... 23,668 29,517 65,129

December ... 17,890 29,653 72,411
Totals
231,510
281,263 674,986 470,691
It will be seen from the above that should no increase be made during the
ensuing half-year, the total output for the twelve months will exceed 940,000
oz. There is, however, little doubt that the magical seven figures will be
found in their places when a review of the yield for 1898 is written. It is
remarkable that during the last six years the increase of the second half of
the year over the first has in most cases been more than 70 per cent., and,
thanks to the Bayley’s find, in 1893 the increase was over 200 per cent.
The advance made since 1893 is amply evidenced by the following table,
which shows the quantity of gold exported from the colony during the
January-June half-year from that year until the present :

1898 ... 470,691 ... 78,448
The year 1897 left the preceding year 153,0000 z. behind, to be in turn
eclipsed by the first half of the present year by 205,0000 z. The half-year
just closed stands well with its average of nearly 80,000 oz. per month. The

themselves speak volumes.

Yet this colony is in its infancy as a gold-producer. It is only during
the last few months that plants of any magnitude have been erected ; and
large though those plants are, they will be small in comparison with the works
which are to be installed during the next year. This Kalgoorlie field alone,
instead of producing 30,0000 z. per month, will have single mines which them-
selves will be yielding such a total. Many looked on Sir John Forrest’s
utterance, when he foreshadowed in England a year ago that the colony’s out-
put for 1898 would be over a million ounces of gold, as a piece of gilded
optimism ; but in view of the fact that the first half of the year has alone
been responsible for nearly half that amount, perhaps those who discredit the
colony’s large auriferous resources, will see the necessity of changing their
opinions. From what can every day be seen in a few of the chosen mines of
the Kalgoorlie field, there is no reason why the output for the last year of the
century, 1899, should not be well over .2,000,000. — West Australian, Bth
July, 1898.
An Assured Outlook,
From the steady progress being made in opening up the mines on the
various goldfields, as well as from the rapid and continuous increase of the
output, it may be seen that the resources of the colony at present best known
to the outside world are now undergoing legitimate development. The
period of sensational “ finds,” rash promotion, reckless speculation, and con-
sequent undue inflation, which is always an initial phase in connection with
the first discovery of goid, especially in a new country, has now passed away.
Its deleterious after-effects are rapidly disappearing, and mining operations
on the gold-bearing areas of West Australia are now being prosecuted, with
the honest intention of giving the best possible return to investors. This
3hange is most reassuring as regards the future of the industry, and its
general recognition is calculated to renew and increase the inflow of capital
for legitimate investment in West Australian mines.

The Australian output of gold for this year promises to exceed by at
least half a million ounces the yield for the previous year. New South
Wales mines have yielded 181,8210 z. for the first seven months, the average
per month being 25,9740 z., or 16230 z. per month more than in 1897. As
gauged by the Mint receipts the Victorian yield for the seven months is
458,7610 z., an increase of 51,3860 z. ; the Queensland yield 500,9690 z., an
increase of 79,8920 z. ; and the West Australian exports 547,6710 z., an
increase of 233,5360 z., making a total increase of 364,8140 z. from the three
colonies. WEST AUSTRALIA IS NOW THE CHIEF GOLD-
PRODUCING COLONY, AND PROMISES TO HAVE NOT FAR
FROM ONE MILLION OUNCES THIS YEAR ; and Queensland
and Victoria are likely to be a good second and third.— S.M. Herald, Bth

West Australia.
There can be no longer any question that with its vast auriferous
resources Westralia would rapidly become one of the most prosperous of the
world’s goldfields if only it were afforded greater facilities for the working of
the precious metal. The construction of railways has done much in this
direction, and the difficulties arising out of the absence of water have been
overcome by the partial success of roasting and dry crushing cyaniding.
What has been accomplished so far shows that a great deal may yet be done
to improve the methods of treating the ore, and it appears now that we have
entered upon a period when rapid progress will be made in the successful and
economical extraction of the precious metal. Investors have even now some
choice among dividend-paying concerns in Westralia. If they confine their
attentions to those companies that are seriously adopting improvements, and
are showing by their increased production that success is attending their
efforts, this extremely rich goldfield will very soon meet with support among
the investing public,— Australian Star, 30th July, 1898.
A West Australian Nugget.
It is reported from Kalgoorlie that a nugget of gold weighing 1151 b.
avoirdupois, and valued at £6,500, was discovered on July 17th at Lake
Wynne, three miles north-east of Kanowna. The nugget in shape resembles
a sickle, with a flat handle, is 15in. long and sin. wide. It has been

christened the “ Sacred Nugget.” Doubts have been expressed as to the
reported find being genuine, but the existence of the nugget has been
vouched for by a Roman Catholic priest, who saw it.— T. and C., 30th July,
1898.
Gold at Albany-
For a great many years it has been known that alluvial and reef gold
was to be found in the neighbourhood of Albany, and not a few attempts
have been made to turn these deposits to profitable account. The Stirling
Ranges are known to have alluvial deposits as well as reefs. Some years ago
a party of miners brought back some coarse alluvial gold, but not in the
sufficient quantities to encourage continuous expenditure. A glance at the
geological sketch map of the colony will show that on the west coast, and
again from the Leeuwin to Albany, granite country is prevalent, with recent
and tertiary formations. The famous goldfields of the colony are in gneisic
granite country, with metamorphic patches extending from Dundas to Cue.
It is important to notice that in the immediate neighbourhood of Albany there
is a patch of this gneisic granite. The problem to be solved, therefore, is
whether auriferous metamorphic country is also present. Recent discoveries
point to a favourable reply. Eastern goldfields experience leads to the belief
that granite areas are not promising localities for finding gold-bearing reefs,
but a great many theories formulated elsewhere are upset by fractional pick
exploration in Western Australia. Bearing these facts in mind, there is
nothing incredible In the supposition that Albany will become a gold-pro-
ducing district.— S.M. Herald.
Gold at Denmark,—Near Albany.
With reference to the reported find of gold at Denmark, Mr. Doyle, the
postmaster at Denmark, went to the claim the other morning with Mr. Allen,
the holder. The prospect obtained from the dish has been shown in Albany.
It contains several coarse pieces of splendid gold, slightly water-worn. There
were nearly twenty of the specks, and one piece was large.
The formation is about 80 feet wide and outcrops for 130 yards. It
contains quartz, some of a deep warm brown colour, and some more of the
character of quartzite. Mr. Allen is of opinion that the formation goes away
in the direction of Mount Barker, and it is probable that it may be found to
connect with Stirling Range, where similar formations exist.— West
Australian, April 21st, 1898.
Metals Other Than Gold.
The mineral wealth of the colony comprises other metals besides gold,
though its less attractive but still solid resources in this respect have
received little attention in the absorbing search for the magic yellow metal.
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


Lead, copper, tin, and coal are to be found —and in districts convenient to
the coast. It is only a matter of time before, in the course of the general
development of the varied resources of this extensive province—the very size
of which constitutes a drawback to its proper exploitation, attention will be
devoted to the possibilities afforded by these deposits of the lesser minerals.
The mineral district of Northampton is rich in copper and lead, and thirty
years ago it was the scene of considerable mining activity. The scarcity of
labour and other drawbacks natural to a new and unrecognised country, com-
bined with a fall in the price of these metals, caused the abandonment of
operations on this field. Since, however, the recent discovery of telluride
ores at Kalgoorlie—requiring to be smelted for the extraction of the gold
they contain—a considerable number of mining leases in the Northampton
district have been taken up by enterprising prospectors, with a view to pro-
ducing the metals which are found to be most suitable for use in fluxing the
gold ore in the smelting process.— West Australia in 1897-8,
ANTIMONY.
There are very good lodes of stibnite (sulphide of antimony) in the
Roebourne District, and their value in most cases is greatly increased by the
quantity of gold they contain. They have not been worked yet, having often
been mistaken for small lead lodes.
ASBESTOS.
Some attention has been turned to a find of asbestos on Jarman Island,
near Cossack. A certain amount of work has been done, and asbestos of a
fair quality has been raised. A find of asbestos, which outcrop along 400 feet,
has been reported from the Boulder country ; also in apparently payable
quantities near Feysville—about 20 miles from Kalgoorlie.
COAL.
Coal is found in various parts of the colony. The Collie field, which,
though only about 233 miles in extent, will, if the seams prove of any
extent, contain an enormous quantity of coal, but to realise the vast amount
let us suppose that one seam, a yard thick, extends over the whole area.
This would give us roughly 250,000,000 tons of coal. There seems to be no
question as to the existence of coal in payable quantity, nor as to the suit-
ability of the coal for many purposes, the only problem now awaiting solu-
tion being the profitable working of the seams ; and there is every probability
that with the advent of the railway this will be solved satisfactorily.
The Irwin Coalfield. —Two coal seams, one 6ft. and the other Bft.
in thickness, have been discovered in the bed of the Irwin River, and a re-
serve of 10,000 acres has been declared by the Government. A belt of
carboniferous country about 20 miles in width extends from the Irwin River
to the Northward crossing the Greenough, the Murchison, the Wooramel,
the Gascoigne, the Lyons and Minilya Rivers, then spreading out over the
Henry, Ashburton, and Fortescue Rivers, and forming the great tableland at
the head of the De Grey.
It is also highly probable that coal will be found in the northern portion
of the Kimberley district, near Wyndhara, where the carboniferous rocks are
largely developed. The shale beds are of great thickness, for in the well at
the base of the Bastion Hill, they were found to go down over 100 feet,
whilst they are seen in sections in the side of the hill 700 or 800 feet.
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


Albany Coal, —Some brown coals have been found all along the
South Coast, and recently, in a bore at Eastwood, near Albany, a three-foot
seam was struck.
Fly Bkook Coal. The Fly Brook is the farthest branch to the
South East of the Donnelly River, which discharges itself into the Southern
Ocean about thirty miles east of Cape Leeuwin. On this brook some coal
mining leases were taken up in 1888, but the existence of coal appears to
have been known for many years to some of the older inhabitants. Several
reports have been made wliich show that four seams of good coal outcrop in
the gully. One of the bores put down, passed through 20ft. of coal in sink-
ing 128 ft. The coal itself is a highly lustrous variety, almost identical in
composition with the coals of the Pacific Coast of North America.
THE COLLIE COAL.
Opinion of Professor McCoy.
On the 13th ult. the Premier wrote to Sir Frederick McCoy, of the
Melbourne University, asking his opinion on a sample of Collie coal sub-
mitted to him.
Professor McCoy has replied in the following terras :
“Melbourne Club, June 27, 1898.
“ My Dear Sir John Forrest, —
“The portion of the boring-core which you sent me from the Collie,
near the port of Bunbury, is an excellent bituminous coal, and being, as yon
informed me, 3ft. thick, is of great commercial value. If less than 3ft. thick
of coal undivided by beds of stone had to be worked, the expense of getting
the coal for market would be greatly increased. There was no possit to be
seen, so that I could not determine the age, whether masozoic or paleozoic ;
but I have for fifty years been impressing on the public that the masozoic
coal is as good as palasozoic coal for the most economic purposes, and the beds
of this age in Richmond, in Virginia, in India, etc., are even of greater
extent than many of the European palaeozoic deposits. Congratulating you
upon a discovery which means so much for the colony which owes so much to
you. (Signed) Frederick McCoy.” — West Australian, July 6th, 1898.
Collie Coal. —ln the fireplaces throughout the Legislative Assembly
coal from the Collie is being used. A sample of the fuel is also on view in
one of the retiring rooms, for the edification of members. The coal came
from the Collie Coalfield Proprietary Company’s colliery at Coalville. It was
taken out at a depth of 132 feet, from the underlay tunnel, from which
headings have been driven 177 feet in a 6ft. seam of coal.— West Australian,
July 20th, 1898.
COPPER AND LEAD.
In the Victoria District the copper and lead occur associated together in
the same lodes, with sometimes blende, ferruginous graphite, barytes and
quartz. The lodes consist of very large and rich deposits of lead and copper,
which were successfully worked for many years. The copper ores are very
rich, consisting near the surface of the blue and green carbonates, with a
certain amount of native copper. The mining district was proclaimed in
July, 1897, and has a total area of 930 square miles.
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


From the year 1845, when almost the first shipment of ore from this
district was made, to the 31st December, 1896, 8529 tons of copper, and
33,939 tons of lead ore were exported from this part of the colony. In 1880
when the price fell to £8 per ton the export was much decreased, but lately,
attention has again been directed to the district, and a number of mineral
leases, chiefly copper, have been applied for. Copper and lead are also found
at Irwin, Mount Negri, Roeburne, Kimberley, Mount Barren (about 120
miles east of Albany), Wongan Hills, Darling Range, Glenelg Range, &c.
GRAPHITE.
Sone years ago a deposit of graphite was worked at Kendinup, and the
samples sent away wore stated to be of very fair quality, but owing to the
distance from a port, the “ find ” was abandoned. Now that the railway
passes so close to the mine another attempt should be made to
deposit. If systematic efforts to do so were made, they would undoubtedly
meet with success. Deposits have been met with at Mount’s Brook, and in
the neighborhood of Busselton.
IRON.
West Australia is essentially an iron country, for one cannot travel a
mile in the parts where the older rocks appear at the surface without
encountering a lode. It occurs in many forms, in immense loads, and there
is probably enough to supply the whole world should the present sources be
worked out.
Owing to the large quantity of iron in this colony it is almost impossible
to work with any degree of accuracy with a magnetic compass.
KAOLIN.—(CHINA CLAY AND PIPECLAY).
Throughout the Darling Range, and in most of the granitic country,
large and very pure deposits of kaolin occur, many of which are pure enough
to be used as whitewash. These deposits will be of great value for china-
making when the population increases.
MANGANESE.
Manganese has been found in many parts of the Colony. Some of the
lodes are very good both in size and quality, but none have been worked.
MICA.
Very good mica has been found at Bindoon, and also on the Blackwood
River and in many other places, often of considerable size, and splitting well.
Some good mica was excavated in 1896 at Pyramid Hill, on the Upper
Gascoigne, specimens shown measuring nearly a foot by 10 inches.
At one claim a large amount of work has been done. The hill where
the shafts have been put down seems to be one mass of mica, and ought to
be very valuable.
TIN.
The Greenbushes Tinfield, in area 50 square miles, is situated near the
highest part of the range, on the north-east side of the Blackwood River, and
between two of its branches. From the high peak in the middle of the field
the leads and gutters radiate, but, as a rule, they are better formed on the
southern and western sides. The miners have traced the lead above the
Bunbury, where it has proved very rich, and they have also discovered the

branch lead from the north-west, which is also rich. That a rich belt of
tin-bearing country does exist is proved, and it should be easily tested, par-
ticularly in such places as Williams’, where the rock outcrops at the surface,
and where an extensive, rich patch of stream tin is still being worked, the
particles of tin being so sharp as to prove conclusively that they have never
travelled, and, therefore, that the tin-bearing veins must cross this area.
That they do exist a little to the northward we do know, but, as the surface
deposits are not so rich here, it would be better to test below, where more
stream tin has been found.
Tin has also been found in the alluvial workings at Pilbarra. A very
rich deposit of coarse stream tin occurs on the Swan, which assayed 71 per
cent, of metallic tin. Prospects are obtained in many places between Pilbarra
and the Nullagine, all of which country is very favourable for deposits of tin.
ZINC.
Blende occur in the Greraldton District, associated with galena. A lode
has been found lately a little south of Perth, and the samples sent in assayed
75 per cent, of zinc. It also occurs with the galena at Cardup.
Extract from “ Sunday Times ” (Perth),
August 28, 1898.
“ Our gold export is keeping up magnificently, and there is always the
possibility of new discoveries. Very shortly we shall have a big boom in
copper, and if full advantage is taken of this opportunity a decided revival
may yet be brought about, as copper lodes of enormous potentialities are to be
found in many portions of the colony. The timber trade, also, is developing
well. Last, but not least, we would mention that there is good reason for
believing that our known diamondiferous areas will undergo profitable
development in the near future. We are informed on very good authority
that large diamonds have recently been discovered on a well-known goldfield,
and that specimens are now in Perth, some of which are as large as an
ordinary-sized button. If expectations in relation to this find are realised it
might easily soon become the means of increasing our present population by
at least 100,000 souls. From these circumstances we draw favourable
auguries.”
FOREST RESERVES
VAST WOODED WEALTH.
Mr, Ednie Brown, Conservator of Forests for the Colony, says in a
recent official report :—“ The marketable timber now growing in the forests
of West Australia is worth, deducting one-third for waste in sawing, no less
a sum than, in round numbers, £124,000,000.” He works his estimate out
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


clearly to this result, and is careful to point out that these enormous figures
represent only the matured timber now ready for the saw. With proper con-
servation, he asserts, the wooded wealth of the Colony will be inexhaustible.
In another part of the admirable compilation referred to, he remarks : “In
all my experience of forestry—a life one in the profession—l have not been
privileged to deal with anything so full of possibilities towards permanent
national wealth as this.”
The report in question is well worth reading from any point of view, and
it is rendered the more interesting by the addition of a number of fine
photographic illustrations of typical views and scenes in the timber country.
No one looking at the presentments of gigantic trees, which actually go
through the top of the picture, and beside which a man appears but a pigmy,
can for a moment question the existence of vast timber resources in this
variously-favoured land. At present there are some 50 steam sawmills at
work in the forests of West Australia, cutting up and shaping the great
logs of jarrah and karri and other hardwoods into workable dimensions, and
short lengths of railways have been built to give connection between these
scenes of operation and the sea, fortunately close at hand. At present the
demand for West Australian hardwoods is far greater than the means for
supply, thus affording a grand opening for capitalists.
Rapid Progress of Settlement.
“Land settlement is one of the greatest works before us. We have to
reclaim the wilderness, and make this country productive.” Such were the
words used by the Treasurer of the colony (Right Hon. Sir. John Forrest)
in his budget speech, and they fitly express the policy of the Government in
regard to encouraging occupation and cultivation of the soil of the colony
now being so energetically prosecuted by the Commissioner of Crown Lands
(the Hon. George Throssell). The Treasurer then referred to the satisfactory
progress being made with settlement under the systems of Conditional Pro-
gress and Free Farms.
The figures with regard to land selection show the progress made, in a
striking light. The Free Farms provided for under the Homesteads Act
1893, have become highly popular, 562 selections covering 84,987 acres
having been taken up in 1897, as compared with 214 selections, aggregating
30,704 acres in 1896.
It is important to note that the selectors under this head are nearly all
new settlers. Under the more popular of the clauses providing for Con-
ditional Purchase, similar results are shown. Clause 46, which embraces
sections 33 and 34 of the Homesteads Act, accounted for 214 selections of
in all 41,885 acres, or more than during the two preceding years taken
together ; while the 1081 selections (187,151 acres) under the clause 48
actually exceed in numbers the total for the preceding five years, and the 429-
selections (79,200 acres) under clause 49 are larger than those of the three
earlier years taken together.
The area taken up under Pastoral Leases also shows for the first time
for many years a large increase. In various other classes, the Government
The Intercolonial Investment, Land & Building Company, Limited, Sydney.


Lands business shows an expansion more or less pronounced, all tending to
show the prevalence of a strong faith in the future of the colony as a producer,
and as a market for the products of the soil.
The agricultural areas already mapped out for settlement comprise well
over a million acres, and as the land is taken up, fresh extents of cultivable
country are measured out along the routes of the various railway lines, which
have been carried through the agricultural districts. Along the 240 miles of
the Great Southern line of railway, which runs north from Albany on the
South coast to Beverley, are situated the majority of the agricultural areas
yet thrown open for selection, and applications for these fertile lands,
especially suitable for grain growing and fruit culture in combination, are
now literally pouring into the Government Lands Office. But there remain
millions of acres available, and although productive operations are now being
vigorously prosecuted in the various suitable localities in the colony, the
demand for the edible products of the soil still distances the supply. As
these products are necessaries of life, the demand for them can never diminish.
The continual expansion of the goldfields and the steady increase in the
population, have created an enormous demand for all classes of agricultural
products, which has quite outstripped the slower capabilities of agricultural
development.
Fruitgrowing. —Without doubt West Australia, speaking especially
of its more fertile south-west division, comprises large tracts of country,
second to none in the world for the purpose of fruit raising. Soil, climate,
altitude, proximity to active and growing centres of population, together
with easy railway access to these eager markets, all are in favour of the
remunerative prosecution of this delightful industry.
Viticulture is one of the most important of all the resources from
which West Australia will assuredly draw her prosperity in the days to come.
The capabilities of West Australia for providing as fine grapes of different
kinds as any country on earth, will never diminish so long as the sun shines
on the gentle slopes of the coastal range, the soil and position of which are
so exactly suitable for the grape. No accurate returns are available as to the
quantity of West Australian wine now made. But it may be roughly
estimated at from 65,000 to 70,000 gallons. Double the quantity could be
manufactured from the present vineyards but for the fact that a very con-
siderable portion of the wine grape crop finds ready sale as an edible table
delicacy. A good market for the local wine exists in the colony.— West
Australia in 1897-8.
Agriculture in West Australia.
West Australia, which a few years ago bore the reputation of being »
barren inhospitable waste fit or none others than the boldest of pioneer
pastoralists, is gradually becoming strong in agricultural resources. There is
nothing superior to a mining rush as an advance agent for agriculturists.
The men who helped to exploit Coolgardie were among the first to realise
that cabbages were almost as valuable as nuggets, and that the man who had
a few good cows could rapidly make money by establishing a dairy. Victoria’s
experience has been similar to that of the Western country. Many of
Victoria’s leading agriculturists were at one time mining on Ballarat or
Bendigo. There was a time, too, when this colony was rated as being of not
more worth than a pasturage for a few sheep and cattle. Much of the land

which was at one time considered to be not able to support even bandicoots is
now wheat-producing. Some of the parts which were not fit for white men to
live in have their towns with big populations. These are our reflections while
glancing over some statistical literature recently to hand from the Western
colony. The Year Book , Land of Promise, and Statistical Register are,
from a printer’s point of view, very creditable productions, and contain
immense masses of interesting, useful information. For instance, it is well to
know that the area now under cultivation in West Australia is about
120.000 acres, or about double what was tilled ten years ago. Taking the
figures of 1896 crop returns we find that 81,488 were under wheat, 1903
under barley, 1753 under oats, some 900 under various root crops, nearly
70.000 under hay of all kinds, about 2300 under vines, and 2700 laid out in
orchards and gardens. Those figures give a fair indication of the directions
up to now taken by cultivable endeavour in Western Australia. The facilities
given to intending agriculturists, although they are not quite as liberal as they
should be, are encouraging much settlement. On the Meckering area, some
20 miles east from Northam along the railway to the Coolgardie goldfields,
in a locality that a few years ago was deemed to be uncultivable owing to
supposed uncertainty of rainfall, the whole 90,000 acres thrown open for
selection have been taken up, and are being vigorously worked, with most
satisfactory results. Nor has settlement stopped here on the route to the
dry interior. Fifty miles further east and nearer the goldfields, the settler
has established himself, and is busily engaged in raising crops. The
supposition as to the uncertainty of rainfall—a legacy of the ignorant and
unenterprising days that preceded the discovery of gold—has been exploded,
properly kept statistics showing a fair average fall, A mixed system of
farming is followed. The production of vegetables and fruits is assisting the
wheat-grower, who finds, as we do here, that an Australian farmer requires
not less than 640 acres of land. The large farms permit extensive fallowing,
and still give returns which are sufficiently remunerative to the farmer. In
1896 West Australia produced 243,928 bushels of wheat, 12,816 bushels of
barley, 18,871 bushels of oats, 504 bushels of maize, 2089 tons of potatoes,
and 50,500 tons of hay. These products were very quickly absorbed through
local demands, and that there is still much room for the expansion of profit-
able agriculture is shown in the statement that during the year 1896 no less
than £BO,OOO was sent out of the colony for bacon, £148,971 for butter,
£47,466 for preserved milk, £33,000 for eggs, over £48,000 for jams and
preserves, and over £52,000 for canned fruits and vegetables. —Sydney Mail ,

Railways.
The rapid growth and continuous extension of the State Railway System
of West Australia, coupled with extremely satisfactory financial results, afford
one of the most conclusive proofs of the progress the Colony is making.
The line of rails, running some 400 miles inland from Fremantle, renders it
not only possible but easy for the mines on the goldfields of Coolgardie and
Kalgoorlie to be supplied with the machinery requisite for their due develop-
ment, and the same may be said of the line connecting the seaport of
Geraldton with Cue, the principal centre of the Murchison auriferous district.
These two goldfields stretch from the coast far eastward and inland, while
the South-Western Division of the Colony, which contains the more culti-
vable soil, is traversed by trunk railways for its whole length, from Albany
in the south to Geraldton in the north, a connection being formed at Midland
Junction, near Perth, between the Government line and the private railway
that spans the rest of the distance.
Probably no country so sparsely populated can boast of so extensive a
railway mileage, and the rate of expansion has been remarkable. Seven
years ago the total length of line in the Colony was 183 miles, whereas at
present there are no less than 1,380 miles of railway open for traffic. The
total is made up as follows ;
Government Railways— Miles.
Main Lines (not including 87 miles of sidings) ... 1,050
Private Lines—
At the same date there were over 300 miles more of railways in course
of construction, including that from Mullewa to Cue (197 miles) ; the exten
sion of the South-Western Line (42 miles), to the fertile country in the
Blackwood district ; 26 miles of branch railway, from the South-Western
Railway to the Collie Coalfield ; and some other smaller extensions, both on
the Coolgardie Goldfields and in the agricultural districts of the South-
Western Division. Thus it is seen that, while the development of the
mining industry of the Colony is being duly assisted by the construction of
new lines, the farming districts are not forgotten.
The Climate.
Blessed in its South-western and more habitable regions along the lower
coast-line with a magnificent climate, West Australia should, when its
attractiveness shall be better known, become one of the health resorts of the
world. The natural salubrity of its climate is a charm of which nothing short
of a tremendous and convulsive revolution in all the conditions of our planet
can rob this Sunny Land of Promise. The climate, as might be expected

from the enormous size of the Colony, varies a good deal in the different
parts. In the South and South-west it is unrivalled, being temperate and
cool, and with a regular and sufficient rainfall, as is evidenced by the
magnificent jarrah and karri forests, and other valuable timbers, as well as by
the abundance of the fruit and other crops produced. Out Eastward the
climate is drier, but the soil still receives a fair rainfall, and on the Murchison
and Gascoigne extremely heavy dews make up, to a great extent, for the
lesser rainfall, and the heat occasionally experienced is, as a rule, tempered by
strong and cool breezes.
Public Works Expenditure.
A point deserving especial attention, as showing that West Australia
is not relying altogether upon borrowed money for the construction of
necessary and developmental public works, is that of the gross expenditure of
£1,289,209 on such works during the financial year last closed, no less than
£638,500, or just about half\ was provided out of annual consolidated
revenue, and not out of loan money, and it is to the point to quote here the
following significant line from the report of the Public Works Department,
covering the period under review :—“ The great prosperity experienced by
the Colony during the past year is not, therefore, due to an unusual expendi-
ture of borrowed money. As may be seen from the estimated expenditure
this year of £2,700,000 out of the General Loan Fund, the Government is
considerably extending the scope of its developmental operations, not blindly
or recklessly, but with a judiciously cautious boldness.” ( Extract from

A CANNY SCOT.
One of Dunedin’s inhabitants, who is still hale and hearty, has owned
one of the best corner sections in the city ever since the first sale of town
land took place soon after the foundation of the settlement. The original
price was only £l2'los., but it is now worth at least £50,000. When the
diggings rush took place a Melbourne merchant wanted to buy the section,
and offered him £lOOO for it. This seemed at the time a fabulous amount
to the owner, who, however, did not want to sell. “ Gae awa’ wi’ ye mon,”
he said to the tempter, “Ye canna have come by your money honestly, or ye
wadna be sae free wi’ yer thousands.”—Extract from the Bulletin.
Says a Melbourne paper :—The Theatre Royal in Bourke-street, is lease-
hold property, the tenants paying £l5OO a year for the use of the land, which
the original owner acquired for the sum of £9l 4s. The Victoria Arcade is
also leasehold property, the owner of which pays £l3OO a year for the use of
land originally costing £9B 16s. The Eastern Arcade is another leasehold,
the ground rent of which is £l2OO a year, the freehold having cost £B7 Bs.
Only a few years ago the State sold these three little patches of land for
£276 in all, and thereby loses an annual income of £4OOO, with unlimited
prospects of future increase. Let it be said again. In 1887, Henry
Howey, a Sydney milkman, bought Nicholson’s corner, Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, for £94. His nephew, Major Howey, now lives in a Scotch Castle,
and draws £40,000 a year in rents from Melbourne. The property is let on
building leases, and in 1888 it was valued at £889,500. — Bulletin.
Major-General Sir J. B. Edwards, K.C.M.G., in his paper on “Austra-
lian Defences,” says' —“ No one can visit the Australian Colonies without
being greatly impressed with the future that lies before them, and no vivid
imagination is required to picture the time when railway communication will
be established between all parts, when Perth and Fremantle will become
one great city, the great Brindisi of Australia.”
