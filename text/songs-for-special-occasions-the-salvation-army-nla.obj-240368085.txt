SONGS FOR SPECIAL
OCCASIONS
Arizona, 21. F. Alstone, 22. C
1 FAITH is the living power from Heaven | Which
I takes the promise God has given; | Securely fixed
on Christ alone | A faith that cannot be overthrown.
2 Faith finds in Christ whate’er we need | To save
and strengthen, guide and feed: I Strong in His grace,
it joys to share | His cross, in hope His Crown to
wear.
3 Faith to the conscience whispers peace | And
bids the sorrower’s sighing cease. | By faith the
children’s right we claim J And call upon our Fath-
er’s name.
4 This faith in me, my God implant | And to my
prayer an answer grant | Through Jesus, Thy Be-
loved Son | Who is my health and power alone.
Hollingside, 171. Eb. Aberystwyth, ]7o Ab.
Maidstone, 176. G.
GOD of Grace, all praise above | God of Wisdom,
“ perfect Love | Thou shalt choose my warrior way
| Guide my footsteps day by day | Nothing will Thy
hand withhold | Of the bounty long foretold | Every
need wilt Thou supply | Ever watchful, ever nigh.
2 Every care with Thee I leave | Daily from Thy
hands receive | Food for body, mind and soul |
Strength to keep my spirit whole ) Resting evermore
on Thee | Till my wondering eyes shall see | Perfect
wisdom, perfect love | In Thy home of Light above.
3 Only let my passing life [ With its ever varied
strife j Surging round my onward way | Know Thy
labour—so I may | Scatter blessing as I go | Sooth-
ing sorrow, healing woe | Gladly telling—heavenward
bound | What a Saviour I have found.


Lc'-fdonderry Air.
3 HOLD Thou my hand, so weak I am and help-
less | I dare not take one step without Thy aid [
Hold Thou my hand, for then, O loving Saviour | No
dread of ill shall make my soul afraid | Hold Thou
my hand, and closer, closer draw me | To Thy dear
Self, my hope, my joy, my all | Hold Thou my hand,
lest haply I should wander | And missing Thee, my
trembling feet should fall.
I trust in Thee, for Thou art the almighty One |
I trust in Thee, for Thou my Father art | I trust in
Thee, thro’ time and thro’ eternity | To hold me safe
within Thy loving, tender heart.
2 Hold Thou my hand, the way is dark before
me | Without the sunlight of Thy face divine | But
when by faith I catch its radiant glory | What
heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine |
Hold Thou my hand, that when I reach the margin |
Of that lone river Thou didst cross for me | A
heavenly light may flash across its waters | And
every wave like crystal bright shall be.
The Ash Grove, 363. Ab.
4 HE giveth more grace as our burdens grow
greater, | He sendeth more strength as our
labours increase; | To added afflictions He addeth
His mercy, | To multiplied trials He multiplies Peace!
2 When we have exhausted our store of endur-
ance, | When our strength has failed ere the day is
half done, | When we reach the end of our hoarded
resources, | Our Father’s full giving is only begun!
3 His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
| His power no boundary known unto men; | For
out of His infinite riches in Jesus | He giveth—and
giveth—and giveth again!
Sandon, 453. G.
5 HERE is my heart; my God I give it Thee | I
hear Thee say, | “Not to the world, my child, but
unto Me.” | I now obey, ( Here is my love’s glad
offering to its King | My heart in willing sacrifice I
bring!


2 Here is my heart! Surely the gift tho’ poor |
Thou’lt not despise | Vainly I’ve longed and sought
to make it pure, [ To meet Thine eyes. | Corrupted
first by tempted Adam’s Fall, | The stains of sin
doth now pollute it all!
3 Here is my heart! Blest Holy Spirit come | And
now renew; | Oh, consecrate it, wholly as Thine
own, | Thy temple true; | Teach it to love and serve
Thee more and more, | To fear Thee, worship, trust
Thee, and adore.
4 Here is my heart! Teach it, O Lord, to cling |
Secure to Thee; | And in the day of trial and battle
sing | Of love to Thee, | Believing, all my fighting
journey through, | That Thou art faithful, wise and
just and true.
Holly, 40. F.
6HERE, Lord, I meet Thee face to face | I touch
by faith the things unseen | Here grasp with
firmer hand Thy Grace | And confidently on Thee
lean.
2 I have no help nor do I need | Other than Thee
to rest upon ( Thou art sufficient, Lord, indeed | My
strength is in Thy arm alone.
3 I have no wisdom save in Thee | Wisdom and
Teacher both in one J I lack not If Thou schoolest
me | Knowledge I seek from Thee alone!
4 Although dark perils compass me | And evils
threaten, I’ll not fear | Nor feebly shrink or turn to
flee | Whilst Thou, O Christ, art strongly near!
Eden, 5. Ab.
7 HOW shall we thank Thee for Thy Grace |
We kiss the hand that holds the rod | Our
willing feet shall tread Thy ways | And chastened
souls shall walk with God.
2 For Thou dost hold us in Thy Heart | Thine
eye corrects; Thy love revives | Sin’s sickness flies
before Thy word! Thy kindness makes our souls to
live.


3 We thank Thee; Thou dost fill our cup ) Thy
gifts in sorrow bring delight | Thy Grace from Hell
hath raised us up | And cast our sins far from Thy
sight!
4 To Thee, our strength, all praise belongs | And
as the years to us are given | Thy temple courts
shall hear our songs | And glad thanksgivings raised
to Heaven!
Missionary, 185. Eb.
SIN heavenly love abiding | No change my heart
shall fear | And safe is such confiding | For
nothing changes there | The storm may roar with-
out me | My hopes may low be laid | But God is
round about me | So I am not dismayed.
2 Wherever He may lead me | No fear shall turn
me back | My Captain is beside me | And nothing
can I lack | His wisdom ever waketh | His sight is
never dim | He knows the way He taketh' | And I
will walk with Him.
3 New triumphs are before me [ Greater than
those I’ve seen | Bright skies are op’ning o’er me I
Where darkened clouds have been | My wealth I
cannot measure | My life from sin is free | My
Saviour is my treasure | And He now walks with
me.
Chalvey, 138. P.
9 1 HAVE no claim on grace | I have no right to
plead | I stand before my Maker’s face | Con-
demned in thought and deed | But since there died
a Lamb [ Who, guiltless, my guilt bore | I lay fast
hold on Jesus Name | And sin is mine no more.
2 From whence my soul’s distress [ But from the
hold of sin? | And whence my hope of righteousness |
But from Thy grace within? | I speak to Thee my
need 1 And tell my true complaint | Thou only can
convert indeed | A sinner to a saint!


N nI u \
3 O pardon-speaking blood | O soul-renewing
grace | Through Christ I know the love of God |
And see the Father’s face | I now set forth Thy
praise | Thy loyal servant I 1 And gladly dedicate
my days | My God to glorify.
Euphony, 212. Eb,
LO! God is here! Let us adore 1 And own,
I Uhow glorious is this place | Let all within us
feel His power | And silent bow before His face |
Who know His power, His grace who prove f Serve
Him with awe, with reverence, love.
2 Holiest of beings, may our praise | Thy courts
with grateful fragrance fill | Still may we stand
before Thy face 1 Still hear and do Thy sovereign
will | To Thee may all our thoughts arise | Cease-
less, accepted sacrifice!
3 Gladly the toys of earth we leave | Wealth,
pleasure, fame, for Thee alone | To Thee our will,
soul, flesh we give | Oh, take, Oh, seal them for
Thine own | Thou art the God ! Thou art the Lord |
Be Thou by all Thy works adored!
S.B. 347. Hyfrydel, 312. G. Salvator, 310, G.
nLOVE Divine, all loves excelling | Joy of Hea-
ven to earth come down | Fix in us Thy
humble dwelling 1 All Thy faithful mercies crown I
Jesus, Thou art all compassion | Pure, unbounded
love Thou art | Visit us with Thy salvation | Enter
every longing heart.
2 Come, Almighty to deliver 1 Let us all Thy grace
receive | Suddenly return, and never | Never more
Thy temples leave | Thee we would be always bless-
ing | Serve Thee as Thy hosts above | Pray, and
praise Thee without ceasing | Glory in Thy perfect
love.
3 Finish, then, Thy new creation | Pure and spot-
less let us be | Let us see Thy great Salvation |
Perfectly restored in Thee | Changed from glory
into glory | Till in Heaven we take our place | Till
we cast our crowns before Thee | Lost in wonder,
love, and praise.


Arizona, 21. F. Eden, 5. Ab.
| O CORD of ail being, throned afar | Thy glory
• * flames from sun and star | Centre and soul of
every sphere | Yet to each loving heart how near.
2 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn | Our
noontide is Thy gracious dawn | Our rainbow arch, |
Thy mercy’s sign | All, save the clouds of sin, are
Thine.
3 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray | Sheds on
our path the glow of day 1 Star of our hope, Thy
softened light ] Cheers the long watches of the night.
4 Lord of all life, below, above | Whose light is
truth, whose warmth, is love | Before Thy ever-
blazing Throne | We ask no lustre of our own.
5 Grant us Thy truth to make us free | And kind-
ling hearts that burn for Thee | Till all Thy living
altars claim | One holy light, one heavenly flame.
Santa Lucia, 372. Bb.
MORE love to Thee! O Christ | More love to
Thee | Hear Thou the prayer I make | On
bended knee | This is my earnest plea | More love,
O Christ, to Thee | More love, O Christ, to Thee |
More love to Thee!
2 Once earthly joys I craved | But found no rest |
Now Thee alone I seek | With what is best ) Con-
stant my prayer shall be | More love, O Christ, to
Thee | More love, O Christ, to Thee | More love to
Thee!
3 If sorrow do its work | Or grief and pain |
Blest are Thy Ministers | My loss is gain | If they
but rouse in me | More love, O Christ, to Thee |
More love, O Christ, to Thee | More love to Thee!
4 On to my latest breath | I’ll sing Thy praise |
The last exultant cry | My heart shall raise | Will
be this prayer to Thee | More love, O Christ, to
Thee | More love, O Christ, to Thee | More love to
Thee!


Deep Harmony, 8.J., 1042. Eb.
1 A MOST gracious Spirit, Source of all | The world
■"■ without, the life within | Fountain of Love, Oh,
hear our call | And pour Thy living waters in.
2 Thou breathest in the rushing wind | Thy beauty
shines in leaf and flowers | Nor wilt Thou from the
willing mind | Withhold Thy light, and love, and
powers.
3 Thy hand unseen, to accents clear | Provoked
the Psalmist’s trembling lyre | And touched the lips
of holy Seer | With flame from Thine own altar
fire.
4 That touch Divine still, Lord, impart | Give us
the Prophets’ burning word 1 And, vocal in each
waiting heart | Let living songs of praise be heard.
St. Catherine, 216. Ab.
I" MY God with me in every place | How firmly
■ does Thy promise stand |On land or sea with
present grace [ Still near to succour and withstand \
If you now ask ‘Who is with thee?’ | My God is here
and stands with me.
2 No depth, no prison, trial or grave | Can e’er
exclude Him from His own | His cheering presence
aye I have | Amongst the crowd, and when alone |
In whatsoever state I be | My God is everywhere
with me.
3 My God is with me! glad I say | Thou art the
solace of my soul | Ne’er shall I tremble in dismay I
Though all around me battles roll | If yet you ask
‘What strengthens thee?’ | Sure it is this | God
stands for me.
4 In life, in death, with Him so near | I shall my
every battle win | Boldly press on through dangers
here [ And triumph over every sin | Yes! Even I
shall victor be | For God, my God, will fight with me.


Nearer to Thee, 377. G.
UNOW from the world we turn | Jesus to seek |
Here may His wakening voice | Graciously
speak | Jesus, our Saviour, Friend | While at Thy
feet we bend | To us in love descend | ’Tis Thee we
seek!
2 Come! Holy Comforter | Presence Divine [
Come ! In our yielded hearts | Radiantly shine j
Come down, Almighty Power | Come in this very
hour | Come ! Pentecostal shower 1 This is Thy
time!
3 Saviour, our zeal revive | So shall we see )
Thousands now dead in sin [ Raised up by Thee |
Come now—our heart’s delight | End now our doubts’
sad night | Gladden our waiting sight | We look for
Thee.
Rimington, 23. P.
1"J NOT what lam but what Thou art | That, that
I " alone, can be my rest | Thy love, not mine, bids
fear depart ) And stills the tempest of my breast.
2 It blesses now and e’er shall bless | It saves me
now and ever saves | It holds me in my helplessness |
And bears me safe o’er rolling waves.
3 Girt with Thy love on every side | Breathing
that love as healing air | I work and wait and
trace my Guide | Victorious over every care.
4 ’Tis what I know of Thee, my God | Fills me
with peace, my life with song | Thou art my life,
my joy, my rod | In Thee, in weakness, I am strong.
Houghton, 330. Ab.
1 O O WORSHIP the King | All glorious above | O
I ® gratefully sing | His power and His love | Our
Shield and Defender | The Ancient of days | En-
throned in splendour | And girded with praise.
2 The earth with its store | Of wonders untold |
Almighty! Thy power | Hath founded of old | Hath
’stablished it fast I By a changeless decree | And
round it hath cast | Like a mantle the sea.


3 Thy bountiful love | What tongue can recite? |
It breathes in the air | And shines in the light | It
streams from the hills | It descends to the plain |
And sweetly distils in j The dew and the rain.
4 O measureless might | Of wonderful Love |
Whilst angels delight ,| To hymn Thee above | The
humbler creation | Though lowly their lays | With
true adoration ] Shall join in Thy praise.
Darwells, 142. D. St. John, 143. D.

Behold the Saviour, 85. Eb.
SHOW me Thy face—one transient gleam | Of
•w loveliness divine | And I shall never think or
dream | Of other love save Thine | All lesser light
will darken quite ) All Tower glories wane | The
beautiful of earth will scarce | Seem beautiful again.
2 Show me Thy face—the heaviest cross | Will
then seem light to bear | There will be gain in every
loss | And peace with ev’ry care | All doubts and
fears for future years | In quiet trust subside | And
naught but blest content and calm | Within my
breast abide.


Lascelles, 127. Eb.
SUBMIT thyself to God | Know thou His tender
“ ■ love | So shall the healing sunshine fall | Upon
thee from above.
2 Submit thyself to God | In Him alone is peace |
Rest for that sin-tired heart of thine | And ever-
lasting bliss.
3 Submit thyself to God | Choose thou the better
part | So shall His glorious sunlight be | The day-
spring of thy heart.
4 Submit thyself to God | He bids thee seek His
face | And thus thy happy soul shall know | The
fulness of His grace,
5 Submit thyself to God | He bids thee seek His
Cross | Bead there the love which makes all loss |
As gain, and gain but loss.
Angelus, 26. Eb.
*%*% THOU sweet, beloved will of God, | My anchor
““ ground, 'my fortress hill, | My spirit’s silent,
fair abode, | In Thee I hide me, and am still.
O Will, that wiliest good alone, | Lead Thou the
way, Thou guidest best; A little child, I follow on, |
And trusting, lean upon Thy breast.
3 Thy beautiful, sweet will, my God, | Holds fast
in its sublime embrace, | My captive will, a glad-
some bird, | Prison’d in such a realm of grace.
4 Within this place of certain good, | Love ever-
more expands her wings, | Or nestling in Thy per-
fect choice, | Abides content with what it brings!
5 Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke! | It lifts,
it bears my happy soul, | It giveth wings to this
poor heart, | My freedom is Thy grand control.
Harlan, 367. Eb.
THOU Whose Almighty Word | Chaos and dark-
ness heard | And took their flight | Hear us, we
humbly pray | And let Thy quickening ray | Shine
on our hearts to-day | Let there be light.


2 Thou, Who didst come to bring | On Thy re-
deeming wing | Hearing and sight | Health to the
sick in mind | Sight to the inly blind | Oh! now to
all mankind | Let there be light.
3 Spirit of truth and love | Life-giving Holy
Dove | Speed forth Thy flight | Move on the water’s
face | By Thine Almighty grace | And in the dark-
est place | Let there be light.
Melita, 224. C.
MWE worship Thee, O Crucified | What glories
didst Thou lay aside | What depths of human
grief and sin | Didst Thou consent to languish in |
That through Atoning blood outpoured | Our broken
peace should be restored?
2 We mourn that e’er our hearts should be (
One with a world that loves not Thee | That with
the crowd we passed Thee by | And saw, but did
not feel Thee die | Not till we knew our guilt and
shame | Did we esteem the Saviour’s name.
3 Though with our sin we shunned the Light |
Thou didst not leave us in the night | We were not
left to blindly stray | Unsought, unloved from Thee
away | For from Thy Cross irradiates | A power
that saves and recreates!
4 Oh, loved above all earthly love | To Thee our
hearts adoring move | Thy boundless mercies yearn
to save | And in Thy blood sin’s wounds to lave |
Oh, speed the day when men shall see 1 That human
hopes are all in Thee.
S.B. 1. My Jesus I Love Thee 340.
2C O BOUNDLESS Salvation! Deep ocean of love |
O fulness of mercy Christ brought from above |
The whole world redeeming, so rich and so free |
Now flowing for all men—come, roll over me!
2 My sins they are many, their stains are so
deep ( And bitter the tears of remorse that I weep |
But useless is weeping, thou great crimson sea |
Thy waters can cleanse me, come, roll over me!


3 O ocean of mercy, oft longing I’ve stood | On
the brink of thy wonderful, life-giving flood! | Once
more I have reached this soul-cleansing sea | I will
not go back till it rolls over me.
S.B. 454. I surrender all. 283.
O# ALL to Jesus I surrender | All to Him I freely
give 1 I will ever love and trust Him, in His
presence daily live.
1 surrender all | All to Thee, my blessed Saviour |
I surrender all.
2 All to Jesus I surrender | Humbly at His feet
I bow | Worldly pleasures all forsaken | Take me,
Jesus, take me now.
3 All to Jesus I surrender | Make me, Saviour,
wholly Thine | Let the Holy Spirit witness | I am
Thine and Thou art mine.
4 All to Jesus I surrender | Lord, I give myself

TELL me the old, old story | Of unseen things
above | Of Jesus and His glory | Of Jesus and
His love | Tell me the story simply | As to a little
child | For I am weak and weary | And helpless and
defiled.
Tell me the old, old story | Of Jesus and His love!
2 Tell me the story slowly | That I may take it
in | That wonderful redemption | God’s remedy for
sin | Tell me the story often | For I forget so soon |
The early dew of morning j Has passed away at
noon.
3 Tell me the story softly | With earnest tones
and grave | Remember! Pm the sinner | Whom
Jesus came to save | Tell me the story always |
If you would really be | In any time of trouble | A
comforter to me.
S.B. 2. Rockingham 16.
AA WHEN I survey the wondrous cross |On which
the Prince of Glory died | My richest gain I
count but loss | And pour contempt on all my pride.
2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast | Save in
the death of Christ, my God | All the vain things
that charm me most | I sacrifice them to His blood.
3 See, from His head, His hands, His feet | Sor-
row and love flow mingled down | Did e’er such love
and sorrow meet | Or thorns compose so rich a
crown?
4 Were the whole realm of nature mine [ That
were a present far too small | Love so amazing, so
divine | Demands my soul, my life, my all.
S.B. 472. Austria, 296.
LOVE Divine, from Jesus flowing | Living wat-
ers rich and free 1 Wondrous love, without a
limit | Flowing from eternity | Boundless ocean | I
would cast myself on Thee !


2 Love surpassing understanding ) Angels would
the mystery scan | Yet so tender that it reaches |
To the lowest child of man | Let me, Jesus J Fuller
know redemption’s plan.
3 Love that pardons past transgression | Love
that cleanses every stain | Love that fills to over-
flowing | Yet invites to drink again | Precious Foun-
tain | Which to open Christ was slain.
4 From my soul break every fetter | Thee to know
is all my cry | Saviour, I am Thine for ever | Thine
I’ll live and Thine I’ll die | Only asking | More and
more of love’s supply.
S.B. 79. Who’ll be the next, 408.
WHO’LL be the next to follow Jesus. Who’ll be
■ the next His cross to bear | Some one is ready,
some one is waiting | Who’ll be the next a crown to
wear?
Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus now?
2 Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus | Come and
bow at His precious feet [ Who’ll be the next to lay
every burden [ Down at the Father’s Mercy-seat?
3 Who’ll be the next to follow Jesus | Who’ll be
the next to praise His name | Who’ll swell the chorus
of free redemption | Sing Hallelujah! Praise the
Lamb!
JESUS is tenderly calling thee home— | Calling
to-day, calling to-day! | Why from the sunshine
of love wilt thou roam | Farther and farther away?
2 Jesus is calling the weary to rest — | Calling
to-day, calling to-day! | Bring Him thy burden, and
thou shalt be blest | He will not turn thee away.
3 Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now— |
Waiting to-day, waiting to-day! | Come with thy
sins, at His feet lowly bow | Come, and no longer
delay.


Whiter than the Snow, 410.
BLESSED be the Fountain of blood | To a
33 world of sinners revealed | Blessed be the dear
Son of God | Only by His stripes we are healed [ Tbo’
I’ve wandered far from His fold | Bringing to my
heart pain and woe, Wash me in the Blood of the
Lamb | And I shall be whiter than snow!
Whiter than the snow! | Wash me in the Blood of
the Lamb | And I shall be whiter than snow!
2 Thorny was the crown that He wore | And the
Cross His body o’ercame | Grievous were the sor-
rows He bore | But He suffered not thus in vain |
May I to that Fountain be led | Made to cleanse my
sins here below! | Wash me in the blood that He
shed, | And I shall t whiter than snow!
3 Father, I have wandered from Thee | Often
has my heart gone astray [ Crimt,. n do my sins seem
to me—| Water cannot wash them away | Jesus, to
that Fountain of Thine | Leaning on Thy promise I
go | Cleanse me by Thy washing divine | And I shall
be whiter than snow!
S.B. 370. Toplady, 167.
* OH, disclose Thy lovely face | Quicken all my
3 ■ drooping: powers | Gasps my fainting: soul for
grace | As a thirsty land for showers | Haste, my
Lord, no more delay ( Come, my Saviour, come away!
2 Dark and cheerless is the morn | Unaccom-
panied by Thee | Joyless is the day’s return ) Till
Thy mercy’s beams I see I Till Thou inward light
Impart | Glad my eyes and warm my heart.
3 Visit, then, this soul of mine J Pierce the gloom
of sin and grief | Fill me, Radiance Divine ) Scatter
all my unbelief! | More and more Thyself display |
Shining to the perfect day.
S.B. 73. Christ receiveth sinful men, 159.

S.B. 458. Anything for Jesus, 378.
JESUS, precious Saviour, Thou hast saved my
soul, From sin’s fold corruption made me fully
whole; Every hour I’ll serve Thee, whate’er may
befall | Till in Heaven I’ll crown Thee King and
Lord of all.
All my heart I give Thee | Day by day, come what
may All my life I give Thee | Dying men to save.
2 From the lowly manger I will follow Thee [
In the desert and the strife near Thee I will be |
E’en the sufferings of the cross I will gladly bear | If
with Thee in Heaven I a crown may wear.
3 In the toils and conflicts faithful I will be | All
things I will gladly bear, they’ll be good for me |
To be a saviour of mankind, slaves of sin to bring |
Give me holy courage, mighty, mighty King.
4 Precious souls are dying, nerve me for the fight,
Help me spread the glorious news—liberty and light;
Fiercer gets the contest, Satan’s power shall fall |
Then on earth I’ll crown Thee glorious Lord of all.
Horsley, 73.
TALK with us, Lord, Thyself reveal, | While
here on earth we rove; | Speak to our hearts
and let ns feel | The kindling of Thy love.
2 With Thee conversing we forget | All time, and
toil, and care; | Labor is rest, and pain is sweet, |
If Thou, my God, art here.
3 Here then, our God, vouchsafe to stay, | And
bid our souls rejoice; ( Our bounding hearts shall
own Thy sway | And echo to Thy voice.
4 Thou callest us to seek Thy face; | ’Tis all we
wish to seek; | To tend the whispers of Thy grace, |
And hear Thee only speak.

glory see; | Enter into our Master’s joy, | And find
our heaven in Thee.

2 Ah, mine iniquity crimson hath been | Infinite,
infinite sin upon sin | Sin of not loving Thee, sin of
not trusting Thee | Sin of not serving Thee—infinite
sin.
3 Lord, I confess to Thee, sadly my sin, Now tell
I all to Thee, all I have been | Purge Thou my sin
away, wash Thou my soul this day | Take Thou my
sin away—Lord, make me clean.

Count your blessings, see what God hath done
Count your blessings, name them one by one | And

2 Are you ever burdened with a load of care? \
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear? |
Count your many blessings, ev’ry doubt will fly 1
And you will keep singing as the days go by.
3 When you look at others with their lands and
gold | Think that Christ has promised you His wealth

4 So, amid the conflict, whether great dr small |
Do not be disheartened, God is over all | Count your

2 To Him shall endless prayer be made, And
praises throng to crown His head | His name like
sweet perfume shall rise | With every morning sacri-
fice.
3 People and realms of every tongue. Dwell on
His love with sweetest song | And infant voices shall
proclaim | Their young hosannas to His name.
4 Let every creature rise, and bring | Its grateful
honours to our King | Angels descend with songs
again | And earth prolong the joyful strain.
WHEN we walk with the Lord | In the light
of His Word | What a glory He sheds on our
way | While we do His good will | He abides with ns
still | And with all who will trust and obey.
Trust and obey, for there’s no other way | To be
happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
2 Not a shadow can rise | Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away | Not a doubt
nor a fear | Not a sigh nor a tear | Can abide while
we trust and obey.
3 Not a burden we bear | Not a sorrow we share |
But our toil He doth richly repay | Not a grief nor
a loss | Not a crown nor a cross j But is blest if we
trust and obey.
4 But we never can prove | The delights of His
love, Until all on the altar we lay | For the favour
He shows | And the joy He bestows | Are for them
who will trust and obey.
5 Then in fellowship sweet | We will sit at His
feet, Or we’ll walk by His side in the way | What
He says we will do | Where He sends we will go |
Never fear, only trust and obey.

head of Thine | While as a penitent I stand | And

and none of Thee!’
2 Yet He found me ; I beheld Him | Bleeding on

Father’ | And my wistful heart said faintly | ‘Some
of self and some of Thee!’

Brought me lower, while I whispered | ‘Less of self

The silence of eternity | Interpreted by love!

call, 1 As noiseless let Thy blessing fall, I As fell
Thy manna down.
4 Drop Thy still dews of quietness, J Till all our
strivings cease: 1 Take from our souls the strain and
stress; 1 And let our ordered lives confess | The
beauty of Thy peace.

coolness and Thy balm; | Let sense be dumb —let
flesh retire; | Speak through the earthquake, wind,

2 Constantly working, I will not delay; working
for Thee, | Keeping my trust through the whole of
each day, always and only for Thee.
3 Faithfully working, my life’s purpose claimed,
wholly for Thee, | That of my work I may not be
ashamed, when I am summoned to Thee.
Lascelles, 127. T.B.
il GO up, go up, my heart, | Dwell with thy Lord

Nor here bestow thy love!
2 Go up, go up, my heart, | Be not a trifler here, |
Ascend above earth’s pressing clouds, | Five in a
higher sphere!
3 Let not thy love flow out | To things earth-
soiled and dim, | Set thy affection on thy Lord, |
Give all thy love to Him.
4 Go up, go up, my heart, | Fix all thy hopes in
Heaven. | To him who’d flee self-clinging thought, |
The eagle wings are given.
L*% I COME to the garden alone | While the dew is
still on the roses, [ And the voice I hear, falling
on my ear | The Son of God discloses.
And He walks with me, and He talks with me |
And He tells me I am His own; And the joy we
share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.
2 He speaks, and the sound of His voice, Is so
sweet the birds hush their singing; And the melody
that He gave to me | Within my heart is ringing.


3 I’d stay in the garden with Him, Though the
night around me be falling [ But He bids me go:
through the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.
Accrington, 35.
g I DARED not hope that Thou woiddst come |
To make this heart of mine Thy home, | Yet
Thou art here to help and bless | To ease the burden

2 I dared not hope for such a Guide | To walk
with me, my days beside; | Yet Thou art at my
hand, to be | A Counsellor and Strength to me.
3 Hold me when falling, when I stray ) Constrain
me back to wisdom’s way. 1 Do not, I pray, though
grieved, depart, | But guard with peace, Thy throne,
my heart.
St. Michael, 125. T.B.
MI WAIT for Thee oh Lord | Thy glorious face to
see, | The Holy Face that once was marred, |
And marred, oh Ford, for me!
2 I wait for Thee oh Lord! | Thy loving Hand
to feel, | Whose tender touch can even now, | My
wounded spirit heal.
3 I wait for Thee oh Lord! | Thy rapture deep
to know: | Of living evermore with Thee | Love can-
not more bestow.
4 I wait for Thee oh Lord— | Yet for a little
while: 1 This hour my longing eyes shall meet | Thy
soul reviving smile!

# C LORD for Thy searching here we call, |At Thy

Chorus:
Wonderful light ! | Wonderful light! | Jesus is
sending His wonderful, wonderful light.


2 Under His light so pure and strong, [ Stains
are seen and motives wrong; | Faidts in ourselves
we soon condone, | Now as God sees them all are
shown, | Now as God sees them all are shown.
3 Not to condemn and leave me so, | Jesus sends
the light I know; | Light and love His Word is sure, |
Jesus is here to make me pure, | Jesus is here to
make me pure.
4 Wonderful love, it melts my heart, | Helps me
now with all to part; | What can I keep, dear Lord,
from Thee | When Thou didst give Thy life for me? |
When Thou didst give Thy life for me?
Diademata, 139
# # MAKE me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be
free; | Force me to render up my sword, and I
shall conq’ror be; | I sink in life’s alarms when by
myself I stand; | Imprison me within Thine arms,
and strong shall be my hand.
2 My heart is weak and poor until it Master find;
It has no spring: of action sure—it varies with the
wind; | It cannot freely move till Thou hast wrought
its chain;. [ Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and
deathless it shall reign.
3 My power is faint and low till I have learned to
serve; 1 It wants the needed fire to glow, it wants the
breeze to nerve; | It cannot drive the world until
itself be driven; | Its flag can only be unfurl’d when
Thou shalt breathe from Heav’n.
4 My will is not my own till Thou hast made it
Thine; | If it would reach a monarch’s throne it
must its crown resign; | It only stands unbent amid
the clashing strife | When on Thy bosom it has
leant, and found in Thee its life.
NEARER, still nearer, close to Thy heart, (
Draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art; |
Fold me, oh, fold me, close to Thy breast, | Shelter
me safe in that “Haven of Rest.”


2 Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring, | Naught
as an off’ring to Jesus my King; | Only my sinful,
now contrite heart, | Grant me the cleansing Thy
Blood doth impart.
3 Nearer, still nearer, Lord to be Thine, | Sin,
with its follies, I gladly resign; | All of its pleasures,
pomp and its pride, [ Give me but JESUS, my Lord
crucified.
4 Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last, | Till
all its struggles and trials are past; | Then thro’
Eternity, ever I’ll be | Nearer, my Saviour, still
nearer to Thee.
Aurelia, 189. T.B.
Mft O LORD of life and glory | Our lips we give
to Thee | To tell the wondrous story, How cap-
tives may be free | The ringing of our voices | Shall
round the world proclaim; Thy love our heart re-
joices | And brings its richest gain.
2 O Lord of life and glory | To Thee our hearts
we bring [ That they may know the feelings | That
Thy great heart did wring; May feel the wants and
sorrows | That follow after sin | And all the dark
to-morrows | That sinners surely win.
3 O Lord of life and glory | To Thee our sight
we give | To see the frightful niis’ry, In which the
hopeless live | To see the shadows falling | Around
the young and old, Until the sight appalling | Makes
bravery more bold.
4 O Lord of life and glory | Have we not ears to
hear | The sounds that rise before Thee | To mock
Thy love and tears? | Do we not hear the crying |
For help from hearts and homes | And can we sit
denying | The help our Saviour owns?
MO LOVE that wilt not let me go, | I rest my
weary soul in Thee; J I give Thee back the life
I owe, ( That in Thine ocean depths its flow | May
richer, fuller be.


2 O Light that followest all my way, | I yield my
flickering torch to Thee; | My heart restores its bor-
rowed ray, | That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day |
May brighter, fairer be.
3 O Joy that seekest me through pain, | I cannot
close my heart to thee; | I trace the rainbow through
the rain, | And feel the promise is not vain | That
morn shall tearless be.
4 O Cross that liftest up my head, | I dare not
ask to fly from thee; | I lay in dust life’s glory dead, |
And from the ground there blossoms red | Life that
shall endless be.
Silver Hill, 37. T.B.
7 A O TOUCH my eyes that I may see |in cloudless
" ” vision Thy dear face, | And in that calm ser-
enity | with patience run my glorious race.
2 O loose my tongue that I may tell | With burning
words to sinners lost | That Thou didst come to seek
and save, to rescue them at such a cost.
3 Unstop my ears that I may hear | The Softest
whisper of Thy love, | To draw my heart from
earthly things, and fix it on Thyself above.
4 Release my feet, that I may run | The way of
Holiness Divine, | Held by Thy Hand I cannot fail, |
filled with Thy life, I’ll brightly shine.
Beethoven, 11. T.B.

guiding fire, | Unite my will to Thee again.
2 Self sense and reason all may scorn | The hid-
den way that leads on high, | Still, be my deepest
wish unborn | If but the power of nature die.
3 For Thou dost make the bitter sweet, | And
all is well when it is done. | Unless Thy will doth
hallow it, | The joy of all my work is gone.
4 Oh, Spirit of a little child ( Of will bereft, un-
troubled, pure, | I see thy glory undefiled, | Lord—
take my will—thy love is sure!

In the day that tries by fire!
2 Have I worked for hireling wages, | Or as one
with vows to keep? | With a heart whose love en-
gages | Life or death, to save the sheep? | All is
known to Thee, my Master, | All is known, and that
is why | I can work, and wait the verdict | Of Thy
kind but searching eye.
3 I must love Thee; love must ride me, | Spring-
ing up, and flowing forth | From a childlike heart
within me, | Or my work is nothing worth. | Love
with passion, and with patience, | Love with prin-
ciples and fire, [ Love with heart, and mind, and
utterance | Serving Christ my one desire.
Haere Ra (Maori.)
SEARCH me, O God; | And know my heart
/ & to-day; 1 Try me, O Lord, [ And know my
thoughts, I pray: | See if there be [ Some wicked
way in me: | Cleanse me from every sin | And set
me free.
2 I praise Thee, Lord, | For cleansing me from
sin: | Fulfil Thy word, | And make me pure within; |
Fill me with fire | Where once I burned with shame: |
Grant my desire | To magnify Thy name.
3 Ford, take my life, | And make it wholly
Thine: | Fill my poor heart ) With Thy great love
Divine: | Take all my will, | My passion, self and
pride: | I now surrender: | Lord, in me abide.


4 O Holy Ghost, | Revival comes from Thee: |
Send a revival— | Start the work In me: | Thy word
declares ( Thou wilt supply our need: | For blessing
now, O Lord, | I humbly plead.
TfA WE may not climb the heavenly steeps 1 To
* ■ bring the Lord Christ down: | In vain we search
the lowest deeps, | For Him no depths can drown.
2 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet | A present
help is He; | And faith has still its Olivet, | And
love its Galilee.
S The healing of His seamless dress | Is by our
beds of pain; | We touch Him in life’s throng and
press, | And we are whole again.
4 Through Him the first fond prayers are said (
Our lips of childhood frame, | The last low whispers
of our dead | Are burdened with His Name.
5 O Lord and Master of us all; | Whate’er our
name or sign, | We own Thy sway, we hear Thy
call, | We test our lives by Thine.
At Thy feet I fall, 395. T.B
yp WHEN shall I come unto the healing waters ? |
Lifting my heart I cry to Thee my prayer, j
Spirit of peace, my Comforter and Healer, | In Whom
my springs are found, let my soul meet Thee there.
Chorus:
From a hill I know, | Healing waters flow; | O rise,
Emmanuel’s tide, | And my soul overflow!
2 Wash from my hands the dust of earthly striv-
ing. | Take from my mind the stress of secret fear. |
Cleanse Thou the wounds from all but Thee far
hidden, | And when the waters flow let my healing
appear.
8 Light, life, and love are in that healing foun-
tain, | All I require to cleanse me and restore; |
Flow through my soul, redeem its desert places, |
And make a garden there for the Lord I adore.
