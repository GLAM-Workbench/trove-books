AUTHOR'S PREFACE.
'T'HIS small collection of verses is based upon the belief
that poetry appeals to, exercises, and strengthens the
best feelings of [the human heart. Indeed, poetry may be
defined as the fit expression of fit emotion. This does not
preclude its being intensely intellectual, as the noblest
emotion follows on and is a result of the profoundest thought,
and there is no right emotion that does not arise from a
truthful view of things. To be a poet a man must see
clearly, as well as feel deeply ; and be able to express his
feelings in such a way that kindred emotions rise in the
hearts of others. Imagination —as distinguished from
fancy —is an essential characteristic of poetry, and imagi-
nation, after all, is nothing but an insight into the truth
which no man k nou} s fuMy> some far less
imperfectly than others. A man should not only learn
all of the truth that he can, but feel its beauty; whilst, on
the other hand, feeling based on ignorance is either feeble
or dangerous.
These poems and plays, though simple in language
and thought, are composed chiefly to illustrate and interpret
successive phases and experiences during the maxima of
my youth.
Being a teacher, I have endeavoured to choose items
suitable for children and of interest to both juveniles and
adults.
In placing this little volume before the public, I trust
it may be well appreciated; and if there happen to be
a fair demand for it I shall be encouraged to issue a
second enlarged edition.

Mother's beart: your place of Refuge.
“ The star of the uuconquered will,
He rises in my breast.
Serene and resolute and still,
And calm and self-possessed.”
LONGFELLOW.
Give to the morn of life its natural blessedness,
When mother rocked you in the cradle to and fro;
Rejoice young man or woman in thy youth, and restless
Walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of
thine eyes, and bow
To mother’s boundless love and sorrow
In your most valuable time of life —
Remember God will bring upon thee judgment
And punish thee according to thy vice.
Your sunny days of youth are o’er,
Your golden times of childhood passed !
Your mother’s true and loving heart adore—
The place of refuge for you in the past.
Give unto her your greatest care,
And serve her with great sacrifice;
For you she pleaded, prayed, despaired,
To render you with true advise.


Unthankful children are like smut
Appearing on a healthy grain:
Their deeds are fruitless, thoughts unheeded,
Their path of life seems but one pain.
In common worldly things ’tis called ungrateful
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt;
Could you commit a bigger crime to be unthankful
To mother, who for you many a tear has shed ?
Behold your conscience ! By true repentence
From degradation turn.
Fulfil her wish, come to her heart untainted,
The blessings of her parting days to earn.
Happy the man that has thus parted
From mother’s bedside, where she weak and dim
Gave him her blessed consolation,
That struck the chord of her heart’s desires within
Mother’s light and father’s guide
Are the best you ever espied.
In solemn and in joyful hours of life
Your mother’s counsel is the best advice.
Fear God and do the riglit,
Branch not off the path of youth ;
Trust for counsel and for guide
Him, the light, the life, the truth.


Eternal Life.
Eternal change is eternal life —
The old must die, the new arise.
With the greeting of Spring we fully know
That to create life—the sower must sow.
We lead with joy the infant to light,
Though knowing it cannot remain on this earth;
And we bury the old at eventide
Who once loved the little ones round the hearth.
The flowers that bloomed must wither away,
No matter where their abode may be;
Out of the ruins of life’s past days
Rises the germ from which grows the tree.


The Night.
Without song and without lyre
Comes the night with its heavenly fire,
And covers up the world with its veil,
Not missing an atom, a mount, or a dale.
She slowly breaks in with the close of day
And rocks us to the sweet far, far-away;
Strength that we, lost on the day before,
In our rest she is glad to restore.
Without song and without lyre,
Day -forces night for some time to retire;
While morning slowly removes the black veil
And refreshens the life that from darkness grew pale.


Love.
Hidden in the deepest depth of heart
Blooms a flower, tender and mild;
Love is its name, it will never part
From either man, woman, or child.
Wherever she scents and wherever she beams,
Maybe in palace, cottage, or hut,
That’s where heaven on earth it seems,
And the door for God’s angel is never shut.


The Soldier's farewell.
Duty calls and the bugle sounds
Rally, to the men of the Empire !
To fight for freedom and safety of bounds.
For the welfare of the layman and sire.
Weeping mothers and sisters depart
From their sons and brothers, the heroes,
And with sobs and cries and bleeding hearts
They cling to them in their sorrows.
“ Fall in ye braves and mothers depart.
For your comitry’s sake leave your treasures."
They kiss them farewell and bid them God's speed.
And abide to the strict martial measure.
They stand in line with their - knapsacks at hand,
And solemnly wait for a motion:
The bugle sounds, and man behind man
Mount the beautiful swan of the ocean.
“Aye, ready!" the captain shouts from the bridge;
“Let go aft, and full steam ahead!"
Spectators and relatives watch from the ridge
The floating liner’s crowded deck.
Majestically moves the boat outward bound,
The band plays “The Soldier’s Farewell";
How can I bear to leave the sounds
Till the rolling waves of the ocean swell f


They sweep through the deep as ocean warriors,
The Meteor flag guards our native seas ;
They fight with might and for right as victors,
And return with the glorious star of peace.
Fame to the men who have thus parted !
Honour to the mothers of true British souls!
Glory to those that fell in the battles !
Courage to the heroes now matching the foes f
May God protect them and be their Guide
In their battle-cry for freedom,
And their noble fight for right!
Let none forget! how vast the debt
We owe to those that died.


The Soldier's Return.
Hark! Listen to the trumpeters,
They sound the call of peace,
The fiery fight is heard no more,
Each noble heart may ease.
No battles raging loud and long,
No stormy winds do blow.
Come sing the glorious day’s renown,
Our song and feast shall flow.
Sound, sound your clarion voices high.
Rejoice in one accord.
Now thank we all our Heavenly Guide:
Praise Him, O praise the Lord !
The bells ring o’er the festal city
Greetings from our noble King,
Tidings from our gallant Army,
News of triumph gladly bring.
The bugle’s note and cannon’s roar,
The belfry’s silence break,
And hurrying feet rush to the shore
To welcome heroes great.
Through the mist that floats before us,
Faintly sounds the “Home, Sweet Home,”
Like a voice from those who love us,
Breathing fondly o’er the foam.


The boat draws in, fond hearts beat loud,
For sons and mothers meet;
With joyful tears the soldiers shout
And happy lovers greet.
Now to the cheery sound of drums
The crowned victors march.
With unfurled banners forth they come
And pass through Triumph’s arch.
Hail to thee, thou glorious nation,
Land of honour, blest and free!
Hail to thee, beloved homeland,
Peace within and peace with thee!


Australia Evermore.
Unfurl the flag of Liberty
And proudly let it wave,
Ye loyal hearts of freedom,
Ye noble and ye brave !
Let foemen tremble at the sight,
That dare invade our shore,
And be your war-cry Liberty:
Australia evermore !
We love our Southern island,
Where peace and joy abide;
O’er meadows and green pastures
Peep homesteads far and wide.
Here Nature smiles in charmful glee
Amidst the wattle bloom;
Come from the jaded lands to us,
Come from the sullen gloom.
Australia, the beautiful,
The sunny, and the fair,
The land of health and beauty —
Naught can with thee compare!
Australia ! Land of lonely lake
And serpent-haunted fen;
Land of the torrent and the fire
And forest-sundered men !


Then toast with me our happy land,
Where all that’s fair prevails;
Our colour’s blue and our hearts are true
In this sunny Southern laud!
Ah ! my heart goes with the river,
Where I scent the old gum-leaves,
Where I hear the parrots screaming
High above me in the trees.
The crimson sun is sinking,
The peaceful night draws nigh,
With glorious moonlight spreading
O’er bush and sea and sky.
Beneath the flag of Liberty,
. Long may thy sons be seen,
A credit to their country
And honour to their Khig !
Australia Evermore !


Sunshine.
It is not always sunshine
In this pleasant world of ours;
There are times when hopes they vanish
Like dew in sunny hours.
We would miss half of life’s pleasure
If the skies were always fair;
In this world we all have trouble,
Everyone they have a share.
How we love the merry sunshine
After days of heavy rain;
So life to us seems sweeter
After days of toil and pair.
The black clouds always vanish
That float along the sky—
So cheer up, downcast brother,
’Twill be better by-and-bye.
Oh ! Hope, sweet Hope ! Without thee
Where would we mortals be ?
Our lives would be a burden,
Eternal misery.
So let us hope for ever
To do the best we can,
And then when troubles meet us
To face them like a man.


Dawn.
Awake! for the dawn is breaking
Over the forest so green,
The birds are singing so sweetly.
Not a cloud in the sky is seen;
Now the sun is kissing the hilltops
With a flood of golden light,
And dewdrops sparkle and glitter
Like diamonds clear and bright.
All Nature’s face is smiling,
And fresh is the morning air,
The flowers with beauty unfolding
To grace the scene so fair;
For it fills the heart with gladnes?
To gaze on such a scene,
When the dawn of morn is breaking
Over the forest so green.


Liberty.
Oh! the thousands who have perished
In the cause of Liberty !
Still within our hearts we cherish
Names that shall immortal be.
Like the sand upon the sea shore
They have strewn the battle-plain;
In the glorious cause of freedom
Tens of thousands have been slain.
But their deeds are not forgotten,
Tho’ the years have rolled away.
They have left behind a lesson
For the heroes of to-day.
Oh ! the thousands who have perished
In the cause of Liberty !
Still within our hearts we cherish
Names that will immortal be.


Douth.
In the springtime of life,
In youth’s bright morning fair,
Grow the buds for good or evil
That we in life will share;
’Tis the fruit of joy or sadness,
That time alone can bring,
These tiny buds that open
So early in the Spring.
Not checked, the buds will blossom
To bring us joy or pain,
The Summer sun will ripen them
Like wheat upon the plain;
’Till Autumn comes—the eve of life —
The fruits will then appear
To bring us joy or sadness
At the close of life’s career.


Sunset
Softly falls the light of day
O’er the hills and meadows gay,
While each golden-tinted ray
Glimmers in the west;
Slowly fading from our sight,
Visions clear of beauty bright,
Till the last faint streak of light
Softly fades away.
Now the silent orbs of night,
Beaming all with silver light,
Shine like diamonds, clear and bright,
O’er the sky so blue;
Smiling, Nature sinks to rest
With her flowers in beauty drest,
While bright tints far in the west
Softly fade away.


Beautiful flowers.
Beautiful flowers, in beauty dressed,
Glimpses of heaven in thee doth rest;
Angels might look with smiling eyes
At the bright lustres from the skies.
Beautiful flowers, their fragrance shred
So sweetly o’er each tiny bed;
O ! what with their beauty can compare,
Blooming so bright, so fresh and fair ?
Beautiful flowers must shortly fade,
Soon like us in the dust be laid;
Far away beyond the tomb *
Beautiful flowers for ever bloom.


To One fallen in Battle.
For all your gladness gathered to the night,
Friend of mine:
For all brave flowers of comradeship now dead
Beside the high-road bare we two did tread,
Friend of mine :
For other grief that burns too deep for song,
For other eyes now emptied of your light,
For all the days that will not right this wrong —
My heart, my heart is sad,
Friend of mine.
Because men held your name in loyalty,
Friend of mine;
Because your laughter was black terror’s lord,
And fortitude your own well-trusted sword,
Friend of mine;
Because your arm was raised for holy things
When Death struck swift and crowned you bitterly
With Honour, and dipped his dim saluting wings—
My heart, my heart is glad,
Friend of mine.


foreet Birds.
Birds of the forest fly home to their nest,
When the bright sun sinks low in the west.
Quitting the fields at closing of day.
Singing “Good-night” as they flit on their way.
When the first tints of morning appear,
Ready to greet it they pour forth their cheer;
Then through the wild woods their notes sweetly ring.
All join in chorus and sweetly they sing.
Sing on for ever, sweet heralds of day,
Your songs are as welcome as flowers in May;
No music on earth can with them compare,
They tell not of sadness, of sorrow, or care.


The Lighthouse.
There’s a beacon bright that sheds its light
Far over the deep-blue sea,
When the sky o’erhead is as black as lead,
And waves roar angrily.
The sailors know, as they come and go,
There’s danger near at hand,
So a watch they keep, as they sail o’er the deep,
Till safe they arrive at land.
So if we would steer our vessel clear
From the rocks o’er life’s stormy , sea,
There are beacons bright that shed their light
To the shores of eternity.
But we must obey or we’ll go astray,
And a sharp look-out must keep
For each beacon light that is shining bright
Far o’er life’s billows deep.


Bluebell.
There’s a tiny little flower in the summer we may see.
In its beauty blooming fresh and bright alone,
Beside the dusty .roadway or on the barren plain—
’Tis a tiny little flower we call our own.
You may see them every day if through the fields you
stray,
They always look so fresh and bright and fair;
All in a little band they grow throughout our land,
Without the slightest aid of human care.
They raise their tiny heads to heaven, where they are
fed; •
In plain and simple dress they all appear.
And 0 ! it seems to me like this flower we ought to be^—
We each may shine though in a humble sphere.
Then let us look above to One that’s full of love,
Who sends us all the good things that we need;
And let our dress be neat, no matter whom we meet,
Like this tiny little sweet bluebell.


The Magpie.
Wonderful bird of melody,
Australia may be proud of thee,
Sweet warbler of the wood;
The ranges echo with thy glee
Each smiling morn, so wild and free,
Beautiful bird of song.
Of other birds thou art the king;
Rich plumage cannot make them sing
None half so good as thee.
Then sing, sweet warbler, again;
I love to hear thy tuneful strain
High on the old gum tree.


Rain.
Heavenly music is the rain
To the thirsty hill and plain,
So refreshing to the birds and beasts and flowers;
How it swells and how it rings
In the rivers and the springs;
’Tis the sweetest strains of music man can hear.
Heavenly music from above,
’Tis the music that I love:
It brings the dying back to life again.
To rich and poor it’s free.
This heavenly melody:
The gift of One that ruleth up above.


All that we prise.
All that we prize on earth around us perish,
Friends that we love soon vanish from our sight;
Memory alone our dearest idols cherish,
To bring them back in visions clear and bright.
Those only feel the grief that lose the treasure,
When from their dearest friends they have to part;
Words are but weak, however sweet their measure,
To heal the wounds that ache within the heart.


Australia for Ever.
“Australia for ever,” my song it shall be,
Where blooms in its beauty the stately gum tree,
Thy green hills and meadows I love for to roam,
For the pride of the earth is my bright Southern home.
I love thee, my country, sweet land of the free,
For health, wealth, and beauty and sweet liberty;
Thy sons and thy daughters are comely and fair,
And peace, crowned with plenty, is found everywhere.
Australia, my country, thy praise I will sing,
And through thy green valleys my voice it shall ring.
Till hill, plain, and valley shall take up the strain,
And “Australia for ever” shall echo again.
Then sing, all ye wild birds, aloud in your glee,
Sing, magpie, kingfisher, blue mountain with me;
Come wagtail and plover, bell-bird and curlew,
“Australia for ever,” screech white cockatoo.


Pills.
Pearl-coated anti-bilious pills
Will cure the very worst of ills;
For sick headache and heart disease
They give the patient quiet ease.
Now when you feel your pulse beat slow,
Give anti-bilious pills a show;
From cramp and pain they give relief,
Dyspepsia, too, will come to grief.
If taken in the proper style,
Will cure you of that horrid bile.
O ! when the fever makes you shout,
For anti-bilious pills cry out.
A costive man will find relief,
For they go through him like a thief;
Indigestion from its track will fly,
If anti-bilious pills you buy.
No more our fate we need deplore,
For they are kept in every store;
A sovereign balm for every ill,
This magic anti-bilious pill.
When life to me seems dark and drear,
And pain runs through my system queer,
’Tis then I fly, sweet pill, to thee,
To aid me in my misery.
And long may the Muses sing
The victories of this magic king,
Through nation wide, from pole to pole,
May anti-bilious pills be sold.

In her I found delight;
Whate’er should be my fortune,
Like her—l could not find another.
This Book is all that’s left me,
Tears will unbidden start,
With faltering lip and throbbing brow
I press it to my heart.


Her angel face, I see it yet—
What thronging memories come—
Again that little group has met
Within the halls of home.
Thou truest Friend man ever knew,
Thy constancy I’ve tried;
When all were false I found Thee true,
My Counsellor and Guide.
The mines of earth no treasures give
From me this Book could buy,
For teaching me the way to live
And now the way to die.
Come, clench my band, good sister!
Sing me my favourite hymn.
For my heart is burning within me
And my eyes are growing dim.
Come, strike the note:
“Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.”

What is that sudden boom of guns?
What message does it bring?
What ! Is it victory for our sons—
Freedom and Liberty !
Hurrah ! for good old Britain,
I hear the voices ring,
True to their own dear country,
And loyal to their King.
Thank God! I’ve done my duty
Amidst the roaring fire,
My fate it was for liberty,
With God for King and Empire.

SCENE I.
Drawing-room.
Keith studying. Knock at door.
Enter Sturt.
Sturt :
Good afternoon, Keith. What, hard at work, you
old stewpot! Come, put those books away and join in
a game of tennis. Kitty and Ivy have gone ahead to
the court and will be waiting for us there.
Keith :
You are a public nuisance in a man’s private
quarters. Sturt, you know I detest being disturbed at
study. Go ahead, I shall come later on.
Sturt:—
Go on with you, Keith ! There’s no time like the
present. Put those books away. You have ample time
for study to-night. Surely, you would not disappoint
our worthy friends that are anxiously waiting for a
game of tennis. Be a sport and play the game!
Enter Mrs. Jones (mother of Keith).
Sturt:—
Good afternoon, Mrs. Jones. I have just invited
Keith to come along and join in a game of tennis.
He is over-working himself with constant study, and
is bound to feel the ill-effects sooner or later.


Mrs. Jones:
Yes, Sturt, a little fresh air and sport will do him
good. Come along, Keith, it is to your own benefit to
put away those hooks until you return from tennis.
I’ll get your racquet.
Keith :
Right you are! Here she goes! It’s two to one,
and as majority counts I’m off. Tooroo!
Boys exit. Mrs. Jones sitting down to sew. Enters Miss
Sylvia Jones, sister to Keith and School of Mines
Student.
Sylvia :
Good evening, mother dear !
Mrs. Jones:
Good evening, Sylvia. Home so early?
Sylvia:—
Yes, dear. I managed to catch the early express.
Where is Keith?
Mrs. Jones:
He has gone out with Sturt for a game of tennis.
Sylvia :
I am so glad of that. He needs more recreation.
I think he is over-taxing himself in the preparation
for his next exam. It’s beginning to tell on him.
Mrs. Jones:
You had better practise your music. Remember, it
is your turn to play in church next Sunday.
Sylvia :
Yes, and the Rev. Sexton has selected my favourite
hymn. This is it.
Sylvia plays and sings “The Broken Heart.”
Enter Keith and Sturt, returning from tennis.
Sturt;—
Good evening, Sylvia. Did I hear you singing
“The Broken Heart”? Please repeat it. The melody
is grand and the words are true. Yes, the Lord gave
His Only-begotten Son for you and for me, to save the
heavenly kingdom, and I often wonder bow many
parents would willingly sacrifice a son for the safety
and freedom of our British Empire.
C®me, let us all sing that beautiful hymn together.
“The Broken Heart.”
CURTAIN.


SCENE 11.
Drawing-room.
Keith studying. Sturt introducing first news of war.
“Hurrah” cheers from behind the scene.
Enter Sturt, very excited.
Sturt:—
Keith, do you know the latest? Martial law is
proclaimed throughout the British Empire. Germany
and Austria are the foes.
Keith :
War ! I cannot believe it!
Sturt :
It is a fact. Official announcement to that effect
has been made by the military authorities, and special
messages from the King are being published at the
G.P.O. Come and see for yourself.
Boys exit.
Mrs. Jones enters.
Mrs. Jones:
War declared in the midst of peace and civilization.
Sylvia enters.
Sylvia :
Mother, have you heard the news of war?
Mrs. Jones:
Yes, dear. God bless our splendid nation !
Sylvia :
War ! I tremble at the thought of it. What will
become of Keith and Sturt? Will they have to go?
Mrs. Jones:
Undoubtedly—if there is any truth in the telegram
published at the G.P.O.
Sylvia :
Come, let us go to the military headquarters and
find out the strength of those messages. I simply can-
not rest until the truth is known to me. Let us go
and see.
Mrs. Jones:
Yes, we might meet the boys on their way home.
They will possibly have some later news.
Exit Mrs. Jones and Sylvia to proceed to military
headquarters.
Enter Keith and Sturt.


Keith (to Sturt):
Sit down, Sturt. Mother and Sylvia are very
much concerned over the latest publications, which are
demanding all eligible young men to enlist. What will
become of our studies?
Sturt:—
We are British sons of British Liberty. Our duty
is to serve our King and Country.
Keith :
Sturt, it is hard to leave my poor old widowed
mother and good Sylvia. How I could bear to leave
them I don’t know. But as you said, we, as Britishers,
enjoying the full privileges of the British Empire, must
do justice to British honour and protect the British
flag.
Enter Mrs. Jones and Sylvia.
Keith :
Well, did you see the latest telegram?
Sylvia ;
Yes, they are mobilizing the troops, and the call
for young men has been announced. Surely, bovs. you
would not leave us?
Mrs. Jones sits down, crying, broken up.
Sturt (in a sympathetic but firm. manner ): —
Grieve not, Mrs. Jones and Sylvia. Remember,
the Lord gave His Only-begotten Son for the redemp-
tion of the world, and as for Keith and I, we have
just considered our position as sons of true British
mothers and the British Empire. The safety of our
country depends on us, and we feel it our duty to
enlist to do our share for the welfare of our honoured
nation, blest and free.
Exit Mrs. Jones and Sylvia, broken up.
Keith and Sturt sit down, thinking over the outcome of
their intentions.
The Bugle sounds the call to arms from behind the scene.
Sturt (rising ): —
I cannot bear to hesitate. Come, let us answer to
the call.
Keith :
Behold, my conscience, I must go !
Exit both to enlist.
Enter Red Cross Nurse singing, with piano accompani-
ment:—
“Your King and Country Need You.”
CURTAIN.


SCENE 111.
Drawing-room.
Mbs. Jones sewing. Sylvia playing (piano) National
Anthems of Allies.
Sylvia :
It is nearly eight, and the boys have not arrived
yet. I wonder what has happened !
Knock at door. Boys enter,
Keith :
We are here and Australia will be there. It has
been officially announced that Turkey has also joined our
foes and we are to sail within twenty-four hours. This
is our last night on leave, and we have come to bid
farewell.
Mes. Jones:
You don’t mean it, my boy?
Sylvia :
I can’t possibly believe your words, Keith !
Keith ;
Could you disbelieve a British heart in British uniform?
Stvet:—
It is a fact. Your brother’s words are true. Duty
calls, we must obey.
Mbs. Jones:
Then take a seat and tell us of your new sphere
of life.
Keith ;
My new sphere of life !
Well, mother dear, I miss my home, my books,
my study, and most of all your care and Sylvia’s com-
panionship. Our sacrifices are very great, but yet
greater is yours.
We are going to fight for you and our King and
country. I am glad to be a citizen of our grand
British Empire, but patriotism is a matter of deeds
not words.
We are going forth to uphold those splendid
principles of our forefathers and to fight for Freedom,
Liberty, and above all for Righteousness, and that alone
exalteth a nation.
Remember:
“Not once or twice in our fair island story,
The path of duty was the way to glory.”
Our future is unknown, but the Empire will never
fail if we unitedly follow the footsteps of those who
have set us such a noble example.


Sturt :
We love our King and Country, and for her we
are going to fight.
Aye, she is a rich and a rare land !
O, she is a fresh and fair land,
She is a dear and rare land,
This native land of mine !
No men than her’s are braver,
Her women’s hearts ne’er waver,
I’d freely die to save her,
And think my lot divine !
Keith :
And Australia will be there.
“For Auld Lang Syne.”
All sing: “Australia Will be There.”
Sturt:— "
The hour is drawing nigh. We must depart to
return to camp by ten.
Keith :
Well, mother dear and Sylvia, we must proceed; we
can no longer stay. To leave you it is hard, but duty
calls, and strict obedience is the first law of a soldier.
May God protect you ! Pray for us, and grow in pride
of family, race, and Empire. You have given your
best, but it is not too much to give for what we are
going to fight—Justice, Liberty, and Right!
Sturt:—
Song, “We’ll Never Let the Old Flag Fall.”
All join in the song.

ShTLViA:
Mother, dear, listen! I had a dream last night
and a vision I shall never forget. I dreamt Keith
was wounded on the battlefield.
I was a Red Cross Nurse, and appointed to the
same hospital where he had been sent. His condition
was very low when brought in to the base. It was
night, and in his sleep he called for me. I went and
grasped his hand, when he awoke, and behold, by
careful attention I saved his life.
Knock at the door.
Messenger brings cable sent by boys.
Sylvia (receiving same and reading it): —
Mother, a cable from the boys. Just listen:
“Landed safely. Egypt. Camped in the shade of the
Pyramids.”
Mrs. Jones:
May God protect them in their new career !
Sylvia : *
Yes, mother dear, and I believe my dream to be
a call for me. Nurses are wanted and I feel it my
duty to go.
Mrs. Jones:
And what will become of me, dear? Keith has
gone, and if I lose you “Whom shall I depend on?”
Sylvia:—
Grieve not, mother, dear. God will guide and in
Providence we must abide.
Knock at the door.
Messenger delivers telegram. Mrs. Jones receives same.
Mrs. Jones is asked to accept the position of Superin-
tendent of the Bed Cross Supply Organization.
Mrs. Jones (to Sylvia):
I am asked to accept the position of Superintendent
of the Red Cioss Supply Organization.

Did I not say? There is a proof! You are
provided for. My dream is true !
Gome, do not hesitate ! Let’s answer to the call.

Bandaged arm or leg and head. Take seats in front of tent.
Sturt (to Keith) :
Well, Keith. Our fate is a common fate—we are
here, though not helpless, injured and disabled and
unable to return to the front. Sergeant Smith has told
me this morning that we are to return to our native
land by the next hospital ship.


Keith :
0, may your words come true. I have not heard
from Sylvia since we left Egypt. I wonder what has
become of her?
Enter Nurse, with refreshments.
Keith ( to Nurse) :
Just listen, noble Nurse. It is nearly twelve
months since we left Egypt for Gallipoli. My sister,
Sylvia Jones., is o/ie of the Red Cross band, and I
have not heard from her since our departure from the
base at Cairo. Could you tell me where she might be?
Nurse :
Surely not Sylvia Jones, of the Adelaide School of
Mines?
Keith *
Yes, yes ! That’s her !
Nurse :
She is here as sister in charge of this base, and
if you wish I’ll go and find her.
Sturt :
I cannot believe my ears, Keith ! Could it be
possible for us to meet Sylvia here? Nay, hardly!
Enter Nurse Higgs and Sister Jones.
Sister Jones:— ,
Is it possible ! My brother Keith and Sturt, his
mate! Say, boys, when did you enter here?
Sturt:—
We were brought in here this morning, wounded
and disabled for active service. We are to return to
Australia by the next hospital ship.
Sylvia :
And so am I; my time is up. So we shall all
return together.
So be still, sad heart, and cease repining,
Beyond the siars is the sun still shining;
Thy fate is the common fate of all,
Into each life some rain must fall,
And the very law which moulds a tear
And bids it trickle from its source
That law preserves the earth a sphere
And guides the planets in their course !
Keith :
And how is my darling mother, Sylvia?
Sylvia:—
All is well. God bless her till we meet again !
