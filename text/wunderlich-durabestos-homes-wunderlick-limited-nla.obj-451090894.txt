Wunderlich Durabestos is the most convenient, economical, and effective building sheeting
available to-day for lining the exterior walls, gables and interior walls, ceilings and partitions of
all timber-framed buildings.
It is made in broad, rigid sheets in stock sizes ranging from lengths of 3' to 12' by widths of
4', 32' and l'6". It can be handled, cut and fixed even more quickly than timber linings.
In addition, Durabestos is tough and weather-resisting. It is of a pleasing grey-white that
does not require painting unless colourful treatment is desired.
WUNDERLICH Durabestos Products are obtainable from leading storekeepers, builders' sup-
pliers and timber merchants throughout Australia and New Zealand.

HOMES
To the many home-lovers who are desirous of
owning an inexpensive yet attractive home, this
booklet will prove of great interest and assist-
ance. Its object is to portray the freedom with
which Wunderlich Durabestos (Asbestos-Cement)
Products can be used when designing economical
and inviting timber-framed structures, and to
illustrate the modern effects obtainable when
the sheets and cover battens are applied
HORIZONTALLY.
WUNDERLICH DURABESTOS Flat Building
Sheeting is the most economical, convenient and
effective material available to-day for lining the
exterior walls and gables and the interior walls,
partitions and ceilings of timber-framed build-
ings. It has been successfully applied to thou-
sands of houses and buildings in both suburban
areas and country districts in Australia, and the
adjacent islands. Many of these homes have
been financed by easy term Government loans—
for Durabestos construction is accepted by the
authorities who make the grants available.
WUNDERLICH DURABESTOS is Australian
made and has for its constituents two pre-
eminently Indestructible materials ASBESTOS
FIBRE and PORTLAND CEMENT. During manu-
facture the cement-coated asbestos fibres are
interlaced and built up in laminations into a dense
sheet of the requisite thickness. The resultant
product possesses outstanding characteristics, for
it is weather, white-ant and vermin-proof, is fire-
resisting and thoroughly durable. In addition,
Wunderlich Durabestos Sheeting is easily
handled, sawn, nailed and fixed, thus reducing
labour costs of application to a minimum. The
smooth surface finish is of a pleasing grey-white
colour; painting is, therefore, unnecessary and
upkeep costs of a Durabestos structure are prac-
tically eliminated. However, Durabestos may be
painted, it desired, special instructions being
given on page 19.
Homebuilders who have in mind utmost attrac-
tiveness and permanence, combined with moder-
ate cost, should specify Wunderlich Durabestos,
for it is the building sheeting that will enable
them, most effectively, to carry out their scheme.
The designs furnished in this booklet are intended
as a guide to all; before they are adopted a local
architect should be consulted, for by amending
them to suit individual requirements and the
orientation of the building, money will be saved
and inconvenience obviated.
WUNDERLICH LIMITED cannot undertake the
preparation of plans and specifications or the
construction of Durabestos homes. This should be
entrusted to a recognised architect and a cap-
able builder.

FOR FARM BUILDINGS, POULTRY HOUSES,
DAIRIES.
Wunderlich Durabestos is a logical choice for
constructing all types of farm buildings. Its
fire-resisting and vermin-proof qualities make
it an indispensable lining to the exterior walls
of barns, wool sheds, feed houses, packing
sheds, shearers' huts, etc. Poultry farmers find
that it is ideal for building better class incu-
bator and brooder houses, for the sheets
possess definite insulating value. It is advisable
to line both the interior as well as the exterior
walls of these buildings with Durabestos. Be-
cause of its sanitary qualities it is preferred for
erecting laying sheds, intensive houses, etc.,
for the sheets can be washed down with a hose
each day without deterioration. This latter
attribute is of particular interest to dairy
farmers whose milking sheds and separator
houses must always be kept clean and free
from vermin.
Durabestos Farm Buildings are inexpensive to
construct; they do not require painting or main-
tenance, and will withstand all climatic con-
ditions. The use of No. 2 (nominal tV) Sheet-
ing is advocated for all farm building walls.

WUNDERLICH DURABESTOS Flat Sheets and Accessories
STOCK SIZES, THICKNESSES, WEIGHTS AND CODE WORDS.
WUNDERLICH DURABESTOS FLAT SHEETS.
Wunderlich Durabestos Flat Sheets are made from
Asbestos Fibre and Portland Cement. These two com-
ponents are thoroughly united by mixture and lamination
into a dense and rigid product, smoothly surfaced and as
hard as concrete. The finished sheet does not deteriorate
—it cannot flake, sag, crumble, rot, or corrode.
Durabestos Sheets are made in a wide variety of con-
venient waste-saving sheets and several thicknesses. Two
standard thicknesses are in daily use, viz.:—
, 3 6 ths of an inch—Termed No. 2
12 nds of an inch—Termed No. 1
No. 2 IS RECOMMENDED FOR EXTERIOR WALLS
AND GABLES. WHILST No. 1 IS GENERALLY USED
FOR CEILINGS. PARTITIONS AND INTERIOR WALLS.
NOTE: On account of an unavoidable but slight variation during
the process of manufacture, these thicknesses are referred
to as "nominal" or "approximate."
The Stock Sizes in each "nominal" thickness are as follows:
4' wide by 4,5, 6,7, 8, 9 and 10' long.
3'
** M li II n n n ii

For special purposes, No. 2 thickness is also made in
sheets 3' and 4' wide by I I' and 12' long.
THICK SHEETS.
Circumstances, at times, render it desirable to employ
Durabestos of greater thickness than standard sheets, so
several special thicknesses are made, viz.:—.
1" 5 " 3” i"
4 i TtT i S ' 2 •
As these thick sheets are used frequently for partitions,
they are manufactured with both faces smooth. The
thickness is available from stock at short notice, whilst
the other thicknesses are supplied in all stock sizes to
order.
WEIGHTS: The approximate weights of the various sheets
are shown below:—
CODE WORDS: Code words for telegraphing are also
shown below. Besides giving the code word, mention must
be made of the quantity required in each size.
WUNDERLICH DURABESTOS ACCESSORIES.
Wunderlich Durabestos Cover Mould, Angles, Skirtings,
Ventilators, etc., are made from Asbestos Fibre and Port-
land Cement. They provide a weather, vermin and dust-
proof, Ss well as a fire-resisting, method of covering the
joints of Durabestos Sheeting. They ensure simplicity of
fixing and low maintenance costs, for, unlike timber
battens, they cannot warp, curl, twist, rot or otherwise
deteriorate. The edges of the Cover Mould and Angles
are rounded, and the Skirting is bevelled, thus preventing
the accumulation of dust on the top members of the
accessories. See Sections on page 19.
Durabestos accessories are made in the following stock
sizes and lengths:—

THE METHOD OF FIXING DURABESTOS SHEETS AND ACCESSORIES
HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL Application.
DURABESTOS is easily applied to timber-framed construction
by a carpenter using the usual carpenter s tools.
SPACING OF STUDS TO SUIT DURABESTOS.
When planning a home, reference should be made to the
list of sizes shown on page 17 of this booklet, as utmost
economy will result if the timber framing to walls, ceilings,
partitions, etc., is designed to suit stock-sized sheets. Stock-
sized sheets are 4', 3', 2' and 16 wide, so studs or joists
should be spaced at either 2' or I'6" centres. To ensure a
flat surface, timber studs should be of even depth.
SUPPORT BEHIND JOINTS.
There must be support behind all joints. When fixing horizon-
tally it is necessary to let in timber cross (or nogging)
pieces between the studs where the joints occur.
CUTTING.
The variety of handy sized sheets available obviates to a
great extent the necessity of cutting. However, where cut-
ting is necessary, Durabestos, despite its toughness and
rigidity, can be sawn like timber. For this purpose use an
old hand saw.
NAILING.
Nail Durabestos with special blunt-point nails, driven at
approximately 12" intervals at least of an inch from the
edge of the sheet. These special nails are available 15", I"
and long by 14-gauge in galvanised steel; approximately
i.|b. is required to fix every 100 square feet of Durabestos
Sheeting.
JOINTING.
Durabestos Sheets are not lapped—the edges are simply
butted closely one against the other. Over this butt joint,
screw or nail a Durabestos Cover Mould of the required
width. At internal and external angles secure a Durabestos
Internal or External Angle Mould.
HORIZONTAL JOINTS.
When Durabestos Cover Moulds Type A, L or M are used,
then it is necessary to weatherproof the horizontal joint by
the use of the galvanised weather strip G. This weather
strip extends from the back and under the upper Durabestos
Sheet, and laps down over the lower sheet. Where the Special
Durabestos Horizontal Cover or weatherboard Mould H,
or the weatherboard Mould N is employed, the galvanised
weather strip S is unnecessary, for both of these mouldings
are designed for the dual purpose of covering and weather-
proofing the joint, the flat member fitting under the upper
sheet and the moulded member lapping over the lower sheet
or weatherboarding. It is necessary when fixing either H or N
types to check out the timber studding to accommodate the
flat member of the moulds. Where these horizontal cover
moulds intersect at external corners, it is usual to clean mitre
them. Screws (of brass preferably) are recommended for

fixing the Horizontal Cover and Weatherboard Moulds. See
details below.
When it is desired to add to the effect of horizontality, as
illustrated in many of the designs of homes, apply Durabestos
Cover Moulds at intervals between those covering the joints
of the sheets. Ample fixing can be obtained by securing
these intermediate moulds at each timber stud.
METHODS OF APPLYING COVER MOULDS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
HOW TO PAINT DURABESTOS
Durabestos possesses a smooth, even, grey-white surface
which does not require further decoration. However, where
colourful treatment is needed, this can be carried out eco-
nomically by adhering to the following instructions:
COLD WATER PAINTS.
Cold water paints can be applied direct in the same manner
as when painting ordinary cement surfaces. The surface
must be thoroughly dry before applying the decorative
medium. It is essential that only the best materials be used.
OIL PAINTS, ENAMELS. LACQUERS, Etc.
The decoration of Asbestos Cement with oil paints, etc.,
presents no more difficulties than are encountered with any
comparatively new cement surface. Most well-known paint
manufacturers have overcome these difficulties by produc-
ing a cement sealing compound which, when applied to the
surface of the sheets according to directions, will prevent
the action of any free alkali that may be present. It is neces-
sary to apply this sealer as a priming coat, before following
on in the usual way with the paint medium. It is again essen-
tial that only the best of materials are used and that the
surface of the sheet is thoroughly dry before operations are
commenced.
Where clients desire to obtain further information relative
to painting, the names of leading paint manufacturers will be
furnished on request.
THE ABOVE DRAWING ILLUSTRATES THE USE OF DURABESTOS COVER
MOULDINGS AND OTHER ACCESSORIES.


WUNDERLICH DURATILE WALL TILE SHEETING
For Lining the Interior Walls of Bathrooms, Kitchens, etc.
Wunderlich Duratile is an Asbestos-Cement Sheeting pat-
terned to represent 4" x 4" Ceramic Wall Tiles. It fulfils
the demand for inexpensive tile-like walls, for it has all the
attractions of Ceramic Wall Tiles and can be painted or
enamelled to suit any decorative scheme.
Duratile Sheets and accessories are available in the follow-
ing sizes:—
DURATILE SHEETS ( T V thick approx.):
3' and 4' wide by 4,5, 6, 7 and 8' long.
DURATILE (Asbestos Cement) COVER MOULDS:
2", and 3" wide x T V' thick.
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANGLE MOULDS:
2" x 2", 2f 1 x 3" x 3"—all T V thick.
TOP-CAPPING MOULD: 3" x
All in lengths of 4,5, 6,7, 8, 9 and 10'.
DURATILE SKIRTING:
6" x with bevelled edges, in lengths of 6' and B'.
METAL (Unpolished Brass or Polished Staybrite Steel):
JOINT STRIP No. 1686, EXTERNAL ANGLE No.
1687, INTERNAL ANGLE No. 1688, in lengths of
4. 5, 6. 7. 8. 9 and 10'.
FIXING.
Duratile is readily installed. It is furnished in waste-saving
sizes to suit the dimensions of every wall. Should irregular
or odd sizes be required, the sheets can be sawn, or
severed along the score marks by holding firmly on a
flat bench with the surplus projecting: steady arrrt pres-
sure along this surplus will fracture the sheet.
Duratile is nailed or secured with nickel-plated counter-
sunk round head screws direct to wall studs or timber
frame work. Concrete brick or stone walls should first be
plugged and battened. Space the battens to suit the
sizes of the sheets. A batten must always be placed be-
hind the joint of two sheets and running in the direction
of the joint. At internal and external angles secure a
batten vertically at each side of the angle. It is important
that they be fixed true and level.
DURATILE may be fixed:—
1. Using metal joint, internal and external angle
strips.
2. Using Duratile (Asbestos Cement) Cover Moulds
and internal and external angle pieces, etc,
3. With butt joints.
Always commence fixing from the corner of a room, being
careful that the first sheet is fixed plumb. If metal joints,
strips, etc., are used, as in Method (I), fix Internal angles
No. 1688 of the desired length to internal corners by nail-
ing through both flanges on to the timber backing. If
the room is over 8' long and two or more sheets of DURA-
TILE are necessary to cover the area, where the sheets
meet vertically, fix a metal joint strip No. 1686 by nailing
through both flanges. Then slide the sheet into position.
Cover horizontal joints (if any) with Metal Joint Strip No.
1686 nailed through the top flange only.
For finishing at external corners a Metal External Angle
No. 1687 is provided; this is secured by nailing through
both flanges prior to sliding the sheets into position.


If DURATILE (Asbestos Cement) Cover Moulds are used
(Method 2), then the sheets are nailed to the timber-
frame work and Cover Moulds, Internal and External
Angle Pieces of the selected width and length are secured
over the joints and to the respective corners. Secure at
18" Centres with nickel-plated screws.
In method (3) (Butt Joints), where sheets meet at right
(internal) angles, the edge of one sheet is butted against
the face of the other. Flush wall joints are made by butting
the edges of the sheets. If an external angle occurs it is
advisable to finish with an external angle mould. Stop
all flush joints with white lead.
FINISH AT FLOOR LINE AND DADO.
Finish at the floor line with Duratile 6" x bevelled skirt-
ing and at dado with Duratile Top-capping Mould secured
with nickel screws at 18" centres.
FIXING OF LARGE-SIZED SHEETS.
Where large-sized sheets are used, secure the body of the
sheet at 18" centres with nickel-plated countersunk round-
headed screws or brads through the score marks—not the
plain surface of the sheet.
IMPORTANT: Where Duratile is fixed behind baths,
basins, sinks, draining boards, etc., where moisture Is likely
to be constantly present, seal the bottom edge by setting
in a plastic compound such as "Vulcatex." Force the edge
down into the compound so that some of the mixture is
squeezed behind the sheet.
PAINTING DURATILE.
The following specification is recommended as providing
generally the best and most lasting finish on "DURATILE."
The surface of the sheeting has already been treated
with a cement sealer. It is essential that Ine sheets be
thoroughly dry before painting is commenced.
1. Apply one or two coats of flat undercoating.
2. Lightly rub down and finish with one coat of
enamel.
The materials used for the various coatings must be of a
recognised brand.
THE ABOVE DRAWING ILLUSTRATES THE SEVERAL METHODS OF FINISHING AT THE JOINTS OF DURATILE WALL TILE SHEETING


WUNDERLICH DEEP CORRUGATED DURABESTOS
5.75" PITCH ASBESTOS-CEMENT ROOFING & WALL SIDING SHEETS.
DEEP CORRUGATED DURABESTOS SHEETS.
WUNDERLICH DEEP CORRUGATED DURABESTOS
is composed of Asbestos Fibre and Portland
Cement. These components properly mixed and
united result in a corrugated sheet of unique
physical properties, pleasing grey-white appear-
ance and permanence. It is strong, for the 5,75"
pitch corrugations give the highest structural
strength and maximum rigidity, of which the com-
ponent materials are capable. It is highly resist-
ant to fire, is unaffected by salt air and the
weather, and under normal conditions will not
corrode, rot or rust, or permit condensation of
moisture. In addition, Corrugated Durabestos
minimises the transmission of noise from rain and
hail, and heat from the sun. The sheeting is
economical in initial cost, fixing does not present
difficulties and maintenance costs are practically
nil. It is available in a range of convenient stock
sizes, particulars of which are as follows:
Stock Lengths: s', 5'6", 6‘, 6'6", 7', 7'6",
B', SV. 9', 9 , 6", 10'.
