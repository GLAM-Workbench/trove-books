PREFACE
During the years that have come and gone since its discovery, the fortunes of the
Goldfield of Gympie have been of great interest to investor, speculator, and mining men
alike. The steady output and dividends from some mines have attracted the investor;
while the rapid rise and fall in values in others have courted practical interest from
the speculator. The difficulties incident to unravelling the intricacies of the ore
deposits on Gympie, and the high standard of ability shown in the management of the
mines, has rendered the field a centre of attraction both to the practical mining man
and scientist, and though this small treatise upon the field does not attempt to record
its varied interest in detail, or the difficulties that mining men have stubbornly met and
overcome, it will, we hope, indicate the extent and richness of the field, and the valuable
openings for the investment of capital.
The difficulties ever present in the production of a work of this nature will
emphasize our appreciation of the help that has been given towards its completion. To
Wm. Bracewell, Esq., the Acting Police Magistrate and Warden, for the records of
the field, and the valuable information his long mining experience afforded ; to the
proprietors of the Gympie Times (Messrs. Ramsay and Stumm), from whose records
much of the statistics herein have been obtained ; also to the Gympie Miner and Truth.
The general information of the mines has been in every instance willingly given by the
mine managers on the field, and an object lesson has been afforded the compiler by a
personal visit through the underground workings. Ever having the best interest in the
progress of the field, the Directors of the mines have given every help and assistance in
the furtherance of this publication.
We acknowledge also our indebtedness to the Mining Secretaries on the field, and
especially thank their chief clerks for the extra labour in supplying the information, and
in this respect our many thanks are due to Mr. H. Y. Daunt for the considerable help,
in many ways, which his long residence and experience specially qualified him for.
To all these, and many others, we tender our thanks. That the Brochure will do good,
and will draw to the field further interest from those in distant parts, is the earnest
wish of
THE PUBLISHERS.

' T, N
HE discovery of the Gympie
Goldfield, in October, 1867,
was of inestimable value to
Though gold had been discovered in
several portions of the colony previous to
the discovery of the Gympie fields—notably
at Canoona, in 1858, described as the
maddest of all the Australian rushes, where,
although worked out in six months, 50,000
ounces of gold were obtained; then at
Clermont, in 1862; at Cape River, Crocodile
Creek, Ridgelands, Raglan, and other places
—still none had given prospects of such
enormous wealth as Gympie. Soon the
silent ridges and vine-scrub gullies were
alive with diggers from all parts of the
colonies ; some came by way of the famous
Glass House Mountains, by the Caboolture
and Maroochy rivers, and over the great
spurs of the D’Aguilar Range; some by
vessel to Noosa, then through swamps and
Queensland, for the colony at that time
was passing through a period of great
depression, consequent on the failure of the
old Bank of Queensland and Masterman’s
Bank in London, and due also to a scarcity
of work for the many immigrants who,
during the previous years, had been flocking
to the colony. When, however, the news
spread that gold in enormous quantities
had been discovered at Gympie, first Mary-
borough, then Brisbane, Ipswich, and other
surrounding settlements were drained of
their male population, and thousands were
rapidly on their way in pursuit of fortune at
the goldfield.

run out, and the claims were being so
rapidly abandoned that it seemed at one
time that the field would become deserted ;
for at this date there was no evidence to
show the fact
that other beds
of black slate
existed below
those first found,
and that it was
in conjunction
with them that
payable gold ex-
isted in the reefs.
To test the
country below
the levels al-
ready worked in
1872, shafts
were sunk to greater depths, with the result
that other slate beds were found, and large
returns of gold were obtained at different
levels, in reels which had hitherto been con-
sidered almost worthless. Since that time
reefing has gone on, with alternating periods
of prosperity and depression certainly, but
without intermission. Upwards of 1,181
leases have been issued since the opening of
the field, the number now in force being over
150. The last year has been the busiest
in the Warden’s office since the early days
of Gympie. This has been chiefly owing
to discoveries at the south-eastern and
northern ends of the field. During the
year 2,422 acres were applied for as Gold
Mining Leases, and 38 new companies
registered with a nominal capital of
£\sl >ss°, divided into 2,232,00 a shares.
The old companies on the Register during
1898 totalled 105, with a nominal capital
of 13s. 4d., divided into
4,729,30° shares, making in all 143 com-


panics registered with a nominal capital of
/T,677,491 13s. 4d., divided into 6,933,800
shares. In addition to the whole of the
ground available having been taken up to
the extreme limit of the. southern boundary
of the goldfield, several freeholds in this
direction have been purchased from the
owners, owing to the splendid develop-
ments in the “ Scottish Gympie ” Mine.
The following description of the geo-
logical formation of the Gympie Goldfield,
by the eminent authority, Mr. W. H.
Rands, Assistant Government Geologist,
who has made several elaborate reports
on Gympie, will be of interest:
“ The reefs here occur in stratified and
fossiliferous rocks, which are in age the
equivalent to the Upper Carboniferous
in England. One of the most interest-
ing features of this field is the very
peculiar occurrence of gold in the reefs.
The strata consists of alternations of
different sedimentary rocks, such as lime-
stones, conglo-
merates, sand-
stones, shales,
&c., with inter-
bedded volcanic
and intrusive
igneous rocks—
the latter be-
coming very fre-
quent, and hav-
ing to a large
extent taken the
place of the sedi-
mentary rocks
in the lower por-
tion of the series. Most of the gold has
come from the upper and the less altered
series. It is only where the reefs are pas-
sing through the dark-coloured shales, or
W. H. Rands,
Assistant Government Geologist.
‘black slates,’ as they are locally termed,
that payable gold has been found in them.
The stratified rocks run in a nearly north
direction, and dip to the east at an angle of
about 1 in 3, and the reefs run in nearly the
same direction, but underlie to the west, or
at right angles to the dip of the strata.
Four well-defined beds of black slate occur
in Gympie, and wherever in conjunction
with these beds


peculiar occurrence of the gold was thorough-
ly realised, but as soon as it was, it led to a
regular method of working, viz., the sinking
of vertical shafts down to the slate beds, and
then driving cross-cuts from the shafts in
search of reefs in the slate. The reefs are
very numerous on the Gympie Goldfield,
and it is seldom that it is necessary to drive
far without cutting a reef. The western por-
tion of the field has been tested both by
shafts and by the diamond drill, for a con-
siderable depth (nearly 1000 feet) below the
lowest auriferous country. The beds run
north and south, and dip to the east. It is
evident, therefore, that the auriferous
zones, as they may be called, are
continually getting deeper and deeper to
the east, and it is by sinking shafts to
the east of the present workings to cut
these beds at their lower levels that the out-
put of gold in the future will be maintained.
This requires capital, but the investment
.will, in every probability, be a profitable one.
“ The majority of the principal reefs, such
as the Great Eastern, Glanmire, Columbia,
Wiltshire, Smithfield, Wilmot, Phoenix,
March, Golden Crown, Maori, Alma, Lady
Mary, Caledonian, Hilton, California, Nil
Uesperandum, Louisa, Perseverance, Excel-
sior, and Alliance have a general north or
NNW bearing, and underlie to the west,
with an inclination that is nearly at right
angles to the dip of the strata. The most
important cross reefs are the Monkland,
which bears NW. and underlies SWh,
and the Inglewood, which bears NNW.
and underlies NNE.”
It is upon the geological information
obtained, substantiated by 30 years’ ex-
perience of mining on the field, that so
great an effort is being made to develop
the eastern ground, and this explanation of
the formation of the field will be of assist-
ance in dealing with the descriptions of
the claims.

Previous to 1893 if i s recorded that 5,169
tons of stone produced 16,228 ounces of
gold, valued at £"57,175, from which
dividends were declared amounting to
£"39,025, equal to £"i is. lod. per share.
In the half year, from June to December,
1893, 3,583 tons of stone produced 11,831

THE GREAT MONKLAND, which is
to the north-west of Nicholl’s Lease, is now
under exemption. This claim, which in-


eludes the one-time 2 and 3 South Monk-
land, 1 North, 1 South, and Extended
Aurelia, and others, was opened in 1870;
the first year’s crushing from the 2 South
Monkland giving a return of 3,182 ounces
from 1,161 tons of stone. In 1872 91 1
tons gave 1,790 ounces ; in 1873 th e magni-
ficent return of 11,269 ounces of gold from
1,480 tons of stone was obtained. Another
valuable crushing was in 1872, from the
Aurelia portion, of 3,626 ounces from 1,390
tons. During the first sixteen years of its
history upwards of 36,333 ounces of gold,
valued at were obtained.
NICHOLE'S LEASE , which is now let
to a tribute company, is between the Great
Monkland and the South Glanmire and
Monkland claims, and has an area of 12
acres. The Glanmire and Monkland
reefs traverse
the claim, and
the immense
stacks of mul-
lock near the
eastern and
western shafts
denote the great
activity with
which mining
was carried on
in this lease.
The mine was
first opened in
1870, and medium crushings were taken out
until 1873, when a yield of 3,549 ounces of
gold was obtained from 419 tons of stone ;
upwards of 15,000 ounces were obtained
during the succeeding fifteen years. The
chief work is being carried on at the 310
feet level, a crosscut being in 255 feet east.

One famous return was 14,728 ounces from
2,177 tons of stone. The claim, which has
an area of 1,200 feet by 400 feet, is at pre-
acres, yielded upwards of 69,777 ounces of
gold to the various companies during the
years 1870 to 1888, the returns giving from
one ounce to as high as four ounces to the
ton. From August 1896 to April 1898, 857
tons of quartz gave a return of 1,039
ounces of gold. The shaft is down 600

traverse the mine in all directions denote
the enormous amount of work which has
been done.

ground was first taken up in the early
seventies, and excellent crushings were
taken out of the reefs met with in the 180,
260 and 300 feet levels. In 1873 836 tons
gave 1,317 ounces; in 1874 730 tons gave
2,799 ounces; in 1875
1,240 tons gave 3,954
ounces; and in 1876 1,1 o 1

The mine returned a
total of 13,314 ounces of
gold from 8,792 tons of
stone for the years 1880,
1881, and 1882.
The western shaft was
sunk a further distance,
levels being driven east
and west at the 360 feet,
and east at 420 feet and
580 feet, discovering the
existence of what is now
known as the Nos. 4,5, and 6 reefs. After
work had been carried on for several years
upon these small but rich reefs, the adjoining
claim discovered the famous Great Eastern
Reef, and the 1 North Glanmire extended
their 360, 420, and 580 feet levels, and cut
this reef east from the shaft. A winze was
sunk on the reef and connected the 420
feet and 580 feet levels, the reef being very
large and rich, giving from two to 20 feet
of crushing stone ; 11,579 tons of stone were

cross-cut was driven east at 500 feet. A
diorite reef was cut at a distance of 165 feet
from the shaft, averaging
about six inches of crush-
ing stuff, with occasional
rich patches of gold. The
same reef was met with
west, and worked on at
the 645 ft. level ; the lat-
ter level was driven east
to the boundary, where
the rich Orient Reef was
met with, averaging four
feet of quartz, besides
numerous adjacent lead-
ers. Between the 645 ft.
and the 712 feet levels
which had been driven
on the Orient Reef, magnificent gold-be-
spangled quartz was obtained in the stopes
about 40ft. above the 686 ft. or intermediate
level, the reef looking like a glisten-
ing jeweller’s shop. The work at present
is confined to this reef, where stoping
is being carried on. The machinery
on this shaft consists of a2O h.p. engine,
Cornish boiler, double winding gear,
with 6-feet drums, and the usual mine
buildings, such as blacksmith’s shop, store-
room, etc. At the Western Shaft there is
a 12 h.p. Lever engine, Cornish boiler,


and double winding gear, with 6-feet drums,
and a magnificent 20-head crushing battery,
the whole being valued at £5,700.

PHCENIX G.M. CO., LIMITED.—
This famous claim, commonly known as
the Big Phoenix, consists of a lease of 25
acres, and is one of the most prominent
claims in the history of the field. First
held under separate miner’s rights, the
ground eventually came into possession of
the One-Mile G.M. Co., through the
amalgamation of several claims. The
returns from the 200 feet shaft in 1870
were 339 ounces of gold from 403 tons of
stone; in 1871, 252 tons of stone gave 482
ounces of gold, and in 1872 the phenomenal
yield of 3,502 ounces of gold was obtained
from 152 tons of stone. In 1875 Mr. Coul-
drey, the principal shareholder in the com-
pany, formed the Phoenix G.M. Co., Ltd.,
with a share capital of divided into
12,000 ten shil-
ling shares. This
was, in 1895, al-

taken in hand on the adjoining leases, and
the Phoenix claims, north and south, rapidly
opened up levels to reach this famous reef.
From 1870 to June, 1888, upwards of 64,431
ounces of gold were produced from the
western workings of the claim. The
southern shaft is down 650 feet, and has
immense underground workings.

with at 20 Let from the shaft, which was
worked with payable results. Sinking to
700 feet the reef was cut in the shaft ;
after further sinking a level was put in at
776 feet. The reef was cut about 40 feet
west from the shaft, which gave good
results; after further sinking, a cross-cut

consists of a lease of 16 acres, and is sur-
rounded by some of the most valuable
mines on the field. The company has a
capital of in /"48,00c shares of
10s. each, paid to 7s. Crushings of

68,595 ounces of gold. The dividends
declared amount to /T 66,200, equal to
£3 9s. 3d. per share. In 1897 this mine
raised 3,493 tons of stone, which yielded
9,292 ounces of gold, and paid in
dividends.
From the three-chambered shaft,
which is down 1,097 ft., the follow-
ing levels have been driven:—6lsft.
level in 800 ft. south; 715 ft. level

THE GREAT EASTERN.— This
mine, famous alike in the annals of Gympie
mining and its numerous lucky share-
holders in Great Britain, is a 6-acre lease,
situated between the 1 South Great
Eastern and the 1 North Glanmire, both
foremost claims on the Gympie Goldfield,
and was brought into prominence by the
discovery and subsequent developments of
the famous Great Eastern Reef. This was






opened out on the 500 feet level, at about
125 feet from the shaft, in September, 1886;
the returns to the end of the year amounted
to 5,661 ounces of gold from 540 tons of
stone. The following year this claim gave
the phenomenal yield, from 8,036 tons of
stone, of 31,843 ounces; the
following half-year gave a

gold from 6,020 tons of ,

The original holders were paid dividends
amounting to £7 2,000, and upon the
purchase of the claim by the English
company received a further sum of
£go,ooo, and 90,000 £1 shares, fully paid
up. This latter company subsequently
obtained upwards of 16s. per share in
dividends, then, seeing the developments
progressing on the north-eastern portion of
the field, disposed of the Great Eastern
ground and purchased a 25-acre lease,
now known as the Australasian, on
the northern boundary of the prominent
4 North Phoenix and the Smithfield and
Phoenix mines. The present Great Eastern
G.M. Co. came into possession of the lease
by purchase from the new 7 and 8 Monk-
land Tribute G.M. Co., in November,
1897. Under the able control of the mine
manager, Mr. John McNamara, prospecting
work is being rapidly pushed on. The bid
shaft is down 750 feet, and a cross-cut is
in 102 feet where, what is known as the
Diorite Orient reef, was cut and a rise is
being put up to meet the bed of slate over-
head, which should be cut at 40 feet. The
new bed of slate, recently cut in the 1 South
Great Eastern, 780 feet in the shaft, should
be met with by sinking the Great Eastern
main shaft about 50 feet. If the above
diorite reef is met with in conjunction with
this new bed of slate it should prove highly
payable. In addition to the work being
carried on from this western shaft, a new
shaft has been sunk on the eastern portion of
the lease, with the view of intersecting the
Great Eastern, the old eastern and western
reefs in the top break of the plumbago.
The shaft is now down 171 feet; a reef
being cut at 70 feet, and slate met with 140
feet in the shaft. A cross-cut is now being
put in from the Eastern shaft at 142 feet,
to cut this reef in conjunction with the
slate.
The machinery consists of a 16 h.p.
winding engine, Cornish boiler, and excel-
lent winding plant. As in all the Gympie
claims the management of the mine is
supervised by an experienced Board of
Directors. The Chairman of the Board is
Mr. D. Scally. The company has a share
capital of divided into 48,000 ss.
shares. It is considered that, due chiefly to
the energetic manner in which the mine is
being worked, it will ere long again take its
stand among the foremost claims upon the
field.

Mr. A. B. Wallace is manager ; he also is
acting manager of the adjoining claim,
3 North Oriental.
THE 2 SOUTH GREA T EA STERN
consists of a 25-acre lease on the south
side of the Glanmire and Monkland. The
company consists of 48,000 ss. shares. The
reef that is being worked is what is known
as the Oriental and Glanmire western reef.
This reef was discovered in a cross-cut
950 feet to the east of the western shaft at
the 774 feet level. 3,350 tons have been
crushed from this famous reef, which
yielded 4,636 ounces of gold, valued at
£3 10s. fid. per ounce, and dividends
amounting to have been realised
from this mine. A new shaft is being
sunk to intersect the reef, which will be 950
feet in depth. There are two shafts upon
the claim ; the western one, down
800 feet, has erected upon it a 22
h.p. engine, an 8 h.p. portable
engine (Robey), driving an electric
plant which lights up all the mine,
and also driving a winding engine
which hauls the present gold-bear-
ing stone 123 feet from the winze
below the 775 feet level. The
manager’s office, smiths, etc., are
at this shaft. The new shaft is on
the eastern side of the lease, and
has upon it a pair of first motion
engines, 32 h.p. and winding plant,
considered one of the foremost on
the field. The yield from this claim in
1898 was 8,028 tons for 8,549 ounces of
gold, and dividends amounting to /T 0,734,
equal to 4s. fid. per share, were declared.
The December crushings realised 1,295
tons for 756 ounces.
The manager is Mr. J. Harris, who has
been in charge for ten years. The
claims opened out on the
Great Eastern Reef at the

and mine workings being lit up with electri-
city, and with the magnificent new battery,
and great body of ore, is of exceeding great
interest to miners and visitors alike.
The winding and battery plants are from
the well-known firm of Walkers Limited,
Maryborough, the winding plant consisting
of a 26ft. 6in, Cornish flue boiler,
6ft. *6in. diameter, fitted with
Galloway tubes, a pair of coupled
high-pressure steam engines with
cylinders iSin. in diameter by
42m. stroke, driving double Bft.
winding drums, with all neces-
sary fittings. The battery is of
50 head, with Bcwt. stamps, ripple
tables, &c., and is driven by a
high-pressure engine, iBin. cylin-
der 42m. stroke. The boiler is
of Lancashire type, 28ft. long by
7ft. diameter, and contains five
Galloway tubes and all necessary mountings.
We give an illustration of the 50 head battery,

the latter being noft. to the pulleys. The
returns from this claim in 1898 was 15,198
tons for io,i47ozs, being the largest yield
upon the field, the North Smithfield and
1 South Great Eastern closely following.
The total dividends from the Scottish Mine
totalled £2,250, equal to 3s. per share.

which the progress of the work in this

paid upwards of ,£*15,500 in dividends,
being about more than its nominal,
and fully £ lO,OOO more than the paid-up
capital, while upwards of 15 reefs and
formations have been worked in the claim.
The lease is 21 acres, and the company has
a share capital of ,£*15,000, in 60,000 ss.
shares. The ground \vas originally owned
by the 10 and 11 Monkland G.M. Co., who
sunk a shaft which is known to this day as
the “ Raggedy,” remnants of wdiich can
be seen near the western shaft of the claim,
which afterwards came into possession
of this company. There are two shafts upon
the lease, the western one, down 640 ft., not
now being worked from, but out of which
an enormous amount of excellent stone has
been raised, at one time keeping 40 head of
stampers going, and the eastern shaft, down

is expected to have handsome returns. At
the 851 ft. level, where a rise is in on No. 1
reef, which, though small, shows good gold,
and on No. 2 reef, which is being driven on
north and shows fair gold, work is also
being carried on from the Oriental shaft
upon the west Oriental reef, a rise being put
up about 330 ft. from the shaft. The reef is
small, but some nice specimen stone is
occasionally seen.
The machinery consists of two double
winding engines, iBh.p. and 20h.p., Cornish
boilers, and air compressor for driving rock
drills.
The returns from this claim in 1898 were
3,746 tons for 3,ii3ozs. of gold, the Dec-
ember crushing being 266 tons for 2i6ozs.

THE 2 GREAT EASTERN, south of
the prominent South Glanmire and Monk-
land, and adjoining the equally valuable 2
Gympie D
South Great Eastern, is the 25-acre lease
of the No. 2 Great Eastern ; interesting to
a visitor because of the high-class machinery
upon the mine, and the splendid battery
and cyanide works near the Mary River,
to which the mine is connected by tram-
line ; and also because of the enormous
workings underground opened up in taking
out the great Inglewood Reef or dyke,
which traverses the mine, from which the
gold is obtained. The caverns of drives,
cross-cuts, and stopes which one meets
with in every part of the mine are evidence
of the great energy evinced in its operations.
The underground workings show the
formation of the Inglewood dyke to consist
of a great diversity of stone, varying in size,
sometimes appearing as a great body of
ironstone quartz, ten and twenty feet wide,
and again a narrow shale or plumbago ;
this again gives place to a broad belt of
mullocky quartz. Two parallel formations,
varying in thickness, traverse the claim,
sometimes but a narrow streak of stone, at
others the sides join together and form a
great body of gold-bearing stone. Should
the stone on the north side appear to cut
out it is usually found that a wide belt comes
in at the south side of the drive and vice
versa , or when these forma-
ttions join a distance ahead
they will be split again by

nature of the rock and the improvements

ago, under the management of Mr. Wm.
McNutt, now manager of the North Oriental

deep, putting in levels to test the ground.
After the ground had been acquired by the
present company, this shaft was deepened,
and is now 714 feet deep. An immense
amount of work has been done in this mine
upon the Inglewood Reef or dyke, which
gives an average of about of crushing
stuff. * From the 310 ft. to the 800 ft. levels,
the full length of the claim, it has been
shown that an immense body of stone,
carrying payable gold, exists. At the 700
feet level, where the reef was intersected
300 feet east from the shaft,
stoping has been done from
boundary to boundary, and
up to above the 400 ft., thou-
sands of tons of stone have
been taken out. A monkey
shaft is also down 100 ft. on
the reef at the 700 ft. level.
A new shaft is being sunk
further east to prospect the
country upon that side of the
Inglewood dyke; good pro-
gress is being made with the
sinking. Upon the claim is

cyanide giving 907 ounces additional;
dividends were declared during the year to
a total equal to 6s. 6d. per share.
Owing to the splendid facilities for treating
the stone and the excellent management
throughout, the mine is one of the foremost
upon the field, and gives every promise of
continuing to give good returns.

GYMPIE EASTERN
SYNDICATE.— The profit -
able developments resulting
from deep-sinking in the
Scottish Gympie Gold Mines,
Oriental and Glanmire, Col-
umbia Smithfield, Phoenix
P.C., 4 North Phoenix, and
others, resulted in the forma-
tion of a syndicate in July, 1898, by Mr.
W. E. Thomas, for the purpose of acquiring
a large area on the north-eastern portion of
the goldfield amounting to 265 acres. The
syndicate have already prepared extensive
plans, reports, etc., on the property by
leading mining men, including Messrs. James
Brown, manager 4 North Phoenix, and C.
B. Steele, licensed and mining surveyor,
with the intention of placing portions of
the property on the London and other
markets. The following is the opinion


expressed by Mr. W. H. Rands, Assistant
Government Geologist :
“This syndicate holds eleven leases, viz; Nos.
1153, 1167, and 1171 to 1179 inclusive, having a
total area of 265 acres. They are situated to the
east of all the oth-r leases on this part of the field,
and extend from immediately east of the Oriental
Extended, near the centre of the field, to immedi-
ately east of the No. 1 North Columbia Extended, at
the northern end, having a linear extension in a
direction a little west of north (the direction in
which the reefs run) of 115 chains, with an average
breadth say of 20 chains in an east and west
direction.
WIDGEE DIVISIONAL BOARD OFFICE.
With the exception of a few shallow prospecting
trenches on Lease 1178, no work at all has been
done on any of the leases, and their future prospects
can therefore be only judged of by the position they
occupy. The trenches have simply proved that
reefs and leaders crop out at the surface, but as the
shafts will have to be sunk to a depth of about 2000 ft.
before opening out on the highest of the known
auriferous beds of slate, these outcrops are of no
very great importance. The following is a descrip-
tion of the trenches ;
Trench No. x.—'This was the most easterly one.
Several small leaders of quartz run a little west of
north, and dip to the west.
Trench No. 2.—ln this there was a hard glassy
looking quartz, with a sandstone formation, running
west of north, in shales dipping a few degrees north
of east. This looks as though it would make into
a fair sized body of stone.
Trench No. 3. —About 200 ft. north of No. 2.
This has disclosed some hard jasperised quartz, in
a hardened sandstone or quartzite.
Trench No. 4. —A reef of quartz running west of
north occurs in shales.
A few chains north-east of Lease No. ii79> the
outcrop of a quartz reef, 2ft. 6in. wide, with the
usual strike and underlie, is visible.
The country on which these leases are situated
consists entirely of the shales and thin bedded
sandstones, which overlie conformably the aurifer-
ous belt of rocks, and by that I mean the rocks in
which the reefs have been successfully worked to
the west. Up to the present time, the mining done
in these overlying shales has not been profitable,
but should rock similar to that cut in the Columbia
Consolidated at 100 ft. in depth be met with, it is
highly probable that reefs in contact with it would
be payable. However this may be, it is the beds
below the limestone that must be relied on, and
the estimated depth at which the top of the upper
bed of slate should be cut, allowing an average dip
to the east of 1 in 3, is about 1600 ft. at the western
boundary, and about 1800 ft. in the centre of the
the leases, where the shafts will probably be
situated, and as the slate itself is about 200 ft. in
thickness, it will be at 2000 ft. in depth at least
before crosscuts can be opened out to the east.
Ten years ago, in my first report on this goldfield,
I predicted that its future lay in the deeper ground
to the east, and that the limit probably would be
the depth at which mining could payably be carried
on. The work lately done on the north-eastern
part of the field goes far to prove that this is coming
true, at any rate I have seen nothing to cause me to
alter that opinion, and that being the case, although
shafts have to be sunk to the great depth of 2000 ft.
before ever opening out for reefs, I look upon the
mining of these leases as a perfect legitimate
venture. The more important mines that have
worked in the slates west of these leases are the
Smithfield United, Columbia Smithfield, Phoenix,
No. 1 North Phoenix, North Smithfield, No. 1
North Smithfield, Phoenix Golden Pile, Smithfield
and Phoenix Golden Pile, Nos. 3,4, and 5 North
Phoenix, &c., &c.”

THE 1 SOUTH GREA T EASTERN
is a lease of 9 acres, 3 roods, 37 perches,
and is situated on the south boundary of
the famous Great Eastern Gold Mine.
The company has a nominal capital of
divided into 48,000 2s. 6d. shares,
and is one of the foremost
dividend paying claims on
the field, giving a return tS?

ing to a total of
equal to 9s. per share, making a total of
£1 ss. pd. per share paid from this mine
since its opening. The December crush-
ings were 629 tons for 738 ounces, the
dividends being equal to pd. per
share. A two-chambered shaft is down
782 feet, and is being continued. At 780
feet a black floor, with plumbago faces,
was cut, giving indications of further rich
possibilities, and two reefs, the Great
Eastern and the Orient, have been worked.
At the 478 feet level a cross-cut is in
90 feet east, where the Great Eastern
Reef was worked upon, and thousands
of tons of good crushing stone obtained.
At the 550 feet level a level is in 450 feet.
The Orient Reef was met with in this
level, and worked upon by a cross-cut at
120 feet from the shaft; at the 600 feet
this reef was also worked upon east of
the shaft ; as this reef was dipping west
the shaft passed through it near this level,
and at 630 feet a cross-cut was put in west
to work the reef. The level at present
being worked is at 730 feet, and has been
driven east 562 feet. A leader was cut at
440 feet and a winze was sunk 71 feet; the
formation opened out to 14 feet giving from
four to five feet of good crushing stone.
The reef has been driven north and south,
the reef showing well at both stopes. The
claim extends about 750 feet along the line of
reef at the north of the 730 feet level, and
cross-cut 430 feet from the shaft; a winze
was sunk on the reef 38 feet.
The machinery consists of 20 h.p. engine
(Walker’s Ltd., Maryborough), double
winding plant, and Cornish boilers. The
manager, one of the most courteous on the
field, is Mr. E. Dunne, who was manager
for three years of the South Eastern
Extended, and is a Director of the Great
Eastern, 3 South Great Eastern, 1 North
Great Eastern, and several others. Up-
wards of 60 men are employed upon the
mine. The Directors are—Messrs. J.
McSweeney (Chairman), J. S. Martin, M.
Cosgrove, R. Dillon, and W. Duckworth.
Secretaries, Messrs. Barns & Webb.
THE ORIENTAL AND GRAN-
IN IRE Shaft can be seen on the north
side of the railway line as the train draws
up at the Monkland station, the latter
being on the lease, the line going through
the southern portion. The lease consists
of 24 acres, 3 roods, 37 perches. The
company has a capital of
\ £1 2,000, divided into 48,000
mSm ss. shares, now paid to 2s.

feet, but owing to difficulties met with in
the workings, to water, etc., the ground
was eventually abandoned. Owing to the
development of the adjoining ground, this
claim was again taken up by the present
company, who, after being under heavy
expenses in concreting the shaft and re-


opening the former workings, in January,
1896, commenced to sink still further.
Since then the shaft has been sunk to a
depth of 940 feet ; a reef was cut in the

shaft at 755 feet, now known as the
Oriental, the most eastern development at
that time on Gympie. A cross-cut was
put in at 730 feet, cutting the reef 12 feet
east of the shaft. The dip of the reef is
west, the reef striking 27 degrees west of
north. There are levels driven in west at
840 feet and 920 feet. A winze was sunk
on the reef to join these two levels; the
reef was then stoped out north and south
for a considerable distance. Work is still
being carried on upon this reef, the whole
of the expenses connected with the mine
being paid therefrom, and also several
dividends to the shareholders ; formation
averages about 7 feet. A cross-cut has
been driven east at 920 feet, and a reef,
carrying payable gold, was met with 250
feet east of the shaft; this reef has been
driven on north and south, giving excellent
stone throughout. A winze was sunk
on the reef 134 feet, carrying payable
gold throughout, the formation between
the walls being about 14 feet, and upwards
of thirty head of stampers are kept
going from these reefs. A grant of pound
per pound was given by the Queensland
Government towards sinking the shaft;
this, with all other debts, was paid some
considerable time ago from the proceeds
of the mine. A three-chambered shaft
will be shortly under progress on the
eastern portion of the lease, to meet the
valuable reefs met with in the Scottish Gym-
pie Gold Mines and the 2 South Great East-
ern grounds, which should all traverse the
Eastern ground. It is expected to cut this
country at about 1,400 feet. As the reefs
are very large in the Scottish ground, there
is every probability of over 1,300 feet of
the reef going through the Oriental and
Glanmire lease, the reefs going north and
south.
The yield from this claim in 1898 was
5,296 tons for 5,420 ounces of gold, and
dividends, amounting to a total of
equal to is. 6d. per share, were declared.
The December crushings realised 795 tons
for 1,090 ounces of gold.

asian mines, have drawn keen attention to
this side of the field, and leases have been
taken up of the adjoining land for a con-
siderable distance. Numerous companies
have been registered to test
the country for the Monkland
and Phoenix shales or slates,
as it is in conjunction with
these beds that the reefs have
given such good results.
As it is intended to sink the
shafts from 1000 ft. to 1500 ft.,
an enormous future opens out
for this field by the projects
of these companies, and should
success attend their efforts, as
every probability shows, Gym-
pie will ere long add materi-
ally to its present splendid
output of gold.
In the list of Gympie mines which accom-
panies this book, these new ventures, which
encircle the north and east sides of the
field, are marked with an asterisk, and upon
the map which accompanies this work can
be seen the positions they occupy. All of
these claims are being prospected upon to
pick up the rich leads of stone which the
older companies discovered after years of
work and in the face of many disappoint-

What is known as the Two-Mile is
situated about two miles N.W. from Gym-
pie, and was opened in 1868 by a man named
Campbell, who found alluvial in the gullies
thereabout, A rush quickly followed and
rich gold was unearthed, but the ground
soon became worked out. In the same
year, however, some rich reefs were


discovered in the adjoining ridges and
magnificent quartz, studded with gold,
was obtained from the surface downward.
From 1870 to 1887 upwards of 4)872 ozs. of
gold were obtained from the London Reef;
the first crushing of 167 tons giving 3,418
ozs. of gold. The German Reef adjoining
gave a crushing the same year of 9 tons for
110 ozs., and the Bristol Reef 50 tons for
215 ozs ; these two reefs returning over
goo ozs. of gold during the short time they
were worked. From the Chatsworth Reef
upwards of 824 ozs. were obtained from
588 tons ; the Homeward Bound Reef, 516
ozs. from 261 tons of stone ; and the
Sadowa, 784 ozs. from 61 tons of stone.
Reefs known as the John Bright, Canadian,
and Napoleon were also opened, but with
small results. Attention has been paid to
this portion of the goldfield at several times
and considerable work has been done
exploring the ground for further rich shoots
of gold, but without satisfactory results,
although every indication tends to the
belief that excellent gold-bearing country
exists, equal to
that at the sou-
thern side of the
field. Govern-
ment aid has
been given to
test the London
ground; but no
no doubt further
work will be car-
ried on at some
future period by
a new company.
MARY RIVER.
Upon the south side of the river some rich
gold has been won from the reefs that have
been worked, and several companies are
carrying on operations on the reefs. From
1870 to 1887 3>35° ozs - were obtained from
the Otago Reef; from the Dawn, 2,005;
from Jones, 1,021 ozs. of gold; and other
lines of reef gave several hundred ounces

The Gympie
goldfield being
situated on the
Mary River, a
very consider-
able portion of
the field is under
flood mark; in
fact, some of the
low lying por-
tions are liable
to submersion in very small floods. Several
of the foremost of the gold producing
mines were in this unfortunate position,
and were periodically liable to be inundated,

flood scheme. tinuous baling, and the water was soon


taken out, and active operations resumed
below.
The scheme now formulated by the
Board was proved to be a perfect success.
During the big flood early in 1898, not a
drop of water entered through the flood
gates, and after the doors were taken up, it
was found that only the water that would
naturally percolate through the strata of the
country had to be baled. The Board
during this trying time had every confi-
dence in their overseer, Mr. P.
Duckworth, who from the very
first stated he was sure his work
would stand against any flood.
Enquiries were daily received
from the Southern Colonies and
England, and when it was proved
that the Board had at last man-
aged to beat the flood waters, con-
gratulations poured in from all
quarters, showing the great inter-
est taken by outside investors in
the success of the scheme.
There are 31 companies inclu-
ded in the drainage area, with a
total of 575 acres. The Board’s
total expenditure since its incep-
tion is /"6,83c, and as a slight idea
of the usefulness of the Board’s scheme, it is
estimated it would have taken at least
/*7,000 to free the mines from water if the
flood gates and dams had not been adequate
to prevent the mines from being flooded in
this year, this amount being more than
what the Board has spent altogether.
With this report we attach a plan show-
ing the leases on the area, also a section
giving the level of the 1893 flood, and the
distance in feet from the collar of each shaft
to flood level. The doors on the various
shafts are also marked, showing the depth
they are from the surface, with sketches of
the doors, and the manner in which they
are constructed and fixed in the shaft to
prevent the water from entering. The
strength of the doors, and their resisting
powers have all been carefully calculated by
the Government Hydraulic Engineer, Mr.
Henderson, and in all cases his directions
as to the necessary strength have been
carefully carried out, and the Board has
now every confidence that, unless something

unprecedented occurs, the mines will be
perfectly safe for the future. The sketch
of doors shown on the plans of the drain-
age area will denote the form of inserting
the doors in the levels, and also the enor-
mous resisting power and strength.
THE UNION SA W MILLS (Ferguson

and are thoroughly equipped with modern
appliances for working timber, and also the
latest type of plant for joinery and wood-
turning. The firm was established in 1869,


and formed into a limited liability company
last year, with a share capital of £ 20,000,
the chief holders being Messrs. W. Hen-
derson and Robert Dath. In addition to
being large purchasers of timber, the firm
own a large area of freehold property, con-
taining hoop and kauri pine, cedar, beech,
ironbark, and other timbers. A large
