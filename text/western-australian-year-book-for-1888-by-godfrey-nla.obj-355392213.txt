PREFACE.
This is the third issue of the Western Australian
Year-Book, which, owing to the difficulty in obtaining earlier
information —more especially under the heads of Customs,
Crops, Stock, and Land—l have been unable to prepare for
publication before this date.
Additional information respecting the Mineral re-
sources of the Colony has been furnished to me by the
Government Geologist; I regret that no reliable account can
be obtained of the yield of Gold for the past year, but from
information given to me by the Wardens of the Goldfields,
T estimate the quantity above 50,000 oz.

WESTERN AUSTRALIAN YEAR-BOOK
FOR 1888.
INTRODUCTION.
119ERRA AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA was first visited by the
Portuguese under Menezes in the year 1527, when exploring
fpg the Indian Seas.
The Portuguese were closely followed by the Dutch, who
examined the Western Coast and named its most notable fea-
tures.
In the year 1598, Houtman, who projected the Dutch East
India Company, gave his name to the Abrolhos, which these
islands still retain ; and in 1629 Pelsart suffered shipwreck upon
them.
In 1616, the “ Endraght,” of Amsterdam, made Sharks Bay—
and Dorce Island was named after Peter Doore, her pilot.
In 1619, Edel gave his name to the district round Sharks Bay;
and Cape Leeuwin was so named in 1622, after the vessel from
which it was first seen.
In 1627, the coast to the East of Cape Leeuwin received the
name of Nuyts’ land, from a passenger on board the “Guide
Zeepart” on her voyage to Japan.
In 1628, Captain De Witt, of the “ Karien, ” gave his name to
the land to the North.
In 1665, the Dutch G-overnment gave the name of New Hol-
land to the whole country.
In 1689, Dampier was sent in the “ Roebuck ” to examine the
North and West Coasts.
In 1697, Ylaming discovered and named the Swan River.
From that time until 1770, when Cook discovered and took posses-
sion of Botany Bay, Australia appears to have been generally
neglected.
In 1791, Vancouver entered and named King George’s Sound.
Flinders and Bass extended the discoveries of Cook to the West in
1798, and were followed by Murray in 1802,


The Northern coasts were surveyed by Captain King, in 1820
and 1824, and his work was supplemented by Captains Wickham
and Stokes between the years 1837 and 1843.
In 1826 the Governor of New South Wales sent a detachment
of the 39th Regiment to occupy King George’s Sound, and in the
following year H.M.S. “ Success,” Captain Stirling, was sent to
select a place for settlement on the West coast. She anchored off
the mouth of the River Swan. The officers of the vessel then
proceeded in boats to explore the river towards its source.
The favorable reports made by Captain Stirling on his return
to Sydney determined the Governor of New South Wales to
recommend that a settlement should be formed on the Swan
River, and in 1829 Captain Stirling was sent to found the Colony
of Western Australia, of which he was appointed Lieutenant-
Governor.
At the end of the following year thirty vessels had reached
Fremantle, and had landed over 1,000 settlers, whose personal
property was valued at =£144,000.
The tempting offer made by the Home Government, during
the early days of the Colony, of large grants of land in proportion
to the amount of property brought into the Colony, attracted many
holders of capital; but the consequence was that extensive tracts of
the best portions of land adjacent to the coast were granted to
persons totally unfit to encounter the trial and privation of a new
settlement.
Many of the early settlers became disgusted with their new
life, and left the Colony; but retained possession of the country
granted to them. Those settlers who afterwards arrived were
unable to obtain land in favorable localities, and the population
became scattered over a wide area.
For many years Western Australia remained almost like a new
colony, and its development was retarded considerably by the
discovery of gold in Victoria and elsewhere. Large numbers
of settlers left for the diggings; and at one time it seemed
probable that the Colony would be entirely deserted. Happily,
however, for Western Australia, the goldfields of other Colonies
have ceased to offer those extraordinary and superior attractions
which they did formerly; and now Western Australia, with its
undeveloped resources, offers to the small capitalist and industrious
emigrant a better chance of success than countries where competi-
tion runs high and fewer opportunities exist. The Colony, also, has
some very promising goldfields of its own.


Position. —Western Australia includes all that portion of New
Holland situated to the westward of the 129th degree of longitude,
and extends between the parallels of 13 deg. 44 min. and 35 deg.
South, its greatest length being 1280 miles from North to South,
and its breadth from East to West about 800 miles.
Area. —According to the latest computations the area of
Western Australia is 1,060,000 square miles or 678,400,000
acres —the whole of Australia is estimated to contain 2,944,628
square miles, and therefore Western Australia occupies more than
one third of the continent.
Capital.— Perth, the capital of the Colony, is situated on the
banks of the Swan River about 12 miles from the port of
Fremantle, which is in latitude 32° 03' and longitude 115° 45'.
Physical Features. —The physical conformation of Western
Australia presents no very remarkable features. The coast line,
extending for a distance of about 3,000 miles, is indented by a
certain number of bays, creeks, and harbors, and in the Northern
parts fringed by numerous islands. In the South, there are three
separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The
loftiest is the Blackwood range, though the highest point of this is
only about 2,000 feet. The other ranges are known as the Darling
and Roe, and these, with the exception of Mount William, in the
Murray District, which is 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater
altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea.
In the Northern part of the Colony, there is the Leopold Range, of
about the same magnitude. The settled districts are usually level
or undulating, rarely mountainous. The Western sea-board is
comparatively flat, of a sandy character with indications of a
recent geological formation. To the Eastward of the Darling
Range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character
and improves as you proceed inland. With the exception of a few
sand plains, the whole of the uncultivated country of the Southern
part of the Colony may be said to be a vast forest principally
timbered with jarrah and white gum.
No volcanoes exist in any part of the Colony. The appearance
of the country throughout indicates a condition of remarkable
quiescence during every geological age.
The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the North to
Point D’Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles.
Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this
range, and flow into the sea to the westward,


The principal rivers on the West coast are the Fitzroy,
DeG-rey, Harding, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons and Gascoyne, the
Murchison, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Preston, Blackwood, Warren and
G-ordon. Most of these are mere storm water channels filled during:
_ t o
the rainy season, and very few of them are navigable even for boats
for any great distance.
Lakes.— The lake district may be considered to be confined to
the westward of the Darling Range; within this area there are
numerous salt and fresh water lakes and lagoons—but many of
them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.
Numerous Islands occur at points on the coast-line; Dirk
Hartog Island, in Sharks Bay, is the largest of those used for
pastoral purposes.
The principal Capes of the Colony are Cape Londonderry,
the extreme Northern limit, Cape Leveque at the entrance of
King Sound, North-west Cape at the mouth of Exmouth Gulf,
Steep point at the South entrance of Sharks Bay, Cape Naturahste,
Cape Leeuwin, and Point D’Entrecasteaux on the South-west
coast.
Climate.— There are two seasons. —The wet season usually
commences in April and ends in October —during this period fre-
quent and heavy rains fall. The summer season is occasionally
visited with thunderstorms and partial showers. The variation of
temperature between the hottest months of summer and the coldest
months of winter average about 65 degrees.
In Perth, in 1888, the maximum temperature in the shade was
105, on the 2nd January and the 15th December; the minimum
was 34, on the 31st of August, and the mean for the year was 65.
The average number of days upon which rain fell was 117
and total rainfall 27| inches.
In the Northern parts of the Colony within the torrid zone
the temperature is high and the summer heat excessive, but the
climate possesses a dryness of atmosphere which renders it unlike
and superior to most tropical climates.
Towards the Southern parts of the Colony, from the capital
to Albany, the climate is almost all that could be desired. It is
only during three months of the year that unpleasantly hot
weather is experienced; the nights and mornings, however, are
nearly always cool, and there being so little moisture in the
atmosphere no danger arises from sleeping in the open air,

Before the Northern part of the Colony became settled to any
extent, the death rate was lower than any of the Colonies. Since
population has been moving towards the tropical part of the
Colony, and the towns of the Northern Districts are becoming
more thickly populated, the death rate has somewhat increased.
In so vast a territory as this, with a population of only
42,000 scattered over it—many of them exposed to the privation
and dangers of a new country —it is unfair to take the general death
rate as indicative of the climate generally. The death rate of the
Southern portion of the Colony probably does not exceed 15 per
1,000 of the population. The general rate for 1888 was 16*00.

Western Australia is the only one of the Australian Group
which is still a Crown Colony, that is to say, a British Dependency
where the officials of the Government, as well as the Governor, are
appointed by the Home Government.
The Constitution of Western Australia is settled by the Local
Act of 1870.
The Government is administered by a Governor, assisted
by an Executive Council. His Excellency is President of the
Executive Council, and its members are the Colonial Secretary,
Attorney General, Colonial Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown
Lands, and the Director of Works. There may be two unofficial


members, but only one is at present appointed, the Hon. Sir James
G. Lee Steere.
There is a single Legislative Chamber, called the Legislative
Council, consisting of Twenty-six members presided over by a
Speaker, as follows:—Four official members, five nominees of the
Grown, and 17 elected members. The qualification of elected mem-
bers is the possession of =£looo freehold property. The qualifica-
tion of an elector is =£loo freehold or ,£lO household or the lease
of Crown lands to the same amount of annual rental.
The people’s representatives are elected for five years, the
electoral lists are made up on or before the 10th of April in each
year, and all voting is by ballot.
By an almost unanimous vote of the Legislature in July,
1887, a resolution was agreed to affirming the principle of self-
Government, and the Governor was requested to take the necessary
steps to carry out the wishes of the Legislature. In December,
1888, the Legislative Council was dissolved, and a general election
took place in January, 1889, in order that the constituencies might
have an opportunity of expressing their views upon the question of
the new Constitution. The following return shows the result of
this election: —

Further action on the question of Responsible Government
was taken at the first meeting of this Council by passing a Con-
stitution Bill, which has been forwarded to the Secretary of State
with the view of having an Enabling Act passed in the House of
Commons at an early date.
POPULATION.
The estimated population of Western Australia at the end
of 1888, was as follows:
SeB::: iS} Tot£j ’ 42 - 137 -
The population estimates are made up by means of the num-
bers of the last census, with the addition of arrivals over departures,
and the excess of births over deaths.
There have been added to the population since 1880, 18,118
persons. The rate of increase since 1870 is shown by the following
summary:—
According to the records of Births and Deaths, the increase by
Births over Deaths was 845, consisting of 327 males and 518 females,
The arrivals by sea were 1,598, consisting of 1,205 males and
393 females; the departures 2,794, consisting of 2,064 males and
730 females. The total increase was 3,116, and the decrease 3,467,
thus leaving the population 351 less than last year.

FINANCE.
Revenue.— The Revenue returns for 1888 show that the ex-
penditure exceeded the revenue by <£28,126, leaving a debit
balance of £23,702.
The receipts from all sources were £357,003, being less than that
of the previous year by £20,900; the principal falling off being
under the head of Customs, Special Receipts, and Interest.
The amount derived from Customs duties was £159,069, and
from other taxation, £20,885.
The Revenue derived from the Rental of Crown Lands was
£75,194, being slightly in excess of the previous year; this is
a little more than double that of 1881, and is now likely to go on
increasing, as new country is being discovered in the various
divisions of the Colony, and is being rapidly stocked.

The proportion of taxation per head of the mean population
was, in 1880, £3 10s. 3d., in 1887 it was £4 10s. Bd., and in 1888
£4 ss. 7d.; this rate is higher than any of the Australian Colonies
The Revenue per head, in 1888, was <£B 9s. 9d.; it will be
found also in this respect that Western Australia ranks higher
than any Colony.

In 1880 there was a debit balance of <£80,950, which had been
accumulating for many years. From 1881 the Revenue has
exceeded the Expenditure until, on December 31st, 1886, the credit
balance had risen to £83,418; this has now been expended, leav-
ing a debit balance of £23,072.

Expenditure.
The Expenditure has kept pace with the increased Revenue.
In 1880 the total expenditure, including interest and sinking fund
on loans, was £204,337; in 1887 this had risen to £456,897.
This, although considerably in excess of the Revenue, included the
expenditure of the balance remaining on hand at the beginning of


that year. The following are the different heads of expenditure for

VITAL STATISTICS.
The Marriages celebrated in Western Australia during 1888
numbered 304, that is 7*22 for every thousand of the mean popu-
lation.
Births.
The number of Births in 1888 was 1518 —consisting of 786
males, and 732 females; at the rate of 36*09 per 1000 of the mean
population. The number of illegitimate births in 1888 was 00, or
3*95 for every 100 births.
Deaths.
There were 673 Deaths registered in 1888, viz.: 459 males,
and 214 females. The number of deaths under 1 year was 188, or
12*38 per cent, of the total births, and 27*93 per cent, of the total
deaths. The number of deaths over 60 years of age was 147.
The death rate per 1000 of the mean population was 16*00.
The following Table shows the rate of mortality for the past
eight years:—
Mr. Hayter, in his Victorian Year Book, states that it has
been held by high authority that the countries in which the climate
is healthy, hygiene properly attended to, and the population in a
normal condition as regards age, the ordinary mortality would
cause the death rate to be about 17 per 1000 persons living —during
the last 8 years Western Australia has exceeded this number 4
times.
The highest rate of mortality was in 1884 ; it was during that
year a serious epidemic of measles attacked nearly three-fourths of
the population, and the number of deaths from this cause was
considerable. It is to be regretted that there are no published
records of the death ages of the past years. It would no doubt
be discovered that the high rate reached in 1884 was due to the
large infantile mortality of that year.
The records of 1888 disclose the fact that infant mortality
has decreased; in 1886 it was equal to 15*48 for every 100


births, in 1887 15*68 for every 100 births, and in 1888 12*38 for
every 100 births. The average of the other Australian Colonies,
for 19 years ending with the year 1884, was as follows :—Victoria,
12*32; New South Wales, 11*21; Queensland, 13*05; South Aus-
tralia, 14*76; Tasmania, 10*43; New Zealand, 9*69.
As this is only the third year that the death ages have been
published in this Colony, no average of Western Australia can be
given to compare with the above Table,
The following Meteorological information for 1888 is furnished by the
Government Reporter:—
The highest temperature in the shade recorded at Perth Observatory
was 105°, on the 2nd January and 15th December ; and the lowest 34°, on
the 31st August,
The greatest range of temperature took place on the 16th March.

TRADE AND COMMERCE.
The trade of the Colony is chiefly transacted with the United
Kingdom, the Australian Colonies, the Straits Settlements, and
Mauritius.
First class ships trade direct between England and Western
Australia, bringing out general merchandise and returning with
wool, timber, lead, and other exports. A steamer subsidised by
the G-overnment runs between Singapore and Fremantle calling
both ways at all the Northern ports of the Colony : by this means
another route of steam communication is established with the
United Kingdom, cargo and passengers being transhipped at Singa-
pore.
The Grovernment pay a subsidy to the Adelaide Steamship
Company who run their steamers to all ports of the Colony, making
fortnightly trips to Adelaide and Melbourne. These steamers
now run as far north as Cambridge Grulf, the most Northern port
of the Kimberley Groldfields. The shipping facilities possessed by
this Colony are considerable, and when regard is paid to the small-
ness of the population and to the fact that ten years ago there was
only one steamer on the coast, the Colony has reason to be well
satisfied with its progress in this respect.

A comparison of the values of external trade during the last
seven vears shows that the exports have considerably increased
in the last three years. From 1880 to 1885 they remained nearly
stationary, but in 1888 they had risen from £499,188 in 1880 to
<£680,346.
The export of wool in 1888 was 8,475,240ft»5., this being
1,799,527ib5. in excess of 1887.
The quantity of gold exported and passed through the Cus-
toms is shown as 3,493 ozs.; but, owing to the imperfect means of
ascertaining the correct amount, this does not represent anything
like the actual quantity.
The exports of 1888, as shown in the Return, are the produce
and manufactures of the Colony, with the exception of £6,825,
the value of re-exported goods.

RAILWAYS
The present G-overnment Railway System of Western Aus-
tralia consists of —-
Ist. The Eastern Railway, from Fremantle, the chief Port
of the Colony, through Perth to Guildford, York, and
Beverley, where it joins the Great Southern Line to
Albany; with branch lines from Spencer’s Brook to
Northam, and Clackline to Newcastle ; a total length
of 131 miles.
2nd. The Northern Railway, from Geraldton to Northamp-
ton, 34 miles, with a branch to Walkaway 17 J miles
in length.
3rd. A line from Bunbury to Boyanup, 15 miles, which has
not as yet been opened for traffic.
All these lines are built to the 3' 6" gauge, which is the normal
gauge of the Colony, and belong to and are worked by the Govern-
ment.
In addition to these Government Railways, an English Com-
pany “ The West Australian Land Company (Limited) ” has con-
structed a line of Railway from Albany to Beverley, a distance of
242 miles, receiving a grant of 12,000 acres of land for every mile


constructed, to be selected within a belt of 40 miles on either side
of the line, but with half the frontage to the Railway reserved to
the Government. The line has been constructed by the well-
known firm of Messrs. C. & E. Millar, and will, it is expected, be
opened for traffic in June of 1889.
Another Land Grant Railway, for which a concession has been
granted, commences at Guildford and runs in a northerly direction
to Geraldton, a distance of about 300 miles.
In addition to these railways there are some private lines
belonging to the large Timber Companies in the South and South-
Western parts of the Colony, which eventually may become a
portion of the Railway System; and also a Tramway from Cossack
to Roebourne, a distance of 8f miles, belonging to and worked by
the Government. This line is built to the two-feet gauge.
Western Australia has now in working order 204 miles of Gov-
ernment Railway, and 51 miles of private lines.

TELEGRAPHS.
Telegraph communication exists in Western Australia between
42 stations within its boundaries. There is communication with
South Australia via Eucla, and by this means with all the
Australian Colonies, Eastern Archipelago, Asia, Europe, and
America. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have laid
a submarine cable from Banjo wangle to the Northern Coast, con-
necting with the West Australian lines at Roebuck Bay. During
1888 the telegraph system was extended 413 miles, with 600 miles
under construction: included in this is a contract to construct a

MINERAL RESOURCES.
Report furnished by the Government Geologist.
Within the last year it was generally considered that Western
Australia was almost destitute of mineral wealth, but this has
fortunately proved to be perfectly incorrect, for now we find that
belts of rich mineral country extend from one end of the Colony to
the other.
The first great discoveries were made in the Victoria district,
from Geraldine on the Lower Murchison River South by North-
ampton nearly to Geraldton, in Champion Bay. These consisted of
very rich lodes of lead and copper, which were very successfully
worked for many years, but owing to the great fall in the value of
these metals and the very small per centage of silver contained in
the lead these mines had to stop work, and at the present only
sufficient ore is raised to ballast the wool ships.
The lead occurs in the form of carbonates and sulphides of
great richness, and the lodes, which are often of great size, contain
so little gangue mixed with the ore that it is very easily dressed.
The copper ores are also very rich, occurring in depth as sul-
phides, but near the surface large masses of carbonates and ferru-
ginous oxides, with a certain amount of native copper, are met with.
These lodes ought decidedly to be worked again, now the price of
copper has risen and labor saving appliances have been brought to
such a stage of perfection, but the great obstacle is the fact that
they are mostly held by persons or companies on long leases, who
have not sufficient capital to work them themselves and expect too
big a sum to transfer their right to any one else.


Smelting works for the lead ores have been erected, tempted
bj the reward which the Government have offered, of <£lo,ooo
for the first 10,000 tons of lead smelted in the Colony, also by
the fact that a ready market can be obtained for the metal in
China via Singapore; but these attempts have failed, either through
bad management or imperfect furnaces and machinery. This
should, if properly carried out, be a success in this district, as galena
dressed to 83 or 84 per cent, can be obtained in any quantity,
added to which fact is the discovery of a coal field about 60 miles
from Geraldton, which produces a very suitable coal for smelting
purposes.
Since 1845, when the first ore was shipped from these mines,
there have been exported from the Colony 7,917 tons of copper, and
31,105 tons of lead ore.
Further finds of copper were made some time after, a little
south of the Irwin River; on one of these a good deal of work has
been done, but it appears that in the deep shaft the lode was never
struck, so the work was abandoned; this was probably due to faulty
management, as all the lodes have the appearance of being true
veins. On others very little was done, in fact nothing more than
quarrying a few tons at the surface to send away, but as there was
about 40 miles cartage over very heavy sand-plains to do before the
Port of Dongarra was reached, it was considered that it would not
pay. Now with every prospect of a railway, and considering the
richness of the ore, which is green carbonate of very high class and
in large quantity, these mines ought to be started again, and if
smelted on the spot (as they are close to the coal field) should pay
well.
In 1846 Gregory found coal on the North branch of the Irwin
River. This was afterwards reported on by Dr. Yon Sommer, who
says that there were two seams, one 6ft., the other Bft., but nothing
was done with this for years, and when it was decided to investigate
this discovery, curiously enough a mistake in the exact place
occurred, and all the work was done on the South branch, which
was called Gregory’s coal seam, but it does not at all answer
his description, whilst his section is identical with that where the
coal has recently been re-discovered in the north branch. This
latter event is due to Messrs. Bell & Eliott, who, finding pieces of
coal lower down in the bed of the river, traced it up to its source
where they discovered a seam 4ft. wide, which, on working into the
cliff, opened out to 6ft. Six other seams have been opened up


lower down the river, the largest of which is Bft. Although the
quality of this coal is not very good at present, it is improving
greatly as it is opened up, and as we know for certain that the
carboniferous formation extends northwards to the Gascoyne River
—a distance of about 300 miles —and probably all the way in
patches to Kimberley, where the late Mr. Hardman marks this
formation, there is every hope of a rich coal field being found in this
Colony.
Mr. Gregory also reports the discovery of coal on the Fitz-
gerald and Phillips Rivers —about 100 to 150 miles east of Albany
—and should this turn out as correct as that on the Irwin, it will
be of great importance to the Colony.
Gold was first found at Peterwangy at the head of the Irwin,
but it unfortunately never proved to be in payable quantity. This
was one of the most unfortunate things that ever happened to us,
as a large number of diggers came round from the other colonies
but finding nothing went away in disgust, proclaiming the Colony
everywhere as no good for gold-mining; so that at present we are
trying to live down this bad name.
Gold was next found by Mr. Hassell, at Kendinup, the assay
of which gave a very large return, but owing to some defect in the
machinery or the working, no return could be obtained on the
ground; this also may be accounted for by the presence of a large
quantity of arsenical pyrites (mispickel) which would cause great
loss both in gold and mercury if not roasted previously to treat-
ment.
In 1882 the late Mr. Hardman visited the Kimberley District,
and in his report of 1884 mapped in places where gold was likely to
be found ; these in every case have proved to be correct, but as most
of the workings in the alluvium were very shallow, the ground was
quickly rushed over and did not prove as rich or to cover as much
ground as several over-sanguine people supposed; these go about
running down the district and blaming Mr. Hardman for saying
gold would be found there, because they were themselves too late to
participate in the 4,873 ozs, which passed through the Customs
hands. Kimberley has now settled down into a reefing district,
and some very rich discoveries have been made, but speculators
must be very cautious, as these far away hills are not always as
green as they are painted.


About two years ago Mr. Glass of Mugakine, about 90 miles
East of Newcastle, found gold whilst sinking a tank near his house,
but has since been unable to find any more. This discovery caused
the settlers of the district, with the aid of the Government, to send
out a prospecting party under the leadership of Mr. Colreavy who
worked over all the country from Newcastle to the Yilgarn Hill,
which is about two hundred miles East of Perth, but without
success.
This party was quickly followed by Mr. Anstey’s, who found
a very rich patch at the cap of a reef in the Yilgarn Hills, but this
unfortunately did not prove to go down, so had to be abandoned.
But in the meantime Mr. Colreavy, who was not satisfied with his
first attempt, had been prospecting on his own account and was
rewarded by the discovery of two or three gold bearing reefs, about
ten miles South of Mr. Anstey’s ; this he called Golden Valley.
This country was at once rushed, and prospecting was carried on in
a southern direction, when Mr. Riseley found another rich patch of
reefs, which he called the Southern Cross, and Mr. Parker who
went further South still, and was rewarded by another rich dis-
covery. This proves that gold extends for certain over 50 miles in
a North and South direction, and though it is not at all likely that
all the claims will prove to be payable, there is not the least doubt
that some will if properly worked.
The next discovery was at Mallina near Roebourne, in the
North-West, where a very rich reef was found, but nothing has
been done with it yet. Reefs carrying gold were also found a few
miles East at Peewah. Prospecting was carried on further East,
when the alluvial fields of Pilbarra were struck, and are at present
being worked very successfully; though being very short of water,
the men have been able to make very fine returns by dry blowing,
and as there is no depth of alluvium (the gold in some cases pro-
jecting above the surface), it is very quickly worked. This district
will probably prove to be very rich in mineral wealth, as besides
gold there are fine lodes of copper and lead, whilst many of the
rocks are similar to those in districts where precious stones are
found.
The last district in which gold has been found is the Mur-
chison, about 250 miles East of Geraldton, at the North end of
Austin’s Lake. This is probably on the same line of country as the
Yilgarn, as the reefs and rocks are very similar; this was found by
Mr. Bush, who is at the present time engaged in testing it.


At the end of 1888 stream tin was found on the Blackwood
river, near Bridgetown, and is now being worked very profitably by
several men, but at present no lode has been found. Tin and silver
are reported to have been found at Pinjarra, and coal on the Don-
nelly river—gold has also been found at Bindoon and Wongan,
about 60 and 80 miles respectively in aN.E, direction from Perth.
Asbestos and mica are also found in many places throughout the
Colony.
Mining and prospecting are as yet quite in their infancy in this
Colony, but from what has been said it will be seen that this Colony
has every prospect of proving to be not far behind the others in
mineral wealth.
No reliable information is obtainable of the quantity of gold
exported during 1888, but it is supposed to have reached nearly
50,000 ozs.
On the three fields of Kimberley, Pilbarra, and Yilgarn there
are engaged about 800 men. Machinery is now being erected at
Kimberley and Pilbarra, which will give employment to many more
miners.
PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL.
The new Land Regulations, which were passed by the Legis-
lative Council in 1886, came into force on the 2nd of March, 1887.
For the purposes of the Regulations, the Colony is divided
into six Divisions :
The South-West Division.
~ Gascoyne
v North-West
Kimberley
Eucla
Eastern
All town and suburban lands in these divisions must be sold
by public auction, at an upset price to be determined by the Gov-
ernor in Council. Any person may apply to the Commissioner to
put up for sale by auction any town or suburban lands already
surveyed, on depositing 10 per cent, of the upset price, which is
returned if he does not become the purchaser; should the pur-
chaser not be the applicant, he must pay 10 per cent, on the fall of
the hammer, and complete his purchase within thirty days.


There are four modes of obtaining land by conditional purchase
in the South-West Division.
1. By deferred payment, with residence within agricuitura
area.
2. By deferred payment, with residence outside agricultural
areas.
3. By deferred payment, without residence.
4. By direct payment, without residence.
Agricultural areas of not less than 2,000 acres may be set
apart by the Governor in Council —the maximum area to be held
by any one person is 1,000 acres, and the minimum 100 acres, the
price is fixed by the Governor in Council, at not less than ten
shillings an acre, which is the present price, payable in 20 yearly
instalments of 6d. an acre, or sooner if the occupier choose. Upon
the approval of any application, a license is granted for five years.
Within six months the licensee must reside on some portion of the
land, and fence in the same with a good substantial fence during
the term of his license. If these conditions are fulfilled, a lease is
granted to him for 15 years. After the lease has expired, provided
the fence is in good order and that improvements have been made
equal to the full purchase money, and further provided the full
purchase money has been paid, a Crown grant will be given.
Outside agricultural areas land may be purchased on deferred
payment with residence, by free selection, otherwise subject to all
the conditions required within agricultural areas, as stated in the
preceding paragraph.
Under the third mode of purchase, the applicant is subject to
all the conditions imposed under No. 1, except residence, but he
has to pay double the price, or =£l per acre, in 20 yearly instalments
of one shilling per acre.
By the fourth mode, land to the extent of 1,000 acres and not
less than 100, within an agricultural area, and not exceeding 5,000
acres outside an agricultural area, may be applied for at a price (at
present ten shillings an acre) to be fixed by the Governor in
Council. Within three years the land must be fenced, and within
five years ss. per acre must be spent on improvements.
For garden purposes small areas of not less than 5 acres nor
more than 20 acres (except in special cases), at 20s. per acre, may be
purchased on the condition that within three years the land shall be
fenced, and one-tenth planted with vines or fruit trees, or vegetables.

In the Kimberley, North-West, G-ascoyne, Eastern, and Eucla
Divisions, special areas for purchase may be set apart of not less
than 5,000 acres. The total quantity to be held by any one person
in a division shall not exceed 5,000 acres, or less than 100 acres.
The price is at present ten shillings an acre, payable in ten years
or sooner.
Upon approval a lease shall issue for 10 years. Within two
years the land must be fenced. At the expiration of the lease, the
fence being in good order, improvement in addition to the fencing
equal to the purchase money having been made, and the purchase
money having been paid, a grant from the Crown will be issued.
Pastoral lands are granted on lease, which gives no right to
the soil or to the timber, and the lands may be reserved, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by the Crown during the lease.
The following are the terms of pastoral leases in the several
divisions; all leases expire on the 31st December, 1907. The rental
named is for every thousand acres.
South- West. —In blocks of not less than 3,000 acres, at 20s.
Reduction of Rent for Stocking.— Any Lessee in the
Kimberley and Eucla Divisions may have a reduction of one-
half the rental due under the Regulations, computed from the Ist
day of January, 1887, for the first 14 years of his lease if, in the
Kimberley Division, he have, within five years of the date of these
Regulations, in his possession within the division 10 head of sheep
or one head of large stock for every thousand acres leased, or in


lieu of stock in the Eucla Division if he have expended =£B per
1,000 acres in tanks, wells, dams, or boring for water.
A penalty of double rental for the remaining portion of the
lease is imposed, except in the South-West Division, if the lessee has
not within 7 years complied with the stocking or improvement
Clause.
Poisoned Land. —Any person desirous of obtaining a lease
of Poisoned land shall apply to the Commissioner, defining the
boundaries and paying one year’s rent at the rate of <£l per
1,000 acres. Within 12 months, a proper survey of the land must
be furnished, at the expense of the applicant, to the Commissioner,
and sufficient proof given that the said land is Poisoned land. If
the application is approved, a lease is granted for 21 years at ,£1
per 1,000 acres, on the condition that the land is fenced in within
three years ; and if the Poison plant is completely eradicated before
the lease expires, the lessee will be entitled to a Crown grant.
Mineral Lands. —Mining leases, not exceeding 200 acres,
nor less than 20 acres, are granted for seven years, at a rental of ss.
per acre per annum, but must be worked within one year. If
the holder has erected, or gives security for the erection of suitable
machinery to work the mine, he may obtain a Crown grant of not
less than twenty acres, at the rate of £3 per acre.
Crops and Stock. —Most of the European grains, fruits, and
vegetables can be cultivated and brought to a high state of per-
fection. The soil in parts is sandy, but even this sand when
irrigated is productive. There is a large extent of light friable soil
suitable for all kinds of crops. The climate, as regards agriculture,
is favorable, although at times subject to bad seasons. The
shortest day is in June, and midsummer comes in December, with
August commences the spring, and the winter begins in April.
Sheep, horses, and cattle thrive well throughout the Colony,
more especially in the Northern parts, where the pasturage is exten-
sive and very nourishing. The great drawback to pastoral industry
in the Southern portion of the Colony is the presence of the poison
plant, rendering a large extent of country useless for this purpose.
This plant does not grow in the Northern parts of the Colony.
The total extent of Crown lands alienated up to the end of
1888 was 1,898,628 acres.
In 1888 there were alienated by sale of town and suburban
lands 347 acres, realising £3,956; and of rural lands 21,236 acres,
realising £2,295,

The total area of the Colony being, as previously stated, about
1,060,000 square miles, or 678,400,000 acres; out of this 1,898,628
acres have been alienated, thus leaving 676,501,372 acres available
for additional occupation for agricultural, pastoral, or other
purposes.
The quantity of land held under Conditional Purchase during
1888 was 372,048 acres.
The acreage of land held for pastoral purposes up to the end
of 1888 was 106,605,171.
The land alienated from the Crown in fee simple during 1888
amounted to 21,583 acres, of which 347 acres were Town and
Suburban lands and 21,236 Eural land.
Under the regulations for leasing land under the poison clauses
there were taken up, in 1888, 74 leases, granting 531264 acres;
making a total of land taken up to the end of 1888,1,408,196 acres.
116 mining leases were granted in 1888, making the total up
to that date 129, comprising 9,311 acres.
Timber licenses in existence at the end of 1888 were 5, giving
the right to cut timber over an area of 202,640 acres, for which the
G-overnment received a rental of £659.
The quantity of land taken up for pastoral purposes has
been gradually decreasing since 1882-3. In those years large areas
of land were taken up in the Northern and Eucla districts, but
owing to the difficulty of stocking them, which in the Kimberley
district was made compulsory by the regulations, a number of
runs were forfeited. About 15,000,000 acres have been forfeited in
the Eucla district.
The estimated acreage of land under cultivation in 1888 was
106,015 acres, as against 105,582 acres in 1887. The increase as
shown therefore was only 433 acres.
The average area under cultivation to each person in the
Colony was nearly 2 51 acres.
The following table shows the extent of land under the
principal crops, viz., wheat, oats, barley, and hay, for the last two
years:—


In 1887 the total quantity of land under vines was 672 acres,
producing an average of 185 gallons of wine to the acre. The
estimated total quantity was 124,240 gallons. In 1888 there were
817 acres under cultivation, producing 124,182 gallons.
Cereals are cultivated to a considerable extent in the Colony
South of Latitude 28°, but not in sufficient quantity to supply
the wants of the inhabitants; the wheat grown in the Colony and
the grain generally is of a superior description. With the large
extent of land available for cultivation, when population has in-
creased and extra facilities for transit are provided, agriculture will
probably greatly increase
The total land in crop, in 1888, was 65,699 acres.
The following is a return showing the production in each
district of the Colony, and its average per acre

None of the above Fruits are produced in sufficient quantities to export
All the Fruits mentioned in the above list are capable of
being produced in large quantities, particularly Grapes and
Oranges; kernel fruits, as Apples, Pears, &c.; stone fruit, as
Peaches, Plums, Apricots, &c.
There are thousands of acres of land which would be suitable
for fruit growing, but it requires capital to develop this industry.
At present the supply of fruit is only sufficient for the wants of
the inhabitants, and until more land is brought under cultivation
by imported labor and capital there will be no fruits exported.
Oranges and Apples are imported into the Colony from
Adelaide, Melbourne, and Tasmania during the time that these
fruits are scarce in the Colony.
Besides the above-named fruits, there are many others which
could be cultivated in the more Northern parts of the Colony, and
others in the Southern.
The Vine grows well anywhere between the Blackwood and
Geraldton. Omitting unsuitable portions, there would be at a low
estimate 5,000 square miles suitable for the growth of the Vine.
The Citrus tribe do well in the same latitude as the Grape, but they

require a moister soil. There is a large extent of gravelly loamy
soil east of the Darling Range, very suitable for the Peach tree, &c.
The cultivation of fruit requires more capital to begin with
than other agriculture, and there are very few in this Colony who
can afford to wait a number of years before they receive any return
for their outlay.
The Olive grows luxuriantly in the South-west portion of the
Colony, but is not cultivated to any extent. Some samples of Oil
manufactured at the Roman Catholic Orphanage, Subiaco, were
exhibited at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition, and received very
favorable mention.
Stock. —Since the discovery of the Northern part of the
Colony and its suitableness for pastoral purposes, and the settle-
ment of the Gascoyne district, pastoral industry has been advanc-
ing rapidly, and Western Australia is fast taking a prominent
place as a producer of wool and live stock.
The stock and crop returns are collected by the police, who at
certain times of the year visit the settlers within their district and
collect from them the information desired. From these reports
the Resident Magistrates of the district furnish their returns.
The number of sheep in most of the districts is ascertained from
the returns which are furnished under the Scab Act.
The following is a return showing the stock in each district of
the Colony up to the end of 1888: —

FOREST RESOURCES.
The Forests from which timber for export is obtained are
situated within the parallels of South Latitude 81° to 35°. The
chief timbers within this area are Jarrah, Karri, Tuart, Whitegum,
Redgum, York-gum, and Sandalwood, extending over an area of
about 30,000 square miles.
Baron Sir Ferd. Yon Mueller, K.C.M.Gr., in the introduction to
his “Report on the Forest Resources of Western Australia,”
writes:—
“ The forest-regions of extra-tropic West Australia occupy an
area equal to the whole territory of Great Britain; and it is
singularly fortunate for the Colony, that over this vast extent of
wooded country a species of Eucalyptus (the Jarrah) prevails
which for the durability of its timber is unsurpassed by any kind
of tree in any portion of the globe. Under such circumstances
the timber resources must be regarded as among the foremost
in importance throughout the wide tracts of West Australia, even
if the many other kinds of utilitarian trees, occurring in the more
southern portion of that colonial territory, and the still more varied
sorts of timber-trees, to be found within the intra-tropic regions
of West Australia, were left out of consideration.”
“ It is furthermore of particular advantage to the Colony that
its highly valuable Jarrah-timber is obtainable through at least
five degrees of geographic latitude, and this within so short or
moderate a distance of shipping places as to render it easily acces-
sible to foreign traffic.”
And with regard to the Jarrah Tree, or West Australian
Mahogany-Eucalypt (Eucalyptus marginata ) :
“ The wood has attained a world-wide celebrity; when especial-
ly selected from hilly localities, cut while the sap is least active, and
subsequently carefully dried, it proves impervious to the borings of
the Chelura, Teredo, and Termites; it is therefore in extensive
demand for jetties, piles, railway sleepers, fence-posts, and all
kinds of underground structures, and it is equally important as one
of the most durable for the planking and frames of ships. It is
also much used locally for flooring, rafters, spars, and furniture;
though hard (particularly that of the ironstone ranges) it is easier
worked than wood of E. loxophleba and E. redunca. The timber
from hills is darker, tougher, and heavier than that from plains.
The weight of well-seasoned wood is, at an average, about sixty-
four pounds for the cubic foot. It is one of the least inflammable
for building structures, and one of the very best in West Australia
for charcoal, not burning so readily into ashes as most kinds of
Eucalyptus-wood. Stems have been measured eighty feet to the


first branch, with a circumference of thirty-two feet at five feet
from the ground. For shingles the wood is doubly as durable as
even that of Casuarina Fraseriana, though it is more ap + somewhat
to warp, if not well selected.”
Also concerning another variety of timber mentioned, Karri
(Eucalyptus diversicolor ) :
“In the humid country at and near the Warren, Shannon,
Donelly, Walpole, and Gardner rivers, towards the coast constitut-
ing forests, occurring also as far east as Mount Manypeak and the
Porongerup, and westward fully to Cape Leeuwin. This gigantic
tree has only one single rival on our island-continent, the Eucalyptus
amygdalina (var. regnans) of South-East Australia, the grand
features of which it completely repeats. Startling accounts of
monster specimen trees are on record, and its maximum height is
certainly not over-estimated at 400 feet. Messrs. Muir measured
stems 300 feet long up to the first limb. When closely growing
the young trees have a very slender stem, so much so, that a tree
180 feet high, and with comparatively but little foliage, may have a
stem not over one foot in diameter. Captain Pemberton Walcott
found the circumference of one particularly gigantic tree to be 60
feet around the base.”
“ Widths of timber of as much as twelve feet can be obtained.
The whitish smooth bark of the huge stems of mast-like straight-
ness impresses a peculiar feature on the Karri-forests, and places this
species into the Leiophloiae of the cortical system. These particu-
lar woodlands not being very accessible our experience of the value
of the timber is still imperfect, but the Karri-timber will become
doubtless important for the lumber trade, whenever the harbours
between King George’s Sound and Cape Leeuwin shall have been
fully opened up for commerce and settlement. The wood is regard-
ed as elastic' and durable, but it is not so easily wrought as that of
E. marginata ; it has proved valuable for shafts, spokes, felloes,
and rails, and is particularly sought for large planks. The writer
has introduced the tree into Victoria, also into South Europe and
North Africa, and to some extent elsewhere, it being easily manage-
able in culture and of comparatively quick growth. Abroad this
species, on account of its huge dimensions, passes very often as
Eucalyptus colossea ; but the name here adopted according to the
laws of priority cannot be changed now; it arose at a time when
the colossal height of E. diversicolor was quite unknown. The
specific name was derived from the paleness of the leaves on the
lower side, unusual among allied species.”
Tuart timber is extremely hard, twisted and curled in the
grain ; it is very valuable where great strength is required for
engine bearers, railway carriages, wheels, etc.
Sandalwood has been largely exported in the past, and con-
tributes largely to the productive industry and profit of the


Colony, but the low prices obtained for it in China affected the
trade for some time. The market, however, is improving and the
shipments increasing. In 1886 the export value of sandalwood
was <£27,450; in 1887, <£34,532, and in 1888, <£33,525.
FISHERIES.
The Fisheries of Western Australia will doubtless, in the
future, be a source of wealth.
Up to the present they have been much neglected ; the number
of species of fish has not been determined, but it is very large.
Chief among the eatable varieties are the Schnapper, King, Jew-
fish, Bream, Taylor, Whiting, Skip-Jack, Mullet, and Herring.
Of crustaceans, there are the Cray-fish, Crab, and Prawn, all
of which are to be obtained in large quantities. The Cray-fish
abounds near the reefs which fringe the islands along the coast;
Crabs and Prawns are principally found in the rivers and estuaries;
Rock Oysters are in great quantity all along the Northern coast of
the Colony, whilst the Mud Oyster is only found at King G-eorge’s
Sound.
All along the coast to the North of latitude 25° South, the Pearl
Oyster abounds, and Pearls and Pearl Shells in considerable quan-
tities are obtained by means of divers and diving dresses.
The export value of Pearls and Pearl Shells in 1888 was
<£80,311.
The only factory in operation for fish preserving, is situate in
the Murray Estuary, about 40 miles south of Fremantle. This
river abounds with fish of all description, but that principally
preserved is the Sea Mullet, which is excellent in flavor, and has
already gained considerable repute in the Colony, where it is largely
consumed.

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
The Supreme Court of the Colony was established in
1861 by the Statute 24th Yict. No. 15. In the year 1880 the
Judicature Act was introduced for the better administration of
justice, and by its provisions the Supreme Court and the Court of
Divorce and Matrimonial causes were united and consolidated
together. The present constitution of the Court is the Chief
Justice and one Judge, provision being made for such other
Judges as Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint.
There is an appeal from the decisions of either Judge to the
Full Court; and the Supreme Court is a Court of Appeal from all
inferior Courts.
There is also an appeal to the Privy Council in cases in-
volving property of not less than <£soo.
The Judges hold a Circuit when so empowered by Com
mission.
The Sheriff has jurisdiction over all the Colony, and is per-
manently appointed by the Governor.
Courts of Quarter Sessions are held in the districts of Albany,
Bunbury, Geraldton, Roebourne, Derby, and Wyndham, the
Government Resident being the Chairman.
Police Courts are held in all the districts. In Perth and
Fremantle they are presided over by a Police Magistrate, and in
the country districts by Stipendiary Magistrates. They sit
daily, and deal with all offences against persons and property.
Small Debts Courts are held monthly to hear and determine
claims where the amount does not exceed <£loo.
The Prison at Fremantle has been lately taken over from
the Imperial Government, and was formerly the Convict Estab-
lishment. There are, besides, eight common Gaols situated in the
country districts, where prisoners are kept awaiting trial or under-
going short sentences.
The business transacted in the Supreme Court in its civil


jurisdiction, and in the Supreme Court office, during 1888, was as

RELIGION AND EDUCATION.
The general Revenues of the Colony contributed in 1888 the
sum of £3,543 for the maintenance of ministers of religion, which
was apportioned to each denomination according to the numbers at
the last census, the proportion received by each having been as
follows:—Church of England £2,075, Church of Rome £1,073,
Wesleyans <£265, and Presbyterians £l2B.
The following is a statement of the number of Churches and
other buildings used for Public Worship.
Education.
The High School was established under a special Act, the 40th
Viet. No. 8; this Act was amended by 42 Yict. No. 28. These enact-
ments provide for the endowment of the school out of the general
Revenue—upon a sliding scale —the minimum being fixed at £5OO
per annum ; when that is arrived at, the Government contribute
further toward its maintenance by a sum equal to double the
school fees received in any one year, provided such contribution
does not exceed £5OO.
The Governors of the school, of whom three are elected by the
Legislature, and four appointed by the Governor, have power to
purchase land and buildings for the purposes required under the
Act, and to make by-laws and regulations for the management of
the school.
The education given is exclusively secular, and the Head
Master must be a graduate of some recognised University; minis-
ters of religion are excluded.
Provision is also made whereby the Masters may be required
to take in pupils as boarders upon certain terms.
All accounts of the school are once a year audited by the


Auditor General, and an annual report of the condition and pros-
pects of the school laid before the Legislative Council.
The Government University Exhibition, granted yearly, which
is tenable for three years and of the value of <£loo for each of the
three years, is open to any boy between the ages of 16 and 18 years
whose parents are residents of the Colony, and who himself shall
have resided two years in the Colony.
All competitors must pass an examination, in which he must
gain not less than two-thirds of the full marks. The successful
candidate must within 12 months gain admission to the University
either of London, Sydney, Melbourne, Oxford, or Cambridge.
In 1888 there were 40 boys on the roll.
The Receipts in 1888 amounted to £1,386 18s. Od.
The Elementary Education Act came into force on the 17th
August, 1871. It is administered by a Central Board called “ The
Central Board of Education,” consisting of five members, one of
whom is the Colonial Secretary, who acts as Chairman. District
Boards are also elected, consisting of five members. The members
of these Boards are elected by the electors having qualifications to
vote for members of the Legislature.
There are two classes of Schools under this Act, viz., purely
Government Schools, which are strictly undenominational, and
Assisted Schools, which may be conducted by any religious body,
but are otherwise subject to the conditions of the Act.
The Government Schools, as the term implies, are entirely
supported by State aid. The teachers are paid a fixed salary,
which is computed in the month of January on the previous year’s
average attendance at each School, according to a scale as per By-
Law No. 41, and this fixed salary is supplemented by results, the
amount being decided by an examination by the Inspectors half-
yearly, but the total expenditure for the teaching staff is not to
exceed £3 10s. per head per annum on the average attendance.
The teaching in these Schools is purely secular, no religious
dogmas are allowed to be taught, but the Bible is read for half-an-
hour to such children who do not object to attend, but “without
comment.”
The Assisted Schools are sectarian, and receive State aid, the
total amount of which with results is not to exceed £1 15s. per


head on the annual average attendance, and hitherto it has not
reached that sum.
The Central Board fix the scale of fees to be paid by children
attending purely Grovernment Schools, and these fees, together
with the amounts arising from the sale of books, are devoted to the
upkeep of the Schools, repairs and erection of new buildings. In
1888 the total amount received for fees and sales was —
£ s. d.
Fees 1469 1 2
Sales 425 0 6
Total 1894 1 8
and the whole of it was expended in the erection of new buildings.
In the Assisted Schools the Educational Department have no
control over the fees. The managers may charge what they like,
and appropriate them to any purpose they think proper.
In 1888 there were 77 Grovernment Schools, having an average
daily attendance of 2,533, as against 2,508 in 1887.
The average attendance of scholars throughout the Grovern-
ment Schools of the Colony was 2,533, and the number on the rolls
3,262, comprising 1,761 males and 1,501 females.
The cost per head was <£3 ss. 7|d,

ACCUMULATION.
There are five Banking institutions in the Colony, viz., the
Western Australian Bank, which was established in Perth in 1843,
with a nominal capital of £20,000, since increased to £60,000; this
Bank has been successful in its operations. It has branches at Fre-
mantle, Geraldton, and Bunbury, and is now paying a dividend of
20 per cent.
In 1866 the National Bank of Australasia opened in Perth,
and has branches at Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, and Northam,
its paid up capital being £1,000,000; the last dividend was 15 per
cent.
In 1878 the Union Bank of Australia, Limited, started
branches in Perth, York, Albany, and Geraldton, and has since
opened at Fremantle and Roebourne, the paid up capital being
£1,500,000; the last dividend declared was 12 per cent.
In 1884 the Bank of New South Wales began business in the
Colony, with branches at Perth and Fremantle; its paid up
capital is £1,250,000, the dividend paid being 17| per cent.
In 1887 the Commercial Bank of Australia, having a capital
of £1,000,000, started a branch office in Perth. As it does not (as
yet) issue notes here, its returns have not been published; and the
Banking records of the Colony are consequently incomplete.
