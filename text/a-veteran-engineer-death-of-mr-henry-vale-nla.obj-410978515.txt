A VETERAN ENGINEER.
DEATH OF MR. HENRY VALE.
By the death of Mr. Henry Vale, at Ohery,
The Boulevard, Strathfield, on Tuesday, the
State has lost one of its pioneer engineers.
He was founder of the firm of Henry Vale and
Sons, engineers, of Auburn, Sydney.
The late Mr. Vale was born at London in
1835, and arrived at Sydney 20 years later.
He had acquired a knowledge of engineering
from his father, to whom he was apprenticed,
and shortly after his arrival he accepted an
appointment in the Railway Department as
engineer in the locomotive branch. In 1865
he commenced business with a partner in
Druitt-street. The firm, which was known
as Vale and Lacy, built the first locomotive
ordered In the State, and also manufactured
the first locomotive engines for the New
South Wales Government. Upon the death of
his partner Mr. Vale shifted the works to
Pyrmont, and several years later removed to
Auburn, where the firm of Henry Vale and
Sons was established on its present site. In
1905 he retired from active participation in
the business, which was then acquired by his
sons, Messrs. H. J. and P. J. Vale. The re-
mainder of Mr. Vale’s life was spent in retire-
ment at his Strathfield” home, where he took
a considerable interest in poultry breeding.
The late Mr. Vale was married in 1859, and is
survived by his two sons, three daughters
having predeceased him. The funeral was
held privately yesterday morning at Rook-
wood, and was attended only by his immediate
relatives. Rev. J. W. Ferrier conducted the
services.
