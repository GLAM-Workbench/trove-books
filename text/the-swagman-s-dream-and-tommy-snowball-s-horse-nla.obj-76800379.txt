THE SWAGMAN?S DREAM.
Away back upon the Murrumbidgee,
May always be seen ever wandering on,
The poor and lonely, and homeless swagman,
His pleasures are short, but his journey?s long.
"Tis there you might see him upon an evening,
After perhaps his day?s walk is o?er,
Lighting a fire and boiling his billy,
And thinking perhaps of the days of yore.
His evening meal having partaken,
Into the future he?ll venture to peep,
He?ll make up his bed with his old blanket,
And lay himself down, gently to sleep.
He dreams a nice dream of his boyhood days,
He?s wandering again on the Yorkshire moors,
He?s home once again in dear old England,
Drinking the pleasures of its country tours.
He?s home again in that dear country cottage,
His Father, Mother, and Sister is there,
Their smiles are so kindly, their ways so loving,
His Sister?s so gentle so kind and so fair.
He also sees his dear little Brothers,
They course round the garden, now pluck the flowers,
The air is perfumed with the sweet odour,
From the carnations and sweet summer showers.
He?s wandering again, it?s evening, twilight,
He?s out in the fields, in the new mown hay,
His playmates are there, they?er all making Haycocks,
And rolling each-other in innocent play.
But, the scene has shifted, he?s now a young man,
Out with his sweetheart in the country lanes,
They hear the Skylark make sweet music,
And see the rainbow, sign of summer rains.
He places his arm round her waist so gently,
And tells her of love that?s honest and true,
The Maiden then kissed him, a sweet loving kiss,
That Emanates from a sweet Maiden?s virtue
They walk on and walk on, She plucking Flowers,
They see pretty Farms in the distant scene,
They laugh and they talk of sweet little nothings,
Of things they have done and things they have seen.
Her Eyes they are Blue, they?er Bright, they?er laughing,
Her cheeks are as Red as the Rose newly grown,
Her breath is as sweet as the scent from the Flowers,
As sweet as the scent from the hay newly mown.


But, Alas! these visions gradually vanish,
These Harmonious Pictures gently pass,
And musical sounds from the bush awake him,
�Tis the song of the Bird, the Laughing-Jackass.
*Tis early Morn, an Australian Summer,
And over head hangs a lovely Blue Sky,
He rolls up his Blanket, and makes up his Swag,
As he does so a tear steals into his Eye.
Onward, Onward, he is ever marching,
He is a world?s actor and plays his part,
He may be poor and wear shabby clothing,
He?s Human, he?s a man with a tender heart.
TOMMY SNOWBALL?S HORSE.
Tommy Snowball bought a Horse,
It was a Fine horse too,
He said ?that He had got some work,
For a horse to do.?
He bought the horse at a bazaar,
For which he paid one pound,
There was no finer horse I?m sure,
In Sydney could be found.
Its head of course was in the front,
And Its tail behind,
It had Four Legs and One Eye,
The other Eye was blind.
Its Figure and Its Form was fine
With such a grand bold front,
It had no hair upon Its tail,
It only was a stump.
Now, Tommy took this fine horse home,
A stable did have He,
And brushed It down with brush and comb,
Eight funny for to see.
He?d never had a real live horse
All to Himself before,
Which made the horse when It was groomed,
Wonder, more and more.


What ever in the world this man?s
Brushing and combing meant,
To some great show perhaps he thought,
He was going to be sent.
The horse was rather an elderly one,
Its price will that proclaim,
Its stumpy tail and without hair,
Its flowing and shaggy mane.
Now, Tommy bought an ancient Trap,
Harness to match likewise,
To take his Mother in the Park,
To ride for exercise.
Now, Tommy's Mother, Dear old soul,
She too had but one Eye,
And when she saw the half blind horse,
She felt that she could cry.
But, thus she reasoned to her son,
In Language plain and true,
?HI ride in the Centennial park,
In the trap aside of you.
As I am blind on my right side,
The horse in Its left Eye,
It won?t be seen we both are blind,
By Folks that we pass by.?
So when the following Sunday came,
It being such a Fine Day,
They harnessed-up their One-eyed-Horse,
And started blith and gay.
She had on her Sunday best,
A bonnet that was grand,
The Youth had on a white straw Hat,
A new whip in his hand.
Crack went the whip away they went, *
And all of them seemed pleased,
The horse?s tail was up-ward turned,
Some Forty-five degrees.
They started off at a nice trot,
The horse used all his power,
And through Centennial Park they went,
About three miles an hour.
They drove around the Park and When,
Near the Refreshment Booth,
The horse came to a dead stand-still,
They oould not get a move,


The Park being full of Cyclists,
They did come all around,
The horse and trap to gaze upon,
To see what had been found.
One bold Young Man without much sense,
Thought He would have some fun,
He said ?perhaps Its Hypnotised,
Its sands are almost run?.
He walked around the horse and trap,
His Cycle by his side,
Before the horse he then did stand.
Laughing with scorn and pride.
Ah, boastful man of impudence,!
At others you make fun, 4
Perhaps you?ll laugh the other way,
Before my tale is done.
For some-one pricked the poor old horse,
But this he did not like,
He took one jump, a good one too,
Right in the young man?s bike.
So now you see the laughing part,
Was all the other way,
At other Folks to laugh and scoff,
Does not always pay.
To free his bike, now, from the horse,
Though willing hands was lent,
It took some time to free the bike,
When freed was twist and bent.
Now, after this the horse moved off,
And passed the young man by.
And as he did I thought I saw,
A twinkle in his Eye.
The bold young man was left behind,
His broken bike to mourn,
Lets hope that he, so bold won?t be,
The next time he doth roam.
