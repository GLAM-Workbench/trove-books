BY
REGINALD A. PREVOST
ARCHITECT
SYDNEY:
THE V.S.W. BOOHS TALL CO. LTD.
1912.


PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.
/ "J y HIS book has been published to provide those who may be thinking of
building homes with a variety of plans and elevations, from which a
selection may be made or a suggestion borrowed.
The old saw says that “the man who is his own lawyer has a fool for a
client,” and those who build houses without expert advice often pay dearly
for the privilege. As all the designs contained herein have been drawn by
an experienced Architect, they may be relied upon as thoroughly practical,
and the approximate costs have been made up from present-day prices.
The modest week-end bungalow at £250 has been as thoughtfully planned as
the comfortable suburban home at £1250, with intermediate prices to meet
most requirements. But just as circumstances alter cases, so sites often
alter costs, and, when consulting these plans, the position of the prospective
residence must be taken into account, and due allowance made for extra
foundations or difficult situations. Again, it is not to be expected that these
approximate costs shall hold good when building conditions may be distinctly
adverse to economical construction.
All these designs have been made subservient to local climatic conditions,
and are intended to foster a style of architecture in keeping with the hygienic
open-air life that obtains in Australia.

Ironing with a “ O.E. Electric Iron ” bani-
shes the hot, dirty and bothersome stove,
and the oppressive, vitiated atmosphere of
the laundry. It saves countless steps and
precious energy. It requires from one-
half to two-thirds the time to do the
ironing; involves no irksome features; it
insures a continuously hot iron, which
literally “floats” over the work.

Crushing Arguments
BEFORE you build one of the beautiful homes illustrated in this book, you
must have the land, and to be in keeping it must be nicely situated amidst
picturesque and convenient surroundings. We have land to offer in all the
most beautiful suburbs, and farm properties, large and small, of all kinds, in the
best paying districts in the State.
On our famous Easy Terms you can commence to get the
land on payment of a purely nominal amount, with very easy in-
stalments for the balance. At this moment, therefore, you thus hold
a home in the hollow of your hand, and it is wonderful how short
a time it is, once the start is made, when you are residing in your
own home.
m
On your holidays and week-ends you can combine money
making with merry making, as at Australia’s two finest seaside
resorts, viz., STAN WELL PARK on the South Coast, and AVOCA
on the North Coast, we can provide you not only with land to pur-
chase and hold for certain increase, but with nice furnished cot-
tages, or with the most fashionable and elegant accommodation by
the day, week or month.
Land also at Hawkesbury, Woy Woy, Middle Harbour, and all the other
Popular Holiday Places.
To nearly all of our Estates our wonderfully popular and liberal fine INSURANCE CLAUSE applies,
under which, should you die after half the purchase money Is paid, the land Is considered as fully
paid for, or, if less than half Is paid, the amounts paid will be refunded If required.

Dear Mr. Rowlandson,
Yes, your Bungalow Book should sell.
Home lovers who desire to “Own a Home of their Own ” are many and your
book should give them a vision of something they may like — but, here is the danger,
if they endeavour to build without expert advice they will make a grave mistake.
My Magazine “BUILDING ” has from its inception shown the proper way to go
about “Owning a Home of your Own ” and thousands of satisfied home lovers testify
to the good advice it has given them that their home must be built with brains as
well as with brick or stone.
The now National Gospel of “Own a Home of your Own ” was first made public
in my “BUILDING ” Magazine and its circulation has consequently increased
remarkably.
As you know, your own bookstalls sell a con-
siderable number each month, because at its price,
one shilling per month, or by post ten shillings per year t
it has saved hundreds of pounds to “Prospective Home \
Builders. "
No person should attempt to build without expert
advice and in the current issues there are some valuable
Hints to Home Builders in “PLAIN TALK WHEN
YOU BUILD.” It deals with the whole question from
selecting the site to furnishing the finished home.
Yours truly,
-^eciqe
Editor.

BUNGALOW WITH PABCO ROOF.
The famous Californian Bunga-
lows were originated and practi-
cally made by MALTHOID roofs.
They are now spreading all over
the world. Nothing could be
more suitable to the Australian
climate. MALTHOID is made
with the pure mineral which we
have used for 28 years, and
PABCO is our latest manufac-
ture. The waterproofness of
Pabco and Malthoid allows any
roof design which may be
desired, especially a flat slope.
PABCO

IS ASBESTOS-COATED
MALTHOID
and its non-conducting properties ensure a truly normal shade temperature. It enables you to
have the flat slope or hip to your roof, which is so effective and so greatly admired in
Bungalow Roofing, and which is not usually practicable with other materials.
MALTHOID is far superior to shingles,
iron, slates or tiles for roofing. It may
also be used for bathroom floors, saving
75% on the cost of lead.
