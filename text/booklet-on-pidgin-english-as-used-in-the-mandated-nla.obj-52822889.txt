PREFACE
With that restless feeling that all soldiers experience
after returning from Active Service, after the Great War,
the Author turned his footsteps towards New Guinea in
search of new adventure and as the result of twenty odd
years experience this book has been compiled.
The search for gold led him to all part of New Guinea
involving a close study of the natives, their customs and
their language.
Even after the various skirmishes the Author has had
with them, he has been able to return to the disaffected
area and make friends with them. This was mainly through
being able to talk to them.
The natives are inclined to treat with scorn a white
man who cannot talk to them, their idea being that white
men taught them this language and here are white men
who cannot speak it.
The book is presented in the hope that it will be the
means of saving many valuable lives and lightening the
burden of the soldier, in his valiant efforts to regain our
country for us.
THE AUTHOR.




ORIGIN OF PIDGIN ENGLISH
New Guinea Pidgin English originated in a peculiar
way. The Germans who originally occupied New Guinea,
endeavoured to teach the natives to speak German as it
was impossible to learn the numerous native dialects.
The natives could not master the gutteral sounds and
the Germans who knew very little English, taught them
the various English names of the articles they were using.
As new implements, etc., were used, it was natural,
that to explain quickly what was required, to liken it to
something that they already knew the name of, for instance,
one of the first things the natives knew the name of was an
axe (AKIS) and so an adze became an axe to straighten
timber. (AKIS BELONG STRAIGHT IM DEWAI).
To differentiate between the various types of vehicles
the name of the animal that drew them was added such
as (CARRIAGE HORSE, CARRIAGE DONKEY, CARRIAGE
BULL-A-MA-KAU).
Take the last word BULL-A-MA-KAU. The first cattle
to be brought to New Guinea were a bull and a cow and
as the Germans always referred to them as such, the name
for cattle became BULL-A-MA-KAU with the sex added
such as MAN or MARY.
When you are stuck for a pidgin word to describe any-
thing, think of what it is used for and use the word
SOMETHING for its name and state its use. For instance,
a stud is used to fasten your collar, therefore, a request
to a native to BRING IM SOMETHING BELONG PASS
IM NECK (collar) would have the effect of a native pro-
ducing a stud.
The instances given here apply throughout the
language and if this is kept in mind, the reader will be
able to carry on a conversation with the natives in a very
short time.


FOREWORD
It is an axiom of war, that an invader who can
speak the language of the country invaded, has the battle
half won.
The natives of New Guinea, who in the main will be
found friendly, are very vindictive and will vent their
wrath on any white man who rouses their enmity. There-
fore, study the “DONT’S” contained in this book. It is of
great importance that the natives should remain friendly.
Remember, the natives speak very quickly, and should
the natives conversation not be understood, tell him to
speak slowly, by using the following phrase:—
ENGLISH.
You are speaking too quickly,
I cannot understand you!
PIDGIN.
Me no har im good, you
talk easy.
Having regard to difference of pronunciation of some
members of the Forces, the strict phonetic spelling of the
Pidgin has not been adhered to, as it is considered more
simple to understand in the form presented.

DON’T DO THESE THINGS.
Lean Up Against a Coconut Palm. Look up first. A dry
nut might be ready to fall and would seriously injure you
if it should hit you.
Interfere With Native Women. They might be found will-
ing parties but will spread the news of the affair so as to
arouse the jealousy of their husbands. This would mean
death or hindrance to the next white man passing that way
Interfere With Village Pigs. This would be nearly as bad
as interfering with the women.
Drink Stagnant Water. This would lead to an attack of
dy sentry.
Drink Water from a Native Bamboo Container. The inside
of these are filthy and, usually contain particles of fer-
mented food. Have your own container filled from running
water.
Forget to Take Quinine. Take the daily prophylactic dose
of five grains and disregard anything you are told to the
contrary. Sometimes small quantities are found in the
native villages in charge of a Dr. Boy.
Walk With the Slightest Irritation in Your Boot. Stop and
take it out.
Forget to Inspect Your Legs and Feet Each Night. The
slightest abrasion or cut can develop into a tropical ulcer
within twenty-four hours. Pay great attention to this and
treat any cut at once.
Try to Walk Too Far in One Day. No advantage is gained
and you will find that the carriers will desert you during the
night if you do so.
Try to Travel at Night. The progress you would make would
not be commensurate with the risk of injury.
Be the First to Walk Across a Stream Near the Coast. The
natives see crocodiles very quickly. Have one of the natives
walk in front of you.
Try to Swim a Flooded River. Wait. The rivers rise and
fall very quickly.


Fraternise too Much With the Natives. They quickly become
contemptuous of a person doing this.
Pay More Than a Reasonable Price for Anything. The
highest price a native receives becomes the minimum. The
next man coming that way might not have the wherewithal.
Fail to Pay the Agreed Price. This would cause the natives
to refuse to sell to the next person.
Allow the Natives to Get Too Far Ahead When Walking.
There might be a catch in it. Keep your carriers all
together.
Forget to Count the Number of Natives You Start With.
You might have to pay twice as many as necessary and on
the other hand, some might have gone ahead to give
information.
Tell the Natives Where There Are Other White Men. They
love gossip. Let them tell you.
Allow the Natives to Speak in Their Own Language. Make
them speak pidgin. They might be arranging something to
your disadvantage.
Throw Away Any Article of Accoutrement. Unwanted goods
can be used for the purchase of food.
Forget That the Natives Can Tell Lies. Try to make sure
they are telling the truth before moving on.
Allow the Natives to Come and Greet You With Spears in
Hand. They will put them down if told to do so.
Lead the Party at Any Stage. The tracks are narrow and
should anything start it will give you a chance to get away.
Allow Your Carriers to Wander About in a Strange Village.
They are born thieves and will probably steal something to
cause you trouble with the local kanakas.
Lose This Book. It might save your life.

GENERAL HINTS ON THE CARRIAGE OF GOODS BY
NATIVE CARRIERS.
The average load for a carrier is forty pounds. They
can carry more but experience proves that this is the most
satisfactory load.
Have your packs ready at the starting point the night
before. The natives work better if they can start at daylight.
Always have the packs placed in a line about two paces
apart and call the natives into line opposite the pack each
one is to carry. They can then move off simultaneously and
the goods will not be pilfered.
Write down the names of the natives who are carrying
for you. It impresses the native who feels a certain duty
towards you once his name has been written in a book.
Don’t pay carriers before you start, or in the middle
of the journey. Pay when the cargo has been delivered.
If you do you will probably lose both the cargo and the
native.


If only one white man accompanies the carriers walk
behind them, if more then the white men should be inter-
spersed with the natives. One white man should always
be last.
Keep your carriers together. If the line strings out too
much the cargo might be pilfered.
When resting, turn the part of the pack that has been
nearest the native’s skin to the sun.
Always take your meal a good distance away from the
packs. The sweat on the packs from the natives attracts
numerous blow flies.
Should a native leave his pack on the track and retire
to the bush for natural purposes wait for him and keep him
in sight all the time. They use this ruse when they are
going to abscond.
Always supervise the distribution of the natives food.
The cook’s friends will get the greater part of it if you don’t.
Remember the natives think through their stomach.
Feed them well and you will save yourself a lonely walk.
They will run away if not well fed.
Once a carriers pack has been eaten, do not take him
any further. It makes a big difference to the amount of
cargo you will deliver at the end of the journey.
Always have your own bed packed on the most reliable
native. If you lose this you will not sleep. A mosquito net
is nearly as essential as food.
Punish a native who interferes with a native woman
in a foreign village. It will settle the trouble on the spot
and the natives will appreciate and assist you.
Don’t bring the packs into the house where you are
sleeping before sundown. The blow flies (Lung) will come
with them if you do.
Remember the native is a heavy sleeper and is most
unreliable on watch. Have a look every hour or so.
Retain the Natives’ Friendship, another white man com-
ing after you might need their assistance.
