PREFACE.
In the past each Australian State Eoad Authority has developed
and used its own standard design specifications for highway
bridges. These specifications differed in one or more respects.
In 1949 the Conference of State Eoad Authorities, on the
advice of its Principal Technical Committee, resolved that
uniform standards of design should be prepared.
In the preparation of the uniform Highway Bridge Design
Specification all State Eoad Authorities and the Common-
wealth Department of Works were represented. The specifica-
tion has been based upon that of the American Association of
State Highway Officials (A.A.5.H.0.). The Conference of
State Eoad Authorities is indebted to the American Associa-
tion for the help obtained from its publication and research,
and wishes to record appreciation of the Association’s ready
agreement to the inclusion in this Australian specification of
many paragraphs which, in essentials at least, form part of
the A.A.S.H.O. Handbook.
The specification is now issued by the Conference of State
Eoad Authorities of Australia for the use and guidance of all
concerned in the design of Australian road bridges.
Sydney, 1953.




SECTION 1.—GENERAL FEATURES OF DESIGN.
Design Analysis.
In any case where the specifications provide for an empirical
formula as a design convenience, a rational analysis based on
a theory accepted by the Bridge Design Committee of the
State Road Authorities Australia with stresses in accordance
with the specifications will be considered as compliance with the
specifications.
3.l.l—Determination of Waterway Area.
For the determination of the waterway area to be provided
by any drainage structure, a careful study shall be made of
local conditions, including flood height, flow and frequency,
size and performance of other openings in the vicinity carrying
the same stream, characteristics of the channel and of the
watershed area, climatic conditions, available rainfall records
and any other information pertinent to the problem and likely
to affect the safety or economy of the structure.
For culverts and small bridges, waterway formulas or drain-
age tables may be used to assist in fixing the proper size of
opening. The use of such formulas or tables is justified only
to the extent that they are known to fit local conditions. How-
ever, their use shall serve merely as a guide and shall not
obviate the need for careful field observations and the exercise
of intelligent judgment.
In general the waterway provided shall be sufficient to insure
the discharge of flood waters without undue backwater head
and at a velocity which will not increase the erosive action of
the stream to such an extent as to endanger the structure.


3.1.2 Restricted Waterways.
When it is necessary to restrict the waterway to such an
extent that the stream will be discharged at erosive velocities,
protection against damage due to scour shall be afforded by
deep foundations, curtain or cut-off walls, riprap, stream-bed
paving, bearing piles, sheet piles, or other suitable means. Like-
wise, embankment slopes adjacent to all structures subject to
erosion shall be adequately protected by riprap, brush mattresses,
tree retards, wing dams, or other suitable construction.
3.1.3 Channel Openings.
Particular attention should be paid to the requirements of
various authorities controlling streams and navigable waters.
In general the clear width of all openings and the clear
vertical distance between the superstructure and the highest
flood water of which there are records or other authentic
evidences shall be sufficient for the passage, without damage
to the structure, of the largest drift or debris which may be
expected. Where a low-level bridge is to be built every precau-
tion should be taken to minimise damage to the structure by
debris and flooding.
3.1.4 Pier Spacing and Location.
Piers shall be located in such a manner as to meet the above
specified requirements for channel openings. They shall be
located so as to afford the minimum restriction of the water-
way, especially in the main stream channel. In general, piers
shall be placed as nearly parallel with the direction of the
stream current as is practicable, due consideration being given
to the velocity and direction of current at both ordinary and
highwater stages, so as to avoid such deflections of the current
as might prove destructive to the foundations of the structure
or to the adjacent stream banks.
3.1.5 Size of Culvert Openings.
In general, culverts shall be proportioned to carry the maxi-
mum flood discharge without head. If the maximum flood
discharge occurs only at rare intervals, culverts may be


designed to carry it under slight head, provided they are
protected against undermining by means of adequate pavement
and apron or cut-off walls and that adjacent embankments are
protected from erosion by riprap or other suitable means.
3.l.6—Length of Culverts.
The length of culverts shall be sufficient to provide the full
required width of roadway or the required width of embank-
ment at the top. The assumed slope of the embankment shall
be suitable for the particular filling material and shall be
such as to eliminate any tendency for the embankment slopes
to slip or slide.
/
3.l.l —Width of Roadway and Footway.
The width of roadway shall be the clear width measured
at right angles to the longitudinal centre line of the bridge
between the bottoms of kerbs or guard-timbers or, in the case
of multiple height kerbs, between the bottoms of the lower
risers.
The width of the footway shall be the clear width, measured
at right angles to the longitudinal centre line of the bridge,
from the extreme inside portion of the handrail to top of the
face of the kerb or guard timber, except that if there is a truss,
girder, or parapet wall adjacent to the roadway kerb, the width
shall be measured to its extreme walk side portion.
3.l.B—Clearances.
The horizontal clearance shall be the clear width, and the
vertical clearance the clear height, available for the passage
of vehicular traffic.

All
Full formation if length of
structure along road centre-line
not greater than 10 feet: other-
wise as for a bridge.
The width between kerbs shall generally be 4 feet greater than
the pavement width needed to meet anticipated traffic
requirements.
However, where traffic is less than 100 vehicles a day, single-
lane bridges may be used having a width between kerbs not
less than 12 feet; a greater width may be desirable where there
is stock and machinery movement, depending on local
conditions.
The width between kerbs of culverts with deck at road
level should be in accordance with the following table:—
(1) Traffic Density refers to anticipated traffic. For general
purposes this shall be assumed to be twice the present traffic
density.
(2) Unless specific approval is obtained, no permanent type
of bridge on any road shall be less than 20 feet between kerbs.
In addition, widening of a bridge on a horizontal curve
shall be provided in accordance with the standard practice of
the authority for highway construction.


Vertical clearances shall be at least 15 feet over the full
width between kerbs, but where there is no reasonable alter-
native route, this shall be increased over the central 12 feet
6 inches of roadway to 17 feet 6 inches.
3.1.9 Kerbs and Safety Kerbs.
(a) Kerbs. —The face of the roadway kerb is defined as the
sloping- or vertical surface on the roadway side of the kerb.
Horizontal measurements of the roadway and kerb widths are
given from the bottom of the face, or, in the case of stepped
back kerbs, from the bottom of the lower face for roadway
widths.
The face of the roadway kerb shall be not less than 9 inches
from the nearest portion of the fence or handrail for concrete
structures, or 8 inches for timber structures, and not less than
12 inches from any portion of any structural member above the
elevation of the fence.
The kerb height shall be not less than 8 inches above the
adjacent finished surface of the roadway.
( b ) Safety Kerbs. —Kerbs widened to provide for occasional
pedestrian traffic shall be designated “Safety Kerbs”. The
width of such kerbs shall be not less than 18 inches measured
from the face of the kerb to the inside face of any fence
handrail.
3.1.10 Railings.
Substantial railings along each side of the bridge shall be
provided for the protection of traffic. Consideration shall be
given to the architectural features of the railing to obtain
proper proportioning of its various members and harmony with
the structure as a whole. Consideration shall be given to
avoiding, as far as consistent with safety and appearance, any
obstruction of the view from passing vehicles.
In general, railings shall be of two classes, as follows:
(1) Roadway railings,
(2) Footway railings.
Roadway railings shall have a minimum height of 3 feet
above the roadway adjacent to the kerb.
Where a footway is provided, the minimum height of railings
on the outside fence shall be 3 feet 3 inches above the adjacent
footway level. Clear openings shall be proportioned with due
regard to the safety of persons using the structure. When
the top of the kerb is more than 2 feet in width, the provisions
for footway railings shall apply.


FIGURE. 1(A)


FIGURE 1(B)


Provision shall be made for the expansion and contraction
of railings consistent with the design.
3.1.11 Roadway Drainage.
The transverse drainage of roadways shall be secured by
means of a suitable crown in the roadway surface and longi-
tudinal drainage by camber or gradient. If necessary, longi-
tudinal drainage shall be secured by means of scuppers, inlets
or other suitable means, which shall be of sufficient size and
number to drain the gutters adequately. If drainage fixtures
and downspouts are required, the downspouts shall be of rigid,
corrosive-resistant material not less than 4 inches in least
dimension, provided with suitable clean-out fixtures. The
details of floor drains shall be such as to prevent the discharge
of drainage water against any portion of the structure. Over-
hanging portions of concrete .floors, preferably, shall be provided
with drip beads.
3.1.12 Superelevation.
The superelevation and widening of the floor surface of a
bridge on a horizontal curve shall be provided in accordance
with the standard practice of the authority for the highway
construction, except that the superelevation shall not exceed
0.10 feet per foot width of roadway.
3.1.13 Floor Surfaces.
All bridge floors shall have non-skid characteristics.
3.1.14 Blast Protection.
On bridges over steam railroad tracks, metal likely to be
injured by locomotive gases, and concrete surfaces less than
20 feet above the tracks, shall be protected by blast plates. The
blast plate shall be placed, laterally, so that the centre is
on a line normal to the plane of the two rails at the centre
line of the track, thus taking into account the direction of
blast due to superelevation. The plates shall be not less than
4 feet wide and shall consist of wrought-iron, east-iron, a cor-
rosion and blast-resisting alloy or asbestos-board shields, so
supported that they may be readily replaced.
3.1.15 Utilities.
Where required, or where anticipated to be required, provision
shall be made for trolley wire supports and poles, pillars for
lights, electric conduits, telephone conduits, water pipes and
gas pices.


3.1.16 — Roadway Width, Kerbs and Clearances for Tunnels.
These dimensions shall be determined in accordance with the
existing practice of each State Authority.
3.1.17 Roadway Width, Kerbs and Clearances for Depressed
Roadways
These dimensions shall be determined in accordance with the
existing practice of each State Authority.
3.1.18 Roadway Width, Kerbs and Clearances, Underpasses
(Undivided Highways).
(a) Widths: The clear distance between the walls or columns
shall be not less than 3 feet greater than the width between
kerbs as specified for bridges with a minimum of 27 feet.
The clear width between kerbs, if used, shall be not less than
that specified for bridges with a minimum of 24 feet.
( b ) Vertical Clearance: Vertical clearance shall be as speci-
fied for bridges.
(c) Kerbs: Kerbs, if used, shall not be less than 18 inches
in width. The height of kerbs shall be as specified for bridges.
SECTION 2. —LOADS.
3.2.l—Loads.
Structures shall be proportioned for the following loads and
forces when they exist; —
(1) Dead load.
(2) Live load.
(3) Impact or dynamic effect of the live load.
(4) Wind loads.
(5) Other forces, when they exist, as follows:
Longitudinal force, centrifugal force, thermal forces,
earth pressure, buoyancy, shrinkage stresses, rib
shortening, erection stresses, ice and current pressure,
and earthquake stresses.
Members shall be proportioned as specified under Stresses,
Section 4.
Upon the stress sheets a diagram or notation of the assumed
live loads shall be shown and the stresses due to the various
loads shall be shown separately.


3.2.2—Dead Load.
The dead load shall consist of the weight of the structure
complete, including the roadway, footways and tram tracks,
pipes, conduits, cables and other public utility services.
If a separate wearing surface is to be placed when the bridge
is constructed, or if placement of a separate wearing surface is
anticipated in the future by the authority, adequate allowance
shall be made for its weight in the design dead load. Other-
wise provision for a future wearing surface is not required.
Where abrasion of concrete is not anticipated the traffic
may bear directly on the concrete slab. If considered desirable,
\ inch or more may be added to the slab for a wearing surface.
The following weights are to be used in computing the dead
load:—

(a) Loads on Culverts. —Earth pressures or load on culverts
may be computed ordinarily as the weight of earth directly
above the slab. In order to have the effect of increasing the
allowable design dead load stresses 40 per cent, more than
allowed for live load, the effective weight of earth backfiill may
be taken as 70 per cent, of its actual weight.
(h) Rigid Culverts.—For definite conditions of bedding and
backfill, the principles of soil mechanics may be applied. The
following are recommended formulas for those conditions:—


(1) Culvert in trench on unyielding subgrade, or culvert
untrenched on yielding foundation.
P=WH.
(2) *Culvert untrenched on unyielding foundation (such as
rock or piles).
• p = W(l-92 H —O-87. B) for H > 1-7 B
P = 2.59 for H < 1-7 B.
Where P = the unit pressure in pounds per square foot due
to earth backfill.
B = width in feet of trench, or in case there is no
trench, the overall width of the culvert.
H = depth in feet of fill over culvert.
W = effective weight per cubic foot of fill material,
which may be taken as 70 per cent, of actual
weight in accordance with above stated
provisions.
3.2.3 Live Load.
The live load shall consist of the weight of the applied
moving load of vehicles, trams and pedestrians.
3.2.4 Overload Provision.
The following provision for overload shall apply to all load-
ings except the H2O and H2O-Sl6 loadings.
Provision for infrequent heavy loads shall be made by apply-
ing in any single lane an H or H-S truck as specified, increased
100 per cent., and without concurrent loading of any other
lanes. Combined dead, live and impact stresses resulting from
such loading shall not be greater than 150 per cent, of the
allowable stresses allowed herein. The overload shall apply
to all parts of the structure affected, including stringers, but
excepting flooring.
3.2.5 Highway Loadings.
(a) General.
The highway live loadings on the roadway of bridges or
incidental structures shall consist of standard trucks or of lane
loads which are equivalent to truck trains. Two systems of

loading are provided, the H loadings and the H-S loadings,
the corresponding H-S loadings being heavier than the H
loadings.
(h) H Loadings.
The H loadings are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. They
consist of a two-axle truck or the corresponding lane loading.
The H loadings are designated H followed by a number indica-
ting the gross weight in tons* of the standard truck.
(c) H-S Loadings.
The H-S loadings are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. They
consist of a tractor truck with semi-trailer or of the corre-
sponding lane loading. The H-S loadings are designated by
the letter H followed by a number indicating the gross weight
in tons* of the tractor truck and the letter S followed by the
gross weight in tons* of the single axle of the semi-trailer.
The variable axle spacing has been introduced in order that the
spacing’ of axles may approximate more closely the tractor
trailers now in use. The variable spacing also provides a more
satisfactory loading for continuous spans, in that hedvy axle
loads may be placed on adjoining spans to produce maximum
negative moment.
( d) Classes of Loadings.
Highway loadings shall he of five classes: H2O, Hls, HlO,
H2O-Sl6 and Hls-Sl2. Loadings Hls and HlO are
75 per cent, and 50 per cent., respectively, of loading H2O.
Loading Hls-Sl2 is 75 per cent, of loading H2O-Sl6. If
loadings of weights other than those designated are desired,
they shall be obtained by proportionately changing the weights
shown for both the standard truck and the corresponding lane
loads.
( e ) Designation of Loadings.
The policy of affixing the year to loadings, to identify them,
was instituted with the publication of the 1944 edition in the
following manner:
HlO Loading, 1944 Edition shall be designated—Hlo-44.
Hls Loading, 1944 Edition shall be designated—Hls-44.
H2O Loading, 1944 Edition shall be designated—H2o-44.
Hls-Sl2 Loading, 1944 Edition shall be designated—
Hls-Sl2-44.
H2O-Sl6 Loading, 1944 Edition shall be designated—
H2O-Sl6-44.
*Tons of 2,000 lbs.


The affix remains unchanged until such time as the loading
specification is revised. The same policy for identification shall
be applied, for future reference, to loadings previously adopted
by the American Association of State Highway Officials.
(/) Minimum Loadings.
Minimum loadings shall be: —
(i) Metropolitan Bridges: H2O-Sl6-44 unless heavier
loads are specified.
(ii) Bridges on Main Roads and Highways: H2O-Sl6-44
unless heavier loads are specified.
(iii) Other Bridges—
(a) Through Roads—H2o-Sl6-44 unless Hl5-JSI2-44
is considered desirable.
(&) Feeder Roads (such as those serving small
groups of settlers) —Lower classes of loading
if considered desirable. On bridges of lower
capacity than HlO-44 loading, permanent load
limit notices shall be provided.
3.2.6—Traffic Lanes.
Where the spacing of main supporting members exceeds 6.5
feet for timber floors or 10.5 feet for concrete or steel grid
floors, the lane loading or standard trucks shall be assumed
to occupy a width of 10 feet. These loads shall be placed in
W
design traffic lanes having a width of W = -----

The lane loadings or standard trucks shall be assumed to
occupy any position within their individual design traffic lanes
(W) which will produce the maximum stress.


3.2.7 Standard Trucks and Lane Loads.
The wheel spacing, weight distribution, and clearance of the
standard H and H-S trucks shall be as shown in figures 2 and
4 and corresponding lane loads shall be as shown in figure 3,
Each lane loading shall consist of a uniform load per linear
foot of traffic lane combined with a single concentrated load
(or two concentrated loads in the case of continuous spans
see 3.2.8 (c)), so placed on the span as to produce maximum
stress. The concentrated load and uniform load shall be con-
sidered as uniformly distributed over a 10-foot width on a line
normal to the centre line of the lane.
For the computation of moments and shears, different con-
centrated loads shall be used as indicated in figure 3. The
lighter concentrated loads shall be used when the stresses are
primarily bending stresses and the heavier concentrated loads
shall be used when the stresses are primarily shearing stresses.
For the purpose of applying the modified loading for floors as
set out in the footnotes to figures 2 and 4, the word “floor”
shall be taken to include —
(i) deck slabs up to 14 feet span on either steel/ or con-
crete main longitudinal beams or girders,
(ii) deck slabs up to 14 feet spanning between cross
girders or beams which are supported by either trusses
or longitudinal beams or girders,
(iii) deck slabs up to 14 feet span supported by either walls
or piers.
3.2.8 Application of Loadings.
(a) Traffic Lane Units.
In computing stresses, each 10-foot lane loading or single
standard truck shall be considered as a unit, and fractional
load lane widths or fractional trucks shall not be used.
ib) Number and Position , Traffic Lane Units.
The number and position of the lane loadings or truck loading
shall be as specified in article 3.2.6 and whether lane loading
or truck loading shall be such as to produce maximum stress,
subject to the reduction specified in article 3.2.9.
(c) Lane Loadings—Continuous Spans.
The lane loadings shown in figure 3 shall be modified as
follows for the design of continuous spans; the lane loadings
shall consist of the loads shown in figure 3 and in addition
thereto another concentrated load of equal weight shall be
placed in one other span in the series in such position as to
produce maximum negative moment.


( d ) Loading for Maximum Stress.
The type of loading, whether lane loading or truck loading,
to be used, and whether the spans be simple or continuous,
shall be the loading which produces the maximum stress. The
moment and shear tables given in Appendix A show which
loading controls for simple spans. The axle spacing for H-S
trucks shall be A T aried between the specified limits to produce
maximum stresses.
For continuous spans, the lane loading shall be continuous or
discontinuous, as may be necessary to produce maximum
stresses, and the concentrated load or loads as specified in para-
graph ( c ) shall be placed in such position as to produce maxi-
mum stresses.
3.2.9 Reduction in Load Intensity.
Where maximum stresses are produced in any member by
loading any number of traffic lanes simultaneously, the follow-
ing percentages of the resultant live load stresses shall be used
in view of improbable coincident maximum loading.
Per cent.

The reduction in intensity of floor beam loads shall be deter-
mined as in the case of main trusses or girders, using the
width of roadway which must be loaded to produce maximum
stresses in the floor beam.
3.2.10 Electric Railway Loading.
If highway bridges carry electric railway traffic, the railway
loading shall be determined on the basis of the class of traffic
which the bridge may be expected to carry. The possibility
that the bridge may be required to carry the freight cars of
steam railroads shall be given consideration.
3.2.11 Footway Kerb, Safety Kerb and Railing Loading.
(a) Footway Loading —
Minimum footway loading shall be 100 pounds per

The horizontal forces shall not be applied simultaneously.
Sailings without webs and with single rails shall be designed
for the forces specified above, for lower rails.
(2) Footway Railings : Footway railings shall be designed
to resist the same forces as those specified for roadway railings.
Where through trusses, girders or arches separate the footway
and roadway or where footways are protected by kerb railings,
the footway railing shall be designed only for the forces specified
for the top rail.
3.2.l2—lmpact.
Live load stresses produced by H or H-S loadings shall be
increased for items in Group A by allowance as stated herein,
for dynamic, vibratory and impact effects. Impact shall not
be applied to items in Group B.
(a) Group A.
(1) Superstructure, including steel or concrete supporting
columns, steel towers, legs of rigid frames, and generally those
portions of the structure which extend down to the main
foundation.

The amount of this allowance or increment is expressed as
a fraction of live load stress, and shall be determined by the
formula:
1 = rTT® in which
T . , . (maximum 30 per cent.)
1 = impact traction , . ■ „ .(
(minimum 10 per cent.)
L = length in feet of the portion of the span which is
loaded to produce the maximum stress in the member.
For uniformity of application the loaded length “L” shall
be especially considered as follows:
For roadway floors, use the design span length.
For transverse members, such as floor beams, use span length
of member.
For computing truck load moments use span length, except
for cantilever arms use the length from moment centre to far
end of truck.
For shear due to truck loads use length of the loaded portion
of span from the point under consideration to the reaction,
except for cantilever arms use 30 per cent.
For continuous spans use length of span under consideration
for positive moment, and use average of two adjacent loaded
spans for negative moment.

For culverts with cover 1 foot 1 inch to 2 feet 0 inches
I = 20%.
For culverts with cover 2 feet 1 inch to 2 feet 11 inches

Each authority shall follow its existing practice.*
3.2.14 Wind Loads.
Each authority shall follow its existing practice.*
3.2.15 Thermal Forces.

force exerted on a minimum depth of 4 feet of debris.
Where floating logs are likely, the force exerted by such logs
causing a direct hit on to piers shall be calculated on the
assumptions that the log weighs two tons and travels at normal
stream velocity. The log shall be stopped in a distance of one
foot for timber piers, six inches for column-type concrete piers

Where an adequately designed reinforced-concrete approach
slab supported at one end by the bridge is provided, no live
load surcharge need be considered.
All designs shall provide for the thorough drainage of the
back-filling materials by means of weep holes and crushed rock,
pipe drains or gravel drains, or by perforated drains.
SECTION 3.— DISTRIBUTION OF LOADS.
3.3.l—Distribution of Wheel Loads to Stringers and Floor Beams.
(a) Position of Loads for Shear.
In calculating end shears and end reactions in transverse
floor beams and longitudinal beams and stringers, no lateral
or longitudinal distribution of the wheel load shall be assumed
for the wheel or axle load adjacent to the end at which the
stress is being determined. For loads in other positions on the
span, the distribution for shear shall be determined by the
method prescribed for moment, except that the calculation of
horizontal shear in rectangular beams shall be in accordance
with article 3.4.8.
(&) Bending Moment in Stringers.
In calculating bending moments in longitudinal beams or
stringers, no longitudinal distribution of the wheel loads shall
be assumed. The lateral distribution shall be determined as

The moment for slabs over 12 feet shall be calculated as
follows: The loads per foot of slab shall be determined accord-
ing to the method given for distribution of loads. The loads
thus determined shall be placed on the span or spans in
position to cause maximum positive or negative moments.
The moment shall be calculated in accordance with standard
practice for design of simple and continuous spans.
For slabs designed on stiffened kerb theory, more exact
methods of load distribution shall be used.
(b) Edge Beams ( Longitudinal ).
Edge beams shall be provided for all slabs having main rein-
forcement parallel to traffic. The beams may consist of the
kerb section reinforced, of a beam support or of additional
slab width. It shall be designed to resist a live load moment of
0.10 P S where P = wheel load and
S = span length.
The moment as stated is for a freely supported span. It may
be reduced 20 per cent, for continuous spans unless a greater
reduction results from an exact analysis.
(c) Distribution Reinforcement.
Reinforcement shall be placed in the bottom of all slabs
normal to the main steel to provide for lateral distribution of
the loads. The amount shall be the percentage of the main
reinforcing steel required for positive moment as given by the
following formula: —
100 Maximum 50%
Percentage = —r—
■\/ S Minimum 20%
Where S equals the effective span of the slab in feet.


C d ) Shear and Bond Stress in Slabs.
Slabs designed for bending moment in accordance with, the
foregoing shall be considered satisfactory in bond and shear,
( e ) Unsupported Edges ( Transverse ).
The design assumptions of this article do not provide for
the effect of loads near unsupported edges. Therefore, at the
ends of the bridge and at intermediate points where the con-
tinuity of the slab is broken, the edges shall be supported by
diaphragms or other suitable means. The diaphragms shall be
designed to resist the full moment and shear produced by the
wheel loads which can come on them.
(/) Cantilever Slabs.
Under the following formulas for distribution of loads on
cantilever slabs, the slab is designed to support the load indepen-
dent of edge support along the end of the cantilever. The
distribution given includes the effect of wheels on parallel
elements.
1. Reinforcement Perpendicular to Traffic. —Each State
Authority shall follow its existing practice.
2. Reinforcement Parallel to Traffic. —The distribution for
each wheel load on the element parallel to traffic shall be
as follows:

In the case of slabs supported along four edges and rein-
forced in both directions, the proportion of the load carried
by the short span of the slab shall be assumed as given by the
following equations:—
_ . W
Eor load uniformly distributed, p
h 3
Eor load concentrated at centre, p = ;^
a 3 + o
where p = proportion of load carried by short span.
a = length of short span of slab.
b length of long span of slab.
Where the length of the slab exceeds times its width,
the entire load shall be assumed to be carried by the trans-
verse reinforcement.


The distribution width E for the load taken by either span
shall be determined as provided for other slabs. Moments
obtained shall be used in designing the centre half of the
short and long slabs. The reinforcing steel in the outer
quarters of both short and long spans may be reduced 50 per
cent. In the design of the supporting beams, consideration
shall be given to the fact that the loads delivered to the
supporting beams are not uniformly distributed along the
beams.
More exact methods of calculation may be used if desired.
(h) Edge Distance of Wheel Load.
In designing slabs the centre line of wheel load shall be
assumed to be 1 foot from the face of the kerb.
(•i) Span Lengths. (See also Article 3.7.4.)
The following effective span lengths shall be used in calcu-
lating distribution moment of slabs continuous over more than
two supports:—
Slabs monolithic with beam (without haunches) S = clear
span.
Slabs supported on steel stringers S = distance between
edges of flanges plus i of the stringer flange width.
Slabs supported on timber stringers S = clear span plus
i thickness of stringers.
For simple- spans the span length shall be the distance
centre to centre of supports but not to exceed clear span plus
thickness of slab.
3.3.3—Distribution of Wheel Loads Through Earth Fills.
When the depth of fill is 2 feet or more, concentrated loads
shall be considered as uniformly distributed over a square, the
sides of which are equal to If times the depth of fill. When
such areas from several concentrations overlap, the total load
shall be considered as uniformly distributed over the area
defined by the outside limits of the individual areas but the
total width of distribution shall not exceed the total width of
the supporting slab. For single spans, the effect of live load
may be neglected when the depth of fill is more than 8 feet and
exceeds the span length; for multiple spans, it may be neglected
when the depth of fill exceeds the distance between faces of
end supports or abutments. When the depth of fill is less than
2 feet the wheel load shall be distributed as in slabs with con-
centrated loads. When the calculated live load and impact
moment in concrete slabs based on distribution of the wheel
load through fills as herein outlined exceeds the live load and
impact moment calculated according to article 3.3.2 then the
latter moment shall be used.


3.3.4 Distribution of Wheel Loads on Timber Flooring.
For the calculation of bending moments in timber flooring
each wheel load shall be distributed as follows: —
(a) Flooring Transverse.
In direction of span —over width of tyre. (H-10 loading
10 inches; H-15 loading 15 inches; H-20 loading 20 inches.)
Normal to direction of span—plank floor, distribution =
width of plank. *
Normal to direction of span —laminated floor, distribution
= minimum 15 inches or 2 planks whichever is the greater.
Spline, or doweled floor—not less than 5J inches thick,
distribution = 4 times thickness. -
Span length = clear distance between stringers plus oner
half the width of one stringer but shall not exceed the clear
span plus thickness of floor.
(h) Flooring Longitudinal
In direction of span—point loading.
Normal to direction of span —laminated floor, distribution
= width of wheel plus thickness of floor.
Normal to direction of span—plank floor, distribution =
at least width of wheel.
Spline, or doweled floor—not less than 5J inches thick,
distribution = width of wheel plus twice thickness.
Span length = clear distance between floor beams plus
one-half the width of one beam but shall not exceed the clear
span plus thickness of floor.
(c) Continuous Flooring.
If the flooring is continuous over more than two spans the
maximum bending moment shall be assumed as being 80 per
cent, of that obtained for a simple span.
3.3.5 Steel Grid Floors.
(a) General.
The grid floor shall be designed as continuous and moments
reduced as provided in article 3.3.2.
The formulas for distribution of loads provided herein are
based upon there being adequate transfer of the load normal to
the main elements. Eeinforcement for this purpose shall consist
of transverse bars or shapes welded to the main steel. The
strength and details of the transverse reinforcement shall meet
with the approval of the engineer.


( h ) Floors Filled with Concrete.
The distribution and bending moment shall be as specified
for concrete slabs, article 3.3.2. The following items specified
in that article shall also apply to concrete-filled steel grid

he determined by means of the “transformed area” method.
The allowable stresses shall be as set forth in Section 4,
(c) Open Floors.
A wheel load shall be distributed, normal to the main bars,
over a width of W plus twice the distance centre to centre of
main bars, where W equals 1 inch per ton of total weight of
loaded truck. Bending moment shall be calculated as specified
in Section 3 for concrete slabs. The strength of the section shall
be determined by the moment of inertia method. The allowable
stresses shall be as set forth in Section 4.
SECTION 4.— UNIT STRESSES, PILE LOADS AND
BEARING POWER OF SOILS.
3.4.1 —General.
For the purpose o£ application of stresses and pile loads,
the loads and forces shall be divided into two groups:

Structures designed for Group A loads shall be proportioned
so the stresses and loads shall not exceed those set forth in this
section.

minated by a hook. Also not less than one-third of
the area of the maximum positive reinforcement shall

bedment of not less than six diameters, and shall in

mulas for the Computation of Stresses in Timber.

sign shall be used, but-where special timbers and methods of

Miscellaneous.
3.4.9 Bearing Power of Foundation Soils. Determination of
Bearing Power.
When required by the engineer, the bearing power of the
soil in excavated foundation pits shall be determined by loading
tests.


The following tabulation of the bearing power of broad basic
groups of materials may be used as an aid to the judgment in
the absence of more definite information:

In the absence of exact data which has been determined by
field investigation and soil analysis, the angle of repose of the
material shall be assumed to he the minimum given in the
table.
3.4.11 Bearing Value of Piling.
(a) General.
The design loads for piles shall not be greater than the mini-
mum value which shall be determined for Case A, Case B and
Case C; where Case Ais the capacity of the pile as a structural
member, Case B is the capacity of the pile to transfer its load
to the ground and Case C is the capacity of the ground to
support the load delivered to it by the pile or piles. The
values assignable to each of the three cases shall be determined
by making subsurface investigations or tests of sufficient extent
to justify the assumed design values used for the particular
condition of support under consideration.
In determining the bearing value of piles for use in design-
ing, consideration shall be given to all information available
relative to the subsurface conditions. Consideration shall also
be given to:
(1) The difference between the supporting capacity of a
single pile and a group of piles.
(2) The capacity of the underlying strata to support the
load of the pile group.


(3) The effect of driving additional piles and the effect
of their loads on adjacent structures.
(4) Possibility of scour and its effect.
(b) Case A. Capacity of Pile as a Structural Member.
Piles shall be designed as structural columns.
(c) Case B. Capacity of Pile to Transfer Load to the Ground.
(1) Point-bearing Piles. A pile shall be considered to be a
point-bearing pile when placed or driven on or into a material
which is capable of developing the pile load by direct bearing
at the point with reasonable factor of safety.
The allowable load at the tip of the pile shall not exceed the
following:
(a) For timber piles, 80 per cent, of allowable compression
parallel to grain.
(. b ) For concrete piles, 0.33 f' c in accordance with article
3.4.6.
(c) For concrete-filled pipe piles, 0.40 f' c in accordance with
article 3.4.6, applied to the total actual area of the
concrete and steel.
(d) For steel piles, 6,000 pounds per sq. in. over the cross
sectional area of the pile tip.
Note.—The limitation in (c) and (d) govern except where
the point bearing capacity of the piles is determined by load-
ing test piles.
(2) Friction Piles. A pile shall be considered to be a friction
pile if its point does not rest on or in a material which is
capable of developing the pile load by direct bearing at the
point.
The load carrying capacity of friction piles shall be deter-
mined by one or more of the following methods:
( a ) Driving and loading test piles.
The safe allowable load shall be considered as 50 per cent,
of that load which, after continuous application for
48 hours, produces a permanent settlement not greater
than I inch measured at the top of the pile.
This maximum settlement shall not be increased by a
continuous application of the test load for a period of
60 hours or longer. At least one pile for each group
of 100 piles shall be tested.
(h) Pile-driving experience in the vicinity. When piles
are designed on the basis of experience in the vicinity,
due consideration will be given to the variation in
pile types and lengths, and in the variation of the soil
strata. Where possible, the complete driving records


of all piles in the vicinity shall be examined and com-
pared to the driving records of the project piles.
(c) Adequate tests of the soil strata through which the
pile is to be driven. These tests should be projected
and compared, if possible, to tests of similar material
through which piles of known capacity have been
driven.
(3) Required Subsurface Investigations.
(«) Point-beafing piles. Sufficient borings shall be made
to determine the presence, position, and thickness of
the material which is capable of developing point bear-
ing, and the log of borings shall show the nature of the
overlying strata in order that the extent of lateral
support may be determined. If the point-bearing
stratum is of doubtful thickness and quality, the bor-
ings shall be made to sufficient depth below this stratum
such that the capacity of a friction pile may be
determined.
(&) Friction piles. Borings shall be made to an elevation
well below the expected elevation of the pile tips and
accurate logs of these borings shall be made. In those
cases where the piles are to be designed on the basis
of soil tests, undisturbed samples shall be taken on
all strata which will have appreciable influence on the
capacity of the pile.
(c) Combination point-bearing and friction piles. Piles
shall be classified as either (1) point-bearing or (2)
friction. Those cases where adequate strength is
developed by both point bearing and friction may be
designed under either of these classifications.
( d ) Case C. Capacity of the Ground to Support the Load
Delivered hy the Pile.
(1) The capacity of the ground to support the load delivered
by the pile shall be determined from the results of the required
subsurface investigations.
(2) Required Subsurface Investigations:
(a) Point-bearing piles. Sufficient borings shall be made
to determine the thickness and quality of the stratum
in which the point bearing is developed. If the
material in which point bearing is developed is of
sufficient thickness and is underlain by a firm material,
no reduction will be made for group action of piles.
In general, piles should not rest on a thin stratum of
hard material which is underlain by a thick stratum
of soft or yielding material, but where this condition
cannot be avoided, group action should be considered
and the design loads reduced accordingly.


(&) Friction piles. Borings shall be made well below the
tips of the piles in order to determine the character-
istics of the underlying material. In most cases a
study of those borings will suffice to determine whether
or not the underlying soil will support the loads
delivered to it, but in doubtful or special cases,
especially large foundation areas and important
footings, the material should he investigated more
thoroughly by soil mechanics methods.
A single row of piles shall not be considered as a
group provided that they are not spaced closer centre
to centre than 2J times the nominal diameter or
dimension. In those cases where piles are driven in
groups into plastic material, the design load shall be
determined by the loading of a group of piles or
definite allowance shall be made for the difference
between the supporting capacity of a single pile and
a group of piles. (Refer to ( g ).)
(e) Loads for Piles.
In those cases where it is not feasible to make the required
subsurface investigations and/or test loads, pile loads be
determihed by the Engineering News Formula or, where suffi-
cient data is available, by the Hiley Formula.
(/) Uplift.
Friction piles may be considered to resist an intermittent
but not sustained uplift equivalent to 40 per cent, of the
above loads providing proper provision is made for the anchor-
age at top and sufficient skin friction is developed and in no
case shall it exceed the weight of material (buoyancy con-
sidered) surrounding the embedded portion of the pile.
( g ) Group Pile Loading.
Where the capacity of a group of piles driven into plastic
material is not determined by test loading, the following
Converse-Labarre formula is suggested to determine the reduc-
tion of a single pile load for a group pile load:
{n —1) m + {m —1) n
? 90 mn
Where :
E = the efficiency or the decimal fraction of the single pile
value to be used for each pile in the group.
n = the number of piles in each row.
m = the number of rows in each group.
d = the diameter of the pile.
s centre to centre spacing of piles.
Tan <p = d/s.
9 =is numerically equal to the angle expressed in degrees


3.4.l2—Moments, Shears and Reactions.
Maximum moments, shears, and reactions are given in tables,
Appendix A, for Hl5, H2O, Hl5-Sl2 and H2O-Sl6
loadings. They are calculated for the standard truck or the
lane loading applied to a single lane on the basis of freely
supported spans. It is indicated in the table whether the
standard truck or the lane loading produces the maximum
stress.
SECTION 5—SUBSTRUCTURES AND RETAINING
WALLS.
3.s.l—Piles.
(a) General.
In general, piling shall be used when footings cannot, at a
reasonable expense, be founded on rock or other solid founda-
tion material. At locations where unusual erosion may occur
and the soil conditions permit the driving of piles they, pre-
ferably, shall be used as a protection against scour, even though
the safe bearing resistance of the natural soil is sufficient to
support the structure without piling. ,
In general, the penetration for any pile shall be not less
than 10 feet in hard material and not less than J the length
of the pile nor less than 20 feet in soft material.
For foundation work, no piling shall be used to penetrate
a very soft upper stratum overlying a hard stratum unless the
piles penetrate the hard material a sufficient distance to rigidly
fix the ends.
Piles shall be designed to carry the entire superimposed load,
no allowance being made for the supporting value of the
material between the piles.
(h) Spacing, clearances and embedment.
Footing areas shall be so proportioned that pile spacing will
be not less than 3 feet centre to centre. When the tops of
foundation piles are incorporated in a concrete footing, the
distance from the side of any pile to the nearest edge of the
footing shall be not less than 9 inches.
The tops of piling in general shall project not less than
12 inches into the concrete after all damaged material has
been removed.
(c) Batter Piles.
When the lateral resistance of the soil surrounding the piles
is inadequate to counteract the horizontal forces transmitted


to the foundation or when increased rigidity of the entire
structure is required, batter piles shall be used in the founda-
tion.
( d ) Buoyancy.
The effect of hydrostatic pressure shall be considered in the
design as provided in article 3.2.17.
(e) Concrete Piles ( Precast ).
Concrete piles shall be designed for handling stresses using
12,000 pounds per square inch in steel, after adding 50% to
static load for impact.
(/) Concrete Piles ( Gast-in-Place).
Cast-in-place concrete piles shall be, in general, cast in metal
shells which shall remain permanently in place. However,
other types of cast-in-place concrete piles, plain or reinforced,
cased or uncased, may be used if, in the opinion of the engineer,
the soil conditions permit their use and if their design and the
method of placing are satisfactory to him.
Cast-in-place concrete piles may be of either uniform section
or tapered, or a combination thereof. The minimum size,
measured at the butt, or above the taper, and embedment of
reinforcing shall be as specified for precast piles, except that
foundation piles may have a minimum butt cross section area of
100 square inches. The minimum diameter at tip of pile shall
be 8 inches.
Cast-in-place piling shall be reinforced as prescribed for
precast concrete piling to at least 10 feet below the plane at
which the soil may be considered firm. Where the encasement
is in excess of 0.12 inches in thickness it may be considered as
reinforcement subject to the deduction of 1/16-inch for
corrosion.
Sufficient reinforcement shall be provided at the junction
of the pile with the superstructure to make a suitable con-
nection.
The metal shall be of sufficient thickness and strength so
that the shell will hold its original form and show no harmful
distortion after it and adjacent shells have been driven and
the driving core, if any, has been withdrawn. The design of
the shell shall be approved by the engineer before any driving
is done.
( g ) Steel Piles.
(1) Thickness of metal. Steel piles shall have a minimum
thickness of web of 0.400 inch. Splice plates shall be not less
than |-inch thick.


(2) Splices. Piles shall be spliced to develop the net section
of pile. The flanges and web shall be either spliced by butt
welding or with plates, welded, riveted or bolted. The bolted
splices shall only be used on projects where a small number of
piling is required and where facilities for riveting or welding
are not available.
Splices shall be detailed on the contract plans.
(3) Caps. In general, caps are not required for steel piles
embedded in concrete. Reference is made to Research Report
Ho. 1, “Investigation of the Strength of the Connection between
a Concrete Cap and the Embedded end of the Steel H-Pile” —
Department of Highways, State of Ohio, for a discussion of
this subject and for the results of tests pertinent to it.
(4) If heavy scour is anticipated, consideration shall be
given to design of the portion of the pile, which would be 1
exposed, as a column.
(5) Lugs, scabs, and core-stoppers.
These devices may be used to increase the bearing powpr
of the pile where necessary. They may consist of structural
shapes, welded, riveted or bolted, of plates welded between the
flanges, or of timber or concrete blocks securely fastened.
(h) Steel Pile and Steel Pile Shell Protection.
Where conditions of exposure warrant, concrete encasement
shall be used on steel piles and steel pile shells. The encase-
ment shall extend between an elevation 2 feet below the ground
or low water surface and not less than 2 feet above the ground
or ordinary water level.
3.s.2—Footings.
(a) Depth.
The depths of footings shall be determined with respect to>
the character of the foundation materials and the possibility
of undermining. Except where solid rock is encountered or in
other special cases, the footings of all structures, other than
culverts, which are exposed to the erosive action of stream'
currents, preferably, shall be founded at a depth of not less than
4 feet below the permanent bed of the stream. Stream piers
and arch abutments, preferably, shall be founded at a depth
of not less than 6 feet below stream bed. The above preferred
minimum depths shall be increased as conditions may require.
Footings not exposed to the action of stream currents shall
be founded on a firm foundation and below frost.


Footings for culverts shall be carried to an elevation suffi-
cient to secure a firm foundation, or a heavy reinforced floor
shall be used to distribute the pressure over the entire hori-
zontal area of the structure. In any location liable to erosion,
aprons or cut-off walls shall be used at both ends of the culvert
and, where necessary, the entire floor area between the wing-
walls shall be paved. Baffle walls or struts across the unpaved
bottom of a culvert barrel shall not be used where the stream
bed is subject to erosion. When conditions require, culvert
footings shall be reinforced longitudinally.
{ h ) Anchorage.
Footings on inclined smooth solid rock surfaces which are
not restrained by an overburden of resistant material, shall he
effectively anchored by means of anchor bolts, dowels, keys
>or other suitable means.
( c ) Distribution of Pressure:
All footings shall be designed to keep the maximum soil
pressures within safe bearing values. In order to prevent
unequal settlement, footings shall be designed to k6ep the
pressure as nearly uniform as practicable. In footings having
unequal pressures and requiring piling, the spacing of the piles
•shall be such as to secure as nearly equal loads on each pile
as may be practicable.
fd) Spread Footings.
Spread footings which act as cantilevers may be decreased
in thickness from the junction of the footing slab with column
or wall toward the edge of the footing, provided sufficient
section is maintained at all points to provide the necessary
resistance to diagonal tension and bending stresses. This
decrease in section may be accomplished by sloping the upper
surface of the footing or by means of vertical steps. Stepped
footings shall be cast monolithically.
Except in small structures, no footing shall have a thick-
ness at the edge of less than 2 feet. When piles are used, the
footings shall have an edge thickness of not less than 18 inches
above the tops of the piles.
(e) Internal Stresses in Spread Footings.
Spread footings shall be considered as under the action of
•downward forces, due to the superimposed loads, resisted by
an upward pressure exerted by the foundation materials and
distributed over the area of the footings as determined by
the eccentricity of the resultant of the downward forces. Where
piles are used under footings, the upward reaction of the
foundation shall be considered as a series of concentrated loads


applied at the pile centers, each pile being assumed to carry
its computed proportion of the total footing load.
When a single spread footing supports a column, pier or
wall, this footing shall be assumed to act as a cantilever. When
two or more piers or columns are placed upon a common foot-
ing, the footing slab shall be designed for the actual condi-
tions of continuity and restraint.
Footings shall be designed for the bending stress, diagonal
tension stress and bond at the critical section designated herein.
The critical section for bending shall be taken at the face
of the column, pedestal or wall. In the case of columns other
than square or rectangular, the critical section shall be taken
at the side of the concentric square of equivalent area. For
footings under masonry walls, where bond between the wall
and footing is reduced to friction value, the critical section
shall be taken as midway between the middle and the face
of the wall. For footings under metallic column bases, the
critical section shall be taken as midway between the face
of the column and the edge of the metallic base. The load
shall be considered as uniformly distributed over the column,
pedestal or wall, or metallic column base.
The critical section for bond shall be taken at the same plane
as for bending and the shear used for computing bond shall
be based on the same loading and section as for bending. Bond
shall also be investigated at planes where changes of section or
of reinforcement occur.
The critical section for diagonal tension in footings on soil
or rock shall be considered as concentric vertical section through
the footing at a distance d from each face of the column,
pedestal or wall; d being equal to the depth from the top
of the section to the centroid of the longitudinal tension rein-
forcement.
The critical section for diagonal tension in footings sup-
ported on piles shall be considered as the concentric vertical
section through the footing at a distance d/2 from each face
of the column, pedestal or wall, and any piles considered in
computing the diagonal tension.
In sloped or stepped footings, stresses should be investi-
gated at sections where the depth changes outside the critical
section as defined above.
Bending need not be considered unless the projection of the
footing is more than two-thirds of the depth.
In plain concrete footings, the stresses shall be computed
on the basis of a monolithic section having a depth measured
from the top of the footing to a plane 2 inches above the
bottom of the footing. The maximum fibre stress due ta


bending shall not exceed that specified in article 3.4.6 and
the average shearing stress on a concentric vertical section
through the footing at a distance d minus 2 inches from each
face of the column, pedestal or wall, shall not exceed the shear-
ing stresses specified in article 3.4.6 for beams without web
reinforcement and with longitudinal bars not anchored.
(/) Reinforcement.
Footing slabs shall be reinforced for bending stresses and,
where necessary, for diagonal tension. All bars shall be
effectively anchored to develop in bond the computed stress in
the bar.
The reinforcement for square footings shall consist of two
or more bands of bars. The reinforcement necessary to resist
the bending moment in each direction in the footing shall be
determined as for a reinforced concrete beam; the effective
depth of the footing shall be the depth from the top to the
plane of the reinforcement. The required reinforcement shall
be spaced uniformly across the footing, unless the footing
width is greater than the side of the column or pedestal plus
twice the effective depth of the footing, in which case the
width over which the reinforcement is spread may equal the
width of the column or pedestal plus twice the effective depth
of the footing plus one-half the remaining width of the footings.
In order that no considerable area of the footing shall remain
unreinforced, additional bars shall be placed outside of the
width specified, but such bars shall not be considered as effec-
tive in resisting the calculated bending moment. For the
extra bars a spacing double that used for the reinforcement
within the effective belt may be used. When reinforcement
is used in more than one direction the allowable unit bond
stresses shall be reduced as follows;
For two-way reinforcement . . 25 per cent.
For each additional direction . . . . 10 per cent.
(p) Transfer of Stress from Vertical Reinforcement.
The stresses in the vertical reinforcement of columns or
walls shall be transferred to the footings by extending the rein-
forcement into them a sufficient distance to develop the strength
of the bars in bond, or by means of dowels anchored in the
footings and overlapping or fastened to the vertical bars in
such manner as to develop their strength. If the dimensions
of the footings are not sufficient to permit the use of straight
bars, the bars may be hooked or otherwise mechanically anchored
in the footings.


3.s.3—Abutments.
(a) General.
Abutments shall be designed to withstand earth pressure as
specified in article 3.2.18, the weight of abutment and super-
structure, live load over any portion of the superstructure or
approach fill, wind forces, longitudinal force when the bear-
ings are fixed, and longitudinal forces due to frictional bear-
ings. The design shall be investigated for any combination of
these forces which may produce the most severe condition of
loading.
Abutments shall be designed to be safe against overturning
about the toe of the footing, against sliding on the footing
base and against crushing of foundation material or over-
loading of piles at the point of maximum pressure.
In computing* stresses in abutments, the weight of filling
material directly over an inclined or stepped rear face, or
over a reinforced concrete spread footing extending back from
the face wall, may be considered as part of the effective weight
of the abutment. In the ease of a spread footing, the rear
projection shall be designed as a cantilever supported at the
abutment stem and loaded with the full weight of the super-
imposed material, unless a more exact method is used. The
cross section of stone masonry or plain concrete abut-
ments shall be proportioned to avoid the introduction of tensile
stress in the material.
(&) Reinforcement for Temperature.
Except in gravity abutments, not less than J square inch
of horizontal reinforcement per foot of height shall be provided
near exposed surfaces not otherwise reinforced, to resist the
formation of temperature and shrinkage cracks.
(c) Wing Walls.
Wing walls shall be of sufficient length to retain the road-
way embankment to the required extent and to furnish pro-
tection against erosion. For ordinary materials, in the absence
of accurate data, the slope of the fill shall be assumed as 1J
horizontal to one vertical and wing lengths computed on this
basis.
Reinforcing rods or other suitable rolled sections, prefer-
ably, shall be spaced across the junction between all wing walls
and abutments to thoroughly tie them together. Such bars
shall extend into the masonry on each side of the joint far
enough to develop the strength of the bar as specified for bar
reinforcement, and shall vary in length so as to avoid planes
of weakness in the concrete at their ends. If bars are not
used, an expansion joint shall be provided at this point in which
the wings shall be mortised into the body of the abutment.


( d) Drainage.
The filling material behind abutments shall be effectively
drained by weep holes with French drains, placed at suitable
intervals.
3.s.4—Retaining Walls.
(a) General.
Retaining walls shall be designed to withstand earth pressure,
including any live load surcharge, and the weight of the wall,
in accordance with the general principles specified above for
abutments.
Stone masonry and plain concrete walls shall be of the
gravity type. Reinforced concrete walls may be of either the
cantilever, counterforted, buttressed, or cellular types.
(Jo) Base or Footing Slabs.
The rear projection or heel of base slabs shall be designed
to support the entire weight of the superimposed materials,
unless a more exact method is used.
The base slabs of cantilever walls shall be designed as
cantilevers supported by the wall.
The base slabs of counterforted and buttressed walls shall
be designed as fixed or continuous beams of spans equal to the
distance between counterforts or buttresses.
(c) Vertical Walls.
The vertical stems of cantilever walls shall be designed as
cantilevers supported at the base.
The vertical or face walls of counterforted and buttressed
walls shall be designed as fixed or continuous beams. The face
walls shall be securely anchored to the supporting counterforts
or buttresses by means of adequate reinforcement.
( d ) Counterforts and Buttresses.
Counterforts shall be designed as T-beams. Buttresses shall
be designed as rectangular beams. In connection with the
main tension reinforcement of counterforts there shall be a
system of horizontal and vertical bars or stirrups to effectively
anchor the face walls and base slab. These stirrups shall be
anchored as near the outside faces of the face walls, and as near
the bottom of the base slab as practicable.
(e) Reinforcement for Temperature.
Except in gravity walls, not less than 4 square inch of hori-
zontal reinforcement per foot of height shall be provided near
exposed surfaces not otherwise reinforced, to resist the forma-
tion of temperature and shrinkage cracks.


(/) Expansion and Contraction Joints.
Contraction joints shall be provided at intervals not exceed-
ing 30 feet and expansion joints at intervals not exceeding 90
feet, for gravity or reinforced concrete walls.
( g ) Drainage.
The filling material behind all retaining walls shall be effec-
tively drained by weep holes with French drains, placed at suit-
able intervals. In counterforted walls there shall be at least
one drain for each pocket formed by the counterforts.
3.5.5 Piers.
(a) General.
Piers shall be designed to withstand the dead and live loads
superimposed thereon; wind pressures acting on the pier and
superstructure; the forces due to stream current and drift;
and all longitudinal forces.
Where necessary, piers shall be protected against abrasion
by facing them with granite, vitrified brick, timber or othej*
suitable material within the limits of damage by debris.
(h) Pier Nose.
When a steel angle or other metal nosing is used, it shall be
effectively secured to the masonry by means of suitable anchors.
3.5.6 Tubular Steel Piers.
( a ) Use.
Preferably, tubular steel piers shall not be used and they shall
never be used in locations where they will be subjected to
lateral earth pressure. In special cases their use may be per-
mitted, in which cases the following requirements shall apply:
(h) Depth.
The general requirements governing the depths of foundations
as above set forth shall govern in the case of tubular steel piers
except that steel tubes resting upon gravel foundation without
piling shall in no case be carried to a depth less than 8 feet
below the permanent bed of the stream and to such additional
depth as may be necessary to eliminate all danger of under-
mining.
(c) Piling.
Piles used in connecting with tubular piers shall extend into
the concrete filling a sufficient distance to thoroughly anchor
the tubes. In general, these piles shall extend not less than 6
to 8 feet above the bottom of the concrete.


( d) Dimensions of Shell.
The minimum thickness of the metal in the shells of tubular
piers shall be 5/16 inch. This thickness shall be increased where
necessary to secure strength and rigidity for placing the shell.
In all cases the pier shall be designed for safe pile or soil bear-
ing values as specified herein, but when the diameter re-
quired by these values is greater than that required for the
superstructure bearing, the diameter may be reduced at any
splice point. The minimum diameter of steel cylinders used for
piers shall be 42 inches unless used as piles.
( e ) Bracing.
Adequate bracing connecting the tubes of cylinder piers
shall be provided. In general, this bracing shall consist of a
steel or concrete girder diaphragm effectively secured to the
tubes. The depth of this diaphragm shall be as great as
conditions will permit.
SECTION 6.—STRUCTURAL STEEL DESIGN.
3.6.1 Number of Trusses or Girders.
Preferably, through spans shall have only two trusses, arches
or girders.
3.6.2 Spacing of Trusses and Girders.
Main trusses, arches and girders shall be spaced a sufficient
distance apart, centre to centre, to be secure against overtiim-
ing by the assumed lateral forces.
3.6.3 Effective Span.
For the calculation of stresses, span lengths shall be assumed
as follows:
Beams and girders, distance between centres of bearings.
Trusses, distance between centres of end pins or of bear-
ings.
Floorbeams, distance between centres of trusses or girders.
Stringers, distance between centres of floorbeams.
3.6.4 Effective Depth.
For the calculation of stresses, effective depths shall be
assumed as follows:
Riveted trusses, distance between centres of gravity of the
chords.
Pin-connected trusses, distance between centres of chord
pins.
Plate girders, distance between centres of gravity of the
flanges, but not to exceed the distance back to back
of flange angles.

3.6.5 Alternating Stresses.
Members subject to alternating stresses of tension and com-
pression, due to the combination of dead, live, impact and
centrifugal stresses, shall be proportioned for the kind of stress
requiring the larger section.
If the alternating stresses occur in succession during one
passage of the live load, each shall be increased by 50 per cent,
of the smaller. The connections of such members shall be
proportioned for the sum of the net alternating stresses not so
increased.
If the live load and dead load stresses are of opposite sign,
only 70 per cent, of the dead load stress shall be considered
as effective in counteracting the live load stress.
3.6.6 Combined Stresses.
All members subject to combined bending and direct stresses
shall be proportioned for the maximum unit stress specified in
Appendix “B”. When bending stresses are induced by the com-
ponent of externally applied loads acting perpendicular to the
axis of the member, shall be assumed equal to -f- 1,
3.6.7 Secondary Stresses.
The design and details shall be such that secondary stresses
will be as small as practicable. Secondary stresses due to
truss distortion or floorbeam deflection usually need not be
considered in any member the width of which, measured
parallel to the plane of distortion, is less than one-tenth of its
length. If the secondary stress exceeds 4,000 pounds per
square inch for tension members and 3,000 for compression
members, the excess shall be treated as a primary stress.
3.6.8 Rolled Beams.
Rolled beams shall be proportioned by the moments of
inertia method of their net sections.
Suitable stiffeners shall be provided to stiffen the webs of
rolled beams at bearings, when the unit shear in the web adja-
cent to the bearing exceeds 75 per cent, of the allowable shear
for girder webs.
The compression flanges of rolled beams or stringers support-
ing timber floors shall not be considered to be laterally suppor-
ted by the flooring unless the floor and fastenings are specially
designed to provide adequate support.


3.6.9 Limiting Lengths of Members.
For compression members, the greatest ratio of unsuppor-
ted length to radius of gyration shall not exceed 120 for main
members, or those in which the major stresses result from dead
or live load, or both; and shall not exceed 140 for secondary
members, or those whose primary purpose is to brace the
structure against lateral or longitudinal forces, or to brace or
reduce the unsupported length of other members, main or
secondary.
In determining the radius of gyration, the area of any por-
tion of a member may be neglected, provided that the area thus
neglected shall not be used in calculating the strength of the
member. For members resisting calculated compressive stress,
all of the specified requirements for minimum thickness of com-
ponent parts to resist buckling shall apply to material com-
prising any area thus neglected.
The radius of gyration and the effective area for carrying
stress of a member containing perforated cover plates shall
be computed for a transverse section through the maximum
width of perforation. When perforations are staggered in
opposite cover plates the cross-sectional area of the member
shall be considered the same as for a section having perfora-
tions in the same transverse plane.
Unsupported length shall be assumed as follows: For the top
chords of half-through trusses, the length between panel points
laterally supported as required under 3.6.69: for other main
members, the length between panel point intersections or centres
of braced points or centres of end connections; for secondary
members, the length between the centres of the end connections
of such member or centres of braced points.
For tension members, except rods, eyebars, cables, and plates,
the greatest ratio of unsupported length to radius of gyration
shall not exceed 200 for main members, and shall not exceed
240 for bracing members.
3.6.10 Deflection.
The term “deflection” as used herein shall be the deflection
computed in accordance with the assumptions made for loading
when computing the stress in the member.
Steel beams or girders having simple or continuous spans
shall be designed so that the deflection due to live load plus
impact shall not exceed 1/800 of the span, the span length
being considered the distance centre to centre of bearings.
The deflection of cantilever arms due to live load plus impact
shall be limited to 1/300 of the cantilever arm.


When bridges have cross bracing or diaphragms sufficient
in depth and strength to insure lateral distribution of loads,
the deflection may be computed for the standard loading, con-
sidering all beams or girders as acting together and having
equal deflection.
Sidewalk live load may be neglected in computing deflection.
The moment of inertia of the gross cross-sectional area shall
be used for computing the deflection of beams and girders.
The gross area of each member shall be used in computing
the deflections of trusses. When perforated cover plates are
used in truss members, the effective area shall be the net
volume divided by the length from centre to centre of
perforations.
3.6.11 Depth Ratios.
The ratio of the depth to the length of spans, preferably
shall be not less than the following:
For trusses .. .. .. .. • • • • 1/10
For plate girders and rolled beams used as
girders .. . . . . . . . . • • 1/25
For continuous spans, the span length shall be
considered as the distance between dead-
load points of contraflexure.
If depths less than these are used, the sections shall be so
increased that the maximum deflection will be not greater than
if these ratios had not been exceeded.
3.6.12 Symmetrical Sections.
Main members shall be proportioned so that their gravity
axes will be as nearly as practicable in the centre of the section.
3.6.13 Effective Area of Angles in Tension.
The effective area of a single angle tension member, or
of each angle of a double tension member in which the angles
are connected back to back on the same side of a gusset plate,
shall be assumed as the net area of the connected leg plus
one-half of the area of the unconnected leg.
If a double angle tension member is connected with the
angles back to back on opposite sides of a gusset plate, the
full net area of the angles shall be considered as effective.
If the angles connect the separate gusset plates, as in the
case of a double-webbed truss, and the angles are connected by
stay plates located as near the gussets as practicable or by other
effective means, the full net area of the angles shall be con-
sidered as effective. If the angles are not so connected, only
80 per cent, of the net area shall be considered as effective.


Lug angles may be considered as effective in transmitting
stress, provided they are connected with at least one-third more
rivets than required by the stress to be carried by the lug
angle. .
3.6.14 Thickness of Metal.
Gusset plates for main members shall not be less than |-inch
in thickness. Other structural steel, except for webs of rolled
shapes, fillers, and in railings, shall be not less than 5/16-inch
in thickness. The web thickness of rolled shapes shall not be
less than 0.23 inch. Silicon steel plates shall be not more
than 1| inches thick, low-alloy steel plates not more than 1J
inches thick and nickel steel plates not more than 1 inch in
thickness.
Metal exposed to marked corrosive influences shall be
increased in thickness or specially protected against corrosion.
3.6.15 Compression Members.
Compression members shall be so designed that the main
elements of the section will be connected directly to the gusset
plates, pins, or other members. -
The centre of gravity of a built-up section shall coincide
as nearly as practicable with the centre of the section. Prefer-
ably the segments shall be connected by solid webs.
In members consisting of segments connected by cover plates
or lacing, or segments connected by webs, the thickness of the
webs of the segments shall be not less than 1/32 of the un-
supported distance between the nearest rivet lines or the roots
of flanges of rolled segments for carbon steel, 1/28 for silicon
steel, 1/26 for low-alloy steel or 1/25 for nickel steel.
The thickness of cover plates or webs connecting the seg-
ments shall be not less than 1/40 of the supported distance
between the nearest lines of their connecting rivets or the roots
of their rolled flanges for carbon steel, 1/36 for silicon steel,
1/34 for low-alloy steel or 1/32 for nickel steel.
3.6.16 Web Plates of Solid Rib Arches.
The thickness of web plates in solid rib arches shall not
be less than the following fractions of the depth as defined in
article 3.16.15, except that when the web is reinforced along its
axis with a longitudinal rib of ample cross-sectional area and
rigidity the thickness shall not be less than one-half of these
amounts:
1/60 for carbon steel. » !r'
1/50 for silicon steel.
1/48 for low-alloy steel.
1/45 for nickel steel. ’ ; -■


3.6.17 Outstanding Legs of Angles and Bearing Stiffeners.
The widths of outstanding legs of angles in compression
(except where reinforced by plates) shall not exceed the
following:
In girder flanges and bearing stiffeners, twelve times the
thickness.
In main members carrying axial stress, twelve times the
thickness.
In bracing and other secondary members, sixteen times
the thickness.
3.6.18 Size of Pins.
Pins shall be proportioned for the maximum shears and
bending moments produced by the stresses in the members
connected. If there are eyebars among the parts connected,
the diameter of the pin shall be not less than o.B' of the width
of the widest bar.
/ ;
Details of Design.
3.6.19 Size of Rivets.
Rivets shall be of the size shown on the drawings, but
generally shall be f-inch or |-inch in diameter. Rivets f-inch
in diameter shall not be used in members carrying calculated
stress except in 2J inch legs of angles and in flanges of sections
requiring f-inch rivets.
The diameter of rivets in angles carrying calculated stress
shall not exceed one-fourth of the width of the leg in which
they are driven.
In angles whose size is not determined by calculated stress,
f-inch rivets may be used in 2-inch legs, f-inch rivets in 21-inch
legs, f-incli rivets in 3-inch legs, and 1-inch rivets in 31-inch
legs.
Structural shapes which do not admit the use of f-inch
diameter rivets shall not be used except in handrails.

For f-inch rivets, 2 \ inches.
For f-inch rivets, 2f inches.


3.6.21 Pitch in Ends of Compression Members.
In the ends of compression members the pitch of rivets
connecting the component parts of the member shall not exceed
four times the diameter of the rivet for a length equal to li
times the maximum width of the member. Beyond this point
the pitch shall be increased gradually for a length equal to
times the maximum width of the member until the maximum
pitch is reached.
3.2.22 Maximum Pitch.
The maximum pitch in the line of stress shall not exceed
6 inches or sixteen times the thickness of the thinnest outside
plate or angle connected, except that in angles having two
gauge lines with the rivets staggered, the pitch in each line
may be twice that given by these rules, with a maximum of
10 inches.
3.6.23 Stitch Rivets.
If two or more plates or shapes are in contact, they shall be
held together by stitch rivets In compression members, the
stitch rivets shall be spaced on a gauge line, in the direction
perpendicular to the line of stress not more than twenty-four
times the thickness of the thinnest plate, and, in the line of
stress, not more than twelve times the thickness of the thin-
nest outer plate. In tension members and girders, the stitch
rivets shall be spaced on a pitch not more than twenty-four
times the thickness of the thinnest outer plate. In tension
members composed of two angles in contact, the angles shall
be held together by stitch rivets having a maximum pitch of

3.6.25 Long Rivets. ”
Rivets subjected to calculated stress and having a grip in
excess of 4| diameters ■ shall be increased in number at least
1 per cent, for each additional 1/16-inch of grip. If the grip
exceeds six times the diameter of the rivet, specially designed
rivets shall be used. •
3.6.25 Rivets in Tension.

3.6.27 Parts Accessible.
The accessibility Of all parts of a structure for inspection,
cleaning and painting shall be secured by the proper proportion-
ing of members and the design of their details.

Closed sections, and pockets or depressions which will retain
water, shall be avoided so far as practicable. Pockets shall be
provided with effective drain holes or be filled with waterproof-
ing material.

in riveted structures shall have milled ends and full contact
bearing at the splices.
Splices, whether in tension, compression, bending or shear,

the strength of the member, or section, but they shall be
designed to transmit through the splice material not less than
75 per cent, of the strength of the member. The splice shall

members spliced.
3.6.32 Indirect Splices.
If splice plates are not in direct contact with the parts which
they connect, the number of rivets on each side of the joint
shall be in excess of the number required for a direct-contact
splice to the extent of two extra transverse lines of rivets for
each intervening plate.
3.6.33 Fillers.

When welding is called for on the plans, it shall be designed
according to the relevant specifications of the Standards Asso-
ciation of Australia.
(&) Riveting.
If rivets carrying stress pass through fillers, the fillers,
preferably, shall be extended beyond the connected member and
the extension secured by enough additional rivets to average
the total stress in the member over the combined area of the
member plus the fillers. As an alternative, the additional rivets
may be passed through the connected members without extend-
ing the filler.
If the filler is less than 1-inch thick it shall not be extended
beyond the splicing material and additional rivets are not
required. Fillers 1-inch or more in thickness shall consist of
not more than two plates, unless special permission is given by
the engineer.


3.6.34 Gusset Plates.
Gusset or connecting plates shall be used for connecting main
members, except when they are pin-connected. The rivets con-
necting each member shall be symmetrical with the axis of the
member, so far as practicable, and the full development of the
elements of the member shall be given consideration. The
gusset plates shall be of ample thickness to resist shear, direct
stress, and flexure, acting on the weakest or critical section
of maximum stress.
Ee-entrant cuts, except curves made for appearance, shall
be avoided as far as practicable.

where the lacing is interrupted. In main members, the length
of the end stay plates between end rivets shall be not less than
II times the distance between the inner lines of rivets con-
necting them to the flanges; and the length of intermediate
stay plates between end rivets, not less than | of that distance.
In lateral struts and other secondary members, the over-all
length of end and intermediate stay plates shall be not less
than I of the distance between the inner lines of rivets con-
necting them to the flanges.

lacing. End stay plates shall have the same minimum length
as specified for end stay plates on main compression members
and intermediate stay plates shall have a minimum length of
| of that specified for intermediate stay plates on main com-
pression members. The clear distance between stay plates
on tension members shall not exceed 3 feet.
The thickness of stay plates shall be not less than 1/50
of the distance between the inner lines of rivets connecting

For structural carbon steel,
L ~
y— — lOO _i_ _L
100 L+ 10 ' 100
_ r
For structural silicon, low-alloy and nickel steel,
ll'
y _ P 100 i L
100 L + 10 60 in which
_ r
V = normal shearing stress in pounds.
P = allowable compressive axial load on members.
L = length of member in inches.
r = radius of gyration of section about the axis per-
pendicular to plane of lacing in inches.
To the shear so determined shall be added any shear due
to the weight of the member or to other forces, and the lacing
proportioned for the combined shear.
The shear shall be considered as divided equally among all
parallel planes in which there are shear-resisting elements,
whether continuous plates or lacing. The section of the lacing
bars shall be determined by the formula for axial compression
in which L is taken as the distance along the bar between
its connections to the main segments for single lacing and 70
per cent, of that distance for double lacing.
If the distance across the member between the rivet lines in
the flanges is more than 15 inches and a bar with a single rivet
in the connection is used, the lacing shall be double and riveted
at the intersections.

ber shall be approximately 45 degrees for double lacing and 60
degrees for single lacing.
Lacing bars may be shapes or flat bars. For main members

3.6.38 Net Section of Riveted Tension Members.
The net section of a riveted tension member is the sum of
the net sections of its component parts. The net section of a
part is the product of the thickness of the part multiplied by
its least net width.
The net width for any chain of holes extending progressively
across the part shall be obtained by deducting from the gross
width the sum of the diameters of all the holes in the chain
and adding, for each gauge space in the chain, the quantity:
?!
%
Where S = pitch of any two successive holes in the chain.
g = gauge of the same holes.
The net section of the part is obtained from the chain which
gives the least net width.
For angles, the gross width shall be the sum of the widths
of the legs less the thickness. The gauge for holes in the
opposite legs shall be the sum of gauges from back pf angle
less the thickness.
For splice members, the thickness shall be only that part
of the thickness of the member which has been developed by
rivets beyond the section considered.

outstanding flanges will allow. At least one full width plate
on each segment shall extend to the far edge of the stay plate

shall be enough pin plates on forked ends to make the section
of each jaw equal to that of the member. The pin plates
shall be long enough to develop the pin plate beyond the near
edge of the stay plate, but not less than the length required by
article 3.6.40.
3.6.42 Pins and Pin Nuts.
Pins shall be of sufficient length to secure a full bearing
of all parts connected upon the turned body of the pin. They

shall be connected by substantial side bars and shall be guided
by gearing or other effectual means to prevent lateral move-
ment, skewing and creeping. The rollers and bearing plates
shall be protected from dirt and water as far as practicable,

to prevent uplift under the assumed lateral loadings. In
general, the width of a bent at its base shall be not less than
one-third of its height.
3.6.99 Single Bents.
Single bents shall have hinged ends or else be designed to
resist bending.

SECTION 7.—CONCRETE DESIGN.
3.7.l—General Assumptions.
The design of reinforced concrete members under these speci-
fications shall be based on the following assumptions:
(1) Calculations are made with reference to unit working
stresses and safe loads, as elsewhere specified herein, rather
than with reference to ultimate strength and ultimate loads.
(2) A plane section before bending remains plane after
bending.
(3) The modulus of elasticity of concrete-in compression
is constant within the limits of working stresses; the dis-
tribution of compressive stress in flexure is, therefore, rec-
tilinear.

(4) The ratio “n” shall be assumed as follows:
Values of n = —-
Ec
In computing the ultimate deflection of slabs and beams,
the value of the modulus of elasticity of concrete should he
assumed as one-twelfth that of steel in order to allow for the
effect of plastic flow.
(5) Concrete shall be assumed as offering no tensile resis-
tance.
(6) The bond between concrete and metal reinforcement
is assumed to remain unbroken throughout the range of
working stresses. Under compression the two materials are
therefore stressed in proportion to their moduli of elasticity.
(7) Initial stress in the reinforcement, due to contraction
or expansion of the concrete, is neglected except in the design
of reinforced concrete columns.
(8) For the determination of external reactions, moments,
shears, and deflections, moments of inertia of rigid frame and
continuous structures shall be computed for the gross concrete
sections, neglecting the effect of steel reinforcing, except that
the transformed area of the steel shall be included for
columns, arches or other compressive members.
(9) The moment of inertia of the entire superstructure sec-
tions, except railings or any kerbs or footways not placed
monolithically with the superstructure before the false work
is released, and the moment of inertia of the full cross sec-
tion of the pier or bent shall be used to determine the elastic
properties of the various spans and supports.
(10) The depth of girder or slab to be used in computing
moment of inertia at the centreline of support shall be ob-
tained by extending the slope of the intrados of the member
to the centreline when the member is integral with the sup-
port.


(11) Rigid frames shall be considered free to sway longi-
tudinally due to the application of vertical dead loads and
vertically applied live loads, except when the structure is
restrained from movement by external forces.
(12) The assumption of no moment restraint at the base
of column shall be used in the analysis of rigid frames (super-
structures) unless the base is known to be fully fixed. When
a pinned end condition is assumed for the analysis of the
superstructure, the base of column, footing and piling shall
be designed to resist the moment resulting from an assumed
restraint varying from zero to full fixity. The degree of
restraint shall be determined by the type of footing and the
character of the foundation material.
(13) Piers or bents constructed integrally with footings
placed on a skew exceeding 10° shall be considered fixed at
the top of footing.

according to formulas given in article 3.4.6.
(e) Spiral Columns.
The safe load for spiral columns shall be determined accord-
ing to formulas given in article 3.4.6.
3.7.4—Span Lengths.
The effective span lengths of slabs shall be as specified in
article 3.3.2,
The effective span length of freely supported beams shall be
the distance from centre to centre of the supports, but shall
not exceed the clear span plus the depth of beam.
For the analysis of all rigid frames, the span lengths shall
bo taken as the distance between the centres of bearings at
the top of the footings.
The span length of continuous or restrained floor slabs and
beams shall be the clear distance between faces of support.
Where fillets making an angle of 45 degrees or more with the
axis of a continuous or restrained slab are built monolithic
with the slab and support, the span shall be measured from the
section where the combined depth of the slab and fillet is at
least one and one-half times the thickness of slab. Maximum
negative moments are to be considered as existing at the ends
of the span, as above defined. FTo portion of the fillet shall be
considered as adding to the effective depth of the slab.


3.7.5 Expansion.
In general, provision for temperature changes shall be made
in all simple spans having a clear length in excess of 30 feet.
In continuous bridges, provision shall be made in the design
to resist thermal stresses induced or means shall be provided
for movement caused by temperature changes.
Expansion not otherwise provided for shall be provided by
means of hinged columns, rockers, sliding plates or other
devices.
3.7.6 T-Beams.
(o) Effective Flange Width.
In beam and slab construction, effective and adequate bond
and shear resistance shall be provided at the junction of the
beam and slab. The slab may then be considered an integral
part of the beam, but its assumed effective width as a T-beam
flange shall not exceed the following:
(1) One-fourth of the span length of the beam.
(2) The distance centre to centre of beams.
(3) Twelve times the least thickness of the slab plus the
width of the girder stem.
For beams having a flange on one side only, the effective
overhanging flange width shall not exceed one-twelfth of the
span length of the beam, nor six times the thickness of the
slab, nor one-half the clear distance to the next beam.
(h) Shear.
The flange shall not be considered as effective in computing
the shear and diagonal tension resistance of T-beams.
( c ) Isolated Beams.
Isolated beams, in which the T-form is used only for the
purpose of providing additional compression area, shall have
a flange thickness of not less than one-half the width of the
web, and a total flange width of not more than four times the
width of web,
( d ) Diaphragms.
For T-beam spans over 40 feet in length diaphragms or
spreaders shall be placed between the beams at the middle or
at the third points.


3.7.7—Reinforcement.
(a) Spacing.
The minimum spacing centre to centre of parallel bars shall
be two and a half times the diameter of round or three times
the side dimensions of square bars, but in no case shall the clear
distance between the bars be less than one and a half times the
maximum size of the coarse aggregate.
(&) Covering.
The minimum covering, measured from the surface of the
concrete to the face of any reinforcing steel shall be not less
than 1-1- inches except in slabs where the minimum covering
shall be 1 inch. In the footings of abutments and retaining
walls and in piers, the minimum covering shall be 2 inches.
In work exposed to the action of the sea water, the minimum
covering shall be 3 inches except in precast concrete piles,
where a minimum of 2 inches may be used.
In no case shall the minimum covering measured from the
surface of the concrete to the face of any reinforcing steel be
less than one and one half (1J) times the diameter of the steel.
Where slabs as in the case of box culvert floors are cast directly
on to the ground the minimum cover shall be not less than
inches.
These minimum dimensions are only to be used where con-
ditions are favourable and good workmanship is assured.
( c) Splicing.
Tensile reinforcement shall not be spliced at points of maxi-
mum stress. When reinforcement is spliced, the spliced bars
shall lap sufficiently to develop the full strength in bond.
(d) Allowable Capacity of End Anchorage — Hooks.
End anchorage shall be designed to develop a stress of 10,000
pounds per square inch in the bars. End anchorage may be
an extension of the bar or hook. In either case the additional
length of bar should provide the needed anchorage by normal
bond stress, assumed to be uniformly distributed over the
additional embedded surface. A properly dimensioned hook
is one in which the bar is bent in a full semicircle, with a
radius of bend not less than three diameters, plus an extension
at the free end of at least four bar diameters. Right angles
or other abrupt bends, which do not engage a structural steel
member, are not to be considered as anchorage unless the
radius of the bend is at least four bar diameters and the total
length from beginning of bend to the free end of the bar is
at least sixteen bar diameters.


(e) Extension of Reinforcement.
(1) To provide for contingencies arising from unanticipated
distribution of loads, yielding of supports, shifting of points
of inflection, or other lack of agreement with assumed condi-
tions governing the design of elastic structures, the reinforce-
ment shall be extended at the supports and at other points
between the supports as- indicated in (2) to (5) below. These
paragraphs relate to ordinary anchorage and are the mini-
mum requirements under which normal working stresses for
bond or shear are permitted.
(2) Negative tensile reinforcement at the supported end
of a restrained or cantilever beam or member of a rigid frame
shall be extended in or through the supporting member in
such a manner as to develop the maximum tension in the
bar with a bond stress not exceeding the normal working stress
provided in article 3.4.7.
(3) Between the supports of continuous or simple beams,
every reinforcing bar shall be extended at least 15 diameters
but not less than 1/20 of the span length, beyond the point
at which computations indicate it is no longer needed to resist
stress.
(4) In simple beams and freely supported ends of con-
tinuous beams, at least of the positive reinforcement shall
extend beyond the face of the supports a distance sufficient
to develop J the allowable stress in the bars.
(6) In restrained or continuous beams at least \ of the
positive reinforcement shall extend beyond the face of the
supports and the remainder treated as provided in (3).
(/) Maximum Sizes.
The maximum size of bar reinforcement shall be 1J inches
square or equivalent, unless the particular conditions warrant
the adoption of special reinforcement design. When struc-
tural steel shapes are used for reinforcement, no section hav-
ing a surface area per foot of length of more than 150 square
inches shall be used as a reinforcing member unless mechani-
cal bond is provided by means of lugs, bars or other details
which will effectively bond the member to the surrounding
concrete mass.
3.7. B—Compression Reinforcement in Beams.
Compression reinforcement in girders and beams shall be
secured against buckling by ties or stirrups adequately
anchored in the concrete, and spaced not more than 16 bar
diameters apart. Where compression reinforcement is used,
its effectiveness in resisting bending may be taken as twice


the value indicated from the calculations assuming a straight-
line relation between stress and strain and the modular rela-
tion of stress in steel to stress in concrete given in article
3.7.1 (4). However, in no case should a stress in compression
reinforcement greater than 16,000 pounds per square inch
be allowed.
3.7.9—Web Reinforcement.
(a) General.
When the allowable unit shearing stress for concrete is
exceeded, web reinforcement shall be provided by one of the
following methods:
(1) Longitudinal bars bent up in series or in a single
plane.
(2) Vertical stirrups.
(3) Combination of bent-up bars and vertical stirrups.
When any of the above methods of reinforcement are pro-
vided, the concrete shall be assumed to carry no shear, the whole
being carried by the web reinforcement.
The webs of T-beams shall be reinforced with vertical stirrups
in all cases.
(b) Bent-up Bars.
Bent-up bars used as web reinforcement may be bent at any
angle between 20 and 45 degrees with the longitudinal reinforce-
ment. The radius of bend shall not be less than 4 diameters
of the bar.
The spacing of bent-up bars shall be measured at the neutral
axis and in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
beam. This spacing shall meet the requirements of article
3.Y.3 (c) and shall not exceed three-fourths the effective depth
of the beam. The first bar from the support shall cross the
mid-depth of the beam at a distance from the face of the
support, measured parallel to the longitudinal axis of the beam,
not greater than one-half the effective depth.
(c) Vertical Stirrups.
The spacing of vertical stirrups shall not exceed three-fourths
of the effective depth of the beam. The first stirrups shall be
placed at a distance from the face of the support not greater
than one-fourth of the effective depth of the beam. Stirrups
shall surround three sides of the tensile reinforcement.
( d ) Anchorage.
(1) The stress in a stirrup or other web reinforcement shall
not exceed the capacity of its anchorage in the upper or lower
one-half of the effective depth of the beam.


(2) Web reinforcement which is provided by bending into
an inclined position one or more bars of the main tensile rein-
forcement where not required for resistance to positive or nega-
tive bending, may be considered completely anchored by
continuity with the main tensile reinforcement, or by em-
bedment of the requisite length in the upper or lower half
of the beam, provided at least one-half of such embedment is
as close to the upper or lower surface of the beam as the
requirements of fire and rust protection allow. A hook placed
close to the upper or lower surface of the beam may be sub-
stituted for a portion of such embedment.
(3) Stirrups shall be anchored at both ends by one of the
following methods, or by a combination thereof:
(a) Rigid attachment, as by welding, to the main longi-
tudinal reinforcement.
(h) Bending around and closely in contact with a bar of
the longitudinal reinforcement, in the form of a U-
stirrup or hook.
(c) A hook placed as close to the upper or lower surface
of the beam as the requirements of fire and rust
protection will allow. In estimating the capacity of
this anchorage the stress developed by bond between
midheight of the beam and the centre of bending of
the hook may be added to the capacity of the hook.
( d ) An adequate length of embedment in the upper or
lower one-half of the effective depth of the beam,
whether straight or bent. Anchorage of this type
alone should not be relied on for stirrups in cases
where the shearing stress in the web exceeds that
recommended for beams without end anchorage of the
reinforcement. (See article 3.4.7.)
3.7.lo—Columns.
( a ) General.
The ratio of unsupported length of plain concrete piers and
pedestals to their least dimension shall not exceed 3. The
minimum dimension of any column shall be 12 inches.
Tor the design of short and long columns see article
3.4.6.
( h ) Columns with Lateral Ties.
The reinforcement of columns shall consist of at least 4
longitudinal bars tied together with lateral ties or hoops enclos-
ing the longitudinal reinforcement.


The ( longitudinal reinforcement shall be of bars not lees
than f-inch in diameter and shall have a total cross sectional
area of not less than 1.0 per cent, of the total cross sectional
area of the column except that this percentage may be reduced
in the case of columns or pier shafts which, for architectural
reasons, have a larger cross section than required by considera-
tions of loading.
Reinforcement in excess of 4 per cent, of the cross sectional
area of the column shall not be considered in computing com-
pressive stresses. The lateral ties or hoops shall be not less
than 1-inch in diameter and spaced not farther apart than 12
inches.
(c) Spiral Columns.
(1) The longitudinal reinforcement shall consist of at least
six bars of minimum diameter of |-inch and of an effective
cross sectional area not less than 1 per cent, nor more than
6 per cent, of that of the core. The number of bars con-
centrated in the ring at the periphery of the core shall be
governed by the spacing requirements for parallel bars in
beams and in case all the bars cannot be placed at the periphery
of the core, the bars within shall be stayed at intervals of 24
inches and shall not be nearer to the outer ring than 2/10 times
the core diameter.
(2) The ratio of the spiral reinforcement shall be not less
than one-fourth the ratio of the longitudinal reinforcement.
Spiral reinforcement shall consist of evenly spaced continuous
spirals held firmly in place and true to line by at least three
vertical spacer bars. At the ends of all spirals and at points
of splice the outside diameter shall be maintained.
The centre to centre spacing of the spirals shall not be
greater than one-sixth of the diameter of the core and the
clear distance between spirals shall not exceed 3 inches nor
be less than If inches or times the maximum size of the
coarse aggregate.
(3) Reinforcement shall be protected everywhere by a cover-
ing of concrete cast monolithic with the core having a mini-
mum thickness of li inches.
( d ) Flexure and Direct Stress.
(1) General. —When the columns are subjected to bending
stresses due to eccentric loads, monolithic construction or lateral
forces, they shall be so proportioned that the combined direct
and bending stresses shall not exceed the allowable unit com-
pressive stresses herein specified.


(2) Special Cases.—When the plane of bending does not' lie
on a principal axis of the column section or within the core
radius, the position and direction of the neutral axis shall be
determined by a solution of the following formula:
p m* —la 1 k-h-M '
A + “JUT' x ‘ + , Y » = °
* 1 h ~T~'
P = load parallel to the axis of column, in lb.
A ,= transformed area of cracked section in sq. in.
= component of moment parallel to X axis.
M y = component of moment parallel to Y axis,
Xo = co-ordinate distance from centre of gravity of the
cracked section parallel to the X axis, in inches.
Y 0 = co-ordinate distance from centre of gravity parallel
to Y axis, in inches.
I* = the moment of inertia of “A ” along the X axis
about the centroidal axis Y, in (inches) 4 .
I y = the moment of inertia along the axis Y, in (inches.) 4
I xy = product of inertia of “A ” about the axes X and Y
through the centroid.
In solving the above formula it is necessary to assume a value
or either X 0 or Y O .
Formulas for Stresses.
With the position and the direction of the neutral axis deter-
mined, the maximum unit stress in the concrete shall be com-
puted with the formula,
/ = -y-Y n or / T — X n , in which
l y G
Y w = distance from the neutral axis to the extreme
fibre in compression parallel to the Y axis.
X„ = distance to extreme fibre parallel to the X axis.
Xote.— The above formulas are based on a study by Pro- '
lessor Hardy Cross on “Column Analogy.” For the procedure
and methods employed in the application of the formulas refer-
ence is made to an article by W T illiam G. S. “Analysing
Xon-Homogeneous Sections Subjected to Bending and Direct
Stress.”
(3) Columns in Earth Fills. —Columns placed in earth fills,
as in the case of “pedestals” or “buried” abutments, shall be
designed to withstand the earth pressure from the rear, dis-
regarding the effect of the fill in front.
* Civil Engineering Yol. No. 10, March, 1940.


3.7.ll—Concrete Arches.
(а) Shape of Arch Ring.
Arch rings shall be selected as to shape in such manner that
the axis of the ring shall conform, as nearly as practicable, to
either the equilibrium polygon for full dead load or to the
equilibrium polygon for full dead plus one-half live load over
the full span, whichever produces the smallest bending stresses
under combined loads.
(б) Spandrel Walls.
When the spandrel walls of filled spandrel arches exceed 8
feet in height above the extrados they shall be designed as
vertical slabs supported by transverse diaphragm walls or deep
counterforts. Vertical cantilever walls over 8 feet in height,
or counterforts having a back slope of less than 45 degrees with
the vertical, shall not be used, on account of the excessive and
indeterminate stresses set up in the arch ring by torsion.
(c) Expansion Joints.
Vertical expansion joints shall be placed in the spandrel
walls of arches to provide for movement due to temperature
change and arch deflection. These joints shall be placed at the
ends of spans and at intermediate points, generally not more
than 50 feet apart.
( d ) Reinforcement.
Arch ribs in reinforced concrete construction shall be rein-
forced with a complete double line of longitudinal reinforce-
ment consisting of an intradosal system and an extradosal
system connected by a series of stirrups or tie-rods.
For barrel arches, a system of transverse reinforcement,
thoroughly anchored to the longitudinal reinforcement, shall be
used in both intrados and extrados. The transverse reinforce-
ment shall be proportioned to resist the bending stresses due
to any overturning action of the spandrel wall.
For rib arches, hoops Or tie-bars shall be used in connection
with the longitudinal rib reinforcement as in the case of rein-
forced concrete columns.
(e) Waterproofing.
Preferably, the top of the arch ring and the interior faces
of the spandrel walls of all filled spandrel arches shall be water-
proofed with a membrane waterproofing constructed in accord-
ance with the requirements specified in Division 11.
(/) Drainage of Spandrel Fill.
The fills of filled spandrel arches shall be effectively drained
by a system of tile drains or French drains laid along the inter-
section of the spandrel walls and arch rings and discharging


through suitable outlets in the piers and abutments. The
location and details of the drainage outlets shall be such as to
eliminate, as far as possible, the discoloration by drainage water
of the exposed masonry faces.
3.7.l2—Viaduct Bents and Towers.
When concrete columns are used in viaduct construction,
bents and towers shall be effectively braced by means of longi-
tudinal and transverse struts. For height greater than 40
feet, both longitudinal and transverse cross or diagonal bracing,
preferably, shall be used and the footings for the columns
forming a single bent shall be thoroughly tied together.
SECTION B.—TIMBER STRUCTURES.
Each State Authority shall follow its existing practice.
SECTION 9.—COMPOSITE BEAMS.
3.9.1 General Assumptions. /
Specifications pertaining to the design of concrete, steel, and
timber structures shall govern the design of composite beams
where such specifications are applicable.
Composite beams shall be proportioned by the moment of
inertia of the net composite sections.
3.9.2 Effective Flange Width.
In composite beam construction the assumed effective width
of the slab as a T-beam flange shall not exceed the following:—
(a) One-fourth of the span length of the beam.
(h) The distance centre to centre of beams.
(cj Twelve times the least thickness of the slab.
For beams having a flange on one side oilly, the effective
flange width shall not exceed one-twelfth of the span length
of the beam, nor six times the thickness of the slab, nor one-
half the distance centre to centre of the next beam.
Composite beam type construction shall not be used for
isolated beams.
3.9.3 Stresses.
Maximum compressive and tensile stresses in beams, which
are not provided with temporary supports during placing of the
permanent dead load, shall be the sum of the stresses produced


by the dead loads acting on the beam before the concrete slab
has set and the stresses produced by the superimposed loads
acting on the composite beam. Where beams are provided
with temporary intermediate supports during the placing of
the permanent dead load, the stresses shall be computed on the
basis of the composite section.
3.9.4 Shear.
Resistance to horizontal shear shall be provided by mechanical
means at the junction of the slab and the beam or girder.
Shear shall be computed by the following formula: —
q _ YQ
s “ i
in which S = the horizontal shear per linear inch at the
junction of the slab and beam at the point of the beam in
question.
Y== total shear due to superimposed load after concrete in
slab has set.
Q = statical moment (product of the compressive area of
slab and the distance from its centre to the neutral axis of
the composite section),
I = moment of inertia of composite section.
Spacing of the shear devices shall be determined by dividing
the resistance value of the individual shear device by the shear
per linear inch “S”, with a maximum spacing of 2 feet.
The flange of the composite beam shall not be considered
effective in computing the resistance to vertical shear and
diagonal tension. These forces shall be assumed to be resisted
entirely by the beam or girder web.
3.9.5 Deflection.
The requirements relative to deflection for independent slab
and beam construction shall govern the design of composite
beams. Where the beam is not provided with temporary sup-
ports during the placing of the "slab or other permanent dead
loads, the deflection resulting from prestressing of the beam
shall be added to the deflection produced by superimposed loads
on the composite beam.
3.9.6 Shear Devices.
. Mechanical means which are used at the junction of beam
and slab for the purpose of furnishing the shear resistance
necessary to produce composite beam action shall conform to


the specifications of the respective materials as provided in
Division IV. The shear devices shall be of such construction
as will permit a thorough compaction of the concrete mass
and will insure entire surfaces of shear devices being in contact
with surrounding concrete.
The nature of the shear devices shall be such as to prevent
a vertical separation of the slab and beams or else additional
means shall be provided for this purpose.
SECTION 10.—RATING OF EXISTING BRIDGES.
3.10.1 General.
The specifications set forth in this section shall be used in
determining the rating of existing structures for inventory
purposes and for determining the safe live load capacity of
existing structures.
3.10.2 Field Inspection.
As a basis for the rating of existing structures, adequate
information as to the dimensions and condition of the members
in the structure shall be provided by competent field inspection.
The data provided shall include line diagrams showing lengths
and positions of all members, detailed dimensions of all mem-
bers and connections, supplemented by sketches as necessary;
detailed information as to the condition of the material showing
reduced sections due to deterioration, accident, or other cause;
and any other pertinent information that will aid in the intelli-
gent evaluation of the structure. The field inspection shall be
made under the direction of a thoroughly trained and competent
engineer who should be familiar with all phases of bridge
design and construction.
3.10.3 Inventory Ratings.
The inventory rating shall be a classification of existing
bridges in terms of the standard H loadings. The inventory
rating shall be determined as follows:
(1) The load-carrying value of each member, connection, or
part of the structure shall be determined in accordance with
the unit working stresses and design precedure set forth in
the design division of these specifications. In this determina-
tion, due consideration shall be given to deterioration of
material, loss of section, type of material, and physical con-
dition as shown by field examination. Where dimensions of
'members are outside the limits for which design formulas
are applicable, the procedure set up in articles which follow
shall be used.


(2) The dead load stress in each member and connection
of the structure shall be determined.
(3) The difference between the load-carrying value and
the dead load stress gives the stress capacity available for
live load and impact.
(4) The live load stress in each member and connection
under the standard H-15 loading, with suitable impact factor,
is computed.
(5) The available stress capacity, (3), divided by the H-15
live load and impact stress, (4), gives a factor which when
multiplied by 15 is the inventory or H rating of the member
or connection.
The inventory rating of the structure is the rating of the
weakest member or connection.
(6) In the case of such timber and other bridges which
are not capable of being accurately assessed by ordinary
design methods, the Inventory Eating shall be determined
by engineering judgment, aided, as far as practicable, by
the methods of assessment set out above.
j
3.10.4 Special Permit Rating.
Special permits may be granted for occasional loads greater
than the Inventory Eating set out above. For this rating, the
working stresses as determined under clause 3.10.8 may be
increased by 25 per cent.
3.10.5 Dead Load.
The dead load on the structure shall consist of the weight
of the structure plus any attachments thereto. It shall be
determined by actual field inspection. The unit weights shall
be assumed to be those set forth in article 3.2.2.
3.10.6 Live Load.
The live load used in establishing the inventory or H rating
shall be the H loading with impact as given in article 3.2.5.
3.10.7 Minimum Wind Load.
The minimum wind load provision of paragraphs (2) and
(3), article 3.2.14, shall not apply in the calculations for special
permit rating.


3.10.8 Unit Stresses.
The unit working stresses used in determining the load-
carrying capacity of each member of a structure shall take
into account the type and condition of material from which
the member is made.
3.10.9 Traffic Lanes.
The lane loadings or truck loadings shall be considered to
occupy lanes, each having a width of 10 feet for bridges of
over 20 feet in width. For bridges having a roadway width of
at least 16 feet but less than 20 feet, the vehicle shall be
considered to occupy half of the available roadway. On struc-
tures having a roadway width of less than 16 feet, a maximum
load lane 10 feet in width shall be placed so as to give the
maximum stress in the member under consideration.
3.10.10 — Compression on Flanges of Beams and Girders.
Compression in the extreme fibre of rolled shapes,, girders,
and built sections subject to bending when the value L/6 is
less than forty shall be limited to the value given by the
formula in article 3.4.2. For such members whose L /b ratio
exceeds forty, the maximum stress shall be limited to the value
given by the following formula;
Jc
V = *
i+— C-l*
+ 2000 l_ 6 J
Where : p = allowable compressive unit stress.
L = distance in inches between points of definite
lateral support.
h = flange width of beam or girder in inches.
Jc = 18,000 for inventory rating.
In determining “L” in the above formula, it can be assumed
that well-seated and properly-bearing timber stringers furnish
adequate lateral support.
3.10.11 — Details of Design.
(a) Strength of Connections.
For the purpose of rating, connections having a capacity
equal to the stress in the member connected shall be considered
adequate.


(fc) Splices.
For compression splices with milled ends in contact, 70 per
cent, of the stress may be considered to be taken in bearing,
in which case, splice plates and rivets with a capacity equal to
30 per cent, of the stress across the splice shall be considered
adequate. For the purposes of rating structures, lug angles
and shelf angles shall be considered effective in carrying stress.
(c) Pins.
For the purpose of rating, the stress in the outer fibre of
pins need not be computed unless the lever arm of the couple
producing the moment is greater than the diameter of the pin.

P = load parallel to the axis of the member in lb.
A = gross cross-sectional area of column in sq. in.
f y = yield point stress in tension,
= 33,000 lb. per sq. in. for structural steel.
7j = factor of safety based on yield point,
= 1-76 for structural steel.
c = distance from neutral axis to the extreme fibre in
compression.

L = 75% of the total length of a column having riveted
end connections.
= 87-5% of the total length of a column having pinned
end connections.
E = modulus of elasticity of steel,
= 30,000,000 lb. per sq. in.
B = \/a 2 —2a cos 6 -j- I
a =— : When e g and e s lie on the same side of the column

When +e s = + e g , a = + 1
When e s = 0, a = 0
When +e s = — e g , a= 1
* Refer also to the column formulas given in Article 3.4.2.
** When the radius of gyration perpendicular to the plane of

When the values of end moments are not computed but
considered negligible in amount, a shall be assumed equal to -(-1.
a shall be assumed equal to -f-1 for a member subject to bending
stresses induced by the components of externally applied loads
acting perpendicular to its axis. For this case the general
formula becomes:

d = deflection due to the transverse components of
externally applied loads, in inches.
I = moment of inertia of section about an axis perpen-
dicular to the plane of bending, in (inches) 4 .
M = moment due to the transverse components of
externally applied loads, in inch-pounds.
Note : The value of 0*25 in the above formulas provides for
inherent crookedness and unknown eccentricity.
