MOIRA AND LESLEY POPE


Herein you’ll find the Kangaroo ,
If he Platypus , Koala ,
Rabbit and some Insects small ,
Birds, Reptiles , Beasts — you’ll find them all.
Toull find the stately Jabiru,
If he Brolga bird will dance for you;
If he Penguin and the Shark youll meet ,
Emu and the Bower-bird sweet.


THE LYRE-BIRD
The Lyre-Bird—or at least, the male,
Can boast a most entrancing tail,
A lovely voice, a nature shy;
At night he roosts in branches high.


THE LOCUST
The Locust, such a rowdy creature,
Has one very funny feature —
A thing you’ll very seldom see,
He wears his ear below his knee!
In school, for little girls and boys,
He makes a simply lovely noise!
[ 8 ]


THE PLATYPUS
It’s rather difficult for us
To find the duck-billed Platypus.
On land —in water —swift and spry,
Of humans he is very shy.
The Platypus won’t cry or howl —
He answers only with a growl
When by his children he is called.
(These children are completely bald!)
[ 9 ]


' " v
THE BLUE-TONGUED LIZARD
The tale I tell is strange but true;
This Lizard has a tongue of blue!
His head is blunt, his limbs are short,
He’s clumsy, and quite easily caught.
[ 10 ]


THE KANGAROO
The Kangaroo is large and strong,
Two legs are short, and two are long.
To feed, he bounds away at night,
His spare time spends in friendly fight.
His mate, so wise in bushland lore,
Has nice neat pouch attached before,
In which, and this is really true,
She holds her baby kangaroo!
[ ll 1


THE CARPET SNAKE
The Carpet Snake has long, sharp teeth,
Skin gay on top, and plain beneath.
Small birds and things are food for him.
Does he fear water? See him swim!
1 12 ]


I 1
I, I’a THE KOALA
jjj The charming Koala,
Looks just like a bear,
With his quaint little face
And his thick woolly hair.
He makes three meals a day
Off the eucalypt tree,
And lives in the bush,
Where he’s happy and free.
[ 13 ]


THE RABBIT
His ears are so sweet, and his face is so bright,
So nimble his feet, and his tail tipped with white —
Now doesn’t he sound a remarkable pet?
He’s easily found, and he’s charming, and yet
Poor Mr Rabbit (whose pet name is Bunny),
Has one bad habit —it’s not at all funny—
He eats all the grass with a terrible zest,
Alack and alas, farmers call him a pest!
[ 14 ]


THE WILLIE WAGTAIL
Willie has one pleasing feature,
Hear him call, “Sweet pretty creature”;
By nature tame and very sweet,
He builds his nest cup-shaped and neat.
He’s often in your garden seen,
All black and white among the green.
[ 15 ]


THE LOVE-BIRD
The Love-Bird —pretty little thing
With graceful tail and coloured wing-
Will warble sweetly while it eats,
And as its feathered friends it greets.
[ 16 ]


THE OPOSSUM
The bright-eyed Opossum
Is fond of a lark,
He’ll jump on your roof-top
As soon as it’s dark.
He’ll grunt and he’ll chatter,
He’ll play and he’ll fight,
He’s gone in the morning—
He can’t stand the light.
L 17 ]


' THE
The Butcher has a lovely note,
A pretty wing, a graceful throat.
And yet, when smaller birds he’ll find,
He really is not very kind.
For these he’ll kill, and take away,
And eat them later in the day.
Should anyone attack his nest,
You’ll find he will defend with zest!
[ 18 ]


THE WALLABY
Far smaller than the Kangaroo,
More slender and more graceful, too;
Although she has a charming face,
Her feet take up a lot of space.
[ 19 ]


THE RABBIT-BANDICOOT
Don’t try to catch the Bandicoot —
He’ll only grunt and quickly root.
Besides, he has such long, long ears
That every little sound he hears.
[ 20 ]


THE EMU
Emus nest in open places,
Handsome forms, but silly faces.
They’ll eat green grass, grasshoppers, too!
They’ve really nothing else to do.
[ 21 ]


THE CASSOWARY
It really is not necessary
To talk about the Cassowary;
So tall and timid, proud and wary,
Its nature seems to me contrary.
1 22 ]


THE TREE GOANNA
The Tree Goanna has teeth sharp and strong,
Toes armed with claws and a tongue very long,
He climbs large trees, hanging on by his legs,
Steals almost anything —so fond of eggs!


THE MAGPIE
A very clever, useful bird,
Whose voice at break of dawn is heard.
In open country he is found,
He builds his nest far from the ground.
He’s nice, but sometimes takes to crime,
And steals bright things from time to time!
[ 24 ]


THE WOMBAT
The Wombat burrows underground,
On plain and hill and coast he’s found.
His body’s long, his tail is small,
His voice is hoarse —not nice at all.
[ 25 ]


THE PELICAN
The Pelican’s an ugly fellow
His legs are short, his beak pale yellow;
He lives near rivers, islands, lakes,
For food, the little fish he takes.
[ 26 ]


THE KOOKABURRA
The Kookaburra —laughing bird-
At sunset and at dawn is heard.
He laughs with vim, he laughs with glee,
He laughs at you, he laughs at me.
The Laughing Jackass he is named,
Of all Australia’s birds most famed.
Quite fearsome snakes he often kills,
With these, his little tummy fills.
[ 27 ]


THE JEWEL BEETLE
Far brighter than Aladdin’s treasure,
With grace and brilliance in full measure,
So small a thing, such beauty showing,
With jewelled splendour softly glowing!
[ 28 ]


THE DINGO
The Dingo is not brave or wise,
He fills the air with ugly cries.
The Dingo does not bark—he howls,
And steals the useful sheep and fowls.
Though all these helpless things he’ll take,
He flees in fear from Mr Snake!
[ 29 ]


THE ECHIDNA or PORCUPINE
The porcupine dislikes the sun —
Ant-eating is his greatest fun.
It really is not fair at all—
Echidna’s large—the ant is small.
He’s rather hard to hold because
He has sharp quills as well as claws.
L 30 ]


THE PENGUIN
The Penguin has a pleasant face,
He swims at a tremendous pace;
But don’t disturb him at his nest,
When in the water, don’t molest;
From any little girl or boy,
Such actions only will annoy.
Don’t do it, even for a lark,
For if you do, this bird will bark!
[ 31 ]


lj
THE GRASSHOPPER
When young, he’s rather like a flea,
Likes tender grass-blades for his tea.
As he grows up, he splits his skin,
And very soon is long and thin.
When wings have grown, long flights he’ll take,
And leave destruction in his wake.
[ 32 ]


THE SHARK
When swimming should a Shark you see,
Make straight for shore —go home to tea,
Leave at once , don’t waste a minute,
Better far, outside than in it!
[ 33 ]


==^—
TASMANIAN DEVIL
Tasmanian Devil cares not what he eats,
Carrion, wallaby, whatever he meets.
He 3 s not very active—he’s cunning and strong,
And after his victims he ambles along.
[ 34 ]


THE BROLGA or NATIVE COMPANION
The Brolga loves to dance and play,
He’s slimly-built, and tall and gay;
He’s quaint and friendly—but take heed!
His beak he’ll use in time of need!
[ 35 ]


THE CORAL-FISH
The Coral-fish with snout so long,
To North Australia does belong.
A useful set of teeth has he,
Would you like coral for your tea?
[ 36 ]


THE COCKCHAFER
This creature is a pest, that’s all,
On fruit and wattle-trees he’ll fall.
He just destroys whate’er he sees,
And noise! Just like a swarm of bees!
[ 37 ]


THE TREE-KANGAROO
It seems so very strange to me,
This Kangaroo lives in a tree!
He likes to fight, and jump and run,
Walks backwards sometimes, just for fun
His nature is not sweet or kind,
He has a long, long tail behind.
38 ]


THE STINGRAY
The Stingray’s very nice to eat,
But do not touch him with your feet,
Or with your hands, or anything ,
Because he has a nasty sting!
[ 39 ]


THE HUNTSMAN SPIDER
When Summer comes, she’ll creep inside,
And up above the curtains hide.
At night you’ll find her wary eye
Seek out the unsuspecting fly.
She’ll clear the house of pests, you’ll find,
Though she looks fierce, she’s really kind.
[ 40 ]


THE FROG HOPPER
Just look at him, with eyes agog!
The very image of a frog!
In colour brown, head like a snout,
Small sapling stems he climbs about.
[ 41 ]


THE SEA-HORSE
The Sea-horse has a funny face,
You’ll find him in some weedy place.
His eye is very calm and mild,
A charming pet for any child.
[ 42 ]


# y; Tv r
THE FLYING SQUIRREL
This pretty thing is sure to please,
In bark-lined nests he sleeps at ease.
Long silky hair, eyes soft and bright,
From tree to tree he glides at night.
His screech, a fearsome thing to hear,
Is only heard one month each year.
[ 43 ]


THE SEAL
Some Seals have ears and some have not,
They don’t like places where it’s hot.
They like the coast —wild, rugged, bold,
They like the water icy cold.
They like to have one nice, small pool,
(I think the water’s far too cool)
And this they keep so neat and trim,
In which to teach young Seals to swim.
Now would you rather be an eel,
Or frozen daily, as the Seal*?
[ 44 ]


THE AZURE KINGFISHER
A graceful, highly-coloured bird,
In flight his piercing call is heard.
All fish, and insects too, he likes;
These with his long, sharp beak he strikes.
[ 45 ]


THE TIGER-CAT
The Tiger-cat with spotted tail,
Large birds and wallabies will trail.
His legs are short, his speed is slow,
He is not very nice to know.
He’ll fight and snarl, and growl and squall,
His nature is not sweet at all!
[ 46 ]


THE DIAMOND SNAKE or PYTHON
By colours olive-green and yellow,
You’ll recognize this handsome fellow.
He’ll eat up mice, and rats and rabbits,
He has such very taking habits!
I 47 ]


THE HATCHET-FISH
The Hatchet-fish —a horrid sight,
Comes from the Great Australian Bight.
This fish is very seldom found,
His shape is ugly, short and round.
[ 48 ]


THE NUMBFISH
Of any little crab or fish,
The Numbfish makes a dainty dish.
Should you find one among the rocks,
Beware! He gives electric shocks.
[ 49 ]


THE SATIN BOWER-BIRD
He builds his home of sticks so small,
Takes charcoal then, and paints them all!
He lines the nest with nice dry leaves,
He builds and decorates and weaves.
Blue is his plumage—blue the flower
He plucks to decorate his bower.
This tale is true, and strange to tell,
This clever bird can dance as well!
1 50 ]


THE WATER-RAT
A cosy nest of shredded weeds,
Is all this whiskered creature needs;
And this he builds in banks or logs,
For food, he captures mussels, frogs,
Shellfish, and birds both large and small,
Fish, flesh or fowl —he likes them all.
On nice clean stone himself he seats,
And there he stays, and eats and eats!
[ 51 ]


"^e**(C&' t ~ - p -?
THE BAT
The farmer views him with alarm,
He does the fruit and crops much harm
Just like a bird, he wings his way,
He flies all night, and sleeps all day.
While on the wing, has food and drink,
And yet a stranger thing, I think,
He takes his rest hung upside down,
With feet high up above his crown!
[ 52 ]


THE DEVIL-FISH
The Devil-fish is often sought,
But he is very rarely caught.
His tail is thin, his mouth is wide,
His little victims —woe betide!
[ 53 ]


THE JABIRU or BLACK-NECKED STORK
Tall, sturdy, strong, with stately walk,
The Jabiru will seldom talk,
And when he does, an ugly note
Will come from out that handsome throat.
Aloof and proud, no man his friend,
The Jabiru will not unbend!
