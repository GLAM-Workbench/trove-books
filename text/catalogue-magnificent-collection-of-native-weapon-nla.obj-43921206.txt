INTRODUCTION.
CATALOGUE contains a list of the Articles com-
prised in a Collection of very extraordinary Curiosities
selected during a great number of years, by the late Mr. H. A.
Smith, of Batesford.
Living in a small locality, during a long period, and
unencumbered by the demands of any large mercantile or
professional engagements, Mr. Smith indulged his peculiar
antiquarian enthusiasm, and brought together chiefly from
tropical or semi-tropical lands, a choice variety of articles of
war and domestic utility, found in the hands and in the homes
and in the tribal battlefields of Aboriginals, Natives of Fiji,
New Zealand, and New Guinea.
Air, land and sea have been laid under contribution.
The collection of birds is a magnificent one, including all
the choice Australian varieties, and a large case of rare New
Guinea and New Zealand birds.
The weapons include almost every instrument of torture
used by savage tribes. Teeth of animals and human bones re-
markably arranged in the articles of murder, excite the intense
curiosity of the patient investigator
The collection includes many rare specimens of fish,
beautifully stuffed, showing eminent, skill in the taxidermist’s
art.


The collection of Coins is a truly historical assortment
coming from many mints, and dating back to bye-gone
ages, deserves the regard of all lovers of antiquarian science, as
also the stone implements recovered from the depth of Lake
Neuchatel. As a prominent department of any private or
national museum, the late Mr Smith’s collection of Coins and
Stone Implements are certainly' not the least attractive portion
of this interesting collection.
Many portions of Aboriginal Costume adorn this collection.
The beautiful woods of semi-tropical lands adjacent to our own
Colony, are worked up into designs that would create a pang
of envy in any European engraver’s mind. This collection
should be a national one. It should adorn our national
museums.
The Auctioneer desires to impress upon the authorities of
our various Colonial museums and public institutions as well
as private collectors and those persons who are desirous of
exporting to Europe, the rare chance this first and only sale
of this magnificent collection affords of procuring rare curios.
As there will be no reserve, the bidding will be open to peer or
peasant, to the National Trustee,buying for the nation for edu-
cational purposes, to the retired merchant or professional man,
or to the hard-working artisan who believes that “ a thing of
beauty is a joy for ever.”
A word of a personal character cannot be deemed out of
place, even in an introduction to a prosaic Auctioneer’s cata-
logue. The collector of the varied articles, which are assorted
and labelled in the following pages, did not die what is called a
natural death. His decease was accidental; he died in harness.
While arranging a trophy of native weapons for the Geelong
Exhibition, at the close of last year, the ladder on which he was
standing slipped, and he fell to the floor. The injuries he re-
ceived. were so serious that he soon succumbed. He died sud-
denly in the midst of his labor of love.

The Auctioneer mentions this mournful termination in the
life of this great collector partly for the purpose of explaining
the reason of the sale, of the collection, and partly for the pur-
pose of showing that the collector’s life’s work in the cause of
antiquarian science and research, has not been lost, but is at the
disposal of all who wish it. Once this opportunity of purchas-
ing is lost, the same or its like cannot possibly occur again.
Men of Mr. Smith’s type are exceptionally rare, and conse-
quently collections, the result of many years of enthusiastic re-
search and patient investigation, are also singular, and indeed
extraordinary, especially in a century, the latter portion of which
is chiefly devoted to gathering together the cash of the present,
not the historical relics of barbarian tribes.
Every lot in the catalogue is numbered, and care has been
exercised in including articles appropriate to each other in each
distinct lot. A more 'minute reference to the catalogue would
need the recourse of a small volume.
The foregoing reference is made chiefly for the purpose of
directing attention to a collection which, when sold, will serve
to smooth the declining years of the widow of the collector.
Thus, in buying even a single lot, the purchaser can con-
gratulate himself or herself on having performed a deed of
practical benevolence with the offering of a stimulus to other
persons who are engaged in the pursuit of scientific in-
vestigation.
The whole of the collection will be sold by public auction
in the Exhibition Hall, Geelong, on Wednesday, May 2nd,
1888, commencing at 12 o’clock.
Copies of the catalogue have been sent to the leading
Colonial museums, and can be had on application, from the Auc-
tioneer at the Exhibition Exchange, Moorabool Street, Geelong.
