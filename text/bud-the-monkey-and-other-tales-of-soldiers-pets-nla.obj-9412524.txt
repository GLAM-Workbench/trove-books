INTRODUCTION
Major Lin Mac Donald ransacks every whirligig and hole and
corner of his brain j spots some big nuggets which have lain embedded
there ever since the cliffs of Sari Bair (Anzac) were stormed in
A.D. 1915 and picks them out carefully with his pen. Next he des-
patches them to me by ?The First Experimental Air Mail? that ever
flew from Australia to England (don?t you wish you had those
stamps as a curio?) ?with a covering letter asking me to write him
a foreword. And now Time has stolen a march on me and it has
become 25 July.
I fear the Major will be vexed at the delay but what can a busy
General do? One week I have been marching in my kilt with our
patron in the British Legion, our blessed mascot the Prince of "Wales,
through the streets of Inverness; the next I have been marching at
the head of five hundred Scots war-widows through the astonished
towns of Ypres, Arras, Cambrai, visiting the cemeteries in Flanders
and Northern France, carrying my own kit and finding my own billet,
just the same as the youngest widow of the party. The Major,
perhaps, pictures the General as seated in an armchair blowing blue
rings of tobacco-smoke out of his mouth j rather bored, very idle
and longing for a chance to write a nice letter to all his old antipodean
comrades who are, so to say, tickling the soles of his feet by walking
on them. Only the last part of this picture is true to life, namely
from the word ?longing? to the word ?comrades.? So now for a
word to the ?young ones.?


INTRODUCTION
There are heaps of things going on in Australia which would
make Europeans, Americans, Asiatics or Africans open their eyes
pretty wide. You lucky youngsters out there, however, seeing them
every day think nothing of them. But don?t begin to take things for
granted. Be astonished at them! They really are astonishing and
it is only by being astonished that you will acquire the habit of look-
ing into them closely and thus getting a grip of them. Once you
have got that grip you will have mastered at least the A B C of
life, i.e. a good number of the details which make up its situations.
Just to show you what I mean about the oddities of Australia:
Supposing a Cockney boy from the Mile End Road and a Yankee girl
from Broadway went for a walk on an up-country station and after
looking at some sheep, dingoes, black swans, duck-billed platypuses and
other fairly familiar objects, saw, suddenly, a kangaroo (which they
had learnt from their school-books to half believe in) come hopping
over the landscape like a great grasshopper, whilst her baby peeps
out of her pocket like a rabbit out for a ride in a motor-bus. That
would give them quite a turn.
A little farther on they might incautiously enter a forest of
blue-gums waving their branches in the air and pretending to be
well-behaved, respectable trees ?when ?suddenly?out flies a flock of
white cockatoos with yellow topknots, squawking like nothing in
New York, though every other vile noise is encouraged there. Well,
what would the two young antipodeans from the Northern Hemi-
sphere do then: They?d begin to understand that there was more
in Australia than their school-marms had ?lamed? them.
But what about Australians themselves? How about their
relationsj perhaps their fathers? Are they the sort of folk that the
young lady from Broadway or the young gentleman from Piccadilly
would meet in their own homes? Not much! Those folk belong


INTRODUCTION
to the wide spaces; but iï¿½ they went to a parade any year on 25
April they?d certainly see men they?d not see anywhere else (except
those few across the Tasman Sea who live on two islands at once,
together with the Maoris; Pelorous Jack; some flocks of Canterbury
lambs and the keas which eat the lambs). They?d see the ANZACS!
There were some fine types amongst the first waves of Americans
who came across the Herring Pond: they took tea with me by the
bus-load, so I know, but they could not hold a candle to those ?railway-
sleeper getters? and ?kangaroo hunters? ?that first batch of giants
who sailed from the South to the North to take tea with the Turks.
The reason why the Anzacs became afterwards so famed as the
?Digger? was simply because he did dig in a way and with a result
that no other soldier of any army could touch. The first direct order
from their Commander-in-Chief to the Anzacs was sent at 12.5 a.m.
on 26 April 1915. This was the order sent personally by Hamilton
to Birdwood: ?You have got through the difficult business, now
you have only got to dig, dig, dig until you are safe.? So the Anzacs
became ?Diggers.?
When they went to France and were put into trenches dug by
other troops, French or British, they felt quite naked ?the trenches
did not fit them! But the chief distinction of an Anzac is that he
was the first, the biggest, and the finest of all the war exports of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand.
Who was the inspired idiot who invented the word ?Anzac?
which will go booming down the ages? I?ll tell you as well as I
can. The claimants are Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood and
General Sir lan Hamilton. The Field-Marshal was the first in the
alphabetical game, using the word in cables and telegrams before
the General ever appeared on the scene but the General was the
first to write it boldly, without apology or explanation, over and over


INTRODUCTION
again in an Official Despatch to that most terribly correct and strictly
regulation body, the War Office, thus letting the whole English-
speaking world know of the Anzacs.
Yet this does not quite explain all that the word stands for.
Anzac is the generic name for the boys who came from the youngest,
least-tried nation on earth; a nation which had reached manhood
without a Maori or Red-skin struggle j a nation which had never been
scalped like the Americans or assegaied in their laagers like the
Africans. No European Chief-of-General-Staff had taken these
innocent young people, the Aussies, very seriously into account when
he reckoned out the distribution of the forces at the disposal of the
warring nations. That is a positive fact and not a supposition. So,
when the Anzac Corps landed suddenly, like a thunderclap from a
blue sky, on the most ancient battleground in Europe, and began
to perform exploits and deeds of derring do that have never been
surpassed, the war-hardened nations of the Old World were really
struck all-of-a-heap.
Thus the Anzacs became famous and any of you young folk
who have the good luck to be a relation to an Anzac, should be grateful
to Providence. For you know you have it in your blood?you know
you have inherited it ?the quality of not running away from danger,
but going straight for it and overcoming it.
Some felt it their duty, for the sake of others, not to be Anzacs.
But now that the great war is fading back into the past they are
trying, timidly as yet but they are trying, to cheapen the heroic figure
of the Anzac. They do not think that what he did was quite worth
the pension he gets. The little band of heroes, who had arrested
the attention of the World by their devotion and dash at Gallipoli,
were after all but flash-in-the-pan adventurers. And now, sixteen


years afterwards, taking advantage of the wave of sentiment in favour
of peace and disarmament which is?Heaven be praised?sweeping
across the world, it is put about that the Diggers were fierce and
bloodthirsty fellows and the less fuss made about them the bettei.
Here is where Major Lin MacDonald J s book comes in, and
here is what has moved me to write this quite inadequate foreword.
The work has been a work of love, showing as it does the real Digger
as he became known to the British officers at the Dardanelles: ?An
adventurer right enough, but an adventurer with a heart of gold; the
softest, kindest heart any girl would like to have to keep and to
hold during the course of her natural life; the sort of heart that
responds with instant kindliness and affection to any weak, immature,
or suffering thing ?whether in the shape of bird, beast, or child.
All this side of the old A.I.F. is brought out very charmingly
in the following chapters which will portray the Digger of the Darda-
nelles days faithfully to posterity ?a side which has been left un-
touched until now by all the lurid descriptions of his conduct amidst
the bayonets and shells of the battlefields.
The illustrator also seems to belong to that far-famed and highly
successful clan, the Mac Donalds. Lin Mac Donald tells me that
Angus is ?no relation,? but that is absurd. All Mac Donalds are
relations from the Lord of the Isles, right down to the humblest
clansman. Every one of them who is worth his salt, worships at the
shrine of Flora Mac Donald. So there! And Angus Mac Donald is
very happy and true in his work: the face of the little monkey (I
refer, of course, to only one of the pictures) as he is being pulled
up in a basket on to the deck of the trooper, is especially a master-
piece of artistry in expression.
In conclusion, I am sure this book is bound to have some luck

THE PURCHASE
we first saw him, in December,
he was a terrified little heap on
WHEN
1914,
the bottom of a rowing-boat ?one of
those dirty, flat things in which the natives come
out to meet every ship which reaches an
Eastern port. Two Arabs in this
boat were trying to sell the troops
of the First Australian Division a
collection of beads, curios, and very
doubtful looking sweets. One of
the soldiers shouted: ?What about
the monk?? and so the poor wee
thing was jerked aloft by a glee-
ful nigger, and a price put on his
head.
In a moment the soldiers were
having a long-distance haggle with
the Arabs from the height of the
liner?s deck. Then came the fam-
iliar cry: ?Put money in basket!? and up came the
reed bag on the


string that had been heaved aboard. The second trip of the basket
brought the frightened monkey, and so he passed into the hands of
his new masters, and began a life of adventure.
When it was found that the latest purchase was short of one
eye, and had a broken tail, the troops considered that they had been
robbed, and the roar that went up scared the Arabs in the boat. But
the tiny creature, who had lost all fear in the big, gentle hands of
the Diggers, did not seem to notice it.
The hurried departure of the niggers stopped all argument, and
attention was turned to the new pet, who, monkey-like, was taking
a tremendous interest in his new surroundings, his one bright little
eye shifting like lightning to take in the details and any movements
of the men. His funny, small black hands were clasping and un-
clasping like those of a little boy who has been suddenly left amongst
strange people. Of course, the soldiers were not at all sure of this
new arrival, for few Australians have ever owned a monkey, so they
were careful not to annoy the little chap, who was then and there
christened Bud.
You want to know what Bud was like? Well, he had a light-grey
coat, was about the size of a rabbit, had a queer little old-man face,
jj an d one beady, bright, reddish-shaded eye that
H was nearly black, except when he became fright-
'll \ I ened?and then there were sparks in it! Neat,
, sharp ears and a coal-black nose fitted his well-
shaped head, while a complete half-ring of
grey-white whiskers, about an inch and a half
long, framed his face and set off his little mouth
\ with its rows of needle-sharp teeth.
He had very long, skinny hind-legs, and
a long tail with the kink near the end that had made his new masters
so angry.


But his funny, busy little hands at the ends of wisps of arms
were the most fascinating things about him. Rarely still, they could
do most surprising jobs, and the feats of strength that they performed
sometimes made you gasp. The palms were just
the size of two-shilling pieces, and the fingers and
thumbs were in proportion, the little fingers being
just the thickness of a large wooden match. They
were both perfect, with strong, nicely-shaped
nails, which Mr Bud knew how to use to the best
effect. Ido not think anything was ever blacker
than those restless hands with their miniature
wrinkles and lines.
I knew Bud from the time he ?came on the
strength? ?the soldiers? way of saying he joined
the regiment ?until the middle of 1918, by which
time he had grown into a fine chap, not much bigger, but having an
all-white ring of fur round his face, good strong limbs, and a healthy
body. Although sometimes very mischievous and naughty, Bud was
always a little gentleman, and the nicest pet imaginable. He was
taught in a hard school, for the big Diggers with whom he lived
had heavy hands, and did not have any hesitation in using them.
However, he could not have found a better home, for he wanted for
nothing and nearly everyone was his pal.
All the monkeys that the troops brought to Europe faded out
except Bud. How he managed to live through the frost and snow,
1 shall tell you later.
Bud had a rival in the same Brigade ?a big, brown fellow called
Bill?who became very savage as he got older. On several occasions
he gave Bud a good hiding before friends could rescue him, but Bud


n
Ww
got even with him when the big chap had to be chained up. He used
to sneak down and pull Bill?s food-dish just out of his reach \s'
when that gentleman?s attention was attracted
elsewhere. Then he would sit and watch
Bill rave, only saying a bit now and
again to start the big fellow off if
he showed signs of slowing up.
But Bill nearly killed him one day;
he planted a big stone near his box, and, being ready for his tormentor,
landed a stinging shot on his ribs.
HOW BUD BEAT THE FRENCH WINTER
While the Australians were on the Gallipoli Peninsula, Bud lived
with the Transport in Egypt, and enjoyed real ?monkey? weather ?
all sunshine and warmth. But when the boys reached Europe the
grey days and coldness of Northern France and Belgium soon damped
the spirits of Bill, Bud & Co. Some of them died almost straight
away. Our nice little chap had the best time, for his friends the
saddler and the wheeler-sergeant fixed him up a kennel, with a warm
fur rug, and fitted it with a little door that he could close from inside.
Bud spent one whole day opening and shutting that door, and playing
hide-and-seek with himself.


When we got him, the saddler, with whom he lived, made him
a padded belt, with a neat fastening, to which his chain was fixed.
This belt had to be enlarged as he grew, and watched very carefully,
for a monkey?s skin is thin and tender, and the least roughness or
tightness will make him red-raw. Many
a quiet hour Bud spent in trying to learn
the trick of that belt-fastening, but, as it
was closed by the chain itself, he never
got the hang of its working. Although
he enjoyed a lot of liberty, as a general
rule, he had to be kept fastened up, so
that the chain was Bud?s biggest trouble.
When he got thoroughly annoyed with
things, he vented his temper on it,
shaking or biting it, and banging it with
a stick or stone. If he managed to get the end free from the box
(a rare occurrence), the clever way he could travel with the chain was
worth watching. Running upright like a man, he would carry hand-
fuls of chain until he had to climb. Then he would spring and let
the weight go at the end of the jump. As soon as he was safely
perched, up would come the slack, and he was ready to fly off some-
where else.
It soon got too cold for him, even in the warmth of his kennel
in the saddler?s dugout, so Bud put on his considering-cap for a day
or so, and just sat at his door and shivered. Then he came to light
with one of the cleverest schemes that animal ever planned. What
is more, he carried it out successfully.
Round the horse-lines a brown-and-white mongrel puppy was
wandering. He was just past the wobbly age ?you know the sort of


dog. Bud decided that the problem of the winter cold was solved, so
he whirled out and collected the pup.
After carefully cleaning his prize, Bud put him in the nice
warm kennel, and chat-
tered cheerfully to him
from the doorway. The
pup strongly objected to
the cleaning process, but
Bud, who was a stickler
for hygiene, calmly cuffed
him into submission, just
as you or I would have
done.
Bud?s next worry
was to keep his prisoner at home, and, with infinite
patience for such a flighty gentleman, he at last managed to impress
on his new ?hot-water bottle? that it was much healthier for him
to stay inside while his boss went out to work. The poor youngster?s
ears were raw and bleeding from bites, and his head must have been
ringing from the smacks of those little black hands, before he
thoroughly understood.
Satisfied at last that all would be well at home, off went Bud
to the cookhouse, and collected bones and meat for his new-found
pal. From then onwards until the warm weather arrived, the monkey
and the mongrel were never far apart, and proved a constant source
of fun for the soldiers. Bud foraged for the pup, and generally had
enough sense to bring him bones, but sometimes he would get him
food that he enjoyed himself ?oranges, for instance ?and make the
dog eat them. To see the diminutive monkey taking his charge for a
walk, or turning him over and over, and end for end, to clean and


brush the mud off him before letting him enter the kennel, was
screamingly funny.
The pup, now nice and round and fat, was christened ?The
Blimp,? after a little British airship which had a gas-bag just about
his shape. He quickly discovered that if he behaved himself he
would be fed and cared for by his i mnrrnTv A ?

boys had to interfere very severely
one day when, attracted by The h
Blimp?s screams, they found Bud
trying to push the pup?s eyes in, just

found out the only way to hold a dog so that you may safely do
anything to it, but both The Blimp and I know that Bud did find it,
but I am not going to tell you the way, because you might go and
try it, and some poor dog get hurt.
That was how
clever little Bud got
safely through a win-
ter that killed all the
other pet monkeys.
Thereafter, the first
frost sent him seeking
ia nice, small, fat pup
for the cold weather.
Once he made a fearful mistake in selecting a pup that grew too
quickly and nearly crowded him out of the kennel. The boys made


him a bigger box when they saw his difficulty, but when the days got
warmer he sent the overgrown lodger about his business and went
back to his old house with the door.
Bud?s old enemy, Bill, got a bad cold on his chest shortly after
we got to France, and he seemed likely to die. Under the direction
of the doctor, his owners put hot linseed poultices on him, and he was
so sick that he let them lie without a murmur. But when he felt better,
and began to take an interest in life again, he ate the last of his packs,
and seemed to relish the sticky mash.
Of course, it was really good for a sick monkey, and in future
all his medicine was given to him in that way. For weeks after he
was better, Bill would cry and hold a piece of rag or sacking to his
chest, to try and get them to give him some more poultice mixture.
By the end of that winter poor Bill was dead, but, as I told you,
he was rather a savage, nasty old chap, and not a bit like our Bud,
who was looked after so carefully by all the soldiers because they
liked him. Nobody likes nastiness, either in a person or an animal!
FROST-BITE
Little Bud the monkey did not get off scot-free from the winter cold,
although he did not have any dangerous sickness. Do you remember
I told you that he had a kink in his tail caused by an injury? Probably
this old hurt made it hard for his blood to get right down to the tip,
and blood must be able to get freely everywhere to keep men and
animals warm. When your toes are cold you stamp your feet to make
the foot muscles call for some extra blood to do the work, and thus
your toes become warm again.


Bud?s tail-tip was short of blood, and the frost found it out and
bit it, causing the end to rot away and become terribly sore.
Bud only knew the monkey way to deal with a tail like that,
and so he did what all his grandfathers, and their grandfathers, would
have done ?he chewed the sore end off to stop it spreading. You
see, in the monkeys? home climate that end would have healed nicely,
because Bud would have licked it clean regularly with a healthy pink
tongue, and his flesh would have grown
quickly.
But in France every thing was different,
and though we dressed the tip and tied it up
in all sorts of bandages Bud simply tore them
off to look underneath them. He tried and
tried not to do it, for he knew we should be
angry, but his curiosity overcame him when
our backs were turned, and off they came.
Of course, the wound never properly healed, and when summer
came the already battered Bud had only about seven inches of tail left.
Something had to be done to save that seven inches in the next
winter, for, it the frost got it again it w r as likely to prove the end of
Bud in more ways than one, because you see the poison would pro-
bably get into his spine and kill him. His friend the saddler came
to Bud?s aid again, and made him a stout leather case to cover that
seven inches of stump. The case fastened to the leather belt, and even
Bud?s nimble fingers and sharp teeth could not shift it.
Future winters did not steal any more of his tail.
I think it must have been the annoyance of not being able to get
through that tail-case that started Bud off on a private war against the
leather head-linings of the Diggers? hats. He would quickly remove
the leathers of any Australian hats he could lay hands on for a few


lOlSs^
moments, but, fortunately, it was awkward for the little monkey to
handle the big felts. He tried putting them on his head and holding
At times like those he would come
to me if I happened to be at the lines.
Bud never favoured me unless he
wanted help or protection, for
which I was verv thankful when
j
I heard of his pranks elsewhere.
I always knew he had been up to
some mischief when he arrived in
a hurry on my shoulder, crooning
softly and patting my cheek gently,
as if there was nothing the matter.
In the meantime, as if by accident,
his hind-feet would be working
them in place with both hands while run-
ning away on his hind-legs like a man, but
the deep crown made it hard for him to
see, and his slow pace on two legs made
him an easy capture.
Dragging them was hard work, and
jumping with them worse, yet all the
same, many an angry Digger spent finger-
pricking moments sewing in a hat leather,
while the culprit peeped at him from the
roof of a hut, terrified at the beating
coming to him if he was caught too soon,
and knowing all the time that if he stayed
?in smoke? for a while his misdeed would
be forgotten.
away at the buttons of my shirt-front. The big idea was that on the


approach of his victim he would dive inside my shirt and lie close
against my ribs, still as a mouse. When the danger passed, two little
black hands would push aside the opening, and his quaint, one-eyed
face would come cautiously out, always looking up at me first to see
if I was angry. But you could not be angry for long with a funny
little thing like that.
If he could not get into the shirt he would clasp me very tightly
round the neck with both arms, with his head tucked in under my
ear. From this sanctuary he
would proceed to make faces
and to chatter bravely at the
wronged one.
BUD AND THE DOCTOR
If you really upset young Bud
you had an enemy whom you
found hard to dodge in camp.
Bud was not vicious, but, true
to his breed, he would often
see just how much you would
stand. Give him a tanning
and he would cry and some-
times scream at you in temper,
but he bore no malice when
he knew he deserved the
/
hiding.
One day a new doctor came to us from Australia, and walked
down the lines. He was very new 5 even his leggings still had a beauti-


ful, mirror-like shine on them, and Bud, who was loose and spinning
round the huts, ambled up and touched the bright surface with an
inquisitive paw. The doctor felt the touch, and, looking down,
jumped hastily aside, at the same time giving Bud a cut with his cane.
The little chap was shocked, for he could not see that he had done
any wrong, and did not understand the fright he had given our new
medical man. For a second he held the sore spot, and then, with a
yell of rage, he flew at the astonished doctor, only to get two more
cuts with the cane. From that time on these two were foes, and in
the end Bud, small as he was, won the duel.
First of all, he got into the doctor?s hut one morning when that
officer was on parade, and turned out every bag and box that he could
get open. Unfortunately for Bud, he did not know the first thing
about safety-razors, but he managed to open
the nice shiny box and played with the con-
tents. The result was that a weeping monkey
hopped on to my bunk, where I was writing
letters, and showed me a very nasty cut on
a diminutive little-finger. I sympathized
and applied iodine, receiving a nip and an
instant apology for my trouble. However,
1 cleaned and securely tied up the small hand,
and away went Bud to fresh mischief, quite
happy. In about ten minutes-he was back
again all over blood, for curiosity had once more beaten him, and off
had come the bandages. You should have seen his face when we
closed that wound with heat to stop any chance of blood-poisoning.
Some of you will wonder why we did not use that sticky tape
to tie up his wound. Well, we did once, and he ate the tape! It
must have stuck all his internal workings together!


A
His next attempt to get even with the doctor was more successful
from Bud?s point of view. When the Army Medical people take
the field with the troops they carry as few liquids as possible, in case
of breakage. Every drug that can be compressed into pills or carried
as a powder is brought along in little screw-top bottles, or in small
boxes. In the big travelling panniers, or baskets, of the Regimental
Aid Posts are hundreds of these small packages, but, of course, castor
oil, ointments, etc., have to be carried in the form that is familiar
to us.
Because our doctor was very, very new, he had these baskets
put on boxes in a tent, and opened so that
their metal-lined lids, supported by their
chains, formed shelves, while the many
bottles and boxes were all on view in
their compartments behind.
It was usual only to open the
baskets when they were required for
dressings or sick parades, and the ever-searching Bud, snooping round
to catch a glimpse of this enemy-man, spotted the tent and the open


Yards of white bandages led to the discovery of Bud in a nearby tree.


baskets. The sight was a novelty, and, besides, they belonged to the
doctor.
It was a wonderful opportunity that no real monkey could pos-
sibly resist, and that young scamp made full use of his chance in the
unguarded tent. He emptied the pills out on the lids, and made
mudpies with boracic acid and picric powder?that yellow stuff they
use for burns ?all nicely moistened with oils, vaseline, and cough-
mixture out of the bottles.
Then he tackled the bandages, and played cat?s-cradles with him-
self for a while. That was easy, for he really had four hands and a
tail to do the twisting. Those bandages gave him away, because some-
one saw yards of white stuff apparently going mad in a tree, and
Bud was discovered, stained yellow and brown, with a long finger-
bandage trailing from each hand. The doctor admitted Bud had won,
but had he caught him just then that small monkey?s military career
would have come to a sticky end!
I must tell you why Bud did not like horses. One day he
wandered up to the old mare that pulled the water-cart, and, as she
was curious about this new sort of dog, down went her head to sniff it.
Bud was equally interested in the notice she was taking of him,
especially as his sharp eye spotted the red lining of the old mare?s
nostril. Quick as a thought a small hand flew up, and the snort the
old lady gave blew that monkey many feet. Bud went up a tree until
after dark.
When the troops were on the march, Bud always travelled on
the top of the tarpaulin covering the load of a G.S. wagon. His
chain was of sufficient length to let him get down to the side-boards
of the wagon, but not long enough to let him touch the wheels in
case he fell. He could also reach the driver, and loved to sit on his
lap and hold the reins to feel the horses pull.


On the column reaching a village or town, Bud?s real work
commenced. It was the only regular job he did to earn his tucker,
and very seriously he regarded it. All the kiddies would come out
of the houses and schools to see the soldiers pass, and Bud would
perform circus tricks for them on the top of the wagon-load as it moved
down the street. He would jump into the air and come down on
all fours, turn somersaults, walk up and down on his hind-legs, and
dance and chatter for them. Now and then he would slide down his
chain to the end and hold out his hand for anything the children
might have to give him. Owing to the narrow streets and turnings
in a village, short halts often occurred, and these gave the children
and the monkey a chance to get together.
Woe betide any boy who got too close to Bud with a cap on his
head, for that cap would go to the top of the wagon. There you
would see his lordship the monkey trying it on back to front, inside
out, and every other possible way, until he would finally throw it
away in disgust when one of the soldiers made a move to go up and
take it from him.
Then the weeping little French boy, who had been running along
with the wagon, would grab his casquette and race back to his mates,
quite a hero for having had his cap stolen by the 'petit singe.

ONE morning in the wagon-lines, after ten days in the front
area, I heard a plaintive bleat from somewhere outside. In
answer to a question, one of the boys said quite casually, ?Oh,
that?s our lamb.? He offered no further information, and I never
could find out just how
that lamb arrived or
became ?ours.?
After breakfast I
found the new pet, and
burst out laughing?as
everyone else did when
they first sighted
Tommy. He had been
christened, I?m afraid,
after our adjutant. He
was a little, fluffy, soft
thing, about twelve
inches long, and quite black except for a patch in front that was at


the moment creamy-grey from a mixture of mud and milk. He was
busy at a baby?s feeding-bottle, and his volunteer nurse was the
farrier-sergeant. At home this chap was a blacksmith in the railways,
and he was certainly the last person imaginable to take on such a job
as hand-feeding a Jamb.
Two weeks later Tommy was sprinting about everywhere. With
his shiny black, woolly coat, clean white shirt-front extending from
his chin to just between his front-legs, two white socks on his sturdy
pins, and a bravely held head with a tawny muzzle, he was a hand-
some gentleman, and a credit to his nurse. Already he was butting
any fist shown to him, and like all the animals that grew up in direct
contact with the boys, he had no fear of anyone or anything.
A doctor, who was a bit of a hard case himself, saw Tommy
sucking away at his bottle, and remarked: ?Have you got a ?dummy?
? , A Wag ï¿½ f a dnver P rom P tl y wrote to some innocent aunt
in England: ?We have
a little lamb with us.
I wonder if you would
get me a comforter for
it??
The ?dummy?
duly arrived, blue rib-
bon and all complete,
and Tommy gam-
bolled about, to the
delight of visitors,
with a baby?s comfort-
er hung on his chest
by a blue ribbon.
By the time we moved out for a spell, Tommy marched with the


rear party, at the end of a big dog-chain. He was as big as an Aire-
dale, and full of life, for the growth of grass round the camp had been
wonderful. The black mascot, with the cheeky lift of the thorough-
bred about his head, created a lot of interest on the road and at halts.
Of course, the boys had taught him tricks, and he had learned whom he
might with impunity butt and whom he might not, and just how hard
he would be allowed to bump. It was no good trying to hit him,
because his tremendous coat of close-curled wool made any knock
harmless, so to punish him they switched his clean legs with a light
cane.
Tommy was groomed regularly and his hooves were kept pol-
ished, as were his horns when they commenced to grow. On long
marches he would often ride on the footboard of a wagon, curling
up comfortably for miles.
One morning, when we were waiting to go into the line, the
veterinary officer dropped in for breakfast. Tommy came into the
group, in his usual cheeky way, to get his special bit of bread and
jam. There was always a certain ritual to go through before he got
it. First of all he stamped three times, but no one took any notice.
Then he butted you gently on the leg and stamped again. After
that, he waited for room to be made for him to put his forefeet on
the seat.
When he was in that position he seemed to be a terribly big
chap, and the vet., looking at him professionally, said: ?That fellow
is making a big mistake ?he is getting too fat?
There was a chorus of ?No fear; he is in splendid condition,?
to which the vet. replied: ?So a lot of people think. You will lose
him if you don?t look out. But, if you take my advice, you?ll eat him.?
Our own boys had become much too attached to Tommy to have
any idea of making a dinner off him, but there were plenty of folk

about with no such scruples, and our chaps guarded that black sheep
jealously.
They were teased unmercifully, especially by a Pioneer Battalion
which had been in rest near us when Tommy was very much younger.
These fellows often threatened to ?souvenir? Tommy, and his owners
dared them to try. Attempts were made, and several skirmishes took
place, but they were doomed to failure from the first.
The veterinary officer?s words made us all think. The guard
was redoubled, for Tommy had become a mascot, and his black-and-
white effect was so uncommon that it attracted a lot of attention, which
was very pleasing to his owners. The white wool shirt-front was
blued regularly to keep the colour ?a trick suggested by a village
mademoiselle.
Next time we went out to rest, the Pioneers, passing our bivouac
on the road early one morning, greeted the boys with ?Baa! Baa!
Baa!? which started much chaff and good fun as the one column
marched along. A group of their officers twitted ours, saying: ?You
won?t forget to ask us to dinner when you kill him, will your?
When the laughing and joking had finished, and the Battalion
was well away, someone discovered that Tommy had vanished from
the grass patch behind the camp where he had been tethered! Furious
men asked leave to chase the Pioneers, but wiser counsels prevailed,
for Tommy had obviously not been taken by the column on the road.
Some more subtle scheme had to be thought out, and when we started,
about an hour afterwards, a mounted party was sent ahead to ride
round the marching Pioneers and keep them under observation. That
day and the next they were watched constantly by the scouts, but not
a trace of Tommy could be found. After that, the search had to be
abandoned, as we went off in quite another direction. Tommy?s days
as a mascot had come to an end, and he was ?struck off the strength.?


A little while later a packet arrived by post for one of the
officers, who had a pal in the Pioneer Battalion. When unwrapped
it was found to
be one of those
little cardboard
boxes with silver
edges, in which
you send away
little pieces of
wedding-cake. It
had evidently
originally been
sent from Aus-
tralia to the Pio-
neer chap whose
address was on the box. Inside was a lump of black, curly wool tied
with a bit of white wool. On the lid was just ?Baa! Baa! )}
During the joking and chaffing with the passing troops, the
advance billeting party of the Pioneers had successfully ?souvenired?
Tommy from the rear of our camp and ridden off direct to the rest
area, where a feast was prepared. After that we got ?Baa! Baa!?
from everyone in the joke.

TAKING a short cut through a meadow in Northern France
one bright spring day, I came across a lonely foilu y or French
Soldier of the Line. The word means ?Hairy One? in French
slang. When they are campaigning they generally let their whiskers
grow, so that the name is apt. The poor French soldiers drew very
little pay and the term is really one of affection.
Watching my 'poilu for a few moments, I thought what a pitiful
sight he was. A fine big chap, dressed in the regulation rough brown
pants and the badly cut blue coat, with the soldiers? kep on the back of
his head, and a big pipe in his mouth, he was evidently a shell-shock
case, for he was making funny noises and casting a piece of string, tied
to a long stick, into a pond near some willows. As I drew nearer I
could see he was making quite a business of it, and yet his cheery
?B'jour m?sieur? did not seem at all mad, and I became interested.
Thus was I introduced to the noble art of frog-fishing, for that
was what the French soldier was doing with his stick and string and
funny noises. Having seen several of the lively little chaps brought
ashore and put in a bag with a draw-string at the top, at the foilu?s
invitation I tried my luck, and found it rather sport, although I lost
my first frog and drew a perfect hail of unintelligible French on my
shamed head.


This is the way to catch frogs in the French style?try it in a
waterhole and see what fun you can get out of it:?
Take a long, light stick ?or, better still, a fishing-rod?and use
a piece of line about twelve to fifteen feet in length, with a three-
inch square of red cloth tied on the end. Red bunting?the stuff
from which flags are made?is the best, for it floats well. Then you
want a fine-meshed landing-net about the size and shape of a butterfly-
net, on a fairly long handle. The rest of the gear you provide your-
self, but you have to practise hard to get it working properly. Fill
one cheek with air, and then expel it, opening your lips by tightening
your cheek muscles, but without opening your teeth. This makes
the ?frog noise? j it is quite easy ?the 'poilus do it and smoke a pipe
at the same time!
When you find a suitable pond, stand on the side farthest from
the sun, so as not to throw a shadow on the water. Sink the landing-
net in the pond near the bank with the handle close enough for you
to grab easily. Be sure the net is not too deep, and right side up, for
friend frog is remarkably quick in the water, and everything must
be ready to pick him up.
Now make a cast with the red rag well out into the pond, at the
same time starting the frog noises. If you notice a little bubble, and
then a ring that grows bigger and bigger, you have interested a frog.
Here?s where you have to be very cautious, for the game is to get the
slippery fellow to chase that red spot until you have him over the
landing-net, and can bag him. Remember that all this must be done
very quietly if you want to catch more than one frog, for they are
terribly shy, and?as you can gather from the fact that with a small
noise from the bank you can make them rise?they have a peculiar
faculty for hearing under water. Any loud talking or breaking of
branches, and you will go home empty-handed.


Solemnly watching the little red rag as he makes ?frog-noises.?


There are lots of things to learn in this sport, and these you
will pick up as you go along. For instance, if two frogs rise at the
bait, remember to keep your eye on one only, or you will lose
them both.
When the French soldiers catch enough frogs for a dish, the hind-
legs are removed, and either boiled in milk or fried in butter, and
then eaten with pepper and salt, just as we eat oysters or prawns.
The edible frog is the fat green chap, sometimes found with
brown spots on his back. Flis well-developed hind-legs are covered
with fine, white flesh rather like very tender chicken. It is a tasty
dish, much enjoyed by French people, and the soldiers on leave at
the right season spent a lot of their time frog-fishing, although it is
hard work to catch a dishful.
I wonder what those rough peasant soldiers would say to a shower
of frogs? In 1928 I saw it rain frogs for a minute or two on the
coast near Maryborough in Queensland. The result was simply
indescribable, for the little beggars ranged from the size of a bee?s
knee to chaps having bodies three-quarters of an inch long, and they
crawled everywhere in the houses. They climbed the stairs step by
step, and when they had finished hunting for flies and cockroaches,
of which latter there are countless thousands in that part of the world,
they just came down again and went outside.
The scientific explanation of such a shower is that a big whirlwind
out on the western plains had sucked up a shallow lagoon and given
the frogs an aeroplane trip over the mountains to the coast. This is
borne out by the aboriginals, who state that the old people have told
them that it was a much more common occurrence in their young days.
But what has this got to do with the soldiers? pets? Well, the
Diggers once started a frog farm, and tried to fatten a pen for a
big dish. They belonged to an Australian battery, whose guns were in
an area surrounded with ponds. Seeing the poilus industriously fishing


for frogs for their supper, the Diggers decided to collect some of the
noisy little chaps and try this strange meal out properly. In view
of the length of time that must elapse before a meal for twenty-five
hungry gunners could be caught, they gathered up a close-meshed
wire chicken-coop, with a bottom of stout wood and a small trap-door
on the top. This they sank up to the opening in a nearby pond, and
each fisherman as he came home emptied his catch, all alive-oh, into
the frog farm.
None of the Diggers knew exactly what a frog lived on, so these
poor creatures were fed on everything that came handy, just in case
some of it might appeal to froggish appetites.
Catching the elusive frog in quantities soon palls, especially if
you divide the total day?s catch by twenty for dinner. Before they
could get enough, the gunners were relieved by another unit. The
newcomers were promptly initiated into the mysteries of frog-farm-
ing, and the Diggers said that, to save possible loss of the stock on
the road, they would sell the whole outfit cheap for a few pounds
of sugar. The deal was completed, and as a parting gift they left the
incoming unit all their rods with red rags complete.
On the following Sunday the whole battery had a really good
boiled pudding, thanks to the extra sugar supply. The Diggers thought
frog-farming was worth while, after all.


A NANNY HEROINE
WE were up in a place where milk was unprocurable, when some-
one suggested getting a goat, which we could keep until the
time came for a long trek, and, as the idea seemed sound,
we agreed to throw in a few francs each, and start a dairy. The
Padre, as the best French scholar, was detailed to take the cooks? cart,
and not to return until he had found a nanny-goat.
Next evening, back he came triumphant, with his passenger and
a receipt signed by the French Mission?the folk who acted as
go-betweens in all transactions where the British Army and the French
civilians were concerned. This receipt was necessary, because, when
they wanted anything, some people connected with the army were not
quite as honest as they ï¿½
might have been, and, 1/ / 'i/
unless you could show
your right and title to
whatever you owned,
some inquisitive person
might get you into
trouble by saying you
had been round ?sou-
veniring.?
No animal ever
got amongst the Dig-
gers without becoming
a pet, and Nanny was no exception. She had the run of the wagon


lines, and, after an argument or two with the stable picket, learned to
leave the feed-heaps alone. The flats by the disused railway were
knee-deep in grass, and, with pickings round the men?s huts, such as
drying shirts and socks, Nanny fared very well. Puttees were her
long suit, and often an irate digger had to cut a foot or so off his leg
coverings after an attack by this out-size in moths.
Travelling along with the transport, our milk-supply covered
quite a lot of France, and seemed to enjoy her life as a soldier.
One morning the faithful goat was found with a quaint little
kid shyly peeping at a strange world. The placid Nanny had become
a valiant protector of the weak overnight, as one of the cooks found
out when he tried to handle the youngster. He was bowled over
in a most undignified manner,
and Nanny?s knees were in his
chest in an instant.
The young fellow had a
great time for a few weeks
and bid fair to be quite spoiled.
He was a funny little thing,
and could do the most wonder-
nhuful twists in the air when he
iHlimuiidiMllt had a jumping fit.
wllllfiifii////hi(lioiWi(i fed* You have heard that
goats are sure-footed. Well,
that kid ?Teddy for short ?would make a rush at a stack of bales
of hay, and, going almost straight up, finish with a step-dance, and
then gaze round with his ears twitching in opposite directions like a
mule?s. A whistle from the boys, and he would rush at full speed
all over the heap, and then off again to his mother.


But there came a sudden order to move, and the carriage of
Nanny and Teddy gave us a problem. It was solved by tying their
legs, and putting them on top of the water-cart on some bags, where
they made a good trip. A snooping General, who, without warning,
inspected the column on the road, nearly found out the family, but
a quick-witted driver threw a big greatcoat over them, and beyond a
growl about coats being carried in the wrong places nothing was said.
In our new position, at an old French farm-house, many of the
buildings were habitable, and a warm corner in a stable was given to
the goats. Rather a big place for the neighbourhood, it was nicely
situated near a creek lined with well-trimmed willows. On a bright
autumn morning the air was so clear that sounds carried for long
distances. You could hear trains puffing away up the hill near the
railhead, and planes going over to Fritz?s lines to have a ?look-see?
while the low sun gave them plenty of shadows for their photographs.
And then came a rushing sound that got quickly louder, a sound that
was all too familiar, followed by a series of terrific explosions. The
enemy had got right on to the old farm with several guns, and for
the next ten minutes everything was noise, dust, smoke, and falling
bricks and timber.
When the shelling ceased, and a quick counting of heads showed
that nobody was hurt, the boys went to the buildings to see how the
goats fared.
The stable had been badly hit. Pulling aside the wreckage of
the roof they found old Nanny with a piece of shell in her side. She
was quite dead, but right underneath her was Teddy, protected by
her body, nearly silly with fright, but unharmed. The careful mother
had evidently forced him into the corner and covered him as best
she could when the shelling started.
The soldiers showed their appreciation of her bravery by giving

her a decent burial and erecting a wooden slab over her grave, with
these words on it: To a Nanny Heroine.
And the kid Teddy? Of course, he was well cared for. Next
time we were out of the line he was handed over to some little French
girls in a farm where the boys were billeted.

PONY
EARLY HISTORY
HE started life as a racing pony at Richmond, a suburb of
Melbourne, and was purchased by the Army Remount Depart-
ment for a trumpeter?s pony. Thus he became a soldier.
Leaving for the war with the first troops, he stood the long voyage
to Egypt so well that he immediately got his land-legs in the desert.
A beautiful pony even among that wonderful collection of
horses, Mickey had a good life, and, by hard, willing work, earned
his place in his unit. In the four years we soldiered together, with
only short breaks, I never knew Mickey to be tired or sick. Even
though he had just been tied up after a long trip, he would come
straight off the horse-lines, leaving the remainder of his feed, if


necessary, and without a grumble. (Oh, yes, horses do grumble ; they
can show their annoyance just like human beings.)
Mickey was a bright bay, with black points, and he had a small
white star right in the centre of his forehead. His tail and forelock
were fine and always glossy, while his coat was silky and came away
naturally without clipping. Small, well-shaped, hard feet ?an in-
valuable asset in the mud of Flanders ?finished his neat, clean legs.
They were legs that never seemed to suffer from the pave roads. At
the end of the war they seemed as perfect as they had been in his
racing days, in spite of a hard life amid such traps as barbed wire and
hidden timber in water-filled shell-holes.
Always in good condition, even when all the animals were suffer-
ing from short rations and lack of green stuff, Mickey was not a big
eater, but he was very fussy about his drinking-water. If you did not
watch him carefully he would go into the creek saddle and all, rather
than drink with the other horses at the muddy edge.
As a hack, Mickey was very comfortable. He could walk his
five miles an hour for long stretches, but his real gait was an easy
canter, with which he would keep up an even pace for hours. His
well-made shoulders and properly seated back saved him from any
trouble with saddle-galls, which are painful things for any horse that
has to be ridden constantly. Although turning the scale at over twelve
stone, I have travelled thirty-five or forty miles on him without any
apparent effect on the stout little chap; in fact, he would always finish
a long trip by pig-rooting the last hundred yards into camp.
This pig-rooting was Mickey?s big joke, and it used to frighten
people rather badly, for, until you learned the trick, Mickey always
won and the rider bit the dust. If you took no notice of the first
root, but took care to get the balance of his action, he would keep up
the stunt for quite a long distance. It was most spectacular and so

easy that you felt as though you were on a rocking-horse. But, if you
tried to check the first root, or to ride all over his back, he would
put a new action across at once, and start to buck, never doing the
same thing twice, until you were off.
Then ?good-bye, Mickey, and you walked back to the horse-
lines!
He was a fine pet, and knew no end of tricks, which he was
always delighted to perform for an audience of visitors. For instance,
if you lifted one of his forefeet and put it on the palm of your hand,
he would make use of the leverage and stand straight up on his
hind-legs. Then he would circle round as you turned, swishing his
long tail like a fan.
We had vicious horses, clever horses, and ?just? horses, but
Mickey was in a class by himself. He was able to think, and you
never knew what he would be up to next. Though he hated to be
tied up, he was as quiet as a lamb on the horse-lines when we were
fighting, but when we were resting he fretted and fumed until he
was let off to run free. Then he would inspect the whole place,
returning to his position on the lines in time to go to water and get
his nosebag with the other horses. He never stole from the feed-
heap, and if you wanted him you had only to give his whistle and he
would come galloping up.
Mickey was never any trouble to groom. In fact, he liked it,
but the officers? grooms always had to chase him away when they were
grooming the chargers, because the young beggar, roaming round quite
innocently, would disappear with body-brushes or rubbers. He would
take them in his teeth and drop them behind some shed just for fun,
where, very often, they were never found ?at least, not by the right-
ful owners.
On the way from Egypt to Gallipoli many of the horses were
put on boats that were not properly equipped, because the trip was to


be of such short duration, though, as it turned out, it occupied many
weeks. Mickey was on a boat having head-ropes instead of chains for
attaching to the ship?s head-collars. One day, while the stable picket
was having an unauthorized game of cards, Mickey got bored, and
undid his ropes. Then, somehow, by twisting himself up, he got out
of his narrow r stall and proceeded forward to see some of his mates.
When the boys at last discovered him he had unfastened three other
horses, but, of course, not being pony-built, they could not get under
the breast-bars, and Mickey had not learned to pull the iron fastening-
pins out of the sockets. Back in his stall went the culprit, but ever
afterwards he was chained to his staples.
That pony could show his delight better than any horse I have
ever known. He would fairly grin if he was allowed to go for a
run with one of my big horses who were his pals in France. Once
he chummed up with them he would have nothing to do with the
rest of the horse-lines. The three pals always knew when a day?s
leave was in the wind, and as the groom would put the light gear
and white head-ropes of ceremony and pleasure over a rail Mickey
would wistfully w r alk up and down, as if inquiring if he were asked
to the party. The boys used to say that if he were left at home he
would go and kick the first mule he could find.
MICKEY AND THE ESTAMINET
Everywhere in France and Belgium were big shops, little shops, and
the front rooms of houses, all labelled Estaminet. Some were well-
stocked general stores j others might have only a wooden table and a
couple of rough benches, but they all served wine, French beer, and
eggs cooked in every possible fashion.


-?/V
When Mickey was pulled up at one of these places he would
stand quietly outside and have a snooze, generally never moving until
his rider returned. Then his soft nose would wander all over your
pockets for the bit of bread or biscuit he was sure you had brought
him. Sometimes you would find an admiring ring of children around
him. Mickey would smell each one and inspect their clothes, much
to the delight of the youngsters. No child ever seemed frightened
of him 5 I think it was because of his bright, friendly eyes and his
handsome, shiny look.
One day, in that part of France, near Arques, which is intersected
by dozens of broad canals, I had occasion to go into one of the big
estaminets to get some mess-gear, Mickey being left, as usual, by the
side of the road near the entrance.


Owing to the damp nature of the country, this place was built
up on piles, with five heavy wooden steps leading up to the veranda.
This latter did duty as shop window, and was stacked with brooms,
pots and pans, buckets, strings of onions, and so forth. Now, a build-
ing that is raised off the ground is a rarity over there, and the steps
must have fascinated Mickey, for, to my astonishment, he appeared
at my elbow right up at the counter. While I had been arguing prices
with the shopkeeper, the little beggar had come in very quietly?
he could fairly sneak about when he wanted to, but if you saw Mickey
walking softly there w r as mischief in the wind.
Excepting cats, the only other animal I have ever owned that
could successfully do this was a Scotch terrier, but his claws always
gave him away when he had to cross linoleum.
Well, there was a pony in a stock-crowded shop, with a table
covered with china cups, saucers, jugs, basins, and plates standing in
the centre of it. Also, there was an excited Madame behind the
counter calling on all her gods to witness that now, indeed, she was
ruined, while some soldiers, eating at a side table, shrieked with
delight.
The cause of all this looked a bit sheepish at first, for he knew
he had done wrong to move, but he seemed surprised at the apparent
stir he had made, and turned inquiring eyes at me.
Thinking quickly, I turned my back on him, and, walking round
the table, just said ?Come on, Mickey,? as I made for the road.
The clever pony walked out quite easily, not even brushing the
table with the stirrup-irons, but at the top of the steps he stopped and
commenced to paw the veranda.
Down those steps he simply could not go, for his nerve had failed,
and, as I could not approach his head for fear he would promptly run
back into the table of china, I could only call him to hurry up. Mickey,


trying one trembling foot on the top step, whinnied in terror, but
would not trust his weight on the woodwork. Then the boys in the
estuminet slipped up behind him and gave him a push, which made
him take a flying leap on to the ground. I grabbed the bridle as he
landed, and walked beside him for about half a mile until he recovered
his perkiness and forgot the adventure.
On another occasion Mickey had some excitement at an estaminet
when in town with an orderly?Mickey?s official job was orderly?s
mount. He was tied to a ring in a veranda-post alongside some other
horses. A pigeon flew under the iron roof, frightening one big brute
so much that he pulled back, bringing the whole outfit of posts and
roof on to himself and his mates. The little chap was first out of the
resulting scramble, and got off with what, in a human being, would
have been a lovely black eye.
MISCHIEF
The all-too-infrequent periods of rest were Mickey?s delight, for
then he had a wonderful time in real paddocks, with lots of
buildings to explore. At the French farms where we were billeted
for the week or so out of the line, the owners were glad to give the
officers? chargers the run of their paddocks for a few francs. Of
course, the sprightly Mickey had to be included.
During those resting-times Mickey?s brain must have always
been working at high pressure thinking out mischief. He would
thieve grooming-brushes and the bags the grooms kept for their gear,
and take them into the most unlikely places. He would wander
innocently over the grass, cropping a bit here and there, until he got
close to a cow lying in the sun. A couple of shrewd kicks, and the


Ill
old lady would hastily arise and go off grumbling, while Mickey
would drift off looking for another resting milker. Every cow in
his paddock had to be on its four feet to satisfy the restless pony.
Once, in the St Omer district, I saw our Madame sprinting after
the scamp with a big French broom. He was just keeping out of her
reach, and seemed very pleased with himself, though he was taking no
chance with that broom.
When Madame returned, and her French slowed down suffi-
ciently for want of breath, I learned that the ?mechant ponee? had
industriously collected some of her
freshly washed sheets and dragged
them to a nearby duck-pond,
where their complexion was com-
pletely spoiled. It was the second
time that it had happened, and at
first Madame had blamed the
soldiers, but this time she had
caught Mickey in the act. They
do not use clothes-lines on the
French farms, but spread the
clothes on the grass all round the
buildings. Hence Mickey?s chance
of mischief.
Over in Egypt it was a fam-
iliar sight to observe what was
apparently a fat green bush coming
along the road towards you. On
closer examination you found that
the bush had four little grey legs, and that it was really a tiny donkey
with a tremendous load of green fodder tied all over it. One after-


noon, when we were billeted near a village, I found Mickey looking
very much like one of those Egyptian donks. Some French children
had dressed him up in flowering vines, and had tied bunches of flowers
in strings all over him. The pony was thoroughly enjoying himself,
for he had worked it out that it needed only the slightest objection
on his part to their pranks and he was mollified with cake or sweets.
The youngsters were all over him, and between his legs, draping more
greenery and flowers, and making enough noise to frighten a whole
six-horse team. But it didn?t worry Mickey. He was in his element.
When he saw me laughing at him and his companions he became
quite offended. He scattered his playmates in all directions, and made
off to rid himself of the decorations by rolling and rubbing along a
fence. I was sorry that I had spoiled the party by laughing at him.
I should have dearly liked to see Mickey turn up at the horse-lines
for his tucker looking like a perambulating garden.
MICKEY AND THE MANGEL-WURZEL
Unless horses and mules get proper food in proper proportion they
become ill, just like human beings. There are things known as
?vitamins? which must be supplied in some form or another to all
animals, including humans, in order to develop their bodies and
sustain life. They are queer things, for only by their absence do
we know that they exist.
That sounds absurd, but it is true, for nobody has been able to
put them in a test-tube and say: ?There is such-and-such a vitamin,?
but we know that if food without vitamins is given to animals they
will ultimately die. The withdrawal of only some of the known
vitamins produces definite disease, and a very great amount of research


and experiment took place during the war to ensure what is known as
a ?balanced diet? for men and animals.
With the soldiers? diet several expedients were adopted; for in-
stance, special methods of cooking were introduced to preserve the
natural vitamins in the food, while various extra rations supplied
others. In the case of the horses and mules, great loads of beautiful
carrots, together with salts of different kinds, went into their feed,
and when these were out of season a ration of mangel-wurzels?big,
turnip-like roots ?was issued. These, of course, were too hard and
big to give to the animals whole, so cutting-machines were sent up to
us, and the big roots chopped up small for the nosebags.
Mickey simply would not eat the chopped-up mangels, even when
we starved him. Then, behind a hut, someone discovered him chewing
a whole mangel quite happily in his own
way. With the aid of a forefoot he was
holding it to the ground while he tore
off chunks with his excellent teeth.
After that Mickey was always given his
special ration whole ?generally in a box
?so that he could chase his mangel-
wurzel into a corner and eat it in com-
fort.
In some of the shell-torn areas, and
at certain times of the year, the lack of
green fodder played up badly with our
horses, and many weary hours were
spent in the forward zone by the drivers
cutting grass which had not been eaten
out and carrying it back in chaff-bags to their four-footed pals. A
number of the boys spent quite a lot of their pay on extras for their


horses ?oil-cake, bundles of green from the French farmers, stray
bags of grain from the store-dumps when a hard-up guard could
be found.
Also, I am afraid, a great deal of ?souveniring? was done in
the hard weather. Mickey, of course, fared well as far as these extras
were concerned, but I always suspected that his wonderful coat came
from some medical units in the form of extra oil ration.
Permission was often asked by the drivers to take their team
grazing by the roadside, or to some patch discovered in a quiet corner.
Many a letter that has delighted the home-folk would never have been
written but for those hours when the horses were grazing.
MICKEY AND THE LITTLE VICOMTE
In a pretty chateau, not far behind the fighting zone, lived a charming
lady of the old aristocracy of France. Many soldiers of all nation-
alities had reason to owe her grateful thanks for wonderful services,
and her many friends always called to pay their respects when in the
neighbourhood.
In the summer of 1917, Mickey and I turned into her park-
gates bent on such a mission, and, as we were going quietly up the
soft riding track, a sudden shout came from an old fir-tree, and a little
figure in khaki and blue sprang out.
When I had collected all my reins, found the right place in the
saddle, and Mickey had returned permanently to earth again, I saw
that Madame was holding the small one by the hand, gently but
firmly admonishing him, and apologizing to me at the same time.
Quickly dismounting to receive a warm welcome, I was made
acquainted with her grandson, the young Vicomte, up from his school
in Paris. The last in the direct line, he had succeeded to the title but


-
'f
three months before, on the death of his father in the firing-line. A
nice little chap, speaking the quaintest mixture of pure French and
soldier-English, he would not pay attention to anything but Mickey,
and begged to be allowed to have a ride, finishing up: ?What about it,
Monsieur le Commandant??
Laughing at Gran?mere?s confusion at his importunity, I promptly
ran up the stirrups of the little exercise saddle, and was preparing to
give the boy a leg-up when, to my astonishment,
Mickey wheeled and stood head-on, breathing hard
through distended nostrils, his ears stuck forward.
In my surprise at such an exhibition by the
well-behaved Mickey, I spoke sharply to
him, and, tucking his tail in, he wheeled
alongside, as he had been taught.
After that I was
afraid to leave the
Vicomte by himself,
and walked alongside,
holding the sulky
Mickey?s bridle. With
his ears back, and go-
ing like a cat on hot
bricks, that pony
showed his distaste for
the little chap in the
saddle. Finally he
commenced to pig-
root !
Madame and I
laughed and laughed, until I most unceremoniously hauled the young
nobleman off his perch, much to his disgust. That little devil of a


Mickey was only rising about an inch and a half each root, so as
to show his displeasure without hurting the boy.
It was very funny to me ?I had seen Mickey easily throw men
of fourteen stone ?and Madame seemed to find it equally humorous,
but never again did I try to put a youngster up on Mickey, even though
he did try to make up for his churlishness by later on doing all his
tricks, and following the little Vicomte round like a dog.
The performance with the boy made me try the experiment of
putting Bud the Monkey on Mickey?s back when we returned to the
lines, but there was no display?Mickey simply took no notice.
I must tell you of Mickey?s exploits with the only horses he
regarded as his chums ?my two big, Australian chargers. For many
years they were together ?all through unit changes and other fortunes
of war the trio went with me, because their queer friendship was well
known, and, if it is possible to arrange otherwise, no true horseman
ever parts a man and his horses, even in wartime.

IN GENERAL
DID you ever think that horses recognize their own rank in the
Army? The sergeant-major?s horse is never happy unless
he is tied up at the end of the horse-line, although only yester-
day he may have been in a team. The trumpeter?s horse would think
he had done something wrong if he w r ere not taken off the lines and
saddled while the other horses were finishing their nosebags, and
he quite understands that, if the trumpeter swears at him for nothing,
it is because that lad has had to leave his nosebag too soon in the course
of duty. They both have in their minds the fact that they will be
right up at the head of the column and away from the dust.
Give that horse to the quartermaster-sergeant, who has to travel
at the rear of the column, and he will at first sulk, and think that
the world is all grey, until he finds out that his new boss owns the
feed-heap and the bread scraps. Then he will develop all the traits
of a quartermaster?s horse ?he will never be surprised or frightened,
nor will he look intelligent, except at feed-time.


The sergeant-major drops his sternness and finds his horse a tit-bit.


The sergeant-major?s horse ?the proud owner of the end of the
horse-line ?always has a good groom. His saddle fits like a glove,
but it must be girthed up jur,t when the Autocrat of the Horse-lines
walks out of the sergeants? mess. The old horse knows this, and keeps
one eye on the boy and one on the sergeants? mess, and fusses with
his bits if he thinks the groom is late. You have got to do that sort
of thing if you want to remain the S.M.?s horse, just as you must not
forget to ?stay put,? .or ?follow,? as you are told. If you don?t, back
to the section you go, and the extra handful of corn and the ?dip?
of green stuff does not come your way.
The officers? chargers have a social plane all of their own, and
they know it. The power of the omnipotent sergeant-major ceases
to a great extent at the officers? horse-lines, and he may stand and
grind his teeth while the grooms talk to their horses as they rub them,
and tell them things that are really meant for the S.M.
But that gentleman can never be sure enough to make an orderly
room charge.
Soon the wise horses get to appreciate the high position they
occupy, and they swank as much as the grooms. Of course, the junior
subaltern?s horse is properly humble, because he knows that he might
have to go back to the section, especially if his rider cannot sit him,
and blames ?that blanky horse? for his poor riding performances. The
captain?s horse has a wonderful life, for his boss is never in a real
hurry, and, though keeping the tail of the column may be dusty, it
is near the feed-wagon.
All these animals are pets, and far superior to ?just horses? of
the workaday sort. The sergeant-major treats his horse as a piece
of furniture, but watch him taking a last look round the lines before
going to bed, and you will find him finishing at his mount, and from
a pocket which by day looks as if it had never contained anything


in its life, comes a tit-bit, and the old horse seems to expect the rare
attention. The quartermaster-sergeant may hit his horse on the nose
with the big ration-book, but he will sneak a couple of carrots for him
from the railhead dump. The trumpeter will pass on to his mount
all the ?Old Man? or the sergeant-major has said to him, but he
will sympathize with the horse when the ?Old Man?s? charger gives
him a sly kick owing to the trumpeter riding too close.
They were the pampered ones. You must not think they were
drones, those special horses. Far from it 5 to do their job they had
to be as fit as footballers, and ready to turn out cheerily and carry
their masters day and night without failing.
The rank-and-file of horseland ??just horses? ?had their daily
round with the troopers on patrol, the guns and ammunition and the
supply-wagons. The pampered ones were liable to be called out at
any time for some heavy work, and had to be fit and ready.
HONK
Way back in 1914 Honk came over from a Regular battery to the
Australian Imperial Force. In 1919 he was sold in France ?a good,
sound old horse, with many years of work in him.
Forty years of soldiering, in the shape of a fat old farrier-
sergeant, told me to pick him for a charger, although he was then
eleven years of age ?well up for a remount ?because he was hard
and sound in wind and limb, and, the old man added, ?he uses
his head.?
Honk he was, and Honk he remained to the end, owing to his
funny habit of saying ?Honk? quite distinctly when he was taken to


?STRï¿½*y^iiPS
i
his place on the horse-lines and unsaddled after a trip. Bring him
in half a dozen times a day, and he would just look round for his
feed, but bring him in for good and he seemed to know, and ?honked?
the minute you unbuckled his girth.
A wonderful pal was old Honk.
On lonely jobs one could talk to him like
a human, and 1 am sure he understood.
On chilly nights out in the desert I have
slept curled up between his legs, cuddled
against his warm body. He would wake
you with his nose when he wanted to
turn over, and he seemed to like com-
pany through the night.
Wounded nine times on the Galli-
poli Peninsula, he was evacuated to
Egypt in August 1915, and reached
France with a different Division from
the one I rejoined from hospital. It
was some three months before I was
able to retrieve him, but from that time
on until the end of the war he served me
faithfully, and when it came that 1
had to leave him and his mates I was the saddest man in the A.I.F.
The French farmer who purchased Honk got a great worker, although
he was all of sixteen years old. I only hope he appreciated the fact,
and gave him better treatment than the average French peasant hands
to his animals.
Honk was a fine specimen of ?Waler,? as the Australian horse
is called. A very dark bay, with black points and not a sign of white
about him, he stood well, and had been excellently handled, and


broken to both saddle and harness. Those eight years of soldiering
before he came to me had taught him his business and at least three
times the cunning of average
four-footed things.
His history, as it was told
me by the officer who origi-
nally purchased him as a re-
mount, is interesting. The
State of New South Wales has
a famous Mounted Police
Corps, and all its horses for
generations have been blacks,
or bays with black points. In
the past they were nearly all
of one breed, and carried the ?Z R?
brand. A rival breeder, the owner of
a well-known stud, decided to cut in
on the police and military remount
business, and purchased suitable pedi-
gree stock to evolve the type. Honk
was one of the first youngsters sent down to the sales, and, with two
half-brothers, fell to the military bid.
He was born in the open country in the south-west of the State,
and later transferred to another of the breeder?s stations amongst the
wild New England Ranges in the north, where he grew up as sure-
footed as a goat.
Although he was apparently oblivious to his work or surround-
ings, I do not think Honk ever missed anything, and, while he put
up with things quite philosophically, yet he had his own methods of
getting even. For instance, if he disliked his rider, unless I told him


to be a gentleman, one heavy hoof would somehow get on to a nice,
shiny boot ?quite by accident, of course ?or Honk would move for-
ward just those few inches that would land the mounting man on the
iron cantle of the saddle instead of fairly in the seat.
Another trick of the old horse was to refuse to trot in a proper
manner. I really got him back in France through this ?fault,? because,
when I offered to ?swop? a nice English cob for him, they seemed
rather delighted, and admitted that nobody had been able to make
him trot without ?breaking,? and his awkward gait made the Colonel
wild when he saw one of his officers riding him. After the exchange
was affected, the old beggar whisked his tail and, with a malicious
gleam in his eye, carried me the whole five or six miles home at a
perfect trot, never breaking except to change his feet at long intervals.
A few weeks later Honk and I won a trotting match at a Divisional
Sports run by his old owners!
There was a big officer who usually relieved me when I was in
hospital, and whom Honk particularly disliked, giving him some
awfully rotten rides. My other horse, Red?un, simply would not
let that man stay in the saddle for a minute, so he nearly always
borrowed someone else?s mount. One day, when he was in charge
of the unit out in rest, he was invited to a big sports meeting organized
by a crack English cavalry regiment, and ordered my ceremonial
trappings to be got ready and put on Honk, determined to make a
brave show at the gathering. Now, Red?un dearly loved to be dressed
up in breastplate, white head-rope, saddle-cloth, etc., and generally
carried me to such events, swanking on to the ground as if he was the
wildest thing imaginable, but actually going like a rocking-horse. He
vas quite disgusted when he saw the gear being put on Honk, and
more so when he discovered that he was not even included with the
groom in the ride.


But Honk took revenge for the lot of them, because, after going
like a lamb right up to the big paddock where the sports were to be
held, and just as my substitute was straightening his pockets and setting
his cap to make a dignified entry, that wily
horse, taking the light snaffle-bit in his teeth,
turned round and went all the miles home.
Not the slightest notice would he take of
either reins, whip, or
spurs, but just cantered
back, wheeling into the
lines and stopping where
his rider had mounted
him.
That unfortunate
officer had to ignomini-
ously take another mount,
after wasting some preci-
ous hours of leave on
?that brute.? A man like
that would spoil any
horse by not making him
do his job, I wonder if
Honk, Red?un, and Mickey had a quiet chuckle to themselves when
everybody?s back was turned?
Honk had second-sight as far as shells were concerned, and, after
a few lessons, I gave in to his judgment. I always rode him up to
the line because of his steadiness, and sometimes he would want to
go by a different route from the one I had selected. Twice I forced
him to take my track, and we were nearly killed by sudden bursts of


long-range shelling. On another occasion he got a piece of high-
explosive shell in his rump. It must have missed me by inches.
In some fearfully hot corners Honk always stuck close to me,
never exhibiting the terror or nervousness that caused other horses
to be held. He was very frightened of shells and aeroplane bombs,
but he would stay by and nudge your arm now and again, as if to let
you know he was there.
Of one bad habit we could not break him. He would allow
only certain of the farriers to shoe him, and sometimes when I was
away from the unit, or when he was with the other Division, they had
to throw him to get his shoes fixed. I have seen him empty a smithy,
his vicious heels knocking the anvil and forge over among the tools.
Then he would stand at the door defying everybody.
Two of the original farrier-sergeants could take him, manicure
his feet, and put new shoes on without even a bridle on the old devil,
who would take quite an interest in the proceedings. His groom took
many a long trip to find one of those farriers, to save his precious
horse being knocked about in the roping and throwing process.
A good groom took great pride in his chargers. In fact, he lived
for them. Treated like children, nursed and talked to, those horses
were pampered, perhaps, but it was really a continuous training, so
that they should be ready and fit for any job that was required. Some-
times they were called upon to make trips of tremendous length, and
at other times speed and certainty of going without a breakdown w'ere
essential.
In the early spring of 1917 I remember one very long run that
meant a straight thirty-seven-hour ride. It was only the fact that I
had fine horses in the pink of condition which made it possible to
complete the journey on time.
In charge of a billeting party, I left camp on Red?un just after


daylight. With the groom mounted on Honk, I rode southward,
halting at pre-selected places to allot billets for my Brigade, dropping
a man at each halt to guide the columns to their places. Reaching
the end of what would be a three days? trek for the Brigade, I was
preparing to turn in for a well-earned sleep, when an orderly from
the Town Major?s office arrived with a signal message. It was an
instruction to return to the line and take command of a unit whose
O.C. had been wounded on the eve of a big battle.
It was an urgent call, and there was nothing for me to do but
climb back into the saddle and retrace my steps. A feed and a rest
seemed to have made Red?un quite fit, and, taking a horse from one
of the billeting party for the groom, and putting a couple of extra
feeds on Honk, off we rode into the night. At midnight, after giving
them a feed, I changed horses, and about daylight came on the
Brigade. Leaving the strange horse and collecting Mickey, away we
went again, with fresh feeds in the nosebags. As I was saving Honk
for the nasty ride up to the line, Red?un had to carry me most of the
journey.
On reaching the wagon-lines of my new unit, we left the big
chestnut, and an hour later I sent Honk back for a feed and a rest,
just over the day and a half since setting out. I finished the last of
the trip on foot, arriving in time to take over and get ready for the
scrap which took place very early next morning.
Next day neither horse showed the slightest sign of the journey,
which spoke volumes for the care that had been lavished on them by
the groom. When it is considered that the ride was, for the most part,
on rough, hard pave road?in the night you had to stick to the main
track all the way ?it makes the trip all the more remarkable. I have
ridden farther and much faster in Australia, but on good soft going
?which makes all the difference to both horse and man.


Honk had a fine black tail, of which his groom was justly proud.
Pulled and trimmed to a nicety, it was kept in splendid condition, so
you may imagine the anger of the boy when, hearing a commotion in
the winter stable that sheltered Honk, he found a stray mule calmly
chewing that beautiful tail, which had somehow become caught in
a splinter on one of the posts supporting the roof of the stable. Honk
was nearly frantic with rage, but he could not reach his attacker with
his heels, while the mule, with the bland, cow-like expression of his
kind, seemed to be just eating in his sleep.
As became a regular soldier, Honk would run anywhere in a
team, or take out a cart in collar harness. This trait was quite useful
after we stopped the German break-through and found ourselves in
a peaceful sector with nothing much to do.
In the abandoned French farms were innumerable dilapidated old


vehicles that had not been used for years. Many of them had been
damaged by shell-fire. The Australians got a good deal of fun out
of them before they were collected by the French Mission, and stored
in a town yard, where, incidentally, they were nearly all destroyed by
German aeroplane bombs, the enemy evidently taking the mass for
tanks.
No sign of any movement by Fritz left a lot of time on the boys?
hands in the good weather, and the ancient turnouts proved fine play-
things. An old governess-cart was hauled out, and, with due regard
to the size of its harness, Mickey was selected as motive power.
Looking disdainfully at the contraption, he allowed the funny old
head-collar and its huge winkers to be put on, and the great collar
and traces to be adjusted and hitched up. But when the breeching
was slipped in place behind him, out of the yard went the lot and
Mickey fairly kicked the old basket-work to pieces, and broke most
of the harness.
Honk went into a high-backed, red sulky with all the parapher-
nalia of true French harness on him ?silver and brassware, and tinkly
bells complete.
He stepped out as solemnly as if he had been taking the family
to church in that old bus for years.
In that sulky three of us paid a visit to the unit on our right,
and, not to be out-done, the next day their Commander arrived at our
palatial farm in a genuine, high-wheeled yellow dogcart, with one of
his own horses in the shafts and the doctor?s cob in the lead. On
his head, set at a rakish angle, was one of those old French top-hats
made familiar by the comic papers, but the scream of the show was
his diminutive batman, acting ?tiger? at the back of the cart. He
jumped down and ran to the leader?s head the instant the driver pulled
the long-suffering cob on his hind-legs.


Then a gun-team of six coal-black horses came down the main
road, dragging one of those huge coach affairs that the Scarlet Pim-
pernel and his pals used at the time of the Revolution. The drivers
were converted into genuine postilions by the aid of sundry liveries
discovered in the stable of a ruined chateau. But the doctor and the
fadre inside were having rather an exciting ride, as the gun-team
did not like the great, lumbering concern behind them. Of course,
there was an awful row about the unauthorized use of horses, etc., but
more trouble started with the enemy, and it was all forgotten.
Old Honk naturally had his tricks. When you asked him what
he wanted he would shake his head up and down if it was a feed he
was after, but if he wanted a drink he would stamp his near forefoot
as well. If he were kept out past his meal-hours he would gently
remind you that he needed attention by these same means. Should
anyone take an interest in him, he would immediately offer to ?shake
hands? by lifting the nearest foreleg most insistently. But he would
become very angry if in friendliness you did not shake it.
RED?UN
I am afraid that my favourite mount was the big chestnut, Red?un,
so called from the moment he reached us at Mena Camp, Egypt, on
account of his beautiful, red-gold coat. He was such a perfect hack,
such a striking looking animal ?and such a devil ?that you had to like
him. A great, tall, powerful fellow, with a short white blaze, and
two white socks on his hind-feet, he showed all the fine lines and
carriage of the hunter he was.
One of a four-horse team presented to the Government by a
Queensland squatting family, he came to us in the first batch of


remounts from Australia, sent to make up the losses of the long,
fourteen-week voyage of the First Division. He was drafted to an
ammunition column. Only about three years old, and fresh from the
wilds of the northern tablelands, he was almost unbroken, and his
wicked eyes would flash white, and his small ears go back at the slight-
est restraint.
After giving several people a trip to hospital, he was put off-
lead of a team where he had no man to carry, but he gave the lead
driver an awful life. It usually took two men all their time to groom
him, one to hold him with a ?twitch,? and the other to brush. His
unenviable reputation grew, but, of course, no horse could be allowed
to ?boss? like that, so he was given many a hiding, until he became
moderately tame in the hands of his regular driver.
One day an officer, who at home was a keen hunting-man, decided
to take him as a mount, and proceeded to school him at the jumps.
He was a fine horse-master, and understood the workings of a horse?s
brain. First of all he had a light saddle prepared, and specially fitted
to suit the big chap?s back and shoulders. Then he used a light bit,
with strong, thin reins, instead of the great curb of the regulation
bridle. Achieving his results by these means, he got a magnificent
charger, but one that was a perfect fiend on the lines.
When, soon after reaching France, that officer was put out of the
war for good and invalided home, he sent a message asking me to take
Red?un and his complete gear, so I worked the exchange the first
time we were out of the line. They seemed pleased to give him to
me, which made me suspect that he had been playing up again.
I decided to handle the great beast myself at first, because, from
what his previous owner had told me, I gathered that it was rather
a case of ?Not Understood? with Red?un. Most of our folk being
on leave, I had the place very much to myself, and spent the night


playing with him and talking all sorts of rubbish. I found that he
possessed that saving grace of man and horse ?a sense of humour.
He would tease you and try to frighten you with his great teeth by
making vicious snaps that just missed your arm or shoulder, while
his eyes flashed white and his ears lay flat. He would play with your
coat-sleeves with his lips, and then give you a sly nip to see how much
you would stand, jumping back as if frightened you were going to
hit him. By the morning I had established quite amicable relations
with Red?un, and he was following me round like a dog, and shaking
hands perfectly.
Getting a brush, I started to
groom the wild thing, and, follow-
ing his trainer?s methods, left his
head free. I managed his ears, face,
and neck, and cautiously started to do
his legs when ? Bang !
A real bite this time, but for-
tunately only the slack of my riding-
breeches had been trapped and was
being held as if in a vice. While
I finished his legs, Red?un kept a
tight hold, as he evidently considered
I was working on a ticklish spot. He
let go when they were finished, and
the rest of him was easy after I had
patted him for a moment or two to show I did not mind him holding
my pants.
That was the trick of dealing with the reputed outlaw, \ou
gave him perfect freedom and let him hold a piece of your shirt or
pants, and he was quite happy. When my regular groom came off


leave on the following day I told him my experience, and he never
had any trouble with Red?un afterwards. If anything ticklish had
to be done, he presented the intelligent horse with a bit of his sleeve
to hold, or gave him one end of a cloth while he held the other, and
everything was satisfactory. On occasions when his groom went
to hospital or on long leave, Red?un had to pick the substitute from
a group of three or four men, for it was unsafe to allow a man he
disliked to go near him. He was simply ruthless in attack ?biting,
kicking, and striking unmercifully. No dog ever got within reach of
his long front-legs and lived to tell the tale, and yet with me or his
groom he was like a lamb, and loved to rub a clean, sweet-smelling
muzzle round the back of your neck or down under your jaw when
you were halted on the march or waiting for the order to mount.
Another funny trick of his was to rest his chin quite heavily on your
shoulder from behind if you were talking to anyone, just as if he was
listening to the conversation.
The wonderful length of his pasterns and the lissom mounting
of his hooves made Red?un go as if he was fitted with shock-absorbers,
even on the hardest roads, while he was like a cat on his feet. The
first time I got on his back there was great trouble. Perhaps it was that
sense of humour I spoke of that made him do it, but out of that
military saddle, with no knee-pads and no wallets to save me, I shot
like a rocket. It seemed hours that I was flying through the air until
I hit the earth with a dull thud.
When I got my wind back I put on a hunting-saddle, took a
steel-centred leather whip, and had it out once and for all with Mr
Red?un. When it was over I was sore and tired, and so was he. His
nice, shiny coat was all weals on the shoulders and rump, but, you
see, he had to have his lesson, because a horse that plays up is no good
if you are on urgent business.


I have often wondered just what he did that morning, because
it was all too quick for me to pick out the action, and nobody else
seemed to have seen it.
Had Red?un known all the tricks
that Mickey had in his head we could
never have done anything with him.
but as a buck jumper he was no class.
He certainly could jump, and he
loved it, too, for, dreaming along at
the head of a slow-moving column on
a trek, if he saw a jump or two erected
by some cavalry crowd in a field, he
would swing and squeal and want to
go over into the paddock and try them
out.
When I was riding at twelve-
stone two, Red?un would take me, in
full marching order and riding a big
regulation saddle, over a five-foot-
six-inch brush fence quite easily. The -
biggest fright he ever gave me was
in the lines of an English battery,
where they had a jump erected for
schooling young horses, with high
wings to force the youngsters over the /!
hurdle. Red?un, of course, had to
try it, and, just as he was about to take off he rolled a bit on a stone,
and pulled up sideways-on by the fence. To my astonishment he gave
that excited squeal and hopped the wing of the jump from a stand!
Sometimes we came on a paddock with four or five properly


rigged jumps, evidently used at some time for a sports-meeting.
Riding one horse, with the groom on the other, I would go round a
few times in the early morning for exercise, to the delight of the
horses. Honk jumped as he did everything else?just as he had been
taught. He did not have the ease of Red?un, but he liked the excite-
ment every bit as much. Mickey -always enjoyed a run with the
jumping party, and with no saddle or bridle on him would canter
round with us. He would keep in line with the other two, rising and
jumping with them at the smaller fences, and running round the
taller ones to pick us up on the other side, as if nothing had happened.
Honk also liked to go round without a rider, and he would rise and land
in perfect time with the big fellow. But if you let Red?un go on his
own he might take the first jump all right, and at the second would
bite Honk as he rose to it. He caught me like that once, and we all
nearly came a frightful buster.
Talking of falls, the worst I ever had with Red?un was at a
Divisional sports-meeting, when, travelling very fast, the big chap
hit a piece of timber that had been carelessly left sticking up in the
brush on top of the hurdle. We both turned several somersaults,
with the result that I got a dislocated shoulder and a split shoulder-
blade, and Red?un?s back was so badly hurt by the saddle that we
thought he was finished.
When riding to Hazebrouck one day, for some reason I had no
groom with me. A groom was a very necessary person to have with
the big horses, who were always up to mischief when left alone,
though Mickey was quite safe by himself on the road.
Stopping at an estaminet for some refreshment, I left Red?un
hitched to a fence in the sunshine. When I came out again I was
horrified to see one of those pretty, flaxen-haired French kiddies, about
four years of age, holding up its doll for Red?un to smell.


Knowing what that prince of devils used to do to dogs, my
heart was in my mouth for the wee one, but that queer brute became
interested in the nearly white hair of the child, and played with it
by tweeking the ends in
his lips, the kiddie laugh-
ing merrily and trying to
pat the horse?s nose.
Then Red?un found that
if he breathed hard that
interesting hair whirled
about on the child?s head,
which amused him so
much that he did not
even mind the little
hands running up and
down his legs. When
Maman called the young-
ster I sighed with relief,
and going over to the chestnut,
asked him if he were not well.
There was one thing I always
liked about Honk and Red?un.
They would go anywhere without
the slightest hesitation if you led the way, although from their snorts
you knew that they were actually very frightened. Into any shape
or form of railway truck, covered or uncovered, up ramps and across
narrow bridges, they would calmly step, thus making it easy to get
other and more timid animals to follow.
When the horses were being embarked in Australia, the liners
lay alongside the wharves, and tremendously long ramps made of


timber led to their decks. Honk led the way up on his ship, and time
and time again was taken ashore to make the ascent in order to give
some new arrivals enough confidence to walk on board. Many times,
when the other horses refused to roll in a sand-bath, my pet mounts
would be brought along and told to go down, even though they had
already had their turn. Then the other stupid animals would roll
and enjoy it.
Red?un, Honk, and Mickey were great pals. When they were
turned out together they would play for hours like a lot of boys,
chasing each other round and giving and receiving quite hard knocks.
Mickey, of course, was the mischief-maker, and he would tease the
other two unmercifully, until Red?un would chase him in earnest, and,
getting alongside, take a mouthful of his crest, just at the base of his
mane, and shake that pony like a fox-terrier does a rat. This would
usually sober Mickey up for quite a while.
At the end of the 1917 summer they became too rough at their
play, and had to be separated like naughty children. Then they would
hang over the fences, and each would scratch the other with his teeth
all over, very carefully, turning round in the cunningest fashion so
that no little bit should escape attention.
One London leave I spotted a fine oilskin riding-coat, with a
camel?s-hair lining buttoned into it. Its colour took my fancy, so,
with visions of a comfortable winter, I purchased it.
The first wet day back in France it was duly put on, and I went
out to mount Red?un to go to a conference at Headquarters; but
after one look and a sniff the chestnut backed away without even
greeting me. He did not approve of that coat at all, and took quite
a lot of mounting. It was not the smell, for my groom wore a black
oilskin frequently, and he took no notice.
That day there was none of the long Australian ?lope? that only


the waler possesses and which Red?un could keep up for hours, while
you sat as if in an easy chair. He went jerkily, with his head down,
and took no interest in anything. The groom and I laughed at him,
which made things worse, for any intelligent animal hates to be laughed
at, and will sometimes become very savage. He kicked my ankle
rather severely when I mounted to go home, and seemed so annoyed
that afterwards I rode Honk when I was wearing the hated coat.
A few weeks later I went to Bailleul for luncheon at the club, and
the horses were left in the Square with the other chargers, the grooms
relieving one another so that they might do their shopping and have
a meal. As it was starting to rain, my chap covered Honk?s saddle
with the famous coat, and went off to do his purchases. When he
came back for his turn as guard over the
horses he found that Red?un had chewed
a foot off the bottom of the new oilskin
coat for about two-thirds round. He
had also bitten a hole in the middle of
the back. So Red?un had his revenge
on the coat that offended him, and my
waterproof was reduced to a British
Warm and had to be patched.
In spite of his size, Red?un was
extraordinarily light on shoes, and,
although bred in loose, sandy country,
his feet were large, at the same time
the issue shoes were too clumsy for him.
One of Honk?s old farrier-sergeant
friends fixed up the trouble by making two sets of steel slippers ?light,
narrow shoes ?out of old blacksmith?s rasps, which were very hard and
light. He also made two extra slippers, one fore and one hind, which


were carried in the shoes-cases on Red?un?s saddle, and those ten
shoes lasted him for ever two years. Of course, they had to come
off at regular intervals to allow his feet to be eased and the hooves
pared, but they were then tacked back.
A horse?s foot is a wonderful piece of mechanism} it may be said
to correspond with the middle finger of our hands, the hoof being
the nail. ou know how fast your nails grow?well, the big nail on
the horse?s foot grows just the same, and the shoe ?which is only
put on to allow the animal to travel over hard roads and carry the
weight of a man, or other loads for which Nature did not make
allowance ?is soon overgrown and carried out of comfortable fit as
the horn increases. So the shoes must come off frequently, whether
they are worn down or not, to allow the nails to be cut. In their
natural state, without the protective shoes, the softer underportion of
the foot known as the u frog? has a suction action, enabling the animal
to stand even on slippery surfaces. In some cities, where cobbled
streets abound, such as Liverpool, the police and fire-brigade horses
have been fitted with rubber attachments that are fixed under the shoe
to imitate the natural action on wet or frosty cobbles.
There is another of Red?un?s comicalities of which I must tell
you. Whenever it was possible in the winter weather we got my
horses under shelter, and gave them a bed. My boys worked hard to
achieve this, for even a few days out on the lines spoilt their coats,
in spite of the special horse-rugs I got for them to wear under their
regulation issue. Straw you could always buy from the farmers, or
sou\ enir from an abandoned hay-nck, but Red?un gave the groom
no peace with his bed.
Every night it would be put down for him, nicely spread and
shaken up, but go back in an hour and he would be wandering aim-
lessly around his loose-box, with straw scattered everywhere. Ulti-


mately, he would most disgustedly spread out on the cold stone floor.
In the daytime, after the stable w r as cleaned out, the bedding would
be piled under the manger, ready for laying again.
One very cold night the groom came back from the village with
far too much vin hlanc inside to even remember his beloved horses.
Very ashamed of himself next morning, he went to see the horses
in the old stable, and found a cold, dejected-looking Honk, who gazed
at him with a ?more in sorrow than in anger? expression. Next door
was Red?un, not yet up, stretched on a nice, tidy bed.
The boy rubbed his eyes, for he was sure he had not spread the
straw the day before, and he cautiously inquired of his mates if any
of them had put Red?un?s bed down for him, but nobody knew any-
thing about it.
I came down to the wagon-lines that day, and he told me about
it, appearing honestly puzzled. A still-contrite groom left the bedding
under the manger again that night, and stayed around to watch what
happened. Presently he came and called me, and we saw that horse
carefully raking the straw out of the corner, shifting it fairly well
over the floor, but leaving a good bundle at the top for his head!
After that, Red?un always made his own bed, and the Veterinary
Surgeon suggested that, if the war lasted long enough, we might
even teach him to shake it up and put it back in its place in the daytime.
I have had dogs that appreciated a pillow and have worn out
many coir doormats trying to roll one corner under, as they did the
soft mats inside, but never have I heard of a horse with that trait ?
except Red?un.
The formula of greeting my two horses first thing in the morn-
ing was amusing. They worked it out themselves, and each was very
jealous of his part in the procedure. Whenever I was in the wagon-
lines, or we were just out of the line, the programme was a ride soon


after daylight. The groom would bring the horses round saddled
and ready to start. To do the job properly I had to walk between them
from the rear, but, if I came any other way, they manoeuvred round
until I was in the right position, and then each would raise the nearest
foreleg to shake hands.
Then Red?un would gently brush my cheek with his muzzle,
being careful not to knock me with the bit, and Honk would follow
suit. Just how it started Ido not know. Possibly they were encour-
aged by the groom after one demonstration, but that was always my
greeting. It only took place in the morning. If they were feeling
very pleased with themselves, they might offer to shake hands later,
but they never repeated the formal ?cheek brushing? business.
It seems such a pity we cannot
get closer to an animal?s thoughts;
they must reason these things out,
but their form of reasoning escapes
us poor humans.
Red?un hated to be lonely. He
liked to think that the groom was
camped close by his stall if he were
under cover, and often he would
make a noise just to hear the man?s
voice ?rousing? at him and telling
him, to be quiet. When we came
back to civilization after the frightful
1916 winter, we thought we were
giving Red?un a treat by hiring a
place that was really a feed-room, as a warm stable at night. Of
course, no matter what accommodation the horses had at night, they


always spent the day in the open, and had to go their regular exercise
miles to keep them hard.
Well, above this room was a big loft, and the boys were to sleep
there while Honk and Mickey shared a shed at the back. For some
reason the men changed their minds, having possibly found more
congenial quarters near Madame?s stove. In the middle of the night
Red?un became lonely, and, before anyone could stop him, kicked his
way through the feed-room wall into the cold moonlight.
The workmanship of that barn-like building left much to be
desired, being built of lath and plaster fastened to three-inch round
uprights in the approved
French fashion. With
the attention of Red?un?s
heels, practically half one
wall went out, and part
of the loft came
down.
Much jabber
ing in excited French
between Madame,
most of Madame?s
relations, the local
Mayor and my offi-
cial Interpreter re-
sulted in the enor-
mous bill submitted
being reduced to
about one-eighth, but even then it was an expensive night?s lodging
for one horse.
After I left France, Red?un fretted and refused to jump for


different people who tried him out. Finally, he broke down altogether,
and, when the war ended a few weeks later, he was cast and destroyed
at Rouen. I was glad for his sake that he was not sold to a peasant
farmer, for his temperament would have had him always up against
his new owner, and probably a fence paling would have been the
lightest thing which the latter would have used on him. The French
farmer method of breaking in a horse is to stun it a few times with a
pick-handle. It soon learns ?or dies .. .
Cheery souls, those horses of mine! Fine pals! They were
only two out of thousands of similar lovable animals who shared those
bad years with the soldiers, but they have a special niche in my memory,
and, I think, will always make me tolerant of all four-footed creatures
?camels excepted!


/HiCE ft
ON a comparatively flat part of the British Front was a long,
wriggly line of hill that was a tremendous worry to the General
Staff because it was almost impossible to capture, and equally
difficult to hold.
What was to be done? The hill was a menace, not only owing
to the cover it gave for an attack, but because it looked into the rear
of our positions farther north, and yet . . . Well, you have heard of
the faith that moves mountains. So had the General Staff j therefore
they sent for it. The Mining Corps was its name, and the faith was
in its own ability. Though a distinctly unangelic crowd, a mere moun-
tain was nothing to those clever miners. They simply set to work
to shift it off the map.
Week by week they bored farther and farther into that hill.
Hunched up in queer positions, sometimes on their sides, sometimes
squatting on their heels, they swung their little picks and raked out
the earth and stones with their funny little snub-nosed shovels. Work-
ing like demons behind them were stocky, hard-handed men who fixed


timbers to hold up the crumbling walls and roof as each day those
holes crept nearer the German trenches.
As each miner or group of miners delved away from the entrance
to the little tunnel, the difficulty of ventilation became greater,
in spite of the fact that motor-driven
fans were kept going day and night.
The men ran a risk of being overcome
by the deadly gas which is generated in
confined spaces, and which
works so insidiously that the
victim does not know that he
is absorbing poison.
That wonderful Quarter-
master-General?s Department,
on which the armies in the
field depend for their exist-
ence, promptly supplied the
Mining Corps with mice and canaries, delivering the goods in nice
little cages, and adding the necessary food for these strange soldiers
to the ration list.
Orders were issued that miners working in certain places must
take a bird or some mice with them, because these creatures would
feel the effect of the gas before the men, and, by dying, give a sure
indication of danger. Many of the miners in their homeland were
accustomed to having canaries and mice in the depths with them. But
there they were handled by special officials, and were regarded as part
of the machinery. In the war it was different.
At home there were the missus and the kids, the racing whippets
and the trotting ponies, on which to pour out their natural protective-
ness and affection. But in Europe, with the shells, and the aeroplane


' I I
bombs, and the gas, they had only the canaries and mice to care for,
and, just as the troopers and drivers became attached to their horses
and mules, so the miners adopted their little pals.
Over and over again men ?forgot? to take their cages under-
ground. Warnings seemed to have no effect; they risked their own
lives every hour of the day, but would not take their pets into danger.
Then stricter measures had to be taken, and
many miners were brought up to the orderly
room and charged with disobedience of orders.
But even that seemed to do no good, for the
?forgetfulness? continued, and the Command-
ing Officer, who, as a lifelong friend, I knew
to have been a soft-hearted chap where dumb
animals were concerned, was troubled. Then
he hit on the plan of getting up a double supply
of the little danger-signals and issuing them at
the tunnel entrances, leaving the pets with the
miners who were doing such great work.
The C.O. was delighted with the success
of the scheme. It was a justifiable relaxation
of the usual military discipline, for his men
were simple, hard-working miners, and not ordinary enlisted soldiers.
They were volunteers in the highest sense, giving their special know-
ledge to their country, at the risk of death in many horrible forms.
The terrible strain of working away down in the confined spaces
underground was bad enough, but added thrills in the shape of enemy
countermining to get in first with the blowing-up business made a shift
in the tunnels extremely exciting. You could often hear the picks of
the countermining party quite distinctly thud-thud-thudding in their
own tunnel. They sounded terribly near to a visitor, who usually


thought he had seen all he wanted to of the great undertaking, and
sauntered out to the daylight again.
Yet brave officers of the Mining Corps spent all their time
moving from drive to drive trying to locate the exact position of the
enemy tunnel by deciding where the noise of the digging was loudest.
When they were reasonably sure of the actual spot, one of those
delightful little toys, called by the French a ?camouflette,? was put
to work. It was a long, gimlet
affair that was screwed into the
earth. When the point went out
into space ?which was indicated
by the lack of resistance to its
operation ?a charge was pushed
down in place of the rod, and
fired in the enemy workings.
The enemy used these in-
struments, too, and the minute
a miner noticed a piece of earth
commencing to move by itself, he fled to save himself and warn his
mates. But, if he did not notice that movement, nobody ever saw
him again, and probably the explosion would bury others as well. Out
of twenty great mines put into the hill, only one was exploded by the
Germans, and, with the successful blowing up of the other nineteen,
the terrible Messines Ridge vanished in the greatest explosion ever
attempted in the world.
A fine memorial has been erected to commemorate the services
of the birds that assisted the armies in the war, but except for a panel
in the Scottish War Memorial the delightful statue of Peter Pan has
to serve as a place of remembrance for the work of the mice. No
mouse could possibly want a better memorial, nor could one be placed
in a prettier setting than Kensington Gardens, London.

ï¿½ assorted " l
EARLY TYPES
THEY were at the war in their thousands. The supply never
seemed to run low. Big dogs ; little dogs; thoroughbreds, with
pedigrees as long as the historical records of the regiments that
owned them; plain ?tykes,? with two left front-paws, one ear up and
the other down. Dogs with tails that curled so suspiciously that
Pomeranian ancestry was certain, although the war-edition was half-
Irish, half-fox terrier in general appearance. Sharp dogs, surly dogs
and sneaky dogs?they all managed to find some pal among the
soldiers.
During the course of the war I never saw a dog turned out of
a camp or bivouac, but Nature, the enemy, and general accidents kept
the dog-world from becoming overcrowded. My big chestnut horse,
Red?un, accounted for a good many, and the mules made a hobby of
planting one of those useless hooves of theirs in the ribs of any canine


that ventured near enough. A number, through not allowing for the
stickiness of the mud, were run over by wagons and guns, and had to
be destroyed, while on some rare occasions dogs suffered the spy?s fate,
and were shot at dawn.
Up in Belgium, any dog found near the front line was instantly
shot and searched, for the place was simply alive with enemy agents,
and their trained dogs slipped through the lines at night or early in
the morning with code messages fastened to their collars. Several
of these animals came under my notice, and they were all of the type
known as ?police dogs??fine, strong, intelligent brutes. They were
very difficult to bring down, and if only wounded would go for
their lives.
At the beginning of hostilities bulldogs seemed fashionable, but
one after another they died off. On the march they used to be led
solemnly at the head of the column, and their collars, now preserved in
the regiment?s archives, were often works of art. With some of the
English units lived regimental mascots that were worth a great deal
of money. Red setters and other sporting dogs, and even some
hounds, were seen, and they all appeared as proud of their units as
the boys were of their mascots.
But the dogs most favoured by the troops were the mongrels
which just attached themselves to the nearest body of men and were
adopted by them. One such dog joined an Australian Battalion as
soon as it reached France from Egypt. He was just a white ?tripe-
hound,? with a very distinctive black splash over one eye, but he
was faithful enough to stick with his unit through all its vicissitudes.
Badly wounded at the battle of Passchendaele, he was patched up by
the Regimental Medical Officer, and went down south with the troops
to take part in all the great fighting that ended in the Allied victory.
Just imagine what tales that pup could have told of his experi-


ences! The smuggling up to the line ?probably with some runner
pal with despatches ?the rush through the murk of shot and dust
and smoke when the advance was made; the digging-in, at which the
dog, now as grimy as his mates, probably took part, as most terriers
will. The whole Battalion had the greatest affection for him, and
when the time came to embark for England en route for home, every
effort was made to take the dog with them.
But it was no use. The ship?s surgeon put him out of all trouble
during the trip across the Channel. The ban on all animals was
necessary to protect their fellows in England and in the Dominions
from Continental diseases that they might have picked up, owing to
the impossibility of operating any animal quarantine in Europe.
To have shut all the pets up for the necessary period?eighteen
months, in some cases ?would have been utterly impossible, and there
are so many diseases that a person or animal may actually carry round,
without ill-effect to themselves, which will become virulent when they
find a suitable breeding-ground. This was the reason for the extremely
stringent regulations that a wise Veterinary Department insisted should
be followed.
Many of the pets were very sensibly given to the various French
friends of the troops, but they tried now and again to smuggle an
animal ashore, and some fierce rows took place about their ultimate
fate. The authorities, however, were adamant, and none landed.
Great rivalry existed between units over the intelligence and
accomplishments of their respective dogs. It was the amusement and
interest which they brought to the troops that prompted the ?powers
that be? to allow the animals to remain with the units in the field.
The folk in Belgium and northern France all have working-
dogs, which are as necessary for the conduct of their business as a
plough or a farm-cart. Though the sight of the beast working hard


for his tucker went against the grain of the British soldiers, yet there
were probably aspects that escaped notice. For instance, that working-
dog?s health was more important than that of Madame, the farmer?s
wife. A sore foot or loss of appetite on the part of Fido was a
catastrophe, and the pauvre chien was nursed and watched day and
night until he was better.
Many a farm-dog was surreptitiously let off his chain by well-
meaning new arrivals in Belgium, with the net result that the would-be
saviour was savagely bitten, and a miserable sort of pup wandered
round, wondering why he was loose at the wrong time.
A dog?s life in those parts is full of incident and excitement,
especially if Madame upsets the farmer and he take it out of Fido.
At dawn, Fido is released for his first job ?exercising the pigs. In the
centre of the backyard of every northern farm is a great pit, about
twenty feet square, five feet deep at the shallow end, and sloping
away to seven or eight. Into this brick or stone lined pit, every scrap
of rubbish, and the sweepings from the stables and cowsheds are tipped.
Once a year, with great labour and considerable smell, it is emptied,
and the contents carted to the fields for manuring the crops.
All the year round this is the pigs? exercise yard. In the grey
light of breaking day, they are driven into the mess, to root for an
hour or two, during which period Fido?s job is to keep them moving.
Madame, in the Intervals between her household jobs and the collec-
tion of the milk, shoos the dog on to keep the pigs up to their
?daily dozen.? Fido, nothing loath, sails into his charges, and
probably does to them all he would do to the farmer if he dared. He
certainly keeps them moving. Later on, the pigs are put back in their
sty, and Fido is given a good square meal to prepare him for his next
job?churning the cream for Madame!
Outside every kitchen wall is a great wheel, about eight feet


I L tel f life,
in diameter, and about two feet wide, with the spokes to the iron axle
fastened to the outside edges of the rim. It is made of wood, and
worn so smooth inside that little slats are often nailed here and there
to make toeholds. A small fence with a door in it goes as high as
the wheel spindle, fitting close up to the rim, and Fido is popped
into this enclosure, with instructions to ?Allez.?
If he does not, a piece of lighted paper dropped into the little
enclosure ensures a good gallop being worked up by the pup.
That is the way Fido churns. On hot days the poor old chap
does the last half-hour or so with yards of pink tongue hanging out, as
he gamely trots up that never-ending hill of wood. The clever way
the hound would start the business again, if he stopped to have a


scratch, always fascinated me. I am afraid I have stood by and watched
him do it, instead of lending him a hand by giving the wheel a spin.
With the stiffening cream in the churn, he would have to rock that
wheel backwards and forwards with his great body, until the moment
came to run a little way up the slope, and thus make the whole outfit
turn in the proper direction again.
But that does not finish the odd jobs of a farm-dog. When
Marie or Yvonne has washed the milking-gear and the churn, made
the butter into a decent pat, and undone the rags in her side-curls, she
or young brother gets out the ?billy-cart.? When all is packed and
ready, Fido?s chain is hitched on to the axle of the delivery depart-
ment, and round he goes to the customers in the nearby village with
butter, eggs, poultry, etc.
Although he is not expected to pull the whole load, he has to
do his share, or perhaps a bit more. Sometimes another dog is kept
for this work of delivery, especially if a milk-round is part of the
family operations, and then twice a day Henri takes his turnout on
the track, and collects firewood or grass on the return journey.
The dogs employed are all hefty, crossbred fellows, with muscle
development that it is a treat to watch, and, although savage watchdogs,
and generally dirty, unlovable creatures, they never seem to be ill-
treated like the horses and cattle, and they certainly are well fed.
An adjunct to the farm for many generations, the working-dog
is looked upon in the same light as Dobbin and Strawberry, and, while
his activities seem strange and rather cruel to the Britisher, actually he
is well housed, well cared for, and well exercised. And that cannot
be said of the pedigreed Poms and sulky Sealyhams that one sees
dragged through an unhappy and un-doggy existence, or carried, un-
comfortably cuddled, by English folk who ought to know better.
Some of those work-a-day dogs were collected and tamed by the
soldiers, many being found wounded and gassed in the ruined farms


that had been their homes. After the first rebelliousness against baths
and handling was overcome, they developed into fine pets, though
they were never so happy as when in their old position ?chained to
the axle under a wagon on the road. It was a job that suited their
huge bodies and great, clumsy, padded paws.
MISS
Pushing up after a withdrawal on a portion of the British Front, some
of our boys found a miniature Prince Charles spaniel crying in a high
fork of a tree by the roadside. Some fool had evidently taken it from
a girl in London or Paris, and brought the poor little thing into that
frightful war, leaving it to its fate when
the Hun made him scuttle to save his
own skin.
She was a pretty, perfectly useless
bundle of fur, with a ridiculous,
fluffy front end and tail, legs like
lead-pencils, and valueless feet
that had never carried her more
than a few feet in her life. Walk
she would not; she simply lay
down and howled to such an
extent that you wondered where
the sound supply was kept, for
there was scarcely enough room
for the works of an ordinary
wristlet watch in her tiny body.
Every one who attempted to handle her was promptly bitten by
little needles of teeth, but, as she had been badly blinded by ?mustard?


gas during the shelling, this was forgiven, and her eyes were bathed
with carbonate of soda. The men who found her were quite keen
on the little lady on account of her unique size, and they tried their
best to make friends. Two nights later one of them arrived at my
dugout, and, producing a bundle of dishevelled fur with unnaturally
bright eyes, asked me would I try and do something with her. She
was ?hunger-striking,? and had taken nothing to eat or drink since
she had been picked up, although they had tempted her with all sorts
of dainties.
Looking round for something in which to give her a drink of
water, I lighted on a tumbler, and, filling it nearly to the brim, offered
it to Miss, sitting demurely on my bunk. With a grateful flicker
of an eye, she daintily lapped up half the water, much to the man?s
astonishment. Meat and biscuit she refused from my hand, from
the floor, or from a saucer, but when I put the food in the tumbler
it was instantly gobbled up.
That was the trick of feeding Miss. I had stumbled on it
simply because there had been nothing else capable of holding water
in the dugout. She stayed with me for a little while, for we were
in good country, but when a home was found for her in one of the
cities in the rear we handed her over.
Poor little, useless, affectionate thing! She was the smallest dog
I have ever handled, for, although fully grown, she fitted comfort-
ably into an overcoat pocket.
Miss was well bred; her manners were perfect, and she was
surprisingly obedient for a pampered pup. To give you an idea of
her size, we often used the coil of her body to support an ashtray
as she lay asleep on the corner of a card-table during the long night
vigils. Fancy bringing a thing like that into the forward area! The
man who did it should have been shot!


THE TYKE
On the eve of going back to France after a spell in hospital, I fool-
ishly promised to take a new mascot across to a Scottish unit that had
had a casualty. Through this ?boy scout? act I was introduced to
a place that tickled me immensely, and which I never failed to visit
on subsequent trips to England.
It was a sort of dogs? garage,
or creche, where you parked your
pup while shopping in the big store
(to which it formed one of the
entrances), or dining in the restaur-
ant above. It was fitted up with
neat little shelves with larger
cubicles underneath them; nicely
polished, round rails, to which were
fastened the dogs? leads; clean,
brown water-dishes; clean mats;
and a nice shiny commissionaire
with a ?whangee? cane to look
after the visitors. Watching this
big chap in a grey uniform keeping
order amongst his charges, pacify-
ing some dame?s darling with a bit
of dog-biscuit, or giving it an imi-
tation bone made of rubber to chew; murmuring things that were
evidently not nice to some brute that insisted on putting up a howl, I
quite forgot the important business on hand.
I was brought back to earth when my friend at last succeeded


in persuading a large, fierce-looking, shaggy-coated beast to come out
of his corner and face the world and me. Now, although I had been
assured that he was ?as gentle as a lamb ?he?s only just a pup, you
know,? I treated that oversize lapdog with due respect, and wished
I could send myself a wire, putting my trip to France back, or even
forward, a day.
However, it was too late to get out of the contract with my
friend, so The Tyke had to be my bosom companion for a good many
hours in troop-train and transport, until I could deliver him to an
emissary of his new unit, who had ?wangled? a staff car to get down
and collect him at the French wharf.
?Bosom? companion was right, for when The Tyke had got over
his first antipathy, or shyness ?I have never decided from which he
suffered ?he flung himself, terrified, on my chest whenever any
strange noise occurred, such as a siren starting or a fog-signal explod-
ing on the rails. As we had a foggy train trip and a foggy crossing,
my chest got lots of work, and, because the hound kept on collecting
the damp air in his shaggy coat like a piece of blotting-paper, I must
have reeked of ?dog? from every pore by the time I reached Div-
isional Headquarters in the line.
I have often wondered what the General who owned the big
limousine really said when he smelled his nicely heated car next day.
A nice ?thank you? letter arrived from the Scottish mess, asking
for his name. I replied that the hound?s name was Egbert, but that
wasn?t what I called him personally.
THE DOGS THAT WENT TO SEA
A great many of His Majesty?s ships had dog pets, and some of them
were wonderfully clever. Once they got their sea-legs and learned to


dodge the waves that came on board, the life of a naval pup was
generally much longer than that of his soldier confrere.
The destroyers were the happy hunting-grounds of the ?web-
footed? hounds, because they had the run of the ship in a way that
was impossible on the stately battleships or up-to-the-minute cruisers.
The confined space on the T.B.D.?s makes every one kin, but, with that
subtle deference to rank peculiar to the British Navy, the captain?s
dog or the gunner?s cat knows its place, and lords it, or ?goes quiet,?
as required.
All the most disreputable cats seemed to join the Navy during
the war. Only now and then did you find a tabby with all its limbs,
ears, and tail aboard a warship. The cats of a liner are always patterns
of respectability, and those Navy fellows would never have been tol-
erated on such a ship.
One much-beloved cat was on a dirty, greasy destroyer which
was running the gauntlet of the mine-infested Channel with des-
patches, or convoying troops backwards and forwards daily. Just so
that the destroyer should not get rusty or anything, they used to scare-
up a submarine hunt whenever she was free. The result was that only
now and again the greyhound with sides that seemed as thin as jam-
tins, slipped inside the great boom of logs and over-grown fowlwire
which protected the destroyer base, to get her fuel and water. The
T.B.D. was no sooner in port than off she went again, but it was long
enough for Mrs Tabby to hold a regular tea-party on her ship. The
dockyard cats used to fly across the narrow gang-planks between the
legs of the hurrying sailors, and duck away down below to the warm
quarters to see their hostess.
Now the Captain?s boon companion was a Skye terrier with the


mournful expression of a tired cab-horse and three inches of hair
over his face. His eyes
seemed always on the
ground, and I am sure he
read his master?s thoughts
by the movements of his
feet, for at a single word of
command he was off like a
shot to do some job he had
been taught.
That pup would never
have dealings with anyone
but the captain, and any
attempt to handle him met
with a sharp defence, and
the fool who persisted was
properly bitten. After the
hostilities ceased, I saw more of Tim, and as a very special mark of
favour I have known him rest his chin on my boot while he lay on
the floor. But he paid no attention if I spoke to him.
To get back to Mrs Tabby?s tea-party: That collection of longshore
cats could, of course, not be tolerated on a T.8.D., so when all was
ready the captain would say to his shadow: ?We?re off, Tim,? and
then the fun would start. Although he had taken no notice of the
cats? arrivals, in the twinkling of an eye felines of various colours
and sizes, in various stages of excitement or resentment, but all in a
hurry, would speed across the gang-plank to the dock, and finally Tim
would come back to report ?All clear? to the skipper. How he
shifted those cats I do not know, for he did not bark; but when they
came on deck every puss had the ?wind up.?
Talking of cats, I do not remember seeing more than two or


three of the breed all the time we were in Northern France and
Belgium. Possibly they had all faded, cat-like, towards the seashore
and better tucker, but, though the southern ports were alive with them,
and Paris nearly as bad, none of the farm-houses or lesser cities seemed
to harbour them.
On one of the trawlers that operated with Tim?s destroyer?they
used to sweep backwards and forwards across the immediate path of
the troop and hospital-ships as they crossed the English Channel ?
was a queer, wee dog, with long, tousled brown hair. No two square
inches of it seemed to grow in the same direction, but, as she was
always scurrying round it did not really matter, for you were never
quite sure if the tousled coat was coming or going.
Her owner, the trawler?s skipper?in private life a commercial
traveller in Sydney?taught her to do the British Bulldog act, and
guard the flag. Anything more unlike the original picture you never
saw, but nobody dare touch that flag if Boomdy was looking after it.
Each evening the ensign was brought to the skipper?s tiny cabin,
and the untidy dog lay by the roll all night.
The trawler, the skipper, the flag, and the dog all came safely

through the horrors of war. The trawler went back to fishingj the
skipper is riding after sheep away out West; the flag is behind me as
I write, with the skipper?s autograph on it, and Boomdy?s teeth-marks
still quite plain on the wooden stop. And the dog herself? She was
handed over to a coastguard station, where she no doubt had a better
home than on a tiny trawler, even if it was H.M.T. No. 37.
KOBE
As become a Flotilla Leader ?the flagship of a group of destroyers?
the Channel Convoy Commander?s ship had a magnificent bulldog.
A perfect specimen, even though seven years of age, Kobe stood no
nonsense from anybody. The very way he ignored an animal or
person was an insult, but when he wanted anything, such as a comfort-
able cushion, he gently insinuated a very damp nose between the
possessor and the article he wanted, and, believe me, he generally had
a win straight off.
But if resistance was shown to his claim he applied shock tactics
with much skill. Sixty-three pounds of bulldog would follow the
damp nose, accompanied by a series of growls that rumbled all round
his interior. He would win hands down, though there was no record
of his having bitten anyone in his life.
Kobe was an expert at terrifying folk, and also, by the way, at
tearing the silk socks of certain individuals whom he disliked. He
had been taught to hold a man by the ankle when ordered, but, in
the case of people he didn?t care for, he would go up quite innocently
and gently take hold of a socked ankle. If the person moved, they
tore their own sock by hooking it on one of Kobe?s sharp tusks, but if


they kept still from fright the dog would manoeuvre a fang through
the sock with the same result.
Nobody ever made an attempt to hit Kobe ?his baleful eye just
looked them over, and they remembered another engagement. The
only thing I ever found that could look as ferocious as that dog is a
?devil? lizard that lives amongst the sandy scrub in parts of Australia.
This chap is a miniature dragon, with a skin all covered with knobs
and spikes. Where these leave off he has little rough, frilly bits
which he works up and down while he hisses.
Equally ferocious-looking, Kobe and the dragon lizard were
alike in other things ?they were all show', and made great pets. Some-
times the bushmen keep a dragon with them to drive away the flies
?their staple food ?and they will hang around a camp and learn
to come at a whistle. Like most Australian natives, with one or two
dangerous exceptions, the dragon lizard is quite harmless ?unless, of
course, you sit on him.
Kobe?s master was a naval officer, whose home was in Edinburgh,
but who had seen service all over the world. His wife had acquired
Kobe during his absence just before the war. On the Commander?s
return the dog, then at the height of his fame, and carrying off prize
after prize at the dog-shows, calmly attached himself to his master,
and refused to leave him. Mrs Naval Officer, rather huffed at the
loss of her faithful attendant, said it was only the uniform that did
it, but she let him go aboard the ship and stay there.
All through the long, cold winters and boisterous summers of
the North Sea, Kobe lived in the confined space of the dancing des-
troyer, and it was small wonder that he looked upon the far corner
of the settee in the captain?s cabin as his, because he could jamb his
great body in the angle of the wardrobe and the wall, and be fairly
safe when the cockle of a boat stood on her head.
On his first trip to sea, the old chap was fearfully sick ?just


imagine a seasick bulldog, if you can! His funny old wrinkled black
face could not look green like yours or mine, but they said he sat
hard against a ventilator near the forward torpedo-tubes, and the tears
simply streamed down his cheeks. That is a peculiarity shared by
bulldogs and pekes; they can cry like human beings ?and at the right
times, too.
Next time out, he got his sea-legs, and proceeded to make his
presence felt. Going ?top-side? with the Commander one day, he
soon had enough of the breezes of the bridge, and returned to the
cabin, to find the ship?s cat curled up in the warm indentation he had
left in the cushion provided for him by a thoughtful mistress. She
knew how bulldogs suffer from the cold owing to their fine, thin skin
and light coat.
Kobe?s rage knew no bounds. After one or two ineffectual
smacks with her paw, the cat realized her position, and fled to the
deck, finally taking refuge in a well-thought-out ?funkhole? under
the big capstan frame, right up near the bows. But that cat reckoned
without the sleepy bulldog?s tenacity, and there she had to stop for
thirty-four hours, while Kobe lay in the narrow space between the
anchor chains and growled every time puss made a movement. They
tried everything, even to starting the electric capstan over the cat, but
Kobe held his ground. Nobody dared to shift the dog, for his master
did not know him very well yet, and bulldogs are not things to
handle roughly.
By the way, that bulldog grip is not a fairy-tale, for I have had
to prize a bulldog off a horse. The best way is to slip a good, hard
stone into his mouth, and use it to lever the lower jaw into place, the
stone acting as the fulcrum. What actually happens is that the dog?s
jaw dislocates, and it is impossible for him to let go, even if he wants
to do so. The stone method is rather a sound one for another reason


?getting rid of it gives him something to think about besides yourself
when he is free again.
They were frightened to use a fire hose on the two animals in
case they were washed overboard, but after thirty-four hours in the
whizzing spume of the North Sea, the persuasive smell of a dish of
tucker, pushed cautiously into his vicinity, proved too much for Kobe,
and he retired ponderously to the captain?s cabin again, while a
draggled, hungry cat streaked for the cook?s galley.
Shortly after the Armistice, Kobe?s destroyer came to the base
near our camp, and the Commander was my constant guest when I
was not curled up on the settee by Kobe. The old dog knew that his
master and I were close friends, and would smile all over his ugly
face when I arrived on board. Very damp, friendly slobbers would
be my greeting, and when we settled down with our pipes about one-
half of that sixty pounds of bulldog would be resting most affection-
ately again my ribs.
Noticing that Kobe was constantly licking his paws, I had a look
between the claws, and found a sad state of affairs. The constant
walking on the hard wood-and-iron decks had caused big sores, like
soft corns, to grow, and the poor old fellow must have been in agony.
Suggesting to the Commander that a holiday ashore was the
treatment, I rashly offered to take the big pup back with me to my
quarters in barracks. The naval man laughed, and said: ?Certainly,
but he won t go.? On my inviting Kobe to come home with me, he
cocked one eye at his master, and, receiving the ?Go? from him,
walked solemnly across the gangway and up the hill to the fort without
a murmur.
By the time the front door was shut I was rather regretting my
hasty action. To begin with, a wash was indicated, for a greasy des-
troyer is very different from quarters ashore, and Kobe was, to say


the least of it, ?niffy.? Into a hot bath he went, and took it like a
lamb, while I soaped and rubbed him dry, with a nasty feeling inside
me every time he yawned.
Then the paws had to be dressed with powder that had a sting
in it. I managed to get them all done before the pain started, and
then Kobe sat up howling, and rolled big red eyes at me, as if to say;
?And I trusted you.?
Next day my batman, who never let any animal beat him, said
he would bathe and dress the sores. He got on splendidly with Kobe
until he produced the powder-tin!
Then he came out of the room in a hurry. He was still white-
faced when he found me, and said; ?That blooming dog fairly
chucked me out.?
Going along to the rebel, Kobe and I came to an understanding,
with the help of a riding-whip and a straight left to the jaw, and
the paws were dressed. After that the Kobe temper had no terrors for
me; in fact, I took the Commander?s place until, some six weeks later,
I passed him back, sleek and bright, and with cool pads on his big feet.
Those six weeks were full of adventure, not only for Kobe, but
also for me. The first troubles were due to the fact that the bulldog
possessed an uncanny knowledge of uniforms. The navy, of course,
came first. He tolerated the army and police, and the plain blue of
the barrack warden and artificers, but when some American naval
officers and ratings paid us a visit very awkward scenes occurred with
the rather touchy U.S.A. navy. Later, when the Japanese squadron
that served with the Atlantic Fleet put in for a few days, Kobe, in
spite of his Japanese name, put three small, brown officers into a
corner, and held them there until one of our chaps came and hauled
him off.
One morning soon after that, the big bulldog was very proudly


taking a constitutional down in the village. He was on the end of
a leather lead held by a pretty naval V.A.D, girl, when he sighted
two Jap. sailors on the sidewalk, and promptly put them into a small
general store, to the consternation of the shopkeeper and his customers.
The V.A.D. seemed to be glued to the lead, and arrived in the same
rush as the dog, but she could not control him. A telephone message
brought a rescuer, and a growling Kobe, slobbering worse than ever
in his excitement, tried to tell me that
time.
he was sure he was right that
Another queer twist of
his doggy brain made him go
nearly mad if he saw any
person, sailor or not, carrying
a ladder. One day he came
upon a German prisoner cart-
ing a set of steps and a bundle
of brooms into one of the
buildings to sweep the chim-
neys, and the combination of
the uniform and the ladder
proved too much for the truc-
ulent one. The yells of Fritz
brought the guard at the
double, but Kobe would not
let go his hold of the unfor-
tunate man?s ankle until I
came on the scene. The dog
had held him firmly, but gently, and the skin of his leg was unbroken.
In the big camp theatre, where seven hundred men could be
comfortably seated, some concert party would give a show at least
once each week. It was Kobe?s delight to sit on a piece of my chair


(which meant I had very little), and take an interest in the items.
During a song he would have his head first on one side and then
on the other, listening, but a violin made him sit up straight and puff
his cheeks out while he glared at the innocent fiddler.
Conjurers puzzled him terribly. He would look round at me with
a worried frown on his expressive face when things that he was sure
he saw right in front of him disappeared magically.
All went well at the concerts until one party put on a very melo-
dramatic play. When the villain grabbed the heroine Kobe came to
life with a quick growl, and I had just time to get a grip on his big,
studded collar as he shot over my knees in a rush to the stage. The
next few minutes were full of action ?Kobe?s action ?as he galloped
on my poor knees and made nearly as much row as the cheering boys,
who thought the pup?s intervention funnier than the spoilt play.
Kobe was so excited and upset when we got home that I let him
bring his bed ?an old pair of riding-breeches ?into my room. The
beggar dreamed of melodrama all night long, biting huge hunks of
atmosphere now and again in the vain belief that he was chewing pieces
of villain. We censored his programmes after that episode, and sent
him out or left him at home when plays were on the bill.
When snow was deep on the tracks, Kobe simply refused to leave
the fireside. He would drag his beloved pants right up to the fender
as if about to settle down ?and then climb into a big, padded cane-
chair, with a cautious glance round to see if anybody objected.
Coal was very scarce in those days, and two scuttles were kept
by the fireplace, one with big lumps and the other full of coal-dust, to
spin out the ration. If we were away in the evening it was the job
of the boy on duty to keep the lounge fire banked-up against our
return. After one experience of this banking-up process with the fine
dust, which gave little heat, Kobe put the man out of the room the


minute he picked up the scuttle of fine coal, although he had not
interfered when the big stuff was put on. He would not let that chap
go in again, and when we got back we found a shivering man in the
corridor and the fire nearly out.
Another night, Kobe was forgotten when we all went to bed.
When the lounge fire went out and he became freezing cold he knew
what to do. He just sat up, turned round, and tore the padding out
of the back of the chair, making a nest for himself in the kapok. In
the morning the room was fluff from one end to the other, and the
chair had to be completely re-backed. I have often wondered how
he knew that the kapok was there, and why he did not first tear up
the seat, the natural thing for a dog to do.
On the return of the Commander?s ship to Edinburgh, Kobe was
passed back to his mistress, and promptly pressed into service as a
collector for naval charities. With a little Union Jack as a saddle-
cloth, and a collecting-box with a story on it as saddle, he was led
round the city for a week or so. After he had been dressed-up one
day he trotted off on his own and came back with a full box, to be
received by a proud mistress, who did not rest until she sat down and
wrote to me to tell of the latest exploit of the clever Kobe.
Thus it became a regular stunt for the big brindle bulldog to go
collecting down Prince?s Street, where he would stroll up to a person,
with a ?stand-and-deliver? expression. If the box got a coin the donor
was allowed one pat. When last I heard of Kobe he had collected
over ï¿½3OO for charity.
Yale, Kobe!


PIGEON PALS
SEARCHING for a reserve position on a well-timbered ridge
some distance behind the lines, we came upon a patch of scrub
about a quarter of a mile long, on the Paris side of the hill.
As heavy scrub is such a rare thing in that land, where even the smallest
stick is retrieved for firewood, we went over to examine it more closely.
Pushing through the undergrowth, we came on a clearing, and I,
for one, rubbed my eyes. There, right in the fighting-zone, was a
typical gipsy encampment, such as one sees in the country in England.
The usual caravan was there, gaudily painted, with the steps at the
back and the shafts pointing up to heaven in the front, showing a
recent coating of red. Over on the far side of the clearing was an old,
grey horse, and, by a little wisp of fire behind some cases, you could
see the head of a man with a real gipsy cap on it, made of tweed, with
big ear-pieces tied over the crown.
What on earth was this outfit doing on the British front in
France? While we stood wondering, a great flow of pure ?or, rather,
impure?English reached us, followed by an equally lurid answer in
a most ungipsy-like Irish brogue, which came from some individual
the other side of the fire.
Rather relieved, we walked over to the caravan, and found that
we had stumbled upon a unit of the Carrier-pigeon Service, which
was attached to our corps. The old sergeant in charge ?he of the
ear-flapped cap ?looked rather like a dilapidated nonconformist par-
son, although his language did not exactly fit that role.


His mate was lying on his back in the sun, cap over his eyes and
arms outstretched on the grass. He was holding forth about generals,
armies, wars, and, lastly, carrier-pigeons. Evidently a disgruntled
philosopher, he was ?ag?in? everyone and everything?except beer, in
which he proposed to bathe when the war was over. His expression,
when something in the strained silence of the old sergeant made him
shift his cap from his eyes, and he saw us standing there, was very
amusing. \ou could almost hear him thinking what he had been
saying, and wondering how much we had heard.


A cheery word or two, and an inquiry as to the ?how and why?
of army pigeon-keeping, let loose such a flood of pigeon-lore that w'e
were nearly overwhelmed. We learned all about the wonders of
little ?Nancy,? who had just come out of her fifth battle with some-
thing like a pigeon record for speed; how ?Prince? had never been
the same since the hawk caught him near Clairmaris Wood; how
?Legs-Eleven? had been nearly drowned with his mate when the
despatch-rider had skidded on a bad road, and the machine, with the
birds strapped on to the carrier, had dived into a big shell-hole full
of water. And lots more. . . .
The adventures some of those birds had lived through! I wish
now that I had been able to note something of the fellow?s stories,
but, at that time, the only thing I thought about writing was my will.
The caravan was the genuine gipsy article, reconstructed to suit
its new occupants. The sides were hinged at the top, and could be
propped up to reveal neat rows of pigeon-boxes, each fitted with a
small wire door for isolating the birds if necessary. Through the old
caravan entrance at the rear, the keepers could get into a narrow
passage between the boxes for inspection and capture of the inmates.
In this space, feed, cages, etc., travelled when the queer unit
went on the road. The original roof-ventilators had been enlarged,
and fitted with landings for the returning messengers, who automati-
cally rang a bell as they entered ?a pigeon Bundy-clock, as it were.
Every army carrier-pigeon had its regimental number, just like the
soldiers, and from long association they all knew their home, which
was rarely moved, so as to preserve the efficiency of the pigeon messen-
gers. Should a bird get into another travelling loft, it was quickly
identified by reference to the Army Pigeon Register, and returned.
The special little paper message-forms and the tubes for attach-
ing to the pigeons were supplied with the birds, and schools were held


regularly to enable officers to become familiar with the handling of
the birds and the despatch of messages. When a despatch-rider
arrived at a unit in the line with the extra cages of pigeons, the worst
fears of the troops were realized, and they knew at once that a battle
was in the immediate future.
In the latter part of the war pigeons were always kept at head-
quarters for use in emergency. They were changed very frequently,
the duty birds being released to fly back for exercise and practice as
soon as their relief arrived. Times of release and arrival were care-
fully noted, and entered in the bird?s service record for the purpose of
culling the inefficient or untrustworthy messengers.
The pigeon-
service men made
quite a fuss of their
charges, and took
great pride in pick-
ing out the best and
fastest birds for any
big stunts. They
were used to get in-
formation back to
the General Staff
during an advance,
when no telephone-
line would live and
it was terribly diffi-
cult for a man to get through the terrific barrage that the enemy
always put down to prevent the arrival of reinforcements.
The pigeons were carried in flat cages of wood and split cane,
very lightly but strongly built. They were rather like the little cages


in which the Chinese boy keeps his praying-mantis. In China most
schoolboys keep these insects, and match one against the other in
mortal combat. There are no half-measures about the fight, for the
victor nearly always eats the vanquished.
Very strict orders had to be issued to prevent the soldiers from
interfering with, or feeding, the carrier-pigeons. In the case of a
young bird a little kindness might prove fatal, as he would want to
stay with his new friend instead of getting on with his job and flying
home.
Many of the pigeons had great adventures, especially the Secret
Service birds. Taken over the enemy?s lines at night by intrepid
airmen, and carried in special cages with parachute attachments, they
were dropped at pre-arranged spots for our agents in enemy territory
to communicate with our Headquarters.
If the agent was lucky enough to get hold of his birds without
being observed, a wonderful lot of information, already prepared in a
secret code, could be immediately forwarded on the swift-flying
pigeon.
Whenever a secret agent was taken into the enemy territory by
aeroplane he always took some pigeons with him, if it was at all pos-
sible. The cooing of the birds was a great danger, for, at that time,
anyone found with carrier-pigeons was suspect. Of course, they could
not keep the birds for many days, because the homing instinct does
not always remain for long, especially in areas that are subject to much
bombardment.
When we first went to Europe there were thousands of pigeons
in Belgium, but one day the French Secret Service caught a farmer,
who lived near the border, sending away a pigeon with information
about the concentration of our guns. Prompt and efficient action was
taken, in conjunction with the Belgian authorities, with the result that


every pigeon in the sector was impounded and destroyed, while any
person found with one on his premises after that was locked up as a
spy. They had a short, sharp way of dealing with such gentry in
Europe.
Pigeon-pie was the order of the day in all the French official
quarters after the slaughter, for, though the loss of pigeon life was
heavy, the frugal Frenchman wastes nothing.

GUN-TEAMS
Down with the Infantry?nobody cares,
Down with the Cavalry?Colonel he swears,
But down with the guns, with the wheelers at flog,
Turns the bold Bombardier to a little whipped dog.
Kipling.
JUST horses in a gun-team ?but living, breathing, thinking units
which time and time again meant the difference between defeat
and victory for the King?s armies.
No wonder the drivers loved their horses, or that the horses
depended on their soldier comrades, for together they worked as a
machine, and, if one cog failed in the combination, it spelled disaster.
Thundering along in the rear of the team is a limber full of ammuni-
tion, followed by a great gun and mounting, the whole concern without
brakes that can be quickly applied 5 a second late in gathering up the
reins on the part of a driver when an animal stumbles will put the
limber and gun over the fallen, as sure as fate.
So you see, a quick hand and a sharp eye are required of an
artillery driver, while a gun horse must be nimble, sure-footed, and


quick to respond to the directions of rein and whip ?that funny, cheap-
looking fourteen inches of stick with a lash nailed to it that seems
so out of place amongst the well-finished harness and equipment.
To the outside horse that whip is guide, comforter, and enemy.
The way the driver touches his neck tells him exactly what is required
of him, while a frightened, nervous animal will be gathered up close
to its mate, and edged past some alarming object by the comforting
feel of that lump of wood in his master?s hand. Again, the clearing
of the lash, usually coiled in the driver?s hand, will be instantly
noticed, and the horse will hop into the breast-collar like a shot.
The wheel-horses, which control the limber and gun by means of
the pole, are the only ones that may be flogged, except during training,
when a long whip is used by an N.C.0., and not by the driver. If
the lead or centre horses were struck by the man riding, the pair
behind would jerk back, and cause an accident. A sharp crack on the
neck with the whip-handle will make the forward pairs behave.
Do you know why military horses always look so intelligent?
It is because they never wear winkers?those queer appendages
which are a legacy from the days of knights in armour. Why we
use them in private life, goodness only knows, for they are not at
all necessary, except in special cases. There was a time, before the
war, when artillery horses were hired for training purposes. In the
lead of a gun-team I have driven, with head-bridle only, a pair that
only a few hours before had been pulling wool-wagons to the ships,
winkered up to the ears. With open vision, and no special teaching,
those horses would go quietly through the city crowds and mingle
with trams, buses, and cars, enjoying the freedom.
Then French and Belgian horses either wear enormous winkers
with brass or silver ornaments and knobs ?still closer in imitation of
the knight?s war-horse ?or they have a very light plaited headgear,

so fine that at a distance there seemed to be nothing at all supporting
the cruel French bits.
The First Australian Division was horsed with Walers ?the
locally bred horse ?
and they had such
extraordinary stam-
ina that many hun-
dreds of the original
remounts finished
up worth four to
five times as much
as their cost. One
unit, that started in
1914 with eighty
horses, had between
thirty and forty of
the originals left at
the time of the
Armistice, although
nearly eight hun-
dred horses had
passed through its books.
The wonderful care that the drivers bestowed on their horse
pets accounted in a great measure for this excellent result, and the
sympathetic regard of the Australian veterinary officers for the affec-
tion that existed between men and horses played no small part. Rather
than send to hospital a horse of which a driver was very fond, the
Veterinary Officer would make many journeys to assist him to nurse
his charge, and dress its wounds in conjunction with the veterinary
sergeant.


Talking to one of our old Veterinary Officers recently, I was
astonished to find that he remembered favourite horses of mine, and
could even tell me the drivers? names, and where they ran in the teams,
although he must have had many thousands of horses to look after
in the war. Such individual interest could only come from regard
for his charges and their attendants, added to the knowledge that they
were Walers, and therefore very valuable to any unit.
Somehow, you could not get up the same enthusiasm for the
lanky, badly ribbed-up, American and Argentine horses, with bad,
soft feet and loose tails.
To be well-built, or ribbed-up, it should only be possible to place
the breadth of your palm in between the hip and the first rib of a
horse. We had some Argentine horses that would take both your
palms side by side, and their early evacuation owing to breakdown
or strain proved the value of the old test.
We got a sprinkling of good English remounts ?nice, easily
worked, docile beasts because of their early handling as foals and in
youth, wffien the overseas animal is out on the plains or roaming the
mountains. The men made great pets of those horses, and they were
much sought after to replace any casualties.
The horses of a well looked after unit are always sweet, fresh,
and clean all over, and the drivers pride themselves on the cleansing
and grooming of their teams. The troopers of the cavalry and light
horse, who practically lived with their mounts, looked after the fine
points as much for their own personal comfort as for that of their
horses. With the good, clean food, and the attention to mouth, teeth,
nose, eyes, and ears that every animal received, any offensiveness was
a sure sign of sickness.
The sight and smell of the majority of horses one comes in con-
tact w r ith in civil life are anything but pleasant, and, besides the cruelty


The artillery driver does the best he can for his wounded pal.


to the horse, the foolish owners seem to forget that much more and
better work is always given by a contented animal?which means a
clean one.
In his natural state a horse cleans himself thoroughly by rolling
in sand and grass, and by forcing his way through bushes, but a cobbled
stable-yard and some churned-up mire in a yard are no good for his
purpose, and it is left to his human taskmaster to make up the
deficiency.
The drivers became so much attached to their four-footed com-
rades-in-arms that to harm one of them was like harming a human pal.
I have seen one of the hardest, toughest cases we had sit down
m the mud by a dying horse, and, holding its head in his lap, bathe
its eyes with what passed for his own handkerchief, swearing to avenge
the death of the nag, while tears that he never knew he possessed
rolled down his cheeks.
Later, when so many gunners became casualties, and the drivers
were pressed into service, he was the first to volunteer for a front-
line job with an observing party. I understood his reason. They
said he was quite mad until he had emptied two clips of cartridges
at the enemy trenches, and then he seemed satisfied. For bringing
back an important despatch through the barrage in the battle which
followed at dawn, that driver got the Military Medal, but he always
says it was his old horse who won it.
One man I knew walked ten miles every night for a fortnight
to get some special grass from another district for his sick horse, and,
when he was detailed for duty, sympathetic mates did his shift, to
let him get away for his horse-medicine.
In an Australian battery was a great pair of Waler mares, which
the sergeant-major and their driver declared would pull ?anything
out of anywhere,? and, from what I saw them do on occasions, I almost


agreed. A pretty pair of low, stocky bays, each with a white star on
the forehead; sleek, round-barrelled body; good, well put on legs,
short neck; deep chest, and perfect manners, they were a picture in
their well-kept harness, and the driver was justly proud of them.
From 1914 he drove them right up to within a few weeks of the end
of the war, when he went to hospital badly wounded.
What adventures the three inseparables had in those years!
They were alw r ays happy at their w T ork. Let a gun get stuck, or an
ammunition-wagon be held up by jibbing mules, and presently The
Beauties,? as they were called, would be smartly trotted up by Driver
Banks, who, from long experience, quickly decided where to apply his
precious horse-power. The Beauties also used to look the proposition
over with quite professional eyes, and when the job was done they
would stroll sleepily home, as horses do when their work is finished,
although it might be only eight o?clock in the morning.
Those mares had been trained to move at the word of command,
straight forward or backward, to the right or left, or to step directly
sideways , in order to facilitate hooking-in at awkward angles, or taking
a ?skew? pull out of some rut.
Driver Banks used to put on his show with the same licking of lips
as a circus ringmaster producing his great act. Sometimes he worked
a straight-ahead pull by hooking-on in front; sometimes he took a
heave directly on the drag-ropes hooked to the axle-rings; sometimes
he put just his pair in the wheelers? place, with the whole gun- or
wagon-team removed; but one way or the other that clever trio always
won by skilful application of power.
The ability of The Beauties to drill at the word of command
saved Driver Banks?s life in the winter of 1916, on the terrible Tiers
sector.
Owing to their usefulness, the trio only had to take its turn in
routine work when occasion demanded, but in that time of stress the


driver and his beauties gave of their best. All the ammunition had
to be taken to the guns on the horses? backs, in canvas carriers with
pockets on each side. Single horses could scarcely get over the country,
let alone wagons, but the hungry guns were fed, thanks to the drivers
and their pets.
Up that frozen or slimy track, according to the weather, went
strings of animals and tramping men, all hands falling on the frozen,
shell-torn ground, or slipping in the slime. Time and time again the
columns had to stop to pull a man or horse out of the water-filled
shell-holes, by the simple method of a rope hitched round them,
pulled by men or horses as required.
One night Driver Banks, bringing up the tail of a convoy, missed
his column in that awful waste, where no man?s cry had any likelihood
of being heard, and, seeking for the track-marks, he fell into a shell-
hole, where he stuck fast. For a second or two he struggled, and then
remembered what happens to one who does that in the mud. He
called to his pets: ?Here, Daisy; here, Bell!? and then; ?O?er left,
Daisy, over left} back, girl, back!? And the faithful mare, with a
frightened eye on the water-filled hole, manoeuvred to her master?s
command until he could grasp her tail firmly. Any sudden move-
ment would have killed the driver, or made him lose his grip, but
The Beauty, trained in using her strength pound by pound, slowly
shifted forward, and out came Driver Banks!


1RAN|^^^^SES
Big, hefty fellows, those transport horses, but cheery, willing workers,
and absolutely the backbone of the army. Our food and fuel, the
tucker for their more lively fellows in the cavalry and artillery, the
road material that made it possible for us to exist, the great wood
sleepers that formed the floating roadways across the swamps ?all
this was carried by them with the precision of a railway. Through hail
of shells and banks of gas, under concentrated bomb attacks, those
cheerful horses and their equally cheerful, hardcase drivers, brought
up the supplies.
? ?B? wagon has gone, sir, and ?QV team has been wiped out,?
was the sort of report that the O.C. Transport would get. Back would
come the query: ?Who?s next for duty?? and it would most probably
be found that ?next for duty? was already half hooked in to go out
with his beloved horses, possibly to death.
The love of the horses for their masters made the most pro-
digious tasks possible, because they gave their great strength willingly
when asked by the drivers. Often a wagon arrived safely at newly
located lines with the driver lying wounded, or even dead, on the
footboard. The affection those transport horses had for their team-


mates was remarkable, and they would fret and go off their feed if
separated. Sitting behind them, you would see one look at the other
as they came to a stiff hill, as if the words were passed: ?Well, what
about it, old feller??
They belonged to the Army Service Corps, and no unit was better
named, for service they gave ?twenty-four hours every day.
WATER-CART WARRIORS
The water-cart horse was, like his driver, always a character. The
heavens might fall, but those two would manage to get up to the
battery, along a track that, in the black darkness, would have defeated
a cat. In one position alone I signed requisitions for three new water-
carts to replace those damaged by shell-fire. The horse and driver
always escaped, and, somehow, they managed to salvage the harness.
?Denny the Driver,? and ?Tiger,? the horse, were never far apart,
and Denny never talked about himself alone. It was: ?As Tiger and
me was cornin? by the railway dump . . .? or: ?Yes, sarge, me and
Tiger?ll pick it up as we comes back from the tank.? I really think
that if you had called Tiger he would have looked round to ask Denny
if he might go.
Tiger was a type that it always paid to get when remounts were
being selected. Classed as a ?medium heavy,? he was a blue roan,
vith very black points, a combination that showed outstanding stamina
in the French winters.
Denny the Driver came from way back in the Never-Never
country. He could just about write his name by making the letters
in the air with the tip of his tongue as he wielded the pen. One day


he received a letter from home containing the news that a favourite
sister in Australia had a baby son. Such important information had
to be broadcast, and, when he told me, I said a letter was necessary
from the new uncle.
A day or two later,
Denny sidled into my dug-out,
and, frankly spreading him-
self across the box supporting
my maps, said: ?What about
that letter, sir? That blinking
Tiger ?as trod on me fingers.?
Knowing what his trouble
was, I got paper and pen, and
took a most surprising letter
from Denny?s dictation. He
wrote to the two-months-old
baby, using the name pro-
posed in the letter from home,
telling it all about the war,
and spinning yarns about ?me
and Tiger? suitable for a lad
Denny the Driver
of sixteen. I only hope the mother kept the screed to read to the
nip when it could understand things.
The irrepressible finished his stories, and said with a grin: ?See
what I?ve saved you, sir! Now you won?t have to censor that for the
post? ?without thinking that the writing of the missive was much
harder than the reading would have been. Anyhow, ?me and Tiger?
took the precious envelope w r ith the censor stamp on it down to the
wagon-lines, and duly posted it together at railhead next morning.


' ' * The Old Deems
Great big lumbering old dears, with whiskers on their insteps?but
couldn?t they pull! The sixty-pounder guns used them, and some of
the Engineer Pontoon Sections, but the mild-eyed ?hairies? will always
be remembered for their handling of the heavy guns before the advent
of the Mechanical Transport. The Motor Section used to do some
of the hauling, but until the advent of the tractors they were useless
in the mud, and there the ?hairies? shone.
Magnificent animals that ate enormous meals and would plant
a great, flat foot on your toes, looking round with slumbering, kind
eyes to see what was patting them when you punched your very
hardest at a shoulder of cast-iron to get the weight shifted.
They had brute force written all over them, and the muscles
rippled as they drew their huge loads a long way in a long time. In
the springtime they were unconscious clowns as they pranced about
in the paddocks, with all the grace of young elephants.
Every ?hairy? was a pet in its unit, and always beautifully kept,
but no matter how much military gear you hung on them, or tied
on behind, they seemed lonely without the barrels of the brewers?
wagon following their stumpy tails.


THE COOKS?-CART HORSE
?We?ll send the cooks?-cart for it, sar?-major!?
How often that was said in those days! Over the paved roads
to Ordnance, or up on the wettest night with rations to the men in the
line, where there were no roads, went that useful vehicle, the cooks -
cart. Many, indeed, were the duties of the hardcase driver, the hard-
case horse, and the hardcase cart. Doubtful jobs, such as ?souveniring?
horse-feed, and the like, were entrusted to this turn-out, sometimes
by themselves, but generally accompanied by an N.C.O. with a gift
of tongues, who was equal to holding in conversation any inquisitive
persons while the shrewd cooks?-cart driver lost himself.
The queer vehicle seemed to have been built for ?souveniring,?
because, even when riding a horse, it was impossible to look right
inside the contraption. It was a cross between a large Roman chariot
and an English governess-cart. The side and front were like those of
the chariot, and it had the bent axle of the governess-cart, which


allowed the easy loading of heavy weights with a minimum of men ?
a very big consideration where a crowd would attract attention.
Careful selection was necessary before appointing either the
driver or the horse of the cooks?-cart. They had to be tough, brave,
dependable, impossible to rattle with any strange happening, and
possessing one big idea onIy? DUTY. The specification fitted both
man and horse, and together they spent their whole existence, being
rarely off the roads except to snatch some food and sleep. Get the
mail; get the boots for the quartermaster; get some medical stores;
bring up those gun parts ... the orders would have worried any but
the cooks?-cart team, but, wonderful to relate, they always seemed to
be completed in time to get away after dark with the rations and mail
for the boys up above. Driver and horse ran the gauntlet of the
shells going and coming each night, for the Fritz knew that the cooks?-
carts went up ?his did too.
Many stories are told of the cooks?-cart horse bringing an empty
vehicle back to the lines, or carting a badly wounded driver home,
having stolidly ignored the shells and picked his way carefully among
the new holes in the road. The driver and his old horse shared one
of the loneliest and most dangerous jobs, but, though few got through
unhurt, the tally of killed was remarkably light.


OUT in the Western District of Victoria, in the Commonwealth
of Australia, a bright-eyed little ?joey? kangaroo looked out
on a world already beginning to glint in the sunrise. Leaning
contentedly on his forepaws resting on the edge of his mother?s pouch,
he dreamed away of the nothings which fill the minds of all baby
things, his well-nourished little body snuggled luxuriously against the
warm skin of his parent.
Mother Roo w r as finishing a careful toilet after the delightful
grazing that a wet season had given her and was contemplating the
same service for her joey, as she scraped and scratched at her powerful
tail from the broad butt to the tip. Out came Joey, with a maternal
disregard for his feeble attempts to dodge Ma?s efficient paw, and
over he went full length on his tummy. She scratched and nuzzled
his ears, head, and neck, swinging him over to do his chin and nether

over the watercourses when he grows up.


portions and then back again to do the length of his body to the end
of his miniature tail.
Satisfied that the baby was well and truly groomed, Ma gave
a last close scrutiny to the landscape and, setting her back against
a great grey-brown rock that nearly matched her coat and which
provided ample safeguard from any rear-attack, stretched herself
out in the sun for a snooze.
Ever seen a big cat lie on its side in the sun? It seems about as
thick as a paling and that is how a big kangaroo looks when stretched
flat ?all skin and nothing inside.
Joey whimpered and tried to crawl into his sleeping-bag but
Ma was having none of that} she knew that the sun made vitamins
in babies? bodies, so out in the early morning rays he had to stay dis-
gustedly for a time. Sitting up and folding his paws like a little old
lady, he imitated Mother Roo when she was frightened, wriggling
his snout this way and that, the long whiskers waving in the breeze.
He found a round pebble and played with it for a while} then it
rolled away and he tried to get it but Ma?s forearm shot out and
back he was hauled, his ears being gently boxed as punishment. Then
he was content to stretch out in the sun and, in the crook of Mother
Roo?s arm, slept like a tired child until the heat of the summer day
sent all the animals to the shelter of the nearby scrub.
In amongst the low trees and rocks they settled down, all looking
so like their surroundings it was only when a kangaroo sat half-up
to scratch a fly away or make a hit at another fellow who had come too
close, that one realized the place was occupied. On the edge of the
slope facing the grazing grounds and by the dip that led to the creek
were posted smart young sentries, who nibbled peacefully along the
base of the rocks and turned over the bark and debris at the tree roots
for dainties.


One old-man kangaroo lay at a point of vantage in the shade,
his eyes half-closed and the absurdly human eyelashes sweeping his
cheeks. Close by was a dainty little grey lady with sharp ears and
nicely marked limbs, who watched her lord and master continuously
for she knew from long and painful training that she must be ready
to move the instant he shifted position.
Mother Roo and Joey were at a little distance from the main
group w r ith other family parties, for the kangaroo parents are very
jealous of their babies. Joey, fed and content, was curled up in her
pouch and everything seemed quiet and safe in that patch where the
big flies droned and even the birds were lazy. Little did Joey realize
that this was his ?big day? and that soon his very own picture on
great grey and green lorries was to travel the length and breadth of
the British Front in France, whilst his fame was to be a never-ending
source of delight to innumerable soldiers years and years after the
war ended?yet all that happened.
Through his half-closed eyes Old Man Roo saw one of the
sentries stirring uneasily. He was alert in an instant and with a sweep
of his huge tail moved off in exactly the opposite direction, all the
kangaroos following as if at a word of command. Then the cause of
the fright was spied DOGS! and then a cloud of dust that spread
across the run ?HORSES!
When the Old Man swung his followers to the left over the
open space that led to the scrub and boulder-strewn rise, the sentries
were lined up nearly abreast of him with Little Grey Lady just
behind. The chance to get away seemed good until up out of the
creek-bed came more men and horses with fresh dogs. This crowd
turned the kangaroos from the hill country and finally drove them
into an angle formed by two wire fences where they were almost cut
off. The young agile ones escaped down the fence but the older ones,


including Mother Roo who had been panting along carrying the heavy
Joey, were quickly surrounded by men and women riders. Old Man
Roo, his back against a fence-post, was gamely facing three not over-
anxious dogs when, to his great astonishment, they were called off
and he was driven away with a stockwhip.
Mother Roo was in a most undignified position for one of the
station- hands was holding her firmly by the tail and every time she
showed fight, down went her nose in the dust!
A big man, who was evidently in charge, called out: ?Don?t
hurt the old lady! We only want one joey for the boys to take away
with them.?
So out of his warm bed a frightened little kangaroo was lifted
and passed from hand to hand and Mother Roo was turned loose to
join the mob again.
J . . // 1 A. ~ .
?You take him, Andy,? said the big man, ?you?ve goc a coat on
and can put him in a pocket. Watch he does not jump out!?
How different from his mother?s warm pouch was that pocket,
for it bounced up and down, it was rough and had bits of stuff in the
bottom of it. Joey tried some of them but they were quite bitter and he
made faces. Others were sweet, however, and he ate them, thus
tasting bread-crumbs for the first time.
Back at the homestead the girls took charge of him and through
his short childhood ?kangaroos grow up very quickly he had a
wonderful time as a station pet. The baby?s feeding-bottle, which
was at first provided for him, soon gave place to more solid food and
by the time his new Digger owners were through their training, he was
well able to look after himself. The girls had christened him ?Andy?
after the man who had carried him in from the ?drive,? so when he
was put on board the ship, he wore a gay leather collar with his name
and unit on it. This collar made him look ?all dressed-up? as he


sat on the deck carefully surveying the boys. Like all tame kangaroos
he quickly picked out his special pals and settled down to army life.

By the time England was reached for a spell of further training,
he was indeed an ?old soldier? even showing a well-developed fond-
ness for the canteen.
To the delight of the Diggers and their friends, Andy would


ANDY
breast the bar with them and drink almost anything, hard or soft, that
was ?shouted? for him. He became quite an inveterate ?sponger?
and would make his presence felt by offering to fight the fellow who
refused to supply his needs. Of course he was much encouraged in
his tricks and his'nimble paws were always ready to give a friend an
affectionate pat or a foe a crack that would make him ?sit up.?
The paws of a kangaroo are rather like fossilized starfish owing
to the peculiar setting of the serviceable claws when fully extended,
but they can pick up the smallest object. For digging and grubbing
amongst the stones they are excellent appendages and another job
for which they come in very handy is the punishment of those dis-
obedient wives and children. A real fight between two full-grown
male ?roos is a thing to be remembered, for it is an ?all-in affair and
the cruel, heavily-moulded middle claw of the hind-leg is the weapon
reserved for the coup de grace. I once tried to separate a fighting
pair in an Australian zoo, but they took absolutely no notice of big
sticks, brooms, or even a fire-hose. At last I got two buckets and we
?crowned? them, holding the tin masks firmly over their heads until
they had cooled down. One day I received a great surprise when a
pet scrub kangaroo gave me a sharp bite for tickling him a thing,
by the way, that they hate, though they will stand any amount of
fondling. They can ?nip? as effectively as the koala or native bear
and will raise a tremendous blood-blister even on hard skin.
Andy?s unit was duly equipped with great guns, wagons, and
motor-lorries. As was the custom at that period of the war, each
vehicle had to be branded in a contrasting colour with a unit badge or
sign such as a draught-board, a shamrock, a diamond, etc., and the
Commanding Officer decided to adopt Andy as his sign. Out of the
numerous photographs he had taken of the regimental mascot, one
was pressed into service and a splendid silhouette cut from it. By


some of the devious means known to engineers, this was enlarged to
the correct size?about eighteen inches square?and then a copy was
cut out of tin to make a stencil.
When the first wagon or two were painted with the new sign,
the Commanding Officer was escorted to inspect them. Just one
glance, and then he exploded:
?I thought our motto was ?ADVANCE AUSTRALIA,? ? he
shouted, ?Look at Andy!?
The sign was painted wrong way round on the wagons with the
tail pointing to the driver?s seat. Hasty and vigorous application of
scrapers and turps soon fixed the trouble, and many a weary Digger
marching along a seemingly interminable, muddy road cheered up
when he spotted Andy?s picture on a passing lorry and thus recognized
it as an Australian turnout.
The sign-painting episode has never been allowed to die, for at the
Annual Reunion of the unit a nicely stuffed replica of Andy graces
the Commanding Officer?s place at the table and before the proceed-
ings commence this of course must be ?dressed? to look squarely to
the front in an ostentatious manner and then the ?parade? is handed
over to the President of the Association.
The original Andy? No, he is not ?somewhere in France? for
he never went farther than England. With him it was a case of being
ruined by his friends, for he passed away through too much indulgence
at the canteen.
