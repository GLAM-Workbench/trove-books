FOREWORD.
HIS Exhibition is held in aid of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
The aim of the Committee in organising the Burdekin House
Exhibition has been to present to the public of Sydney a notable
collection of antique and modern Furniture, in the best possible
setting. The Exhibition has been a costly undertaking and it requires
the fullest support from the public to make it the financial success
it deserves to be. Usually an Exhibition of this character has to
suffer for want of appropriate surroundings. Here, in Burdekin
House, the setting is ideal. At last our public is given an opportunity
to study examples of furniture, representing many periods, by
master-craftsmen.
Through the generosity of the various owners, in lending their valu-
able pieces for three months, our people may study the beauty of
the designs and the workmanship. As we have no permanent
museum of decorative and applied art, this Exhibition should have
a considerable educational influence. There has been considerable
talk in the press of late of the necessity of developing a greater
feeling for beauty in the city. The Burdekin House Exhibition—
the treatment of the building, the planning of the garden, the
designing and arrangement of the rooms, at least reveals what can
be done by a small committee of experts, when given a free hand,
and it is hoped this Exhibition will have a permanent influence.
Similarly, the modern rooms show definitely what can be done when
a group of artists are given an opportunity to design effective
interiors. Nothing as complete as these rooms has been seen previ-
ously in Sydney and they prove conclusively that good modern
furniture can be designed and made in Sydney. If a group of
interested people could be found, who would consider acquiring
Burdekin House for the State, such Exhibitions could be managed
frequently and Sydney would have a much needed Museum of
Decorative and Applied Art —which undoubtedly would be of the
greatest benefit in developing taste in the community.
SYDNEY URE SMITH
President.


OLD FURNITURE.
o LD English furniture may be classified into three distinct periods,
viz., the Oak, Walnut and Mahogany Periods, each period taking
its name from the wood principally used at the time for the best
furniture.
The Oak Period extended from the earliest times until towards the
close of Charles ll.’s reign—the Walnut Period onwards until
shortly prior to the death of George 1., when walnut was displaced
by mahogany. The Mahogany Period runs from about 1720 for
100 years, after which English furniture does not afford a strong
appeal to the collector.
This classification is admittedly a broad one, as cabinetmakers are
a conservative class, and the introduction of a new wood did not
immediately close down the production of furniture in the wood
it superseded. Moreover, in each of these periods other woods were
used to a small extent; in such cases its design or form help to fix
the period of the piece.
From the reign of James I. until the Restoration, there was not any
very material difference in shapes or styles. On the accession of
Charles IE a reaction for what was artistic immediately set in, and
English furniture became more splendid and foreign in character,
partly as the result of the arrival in England of craftsmen from
Holland and France. On the accession of William 111., in 1689, the
Dutch influence became more pronounced, and much of the better
class furniture was inlaid with marquetry of various woods.
By 1702, when Queen Anne came to the throne, walnut had become
the popular wood.
During her reign the furniture was mainly simple and plain and
so continued until 1720, when it became more ornate in character
owing in part to French influence and in part to the introduction
of mahogany, which was more adapted to carving.
In the Walnut Period furniture was veneered, the walnut being cut
into veneers and glued on the surface of the carcase of a piece con-
structed in deal or oak.
This period also saw the origin of English lacquer furniture. During
the reign of Charles IE, lacquer cabinets of Oriental origin were
often imported from the East, and these importations soon caused
cabinetmakers in England to start imitating lacquer work. The

new craft became very popular, not only as an industry but as an
occupation for the wealthy classes. The fashion died out in the
early years of George ll.’s reign, but was again revived about the
middle of the 18ch century.
Furniture began '.o be made in mahogany as early as 1720, but it
was not until some fifteen years later, following upon the repeal
of the duty on mahogany, that this wood was used in any but
expensive pieces of high quality and workmanship for persons of
wealth and position.
From 173 5 onwards it supplanted walnut.
Then followed the great period of Chippendale, Adam, Hepplewhite
and Sheraton, which many consider the finest period of English
cabinetmaking.
Chippendale, the master craftsman of his time, is believed to have
been born in Yorkshire in 1717, and about his thirtieth year he
was carrying on business in London. He died there in 1779.
It must be remembered that Chippendale gave his name to the
furniture of his style, and while productions of his design are
called "Chippendale,” very little can be definitely assigned to him
personally, although his firm must have had a considerable output.
His book of furniture designs, published in 1751, largely influenced
the fashionable furniture of his time.
Chippendale produced masterpieces in the greatest variety of style,
including interpretations of the Queen Anne, Dutch, French,
Gothic, Chinese and Adam tastes. He worked almost invariably in
mahogany. Much of his furniture is the finest that has ever been
made. Towards the close of his career, he executed many of the
furniture designs of Robert Adam, the celebrated architect, who
also gave his name to a style, which was largely influenced by the
classical revival in the latter half of the 18 th century.
Two other great designers of furniture during this period (1775-
1800) are George Hepplewhite, a cabinetmaker and designer, and
Thomas Sheraton, a designer and a teacher of drawing. While the
designs of both largely owe their origin to the Adam and French
styles, they constitute a distinct type, in which lightness and grace
combined with strength and utility are outstanding characteristics.
Hepplewhite is justly celebrated for his beautiful shield-back and
other chairs, and Sheraton for his dainty use of figured veneer and
inlay.
OLD FURNITURE [Coni.)


The value and beauty of old furniture depend largely on three
factors:—
Colour and surface condition of the wood;
Design, proportion and ornamentation, and
Quality of workmanship.
The first is of supreme importance. The polishing, rubbing and
dusting of old furniture over a long period of time produce a beauti-
ful surface effect. Exposure to the air gradually hardens the surface
of the wood and also changes its colour, so that oak turns in time
to a rich dark tone, the yellow shades of walnut assume a more
golden hue, and the red tinge of mahogany is mellowed into tawny
shades of brown. The old oak furniture was treated simply with
raw linseed oil, both when originally made and afterwards in house-
hold cleaning. Old mahogany table tops were invariably finished
with a dressing of oil, and mahogany furniture in general was usually
slightly stained to enrich and equalise the colour and then beeswaxed
or oiled. Unfortunately, the beautiful surface of much old furni-
ture, acquired only by the lapse of time and household care, has
been ruined by French polish, which not only gives a cold glassy
surface, and fills up and obscures the grain and figure of the wood,
but is easily marked by hot dishes, plates, etc.
Examples of all the periods will be found in the Exhibition. Only
in cases where the Exhibitor has not dated the piece has a date
been assigned.

picture is a very tentative one. Seghers was known chiefly as a
painter of flowers and fruit, and he painted these accessories for
Rubens and other painters. It has been suggested that this work is
the product of collaboration between Seghers and Poussin. The
suggestion is an interesting one, and the classical subject matter
might quite easily indicate that French master, as well as the land-
scape, which suggests his hand. Both masters worked in Rome for
varying periods.

HANGINGS AND RUGS BV MARGARET JAY.


OLD SILVER AND SHEFFIELD PLATE
IN addition to noting the form, quality of workmanship and
weight of a piece, the collector of Old Silver always looks for its
marks. The London Marks, which are now four, have never
exceeded five. Taking them in the order of adoption they are: —
The Leopard’s Head, the Maker’s Mark, the Annual Letter, the
Lion Passant, the Lion’s Head erased and Britannia, the Sovereign’s
Head, and the Letter F.
The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths of London were first
invested with the right of assay by Edward the First in the year
1300, and then directed to mark each piece of "good and true allay”
with a Leopard’s Head. This has continued to be the London Hall
Mark—with an interval only of some 23 years—to the present day.
Until 1822 the Leopard’s Head was crowned; since then it has been
used without a crown. The Maker’s Mark was first made compulsory
in 1363, when it was enacted that there should be stamped the mark
of the Goldsmith maker on his piece in addition to the Leopard’s
Head. This is still done.
The obligation to mark London silver with a letter of the alphabet
to denote its date appears to have originated in or about 1478, and
since then a date letter has been regularly used. Alphabets of 20
letters with the letters in different forms, Roman, Gothic, etc.,
capitals or small, have constantly succeeded one another.
The Standard Mark of the Lion Passant has been regularly used on
sterling silver since 1545 to the present time, except from 1696
to 1720.
In Tudor times the standard for silver plate was fixed at 11 oz.
2 dwt. of fine silver and 18 dwt. of copper by way of alloying
metal for every 12 oz. or lb., and this has so remained to our time,
with the exception of the variation in the "Britannia Mark” period
from 1696 to 1720 in the reigns of William 111, Queen Anne, and
the first George.
To meet the demand for silver plate after the Restoration, silver-
smiths began to supply their need of material by withdrawing
coinage of the realm from circulation. To prevent this, in 1696 the
silver standard for plate was raised, the use of the Leopard’s Head
and the Lion Passant marks was suspended, and instead silver was
marked with the figure of Britannia and a Lion’s Head erased.
The two latter marks may still be used on silver of the higher
standard, but they ceased to be compulsory, and the lower standard
was reverted to from June, 1720.


From late 1784 until 1890 English silver bears the Sovereign's Head,
from 1784 to 1786 turned to the left, from 1786 to 1836 to the
right, and during Queen Victoria’s reign until 1890, again to the left.
Since the year 1876 foreign silver assayed in the United Kingdom is
marked with the letter F in an oval escutcheon.
Various English provincial assay offices were established many years
ago, and some are still in existence.
Provincial assay offices do not use the Leopard’s Head, but each
its own distinctive mark; for instance, Sheffield a crown, and
Birmingham an anchor.
There is much variation in Scottish marks, which are not the same
as English. Irish silver of Dublin assay, in addition to date and
maker’s mark, has two marks—a harp beneath a crown and the
figure Hibernia seated.
About the middle of the 18th century, a Sheffield artisan, named
Thomas Boulsover, discovered a means whereby silver could be
fused on a copper base, the metals being combined in such relative
thicknesses as ensured strength, durability, excellence of finish and a
moderate price. Silver having been fused on a piece of copper of a
much greater thickness by means of Boulsover's invention, the block
thus formed was rolled into sheets of the necessary thickness, and
the desired article fashioned therefrom.
Thus began the manufacture of old Sheffield Plate, which held
second place to sterling silver ware until the cheaper process of
Electroplate drove it out of the market about 1840.

PORCELAIN.
To the Chinese the world owes this material —"as lovely z any
fashioned by the hand of man”—and the beginning there of its
aesthetic development dates back to the commencement of the
Christian Era. The manufacture of porcelain in Europe is of very
recent origin, when compared with that of the land of its birth.
In mediaeval times, pieces found their way from China to the West,
to be treasured as jealously as gold or precious stones, but it was
not until late in the 16th century that porcelain was made in
Europe, and until the middle of the 18cli century that its manu-
facture was established in England.
Several factories came into existence about that time, but the
exact date of the earliest English production of porcelain is
unknown. The earliest date recorded on extant pieces, 1745, occurs
on two milk-jugs made at Chelsea; it is not known how long before
that date the factory was opened. The Bow factory may be said
to have been founded in 1744; that at Worcester in 1751. Another
w*s in existence at Bristol in 1750, whilst those at Derby, Longton
Hall, and Lowestoft were established within a few years of the
same date. The instability characteristic of the fortunes of most of
the English factories of the 18th rentury is due to the circumstance
that they were all carried on by private enterprise as commercial
undertakings, differing in this respect from the majority of their
contemporaries on the Continent, whose works were conducted as
adjuncts to royal or princely households subsidised out of the
revenues of their patrons.
The porcelain produced by the English factories of the 18th century
shows great variety of composition, but with few exceptions belongs,
like the earlier French porcelains, to the class of "soft paste” or
"artificial” pc celain, differing from its prototype, the "hard paste”
or "true” porcelain of the Far East and from that of Dresden, in
the substitution of an artificial glassy material known as "frit”
for the fusible natural rock which is an essential ingredient of the
latter. "Soft paste” is fired at a much lower temperature than
"hard paste,” and can be more or less easily cut with steel. This
makes no impression on "hard paste.” The porcelain of Bow,
Chelsea, Derby, Longton Hall, Lowestoft and Caughley all belongs
to the class of "soft paste”; that of Worcester (in the first period)
is of similar composition, modificdTSy the addition of soapstone to
the constituents. "Hard paste” was made only at Plymouth and
Bristol, and perhaps for a short time at New Hall in Staffordshire.


About the end of the 18th century, as a result of experiments made
by the second Josuh Spode, with which perhaps those of Martin
Barr of Worcester were on parallel lines, a new porcelain body was
invented in which the essential ingredients of hard porcelain, china-
stone and china-clay (Kaolin), were combined with bone-ash. The
new composition was soon generally adopted, and remains at the
present time the standard English porcelain body.
Painting was the most usual method of decorating old English
porcelain. The colours were applied over the glaze, with the impor-
tant exception of cobalt-blue, which, particularly as a ground
colour, was generally used as an underglaze pigment. Printing on
porcelain is an English invention adopted most extensively at Wor-
cester, though most of the early factories appear to have made
experiments with this process. The printed designs were applied
at first over the glaze in various colours. Printing in underglaze blue
was introduced at a slightly later date. Biscuit porcelain, that is,
porcelain without the addition of glaze or enamelling, was used for
statuettes at Derby and, perhaps, at Chelsea.
Very few of the compositions of early English porcelain painters
and figure-modellers are of an original character, especially in the
18th century; their designs were borrowed from various sources.
Much of their work is in direct imitation of Chinese and Japanese
porcelam, or that of Continental factories, particularly Dresden
and Sevres.
The following are the approximate dates of some of the English
factories;—
Bow, 1744-1776. —The Bow factory was purchased in 1776
by William Duesbury of Derby and the moulds and models
removed to the Derby Works.
Chelsea, 1745-1770. —The Chelsea factory was purchased by
William Duesbury of Derby in 1770 and continued at
Chelsea under the name of
Chelsca-Dcrby , 1770-1784, in which year the works were closed
and dismantled.
Derby, 1756-1848. —William Duesbury the first carried on the
business from about 1756 until his death in 1786, when
he was succeeded by his son, William Duesbury the second.
The business was sold to Robert Bloor in 1811, and soon
declined. The original factory was closed in 1848. A new
factory was then founded by William Locker and others,
and was the forerunner of the present celebrated works.


Worcester.
Dr. Wall Period, 1751-1783. —This is the great period of the
Worcester factory. Dr. Wall died in 1766.
Flight—Flight & Barr, etc. Period 1783-1840.
Chamberlain, 1786-1840. —Robert Chamberlain established
another factory in Worcester in 1786 and this business
was continued by the Chamberlain family until 1840,
when both factories amalgamated. The present Worcester
Royal Porcelain Factory is the successor of both.
Caughley, 1772-1799.
Coalport, 1780 (still in existence). —In 1799 it absorbed the
Caughley factory, and later the Nantgarw and Swansea
Works.
Nantgarw , 1811-1822.
Swansea, 1764, but did not make porcelain until 1814. It
ceased to do so in 1824.
Plymouth, Bristol, 1750-1781.
Spnde, 1800-1833, then purchased by William T. Copeland.
Rockingham, 1826-1842.

THE MODERN INTERIOR DECORATION.
As the prejudices attached to the nineteenth century are fading,
the appreciative susceptibility to modern interior decoration is
developing beyond all anticipations. The first approach to new
colour schemes and recent experiments in form was marked by hesi-
tancy, suspicion, and frank indications of amusement. This was
only to be expected. The neoteric produces these effects on any
intelligence composed of established principles. But the persistency
of the few, in this country, who have been ardent admirers of
modern designing and the arguments that they have repeatedly
brought forward in its favour have succeeded in gaining a sympa-
thetic hearing from the more important of the sceptics. Modern
interior decoration had at its origin, no doubt, the usual rebellious
regard which one age has for its immediate predecessor. It sprang
from the spirit of revolt against the drab and the fussy and expressed
itself in the creation of stark, rigid forms and broad surfaces of bare,
unbroken colour. Utter and inflexible simplicity combined with
pure, invigorating colour dictated the policy of the new and sane
interior decorators of the modern school. Those first domestic rooms
of theirs were certainly not cosy. They refused a moment’s respite
to the eye of the sentimentalist, who looked in vain for something
untidy to put him at case with the new idea. The walls were great
open spaces, free from pictures (they destroyed one’s sensibility to
cubic values). Under the feet, like a desert, lay the floor, from which
at intervals rare clumps of furniture rose four-square. The whole
effect of these rooms was one of spaciousness presided over by the
eternal cube. Only the concession of a little selected colour saved
the Philistines from the descending horrors of agrophobia. But the
element that provides for human comfort could not be ignored for
long. The somewhat severe correction had served its purpose. Now,
we have chairs that supply rest for the body, and on the walls, a well-
placed oasis (or two, maybe) furnishes a refuge for the eye. If
we examine the case for modern interior decoration as it stands at
the present time we find everything in its favour when compared
with the dingy, uninspiring domestic settings to which we have for
so long been accustomed. It eliminates all that is unnecessary and is
in agreement with the whole world-movement towards simplifica-
tion as exemplified in modern dress, modern architecture, modern
art, modern hygiene, town-planning and constructional engineering.


Furthermore, it gives ample scope for the application of colour. Its
furniture is based, and obviously so, on the simple primary forms —
the cube, the prism, the cylinder, the cone, the pyramid, the sphere
and restricted variations of these forms. An analysis of the
gieatest examples of architecture in the world’s history discloses that
the) ha\ e achieved their purpose through the judicious use of these
elementary shapes. Modern dress, which insists on severity and more
definite \eitical lines, is provided with the ideal background in the
modern interior setting. The old übiquities—the nick-nack, the
Dying Gladiator ’ and the "Girl with Fawn,” dear residences of dust
and germ are absent from the modern room. Heav) hangings have
disappeared. Only such curtains as obey the dictates of utility and
assist the definite colour scheme are permitted to remain. The
modern room should present the perfect combination of utility and
aesthetics. Like architecture, modern decoration is an art which
impinges on that realm where things have a material purpose and it
is at its highest when it is in perfect sympathy with utilitarian needs.
When one remembers the old, brown drawing room, gorged with
the heirlooms from past centuries, and when he recalls how he
threaded his way among the tables in terror lest the bric-a-brac come
crashing about his ears, he turns with welcome relief to the great
possibilities which interior decoration promises him in the future.
As new ideas evolve and new colour schemes are created there is only
one danger that confronts us, and that is the desire on the part of
the incompetent practitioner, hiding under the title of modernity,
to 'go one better.” It remains for the discerning members of the
public, who, having absorbed the principles and intention of the
modern decorator to apply them, discriminate, and reject bad
All that passes as modern is not good. All that is good is not modern

brasswork and stand are in pure Japanese style, only the mechanism
being English. The dial marked with the signs of the Zodiac being
employed in Japan to mark the hour —revolves, while the pointer
and hand are stationary. It is fitted with an alarm.

Bookcase and cabinet de-
signed by Mr. Roi de
Mestre and carried out in

scraper. Such forms mass

stability and purpose.

Are You Wearing Your
Own Corset?
YOU raise your
eyebrows at the
question. And yet
it is quite possible
that the answer is
"No.”
WHEN you went
to buy it, how were
you fitted? Two
women may have
identical waist
measurements and yet require
entirely different foundation
garments.
YOUR foundation garment should
fit you as subtly as a silken sheath,
as personally as a second skin. If
it does not, it was cut, not for
you, but for another woman.
BUT, short of having it woven
upon you, how are you to find
such a garment?
THAT was the problem that con-
fronted Berlei Ltd. A big problem.
And they faced it on a big scale.
THEY put it in the hands of the
Professor of Anatomy at a leading
University. They gave him a staff
of science graduates, nurses, cor-
setieres. Under his guidance, they
measured seven thousand Aus-
tralian women from every con-
tralian women
from every con-
ceivable angle.
It was a survey
unique in the his-
tory of science.
WHEN the survey
was finished, they
worked for months
on its findings.
Gradually, an in-
teresting fact emerged. There
were five distinct types of Aus-
tralian women. Not five sizes
—five types in which the pro-
portion of hip to bust and bust
to abdomen radically differed.
OBVIOUSLY, then, the first
thing to do in fitting is to deter-
mine the type. Not until the type
is discovered do sizes begin to
matter.
BL T T the type cannot be deter-
mined at sight. Again, they went
to work.
THEY evolved the highly scien-
tific Figure Type Indicator. They
issued it to each store in Aus-
tralia that sells Berlei garments.
They made a full range of gar-
ments in each type.
'■>
'
There arc five types of Australian women. Which type arc you?
We suggest that you should go to your nearest Big Store
and use the Berlei Figure Type Indicator to find out.

LAMPS
from Russia
Specially selected by Mr. H. W.
Bindoff on his recent visit to the
Continent for David Jones'. The lamp
has suddenly become an article of
great importance in modern home
furnishing. Here are new types from
Russia, cjuaint and quite different.
The stands are in brightly hued wood,
many evolved from actual Russian
toys. Their parchment shades are
brilliantly colored, introducing un-
common designs. ON THE FOURTH
FLOOR.

and inferior productions being kept
