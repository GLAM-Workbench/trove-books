W, M f Ca.ll, Printer, Cartwright Place, By-
rom Street, Liverpool.
The convict ship lay near the beach*
The night was drear and dark.
And many a wretched felon stood.
Awaiting to embark.
One felon stood among*the rest.
Whose eyes looked fierce and wild*
He held an infant in his arms ;
k 'Twas, alas ! his only child.
His auburn hah* fell careless o'er
A r brow of spotless Avhite;
His little eyes beam hi playfully.
With innocent delight.
He little knew his father's heart
Was breaking while he smiled
Or that he took a last farewell
Oi him his only child.
They'tore the infant from his arms.
And dragged him from the shore.
He wildly gazed around the beach.
But saw his child no more.
The vessel sailod?the convict fell?
In dying anguish wild,
*Tis done; the fatal'struggle's o f cr?~
Alas ! my only child.
The*widow-mother sobbed alone;
Her tears might flow in vain;
That bitter morn, ner husband fell.
She ne'er would see again.
She pressed her infant to her heart.
Again she saw him smile.
I'll live for that dear boy, she sakl,
Ala# ! my only child.
