HUIPTY DUMPTY.
All the Music introduced in the Pantomime to he obtained at Messrs.
W. H. GLEN and CO.?S, 33 Collins Street Past.
ACT I.
Scene I. ?The Eire King?s Palace.
CHORUS OF VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE SPIRITS.
Aie. ?? Have you seen the Shah.?
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
We come slap bang, the fiery gang,
Obedient to the call
Of brazen clang with son?rous rang
Through this our master?s hall;
And here we wait in solemn state,
* As glare around we fling ?
' To welcome straight, though he be late,
Flambeau, the great Fire King !
Oh, he?s the great Fire King, boys; he?s the great Fire King,
With sparkling crest and fiery breast, he?s reckoned quite the thing
In ardent praise of his bright blaze we?ll make his Temple ring,
W e?re proud to say we serve Flambeau the King!
He?s the great Fire King, &c.
'Enter Flambeau.
Flam. My gallant Fire Brigade, my glowing six,
You are what I may call, Melburnt fire bricks.
To you a weighty matter I?ll disclose,
Come nearer, ?nearer yet ?keep off my toes.
Our Royal pleasure, and our edict runs
Throughout this Pantomime we?ll have no puns
On big McKean, John Thomas, or his moke,
Or any threadbare subject for a joke,
Swear by my torch-sure. Torture ?that will do ;
Who taught yer that joke ?give us something new.
Will o? the Wisp!
Enter Will o? the Wisp.
* That sound may threaten harm,
See what?s the meaning of yon fire alarm.
Don?t ccogi tate, but see who?s there young codger, ?
If it?s police then come the artful dodger.
j Exit Will.
Say our hotel is always closed on one day, ?
At least the front door is upon a Sunday,
And those who on the Sabbath want a nip
Can do as usual, in the back door slip.


Confound that bell, why there?s another ring.
Humpty (without) I say you know I want to see the king.
Enter Humpty followed hy Will.
Whew! you?re a trifle warm here.
Flam. Ain?t it nice P
Hump. How can you do?t with coals at such a price ?
Just at this time Victoria?s too hot
Flam. To hold some folks, who?ve hooked it like ashot.
Hump. Youv?e got a (g) coal(d) mine of your own perhaps ?
Flam. You?re right, my Humpty Dumpty, ?
Hump. And these chaps ?
Flam. My miners ! The Australasian Co. in New South
Wales,
Floated by Melbourne capital when Sydney fails, ?
These coalitions oft burst up when calls end,
Then Little-ton ?neath Coke and weakest to the Walls'
end.
Will Do mind how you hold you torch man.
Hump. You?ve scorched my whiskers, and I?m now a
Scorchman.
Flam. He?s not yet ready for cremation urns,
This is Victoria, not the land of Burns.
Will {aside) About his blazing whiskers need he roar !
They?re not more fiery than they were before.
Hump. On you great King, I feel I can depend,?
I know your power, and wish you for my friend.
Flam. My hand contrives most ill ?those boots and shoes,
Stopped at the Customs?you well know whose ?
CWtew-cidence tariff -ic ! Ah! you needn?t wince,
It?s hot for that importer ever since.
Aye, hot for him whom conscience over-rides,
Conscience as pliant as elastic sides.
O' Callaghan on his last legs, did by some blunder come,
His sole soars uppards, twon?t a Sunder come.
When Hegenbotham tried to get his right
I, Fitz-gih-um , made our Eecorder fight;
?Twas 1 who set on Coffee Jones so hot,
To move that vote against the Kerferd lot,
And then let poor old Coffee go to pot-,
Not Ashant Coffee, no, nor Ashantea,
Nor yet the Commodore, our own Coffey.
Hump. In fact you?re worse than all your tribe beside,
Therefore, in werse, to you I will confide,
I loved the sweet Fern Fairy,?you may stare,?


Yes, doted on her every lock of hair.
She scorned my suit, gave fairy like abuse ? nay,
Turned up at me, her charming nez retrousse.
In spite of all her powers I live and thrive
The smallest and the ugliest dwarf alive.
And some glory in it ?there let me see
For ugliness?well, you come next to me.
Flam. ( bowing) You are too kind.
Hump. Oh, not at all!
Will {to Flam) Stop Guv'nor Bowing ?surely ?tis so,
For ? ugly is as ugly does you know.?
Hump. Fine locks of fashionable hue I bear.
Flam. Who ever saw a finer red of hair ?
Now, here?s for you ! Attention ! now, my men, ?
Why should a dwarf\i\iQ him, be fond of hy-men ?
Hump. Because I?m weddish ! {Strokes his whiskers.)
Flam. No, because a dwarf
So had, must surely want a better half.
And he shall have one. There?s some jolly sport
To come off shortly at King Arthur?s Court,
There Humpty Dumpty may win for his bride
The Princess Roseleaf!
Hump. Let me blush aside.
Flam To aid your chances with this leaf of Rose,
A magic melody we must compose.
Now, as we two in this great work conspire.
Place these ingredients within the fire.
Both. Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
Like a mining swindle bubble !
Hump. What?s this ?
Flam. The long lost Canterbury chair !
The wig that Mr. Speaker will not wear ;
Next, is something much too good to drop in,
The Parliamentary wages earned by Coppin!
Will The opening banquet at the Grraving-dock;
Paper improver, picked up on the block ;
Penny whistle solo, ? Love among the roses,?
Snatched from a small boy
Hump. Playing outside Hosie?s.
Flam. A cheap slop suit?? Look Monster on the Flags
A tin of our preserved meats done to rags ;
Street hydrant working on a dusty day, ?
A civic perfume from a right-of-way.
Will An educated silk worm, looking prime ;
Skedaddle march of Giorza in no time.


Plain. Some Chinese lotteries, put down by the law,
And Ballarat Art Swindles by the score.
Charity from the Presbyterian Camp,
The shining light of the moderator lamp, ?
Come forth original and bright refrain,
As fresh and pure as Offenbachian strain!
A (Zee &) Kane- dence, Faling cheeks of men,
Played in a Wil (d) hey from a demon Glen !
Apollo rises with music.
Hump. I?ll have it registered.
Flam. Oh none can play it,
Or sing it, chant it, whistle it, or say it,
Unless they know the secret of its birth.
Hump. All right, I do. Now, what?s the music worth ?
Will Like all the newest tunes, with pictures nice,
It?s marked ?four bob.?
Flam. But sold at half the price.
You?re armed for victory as my ally,
The Fairy of the Ferns you may defy,
But if within three days you don?t succeed,
You?ll risk your downfall very much indeed.
Hum]). Then I?ll set off at once to see the King,
And to my the pretty Princess bring.
Flam. To guide your steps from pools and brambles harsh
Will o? the Wisp will light you through the marsh.
Will {aside) And if I don?t leave him to swim or sink,
I?m not the light deceiver that folks think.
CONCERTED PIECE.
? Princess of Trebizonde.?
Will The wedded wife of Humpty Dam
The Princess Roseleaf soon we?ll see,
No other husband like to he
Erom cold Greenland to warm Fiji.
As he?s so small ?we may suppose
She?ll at him perhaps turn up her nose ;
And likewise look a little glum,
To be the wife of Humpty Dum.
(To hump.) ? The most now of our time let?s make,
Through wood and hollow dell and brake j
Will o? the Wisp is wide awake,
And to sweet Roseleaf you he?ll take.
Follow me to see the Princess, and don?t despond,
Quick follow me, follow me !
To the Princess, don?t despond!
All The most now of your time, &c.


Scene ll. ?The Fairies? Fountain in the
Fern Forest.
SOLO AND CHORUS.
Aik. ?? Tournez, Tournez,''
(From La Fille de Madame Angot.)
(Boosey and Co., London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
Fern Fairy Gently gliding
Through the leafy forest dell,
Fairies dwelling,
Music swelling,
Sweeter far than song can tell.
Chiding, biding,
In the breast of lily fair ;
Hiding, gliding,
As the birdies through the air.
Fairies Gently gliding, &c.
Fern F. Charmed by your vocal-efforts I appear,
As fairies ought to at this time of year ;
When every pretty form of Nature?s hand
Assumes a semblance of the spirit land.
When everything around is bright and jolly,
And only Bogus Clarke is melancholy;
I come from Dandenong amid the ferns,
To hold a council on those grave concerns,
And use both wit combined with native grace,
To raise, refine, and bless the human race.
Maidenhair. Obedient to you will we hold ourselves,
Both fairies, naiads, dryads, nymphs, and elves.
Fern F. Here then wr?ll sit in Council as of yore?
Larkspur. A Shyer council I ne?er saw before
Fern F. Now then to business what?s before the forum ?
Larkspur, my dear, see if we have a quorum ?
Attention now! I?ve had the question popped,
By the ugliest little wretch that ever hopn?d?
All. What, marry ?
Lark. Oh, how mice!
Fern F. _ You silly child!
The offer was?nt nice, it made me wild,
The offerer was one about so tall; (shows height)
?Twas Humpty Dumpty who seated on a wall.
Maid. The goblin wretch !
Lark. Who frightens all the birds,
Except the sparrows. Uses naughty words.
Fern F. Enraged by my rejection of his suit, he
Has sworn to carry off and wed our beauty,
Our gentle Koseleaf, whom we all so love,
. � %


And rank all other mortals far above.
Maid. Yet scarcely mortal she, for each fay knows
Her Ma was offspring of an elf and rose;
Fern F. So shall her beauty mingle with her name,
To give our lovely roses their fair fame ;
And make them queens of every flow?r show,
And spite of Trollope never cease to ? blow.?
May nations still unborn feel Roseleaf?s power,
And homage pay to love?s own chosen flower ;
I charge you all, protect her from this ill ?
All. By your leaf great Fairy Queen we will.
Fern F. Break up the council, have no more debate,
For why should fairies sit in solemn state ?
There?s naught I know particularly sweet in
Reading the minutes of the previous meeting.
Next order of the day is?all to sing
And caper nimbly round the verdant ring.
SONG-.
Air. ?? The Return of Spring.
(Ashdown and Parry, London, and W. H. Q-len and Co., Melbourne.)
Pern F. Sunbeams glancing, all delighting ?
To the merry dance inviting,
And to pleasant thoughts exciting
?Tis the time for fairy sport. Sunbeams glancing, &c
Midnight?s quiet, tender notion,
Is the fairies fond devotion ;
For the powers of starry night
Shake our nature in their flight;
But the sun?s rays, I?ve a notion
Glance around to pay us court.
Sunbeams glancing, &c.
Scene 111. ?Princess Boseleaf?s Boudoir.
Enter Lady op the Chambee.
Lady This Court life here is really most fatiguing :
Such lots of work, and far too much intriguing.
But lately I, with salary enlarged,
To overlook domestics have been charged.
A sort of Upper House maid, I declare
I?m not the first old woman who?s been there.
Rouse up, my little maidens, and prepare
The boudoir for your Princess with great care.
Enter Domestics.
Well done, the like of that was never seen.
X hear a footstep! Hush! it is the Queen.
*


Enter Queen G-raemaie.
Queen It?s pretty, but you have?nt got a bit
Of furniture on which a queen can sit.
Lady They?ll stand a strain ; ?tis some imported stock.
Queen Are they all firm ?
Lady All from the firm of BocJce.
Queen I like a something that I?m not afraid of;
I like to know, too, what- the cushion?s made of.
Hard seats a body?s comfort sadly mars :
And Hobson?s Bays are?nt Pullman?s palace cars,
And cattle trucks don?t heavy journeys lighten
On holidays from Flinders street to Brighton.
But railway comforts even some disparage
And growl at fifty in the smoking carriage.
But where?s my niece ? She?s nevvy surely gone.
Lady The Princess Eoseleaf will be here anon.
Queen Anon-an none of you wiR go and bring her.
Not e?en so much as fold up one small finger
To save your queen a trouble or a fear.
Enter Eoseleae.
Eose. Don?t scold my maidens, auntie, there?s a dear.
I?ve wandered in the gardens in the light
Of the calm moon, sweet spirit of the night,
Gardens Botanic, where Guilfoyle now is ruler,
The barren waste once of the Baron Mueller,
Unlike the wilderness of former days.
Queen It strikes me, girl, if you go out to gaze
On that sweet spirit of night, naught could be righter
Than you should need some sweet spirit of nitre,
For you?ll get such a cold.
Eose. Aunt don?t be cruel.
Queen There?s nothing less than Wizard Oil or gruel,
Kruse?s Magnesia, Krara?s Pills, tallow, too,
Will be required to pull your Highness through.
Eose. Oh! never fear, the Gardens are my home,
And ?midst the flowers unharmed I always roam.
SONG.
Aik.?? All among the Clover.?
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
Rose With Latin and with Greek to fill
One?s head I don?t agree,
For what?s the use of those dead tongues
To living girls like me ?
I?d rather in the garden stroll,
Yes, there I?d roam for hours ?


Studying with my lover
Language of the flowers.
For strolling in the garden, when the moon shines clear and bright,
Surely is a pleasant way to pass the early night ;
Studying jolly botany, from lips so dearly prized,
Creates a sort of feeling that cannot be analysed.
Chorus. ?For strolling in the garden, &c.
He teaches me that heart?s ease means
In violet to keep,
Affections pure and holy flame,
Nor suffer it to sleep ;
While love lies bleeding at my feet,
My two lips he devours:
With him I?d study every night
The language of the flowers.
Chorus. ?Strolling in the garden, &c.
Queen And who was with you in the garden, pray ?
Eose. My cousin, aunt.
Queen In spite of all I say,
You will encourage that Prince Prettyboy,
While my poor child, his mother?s only joy,
My sweet Boubee, fair as the fabled chimera,
More winsome than the member for the Wiramera,
On whose bright phiz the eyes of Service gloat,
Wimmera, Maldon, Mac -bain and anti-dote.
Por you, Eoseleaf, he?s going in big licks.
Eose. He?s fonder far of licking sugar sticks.
Queen He?s fond of sweets and all things nice, ?tis true,
But that?s the reason he?s so fond of you.
Eose. He never told his love, but let his ma
Do all his courting for him
Queen Oirl! ha ! ha !
His love unspeakable finds vent in mutterance.
Eose. I?ve often thought he was too full for utterance ,
When all the words he?d spealt were half a dozen.
Queen You?ve thought of him sometimes, then ?
Eose. As a cousin.
I?ll marry none but Prettyboy so clever,
I never will, no?never ?never ?never!
Queen Oh ! don?t spout here, but mind, Miss, what I say.
Eose. Where should I spout but at my uncle?s, pray ?
Queen And what?s your uncle?s game ? I know what?s up,
He?s started an Art Union for a cup,
Which if you win, you either sell or keep ;
But if you?re wide awalce you?ll go to Sleep.
Three JcnocJcs.
To give one such a start is really shocking.


Rose. See what?s the tenor of that treble knocking.
Queen It must be some one of a good position.
Lady The new Lord Chancellor desires admission
Enter Loed Chancelloe.
Queen A ngels and ministers, familiar that face is, ?
Where have I seen it ? Ah ! trying Gases
At the Lands Office, ?that?s the earthly spot
Where dummies sometimes get it rather hot;
Gippsland explorer, yes, you all well know,
Went with the Guv?nor pro Bowen publico.
Rose. I wonder how that small account has fared.
Queen {Aside) Langton tells me it never has been squared.
Lord C. Your pardon, Queen and Princess, but I bring
A message from his Majesty the King ;
Por fear of some one our Roseleaf snapping,
Our Knights resolve by the Bound Table rapping
That she must wed some one r wrong or right,
Vide last issue ? Harbinger of Light.?
Rose. Yerry-fying news ?one moment tarry.
They surely never mean that I must marry.
Lord C. They do.
Rose. Oh, bless them!
Queen Yes, but who?s the victim ?
Because of course they?ve been and gone and picked
him.
Lord C. They?ll choose the youth aspiring to the station
By grand competitive examination.
Rose. Ah ! very few would draw the country?s pay
If members were selected in that way.
Examining knights! One thing we can?t deny them
Their heads to form a board must qualify them.
If uncle picks a mate that?s not the thing,
I hope the knights will then check mate the king.
Lord C. In singing only will the trial be, ?
Like this {sings) ? Do, ra, mi, fa, so, la,? ?see?
Queen What ? a singing trial r that shews men are fools?
Why, singing?s queerly taught in our State schools.
Rose. Prince Prettyboy is sure to win.
Queen That boy!
Rose. He?ll carry of the Palm here , aye, tho? Coy.
Queen Than piping bullfinch Boubee can sing clearer.
Rose. Than piping bullfrog would be somewhat nearer.
Queen But then he plays the fiddle !
Lady {Aside) Oh! Frightful.
Rose. Its excruciatingly delightful.


Queen You know, my dear, if you read history s page,
That fiddling Princes now are all the rage.
Eose. The Duke of Edinburgh ?
Queen That royal male.
Eose. True to his bow, is now toujours fidele ;
But as he?s married, he must draw it mild, ?
{Mocking) Alfred my love that noise will wake the
child.
Lord C. His Majesty is waiting.
Queen We obey.
Eose. Here is a maiden to be given away.
Queen Entered for the stakes at Marry-byrnong, ?
A pretty maiden going for a song,
A reg?lar duck worth many a ducat, ?
Auctioneer?s pun, from GemmeVs room I Tuckett.
Eose. Kind fates watch o?er me, and my future guide,
Than Prettyboy?s, I?ll be no other bride.
{Golden fern leaf falls.)
A fern leaf! ?tis the token that doth tell
My troubled spirit all is going well.
CONCERTED PIECE. Air.? ? The Belle of the Ball ?
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
Eose To the Fairies no doubt I?m indebted,
Such tokens must come from their Queen,
And its awfully nice to be petted
By people whom one?s never seen.
Lord C. I am bound to observe, etiquette
At the Court of my master, the king;
And I only observe ?never yet,
Was his Majesty thus kept srait-inq
Queen (spoken) Ah ! we know what we know. His
Majesty must wait, when ladies are in the case.
It?s a way we belles have got, you know.
Rose Yes, that is the way of us belles, my boys,
Ringing of minutes the knells, my boys,
Always delaying by spells, my boys,
Such is the way of us belles.
All That is the way of us belles, &c.
Scene IV.?The Court of King Arthur.
Enter Twelve Knights and Boijbee.
Boub. Ah ! sold again ! my lot of stupid wonderers !
My gallant corps of plunderers and blunderers!
12th Knt. We thought it was the King.
Boub. Of course you did,
You?d ne?er have turned out for this precious kid,
Yes, everyone neglects me, and ?bohoo !


Look here, 12th Knight, I?ll tell my ma of you.
12th Knt. Of me ?
Boub. You?ll never let the guard salute me,
And just the other day one tried to shoot me
Shut up as I am is a horrid bore,
For a larrikin life I do hong-more ;
But I?ll be even with you, once for all,
What right have you within the banquet hall ?
Except the King be here ? Eh ? Not a jot of ye
Shall longer here remain. Get out, the lot of ye!
Exit Knights.
I?m very ill since yesterday?dear me!
Sunbury wine and two ales don?t agree.
I must be good, because I?m mother?s joy,
Her tiddy, iddy, darling, own sweet boy.
SONG. ?Axe.?? The Moral Young Man.?
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
I am a lively larrikin,
The country?s future hope;
For law I do not care a pin
Although within its s- Cope.
I kick old men, knock women down.
And then away I run,
I am the nuisance of the town,
The plague of every one.
Whene?er I cope with a dear old judge,
The tears to his eyes I bring ;
And after the fourteen days? in quod,
I?m olf for another fling.
When I go in for a pint of twos,
And the landlord asks for pay,
He gets it hot with the pewter pot,
And then I slither away.
For I?m a lively larrikin,
The country?s future hope,
For law I do not care a pin,
Although within it?s s - Cope,
Whene?er I cope, &c. Exit.
Enter King Arthur, Lord Chancellor, and Physician.
King How?s tbis ? iny Knights not yet arrived ! they lag ;
Would that my days were so disposed to drag.
Enter Knigbts.
12th K. Sour Majesty is up betimes ?I?m smitten.
King King Arthur always was an early Briton.
Last Tcnight as usual!
12th K. Yes, I know, last night
As usual , your Majesty got tight.


King Hush ! put the saddle on some other horse.
Physician The fellows wrong your Majesty, of course.
Of virtues all, his Majesty?s exemplar,
A Rechabite, tee-tattler, and Good Templar.
(Aside) Than brandy nothing stronger does he take.
12th K. I beg your pardon, sire, ?twas my mistake.
King All right, we?ll make of this a regular mirthday,
It being, as you know, my fiftieth birthday.
Lord C. We all congratulate you, sire, upon it.
Here come the State School children with their sonnet,
King A custom good, and oft the little dears
Do almost move my stony heart to tears.
Enter Children.
CHORUS.?Aie?? Merrily do the Fairies Live
(M'Dowell and Co , London, and W. H. GUen and Co., Melbourne.)
Children Cheerily shall our voices ring,
In heartfelt joyous chorus,
Hailing the natal day of king,
So loved as he before us.
King Arthur good, whose happy mood
And life to all endear him ;
Each peasant?s child from greenwood wild,
Comes tripping here to cheer him.
Children all, in castle hall,
Enjoy the carol singing;
Behold us here, once ev?ry year,
Our festive offerings bringing.
Children all, &c.
King I?d like to kiss them, bless their little hearts.
Here?some one take the orb.
Lord C. Sire, in these parts,
On festive days or state occasion old,
The sceptre and the orb throughout you hold.
King But can?t I kiss the darling little kids ?
What?s to prevent P
Lord C. Court etiquette forbids.
King One thing shall always in my halls he found,
Por colonial hospitality renowned,
Free counter lunch by day and night for all.
You?ll find there?s something nice in yonder hall.
Children God Bless good King Arthur!
King As you take each bite,
? May good digestion wait on appetite.?
Exeunt Children.
King A toast, my gallant knights ! What shall it be ?
Lord C. The Queen and rest of Royal Family.


Enter Queen, Eoselbaf, Peettyboy, Tol de eoi, and
Boubee.
Queen Prince Prettyboy!
Pretty. What is it now, step-mother ?
Queen Do, pray, take pattern by your younger brother.
It isn?t pretty, boy, that?s what I mean,
To kiss the Princess ere you kiss the Queen.
Lord C. Court etiquette forbids.
Pretty. It seems to me
Court etiquette and I can ne?er agree
About this right, now, which each day grows stiffer ;
My duties and my inclination differ.
King Bother duties ; who?s minister for ?em ?
Pretty. Well, Yale?s gone, yet still they?re ad Vale orem.
King My sentiments exactly.
Queen Arthur Eex!
Eespect my wifehood and respect my sex.
Boub. Hooray ! for woman?s rights ma?s going in some,
Abusing all the men, like Polly Plum.
Eose. Against a monarch would you battle levy ?
King Lord Chancellor, this orb is getting heavy ;
I?d like to put it down or forward jolt it.
(To Orchestra ) Play an orb-urn air ?lll try to bolt it.
Lord C. Court etiquette forbids,
Tol de rol Besides, adzooks !
?Twould injure much your Majesty?s good looks;
And then your portrait in the coinage clear
Would make the best of rhino very ? queer.?
Boub. His portrait clear ? Better be painted darkly,
Like the daub sent us by Sir Henry Barkly,
Which is so bad that nothing here can bang it,
The City Council e?en refuse to hang it.
12th K. The banquet waits.
Boub. And I?ve been waiting drily
A pint of sheoak. Oh ! dear, I?m choking !
King. Is that a joke?
Queen . Pray, don?t be joking.
King Was ever such a boy ?
Queen I should say never !
Like Balfour , he?s so goody and so clever;
So young, so beautiful, so wise, so skilled,
A professorial chair he should have filled.
So like his dear papa, whom long I mourn for.
King Not more than I do, ma?am, that I?ll be sworn for.
Queen King Arthur, you?re a brute!


King Lord Chancellor, command
The singers competition for her hand.
Queen Stanford and Long ! Is it a joke he means ?
These rival Singers are our sewing machines.
Boub. In this election, sire, I beg to state
That for your ward I am a candidate ;
The usual promises, of course, I make them.
Bose. And equally of course, he?s sure to break them.
King Your vocal skill to hear we now prepare.
Boub. I?ll sing my favorite operatic air.
SON Q-.? Air. ?? Blighted Husband.??
(W. H. Q-len and Co., Melbourne.)
Behold me the emblem of wisdom and wit,
As member for Richmond I?m thoroughly fit;
I?m cute and sagacious, oracular, with
The daring of double L. Smith.
I write to the Argus, when folks raise my ire,
And I?m constantly setting the ? Yarra ? on fire.
I drink pigeon?s milk for breakfast when it comes to
hand,
And Shillinglaw says I discovered Q-ipps Land.
Behold me the emblem, &c.
All Behold him the emblem, &c.
Queen That?s very good, my bashful boy,
He?s quite a second Tamburini Coy,?
So very good ! Encore !
King Pooh, no such thing,?
Now, Tol de rol, let?s hear what you can sing.
Tol. Don?t reckon upon me as in the running,
Because I may say, without trace of punning,
That Tol de rol is very far without it,
And long ago I tol'd her all about it.
Bose. You said you?d give your chance to Prettyboy;
But still you?ll favor us with just one ditty, boy ?
SONGK?TOL DE ROL.? Air? ? Hidin? in a Railroad Keer
The Princess Roseleaf?s not for me,
It seems to be pretty clear,
My once fond heart shall find repose,
In a Hobson?s Bay Railway ? keer.?

To make for Sandridge Pier,
Slamm?d and jamm?d and jolly well cramm?d,
In a Hobson?s Bay Railway ? keer.?
Slamm?d and jamm?d, &c.

As I to the suburbs steer,
For comfort and elegance and both combined,

All For comfort and elegance, &c.
King Now Prettyboy!
Pretty. And you ?sweet grace?s blender,
Do you accept our notes as legal tender ?
Rose. Ob ! yours are always tender; and my choice
Would be to hear but one ?my Pretty?s voice;
But uncle and his knights have made decree,
And what avails the wish of little me ?
Pretty. This surely must to world of dreams belong,?
A Princess going for a paltry song !
But, since her fate depends upon this hour,
Here goes to win her, if ?tis in' my power.
SONG. ?Aib ?? Love Song.?
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
Pretty. Roseleaf! what sweeter theme
Could all the muses nine suggest to lover thine ?
Roseleaf! loveliest dream
That poesy could lend us, mankind to refine!
From the roses, leafy beds
Thou pluck?st the freshness without glove,
And thy heart around thee sheds
Fragrance of the flower of love !
Give thee up I never can,
And this singing?s at best but a paltry plan ;
Roseleaf! what sweeter theme
Could all the muses nine suggest to lover thine!
Roseleaf! Loveliest dream
That poesy could lend us mankind to refine.
All Roseleaf! What sweeter theme, &c.
Lord C. Hurrah for Prettyboy !
Queen There?s no denial
That so far we?ve had only half a trial.
A second trial will give them nuts to crack,
A good long Winder case with J. B, Slack.
Enter Humpty Dumpty.
King. Now, who are you, sir? Sure I know you not.
He?s not like Giorza, nor a bit like Schott.
Marching through Georgia one is they say,
Unless in New South Wales he means to stay.
Hump. A musical professor from the East;
I bring a contribution to your feast, ?
This roll of music.


King Looks a pretty piece?
Whoe?er can sing it he shall wed my niece.
Here, Prettyboy, this will your soul delight,
Tou?ve often said that you can sing at sight.
Pretty. How?s this ? the music staggers a good deal,
And yet it dosen?t look much like a reel.
?Pis all confusion, and each note is dying
As though to play at leap-frog it were trying.
Bose. Perhaps a hunting chorus with light weights,
And semi-quavers jumping dve-barred gates.
Toicks! Tally ho!
Pretty. No, no ! Upon my word,
It doesn?t tally, oh, with aught I?ve heard.
Tol. I fear the song is quite beyond my pitch.
Boub. Here, let me see it, I know which is which,
And what is what; and also who is who.
I?d like to see the song I can?t get through,
Mozart, and Handel, Offenbach, Lecocq,
It?s only ? AYaxworks? music that?s no joke,?
Hump. Oh ! pray don?t give yourself much further trouble,
Perhaps, my little boy, you?re seeing double.
Boub. Oh, my poor head!
Queen You give it up, as well ?
Pretty. This seems to me to be a downright ? sell!?
Hump. But I can sing the music ; and I claim
The hand of Princess Boseleaf for the same.
Bose. My hand! Impossible! I?d sooner wed
Tom Noddy, who is nothing else but head.
Hump. lam the great?but never mind !
Pretty. Don?t speak,
There?s nothing great about you but your cheek.
Hump. I?m not the big O?Shan
Pretty. I didn?t doubt it,
Oh ! Shanna say then any more about it.
King Don't Joachim, there?s a dear, he can?t see fun, ?
Why, Balfour would as soon detect a pun.
Bose. I?m feeling faint!
Pretty. Caused by that dwarfish man.
Bose. Oh, here?l?ll use this fern leaf for a fan.
Hump. Ah! ah! That fern leaf! where can she have
got it ?
It?s just my luck that in her hands I spot it.
I now remember that in such a case
I?m bound to give the lady three day?s grace;
But I return to claim you, lovely miss,


At midnight, on the second day from this.
King Can none of you boys sing the song ?
Boub. Not quite.
King Then all I?ve got to say is?serves you right !
You cannot sing it; that?s what me annoys,
Consider yourselves all kicked out, my boys !
SONG- AND CHORUS ?Aik.?? Chanson Politique/'
(From La Fillo do Madame Angot.)
(Boosey and Co , London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
King. The great King Arthur had three sons?
Big rogues, ?twas said, as e?er did swing;
Tie kicked them all out of his court,
Because he found they could not sing.
Tol. No appealing from one so high ;
So out we go, the brothers three;
Scarcely time we?ve to say good-bye,
Yet bow we so humbly to royal decree.
King. For I the king am a perfect brick,
The head of the body politic ;
Who?d gainsay that?s a lunatic!
And so say all of us.
All For he the king, &c.
Rose Yet uncle, pray, some pity show?
The Princes three have done no harm ;
Recall the word that bids them go,
Nor with your anger me alarm.
Tol. Stake tremendous we?ve now to play?
At least the thought to me occurs,
Best depart all the lovers gay,
For if he show his hand, we?re sure to lose hers.
All So he the king, &c.
Boub. Oh, dear mamma! your darling son,
You?ll ne'er allow to take his hook!
King. For once King Arthur won?t be done,
Boub. Then Boubee feels himself forsook !
Here?s an innocent lamb sent out,
Unshorn to tempt the cruel world;
And we?re never allow?d to doubt
The wisdom of being so suddenly hurl?d.
For he the king is a perfect?hie ;
The heady of the body?body ?hie ;
Who?d gainsay that is a luna.tic,
And so say all of us.
All For he the king, &c.
Scene V.?The Border, or a Marsh.
Enter Will o? the Wisp.
Will Ha ! none can catch Will o? the Whist so keen,
The downiest little card that e?er was seen;
The whole detective force has often chased me,
But like some runaways , have never traced me,


Barring O'Farrell, that Lands office swell,
Who?s on his road to Gastieau's Hotel.
My latest piece of mischief is you see
That Humpty?s placed his confidence in me,
But when the time arrives, he will my word,
Find out I?ve sold him, sold him like a Bird, ?
For I?m in fairy pay ! Oh, aint it folly ?
I can?t help laughing, it?s so very jolly ?
SONG. ? Aik. ?? I?m the Nig that's always Laughing."
(Hopwood and Crew, London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
No, I really can?t help laughing ?
He?s so very green ;
I can scarce refrain from chaffing
Him about our Fairy Queen.
For I know that she?s a mind to
Trip him up in splendid style,
And I often feel inclined to
Thus indulge in one sweet smile.
Ha! ha! ha! &c.
Oh! it is such jolly fun?
That I really can?t help laughing, &c. Exit.
Enter Pbetttboy, Tol db Eol, and Boubee.
Pretty. Kick?d out!
Tol. Kick?d out!
Boub. Kick?d out! Oh, my poor head !
Tol. For a living we must work,
Pretty. Or hungry go.
Boub. Hungry ? No tarts, no jam, oh don?t say so.
Pretty. I see no other prospect. Hand-in-hand,
We?ll go at once and join the eight hours band, ?
The strike is over, let?s on Fulton wait.
Boub. A full ton ! Why, that?s twenty hundred weight.
Tol. We?ve been kicked out, and now we?re locked out.
Pretty. Hold!
King Arthur?s sons, as we?re by history told?
Were known as miller, weaver, tailor bold.
As such we?ll travel.
Tol. You?re no miller !
Pretty. Still,
I?ve taken part in many a college ? mill.?
That?s settled then.
Tol. What?s Tol de Eol to do ?
Boub. I see the weaver looming up for you.
And I?ll be tailor.
Pretty, Very little use;
You?d do much better as the tailor's goose.


Boub. That?s irony !
Pretty. At once we?ll go on tramp,
And find the means to check that dwarfish scamp.
Enter Feen Faiey. Exit.
Fern F. This Humpty Dumpty, bogle of the bogs,
So well envelopes all the place in fogs,
These marshy exhalations pierce each sense,
The mists of ignorance are not more dense, ?
I?ll know why he sends this upon the land,
Appear then, Humpty Dumpty, I command.
Enter Humpty.
Vile mannikin, your schemes are known to me,
And Roseleaf I?m determined shall be free
From all your snares.
Hump. Although I know the might of you,
I swear within three days she?s mine, in spite of you !
Fern F. You dare to tell me this, your wicked scheme,
Then I will baulk your horrifying dream, ?
Back to your kennel, dog! nor dare appear
In that same form, but one more strangely queer!
Nor be yourself again, in marsh or bower,
?Till pretty Roseleaf is beyond your power I
Exit Humpty.
His short comings want a long repentance;
I?ll calm my feelings ere I pass his sentence.
Enter Maidenhaie.
Dear Maidenhair, keep watch while I?m away.
Maid. Tour orders to the letter I?ll obey.
Exit Feen Faiey.
Enter Tol de Rol.
Tol. Ah ! a pretty fairy, don?t run away.
Maid. Oh, dear no ; I?m not going to, never fear !
Tol. A happy thought!?to pass the time, my dear,
Will you join me in a dance and song.
Maid. Oh, sir ! with pleasure.
Tol. So happy! Come along!
Double song and dance , by the Misses Maggie and
Nellie Stewaet.
Re-enter Feen Faiey.
Fern F. What form upon this dwarf shall I impose ?
I?ll summon him from his prolonged repose,
In shape most comical of all my whims.
Come forth, deprived of body and of limbs.
Enter Humpty.
No longer can you be a source of dread:


Acknowledge sir, I?ve brought things to a head!
Your are, since I have taken you in hand,
Ci-devant member of the Head Quarters? Band.
By dint of twisting him all up, and crumpling,
I?ve made him now a sort of Humpty Dumpling!
Hump. Into what small dimensions have I shrunk!
How can I travel thus, without a trunk ?
I?d soon be having toothache in my toes.
Bern F. You?ll go all right by following your nose ;
Oh ! what a Great head , there?s no denying
OreatJiead's remedy I have been trying.
You see you've learnt the way to run already.
Hump. I must say that Ido feel rather head;/.
Ah ! Eoseleaf said she?d rather wed Tom Neddy,
Grcathead, all head, and alas no-hody ! Exit.
Fern F. And now I?ve ended with this demon false,
I?ll soothe my feelings with a song and waltz.
SONG- AND DANCE.?Am?? Vintage Feast.?
(Cramer and Co., London, and W. H. Glen and Co., Melbourne.)
Now the changing is ended,
Of this demon so false,
I?ll drown gloomy feelings,
With a song and a waltz.
The glade shall be resounding,
With dance, music,?and song ;
One hour of mirth and delight
Shall the brief time yet prolong.
Now the Fern Fairy?s heart is glad,
Only Humpty that still repines ;
Why should anyone else be sad,
He well merits his hard lines.
By changing to this head,
I have stopp?d his little game,
And no more need here be said,
Happiness now is my sole aim.
And no more need now be said?
My happiness, happiness, now my only aim,
And happiness, happiness, my only aim.
Ah, ah.
Now the changing, &c. Exit.
Scene Vl.?The Magic Garden.
Enter Eoseleaf.
Oh ! what a lovely garden, this can?t be
The Carlton Gardens fam?d in history;
Where nursemaids with their charges love to roam,
And th? untimely kitten finds a home.
Here, nature pours her treasures at my feet,


The pretty flowers with odours fresh and sweet!
Sing on, sweet bird! love?s own melodious lute :
Sing thus for aye; or be for ever mute !
Breathe to my soul the whispers from afar
Of Prettyboy whose messenger you are;
Meanwhile will I, to check my heart?s fond chidings,
Beeline on yonder bank and drink thy tidings.
Enter Prettyboy. Exit.
Pretty. Was it a dream P yet in jmy ears ?tis ringing ;
I thought I heard my Eoseleaf sweetly singing.
No, after all the idea?s quite absurd,
It must have been a native singing bird.
The place is full of birds, it?s what I call
Nice, but a little orni-thological.
The Officer of Health and our Town Clerk,
Both swear its sweeter than the Fawkner Park ;
That fragrant spot which Melbourne Corporation,
Have tried to make the bouquet of the nation.
Enter Fern Fairy.
Presiding deity of garden rare,
I do beseech your kind and yuardian care ;
For my dear Eoseleaf.
Fern F. , That she may rely on,
For every kind of flower I keep my eye on ;
I shield the little ones from weather showery,
And e?en protect potatoes when they?re flowery,
As you?re a miller and to Eoseleaf true.
Tour flowery nature makes me kind to you
Pretty. A flowery miller, Eamsden, p?raps, or Dight,
A Money Miller's Capital to fight.
You know our story then ?
Fern F. Much more beside.
?Twas I gave three days grace to save your bride,
And now, to add one boon more to the number ?
Behold her as she rises fresh from slumber.
Enter Eoseleaf.
Eose. My Prettyboy! -
Pretty. Eoseleaf! in this disguise!
Eose. I?m not astonished, dear, at your surprise,
I felt afraid to wear it, do not doubt;
But in no other way could I get out.
Fern F. Quite right.
Eose. ?Tis you o?erwatches my concerns?
I know you now, sweet Fairy of the Ferns !
Fern F. Quite right again; and now to give advice ;


You, sir, will seek the fire king in a trice,
And ere he can betake him from the spot,
Produce this leaf.
Pretty. Well, I?d as lief as not.
Pern P, Demand of magic melody the key,
And for the rest, refer the sprite to me.
Pretty. About my safety, dear, feel no alarm,
The thought that it?s for thee will nerve my arm
To hew my way through dangers thick and fierce,
E?en through the Geelong streets alone to pierce,
The wilderness of Government House to roam,
That house that frightened Lady Bowen home !
Enter Will.
But n?importe, all will join me in a chorus,

When I present myself before King Flambeau !

And gain me by his singing, my heart goes with my hand,
But in my ears still ringing will be his accents bland ;
While he is meeting with the warm King Flambeau !

For a little malice I can scarcely hide,
With his feelings callous I could never side ;

Queen Who?d be a queen 1 wonder ?
King To be by partner of the throne kept under.


Queen My cheerful curtain lectures set at nought.
King Vice Royalty driven away to Bishop?s Court.
Queen To have to fight to keep the upper hand.
King Oh ! this is something I?m not going to stand.
Queen Sir!
King Madam!
Queen I am in the way, I fear ?
Both Why couldn?t you have said that you were here!
Queen Well; I?m the letter half, and so I?ll rule.
King It is that better half that plays the fool,
Stops all our beer from Saturday to Monday,
And shuts up the Museums on a Sunday,
Locks up the books, calls all men wicked sinners,
And then go home themselves to well cook?d dinners.
Enter Roseleaf.
But who is this young swell ?
Rose (aside) Uncle and aunt!
Oh ! here?s a fix ! retreat I surely can?t.
(aloud) I?m Roseleaf, uncle.
King What the young Princess ?
Queen And been a masquerading in that dress ?
King She wears the moleskins with a jaunty carriage,?
They?re things you shouldn?t wear till after marriage.
Queen I never did ?myself on that I plume.

Hoping to find her in the palace free, ?
United once our joys will never sever.
True lovers we, our motto is for ever.
SONG-?Aib. ?? Walking in the Starlight
Pretty In Fitzroy Gardens walking, listening to the band,
With darling little Eoseleaf by my side ;
No one hears our talking?linking hand to hand,
Swearing both to love whate?er betide.
Nursemaid?s are a flirting with the soldiers bold,
Gazing on their uniforms with pride ;
Fountains are a-squirting on the fish of gold,
Looking all, on nature?s sunnyside.
Oh yes, with ecstacy I glowed,
For she lives down in Simpson?s Koad;
She vowed she?d meet me any night
Near the ? Waxworks of Kreitmayer,?
Where they dress the beaux in rare old clothes,
For Bourke street to admire.


Enter Roseleaf.
Rose. So soon returned P

Boub, Here, I say, mother?
Don?t cuddle me like that, or I shall smother!
Rose. Your presence fills your ma with so much joy.
Queen How have you fared since yesterday, dear boy!
Boub. I tried to be a tailor; I regret
To say I hav?nt learnt the business yet.
Queen Then join the kirk?better than nothing doing,
And get served out like the Reverend Mr. Ewing.
Enter Tol de Rol.
Tol. In vulgar parlance tell me what?s the row ?
Boub. Look here?we?ve all come home together, now ;
Queen If Boubee goes, the others do.
King Agreed.
The lot must then absquatulate, with speed.
Boub. Don?t send us to a place we?re not prepared for,
But put us somewhere where we shall be cared for;
Where board and residence is more than nice.

SONG AND CHORUS.?Air.?? Ten Thousand Miles away."

Pretty Singing, justice is but a jolly lark,
And punishment is too ;
Singing, oh for a jolly Judge to Cope,
With a jolly larrikin crew.
With the pranks of a larrikin crew, my boys !
Which Robertson calls play;
If they flogged the band, swore he?d be off hand,
Ten thousand miles away !
Then blow the winds high oh ! from Austral shores
he'll go,


High Church! Weechurch ! never more
W e?ll hear the parson pray !
May all of the same vein, across the ragin? main,
Be taking a trip in a P. and O. Ship,
Ten thousand miles away!
Chorus ?Then blow the winds, &e.
Rose Singing, oh for a clean and a lively cell,
And a suit of greyish hue ;
Singing, oh for the very best tucker, and
A little work to do.
For it?s then I take my ease brave boys,
And pass away the day ;
For I?m doing the grand in a distant land,
Ten thousand miles away!
Chorus, ?We crack the stones so ho! as slow as we can go ;
A rare old joke is the government stroke,
It's done just in this way.

All demon powers of mischief now assemble,
Whose presence might make stoutest mortals tremble.
The fire bell rings, your motto is sic semper,
Get out your shirts, but don?t get out of temper ;
Clap on your helmets quick, and, as the phrase is,
Put on a spurt, and off you go to blaze's !
Turn on the Yan Yean, ?tis cheap enough, my mates,
Coppin and Anderson reduced the rates.
But first of all, my tribe, that little scamp
Will o? the Wisp shall burn his midnight lamp.

Flam. ?Tis well, my little spark;
But what is this advancing in the dark ?

And now, behold how well I?m making head way.
Will It?s Humpty Dumpty !
Flam. Guest of t?other night!
Where have you left your body, little wight ?
Hump. It?s neither left nor right ; but I?d enquire,
Why we are summoned thus to trudge through mire ?
Is this assemblage for the sake of greeting ?


Or, is?t to be a fireman?s torchlight meeting ?
Come, let me know.
Flam. Ton shall. Within yon ruins
My subjects dance to most enchanting tuins.
The time for revelry has now arrived,
Behold my swarm of bees who won?t be hived.
We all are now prepared for your narration
How came about this bodiless creation !
Hump. By Fairy of the Fern I have been shorn
And made a thing for laughter and for scorn,
Because the Princess I aspired to wed.
Flam. A fitting tale for such a frightful head
Of course we?ll have revenge, for that we burn.
Have her cremated by Professor Urn.
Humpty, away to court and claim your bride.

Oh! spare my life, old colonist, I pray!
Ham. be off then on your way!
Boub. Would I could reach my stead, my faithful Ned !
Flam. Be off at once then, sir!
Boub. Oh ! my poor head.
Exit Boubee.
Flam. Ha! ha ! I?m in a merry humour quite,
When I remember that grand spree last night.
We drank the best of McNamara?s ales ;
Excelsior the brand?it never fails.
We smoked cigars too strong for human dandies,
Took wines of best fire brands, and best fire brandies.
The fiery blood still through my veins is glancing,
My head is spinning to with all that dancing.
Enter Peexttboy.
Pretty. I?ll take it kindly?when you?ve had jouvfiing,
If you?ll but lead me to the great Fire King.
Flam. None of your ifs ?the butts are going away.
Pretty. The Eifle butts ?
Flam. Bifol- de riddle la!
I know the gent whose residence you?re seeking,
But I see two of you boys ?which was speaking ?
All right?there?s only one of you, my beauty.
This comes of both eyes being upon duty.
Suppose I bring you to the Fire King?s lair,
What might you wish ?
Pretty. I seek a Wandering heir.
Flam. Then go to Sunbury or Digger?s Eest.
It must be caught before it can be dressed,
See ? Mrs. Glass on Cookery.?
Pretty. I?m thinking
That any one can see through glass, like winking,
So now to catch the air! Behold the spell,
To make you soon that little secret tell, ?
A fairy summons, clear as journal leaf.
Flam. In fern leaf couched ! where got you that infernal
leaf?
Pretty. From Queen of Fairy Ferns !
Flam. Well, then, I?m booked ;
So list and learn how magic air was cooked !
DUET.?Air. ?? Ancient .?
Flam. In a box where the demon fires did burn,
A sort of ancient brazen urn ;
Surrounded by a fiendish glare,


'Twaa there we cook?d up the magic air !
Pretty Magic air! magic air! magic air !
Both In a box, &c.
Pretty Oh, I see what before I?d overlook?d,
?Twas then by the fire of genius cook?d,
And turned out one of those light and gay
Tricks a jolly pal takes away.
Flam. TaKes away! Takes away ! Takes away !
Both Oh ) \ see what before, &c.
I you)
Exit Peettybot.
Re-enter Botjbee.
Flam. What back again my boy, now for a smasher.
Boub. Oh, spare my bacon, don?t be rasher 1
Flam. A rash-ah !
Boub. I met the meazles with the local force.
Flam. You mizzled then, you precious fool, of course ?
You have a measly look, but come along,
Don?t mind the local farce, let?s local song.
Topical Song, Flambeau, and Boubee.
Scene IY. ?Quicksilver Hall.
Enter King, Queen, Humpty, Lords, Sfc.
Hump. I?ve kept my word, and come to claim my bride,
Eose. Had you not done so, I should ne?er have cried, ?
Though changed in form your presence threatens
danger,
So pray be gone, unwelcome little stranger !
Hump. Your beauty?s greater than politeness, miss.
Eose. And must Ibe the slave of thing like this ?
Be like a Derby race won by a head !
And to a Mr. No-body be wed P
Eose. Till twelve o?clock I?m free by fairy power.
Hump. Oh, scissors ! don?t she know the very hour.
King. Until it strikes you?d better leave the hall.
Hump. I?ll take my seat upon the outer wall,
And watch that silent clock at the Town Hall.
When from the Heads the telegram arrives,
This head from off the wall that moment dives.
Enter Tol de Eol.
Fol. The search is useless I regret to say,
All sorts of airs I?ve heard the organ play,
To Trebizondic music listen?d rather,
And even kept ? one eye upon my father !?
Polka and hymn, schottische and fandango,
And all the tunes from ? Fille de Madame Angot !?


The cooeys of the dove of Ararat,
The dulcet tones of Smith of Ballarat,
Set in a major, sung in a miner key,
At tailoresses meeting after tea.
But nothing like the tune can I obtain.
Enter Boubeb.
Queen My darling child !
Boub. I?ve found the lost refrain!
Enter Peetttbot singing magic air.
Hump. Ten thousand furies ! whence, sir, did you bring
it ?
It?s copyright!
Rose. But he may safely sing it.
Boub. Get it arranged for flageolet and tambo.
Hump. What?s the composer?s name p
Pretty. The Fire King Flambeau !
Rose. That knell proclaims your doom at hand!
Hump. Bad luck!
The midnight strike, all of a heap I?m struck.
CONSPIRATORS CHORUS.?(From La Fille de Madame Angot.)
All Little Humpty Dumpty sat upon a wall,
Little Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,
And all the king?s horses, and all the king?s men,
Cannot place him as he was again.
All the king?s horses, and all his men,
Can?t set the mannikin up again ;
And the number of the men is a thousand and ten,
Who can?t set him up again?up again.
King To drag him from the base of outer wall
My household troops of girls and boys pray call.
Enter Peek Faiet.
Fern F. Just now I met the army, right and left wing,
Coming to pay their homage to the king,?
Enter Ballet as Troops.
CHORUS. ? Air.? ? Let the Hills Resound."
(Cocks and Co., London, and W. H. G-len and Co., Melbourne.)
All From the hills and valleys green,
Where the stoutest forms are seen,
And stoutest hearts hold valor dear ;
We come the free!
Wer?e good King Arthur?s band,
And we guard our native land,
While loudly we do cheer,
With a one, two, three !
Left then right our feet move to the fight,
On grand parade on esplanade?
It?s all the same! �


At duty?s call we march from Monarch?s Hall?
To gory field, our breath to yield,
For warrior?s fame.
From the the hills, &c.
GRAND MARCH.
Scene Y.?A Fern Tree Glen.
Enter Will o? the Wisp.
Will I?ve told our Queen of Humpty?s jolly fall,
And didn?t she enjoy the news ?that?s all!
How off the wall that Dumpty chap was tossed,
While playing heads and tails, ?twas heads he lost.
I?m off at present o?er the marshy soil,
To guide some laborers from their evening toil ;
They get such paltry pay, yet work so hard,
Like Bent, I?m their great agricultural card.
The ace of spades who sticks up for his pard?ners,
The Brighton and Moorabbin Market Gard?ners.
Enter Bern Fairy. Exit
Fern F. My ferny home I visit once again?
So far from all the busy haunts of men ;
Here will I rest. Grave business of the nation,
Undertakers charges and cremation
Shan?t bother me. Matters per Apps to Sleight
For Daley cogitation. Fays delight
To wander through these groves, enjoy their pleassure,
And foot it with their mates in lively measures.
Enter King Arthur and Knights. Exit.
King I must eat something, and that pretty good,
Three mortal days I?ve been deprived of food.
Phys. Tour Majesty, your health must be observed,
King Not under your regime, ?tis undeserved.
One globule daily, I?m a very lath,
A surer road I?ll find, than homo e-path;
Would Cod Liver Oil do any good I wonder ?
Phys. Williamson?s Struck Oil,
King They did by thunder!
You understand ?
hys. Most perfectly.
Enter Boubee.
King But where
Is our Lord Chancellor ?


Boub. He?s with the Mayor,
Arranging banquets at which to fete us,
Closeted with A. K. Smith and Gatehouse.
At some boards we get Sunbury wine in puncheons,
Cheap substitute for Hock at some folks? luncheons.
King I don?t like blow outs, blow me if I do,
Where Murray Wines takes place of Number Two.
Ente r Pretttbot, Roseleae, and Tol de Rol,
Boub. Here?s Prettyboy with Roseleaf by his side.
Oh wouldn?t she look stunning as my bride ;
Don?t she look scrumptious, so unlike those dollies,
The Rose and Bud of England! Duffy?s follies.
In our Art Gallery so precious grand,
Where everything but frames are second-hand.
She looks so nice, like ? Docy ? as ? Zanetta,?
No ? Waxwork?s ? beauty ever could look better.
I?ll wed a Melbourne girl with lots of tin,
People are here best thought of when well in.
Enter Humptt Dtjmptt restored to former shape.
King The fairy?s spell has vanished,
Pretty ?ts so when
We thus behold, Humpty?s himself again !
Rose. Would I could cast a spell with just one look;
Hump. Don?t take a leaf from her vile spelling book;
{snatches fern.)
{aside) A leaf I?ve taken, and will take again,
Erench leaf, I mean, as taken by Bazaine.
This fern at anyrate may prove my friend,
And arm?d with it, I?ll make proud Roseleaf bend.
King {to Pretty.) I now proclaim, my merry little shaver,
The singing competition in your favor.
Pretty. Those magic crochets were my Roseleaf young
The most successful notes I ever sung.
King Good boy!
Tol, A credit you to your re-Z�-tiyes.
Rose. There?s nothing like encouraging the natives.
Boub. Goddard again ; so home we?d best be heading,
And make our preparations for the wedding.
Hump. Here comes King Elambeau, now you?ll eat the
leek.
Enter Elambeau.
Whence comes your Majesty ?
Elam. Erom Brandy Creek,
Trying to get land without hattle-m his
Most Royal leave to pay land rent or taxes.


Hot-hard we rode hero as we came along,
I put Dobs-on Casey pretty Strong.
I?ve been up free selecting that?s a fact,
Trying my hardest to evade the act.
Everyone does it now, so why not I, ?
You don?t know what you may do till you try.
Enter Feen Faiet.
Fern F, But then the residence clause, you must reside.
Flam. In my case the residence clause was set aside.
I scrupled before making it a sham,
But for my scruples Casey didn?t care a -dram !
Boub. Brandy Creek is my place for selection,
Can Hennessy here real grounds for objection.
Fern F. Enough of Dobson and Professor Strong,
Let?s pull ourselves together in a song.
'SONG- AND CHORUS. ?Am. ??Pull Yourselves Together."
Fern F. The wedding day for them is near,
Were here to wish them joy,
A sunny fortune may theirs be,
Eoseleaf and Prettyboy.
May every happiness be their?s
In Hymen?s silken tether,
And in the ups and downs of life,
Both pull along together.
Yes, dear friends, just pull along together ;
Love?s strong ties how hard to break the tether ;
Fate may frown, all may not be fair weather,
But sure the tide will turn at last.
All All old friend?s, let's pull along together,
Friendship?s ties how hard to snap the tether,
True through all however rough the weather ;
Trust that the tide will turn at last.
Scene Vl.?The Demon Glen.
Enter Humptt Dumptt and Will o? the Wisp.
Hump. What trickery?s this the Fire King?s playing ?
His promised reinforcements thus delaying ?
If he breaks faith with us, our last resource
Is getting Stubbs to bring his ? local force.?
Will {aside) I?ve led them round about.
Hump. I can?t keep cool,
He almost told me that I was a fool,
Heap?d insults on me which I like a lamb bore , ?
Is he a real king now or a mere sham-bore !
Will. Can?t say, he?s not a boor born you can see ;
A reg?lar warm?un all find him to be.
Hump. Is he the Fire King P May I now enquire
Who cooked his chops inside the house on fire ?


P?r?aps lie?s the Great Mogul.
Will. Be aisy,
He is a greater Monarch than King Casey.
Hump Ho matter which ; this Fire King much I doubt;
I?ll bring the engines, they?ll soon put him out.
Will Don?t be so foolish or your life is gone,
You take my word, he won?t b q played upon!
No more than the great Organ, which, my boy,
We all now find is such an unused toy.
Hump. We?ll change the subject please. My power
returns,
And love for Roseleaf once more in me burns, ?
Talking of burning though, that fairy leaf
Is now in my possession.
Will. Oh! the thief!
Hump. Flambeau has plunged it in his furnace hot,
?Tis now the sear'd and yellow ?you know what.
So does the fairy power deflect, and mine?s
In the ascendant now, as their?s declines.
Will. The same occurs in things political.
E?en Kerferd?s post is sometimes critical,
We?ve lost our Francis. His place Kerferd fills,
Re-Kerferd may he soon be from his ills.
Hump. Oh, blow your politics, I?ll Roseleaf wed
In spite of ferns and flowers and all they?ve said.
The latest she shall have in Leghorn flops,
Lead buttons everywhere and kangaroo hops, ?
Such strange in-kangarooity of .dress
Is sure to captivate my pet princess. Exit.
Enter Kino, Queen, Peettboy, Roseleae, Tol be Rol, Sfc.
Rose. The further we advance the more we?re lost,
Suppose we take a car at any cost ?
Pretty. Or try the outer circle line for fun.
King It?s Hobson?s choice, that line we?ll have or none.
Lord C. Take the steam-roller or the sav?loy bus.
King Some persons Hobson?s line prefer?not us,
Unless we do as the directors can,
Avoid the crush by riding in the van.
Enter Botjbee, staggering.
Boubee?s coming back by stealth.
Queen Where have you been ?
Boub. Been drinking the brides? health.
Enter Humpty Dumpty with Demons,
Hump. Too long the lot of them have been at large,
I?ll give the wedding party all in charge ;


From Pewters now to Pewtress go they ought,
And up before great Sturt, P. M., be brought,
Boub. Yes, take ?em off.
Eose. Again that horrid dwarf!
The fern leaf, Prettyboy?when that he sees,
We shall escape his malice and with ease.
Pretty. I had it yesterday, and now ?
Hump. Behold!
Your leaf is blasted, and you both are sold !
Enter Fern Fairy and Will o? the Wisp.
Fern F. No, you are sold ! and at my feet shall cower,
Who dares dispute decree of fairy power ?
Who dares to scorch and wither my dear leaves P
Which act the whole of Fairydom now grieves.
That little leaf was symbol of my love.
Pretty. It was a symbol little leaf, by Jove!
Fern F. There?s nothing now your presence here requires ,
{to Demons ) Eeturn to your foul den, ?midst Christ-
mas fires.
{to Hump.) With such a wretch I scarce know what
to do,
I?ve tried my hand before at changing you,
I?ll try it once again?you know your doom ;
And all shall pass through transformation loom,
Which weaves anew the thread of this our story
Investing it with quite another glory.
FINALE.? Air.' ?? Legende de Mere Angot .?
Fern F. E?en Fairies have the feeling,
At this the festive season,
That they should be appealing,
To test of human reason.
King And Monarch?s bow to people?s voice,
When them it much concerns ;
Fern F. Then show you?re pleased, and ?twill rejoice
The Fairy of the Ferns.
Hands so merrily, hands so verily,
Grace the transformation time !
Hands so thoroughly, hands so cheerily,
Help a Christmas Pantomime! Hands, &c.
Will Althongh this dwarf is smallish,
And very much is thumpt. He
Has feelings that are squallish,
So pity Humpty Dumpty. \
Boub. I? 11 sing the ancient rhyme?so droll?
Oft heard in Christmas play,
Hic-up! tol-01, hic-up ! tol-ol!
Tol-01-101-lay!
Hands so merrily, hands so verily,


Grace the transfsrmation time!
Will Hands so thoroughly, hands so cheerily,
Help a Christmas Pantomime !
Pretty. Prettyhoy begs the favour
(!f learning your kind pleasure ;
?Twill make him each night braver,
And please him beyond measure.
Rose. And Roseleaf too would beg the same
Assurance at your hands,
For well she knows the need of fame
Secured by your commands !
Hands so merrily, hands so verily,
Grace the transformation time!
Rose. Hands so thoroughly, hands so cheerily,
Help a Cristmas Pantomime ! Hands.
Grand Transformation Scene.
A GOOD CHILD?S VISION OF FAIRYLAND-
A Little Fairy comes at night
Her eyes are blue, her hair is brown.
With silver spots upon her wings,
And from the moon she flutters down.
She has a little silver wand.
And when a good child goes to bed
She waves her hand from right to left,
And makes a circle round its head;
And then it dreams of pleasant things.
Enter Feen Fairy.
Fern F. This is my realm and I need not delay
The Pantomimic fun that?s in your way ;
Here Fairy Hennings spell bound holds you fast,
Who every year exceeds in skill the last.
You, Pretty boy, a new career begin,
And make a hit once more as Harlequin.
Prince Eoseleaf, too, this charming bride of thine,
Shall still be dear to you as Columbine.
Enter Flambeau.
Flam. Stay, young lady, don?t you know that I
A finger must have in this Christmas pie.
In your head Boubee there are brains that soon
May serve for those of doddling Pantaloon.
You, Humpty, go and add to your renown,
As comic, crowing, capering Christmas Clown.
Fern F. And now to aid you in your gay delights,
Appear my spangled, sparkling, sprightly sprites;
Show all your pranks, keep up the good old story,
And please the right good people here before ye.
