The BLACK MARKET IS THE TRAIROT'S
Do you like the Idea of criminal racketeers making
huge profits out of OUR THE PEOPLE’S war
for freedom and
decent living stan-
dards? Do yon like
YOU may be offered a suit
length, a dress, a shirt,
stockings or under-
clothing without coupons.
And you may be tempted to
ask yourself “How would I
injure the war effort if I
bought these?”
Well, this is how! Coupons
are meant to ensure that
stocks—because of the short-
age-go round fairly.
Whatever clothing is sold
without coupons means less
for the rest of us for
workers in essential indus-
tries, for women and chil-
dren. Or if stocks must be
replaced it means wasted
manpower. Thus war pro-
duction is set back and the
boys at the front deprived of
much needed supplies
Look at these:
• .CONVICTION BY A MAGISTRATE
Individuals: No less than 3 months
gaol; and a maximum of 12 months.
Companies: No less than a £lOOO fine
and a maximum of £5OOO.
• CONVICTION BY A JURY
Individuals: No less than 12 months
gaol; and no limit to gaol period.
Companies; No less than £lO,OOO fine
and no limit to amount of fine.
Why so drastic?
Well, wouldn’t YOU be drastic if you
caught a Jap. spy operating in our
midst? A spy and a black marketer
are two of a kind.
Both serve the enemy. Black market-
ing is one of the most insidious crimes
that can be committed against a nation
at war.
MARKET
toe wea of black market betrayal oar war
effort? You don’t? Neither does the Government. That’s
why it introduced a special Act to punish Black Marketers
with drastic penalties.
In Fascist countries, black marketers
are shot.
We cannot afford to be tolerant herd
The BUYER of black market goods is
just as guilty as the SELLER. Black
markets can’t survive if we the
PEOPLE—don’t feed them. Exchange
or sale of Ration Books, sheets of
coupons or loose coupons is equally
criminal.
If you know Black Marketing exists,
don’t say it is none of your business.
It IS your business. It is your DUTY
to report these traitorous offences to
the Rationing Commission with the
same readiness as you would report the
activities of a spy in our midst. Black
marketing often is the work of fifth-
columnists. Don’t fall for it!
STRANGLE BLACK MARKETS.
SEND YOUR MONEY TO WAR—BUY BONDS


Doesn’t it mean that i can’t buy as many
street clothes as the office worker?
That’s so. But and this is important your street
clothes will last you twice as long. He has to wear HIS
all day at work you don’t.
Why have some of my mates been issued
with extra coupons?
For a very good reason. They NEED them. Don’t con-
fuse NEED with WANT. The wear on their clothes is
EXCEPTIONALLY heavy. Without an extra issue they
would be at a disadvantage compared with you.
Remember S yyj Clothing—Babies’, Children’s,
Working and Street Clothes—come from the same stocks
—depleted by the war. If YOU get more than you
need, a fellow worker—somewhere—is deprived of essen-
tial requirements.
TELL
ME
Why must
I give cou-
pons for
working
clothes?
Because there can be no privileged sec-
tion. If you got working clothes coupon
free, every office worker and shop assis-
tant would be entitled to the same privi-
lege for the clothes he wears at work.
Why are working clothes at
half the coupon rating of
ordinary clothes?
Because industrial and rural workers
wear out more garments than the office
worker. Without this concession they
would be at a disadvantage.

Rationing is a Home Front job. The boys in uniform
can fight and die for you, but they can’t make rationing
work.
AND UNLESS RATIONING WORKS, UNLESS YOU
MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO CONSERVE ... TO SAVE
MATERIALS AND MANPOWER . . . ONLY HALF THE
NATION IS FIGHTING.
You can:
★ Make old clothes last by proper treatment, by
mending, remodelling, renovating.
★ Plan your buying.
★ Refuse to spend coupons unless you MUST.
★ Economise in the use of essential foodstuffs.
Your newspapers and magazines often carry valuable
hints. Heed them.
A booklet called “New Clothes from Old” is on the market
to guide you in your clothes renovations.

Something Needed Something done

Chaos ?
Twelve months ago Australia had to
make this choice. We were faced
with the most acute clothing short-
age in our History ....
£ Ships’ cargoes changed from
peace-time luxuries to urgently
needed weapons of war..
0 Factories began to work all-out
on military orders...
0 Manpower was switched to vital
war work.
What did this mean? Clothing
Shortage . . . Not enough for all on
the old basis.
Chaos Stared Vs

You had a taste of it in the panic-
buying period.
You Probably Went Without—while
others grabbed all they could—and
more than they needed.
Something had to be done —quickly
—for your protection. So you were
issued with a Ration Book.
It gives you a fair share of available
supplies. It is a symbol of planned
distribution of organised produc-

Keep This as a Guide
You may be required to register with
a retailer to obtain rationed goods.
Registration slips are in pages 14

The War alone is responsible for Rationing. Re-

necessity. You may have heard grumblers talk of
