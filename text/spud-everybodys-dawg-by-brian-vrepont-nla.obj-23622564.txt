DAWG-


INTRODUCTION.
It affords me very real pleasure to assist in
the presentation of this volume. I have long "been
conscious of the loss occasioned lovers of verse
in not having been privileged to know the extent
of Nr.vrepcnt 1 s art, as in some measure I myself
have seen privileged. With this collection goes
a further measure of that versatility which will
i relieve make itself apparent in the near future,
I,'ir. Vrepont has dealt here only with some of those
rare ingenuities of which he is so surprisingly
capable, and, in accepting this hook, it is safe
to. assume the public will find more than ordinarily
the worth of the authors fine penetration.
I believe that "SPUD" and "MARJORIE ANN" will
establish themselves with affection wherever they
go.

"SPUD".
Please note that the following errors have
crept into the verses:-
Page 4, line 2 should read* "stick"
" 10, " 10 tr " "we palled"
" 13, last line " « "lick".


A dog 1 s eye s are
eloquence itself, reflectors
of our own most intimate
emotions, and proof of the
indivisability of affection.
In r, Spud M , I have attempted
to translate the look in
dogs T eyes into words, and
trust that "Spud” and my
readers will be brought a
little closer as the result.
BRIAN VREPOITT.


Kind reader,
’’This (dog)gerel verse, put up so
rough,
I dedicate to folk
Whose hearts are made of - well, the
stuff,
That ain’t as dry as coke.
Excuse the crudeness of this hook,
The type and cover pins,
Just give to it a friendly look
Eorgivin’ all its sins.
I. had a ’’Spud”; - the larriken
He went and died on me;
And so, I’ve dipped my clumsy pen
In palship l s memory.
If I’ve brought closer to your heart
The ways of Suud and Co.,
It’s all O.K; I’ve shot my dart
With all the love I know.
”Blank verse”, sez you, ’’the stuff
don’t rhyme.’”
Yap] YapJ that hark 1 s too stale;
My verse is SPUD in every line.
Wet nose to silly tail.


"INTRODUCES HIMSELF"
I ! m Spud, "I’m" just a common mong,
The kind ’a dawg yer don’t "st»ck" in
the show,
An 1 get a prize, with ribbons ’ung,
I f m not that sort, you know.
I’m just a dawg, a larriken,
Me points is ’ard ter find,
I’ll take all kinds a’ barrackin’;
I don’t mind.
As fur breed, I reckon I’m a mix,
A licorice all sorts kind a’ breed,
A bit a’ that, a bit a’ this,
To suit ycr need.
Dunno where I get me name,
No more’n me tail;
Natural, I ’spose, like rain;
An’ ginger ale.
I’ll serve yer, Mister, well and true;
I’ll guard yer ’ouse,
Amuse the kids, an’ when yer blue,
Keep quiet as mouse.
I’m just a pal, a friendly mong,
Don’t quarrel, don’t fret.
Just lick yer sometimes with a tongue
All lovin’ wet.
Over;


SPUD INTRODUCES HIMSELF Contd.
Er course s I’d like to come with
When yer sticks yer ’at on,
’Ats always makes me stir,
Cryin 1 - n Spud, come on M ,
I’m everybody’s dawg, just Spud,
Will anybody claim me?
Yer can call me Spud, or mud,
But please don't chain me.
I'm kind a’ lonely, sittin’ ’ere,
Waitin’ to ear yer say -
”Ere Spud”, an’ scratch me ear,
In ’ take me away.


’’THE LOST LOO’S HOME”
Once I got lost. I don’t know how,
Chasin’ a horse, I think, or a cow;
Anyway, Igc t 1o st; I.didn ? t know
Which way to tarn, which way to go,
But just stood there, quite lost, alone,
Until a man came up, an’ took me to
the Home.
The lost dog’s home it was, where
every mong
Who lost himself, or her, was mixed
among
A pile of other dawgs,an T given food
an’ drink.
An’ left to whine, and dream, an’
think.
A Lost Lawgs’ Home,’ I 1 spose it was
home;
But, my paws around a meaty hone,
Sometimes I couldn’t chew, an’ let it
stay,
Breamin’ of cats an’ hare legged kids,
an ’ play.
Over:


SHIP: THE LOST POO’S HOME Gontd.
I used to hark, when people came to see
And try to say - n I T m Spud, don ! t
anyone want me 1 ?
But none seemed to, and nighttime
came,
And us dawgs went to sleep, without
a name.
One day, when I was half asleep,
I hears a voice I know, an 1 up I leap,
An 1 hark like mad, an 1 lick my nose;
You T ve guessed it right - the voice
was Master Joe T s.
11 Why, there 1 s Spud"; he says, n I
thought you might he here.’’
An 1 stretched his hand, an 1 scratched
behind my ear;
An f got me out, an 1 took me from the
Home;
I think he missed me, my master
Joe Ifelone,


11 THE PUPPIES u
My word. 1 TenJi
And only one like me,
As far as I can see.
Ten, my word. 1 1
She 1 11 have her work cut out
To satisfy their drought.
Ten little puppy kails
All '"blind as love;
Love - what 1 s love?
My word, I f m glad
I ‘m not a lady dawg;
Ten mouths. 1 Oh lord. 1
They I re pretty pups,
All muzzling in to suck;
Oh well, I wish them luck.


"THE SLIPPERS"
My Master wants Ms slippers,
I wonder where they are?
It must have been the nippers;
They can’t he very far.
He’s lost his slippers; he’s lost
His leather slippers,
They’re new and red; they must
have cost -
It must have been the nippers.
Who took his leather slippers?
He’s hunted high and low;
He’s blamed his wife, he’s
smacked the nippers,
"’There did his slippers go?
I wonder? P’raps I know;
They may be in the garden bed
Where all my best bones go,
Those slippers new and red.


"BATTLE"
See my ear? that’s scrappin’
An Irish dawg,
Once caught me nappin’
The dirty dawg.
I was courtin’; a skye
She was; I caught her eye
An’ said - ’’How’s cats?”
She said- ”Oh, cats
Is good - how’s rats?
We pulled up right away.
We sniffed and played about a
An’ when I asked her name, she
”I’m Jane, what’s your’s?”
I said - ”1 ’m Spud”,
She hung her pretty head
An’ licked my paws;
I tell you, she was IT.
Over;


SPUD "BATTLE" Contd.
An 1 then, this Irish mong
Mast come along;
His jaw was under hung,
And was he strong. 1
Sez he - "what lovely eyes
You ! ve got, my dear, 1 ’ 1
An 1 struth] that Jane she sighs,
An 1 lets him kiss her ear.
Would you stand that? Not me;
,f Haul off", I hark,
"You Irish tongued old flea,
You ugly nark",
Jane stood an T watched the scrap
An 1 then she said -
"I knew you T d heat him Spud, the
"I r m glad he 1 s dead".
That T s how I got this lug,
Scrappin r for love;
I was a silly mug,
Fightin 1 for love J

"THE GERMAN POODLE"
Der vos a lee die poodle dog,,
A sausage shape he vos,
Mit skin stuffed tight as leedle hog,
A German dog "becos.
His name vos Fritz, his legs vos short,
Like tead leaves hung his ears,
An 1 Fritz had plenty tricks been taught,
While his Master drank his "beers.
A clever dog vos leedle Fritz,
Mit shaggy Carlyle head.
An ! two "brown eyes like shiny slits,
Above a tongue "blood red.
He l d sit straight oop, an T on his nose
Hold square white sugar lumps,
An 1 walk about upon his toes,

He l d yoomp through hoops an 1 ofer chairs,
As goot as any frog,

Ach. 1 He vos ein clever dog.
Over:


SPUD THE GEKMAH FOOTLE Contd.
Yon day, it vos ein rainy day,
Mit Paddles everywheres,
Fritz thought he'd like mit me to play,
He vos tired of yoompin l chairs.
He came alone mit eyes all bright,
An 1 hair like wet seaweed;
Said Fritz to me - n let ! s have ein fight
An T I, of coarse, agreed.
I didn't know why we shoald scrap,
An r dinks dot Fritz did neither,
Eat I bit him hard, an 1 made him yap,

He vos ein clever dog, for sure,
To lock me off me feet..


SPUD
'MIST DAWG-"
I' M SPUD - .Jist DAWG-,
Dot much to look at, p T raps,

an T lots of other faults;
Oh well, a T course, I can't help that
I know I ain't Adonis, not by miles,
Bat what ! s the odds? I T m happy “bein'
Jist SPUD.
The missus of the house, she says
"Alin T SPUD'S EYES KIND]"
Well, that's somethin 1 1 ain't it now?
An' though I'm sich a MONO-, in other
Long tail, crook ears an 1 stubhy nose
A little hit a' praise like that -
"AIN' T SPUD' S EYES KIND.' "
IS like a BONE to me, bein' ME -
Jist SPUD.
Over:


"JIST SFJD" (Contd.)
I dunno, it seems to me
A silly thing, this I IGH SHOW stuff;
From what I’ve seen of "blue hlood tykes
With "jist so M noses, tails to measure
An ’ all that ROT,
They don’t T ave ’arf the fun of
Monys like ME;
Somehow, they gets self-conscious,
Stuck up - SNIFFY,
An ! when I tries to play with them,
Up goes their "jist so" noses,
An 1 they stalks away, for I T m
Jist SPUD.
I’m SPUD, jist UAWG-,

DEEM"
"THE
Dogs dreamj - Do you?
Last night I had a honzer dream;
I ! dheen chasin’ cats all day
Down dirty lanes,
An 1 I got tired of cals,
An’ dirty hoys and girls;
The cats all hid in ruhhish tins,
An ’ the kids - aw 1 well -
I don T t pretend I’m spick an 1 span,
But I’m not a dirty dawg;
These kids - poohj - an’ that’s a fact,
And dirt is dirt - though mind,
I don’t object to dust and mud -
they’re fun
BUT DIET IS DIET.
Well, I turned in early, for me, that is,
For dawgs is dawgs, - yer know;
Midnight it was
Behind a hedge,
An' the Moon was up, an’ full;
I twisted round, as us dawgs do,
And then I curled up snug,
With head in paws, an’ tail curled round,
An’ thought of cats, and kids,
An’ moaned a hit,
BUT DAWGS IS DAWGS.
Over:


SPUD - THE DREAM (Contd.)
At first I couldnH sleep;
The moon shone in my face,
And I got up, and howled a hit,
An T somewhere out a mile away,
A mong howled hack at me,
And I harked hack at him,
EOK BAWG-S IS BATOS.
An 1 then, I went to sleep, an* dreamed;
I didn*t dream of kids an 1 cats,
1 dreamed of stranger things
Of grass and hedges,
And hollow logs,
liere irlce and rahhits hid,
And strange, far ponds and creeks,
And lizards,
All sorts of country things.
It was the hedge, I ’spose,
I slept beneath,
Made me dream silly dreams;
But they was sweet -
Better*n cats and kids,
An 1 chasin 1 halls an* sticks
Bat
BREAMS IS. BREAMS.

SPUD
"ON GUARD"
I fool about all day,
Chasin* things,
Hantin 1 - or pretendin 1 ,
Playin 1 with the kids,
An huryin 1 hones an r things;
3at when the sun goes down,
And the night-time comes,
And there r s dark and shadows
Everywhere, an 1 prickly sounds,
I r M NOT CHAINED UP,
Eat roamin* round,
ON GUARD.
Around the house 1 roam,
On guard;
All day I play the fool,
And LOOK a fool, p J raps,
But when the black night comes,
An 1 the whole house sleeps,
I roam around,
ON GUARD.
Over:


SPUD: "ON GUARD" (Contd.)
If I lie down, don't think
I sleep; one eye is OPEN,
And both my ears are set
To hear the faintest sound,
Uhen I'm on G-TJAPD,
Jist try to sneak about
And get inside the gate,
Or climb the fence, at NIG-HT,
Jist THTJ
I wouldn't bark, not ME,
That ain't my way;
I'd make a line for you -
And then, before you knew,
I'd BITE'i
So don't you try, when I'm
ON GUARD.


SPUD
"A DAWO’S LIFE”
A dawg r s life. 1 Well, it l s not so Dad,
It ! s short, hut while it lasts,
There T s stacks of thrills to make it glad,
Between the FORE and AFTS,
I ! d rather he a DAWG-, than MAE,
From what I see of it;
MAE lives a longer average span,
Bat give ME DAWG- 1 S short hit.
What worries has a DAWG- to hear?
MAE 1 S life, from what I see,
Is one long stretch of kenelled care
Eo GOOD to ME.
We earn no pelf, we do no work,
We have no rents to pay,
We wear no clothes that hind and irk,
We live in Eature *s way.
We get enough to eat and drink,
And if we don r t - what odds?
We T d rather he just DAWG-S, I think
Than worried human gods.

"GIRL S"
Girls IS. funny things;
I mean the little 'uns
With hare legs;
Fanny things
I jist rush up, for fan,
And sticks my tongae oat,
And grin, and wag my tail
And hark - ,r HALLO] "
And off they ran and scream,
And yell for help. 1
Girls IS. funny things.
And if I chase them,
Jist for fan,
A great hig man comes cat,
Or a hig fat woman,
And shy stones at me,
And shout - "Get off, you BRUTE] "
The fat woman says - "DID ! UMS". ]
And the hig chap chases me,
And says - "THAT BRUTE of a BOG,
He ought’er he SHOT - or POISONED"
Girls is FUMY things.
Over:


SPUD: "GIRLS "(Contd.)
They're all right when they're big
With stockings on;
(But I like Bare legs Best,)
The BIG GIRLS like me,
They say - "HULLO, SPUD" - "GOOD SPUD"
"NICE SPUD, what lovely EYESJ"
They pat me Back an 1 scratch me ears,
And fuss all over me,
And ME,stan din 1 lookin’ silly,
Waggin * me tail,
Lettin’ them scratch me FLEAS.
And then I sees a LITTLE girl,
With BABE legs, and off I go,
And the Big girls say - "Oh, SPUD,
"You naughty dog, come BackJJ "
But I like BABE legs Best;
Yes, Girls is FUHHY things.


SPUD
’’B I R D S n
Goshi they’re hard to catchJ
I mean for ME;
I hark, an T like a flash
They’re up a tree.
Cats can catch a hird
As quick as snuff;
Cats don T t say a word,
They’re quiet as puff.
I can 1 1 help harkin 1 ,
I get wound up,
And while I’m larkin'
My bird’s a pup.
Cats sneak up, and creep
Up inch by inch,
And the bird sez - CHEEP",
Then gets the pinch.
But I don’t caro; its fun
To thorn fly
Up iii tha dazzling sun.
My, can’t they fly’


"ON BEING CHAINED".
I HATE chains. 1
No dawg with Brains
likes hein T tied an 1 left to fret;
I’ve never met a CHAIN DAWG yet.
CHAINED’ TIED UP. 1
Although a pup
I ’spose, can’t have his way,
An’ have his freedom E-17ERY day.
Wien I’m chained
I get cross-grained;
I hang my head, an’ sulk an’ Brood;
Don’t touch me when I’m in THAT mood.’
Wien I’m EREE
I Bark with glee.
And leap about,
And so YOU would,
If you were tired of Being good.


SPU'D
"CRICKET"
I LIKE cricket;
I’m the best what d’yer callem
You know, the ball chaser -
FIELDER - on two or four legs.
I field mid-on - that’s my pitch,
BRADMAH couldn’t belt the ball past
MEJ
At least, if not too hot;
Bradman - poof, who 's he?
I’m Spud the fielder, when I’m let,
And that’s not often;
But when I spot a. game of cricket,
I streak along and say
"I’m SPUD the fielder, let me play; ”
Sometimes they don’t hear me -
Sometimes they don’t see me
But when they Do_ v its
"Scoot, you MOUG-’L and shouts and
stones,
And sometimes I get booted;
It’s worth the risk of broken bones
TO HAVE A GAME.


SPUD
"BOYS”
BOYS
Oh, they’re all right,
They’re puppies just like me,
They hark,
They fight,
And for a lark
Give cats a fright,
But - they never chase a flea.
They’re mischievous, like me,
They tie a tin
To my long tail,
And in the din
They never fail
To look most innocently.
I only wish, I only wish
That I could catch a BOY,
And tie a tin, or washing dish,
To the tail of Mister BOY.
Their tails are hard to find;
They keep them hid in hags,
Or something of the kind,
While mine quite naked wags.


SPUD; "BOYS 11 (Contd.)
Yes, Boys is pups, the same as me,
They’re rascals, full of fun;
But don 1 1 they EVER have a FLEA,
Like other pups?
00* THERE’S CHE!
27.


"MUSI C"
The master plays the fiddle,
And I howl;
He doesn’t like my voice,
Because he stops and yells -
M Scoot, scoot,you "brute. 1 ”
And I slink out, and look at him,
And the master goes on fiddling.
I like my master’s fiddling,
It stirs me up,
Deep down, somewhere,
But I can’t help howling,
Somehow.
Especially those double notes;
They’re full of thunder,
And wind and rain
And sometimes he gets wild
And ha,shes on the strings like ma.d
Low down - high up -
He doesn’t hear me, then.
Howling with my head thrown hack
My mouth shaped like an 0.
Over:


SPUD: "MUSIC” (Contd.)
I s'pose he thinks - "Poor Spud,
?7hy don't you like my fiddle?”
And I can't tell him, being me,
I howl because I EO.

SPUD
"THE BATE".
I don T t need a bathj
And yet, they stick me in a tub,
An ! sop me to the hide;
An 1 pooh. 1 - that PhenyleJ
Awful stuff] Kills fleas?
Do wonder.
Awhile ago, my master called -
M Spud, Spud - good dawg - come on Spud”;
I r d heard him call like that before -
That wheedling, coaxing, soapy voice -
It meant a bath] I knew.
I started locking for a bone,
Away down behind the fowlyard,
I had one eye on him,
And saw him coming -
,r Ko good, Spud; Come on”.
