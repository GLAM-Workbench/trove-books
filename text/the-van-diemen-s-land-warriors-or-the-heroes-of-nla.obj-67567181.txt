To my best and most sincere friend ?MYSELF.
Sir,
Severed as I am from my native Isle,
far from my dearest relatives and friends, and dwel-
ling in a country where genuine friendship is so
rare, I cannot too highly appreciate that inestima-
ble blessing, when smiling fortune throws it in my
way. Convinced as lam that no one has my wel-
fare more at heart than yourself ?that in adversity
you would feel my misfortunes as your own ?that
in my prosperity you would sincerely rejoice ; and
feeling as 1 do, that you are almost the only friend
in whom I can place implicit confidence, permit
me, as a mark of my extreme regard and gratitude
for friendship so truly sincere, to dedicate to you
this offspring of my Muse, and to assure you how
much
I am,
Sir,
Your obliged
Obedient servant,
Pindar Juvenal,

THE
Warriors of Van Diemen's Land,
OR THE
HEROES OF CORNWALL.
Canto fixmu
War, and those gallant souls, I proudly chant,
Whose lion hearts did bravely fiercely pant?
To capture Brady, and his ruffian band.
Who reigned the terror of Van Diemen?s Land ;
I sing the meeting of the valiant crew,
Who met to argue what was best to do,
What was the sure and most effectual plan,
To take the lives of Brady?s murd?rous clan ;
Oh ! Wellington, the feats that I?ll report,
Will make thy brav?ry dwindle into nought ;
The fields of Talavera?Waterloo?
Were nought, compared to what the muse will shew !
Now to my tale; the muse shall be sincere,


And tell the speech of every volunteer,
Who met that day, with fierce and knowing face,
To argue soundly poor Van Diemen?s case.
A Baker first got up and sagely said,
T?was hard that Settlers who came there for bread ,
Whose bread was scarce enough to keep themselves,
Should thus be plundered by a batch of elves.
Gem?men said he, those rogues have done too much ,
My blood now rises , and my thoughts are such,
The soldiers never will divest the land
Of this terrific, plund?ring, raurd?rous band ;
The thought now kindles in my breast a fire
Of emulation, and a proud desire
To take the field with pistols, sword, and gun.
And kill the rascals, every mother?s son,
Who for their balm and comfort will be shoven
With peals of thunder, into Satan?s oven.
The Cobbler rose, and upon his sole *
That with so brave a corps he would enrol ;
Said he, if awl] will stick like wax together ,
Our end is gained, the scoundrels we shall leather ,*
And then for awl\ their thefts and murders past,
That very day shall be the scoundrel?s last,
*Soul. fAll.


In Brady's shoes to stand, 1 would not do?t
For aivl the Indies and the world to hoot !
Fierce as that warlike animal called mutton,
The Tailor rose, and vowed that not a button
He cared for fighting Brady?s lawless band,
Or any such disturbers of the land,
W ho on the highway sculked in search of riches,
And cabbaged money from a trav?ler?s breeches ;
Indeed, no man should rob him of a dollar!
The man who trid it he would quickly collar ,
And give the fellow such a hearty dose,
In fact he?d shoot the villain like a goose/
He?d quickly end the robber?s highway strife,
And fearless cut the rascal?s thread of life!
Then told his friends most modestly that he
Was sharp as a needle or a pin could be,
That if they really wished to shoot them,
He was the very fellow that would suit them !
Next was a IBlacksmith, who aloud declaimed.
And said the soldiers could not but be blamed,
That had they not in martial duty failed,
Brady and all his gang had long been nailed ;
As Brady and all his gang are near this spot,
Bet?s strike the blow whilst vet the iron's hot !


To arms, let?s go ! I know of nought that hinders
Our Mowing all the rebel knaves to cinders ;
Whilst there?s a spark of fire within my breast,
Till they be killed these limbs shall never rest ;
Curs?d be the man that tries to quench the flame,
That cannot fail t?irnmortalize my name !
My heat of temper, pray excuse my friends,
When I begin, God knows where passion ends !
It is a vice, that with much truth is said,
Cannot be knocked too soon upon the head ;
For when it long in mortal s bosom reigns,
It steels the heart against true friendship?s chains.
Now spake a Carpenter, who vowed he saw
Quite plane* that nought could bring the rogues to
law,
Unless the gem?man there joined handln hand,
To cut in pieces Brady?s daring band,
(Which to the country was a horrid bore,
And which he augured migh be killed before
The compass of a week or little more ;)
He wished to axe t the gentlemen if they
Hid not with him most solemnly enveigh
Against the"silly rules anil measures planned
/
*Plain tAsk


By Colonel Arthur, Gorernor of the land.
Who sent out soldiers to destroy the band ?
Soldiers, indeed ! why he himself wouldfight
A dozen such, and put them a?vl\\ to flight ! �
nut�, �._�%. �Mt ��wjmt jit wM'wmv: i ?wm' jm - �mmmmmmt- ? �
But as he always acted on the square ,
He?d rather have the angry battle fair,
And fight one soldier, if one soldier dare ;
Come on, he cried ! let?s take our warlike tools ,
And drive the robbers from their lurking holes :
O 7
If we go out to take the rebel mob,
By Jove, my friends, we?ll maken no tvooden job !
Down sat the carpenter ; a Barber rose,
And hoped he?d soon have Brady by the nose ;
lo fight against him no one could be prouder,
In fact, he?ad all his life been used to powder ;
I hen by the heard oj Mahomet he swore
He?d comb the wigs of Brady?s gang before
Another week, he?d trim the rogues depraved,
Cr else he hoped his soul might not be saved ;
Happy was he to say he did not care
For Brady?s lawless troop a single hair ;
His gallant friends assembled there, God bless them,
He thought were just the boys to strap anu dress
them ;
?All.


And should they all the rebel villains shoot,
He?d make a charge, and cut each rascal?s throat !
Then being bless?d with feelings rather saving,
He asked his friends if no one ivanted shaving ,
Which at that time was not biens�ant behaving !
A Grocer s dapper little ?prentice next
Got up, and said he?d very oft been vexed
To think the soldiers had not long ago
Captured both Brady and his hellish ciew ;
As for his part, he did not care a plum.
If Brady?s party should that minute come ;
The rogues he knew would not a minute stay,
His muster d friends would pepper them away ;
They?d find, and find too late t?was wrong to pop
Their scoundrel heads into so wrong a shop ;
Come takeyourarms, my friends, I?m much in doubt
If Brady?s party will be ta?en without !
A fig for soldiers, I alone would handle
�~soidier as if he were a farthing candle !
Of soldier?s courage some folks make such fuss,
I in m w ??? ?? nwmmiiiii ?i

(Jan they be put upon a scale with us
BuTstTll, 7f should our Gov?nor of the land
Invest in me th? absolute command
Of twelve stout soldiers, with their Captain too,
I d undertake to make them beat the foe ;


For I conceive in war successful deeds,
Much, much depend upon the man who leads �
A Pastry Cook then made a tart reply ,
And said it was his duty to deny,
That no King?s soldier could be reckoned brave,
For he that very moment chanced to have
High in the army two most valiant boys,
Who in that army made no little noise,
As he had lately been informed by one,
Who?d been a witness to the deeds they?d done :
Though in their praises he would fain be dumb,
Yet, braver fellows never beat a drum !
At other?s cost he never wished to puff.
The merits of his sons; he?d said enough :
No more he?d say, except may God preserve
The valiant fellows who so well deserve ;
Although his boys were absent, he?d no doubt
Of putting all the robbers to the rout,
Who, of the sweets of life the settlers rifle,
And leave untouched not e?en the smallest trifle;
He hoped to stop their long career of vice,
And see their carcases as cold as ice ;
Said he, the fruits of all their deeds, I tell ye,
Shall be, we?ll beat the rascals to a jelly


A Tinker rose and said, that with clean hands *
Thank God, he volunteered to fight those bands
Of armed banditti which infest this spot,
And hoped they all would soon be sent to pot ;
Rogues, that for murder and for rapine lurk,
His honor shrunk from all such dirty work!
T?were better soon from out the world to send them,
Because he thought them too far gone to mend them .
A Hatter rising made a warm oration ;
He said he felt such mighty trepidation
At hearing all the robbers wanton sins,
That for the world he?d not be in their shins;
With all his heart he?d join against the hand ,
And vowed success must crown each gallant hand,
For he?d be bound , they?d nothing more to do
But find the villains, and then buckle to ;
In short, he saw the rogues had cause for quaking,
For they were on the verge of being taken,
That like the Beaver , they would hunt them down ,
And bring them flayed like rabbits into town ;
We ll shew the Gov?nor and the soldiers here,
What men can do who?re destitute of fear !
The Parson?s Clerk then rose with speech most witty,
Hoping they?d kill the rascally banditti ;

As for himself, (to chose the least of evil,)
He'd stay in Launceston and fight the devil!
The Tailor rose, and called the Clerk a lout,
And begged the gentlemen would turn him out \
To see a timid man he could not bear,
He only wished for men of courage there ;
The latter speech was scarcely uttered, when
Ihe Clerk walked out, and going, said Amen.

Canto Jerronfc�
The noble heroes now had proudly each
Made a magnanimous and warlike speech,
When lo ! an argument remained in store,
Who should be captain of their valient corps !
Each man most modestly proposed that he,
Should lead the others on to victory ;
Vast were the tales recounted by each one,
Of noble deeds that he himself had done.
This, on a hay-stack, winged a small tom-tit,
And if that he so small a thing could hit,
Why sure the only inference was then,
That he was qualified to shoot at men.
In fact he had no doubt, upon his woid,
He should next shot have nearly killed the bird,
But he was forced against his own desire
To run , because he?ad set the stack on fire !
Another, passing by a flock of geese,
The birds attacked him, and he fired his piece,
And put them all to flight, though on the spot
His pig unluckily received the shot,


Which shews how dangerous it is to be
Mixing one?s self in bad society.
One vowed, and firmly swore, upon his soul,
He one day saw a rat within its hole,
And (being bless?d with nerve and courage stout),
He seized its tail, and pulled the vermin out !
And if he thus could act in such a case,
Could he not pull from out their lurking place
The lawless gang, just like so many rats.
And make them food for hungry dogs and cats ?
The Tailor said he had to boast what few
In that assembly he believed could do,
He?ad beat two men till they were black and blue,
In short like ninepins he had knocked them down,
Which he could prove, by twenty men in town ;
He mauled them so in this most gallant fray,
That they most gladly would have rati away ,
But (to their cost) they could not stir a peg,
Tor both the scoundrels had a wooden leg !
Another proved that once in mortal rage,
He thrashed his grandsire, though five times his age ,
Tor seventy-five revolving years he?d seen,
And he (himself) was only just fifteen !
And when his grannam interfered, why lo !


Bis spirit kindled, and he thrashed her 100 /
The others? feats my mnse disdains to name, T
Because she deems they cannot justly claim V
The smallest title to renown or fame. }
At last they all with one accord agreed,
The Tailors action was the bravest deed.
And each resolved to make this daring trip
Under the charge of gallant Captain Snip ,
Who proudly ?fiercely girding on his shears ,
Exclaimed come on, I'll clip the villains ears I
Another moon shall never pass away
Ere Brady?s gang return to mother clay !
As mine?s the task to lead you on to fame,
I?ll prove me worthy of a captain?s name ;
Beat, beat to arms ! let every hero come !
With that the Tinker beat his kettle-drum !
Now in pursuit they onward bend their way,
And walk full half the tedious sultry day
O?er lofty hills, before they luckless'find,
Th t every bullet had been left behind !
That Captain Snip by some mistake, good lack,
(Instead of powder) gave them all lamp black !
Well might the Grocer?s little ?prentice puzzle
To find the cause (though loaded to the muzzle !)
His gun would not go off and shoot,


That noble animal?the bandicoot /
Well might the wond ring Baker try
To ascertain the reason why
His gun so obstinate refused to fire,
And gratify his murderous desire ;
Because if real powder had been used,
1 he musket would have still refused
To breathe destruction to the kang?roo-rat,
Which on a log most impudently sat,
Nor seemed inclined to stir a single jot,
As though it knew the baker s gun had got
It s charge of powder placed above the shot !
Well might the Cobbler joyous feel,
And wilh thanksgiving grateful kneel,
bor Captain Ship?s most fortunate mistake,
Made, as it were, on purpose for his sake ;
For had the Tinker hapless shot him dead,
When thrice he took his black and brushy head
(Behind a tree) to be a large oppossum,
The cobbling trade had lost its brightest blossom
And now returning, with all expedition,
i hey quick obtain some real ammunition,
And march again, provided with a sack,
To bring the heads of all the robbers back :


For many a mile, through many a sultry day,
In vain these heroes o?er the mountains stray,
When fortune deeming it was monstrous hard.
That men so spirited should be debarred
From falling in with Brady?s treacherous crew,
And proving what a valorous heart could do,
Made the keen eyes of all the party see
The looked-for robbers sleeping neath a tree
Gladly they saw the rascals snoring lay ,
Then fixed their bayonets and ?ran away .

Canto Cfmln
Now when they ceased to urge the timorous flight,
And those who fainted through th? excessive friaht
Had well recovered, tlius their captain spake :
? My friends, reflection says t?was wrong to make
? At such a time this needless hasty flight,
? Before occasion had been given for fright ;
? That I first, 1 really don?t deny,
But t was not fear, like yours, that made me flv :
w 7
Ah, no ! a very different cause indeed,
Believe me, Gentlemen, had urged my speed �
I ran (to make your capture quite complete)
I hopes of cutting off the knaves retreat !
Take courage, friends, your flagging spirits rally,
? Our foes are sleeping, let us make a sally?
The hazy morning favours our attack,
" Come on ! their heads shall quickly fill this sack/?
With that they fiercely seize their arms and go.
Resolved to masacre the daring foe ;
Again they view them, and then softly creep,
And fire their muskets at the rogues asleep ;
But kindly harmless every bullet passes,


And spares the lives of five or six jackasses.
Which foggy weather, intermixed with fear,
Most wonderfully had made appear
As nothing less than Brady slawless clan,
Fast in the arms of Morpheus, to a man !
The startled animals their long ears pricking,
Jumped up, and proved themselves alive and kick-
ingy
For, cocking their tails, o?er hill and dale they bound,
Leaving the warriors masters of thegound,
(Except a few who?d shut both eyes to file,
And did not open either to enquire,
Before they ran , how many robbers bled,
Or whether the whole, or only part were dead,
But deemed it prudent quickly to retiie,
Lest unslain robbers might return the fire.
The flying heroes in a scrub concealed,
Soon viewed their comrades masters of the field,
Then (venturing out to join their friends again)
First learn their firing had been all in vain.
Scarce had they joined, whenlo ! two men appear,
Strangers to them, and strangers too to feai ;
Your arms surrender sternly loud they cry,
Or every rascal of your gang shall die.
]\o sooner spoke, than down their arms w ere laid,


And thirteen men were hapless prisoners made,
Who thought if yielding would obtain them quarter,
T?were better to do so, than to risk such slaughter;
Meekly submitting, every hand was tied
Before th? affrighted prisoners descried
Their stout and gallant conquerors to be,
From the 40th Regiment of Infantry ;
And not from the plund?ring* impious band,
That caused such terror in Van Diemen?s Land.
The soldiers being (the easier to surprise
Bush-rangers) dressed in bush-disguise ;
Vain were the captives pleading, when
They vow ed that they were honest men,
In search of Brady?s rascally banditti ;
That to detain them was a monstrous pity.
The unrelenting veterans swore
That they?d have heiter evidence before
They?d ever venture to believe that they,
Were each one not a scoundrel runaway ;
The nearest Ma gi strate should now decide,
If undeserving all their hands were tied.
With that they heedless marched them on before,
And entered speedily his Worship?s door;
His Worship justly heard them pro and con,
And then decidedly resolved upon
Freely discharging all the captive band,


First letting all the party understand.
He thought they really did not seem/to be
By any means o?erstocked with bravery ;
Then (being dismissed) the heroes went their ways.
And thus his Worship gave the soldiers praise ;
My gallant friends, I must allow to you,
There?s greatest praise and every credit due,
In spite of your unfortunate mistake.
An error very natural to make ;
So natural indeed my mind conceives,
The devil himself would take them all for thieves I
Short was their joy for liberty regained,
When fortune unpropitiously ordained,
Next day that ev?ry volunteer should be.
Again the child of sad captivity.
Alas ! whilst busied setting stitches,
And mending his company's ragged breeches,
The unsuspecting Captain Snip descries
(With terror equal to his grcfeat surprise)
The daring Brady with his lawless band,
Around himself and hapless comrades stand
With bay?nets fixed ; the robbers loudly cry,
Your arms surrender, or each man shall die !
The mandate uttered, ?twas as soon obeyed ;
When Brady frowning fiercely, stern surveyed


His captive foes, and then demanded why
They should not all that very instant die?
The arms they yielded, he too plainly knew,
Were solely borne against himself and crew.
When thus to him did Captain Snip reply
With chatt ring teeth, and tearful sorrowing eye,
Upon his trembling and submissive knees ;
My Lord ?your Excellency ?your Honor ?please
To spare our lives, were not (as you suppose)
Armed as your Rev'rences most daring foes.
But only sportsmen bearing guns to shoot
The kangaroo-rat and bandicoot.
But most unluckily for Captain Snip,
T?was proved his tongue had made a trifling slip
From truth, because himself and comrades all
(When searched) had nought about themselves but
ball.
Good shots, cried Brady, you must be to shoot
he kangaroo-rat and bandicoot
With musket balls ?for gem?men you have not
About your persons e?en a grain of shot.
But, sirs, I?m not so credulous an ass,
1 o let your bandicoot assertion pass
Upon my mind as real truth, for I
Conceive these bullets prove your tale a lie ;
And therefore sentence every man to die.


But harkee, previous to your decease
Perhaps your consciences would fain make peace
With Heaven, and candidly aloud confess
Your various deeds of shameful wickedness ;
Ho so this instant, for I only give
Ten fleeting minutes for each man to live !
Down on their knees, th? affrighted captives fall,
And just like dying thieves, recounted all
The most notorious and shameful crimes.
That they?d been guilty of at various times ;
The wond?ring robbers smiling, said, why then
Compared with these w?are really honest men ;
Wein comparison are men of worth
To them the greatest scoundrels upon earth.
Uhe wretched pris?ners on their knees remain.
And beg their lives, nor do they sue in vain,
For after some discussion and dispute,
The robbers all determine to commute
The rigid sentence of annihilation,
Into the punishment of flagellation
With cat-o nine-tails, and with one accord,
Most kindly liberally did award
To every private volunteer, the sum
Of fijty lashes on his naked b?m,
By way of what they called a pay or pension,
Due to their services and good intention,


But as remuneration for his trouble,
They gen?rous gave to Captain Snip full double
The sum or payment that his men received,
Not that h?ad greater services achieved,
But that they thought it was not proper then
To pay an officer like common men.
The flogging o?er, said Brady (jeering) pray
Don?t you consider, Gentlemen, I play
Upon thot instrument the fiddle well ?
Now prithee be ingenuous and tell
Did not I make the sounding strings impart
A tender feeling , that subdued the heart ?
At least, my friends,' it plainly now appears,
I played so ivell it moved you all to tears !
But, Gentlemen, allow me now to say.
When next I chance to undertake to play,
I shall most willingly indeed consent,
T? excuse your vocal base accompaniment .
Now, Gentlemen, be pleased to loose your braces
And then surrender me your fiddle cases ,
That is to say, if you will now allow sirs,
I?ll take the liberty to take your trow sers!
Then loudly laughing at his quizzing speeches.
Dismissed his prisoners without their breeches ,
Begging them not their triffling loss deplore.
As Captain Snip could eas?ly make (hem more.


ln such a glaring dishabille, alas �
Through streets of Launceston compelled to pass,
The girls and women vowed t?was monstrous rude
For men to walk about the town so nude ;
While every ragged little urchin screeches,
Pray what?s the price of buck-s&m breeches ?
At last they gladly each arrive once more
Safely within his own respective door,
Resolved no more in search of fame to roam.
To mind his business, and stay at home.
