place to place in each of the said Circuits to which he oi they
were respectively appointed to visit the various Societies therein
to form new Societies and to preach and otherwise exercise his

said Circuits one of the said preachers so appointed was directed
specially to superintend the others or other of them and to take
the chief charge and care of the Societies in the Circuit over
which he was so appointed and who was at first and duiing the
lifetime of the said John Wesley called “The Assistant ” but is Assistants or Su-
now generally known amongst the said people called Methodists perinte..dents,
by the appellation of “ The Superintendent ” or “ The Superin-

made to meet the expenses of sucli Circuit And Whereas the-
Circuits so formed as aforesaid have been from time to time
increased in number altered changed subdivided or consolidated
as from time to time appeared necessary or expedient And
cnee' 1 ofConfcr ' whereas the said John Wesley in or about the year one thousand

and preachers connected with him to meet in London to confer
upon matters relating to the doctrines discipline regulation and
government of the said Societies and similar meetings or
assemblies of the said preachers being afterwards held annually
they obtained the appellation of “ The Yearly Conference of the
people called Methodists ” minutes of which Yearly Conference-
have for many years past been printed and published annually.
And Whereas on the 28th day of February 1784 the said John
Wesley duly made and published a Deed Poll or Deed of Decla-
Reoitai of Mr ra^on which was enrolled in the High Court of Chancery and
Wesley's Deed wherein after reciting that divers buildings commonly called
Poll Chapels with a messuage or dwelling-house or other appur-
tenances to each of the same belonging situate in various parts
of Great Britain had been given and conveyed by him and also by
divers other persons from time to time to certain persons upon
trust that the Trustees thereof should permit and suffer the said
John Wesley and such persons as he should for that purpose from
time to time nominate and appoint at all times during his life at
his will and pleasure to have and enjoy the free use of the said
premises that the said John Wesley and the person so appointed by
him might therein preach and expound God’s Holy Word and
upon a similar trust in favour of his brother Charles Wesley and
his nominees during his life and after the decease of both of them
then that the said Trustees and their heirs and assigns for ever
should permit and suffer such persons and for such time and times,
as should be appointed at the Yearly Conference of the people
called Methodists and no others to have and enjoy the said pre-
mises for the purposes aforesaid.
And whereas the said Deed Poll further recites that for
rendering effectual the Trusts created by the said several Gifts and
Conveyances and that no doubt might arise with respect to the
Conference ” ally same the said John Wesley as the donor of the said several pre-
mises had thought it expedient to explain the words “ Yearly
Conference of the People called Methodists ” contained in all the
said Trust Deeds and to declare what persons were members of
the said Conference and how the succession and identity thereof
was to be continued. Then the Deed Poll declares of whom the
said Conference had always consisted and further declares that the
one hundred persons then named in the Deed Poll did on the day
of the date of the Deed Poll constitute the said Conference and


that they and their successors to be appointed as the Deed Poll
prescribes and subject to the Regulations therein prescribed
should for ever be taken construed and be the Conference of the
people called Methodists.
And whereas the said Deed Poll prescribes that the Confer-
ence might admit into connection with them or upon trial any
persons whom they should approve to be preachers under the care Regulates admis-
and direction of the Conference the name of such persons with the mentommisters
time and degrees of their admission being entered in the Journals
or Minutes of the Conference. And the Deed Poll prohibits the
Conference from appointing any person to the use and enjoyment
of the said Chapels and premises who is not either a member of the
Conference or admitted into connection with the same or upon
trial or to appoint any person for more than three years success-
ively to the use and enjoyment of the same Chapels and premises
except ordained Ministers of the Church of England.
And whereas the said Deed Poll gives authority to the Con-
ference to expel and put out from being a member thereof or provides for the

Conference or admitted into connection or upon trial for any
cause which to the Conference seems fit and necessary.
And whereas the following is the 13th Article or Regulation
of the said Deed Poll ; “ And for the convenience of the Chapels Prov idcs for the

upon the Trusts aforesaid situate in Ireland or other parts out of
the kingdom of Great Britain the Conference shall and may

And whereas a copy of the said Deed Poll is contained in the
First Schedule to this Deed and it is hereinafter referred to as “The
Deed Poll of 1784” and the “Yearly Conference of the people
called Methodists” is hereinafter referred to as the “Yearly
Conference.”


And whereas the said John Wesley died in the year 1791 his
brother Charles Wesley having pi'eviously died.
And whereas in or about the said year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-one the Yearly Conference for the better main-
tenance of the economy of the said people called Methodists united
into “ Districts ” the circuits which had been formed by the said
John Wesley in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
of which Districts nineteen were formed in England two in
Scotland and six in Ireland and each of which Districts consisted
of several adjoiningcircuits and the Yearly Conference have since
from time to time increased the said Districts in number and
subdivided or otherwise altered the same as they deemed necessary
or expedient. And in order that the business and affairs of the
said Districts might be properly and regularly conducted the Yearly
Conference have annually appointed for each respective District
one of the preachers stationed for the time being in a Circuit
within such District to be the “ Chairman of the District ” and a
meeting of the Preachers within each respective District is called
and generally known among the said people called the Methodists
by the name of the “ District Committee ” or “ District Meeting.”
And whereas in order to attain uniformity in the Deeds of
Settlement and Declarations of Trusts of Chapels School-houses
and other hereditaments and premises thenceforward to be settled
upon trusts for the benefit of the said people called Methodists
the Yearly Conference caused to be prepared in the year 1832 “A
Release of Freehold Ground for the purposes of a Methodist
Chapel with a Declaration of Trusts intended as a Model Deed
to be referred to in subsequent conveyances ” and the said Deed
is now known and used and referred to as “ the Model Deed for
the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels.”
And whereas the said Model Deed after reciting at length
the said Deed Poll of 1784 conveys the piece or parcel of land
hereditaments and premises therein described to Trustees in trust
to build thereon a Chapel or place of Religious A\ orship and a
dwelling-house or dwelling-houses vestry room school room and
other offices and appurtenances or with or without them as the
Trustees shall deem fit. And upon further trust to permit and
suffer the said Chapel with the appurtenances to be used occupied
and enjoyed as and for a place of religious worship by a con-
gregation of Protestants of the said people called Methodists in
the connexion established by the said J ohn A\ esley and for public
■and other meetings and services held according to the general
rules and usages of the said people called Methodists and to
permit and suffer such person and persons only to preach and
expound God’s Holy AVord and to perform the usual acts of


religious worship therein as shall be from time to time approved
and for that purpose duly appointed by or under the authority of
the Yearly Conference from time to time held under the orders
and regulations of the said Deed Poll of 1784. And the said Deed
enables the Trustees with the consent of the Conference testified
in writing under the hand of the President thereof for the time
being to sell the premises and provides for the appropriation of
the purchase money.
And whereas the said people called Methodists are also some-
times called Wesleyan Methodists and their Chapels have been
called Wesleyan Methodist Chapels or Churches; And whereas Australasia de-
since the year 1832 the said Model Deed has been generally lined-
adopted with only such variations as the circumstances of each
case have required for the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist
Chapels in Great Britain and it has been so adopted for the
settlement of Wesleyan Methodist trust properties in Australasia
in which term is included in this Deed the continent of Australia
and the several colonies and settlements on the said continent
including New South Wales South Australia Western Australia
Victoria and Queensland and also Tasmania New Zealand and
the Fiji and other Polynesian Islands.
And whereas an Act was passed in the year 1839 by the Act regulating
Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales (2 Vic.
No. 7) to regulate the religious affairs of Wesleyan Methodists
Independents and Baptists whereby the Trustees appointed under
■an Act of 1837 (7 Wm. IV. No. 3) were authorised to transfer
chapels and lands held by them to new Trustees to be held upon
the Trust stated in any Model Deed recognised and established
by the usages of each particular Society.
And whereas in the year 1840 a Model Deed was prepared
for the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels in New South
Wales which after reciting the foregoing facts conveys the pre- Model Deed for
anises therein comprised upon similar trusts to those declared by NewSouthWales
the English Model Deed and by virtue of which such persons
only are authorised to preach and expound God’s Holy Word and
perform the usual acts of religious worship therein as shall be
duly appointed by or under the authority of the Yearly Conference
and the said Model Deed was enrolled in the Supreme Court of
New South Wales and similar Deeds have been executed in the
other Australian Colonies and under such Deeds all the property
settled in trust for the people called Methodists in the said
Colonies is held.
And whereas the Yearly Conference in the year 1854 resolved
that the Australasian and Polynesian Missions then under the
direction of the Yearly Conference should thenceforth be called


“ The Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Connexion ” for the pur-
poses of which connexion the Yearly Conference constituted “The-
Australasian Conference” consisting of Missionaries who were
then members of or admitted into connexion with the Yearly
Conference and of such other Ministers as should thereafter be
received by the Australasian Conference into its own body subject
nevertheless to the maintenance of the doctrine and discipline of
the Yearly Conference and to the power on the part of the Yearly
Conference to disallow any rules made by the Australasian
Conference inconsistent with such doctrine or discipline.
And whereas between the years 1855 and 1873 the Austral-
asian Conference has with respect to Australasia exercised the
powers of the Yearly Conference relating to the admission and ex-
pulsion of Ministers and has appointed to the use and enjoyment
of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels and trust properties in Austral-
asia Ministers in connection with such Australasian Conference
but not strictly in connection with or expressly appointed by the-
Yearly Conference or by any Delegate duly appointed by the
Yearly Conference in conformity with the Deed Poll of 1784.

ference constituted four annual conferences, severally called the
New South Wales and Queensland Conference the Victoria and
Tasmania Conference the South A ustralia Conference and the New
Zealand Conference such Conferences nevertheless being comprised
in and governed by a General Conference assembling once in
every three years or at such other intervals more or less as it may
deem expedient and made and adopted a new constitution which
constitution was approved by the Yearly Conference and is set
forth in the Minutes of the General Conference of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church held at Sydney in the Colony of New
South Wales in the year 1878 and is also set forth in the Second
Schedule hereto.
And whereas an Act of the Imperial Parliament passed in the
year 1876 and entitled “The Methodist Conference Act 1876”'
after reciting inter alia that doubts existed as to the delegation by
the Yearly Conference of its powers and authorities to the Austral-
asian Conference and as to whether the admissions appointments
and expulsions by the Australasian Conference had been legal and
that it was expedient that such doubts should be removed : And
whereas the said Act confirmed all such admissions appointments
and expulsions by the Australasian Conference and authorised the
Yearly Conference to delegate or confer upon any Conference or
Confei’ences elsewhere than in the United Kingdom of Great Bri-
tain and Ireland all or any of the powers privileges and advan-
tages vested in the said Yearly Conference which powers privileges


and advantages were accordingly delegated by the Yearly Confer-
ence of 1876 to the Australasian Conference and to the four
annual Conferences constituted by it and called severally the New
South Wales and Queensland Conference the Victoria and Tasmania
Conference the South Australia Conference and the New Zealand
Conference : And whereas the powers privileges and advantages
of the said Australasian Conference are now vested in and exercised
by the General Conference of the Australasian Wesleyan Method-
ist Church and the four Annual Conferences constituted by it :
And whereas at the fourth General Conference of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church held at Christchurch New Zealand
in November in the year 1884 it was resolved—That it is desira-
ble that the pi’operties connected with the several Annual
Conferences should as far as practicable be held upon the same
trusts and that for this purpose a Model Deed be prepared which
should be made applicable to the circumstances of each colony and
the several Annual Conferences wei'e authorised to procure Acts
of the Legislature of the several colonies for the settlement of
church properties on the trusts of such Model Deed.
And whereas in pursuance of such resolution these presents

THE SECOND SCHEDULE REFERRED TO.
PLAN FOR ANNUAL AND GENERAL CONFERENCES.
Whereas the English Conference held at Birmingham in 185-1
by the adoption of a plan for that purpose formed the Wesleyan
Missionary Society’s Australasian and Polynesian Missions into a
distinct and affiliated Connexion to be called the “ Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion ” and provided among other things
for the holding of the Annual Conferences of such affiliated Con-
nexion at Sydney Melbourne Adelaide Hobart Town and if found
practicable at Auckland and other places And whereas such Con-
ferences have heretofore consisted of ministers only and whereas
the Conference held in Sydney in 1873 approved of the principle of
lay representation in the Conferences of the Australasian Wesleyan
Methodist Connexion within limits to be subsequently defined And
whereas the same Conference by and with the consent of the
English Conference made and adopted a new Constitution for such
Connexion providing among other things for the holding of Annual
and General Conferences in lieu of the Annual Conferences there-
tofore held but containing no provision whatever for lay represen-
tation. And whereas at the General Conference held at Melbourne
in 1875 it was resolved that while such Conference distinctly
asserted its maintenance of the New Testament doctrine that
the ministry derives its existence from Christ and that upon Chris-
tian ministers to whom is entrusted the duty of taking “ heed to
all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made them over-
seers to feed the Church of God ” devolves the solemn responsi-
bility of enforcing godly discipline and administering the pastoral
government of the Church and whilst it regarded this principle as
being essential to the Scriptural fulfilment of the ministerial office
and so vital to the constitution of Wesleyan Methodism that in
the admission of laymen as members of the Conference it must be
held to be sacred and inviolable it appeared to such Conference to
be advisable that the principle of lay representation should be
applied with the least possible delay to the Annual and General
Conferences of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Connexion
and that the Constitution thereof should be accordingly amended
It was therefore enacted by the First General Conference which
held its Sessions in Melbourne in 1875 by and with the consent
of the English Wesleyan Methodist Conference that so much of
the various Constitutions or Plans relating to the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion as is inconsistent with or repug-
nant to the Constitution of such Connexion as hereinafter con-
tained shall be and the same is hereby repealed and that for the
future the following shall be the Constitution of such Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion that is to say—
The Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church shall as here-
tofore be divided into four Conferences viz. —l, New South Wales


and Queensland Conference which shall include the South Sea
Missions; 2. Victoria and Tasmania Conference; 3. South Australia
Conference (including Western Australia) ; and 4. New Zealand
Conference. These Conferences shall meet annually and shall be
comprised in and governed by a General Conference which shall
hold its session once every three years or at such other intervals
more or less as it may deem expedient.
The Constitution and Powers of the Annual and General
Conferences shall be as hereinafter stated that is to say—
Annual Conferences.
I.— Constitution.
1, The Annual Conferences shall comprise all the ministers
within their respective boundaries who have been admitted by the
English Conference to the full work and othce of the Christian

asian Conference or by the annual Conferences of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church and of such as shall be hereafter
received by the said Annual Conferences together with an equal
number of laymen.
2. The Quarterly Meeting of each Circuit shall be entitled to
elect one Lay Representative who shall be elected by ballot at the
quarterly meeting next preceding the session of the Conference
to which such Circuit pertains.
3. The Committee of each Institution of the Connexion to
which a minister is or may be set apart by an Annual Conference
shall have the right to elect from among the members of such
Committee by ballot one Lay Representative.
4. Should the number of Laymen thus provided for be less
than the number of Ministers pertaining to any Annual Confer-
ence additional Laymen shall be elected by the quarterly meeting
of the Circuit or Circuits which according to the returns published
by such Conference at its last session contained the largest num-
ber of members. The Presidents of the several Annual Conferences
shall give notice to the Circuit or Circuits which may be entitled
to elect more than one lay representative.
5, The Laymen eligible for election as Representatives must
be church members of four years’ continuous standing and at the
time of their election must be members in the Circuit by which
