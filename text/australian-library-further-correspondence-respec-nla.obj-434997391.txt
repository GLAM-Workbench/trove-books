AUSTRALIAN LIBRARY.
(FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE RESPECTING PURCHASE OF.)
Ordered by the Legislative Assembly to be Printed, 19 September, 1862.
Honorary Secretary, Australian Library, to Colonial Secretary.
Australian Library and Literary Institution,
Sydney, 15 September, 1862.
Referring to the communications that have recently taken place between the
Government and the Committee of Management of this Institution, on the subject of the
proposed purchase by the former of the Library Building, I have now the honor to intimate
that the Proprietors and Shareholders have decided not to sell the Building at the price
that has been put upon it by arbitration.
Understanding, however, that the Government is desirous of commencing a FrelTPublio
Library in temporary premises, as soon as practicable, and being of opinion that the pos-
session of the present Library Building and collection of Books would enable the Government
to make such a commencement in a very advantageous manner, the Proprietors and Share-
holders, at a meeting held on the 25th ultimo, empowered the Committee to offer the
Building and Books to the Government for such sum as they (the Committee) might judge
sufficient, subject to the approval of a Special General Meeting.
In virtue of this authority, the Committee now offer the property above indicated for
the sum of £lO,OOO (ten thousand pounds); and I am desired to add that the Committee
will feel obliged if the Government will, with as little delay as is convenient, definitely
accept or decline the above offer, as the Committee do not feel they will be warranted in
entertaining a proposition for a sale at any lower price.
There is no catalogue of the Books belonging to the Institution which the Committee
can guarantee as absolutely correct; the Librarian, however, has been instructed to make
up as accurate a catalogue as he can, and I now transmit the result of these instructions,
which consists of three volumes, two in print, and one in manuscript.
The Committee believe the contents of the Library to be no less than is represented
in this catalogue, but they wish it to be distinctly understood that they give no further
assurance on this head, and desire that the Government may satisfy itself as to the character
and value of the property now placed conditionally under offer.
The Librarian has further made out an abstract of the contents of the Library
classified according to subject, and this I have the honor to append, with the above qualified
statement as to its accuracy.
This shows a smaller total than has been recently represented to the Committee, but
the books that may be considered fairly suitable for the Institution contemplated by the
Government, are, I believe, more numerous than either the Government or the Committee
had anticipated; the number of volumes, after deducting works of fiction, amounting in
round numbers to ten thousand, and constituting, the Committee are confident, on the whole,
a very valuable collection of books.
I have, &c.,
R. A. A. MORE HEAD,
Honorary Secretary.
