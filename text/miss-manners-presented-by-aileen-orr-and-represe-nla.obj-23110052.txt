HER
INTRODUCTION
Miss Manners minds her p’s and q’s
And treads the world in noiseless shoes
A quaint and gentle nursery queen
We’ve heard about, but never seen!
And she was known to dear mamma
And great-great-great-great-grandpapa.
When they, like us, were little things,
She was their angel without wings,—
For if they quarrelled at their game
Miss Manners’ heart would beat for
shame.
She always looks you in the face—
Except when she is saying grace;
7


And she at tea prefers to take
Of bread and butter before cake,
And when it’s in her mouth she’ll sit
Quite silent till she’s swallowed it.
She says ’tis good, whate’er your wish
To leave a morsel in the dish;
And boys and girls of every town
Are told Miss Manners cannot frown :
She only lets sweet feelings rise
And they are shining through her eyes
That quaint and gentle nursery queen
We’ve heard about, and never— seen !
Oh children! if you care to find
Her for yourselves—now lend a mind
Unto these pages—look oh look!
She comes to life within this book!

MISS MANNERS
PART I.
THE FELLOW.
rjIHERE were once three dear little
children called Geoffrey, Rhona, and
Tony. Geoff was seven, and Tony nearly
four. Rhona, the girl, was five, with
golden curls and merry twinkling eyes.
People with curls generally have twinkling
eyes, you’ll find.
They had a kind, good Nanny, and
their best friend was Winkie. Rhona said
that, except, of course, for relations, she
11


loved Winkie better than any one else
in the world.
Winkie was their dog. He could sit
up and beg, and he never bit their fingers
when they gave him biscuits. What he
liked best was to go hunting rabbits and
squirrels when Geoffrey took him for a run
in the wood. Such a glorious place it was,
at the far end of the kitchen garden, with
plenty of trees and water-holes and ferns;
and in summer-time, when everywhere
else was too hot for play, the wood was
deliciously cool and shady, except where the
sun came through in little round patches
to shine like a lot of golden pennies on
the ground. A dusky, mysterious hunting-
field, which made the children’s make-believe
adventures seem very real indeed. There,
among the shadows, lurked the possibility

of something springing up out of the
undergrowth at any moment: —Red Indians
or lions or goblins, to be slain by brave
Geoffrey, or failing that, Geoff’s hero, Murket,
the farm hand, if only he were not feeding
the pigs at the awful moment. But nothing
of this sort had ever really happened. They
were only pretending savages and wild
animals, and when Geoff went stalking
them he would break himself a fine stick
from a bough and without any help shoot
them dead, three and four at a time, and
no mercy.
One day, when he and Tony were out
looking for strange beasts together, Geoff
suddenly cried—
“ I see a zebra.”
Now Geoff always liked to find the
biggest and wildest animal himself, so he


was not too pleased when he heard Tony
shouting —
“ I’se found a dragon.”
Geoff was jealous that his little brother
should find something so much more
dangerous and terrible than his zebra —he
had never thought of a dragon ... so
he promptly took up his stick, and care-
fully aiming he yelled, “ Bang, bang! Ho !
there you are —I’ve shot him ! ”
“But you can’t shoot him—he’s my
dragon,” protested poor Tony.
“Can’t be helped now cause its
dead” —said Geoff, with a little superior
laugh.
“ But I wanted to shoot him,” wailed
Tony, beginning to cry, and realising there
was no sympathy here he ran away past
Geoff —away out of the wood, through the

garden to the house, never stopping till he
reached the nursery.
“ Nanny, oh Nanny,” he sobbed, “ Geoff
shot my dragon. 800-hoo-o ! ”
“ Never mind, darling, you’ve still got

your Nanny,” she cried, hugging him con-
solingly.
And when Geoff came in he explained
it this way :
“ Tony found a dragon, you see, a real
great big one with eyes flaming fire and
lots of legs and tails and teeth, and a tongue
as red as Nanny’s flannel petticoat, and
hissing and that, and I was aiming at my
zebra when I hit the dragon by mistake.
I couldn’t help it you know.”
“ Then tell Tony you’re sorry, sir.”
“Oh, all right, Tony, you can stop
crying.”

"Do warrior chiefs eat?” “Yes, and wash too.”


I,
,


Tony had a very kind heart and soon
forgave by holding up his face for a kiss;
but Geoff, not being a man of sentiment,
only said, “Men don’t kiss,” and turned
away adding—“ lam a great warrior chief.”
“ And tea’s just ready,” said Nanny, to
restore peace, “and you are to have eggs
for a treat to-night.”
“Do warrior chiefs eat ?” asked Geoff,
a little anxiously since he was fond of
eggs.
“Yes, why of course they do, and
they wash too,” said clever Nanny, as she
bore them both off to hot water and soap.
Very soon the three children were hav-
ing tea in the nursery. Nanny was at the
top of the table and Winkie sat up on his
hind legs beside Rhona. They were not
allowed to feed him at the table, but he


always begged a little, hoping to melt
their hearts, and sometimes a piece of
biscuit would fall at Rhona’s feet by mis-
take and he would snap it up like light-
ning.
Geolf had finished his egg first and
asked for some jam. He was allowed to
help himself, because he was seven years
old. Now, it so happened, that this even-
ing there was only a little jam in the dish,
and Nanny, noticing that he was taking
more than his share, gave him the usual
little word of warning—
“ Don’t forget to leave some for Miss
Manners.”
By trying to make eyes, nose, and
mouth on its face and putting on its hat
again, Rhona was playing that her egg was
Humpty Dumpty, so as you may imagine,

she had hardly eaten any. Lifting up the
top and peeping into it she exclaimed—
“ There are plenty
of pieces of white round
the sides of mine
will those do for Miss
Manners ? ”
“No, dear, eat what
you are given, or Miss
Manners will think you
wasteful. What she
likes is to see a piece
in the dish.”
“ I ’spect she’s a very
thin nitten girl,” said
Tony, who was comfort-
ably covered and could

always feel sorry for the hungry, “acause
we on’y ’eave her such nitten tiny bits.”


But Geoffrey, being a warrior chief, and
having slain six Indians and a dragon that
morning, was not to be humbugged. He
looked up and said grandly—
“I don’t like her, and what’s more,
I don’t believe there’s any Miss
Manners at all and I won’t leave her
a scrap.” Whereupon he popped on to
his plate the last morsel of jam, and scraped
the dish clean.
Now at that moment, before nurse had
time to scold, and before any of them had
time to breathe, the nursery door opened
noiselessly and wide and in stepped a very
dainty little maiden.
They all four gazed at her with
curiosity and no wonder! for they
had never seen any one at all like her
before.

The door opened noiselessly, and in stepped a dainty little maiden.




Her hair, which looked as if it had been
powdered white, was brushed softly up high
above her forehead, yet she could not have
been more than nine or ten years old. She
wore a quaint kind of hat-bonnet of muslin,
and round her neck a thin long bow of
black velvet ribbon. She had elbow sleeves,
and an old-fashioned, tight little pointed
bodice, mittens, and a quilted satin skirt to
her ankles, and quilted slippers —all, oh ! so
neat and spotlessly clean.
“May I come quite in, please?” she
asked sweetly.
“With pleasure, Miss,” replied Nanny.
“ Thank you ! ” she answered, quietly
closing the door behind her, and her shoes
made no sound as she lightly approached
the table.
“ What is your name ? ” asked Geoffrey.


“ Miss Manners,” said she, with pretty
dignity.
Ehona, on hearing this, looked again
into her egg-shell and Miss Manners came
and peeped oyer her shoulder.
“I’ve left you all that,” said Ehona
proudly, and Tony exclaimed —
“I’ve on’y eaten half mine. You may
have the uvver half.”
But when she reached Geoffrey’s chair
and saw his plate half covered with jam and
the dish empty, her eyebrows lifted, that
was all.
Nanny was quite troubled, for she
noticed that there was nothing left at all to
offer, even the bread platter was empty —
and nurse was always so kind and hospit-
able to nursery visitors.
“ I’m exceedingly sorry, Miss,” she said,


standing up—there was something about
this visitor that made nurse very deferential,
although Miss Manners was only a little
girl—“ I don’t think it has ever happened
exactly like this before. I see there isn’t
even any milk. Won’t you sit down, and
I’ll send for some.”
“You are very good,” answered Miss
Manners, “ but I am not hungry just now.
I really came to see Geoffrey, but he does
not seem to want me.”
Geoff was silent.
“ And yet it seems to me he ought to
know something about me, for don’t I see
my name on his mug? Oh yes! May I
read the funny looking writing round it,
Geoffrey ? ”
Geoff nodded, and Nurse looked pleased,
for she had bought him the mug herself


when she had gone for the day to Win-
chester once.
Miss Manners lifted it from the table and
read the scrolly sprawly words aloud—
“Manners makyth Man, and want of them the Fellow.”
She added, “ I wonder if you know what
that means ? ”
Now that she was talking about his
mug, Geoff watched her with more interest.
She did not give them time to reply.
“Do you mean you’ve never heard of
Master Fellow? and how—
111-mannered his own way he ran,
To learn at length full well, oh,
He had not grown into a Man —
But only just a Fellow! ”
sang she.
“ But I am a man now,” said Geoff, the

cap fitting—“ and a brave one. I kill lions
and Indians and—and dragons.”
“It was my dragon, you know it was,”
from Tony.
“What could Master Fellow kill?”
asked Geoff.
“Oh he wasn’t brave, he would kill
poor little lost pussies, and hit them with
stones till they died, and he would kill any-
thing small that couldn’t hurt him. He
liked to catch butterflies and stick pins into
them, and watch them trying to get away.
He was cruel. No one was fond of him.”
“ Is he dead too ? ”
“ No, he is always there, just as I am
always somewhere. But we never play to-
gether.”
“ Tell us more about him,” said Ehona,
“ and how he got his own way.”

“I believe you, and want you to stay.”




“ Another time, and you shall hear,” she
said, “but not now.” She stepped away
over to the door.
While watching Miss Manners, Geoff
had been questioning in his own mind with
grave suspicions as to whether she were
really the fairy person who had for so long
been held up to his respect, or only an
ordinary little girl.
Then a great idea struck him to test her
powers and so prove for himself which she
was. Now was the moment.
Pushing back his chair, he got down
without asking, and strode mysteriously
towards her. When within a few yards,
he waved his arms and cried—
“ Vanish! ”
They all watched in great suspense
but—


Miss Manners did not vanish.
“ There you are,” he said scornfully.
“ Just as I thought! She’s no more a fairy
than I am. She can go.”
“ I believe you,” said kind Tony, “ and
I want you to stay.”
“ I don’t,” said Geoff, “ I don’t like
manners. They interfere with my plans.
I’m in the middle of a battle when Nanny
tells me I’ll be late for tea or something.”
They all looked at the naughty, rude
boy and then back for Miss Manners . . .
because this time she had vanished, and
without even opening the door.
Geoffrey was left alone in the nursery
when Nanny took Tony and Rhona up to
bed, so he sat busily thinking again.
Then he jumped up and carefully took the
ink-pot from the lesson cupboard and a pen

and piece of paper, and began to write a

Geoff’s Letter.
This is what he wrote:—
“My dear miss manners,
“I’m sorry that I did not leave
you any Jam this evening, but I did
not know you were coming. If you are


truly her will you come to our haymaking
tea in the field beyond the tennis-court. I
shall be there. Mother says we may all
bring our teas in blue pocket handkerchufs

expect you’ve seen him allright. He is
simply splendid with the pigs. If I don’t
decide to be a Lancer when I grow up, I
will join him in his work myself.
“from Geoffrey.
“ P.S.—cousins are coming.
“ P.S.—I will put this under my plate to-
morrow—the puddin’ one—so you can find
it wen you come for your bits.”
Next day, after luncheon, as soon as the
room was quite empty, in stole Miss
Manners on tiptoe. Hastily she ran her
eyes round the table. She knew just what

was meant for her and what should be left
for the nursery tea or dinner to-morrow —she
knew, because she was Miss Manners;
though perhaps there was something fairy-
like about her besides.
She found a raspberry and some cream
on Ehona’s plate, some crumbs of sponge
cake on Tony’s, and a little home-made
ginger beer in Geoff s glass.
Of these she daintily partook.
Before she went, she lifted Geoff’s
pudding plate and found his note.
Then the little maid left the house with-
out being seen and went away down the
country lane to the village, and beyond —
to her own house, where the word “ Home ”
was written on the door.
The sun was just turning over on to his


left side. The nursery clock struck five.
A happy little procession came clattering
down the carpetless oak staircase, through
the hall, and out into the garden.
Winkie.
Geoffrey, Ehona, and Tony and the
cousins, each carrying a pudding-like blue
pocket - handkerchief, brand new, and
purchased by mamma that very morning


at the village shop. Even Winkie was not
without his little blue bundle—his was tied
round his neck, and in it was a delicious
little chop bone.
Trot trot trot, away they went to where
the hay shone like a hill of real gold in
/
the rich light of the setting sun. Over
went the handkerchiefs and over went
they, tumbling and tossing the hay high
in the air.
Geoff was just wondering why Miss
Manners had not appeared, when he heard
the click of the garden gate and there
she was, coming down the avenue, her
light steps breaking into a run as she
caught sight of them.
She wore her blue bundle dangling on
a crooked stick swung over her shoulder.
Then the fun began.

They played at hide-and-seek in the
hay and afterwards at a new game called
Prisoners.
Geoff of course was the General, and
the others were divided into two sides,
"We are not dead I we’re alive.”
his soldiers and the enemy. He always
had more enemy than soldiers for that
made it so much more glorious to win,
and somehow his side always did win the
battle. This is how they played.


- V..
They played hide-and-seek in the hay.




The enemy were chased until all caught,
and at length taken prisoners and put on
top of the hay until their fate had been
decided upon. Then they were led out
into the field to be beheaded, and the
General, coming later to see for himself
that it had been done, would find them
all buried in hay up to their necks, so
that nothing but heads could be seen,
and he would say —
“ Yes, rightly done, here are the heads,
where are the bodies ? ” And the answer
would be, “ They were flung into the river
at day-break, sir.”
Then the General would cry, “ Good ! ”
and walk away with hands behind his back
like Napoleon, and up would jump the
prisoners from behind him, crying—
“We are not dead! we’re alive, we’re


alive,” and so the game would begin again
with another chase and go on until too hot
and breathless for more they would fling
themselves in weary, panting heaps on
the grass.
But to-day the battle did not go so well
as usual. Geoff had chosen the sides
unevenly and the enemy was beginning to
win, when the General refused to play
any more.
Fairy stories were suggested instead,
but even these did not please the young
man, for he was too cross to listen to
stories, and he interrupted and grew silly
and spoilt it for the others, and altogether
made himself so troublesome that things
began to look gloomy.
“ I don’t think we’ll tell stories just
now,” said Miss Manners gently. “ I’ve a

lovely idea. Let us think of the things
we like best of all.”
They all cuddled up closer together,
except Geoff, who, not wishing to be agree-
able, went away by himself on the other side
of the hay-cock out of sight. They didn’t
mind or want a crosspatch to join them.
“ I like Christmas trees,” said Thora.
“ And me dolls,” said Hermione.
“ My favourite of all is jelly in a little
glass,” said Tony.
“ Marbles,” said John.
“ Winkie,” said Rhona.
“ No, no, you can’t say live things,
can you ? or I say mother,” protested
Christopher.
“ No, no ! ” said the chorus.
“ Then I love soap bubbles when they
are blown through a pipe,” said Rhona.


“ Pistols and flags and swords and
trumpets,” said a voice from over the hay.
“ You’re not in this game,” called one.
“ Oh yes, Geoff is playing too, I want
you all,” said Miss Manners.
“ Don’t want to play. Won’t play.
I’m not a baby,” said the gruff voice.
Miss Manners showed no surprise at
this remark, but all the same she quietly
got up and went round to where the sulky
boy was sitting, and smiled at him in a
comical sort of way that he did not quite
understand.
“ Would you like to play with Master
Fellow?” she asked in an undertone so
that the others should not hear. “ You
will get all your own way at his place.”
Geoff looked delighted.
“He lives beyond the village, and you


had better go through the wood, and you
will find his house
hidden in some tall
trees, near the de-
serted farm.”
“ Can I go
asked Geoff, “with
out being asked ? ”
“Oh dear, yes!
that will not
matter! His
friends never
wait to be
asked.”
So saying

went back to

the children, and when Geoff had dis-
appeared in the direction of the wood,


she searched for Nanny and said to
her.
“ Don’t send to look for him, I know
where he has gone, and I know that he
will come back himself.”
And now to follow Geoff.
Relieved and proud to be free to do
as he liked, he ran off gaily in search of
adventure. Down the garden, through the
wood, out at the little gate into the high
road and on to the village. The deserted
farm came next and behind it stood the
tall trees described by Miss Manners.
It was getting a little dark and the gate
was hard to find, but at last he came upon
it, to discover that it opened easily, and
no wonder, for there was no latch upon
it. The path was untidy and full of weeds,
and there were hardly any flowers in the

.


beds. But plenty of light gleamed out
from the windows and he could hear laughter
and boys’ voices as he neared the house,
which made his heart go all jumpy with
expectation.
This was much, much jollier than listen-
ing to silly stories, thought he, and as the
door was wide open, he walked in without
knocking.
“ Hallo ! who are you ? ” asked a big
rough-looking boy, “nobody asked you to
come.”
“No, but I thought ” stammered
Geolf, feeling very uncomfortable.
“ Oh, never mind, you can play with us
if you like. No need to look frightened.”
The other boys laughed, and Geoff felt
he was the youngest there, instead of the
eldest as was the case at home. But soon


he forgot this and joined in their romping.
And how they did romp. Helter skelter
round the room, up on to the tables and
chairs in their dirty boots, rough and noisy
they were and no one to stop them. They
just did exactly as they liked.
At first when they all talked at once
and interrupted and contradicted, Geoff
thought them dreadfully funny, and he did
the same. The house did not feel comfort-
able, it was dusty and untidy, the chairs
and sofas were dirty and broken from being
jumped upon, but Geoff thought it all the
better for playing in and told himself it
must be nice, for were they not all doing
what they wanted? So he joined in the
games and pushed and fought with the
worst of them.
When Master Fellow kicked the cat,

Geoff laughed and pulled its tail, till pussy

chairs, Geoff stuck some in too, and then

cried and grew angry, and pulled flowers
and trampled on those . And they argued
and giggled, and said “ I won’t,” and
whispered, and nudged, and pointed.
Weren’t they naughty?
By and by they began to slide down the


bannisters. This was one of the things
that Geoff had never been allowed, but
always longed to do. The staircase was
steep and the bannisters were narrow, and
the noisy boys leapt up two steps at a time.
Then came the start, hoop ! swish! schwoop !
away they went like lightning, but alas,
Geoff was not so clever, and as his turn
came, the joy of sliding only lasted for a
moment, when, with a yell, he slipped and
lost his balance, and with arms clutching
wildly in the air, he fell with a thud, thud,
thud, over and over down the last six
steps.
How he bawled and cried. No one was
sorry. No one helped him up. Master
Fellow said greedily, “ I shall have his cakes
for tea now, he won’t want any. Cry-baby
had better go home,” and there they left

him, holding his hand up to his bleeding
head.
But Geoff did not go home. He
limped after them in to tea, remembering
his own cake and bread and jam which he
had left in the blue handkerchief. Had
they untied them all yet, he wondered.
Everything being ready they sat down
just where they pleased, and nobody said
grace. Master Fellow helped himself
before his guests, and grabbed for the
biggest peach, and they all left the bread
and butter and took the cakes first, and can
you believe it, they licked the sugar off.
He saw Master Fellow cut his big peach in
half, and scream and drop the knife, for
there inside it was a grub.
Now a horrid thing happened. You
will remember that there was no one to tell


them when they had had enough, and so
they all ate far too much, and when people
eat too much they generally feel ill.
Poor Geoff felt horribly sick and giddy
from the noise and heat, and all the food
“When people eat too much.”
and the fall he had had, and he thought if
only he could get out of the room without
being noticed, he might be better.
The others were all looking very green
and miserable too, and far too unhappy to
think of anything but themselves, so he


quietly slipped from his place and crept out
into the hall.
Now to escape! He tried the front
door. Alas !it was locked. Dreading that
they might stop him from getting away,
and nearly at his wits’ end, he fled upstairs
without thinking, and came to a little
untidy room on the first landing. It was
littered with muddy boots and watercans,
and shavings, and feather pillows, and
brushes, flung in disorder over the floor.
The bed was unmade and crumpled, the
curtains were torn.
It was evidently Master Fellow’s bed
room.
Geoff rushed in and looked from the
window to the ground below.
It was not very far, but too far to jump.
Luckily a rope was hanging from the sill.


Some one had probably been playing slides
with it. Geoff could not slide, but hearing
the boys racing up after him, he seized
hold, and half slipped, half fell to the
bottom, but as he arrived—Oh! . . .
Oh ! ... 00000 ! He was nearly choked
and smothered and drowned in a rush of
horrid sticky things, and hard things, and
soft things, and cold water that came falling
on top of him from above.
As he gasped for breath he could hear
the cruel laughing of the boys overhead.
With this in his ears, and his eyes half
blind from the water, he regained his
footing and groped his way down the path
to the gate. As soon as he could see
properly he noticed it had grown dark out-
side. Dark, and he must go home alone!
Why had no one missed him or sent for

him? It seemed a little curious. Dared
he venture back alone ? He must, for
never again would he enter that dreadful
house. Near the gate he heard a sound
that made him start guiltily, but it was only
some one crying, a strange little girl, in a
hood that nearly hid her face.
“ What’s up ? ”
“ I’m crying for you,” answered she.
“ I’m all right.”
She seemed to be watching his forehead,
and he suddenly remembered he had no
hat on, and that she could see the cut
he had got from the edge of the stair.
“ That’s nothing,” he said.
“I wouldn’t go there if I were you,”
she answered, looking towards the house.
“They bully little boys, and make little
girls cry. No one likes Master Fellow
4


nor any of his friends, they are only Fellows

too, they are cruel and unkind.”


As she said this Geoff thought of how
he had spent that evening, and in his mind
he could see Nanny turning her back upon
him when he got in, and Ehona’s horror at
his torn, dirty clothes, and mamma asking
if he were really quite safe after all, and
papa suggesting a punishment, and Tony
as usual trying to beg him off, but he
was not going to be afraid of any one,
he
Without waiting to hear another word
he brushed past the little girl and made
for home as fast as he could. Hatless,
he ran, past the farm and on to the wood.
He knew his way now, almost with his
eyes shut, but once inside the little gate,
and alone with the darkness, it was a very
different matter. Geoff had never been
in the wood by night before, and his


own familiar playground was his own no
longer.
Where he had been the hunter, he now
felt himself the hunted. Where he had
shot down the enemy and escaped unhurt,
he now saw armies of Red Indians waiting
in the undergrowth to spring out in reality
and revenge themselves upon him. The
trees wore strange shapes, with giant arms,
and (what was that sound ? he hid behind
a fallen bough) all the wood had come to life
and was bearing down upon him, like a
horrible nightmare, only far, far worse, for
he knew he was not safely in bed dreaming,
but awake all alone in the middle of the
night, and just about to be eaten by wild
beasts. Then he thought he saw a snake
and he jumped and screamed aloud,
but it was only a squirrel. Again what


was that? This time Geoff’s hair stood
Red Indians waiting in the undergrowth.
on end, and trembling at the knees, too
terrified to move a step, he heard the dry


leaves crackling, and something big and
alive moving and sniffing through them,
coming nearer and nearer. In the distance
there gleamed a small red light, Geoff knew
what this meant—Eyes ! The dragon !
What of the brave Warrior Chief—
where was he now ? ah, no! It was only
Geoffrey who stood waiting there, only a
little boy after all, very tired and sick with
fear. White to the lips, in his terror he
could only think of hiding on the ground
among the Indians and snakes. There he
huddled himself into a ball, and there the
something that moved through the leaves
came closer and closer, until its breath was
on his cheek, and with a little joyous bark-
ing sound it pounced upon him.
What do you think it was? Not a
wild animal; not a dragon; but Winkie!

and not far behind him, Murket with a
lantern.
A few minutes later saw a forlorn and
humble little boy gladly holding the hand
of the kind-hearted gardener, being taken
in silence to the house.
As they passed through the garden Geoff
even noticed the scent of the roses, and
found himself carefully jumping over a
violet bed so as not to tread on the
flowers.
Cousins had gone home. Ehona and
Tony were in bed and asleep, and it
was nine by the grandfather’s clock in
the hall! Here Murket left him. Geoff
found no one waiting for him. No one
was anxious. Could it be that no one
wanted him, while he, instead, was wanting
them?


Only Nanny, after she had taken off
his dreadful clothes, all torn and dirty
(without scolding him), and bathed his cuts
and scratches, and brushed him sweet and
clean again—only Nanny, he thought, as
she tucked him in, looked strange, as if she
had been crying.
If she had scolded he would have
felt better, but no, she even brought
him his piece of chocolate and mug of
milk.
But Geoff could not eat or drink.
It was his mug with the motto on it,
and as he watched the scrolly letters with
his eyes, his mind saw something else.
It saw the little girl standing at the gate,
and for the first time he realised that
beneath the hood had been nearly hidden
the face of Miss Manners.

Bursting into tears he buried his head

PART II
THE MAN




LISTEN !
Now weeks and weeks have flown away
And it is nearly Christmas Day.
No leaves make green the countryside,
For glist’ning snows the branches hide.
Miss Manners’ house looks gaunt and
white—
But lift the blind—a diff’rent sight
Of warmth and rosy fire-glow
In rooms above and rooms below;
And with a feather pen she writes,
And Rhona, Tony, Geoff invites
On Christmas Eve to come to tea,
And dance around her Christmas tree;
And Cousins too, she bids them bring,
The more the merrier to sing.
61


And seven bowls stand in a row,
A pipe in each for them to blow
Soap bubbles, purple, green, and pink;—
And something else —what do you think?
In seven little glasses clear
The jelly Tony holds so dear.
Pistols, and trumpets, flag, and drum,
With swords that cut, and tops that
hum;
Fine marbles too, and bat and ball —
Miss Manners has remembered all.


PART 11.
THE MAN.
that dreadful evening Geoffrey
never forgot Master Fellow, but he
had no wish to go and see him again,
you may be sure. The black eye and cut
head had taken a long time to get well,
and when people had asked him how
he came by them, he did not at all like
telling that it was because he had been
naughty.
Geoffrey was afraid he must have
offended Miss Manners very badly, because
she had not appeared to them since, and
weeks and weeks had passed away. He

wanted her to come back, to tell her that
he was not a Fellow any more, and to ask
her to show him how to be a Man, like
Daddy. To be a man was Geoffrey’s

greatest wish, and he felt now that Miss
Manners held the secret.
At first, when he missed her, he had
thought to coax her back by trying to be

Helped Rhona with her sum when she was crying.




good for a whole day. This, of course,
was rather difficult for a little boy, and
he generally forgot, about lesson time;
but at least he had tried a little, and
to try is half the battle. He had learnt
from Master Fellow that to be greedy and
rude was not at all manly; and once,
remembering this, he had left the nicest
biscuit on the dish, but he had not seen
Miss Manners come for it, though he hid
in the room and watched. It was a curious
thing, but Geoff found that just from
wanting her to come back, things went
better.
He let Tony play with his football,
and it was quite easy, because he thought
in his mind Miss Manners would be glad
if he did.
Another time he helped Ehona with her
5


sum when she was crying. She could not
think what to do when she was told to take
seven from six. When Geoff whispered,
“ Borrow ten! ” she told him he was
the cleverest brother in the world, and he
answered that he was a good one for sums.
But he had helped her, and he wondered
if Miss Manners would be as pleased as
Ehona was.
So this was how, little by little, Geoff
found that his brother and sister began to
like to play with him, when they used to
run away and play by themselves.
Well, time had passed on. The lovely
green leaves had turned into deeper
colours, and in all the reds and yellows of
Autumn they had fallen to the ground.
Such a crisp carpet they made. The
children said it was like walking on chip

potatoes to feel them crackling under their
feet.
Then Murket swept them all away with
a broom just as long as the one the old
woman used when she swept the cobwebs
off the sky.
Now that December was here there was
not a flower to be seen except in the green-
house, and not even mother was allowed
to pick those.
The garden was white with snow, and
little flakes like baby stars were falling.
Rhona liked to stand with her head back
and mouth open while they drifted in and
melted on her warm little tongue.
It was nearly Christmas when one
morning a small, white envelope fell in at
the letter box. Imagine the excitement
the children were told it contained

an invitation from Miss Manners to a party

but cousins could not go as one of them
had measles, and the others would have to
stay at home or they might carry the


infection with them. Besides, Nanny said
they were sure to get them too. Poor
cousins! no treats, nor parties, nor snow-
balls for them this Christmas. Only to
lie in bed, covered with little spots which
would not wash off even with soap.
Cousins lived in another big house
and had a mamma and papa of their
own, so the invitation was sent for them
to see, for an invitation was better than
nothing.
Christmas Eve —and the children, very
well wrapped up, were told they might walk
to the party with Nanny, who was to leave
them there, and the motor was to call for
them at six.
“ I like this better than sand,” said
Tony, as they scrunched through the snow

along the white road to where Miss
Manners lived.
“You can’t make castles of it,” said
Rhona.
They walk to the party with Nanny,
“Yes, if you slap it a lot, till its
hard; and men too. Murket told me,”
said Geoff.
Winkie liked the snow too, and began

to roll in it and kick it about, and snort
with his nose buried in it, so that he
seriously rumpled the big red bow which
had been tied round his neck to make him
a smart dog. But Winkie thought nothing
of clothes.
On their way they came to the village
church of St. Martin, where mother had
been decorating all the morning, and
Murket had carried over some of the best
plants from the conservatories.
“May we have just one little look
inside?” asked Rhona, “to see where mv
j «/
cross is, that I made ? ”
Nanny agreed, and as they peeped in
through the oak door they spied it hung on
the font.
“There is Saint Martin,” said Rhona
softly ; “ this church is called Saint Martin’s


after him.” And she nodded towards a
picture near by.
4 ‘Who is Saint Martin?” asked Geoff.
“ He was a soldier and a saint, mother
says,” replied Ehona, overjoyed to be able
to tell Geoff anything, 4 4 who had very
pretty manners.”
44 He gave half his coat to a poor
beggar,” chimed in Tony.
44 Would you like to be a soldier and a
saint? ” asked Nanny of Geoff.
44 I’m going to be a soldier,” he replied.
44 I’m afraid I can’t manage both ; but would
you like to be a saint, Tony ? ” he said, turn-
ing to his brother.
44 Sorry I tan’t,” said Tony apologetic-
ally, 44 cause I’m goin’ to be a groom and
a goblin.”
So Ehona, to be obliging, said she would


be the saint, and if it had not been for her
twinkling eyes, that halo of golden curls
had made a good beginning.
Geoff and Tony held their hats in their
hands as they stood in the porch looking in.
This is what they saw.
A little fir tree had been placed under
each arch and they looked like baby
Christmas trees, and the chancel was a
mass of white flowers and holly berries.
In front of the altar was burning steadily,
one glowing red lamp.
“ When Saint Martin comes in here at
night he’ll see that red light, and then he
won’t be frightened,” whispered Ehona, who
was thinking she would have to live in a
church precisely the same as this when she
was a saint.
Nanny, who did not want them to be


late, hurried them away here, and before
very long they came in sight of a stately
mansion standing white and tall in the
snow. Grey smoke was curling out of the
chimneys up into the sky, and as they came
nearer they could see that there were red
blinds and spotless white curtains hanging
in the windows.
The garden path had been swept clean
of snow for them to walk upon, and there
was a shining brass knocker which looked
as if it had been polished and polished,
and the word “ Home ” was written on
the door.
Rat-tat-tat-tat!
“ Good-bye Nanny ! ”
“ Good-bye, good-bye ! ” and the door
was swung open.
Miss Manners came into the hall to


meet them, and made them feel that she
was very very glad to see them.
She was a wonderful little girl. Every-
thing she did and said seemed just exactly
right.
Geoff had been afraid that she might
look crossly at him, but she could not have
remembered, he thought, for she was just as
nice and smiling to him as to the others.
This house was not at all like Master
Fellow’s. It was shining and clean, and
just as exactly right as Master Fellow’s was
exactly wrong.
They took off their wraps and wet boots
and put on their light house shoes which
they had brought in a bag, and then Miss
Manners led them along the corridor to a
warm room with a soft carpet. A fine fire
blazed at one end, and a round writing table


stood at the other end, on which was an
ink-pot and a white quill pen.
On the walls were some pictures of
children in gold frames.
“ This is my own sitting-room,” she told
them, “ where I write with my angel pen.”
“Why is it your angel pen?” asked
Rhona.
“ Because it only writes of kind and
good things that people have said and done.
I think it must have fallen out of an angel’s
wing,” said Miss Manners, as she lovingly
ran her fingers along the feathery part.
As the cousins had not come Miss
Manners had invited some other children,
and when they had made friends they began
a grand game of hunt the slipper.
Miss Manners played too; it was she
who led the romping and the clapping and

jokes. No one cried or got hurt, and oh,
how they enjoyed it all.
After the games Miss Manners said she
would tell them about her pictures. “ They


are portraits of people whom I have loved
and who have loved me,” she exclaimed.
“Of boys who all grew to be men; and
girls who were nearly angels.”
“Who are they?” asked one of the
children.
“ In that frame is the picture of a very
polite man. Do you know what he did?
He took off his cloak and spread it in the
mud for Queen Elizabeth to walk upon, so
that she should not soil her shoes. His
name is Sir Walter Raleigh. In this frame
is John Halifax,” she continued, as they
moved on. “He lived among Fellows
when he was a little boy but he was always
a Man. Here, look! is Sir John Manners.
He was a relation of mine. And that ”
“ That’s King Edward as a little boy, I
know him right enough,” interrupted Geoff.

Pulled crackers and put on the caps.

“I call him 4 My Gentleman of England,’ ”
added Miss Manners, taking all the credit.
She went on to tell them that there
were far too many people whom she had
loved, with kind hearts, who had good
manners, for her to possess pictures of them
all at once. 44 So the pictures are always
changing while the frames remain the same,
and when I come in here I never know
who is going to look down at me from
the wall; but I always know there will
be somebody, for people with good manners
have kind hearts, and kind hearts never
die.
44 Once I thought I saw a little boy
trying to look through; his face was
only dim and distant and not formed. I
thought it was you , Geoff! ”
Geoff started

looking wise.


Dingle, dingle, dingle, went the tea
bell, and off they marched, two by two,
to the dining-room.
Miss Manners said grace, and then
they commenced on bread and butter
with hundreds and thousands, which made
it more Christmassy than the everyday
nursery kind. There was a big cake with
A Merry Christmas on it in icing sugar.
There were bananas and plates of little
apples. They were all little ones, for Miss
Manners said the smallest were always the
sweetest, and Tony noticed there was the
kind of jelly he liked best in little glasses
waiting to be eaten by him.
Yes, they certainly had a lovely tea,
and at the last pulled crackers and put
on the caps out of them.
No one wanted to go home.

was glad of it. He was afraid he might
come without being asked, but no! Miss


Manners must have kept the party a secret
from him.
The lamps were turned out, and when
the children could see again, there, as if
it had sprung up through the floor—stood
a lovely surprise—a Christmas tree gleam-
ing and glittering with candles, and bright
and floating gold and silver stuff like rain
in the sunlight.
It was dazzling, and they literally
screamed with joy.
But soon they saw that no presents were
hung on the tree. All that they could
make out were seven bowls full of soap-
suds and seven clay pipes in a row on
the carpet.
“ Now let us sing like the little Danish
children, while we are dancing round the
tree ! ” cried Miss Manners.


“ The Queen came from Denmark,”
said some one.
“Yes! and so did the first Christmas
trees. Long, long ago there in the North
they hung no toys in the branches but
Danced like gnomes.
only little candles as a sign of joy that
the shortest days were over and the light
of Spring was at hand.”
As she said this, Miss Manners danced
up with both arms out, and they all took

hands and sang like a lot of little gnomes,
prancing round the tree—
Wake! oh Spirit of the Tree,
Blink your shiny eyes at me!
Winters shortest days are sped,
Brighter ones will dawn instead.
Rub your eyes and stretch your limbs,
While we sing our Christmas hymns—
Sorrow’s darkest days are sped,
Joy is chiming overhead !
“Now, sit down, good children,” said
Miss Manners.
Every one sat down.
There was a hush through the room,
and a general air of goodness reigned until
Tony was heard to ask wistfully—
“Mayn’t we never be naughty? Not
even a teeny bit ? ”
“Yes, you may,” was the prompt reply.
“ Come over here and I’ll tell you how.”
“ And me, too,” said Ehona.


“ And me, and me.”
Miss Manners’ eyes shone with merriment
as she spoke.
“You may
forget things
sometimes, if
you don’t forget
on purpose.”
“Yes, yes,”
they cried with
delight.
“You may
forget to wash

may forget to shut

up your boots, or to learn your lessons,
but . . . you may not forget on purpose !
And now we are going to blow bubbles.”


.
Each child was given a bowl and a pipe.




Each child was given a bowl and a
pipe, and they were then told to blow a
number of little bubbles up into the
tree.
This they did, and to their excitement
the bubbles stayed up there, lightly balanced,
and looking like some magic fairy toy in
the glitter of the candles. This done, Miss
Manners said—
“This time blow a large bubble each
and at the same moment wish for what
you would like best. Then blow it up
into the tree and see what will happen.”
They tried to blow carefully, but what
fun it was when they laughed and the bubble
went into queer shapes, and then burst and
disappeared, all but a drop of soapy water.
Ehona was the first to make a real beauty.
Very gently she slid it from her pipe and


blew, till it floated to the top of the tree,
bounced lightly, lifted twice, and then
comfortably settled down. She had wished
for a doll with real hair and brown
eyes.
All in turn wished and blew until the
tree looked bewitched by a fairy mass of
colour, shaking and sparkling as a dragon-
fly’s wing sparkles.
Geoff was just going to blow his, when
he remembered the cousins who had had
no party, and he thought it would be nice
to blow it over to them.
He had wished for a pair of leggings
like Murket’s, but as these would not do
for them, he quickly changed his wish
in favour of the cousins, though he had
wanted the leggings for himself for a
whole year. Instead, he wished for some


chocolate money for them, round pieces,
shillings and sovereigns, wrapped in gold
and silver papers, which when you opened
A pair of leggings like Market’s.
them, turned out to be delicious chocolate
and not horrid hard money after all.
Before he had told his wish Miss


Manners had guessed it, and the window
flew open and Geoffrey took a long breath
and made a great all-coloured bubble and
softly blew it out.
Up and on it floated, above the house
and above the trees, whole and safe, higher
and higher, until they could not see it
any more, but Miss Manners could follow
it in her mind, so she told them what
she saw.
“Now it is getting nearer the cousins
house, and Hermione is looking out of the
window waiting to be put to bed, looking
at the snow which shines in the dark.
She is sad that Christopher has measles,
and sad that she was not allowed to come
to-day.
“ Now she sees the bubble ! She thinks
it must be a curious kind of moon coming

can see the picture in it of this room just
as it is at present, with the tree and all
the colours, and us, and her window is
sliding open, and Oh! the bubble has
danced on to her nose, and Oh! it has
burst in her face, and she is laughing and
clapping her hands, and calling John and
Thora, for she thinks the moon has broken
up into the gold and silver chocolate money
which is rolling all over the floor.”
Geoff had listened to this with beating
heart and he had never felt so proud before.
“ I say, Miss Manners, is that my
present to the cousins, or yours?”
“ Why, yours of course! ” said that
truthful little girl. “You gave your wish
and your bubble away to them instead of
having them yourself.”


Then the window shut, and she began
to hand down the bubbles to those who
had blown them. No sooner had she
placed one on the hand that was held out
for it than it burst, and lo and behold,
there rested instead the toy that had been
wished for. Rhona got her doll with real
hair and brown eyes, and Tony a little live
canary, which put its head on one side,
and started to sing then and there. All
got their wishes, and there were more toys
to take back for the children belonging to
the farm and a clasp-knife for Murket.
Miss Manners had remembered every one.
Was Geoff to have nothing? He felt
a little lump in his throat, for he was only
a small boy after all, and it was hard to
see all the nice presents and to be the
only one left out. But he would not ask.


Again, as if she knew his thought,
Miss Manners blew a beautiful bubble for
Geoffrey from a bowl and pipe just like
Miss Manners blew a bubble.
the others, and wished! and holding it in
her hand she said—
“ This is my good-bye party. To-night
I go away to new countries where they
think I am old fashioned. You all


know me now, and do not need me so
much as the little ones in those growing
lands. But I will return some day when
you have little boys and girls of your own.
“That might not be for nearly twenty
or a hundred years,” said Geoff. “Shall
we know you all that time off? ”
Miss Manners nodded her head.
“ Oh, yes, I am always the same—but
you may change—so I will show you a way
to remember me.”
As she spoke she held up the bubble
she had blown and looked at Geoff.
Geoff saw and heard nothing but Miss
Manners.
“ See,” she said, “ this carries my por-
trait. If you do not lose it, you will grow
into a man.” That was her wish.
In it gleamed the colours of the rain-


\\W'
bow, and the picture of them all and the
tree, and somehow, if you peered closer,
you could see through it all the figure of
Miss Manners like a fairy looking on.
It burst in the hand.
As he watched, Geoff held his breath,
not to blow out the bubble, and then
standing a little way off he cried—
“ Oh, if only bubbles wouldn’t burst!


I’d rather have a bubble that didn’t burst,
than anything in the world.”
“Then this is what you are wanting,”
she said, “ for this is a bubble that will
never burst.”
Geoff’s eyes opened wide with amaze-
ment.
“Not if I bang it against the wall?”
he asked.
“ Not even then! Here, catch it! ”
she exclaimed, and with a dear little silvery
laugh she threw it into his outstretched
hands, where it lay glistening like a huge
dew-drop in all the colours of the morning.
“ Mine ? Did you say for me ? ”
“Your very own.”
Rhona caught her breath. “Oh Geoff-
rey ! it is so lovely—may I kiss it ? ” But
Geoff was puzzling out what it could be


made of. Glass? No. Rubber? No. Ice?
No. He could not bend it, he could not
break it. It was light, but strong. Then
he gave up guessing and cuddled it under
his arm joyfully.
Six o’clock.
“ Hoot, toot,” said the motor car.
“ Good-bye, dear Miss Manners,” said
the children. We have enjoyed ourselves
ever and ever so.”
“ Thank you dreadfully much, it
bounces beautifully,” said Geoff, and he
remembered to let Rhona skip into the car
before he jumped in himself.
“Woof, woof!” said Winkie.
“ Hoot, toot! ” said the motor again,
and away they went over the hill, disappear-
ing into a white cloud of tumbling snow.


In that cloud of snow Miss Manners
vanished, house and all, but her memory in
the shape of a many-coloured bubble had
been carried away over the hill clasped close
to Geoffrey’s heart, to be kept in safety
until she herself should return to visit the
little children of —
The Soldier, the Saint, and the Goblin.


In that cloud of snow Miss Manners vanished, house and all.




FAREWELL!
Dear, now she’s gone we’ll write no more,
But don’t forget the nursery door!
When least we think, she may appear,
So only say what she would hear.
She lives indeed, our nursery queen,
We know it, you and I, who’ve seen!
Do, therefore, leave upon the dish
Just such a piece as she might wish.
And as we all much older grow,
Those bits remaining are to show
We’ve left them—not for her to take,
But simply for Miss Manners’ sake.
