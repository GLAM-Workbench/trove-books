PREFACE
Some of these jingles were strung together to
amuse my children when they were very young.
I forgot the rhymes, but they remembered them,
and what greater reward can one have than that?
Some years ago “The Man from Menindie” won
the Bulletin prize for the best Australian Nursery
Rhyme. Later, a few were published in Country
Life, and here I make due acknowledgment for
permission to reprint. I showed the cuttings to a
publisher, and he said it was a pity there was not
enough of them to make a book. That was easily
remedied, and here they are. There is a self-
portrait of me at the top of this page, intended
to create a favorable impression.

CLIPPITY - CLIPPITY - CLIPPITY - CLOP;

SOME CATS ARE LIKE THAT
DARKY, OUR CAT,
IS NOT VERY GOOD.
HE WILL NOT BEHAVE
AS A GOOD CAT SHOULD.
He sleeps all the day
And has other bad habits.
He eats little birds
And blue-tongues and
rabbits.
He fights with the dogs
And stays out all night.
Dad says he’ll get shot,
And

HER VERY OWN BIRTHDAY
A WHOLE YEAR OLDER
THAN I WAS A YEAR AGO.
EVERYBODY’S S’PRISDER
AT THE WAY I GROW.
When I woke this morning
Dad and Mum says,
“Bless you, pet,”
And wished me lots
OF NICE
BIRTH-
DAYS.
Birthdays come
but once a year,
But when they do,
we’re glad
they’re here.

DINKUM
DINGO DAN
I’m wild and woolly
and full of fleas,
I’m hard to curry below the knees:
I’m Dinkum Dingo Dan of
Bungendore.
I run the ranges every night,
I snarl and growl,
and bark and fight;
While big, strong men
go pale with fright
And see that the doors
are all shut tight
When they hear my
“W oo-00, wow, yow,
■x Yah-aa, bow wow I”
Scared stiff
to hear a sniff
from
\ Dinkum Dingo Dan
of Bungendore.

“G’D EVENIN’!”
BULLOCKY BILL IS CAMPED.
ON THE CREEK; V
SPELLING HIS BULLOCKS
FOR OVER A WEEK.
Abdol, Baldy
and Candyman,
Digger, Twicer
and Fryingpan.
Ginger, Hori
and In\ypoo,
Jac\cr, Kewpie
and Loafer, who
Will very soon now be off on the
track again,
And nobody knows just when
they’ll be back again.


“BELIEVE IT—OR BELIEVE IT NOT -
JOSEPH and JAMES
were such nice
little boys,
Jigsaws and chess were their
favorite toys.
They never played vulgar or
dangerous games;
Such nice little boys were
JOSEPH and JAMES
PETER and PAUL were rougher than bags,
Their hair always tousled,
_ s~<\ their clothing in rags.
If anyone anywhere
heard of a brawl,
They knew where to look
\ \ for PETER and PAUL.

BUSH BABS


—AS MEN THEY WERE A SPLENDID LOT—
OBSERVE THE
LOVELY HATS
THEY’VE GOT”
PETER and JOSEPH
and JAMES and PAUL
Grew up to be very
fine men after all.
And no one could tell—
without
knowing their names
JOSEPH from PAUL
or PETER
from
TAMES.


THE CRANE AND THE KANGAROO
Said the big, blue Crane to the Kangaroo:
“There are two things I don’t like about you.
You have clumsy legs,
And you can’t lay eggs.”
Said the Kangaroo to the big, blue Crane:
“I’ve said it before, and I say it again;
You have too thin legs.
And you will lay eggs.”
So the Rabbit told the ’Possum, and the ’Possum told the Bees,
That of all the funny songs they knew, the funniest were these:
“You have clumsy legs”
And “You will lay eggs,”


THE MAN FROM MENINDIE
The Man from Menindie was counting sheep.
He counted so hard that he went to sleep.
He counted by threes,
And he counted by twos,
The rams and the lambs
And the wethers and ewes.
He counted six thousand three hundred and ten,
And when he woke up he’d to count them again.
Here you see the Man asleep as he dreams of counting sheep.


"ALWAYS PLAY THE GAME”
When I grow up I’m going to be a cricketer and play
In Interstate and Test and make a big score every day.
Whatever stuff they pitch at
me
Across the fence I’ll nick it;
And, when I bowl, I’ll be the
one
Who collars every wicket.
And if I dont,
At least you’ll know
I gave them all
A
DINKUM
GO.


CHRISTMAS EVE
Christmas comes but once a year,
But when it comes it’s jolly;
Although we haven’t any snow,
We’ve lots of paper holly.
And for our Christmas dinner
There is turkey and there’s ham;
A fruity Christmas pudding
And forty sorts of jam.
There’s wine and lemon-squash
to drink.
And Dad says “Mum, my dear!
A Merry Christmas to us all
And quite a good New Year.”
He kisses Mum, and I go round
And let them both kiss me.
I’m hanging up my sock to find
Out what my luck may be.


THE EMU’S neck and its legs are long,
It walks with a most amusing strut.
It cackles not, though the
hen-bird lays
An egg as big as a coconut.
It eats the fruit of the prickly-pear,
It roams the bush where the
scrub is dense.
It cannot fly, but it runs so hard
That it knocks a hole in a
barbed-wire fence.
The Pastoralist has a down
on it,
Though its skin may fashion
his bedside mat,
BUT—
The Poultry-farmer would be pleased
If his hens laid eggs as big as that I


AND THE ’ROO
JUMPED OVER
THE MOON
THE KANGAROO is a splendid
jumper;
Short forelegs, but its tail is a thumper.
Whether it be a girl or a boy
A baby ’roo is always a joey.
Its Ma has a pocket in front of her turn
For baby to lie in, sucking its thumb.
Of all the babes that are born, but few
Have a pram like the baby kangaroo.


THE NEW BROTHER
UP AT OUR PLACE they’ve bought a new brother.
He sleeps all the days in the bed beside mother.
He can’t do a thing
But just He and cry.
Father says that last night
He never shut an eye.
He hasn’t any hair,
And his eyes are shut tight.
He hasn’t any teeth,
But they say he’s all right.
When I buy a brother of my own, you’ll see
That they can’t
push a half-
finished one
on to
ME


GROWING-PAINS
“JIM THINKS HE’S JACKY, now he’s in long pants;
Strides about the place as if it all belonged to him.
Gee! I’d like to take and fill ’em full of red ants;
That would put the wind up big-brother Jim.
WHAT’S LONG PANTS?”
Everybody gets them
When they’re big enough
Jim’s a year older—
The great big bluff.
“I have something up my sleeve to show him what,
and which is,
Mother for my birthday’s going to buy me /
riding breeches. /
WHATS LONG PANTS?”




SOLDIERS-TO-BE OF THE KING
With rattle and thud of drum
And rhythm of marching feet,
The soldiers-to-be of the King come
Parading along the street.
Their banners flaunt in the sun,
The bugles brazenly blare;
Each little Wolf-Cub thinks he is the one
That gathered the multitude there.
Ta ra ra,
Ta ra ra,
Tarara Tar am,
Ta ra.
With badges for this and for that,
Their neck and their knees quite bare,
A broad-brimmed Baden-Powell hat
And their heads held high in the air;
The Boy Scouts stepping it out
With swaggering martial swing—
Oh, isn’t it great to be young
And a soldier-to-be of the King!
Ta ra ra,
Ta ra ra,
Tamm Tamm,
Ta ra.

NO COW
What would we do if
we had no Cow?
We wouldn’t like it —
Mum and me.
Dad says he’d get along
somehow,
Even if w T e never, ever
had a Cow,
But then, you see —
That’s ’cause he
Don’t ta\e ever any
Milk, in his tea.
So long as we’ve plenty
of corned-beef
And pickled mutton to
sharpen our tecf,
And lots of damper and
—things like that,
He ’dares to goodness
we’d all be fat.

YOU NEVER KNOW—
YOU KNOW
I’VE NEVER SEEN A NATIVE BEAR,
BUT DADDY SAYS WHEN HE
WAS A LITTLE BOY LIKE ME
There were dozens and dozens
of Native Bears
climbing in every tree.
An’ Mum says “You do eks-aggy-rate, Dad”; but I
don’t know what that means.
I’ll ask Aunty how it spells—
And then I’ll look it up in the Die.,
And if Dad
has been pulling my leg—
I’ll give him
BEANS!


“UP ABOVE THE CLOUDS
SO HIGH”
I HAVE AN AEROPLANE;
GEE! IT’S A FLIER.
JUST NOW IT WENT UP
HIGHER AND HIGHER.
You twists its ’peller round and round —
The Tastic twists insider.
She’s not a really aeroplane,
But —she’s a really glider.
You twist her up
And chuck her up
And—
W hizzzz-zz-zz-z
away she goes;
An’ glides an’ slides
An’ slides and glides
An’ bumps down on her
NOSE!


THE DINGO
When the nights are calm and still,
And the sheep have ate their fill,
If you hear the Dingo howling,
Soon the house-dog will be growling.
How unhappy he must be!
All the long night wanders he.
Never kindly word he hears,
Cock he ever so his ears.
Sometimes in his midnight rambles
With the silly sheep he gambols;
Tickles them beneath the chin —
Such a mess they do get in.
Some gay sheep-dogs, it is said,
He hath into mischief led.
And then for them the awful fate
Of trap, or gun, or poison bait.


THE TWO OLD MATES
MULLOCKY TOM AND JIMMY HELLO
ARE FOSSICKING DOWN ON THE FLAT.
TOM SAYS JIMMY’S MAD AS A SNAKE,
AND JIMMY SAYS TOM HAS A RAT.
They live in a hut and are very good friends;
They’re both of them terribly old.
They always seem to be filling their pipes,
But not getting
i 1 very much gold.
One of them is
Jimmy and the
other one is
Tom.
Tom says, if he finds a big nugget he’ll go
And live at O’Brien’s Hotel;
But Jimmy says any old slug will do him —
He’s due for a bit of a spell.


“WE DO HAVE SUCH FUN”
Little Jimsey Littleboy lives next door —
Ten miles, maybe a little bit more.
When Daddy’s not using the two-seater car,
And Mum thinks Jimsey’s isn’t too far;
She rings his Mum on the ’phone to say
That I’m coming over to spend the day.
JIMSEY AND ME PLAY
SUCH FUNNY GAMES —
SOME THAT WE Don’t EVEN
V KNOW THE NAMES.
We have tea
( JJp and cakes,
and Mum says
“TOM!
It’s time
that we were
on our way
HOME.”

OUR PET LAMBS
Mary had a little lamb —
Ted and me have five',
And it too\ some doing
Keeping them alive.

Them buttin’ us an’ trippin’ us;
And everybody on the place
Chivvyin’ an’

Wait till they

An’ got a bit o’ sense.
They won’t be pokin’ borak

Our wool brings forty-pence.

WHEN THE LAMBS GO TO BED
LISTEN TO THE LITTLE LAMBS’ “BA-BA.”
THAT’S THEM CALLING FOR THEIR MA-MA.
Every Mama Ewe
Shows her Baby Lamb
Where the grass is in the paddock
And the water in the dam.
She keeps a little bed for it,
Where it can go to sleep
And grow up in the night to be

MR. SMITH OF TALLABUNG
HAS VERY WICKED WAYS
HE WANDERS OFF INTO THE BUSH
AND STAYS AWAY FOR DAYS
He never says he’s going;
We only know he’s gone.
There’s lots of cats like Mr. Smith,
Who like to walk alone.
He plays that he’s a tiger,
And makes the dingoes run.
He scratches emus on the legs
And plays at football with their eggs;
But does it all in fun.
And then, one day, he’s home again,
The skin all off his nose,
His ears all torn and tattered,
His face all bruised and battered,
And bindies in his toes.
He wanders round and finds a place
To sleep in in the sun,
And dream of all the wicked things
That he has been and done.
MR. SMITH OF TALLABUNG
MAY BE A BAD CAT;
BUT EVERYBODY LIKES HIM—
SO THAT’S JUST THAT.


THE HAWKER
“Motherl
Here’s the Hawker
■> G&r Cornin’ down the road.
Three horses this time—
He must have a load.
Yards of pretty cretonnes,
Strings of lovely beads;
Pretty nearly everything
That anybody needs.”
So, one time, to strange ports, did Merchant
Traders come;
Seeding tus\s of ivory and red Jamaica rum.
Anchoring their galleons beyond marauding reach;
Spreading out their merchandise on an alien beach.
“Jim has forty rabbit skins,
Dad has hundreds more;
There’s half a bale of dead wool
Behind the stable door.
You want a pair of new shoes;
And Kitty’s frock’s in rags;
The eiderdown on my bed
Is made of sugar-bags.”
Steel blades from Sheffield Town, sables from the Don;
Sil\ and spice from China, and gems from Prester John.
"King! there cometh strange ships o’er the waters broad."
" Mother! here’s the Hawser cornin’ down the road!'


THE PICCANINNY
Little, laughing Piccaninny with the bulgy bingy;
Eyes like blazing opals and complexion rather dingy.
Clothes don’t bother you a bit, cap nor pants nor pinny;
Mother never says you are a naughty piccaninny.
All the bush is kin to you,
Sunlit plain and sandy.
Lizard, Parrot, Cockatoo,
Native Bear and Kangaroo—
Playmates nice and handy.
Night comes and the wurley is
The house for you to creep in.
You as happy as I am
With painted bed to sleep in.
No one makes you brush your teeth—goanna, crow
and bunny,
Roasted ’possum, nardoo seeds, keep you fat and
funny.
You’re black—so dirty marks don’t
show,
And though your legs are skinny,
You are and always will be just
A laughing piccanniny.


THE KAT-GAROO
kang-Fells
domestricus
Australis
THE KANGAROO CAT, or the Katgaroo,
Has, so far, only been seen by few.
For Somebody, only the other day, drew
The identical one that is looking at you.
“There’s no such animal,” Somepeople said;
Somebody smiled and nodded his head.
“You have Kangaroo Rats,
So why shouldn’t you
Have Kangaroo Cats
Or a Katgaroo?”


THE PLATYPUS
THE DUCKBILLED PLATYPUS
or ORNYTHORHYNCHUS
Grows to fourteen or fifteen inches;
With a nose like a duck and a tail like
an otter,
He lives both in and out of the water.
The Ornythorhynchus or Duckbilled
Platypus,
All Zoologists make of him a fuss.
When orni and jauni were much less
fussy,
Duck plus cat equalled platypussy. G== "


I SEE YOU !
The Cockatoo, with his crest of gold . . . iVever eats
meat, so we are told . . . But he’ll hang around for days
and days . . . To sample the first of the ripening maize.
Though almost any old grain he’ll eat . . Tear holes in
bags for a bite of wheat . . . Don’t be misled by a
similar name . . . IMieat-cocky and he are not the same.
Sometimes, people in a town
Clip his wing or cage him.
Were he not a gentle bird,
How that would enrage him.
His voice may not have the Melba tone
. . . sut it has a quality all its own . . . \\
The pitch is high and the notes are u\
few ... Of the sulphur-crested 1 '
cockatoo. *


A TIME FOR EVERYTHING
Listen to the cackle of the bantam
hen.
She always likes to lay an egg at
half-past ten.
As soon as she has laid it, she feels
quite proud
And struts around the fowlyard
and clucks out loud.
The big white rooster tells her
“Cock-a-doodle-doo;
A half-past-ten
egg’s the right
thing to do.”
And all the other
hens go and lay
one, too.


J.J.J.G.
JESSICA JOSEPHINE JARDINE GILES
Was famed for her beautiful baby smiles.
People would come for miles and miles
To say “How do you do?
Good-day to you —
Miss Jessica Josephine Jardine Giles.”
JESSICA JOSEPHINE JARDINE GILES,
Now and again, when anything riles
Her, puts off her beautiful baby smiles
To cry “Yah, boo hoo—
That for you!”
Oh, Jessica Josephine Jardine Giles!
JESSICA JOSEPHINE JARDINE GILES,
When she grows up will have piles and piles
Of snapshots showing the several styles
Of the “How do you do?”
And the “Yah boo hoo”
Of Jessica Josephine Jardine Giles.


FORGETTING HER GRAMMAR, SHE CRIED
“THAT’S THEM!”
There’s ’Possums out at our place;
I’ve never really seen them.
At night they dance upon the roof;
I know it must have been them.
I don’t know what there is up there
To keep them out of bed.
I’d like to watch for them,
But I
Am such
A sleepy - head.


“HEIGHO! BLOW THE MAN DOWN”
I WANT TO BE LIKE CAPTAIN COOK
AND SAIL THE STORMY SEA;
TO MANLY, ROUND BY WATSON’S BAY,
AND BACK TO CIRCULAR QUAY.
I will not be a farmer, but
A sailor bold and brave;
Instead of ploughing paddocks
I shall plough the raging wave.


THE MAILMAN and THE THINGS HE BRINGS
On Saturdays and Wizzendays the Mailman brings
the mail.
In the trees we hear and we sometimes see his
bumpety motor-car!
He brings letters and papers for Daddy, and letters
and parcels for Mum,
Tied in brown paper with string; but I don’t know
what they are.
He has only brought me Christmas
and birthday cards as yet;
But wait till I am a man
and see the letters 'sSv
AND PAPERS \
I’LL GET. 4




DIGGER AND PHIL AND BILL
We put them on the opposite page.
They ought to be there still.
DIGGER WAS A DROVER’S DOG—
THE DROVER’S NAME WAS BILL.
HE RODE A SKEWBALD BUCKING HORSE;
THE HORSE’S NAME WAS PHIL.
And when Phil felt li\e bucking,
Bill would belt him with his hat,
And Digger barked “You naughty Phil,
How do you dare do that?”
SO PHIL WOULD STOP AND BILL WOULD PUT
HIS HAT BACK ON HIS HEAD;
AND DIGGER GOT AN EXTRA BONE
TO TAKE WITH HIM TO BED.
And then the next time they went out,
Why, Phil would buck again.
And Bill would flap him with his hat
And jiggle with the rein.
1 do believe that if the truth
Of it were really kpiown,
That Phil just fixed the whole thing up
To get his mate a bone.


I HAVE A PONY,
ALL OF MY OWN;
BUT MOTHER WON’T LET ME
GO RIDING ALONE.
She says, when I’m seven
I can ride what I like:
A tractor, a car,
Or a new motor-bike.
I WISH I WAS SEVEN.
I ’spects I can fly in a ’plane
When I’m ’leven.


THE BLUE-TONGUE
LITTLE LIZ. WITH TONGUE OF BLUE,
I DON’T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD DO
IF THE CHILDREN HADN’T YOU
TO PLAY WITH THE WARM DAY THROUGH.
Perched upon a withered twig,
Like a little thingamy) ig,
At the flies your tongue you dig;
Dewdrops are your only swig.
Should a foe your peace assail,
Off you shake your dinky tail;
Not a single sob or wail—
Once wholesale,
but now retail.


AT THE EASTER SHOW
WHEN I WENT TO THE SHOW
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,
I saw the horses,
sheep and pigs,
The What’s-its-names
And Thing-me-jigs,
Machines that fly,
Machines that dig,
The Slippery Dips,
The Merry-go-rounds,
The Sample Bags,
The fluttery flags—
All going up and down
And round and round.
You know;
My word, I had a bosker
time
When I went to
THE SHOW.


JIMMY AND ME
HAVE JUST HAD A HOLIDAY DOWN BY THE SEA,
AND WE’RE BOTH AS BROWN AS SURFERS SHOULD BE.
All day long we lay in the sun,
With nothing at all but our
bathers on.
We both got burned, and wasn’t
it sore!
They rubbed us with oil, and we
burned some more.
We learned the shoots and to fish for
sharks;
We builded castles and had such larks.
This is me in the Panama hat.
And Jimmy’s
the one who
is lying down
flat.

THIS IS THE LITTLE RED-FOX
THE LITTLE RED-FOX from England came;
Two twinking eyes and a long, sharp nose.
He sleeps all day in his secret den;
As the sun goes down, for a stroll he goes.
After the rabbits he sometimes runs;
But lambs and hens he is fond of, too.
And cruel men chase him with dogs and guns;
So what is a little red-fox to do?
His skin is made into nice fur stoles;
In summer, with moth-balls, shut in a box.
The birds of the air have nests; but holes
In the ground are the home of the
LITTLE
RED-
FOX.

THE
LAUGHING
JACKASS
KNOWS THE WAY
WITH LOUD GUFFAWS
TO START THE DAY.
The first one up shouts out “Hello!
Ha haha ha, ho oh-ho ho!”
And then the mob yells altogether
“My word! but this is funny weather!”
The outback settler needs no clock
To tell him when the day begins.
The Jackass saves him that expense
i&. When at the rising sun he grins.
The Mopoke mopes about
to-morrow;
But not the merry
KOOKABURRA.


THE RABBIT
We know the rabbit
is a pest;
But stewed in milk I
like him best.
And he is good to broil
or bake,
And from his skin
fur-coats we make.
How sportively he hops
around!
How deep he burrows under-
ground !
In trapping him cruel men
engage,
And earn a very decent wage.
I think they only speak in jest
V Who say the rabbit
is a pest.

Jim Bong is a King.
He has a nice camp
Where the billabong bends.
He is awfully old
And has plenty of friends.

THE CLEVER RABBIT
There was a little Rabbit who
was lying in his burrow . . .
When the Dingo rang him up
to say he’d call on him
to-morrow . . .
But the Rabbit thought it
better that the Dingo did
not meet him;
So he found another burrow
and the Dingo didn’t eat
him.
And if the hungry Dingo
howls
That he has had no food,
The Rabbit smiles and goes (
to sleep,
As all good Rabbits should.


SO THAT IS THAT
All the girls at NARRABRI
Have nice red hair.
All the boys at BOGGABRI
Have nice brown suits—
And new tan boots.
When they go out walking,
You can hear them talking
Of nice brown suits,
And nice red hair,
And new tan boots.
When the boys of BOGGABRI
Have worn out their suits,
And there are holes in both the
soles
Of all their new tan boots,
The little girls of NARRABRI
Will laugh and never care,
Because for years and years and

They’ll still have red hair.

I couldn’t sleep, wonderin’, won-
derin’
If ever it rained like this before;
And then—it kept rainin’ and
rainin’ some more.
The creeks are all bankers.
The dams are all full;
We’ll get a big price
For our next clip of wool.
The paddock three weeks ago
Father was sowin’.
He says by to-morrow
The shoot will be showin’.
The cows will be milkin’.
The pigs will be fat,
And no one needs anything
More than that.
Loo\ at the rain!
The lovely rain — fj)
And Father’s hat Ajjl
Up in the air again!
