REVIEW OF THE PROGRESS OF NEW SOUTH
WALES DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS.
THE following paper, which was read before the Royal Society
by Mr. Christopher Rolleston, Auditor-General of New South
Wales, will be interesting to all colonial politicians as showing the
initial growth of states which may one day bud into empires The
publication of the Statistics of New South Wales for the year 1871?
lately laid before Parliament?offers an interesting subject of inquiry
with regard to the progress and resources of the colony. The report
of the Registrar-General, which accompanies the volume, conveys a
very clear and well-arranged analysis of the tables as they relate to the
year under review, but, very naturally, extends no further. I propose,
therefore, to embrace in this review a wider range of observation, and to
take stock of the resources and progress of the country during the last ten
years?comparing the five years from 1862 to 1866 with the five years from
1867 to 1871. It is by comparison that we arrive at an accurate knowledge
of the rate of progress we have attained, and are able to discover where we
have receded?if at all?and where we have stood still, and where we have
advanced. The period is free from the embarrassment which met the
statistician in the earlier period of the colony?s history. 1 mean with re-
gard to the loss of territory through dismemberment. In 1851, Port
Philip was separated from us; and at the end of 1859 the Moreton Bay
districts were taken from us. In 1862 we had well-nigh recovered, and, in
some respects, more than recovered, the losses inflicted by the deprivation of
so large a slice of our territory as that which now forms the thriving colony
of Queensland. Indeed, it may at this time be said that the loss has by the
enterprise of the people and by the fillip given to the development of the
country, through its establishment under a separate Government, been convert-
ed into a clear gain, through the growth of a vigorous enterprising community
carrying on friendly and profitable relations with us. Statistical results
are valuable for the right comprehension of the principles which should
guide the proceedings of Government, and I am sure I need not at this time
and before this sociey, attempt to indicate the important bearing which sta-
tistical investigation has upon legislation. Empirical treatment of subjects
without knowledge derived from facts must be as dangerous in its effects
upon the body politic as upon the human frame, for it has no guide but
opinions, the truth or fallacy of which?be they rational or be they vision-
ary_is equally unsusceptible of proof from scientific data. Hypothesis and
conjecture may be necessary in the pursuit of any investigation, but it is by
the results of observations carefully recorded that Governments should be
A


guided in their endeavours to promote the welfare of the people whose in-
terests are confided to their care. I will, then, under the belief that these
premises will be freely admitted, proceed to point attention to the facts re-
corded in the volume before me ; and I am happy to bear testimony to the
care and industry manifested by the compiler, in the collection as well as in
the preparation of the figures set forth for our information. lam not going
to weary you with long columns of figures in pursuing the investigation of
the facts as I find them recorded; I purpose for perspicuity and simplicity?s
sake, to take the averages of the quinquennial periods, and to exhibit the
results with as much conciseness as is compatible with a clear elucidation
of the facts to which lam about to invite your attention. The subjects
will be treated under four principal heads, viz:?1, population; 2, pro-
duction ; 3, manufactures ; 4, trade and commerce; 5, accumulation.
1. Population. ?The number and increase of the people must always
be regarded as the most important element in the progress of a country.
Let us see then what information we can gather on this head. The census
taken on April 7,1861, resulted in a total population of 350,860 souls, of
which 55 per cent, were males, and 45 per cent, were females. The census
taken on April 2, 1871, resulted in a total population of 503,981 souls, com-
prising males and females in very nearly the same proportion as ten years
ago. The aggregate gain to the country was 153,121 souls, equal to 43
per cent, in the decennary. Of this number 108,972, or 31 per cent., was
the result of natural increase by the excess of births over deaths ; whilst
the balance, equal to 12 per cent., is due to the excess of immigration over
emigration. Teeming with mineral wealth beyond calculation, abounding
in the richest pasturage, and possessing a soil which, properly cultivated,
yields to the occupier no stinted return for the toil and labour he lias
bestowed upon it, we have much to do in the way of wooing a population
to assist in the development of the boundless resources of this young
country. When we consider the area comprised within its limits, and
know that for each man, woman, and child in it?were it parcelled out
amongst them?over 400 acres of land would fall to the lot of each ; and
when we reflect on this further fact, that without exceeding the density of
the population as it exists in the county of Cumberland?exclusive
of Sydney?we have room for a population exceeding twenty
millions of souls, or forty times the number of its present inhabi-
tants?we cannot but hail with pleasure the prospect which is
opening to us of a considerable accession to the population, not only by
reason of the attraction of our mineral wealth, but by means of an assisted
immigration, the funds for which have made their appearance on the
Estimates for 1873 for the first time for many years. The statistics of this
colony, as well as those of Victoria, amply prove the fact that wages have
declined with the stoppage of immigration, and have never ruled so high as
they have reached in those years when immigration was at its full swing.
Of all causes which create national wealth, the power of population is the
most influential; hence the interest which attaches to comprehensive and
systematic returns designed to illustrate the social progress of a nation,
amongst which a census of the people must ever be regarded as the truest
index to its wealth; and instead of the repulsive dryness which thoughtless
custom has ascribed to statistics of this nature, they ought to have all the
attractiveness of pictures of a people?s condition. For this reason the tables
that are now in process of compilation from the facts elicited at the late

census will, when published, be replete with interest, and form the basis for
administrative and economical measures of the highest consequence to the
well-being of the community. A good deal of impatience has manifested
itself at what appears to unreflecting persons the dilatoriness of the com-
pilers ; but anyone who has had experience of the labour involved in
reducing into shape and order the mass of information contained in the
returns, will readily acknowledge the truth of the old proverb??more
haste, worse speed,? and that it applies with peculiar force to the elaborate
details of a census.
2. Production. ?We must still under this head give precedence to our
pastoral industry, for the time has not yet arrived, although it may not be
far off - , when our mineral resources may take the first rank amongst the
producing interests of the country. The statistics show that we commenced
the decennial period with the following live-stock, namely ;
Horses. Cattle. Sheep.
273,389 2,620,383 6,145,651
and that we close the decennary with
304,100 2,014,888 16,278,697
that is to say, we have increased our horse-stock by over 30,000 ; we are
poorer in horned cattle by over 600,0000, and we have increased our
sheep by over 10,000,000. This is a striking result, and one which can
hardly have been anticipated, namely, that whilst we have increased our
flocks in the ten years 165 per cent., we have lost 23 per cent, of our
herds. Whether we owe this deficiency in our horned cattle to the ravages
of pleuro-pneumonia, or to the increased demand for beef by the meat-pre-
serving establishments, I know not?partly, perhaps, to both. The result,
from whatever cause it arises, ought to stimulate our cattle-breeders and
farmers to greater care and greater exertion, so as to keep pace
with the increasing requirements of the country. For every
100 of the population, we have 400 head of cattle and 3,200
sheep, or, in other words, 4 head of cattle and 32 sheep for
every man, woman, and child in the country. We need be under no appre-
hension of starving from lack of butchers? meat; whilst at the same time it
is not very clear, from the returns of the last ten years (unless we can greatly
extend our power of increase), where the great surplus of cattle is to come
from that is expected to feed the growing demand for our beef?whether
salted, tinned, or frozen?in the mother-country. The decrease in cattle
occurred most noticeably in the years 1863 and 1864, and it would seem that
the ill effects of the pleuro-pnemonia epidemic were felt up to the year 1869,
for it is not till that year the number of cattle in this colony shows an
upward tendency. Between 1862 and 1871?omitting the two years 1867
and 1868, in which no statistics of the ?overland? traffic were taken?the
exports and imports of cattle and sheep across the border to Victoria stood
Net exports in the eight years . 517,630 3,245,577
Wool. ?The tables which exhibit the export of wool?the produce of the
colony?furnish the following information :?They show us that in the year
a 2


1862 our flocks produced 20,988,393 lbs. of wool, of the estimated value of
1 801 186/., which gives an average of over three pounds six ounces per
sheep, and an estimated value of nearly one shilling and mnepence per
pound In 1866 the production had increased to 36,980,685 pounds of wool,
with an estimated value of 2,830,348/., or a little over one shilling and six-
pence per pound; thus exhibiting an increase in the production to the ex-
tent of 76 per cent. Whilst in the last five years of the series?that is in
the vear 1871?the exports reached the highest figures ever sent away,
namely, 65,611,953 pounds of wool, and the estimated value of 4,748,160/., or
a little over one shilling and fivepence per pound. Not far short of five
millions sterling, and equal to an increase of production of 212 per cent, in
the ten years, and nearly 80 per cent in the last five years. The clip of
1871 gave an average yield of 4 lbs. per sheep, that is ten ounces over the
clip of 1862, owing probably in great measure to the larger proportion of
wool going home in grease. We have no means of ascertaining the actual
return proceeds of the clip of last year, indeed, it cannot yet have
been all realised. I shall not be accused of overstating the case, however,
if I put down the surplus return to the colony, over and above the value
beforestated, at a million and a half sterling, thus bringing up the value of the
clip to six millions and a quarter sterling. It is a noticeable feature m the
returns of the exports of wool, the produce of our own flocks, that over 41
per cent, goes to Melbourne or Adelaide for shipment, a fact which suggests
considerations beyond the scope of this paper to discuss.
Tallow, &c.? As appertaining to the pastoral interests the sketch would
be incomplete without a notice of the value of live-stock, tallow, hides,
sheepskins, and tinned meats, but I will treat them in the aggregate for
fear of wearying you, having much ground yet to go over. Of course we
have no means of ascertaining the value of the home consumption, we must
therefore be content to estimate the production by the value of the exports
as expressed in the returns before us. I find, then, that we exported sea-
ward last year, the produce of our own flocks and herds, to the value of
Live-stock
Salt and preserved meats os*
Hides and skins ?
Tallow 245 � 727
Total �468,606
Thus bringing up the value of our pastoral produce to a sum approaching
seven millions sterling. Comparing this result with a similar investigation
presented by me to the Philosophical Society just six years ago, it would
appear that, altogether, irrespective of the late rise iathevalue of wool,
the income from our pastoral industry has very nearly doubled itself m the
last six years-the pastoral exports in 1865 being then estimated at not
more than 3,298,402/. But these figures, I see, include the value of the
live-stock, wool, and tallow, exported ? overland.? I must, therefore, to
make the comparison complete, look up the value of the pastoral produce so
exported last year. I find it is as follows, viz.:

Agriculture.? ln order to illustrate more clearly the progress we have
made in this important branch of industry, it will be advisable to divide the
decennary into two equal periods, and average the results of each. We
shall thus arrive at a more accurate knowledge of the progress we have
made than if we were to take the results of single years. The comparison
then comes out as follows, viz :-Average five years, 1863 to 1866: wheat,
124,666 acres; maize, 101,225 acres ; other crops, 125,614 acres ; total,
351,505 acres. Average five years, 1868 to 1872 : wheat, 160,965 acresi;
maize, 118,301 acres; other crops, 155,738 acres; total, 435,004 acres. We
find, then, from these figures, 1, that the average acreage under wheat has
increased by 36,299 acres, nearly 30 per cent.; 2, that the average acreage
under maize has increased by 17,076 acres, or nearly 17 per cent.; o, that
the average acreage under ? all other crops,?t has increased by 30,124 acres,
or 24 per cent.; 4, and that the total acreage under cultivation has in-
creased in the last five years by 83,499 acres, equal to 24 per cent. lam
not quite sure whether this rate of progress will satisfy the ardent aspirations
of those who looked by means of a liberal land policy to attract industry to
the soil; but I cannot think they ought to be discouraged in the face o t the
results elicited by the late census, and just brought under your notice,
namely, that the total increase of the population in the ten years has been
only 43 per cent. But I will follow up this inquiry a little further with the
view of showing that exclusive of the pastoral tenants, the number of occu-
piers of land has increased from 19,361 in 1864 (the first year in which the
statistics were collected) to 29,174 in 1872-rather over 50 per cent. Com-
paring this with the rate of increase of the population, it must be admitted
that the occupation of the land has commanded a fair share of attention. But
before I leave the subject of agriculture for other industries waiting our atten-
tion, I must proceed to notice shortly the results of the wheat tillage. Pursuing
the comparison in the same way that I have treated the extent of land under
crop, I find that the average yield of the quinquennial period was 1,2< 0,0
bushels, or barely ten bushels to the acre, at Bs. per bushel in Sydney (which
the statistics tell us was the average price during that period) we obtain a
result of 508,017/., or at the rate of 4/. per acre. The average of the second
quinquennial period produced 1,930,217 bushels, or 12 bushels per acre,
which at 6s. per bushel-a little over the average price as given in the
tables?will yield a gross return of 579,065/., or at the rate of 3/. 12s. per
acre. lam not prepared to say whether this rate of remuneration com-
pensates the farmer for his outlay, toil, and trouble in New South Wales,
but we know that the farmers of South Australia are perfectly content to
sell their wheat on the ground at 3s. 6 d. per bushel, and that the average
yield per acre does not exceed our own ; and moreover, that wheat and flour
constitute one of their principal articles of export, whilst with us the

average produce is barely sufficient for the supply of one-half the population
--the average of the first five years being about 3* bushels per head, and
the average of the last five years being about 4 bushels per head. The
average allowance per head of the population, including wheat for seed, is
estimated at bushels. The value of the imports of wheat and flour, de-
ducting exports, has averaged no less than 472,560/. Whilst of grain of all
kinds used for food, wheat and flour inclusive, the balance of imports over
exports has exceeded half a million sterling per annum (538,005/.) during
the ten years under review. Amongst the exports of grain last year it is
satisfactory to notice 741,567 bushels of maize valued at 109,412/., being at
the rate of a trifle under 3s. per bushel. This is one of the most certain
and prolific crops we have?maintaining a steady average yield of 30
bushels per acre, and its value will be the more appreciated when I tell you
that irrespective of home consumption we have exported, on the average,
annually 783,617 bushels of the aggregate value of 1,175,426/., or at the rate
of 117,542/. per annum.*
Sugar. On March 31, 1864, the statistics for the first time afford evi-
dence of the aptitude of parts of this colony for the growth of the sugar-
cane. We find in that year the modest attempt of two acres, with a produce
alongside it of 280 pounds of sugar. From this small beginning we trace a
rapid increase, which at the beginning of this year had attained dimensions
of considerable importance, for we find that no less than 4,593 acres were
under cultivation, of which 1,994 acres were productive, and yielded 1,241
tons of sugar, exclusive of the produce of 748 acres in the Clarence district,
which at the time of taking the returns could not be ascertained, but which,
if we estimated it at the average of the remainder, will bring up the yield
to as near as possible a ton to the acre. The establishment of this industry
is perhaps one of the most important features in the history of the period
we are recording, and I am afraid that the returns of last year do not do it
justice, for I find on looking up the figures again that the yield of sugar in
1869 and 1870, with a much smaller extent of land under crop, was 3,048
tons against 2,667 f tons in the two succeeding years. In the four years
1869 to 1872 the value of the sugar produced has exceeded 150,000/.
Wine.? The notice of our agricultural produce would not be complete if
I omitted to draw attention to the increase of the vine culture. There is no
industry in which we have made greater advance, whether we regard it in
quantity or quality. From 1,459 acres under crop in 1863, we have advanced
to 4,152 acres in 1872, or 185 per cent, in the ten years. And in the pro-
duction of wine the returns show an increase from 144,888 gallons in 1863,
to 413,321 gallons in 18< 2, exhibiting an equal rate of production with the
acreage in crop. What value this produce may represent I know not. The
restrictive fiscal policy of our neighbours has hitherto prevented its attain-
ing any commercial value, for I can find no notice of it in the Decennial
Tables of exports, and in the Customs returns for 1871, only a few samples
amounting to 1,679 gallons in all were exported, to which no specific value
is attached, lhat the time, however, will come when the mother-country
will as readily avail herself of our wines as she is anxious to take

our meat no one will, I think, be prepared to dispute. But I must pass on
to the next subject, only stopping to make the remark that it is impossible
to reduce the produce of our husbandry, as we can our wool and gold, to
any arithmetical nicety of calculation as to value. It may make no great
show in the list of our exports, but it gives occupation and support to
nearly 5,000 of our people; and, although I have given agriculture the
second place in this paper, I would not be so rash as to place the husband-
man in the second rank amongst the wealth-makers of the colon}'. Heavy
losses and sore discouragements are his lot. Alternations of drought, of
frost, of rust and blight, of grub and caterpillar, are amongst the difficulties
he has to contend with, and in a degree that is felt by no other producing
?class amongst us.
Gold. ?The statistics of our gold-mines for the ten years ending Decem-
ber 31, 1871, exhibit for the first nine years of the series a gradual diminu-
tion in production. Commencing with a value of 2,212,5347. in 1802, the
production declined, till it reached in 1870 the lowest point recorded since
the first discovery of gold in 1851, namely, 763,055/. In the year 1871,
however, there are indications of a recovery, which during the present year
have more than realised the most sanguine expectations ot the mining
population. The production last year mounted again to 1,143,/81/., making
up the total value produced in the decennary to 11,591,742/. the first five
years averaging 1,411,780/., the second five years averaging only 900,561/.
The industry during the first five years gave employment to about 20,000
of our people, and during the second five years to about 15,000 on the ave-
rage. The value of the gold produced in the colony and exported fiom 1851
to�lB6l inclusive was 13,596,680/. To what proportions the energy and
the enterprise that are now being directed to the development of this branch
of industry may cause the production to attain, is a question beyond the
power of human foresight to conjecture. I must leave it to others to discuss
this problem, and pass on to the consideration of a branch of industry more
certain in its results, viz.:?
Coal. ?We are here without a rival, and may calculate with certainty
on a production, limited only by the demand, for ages to come. Whilst
gold confounds all the theories of geologists and defies their conclusions
the existence and extent of our coal formations is a matter of as much cer-
tainty to the experienced eye of the geologist as if it lay on the surface.
And now that the miners and their masters seem to have arrived at a better
understanding, and to perceive that it is to the interest of both to work in
harmony, we may confidently hope that the production may attain propor-
tions which will place this industry in the first rank amongst the products
of the country. In spite of the many drawbacks which have attended the
pursuit, it is satisfactory to notice that whilst the average produce of the
five years, 1802 to 1866, was 503,835 tons of coal annually, and an
average value of 281,998/., or equal to not far short of a million
and a half, on the whole, the produce of the five years, 1807
1871, reached a yearly average of 882,272 tons, of the value of 34<,957/.,
or nearly a million and three-quarters on the whole. The value of
the coal in the first period is estimated at 10s. per ton, and in the
second period at barely Bs. per ton. Had the value remained the same, the
produce of the latter quinquennial period would have realised 2,205,681/.,
or nearly three-quarters of a million in excess of the earlier period. Ihe

great results in the future, have not yet attained a development that swells
up to any material extent the resources of the colony. I find that the ex-
tent of the production in 1871 was?
3. Manufactures. ?Under this branch of industry, we have no great
progress to boast of. The most noticeable feature in the returns is the
establishment within the last two years of fifty-seven mills for the manu-
facture of sugar from the cane, grown on the northern rivers. In the
manufacture of woollen cloth, there has been an increase of five to seven
establishments only in the ten years, turning out on the average for the
last five years, 218,276 yards of cloth per annum, against 120,719 yards the
previous five years. In tobacco, soap and candles, tallow and lard, refined
sugar, and distilled spirits?which constitute the only remaining speci-
mens of manufacturing industry exhibited in the tables?there is nothing to
notice that would justify my detaining you, I shall therefore pass on to the
consideration of the statistics of our
4. Trade and Commerce. ?ln attempting to illustrate the growth of
our commerce it will be well to examine the returns of imports and exports
? seaward ? in the first place, leaving what is called the ? overland ? trade for
after consideration. Following this plan, I find that in the ten years 1861
to 1871 inclusive, we imported seaward goods to the value of 84,832,3637, and
we exported goods to the value of 74,148,8767.; that is equal to a yearly
average of imports to the value of nearly eight millions and a half sterling,
and of exports nearly seven millions and a half; or putting it in another
shape, at the rate of?for imports 197.175., and for exports 177. 7s. per head
of the average population. The value of the imports into Great Britain during
the same period was at the rate of 97. 55., and of exports at the rate of 57.
16s. per head of the population. I have looked through the statistics of the
Board of Trade for the last ten years, and I cannot find amongst all the
dependencies of the British Crown?British India excepted?any trade that
approaches in value to that of ? Australia.? The colonies are not separately
specified in the returns, but as it may be interesting to show what rank the
Australian colonies take amongst ? the British Possessions ? in their trade
with the mother-country, I will takeleave to quote the following figures from
the Statistical Abstract for 1871.*
* The total value of ? imports ? from British Possessions in the year 1871
is set down at 73,267,1567., but the value of the exports had not been ascer-

The imports from Australia were 22 per cent, of the whole, and the
exports of Australia were 10 per cent, of the whole. You will, perhaps,
excuse this digression. It occurred to me that the information might be
interesting to many who have never realised the important commercial
position Her Majesty?s Australian possessions occupy?second only to
British India with its teeming millions of inhabitants ?and far in advance
of the North American Colonies with a population three times that of the
Australias. But to return to our own statistics, it should be notified that
our trade with Great Britain constitutes no preponderating share of the
whole, for I find that in the ten years we imported from Great Britain to
the value of 32,575,549/.; Australian and other colonies, 37,926,609/.;
foreign countries, 14,330,145/.; that is to say, from Great Britain, 40 per
cent.; other colonies, 42 per cent.; foreign countries 17 per cent. ; as also
in exports during the same period, we exported to Great Britain to the
value of 30,208,485/.; Australian and other colonies, 41,467,718/.; and
foreign countries, 2,472,673/., that is to say, at the rate of 41 per cent., 56
per cent., and 3 per cent, respectively. The importance of our intercolonia
trade is here very remarkably exemplified, for we see by these figures that
as regards ?imports? it constitutes nearly one half, and as regards
? exports ? more than one half of the entire commerce of the country. It
may be interesting here to notice the extent to which the export trade is
indebted to the produce and manufactures of the country, because the
prosperity of the colony may be judged by the productions over and
above its own wants of articles, the result of its own people?s industry.
Well, in this point of view, we may derive satisfaction from the returns ;
for I find that of the exports valued at 74,148,876/., for the ten years, no
less than 52,043,742/. represent the produce and manufactures of New
South Wales, exhibiting an annual average of over five millions sterling, and
at the rate of 12/. 3s. 6c/. per head of the population. It has already been
shown that the exports of Great Britain for the same period were at the
rate of 5/. 16s. per head of the population. Relatively, therefore, the
wealth of this community has been increasing in a ratio more than double


that of the mother-country. There may, perhaps, be two reasons assigned
lor this; the one refers to the great natural resources of the country
which yield their riches with comparatively small assistance from man!
The other refers to what I conceive to be the more effective condition of
population. If the productive class bears a larger proportion to the un-
productive in one country than in another, the power of creating wealth
will be by so much increased. I have reason to believe that when the
'?census? of Great Britain in 1871 is compared with that of New South
Wales, it will be found that the population, ineffective by reason of age,
bears a higher ratio to the aggregate numbers in Great Britain than it
does in New South Wales. I have not the statistics before me to
enable me to verify this opinion at the present time, but I remember
making a comparison (in preparing my report on the census of
1856) and I there found, that by the census of 1851, the popula-
tion of Great Britain between the ages of ten and seventy ex-
treme limits - showed no less than 57 per cent, outside those
limits. That is to say, that 57 per cent, were dependent for food, edu-
cation, and support, upon the remaining 43 per cent.; whilst, in New
South Wales, between the ages of 10 and 60,* there were 69 per cent,
effective to 31 per cent, ineffective. By the census of 1856, I find that,
taking the boys and girls under 14 years, and the people above 60 years,
the proportions were :-Between 14 and 60, 59-67 per cent., leaving 40-33
per cent, unproductive = 100. The late census, I believe, exhibits a pro-
portion of 58 per cent, between the ages of 14 and 65, which perhaps fairly
represents the present working population, leaving 42 per cent, unpro-
ductive. I merely, in passing, throw out these suggestions for your
consideration as they occur to me, in some measure to account for the
larger producing power of the Australian colonies as compared with Eng-
land. We will now proceed to analyse a little more closely the Customs
returns, and compare the two quinquennial periods embraced in the de-
cennary under review. And first as to ? Imports.? It appears that
between 1862 and 1866, we imported articles to the value of 46,285 929/
yielding an annual average of 9,257,185/.; whilst between 1867 and
18/1 we imported to the value of only 38,546,434/., yielding an annual
average of 7,709,286/., showing a decrease of over a million and a half
yearly, and it appears that this decrease was not in the intercolonial trade, but
in the trade with the mother-country, for whilst the colonial trade sustains
a slightly increased average?that is from 3,777,341/. to 3,806,792/., the
average imports from Great Britain fell from 4,182,809/. to 2,972,300/.. or a
decrease of 29 per cent. We may, I think, trace here the effect of the low
value at home of our staple product, wool, and perhaps to some extent, the
languishing state of the gold-mining interest during the latter period. And
may we not also attribute the decrease to a forced economy in the use of
luxuries, which comparatively straitened circumstances taught us to ob-
serve. Let us now see how the mater stands as to ? Exports;? the total value
? flVe yearS WaS 38 > 860 > equal to an annual average of
/,//2,000/. ; and for the second five years 35,288,874/., or an average of
/,057,775/., an annual decrease of not much short of three-quarters of a
million ? Now here the picture is reversed, the decrease is not in the ex-
ports to Great Britain, but in the Colonial trade, for whilst the annual
average to Great Britain increased from 2,694,495/. in the first period to
* The classification did not distinguish the ages over 60.


3,347,201/., or 24 per cent, in the second period, the value of the intercolonial
exports decreased from an average of 4,860,1991, to 3,433,344/., or 30 per
cent. This falling off is apparent in the figures -which represent the value
of the exports to each of the Australian colonies, but appears more particu-
larly manifest in the trade with Queensland, which dropped from the
annual average of 1,173,558/. during the first five years, to 798,668/., or 32
per cent, during the last. And this is a very natural result,
not only of the increased facilities for direct trade with the mother-
country, but also perhaps of her people having freed themselves
from the galling yoke of their former pecuniary dependence ;upon
the mercantile and banking institutions of the parent colony.
There is still the overland traffic with the adjoining colonies to be noticed.
I do not intend to enter into an elaborate analysis of the figures presented
under this head. The time at my disposal will not admit of it, and Ido
not wish to- trespass on your attention at greater length than I can help.
I will take the statistics of two years only, namely, 1861 and 1871, and com-
pare them, that you may see the vast increase of the overland trade in the
ten years. I find that the value of the imports across the Border and up
the Darling, in 1861, was under 200,000/., and the exports under 900,000/.,
whilst in 1871 we imported from
Victoria, to the value of
South Australia, to the value of 135,0J8
Total . ... �626,730
And we exported to
Victoria, to the value of ~^)o^7,/ 14
South Australia, to the value of 424,/32
Total �3,452,446
that is, an import and export trade exceeding 4,000,000/. sterling in value !
Now, if this trade is added to the imports and exports seaward in 1871, we
arrive at the following results, namely :
Seaward** ?? �8,981,219
Overland from Victoria and South Australia . . 626,/30

These figures exhibit an import trade at the rate of 19/. Is. 3d., and an
export trade at the rate of 22/. 6s. 2d, per head of the population?that is,
mote than double the import trade, and nearer treble the export trade of
Great Britain per head of the population, according to the values respec-
tively given in the Customs returns of the two countries. Before passing
on to the last subject of our inquiry, I should like to draw a comparison
between the decade we have been reviewing and that which preceded it, for
they must present to the minds of colonists of a quarter of a century s
standing features differing very widely in their outlines. In the earlier


decade we embrace that period of intense excitement, great speculation,
and remarkable development which followed the discovery of gold. In the
second decade we trace in the first half of it symptoms of depression natu-
rally following a period of over-trading and general extravagance in which
confidence in the permanant stability and elasticity of our resources was
well-nigh destroyed. In the second half of the latter decade we may dis-
cover clear evidence of recovery through the exercise of vigilant economy,
as exemplified in reduced imports, and through the vigorous efforts made by
the producing interests to lessen the cost, to improve the quality, and to
increase the quantity of our marketable productions, as in the face of
almost overwhelming discouragement, is exemplified in the increased ex-
ports to the mother-country. Depression follows excitement as naturally
in the body social as in the body physical, and it is somewhat remarkable
that they seem to occupy pretty equal periods in the history of this
country. Let us inquire then how the matter stands between the decade of
? excitement,? and the decade of ?depression.? The decade of ?excite-
ment ? shows an aggregate import trade to the value of. . �57,650,053
And the aggregate export trade of 43,125,653
Together �100,775,706
The decade of ? depression ? shows an aggregate import trade
of the value of �84,832,363
And an aggregate export trade of 74,148,876
Together �158,981,239
And this is without taking into account the ? overland ? traffic, which,
we have seen, exceeded last year four millions sterling. I was hardly pre-
pared to expect that the investigation would bring out such a result as an
excess of over fifty-eight millions sterling as compared with the great gold-
producing era. The increase in the producing power of population is here
remarkably brought out; for whilst the actual increase of population was
only 43 per cent., the increase of trade and production was nearly 58 per
cent. Surely, then, such facts as these ought for ever to dispel the silly
fears which have led to such disastrous results in the cases of many of our
most valuable colonists, whose interests have been sacrificed to ignorance
or timidity; and they ought to establish a well-founded and enduring con-
fidence both here and at home in the strength and elasticity of our re-
sources, and in the power of production of our people.
s.? Accumulation. ?The coin and bullion in the Sydney branch of the
Royal Mint, in the Colonial Treasury, and in the banks of the colony, on
December 31,1871, amounted to 2,522,387, being an increase of 74 per cent,
on the amount on the same day of the previous year. A comparison be-
tween the first and second five years of the decade shows an average of
1,278,151/. for the first period, 1,904,855/. for the second, i.e., an increase of
nearly 50 per cent. But it is to the amount on deposit in the several bank-
ing institutions that we must look for evidence of the accumulated wealth of
the people. I find, then, that at the end of 1871, the sworn returns of the
banks showed that they held?

' This was at the rate of 15/. 17s. Id. per head of the population. And it
seems to have been in excess of the deposits at the end of the previous year
by nearly a million sterling. Dividing the decennary into two equal parts,
it will be found that the average annual deposits in the banks during
earlier five years were 5,713,974/., and in the later five years 6 ? 400 ? 091/ -?
showing an increase of between 13 and 14 per cent. The discounts at the
several banks on December 31 last represented an aggregate value of
7,668,022/.; and if we add to this the mortgages on land and on live-stock
and liens oo crops, we shall arrive approximately at
producing interests at the end of last year. We will tabulate them as

1841 she had increased her population to 149,6(19 souls, her revenue to
493,980/., and her trade to 3,551,385/. In 1851, after the dismemberment of
the Southern districts, she had increased her population to 197,168; but her
revenue and her trade suffered by the loss. Her revenue was 406,056/., and
her trade 3,360,843/. In the next decade after the dismemberment of her
northern territory she increased her population to 358,278 souls, her
revenue to 1,448,610/., and her trade to 11,986.394/., whilst in 1871 she
had increased her population to 519,182 souls, her revenue to 2,727,404, and
her trade to 20,854,540/. The wealth-producing power of population is, I
think, fully exemplified in these figures; for we shall see that, excepting the
one period marked by the dismemberment of Port Philip, as the population
increased so did the power of production, and in an increased ratio.
The import and export trade per head of the population was as follows,
viz.:?
We appear now to be on the threshhold of another epoch of excitement,
and prosperity, and whoever may live to see the decade out may have a
marvellous story to tell of the country?s progress far outstripping that which
I have been able to show you to-night; and if, deriving wisdom from the
experience of the past, we direct our energies aright, and endeavour to edu-
cate our youthful population up to the high standard to which they should
aspire, we may hope that, with the increase of the wealth, we may at the
same time be promoting the happiness of the people, so that in the course of
time we may raise the national character to the standard we should try to
attain?that of a wise and an understanding people.
A few remarks may be added to Mr, Rolleston?s paper carrying forward
events so as to include the first eleven months of the past year. In the
Sydney Morning Herald of December 30, 1872, we find the following
observations in the money article ? A retrospective glance over the year
now about to close presents many features of importance to all who are
interested in the colony of New South Wales. From a strictly commercial
point of view it has been a steady year, unmarked either by those specu-
lative operations?which if they sometimes result in large profits, almost as
often result disastrously?or by any disturbances of trade tending to weaken
the credit of our traders. To the wool-producing and squatting interest
generally, 1872 has been a period of uninterrupted prosperity. Their live-
stock never commanded such prices nor their wool a higher value. If we
turn to the miners we find that the development of our mineral resources
has not in previous years received so much assistance from capitalists.
Neither has the value of our auriferous deposits been so fully demonstrated.
To the mere capitalist,whose highest idea of money is how he can safely lock it up
at a fixed rate of interest, the prospect has not been quite so pleasing. Gold has
been too plentiful, and our monetary institutions, burdened with an unusually
large amount of unproductive capital, have had to compete with their customers
in obtaining reproductive investments. We have seen money cheaper in
Sydney than in the great financial circle of the world, and our Government


enabled to place a public loan here at a higher price than our debentures
would have realised in London. To the political financier the year has
been in other respects one of unexampled prosperity. Never before was
there so much revenue collected in twelve months, and rarely, if ever, has
our Colonial Treasurer been enabled to boast of such a surplus. Unless
something unprecedented occurs, the changes which took place during this
year must result in permanent good to the colony. The fame of our
Hawkins Hill mines alone must attract immigrants from the old world to
establish new homes where their labour will be more remunerative.
Hundreds of miles of tin-bearing country on our northern frontier which
will not pay expensively-managed public companies, will enable hard-
working miners to make excellent wages; and if we turn to our carboni-
ferous deposits we have a source of wealth second to no country in the
world. California has already acknowledged that this is the best source of
supply for her coal market. China and the East are steadily enlarging
their transactions with our collieries, and if such a mode of conveyance as
steam colliers was available, a vast trade might be done in one of our prin-
cipal products.?
In another portion of the same journal the following remarks occur:?
? In our usual monthly table showing the yield of our gold-fields for October
we stated that it was not improbable that the yield of the Western mines
alone, during the month just closed, would equal the whole of the escort
receipts during November 1871. The Mint returns show that our antici-
pations fall far short of the actual result. The receipts from the Western
districts have been 56,723 oz, against 29,077 oz. received from all our mines
during the corresponding portion of last year. Last month?s aggregate
yield was 65,369 oz,, towards which the Southern districts contributed
7,702 oz. and the Northern 944 oz. We believe that these figures, large as
they appear, fall considerably short of the actual yield, inasmuch as we
know that considerable quantities of the precious metal reach Sydney by
private hands, and therefore do not form any portion of the statistics kept
by the Mint authorities.?

Zealand and Tasmania, keep their places in the race of prosperity. The
great cry from each and all is, for labourers from Great Britain, if they
will only come; but if not, inferior labourers will have to be resorted
to from China, Polynesia and elsewhere; for the greatest want in
Australia and New Zealand at the present moment is willing labourers to
still further develop their natural and mechanical resources.
