N early, very nearly, 1900 years have gone into the dim past
since these words were first uttered ; yet to-day they are
as important in their spirited sense as they were then
and have ever been. They are also very important in
their bodily application, for if ye be not properly clothed
ye cannot meet your enemy in the gate. The way to be
properly clothed, as becomes a reputable citizen of this
great city, is to pick your tailor with discretion ; and if
you elect to patronise

A man in Parramatta was present at the
funeral of a neighbour, of whom no good could
honestly be said. But everybody was saying
something, and this man, not wishing to appear
singular, but being incapable of lying, remarked
that it was “ a nice, quiet corpse.” He then
turned to a friend- and confided in him that the
only medicine he ever kept in the house was
Watson’s Worm Nttxs, which never failed yet.

Douglas Jerrold, the famous wit, once remarked-!
“ Tickle the Earth with a hoe, and she laughs with the Harvest.”
Many years have elapsed since this quaint remarjk was made, but it is tolerably certain
that
The Farmers’ & Dairymen's Milk Co., Ltd,
HARRIS & THOMAS STREETS, ULTIMO,
can lay claim to the fact that children who drink their PURE FRESH MILK laugh and
grow fat. The most important fact of all is, that the prestige gained by the Company for
fair and legitimate trade has been the means of garnering in a harvest of first-class con-
sumers throughout this city and suburbs, that an y Company might well be proud of.

FOR PALE PEOPLE.
Marvellous iEecovery of a New Zealand Girl.
“lam 19 years of age,’’writes Miss
Petrea Peterson, of Featherston,
North Island,N.Z.,“ and ever since
I was 15 I have been suffering more
or less.” Palpitation of the heart
washerprincipal trouble,she states,
and this was induced by anaemia,
or poorness of the blood. “When,
for instance,” she continues/ 4 1 ran
up-stairs my heart used to thump
most frightfully against my sides
and so bad was it that on these
occasions I was unable to talk for
some time afterwards. This was
naturally a source of considerable
anxiety to my family and friends.
Night after night I tossed, weary
and worn-out, on my bed, trying
vainly to sleep. At times, too, I had fearful attacks of cramp in my legs,
and so great was the agony that frequently it caused me to scream out in very
desperation, to the despair of those around. I was always in a weak, low
state, and, of course, never felt fit for my work. My legs, too, would at times
swell up to a considerable extent, and this naturally occasioned myself and my
mother great suspense. Thus, as I grew older I became worse and worse, being
subject also to periods of giddiness which many a time caused me to almost
fall down. I tried plenty of medicines and I had several doctors, one after the
other, but they gave me no relief. I also consulted three doctors regarding
an affliction of the eye from which I suffered. In June, 1897,1 commenced
taking your pills. After the third dose I found a change for the better. I
continued with them until I, bit by bit, improved so much that four months
ago I left them off altogether. I have taken a total of nine boxes, and am
now in the most perfect of condition. Insomnia, weakness, giddiness, heart
palpitation, cramps, and swellings in the legs have all disappeared, and the
affection in my eye has likewise ceased. My mother thinks the world of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and she has tried several boxes herself.
I am awfully thankful to them, and I have recommended them to all my
friends. Four of them cannot praise them too highly T shall always
recommend them.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are blood builder and
a nerve restorer, curing such diseases as rheumatism, neuralgia, partial
paralysis, locomotor ataxia, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous headache, general
debility, nervous prostration, the after effects of la grippe, influenza, dengue
and typhoid fevers, and severe colds, diseases depending on humors of the
blood, such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, etc. Pink Pills give a healthy
glow to pale and sallow complexions, and are a specific for all troubles
peculiar to the female system, such as anasmia, poor and watery blood, female
irregularities, etc. In the case of men, they effect a radical cure in all cases
arising from mental worry, over-work, or excesses of any nature.
Experiencing any difficulty in obtaining the genuine Dr. Williams’, send
direct to the Dr. Williams Medicine Company, Sydney, who will forward
(post paid, on receipt of stamps or post order) one box for 2s. 9d., or half-a-
dozen for 15s. 3d.

Du Maurier was a thorough worship per
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also s how
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Mama (after she had punished Tommy)
—“ Stop making such dreadful faces.”
Tommy (bursting into tears) —“ I ain’t.
I’m trying to keep a stiff upper lip.”
Her Mother—“ Edith, don’t you think
you are getting too old to play with little
boys ? ” Edith (aged seven) —“ No,
mamma; the older I get the better I like
them.”
“ Do you hear that whining in the next
room ? ” “ Yes ; who is it ? ” “ That’s
the football rusher who got off those
manly utterances at the end of the game ;
his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast

the bottom!” Mrs. O’Doolan —Why, ye
auld phule, ye’ve buttoped it up wrong.
It’s a strait weskit would suit ye ! ”
Family friend: “ I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the piarriage of your
daughter. I see you are gradually getting
all the girls off your hands.” Old Olive-
branch : “ Off my hands —yes ; but the
worst of it is, I have to keep all their
husbands on their feet.’ :
Boy or Girl ? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“ How strange !
Elfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. But she states it’s already

A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
he asked the clerk; “Was my discourse
too long ? ” “No ; but it was long
enough.” “I am glad of that; for to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, my dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”
said the clerk, “ could you let our vicar

November 12th, 1897.'
To the Bile Bean Manufacturing Co,
Dear Sirs, —I have been for some years subject to Biliousness arid
Headache, and,, seeing Bile Beans were so extensively advertised, 1 X.
decided to give them a trial, and accordingly put myself under a shor e
course. I can truthfully state that I experienced relief frtin the
beginning, and to-day I feel in perfect health. I can conscientiously
recommend Bile Beans to anyone suffering from Biliousness and
Constipation. You are at perfect liberty to publish this statement
when and where you please.
Yours truly,
W. HESLEHURST.
BIX«X£ BEANS,
Are manufactured m one of the largest and best-equippea laboratories
in the world at Detriot, Michigan, U.S.A. They have been used
throughout that country for years by the most eminent medical men.
Every pill is a do§e. and their great worth lies in the fact that they
act directly on the bile ducts, and do not purge or strain the bowels,
therefore avoiding all vile after-effects that follow the using of nearly
all portative medicines sold to-day. They are an undoubted specific
for Headache, Indigestion, Constipation, Debility, Dyspepsia, Piles,
Pimp'cs, Female Ailments, Sallow Complexion, and all Liver Troubles.
They may be obtained at all Chemists, price per box, small

The sale of Gilbky’s Dry Gin in New South
Wales five times exceeds that of any other
