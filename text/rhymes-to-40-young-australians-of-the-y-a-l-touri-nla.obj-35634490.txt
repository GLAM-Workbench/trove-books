HAIL Y.A.L.!
[Written for George Schilling and the 40 Young
Australians).
Hail, Y.A.L. ! We’ve heard you play—
You 40 youngsters on your way
Around the World.
Your talent great
Has filled our halls in every State,
But that is only where it starts—
For very soon you filled our hearts
Which well-nigh break to see you go—
Dear 40 lads we’ve grown to know
And grown to love.
Where e’er on Earth
You chance to go and prove your worth
And triumph on from shore to shore.
No other Lands can love you more—
We vouch for this, sure (“ yes ” and “ ja ”)
YOU'VE WON THE HEARTS OF AFRICA.


C/o Barclays Bank,
Cape Town,
July 12th, 1935
To the 40 Young Australians,
Young Australia Teague,
Touring South Africa
Dear 40 young Australians, thanks
To every boy within your ranks
For this nice photo of the crowd
Of you —to have it I’m most proud.
For your Teague Badge I thank you, too,
I’ll wear your little Kangaroo
With pleasure and I’ll feel a swell —
Adopted by the Y.A.T. !
I hope you’re having lots of fun
And that you’ll all enjoy your run
Through The Reserve and find the Game,
Especially the lions, tame.
They’d surely love to hear your Band,
They’d think your big drum simply grand—
And probably your drummer too —
So keep wee Keithie out of view
And little Johnny out of sight
In case they prove a tempting bite.
The lions, sure, would fight to be
The one to join your Company
As mascot. They’d no longer stay
Contentedly on veld and vlei,
Nor in their native country bide,
If “ Scotty " told them of the Clyde,
They’d “ roll ” wi’ him to “ Glasca’ toon ”
To see it “ ganging roon’ and roon ’ ” —•
They’d follow him “ a’ roaring fu ’ ”
All up the Clyde to Glasgow Zoo—
But we may hope most fervently
That if a " tear comes in their e’e ”
The “ lump ” within their throat’s not he !
We wudna’ lose this winsome rogue
Wi’ his broad, braw, bricht, Scottish brogue.
And if " Mae West ” should chance to tell
That " Curves are in again ” as well,
The lion cubs would surely say :
“ Come up and see us any day,
" At any time—we’ll welcome you—
"We like good curves, indeed we do,
" We’ll sample them and have a feast—
" No matter if they’re West or East —
“ Curves on our Menu I Oh, Whoopee 1
“ We’ll ask the Big Game in to tea."


So when you see them in this mood.
Do not in meditation brood,
But call Les. Kearey and wee Billy
To tell them not to be so silly
Because you’re certainly “ elsewhere ”
And therefore you cannot be there
In that case, to be eaten up
By hungry beasts who want to sup.
And if they still, on stealthy paws.
Come prowling round with watery jaws
As though they’d like to eat their fill.
Then get young Les. and little Bill
To pull at them their famous “ faces ”
Get Les. to squint, while Bill grimaces—
For never have there been such good
Comedians out of Hollywood.
And, sure, no beast, on sea or land,
Could Leslie’s squint for long withstand—
Or if they do, then with a “ tuffet ”
Wee Bill could threaten them to buffet.
Or jump into your motor cars
And whiz away like shooting-stars,
And leave the Wilds and leave the Waste
Of The Reserve with utmost haste
For fear the big beasts like your faces
And leave, for me, of you no traces.
Although I would admire their taste
I’d hate your staying in their Waste (waist)
When you come back all hale and hearty
I want to have another party
At Muizenberg. So keep a day
For sports and races on your way
Through Cape Town once again, before
You set out on the sea once more.
Greg. Guinery is better now,
While he was ill I taught him how
To play the game of “ Battle-ships.”
He’s good—you’ll have to come to grips
With him in tliis, and see who wins ;
He knocked my poor old battle-tins
To smithereens and sank the lot
Before a single one I shot.
Now Mrs. " Wap ” and little Sam
Have also gone, and so I am
Without a friend with whom to ramble.
With thanks again from Ethel Campbell.


LETTER TO GEORGE NICHOLS AND THE
FORTY YOUNG AUSTRALIANS
Dear ** Scotty ” and other Georges three.
And Colin, Aub., and wee Johnny,
Four Bobs, three Johns, two Jacks and Den.,
Two Billies, Edward, Charles and Fen.,
Des., Robert, I.loyd, Dick, Frank and Ken.,
Con., Alf., Bert., Noel, and Douglas Mann,
Greg., Herby, lan, and Bill Noonan
(And little Beryl and Julian)
And Wally, Keith, and Neville Masters,
I’m glad you had so few disasters
And that you have come safely back
To Civilisation from that track
Of wild-beasts’ country. I’m delighted
To hear that many of you sighted
Big-game like lions and koodoos.
You’ll have to tell your kangaroos
About our tall giraffe so lanky
Who have no pocket for a hankie —
Their eyes will fall out just like rockets,
In pure amazement, from their sockets,
To hear these high-brows have no pockets ;
But then each J umbo has a trunk —
To deal with all the sundry junk—-
And probably they keep a half
For handkerchiefs for the giraffe
Who always need them for their eyes
Which are so very near the skies —
The clouds get in and make them mist-full.
That’s why they always look so wistful.
You never saw a gay giraffe
Which looked as though it liked to laugh ;
And neither can the poor things speak.
Nor roar, nor bark, nor even squeak ;
They can’t be hen-pecked by their wives
To reach whose lips no sound survives ;
Their voice so far-up has to come
That it gets lost—that’s why they’re dumb.
I’m sorry " Scotty ” for the dire
Mishap you had on the barbed-wire,
And that you’re bandaged up and lame
Through being the only wounded game
In The Reserve. It was hard luck
To get, thus, on the hard lines stuck.
You should take Aub. with his good light
When you are going out at night.
But you will soon be right as ever
For Avon is so kind and clever
(And used to it) when you endeavour
A leg, or arm, or head to sever.
She’ll mend you up, from crown to toe.
And nobody will ever know
That you are not as good as new
When you appear in the Revue.


I hope no handsome J o’burg swain
Will there get Avon to remain.
Just say to him, politely ; —“ Mister,
“ Don’t dare to come and steal our Sister,
“ Or you’ll get forty good black eyes
“ And never from your death-bed rise.”
That is the way to treat all rooters
Who come along as Avon’s suitors.
I do not wonder that you all
Get hurt so often when you fall.
When you’ve got such -a pretty nurse
To tend and save you from the hearse —
For who would mind a bump or bash,
Or punctured leg, or any gash,
Or mumps, or measles, or a blister.
If they were nursed by such a Sister ?
Will each of you, obligingly,
Give her a good big kiss from me ?
Well, now for all the news —here goes,
Although, dear youngsters, goodness knows
What I’m to say —for since you left.
You forty kids, the Cape’s bereft
Of any kind of joy or fun,
And as for news—there’s simply none.
The Mountain covers up its head,
As though it knew the town was dead.
It knows there is no fun to seek —
The pine-fringed crags of Devil’s Peak
In very truth do “ peak and pine,”
And Dion’s Head has lost its spine
Beneath a cloud. Thus, all the Cape
Can only peak and yawn and gape
(As though it suffered from the ’flu)
While you’re beyond the Great Karoo.
The Opera House looks very drear
And seems to say :—" Oh, dear ! Oh, dear !
" Where are my babes ? ” then has a tyecr—
That is its only mode of cheer.
Poor Mr. Fielding sheds a tear
And sometimes two. And gay Miss Fisher
Is just as sad as one could wish her.
And all your hostesses so pretty
Are easily picked out in the city—
They look so sad —their mouths turn down
Instead of up. In fact the town
Is neither gay, nor glad, nor sporty.
Nor anything that rhymes with ” forty.”
Upon the erst-while merry shore
Of Muizenberg there’s nothing more
Than desolation—not a bairn
Upon the sand-hills of Glencairn
Comes sliding down. My poor old car.
Too, seems to wonder where you are.


It hoots in quite a mournful way
As though it really wished to say :
“ Where are those merry little blighters
“ That once I knew, those dreadful fighters
“ Who made a battle-ground of me
“ Whenever they came out to tea.
“ Who jabbed and bit each other. Say,
“ They surely haven’t gone away
" For ever—they’ll come back, I trust,
“ Or all four tyres I'm going to bu’st.
" I’ll spring a leak, or do a crash
“ Or something else that’s really rash.”
This is the song of my old car
Which wonders where on earth you are.
Its sparking-plugs no longer spark,
It might have come out of the Ark
To see it move. It has no “ pep ”
Although with all my force I step
On the accelerator button —
It’s just about as dead as mutton.
And all the traffic has to stop
Because of it. The traffic-cop
Shouts out to me ;—“ Now, get a move on,
“ You slow ‘ N.D.'—can’t you improve on
" That funeral pace ? Can’t you read * Ry.'
"Or even ‘Go ' ? He’s lots to say—”
In Dutch or English he can curse
His language grows from bad to worse,
His words are long and very bad.
He is a most hard-hearted lad.
To see me he is never glad.
When in the street I cause a block
He threatens me in jail to lock.
(I do not like this Cop at all,
I wish that off his perch he’d fall.)
But then, of course, he does not know
Why my old car is filled with woe
And moves as if it had the gout.
But this will change, without a doubt.
When it has got a well-packed load
Of young Australians on the road—
’Twill snort “ Australia Will Be There
And kick its wheels up in the air,
And dance for joy to feel once more
Well loaded-up for Muizen’s shore
Or for Glencaim’s sand-hills white.
A merry load would put it right.
Say, did you see " The Man from Gwelo ”
When you were there ? He was a fellow
Worth seeing—for he lived on roots
And bulbs, and grass, and other shoots,
While lost, for months. His clothes in rags,
He had no jacket and no bags,
And even his (like Ken’s) wee shirt,
“ His mother made ” was lost in dirt.


But then, they say, his long-grown beard
Just like an over-coat appeared.
For he could drape it on each shoulder
And round and round when it got colder.
(When he was seen by " Beaver ” players,
Their sad opponents were the payers—
Each player added to their score
(When they saw him) a thousand more.
His was a beard ! —the bushiest.
The frilliest and rushiest :
It needed not a bit of wheedling.
Why, Rip Van Winkle’s was a seedling.
And Samson’s just a bit of fluff,
While “ Whiskers Blake’s ” was merely bluff
(With which “ The Marvel ” once got rough)
And just a rumour—as compared
With this great beard the Gweloan aired
(Beside it Blake’s could hold no boost)
In it the birds came home to roost,
The breeze went humming through its roots
And played Bob’s song of ** O.K. Toots
A thing that Blake’s could never do
Though a South-easter blasted through.
I doubt if Blake’s could ever squeak
Compared to the aeolian shriek
When this great “ Beaver ” took a stroll—
It filled the air from Pole to Pole.
There was no need to “ listen in ”
To this great wireless, on his chin.
On “ Whiskers Blake,” I’m sad to say,
This Gweloan had it every way
Regarding beards —he was a toff
Till his wife made him shave it off
When he got home ; but until then
He was the king of hairy men—
All other hairy fame he routed.
No beard like his had ever sprouted.
He lived and ate like a baboon
Until had passed full many a moon—
When, joy and rapture, one fine day.
He saw some wagons on their way
Down South. The drivers wondered what
New type of gorilla they had got.
’Twas lucky that he was not shot.
Now " Scotty ” and the rest of you—
From George to J ohnny Donoghue,
I hope you like the Falls and spy
A lot of hippopotami
And crocodiles who take it easy
Upon the banks of the Zambesi.
You must go in a small canoe
And see the tree just as it grew
When Livingstone was there —the same
Old tree on which he carved his name.
I hope you’ll see the rainbow bright
(If it’s full moon) at dead of night.


And hear the thunder of the flood
As down it hurtles with a thud.
Then in the Forest feel the spray
As it goes floating miles away,
Then down the Grotto have a scramble.
With best of luck to all.

TO COLIN CROFT, OF THE 40 YOUNG
AUSTRALIANS,
the talented young actor, female impersonator,
singer and dancer, who has taken South Africa by
storm, and won the highest praise for his fine
acting and splendid impersonations —but, also—•
much more than this —
TO COLIN CROFT, THE SON OF A
DIGGER,
who has inherited staunchness of character, bravery
in adversity, and all the manly attributes which
went to the apotheosis of the A.I.F.
COLIN —’tis more than twenty years ago
Since first we saw the glorious Diggers go
a
I
Over the ocean, past our native shore.
Through awful years when they went forth
to War.
Long years they waged that war for Empire then—
Your father was among those glorious men
In that great army which went far to fight
That Righteousness should triumph over
Might.
Nowhere on earth were braver men than these
Who touched our Country as they Crossed
the seas.
CROFT —as of old, those great Australians came,
We know their sons, like you, would do
the same
Rose there the need —for in your boyish soul
There glows the Anzac spirit of the whole
Of your great country. You will be as they
Although, I trust, there never comes the
day
For putting that rare spirit, in your breast,
Born of Australia, to the ghastly test —
Though if it comes—with all the Anzacs gone—
'TlS SUCH AS YOU WILL BEAR THEIR
1 GLORY ON.

EXAMPLE OF ANSWERS TO LETTERS—
VARIED FOR DIFFERENT BOYS.
C/o Barclays Bank,
Cape Town,
11/9/35.
To Charles Stanton,
Drum-Major,
Y.A.L. Band.
Dear Charlie,
Thanks for your nice note
Which from Johannesburg you wrote.
Now I have got a bit of time
I’m answering all the boys, in rhyme,
Who wrote to me—l got a host
Of letters—what a lovely post !
I met the Postman tottering in
To Barclays Bank. He did not grin
Nor answer when I said : “ Goeie Dag ! "
Pie gave a growl and just said : " Ag ! ”
I saw him stagger, almost fall.
So propped him up against the wall.
But he went down just like a stone
And let out an uproarious groan.
At this, the bald and very stout
Bank Manager came rushing out
And telephoned for a Boy Scout.
The Manager then called the Sub.,
The Ushers joined in the hubbub :
“The man’s been overloaded, say I
" A case for the S.P.C.A .
“ He’s loaded in a shameful manner I ”
A Teller ran and got a spanner—
Undid the buttons of his collar.
But, now, he did not move or holler
But fixed me with a stony stare
Which grew into an angry glare.
What could be making him so furious
With me ? His scowl was quite injurious.
I could not think why this should be
Or why he was so wrath with me.
And then he just collapsed again.
" He’s dying, sure, of overstrain,"
A customer was heard to say—
The Manager yelled in dismay
And with the Staff let out a roar :
" He can’t die here —on our new floor —
“ Our new-laid floor —Holy Codoleum !
“ He’ll spoil our brand-new brown linoleum I "


Again lie glared—mad as a Hatter—
At me. I said : " What is the matter ?*’
Then noticed that his bag looked fatter
Than usual. On this I commented,
At this his rage became more vented—
He foamed at me and went quite crook,
Opened his bag and screamed : " Just 100k —
“ The load I’ve had to lump about Mil”
And on the floor he turned it out.
And, oh, unto my utmost glee,
I found the letters were for me.
(And this, then, was the reason why
I bulked both in his bag and eye.)
I left the man and let him swear—
I jumped six feet into the air
For very joy, and hit the breeze.
The daring “ jong ” on the trapeze
Had nothing on my wild career.
My head just missed the chandelier.
The Bank Clerks fell down in a heap—
They thought I’d won the Irish Sweep.
I said : “ Og, Nee ! But something better—
" From Charlie I have got a letter ! . . . .
The Postman, now, pricked up each ear
Which had been lying very near
The entrance door. He cheered up quite—
And said : “ Ekskuus ! That’s quite all right !
" Ek weet nie when I thus exploded
“ Baie kwaad from being overloaded
44 Dat hierdie is from the young Diggers 1 ”
He then let out three hearty sniggers,
And all the Bank Clerks cheered : “ Hoor ! Hoor !
And got behind their bars once more.
I thanked the Postman for his double
Work, and all his extra trouble,
He said : “ Don’t mention it, dear Madam,
“ I'm sure I’m very glad you had ’em,
44 And if to them you would reply,
“ On me you surely can rely.”
I thought that this was most forgiving.
And I’m quite glad he went on living,
So on the envelope you’ve read
The gracious words to him I said :
” Mr. Postman, I’m your debtor
" If you'll kindly take this letter
" To Charles Stanton on the Rand
“ With the Young Australian Band.
44 You will know him by his baton
44 With his smart white cloak and hat on :
44 Never have you seen I'll wager
” Such a dandy, wee Drum-Major,
44 With a voice so regimental,
A 4 And moustache so ornamental.


’Twas worth paying any rental
" For a stall to see this weeny,
“ Strutting Hitler-Mussolini.
"Or to see him as Conductor
When he acted as instructor
To the Capetown Orchestra
(Hail, the pocket-Lyle-T aylah !)
When he put them through their paces,
Keeping them well in their places,
“ Scowling at them here and there
When they made too big a blare,
Urging them, when not enough
Volume, on to louder stuff.
“ See this small conductor’s skill
With the baton amd you will
“ Talk no more of Pickerill.
Find Charles, please, and give him this —-
“ Him you surely cannot miss
" In the young Australians’ ranks
“ Dankie ! Mr. Postman ! Thanks ! ”
“ Here the Band can now be found
(Either here or by their sound) :
“ Post Box 1574.
“ On the G.P.O. Ground Floor,
" (Theatres Consolidated)
" At Johannesburg located
"In the Transvaal. Thanks to you
" Mr. Postman, and adieu ! "
By the Postman’s smiling face
(On this envelope) and pace,
I think he will find the place.
So with him again I’m friends
(That is how the matter ends)
If he mails this letter through
And delivers it to you.
Now, Yabonga, once again—•
Thus, tri-lingually, I remain
Zonkl wena ’mxnani umfaan
(Weh-weh-zig-an-zag-an-jaan—
Wow !! !) Conzela mena funa
Baie liefde, baie soene,
Bn geluk, and gay whoopee !
Yours to cinders, B.M.C.


LINES ACCOMPANYING A PRESENT OF
BOXING GLOVES.
{On the dispersal of the Y.A.L. South African
Touring Party, at Sydney, please give these boxing
gloves to the two best boxers among the big boys, and
the two best boxers among the small boys. A Boxing
Tournament might be held on the voyage to decide who
are the champions. E.C.)
Dear Forty (or to those to whom applies
The following). I wish you all black eyes,
Red noses, and some dislocated jaws,
That’s why I’m giving you, for your young paws.
Four pairs of boxing gloves (of sets a pair
For those who’re big, and those who’re small to
wear).
I know that boys of your age must be fighters,
But there’s just one thing wrong with you young
blighters—
You don’t fight with your fists—you jab and bite
And gouge each others’ eyes out when you fight.
That’s why I give you, with my love, this bunch
Of mittens—take my love in every punch
You give and take ! Stand round and make a ring
And let your fighters with their fists have fling
With “ rights ” and “ lefts ” at their opponents’
jaws,
Stand up and use your fists to fight your cause.
Take for your guidance your good athlete. Jack —
You can’t imagine he’d do else than whack
A worthy foeman, with his good clenched knuckle,,
A blow that would make any foeman buckle..
Let all more famous Dempseys "go to pot ”
Just pattern yourselves on the one you’ve got :
There may be Dempseys greater in their whack.
But not in character than your own Jack.
Now, any of you forty youngsters, if
You want to give an erst-while friend a biff—
Swing out a " right ” at his offending eye,
Or bash his teeth as far as they will fly,
Then swing a “ left " and get him on the snout.
Or give him one straight blow and knock him out.
Hit out bare-fisted, or else don the glove
And stouch each other with my fondest love.


FORTY YOUNG AMBASSADORS.
(Dedicated to “ Wap ” of the Young Australia
League, and to his Forty Thieves of our Hearts.)
AMBASSADORS —yes, forty strong !
Not all Geneva with its throng
Of busy peace-makers can vie
With your unconscious ministry
To this our Country. Who’d have thought.
When first your talent here you brought,
That you the spirit of our Band
Would foster ? Did you understand
Just how our hearts would tune to hear
Our “ Sarie Marais ” come true and clear.
As tribute to us, from the hand
Of forty youngsters in a band
That visits from a distant land—
Or our young speech upon your tongue
As “ Stem of Afrika ” you’ve sung.
You forty lads have done much more
Than tour our Band from shore to shore.
For you have made all Sections thrill
To hear these songs, with new goodwill :
You’ve shown us that we have begun
To be a Nation joined as one—
To be a People when we hear
These songs to Afrikaners dear.
You’ve heard the way each Province cheers
When “ Sarie ” breaks upon their ears
(Yes, I can swear that ne’er before
Has Durban’s Town Hall sounded more
With wild applause to hear it played.
You Forty made a daring raid
On Jingoism. You achieved
What one could scarcely have believed—
Cheers for old “ Sarie ” in a town
Where recently it was howled down !)
Your Douglas Mann has sung our songs
In Afrikaans where it belongs—
You’ve shown you honour this, our speech,
A language in the heart of each
South African who holds it worth
Beyond all riches of the earth —
A speech for which they bled and died.
When they had lost all things beside
They clung to this brave rugged tongue.
This is the language you have sung
And knit our Folk —and, what is more,
You’ve knit our Country to the shore
Of far Australia—opened doors
Once locked between. Our hearts are yours—
HAIB—FORTY YOUNG AMBASSADORS !
South Africa,
August 21st, 1935.
