THE HISTORY
OF THE
FIRST BATTALION
A.I.F.
1 9 1 4 — 1 9 1 9


PREFACE.
BHIS record of the doings and achievements of the First
Australian Infantry Battalion during the memorable
years 1914-1918 has been written primarily for ex-
*3pMaaatfl members of the Battalion and the friends and relatives
of those who made the Great Sacrifice. At the same time
it is hoped that all those who arel interested in the A.I.F. will derive
pleasure from a perusal of its pages.
The History Committee, while conscious of the many short-
comings of the work, have tried to make it as accurate as possible.
The Nominal Roll of those who, at one time or another, were
members of the Battalion, was supplied by Base Records, as was also
the list of those who received decorations and awards. These have
been carefully checked and a number of mistakes and omissions
rectified. It is possible that other errors, both in the Nominal Roll
and in other parts of the book, have passed undetected. We feel
sure that readers will appreciate the difficulties of the task and extend
us their indulgence for such errors as may remain.
We desire to thank those members of the Battalion who
generously collaborated by placing their diaries, photographs and
other records at our disposal. Special mention must be made of
Captain C. E. W. Bean for his valuable advice and friendly criticism.
Permission from the War Museum to use official photographs is
gratefully acknowledged, as are also the blocks kindly lent to us by
Mr. H. W. Cavill, late of the 2nd Battalion.
The Old Battalion now belongs to history, but those desirous
of perpetuating cherished associations will find an opportunity of
doing so by joining the First Battalion, A.I.F. Association. The
Honorary Secretary, Mr. H. H. Blunden, of 5 Clarendon Street,
Vaucluse, will be pleased to supply any information desired.

FOREWORD.
By Major-General Sir NEVILL M. SMYTH, 3?.®., K.C.B., who commanded the
1st Australian Infantry Brigade from May, 1915, till the end of 1916.
HHE stirring history of the premier regiment of Australian
Infantry is certain to appeal to the imagination and
patriotism of everyone in our Southern British Continent,
for within a moderate compass it sets forth the successive
stages of the World War, from the Australian viewpoint.
I commend this volume to every Australian, young or old, rich or
poor.
It was my privilege to share the experiences and the glory of
the Ist Battalion on many a fiercely-contested battlefield, and also
to see many a noble hero suffer martyrdom in the cause of Eternal
Justice.
That the Australian Forces helped to save Australia from the
tyrant, from the iron heel of the usurper and from the serfdom, was
put beyond question by captured enemy documents which displayed
the enemy’s intentions in the event of their winning the war.
The Australian soldier showed as much initiative and intelligent
discipline as any combatants on the Western Front, but his especial
characteristic was mens aequa in arduis, or calmness in emergency.
I well remember, in the Battle of Lone Pine, a reinforcement of
a hundred men of the Ist Battalion, conspicuous for their stature
and physique, had just been landed and was sent straight into the
hand-to-hand fight which was raging in the maze of trenches and
tunnels. A corporal with a fair beard, stripped to the waist and
covered with wounds, staggered out into the open and said to them,
“The boys are keeping up the name grandly in there.’’ The new-
comers heard his words. They, too, would “keep up the name”; I
could see that. They marched calmly on, entered the fray and took
a terrible toll of the enemy: but in a short time many of them were
carried out with severe wounds which actually seemed to them a
subject for joking and hilarity, so persistent was their courage.
The character and credit of a military force must chiefly depend
upon the technical efficiency, the genius and unshaken fortitude of
its commander, and these pages will prove how the senior officers
of the Ist Battalion stamped their impress on all around them. The
discipline of this regiment was that of regular veterans whose whole
being was concentrated on the all-absorbing object of fighting for
the right, and in the hour of victory they were, as always, cheerful,
honourable, chivalrous and merciful.
“Bravest, where half a world of men
Are brave beyond all earth’s rewards,
So stoutly none shall charge again
Till the last breaking of the swords.”

CHAPTER ONE.
THE BIRTH OF AN ARMY.
HUGUST 4, 1914. Cable and wireless hurried Britain’s
declaration of war against Germany to the world. At
Victoria Barracks, Sydney, as in all parts of the Empire,
were enacted the opening scenes of the great drama that
was to have the world as its stage, and millions of men
and women as its actors.
Not since the Boer War had Victoria Barracks been the scene of
a rush of volunteer soldiers. From the city and suburbs came
thousands, eager for the breathless adventure. Clerks laid down their
pens. Shopkeepers walked out of their shops. Solicitors paused
with their briefs. Workmen downed picks and shovels. And in the
backblocks bushmen were setting out on the trek to the city, by train,
by horse, and with Matilda on their backs. Old and young, with
Sydney caught in a great wave of excitement, they marched to the
birthplace of a new army in Paddington.
England had accepted Australia’s offer of troops, but the
organization of the Australian force had to be settled. The New
Guinea contingent had next to be dispatched. Finally, arrangements
had to be made for commands and staffs. So for the first fortnight
little could be done in forming units, except enrolling volunteers
and telling them to hold themselves in readiness for duty.
The call came on August 17. All those who had volunteered
in Sydney were assembled at Victoria Barracks, and divided into
four battalions. Thus the Ist Battalion came into being. The men
Were marched out to Randwick racecourse, and their soldiering began.
Randwick was a strange sight on the Battalion’s first morning
in camp. It was a misty, chilly dawn, and on the course the race-
horses were training as usual. But in the grandstands, instead of
cheering thousands of Sydney racegoers, were the sleeping forms of
the new Australian army. When reveille came they watched the
horses at work—and wondered if Kingsburgh would win the
Melbourne Cup in November. But the men were soon called to their
own training for the more serious business of war. Coffee was
followed by physical jerks before breakfast, and so the day began.
1914 —August.


The next few days were devoted to organisation. The troops
had to be clothed and equipped; officers and N.C.O.’s selected. As all
of these were on probation, many changes were made, but soon the
Ist Battalion began to take definite shape. It was fortunate in having
in its ranks so many old soldiers—men from almost every regiment
in the British Army, many of whom were N.C.O.’s with long-service
medals. Meantime recruiting was still going on, and medical
examinations searched out the unfit.
On August 29th the Battalion left Randwick and went under
canvas at Kensington racecourse, scene of so many “pony” meetings.
Here each company had its own lines and organisation was easier.
Training went ahead by leaps and bounds; numbers were completed,
and all the odd details filled up. An examination was held of the
N.C.O.’s who had been acting, and permanent appointments were
made.
On September 5 there occurred the excitement of a general
election. There was a polling booth on the ground and the com-
panies were marched thither to vote —surely the most orderly polling
booth ever seen. On the 10th a parade was held at which Lady
Edeline Strickland, wife of the Governor of New South Wales, at
the request of M. Chayet (Consul-General for France) presented the
Battalion with a set of magnificent band instruments manufactured
by Thibouville-Lamy and subscribed for by the French residents of
Sydney. The music of those instruments was to raise the spirits of
the men in many a difficult time later on.
About this time the companies of the Ist Battalion were
affiliated with the Citizen Force units. The idea was that, as far as
possible, the officers of each company should be those who had served
in the unit with which that company was affiliated. Thus A Com-
pany, which was commanded by Major Dawson, represented the
Australian Rifles. C Company, commanded by Captain Robins,
represented St. George’s Rifles. D Company, commanded by Captain
McGuire, represented the Irish Rifles—and so on. Moreover the
Citizen Force units presented their affiliated companies with bugles
suitably inscribed.
So quickly did our civilians adapt themselves to a soldiering life
that on the 14th the Battalion was inspected by General Bridges,
commanding the Division. On the 17th the first route march Was
made, to South Head. It was very wet, but in those days route
marches signified to the men that they were really part of an army,
and they enjoyed them. Besides people in the suburbs were enthralled
by the pageantry of it. Later on route marches were not so popular.
On the 19th the Governor-General (Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson)
1914—August-Scptcmbcr.


visited the camp and inspected the Battalion, which was now feeling
fully trained and ready for the adventure overseas.
Rumors of an early embarkation were now becoming chronic.
There was a strong tendency to quit training, and to spend the time
saying good-bye and taking out best girls instead. But leave was
not easy to obtain. Many were the ruses employed to get it. One
band of heroes conceived the idea of sending telegrams to themselves.
But they lacked that generalship that was afterwards to become the
attribute of the Diggers. Because 27 telegrams, all handed in at the
same post office at the same time, bearing the same message—“ Come
at once mother dying”—did not have the desired effect.
Sydney, by this time, wanted to see her troops, so a march of
the Brigade took place through the streets on October 6. The Ist
Battalion was now equipped to the last button, and it made a great
show. An enthusiastic crowd cheered it along the route, and it did
full credit to its training.
On the 14th Kensington racecourse was wanted for a pony
meeting, so every tent had to be struck lest the view of the spectators
should be interfered with—the troops had to clear out for the day.
Although every Australian is a born punter, on this occasion the
thing was termed “a bit over the odds.” It was war, and the
opinions of the troops who had to suffer the inconvenience is better
imagined than chronicled verbatim.
1914—October.


CHAPTER TWO.
THE VOYAGE.
■HE longed-for embarkation came at last. On October 17
the last leave was taken, "Kenso” treating the men to a
thorough soaking by way of farewell. At 9 o’clock on
the morning of Sunday, October 18, the Battalion
marched out, en route for Dawes Point and the ship.
The march down Oxford Street and along Macquarie Street
was unexpected by most of the friends of the men, but when Circular
Quay was reached there was a dense throng, and the troops had great
trouble in getting through to the ferry boats which were to take
them to the transport. The “Afric,” H.M. Transport A 19, was
lying in Farm Cove—cradle of Australia's history—and the
Battalion was safely on board by noon. There were no absentees—
in fact there was one man too many, but he, unfortunate fellow, was
sent back to join the Ist Reinforcement at Liverpool.
The strength of the Battalion embarked was 1,013, including
32 officers.

Ist Fid. Amb. 2 (M.O.’s), Volunteer Automobile
Corps 2, Y.M.C.A. 1 5
Ten of the Ist Battalion Transport Section went on the “Clan
McCorquodale” with the horses, only eight of which came on the
“Afric.”
On the afternoon of that Sunday the “Afric” steamed down
the harbor to the noisy farewells of many ferry boats. The great
adventure had begun.
The Commander of the “Afric” was Captain Marshall, an
R.N.R. man, who afterwards did good service in the North Sea.
He was quite the right type to command a troopship, and things
went smoothly from the start. The first night at sea was fairly
rough, but all hands soon settled down. Some of the men had
managed to get a printing plant presented to them, and had set it
up in one of the cabins. The second day at sea saw the first issue
of the “Kangaroo,” which was produced daily until the end of the
voyage. It consisted of one full page, well printed and with a
collection of wood-cuts, turned to novel use by the topical allusions
that accompanied them. After the voyage the printer found his
occupation gone and, having no taste for soldiering, promptly de-
serted. But during the short life of the "Kangaroo” it served an
excellent purpose, and did much to relieve the tedium of the voyage.
Albany was to be our first port: there all the ships of the convoy
were to assemble. On October 23, in the Great Australian Bight,
the “Afric” was spoken to by the Japanese cruiser “Ibuki.” This
Was the first intimation many of us had that the Japanese navy was
helping to escort us. The “Ibuki” had 12-inch guns and, with the
exception of H.M.A.S. Australia, was by far the most powerful
fighting ship south of the line.
Albany was reached on October 25. Only a few transports
had then arrived, but during the week that followed they kept drop-

ping in until there were 26 Australian troopers in King George’s
Sound. Two more, with the W.A. contingent, were to join the
convoy off Fremantle. Then 10 troopers, all painted grey, arrived
with the New Zealanders. With them were some of the escort,
headed by H.M.S. Minotaur, flagship of the China Squadron. The
Melbourne had been doing sentry go outside all the time and nothing
more had been heard of the Ibuki until she came in with the New
Zealanders.
On Friday, October 29, the Afric went alongside to take in
water, and the troops went ashore for a route march. On Saturday
morning about 5.30, just as she was about to move out from the
wharf, there was an alarm of fire. The troops turned out promptly
and went to their fire stations. Smoke rose from a ventilator near
the after hatch, but it was nothing much as a blaze, and was soon
put out. The discipline and steadiness of the men was excellent
and augured well for the future.
On Sunday at 6 a.m., November 1, the vanguard of the fleet
left King George’s Sound. It was a sight to be remembered. The
36 ships were lying at anchor in three lines, the New Zealanders
being nearest to Breaksea. Headed by the Orvieto, with the General
on board, they steamed out to sea in single file. Once out to sea
the convoy formed up in three lines, the Orvieto leading the centre,
the Euripides, on which was Colonel McLaurin, commanding the
Ist Infantry Brigade, the starboard line, and the Wiltshire the Port
Division, The Afric was the fourth ship in the Starboard Division.
On November 3—Melbourne Cup Day—the last two ships
with the West Australians on board joined the convoy, making a
grand total of 36 ships with approximately 29,500 men. On the
7th the Minotaur left the convoy in a prodigious hurry, signalling
that she was going on other service and wishing us good luck. The
Melbourne now became the senior ship of the escort.
On November 9, the troops went crazy with excitement. At
7 a.m. H.M.A.S. Sydney, which had been guarding the port side
of the convoy, was seen to hurry off westward towards Cocos Island,
50 miles away. At about 10 a.m. the Ibuki, cleared for action,
moved over towards that flank. H.M.A.S. Melbourne followed.
Both hoisted their battle-flags, the Melbourne a big Union Jack at
the top of the mast, and the Ibuki a Rising Sun. Something was
doing, and we soon heard about it.
The Sydney had raced off to fight an enemy cruiser.
The Ibuki signalled the Melbourne; “May I join in the action?”
The Melbourne replied: "It’s hard luck, but we are doing our
duty.”
1914—October-November.


At about 10.30 a.m. an excited “Sparks” bolted for the bridge
of the Afric. He had picked up a wireless message.
“Enemy beached to save herself sinking. Am pursuing
attendant collier.”
Then another message came:
"Emden beached and done for; am pursuing collier.”
So the famous German commerce-destroyer had been destroyed
in turn by an Australian cruiser. A great burst of cheering came
from the whole convoy. It was war with a vengeance.
On November 11a wireless message told us that an armed
merchantman would soon pass us. Shortly afterwards a big steamer
with three funnels hove in sight. The Ibuki, now the only warship
with the convoy, went across to intercept her. She was the Empress
of Asia, owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and usually traded
between Vancouver and Hong Kong. She was flying the White
Ensign and signalled that she was bound for Cocos Island.
The line was crossed on the 13 th. King Neptune and his
retinue came on board at 2 p.m. with due ceremony, and much fun
was indulged in by all. Another warship joined us, H.M.S.
Hampshire (which later was lost in the North Sea with Lord
Kitchener on board). News was also received that the Konigsberg
had been destroyed by H.M.S. Chatham. On the 14th we heard
that the Sydney would be passing through our lines at about 5 a.m.
the next day, with a request that no demonstration should be made
on account of the German wounded on board. She passed through
at 4.30 a.m., a ghostly shape in the dim light, and very few saw her.
We arrived at Colombo on November 15 and anchored off the
breakwater. We found here the Russian cruiser, Askold, which had
been wrongly reported as being a victim of the Emden. As a matter
of fact, they had never seen each other. Because of her five funnels
she was christened the “Packet of Woodbines." Whilst we were at
Colombo, officers of the Sydney were in great request. One dined
on the Afric, and we got full details of the fight from him. We
also saw some of the prisoners being taken on board the Omrah.
The convoy left Colombo on November 17 in three divisions,
the slower boats leading the way. Owing to the destruction of the
Emden and the Konigsberg, precautions were somewhat relaxed.
On the 25th Aden was reached, and we sailed again on the following
day. The Ibuki left us here, after sending messages of goodwill.
On the 27th news was received that the troops were to complete
their training at Cairo instead of proceeding direct to England. Suez
1914—November.


was reached on December 1, and on the 2nd the Afric entered the
Canal, reaching Port Said on the following day. She sailed for
Alexandria on the 4th and arrived at 8 a.m. on the sth.
Alexandria was crowded with shipping, including 23 interned
German ships. On the first night some of the men took French
leave, going ashore in a native boat. When they returned they
found a guard on the gangway. The native boatmen took fright
and landed them on the stern buoy to which the Afric was moored
—and fled. One soldier tried to swarm aboard by the rope, but fell
into the water. His crestfallen companions, unwilling to emulate
his feat, stayed huddled sadly on the buoy until they were
ignominiously brought on board.
Private Boothman died of pneumonia on December 6. It was
the first death in the Battalion and it cast quite a gloom over the ship.
1914—December.


CHAPTER THREE.
MENA.
S|j™gj[HE voyage ended on December 8. The Battalion dis-
|||« embarked for Cairo where we detrained and were taken
ij|l| to Mena by electric trams, marching from Mena House
to the camping ground in the shadow of the Pyramids,
iiial scene of war-like activity through the centuries. Ancient
Pharaohs would have wondered had they seen the gathering of an
army over the dusty tombs. On December 10 the Battalion had its
first route march in the sand, going out past the “White House” to
the “Valley of Despair.” We got to know that blisteringly hot sand
very well in the months that followed. It never became any easier
to march on, and the Valley was well named.
However, the sand did not interfere with the enterprising spirit
of the men, nor with their capacity for enjoyment. For the first
few weeks the Pyramids looked as if they were covered with flies.
One of our chaps fell off the Great Pyramid and cracked his head open
the first day we were there. Thus did a soldier of a young country
come in contact with one of the oldest buildings in the world.
Christmas Day came. We were a long way from home. There
was no wattle or waratahs; no picnics to Manly, but all Companies
did their best to have a real Australian Christmas, and some aspired
to turkey. (We got a tougher Turkey later on!). There was a
church parade. General Birdwood making his first appearance as far
as the Ist Battalion was concerned.
A week later the Division was formed up for inspection by a
very different person. He was the late Sir George Reid, High
Commissioner for Australia in London. The few who heard his
opening Words will never forget them—“ Australians! You're the
limit!”
On January I, 1915, the Battalion was re-organised into four
companies.
A and C formed A under Major Dawson.
D and E formed B under Capt. M’Guirc.
1914—December.


B and H formed C under Capt. Hill.
F and G formed D under Capt. Swannell.
Training went on vigorously throughout January. On Feb-
ruary 8 a Brigade scheme was carried out at Beni Yusef. The
Brigadier was not pleased—and said so. But a week later, at the
end of a three days’ scheme, he told us he could report to the General
that the Brigade was "fit for war.”
When we got back to Mena after this scheme we found that the
first reinforcement had arrived. This was quickly absorbed, as the
strenuous training, coupled with the amusements of Cairo, had left
gaps in the ranks. The next excitement was a re-vaccination of the
Battalion. There was a lot of smallpox in Egypt, and it was thought
that the troops should be given the cowpox of the country. Lymph
was secured from the water buffalo, and singularly strong it was, too.
On February 28 the 3rd Brigade moved out of Mena for parts
unknown. We felt that things were moving at last. But training
still went on, musketry in particular, and the Battalion’s marksman-
ship improved mightily. On March 2 the Battalion fired at disap-
pearing targets, representing an advancing enemy, at unknown ranges,
and scored over 25 per cent, of hits for rounds actually expended.
No. 8 platoon got 127 hits for 347 rounds. March was a month of
training of larger formations. There were two Divisional schemes.
Everyone felt it was high time we got into the war. The troops
were becoming impatient. Then on the 29th Sir lan Hamilton in-
spected the Division. It was felt that we should not have long to
wait.
Yet when the move did come, it came as a surprise. Battalion
sports had been arranged for April 2; much trouble had been taken
in preparing the ground and in running off preliminary heats. Then
a dramatic order came. The sports were abandoned and preparations
made for a quick move. This involved a tremendous amount of
work, but early on April 3 tents were struck. At 6 p.m. the first
half of the Battalion marched off for Cairo, and entrained for Alex-
andria. • The second half moved off at 11 p.m., the black shadow of
the Pyramids bidding a silent farewell.
It was "Good-bye, Cairo”—and fighting at last.
The second reinforcement, which had arrived on April 1,
brought up the Battalion to full strength. The officers of the
Battalion when it left Egypt were:—
C. 0.: Lieut.-Col. L. Dobbin.
2nd Command: Major F. J. Kindon.

CHAPTER FOUR.
TO GALLIPOLI.
■N Easter Sunday, April 4, 1915, the Ist Battalion
embarked on Transport A. 11, the Minnewaska. This
was a fine ship of the Atlantic Transport Line, built for
carrying first-class passengers only, but she was not
properly fitted as a transport. There were no tables,
hammocks or other conveniences. The men had to live, sleep and
eat on the iron decks in the holds. The troops Were put on service
rations—bully beef and biscuits. One of the men wrote: “Every-
thing seems to be iron about this business. We are on an iron ship.
We sleep on an iron deck. We are fed on iron rations, and now
we are told that our Commander is Sir lan Hamilton.” But the
fact that something was doing more than atoned for these discomforts.
We had about 1900 men on board, and about 500 horses.
Horse boats were on the deck with let down ends, designed for
landing the animals on beaches. We still had no definite knowledge
of our destination, but “the Dardanelles” was on everybody’s lips.
For the next few days we lay in the harbor at Alexandria, and
incidentally took on board a quantity of timber with which to
construct a wharf. The censorship was in full swing, and very
irksome to many. The knowledge that one could not write of one’s
movements without one’s letters being quizzed at by strangers was
very galling to those who did not appreciate the necessity of the
thing.
On April 9 General Birdwood came on board, and at 6.30 a.m.
on the following day we sailed. It soon leaked out that we were
bound for Lemnos, where the 3rd Brigade had been for the past
month, and that the Army was concentrating there for an attack
on the Gallipoli Peninsula, with control of the Dardanelles as its
objective. On Sunday, April 11, we were among “the islands of
the blest” in perfect weather. War seemed out of place in such a
halcyon world. After church service General Birdwood addressed
the troops, and told us of the job we had before us. On the following
day we arrived at Lemnos. Here we first saw the Super-Dreadnought
Queen Elizabeth, afterwards to be affectionately known as “Lizzie.”
We also met our old Russian friend, the “Packet of Woodbines.”
On April 14 we tried to put the Battalion ashore in ships’
boats. We started at 9.30 a.m., but only had three companies ashore

by 2.30 p.m. This was not very promising for a landing on a
hostile beach, but the fact that boats were being taken away for
other purposes was partly responsible. We did it again on the
16th under better conditions and in better time. All hands had a
swim, and thought of the creaming combers of Coogec and Bondi.
Stripped, the men were splendid specimens—a credit to their training
and men to make Johnny Turk ponder! This experimental landing
was carried out as far as possible under conditions which could be
expected at the actual landing. Long strings of ships’ boats were
towed by naval steam pinnaces, sometimes as many as ten boats, all
packed with troops, being in one tow. The pinnaces were com-
manded by midshipmen—we were impressed by their efficiency and
by the way in which these youngsters exercised command. The
work of the Navy throughout was one of the outstanding features
of the Gallipoli campaign.
Wind and rain lashed us during the following week. It was
impossible to practise landings. By the 23rd the weather had
cleared again, and there was every evidence that a move was im-
minent. We received a General Order containing the famous address
from Sir lan Hamilton, which began, “Soldiers of France and of
the King,” and described the proposed attack on the Peninsula as
“an adventure unprecedented in modern war.” That didn’t trouble
us much at the time; we were more concerned with the desire to be
doing something. We were heartily sick of training and of being
cooped up on a troopship. On the 23rd we received the King’s
message wishing us success, and on the 24th we moved out of Mudros
Harbor to the west side of the island, ready for the attack on the
following day.
Our arrangements for leaving the ship had been finalised. As
early as possible in the operations, three destroyers were to come
alongside: first two, one on each side, and, when they were clear, a
third. The troops to go in each destroyer were carefully selected.
The transport personnel and horses were to remain on board, and
also a hold party. We were to carry three days’ rations in packs and
an extra 150 rounds of ammunition. We were warned that there
would be a difficulty about getting more water; and General
Birdwood advised us to drink all we could before leaving the ship, as
after that our water bottles might be all we should have for a couple
of days. A lot of canvas water bags had been made for extra
supplies. We knew very little of the actual plans for the attack.
In fact, the whole thing seemed to be rather in the air, and so it
proved. We understood that the 3rd Brigade was to land from
Warships at about 4 a.m., and endeavour to rush the enemy positions
and hold on until the rest of the Division got ashore—and that was
about all.
1915—April.


CHAPTER FIVE.
THE LANDING.
a HUS was the stage set for the biggest drama of our lives.
At about midnight of April 24/25 those of us who
were awake felt the ship tremble slightly and move again.
Although orders were that no one was to stir until 5 a.m.,
many found it impossible to resist the temptation to go
on deck. In the silence the ship stole towards the west, a ribbon
of white behind her where the moonlight, soon to be shot with red,
splashed down through the darkness.
Hours passed. At about 4 a.m. the moon slipped below the
vague horizon. The dawn, in Kipling’s words, would soon “come
up like thunder.” A dark smudge in the distance —the Gallipoli
Peninsula—was slowly becoming more visible through the rising
light.
Crack! A rifle shot came from the beach at about 4.25. We
had been seen. Then a regular fusillade broke out. Daylight was
breaking greyly; the land grew more distinct. Suddenly an ear-
splitting roar came from the London, quite close to us. It startled
us. She was shelling the earthworks on Gaba Tepc. The thunder
of an historic dawn had begun. At 5 a.m. we were anchored some
two miles from the shore, waiting for the destroyers which were to
land us. The ship’s people started getting the horse punts and boats
over the side, but they seemed to us very slow about it.
Two destroyers came alongside at about 5.45. They had been
engaged in landing the 3rd Brigade and carried some wounded men.
We embarked on them according to plan, but were kept waiting for
the ship’s boats to be put into the water. At 7 o’clock the first
destroyer got away and stood in for the land. The Turks were alive
to the situation now. Bedlam had broken loose. The shattering
crash of bigger guns mingled with a vicious tattoo of rifle fire. The
water was lashed by_bullets and shells. Volcanoes of spray shot into
the air. The Turkish battery on Gaba Tepe was shelling all boats
which approached the land. Warships were shelling the battery.
It looked as if they were smashing it flat, but the effect of their fire
was remarkably small, for it kept up a steady bombardment.
1915—April.


Our destroyers had escaped the Turkish fire. When we were
near enough to the coast, we transferred ourselves to the ship’s boats
and rowed ashore, landing without much difficulty on what to
be known as Anzac Beach, and to the north of it. The Battalion
was then assembled just to the north of Anzac Beach, where the
northern point of the cove, Ari Burnu, sheltered us from the Gaba
Tepe fire. Several casualties had been suffered from shrapnel fire.
Here we waited for orders, while engineers of the 3rd Brigade were
engaged in forming a rough track up the hillside.
Our orders when they came were very vague. We were to
reinforce the firing line. After moving a hundred yards or two the
men found it impossible to do any good work with their packs on.
They were ordered to take them off, so the packs were laid down
in orderly rows. Very few of us ever saw them again, and a few
days afterwards a Turkish aeroplane mistook them for troops in
reserve, and they were thoroughly shelled from Anafarta.
It is difficult to give any coherent story of the doings of the
Ist Battalion during the first two or three days on the Peninsula, as
it was scattered in small units along almost the whole of the front.
A. Company was somewhere in advance of what was afterwards
known as the Pimple, and in the vicinity of Lone Pine; B. Company
was on the right of A. Company; C. Company between Wire Gully
and the Chess Board: and D. Company on the left, holding a line
from just above Fisherman’s Hut to Pope’s Hill. These positions,
however, are quite indefinite, since not one of the Companies then
remained as a unit, but each was split up into platoons, sections, or
even smaller formations, and these were inextricably mixed up with
men of other battalions.
The following extract from the recollections of one man of his
first day on the Peninsula conveys a graphic idea of what the fighting
Was like:
"Having landed waist-deep in water,” he says, “we made a
dump of our packs and reformed company in close column of
platoons. From this point we moved off up the hillside in file,
generally in single file. We carried, in addition to our ordinary
equipment, two extra bandoliers, a shovel, and half a sack of S.A.A.
This—plus a steep hill and a hot day—resulted in a fairly fagged
condition; ‘exhaustion’ would be the word for it, had it not been
for the excitement and the heavy months of training behind us.
"We advanced over several small hills in this way, and halted.
There was a little shrapnel. I thought it ineffectual stuff, with no
moral effect. In fact, I was quickly becoming contemptuous of it
until a man a yard away from me was hit. He explained forcibly
1915—April.


how it hurt, his arm being broken. My opinion .then changed
entirely, and I decided it was dangerous stuff, and wished the Turks
would stop. Rifle fire so far had not worried us much, most of it
being indirect and falling, making a sharp cracking explosion over
one’s head, a phenomenon we put down to ‘dum-dums’ (expansive
bullets).
“The next thing was an order: ‘Clear that ridge, boys,’
Obediently we trotted up the hill to find no one there. On we went,
tumbling up and down hillsides. The platoon had dwindled. Some
sections had advanced to different points, some were weary and rested
awhile. We were a party of about six. We got to the top of a
ridge and halted. Stragglers from different units joined us. By a
majority vote we all pushed on over irregular and broken country—
for hours it seemed. It was really a trick in the sound of the rifle
fire that led us on, the echoes making it seem that the firing Was
ahead of us. About 4 o’clock in the afternoon we halted on the
edge of another ridge. Leading away from this was a long, smooth
slope and at the foot of it, about 400 yards distant, we could see
the Turks. With no one near us, our flanks unprotected, we settled
down to a good, comfortable hour’s shooting. Occasionally a man
would claim a hit, but it was doubtful. The enemy’s fire was not
close, and they may never have seen us.
“When the sun was sinking we became thoughtful, and began
to think of communications and flanks, and patrols, and ambushes.
We considered it our duty to get into touch with others. So we
dropped back a ridge, and another, and then another, coming across
some sights very strange to our eyes. Men lying in curious positions:
rifles and equipment dropped anywhere—we wondered vaguely what
sort of a row the owners would get into at the next kit inspection.
*‘We collected water-bottles from those who needed them no
longer. A gruesome thing it was at first, but water, by then, was
our standard of wealth. Eventually we came across another body
of troops holding a ridge, and discovered they were more or less
linked up with others on the flanks.
“Darkness by this was setting in—exhaustion with it—but
there was no chance of letting this latter develop. It was a busy
night and a medley run riot. Bugles (really Turkish) blowing the
‘Cease fire’; messages, reports, rumours, information that the troops
in front were Indians. Then the news that such information was
false, alarms and false alarms of attacks, sudden panics, and so on
kept the rifles going all through the night, firing into the darkness
at nothing and keeping our pluck up.’’
Another account is extracted from the diary of an officer who
was wounded on the first day.
1915—April.


“From the beach we moved up a path over a steep bluff. We
went slowly, with stoppages, over the crest and down a Turkish
pathway, along a deep gully parallel to the sea (Monash Gully).
We went by rushes to sheltered spots up to Wire Gully, seeing the
mules of the Mountain Battery toiling up behind us. Here we
followed a path until we could see the sea again to the south and a
battleship close to shore. I led my platoon over the green bushes
on to a further ridge in skirmishing order. The climbing was rough
and the scrub sometimes thick: there were bramble-like bushes and
wild thyme. At the crest were Turkish trenches into which we got.
Now came shrapnel bursting with heavy thrashing of the bushes
round us, whistling in gusts down the valley, about four shells
coming at once. I then ordered ‘fix bayonets’ and advanced to the
next ridge. When we reached it, we found it was a level plateau
unoccupied by the enemy. This plateau (part of the ‘4OO Plateau’)
overlooked a valley running inland, beyond which was green flat
cultivated country —olive groves.
“I was moved from here by a senior officer of one of the Vic-
torian battalions to a point further to the left, where the Indian
Battery was. The battery was out of action, however, having been
knocked out by shrapnel. The officer in charge pointed out the
firing line, which was some hundred yards ahead, and I moved my
platoon up by rushes. I gathered my platoon together in a little
hollow and moved on again to a ridge overlooking a valley running
at right angles to the sea. There was a number of men here, but I
could not see any enemy, although, judging by the fire, they could
see us.
“I was considerably disgusted by this time, as everything seemed
to be hopelessly mixed up. At the head of the valley on my left I
could see one of our machine-guns, and across the valley the way
I was facing was a trench at right angles to me manned by our men.
I think the position we were now in was the Lone Pine Ridge—the
valley facing me was Owen’s Gully.
“I could not find the Turkish position, but they had our range
with a machine-gun which was traversing the ridge. I felt a sharp
'whack’ on my hand and was surprised to see my middle finger bent
and a bullet sticking through. A bit later I felt the same sort of
‘whack’ on my foot. I seemed to be the only officer in this part
of the line, but it was difficult to make oneself heard, and the men
seemed to be suffering from a paralysing inertia.
“About sunset one of our aeroplanes passed overhead, and
shortly after the Navy began bombarding the ridge on the skyline
opposite us. As night fell the firing lessened, but rifle fire still came
in bursts.
1915—April.


“I got up and hobbled along, trying to make for the beach.
Wounded men lying in hollows and among the bushes called to me
to get them back, but I could do nothing for them. Coming to
where there was a line of our men in a shallow trench I expected to
be challenged, but was greeted cheerfully by name. They put me
on my way to the beach. I soon got off the path, and could only
go a few paces and then had to rest. Presently I found that I was
very thirsty, but I could not get at my water-bottle owing to my
damaged hand. Then an ambulance man got hold of me and took
me to the beach. It was very busy; there was now a pontoon jetty
made with casks, with small craft busy about it. My guide took
me through a crowd of bandaged wounded, sitting patiently near
the water, and then into a queue of men limping and being helped
like myself to the jetty. A business-like doctor, when he saw that
I was not seriously wounded, dismissed me promptly to a naval
cutter laden with wounded just about to leave for a ship.
“The lap of the waves and the smell of the sea were infinitely
soothing. The battle on shore was separated from this little cove
by the high bluffs. Out at sea were the transports, brilliant with
lights like a peaceful roadside. The beach and the sea under these
conditions made me feel incredibly fortunate in my lot after my
experiences of the day.
“A piquet boat in charge of a young midshipman came and
took us away, put us alongside a trawler, and left us there. We
stayed there a long time, and finally the trawler got under way and
took us alongside a steamer brilliantly lighted. She seemed very
homelike and desirable, and we were taken aboard. My wounds
were treated with iodine and bandaged up, and I was put to bed.
The change from the hammering clamor of battle to the luxurious
appointments and peacefulness of this German liner was too much
for me, and I went to sleep.”
1915—April.


CHAPTER SIX.
AT ANZAC.
N April 26 the Battalion was still scattered along
most of the front, although by the evening about
300 stragglers had been collected. These spent the
night in Shrapnel Gully, just below its junction
with Monash Valley. Capt. Thompson, the M. 0., had
established an aid post near here, and had a large collection of
wounded whom he was unable to move to the beach. He spent his
spare time adventuring alone up and down small tributary gullies,
and must have collected at least a dozen wounded who had been
overlooked by the stretcher-bearers. Capt. Christian, the Q.M.,
established a depot near here, and fed everyone who came along. He
did excellent work in this way, as arrangements for food were very
primitive at this time. During the 27th and 28th such men as had
been collected were used as supports for the firing line, and small
parties were sent up to reinforce where required.
On the 29th orders were received to assemble the Battalion on
the beach to reorganize, and every effort was made to muster the
scattered troops. The place chosen for assembly lay at the northern
end of Brighton Beach, just south of Hell Spit. Later experience
proved this to be a most unhealthy spot, but strangely enough we
suffered no casualties there. The men bathed and slept, and on the
morning of the 30th a muster parade was held, and the casualties
ascertained with more or less accuracy.
The Battalion had landed with a strength of 30 officers and
942 other ranks, and the following was the number of killed,
wounded and missing from April 25 to 29 inclusive;
Killed: 3 officers, 33 others.
Wounded: 15 officers, 248 others.
Missing: 67 others.
Total: 366.
The honours gained by members of the Battalion during these
days were:
Lieut. A. J. Shout, awarded Military Cross for showing con-
spicuous courage and ability in organising and leading his men in a

expose himself to locate the enemy, and led a bayonet charge at a
critical moment.

playing the greatest coolness and pluck in running round under heavy
fire and collecting stragglers, whom he formed and led into the firing

At about 5 p.m. on May I the Battalion received orders to
prepare to move at very short notice, and a quarter of an hour later
we were making up towards Shrapnel Gully. Orders then came that
a battalion of marines was to be relieved. This was completed soon
1915—April-May.


after midnight. Two companies relieved in a maze of trenches just
north of Wire Gully: the other two took over the line at the Bluff,
south of Courtney’s Post. There was no communication between
the Bluff trenches and those immediately to the south, which were
occupied by two companies of the 4th Battalion. These men
separated the two halves of the Ist Battalion, whose H.Q.'s were at
the Bluff,
The rest of the night was occupied in deepening and straight-
ening trenches. The approach to the Bluff was so steep that the men
had to pull themselves up by ropes. There was a narrow goat track
just below the crest, five yards beyond which were the trenches,
approached by two communication trenches.
The next few days were spent digging in. Opposite the Bluff
an enemy trench was only 30 yards away. This was named “German
Officers’ Trench” because two German officers had been seen in it.
Sniping was persistent and deadly from this trench, and our men
were frequently picked off through the loopholes. The introduction
of the periscope rifle, however, gave us a superiority hitherto held
by the Turk. By May 11 we had completed the communication
trenches to our right, and had our trenches at the Bluff in order.
Those on the right, however, were still in a very unsatisfactory con-
dition, as a perfect maze of small trenches, dug during the first week,
were open to enfilade fire. A great shortage of sandbags added to
our troubles.
On the following day Colonel Dobbin, who had been ill for
some days, was evacuated. Major Kindon took over the command
of the Battalion.
On May 14 the Battalion was consolidated, the two com-
panies on the right exchanging places with the two companies of
the 4th, which had previously separated our two halves. On 17th
and 18th we had our first experience of big shells: the enemy opening
on us with 8-inch high explosives. The men christened these shells
“Mother Kirbys” (after the well-known Sydney undertakers), be-
cause “they kill you first and bury you afterwards.” On the 18th
they made two direct hits on our trenches, killing two men on each
occasion. We received information that the enemy would probably
attack in force on the 19th, and therefore stood to arms an hour
earlier than usual.
On May 19, as was anticipated, the enemy attacked in great
force at 3 a.m., before daybreak. Fortunately we were forewarned
and forearmed, and at the Bluff the Turk was met by three tiers of
fire. The attack completely failed, only three Turks reaching our
trenches. One, who was very badly wounded, struggled up with
1915—May.


our wire twisted round his neck, and reached the parapet, where he
died. The front of our lines was thick with enemy dead. Our
casualties were one officer and 17 others killed; 34 others wounded.
On May 20, 15 wounded Turks came into our lines, and it
was seen that there were some more in a small trench at right-angles
to our front. Lieut.-Colonel R. H. Owen, of the 3rd Battalion, who
was then acting as Brigadier, gave instructions that the Red Cross
flag was to be flown so that these Turks could be collected. This
was done at 3.30 p.m., but the enemy fired on it. Two bullets hit
the staff. But at about 5.30 p.m. the enemy showed the Red Crescent
flag, and fire ceased. Two more wounded Turks came into our lines,
and a Turkish stretcher-bearer left an enemy trench and advanced
towards us. While we were waiting for an interpreter, he tried to
explain that he wanted to collect wounded by saying, “Bomb!
Bomb!’’ and making signs indicating wounds. Two or three more
Turks came out of their trenches. General Walker, who was then
commanding the Division, accompanied by Major Glasfurd and one
or two others, went out to meet them between the lines.
It was arranged by the General that letters should be exchanged
between the Commanders at 8 o’clock that night at the same place,
with a view of arranging an armistice to collect wounded and bury
the dead. At 8 p.m. Major Glasfurd, with an interpreter from H.Q.,
waited in vain for a message. As the firing was heavier than ever,
it was evident that it was not the Turks’ intention to send a
messenger.
On May 23 Colonel Dobbin resumed command of the Battalion.
On the next day there was an armistice for the burial of the dead.
The arrangement was as follows: An imaginary line was marked
by men with white arm bands half way between our trenches and the
Turks’. Our burial parties were to bury all on our side of this line,
and vice versa. We selected our biggest men for the job, so as to
impress the enemy. The armistice lasted from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.,
and over 200 dead Turks were collected from the front of our section
of the line. There were many rifles lying about, and a staff officer
ordered that they should be handed over to the Turks. Our men
did not like this at all, so took the precaution of removing the bolts
first. We buried the bolts behind the lines.
On May 25, from Battalion H.Q., we saw H.M.S. “Triumph’’
torpedoed at about 1 p.m. When she was struck she heeled over to
port, but opened fire with every gun that could be brought to bear.
Just before she capsized, men were seen lined up on the decks, and
then diving overboard. At the same time destroyers rushed towards
the crippled cruiser at full speed. She turned bottom upwards about
ten minutes after she was hit, and slowly sank.
1915—May.


Our 4th reinforcements arrived on May 26, and on the 30th
Major Davidson, promoted, handed over the Adjutancy to Lieut.
Wootten. Lieut.-Colonel Dobbin fell sick again, and was evacuated.
At 12.45 p.m. on the 30th a message was received asking for
all possible support to Quinn's Post, who were attacking at 1 p.m.
This was given, and our machine-guns did good work, one of them
engaging two enemy machine-guns and knocking one out. No. 74,
Pte. Arnott, who was No. 1 on this gun and was wounded, received
the D.C.M. for his good work. The official report runs: “For
conspicuous gallantry whilst serving in a machine-gun section.
Although engaged by two hostile machine-guns which demolished
the emplacement, Pte. Arnott served his gun whilst exposed to the
enemy’s fire until badly wounded. One hostile machine-gun was
destroyed.”
On June 4th instructions were received that a party of 10 men,
accompanied by 5 sappers with gun-cotton, was to be sent out that
night in an endeavour to surprise and destroy a machine-gun in
German Officers’ Trench, which was troubling the 4th Brigade.
Lieut. G. A. Street went out at about 10 p.m., but encountered a
trench occupied by the enemy in front of Courtney’s Post, and lying
between him and the machine-gun position. He returned and
reported that it was impossible to surprise the post. Orders came
from Divisional Headquarters that an attack was to be made before
moonrisc by 100 men, the machine-gun silenced, and as much damage
as possible done to the trench and the overhead cover. At the time
the order was received the moon was already up, though not visible
from Divisional Headquarters. Lieut. E. Longfield Lloyd was
detailed to lead the attack, with Lieut. H. Wells in charge of the
second line. After some delay caused by instructions having been
received to wait for engineers with gun-cotton, the attack was
launched at about 3 a.m. on June 5. The object was successfully
achieved. The Turks employed machine-gun fire, sweeping the front
of the trench. Casualties were five killed and 28 wounded. The
overhead cover was very heavy, and little could be done with it.
The machine-gun was destroyed by Lieut. Lloyd and No. 457
Lancc-Cpl. C. Davis. They found it impossible to get into the
trench at this point, but shot the crew through the emplacement.
The gun was then destroyed by firing into the mechanism with an
automatic pistol and a rifle. For his feat Lieut. Lloyd was awarded
the Military Cross, and Lancc-Cpl. Davis the D.C.M.
A reconnaissance consisting of two men under Sergeant Freame
was sent over to German Officers' Trench on June 6. They carried
out their work successfully, and on their return stopped to fix some
1915—May-June.


wire. One of the late reinforcements got scared and fired, hitting
the two men with one shot.
On the 9th we had our first indications of enemy mining. We
replied with counter-mining. On the 11th the Battalion was relieved
by the Bth Battalion and sent to Braund’s Hill for rest. We found
the word “rest” rather illusory, as we had to leave our machine-
guns in 3rd Battalion lines. Moreover, we found a permanent
working party of 200, and sent two companies into the supports
behind 2nd Battalion lines every night. On the 29th, however, the
illusion became reality. The Battalion, with the exception of the
Machine-gun Section and the working party, was sent to Imbros in
two mine-sweepers. When on the water we had one man hit by a
stray bullet and another bullet embedded itself in the butt of R.S.M.
Melville’s rifle. We reached Imbros at 2.30 a.m. on June 30, and
went under canvas for a real rest. The strength of the Battalion
at this time was 19 officers and 536 other ranks.
Anzac faded in the distance and it was a week before we returned
to those battle-scarred shores. At 2.45 a.m. on July 8 we disem-
barked again on Gallipoli soil, and moved up to Braund’s Hill. We
occupied trenches opposite Owen’s Gully, relieving the left company
of the 2nd Battalion and the right company of the 3rd Battalion.
The working party of 200 was still away, leaving the Battalion very
short-handed. Trenches needed a lot of work, but ration and water
fatigues were so heavy as to interfere with this. Several demon-
strations were carried out —the raising of cheers, burning of colored
lights, and so on, with a view to forcing the enemy to expend
ammunition—but with very little effect. On July 17 another 100
men were taken for digging new tunnels, leaving the Battalion very
weak. On the 19th Lieut.-Colonel Bennett, D. 5.0., assumed com-
mand, and the working party of 200 returned. Thenceforth we were
able to give more attention to our trenches.
From the 21st until the end of the month a big attack by the
Turks was daily expected, but it was not launched. In the meantime
we were preparing for an offensive of our own side. A tunnel had
been run round the front of the Pimple, traversed and recessed, and
requiring only the lid to be taken off to make it a fire trench level
with the ground. Sandbags were made ready, to be put up as head
cover. This was to be the jumping-off trench for our attack, enabling
us to emerge from the ground about 50 yards nearer to the Turk than
he expected to sec us.
On the last eve of July an enemy aeroplane dropped three bombs
and some darts near our cooking lines. In the scatter the dixies were
upset, an act that drew many reproaches upon the innocent and

slightly annoyed head of the Sgt.-cook (Murphy). On August 3
Lieut.-Colonel Dobbin returned, but as all arrangements for the pro-
jected attack were then complete, he did not take over the Battalion,
but was placed on other duty. Our sth Reinforcement arrived on
August 5, and our 6th on August 6. The battle of Lone Pine was
imminent.
1915—August.


CHAPTER SEVEN.
LONE PINE.
■HE assault on Lone Pine on the afternoon of August 6,
1915, takes its place as one of the most gallant Australian
adventures in the history of the ill-fated Gallipoli cam-
paign. It tested to the full the courage and the fighting
qualities of the city and country men who formed the
Ist Battalion.
It involved days and nights of slaughter; of fierce hand-to-hand
encounters: of men struggling through dark tunnels towards the
enemy; of inspired heroism as Turkish counter-attack after counter-
attack was flung back as violently as it was launched: of screaming
shells and blinding flashes: of nerve-racking nights and red dawns
shot with blood.
The Ist Battalion was formed in reserve in Browne’s Dip and
the trenches around it. Owing to ammunition shortage only half
an hour’s artillery barrage was possible. We moved into position at
2.30 p.m. and at 4 p.m. our big guns bombarded Lone Pine with
high explosives. At 5 p.m. they opened up again. The gullies were
loud with shattering explosions, for the enemy replied vigorously,
and we suffered numerous casualties before we started. The attack
was launched at 5.30 p.m., and at 5.40 A. Company went in. The
men had to struggle to get up the saps to the new jumping-off trench,
owing to the numbers of wounded coming back to the darkness in
the tunnels. At 6.20 B. Company went into the battle, followed
by D. Company half an hour later. The last of these were in Lone
Pine trenches by 7.45, and at 8 o’clock C. Company was there also.
During the night one sap was carried through to the captured Lone
Pine trenches, and the following day another one, so that there
was then covered communication between our old front line and the
captured position.
After fighting off heavy counter-attacks in the early morning,
the Battalion was withdrawn at 11.35 a.m. on August 7, and
remained out until 3 p.m., when it returned to meet further fierce
counter-attacks. These were beaten off, and the enemy’s effort
temporarily died down by 11.30 p.m. At 4.30 a.m. on the Bth the
Turkish attacks were resumed, but the pressure had lessened by
1915—August.


8 a.m.. and at 2 p.m. that day the Battalion was relieved by the 7th
Battalion. On the 9th we again reinforced Lone Pine, relieving the
3rd Battalion. Capt. Sasse and Capt. Shout worked down one of
the communication trenches towards the Turks and surprised and
shot a number of them. Later in the day Capt. Shout was severely
wounded while bombing Turks. Major Kindon also was severely
wounded. The day was spent in flinging back almost continuous
attacks and there were a number of casualties.
The official return of our losses for the three days was;—Killed,
one officer, 44 others; wounded, six officers, 283 others; missing,
27 others.
The following day, August 10, saw the Brigade firmly estab-
lished in Lone Pine trenches.
The official descriptions of decorations won by members of the
Ist Battalion at Lone Pine arc appended:—
“Capt. Alfred John Shout was awarded the V.C. for most con-
spicuous bravery at Lone Pine trenches on the morning of August 9,
1915. With a very small party, Capt. Shout charged down trenches
strongly occupied by the enemy, and personally threw four bombs
among them, killing eight and routing the remainder. In the after-
noon of the same day, from the position gained in the morning, he
captured a further length of trench under similar conditions, and
continued personally to bomb the enemy at close range under very
heavy fire until he was severely wounded, losing his right hand and
left eye.”
This most gallant officer has since succumbed to his injuries.
“No. 958, Pte. Leonard Keyzor, was awarded the V.C. for
most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty at Lone Pine trenches
on August 7, 1915. He was in a trench which was being heavily
bombed by the enemy. He picked up two live bombs and threw them
back at the enemy at great risk to his own life, and continued
throwing bombs, although himself wounded, thereby saving a
portion of the trench which it was most important to hold. On
August 8, at the same place, Pte. Keyzor successfully bombed the
enemy out of a position from which a temporary mastery over his
own trench had been obtained, and was again wounded. Although
marked for hospital he declined to leave, and volunteered to throw
bombs for another company which had lost its bomb-throwers. He
continued to bomb the enemy till the situation was relieved.”
“Capt. Cecil Duncan Sasse was awarded the D.S.O. for con-
spicuous gallantry and determination during the attack on Lone Pine
on August 6/7, 1915, when he led several bayonet charges on
1915—August.


trenches occupied by the enemy, resulting in substantial gains. Capt.
Sasse was wounded three times, but remained on duty.”
“No. 316, Lance-Cpl. J. Tallon, was awarded the D.C.M. for
conspicuous bravery on August 7, 1915, at Lone Pine. Throughout
several determined attacks by the enemy, Lance-Cpl. Tallon threw
bombs with great effect, exposing himself freely when necessary,
regardless of all personal danger. Finally his arm was blown off and
he was compelled to retire. His courage and devotion to duty gave
a fine example to all ranks with him.”
The following were mentioned in Sir lan Hamilton’s despatch
of September 22: —
Lieut.-Colonel A. J. Bennett, D.S.O.
Major W. Davidson.
Capt. H. Jacobs.
Capt. G. F. Wootten.
Lieut. J. B. Buchanan.
Lieut. P. L. Howell Price.
90 Sgt. A. E. Barber.
77 Cpl. C. A. Bint.
457 Lance-Cpl. C. Davis.
78 Pte. R. Gumming.
876 C.S.M. Sharpe.
August was a strenuous month for the Battalion. We were in
and out of the line at regular intervals. There were sudden sorties
and hard-fought counter-attacks, and our casualties continued to be
fairly heavy. On August 11 the Battalion was relieved by the 2nd,
but at various times during the next few days detachments were
sent to reinforce the line at Lone Pine, on the 13 th relieving the 7th
Battalion in No. 1 Section. Shelling by the enemy was very heavy
at times, and on one occasion they attacked with bombs, but were
repulsed. On the 15th the Battalion was relieved by the 7th, which
it again relieved from the 17th until the 19th. On the 20th
Lieut.-Colonel Dobbin returned to Alexandria. We again relieved
the 7th on August 21, and were in the line from the 21st to 23rd,
25th to 27th, and 29th to 31st.
On September 1 word was received of the promotion of Capt.
Sasse to Major (vice Major Davidson, died of wounds 19/8/’ls),
and of Lieut. Woodforde to Captain. The following also were
promoted to commissioned rank:—C.S.M. Morris, J. M.: Sgt.
McGregor, R. I. C.: Sgt. Beavis, H. W.: Cpl. Ramsay, R. T.: Sig.-
Sgt. Bruton, F. J.; Lance-Cpl. McKell, V.C.; Lance-Cpl. Parkes, C.
Reliefs continued in and out of the line until September 8,
when we were told to prepare to embark for a rest at Lemnos. This

news was easy to take, as the Battalion was feeling the effect of its
strenuous fighting. The Battalion left in two parties on different
nights, and went into a tented camp at West Mudros. During the
latter part of the holiday at Lemnos there were many evacuations
to hospital, including Lieut.-Col. Bennett and Capt. Woodforde, but
on the whole it was a pleasant time. On the 15th Capt. C. S. Colt-
man, of the 4th Battalion, took command. Owing to the heavy
rain the site of the camp was moved to higher ground. Training
was carried on in the mornings only, and thus all hands felt the
benefit of the rest from active warfare, the first for many months.
The stay at Lemnos lasted until October 27, when the Battalion
embarked on H.M.T. “Osmanieh,” though owing to rough weather
Lemnos was not left behind until the 29th. On reaching Anzac the
Battalion went to Clarke’s Valley and bivouacked there. The
strength was 14 officers and 411 other ranks. On the 30th we took
over Leane’s Trench, with three companies in the line and one in
reserve. It is recorded in a war diary that word was received from
the War Office on November 9 that gas was likely to be used on the
Peninsula.
On November 19 we experienced conditions that were to prevail
when we got to France later on. Wet weather set in. The trenches
were deep in mud, and things were generally uncomfortable. It was
impossible to get timber to put them in a proper state. All material
was at a premium at this period. During this month there was
occasional heavy shelling by the enemy. We carried out some
patrolling and general trench work, and winter dugouts and drains
were made in our trenches, and barb wire put out.
But we were not destined to face a winter on the Peninsula.
1915—Septembet-November,


CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE EVACUATION.
HURING August the British Cabinet had been aware
of the completeness of the Suvla failure, the first real
intimation being received when General Sir lan Hamilton
cabled that unless he got adequate reinforcements he must
shortly reduce the strength of his front line. This, an
admitted overstatement, was sent in reply to Kitchener’s telegram that
a forthcoming offensive in France would absorb all available troops.
Coupled with the fact that winter and attendant storms were nearing,
it forced Cabinet to realise that the decision must shortly be reached.
In October Bulgaria entered the war, and thus made a through passage
for German troops to the Peninsula.
Winter storms and German artillery would have made the
landing of stores at Anzac practically impossible. Then came two
opinions, both carrying great weight, and both based on personal
inspection, advocating withdrawal: one from General Sir Charles
Munro in October; and the other from Lord Kitchener in November,
Both were impressed by the shallowness of the positions.
The fate of the expedition was finally sealed on December 6 at
Paris, where an Allied Military Conference was held. Great Britain
being represented by Sir John French. It was here decided to
abandon totally the Peninsula and to support the Salonika expedition.
Next day General Birdwood (then in command of the Dardanelles
Army) received orders to evacuate Anzac and Suvla, but to retain
Helles for the time being.
The health of the troops who had been on Anzac for some
months was at this period so bad that it deserves mention, as never
again was the physical fitness of the men so low. The majority
were wasted and thin and suffering from shortness of breath and
diarrhoea. Lack of variety in food, unremitting toil and unceasing
strain of living constantly within gun range had undermined the
strongest constitutions. With the advent of winter the general
health improved slightly, but brought worse living conditions. On
November 28 the thermometer did not rise above freezing point, and
at night registered 7° of frost. Next day many of the Battalion saw
snow for the first time.
1915—November.


On November 29 a storm caused much damage to the jetties
and water lighters. As a result the water ration was reduced to two
pints per man per day, officially, but in reality in many cases did not
exceed two cupfuls per man. This meagre ration continued to the
end.
To increase these added discomforts, the enemy near the end of
the campaign started shelling with their new heavy artillery, German
8, 9 and 12 inch Howitzers being used. Fortunately the Battalion
did not suffer very much fire from these.
On November 23 the Chief of Staff, Colonel C. B. B. White,
received secret instructions from General Birdwood of the projected
evacuation. White, who subsequently drew up the entire plans for
the Anzac evacuation (which were followed by Suvla and Helles
commanders) saw that success could only be achieved by with-
drawing secretly. He foresaw the critical point would come when
our last troops had left the trenches and rifle fire ceased. The Turks
would immediately become suspicious, for evacuation was not
unthought of. It had been even publicly discussed in the House of
Lords on October 14.
Therefore, to accustom the enemy to periods of complete silence
and to teach him beforehand that cessation of fire did not necessarily
mean withdrawal, White ordered all firing to cease on November 25
and 26. The enemy was perplexed. He increased the number of
his night patrols and in many places sent over parties. One such
party, about 20 strong, came across the Battalion front at Leane’s
Trench, and on approaching the parapet threw bombs, but were
easily driven off by rifle fire, which was permissible only under such
circumstances. Our own men were not less puzzled by the silence,
the only reasons therefor being supplied by fertile and fickle rumour.
The period of silence was prolonged for a third day, till November
27 midnight, when the spell was broken by unusually active fire
from our lines. These silences were continued at intervals till the
last day, and were generally known as the “silent stunts.”
Afterwards it was learnt the enemy considered that the silence
was due to our wishing to make our winter quarters undisturbed,
as they themselves did.
The operation of evacuation was divided into three stages, of
Which the first was undertaken immediately. In this stage, garrisons
were reduced to the minimum numbers required for a purely defen-
sive winter campaign. This latter was the reason put forward by
White in orders for the withdrawal of all surplus men, concealment
of the true reason, even from our own side, being imperative for
success.
1915—November.


The second stage was started as soon as word was received that
the evacuation had been ordered, namely, December 7. In this stage
the force and material were reduced until there remained only a bare
sufficiency to enable the positions to be held for a week against attack.
It applied mainly to stores, artillery and troops in the rear, the front
line battalions still remaining intact. In the third, or final stage,
this diminished garrison was to be withdrawn with the greatest
possible speed, no special effort being made to save any further
material.
It was arranged for Suvla to withdraw simultaneously, other-
wise a flank would have been “left in the air,” the Suvla line being a
continuation of the Anzac trenches. The final garrison represented—
in skeleton—that which had been previously occupying it. For in-
stance, the Battalion was not reduced by evacuating two companies,
but by withdrawing a proportion from all four companies. This
meant that orders flowed smoothly through old and known channels.
The final stage was limited to two nights, on the first of which
half the front line garrison would leave in one party. The last night
differed from this procedure in that the remaining garrison was split
into three parties, “A,” ”B” and “C,” respectively. “C" party
was split up again into three, and called “C,” “C 2” and “C 3”
respectively.
On the last night the total strength on Anzac would be 10,000
men, who would be evacuated thus:—
“A” party, 4,000 strong, would start withdrawing at 5.15 p.m.
”B” party, 4,000 strong, would withdraw between 9 and 11
p.m.
“C” party, 2,000 strong, would withdraw between 1.30 and
3.25 a.m.
It followed that from 11 o’clock onwards the defence of Anzac
fell on 2,000 men, out of whom 275 men were supplied for defence
of the “Inner Line.” The “Inner Line” was a rearguard defence
established on a line, No. 1 Post—Walker’s Ridge—Plugg’s Plateau
—MacLagan’s Ridge, and which was to cover the retirement of the
last parties in case of attack.
Of these 275, 75 were supplied from all battalions of the Ist
Division, the Ist Battalion’s quota being under the command of
Lieut. P. L. Howell Price. Desire to be included in the “C” party
and the rearguard was very strong, particularly among the old hands,
who considered they had a right to stay to the last. Orders were
issued that only the fittest and most dependable men were to be
1915—December.


picked. The difficulty in choosing lay in the fact that seniority of
service and physical fitness seldom went together. Keenness for the
honour of being included in these parties was not dulled by current
opinion, which generally considered that the final night would be a
bloody one.
As soon as Brigade received orders for the evacuation, Brig.-
General Sir Nevill Smyth, V.C., and his staff constantly experi-
mented at night by marching men and officers of the last parties along
the tracks to be used to the beach on the final night. These marchings
were to ascertain the exact time of the journey (28 minutes from
Leane’s Trench to Milo Pier—the point of embarkation it was
found), to acquaint every man thoroughly of the appointed route,
and to discover any flaws in the scheme. Among many other things,
it was noticed that the boots of men marching over hard ground
made an appreciable noise, and so orders were issued that boots were
to be muffled by tying sandbags or socks over them. Hard surfaces
of trench bottoms and tracks were broken up with picks, wooden
jetties carpeted with sandbags and iron tram rails torn up. Parties
were even instructed not to walk in step lest the rhythm of falling
feet be overheard.
Special tracks to the beach were selected out of sight of Gaba
Tepe where possible, and at the junction of routes were placed
distinguishing lights. On the Battalion route there were three points
thus indicated;
Point X, showing a white light in a biscuit box.
Point Y, showing a green light in a biscuit box.
Point Z, showing a red light in a biscuit box.
At these points were stationed officers, who checked off each
party by its special tally as it passed.
There were many ingenious devices invented whereby rifles were
fired automatically after the last troops had left the line.
One method was that of a candle and string and a weight
attached to the trigger. On the candle burning to a certain distance
the string was burnt, thereby releasing the weight. Another was by
the overbalancing of a tin on it being filled with water slowly drip-
ping into it. This overbalancing would dislodge a weight attached to
the trigger. During the last week every action was tested by the
rule of normality. Too much activity was as noticeable as too little.
When the back areas became uncannily deserted, men were told
off to ‘‘obviously loaf and smoke” on the tracks in view of Gaba Tepe
—a task not welcomed at this stage, though previously it would have
1915—December.


been joyfully accepted—for, though such an action usually drew
gun-fire, it meant no fatigues. Cooking fires were kept going in places
where now no troops were, and the removal and destruction of stores
and materials was so arranged that frameworks and skeletons of
dumps, etc., were still left intact to the view of aeroplane and distant
observers.
Shovelfuls of earth were thrown on the parapets to keep up a
semblance of digging. The natural destructiveness of many found
surfeit at this period. One form of alleged humour was to prick a
minute hole in food tins and replace them in their cases. Rumour
ran that the whole division had to be ransacked to find a teetotal
officer and fatigue party to destroy the ordnance rum stores.
But behind any fun which the men made (under all conditions
and at all times) lay a very deep regret at leaving their fallen mates
behind. Dislike of the idea of leaving hard-won Anzac and gladness
to be quit of a stalemate situation were fairly evenly divided, and a
prejudice in cither direction was governed by each man's character.
The total strength on Anzac on December 18 was approxi-
mately 20,000 troops, 10,000 of whom were safely embarked on the
night of 18/19th, the Battalion's quota (equal to half its reduced
strength) leaving at 5.15 p.m. The night’s programme was carried
out with great exactness. The last day, the 19th, found a still
unsuspicious enemy.
Short periods of silence, which had at first evoked heavy fire
from the Turk, now hardly roused him.
The usual number of periscopes had to be displayed by the
depleted garrison, also the normal rate of fire had to be maintained.
As usual, the day was spent in destroying gear of all kinds, blankets
however being taken away by the earlier parties. At 5.15 p.m. “A”
party moved off, carrying the packs of the "C" party men, who were
thus left unencumbered.
Instructions now were that evacuation was to be carried out
according to plan, even though the enemy attacked, and once a party
had been ordered to leave the trench it was not to be turned back
except by order of the Rearguard Commander.
“B” party started at 9 p.m., and was all clear by 11 p.m. A
period of greater tension was started, for they had taken with them
all but about three of the machine-guns, and the whole of the Anzac
line was now held by 1,500 men, or one man to every seven or
eight yards.
More than ever, success now lay in keeping up an appearance
of normality. To do this, men moved up and down the line of
1915—December.


loop holes, firing out of each and occasionally throwing bombs.
This activity had to be maintained for the next four and a half
hours. Every 15 minutes situation reports from party commanders
were sent to Battalion H.Q.
At 1.30 a.m. (December 20) the tension increased, for from
this hour the whole of the Suvla front and a gradually increasing
portion of the Anzac line became vacant. Soon all the northern
sectors were evacuated and from all points of the line came swiftly-
moving bodies of men silently converging on the beach.
“C” and “C 2” parties left the trenches, each about 30 strong,
“C 3” party, also of 30 men, now redoubling their efforts in manning
the loopholes. At 2.50 a.m. “C 3” party fired its last shot and
departed, leaving Leane’s Trench lifeless. All parties of the Battalion
were embarked on lighters at Milo Pier (North Beach) without
incident, without confusion and without noise.
At 3.14 the last Anzac sector to be deserted, Russell's Top, was
abandoned, at 3.25 the last man on the inner line defence retired,
and at 3.30 the whole of the famous hills were empty.
At this time several mines in the line were fired from Walker’s
Ridge. The explosions roused the enemy to a sharp burst of fire,
which gradually spread right along his whole front. At 4.10 the
last soul ashore embarked (Colonel Paton, who had charge of the
final operations on shore).
The only Anzac casualties were two men wounded by stray
bullets.
The Turks’ discovery of the evacuation was brought about by
mine explosions. On moving forward to occupy the craters it was
found the trenches were empty, but it was not till 6.40 a.m., when
the last of the transports was out of sight, that an advance of their
line was ordered.
The various parties disembarked at Lemnos Island and reported
at Sarpi Camp, Mudros West, and there rested for three days. On
December 23 the Ist and 2nd Battalions embarked on H.M.T.
“Hunt’s Green,” and, with only three days’ rations aboard, sailed
for Alexandria, where they arrived on the 27th. Disembarkation
was carried out next day, and the battalions entrained for Tel-el-
Kcbir, where we bivouacked until tents were available, and went
through a period of rest and training.
Shortly after arrival the popular C. 0., Major C. S. Coltman,
died of illness, and the command was taken over by Major J. Heane,
of the 4th Battalion.
1915—December.


CHAPTER NINE.
REORGANISATION IN EGYPT AND THE
MOVE TO FRANCE.
■JHE BATTALION spent January, 1916, at Tel-el-Kebir.
® where the critical days on the Peninsula soon became only
a a nightmare. Life was more pleasant. Training and
m reorganisation were taking place. Leave to Cairo was
al given to all ranks, and the troops took full advantage of
it, pitting their cunning against the age-old cunning of the East,
and generally outwitting the Gippo! There was a lot of souveniring,
and a lot of Australian pranks were perpetrated in the ancient city.
The Battalion soon showed the benefit of the re-fitting and rest.
Early in February orders came that new battalions were to be
formed from the old “veteran” battalions, the officers and other
ranks being equally divided between old and new battalions. The
sister battalion of the Ist was the 53rd. The reorganisation took
place on February 13, the new battalion moving to a new site. There
was much regret among those selected to go to the new battalion
at leaving their old comrades behind and giving up their colours, but
it cheered them to know that the sister battalion was to wear the
same colours vertically instead of horizontally. Old rifles were given
in and Mark 111 converted issued in exchange.
On February 29 the Brigade moved to Serapeum on the Suez
Canal. The Ist Battalion remained there for about three weeks in
a tented camp on the everlasting sands. Various duties were carried
out, including outpost duties in the desert. The Canal was used by
the men as a substitute for Bondi and Coogee. Some dust storms
were experienced—in fact, life was mostly full of fine, white sand
which got into everything, including the food. Shortage of water
made things uncomfortable, also. On March 19 H.R.H. the Prince
of Wales, with Lieut.-General Birdwood, attended the 3rd Brigade
church parade, and afterwards rode through the lines of all the
battalions.
It was evident now that the Battalion would soon be leaving
for France, and on or about March 21 our faces were again turned
towards the fighting line. We entrained for Alexandria and embarked
1916—January-March.


on H.M.T. Ivernia. The trip across the Mediterranean was without
much incident. Orders were given that life-belts had to be worn
night and day, owing to the menace of enemy submarines. No lights
were allowed on the ship at night. A mild sensation was caused
when the transport suddenly veered from her course and headed for
Toulon instead of Marseilles. We heard rumours of another trans-
port being torpedoed ahead of us. The Ivernia stayed in Toulon
for a night, then made a quick dash to Marseilles, arriving there in the
fading light of the following day.
That night the Battalion landed for the first time on French
soil. There were few people about, but the troops will remember
one vivid figure as we marched through the town for the train. He
was a French sentry in traditional red trousers and blue blouse, with
a bayoneted rifle, who saluted us as we streamed by. He looked for
all the world like a character from "Under Two Flags."
The Battalion entrained at midnight for the journey up the
Valley of the Rhone. We were accommodated in third-class wooden
carriages, and although it was not luxurious travelling it could have
been worse, and later we were to know the ignominy of being herded
in cattle trucks. We had breakfast at Orange, and for the next two
or three days had plenty of opportunity to feast our eyes on the
greening fields of springtime France, so restful after the pitiless white
sands of Egypt. The train had a kind of roving commission. It
stopped at extraordinary places and appeared to set off again whenever
the spirit moved it. "Ragtime!” the men called it. The Rhone
Valley was a fine picture with white-capped mountains in the back-
ground. The nights were bitterly cold, however, and in the
mornings the ground was stiff with heavy frosts. All along the
route were women in black toiling in the fields. They cheered us as
we passed and pointed to their battle-scarred country up north,
making gesticulations of throat-cutting—a compliment intended for
their arch-enemies, the Germans.
The train passed within sight of Paris—in the far distance we
saw the Eiffel Tower quite plainly—and at last rid itself of us
somewhere near Hazebrouck. The first march on rustic French
cobble-stones was a striking contrast to the marches over the desert.
In our billets at Wallon Cappel we heard for the first time the dull,
distant rumble of big guns. Everyone relished the new conditions,
but it was not long before serious work was to begin. On April 10
the Brigade moved to the Outtersteene area. Small parties of officers
and other ranks visited the front line, which was to be taken over.
On the 14th two platoons were sent to the front line for instructional
purposes, and on succeeding days other platoons were sent to the line.
1916—March-Apiil.


On the 18th the Brigade marched to the Sailly area, and on the
19th the Battalion took over its section of trench, with Headquarters
at Rifle Villa. It was the Petition Sector, near where the Laies River
passed through the front line. The trenches were different from
those of the Peninsula. They were not trenches in the strict sense
of the word, but merely breastworks made of sandbags piled one on
top of the other to a height of six or eight feet, with a thickness
of about six feet. There was too much water near the surface to
dig proper trenches. This part of the line had remained in the same
place since the very early days of the war. Every inch of ground
was known to the enemy and well marked down by artillery of
both sides. The tactical position was such that a gain of ground
held no great advantage to either side—it held no key to important
positions in the rear. For these reasons this area was treated as a
nursery in which to train new units, which explained our presence
there. The area was also said to be the original scene from which
many of Bairnsfather’s “Fragments From France” were drawn—
those pictures which appeared in the “Bystander” during the war,
and showed so humorously and yet so truly conditions prevailing
in the trenches.
It is unnecessary to describe the routine of trench life. Patrols
which were sent out regularly at night saw the most exciting part.
Little activity was possible by day in any direction. Supplies of all
kinds were good, and mails and papers arrived daily. The waggons
bringing them could not penetrate closer than about a mile from the
line: thence they were transported by tramways and by man-power.
A good deal of mining was carried out in this area, and No Man's
Land was full of craters—“better ’oles” of Bairnsfather’s!
The Battalion’s tour of duty ended on May 3, when it was
relieved by the 3rd, and went into support. While in support the
billets were heavily shelled on various occasions, but without much
loss of life. Trenches were made near the billets so that the troops
could retire when shelling began. The Brigade moved into reserve
round Sailly on May 18, where training was carried out. Leave to
England began at the end of April and from then on, with short
lapses, continued until the Armistice.
On June 1 the Brigade assembled in an orchard a mile or so
from Sailly and was visited by Mr. W. M. (“Billy”) Hughes, then
Prime Minister of Australia, who gave a short address. The Brigade
went into the line again on June 10. The Ist Battalion took over
the right sector of the line, near La Boutillcrie. On June 19 we
heard that gas had been sent over by the enemy further north, with
serious casualties. There had been gas over our own lines on the
17th as far as Sailly and Estaires, but it only caused inconvenience
1916—April-June.


coupled with fear, especially to those returning from leave, who had
failed to carry out orders regarding the carrying of gas masks. The
Battalion was relieved on June 23.
On the night of June 27 a successful raid was made by a
specially trained party under Capt. Phillip Howell-Price. Two
prisoners were captured, and about 15 enemy killed. Casualties
among the party were one killed and nine wounded. The party had
been taken out of the line beforehand to practise their training on
trenches modelled on those to be raided. The strength was five
officers and about 60 other ranks. There were four groups consisting
of two trench parties of an officer and seven others, a supporting group
and another group in reserve. A heavy “box” barrage was laid down
by our artillery on the portion of enemy trench to be raided, cutting
if off from support. Difficulty was experienced in getting through
the enemy’s wire, which appeared to be untouched, or almost so,
by our previous fire.
The following decorations were awarded for work in the raid:
Capt. P, L. Howell-Price, D. 5.0.; 2nd Lieut. B. G. Littler and
2nd Lieut. H. H. Moffat, M.C.'s; L/Cpl. L. G. Spinks, Sgt.
G. E. Wells, L/Cpl. T. R. Wilkinson, Military Medals.
The strength of the Battalion at this time was 27 officers and
990 other ranks.
On July 4 the Battalion was relieved by the 48th and went
into billets north of Sailly until July 9, when the Brigade moved to
Outtersteene, leaving there the next day and entraining from Bailleul
for Can das.
1916—June-July.


CHAPTER TEN.
POZIERES.
HHE mind of every Australian is stirred to proud and
sombre memories by the name Pozieres. Few who took
part in the Great War can hear without some sort of
emotion the mention of the insignificant but now famous
mud village of Picardy, where so many laid down their
lives in the fierce attacks that marked the capture of that important
tactical point.
And to members of the Ist Battalion, Pozieres has an especially
poignant appeal. The battle that takes its name from that straggling
main street was the first big operation in which the Battalion was
engaged in France, and was in many respects the most fiery ordeal
that the members knew, while probably in no other action were Ist
Battalion casualties so severe.
In the summer of 1916 the Battalion, under the command of
Lt.-Col. J. Heane, D. 5.0., had reached a high standard of efficiency
and discipline. The losses of the Peninsula had been made good, and
the reinforcements had been knocked into shape and had received
their baptism of fire at Fleurbaix. So when the Battalion entrained
at Bailleul on July 10 for the Somme, it was ready for all emer-
gencies. And it was not long before it was called upon to show its
mettle. In common with the rest of the Ist Australian Division, it
was to play no small part in the great Somme offensive that started
on July 1, 1916. It was a stupendous battle, but only the part
played by the Battalion can be dealt with here.
The train which left Bailleul on July 10 reached Candas at
10.30 next morning, where the men detrained and marched to
Domart. Leaving there on July 12, the Battalion marched round
to Vignacourt and then to Allonville, reaching billets at 5.30 p.m.
Here there was a dispute between D Coy. and A Coy. of the
4th Battalion, and the Sectional Commander had to go and turn
out the 4th Battalion men.
Colonel Heane, with Lieut. Somerset and the other C.O.’s,
left on July 15 for an inspection of the old German line near
Fricourt, where they overlooked the trenches lately captured by the
1916—July.


British, and the attack was explained to them; and on Sunday, July
16, Major Lindcman and Capt. A. K. Mackenzie made the same
inspection, while the Brigade moved off at 9.45 a.m., marching to
Warloy, where we were billeted. Here a conference of C.O.’s with
the Brigadier was held, and General Smyth complimented the
Battalion on its marching. On July 17 the front line was also
visited by Capt. Howell-Price and Capt. Mackenzie.
Pozieres itself was a small village some two and a half miles
from Albert, along the Bapaume Road, and was one of the strongest
points of the German defence. It had already been attacked by the
British troops without success. The village, similar to most French
villages in that area, had one straggling street, and had been very
strongly fortified. Our actual entry into the battle was on the night
of July 19-20, when we took over the front line from the 12th
Durham Light Infantry. The relief was carried out in dense
darkness, and was completed about 2 in the morning, the whole
operation being harrassed by a continuous gas shelling, from which
we suffered many casualties. Among others Lt. Everett was wounded
and died while being taken to the dressing station.
The trenches we found to be exceedingly poor. They had been
adapted to the requirements of the smaller men of the English
regiment, the firing steps, for example, being much too high for the
Australians, while all the trenches were narrow and deep, and not
connected up. Our C.O. and the Durham Colonel were forced to get
out on the top every now and then, and were fiercely sniped at by
the enemy 250 yards away, so that both did some fine sprint
championship training.
To take over the relief, the Brigade left Warloy at 4.15 p.m.,
and were met by guides at British Brigade Headquarters, where our
men were taken—A and B to the front line, and C and D in close
support round Casualty Corner. An attack had been planned for
the 20th, but was postponed in favour of a bigger offensive on
July 22.
We were told that the capture of Pozieres was a necessary part
of the operations which aimed at wresting Thiepval from the
Germans, who, on their part, recognised its extreme strategic impor-
tance; so that the struggle, we knew, would be keen. This was
soon proved in no uncertain fashion, for as C and D Companies
came into position a rain of gas shells came over. This, we at first
thought, was only tear gas, but we were soon painfully aware of
its asphyxiating character, our throats being badly affected, and gas
masks were hurriedly donned.
1916—July.


Among our casualties, in addition to poor Everett, our
Adjutant. Lt. White and Lt. Graham had to be evacuated with about
30 men, and both the C.O. and the Brigade were sadly handicapped
by the loss of the Adjutant in this, the first big engagement in France.
In preparation for the attack of July 22, no stone was left
unturned to perfect arrangements, and on the night of July 21 the
C.O.’s of the Brigade, with the Brigadier, met at the Colonel’s
headquarters and the plans were discussed in full. The decision was
that the Ist and 2nd Battalions were to take the first two lines, and
the 3rd and 4th Battalions the third. The 3rd Brigade was to attack
on our right, and the British on the left. Working parties were sent
out this night, and two communication trenches were dug towards
the enemy, while the 3rd Battalion dug a communication trench
back from our lines, and another behind us to place their men ready
for the attack.
All day on Saturday the company commanders were with the
Colonel, while every unit was busy preparing for the onslaught.
Ammunition, bombs, stores and water were sent up to the front
line, with sufficient extra to be sent on after the attack had been
successful. And all day long the enemy shelled us, a proceeding
which resulted in one of the saddest events of that period, the death
of Major Lindeman.
Divisional orders were that a proportion of officers had to be
sent back, so as to leave some to spare to replace casualties after the
attack. Those selected were Major Lindeman, Capt. Beavis and
Lieuts, McGregor, McShane and Mclntyre. Each was seething with
indignation at being left out of the stunt; but orders were orders,
and the Major contented himself with growling and calling himself
“O.C. Cold-footed Brigade.” His well-known enthusiasm really
was the direct cause of his death. He remained to sec that the two
support companies got away after dark for the front line, to which
the C.O. had gone in the afternoon. At Casualty Corner, with the
Transport Officer, Lieut. Yeomans, he was caught by a shell. Lieut.
Yeomans was killed at once, and the Major was so badly wounded
that he died on arrival at the ambulance.
This was a deep shock to the Battalion and a grave loss to
us all. Major Lindeman, since coming to be second in command,
had endeared himself to all his fellow-officers and to each man in
the Battalion by his sterling qualities as a soldier, and many who
read this will spare a kindly thought of remembrance for that
splendid man.
Night came, and with it the battle that will ever live in
memory. Zero had been fixed for half an hour after midnight, and
1916—July.


at 11.45 A and B Companies left our front trenches and took up
a position that had been selected by patrols in No Man’s Land. To
permit of identification in the dark, each man wore his sleeves rolled
up to the elbows, and A and B Companies wore white strips of cloth,
six inches by one inch, on the back of the right shoulder, the
remaining companies wearing a corresponding strip of blue.
A and B were to take the first objective, and after they had
occupied it, the other companies were to pass through them and get
as close as possible to the second objective, and to rush it as the
barrage lifted. As soon as the ground was clear, C and D Companies
followed A and B into No Man’s Land.
At 12.28, with a crash as if the Heavens had fallen, the British
barrage commenced. Amid that deafening thunder of guns, with
blinding sheets of flame, verbal orders became impossible. For two
minutes the inferno lasted, while our officers, watches in hand,
trusting implicitly in the mathematical accuracy of the artillery,
moved their platoons forward by gestures and whistle commands.
As the hurricane of bombardment fell on the German lines, the
men crept as close to the falling shells as they could, following with
such spirit and courage that we suffered casualties from our own
artillery fire, rather than let the enemy come out of the dug-outs after
the barrage had ceased.
The task of the Australians was indeed difficult. They had to
move forward in darkness, fitfully broken by the curtain of shell fire
slowly creeping ahead of them, over ground rendered almost
impassable in places by the innumerable shell-holes, trenches, barbed
wire and the debris of ruined buildings. The first wave recognised,
without much difficulty, its objective, Pozieres trench, which protected
the village on the south. The broken ground, however, had led to
some of the men getting mixed up, and men of all companies had
a share in the capture of the Pozieres trench.
Several hundred Germans were found here, but there was very
little actual fighting, the artillery having done its work well. On
the right a party of Germans came out with a quick-firer and met
our men in No Man's Land, but were quickly dealt with, and those
in the trench were too dazed to offer much resistance. A few met
swift death from the bayonet, but the majority were sent back to
the Provost Marshal at Albert, under escort. Lieut. Burstall sent
word that the trenches on the right had been taken. No sooner had
the objective been captured than all hands set to work to consolidate
the position. Lieut.-Col. Heanc came up, and our men were
reorganised to a certain extent, while the artillery barrage played on
the second objective.
1916—July.


The reorganising in that hell of flame, noise and bursting shell
was no easy task. Lieut.-Col. Heanc, with the signallers, established
Headquarters in the trench. The position was by no means preten-
tious, being a mere hole scooped out of the side of the trench; but
our men had been trained for such an emergency, and the C.O. had
but one thought: to be in a position where he could direct operations
and send back accurate reports to the Brigade. In the early stages
of the attack, signal communication from the forward companies
had been practically impossible, and, owing to casualties among the
runners and the difficulty of finding one’s way in the general
confusion, reports concerning the progress of the attack had been
very meagre. Our men formed up partially along a broken and
torn-up light railway, and as the barrage moved onward they
followed it. There was still a mixture of all companies, however,
for in those early days in France enthusiasm outran discretion, and
not yet had our men learned that an order must be obeyed in minute
detail. How dearly many paid for that youthful rushing into the
fray, we all too sadly know.
And here a word should be said of those splendid soldiers, the
engineers and pioneers, who co-operated with the infantry. They
followed close upon the footsteps of the attackers, and were busily
digging communication trenches and building strong points as soon
as the positions were carried. Too little attention has been paid, in
descriptions of the glory of a direct attack, to the men who made it
possible to hold the vantage points won.
After passing through the first objective, the second wave moved
up as close as possible under the barrage, which had by this time
moved its slow and devastating way beyond the south-eastern edge
of the village. The second objective was practically non-existent, and
a shallow disused trench that followed the line of a broken hedge
was utilised. For two tremendous minutes the British guns poured
their hurricane of shells on this objective, and almost blinded by the
dust, choked by the acrid fumes, and dazzled by the glare of the
bursting shells, the second line awaited the moment to move. It
came, and with bayonets fixed and bombs in hand, the men of C and
D Companies groped their painful way towards the German trench.
On the left, D Company made contact with the 2nd Battalion. The
objective itself was almost unrecognisable. The artillery fire had
blotted the trench out, and the shallow trench, which was used as
the starting point of a new line, was practically only a ditch under
the broken hedge.
As has been mentioned, there were the twisted remains of a
trench railway that had been used by the Germans to convey
ammunition, curving past the south-eastern edge of Poziercs to
1916—July.

where it fed three guns. The capture of these three was credited to
the Ist, 3rd and 11th Battalions. It was along, and just beyond,
this tramway that the second wave established itselt.
The 3rd Battalion, which had passed through the Ist, captured
the third objective at about a quarter to two in the morning.
Two companies accomplished the work, the objective being
simply a line running down the main street of Pozieres, so that
trenches had to be constructed amongst the ruined houses. The
remaining hours of darkness were employed in strengthening the
positions occupied and in working on communication trenches. A
counter-attack by the Germans had been anticipated, and with a view
to consolidating as quickly as possible, every other man of the
second line of each wave had carried with him a pick or shovel, while
every fourth carried as much in the way of extra bombs, ammunition
and sand-bags as he could.
The companies, of course, were very disorganised, and it was
not until about 4 a.m. that everyone had been sorted out.
In the grey light of dawn Pozieres presented a truly desolate
spectacle. It was, to quote the words of Captain Bean’s despatch
of that day, "a few tumbled walls behind the trees, and a low sand-
hill of brick-red dust, with the skeleton of one broken roof.” The
straggling street was simply a long line of rubbish heaps, sometimes
separate, mostly joined together where the houses had fallen in
against one another: and it was behind them that the 3rd Battalion
dug its line of trenches.
As soon as objects became more distinguishable in the light of
dawn, the German snipers began to get busy, especially from the
cover of a red brick wall on the right front. Just in front of D.
Company was a ruined house, which the enemy did not vacate until
about 3.30 a.m., when the growing visibility made the position no
longer tenable. A Lewis gunner of the 3rd Battalion, who noticed
the evacuation, hastened the enemy’s retreat with a few bursts of fire.
Sunday passed comparatively quietly. The line was not shelled
very much, and we spent the day consolidating the positions taken
up in the attack. Much hard work was done, none of us dreaming
of the hell that was so soon to burst upon us all. We were now in a
rather anomalous position, and at 8 a.m. on the Monday the enemy
opened a heavy artillery fire, especially on the trenches in the rear.
Half the 3rd Battalion occupied the front line with two companies,
the Ist Battalion occupied the next two lines with two companies
in each, and half the 3rd Battalion was in our old original line. So
the C.O. recommended to the Brigade that one battalion should
1916—July.


occupy the first two lines, and the other battalion the two rearward
lines. Later he got a memo, instructing him to carry out this sug-
gestion, which was done.
The two Battalions then held what was known as the right half
Brigade sector, under the command of Colonel Heane, the subdivision
being mainly due to the fact that signal communication was very
difficult with the Brigade, the lines being cut as often as they were
repaired, and both signallers and runners becoming casualties all too
quickly. The C.O. started out with eight runners at the beginning
of the action, and all became casualties, one being killed at the C.O.’s
side, and there were a further eight runners on the casualty list before
we were relieved.
In spite of the heavy German fire, the work of continuing the
communication trenches between the first and second lines was gone
on with, and casualties were naturally heavy. The worst feature
of the day was the delay in getting the wounded to the rear. Another
consequence of the heavy shelling was that supplies of food and
water were very precarious. During the day the sun was intensely
hot, but at night the temperature fell sharply, and no blankets were
available. There was no hope of rest in that roar of artillery, and
digging had to go on, so that everyone was worn out, cold and
hungry. A conference at Brigade Headquarters, late on Monday,
decided on another advance, the Bth Battalion, which had been
attached to the Ist, being ordered to pass through to the front of
Pozieres, and to be supported by the 3rd, the Ist taking over the
3rd lines as they were vacated. The German bombardment was
practically incessant, and losses throughout the Brigade were heavy,
but early on Tuesday the 25th the advance was begun.
The Bth Battalion moved up, and the Germans opened a
devastating hail of shells. They concentrated mainly on the village
of Pozieres, which was soon an inferno of bursting missiles. The
trenches that we had so carefully dug during the preceding days were
obliterated in a few minutes, and soon everyone was digging again
like mad to secure a bit of cover.
During the original attack we had lost comparatively few officers
killed as the trenches fell in upon them, food and water were scarce,
and men, but on this day our losses were appalling. Many were
and the wounded could not be got away to the rear, except under
almost insuperable difficulties. McShane and Burstall were among
the many gallant men killed on this day. Everyone was in the
extreme of danger, for there were shells of every calibre bursting
all around us, and it was simply impossible to dodge them.
1916—July.


A curious incident occurred near the front line during the terrific
bombardment. A German was found buried to his waist, and calling
out, evidently for someone to dig him out. Just as someone said,
“Let the Bosche dig him out themselves,” a shell burst close to the
imprisoned man. When the smoke and dust had cleared away, we
were amazed to see the man walking towards us uninjured. His own
shell had dug him out.
Going through the village we found the Bth Battalion in front
of Pozieres, digging their trenches in full view of the enemy, and not
a shell being fired at them. Captain Howell-Price was immediately
put in charge of a party to dig in rear of the junction of the 3rd and
Bth. In the early hours of the 26th the battalions of the 2nd Brigade
arrived to take over the line, and by 11.45 p.m. we were completely
relieved.
The Ist Battalion then moved back to the dump of the 10th
Gordons at Sausage Valley, where a hot meal was provided from
the Battalion’s travelling kitchen. Once more this homely part of
the equipment of war played its all-important part at a critical
juncture. Never were men so wearied and played out, never was the
sight of a travelling kitchen so heartily welcome. Modern armies,
just as those of Napoleon’s day, travel on their stomachs, and the
hot meal filled us with renewed vigor. All were in excellent spirits,
and the men joked and sang as we marched on the weary way to
Tara Hill, above Albert, which we reached about 2 a.m. on Wed-
nesday, the men dropping off to sleep on the bare hillside as soon
as their weary feet had reached that stony haven.
Thus passed the Battalion’s first big engagement in France, an
engagement just as severe as any we had had on Gallipoli, and more
severe as to casualties. On awaking on Tara Hill, we took stock of
our missing mates, and a sad stock-taking it was as we realised the
grievous losses that had been sustained.
In that first battle of Pozieres no fewer than seven officers and
100 other ranks were killed: four officers and 371 other ranks were
wounded: two officers died of wounds and 48 other ranks were
missing, and it is doubtful if the Battalion lost so many men in any
other engagement.
The Colonel, in addressing the parade, said; “As you know, I
am a hard man to please. But I feel proud to think that I have held
the command of such men as you. This Battalion had a wonderful
name on Gallipoli, but during this engagement you have done work
equal to, if not better, than anything that was done on the
Peninsula.”
1916—July.


Not without reason do the survivors of those awful days in
July, 1916, look back on them as one of the most tremendous
experiences of the War.
On July 27 the Battalion, with the rest of the Brigade, marched
to Vadencourt Wood, a place so peaceful after the horrors of Pozieres,
that the memory of it must linger with all who experienced the con-
trast. For the next few days the Brigade kept on the move, billeting
or bivouacking at La Vicogne, and at Bonneville, and finally reaching
Halloy, where a stay was made for some time.
At once the task of reorganisation was undertaken, and rein-
forcements were received, while ten new officers were appointed, and
many promotions were made in the ranks of the N.C.O.’s. This rest
and training did much to rehabilitate the shattered force, though
naturally it was some time before the reinforcements could be all
absorbed and the companies brought up to the standard that had
been attained before the Pozieres battle. The rest was all too short
for most of us, for on August 9 we again moved towards the line.
The march was via La Vicogne and Toutencourt, and we reached
the Brickfields area, near Albert, on August 14. On August 16 wc
moved into support of the 4th and 3rd Battalions in the line, the
Brigade holding the sector opposite Mouquet Farm. On August 18
the Battalion took over part of the line, until then held by the 3rd
Battalion, on the right of the Brigade sector. During this time the
Battalion was not engaged in any actual fighting, but patrolling
and the extension of a number of saps were carried out each night.
The units on the flank, however, made an attack, and this, as
usual, involved heavy shelling, though luckily the casualties were not
very heavy, amounting to 21 other ranks killed, and three officers
and 80 other ranks wounded. Then the other battalions of the
Brigade were relieved, but our Battalion remained in the line, being
attached to the 3rd Brigade until relieved by the 23rd Battalion on
August 22. On August 24 we rejoined the Brigade at Beauval.
The Ist Brigade now entrained for the north and went into
camps vacated by the Canadians in rear of Ypres, the Battalion de-
training at Hopoutre and marching to Eyrie Huts. The strength
at this time was 22 officers and 454 other ranks. A move was made
on the night of August 31 into the area forward of Ypres, and the
Battalion acted in support of the 3rd Battalion in the line at Hill 60
until September 7, when it took over the line. There was much
work to be done while in support, the trenches all being in a very
bad state in consequence of a German attack made some time
previously, and they were also shallow and extremely muddy. This
tour in the line was especially noteworthy from the enemy’s use of
1916 —July-September.


minenwerfer, to which our men replied with rifle grenades to good
effect. The trenches were, in many cases, very close, and there was
more activity than usual on both sides, both in shelling and the use
of rifle grenades, which was kept up until the Battalion was relieved
on September 12/13 and went to Devonshire Camp.
This was not very far from Poperinghe, where baths, those
luxurious boons to every soldier, were available, and here too the
regimental canteen was started, proving an immediate success. No
less than 350 francs were taken on the first day. Here, in a hut
filled with lachrymatory gas, anti-gas training was given, and the
men tried out the new box respirator. On September 22 a highly
successful Battalion sports meeting was held on the Divisional Gas
School ground, and during the evenings special issues of food were
made, with money supplied partly from the regimental fund, and
partly from a fund subscribed by the officers. The Corps Commander
attended at church parade, accompanied by the then High Commis-
sioner, Mr. Andrew Fisher.
But all good things must have an end, and on September 25
the rest ended, and the Battalion relieved the 6th in the front line,
with headquarters at the Bluff Tunnels. Lieut.-Colonel Heane, who
had been in command of the Brigade, resumed control from Major
P. S. S. Woodforde, and the tour lasted until October 7, when the
Battalion was relieved by the 3rd, and went into support. This
period in the line was marked by similiar incidents to the previous
one, and, if anything, both sides were more active than they had
been before. A copy of the report for October 4 gives a good idea
of those strenuous days:—
‘‘Enemy heavily bombarded top of Thames Street and
trench 29 from 12.00 to 18.30 with .77 and 5.9 H.E., causing
casualties—l O.R. killed and 1 O.R. died of wounds. Thames
Street blown in for 70 ft. and trench 29 for 10 ft. Our
artillery and T.M.’s retaliated at intervals. Following work
was carried out:—Sandbag wall and dugouts erected in craters.
Parados and parapets constructed in firing line. Damage to
Thames Street and trench 29 repaired. Duckboarding and
revetting in supports and communications.”
The Battalion stayed in support until October 12, returning to
Devonshire Camp and then by stages to Steenvorde, Oost Houck
and Nortleulinghem some miles from St. Omer. Here, it may be
mentioned, was carried out the polling for the conscription issue in
Australia.
On October 20 the Battalion marched to St. Omer and entrained
there for the Somme area, where it detrained at Longpre, and billeted
1916—Septembet-October.


at Brucamps. On October 23 we marched to near Moufflers, and
'buses took us to near Buire, a march bringing us to a camp near
Fricourt, which was left next morning, for a so-called camp at
Mametz Wood, which proved to be nothing more than a muddy
field with a few tarpaulins and practically no other shelter. More-
over, rain was falling steadily throughout the day. It was a truly
miserable experience. While we were at this “camp” the officers
reconnoitred the front areas with a view to relieving the units there.
These units were expected to attack at any moment, but the operation
was postponed several times, and in the end did not take place as
planned. The roads to the forward areas were in a frightful state,
for attempts had been made to corduroy them, with the result that
loose poles were laid across them, between which the horses’ feet
went, and the mud was both clinging and very deep.
On October 29 the Ist Division relieved the 29th, and the Ist
Brigade took over part of the line, the Battalion holding the sector
in front of Gueudecourt. Then came the task of deepening and
cleaning the trenches, a Herculean job, for they were deep in mud
and the heavy rain of the first few days caused them to cave in in
many places, making the task doubly hard. The men’s feet also
began to suffer in the bitter weather, and there was a constant demand
for whale oil to prevent trench feet. It proved efficacious to a certain
extent. Everyone suffered intensely from the cold and discomfort
of the soggy trenches. It was bitter all day and all night. The
Somme winter of 1916/1917 had begun, one of the worst and most
heart-breaking periods that the Battalion went through in the whole
of its eventful history.
1916—October.


CHAPTER ELEVEN.
THE SOMME WINTER.
O here was the Battalion, in a sea of mud, settling
down for winter on the Somme. The sector lay to
the left of the gunpits in front of Cheese Road, and
facing Fritz’s Folly. There were no dugouts, no
duckboards, no revetting: the trenches were knee-deep
in mud and the rain was unceasing. So bad were the conditions that
we were lucky that no one was smothered when the holes in the
banks of the Sunken Road, used as dug-outs, collapsed. Major
Howell-Price, D. 5.0., M.C., who was then Captain, was so ham-
pered by the state of the line that he established D. Company Head-
quarters in a small dugout in No Man’s Land. And for everyone,
both officers and men, the strain was terrific. The mud had one
redeeming feature. It localised the effect of shell fire, so that casualties
were few, but this relief was more than counter-balanced by the
general misery and the sufferings of many from trench feet. All the
efforts of the M. 0., Captain Kirkwood, who had his aid post in
Grass Lane, and the combined effect of whale oil, changes of socks,
rubbing of feet, the cutting of tight breeches and the wrapping of
sand-bags round the legs, could not avert the horror, and there was
a constant stream of evacuations.
At this time a big attack by the Ist Anzac and 3rd Army Corps
had been planned, and all that hindered its execution was the lack
of favourable weather. It was decided to straighten out the line
prior to the attack, and the Battalion was ordered to capture Fritz's
Folly, Hilt and Bayonet Trenches, with the 3rd co-operating on the
right. On November 1 the Battalion was relieved, and went into
reserve at Flers and Delville Wood, and here a rehearsal of the pro-
posed attack was held, while on the 3rd the officers visited the line
and watched a rehearsal of the barrage. The weather began to
change on November 2, the heavy rain lifting and the ground com-
mencing to dry. But this made conditions even more difficult, for
the mud, losing its pea soup-like consistency, became a sticky jelly,
and to walk was a nightmare of toil. A jumping-off trench had been
dug about 100 yards from our line, the objective being about 300
yards' away, with the final 50 yards on a downward slope. On the
right was the Triangle, a strong point formed by the junction of
1916—November.


the Sunken Road, Hilt and Lard trenches. Wire was plentiful, and
had been practically undamaged by our artillery.
On the night of November 4/5 the Battalion moved into
position. Headquarters were established about 10 o’clock at Cheese
Road, and by 7 o’clock the right assaulting company, D., under
Capt. Howell-Pricc, was in position in the front line, ready to move
into the jumping-off trench. C. Company got into position under
Capt. Jacobs, by 9.30 p.m. but part of this assaulting force had ap-
parently been seen coming overland. The support company, 8.,
moved in at 11.30, and were plainly seen, as their wet tin helmets
shone out clearly. Hun screw rockets promptly shot up, and big
guns and trench mortars immediately commenced a light bar-
rage all over the crowded area, while from the enemy front
lines came a continuous stream of Verey lights. Tired out with the
sticky struggle up to the line, the men had their discomfort heightened
by the rain, which commenced to fall in a chilling, soaking deluge.
Under these conditions it was impossible to get the men into the
jumping-off trench, and everyone was waiting anxiously for our
barrage, because with No Man’s Land now like a swamp, it was a
question whether the attackers could move quickly enough, with the
barrage, to reach the enemy lines.
At 12.30 a.m. the barrage fell, and in a moment the first men
were out, one helping the other to scramble from the sloppy trench.
For a while everything went on well, the men managing to keep up
with the barrage, except on the right of C. Coy., where a few shorts
caused a crowding into the left; but the mud soon slackened the pace.
By the time the attackers were within 50 yards of the enemy on the
downward slope, the barrage, which had had little effect upon the
objective, had passed right over, and the German machine-guns were
warming to their work.
The front was as bright as the entrance to a picture palace, the
lights being reflected back by the swampy pools, and our men, chilled
by the heavy rain, worn out with the awful march, and struggling
to make headway, were wonderful targets at that short range. At
that time we were not well used to machine guns, which were rattling
like all the fiends of hell let loose, and two of them were firing
obliquely from the left, causing havoc among C. Company, while
the Battalion’s Lewis guns were clogged with mud and were abso-
lutely useless. From the dry chalk trench in front, crammed with
the enemy, came a withering blast of rifle fire, and a continuous'rain
of bombs, which did deadly work at such close quarters. C. Com-
pany, splendidly led by Capt. Jacobs, did their utmost to reach the
Germans, but so heavy were the casualties that the task proved
impossible, and they stopped about 30 yards from the trench. Capt.
1916—November.


Edgley, at that time a lieutenant, who was in the centre of that
gallant band, had not a man left when he reached the wire, while
on D. Company’s front, with his back calmly turned to the foe,
Capt. Howell-Price stood only 20 yards from the trench, urging his
men on to still greater effort. But it was too much to ask of the
bravest. One man only, Sgt. Barwick, of C. Company, reached the
line, killing a couple of the enemy before getting a bayonet in the leg.
Another attack was organised at once, and Lieuts. Hastic
a’Beckett and Somerset struggled through the brilliantly lit swamp
of hell, leading their men with a cool courage that won them the
M.C. On the right Howell-Price’s courage inspired his weary men
to fresh effort, but against the prepared enemy the task was im-
possible. A third attack was launched, but it too was far too weak
to have any effect against the rifle fire of the well posted foe. The
bombers, 33 strong, had been led up the Sunken Road by Lieut.
Finlayson, and had met a tornado of fire from machine-guns that
had practically wiped them out. Only five got back, and the gallant
officer was left there. The rest of the night we spent looking for the
wounded, and stretchers were scarce. The sufferers had a terrible
ordeal waiting in the chilly rain to be carried in. Each stretcher
required eight men, and the task was an awful one, but everything
that could be done for their comrades was done by the rest of the
Battalion.
Thus, for the first time, the Battalion failed to reach its ob-
jective. It never failed again. Our record of having never lost an
inch of ground Was proudly preserved right through the War. The
casualties were heavy, totalling nine officers and 161 men. But it
was no one’s fault, save that of the weather, and the feeling of the
whole Battalion is echoed in the concluding words of Capt. Howell-
Price’s report:—
“This is not a report which I like to make. We did our
damnedest to pull it off.”
The Brigade had a severe loss in the death of Colonel Howell-
Price, M.C., Commander of the 3rd Battalion, who died of wounds
inflicted by a sniper during the emplacing of a machine-gun to cover
this attack.
The Battalion was relieved by the 9th on November 6, and
marched out to Pommiers Camp, where it was placed under orders
from the 3rd, and commenced a daily fatigue under Royal Engineers
supervision, repairing the Mametz Link Road, a solid task under
much more comfortable conditions. A search was made of clearing
stations and field ambulances for our missing, without result, and
the 40 odd reinforcements who arrived were gratefully received by
1916—November.


company commanders. On November 11 the Battalion marched to
Dernancourt, a pleasant little village just outside Albert, filled with
happy memories for many in the summer of 1917, when the swim-
ming was really good. Thence we moved on to the training area,
with a strength of 22 officers and 673 other ranks. The billets at
Fremont were unsuitable, and we made a move to St. Sauveur, where
training began again. Life went on in routine fashion, the transport
being inspected by Brigadier-General Smyth, V.C., and Lieut.
a’Beckett and 20 men having four days’ picket duty in Amiens. At
the end of the month a move was made to Ribemont, a Somme
village, whose muddy streets and splashed walls rendered it indis-
tinguishable from the many others with which we had become
acquainted.
It was just at the beginning of December when the return move
towards the front was commenced. The Brigade was ordered to
entrain in the middle of the night, and marched to Vignacourt for
that purpose. The cold was intense and there was a weary wait,
for the train did not get away until about midday. About 4in the
afternoon Ribemont was reached.
Lieut.-Colonel Heane, who had been absent in England on
leave, returned on December 3, and was ordered to take temporary
command of the 2nd Brigade. Major Woodforde remained in com-
mand of the Ist Battalion, the strength on December 5 being 15
officers and 374 other ranks.
The Brigade moved to Melbourne Camp at Mametz on
December 6, and was quartered in Nissen Huts, but paths of old
bricks and chalk had to be made, as it was impossible to walk any-
where else for the mud. The horse lines were disgraceful, the animals
having to stand in the open mud with no other protection than
their rugs, but it was out of the question to make any improvement.
Two companies were sent on detached duty, road-making, near
Meaulte, and a mining platoon, under Lieut. Richards, with platoons
from the other battalions, was under the general command of Lieut.
Isaacs of the 4th Battalion.
Here we received our Christmas boxes from the Sydney Citizens'
War Chest Fund, and very welcome they proved, although they were
so early. Pipes, tobacco, cigarettes, handkerchiefs, sweets, potted
meats and coffee and milk were distributed, and proved indeed a
godsend to us all. We were expecting an early move to the line, and
a draft of 150 partially trained reinforcements arrived, who were
kept in separate platoons pending further training at Mametz. On
December 19 the ground became frozen for the first time, which was
a much appreciated change so far as walking was concerned, but it
1916—Novcmbcr-December.


was of far too short duration, as rain began to fall again almost
immediately.
The Battalion moved to Bernafay on December 23, remaining
there in huts, and engaged upon fatigue work until December 30,
when we relieved the 3rd Battalion in the line—the right sector of
the Brigade, and to the right of the Gucudecourt trenches, which we
had occupied on the last occasion. It was an unpleasant surprise at
this time to all of us to hear that we were to lose Brigadier-General
N. M. Smyth, V.C., who was sent to command the 2nd Division.
He had been in command of us since the early days of Gallipoli, and
was looked upon as a permanent part of the organisation. Everyone
felt that the old order was changing. Lieut.-Colonel Blarney, then
commanding the 2nd Battalion, temporarily succeeded him. The
strength on December 31 was 24 officers and 726 other ranks.
Cold, rain and mud—those are the outstanding memories of
this tour in the trenches. Everything was done to keep the troops
as warm and comfortable as possible in the circumstances, and all
food was cooked in the rear and carried to the front line in hot con-
tainers. It was hard work struggling over the mud with the rations,
but at least the meals had the advantage of being hot. Patrolling
was carried out, but the conditions precluded much activity on either
our part or that of the enemy.
We were relieved on January 7, and moved via Bazentin to
Ribemont, where we went into clean and comfortable billets. The
baths at Heilly were soon put to good use, and there, too, we obtained
a much needed change into clean clothing. On January 13 a further
move was made into a tented camp—and a very cold one at that—
at Baizieux, where snow began to fall, and remained on the ground
for some time. Training, mostly of a “muscle-hardening” character,
was carried on, and a series of games was organised. Some stereo-
typed forms of attack were explained at a divisional conference at
which C.O.’s were present, and these were practised by us. Later on
the whole Brigade had a regular dress rehearsal over a flagged ground,
which seemed to give a great deal more satisfaction to the critics and
onlookers than to the participants. It was repeated on the following
day.
On January 23 the Battalion marched to Becourt, a hut camp.
The weather was now bitterly cold, and the ground was frozen hard.
After three days there we were moved on to Bazentin, thence into
the front line, the sector taken over being the Maze. The events of
the first few days showed us that a “friendly war” had been going
on for some time, neither side being frightened to show themselves,
confident that they would not be fired on. But this was soon
changed and the old order of hate was resumed. The tour lasted
1916 —December, 1917—January.


until January 30, when the 3rd Battalion took over. Conditions
on the whole were much more pleasant than they had been in the
mud, for the frozen ground, with snow lying everywhere, was a
welcome relief, and evacuations were comparatively small in number.
Movement by day, however, was impossible in rear, as it was in full
view of the enemy.
On being relieved, the Battalion moved to Bazentin Camp, in
Brigade reserve, and on February 4 again moved forward into sup-
port. Here a raid was projected under Lieut. Somerset, and training
was carried out. The party was to be dressed in “snow suits” (white
overalls) to prevent men being seen on the frozen ground, but the
raid was eventually cancelled. The Battalion had another tour in
the line for a few days before leaving on February 12 for Fricourt
Farm, a camp of Nissen huts. Then on February 16 we moved to
Breslc for training, the men being housed in billets. As usual,
reorganisation and training of specialists comprised the syllabus,
platoons practising advancing on a trench, firing ball ammunition.
Here an unfortunate bombing accident occurred, resulting in the
death of one officer and two men from wounds, another officer and
12 men being wounded. The Battalion received orders to move, as
the 4th Battalion was about to replace us.
1917—January-February.


CHAPTER TWELVE.
THE GERMAN RETIREMENT AND BULLECOURT.
N February 24 news was received of the suspected
retirement of the enemy. All our plans were sud-
denly changed. The ennui of the long winter was
broken as if by magic, and it was felt that anything
might be about to happen. We were moved to Fricourt,
and plans were made for an attack on the German trenches. But
it was discovered that they were no longer occupied, the enemy having
got away in their own time, leaving their booby-traps behind them.
The traps caused a few casualties, but nothing very serious. Everyone
was on tip-toe, for the Battalion was ready to move at a moment's
notice. The 3rd Brigade was in the line and had advanced some
distance before the Ist Brigade provided relief on February 27, while
we were in reserve at Eaucourt I’Abbe. Carrying parties were sup-
plied to the Battalions in the line, and ours was the sad task of
burying the many dead who still lay in the old No Man’s Land. The
thaw had now come, to make our task all the harder, for all move-
ment meant trudging through the clinging mud once more. On
February 28 the daily strength was 25 officers and 886 other ranks.
The enemy was retiring by slow stages, and on March 5 we
were relieved by the 19th and 20th Battalions, marched to Bazentin,
and next day moved to the Fricourt A. Camp, where we rested.
Parties each 100 strong were detained for work on the roads, to link
up old roads with the new areas occupied since the recent advance,
and it was a strange experience to walk about in the open where
formerly hardly a move could be made without drawing fire.
It was here that the famous Fife and Drum Band was organised,
under Sergeant-Drummer Downes, who will be well remembered by
his name of "Drummy.” Until our brass band was reorganised later
on, the men with the fifes and drums helped to lighten many a
monotonous march. There was a presentation of medals by General
Birdwood at the Sunday church parade, which many will recall.
The Battalion marched on March 22, via Becourt and Albert,
to billets in Ribemont—not a particularly inviting village in the
wintry weather and the eternal mud. However, it had long been
1917—February-March.


in occupation, and there were wire bunks in many stables, so that
it was not a case of all having to sleep upon the floor. Major Wood-
forde rejoined here from leave, and next day Major Jacobs left the
Battalion to join the 6th Division, then being formed in England.
Colonel Heane was now permanently commanding the 2nd Battalion,
and on March 23 command of the Battalion was taken over by
Lieut..-Colonel B. V. Stacy, from the 4th Battalion, with Major
Woodforde second in command. Various tactical schemes were
carried out, and some boxing contests held in the village proved very
popular. But it was a miserable time, for the weather was wet
and cold, with occasional sleet. No one was really In love with
Ribemont.
Word soon came, however, to move, to "chase the wily Hun,
and capture many a gun” as one of the Brigade songs had it, for the
enemy was still retreating, blowing up and destroying as he went,
and leaving his many traps and hidden bombs to injure the unwary.
So after a final few baths at Heilly, which we knew would be the last
baths for some time, we moved off towards the line on April 3, 25
officers and 892 other ranks spending the first night at Montauban.
Orders next day were to proceed to Villers au Flos, but were later
changed, and the Battalion settled fairly comfortably in the village
of Haplincourt. This village had been blown up and knocked about
so far as the enemy had had time to demolish it, but there remained
in many buildings sufficient shelter to keep out the rain, and with
open country ahead—and grassed at that—everyone was in really
good spirits. Wood was there to be burnt, and everyone who has
neen through that life will know how much that factor meant in
actual creature comfort.
One could not help noting in this and similar villages how much
unnecessary destruction had been done by the Germans. The cutting
down of harmless fruit trees and acts of such character always seemed
to us to savour of brutal wantonness. The destruction of the houses
themselves was, of course, a justifiable military precaution. It was
also interesting on the march to view the landscape so long hidden
from us by the hills south of Bapaume, and to pass places such as
Villers au Flos, from which the enemy’s guns used to roar so con-
sistently. The early part of that day, with its snow and rain, will
long be remembered by those who had to march through it, past
Longueval, over Elliott’s Duck-walk and the dreary old muddy
battlefield which the Battalion had such good cause to know and
to remember. Between Haplincourt and the line were former rear
lines of the enemy, trenches covered with thick wire belts running
across the country for miles, and, except for these obstacles, it was
possible to gallop across open grass country which held not a single
head of stock.
1917—March-April.


The Battalion was to take over the line in front of Doignics,
and thither it marched on the afternoon of April 5, past Lebucquiere.
Advanced parties had gone on in the early hours of the morning.
The battalion relieved was the 59th, and the line we took over con-
sisted of a line of posts situated on the eastern edge of the village of
Doignies. The 3rd Battalion was on our right, somewhere in front
of Velu, and soon came up, and the 3rd Brigade was on our left.
All the villages in this sector were regularly shelled by the Germans,
so Doignies was not frequented, and C. Company’s Headquarters,
which were in the village, were so badly shelled one night that the
officers had to dig their way out of the cellar.
The work for the first couple of nights consisted of advancing
the circle of posts a couple of hundred yards, and this was done
without any trouble. The Germans were occupying small posts,
two or three men to each, but our patrols saw them only on one
night, and they soon retreated under Lewis gun fire. The Hinden-
burg line, to which the Germans were thought to be retreating, was
still two or three miles away. The British plan, of course, was to
harry them as much as possible, and preparations were going on all
the time for an attack on Hermies by the 2nd Battalion. They Were
to pass through our lines and attack Hermies from the north, in
order to dodge the wire which guarded it on the western side, and
the 3rd Battalion was to press forward simultaneously on the western
and southern sides. The role of our Battalion was to advance our
right flank and protect the 2nd Battalion left flank. This task was
allotted to A. Company, under Capt. Edgley, and was carried out
with great success. The other companies, C. and D., advanced
their posts from 300 to 400 yards at dusk, and garrisoned them.
The 12th Battalion was attacking Boursies, and C. Company was
to join up with its right flank. During the operations patrols were
to be pushed out, and Demicourt was to be watched closely with the
object of capture if possible.
Hermies fell, according to plan, but the situation in Boursies
seemed to be obscure, until a C. Company patrol, under Lieut.
B. W. Champion, found little resistance there and captured a German
asleep in a basket. A patrol of the same company, under Lieut.
Sampson, got into Demicourt, and stayed there for a couple of hours,
succeeding in driving off some of the enemy who attempted to return.
Later in the morning an attack was made on Demicourt, delay
having occurred through the telephone lines having been cut, and
it was much more difficult to make the assault in broad daylight.
A. and C. Companies endeavoured to work round and attack from
the flank, while D. Company moved up ready for a frontal
rush at the opportune moment. The first attempt failed, and heavy
artillery fire was experienced in addition to the machine-guns. Later
1917—April.


on, however, the beet factory was captured by an A Company patrol
under Lieut. R. G. Howell-Price, and patrols then got into the village
from the south. Shortly afterwards D. Company went forward
again, and finally took possession of the village, digging in on its
outskirts. Lieut. Sampson, of C. Company, with 24 men, had
entered the place about 8 a.m. just in time to beat off the enemy as
they were attempting to return. Sampson remained there with his
patrol. The enemy, however, occupied the high ground to the east
and were able, with their machine-guns, to give a great deal of trouble
to the men advancing across the open on the flanks. After dusk
C. Company advanced and linked up with the men of D. Company.
Next day the Battalion front was extended to the north of
Boursies, and again the next day to link up with the 6th Battalion.
The casualties for April 9 were one officer and ten other ranks killed,
and three officers and 42 other ranks wounded. The Battalion was
holding a line of about 4,000 yards when it was relieved on the night
of April 11-12 by the 4th. For a few days we remained behind
Doignies in trenches and shelters which the men had to make for
themselves, and some work was done in clearing the roads in Beau-
metz and Doignies of trees and debris and in filling in craters. On
April 13 the two Battalions in the line threw out a line of posts
from 1,000 to 1,500 yards in advance of the former line, and this
was the position until the morning of April 15.
At 4 o’clock that morning a heavy enemy barrage could be
heard, and the companies immediately stood to arms; but as no
reports of attacks came from the front line battalions, they later
stood down, with the exception of B. Company. It was soon learned,
however, that the enemy was attacking in force and was pressing the
4th Battalion hard, especially near the Cambrai Road. The outposts
had been driven in, and soon the companies of the Ist Battalion were
all either engaged or in close support of the 4th. B. Company moved
forward at 7 a.m., two platoons being used in the front line—
one on the left and one on the right of Boursies—the others being in
support just south of that place. Later on, somewhere about 10 a.m.,
C. and D. Companies went forward. Major Woodforde taking
command of the three companies in the line, all being under the
orders of Major Sasse, D. 5.0., of the 4th.
By that time the attack had been driven off, though the line
had been withdrawn roughly to that occupied before the advance of
April 13. The position on the left of the 4th Battalion was not so
clear, and the enemy was still concentrated there. However, a
definite portion of the line was taken over by B. and C. Companies,
who relieved the 4th Battalion troops over open country in daylight,
with surprisingly few casualties. At night our Battalion took over
1917—April.

from the 4th the line protecting Boursies from the Chapel (inclusive)
to the north, with B. Company on the right and C. on the left. So
the counter-attack finished, the Germans retiring during the night,
leaving many dead.
The remainder of this tour in the line was not marked by any
outstanding incidents. The weather continued very wet and cold,
and all were longing for a glimpse of the sun. A. Company relieved
C. in the line on the night of April 16-17, and D. Company relieved
B. on the following night. Patrolling and consolidation of the
position were carried on all the time, and the line was linked up with
that of the battalion on the left flank. About April 20 the weather
began to clear and the sunny days were much appreciated after the
snow and rain that had been continuous for so long. There was
great aeroplane activity in consequence of the fine weather, and we
derived much fun from watching the daring and complicated
manoeuvres of the airmen. The Battalion was relieved by the 7th
Staffordshire Regiment on the night of April 24, and moved to
Vclu Wood, next day taking up residence in tents at the Sugar
Factory near Beaulencourt.
During the fighting round Demicourt and Boursies Lieuts.
W. R. Yates, R. W. Sampson and R. G. Howell-Price were awarded
Military Crosses for conspicuous gallantry, and Military Medals
were awarded to the following:—s2s6 L./C. G. Woods, 5478 Pte.
J. Warnc, 1969 Cpl. J. Knox, 217 A Pte. W. J. Whatmore, 2445
Cpl. C. J. Howell, 2189 Sigr. J. J. Parish, 3389 Cpl. J. Lynch.
Our stay at Beaulencourt did not last long, the strength being
30 officers and 789 other ranks, under the command of Major Wood-
fordc, the commander being absent on leave. The Brigade then
became attached to the 2nd Division, which was to attack at
Bullccourt, and on May 3, after moving up by various stages, we
were in the corps line at Vaulx. That night the Battalion was
ordered to take over part of the line near Bullecourt, then held by
details of the 17th, 22nd, 23rd and 24th Battalions, the 2nd Division
having attacked in the morning, encountering strong opposition. The
line taken over was part of 0.G.1, the companies in the line from
right to left being D., C. and A., the support and carrying duties
being undertaken by B. Company. The 3rd Battalion was in front
in the position captured by the 2nd Division in 0.G.2. The position
was most peculiar, the enemy being on both flanks of both battalions,
only a wedge having been driven into their line.
Some of the heaviest fighting that the Battalion experienced
throughout its career took place during the next few days. There
were continual bombing attacks and counter-attacks. There was
a fierce enemy attack with flammenwerfer, but Capt. Somerset jumped
1917—April-May.


out of the trench, hurling bombs, and they departed hurriedly,
leaving five of their companions dead. All the time there was a
heavy rain of shells, and sniping and bombing went on without
intermission. By means of our bomb attacks the line was extended
to the left by both the Ist and 3rd Battalions, and bombing blocks
were established, many of the enemy being killed and 16 prisoners
taken. This fine work was carried out by Lieut. T. J. Richards and
16 other ranks. The enemy made a determined attack on this
position later on, but were repulsed, though casualties from shell-fire
were heavy. On May 5 Major Woodforde was mortally wounded
by a shell when going round the trenches, a calamity that all found
it hard to bear, and Capt. A. K. Mackenzie came up from the
transport lines and assumed command. The enemy continued a
strong counter-attack all along our trenches with bombs, but we
derived great assistance from the use of Stokes mortars, and all efforts
to dislodge us were repelled.
On May 5 A. Company, having suffered severely, exchanged
places in the line with D. Company, and B. Company reinforced D.,
which had been in heavy engagements on the left, the enemy giving
no rest with a scries of determined attacks. The battalion on our
right was driven out of its trench on May 6, and the Germans were
seen approaching our right flank, where Headquarters and A. Com-
pany were stationed. A counter-attack was organised without delay,
Cpl. C. J. Howell leading the men by advancing along the top of
the trench, hurling bombs and later using his bayonet to advantage.
It was a wonderful display of courage and fighting spirit, for which
the corporal was afterwards deservedly awarded the V.C. Cpl.
Knox, who was afterwards fatally wounded, also played a big part
in this heroic attack. The operation proved most successful, ending
in the whole of the ground gained by the enemy being re-taken.
Then D. Company, on the left flank of the Battalion, was again
attacked, but without success, and later in the day we were relieved
by the 4th Battalion and took up a position on the railway embank-
ment. Here Capt. Mackenzie received a special message from G.H.Q.
thanking the Battalion for the good work done in these engagements.
Our casualties, however, were heavy, the Battalion losing five officers
and 44 other ranks killed, and eight officers and 232 other ranks
wounded.
The command of the Battalion, then near Vaulx-Vraucourt,
was resumed on May 7 by Lieut.-Col. Stacy, and on May 9 we left
the forward area for what proved our longest rest.
On May 21 we reached Lavieville after a week’s stay at
Bazcntin-le-Pctit en route, and this was our headquarters for some
weeks. Who will forget those liberal days of leave that were granted
1917—May.


for us to go in to Amiens? The Pioneer section erected shower baths,
and the billets were good and comfortable. While a certain number
of our men were allowed to go to a rest camp for a time, the rest
carried on the usual training. Musketry and platoon competitions
were the order of the day, and we were strengthened by reinforce-
ments, which were badly needed. Capt. Phillip Howell-Pricc
rejoined us here after a period on the staff, and was shortly afterwards
promoted Major. The whole Division was brought together by
a sports meeting and show at Henencourt, which proved a decided
success, and so we went on until near the end of June, when the
Battalion, as part of the Division, spent about a week in tactical
exercises at Mailly-Maillet. These included a night march and
attack at dawn on Scrre, over the old trenches which had seen more
than one hard-fought battle. This visit was notable also for the
fact that Mr. W. A. Holman, then Premier of New South Wales,
paid us a visit and addressed the Brigade.
The Battalion, shortly after returning to Lavieville, moved on
to Bray-sur-Somme, where there was the luxury of huts to sleep in,
and where further training was carried out. A party attended,
on July 8, the unveiling of the Ist Division memorial by Lieut.-
Gen. Birdwood at Pozieres. The Brigade was informally in-
spected by the King on July 12, the troops lining the road as
he drove through in his car. On July 23 we marched to Dernan-
court, entraining on July 26 for the north, and arriving next
day at Wallon-Cappel, in Flanders. This village was the first that
we had become acquainted with in France, so all ranks took the
opportunity of visiting old friends, who were glad to sec us again.
The final move of the rest period was made on August 9 to Petit-sec-
Bois. The Brigade was to have marched past the Corps commander
at Hazebrouck, but the enemy shelled the town and the march past
took place on the road. It was a sad sight for us to see the inhabitants
fleeing from the town with bundles of such belongings as they had
been able to get together as the German shells began to play havoc
with their dwellings. While at Scc-Bois C. and D. Companies, as
part of a composite battalion of the Brigade, marched past General
Plumer, commanding the 2nd Army.
In retrospect the days spent at Petit-sec-Bois in training, games
and route marches seemed an idyllic existence, though every soldier,
as in duty bound, grumbled at the time. Little did the men imagine
as the Battalion swung out of the village by the long straggling street
that meets the Strazcele-Vieux Berquin road at right angles, that
when they were again in those parts their former billets would be
shell-torn ruins, and the Foret de Nicppe, through which they had
often marched at ease, lustily bellowing that they “were the members
1917—May-August.


of the First Brigade,” or some such ditty, would be drenched with
gas and seamed with trenches. But so it was to be in the spring of
1918. By August 31 we were nearly up to strength again, the
numbers being 39 officers and 914 other ranks, and a great offensive
was ahead of us.
1917—August.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
THE THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES.
HHE Third Battle of Ypres had now been in progress
for over six weeks, and the Australian Infantry divisions
were next on the roster for employment in it. Fighting
had been stopped by the wet weather, but two fine weeks
having intervened, another attack was imminent, and
we Were in for it.
The Battalion left Sec-Bois on September 13 for the line, by
way .of Meteren and Palace Camp, and by daylight on September 16
relieved the 7th London Regiment in a sector near the Menin Road,
Part of the ground to be covered was in view of the enemy owing
to the lack of a communication trench for about 100 yards, the
Battalion being badly shelled on the way in, and escaping with only
a few casualties by only the greatest of good luck. Every unit, as
all will remember, used to think that the unit it was relieving should
have done a little more work for those coming after, and it was
just the same on this occasion.
We marched in with 29 officers and 753 other ranks, the
remainder having been left behind according to custom, to form a
nucleus. Our job was to hold the line near Clapham Junction for
a few days, while preparations were made for an attack on a large
scale. All the officers and n.c.o.’s had had the opportunity of study-
ing a large relief map of the area, which had been prepared by the
2nd Army Engineers, and this enabled them to get a much better
idea of the country than would have been possible from an ordinary
map. Our stretch in the line was fairly strenuous, shelling being
heavy on both sides, while practice barrages were frequent. One
night, in particular, there was a heavy bombardment of gas shells.
On the night of September 18-19 the Battalion was relieved
by the 6th and 11th Battalions, though A. Company continued to
hold the advanced posts. One of these under Lieut. Ward, together
with some of the 6th Battalion men, succeeded in silencing a machine-
gun and capturing a flammenwerfer shortly before zero hour, thus
avoiding a great deal of damage to the attacking troops which were
assembling.
1917—September.


The attack of September 20 was carried out by the 2nd and
3rd Brigades, and proved highly successful. The Battalion after-
wards moved into a support position, just behind the front line, but
was relieved the next night. While at Half-way House, prior to
moving into support, we were bombed, Lieut. Bruton and Lieut.
Clow being wounded, while two other ranks were killed and 16
wounded. The Battalion’s strength on leaving the line was 29
officers and 606 other ranks. We moved to Stcenvoorde by 'buses
on September 24 for a week’s rest and refit, and while there orders
were received that we should take part in an attack on Broodseinde
Ridge. So on October 1 we again climbed on the ’buses for Chateau
Segard, being played out by the band, which had remained behind
with the nucleus.
While we were at Steenvoorde, rumors of an imminent "big
stunt” had become more and more insistent. As early as September
27 a party of officers from the Ist Brigade was sent up to reconnoitre
the front line, and had a grim foretaste of what We were to endure.
So our motor-lorries carried us to the shelters around Chateau Segard,
a place already known to most of the men. A more unlovely,
mud-stricken spot could scarcely be imagined. Of the once stately
mediaeval castle the German shells had left only a few shattered walls.
Yet, in the days that followed, Chateau Segard came to be regarded
as a home away from home. It was the Battalion’s position in
reserve, and in comparison with the inferno of mud and shells further
forward, seemed a veritable haven of peace and quietness: this
despite the fact that Gothas dropped bombs close to us every night,
and an occasional unexpected long-range shell caused a flurried scatter.
Apart from actual fighting, much fatigue work had to be done,
such as laying cables, carrying duckboards, always the Digger’s most-
hated task, barbed wire, rations and so forth. And even for an
unencumbered man it was no easy task to move along the roads.
The concentration of troops of all arms was so great that the am-
munition and supply columns demanded all the road space, and the
harassed, mud-splashed infantry had to struggle along in the slush
at the side as best they could. To make matters worse, the routes
for miles back were under shell fire, and confusion became worse
confounded when, as so frequently happened, a shell burst right on
the road. It was fortunate, indeed, in such cases, if no damage was
done to motor lorry, mule or man.
On October 2 the Battalion moved by a night march up to
Wcsthoek Ridge, via Halfway House, and took up a position in
trenches on the western slope of the ridge. The 3rd was spent in
the completion of preparations, the issue of maps and air photographs
1917 —September-October.


to officers and n.c.o.’s, and the reconnaissance by the officers of the
front line, then held by the 2nd Battalion.
In the Ist Brigade sector there were only two means of approach
to the line from Westhoek Ridge, namely, the duckboard tracks
known as Jabber and Hellcs Tracks. In spite of a considerable
amount of work on them by the Pioneers, these tracks were inadequate
to cope with the traffic, and in the low-lying ground just behind
the front line trenches sections of the duckboards had either never
been laid, or had been engulfed by the mud. Moreover, the whole
area had been subjected to practically continuous shelling since 1915,
and not a blade of grass or square foot of undisturbed soil remained.
On the air photographs the pitted appearance of the terrain was
reminiscent of views of the moon’s surface. In such country trans-
port was a serious problem, and the stranded tanks which dotted
every landscape forward of Bellewarde Ridge spoke eloquently of its
difficulties. The duckboards had to be rigidly adhered to, for to
walk across country in heavy equipment or even without equipment
was courting disaster. The Germans were well aware of these con-
ditions, and, the routes no doubt showing up with as much dis-
tinctness on their air photographs as on ours, they were able to train
their guns with devastating precision. Hence our casualties among
transport and troops moving up to the line were heavy, and the dead
mules which lined the Menin Road and the corduroy road east of
Hellfire Corner were dumb witnesses of the difficulties and dangers
of getting ammunition and supplies anywhere near the trenches.
The attack on Broodseinde Ridge was the opening phase of that
stage of the Third Battle of Ypres, which resulted in the capture of
Passchendaele by the Canadians. That section of the front on which
the Ist Battalion operated was about 1000 yards south of the village
of Broodseinde itself. A road follows the crest of the ridge down
from the village of Passchendaele to Becelaere, where it turns south-
west to join the famous Menin Road. During their occupation of
this part of Belgium the Germans had laid along the road a light
railway, traces of which survived the shelling and enabled the
attacking troops to locate themselves. Although of great strategical
importance, the Broodseinde Ridge is barely 200 feet above sea-level,
and its crest is not sharply defined. But from it a wide view is
obtained over the low-lying country to the cast right over to the
village of Moorsledc, where the land begins to rise again. On its
eastern side the ridge slopes gradually down to Celtic Wood, which in
1917 was nothing but a collection of gaunt shell-tom tree-trunks
standing among flooded shell holes.
In the attack on this ridge the first objective (known as the
Red Line) was a system of trenches and strongpoints not more than
1917—October.


500 yards from the British advanced posts and about 200 yards
below Broodseinde Road. The second objective (or the Blue Line)
was approximately 500 yards further on, well down the farther
slope of the hill and overlooking Celtic Wood. Those were the days
of limited objectives and intense barrages.
As compared with that of the Hindenburg Line, the barbed wire
in this area was inconsiderable, but probably on no portion of the
front had the Germans expended so much labour and energy in the
construction of concrete shelters, known to the troops (on account of
their square regular design) as "pill boxes.” The ground advanced
over by the Ist Brigade was thickly dotted with these pill boxes.
Some stood out boldly on the skyline, whilst others allowed just
their tops to project above the ground level. Being several feet in
thickness, they were almost impervious to the heaviest shell fire, and
eighteen pounder shells rattled as harmlessly against them as peas
from a pea-shooter. Their very impregnability, however, was the
undoing of the Germans. When the British barrage fell, the enemy,
with the exception of a few machine-gunners, who maintained a
very precarious and nerve-racking existence above ground, retreated
into their shelters, and naturally were in no hurry to leave them.
Before they could make up their minds to venture out, the attacking
troops were upon them. The shelters were not organised for defence,
and the only alternatives were to die like rats in a trap or surrender.
The result of all this was that the German casualties in killed were
comparatively slight—probably, as Ludendorff claims, less than our
own—but their losses in prisoners were correspondingly great.
During the night of October 3/4, the Brigade Intelligence
officers laid tapes just forward of the line of posts and trenches
occupied by the 2nd Battalion, completing the task about 2 a.m.
The Ist Battalion began to move up from Westhock by Jabber
Track about 2.30 a.m., reaching the assembly position about 4 a.m.
The troops moved in single file with intervals between sections in
order to minimise the effect of shell fire. The night was dark and
rain had fallen earlier, accentuating the already great muddiness of
the ground. The depression between Anzac and Broodseinde Ridges
was an absolute quagmire, and very difficult to negotiate even in the
day time. Several casualties from shell fire were sustained on the
way, and, among others, Lieut. McKell, of B. Company, was killed
as he was bringing up his platoon. It was not until 5 a.m. that the
Battalion was finally in position, awaiting zero hour, which had been
fixed for 6 a.m. The enemy appeared to be on the alert, for orange-
colored flares were sent up incessantly and frequent bursts of machine-
gun fire swept No Man’s Land. (It was subsequently ascertained
that the Germans themselves contemplated an attack and had massed
troops in their front line with that object in view.) The 6th
1917—October.


Battalion had meanwhile taken up a position on our left flank, and
the 4th Battalion extended the attacking line to the right.
At 5.30 the enemy laid down a heavy barrage on our front line
and the low ground immediately behind it, while at the same time
he searched the rear areas with his long-range guns. The 2nd Bat-
talion suffered severely and the Ist Battalion casualties also were
heavier at this stage than in the attack itself. The men were moved
forward a little distance into No Man’s Land in order to escape the
rain of shells, but not before some valuable lives were lost. It was
then that Major P. L. Howell-Pricc, D. 5.0., M.C., terminated his
gallant career. Together with several men of his company and
2nd Lieut. Parry, he was buried by a shell and his body was never
recovered, or at any rate, identified. The enemy shelling lasted half
an hour when, punctually at 6 o’clock, a terrific British barrage
opened, and almost immediately silenced it, though, unfortunately,
only temporarily. It was with a feeling of relief that the Battalion
moved forward to the cluster of pill boxes which crowned the slight
elevation forming a kind of false crest to the main ridge some 100
yards or so from the “hopping off” line, Lieut. Bennett, a popular
officer of B. Company, was killed shortly after zero by a German
sniper, on whom, however, summary vengeance was executed by
the advancing troops.
When our barrage fell the enemy had followed his usual practice
of withdrawing to the shelter of his dug-outs. Consequently little
resistance was encountered by the first wave, consisting of two com-
panies of the 3rd Battalion. According to the plan of attack, the two
rear companies of the 3rd were to “mop up” the captured ground.
Owing to the eagerness of the men to press forward, however, this
task was incompletely carried out, and when Lieut.-Colonel Stacy
proceeded to enter a pill box on the minor ridge mentioned above
with the object of establishing his headquarters, he was greeted by
an unexpected bomb from the Germans lurking within and slightly
wounded. A single Mills grenade was sufficient to end such futile
resistance. Great numbers of Germans were rooted out of their
shelters and sent to the rear as prisoners. It was impossible to provide
escorts for them all, and many wandering on to adjoining sectors
were added to the bag of other units. Not a few also perished by
their own artillery, which heavily shelled all the tracks leading back
to the Menin Road.
The task of the 3rd Battalion was to capture the first objective
and consolidate it, whilst the Ist and 4th passed through and went
on to take the final objective. The barrage remained stationary in
front of the Red Line after its capture by the 3rd, and allowed the
Ist and 4th to form up in attack formation, they having moved in
1917—October.


artillery formation up to this point. At about 10 minutes past
eight the barrage lifted and the two battalions moved forward to
the capture of the second objective, which was accomplished according
to programme, without any serious opposition.
In the course of the action the whole of the attacking line bore
to the left, and all units consequently failed to occupy the exact posi-
tions assigned to them in the operation orders. On the left the Ist
became mixed up with the 6th Battalion, and on the right the 4th
was entangled with the 2nd Gordons. Several Highlanders lost
touch with their regiment and were temporarily attached to different
platoons of the Ist. The confusion that resulted is vividly illustrated
by the fact that no fewer than 14 British and Australian units were
represented in the casualties that passed through the Ist Brigade
R.A.P.’s during the 24 hours following zero.
Immediately after the capture of the final objective, the con-
solidation of the position was commenced. It was found necessary
in some places to move somewhat further down the forward slope
of the ridge than was originally intended, and B. Company's left
post, marking the left flank of the Battalion, was in an especially
exposed position. It was impossible to reach it except over ground
constantly harassed by machine-guns and snipers. Lieut. Tudehope
received a machine-gun bullet through the arm while in the trench,
and several runners were sniped. The work of the runners, stretcher-
bearers and signallers was especially strenuous owing to the lack of
communication trenches. Not only were the enemy machine-guns
and snipers very active, but the German artillery began shelling their
own original front line shortly after zero, moving backwards and
forwards from there to the Blue Line. Among those killed by this
shelling were Sgt. Bellchambers, an old Battalion identity, and Sgt.
Vial, who had seen service on the Peninsula and had only recently
rejoined. Signaller H. Luders, of D. Headquarters Signallers, was
killed just outside Battalion Headquarters, whilst mending broken
telephone wires with his usual coolness and skill. The hostile shelling
continued till about midnight on the 4/sth, when it slackened and
remained desultory throughout the 5 th. On the morning of the sth
several German planes flew low over our lines, and Lewis and Vickers
machine-guns were fired at them ineffectually. One German pilot
was observed to lean over and coolly wave a washout.
During the attack the R.A.P. was established by the R.M.0.,
Major Cook, in a pill box situated in the first objective, a little to the
left of Remus Wood. For the first 24 hours the doctor and his staff
were kept very busy. The wounded could not all be accommodated
under cover, and several poor fellows were killed by shell fire whilst
lying on stretchers in the trench awaiting their turn to be carried to

the rear. Those who were there that day may remember one man
whose arm, blown off at the shoulder, was lying on the stretcher
beside him. He smoked a cigarette with grim fortitude while waiting
for the M.O. to attend to him, but was again hit—this time fatally—
before his turn came.
The sth was spent in consolidating the captured position.
Although the hostile artillery fire had slackened considerably, several
casualties occurred in the front line and among the ration parties
using the Jabber Track. The transport limbers were unable to get
further forward than Westhoek Ridge, but even the roads west of
this point were heavily shelled, and the task of the Transport Officer,
Lieut. F. Griffiths, was an arduous and dangerous one. The work
of the Battalion transport generally on that day was worthy of all
praise.
By the sth everyone was feeling exhausted and suffering from
lack of sleep, as proper rest had been out of the question since the
night of the Ist/2nd. The 12th Battalion was therefore very wel-
come when, after a long and trying march in the dark, it came up
to take over the line on the night of the sth. The relief was com-
pleted by 11 p.m. The companies moved out independently, re-
turning by Jabber Track to Westhoek Ridge with intervals between
sections. From Westhoek the various parties proceeded via Birr
Cross Roads and Halfway House to Chateau Segard, which the last
party reached about dawn. A hot meal was served out to the men,
and everybody took a well-earned rest. But it was not destined to
be a long one, for on the 7th the Battalion was sent back to Westhoek
Ridge on fatigue duty.
Considering the duration of the action, the casualties sustained
in the capture of Broodseindc Ridge were very severe. The number
of men of the Ist actually engaged was little over 500, and of these
299 became casualties. Two officers were killed, two reported
missing and five wounded. Of other ranks 58 men were killed, 41
reported missing, and 191 wounded. It seemed a heavy price to pay
for a few hundred yards of ground. No doubt the “Heads” knew
what they were about and had weighty strategical reasons to advance.
After the Battalion was relieved on October 6, Licut.-Colonel
Stacy was evacuated, and Major Mackenzie assumed command.
After a couple of days at Westhoek, supplying carrying and digging
parties, the Battalion returned to Chateau Segard, and then entrained
for Patricia Lines, where we remained training and refitting until
October 25. Then we moved off to the Canal area, near Ypres.
The strength had fallen from 31 officers and 640 other ranks on
October 1, to 22 officers and 463 other ranks on October 31. During
the whole time in rest the Battalion had been severely bombed, which

detracted considerably from the value of the spell which everyone
needed. Lieut.-Colonel Stacy rejoined the unit while it was in reserve
in Esplanade Sap, shortly before we relieved the 10th, who were in
support at Anzac House, the notable spot where the Australian flag
was flown after its capture by the 2nd Division. Anzac House was
a big concrete pill box which sheltered Headquarters, but there was
little accommodation for the men except in the open and what they
devised for themselves. After a short tour in the line in front of
Zonnebekc, where mud and wet were the predominating features of
our stay, we moved out on November 11 along the Zonnebeke-Ypres
Road, partaking on the way of the welcome cocoa from the Comforts
Stall.
1917—November.


CHAPTER FOURTEEN.
THE WINTER OF 1917-1918.
VERY ONE was glad to hear of a good spell in the back
gS||g||g|| area. We commenced the march out of the turmoil of
battle from Halifax Camp on November 13, the route
being through Berthcn, near Staple, Heuringhcm, St.
lr^ gMea *rc) Pierre, Becourt, to Verlingthun, near Samer, which was
reached on November 19. A pleasant month was spent here, though
the billets were sometimes not all that could have been desired by
weary soldiers, and the Battalion was so scattered that the holding
of social gatherings was not much indulged in. This area was
quite a new one to us all, and it was the only occasion on which
we were billeted so far back as to be in close touch with Boulogne
and Etaples. But by December 17 we were back near the front,
at Rossignol Camp near Kemmel. And, to add to our miseries, the
winter frost had set in in earnest.
Here Christmas was spent, and was kept up as far as possible
in the good old style, with good dinners and music and dancing
in the evening. But it was very, very cold; the ice on the moat
around the old chateau was thick enough to skate on, and snow
covered the ground everywhere. The roads were so slippery that
the horses could not get a grip, and studs had to be put on their feet.
The picture show was not a bad one, and was well patronised by
the troops, and the “Kookaburras,” the First Division concert party,
played in conjunction with it. The concert party was in existence
for some months. It was composed of some really good artists, and
proved a boon to the men when out of the line. Lieut.-Colonel
Stacy returned from leave shortly after Christmas, and reassumed
command, Major Mackenzie leaving for a senior officers’ training
school in England.
On December 31 the Battalion moved into the trenches, taking
over the sector bounded by the Roozebcck on the right and Hollebeke
on the left, Headquarters being at Onraet Farm, with an advanced
headquarters post in The Ravine. The line consisted merely of an
unconnected series of small posts which were all very much exposed.
No movement was possible at all during the daytime, the men then
taking refuge in the pill boxes, and there Were no proper trenches,
1917—Novembet-December.


except for one post, some of the sentry posts being situated behind
a tree or a small mound. The enemy’s posts were some hundreds of
yards distant, across a No Man’s Land that was a sea of muddy
swamp. Two companies were in the line, one in support in The
Ravine, and one in reserve. Food and material were easily supplied
as far as The Ravine by the Dccauvillc tram line, and from there
they had to be carried to the companies. The usual work of im-
proving trenches went on, both in the front line and in support,
and in the early part of the tour the frozen ground had to be pierced,
though in the thaw that followed it became far too soft for comfort.
A special party, a working platoon, was detailed for the digging
work, though the line companies were responsible for their own
trenches.
With the exception of a few patrol encounters, there was
nothing exceptional to mark the tour, except one unfortunate in-
cident. Just before D. Company was to be relieved, a patrol, under
Lieut. L. M. Bull, had succeeded in approaching an enemy post near
the pill box known as The Giant, and some of the patrol had worked
round to the rear of the post, when the enemy opened fire. The
patrol scattered, and all succeeded in getting away except Lieut. Bull,
who was covered by a sentry a few yards distant. The remainder
made towards our lines, coming in on the right, although they had
gone out on the left. Sgt. D. H. Scott made his way up the course
of the Roozcbeck, and Sgt. Beynon, an experienced n.c.0., and Pte,
Mansell were seen approaching by our right post and challenged.
They gave the answer, but for some reason were suspected of being
Germans, and were fired on. In this area the enemy had used our
passwords and they had been changed every day, so that there was
a likelihood that our men would not remember them all. Towns
in N.S.W. were in fashion, and a man going to the front line on
being challenged gave the password as “Bathurst, Nyngan, Dubbo,
Bourkc,” the last being the actual word for the night, the others
having been used on previous nights. This would satisfy the sentry,
and the answer would probably be "All right. Dig.; through ticket.”
But when Beynon and Maxwell were fired on they did not stop to
argue about towns, but cleared out in the opposite direction, with the
result that the Germans took them prisoners. In the meantime Lieut.
Bull had wriggled away, and afterwards had the unenviable experi-
ence of passing one whole day behind the enemy’s post, another in
front of their wire, and another in No Man’s Land, reaching our
lines on the third evening much to the Battalion’s joy. His only
food during this period had been a turnip picked up in No Man’s
Land. In the early part of each night there had been a bright moon,
which had effectually prevented his moving until just before dawn.
And Lieut. Bull had picked up a lot of valuable information while
1917—December.


so intimately associated with the enemy post, which was made full
use of. This experience, it must be remembered, took place in the
middle of winter, and the officer suffered for it with a bad attack
of trench feet, but otherwise was not affected by his long exposure
and close call.
On January 22 the Battalion was relieved, and moved into
support behind Wytschacte Ridge, spending a week there before
going to Mcteren for a rest, where everyone was comfortable, and
many will to-day be able to look back upon that spell as one of
our happiest experiences. Picture shows and concerts were handy,
both in Mcteren and in Bailleul, and many football matches were
played. The first of these gigantic tussles was the famous struggle,
Officers v. N.C.O.'s Then there was a Divisional competition,
fought out first in the different Brigades, which the Battalion had
the honor of winning, and annexing a cup which was greatly
treasured. Perhaps it were as well also to recall the epic match, in
which Brigadier-General Brand kicked off, when the Battalion team
administered a beating to the doughty men of the 13 th Battalion.
The officers, though unable to have a regular mess, found a room in
which they could foregather, where they spent many happy evenings,
enabling them to become well acquainted with each other, for during
the continual tours in the line they had had little opportunity of
knowing anyone outside their own particular companies.
During this rest photographs were taken, mementoes being
obtained of the officers, n.c.o.’s and the band, and the Brigade boxing
competition, which aroused a great deal of interest, was decided.
No. 11 Platoon winning the platoon competition. There was also
a Brigade competition at Tilques, which was won by the 2nd Bat-
talion platoon. In fact, there was plenty to interest everyone all
the time, not the least exciting day being that on which a big German
plane came down in a field near the Meteren-Bailleul Road.
Little did any of us think then that within three months the
town of Meteren would be occupied by the enemy, and that the
Battalion would be fighting to regain those billets and playing fields.
1918—January-February.


CHAPTER FIFTEEN.
THE SHREWSBURY FOREST SECTOR.
■T was in March, 1918, that the Battalion moved to the
line, relieving the 52nd in the Shrewsbury Forest sector.
Battalion Headquarters being at Index House. A. and B.
Companies went into the line in that order from the right,
the line running through Bulgar Wood and consisting of
isolated posts in the mud in very low ground.
The greater part of that month could be described as “quiet,”
for apart from an occasional patrol there was little excitement. Many
would have welcomed a little more movement to distract attention
from the unpleasant concomitants of life in the line. Communication
with the rear was possible only by night, though the country was
overlooked from the support trenches in the hill at the rear. Bulgar
Wood itself was merely a collection of bare tree trunks and logs,
and the line was held only as an outpost line, but as No Man’s Land
was impassable for any big body of troops, there was not much
danger of a concerted attack.
The sector was very like the Somme front of 1916 as regards
mud, and much hard work had to be done in digging new trenches
and constructing strong points—all labor in vain as it turned out.
Moreover, conditions were rendered perpetually unpleasant by the
sporadic, but frequent gas shelling by the Germans, and work was
continually being suspended while gas masks were being donned.
Patrolling was a difficult matter, though it was constantly
carried out. One patrol, under Lieut. S. R. Traill, tried to secure
enemy prisoners from a post, but that night it was found to be
unoccupied. On the same night Lieut. F. P. Shannon and one of
the men were wounded by our own shrapnel, and there were other
instances of short shooting, for which there seems to be no permanent
remedy. As a rule, the artillery declared that short shooting was
impossible. A German attack was expected somewhere along the
front, and there were many alarms and stand-to orders, besides heavy
barrages, both on our part and on that of the enemy, but no attack
came off on our front.

Gas was our greatest trouble, and the Battalion had a severe
experience throughout with gas shells. The Gas N.C.O.’s had a deli-
pate and dangerous part to play, and in this connection too much praise
cannot be given to the Battalion Gas N.C.0., Corporal Rockstroh,
for his indefatigable work in visiting gas affected areas. Conscien-
tiously he went about sniffing for gas in all suspected quarters, and
his very zeal led to his being gassed himself, and the men being left
to the protection of their own less sensitive noses. This was at
Hill 60, where the corporal was gassed after an exceptionally heavy
shelling.
The Brigade Gas Officer, Lieut. K. H. McConnel (of the Ist
Battalion), was continually being called upon for advice, and this
meant a personal inspection of the suspected spot. Men were not
safe in entering shelters near which gas shells had fallen hours before,
for any clothes hanging up would be heavily impregnated and would
affect anyone who entered. The authorities were particularly strict
on the gas shell question, and warnings had to be given as to the
position of fallen gas shells to all and sundry, a task that was by
no means easy. The necessity of the precaution was fully realised,
but company officers and the adjutant had a sleepless time, and the
Brigade-Major suffered as well.
On March 11 the Battalion was relieved by the 3rd. We moved
into support, Headquarters being accommodated in Larchwood
Tunnels, with C. and D. Companies, some of whom were in Hill 60,
and A. and B. Companies in Ravine Wood. Most of the Battalion
were engaged continually in the forward area, digging and improving
trenches, and the enemy shelling, though intermittent, was increasing,
mostly heavy calibre stuff being used. On March 17 the area was
shelled heavily from 5 p.m. until midnight with gas. Fortunately,
as most of the men were underground, the casualties were light.
But, unfortunately, the full effect of gas does not show for a
considerable time, and casualties cannot be estimated amongst those
evacuated. Many men were very hoarse for some time.
The 4th Battalion took over our posts on March 20, and after
marching out to the Spoil Bank, the Battalion was conveyed by
light railway to Ridge Wood camp, not far from Dickebusch Lake.
Here, in reserve, the troops revelled for a few days in the comparative
ease and cleanliness of good dry huts. Large parties were still
required for working, though everyone was able to get a bath during
our stay. Perhaps the pleasantest memory of this spell was the
receipt of a gift of money from the Battalion Comforts Fund in
Sydney. It was expended in buying the luxury of vegetables, which
everyone appreciated to the full, as they did the bottle of beer for
every man. It bucked up all hands wonderfully to think of the
1918—Match.


never-tiring ladies of the Fund, always working to provide comforts
that were very real comforts in those strenuous days, and filling us
all with the reflection that we were not being forgotten at home.
They were really happy days, despite the fact that the gas had made
the majority of the men so hoarse that conversation was a series of
husky whispers.
It was here, on March 23, that disquieting rumours of the big
German attack came through. Stories from the south included the
well-nigh incredible report that the enemy had recaptured Lagnicourt,
Bapaume, Mametz and other places, and rumours were soon flying
on every hand as to our probable movements. Then other troops
began to move, and the countryside, from an area thronged with men,
began to wear a deserted appearance. It was stated that our 4th
Division was on its way to the Somme, and when, on the last day
of March, wc were ordered to hold ourselves in readiness for a move,
no one was surprised.
We were told to travel light, baggage was cut down to a
minimum, and many a "souvenir king” suffered bitter pangs as he
saw his surplus kit whisked off to the tender mercies of Second
Echelon, to be restored to him (if he were lucky) after many days.
With a strength of 36 officers and 712 other ranks, the Battalion
moved to Reninghelst, into filthy camps and billets. Here a few
days were spent in training and route marches. On April 5 the
Battalion moved by route march to Berthen, where we occupied the
same billets as during the march up from Petit-Sec-Bois to the salient
in 1917. The same night the Battalion marched on to Godewaers-
velde, where the troops entrained after a hot meal at the station in
the early hours of April 6. The train did not leave until about
7 o’clock, and by 10.30 a.m. had only reached the outskirts of Calais.
After a weary journey, St. Roch, a suburb of Amiens, was reached
about dusk. But the toil of the day was not over. Immediately
after detraining the Battalion was formed up in fours and marched
off through outlying suburbs to the village of Allonvillc, about eight
miles distant. Who docs not recall the yeoman service done by
Padre Prickctt with his accordeon in cheering the leading fours and
keeping the weary soldiers in step?
At Allonville the men were accommodated in a large barn, and
here Major Mackenzie rejoined us. During his absence Captain
L. N. Edgley and Captain C. B. Withy had acted as second in
command. At Allonville everyone was in a state of suspense. It
was known that the position in the line was critical, and the number
of refugees and battle stragglers in the adjacent villages told its own
story. These crowds showed how greatly things had altered since
1918—March.


our last sojourn. That wc should be thrown into the line to support
or relieve our own Australian divisions was confidently expected.
But wc were not destined for the Somme. Our first move, after
a few days’ training, was to Molliens-au-Bois, a few miles off, a
typical mud-built Somme village, remarkable for nothing but the
wretchedness of the billets and the misery of its refugee-swamped
inhabitants. Then on April 11 an unexpected order put the
Battalion in motion again, towards Amiens. Leaving Molliens at
2.30 p.m., we proceeded by route march to the Blind Asylum at
Amiens, where the troops were billeted for the night, and here two
incidents are worthy of note.
Everyone was impressed by the changed state of Amiens. The
town was almost deserted, and business was at a standstill. Even
the estaminets were in the same parlous state, and at “Charley’s Bar”
it was necessary to flounder along dark passages into the cellar to
quench one’s thirst. But the Hospital for the Blind was empty and
proved a comfortable billet, with mattresses for most of us. It
proved an excellent target for German bombing ’planes, which made
the night rather exciting; but casualties were slight, only one or two
men being wounded. The next morning the Battalion was marched
to the railway station at St. Roch, where, after some delay, it was
entrained.
The train moved off about 2.30, and reached St. Pol at dusk.
The environs of the station were subjected to heavy bombing by the
German ’planes. The engine had been taken off, but the bombs
fell thickly, and some were close enough to wound a few men of the
Transport Section, in the rear of the train. It was an unpleasant
situation because of our helplessness to do anything and the proba-
bility of more bombs at any moment: but it was all in the ciay’s
work, and our men consoled themselves with the thought that Fritz
was probably getting as good as he gave from our 'planes. Our
departure was delayed for several hours, but finally at 10 p.m. we
got away, and at dawn on April 13 reached Hondeghem within a
few kilometres of Hazebrouck. Here all surplus gear was dumped,
and the Battalion pushed on without delay towards the front.
To understand this sudden return to the north, and the doings
of the Battalion during the next few months, it is necessary to
review briefly the general situation. The enemy, in spite of the
initial successes of March 21 and the following days, had gradually
been checked. Their dash for Amiens had been held up, and the
attack lost its original force. On the Somme attack opening,
the northern front had been thinned of troops and was very
lightly held. On April 9 the enemy attacked in the north and
succeeded in breaking the line and penetrating many miles. Many
1918—April.


towns which had long lain behind our lines and were familiar to
our men, who had so often visited them out of the line, fell to the
enemy, Armentieres among them, and by April 13 the enemy had
penetrated as far as Bailleul, though no one was actually clear as to
where the line really was.
So here we were, once more pushing into the thick of the fray.
1918—April.


CHAPTER SIXTEEN.
THE DEFENCE OF HAZEBROUCK.
T midday on April 13 the Battalion reached Pradelles, a
small village a couple of miles west of Strazeele, which
at that time had not been shelled, although it was well
within range of the German guns. It was only to be
expected, however, that as soon as enemy ’planes observed
the presence of troops the village would get a pretty hot presentation
from the 5.9’5. So it was deemed safer to bivouac the troops in the
fields round about. While the men were settling down in their
positions, the senior officers rode forward to reconnoitre the front
line, or rather, the most forward positions, for at this stage the front
line wavered uncertainly, as the patrols of the two armies were, in
most places, gingerly advancing towards each other. Not everywhere
were they doing it gingerly, however, and it was on this occasion
that a battalion of Germans, marching blithely in fours down the
Vieux Berquin Road towards Strazeele, came under the fire of the
3rd Battalion, and hastily assumed the formation proper to open
warfare.
The shelling of Pradelles commenced on April 14. The first
shell crashed through the roof of the church in the heart of the
village, and as Battalion Headquarters was in a house opposite, there
was no undue pessimism in anticipating that the next shell would
find its billet there. Headquarters did not make a dignified exit in
fours down the main street, but, moved by a common impulse, melted
away like the morning mist, through back gardens, hedges, and by
other devious routes, to reassemble in the cellar of the local brewery,
in a manner that suggested that the brains of the Battalion had a
sort of sense of perfect security down there among the casks. "On
April 15 desultory shelling by the enemy did some damage in the
transport and inflicted some casualties, but lines of defence were
constructed, preparations for an advance were made, iron rations
were overhauled, and all equipment was cleaned up. The company
commanders conferred with the C. 0., but it appeared, from the
uncertain nature of the affair going on in front, the extent of the
advance could not be determined beforehand. Hence the proceedings
partook somewhat of the nature of open warfare, in which every
officer over the rank of lieutenant is mounted—or ought to be.
1918—April.


On the morrow, accordingly, for the first time in the history of the
Battalion, we would see our company commanders going into battle
on their chargers, like their forefathers at Agincourt and Malplaquet.
The strategy of both sides in this northern theatre of war
centred just then round Strazeele. Just as our other divisions further
south were opposing the advance on Amiens, so in the north the
task of the Ist Division was to prevent the capture of the important
railhead of Hazebrouck, so that the high ground around Strazeele
must first be acquired by an army which had Hazebrouck as its
objective. Although the hill of Strazeele was barely 200 ft. above
sea-level, it was considerably more elevated than the surrounding
country, commanding fairly extensive views to cast and west, hence
its importance to either side as a strategic point.
When the Division had returned from the Somme front, the
3rd and 4th Battalions had proceeded direct to the line, and were
now in entrenched positions east of Strazeele. For some time after
the commencement of their drive against Hazebrouck the Germans
had been moving forward, delayed only by the gallant rearguard
actions of some of the British units, such as the sth Scottish Rifles,
whose splendid conduct in the midst of what was practically a
debacle has not been sufficiently recognised, at least by Australians.
Too much was afterwards said about the bodies of stragglers
encountered by us on our way into the line, and not enough of the
many little groups of Tommies who, frequently without any leader,
were still maintaining a stubborn resistance when the Ist Australian
Division took over the front. On our own Battalion sector the
bodies of several British soldiers were found beside little mounds of
empty cartridge cases, which clearly showed what that retreat had
been. It was freely argued at the time that Metercn might have been
entered by the Australians without opposition, but, as a matter of
fact, neither side knew precisely where the enemy was, or even how
matters stood on the flanks. French troops were at this time hurried
to this front, including the 32nd Regiment of Chasseurs-Alpins,
whose sturdy and soldierly appearance made a great impression upon
the Australians.
The general idea of the operations on April 16 was that the
Ist Battalion, pivoting on the left flank of the 4th, should swing
forward so far as was necessary to maintain touch with the right
flank of a French battalion which, we were given to understand, was
to make a forward movement with the object of driving the Germans
back and, if possible, of recapturing Bailleul. Late in the afternoon
of that day we advanced to the attack, adopting artillery formation
in traversing the few kilometres that lay between Pradelles and
Strazeele, and for troops in battle order it was pretty heavy going
1918—April.


across the newly-ploughed fields. The Lewis gunners, with their
ammunition panniers, probably had as hard a time as any of us.
Nothing happened until the men began to cross the skyline over the
hill of Strazeele and came under the observation of the Germans.
A heavy barrage was immediately laid down by the enemy, which
did a lot of damage, and incidentally caused the company commanders
to dismount hastily and send their horses to the rear. One shell
unluckily fell among B. Company and killed Lieut. R. G. Humphreys,
who had come through unscathed from Gallipoli, with several of
his platoon.
By the time the ridge was crossed it was quite dark, and every-
one agreed that it was high time the French put in their promised
appearance. But not a Frenchman was to be seen, and the 4th
Battalion, through whose lines, not to mention many ditches and
hedges, we passed, reported that they also had not seen one of our
blue-coated Allies. Somebody appeared to have blundered, though
it was never made clear who was to blame. Some said the French
had attacked independently and had been repulsed. Others were
equally emphatic that they had never attacked at all, and did not
intend to. At all events, when day broke we found the 32nd
Chausseurs in a more or less unorganised position on our left flank,
and from then on the characteristic bark of the 75’s became a daily
and familiar sound.
Meanwhile things had become somewhat mixed. The original
plan of attack having fallen through, some sort of measures had to
be taken on the spot. One of the straggling line of farm-houses
forming the hamlet of Moolenacker was selected as Battalion Head-
quarters, and the C.O. set to work to get the Battalion into position
and establish his flanks. It was soon discovered that if there was a
decided lack of Frenchmen on our sector there was at any rate a
battalion of sth Scottish Rifles, who, having had a long and
strenuous period in the line, were very thankful for the relief when
they saw the Australians coming up. The British posts, consisting
of hastily-constructed and unwired trenches, were taken over and
distributed among our companies, who were all in position by day-
light. The right company, under Capt. Somerset, M.C., linked up
with the 4th Battalion, and occupied the group of farm-houses known
as Nord Hoek, near Merris, which was in German hands. To reach
Capt. Somerset’s headquarters one followed the road from Moole-
nacker, which led past Estaminct Corner, but the journey could
never be described as pleasant, for, in addition to the fact that the
enemy intermittently traversed that highway with his guns, the
pigs and cattle killed by the shell-fire of the past few days were
beginning to make their presence felt in no uncertain manner. The
left line company, under Capt. Bootle, M.C., extended in a chain
1918—April.


of posts to the hop-fields down by Meteren Becque, the extreme post
being within a few hundred yards of the Meteren baths. The enemy
artillery fire on April 16 had not been particularly heavy, but on
the following day the whole area was subjected to an intensive
bombardment that was notable for the havoc wrought by heavy
trench mortars. A counter-attack was also directed against our
forward posts, but was easily repulsed by rifle and Lewis gun fire.
The Battalion now settled down to what, from a purely military
point of view, was a very interesting phase of warfare. The country
in which we were operating was practically virgin soil so far as the
war was concerned. True it had been marched over, and a few
cavalry and rearguard actions had been fought there in 1914, but
the tide of war had rolled some distance away during the intervening
years, and, save for the booming of the heavies and the continual
procession of billeted troops, this countryside had not felt the effects
of invasion to any great degree. But now, as a result of the German
advance that had begun in March, 1918, the prosperous farm-houses
and fertile lands around Meteren and Merris suddenly found them-
selves in the heart of the battle. The unfortunate inhabitants had
scarcely time to get away with their personal belongings, so sudden
and overwhelming had been the disaster. Those who had been able
to load the farm cart with a few household possessions had been
among the fortunate ones, but for the most part the cattle had been
left in the byres and the pigs in the pens. The accumulated savings
and household gods of generations—and the wealth of some of these
modest looking farm-houses was really remarkable—were abandoned
to destruction by shell-fire or plunder by enemy or Allied soldiery.
The plight of the animals was especially pathetic. Uncared for and
unfed, they wandered distractedly between the lines until a shell or
bullet mercifully ended their sufferings. In some instances milch
cows were looked after by the troops, who thus enjoyed the unwonted
luxury of fresh milk in the front line. Some of the farm-houses
contained cellars well stocked with champagne and cognac, but
where such hoards were discovered, the precious liquid was either
poured out upon the ground or handed over to be used for medicinal
purposes.
Many of the Battalion will remember a dog which had been
left behind at the farm where the R.A.P. was established at Moole-
nacker. He was a big, black, short-haired animal of the hound type,
and had been employed to turn the wheel operating the churn by
trotting at a steady pace in the wheel in order to keep a normal
position. The frequent shelling had so terrified the creature that it
cowered in the cellar all day, exhibiting every symptom of shell-shock.
Occasionally it would come up, and from sheer force of habit would
drive the churn furiously for several minutes, and then rush back to
1918—April.


the cellar in obvious terror. Such dumb suffering was almost as
moving as the agonies suffered by the wretched refugees.
The Battalion remained in position until April 22, when, after
being relieved by the 5 th, we marched to Thieushouk, a small village
north of Fletre, for a short spell. During this first period in the
line we concentrated every effort on obtaining identification of the
Germans opposite by observation and small raids, and this knowledge
proved very useful later on when we participated in the successful
daylight raids of July, which gained the Ist Australian Division
no small renown.
Thieushouk is mainly to be remembered by an enormous hole
in one of the adjoining fields, caused apparently by an aeroplane
bomb. We settled down there, and celebrated Anzac Day with
sports and a football match. Here, too, on April 26 there was a
demonstration of the new rifle grenade discharger, the adaptation of
the Mills grenade to the rifle making a great deal of difference from
the old method of carrying various types of bombs and the attach-
ments to use with them. Next night the whole Battalion had to
construct reserve trenches, the companies carrying out their tasks in
quick time, afterwards returning to billets. The rest, however,
proved all too short, for on April 28 advance parties began to move
again towards the line, and next day the Battalion relieved the 11th,
which was in support near Meteren. Headquarters was established
in a farm-house that had not been under shell fire, and even had a
good piano in it. Here we again heard the rapid barking of the
French 75’s, a battery being posted to our rear. Our work in
support consisted mainly in reconnoitring and improving trenches
and strong points. In a great part of this area the trenches in rear
were simply wide ditches about 3 ft. deep, which had apparently been
dug in a hurry by Engineers, or under their supervision, when it was
known that the enemy was advancing. They scarred the whole
countryside for miles, but were soon turned into ordinary fire
trenches, our strength at this time being 31 officers and 620 other
ranks. There were still cows to be found, and these were milked for
their own sakes and for that of the Battalion, while other food was
good and plentiful.
In fact, the period spent in this area for a few months may be
looked back upon as one of the happiest times of the war. The
countryside was all verdant, with growing crops, and it was possible
to move and look about under conditions far different from those of
the old trench, or semi-trench warfare. And, greatest boon of all,
there was no mud. The fighting itself was far less of the mechanical
type, and there was much more scope for initiative on the part of
the lower commanders in the posts. Last, but not least, the shell
1918—April.


fire was not nearly so heavy over the area, though there were certain
spots that would be well peppered every now and again. The
defence scheme was altered after a careful reconnaissance, new trenches
were dug, and new positions occupied by the companies.
On the night of May 3-4 the Battalion relieved the 2nd in the
line, A., B. and C. Companies going into the line in that order, from
the right, with D. in reserve. A small operation had to be carried
out, to conform with the French, on our left, who attacked at dawn
on May 4. Liaison with the French was something new, but proved
a very successful union, our troops mingling with the French in what
were called “international posts.” The operation, carried out by
C. Company, was the establishment of two new posts in advance
of the existing line. Lieut. W. H. Parkinson, with his platoon,
moved forward under cover of darkness and partially completed the
digging of the new post before dawn, withdrawing and leaving a
few men there, and re-occupying it at dawn, in conjunction with the
French advance, and completing the digging in daylight under enemy
fire.
The other new post, which was to be captured from the enemy,
lay behind a hedge. A reconnaissance was made by a patrol early
in the night, which had to retire with the loss of one man, and then
at dawn Lieut. H. H. Davis moved forward with his platoon, reached
the hedge, divided his men, rushed the post from both sides with
bombs and drove out the garrison, one of the Germans being found
dead in the post. Covering fire had been provided by the Lewis guns
and by a light trench mortar battery, while the artillery had shelled
the adjoining farms. Everything worked like clockwork, and the
operation was carried out without a single casualty. Members of
the Battalion will recall that a few days later an officer of the Royal
Air Force was compelled to land just in front of our lines, his
machine being burnt. He was prevented at the last moment from
walking over to the enemy lines by mistake.
The tour ended on May 9-10, when we were relieved by the
13th Battalion Yorks, and Lancs. Regiment, and set out in 'buses
from Caestre to Scrcus, which was reached at 5 a.m., for a fortnight’s
encampment. Everyone enjoyed a bathing parade later that day,
and the camp, a tented one, proved comfortable. Sports and compe-
titions were held here, D. Company winning the silver bugle for
the best company, with C. second. The Battalion also won the
Brigade football competition, beating the 3rd Battalion in the final.
We were back in the Moolenacker sector by May 19, already
well known to us, having taken over the trenches in the line from
the sth Battalion: and here patrolling was carried out regularly to
secure identification of the enemy. The crops that the refugees had
been forced to abandon were now quite high, and some of the
1918—May.


patrols went far afield; but the enemy became extremely wary in
such country. An organised small raid was ordered, and Lieut.
H. V. Chedgey, with a party from D. Company, carried it out. The
raiders were organised in two small columns, which, at a concerted
signal, were to rush the enemy’s trench at selected points. Un-
fortunately, one column lost its way in a wheat field, and while the
other was waiting for it to come up, the moon rose and disclosed the
raiders to the enemy. Immediately showers of stick-bombs were
thrown, wounding nearly every member of the party, including the
leader. When the survivors rushed the trench the Germans had fled,
pnd the party was forced to return to our lines without having
secured a prisoner for identification purposes.
Relief came on May 27-28, and the Battalion moved to a camp
near L’Egernest, arriving about 5 a.m. to be greeted by an enemy
high-velocity gun shelling the camp. There were a few casualties, and,
to everyone’s dismay, the breakfasts on the cookers were utterly
spoiled, by the showers of dirt. However, we made the best of things
and bivouacked in the trenches nearby, which accommodated a
strength of 26 officers and 722 other ranks. Owing to shelling
continuing, with an enemy ’plane passing over, we shifted camp to
another field, where we obtained a little more peace. Being shelled
was always far more distracting in back areas than it was in the line.
Enemy ’plane activity was very marked at this time, and they were
often to be seen thrown into high relief in the beams of the search-
lights which would follow them for a long time while the Archies
tried to hit them. A further spell followed at Sercus, and here
Brigadier-General W. B. Lcsslie, who had commanded the Brigade
since March, 1917, and was so well-known, left to command the
190th Brigade in the British Army. He was succeeded by Brigadier-
General I. G. Mackay, at that time commanding the Ist Machine-
Gun Battalion, and formerly the 4th Battalion.
The Battalion moved into its old sector in the line on June 8,
with the 9th Division (Scottish) on the left. About this time the
influenza scourge was making itself felt, and there were many evacua-
tions, nearly all the officers having a bout of it, while it seriously
affected both armies. Though there were few fatal cases in the
Battalion, those affected were not fit for duty again for some weeks.
Active patrolling was carried out nightly, but without obtaining any
identification of the enemy. An organised raid under Lieuts. W. M.
Blake and R. O. Samuels, with 36 men, found the enemy trench
unoccupied, and our foes seemed determined to avoid any contact.
They apparently did not occupy some of their front line trenches,
though men were occasionally seen there. There was wire in the
crops in front, and this proved an obstacle to raiding parties, more
especially as it was unexpected. On the night of the raid that was
1918—May-June.


rewarded by empty trenches, two sergeants of the King’s Liverpool
Regiment, who had been taken prisoner in the April attack, came
into our lines, after some days of hiding by day and moving by night.
They had escaped from Fleurbaix. They assured us that they had
seen the enemy making away from the front line during one of our
bombardments.
On June 18 the Battalion was relieved, and remained in support
and reserve until July 5. During this period the usual working
parties were supplied, training was carried out, and sports were held,
cricket having taken the place of football. We took over from the
12th Battalion a sector on the right of Strazeele, in the flat country
near the railway line, our strength being 34 officers and 753 other
ranks. The line consisted of scattered posts among the crops and
long grass, some of which contained only a few men each. These
were enlarged, and the number of posts was reduced to six, each
containing a platoon. This system was adopted wherever practic-
able. Small posts were in vogue with the enemy in this sector, and
their weakness will be seen from what follows.
Mention has been made of the fact that while in the line
patrolling had been actively carried out, but without success in
obtaining prisoners. These patrols worked at night, and it seemed
as if bad luck was dogging the Battalion, as other units were often
reported to have captured prisoners. But on July 11 our luck
changed. At this time B. and D. Companies were in the line, in
that order from the right, Capt. R. I. C. Macgregor, M.C., and
Capt. R. Somerset, M.C., being the company commanders. The
patrols had discovered that the enemy defences were mainly improved
shell-holes, and it was decided to attempt to capture some prisoners
by daylight. A patrol of three men under Lieut. C. R. Morley was
sent out, and crawled to a house in the enemy’s lines, which was
found to be empty. Returning, the patrol saw several enemy
machine-gun posts, and while two men were left, the other two
crawled behind the post and surprised the two men in it, capturing
them with a light machine-gun. The prisoners were handed over
to the two men who were waiting, and another post was surprised.
Four Germans and another machine-gun were soon ours. At first
the enemy showed fight, but soon gave in when fired on. When the
party was returning, another post was located, in which the enemy
was preparing to resist. Lieut. Morley rushed the post, wounded
several of the garrison, and captured eight men and another light
machine-gun. The prisoners were then sent back to our lines with
two of the party, and two more of our men replaced them. The
patrol got really busy then, and cleaned up every post in the vicinity,
returning to our lines after three and a half hours with a total bag
of 32 prisoners and three machine-guns. Another patrol from the
1918—June.


same company, consisting of three men under Lieut. G. E. Gaskell,
was at the same time operating in a similarly daring manner on the
right flank of the company sector. These men got behind the enemy’s
front line and worked up from the rear, cleaning up many posts
and capturing 36 prisoners and four machine-guns.
After the earlier posts had been captured, the noise roused the
enemy in the vicinity, and quick action was necessary, posts being
rushed individually and simultaneously. This action was so unex-
pected that the enemy were almost overpowered before they knew
what was happening. It was a brilliant series of sorties that will
always live in the history of the Battalion. The risk run by the
patrollers operating in enemy country, ignorant of the position of
other posts and of the supports, needs no stressing; yet our casualties
for this great piece of tactical work were nil. The Battalion on
the left had also succeeded in capturing posts, and the line was then
advanced from 200 to 300 yards to a much more favourable position.
Meanwhile B. Company had not been idle. A patrol had gone
out to reconnoitre a farm in the enemy's lines with a view to a
subsequent raid, and came across an enemy post, which was rushed,
seven prisoners being captured after a feeble resistance. As it was
necessary to advance B. Company’s line to conform with that of D.,
a platoon under Lieut. R. W. Sampson, M.C., was ordered to capture
an old farm-house, covering fire being given with rifle grenades and
Lewis guns from a post which had been captured on the left. The
enemy opened fire as the party approached, but the post was rushed
and captured without casualties, nine prisoners and two machine-guns
being taken. Patrols then worked towards other enemy posts on the
right, taking them in flank and rear, and a further 14 prisoners, with
another gun, were taken, while nine Germans were killed. Further
to the right another patrol had captured two prisoners and had killed
the remainder of a post, so that the grand total for the day’s work
was an advance of the greater part of the line for some hundreds of
yards, the killing of about 40 of the enemy, the capture of 100
prisoners and ten machine-guns, with only six of our men wounded.
Next day B. Company obtained a further success on its right
flank. Lieut. E. P. Laracy went out in the morning with a patrol,
and by tactics similar to those of the previous day, captured 28
prisoners and four machine-guns, clearing an area in front of our
lines for some 200 to 300 yards. Co-operation with a battalion of
the East Yorks, on our right was then arranged, the English troops
having the task of taking Tern Farm, while we were to assist by
fire and to advance at the same time. The attack proved successful,
but the enemy were waking up, and though B. Company made a
further advance and captured seven more prisoners, the “peaceful
1918—June.


penetration” had to end, and we were left to hold our advanced line.
Souvenirs of these raids were plentiful. German revolvers and glasses
were to be seen everywhere, but how they were all disposed of is
one of the dark mysteries of the Battalion’s history, for there were
never any to be found when it was against orders to have them.
The success of these operations put the men in great heart, for
though similar patrolling had been done by other units before, it
had not reached such dimensions, nor had it achieved so great a
measure of success, at least so far as was then known. The stunt
interested G.H.Q. greatly, and an officer was sent up to the Battalion
to discover at first hand the methods used. Some American officers
and men were attached to us for experience, and they, too, were most
interested in the proceedings.
After a couple of days in support at Pradelles, the Battalion
having moved there on the night of July 12-13, we had a pleasant
rest near La Kreule, north of Hazebrouck, having seen the last of
the line in the north—in fact, the last of any line so far as the mere
holding of it was concerned. The conditions of the last few months
had been good, compared with those of former years. While we
were in the line the life had more of interest and less of heavy shelling:
there was country to be looked at instead of a desert of mud; we
fought among villages in various stages of ruin from shell-fire and
amid farm-houses which gave good shelter in their cellars. And
when we were out of the line—though there were endless working
parties on defences in support —there were cricket matches and other
sports, and our training in reserve was never too severe.
All the same, the moves to and from the line Were carried on
without much break, so that there were never any really dull periods.
But, such is the soldier’s life, there were invariably more complaints
when the Battalion had been in the same place for some time with
good conditions, then ever there were when we were all cold and
miserable in the rain and mud of the front line.
On July 29 we marched to the Racquinghem area, and at this
time the Brigade was under two hours’ notice to move at any time
during the night. The Battalion strength was 28 officers and 741
other ranks, and with a river quite close to the camp, there was
plenty of swimming. Here C. Company won the competition for
the silver bugle and the Battalion had the distinction of winning the
Brigade sports cup. It was a week that will live in many memories.
1918—July.


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.
THE ADVANCE TO VICTORY.
HND now we come to the closing phases of the greatest
war that the world has ever known, those final months
of fierce fighting in which the Allied armies broke for all
time the ruthless military might of the armies of the
Prussian war lords. From the beginning of August,
1918, the Ist Battalion was in the thick of heavy fighting, and into
those final months was often crowded as much in one day as many
of the men had seen before in whole weeks. It is impossible in the
space of this brief history to crowd the hundreds of instances of
individual courage, the thousands of incidents that marked those days
on the Somme, and only a general outline can be given, to which
memory must, in the case of individuals, add the incidents that
impressed themselves upon the mind.
On August 5 the Battalion, with the rest of the Brigade, moved
towards the Somme, entraining at Arques, and detraining at Hangist.
From there ’buses took us to Vecquement, from where we marched
to Aubigny for a short rest, hiding on August 7 among the trees.
All movements had been by night, and no man was allowed to show
himself by day—a decided contrast to the practice in former big
engagements.
For August B—the “black day” for the Germans—an attack on
a big scale, with distant objectives, was in preparation. Prior to
this, on July 18, the French and Americans had turned on the enemy
in the salient on the Marne, and had driven them back after hard
fighting: but the Germans, by using their rearguards, had managed
to delay the attack sufficiently to allow the withdrawal of the bulk
of their army from the salient. This action was to be something
more, a real offensive, and it was to be carried out on lines different
from the methods of the last few years, with their limited objectives,
and more similar to those employed by the enemy on March 21. The
Brigade was attached to the 4th Division for this operation, and was
in reserve. The Battalion, under the command of Major A. K.
Mackenzie (the C.O. having gone for a few days to a machine-gun
school), moved into its assembly position at 3 a.m. with a strength
of 25 officers and 700 other ranks, the attack starting in a thick fog.
1918—August.


Our role was to move forward with it, and go where we would be
required. Many orders and counter-orders were received, and we
finished up at night between Morcourt and Cerisy. On the north
of the Somme the British attack had .been held up at Chipilly, and
it was necessary to protect the left flank of the units on the south.
To us was assigned this task, and on August 9 word was received
that a further attack was to be made on Chipilly. This attack seemed
to be held up, but as one of our patrols had already been in the
village, permission was given to send them over again to find out
what the position really was. This patrol consisted of C.Q.M.S.
Hayes, Sergt. (afterwards Lieut.) Andrews, Ptes. Kane, Fuller,
Turpin and Stephens, all of C. Company. They crossed the Somme
by a bridge and reached a road, where they found a company from
an English battalion waiting to advance.
With the consent of the commander of this company, the patrol
went forward to reconnoitre the village of Chipilly. They had
proceeded for some distance when the British commander, with two
platoons, joined them, but the enemy immediately opened fire, and
they had to split up. Ptes. Stephens and Turpin went into and
through the village, meeting with no opposition: and Sergt.
Andrews and Ptc. Fuller, after moving for 1,000 yards without
being able to locate any of the enemy, returned to a chalk pit on
the north of the village and rejoined C.Q.M.S. Hayes.
The last-named had, in the meantime, led a platoon of the
London Regiment to a spot on the road about 500 yards north-east
of the quarry, but here our own artillery put down a smoke barrage
and they were forced to withdraw. C.Q.M.S. Hayes and Sergt.
Andrews decided to reconnoitre forward, and were watching an
enemy post, when they were suddenly fired on by another, on which
they had practically walked. The two men in this post were
captured and taken back. Ptes. Fuller and Kane then joined the
n.c.o.’s, and they all commenced to make their way back over the
same ground. It was then that they observed, about 150 yards in
advance of the small post already taken, an apparently strong enemy
machine-gun post. They had approached to within about 20 yards
of it without being seen, and decided to attack.
Two of the patrol covered the post, while their two companions
rushed, finding a very deep dug-out round which were placed seven
machine-guns. A bomb sent down the dug-out brought immediate
cries for mercy, and the whole garrison was ordered up, and handed
over to a company of the London Regiment, which had just come up.
Privates Kane and Fuller explored a little further on their own account
and rushed another post, capturing nine prisoners and two more
machine-guns. At this stage the London Regiment came up and
1918—August.

advanced, and after going forward with them for some distance and
assisting in further “mopping up,” resulting in the capture of 28
more prisoners, the patrol returned to the Battalion, after an excellent
day’s work. The company commander of the London Regiment
gave them a note expressing his great appreciation of their action, and
D.C.M.’s were awarded to CQ.M.S. Hayes and Sergt. Andrews, and
M.M.’s to the other four members of the party.
We were continually on the move for the next few days,
relieving units, consolidating positions, and being relieved in turn.
The enemy shelling was fairly heavy, and ’planes were also very
active: but the general advance was continued, the Battalion occu-
pying positions south-west of Harbonnieres and near Crepy Wood.
On August 16 we were relieved, and marched to Vaux-sur-Somme,
where baths and a rest were to be had. This respite did not last for
long, however, for the successful attack was being pressed home, and
the Division was to take part in a further attack on August 23. The
preparatory move to Mericourt-sur-Somme on August 21 was made,
as usual, in the dark, and our role was to take Chuignolles and the
ground beyond.
From the line then held, the objective and the intervening
ground over which the troops would have to pass could not be seen,
and maps had to be relied upon. August 22 was spent in obtaining
what familiarity was possible with the country in the neighbourhood.
It had been decided to exploit the attack if it were successful, and
to push forward across the valley below Chuignolles to the hill
beyond. The artillery was to arrange its barrage accordingly; but,
as with so many last-minute plans, some confusion existed. Final
orders as to this move could only be given to company commanders
in the early hours of the morning of the attack.
The Battalion started its march to the assembly position at
2 a.m. on August 23. The attack was on a scale not before under-
taken by us except in training, and was launched at 4.45 a.m. Six
tanks operated on our front, and a battery of artillery was attached,
but could not be used with success owing to lack of communication.
In addition, we had a section of machine-guns and four Stokes
mortars, and C. Company of the 3rd Battalion was with us, under
Capt. Macdermott, as the front was very long, the final line to be
held being from 3,500 to 4,000 yards.
Chuignolles lay in a valley, and the main road which ran
through it was almost parallel with the jumping-off line. This
entailed a swing to the left after the advance started, in order to
sweep through the village from the most advantageous point. The
order of companies for the original advance was: on the right B.
Company, in the centre D., on the left C, with A. in support and C.
1918—August.


Company of the 3rd Battalion in reserve. The village was divided
between C. and D. Companies. The attack proved most successful,
the first objective, with many prisoners, being taken by 5.30 a.m.
t The barrage was perfect, and the men followed it so closely that the
enemy were taken unawares, and surrendered or were quickly taken,
the advance surging forward to the next post. Resistance was offered
in some places by machine-guns, but the agility and initiative of our
Lewis gunners—especially near Chuignolles Wood, where they ran
forward and opened fire —saved us many casualties.
A. Company had some stiff fighting in the capture of Luc and
Long Woods, and came under heavy fire from an anti-tank gun on
the hill opposite until it was silenced by our artillery. Under the
barrage the troops had pushed forward to the hill across the valley,
in accordance with the final instructions issued: but the barrage then
withdrew on to them, and they had to follow it back and remain on
the forward slope of the hill in front of Chuignolles. It was during
this attack that a big 15-inch gun was captured in a small wood.
Men of C. Company of the 3rd Battalion, attached to us, were the
first to enter that wood, but later about 70 prisoners were captured
there by men of our B. Company.
Word was received after 1 p.m. that the advance Was to be
resumed, though the time was uncertain. It was just possible to send
word of this advance on to the companies before the barrage fell: and
then, without any preliminary preparation, the men of C. and D.
rushed after it, and gained the crest of the hill across the valley,
where the 3rd Brigade was to take over from them. Some of them
continued to press on, Lieut. F. H. Scales and his platoon going a
good distance, but all the high ground was gained, though not with-
out resistance. In Marley Wood the anti-tank gun that had caused
us so much trouble was captured. The 3rd Brigade then filtered
through, and late in the afternoon the Battalion was withdrawn into
reserve. B. Company at this stage was heavily shelled with gas and
suffered fairly badly in casualties: but, apart from that, our losses
were not heavy, considering the nature of the fighting and the amount
of ground gained. Lieut. D. J. Burrin and Lieut. P. J. Kelly, a
recent arrival, were killed.
The results of the day’s operation were an advance of over
3,000 yards and the capture of over 400 prisoners, the largest
number ever captured by the Battalion, while very many Germans
were killed. The effect of the general operation on the enemy was
marked. Within a week or so he withdrew across the Somme at
Peronne. After this action we were withdrawn to reserve near the
old jumping-off line for the attack, and while here were unfortunate
in losing the services of R.S.M. Gould, who was badly wounded by
1918—August.


a shell and never returned to us. He had seemed to be part of the
Battalion, and had exercised a wonderful influence by his method of
“getting things done,” no matter what was coming over.
On August 26 we moved to Morcourt for a rest, and with the
exception of visits from enemy ’planes, which were very active at
night, the time was uneventful. Everyone was cheerful, for the
Germans were being driven back on all fronts, and attacks by the
Allied troops were the order of the day. The next move forward was
on September 7, when, partly by ’buses and partly by marching, the
Battalion reached Mont St. Quentin, where one night was spent in
the open. Then we moved via Doignt and the trenches north of
Tincourt, into support near Hervilly for a few days; then back to
Brusle and a camp of huts, until the night of September 17-18. An
incident that recalls Brusle was the dropping of an aerial torpedo
from a 'plane, within a few feet of the crowded canteen. The luck
of the Ists held, though, and the torpedo failed to explode.
1918—August-September.’


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.
THE LAST FIGHT.
T dusk on the evening of September 17, the Battalion
moved off to play its last active part in the war, though
this was little realised at the time. We had not been in
the line since the Chuignolles attack, and that had been
such a day of successes that we were all feeling fit to tackle
anything. The offensive in which we were now engaged was on a
large scale, three armies being used, and its aim was to secure posses-
sion of the high ground overlooking the Hindenburg line to enable
that line to be attacked. So far as the Battalion was concerned, it
meant the capture of the old British front line before Hargicourt
and Villeret, and of any other ground that would be useful in that
vicinity. Though there was a definite objective, it was left to the
initiative of local commanders to exploit, if possible, an area in
advance of the objective. We marched out with a strength of 23
officers and 491 other ranks. Major Street, M.C., Lieut. Sampson,
M.C., Lieut. Kclleway and Lieut. Steen were the commanders of
A., 8., C. and D. Companies respectively. The troops were given
a hot meal and a rest before reaching the vicinity of Roisel, from
which the companies moved later in the night to their jumping-off
positions in front of Hesbecourt, across country that had become
slippery through the rain which had commenced to fall. The first
objective, allotted to the 2nd and 4th Battalions, was distant about
3,000 yards; and the second, allotted to the Ist and 3rd Battalions
in that order from the right, was about another 2,000 yards away,
the exploitation line being about 1,000 yards ahead. The line of
advance was first in a north-easterly, changing to an easterly direction
shortly after the first objective had been gained. The attack was to
continue under the barrage for four hours, or longer, so the task set
the Battalions was such as would call forth all their initiative and
endurance.
The barrage fell at 5.30, consisting largely of smoke shells,
which, in the moist atmosphere, seemed to make or intensify a dense
fog, so that even after day had broken it was impossible to see more
than 20 yards in front. The greatest difficulty was experienced in
keeping direction, but the 2nd and 4th Battalions captured the first
objective without trouble, though the enemy had all the advantage
1918—September.


of country, and could have put up a very obstinate defence if he had
fought the attackers. The companies came in for some shelling on
the jumping-off line, and Lieut. L. M. Bull, who had only returned
from hospital a little while before, was killed by a shell which burst
among the officers of A. Company, with whom he was standing.
The companies became somewhat disorganised, and lost direction for
a time, but about 8 o’clock the fog lifted and enabled them to
reorganise on the first objective just in time to move forward again
with the barrage, which had halted for about two hours in front
of it. Prisoners were coming past at this time in batches of tens and
twenties, without guard or escort. Machine-guns were found which
apparently had been placed to oppose an attack, and had been left
without firing a shot. Field guns also had been abandoned. Bat-
talion Headquarters had been moved forward in rear of the companies,
and established anew at intervals, though little could be done but
trust to luck that the companies would disentangle themselves and
find their whereabouts in time to move punctually in the attack on
the second objective.
At one stage this did not seem likely. D. Company had moved
too much to the right and could not be seen, and the 3rd Brigade,
operating on the right flank of the Battalion, had had similar dif-
ficulties. But at the last minute everything went well, and the com-
panies moved forward to time-table, capturing the second objective
with all ranks displaying the greatest gallantry and initiative. Lieut.
Hudson here gained his M.C. by rushing an enemy post across ground
which offered no protection. He had only two men with him, and
the enemy were either overcome or surrendered. This is but one
example of the daring that enabled the troops to capture all that
had been allotted to them, including the high ground beyond the
objective, overlooking Buckshot Ravine, with Bellicourt in the dis-
tance. D. Company had got well forward on the right, and was
in touch with the 3rd Brigade. Probably 300 prisoners were cap-
tured, besides Howitzers and field guns, and many machine-guns.
Lieut. Chedgey soon established telephonic communication with the
companies, and did good work as Signalling Officer during the
attack. The Engineer Officer attached to the Battalion found a
good Headquarters at The Egg, in which he captured a few
Germans. He found that it was safe from mines, so Head-
quarters was established there in the afternoon. Transport had fol-
lowed up the attack, and hot tea was served to the men at 2 p.m.
This seems a detail when recorded here, but the provision of hot tea
in the line so early in the day of an attack was a tribute to the Q.M.’s
department and the Transport section, as well as a sign that the
conditions of warfare had changed materially. Our casualties in
this big action were light. In addition to the death of Lieut. Bull,
1918—September.


Major Street and Lieuts. Judd, Page and Gaskcll were wounded, 33
other ranks were wounded, and two were reported missing.
D. Company was withdrawn from the line on the night of
September 19, being relieved by 8., which had been sheltering in a
road a few hundred yards behind the front posts. The forward
area was shelled intermittently, but no great damage was reported.
Word was received on the night of September 19 that the 6th Bat-
talion was to relieve us, and their advanced parties went into the line.
At midday next day, however, plans were changed. Instead of being
relieved finally from the line, the Battalion received orders to move
to the left on the front occupied by the 3rd, and to make an attack
in conjunction with it and the troops on its left. This was to be
made at dawn, after the relief in the line had been completed. The
plan was to capture the high ground overlooking Bellicourt and also
Quenncmont Farm, and so obtain a good jumping-off place for the
next attack on the main Hindenburg line. The frontage allotted to
the Battalion was not large, being roughly about 700 yards, and this
entailed the capture of a ridge which ran out from our lines for about
1000 yards, though the flanks had to be thrown back on both
right and left of the foremost objective, a fact that considerably
lengthened the front for which the Battalion was responsible. The
ground was quite unknown to us, as was the approach to the
jumping-off place, and there was little time for reconnaissance. The
jumping-off place was about 500 yards north of the left flank of
A. Company’s trench, and, as it was on a forward slope, any move-
ment was observable by the enemy, who were shelling the area fairly
heavily most of the afternoon.
When word passed round the Battalion that, instead of the
expected relief, we were to make a further attack, it was by no means
welcomed. The companies were given a warning order to prepare,
but did not receive their definite orders until later, and it was generally
thought that an operation resembling that of September 18 was to
be undertaken. The casualties among officers had been heavy, both
during the previous attack and while holding the line. D. Company
had only its commander left, and though in ordinary circumstances
the Company would not have had to move or do anything in the
coming attack, before this was known, or before it was realised what
the actual attack was to be, the men of that Company became dis-
gruntled at the news that they were not going out on relief. The
other companies also became affected, but until night came it was
not realised that the men would take any serious action.
Company commanders had a busy afternoon, for they had to
reconnoitre the track to the jumping-off line, and prepare for relief
and for the coming attack, which was to be made by A., B. and C.
1918—September.


Companies, D. being held in reserve in its then position. The relief
was complete by 9.15 p.m., and the companies withdrew to a sunken
road, a continuation of that in which D. Company was sheltering.
A meal was served out, and we were to move to the assembly position
and relieve the 3rd in Minnow Trench near Ruby Wood. As soon
as word about the coming attack had been received, permission had
been asked to bring up from the nucleus some further officers. This
was granted, and Capt. Hayward Moffat, M.C., and Lieut. Blake
arrived. Capt. Moffat had received word of the attack, and had
immediately set out for the line without waiting for orders. He
took over command of A. Company and Lieut. Blake went to D.
The discontent which has been referred to had the tragic effect
of a refusal by part of the men—probably ignorant of the actual
nature of the operation—to go to the line. The rest of the Battalion
was in position for the attack well before the time; the shelling of
the route into the line was fairly heavy, but casualties were luckily
avoided. Headquarters had moved forward into the trench from
which the attack was made, and was for some hours out of communi-
cation with the Brigade.
At 5.30 the barrage came down. The enemy barrage replied
quickly and was responsible for most of the casualties suffered during
the day. Owing to doubt as to the actual position in Ruby Wood,
it had been thought better to include it in the area barraged, and
this entailed the Battalion assembling close to the trench, and as the
barrage fell on the trench, more casualties were suffered than if the
troops had assembled further forward. Capt. Moffat was early
wounded, as it proved, fatally.
The strength of the companies as they went into the attack
was: A. 41, B. 18, C. 19, D. 1, H.Q. between 20 and 30.
With the casualties suffered near the jumping-off line, there
were about 50 left to carry out the operation. The enemy were
mostly found in dug-outs, from which they emerged with their
hands up, apparently without any desire to resist. The whole
ground allotted to the Battalion was captured, and posts with a
few men each, and big gaps between, were left to hold it. A
company of the 2nd, under Capt. Collingwood, was placed in
support, but no occasion arose to make use of it. Apart from the
ground captured, which proved of great value in the next attack,
there were about 100 prisoners taken, though all of these did not
reach the rear. After the attack efforts were made at once to con-
solidate. The Germans appeared to be disorganised, and could be
seen running about in the open and in trenches some distance from
our lines, and our men had some good shooting.
1918—September.


On our left the 3rd Battalion gained their objective, which
was a line Unking up the Ist Battalion with the front on the left
of the 3rd, held by the 74th Division, which was attacking Quen-
nemont Farm. The attack on this farm was at first successful,
but later, as the men were seen to be withdrawing, the 3rd Bat-
talion had also to retire to the original line. This meant that
the Ist continued to occupy ground well in advance of any other
unit, with its flanks very much exposed, and in spite of difficulties
it was the only Battalion in the operation which both captured
and retained its objective. This, of course, does not imply any
criticism of the flank battalion.
The Ist was relieved the same night, and we marched back to
our former position near Bernes. The day had been one of the
most momentous in the history of the Battalion. AH who be-
longed to and loved the Ist Battalion felt that it had suffered a
disgrace: but in spite of numbers so reduced that the attack must
have seemed to those taking part in it a last hope, we had come
out with flying colors. Nothing finer had been done before. The
Battalion had spent its last day in the line, and for us the war
was over.
-m
The death of Capt. Moffat was a very real loss, to us all.
His personality was one that would have made him stand out
in any company, for his almost remarkable qualities of courage,
cheerfulness and entire lack of anything approaching pettiness or
spite, endeared him to every officer and to every man. His last
day was typical of his great-hearted courage and unselfish regard
for others. His wound was severe and painful, but he resolutely
refused to be assisted on his way to the dressing-station. Strug-
gling on, he reached the station at last, and they saw that he must
be sent to the main dressing-station without delay. This he
refused to do until someone had been summoned from the Brigade,
so that he could inform Brigade at once of the position in the front
line. So passed one of the most gallant of the many gallant soldiers
whose lives and deaths were bound up in the fortunes of the Ist
Battalion.
After a few days’ rest the Battalion marched out on the
morning of September 24 for Biaches, where it arrived at 3 p.m.
Owing to our small strength, it was necessary to have a thorough
reorganisation, and we became three companies of three platoons
each. A couple of days later we entrained for Longpre, marching
from there to billets at Buigny I’Abbe, arriving at 6.5 a.m. on
September 27. Thenceforward our strength was gradually regained
in more ways "than one. Apart from training, for which the area
was very suitable, there were many exciting football matches, both
1918 —September.


between the companies of the Battalion and between the battalions
of the Brigade, but for the first time in a very long period we lost
our match with the 2nd Battalion. Brigade sports and other
fixtures were a feature of those days, and the Battalion won the
Brigade shield in the military competition.
But changes were taking place. The 1914 officers and men
had been given leave to Australia, and many old identities had
availed themselves of it, which meant that they never rejoined us.
The news from the front continued to hearten us, and we knew
that the enemy was in retreat all along the line. But no one
expected the end so soon.
1918—September.


CHAPTER NINETEEN.
THE ARMISTICE AND AFTERWARDS.
days before the historic eleventh of November, the
Battalion began once more to move up by easy stages to
the Line. After the rest at Buigny I’Abbc, the men were
[ffillpfflgvl feeling fit and it was generally felt that the Battalion was
■SKfcasSßil about to take part in a "push” which would put an end
to the war.
On November 10th the troops reached Bazuel (near Le Gateau)
and spent a comfortless day trying to settle in the worst billets they
had encountered for many a long day. To make conditions worse,
refugees had been trickling back for days and the unfortunate villagers
were already at their wits' end to know how to provide the accom-
modation demanded of them.
Another item in the list of discomforts was the scarcity of
rations. For this state of things the transport services were in no
way to blame. In addition to the usual difficulties of following up
an advance, roads and railways were continually being blocked by
the explosion of delayed-action mines which had been concealed with
diabolical cunning by the Germans and timed to explode days after
the position had been evacuated.
Rumours of an armistice had been current for days and when
word came through on the eleventh that the "Cease Fire” had been
ordered, there was a fair amount of scepticism, soon dispelled, how-
ever, by official confirmation.
The great news brought a deep sense of relief to everyone and
the unconscious mental tension to which we had all been subject
during the war years, was relaxed. But nothing in the nature of a
carnival of rejoicing took place, nor in fact was possible. The
enemy was close at hand and not to be trusted. Rations were short,
and moreover no suitable liquid was at hand in which to celebrate
the return of peace. Later we read of wild scenes in London, Paris
and Sydney, but, like other troops in the Forward Area, the First
Battalion, apart from inter-company tugs-of-war and a game of
football, spent Armistice Day quietly discussing events, any feeling
of elation being quickly sobered by the thought of those gallant lads
who would not be returning home.
1918—November.


The Battalion's next destination was now the main topic of
conversation. The general consensus of opinion was that we should
form part of the garrison for Germany. Some thought the next
move would be Belgium, while a few optimists suggested winter
quarters in the south of France. But it soon became painfully evident
that wherever the troops were going it would, as usual, be per boot.
A few minor moves were made to villages, such as Busigny, around
Le Gateau, and then began the long trek up to Belgium where the
First Division Was to await demobilisation.
The route followed was through St. Souplet, Frisches,
Avcsnelles, Solre-lc-Chateau, and Goudinnes to Gougnies, a small
village not far from Charleroi.
As far as Solre-le-Chateau, when a halt of some weeks was
made, the Battalion was marching through French territory that had
been in the enemy’s hands during the whole of the war. The
Germans had said at the outset of hostilities that they would bleed
France white, and it was now possible to see, only too clearly, how
well they had kept their word. The houses had been stripped of
every article that could be of the slightest use to the invader, and all
the livestock killed or driven away. The treatment meted out to the
Belgians was much less severe, no doubt on account of the possibility
of future annexation. A striking difference in the aspect of the
country was noticeable immediately after crossing the Franco-Belgian
frontier.
Destitute as they were, the inhabitants of invaded France were
pathetically anxious to welcome their “deliverers.” As the Battalion
with band playing marched through a village, the inhabitants would
turn out en masse to see the troops go by. Nuns curtseyed and
smiled, veterans of 1870 raised their caps, and women commented
on the active Australians, comparing them with the heavy-booted
Germans. The bands especially were an endless source of delight to
the villagers: the Germans, it seems, had had very few.
Not the least of the privations suffered by French civilians
behind the German lines was a total lack of coffee. A Frenchman
without his coffee is in an even more pitiable condition than an
American without his iced water, or an Australian without his tea.
Nevertheless, they had to express their joy and gratitude in some
form. The consequence was that the British troops were obliged,
in the cause of politeness, to drink with as cheerful a face as they
could assume, various vile concoctions which did duty for coffee in
those parts. It would have been churlish indeed to have refused the
hospitality that was so eagerly and sincerely offered.
1918—^November-December.


During the war little or no medical attention had been available
and help was urgently requested by the civilian population from the
Medical Officers of the British Army. The R.M.O. of the First
Battalion, Captain Cato, M.C., was the hardest worked man in the
unit at this period, and earned the gratitude of many sick people to
Whom he generously gave his services.
Gougnies was reached on the 17th December, 1918.
On the following day H.R.H. the Prince of Wales paid an
unexpected and informal visit to the village, and chatted for a few
minutes with some of the officers.
Life at Gougnies was interesting but rather monotonous.
Attempts were made to put the Education Scheme into operation
with a view to preparing the men for civil life. Classes in various
subjects were formed under the direction of the Battalion Education
Officer, and some of the officers and non-commissioned officers offered
their services as teachers. It must be confessed that little progress
was made, although the scheme helped to keep the men’s minds
employed. After a time, the classes began to be disorganized by
drafts leaving for England, and it was naturally difficult for men to
settle down to lessons after years of active service and constant change
of scene.
To keep the men amused football matches with the other
battalions of the Brigade were arranged, and as winter was in full
swing, Tobogganing on improvised toboggans of galvanised iron
was indulged in on the snow-clad slopes around the village. The
most cordial relations were maintained with the villagers. On
Christmas Day a church service was held in the village church. After
the Te Deum, the congregation sang the Belgian National Anthem
and the Cure preached an eloquent sermon in which he made glowing
references to the Australians.
As demobilisation proceeded the strength of the Brigade became
so reduced that it was decided on the 27th February, 1919, to
amalgamate the First and Fourth Battalions at Acoz and the Second
and Third Battalions at Bouffioulx, both small villages on the out-
skirts of Chatelet—itself a suburb of Charleroi.
The inhabitants of Gougnies were genuinely sorry to part with
their new friends, and tears flowed freely as they watched the
Battalion march away to Acoz.
On the 26th March the whole Brigade was concentrated at
Bouffioulx, and on the 11th April a further move was made to
Couillet. All the country round Charleroi is densely populated and
one of the most completely industrialised regions in the world. Coal
1918—December, 1919—April.


mines, pottery works, marble quarries, glassworks, to mention only
a few, were to be seen in every direction. This was the country
known to Julius Caesar as the home of the Belgae, and even in his
day pottery works were in existence. The Chateau of Presles, which
is quite close to Gougnies, is supposed to have been the site of the
desperate struggle "the day he overcame the Nervii’’ when the Tenth
Legion saved the situation.
1919—April.


CHAPTER TWENTY.
CONCLUSION.
■I HE method of repatriation adopted by the authorities for
the return of the troops to Australia aimed at the
demobilisation first of those with the longest service.
The result was that, by the end of May, the First
Brigade had been so reduced in strength as to amount to
no more than a weak Battalion and, at this stage, it may be said
that the First Battalion had ceased to be.
But its traditions are carried on by the First Battalion, Aus-
tralian Military Forces, which proudly wears its colour patches and
on whose Regimental Colours are inscribed the battle honours won
on Gallipoli and in France and Flanders.
During its four and a half years of active existence 286 officers
and upwards of 6,000 others passed through its ranks. Its casualties
were:—
Killed: Officers 49, other ranks 1,116.
Wounded; Officers 111, other ranks 2,052.
Brought into being by a great catastrophe and ceasing to exist
when the need for it disappeared, the Battalion nevertheless left its
stamp on all who were associated with it. The memory of the
fallen will never fade and the honours so dearly won will be proudly
borne by its representative in the Citizen Forces until “nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any
jnorc.”
