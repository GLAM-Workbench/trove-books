FOWLER EARTHENWARE BOWLS AND DISHES
The Pudding Basin —akin to the earliest forms of pottery —yet old-fashioned as
it is how essential in every kitchen. Housewives cannot do without a "nest"
of Fowler basins and bowls for culinary use and they please her because the
smoothly glazed finish has no rough spots to hold remnants of food, etc., to
sour or taint. Fowler Ware is so easily cleansed too —no abrasives are
necessary.

EARTHENWARE BAKING DISHES AND CASSEROLES
Concerning Casseroles.
Some housewives overlook the advantages of cas-
serole cookery, they only take advantage of it when
faced with the problem of making the most of a
tough cut of meat or of an old bird. More opportuni-
ties should be availed of to use the casserole as food
cooked in one is very appetising and nourishing be-
cause the natural juices are retained and the meal
comes to the table piping hot —straight from the oven
—and does not spoil if the serving must be post-
poned for a while.
To obtain the full advantages of the casserole the
following hints should be observed: —

1. Before using a new casserole fill the vessel with
cold water, place in a slow oven or over slow
heat and bring water slowly to the boil. Simmer
for five minutes. Empty, dry, and use the
casserole,
2. Never place an empty casserole, or one that is
wet on the outside, either in the oven or on the
stove.
3. If you wish to cook in a casserole over a gas
flame always place an asbestos mat between
casserole and flame,
4. Always keep casseroles covered when cooking
in them.

FOWLER STONEWARE JARS AND BOTTLES
From time immemorial wine has been stored and
matured in vessels of clay; to-day there is nothing
better for the same purpose. Fowler Stoneware is
harder, tougher and superior to any material for
storage of liquids and, further, its opacity affords
advantages in, the storage of liquids that would be
affected by light.
As for Ginger Beer bottles; no other container but
stoneware will ensure the delightful tang and effer-
vescence of that delectable beverage, so always in-
sist on a "stone" bottle of ginger beer!
