Hail and greetings upon thee we shower,
We welcome thy advent with joy ;
Thy glorious pages that sing of true power,
Thy teachings that nought can destroy.
Thy fame is resounding o?er all the wide earth,
Thro? climes where the busy bees? humming;
E?er vies with the joy bells now pealing with mirth,
With gladsome content at thy coming.
We herald thy entry with grand festival,
We.strew all thy pathways with peace ;
Long life to the ? Atom !? Friends be it the call,
Nor e?er shall thy victories cease.
From pole to equator ! on sea or on land,
Where?er on our travels afar ;
Strains heart felt and true shall be sung by a band,
That worships ?Oh Atom ! thy star.
The air is still ringing with ev?ry good wish?
Prosperity ! Long life and Power !
Bright sun, moon and stars may o?erclouded be each
When thy light, learned Atom, burns lower
Cleopatra.

As I wander through the woods in silence
Listening to the birds as they sing,
Watching butterflies of all varieties,
Flittting by on gaily coloured wing,
Shyly peeps the frightened rabbit
Living in the woods all day,
Stupidly he blinks his eyelids,
Sharply turns and darts away.
Looking at my feet before me,
Slowly gliding o?er my toe,
I beheld a little lizard,
Never took me for a foe.


Suddenly my eyes surprised me,
Looking up a hut I saw,
Made of mud and dab and fir-tree.
While before the open door
I beheld an old man sitting
Placidly his brows are knitting,
As he stared at me in wonder.
Lo ! I heard a rumbling thunder ;
Vividly the lightn?ing flashes.
L : sten to the old man?s curses,
As he rises very slowly,
How his snow-white teeth are gnashing,
And his eyes with fire are flashing ;
Slowly comes, his hand is out,
Gone ! ! ! he?s gone without a doubt.
Then the sun shines once more brightly,
And the rabbits once more peep,
As I shake myself and murmur,
Bless my soul ! I?ve been asleep.

?Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, to soften rocks, and
break a knotted oak.?
And true it is, for often has a fiery temper been soothed into a sweet
one by sounds of soft music.
All noise is not music. In fact, often very little is harmony that is
sound.
Music gives great pleasure, for many love but few dislike it.
There is a great deal of music in Nature ; for Plato taught that all
the planets in motion produced beautiful music, and if one of them
stopped we should hear this music.
Paderewski is the greatest living musician, and Beethoven is, perhaps,,
one of the greatest composers that has ever lived, though opinions diner.
Chopin, Lizst, Mozart and Haydn were also great musicians and
composers.
A musician may have a most wonderful execution and yet not be
liked if he has no soul ; for music is nothing without sympathy.

@6c to gfatc cm 6 future.
We look into the Future as a child
Stares vaguely towards a darkened room,
Beguiled, with its own weary thoughts, to what it holds.
Ah ! life alone can lift Fate's curtain's folds.
As slowly move we through this world of wrongs,
A lifetime?s joy to distant hope belongs,
Though God has made the world and all it holds;
Our life alone can lift Fate?s curtain?s folds.
As slowly turning o?er the leaves of life
We find on one gay joy the next sad strife.
When worlds have conquered and have been appeased,
When man with man all fighting has long ceased ;
Then ! slowly will that curtain upward roll,
Showing the destination of the soul.

OVERHEARD.
Lady Westmore lived in Westmore Castle, in the North of
England. Westmore Castle, on the night of which lam going
to write, was a blaze of lights, for was not a grand ball taking
place on that night, and were not the rooms and gardens illumi-
nated in consequence ? This story has not to do with ? persons,??
it has to do with ? things.? The ? things ? are to consist of the
contents of Lady Westmore?s jewel casket.
It was a beautiful gold chased box, lined inside with ruby
velvet, on which the jewels nestled cosily. Left to themselves
these said jewels began to hold conversations with one another
and the following is what was heard of the conversation by
Suzanne, Lady W estmore?s maid, who, after having attired her
mistress in black satin, trimrbed with maltese lace and garnished
with the famous Westmore diamonds, sat down in an easy
chair to enjoy the latest French novel.


? Friends and companions,? said an emerald bracelet, ?we
/? I ill 111 ? | 1 I*l 1 ?
are now free to talk to each other since those stuck-up diamonds
are gone !?
?Yes! indeed!? murmured a little pearl ring in a meek
voice?a voice which told of long endurance of woe, ? they are
so very proud and haughty, and were so rude to me yesterday.?
? Poor dear,? said a sympathetic opal broach, ? I am sorry,
and one who has come of such an old and aristocratic family as
you have, must find it hard, very hard, to be snubbed, simply
because your design is out of date.?
?Ah, yes!? returned the poor little ring, ? and I have such a
sad history, so sad.?
? Oh, do tell it to us,? exclaimed all the jewels in chorus,
while a kind-hearted ruby pendant added, ? If you will not find
it too affecting to you to repeat it to us.?
? Dear no !? said the ring, wiping its eyes, that is if rings
have any eyes (not being an authority on the subject I do not
know, but suppose if they haven't, it was an action approximate
to wiping its eyes.)
Then recovering itself it began ?but it will be best to give
the pearl ring's story in its own words, which were follows :
? My dear friends, you of course all know that I am very,
very old and come of a noble and lustrous race, in fact I am the
eldest living of my family.
? The first year I can remember was a.d. 63. In that year
I was exhibited as a very fine specimen of an ornament, and
finally I was purchased by a noble Roman, whose name if I
remember correctly was Marcus Trebonius.
?By him I was worn for some time, then was given to a
patrician lady, whom he hoped to make his wife named Claudia.
? They were very fond of each other, and but for a wretched
woman whose name was Octavia, they would have been
supremely happy. Her feeling towards Claudia was one of
great rivalry and hatred. Not that she felt any love for
Trebonius, for that she did not, but she envied Claudia and
her future high position ?the position which she must
inevitably occupy as the wife of Marcus Trebonius. Often
Octavia had whispered evil sayings of Claudia into the ear of
her betrothed, but he heeded them not. I remember he used to
say, ? Tell me what good you will of my Claudia and I will
believe it, but evil of her I will not believe.? This would deter


Octavia from her whisperings for some time as it was of the
greatest importance to her to appear docile, sweet-tempered and
loving before Marcus Trebonius, her intended victim, for such he
was.
One day Octavia was entertaing a great number at her villa
in Rome. Amongst the brilliant assemblage were Trebonius and
Claudia and that night Octavia tormented herself with the
thought that the noble Roman was more distant and cold to her,
but at the same time far more tender and solicitous to his
betrothed. Then a horrible thought entered her mind : ?She
would destroy Claudia.
So confident was she of her (Octavia"s) charms that she was
certain, if Claudia was once out of the way Trebonius, after he
had forgotten his first sorrow (she could not bring herself to say
?anger ?) would be sure to turn to her.
Octavia?s next difficulty was her plan, which she was to
follow out.
To meet the gentle Claudia and murder her in cold blood
would even to crafty Octavia be braving too far the wrath
of Trebonius No I she must do the deed by stratagem.
Together with her demoniacal hand-maiden, Emilia, she con-
cocted a scheme, which, so she hoped would rid her of her hated
rival Claudia. Octavia spent her time in experimenting, like
Cleopatra of old, with poisons speedy and sure.
When her plans for action were complete, Octavia went to
visit Claudia, heavily veiled. She entered the villa of
Claudia and found her in her boudoir, just completing her after-
noon toilet. Then Octavia affected to sob and wept passionately.
On kind Claudia?s inquiring as to the cause of her grief she
feigned reluctance to disclose it to the gentle lady, but soon
saying that her sorrow was too great to allow of concealment,
Octavia gently drew Claudia down beside her to a couch, then
making a desperate effort to restrain her false tears, she began in
an admirably assumed tearful voice, ?My sweet Claudia. Oh !
my Claudia ! How can I tell you my mournful errand ? To
think of noble Trebonius playing you false !?
?Octavia!? gasped Claudia, ? Oh, dear Octavia, keep me
not in suspense I beg you. Let me know now what I have to
hope or fear.?
? Well, sweet Claudia,? continued the crafty Octavia. who
perceived her plan to be working well, ?Oh dear, Claudia, ?tis


from Trebonius that I come, I come to tell you of his falseness
to you.?
?He sends you here this dagger and this vial of poison
(tremble not my Claudia), he sends it to you with strict injunc-
tions for you to take your choice of the two evils. Sweet
Claudia, you must fly, you must come with me, and we will
escape the anger of Trebonius together.
? Kindest Octavia,? said the now half fainting Claudia, ? I
cannot disobey Trebonius, it is for love of me, I know that he,
he sends this cruel command, and I know that to him my death
will give happiness.
? Happiness! Claudia,? said Octavia, well certain of the
success of her scheme. ?Do you know what you say ? After
your death, Claudia, he intends to transfer his affections to
another.?
? Then, sweet, my Octavia, farewell, bid for me my long tare*
well to Trebonius. Tell him I forgive him and hope that he will be
happy after ray death. Without my betrothed life to me is
intolerable. Farewell !?
Then Claudia, grasping the vial of poison and raising it to
her quivering lips, drained it to its last drop, and qnietly fell
back and gave one long quavering gasp, and ?died !
Then Octavia laid her on her couch and straightened out
her delicate limbs, forgetting in her haste to remove the tell-tale
dagger from a side table.
Soon Trebonius entered, and supposing Claudia asleep, sat
down to wait until she should awake. Soon he noticed how
quietly the maiden slept, and after vainly attempting to rouse
her, he then saw that Claudia slept the long sleep of Death.
Seeing her opportunity, Octavia glided in and remarking
naively, ?How sweetly the g�ntle Claudia sleeps!? she was
interrupted by Trebonius, who gasped hoarsely, ? Tis not a
natural sleep methinks, and? !? then noticing the gleam in
Octavre?s eyes, he exclaimed, ? And woman ! murderess that thou
art, thou hast murdered her, killed my lovely Claudia. But
yet you shall not escape.?
? Ah, Trebonius !? cried Octavia, feeling now some fear, ? I
did it, I say I did it, but it was for love of you.?
? And she was forgiven ?? asked the jewels in chorus.
? No,? continued the ring, ? No. Trebonius in revenge for
Claudia?s death, sprang at her and stabbed her through her evil


heart with the dagger which she had brought for the innocent
Claudia.?
Then noble Trebonius, feeling that without Claudia he
could not live, and that he would not survive her, kissed her
lightly on the marble-white forehead, and saying, ? Farewell,
Claudia, and Octavia thou hast missed thy reward,? he caught up
the dagger and stabbing himself, fell dead by the side of his
loving and faithful Claudia.?
The ring paused and the silence was only broken b} r the
sobs of the inmates of the jewel casket, so affected were they at the
little pearl ring?s story.
I was taken off the finger of dead Claudia by false Emilia,
by whom I was sold for the paltry sum of 50 sesterces, a quarter
my real value.
I passed throngh many hands and was at last, at my vener-
able age, bought by Lord Westmore, during his stay in Rome
for out of that city I never passed and?but stay, here are the
diamonds returning, and if I continue my history I fear that our
private conversation will be ?Overheard.?

A mosquito sang in the twilight dim,
Thinking what work he had done that day ;
For the world was broad and he was slim,
Because he?d had nothing to eat by the way.
He heard a fat man a?snoring near,
So he buzzed and flapped across the room.
He never stopped a minute to fear,
Till down came the slap that sealed his doom.
Thus flattened did that mosquito lay,
Till the housemaid came with her flacking broom,
And she lifted her hand and she swept him away
To the dustpan his coffin, the backyard his tomb.

Jhn�ition.
Don?t let your hope be centred
On a certain thing to score.
Or when your?re up to it don?t stop ?
Go on and try for more.
When the world has done romancing,
And has ta?en a wiser turn ;
Don?t let your mind be stinted,
To the money you can earn.
In life all should look onwards,
Excelsior?s the winner;
Have a mind that pelf can?t conquer,
Have a soul that vaults your dinner.
For though Ambition?s hills are steep,
If you to climb are game ;
Then on the top to greet you stand,
The glittering lamps of Fame.

As I lay upon my bed
On a sticky summer night,
The stars were all a?twinkling
And the moon was shining bright.
I saw two cats a?walking
Hand in hand and arm in arm,
Howling at the moon as
If they had alarm.
And they sat beneath my window,
And they screached their voices hoarse,
Till I murmured to myself,
? I bet you?ll change your course.?
Then I seized a pot of blacking
And uttered the word ? hang,?
And to my satisfaction
I heard a whisk ! a bang ! !

CHAPTER I.
THE INVITATION ARRIVES.
??Ah ! Let?s see what?s this seal, ? Rockmmster House.? That sounds
good, doesn?t it Tom. Guess I?ll open it, just to pay him out for being
so nasty over last week?s wages. Here it is. ? Dear Emil,? the letter
ran ? I suppose you heard before now of your uncle?s death. Pray do
not associate his memory with any past unpleasantness. Though I
have never seen you, I have often heard about you, and I want you
now to come and live with me as a son,
While I remain, your fond aunt,
Leonora Vane.
?? Well, 1 was thinking of having a change, so I?m off. Accept the
invitation. Tell her to expect me to-morrow evening, Sign yourself
E. Vane. You can stay on as his valet instead of me. If you?re
questioned, say I took offence and quitted.
Let us leave Mr. Adolphus Williams journeying towards Rockminster
House while we see what preparations Lady Vane is making for her
nephew?s arrival.
CHAPTER 11.
THE ? NEPHEW ? REACHES HIS DESTINATION.
? Now, Brenda, hurry up ! Emil will be here soon, don?t forget he?s
a well-to-do lawyer, and oh! gracious, there he is . . . Tell John
to show him into the best drawingroom . . , Jane put that vase
of roses in Mr. Emil?s bedroom . . . Brenda, come down
with me.? And sweeping down the wide staircase, Lady Vane opened
the door and rushed into Mr. Williams?arms, much to his disgust. ? Oh,
Emil ! oh, my nephew ! oh, let me kiss you again . . . I?m so
delighted you?ve come ! Oh, you are like your poor Uncle Henry.
Here, Brenda, shake hands with your cousin. John, show Mr. Vane
his room.?


? Humph,? said Mr. Adolphus to himself, ? I forgot I?d have to be
mugged by the old ?un. Ah! aren?t I like me poor uncle ? Hope
she doesn?t go questioning me about my ancestors. Come in ! Oh,
tea is ready, is it? Tell the ladies I?ll be down.?
? Sit there, Emil, dear. Make yourself quite at home. John you
need not wait.?
CHAPTER HI.
LADY VANE DECIDES NOT TO INVITE ANY MORE ? NEPHEWS.?
? Good morning, Brenda, how?s Aunty this morning ?? ? Quite well
thank you, Emil. Come to the stables and I?ll show you my horses.?
?Will you?? ?Certainly. Isn?t the country lovely round here ? Oh, look
at that man, what a hurry he?s in. ?Is this Lady Vane?s house ? If so
be so good as to tell her a gentleman desires to see her,?
said the stranger coming up. ? Emil,? said Brenda ; ?Oh he?s gone
up to the house to ? herself,? he needn?t have left me with this strange
man. Yes, I?ll tell mother,? and showing him into the hall went off to
tell her mother.
Lady Vane soon made her appearance, and as she opened the door
Emil, for such he was, could restrain himself no longer, but grasping
his aunt lovingly by the hand, and told her in a few words how he had
discovered that his valet, Adolphus Williams had read his (Emil?s)
aunt?s invitation, and accepted it and was staying here at the present
moment.
Nothing can express the intense joy of the aunt at beholding the
the real thing. ? Never again will I invite my nephews to stay with me.
Just fancy I sat at table with him, kissed him.? ? Never mind, mother,
he?s gone now I?m sure ?? ?Yes, so am I,? cried John, rushing in,
? He?s gone ! and so has your jewel case !?

?Tis grand to watch a torrent roar
Along its bed, then watch its fall into a cataract ;
Yet grander still to some ?twill seem
To list the trickling music of a mountain stream.
Many have seen a torrent?s spray,
Dash high, pause, drop, then flow away,
But sweet to some to list the gentle teem,
Caused by the rippling of a mountain stream.
Some say it makes them mighty feel,
To view the great Niagara reel;
Yet others vow, a gentle dream,
Is caused by a mountain stream,

A summer?s day with a cloudless sky, and a gentle breeze, just the
very day for a trip. The boys brought out fishing lines, and we girls
below in the cabin amused ourselves with songs and music. At last
the dinner gong rang. The boys had set the table and made some tea
for us. Just as we were enjoying ourselves, Jack, the captain, called
out, ? Storm ahead ! All hands on deck to shorten sail.? We went on
deck, but the sky was now black, and rain falling heavily. The sailors
and Harry had on their oilskins and ordered us below, and shut down
the hatches. The yacht was now rolling a little. I sat at the piano
trying to cheer up the others by playing comic pieces, but in vain. Elsie
lay on one couch, Louise on another staring dismally at one another
across the table. We had scarcely finished laughing at their comical
looks, when Harry opened the hatches and said, ? We might all have to
to go to Williamstown if we couldn?t get a safe landing for the dingey
at the pier.?? This caused great dismay, as not any of us had any
money, and without this latter how were we to get to Brighton,
unless we walked ? However, we were soon told to come on deck, as
Jack thought it was quite safe to go on shore. Lou and El, by this
time were almost limp, and of a strange ?no sort ?of colour. Harry
let them go first. When our turn came we had to be very careful not
to be dashed on the piles by the waves. However, we landed safely,
and were soon doing justice to our ample and comfortable tea.

In your suit of blue and silver,
Idly strolling down the street;
Darting keen inquiring glances,
At the folks you chance to meet.
When the sun pours down at midday
Till ? you dunno where yer are,?
If you are a plain-clothes Tective,
Get you to the neighbouring bar.
There you?ll drink and joke unheeded
Look each fellow in the face,
When its time to take reports in
Say you can?t find any trace.
Or when night has lit her candle,
And the birds to roost have gone,
Get you to a quiet corner,
There to sleep and snore till morn.
Dreaded criminals pass unheeded,
All in vain the helpless screams,
You are deaf to mortal noises,
Lis?ning to your idle dreams.
And the World rolls on unhindered,
And the seasons come in turn,
Still you will remain a p?liceman,
Andap?liceman?s bread you?ll earn.

Through forests covered with a tropic?s green,
Between your banks you pour with fearless pride ;
Murmuring or roaring o?er your well worn bed,
No power on earth can stay your stately ride.
The splendid palm that swings with steady top
Man can destroy it, nought can make you stop.
Oh ! Amazon, fierce river of to-day,
Mightiest of all Nature?s rolling streams,
Move on ! move on ! nor hasten if thou wouldst,
Loiter to listen to the wild bird?s screams,
That is your music as you sweep along ;
Wouldst thou a sweeter sound than Nature?s song.
River ! invincible ! pass on through every bend
Of time ! of centuries !
One w?ho knows no end.

I lay down on the soft moss in the green woods,
And listened to the birds twittering,
When one alighted and rested on my arm,
Which sung the sweetest song imaginable ;
It said, ? Art thou the poet of the day.?
I aniwered yes.
I thought it sang of olden time,
When all the woods were purple,
Before the gums had grown at all,
And all the trees were myrtle.
I fell asleep !
And dreamed I was in Paradise.
I dreamed I saw the bird of gold.
Next to it was a peacock bold,
The peacock screeched, the golden bird was still,
The Forest echoed back from hill to hill ;
At length the golden bird arose,
Saying ? Thou art the poet that 1 seek,
And since I?ve found thee
Thou wilt hear me more.


It whistled calmly, whistled sweetly,
Whistled every note distinctly,
Whistled of the time to come,
When the sun had gone to rest,
It would be there, ever whistling.
When the sun went down
It remained there whistling.
I peeped again at midnight,
It still went on,
I then awoke,
And found that it had fled.
