WAR-TIMES PROFITS TAX
A meeting convened by the Council of the Incorporated
Institute of Accountants, Victoria, to discuss the War-lime
Profits Tax, was held in the upper hall of the Athenaeum
Melbourne, on Friday evening, December 7. The President
of the Institute, Mr. R. H. Shackell, F.1.A.V., occupied the
chair and the room was full, a large number of representative
men of commercial and financial organisations being present
bv invitation. The chairman said it might be taken for granted
that the legislation recently passed was of and
might have far-reaching results, so the Council of the Institute
had thought it would be wise to convene that meeting to discuss
the many problems that had arisen. He announced that papers
on different portions of the Act would be read by Messrs.
Clement H. Davis, F.1.A.V., E. Pyke, F J.A.V and T. F
Brennan, A.1.A.V., members of the Council, in order form the
basis for discussion.
PAPER READ BY MR. CLEMENT H. DAVIS, F.I.A.V.
Introductory.— When the proposals for the War-time
Profits Tax were under the consideration of Parliament some
accountants studied the English Finance Acts on which the
Commonwealth Bill was based, then the English Acts, read
together with, a good commentary such as that by Spicer &
Pegler This gave the principles of such legislation, the details
being 'adjusted later to local conditions here. The first


Commonwealth Draft Bill was followed by an amended Bill
with the alterations marked in heavy type. Finally the Act
was passed here on 22nd September last. The Act was then
studied, and afterwards the commentary or handbook issued
by the Commissioner, Mr. B. Ewing. With these successive
steps constant discussions among individual accountants as-
sisted business men who had not time to spare from the arduous
tasks falling on all men at the present time. Then some of
the representatives of the Accountants’ Institutes and the
Chamber of Commerce and other important organisations
consulted with the Commissioner and light began to break
on this very difficult piece of legislation. At last it was decided
to meet as we are here to-night —not to preach as with authority
but humbly trying to make the provisions of the Act clear.
This, moreover, is not the time or place to question the wisdom
of such an Act rather than say a super income tax ; we have
the law and must obey it and seek to understand its directions.
In closing this foreward or introduction I tender my thanks to
Mr. Ewing and his very capable staff for the courtesy with
which they have at all times explained matters in doubt.
General Remarks on Part 3. —No. 33 of 1917 is an Act
relating to the imposition assessment and collection of a tax
upon profits enacted by the King, the Senate and the House of
Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia. It
applies to the profits of any business arising after the 30th
June, 1915, and continuing until the 30th June next after the
declaration of peace in connection with the present war.
My task to-night is to deal particularly with Part 3
(Sections 7to 14). I may say, however, Part lof the Act is
introductory showing among other things the division of the
Act into 10 parts. It also contains a table of definitions
which must be consulted by the reader particularly with regard •
to such terms as Business, Capital, Companjq Partnership,
Trustee and Wasting Asset, because in the Act they have
meanings varying from those given them in daily use. If
time permits we may consider some of them later.
Part 2 deals solely with administration. It states that
the Commissioner of Taxation shall have the general adminis-
tration of the Act, and he ‘may delegate certain powers to
others who shall assist him. The Commissioner shall furnish
a report annually to the Treasurer for presentation to Parlia-
ment. The final Sections of Part 2 enjoin Secrecy on Officials.
Part 3 deals with War-time Profits Tax and states in
Section 7 sub-section 1, There shall be levied and paid on all
war-time profits from any business to which this Act applies
arising after the 30th day of June, 1915, a tax (referred to as


War-time Profits Tax) at such rate as is declared by Parlia-
ment.”
Act No. 34 of 1917, with which the principal Act (No.
33) is incorporated reads (Section 4) as follows :
“ War-time profits tax is imposed on the war-time profits
liable to tax under the principal Act (33) arising from any
business at the following rates —
(а) On the war-time profits arising in the financial year
ending 30th June, 1916 —50 per cent, of those profits.
(б) On the war-time profits arising in each succeeding
financial year —75 per cent, of those profits.”
The definition of “ business ” is found in Part 1, Section 4,
of the Act in the following words, “ Business includes any
profession or trade, and, any transaction not in the course of a
person's business for the sale and purchasse of any commodity .”
Now these words are at first sight baffling, because professions
do not, speaking generally, come under the operation of the
Act ; secondly, the statement that “ business ” includes,
“ any transaction not in the course of a person's business ”
may also need consideration. The commentary or Handbook,
on page 27, explains what are “ businesses chiefly for the
purpose of showing that continuity of transactions proves
them to be a person's business, and where a transaction is
occasional, such as selling a piece of land, then in the larger
sense the income is profit while the gain on the occasional
transaction is only a transfer of capital, not profit.
With respect to businesses carried on by agents in Aus-
tralia, the point the Commissioner emphasises is that the
Act applies to all profits arising from sources within Australia,
the original words were, “ From businesses carried on in
Australia,” but these were altered so as to limit the tax to
profits that clearly arose from business transacted in Australia.
In determining that business has been actually transacted in
Australia it is necessary that any two of the following three
places should be in Australia.
1. The place where contract is made.
2. Place where goods were delivered and taken over by
purchaser.
3. Place where payment is made.
Under Section 8 (1) commission agents and agents of any
kind unless purely salaried men are subject to this tax. Sec-
tion 10 states that each separate business conducted by the
same owner is to be taken separately for the purpose of calcu-
lating the taxable profits as if each were the only business
owned. The diminishing general exemption of £2OO is applied


to each separate business. The businesses to which the Act
does not apply, are set out in Section 8.
Another important direction to taxpayers is that sub-
section 1 of Section 10 states that profits shall be determined
on the same principles as the profits are determined for Com-
monwealth Income Tax (subject to the modifications set out
in Part 4, Section 15.) Section 12 treats of the law in relation
to the pre-war standard, and increase and decrease of capital.
This is illustrated on pages 22 to 24 of Handbook, under the
head of “ Banks.”
It may be a useful hint to my hearers to state that I found
the quickest way to get at the meaning of Part 3, Section 12
(and also Parts 4, 5 and G, which are the vitals of the Act) was
to read the Act, the Regulations to the Act and Schedules, then
prepare a specimen return as for a company and a partnership,
and submit them to the Department. This I did, and was
received with that and patience which characterises
the heads of our public departments in Melbourne. I found
there that my return was correct in the main, that under
the profit standard my company client would have to pay a
heavy amount (not at first apparent), due to reduction of
capital between the selected pre-war years and the first war-
time year, second that under the statutory percentage option
they would escape the tax. In the Partnership case the firm
had made heavy profits in the war-time year, but these profits
were the fruit of heavy initial expenditure in the pre-war years
which pre-war years in consequence showed a low rate of profit,
therefore, I argued the pre-war expenditure should be averaged
with the good (or high) war-time profit (or vice versa), if cause
and effect could be demonstrated by the books of account.
The Department could not give an offhand opinion on
the merits of this case, it is one of a large number which do not
seem to come within the directions of the Act, and which will
be I am sure, sympathetically dealt with by the Commissioner
or the tribunal to which final reference can be made. These
remarks open up the question of new businesses, with small
capital and good profits, commenced immediately before the
war, or during war-time years, and I trust another evening
may be arranged in which all the societies represented at this
meeting may be afforded an opportunity of further discussing
a theme with which to-night we can only deal in a very general
manner. I have these schedules with me, but shall not read
them at present, because they trespass on Mr. Brennan’s paper
on “ Capital ” (Part 5.).
Some Businesses ; Commodities ; Profits.' —This head-
ing occupies 5 pages of the Handbook and will doubtless claim


a special paper for itself at a later date. Commodities. —The
definition clause (Section 4), I have referred to it above, explain-
ing meaning of business to be taxed, says, “ A person’s business
for the sale and purchase of any commodity. The index head
reference under head of Commodity says, Sale and Purchase of
Commodity deemed part of business. We referred to it in
discussion with Mr. Ewing, he said, with reference to occasional
sale of land and premises, or occasional sale of a horse in such
transactions he did not recognise the term “ Commodity in
its sense in this connection. Therefore we may consider
occasional profits from such transactions (lacking continuity)
to be not profit in a taxable sense but transfers of capital.
Mining is referred to in clause 8, but Section 15 (7), Part 4, is
the portion of the Act under which its discussion naturally
comes.
Partnerships. —Section 10 (2), —The following is from
page 73 of the Handbook and seeks to explain section 10 (2) :
“ Any business carried on by a partnership will be
assessed as if it were owned by one individual, but for purposes
of the provisions of the Act relating to the deduction of losses
from profits the tax payable by a partnership is deemed to
have been paid pro rata to their interest by the individual
partners. To that extent, each partner is deemed to be carry-
ing on business on his own account. If a person is a partner
in more than one partnership, and the members of each partner-
ship are not absolutely identical, that person is deemed to be
carrying on as many separate businesses as there are partner-
ships in which he is interested. In consequence of this pro-
vision an individual partner is entitled to set off the losses which
he may sustain in one business against the profits of any other
business in which he is interested either individually or as a
partner, provided only, however, that the loss made by him
is recouped by him out of the profits. If that person’s capital
account in the partnership which has sustained a loss were
merely debited with his share of the loss, and the debit was
not made good by him out of the profits of his other businesses
he could not set off the loss mentioned against the profits
of the other businesses.
If, however, he is obliged to recoup the loss out of the
profits of the other businesses, lie becomes entitled to a refund
from the Commissioner, from Ids share of the tax paid by the
partnership business, of the difference between that share
and the amount that would have been payable by him in
respect of his share of the profits of the profitable business,
if the loss made by him had been deducted from his share of


the profits of the partnership paying the tax in calculating
the amount of the partnership tax.
In connection with the capital of partnerships, the rules
laid down under the heading of ‘ Capital ’ will apply.”
Pastoralists.— The comments on assessments of this
class of business fill 9 pages of the Department’s Handbook,
so that it will furnish material for one long paper on a subse-
quent evening.
ILLUSTRATIONS ON PART 3.
Section 7 (1). —There shall be levied and paid on all war-time
profits from any business to which this Act applies arising after the
thirtieth day of June One thousand nine hundred and fifteen a tax
(hereinafter referred to as “ War-time Profits Tax ”) at such rate as is
declared by the Parliament.
Section 7 (2). —The War-time profits arising in a financial year shall
be calculated as follows :
(a) By ascertaining the monthly average of the profit or loss arising
in the accounting period ending in the financial year and separately the
monthly average of the profit or loss arising in the accounting period
beginning in the financial year.
( b) By multiplying the respective monthly averages of profit or
loss (as the case may be) by the number of months of the respective
accounting periods falling within the financial year.
(c) by adding together the amounts of the profit or deducting the
amount of the loss from the amount of the profit (as the case may be)
and deducting from the sum so obtained the pre-war standard of profits
as defined for the purposes of this Act; and
(d) By deducting from the sum remaining in paragraph (c) hereof the
deduction (if any) allowed by the next succeeding sub-section.
Section 7 (3). —From the sum remaining under paragraph (c) of the
last preceding sub-section —
{a) in the case of a business in which the standard of
profits does not exceed Five hundred pounds, there shall be deducted
the sum of Two hundred pounds ;
(b) in all other cases, where the sum remaining under paragraph
(c) of the last preceding sub-section—
1. does not exceed Two hundred pounds, the total sum shall be
deducted.
2. exceeds Two hundred pounds, there shall be deducted the sum
of £2OO less —
(1) in the financial year ending on the thirtieth day of June, One
thousand nine hundred and sixteen, One pound for every two pounds
by which the excess exceeds Two hundred pounds.
(2) in all succeeding financial years. One pound for evexy Four
pounds by which the excess exceeds Two hundred pounds.
Note. —Section 7 is founded on Section 38 of the principal English
Act — Finance Act 1915.
Illustration of Section 7 (sub-secs. 1,2, 3).
Section 7 (1). —The assessments are to be based on the profits arising
in the period Ist July to 30th June following. The first assessment
will be based on the period from Ist July, 1915, to 30th June, 1916.
Power is given to the Commissioner to make a default .assessment if
default is made in Section 22 furnishing any return or the Commis-
sioner is not satisfied with the return made by any taxpayer. Assess


merits will be made in each financial year. Where a taxpayer carries
on more than one taxable business, one notice (Section 26 (3) ) of
assessment will be issued to cover all those businesses.
In arriving at the profits the accounting periods adopted by the
business will be taken as a basis, and unless these coincide with the
period Ist July to 30th June, it will be necessary to apportion the profits.
For example—-
A business balances on the 31st August in each year. In order
to arrive at the profits subject to tax, the profits made in the accounting
periods ending 31st August, 1915, and 31st August, 1916, will be ascer-
tained. The profits subject to tax will be—
Two-twelfths of the profits for the 12 months ending 31st August,
1915, plus—
ten-twelfths of the profits for the 12 months ending 31st August,
1916.
When parts of the two accounting periods fall within a financial
year, and there is a profit in one accounting period and a loss in the
other, the loss will be set-off against the profit when calculating the
assessable profit arising within the financial year.
Assessments will be made periodically on profits earned until the
30th June next after the declaration of peace.
Take a simple example ; —£12,000 profit at end of 31st August, 1915,
and £12,000 profit at end of 31st August, 1916, Average monthly profit
£I,OO0 —2/12ths for July and August, 1915, equals £2,000 plus 10/12ths
for September, October, November, December, of 1915, and January,
February, March, April, May, and June of 1916, equals £IO,OO0 —Total
£12,000.
Illustration of Exemption of £2OO.
Section 7 (3). —In every case in which the pre-war standard of profits
does not exceed £SOO there is a fixed general exemption of £2OO. In all
other cases there is an exemption of £2OO in the cases of each taxable
business whose excess profits are not more than £2OO. When the excess
is greater than £2OO, the exemption of £2OO is reduced by £1 for every
£2 by which the excess profits are greater than £2OO in the first assess-
ment, and by £1 for every £4 by which the excess profits exceed £2OO
in the subsequent years.
The excess profits are reduced by this amount if they are the profits
of a full year. If less than a full year’s profits are being assessed the
exemption calculated as above is proportionately reduces.

Exemptions of Businesses and Persons.
Section 8 (1). —The profits derived from the following businesses
are exempt:—
Agriculture. Agents for absentee principals when the agents do
not carry stock or sell goods on consignment for the principals.
Businesses commenced since 4th August 1914, in which the profits
were derived wholly from the recovery from waste manufactured profits
of any materials which are used for the production of munitions of war.
Butter making and sale by persons maintaining dairy herds, and
by co-operative companies.
Charitable institutions’ businesses.
Cheese making and sale by persons maintaining dairy herds and by
co-operative companies.
Commercial travellers.
Co-operative companies engaged for the main part in the manu-
facture, preparation, or wholesale distribution of foodstuffs the produce
of Australia so far as regards the profits arising from the manufacture,
preparation, or wholesale distribution of these particular foodstuffs.
Dairying by the owners of dairy herds.
Farming for agricultural produce.
Fruit growing.
Gold mining, when gold mining is the principal business.
Investments when investment is not the principal business of the
investor.
Life insurance, except the part of the profits which is available for
distribution to shareholders of a proprietary company.
Local governing bodies’ businesses.
Market gardening.
Milk vending by persons who maintain dairy herds.
Mining commenced after 4th August, 1914, for wolfram, molyb-
denite, tungsten, scheelite, or any other rare metals used in the manu-
facture of munitions of war, if the output of the mine is disposed of to
the Imperial Government.
Municipal corporation businesses.
Nurseries. Pig raising. Poultry raising.
*Professions. Public authorities’ businesses.
Public educational institution businesses.
Religious institution businesses. Rubber cultivation.


Societies registered under the Friendly Societies Act of the Common-
wealth or a State and not carried on for pecuniary profit.
This section 8 is somewhat similar to section 39 of the principal
English Act called the Finance Act of 1915, Part 111., Excess Profits
Duty.
* Note. —The term professions will embrace accountants, analytical
chemists, architects, artists (theatrical and other), authors, civil, direct-
ing and consulting engineers, draftsmen, dentists, doctors, geologists,
insurance brokers, lawyers, metallurgists, mineralogists, musicians,
naturalists, schoolmasters, surveyors.
Exemptions of Persons on Active Service.
These are set forth in sec. 8 (3), I need not comment on them
now.
Section 8 (3). : —When any resident of Australia, being the owner
of or a partner in a business to which the Act applies, who is on
active service, outside Australia with the naval or military forces of any
of the Allied Powers in connection with the present war, and who before
he went on active service devoted the whole or the greater part of his
time to the management of the business, and whose military or naval
duties require him to be in any part of the field of operations in connec-
tion with the war where there is danger to life as a result of the opera-
tions, of the enemy forces, is :
(a) When the sole owner of a business exempt from liability to pay
the war-time profits tax.
(5) When a partner in a business entitled to a refund from the
Commissioner of the part of the tax payable by the partnership which
bears the same proportion to that tax as his interest in the profits of
the partnership bears to the total profits.
When a claim is made on behalf of a person on active service for
exemption under this provision, it should be supported by conclusive
evidence to show that the person on active service is required to carry
out his duties in any part of the field of operations in connection with the
war where there is danger to life as a result of the operation of the enemy
forces, otherwise the claim cannot be conceded.
PAPER READ BY MR. E. PYKE, F.I.A.V.
As the time allotted to me is so very short it is my purpose
to deal with as many of the principal points as possible. There-
fore, I shall begin with—
PRE-WAR STANDARD OF PROFITS. (PART 5).
By which is meant the amount of profits arising from the
trade or business on the average of any two of the last three
pre-war years, compared with the war-time profits in order to
ascertain the excess but shall not in any case be less than £SOO.
(16 (3) ).
Pre-War Years.— The last pre-war trade year, means the
year ending at the end of the last accounting 'period, before the
sth August, 1914, and the last 3 pre-war trade years means the
3 years ending at. the 3 corresponding times. It is important
to observe that the words “ latft accounting period ” means the
date on which the accounts are usually made up. For instance


if accounts are balanced, say on 31st August, yearly, the last
pre-war year will be 31st August, 1913, even though over 11
months trading has taken place in 1913-1914 (before the war).
It may so happen that substantial profits were made
during this period, of which no account will be taken in the
pre-war standard. It is obvious that the higher the standard
of profits, the more favorable will it be for the taxpayer. (See
Illustration No. 1).
Accounts Prepared Half-Yearly.— ln this connection
it is important to point out that I believe the Commissioner
will insist upon the taxpayer taking the usual completed year,
that the accounts are usually prepared (unless there has been
a change in the balancing date), though the Company made up
interim accounts by taking stock, and preparing profit and
loss accounts, but presenting yearly accounts to shareholders.
I think that traders, who are affected by the view of the
Commissioner, should make representations to him, as it
might mean a very serious loss to the taxpayer, especially if
the last 6 months happens —as it does in many businesses,
to be the best. (See Illustration No. 1). It is probable
that sympathetic treatment will be met with, as I have no
doubt the Commissioner will take a reasonable view of the
matter. It will be seen, by reference to Illustration No. 1,
how important this matter is. The term “ Accounting
Period,” applies to the ordinary business period of 12 months
corresponding to the period for the Federal Income Tax, viz.,
Ist July to 30th June.
Assessments. — The assessment must be on a full 12
months trade where that period exists within the Commonwealth
financial year —July Ist to June 30th. Therefore, all account-
ing years which end at some other date than June 30th, will
require to be adjusted when the assessment for tax is made,
for example : —A business balances on 31st July in each year.
The tax year ends June 30th. 1916, therefore it will be neces-
sary to take 1-I2th of the profits of 1914-15, and 11-12ths of
the profits of 1915-16. If there is a loss in one part, and a
profit in the other, the loss can be set off against the profit.
It is to be noted that whereas the taxpayer's balancing
year will be accepted for Income Tax Assessment, the year for
War-time Profits r Taf\ must be adjusted to June 30th. The
first accounting period of 12 months is that ending 30th June,
1916.
In effect the comparison to be made is not between
profits earned before and those earned after August sth, 1914,
but between trading accounts prepared before that date, and
trading accounts prepared after that date as adjusted. (Sec-’


tion 7). The Assessment is based on the profits made in the
financial year Ist July to 30th June. Where the annual
accounting tax period does not extend over that period an
adjustment of profits on a monthly average basis. (Section 7).
will be made and the business taxed thereon. (See Illustration
No. 6 (Paragraph 5). This adjustment must not be confused
with pre-war trade accounting periods, as these years may not
extend as from Ist July to 30th June, but, nevertheless, the
profits of such trade years will be taken as the basis of the 'pre-
war period, without any monthly adjustment, that is to say
whichever 2 years are taken as the basis of the pre-war standard,
these dates will be taken as made out by the taxpayer, subject
to any adjustments on the basis of disallowances under the
Income Tax Act, for depreciation, etc., which disallowances
will, of course, increase the pre-war standard. The Act does not
compel any trade or business to alter the date on which it has
been usual to make up its accounts.
BASIS OF COMPUTATION OF PROFITS.
The next point to notice is that by Section 16.(1), the profits
of any pre-war trade year shall be computed on the same
principles, and subject to the same ‘provisions as the profits
of the accounting period.
Further, by section 10 (1), the profits shall be determined
on the same principles as the profits are determined for the pur-
pose of the Commonwealth Income Tax Act, subject to certain
modifications. A trader will require to very carefully scrutinise
his accounts that are used to obtain the pre-war standard, as it
is the figure which he ultimately obtains from these accounts,
that will form the standard, of comparison. It must be remembered
that once the standard is fixed, it will, no doubt, also apply
to subsequent years.
As will be seen from Illustration No.. 2, there are several
items which require adjusting, and which are noted on the illus-
tration.
Considerable care must be observed in selecting the years
for obtaining the standard of profits, as it is not always advan-
tageous to select, for the standard of profit, the results of the
2 years, which at first sight appear the best. By reference to
Illustration No. 2, it will be seen that the years 1913 and 1914
seem to be the best of the 3 pre-war years, yet when all the.
adjustments have been made, it is found that the 2 best years
are 1912 and 1913.
Secret Reserves. —By reference to Illustration No. 13,
it will be seen what effect secret reserves have on the duty
payable.


If assets, which are still in existence, have been written off
prior to the first of the pre-war years, they should be brought
in, and the capital will thereby be increased. The important
point here is that where the capital in pre-war years is more,
or less, than the capital in the accounting period, the percentage
of profit is affected. If a percentage standard is used to com-
pare with the profits in the accounting period, the percentage
on the value of the asset will increase the standard for Compari-
son with the profits in the accounting period.
It must be understood that all secret reserves must be dis-
closed. Secret reserves are created in other ways, as by
excessive depreciation, etc., etc. (See Illustration No. 13).
Borrowed Money.—ln arriving at the pre-war standard,
care must be taken, where borrowed money not repaid is used,
that the deduction under Section 15 (15) is also deducted from
the pre-war profits, for instance, if 4 per cent, is being paid for
loan moneys, the difference between this rate and 10 per cent,
must be deducted from the pre-war profits, as well as the profits
in the accounting period. (See Illustrations Nos. 2 and 9).
It is important to note that in order to arrive at the
percentage of Profit in the Pre-War Period, Borrowed Money
must be added to the Capital as defined by Section 17.
The increase or decrease of Capital obtained by comparing
the average Capital in the Pre-War Period and the average
Capital in the Accounting Period is arrived at on the basis of
Capital in both periods, as defined by Section 17. Therefore
Borrowed Money in this comparison must not be included.
These points are clearly shown in the following illustration :

Returns. —A note of warning must be sounded here,
viz. :


Though the return asked for by the Commissioner is
apparently simple, viz., attaching profit and loss accounts and
balance sheets, and showing the average profits, etc., of the
last 3 pre-Avar trade years, unless the adjustments are properly
set out as an addition to those statements, it aatll be impossible
for the Commissioner to know what items should be added to
the profits disclosed by the profit and loss accounts, with the
consequent result of over taxation.
Balance Sheets’. —It is absolutely essential that a
balance sheet should be made out, not only for the tax year,
but for all the years from the Ist of the pre-A\ 7 ar trade years.
This is in the interests of the taxpayer himself, as otherwise
he might be overtaxed. If the taxpayer does not furnish
these balance sheets the Commissioner will make an arbitrary
assessment. Many traders, especially cash businesses, make
up a correct income and expenditure account, but disregard
balance sheets. This omission should be promptly attended
to.
The pre-war standard may be : —(1) A profit standard.
(2) A percentage standard.
If the profits standard is less than the percentage standard,
the percentage standard shall be taken.
(1) Profits Standard. —(a) The profits standard is the
average of any two of the last 3 pre-Avar trade years to be
selected by taxpayers, but in no case shall it be less than £5OO.
(See Illustrations No. 3 and No 10).
{b) Where there have been 2 pre-war trade years—the
greater of the profit of those 2 years ; or if there has beep a
loss in one year, and a profit in the other, the profits of the year
in which the profits were made. (See Illustration No. 4).
(c) Where there has been only 1 pre-war trade year—the
profits of that year. (See Illustration No. 5).
{d) Where there has been abnormal depression in the last
3 pre-war trade years, any 2 of the 3 preceding pre-war trade
years may be substituted for the purposes of the pre-war
standard of profits for any 2 of the last pre-Avar trade years.
(See Illustration No. 7).
(e) Where, owing to the recent commencement of any
business, the pre-Avar standard of profits does not exceed £5OO,
the taxpayer may adopt as the pre-war standard of profits
of that business by reference to the income arising from any
trade, business, office, employment or profession of any sort,
before his neAV business commenced as if it Avere the same busi-
ness, but only to the extent to Avhich the income from the
former trade, etc., has been diminished. (See Illustration
No. 6).


(/) Where in the case of any business other than a pastoral
business, (a) the net result of the business since the first of
the 3 selected pre-war trade years, and up to the end of the
accounting period immediately preceding that upon which
the current assessment is being made, has shown a loss ; and
( b) any part of the profits of the current account period has
been applied in extinction of that loss ; deduction is allowed
equal to the amount of profit so applied. (See Illustration
No. 8).
Note. — My reading of the Section is that future losses, will
have to be dealt with on similar lines. For example : —Taking
Illustration No. 8, the loss of £2,500 has been wiped out, from
the profits of the year 1916, but supposing that in 1917 a loss
is made, of course, no tax would be payable in that year, but
if a profit was made in 1918, the whole of the profits up to
30th June, 1917, minus the losses to the same point of time,
would be taxable—if there was an excess, taking into considera-
tion the tax of 50 per cent, already paid on £l,lOO. This-
means that the whole of the position would have to be reviewed
from the first of the pre-war years to date.
(2) Percentage Standard.— The percentage standard is
10 per cent, on the capital of the business as existing at the end
of the last pre-war year. It is necessary before determining
the pre-war standard of profits for the purpose of comparing
with those in the accounting period to ascertain the capital
in each year, because, if the pre-war average profits are less
than 10 per cent, on the capital at the end of the pre-war year
the percentage standard must be taken instead of the average
jjrofits.
Adjustment of Income Tax. —Under the Income Tax
Act, the amount payable on account of war-time profits tax
shall be deducted, and under the War-time Profits Act there
is a deduction of income tax. It is to be noted that the deduc-
tion of income tax referred to here applies only to the income
tax paid in respect to the profits that are dutiable for war-time
profits—not the whole of the income tax paid, as there might
be income from property.
Goods Exported Before Sale. —When goods are
exported before sale, the total profit arising from the sale is
apportionable between Australia and the place of sale, on the
basis of the expenses in connection therewith incurred inside and
outside Australia respectively. The proportion of profit
attributable to Australia is taxable in Australia.
What is to be noted here is that this method of treatment
is different to that which at present prevails in connection with
income tax. Under the Income Tax Acts, if the value, at date


of export, is greater than the value at date of purchase, the
difference between these two sets of figures is the taxable
profit.
The following illustration shows the importance of the
difference in the treatment: —
Income Tax.
Cost of Goods purchased for export .. £I,OOO
Value at date exported .. .. .. .. 1,100
Taxable sum .. .. £IOO
War-time Profits Tax.
Cost of goods purchased .. .. .. £I,OOO
Sold in America for .. .. .. •• 1,500
Expenses —
• Australia .. .. •. £SO
America .. .. .. .. 75
Profit .. .. _ . • £375
The profit £375 would be divided between America and
Australia.
50 x 375
= £l5O America
125
= £225 Australia
£375
Therefore £225 would be profit under the War-time
Profits Act.
Valuation of Stock.— The safe rule in valuing stock
is to take the lower of the two, cost or market value. As the
value varies so sharply just now on account of the extraordinary
times, through which we are passing, it is a matter of extreme
difficulty to traders how to deal with the matter.
Many traders, no doubt, depreciate their stocks through
prudent motives, but, it must be remembered that unless this
policy is continued, the taxpayer might find that it does not
pay. Even if it is continued, there will come a time when the
matter will assume serious proportions, i.e., when the profit
on the goods the next year is very high, consequent upon the
writing down in the previous year, it will be a problem of
how to deal with this excess of profit, in the current year, so
far as stocks are concerned. The question of stock valuation
is a matter which should receive the immediate attention of


traders, at any rate before the excess war-time duty ceases.
It is obvious that stocks are being bought at abnormal prices
and included in the accounts at those prices, consequently
war-time duty is being paid on values which might never be
realised. It is a problem as to what effect the cessation of the
war will have on values. It is probable that values will not
drop suddenly. It will take time to dispose of these stocks
bought at pre-peace price.
The British Government proposal, which I believe has
since become law, is as follows :
“ A period (2 years), will be allowed after the termination
of the war in which to ascertain, by actual realisation, the
value of the stock appearing in the account at the end of the last
accounting period, and an allowance made from the profits of
that period, for any difference between the valuation and the
sum realised. The loss (if any), on only such stocks as were
stocks as were on hand at the end of the last accounting period,
will be brought into the adjustment, but the whole of such
stocks, not individual parcels selected by the taxpayer, must
be considered.”
Contracts Extending Beyond One Accounting
Period. — Section 15(16) requires the profit or loss or estimated
profit or loss on such contracts to be apportioned over the
accounting periods. It will require great care, on the part of
the taxpayer, in estimating the profits, as there are obviously
so many contingencies to provide for. For instance, the
contract may not be completed until after the Act has ceased
to operate, in which case, it might be that there is a loss, not
a profit, on the contract. Probably no allowance would be
made to the taxpayer for this loss. Nevertheless he should
not allow the matter to end here, but representations should
be made to the Commissioner.
Further, the profits or losses to be spread over the whole
period and each accounting period is to be debited or credited
with its statutory proportion of profit or loss. This proportion
is not governed by the actual gain or loss in the particular
period, nor by dividing the total profits by the time the work
lasted, but by calculating the proportion, the amount of the
contract performed in the particular period bears to the whole
amount to be performed. (See Illustration No. 14).
Partnerships. —The partnership is assessed as if it were
one individual, but in order to enable deductions for losses by
partners who carry on in addition separate businesses, the tax
paid by the partnership is deemed to have been paid by the
partners pro rata to their interest in the partnership business.
To that extent each partner is deemed to be carrying on
business on his own account.


COMPUTATION OF PROFITS.
No return is necessary in the case of a business which
the accounts are ordinarily made up to 30th June in each
year with a net profit, not exceeding £I,OOO for the financial
year, ending on 30th June, 1916.
This means that the £I,OOO referred to must be, as shown
by the Commonwealth Income Tax Return for June 30th,
1916, and not that as appearing in the books of the business.
Section 15 (1) states that profits shall be taken to be the
actual profits arising in the accounting period from sources
within Australia. Therefore, the Act applies to profits of
business actually tranascted in Australia. Unless a business
firm carry stocks or carry on a branch with stocks, no return
is necessary.
Section 10 (1). states that the profits arising from any
business shall be separately determined for that purpose, but
on the same principles, as the profits and gains are, or would be,
determined for the purpose of Commonwealth income tax,
subject to certain modifications. The calculation is to be
made on the same principles, but not necessarily for the same
periods, as the calculations for income tax. As pointed out,
under the heading of the “ Pre-War Standard,” the profits
are the adjusted profits arrived at on the average of previous
years ; therefore, it is necessary to take as a basis the adjusted
profits, as shown by the Income Tax Return, and then to make
the further necessary adjustments. (See Illustration No. 9).
Exemption.—(a) There is a fixed exemption of £2OO,
where the profits standard does not exceed £SOO, and where the
excess profits are not more than £2OO.
(6) In all other cases where the excess is greater than £2OO,
the exemption of £2OO is reduced by £1 for every £2 by which
the excess profits are greater than £2OO in the first assessment,
and by £1 for every £4 by which the excess profits exceed £2OO
in the subsequent years. (See Illustration No. 11).
Deduction for Management.— (a) Where the business
is owned by an individual—a deduction of £3OO or such greater
sum as the Commissioner directs in a business where the
pre-war standard of profits does not exceed £SOO.
(6) Where the pre-war standard of profits exceeds £SOO,
but is less than £I,OOO, such sum as represents the difference
between £I,OOO and the pre-war standard of profits—if the
owner devotes the whole of his time to the business.
(c) If the business is owned by a partnership—;
Where the pre-war standard of profits does not exceed
£I,OOO a deduction of £3OO or such greater sum as the Com-
missioner directs in respect of each partner who devotes the


whole of his time to the business, but the total sum to be
deducted shall, in no case, be less than the sum which represents
the difference between £I,OOO and pre-war standard of profits.
(See Illustration No. 12).
Change of Ownership of Business (16 (13) ). —Where
a business has changed ownership, since the commencement
of the last three pre-war trade years, it is to be treated as if
a new business had been commenced on the change of owner-
ship except in cases where the taxpayer makes an application
that, the business should be treated as a continuing business ;
but in that case such modifications (if any) shall be made as
may be necessary to make the basis on which the profits
standard is computed the same as that on which the profits of the
accounting period are computed.
It is quite optional for the taxpayer to adopt this course.
Of course, it might be to the advantage to the taxpayer to
have the business treated as a continuing business, as consider-
able profits might have been made by the original business.
On the other hand, it might be of more benefit to him to treat
the business as a new one. It must be understood that if
the business is treated as a continuing one, adjustments will
have to be made in the standard of profits of the old business,
so as to compare with the profits in the accounting period.
DEDUCTIONS ALLOWED, COMPARED WITH INCOME
TAX.
Before proceeding to illustrate the computation of profits
for the purpose of deciding the excess, it will be instructive
to glance at a few of the more important deductions that are
allowed from the profits of the accounting period, and to
compare them with the law as to computing income for income
tax.
War-time Profits.
1. Remuneration of Directors, Managers, Etc.—
Business established before the war may not deduct remunera-
tion exceeding the amount paid in the last pre-war trade year.
Companies which have had less than one pre-war trade
year, may not exceed £l,OOO, unless the Commissioner directs.
Income Tax. —What has legitimately been paid may be
deducted.
2. Commonwealth income tax, but only to the extent of
tax paid on profits that are taxable on account of the par-
ticular business.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
3. Sinking fund to recoup a wasting asset.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.


4. The annual sum to recoup expenditure on improvements
on leasehold property where the improvements revert to the
lessor.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
5. Where the pre-war standard does not exceed £SOO, a
special deduction of £3OO for such further sum as the Com-
missioner may allow to the owner for the management of the
business.
Income Tax. —No salary or wages drawn by the owner
may be deducted.
6. A deduction of the difference between interest paid on
borrowed money used for the acquisition of assets from the
use of which taxable profits have been derived, and 10 per cent,
on that borrowed monry.
Income Tax. —Only the actual interest paid may be
deducted.
7. Losses by fire, flood, accident, robbery, or embezzle-
ment, incurred during the accounting period, to the extent of
the amount irrecoverable from an insurance company.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
8. Alterations (but not additions) to plant, machinery
and premises, for purposes of the business which have been
charged to revenue account.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
9. Income from investments (trading or manufacturing
business).
Income Tax. —May be deducted.
10. Interest from the Commonwealth War Loan, in the
case where the principal business is the making of investments.
Income Tax. —May be deducted in all cases, whether a
trading or investment business.
11. Interest or increased capital (as defined by the Act).
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
12. Losses in any business, except a pastoral business :
(a) Where the net result of the business since the first of
the three selected pre-war trade years ;
(b) and up to the end of the accounting period immediately
preceding that upon which the current assessment is being
made has shown a loss and any part of the profits of the current
accounting period has been applied in extinction of that loss.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.
In a pastoral business —if it is shown that any part of the
profits arising during the last three pre-war trade years have
been invested in the business and have in subsequent years,
been wholly or partly lost owing to drought, adverse seasons,
or other adverse conditions, and any part of the profits of the


accounting period has been applied in extinction of that loss,
or any other loss, the part of the profit applied may be deducted
in the assessment.
Income Tax. —May not be deducted.

Trading Account.
1. Stock.— lt is necessary that the Stock at the beginning and
end should have been valued on the same basis.
This is necessary for Income Tax, but very much more for War
Time Profits Tax, on account of the comparison, which is the essential
feature of the tax.
The basis of value should be Cost or Market Price, whichever is
the lower. Some traders, no doubt, through prudential motives have
valued their Stock below Cost, in order to provide for a Secret Reserve.
Unless this policy is continued throughout the years, the extra profit
on selling will be reflected in the next year’s accounts.
2. Purchases. —It is assumed that this item does not contain
any Capital items.
3. Wages. —lf any portion has been paid to create Capital items,
it should be excluded. (See Salaries).
4. 5 & 6. Fuel, Lighting and Water, Etc. —No comment neces-
sary.
7. Repairs. —lt is assumed that this does not include additions or
improvements, which are Capital items.
8. Sales. —It is assumed that all returns and allowances have
been made.


Profit And Loss Account.
9. Salaries.—lf Salaries or Wages have been paid to the partners
these, not being allowed as deductions under the Commonwealth Income
Tax, must be added. I have assumed that each partner has been paid
£250.
10. Income Tax.—This is a proper deduction.
11. Office Rates, Lighting and Coal.—No comment is needed.
12. Repairs to Office.—This is a proper deduction.
13. Depreciation of Lease of Premises.—lt is assumed that the
Improvement in the Lease cost £lO,OOO. The term of the Lease being
20 years from Ist July, 1911. £5OO is written off yearly from the original
sum. This depreciation is not allowed under the Commonwealth
Income Tax, but is a special deduction for War Time Profits Tax.
14. Depreciation of Fixtures.—This is allowable.
15. Depreciation of Machinery.—As the rates for Income Tax
purposes, vary, it is assumed that this charge is in excess by £5O each
year, that would be allowed under the Income Tax Acts.
I have done this to show the necessity of a careful review of the
position.
16. Interest on Partners’ Capital.—This is not allowed.
17. Interest on Loan.—This is allowable, but as the rate of
Interest paid is less than the Statutory Rate, viz., 10%, the difference
must be deducted from Pre War Profits, as it will be deducted from the
Profits in the Accounting period when the Capital is adjusted.
18. Written off Goodwill.—This is not allowed.
19. Reserve.—This is not allowed.
20. Depreciation of Investments.—As this is not allowed as a
deduction, the Income from the Investments is deducted from the
Profits in the Accounting period.
21. Preliminary Expenses in Establishing Branch.—These
are not allowed.
22. Provision for Bad Debts. —Not allowed. But if Bad Debts
have been actually written off against this provision, they would be
allowed.
23. Dividends on Investments. —This is not to be included, as
the War Time Profits Act excludes this item from the taxable profits,
and the Capital Value, as appearing in the Balance Sheet, deducted
from the Capital.
24. Profits Made in America and England on Goods Exported
before Sale. —These are not taxable.
THE PERCENTAGE STANDARD.
ILLUSTRATION No. 3.
The “ Percentage Standard ” is 10 per cent, on the Capital of the
business as existing at the end of the last pre-War year.
It is necessary, before determining the pre-War Standard of Profits
for the purpose of comparing with those in the Accounting period, to
ascertain the Capital in each year, because if the pre-War average profits
are less than 10 % on the Capital at the end of the pre-War year, the
Percentage Standard is to be taken instead of the average profits,
and also to ascertain the variation of Capital.


The following are the adjusted Profits
of a Business on 31st July :—

The Average Profits and Capital of the 2 highest Pre-War Years
will be taken as follows :—

„ Profit is

A BUSINESS WITH 3 PRE-WAR TRADE YEARS.
The percentage on Capital at end of the last pre-War trade year
is £11,500 @ 10 % = £1,150.
Therefore the percentage Standard will be taken, as the Standard
Percentage on Capital is greater than the Average Profits.
A BUSINESS WITH LESS THAN 3 PRE-WAR YEARS.
ILLUSTRATION No. 4.
Where there have not been 3 Pre-War Trade Years, but only 2,
the Pre-War Standard of Profits will be the greater of the Profits of
those two years, or if there has been a loss in one year and a Profit
in the other, the Profits of the year in which a Profit was made.
The Adjusted Profits of a Firm which commenced business on Ist
September 1911, are as follows :
Year ending 31st August 1912 . . . . . . 1,500
„ „ „ „ 1913 .. .. .. 600
Profits Standard.
1912 .. .. £1,500
1913 .. .. 600
In this case as the Profit of 1912 is greater than the Profit in 1913,
the taxpayer will select the year 1912 as the Standard.
If, on the other hand, there had been a loss in 1913, the result
would have been just the same.


PRE-WAR PERIOD LESS THAN 2 YEARS.
ILLUSTRATION No. 5.
Where there has been only one Pre-War Trade Year, the Pre-War
Standard shall be taken to be the Profit of that year.
Assume that the adjusted Profit for 1913 is £3OO, and that the
Capital employed in that year is £1,500.
The Profits Standard is £3OO, because there have not been 2 com-
plete Pre-War Trade Years.
The Percentage Standard is 10 %on £1,500 = £l5O.
As the Profits Standard is less than £5OO, the Pre-War Standard
of Profits is £5OO.
In this case expenses of management, £3OO, will be deducted from
the Profit in the Accounting Period (15 (9a) ).
PRE-WAR PERIOD LESS THAN ONE YEAR.
ILLUSTRATION No. 6.
Recent Commencement of Business (16 (6) ).
(1) Business commenced on Ist January 1914.
(2) The owner had been in receipt of a Salary of £l,OOO per annum.
(3) The whole of this £l,OOO had been reduced as the owner has
left his former employment.
(4) Average Capital of the new Business during the Accounting
Period is £4,000.
(5) 7 months trading (1/1/14 to 1/8/14), resulted in a Profit of
£350 (equals £6OO for one year).
10 %on Capital = £4OO.
Diminution in former Income £l,OOO.
As the percentage of Capital, viz. £4OO, is less than £l,OOO, the
Pre-War Standard of Profits is £l,OOO (Former income).
ABNORMAL DEPRESSION IN PRE-WAR PERIOD.
ILLUSTRATION No. 7.
Where it is shown, in the case of any business, that the last 3 pre-
war trade years have been years of abnormal depression, any two of
the three preceding pre-war trade years, may be substituted for the
purposes of the pre-war Standard of profits for any two of the last three
pre-war trade years. (16 (4) ).
The last three pre-war trade years shall not be considered as years
of abnormal depression, unless the average profits of those years have
been at least 25% lower than the average profits of the preceding three
years.
The following are the adjusted Profits of a Company :
Year ending 30th June 1909 Profit £60,000
1910 „ 64,000
1911 „ 45,000
1912 „ 35,000
1913 „ 40,000
1914 „ 36,000


The average profits of the last Pre-war Years are as follows :
1912 .. £35,000
1913 .. 40,000
1914 .. 36,000

less 25% is therefore £39,750, which is £2,750 greater than the average
of the last three pre-war years.

In every case in which the Pre-War Standard of Profits does not
exceed £5OO there is a fixed general exemption of £2OO in the case of
each taxable business whose excess profits are not more than £2OO. When
the excess is greater than £2OO, the exemption of £2OO is reduced by
£1 for every £2, by which the excess profits are greater than £2OO in
the first assessment, and by £1 for every £4 by which the excess profit
exceed £2OO in the subsequent years.
The excess profits are reduced by this amount if they are the
profits of a full year. If less than a full year’s profits are being assessed
the exemption calculated as above is proportionately reduced. (Section
7 (3 and 5) ).
The £2OO disappears when excess profits reach £6OO and £l,OOO
respectively.

As the Profit Standard is less than £5OO the taxpayer is entitled
to use as his pre-war standard of profits £5OO, and to deduct the full

devoted to the business.)
Thus :

In any case, if the Net Profits for 1916 do not exceed £l,OOO, no

Note.— Where a business is owned by an individual or a partner-
ship and the previous pre-w r ar standard of profits based upon the aatual
profits does not exceed £5OO, there is to be an allowance of at least
£3OO, for the individual owner, and the same amount for each partner
who devotes the whole of his time to the business. (15 (9) ).
ILLUSTRATION No. 12.
A PARTNERSHIP BUSINESS IN WHICH THE PRE-WAR STANDARD OF
PROFITS IS LESS THAN £1,000.
If the business is owned by a partnership—in the case of a business
in which the Pre-War Standard of Profits does not exceed £l,OOO, a
deduction of £3OO or such greater, sum as the Commissioner directs shall
be allowed in respect of each partner who devotes the whole of his time
to the business, or a part of that amount proportionate to the time
devoted to the business, but the total sum to be deducted shall, in no
case, be less than the sum which represents the difference between
£l,OOO and the Pre-War Standard of Profits.
Commenced Ist September 1910 ; the profits were as follows ;
1911 .. £3OO

Contracts Extending Beyond one Accounting Period.
A large factory takes 3 years to complete.
The Contract was begun on June 1915, and therefore extends
beyond one accounting period.
The Contract Price is £50,000.
The building is not yet completed.


It was estimated, at the time the Contract was entered into, that
there would be a profit of £lO,OOO, but this estimate, in the light of
later events, viz., Strikes, lock-outs, and the increased cost of materials,
has to be revised at the end of 1915, and it is estimated that only £3,000
profit will result.
In 1915 £2,000 was estimated as the profit earned, and included in
the Income Tax Return.
In 1915-16 the value of the actual work performed was £15,000
the proportion of this to the whole of the work is 3/10ths.
In 1916-17 the value of the actual work performed in that year
was £15,000, the proportion of this to the whole work is 3/10ths.
Therefore, as the estimated Profit in 1915, is £3,000 the proportions
of Profit are ;
In 1915 3/10ths of £3,000 = £9OO
„ 1916 3/10ths of £3,000 = 900
„ 1917 2/sths of £3,000 = 1,200
£3,000
Note.— lt will be seen from this illustration that if the profit of
£3,000 was divided by the number of years, viz., 3 ; £l,OOO each year
would be added to the profits of the year, and as 1916 is the Excess War
Profits Tax Year, the Contractor would be over taxed by £5O.
In 1917 the taxpayer would have to pay, if he adopted the former
method, 75% of £l,OOO = £750, whereas if the method as shown in
illustration is adopted, the tax would only be £675.
PAPER READ BY MR. T. F. BRENNAN, A.I.A.V.
CAPITAL.
The question as to what amount of capital is employed
in any business may have a material bearing on the War-time
Profits Tax which may be levied on that business.
As has been stated earlier in the evening the amount of
the profits which are taxable as war time profits in respect
of any business is the amount by which the profits of the
war-time year exceeds the pre-war standard. Broadly, that
standard is either the “ profits standard ” or the “ percentage
standard,” —the profits standard being the average of the
best two of the three years immediately preceding the war,
and the percentage standard, —an amount which is equal to
the statutory percentage, i.e. 10% —on the capital employed
in the business at the end of the last pre-war year. If the
profits standard is the greater of the two it will become the
standard by comparison with which the war-time profits are
arrived at, and if during the war-time accounting period no


variation in the capital employed in the business has taken
place the amount thereof, will not be of great importance so
far as the war-time profits tax is concerned. If, however,
the percentage standard be greater than the profits standard,
or if there should be any increase or decrease in the amount
of capital employed in the war-time years—which, as regards
this tax, are the years commencing on the Ist July, 1915,
and ending on the 30th June next after the declaration of
peace in connection with the present war—it will be necessary
to ascertain the amounts thereof as such amounts will have a
direct effect on the amount of the tax payable by the business.
Similarly, although borrowed money is not capital, if there has
been an increase or decrease in the amount of borrowed money
so used it will be necessary to take such increase or decrease
into account and make an adjustment of the excess profits on
the basis of the difference between the interest paid and ten
per cent.
Definition of Capital. —The definition of Capital as given
in the Act is that it is to mean the capital of a business employed
in Australia. The amount of the capital employed in any
business is to be taken to be :
(a) the amount of capital paid up by the owner in money
or in kind ;
( b ) all accumulated trading profits invested in the busi-
ness ; and,
(c) the addition or deduction (as the case may be) of the
credit or debit balance respectively of profit and loss brought
forward from previous years.
But, any capital the income on which is not taken into
account for the purposes of the Act ( i.e . which is not taxable)
must be excluded in computing the amount of the capital for
the purposes of the Act ; and in any case in which money paid
into or credited to a business is not drawn upon for the pur-
poses of that business such money also must be excluded in
computing the amount of the capital.
Capital as defined by the Act does not include borrowed
money, but if borrowed money has been used for the creation
or acquisition of assets which are used for the purpose of
earning profit in the business it must be taken into account
in very much the same way as capital. While, therefore,
as has been previously stated, borrowed money is not con-
sidered to be capital it is given the benefit of the statutory
percentage which is applicable to capital if it (the borrowed
money) has been used for acquiring or creating profit —earning


assets, and lias not been repaid —that is, the difference
between the interest paid and ten per cent, on the amount
of the borrowed money is to be deducted both from the
pre-war standard and the war-time profits before the taxable
excess is arrived at. In this connection it may be mentioned
that the ten per cent, which is deductible, as above mentioned,
is- not ten per cent, per annum, but ten per cent, of the
borrowed money which has not been repaid at the end
of the accounting period, irrespective of whether it has
been in use in the business for the whole of the year or
not. For example, if in the middle of the first accounting
period, a miller had installed machinery to the value of £5,000
and had borrowed that sum of money at 6% per annum as
from the Ist January, 1916, in order to pay for the installa-
tion he would be entitled to deduct from his war-time profits
the sum of £350, which as will be observed, is arrived at in
the following manner 10 per cent, on £5,000 amounts to
£SOO, from which is to be deducted the amount of interest
charged to profit and loss account before the profits were
arrived at, viz., interest for six months on £5,000 at 6 % per
annum, or £l5O.
Accumulated Trading Profits. — It will have been
noted that in the definition of capital the first item is the
amount paid into the business by the owner in money or in
kind. Except in the case of a business which has not kept
proper books and in respect of which no proper Balance Sheet
has been prepared, the amount of money paid in by the owner
will be readily ascertainable. It therefore requires no com-
ment. The item “ accumulated trading profits ” may, how-
ever, present some difficulty. Although not disclosed on the
balance-sheet it does not follow that such profits do not exist.
If, for example, the assets have been written down by means
of charges against the Profit and Loss Account to an amount
which is less than their actual value there will be a secret
reserve which will represent accumulated trading profits. A
familiar example of such writing down is to be found in con-
nection with business premises which are not infrequently
carried on the books and shown on the balance-sheet at a
sum which is less than their realizable value under the most
adverse conditions.
In such a case if the sfecret reserve has been formed prior
to the war-time period, and if the jiercentage standard is
adopted for the purpose of arriving at the war-time excess
profits it is distinctly in the interest and to the advantage
of the business to have the amount of the undisclosed accumu


lated profits included in and added to the amount of the
capital. For instance, if it should happen that the pre-war
standard of profits is less than the percentage standard
obviously the taxpayer will adopt the percentage standard,
and if in such a case it should be that in more prosperous years
his business premises or other assets had been written down
from profits to a sum that is, say, £5,000 less than their real
worth, the inclusion of that amount in his capital will increase
his percentage standard by £SOO, and diminish his war-time
excess profits by a corresponding amount. If, however, the
secret reserve had been formed in the pre-war period, and if
the profits standard were adopted, it would similarly be to
the interest of the taxpayer to have his pre-war profits
adjusted accordingly.
Profit and Loss Balances. — Any balance —whether
credit or debit —of the profit and Iqss account brought forward
from a previous year is an addition or deduction as the case
may be to or from the capital account, but if profits be
brought forward and distributed during the accounting year,
a decrease of capital will be effected and an adjustment of
the profits will be required under the provisions of Section
12 of the Act.
Reserves. —We have just seen that accumulated trading
profits hidden in a secret reserve may be capital, but a reserve
formed by the writing up of the assets of the business will
not be accepted as capital, nor will the profit arising from
the sale of one or more of the fixed assets of the business,
unless such profit has been capitalized. In other words
profits which have been made otherwise than by trading will
not be considered to be capital in respect of which a deduction
will be allowed from the taxable profits. The Act provides
that if an asset be acquired, otherwise than by being purchased
and paid for in cash, its value, so far as the capital account is
concerned is to be taken to be the value when it was acquired or
created. It is pointed out that an asset may be acquired
without purchase in consideration of services rendered, by
gift, under a will or intestacy or a settlement ; by a partner-
ship on its formation the individual partners contributing
their respective shares of the capital in kind ; by a company
on its formation, the principal, shareholder or shareholders
transferring to the company certain assets in consideration
of the issue of shares to the value of such assets ; by adverse pos-
session ; and by grant from the Crown. In none of these cases
is it permissible, by writing up the value of the assets, to in-
crease the capital and thereby obtain the benefit of the allow


ance which under the Act is granted in respect of the excess
protits on account of increased capital.
Goodwill.— Where the business of a firm or a private
trader is converted into a Company and shares are issued to
the owner or owners to the value of the amount represented
by goodwill in the assets of the new Company no value will
be allowed in the capital account for the shares which repre-
sent the goodwill, nor will any value be allowed for other than
the material assets of the Company unless the Commissioner,
in any special circumstances, otherwise directs. But patents
and secret processes will be deemed to be material assets.
Goodwill which has been paid for in cash, as for example, on
the purchase of a business, is allowable as capital. If in such
a case the goodwill has been written off from profits, the
amount so written off may, if the goodwill still retains its
original value to the business, be represented by accumulated
trading profits in the same way as a secret reserve which has
already been referred to. And in like manner if the percentage
standard be adopted as the pre-war standard of profits it
will be to the interest of the taxpayer to claim the benefit of
the increased capital equal to the original value of the goodwill
if it still retains the value which attached to it when it was
purchased or such lesser value (if any) which now attaches,
but he will be required to demonstrate to the Commissioner
what its value actually is.
Depreciation.— The proper depreciation of the assets
is a matter of importance. It is, of course, a truism to say
that no profit can be correctly arrived at until an adequate
amount has been charged to the profit and loss account to
cover the depreciation which has been incurred in earning
the income of the period to w r hich the profit and loss account
relates. If depreciation has not been fully charged the
profits will have been overstated. If on the other hand exces-
sive depreciation had been charged the profits will have been
understated, and in either case an adjustment is required.
If in the latter case the excessive depreciation has been
written off in the pre-war years it will be to the advantage of
the taxpayer to see that the necessary adjustment is made,
so that he may get the benefit of a better pre-war standard.
If the profits standard be adopted as the standard by which
the war-time excess protfis are to be arrived at the pre-war
profits will be increased by the amount by which it can be
demonstrated that the amount written off for depreciation
in the years in question was greater than the depreciation
incurred in earning the income of those years. If, however,


the percentage standard be that which is adopted the excess
amount written off will really be accumulated trading profits
and the addition of the amount thereof to the capital will
result in the pre-war standard being increased and the excess
war-time profits correspondingly reduced. Ordinary repairs
and maintenance of plant cannot be considered to be capital
expenditure, but where in making alterations to a plant an
addition has been made to its capacity the expenditure in-
volved in obtaining such added capacity will necessarily be
capital expenditure.
The Act makes provision for deductions in a number of
cases where, owing to the war, expenditure must be post-
poned or curtailed or where expenditure has been incurred
for war purposes. In particular, deductions in respect of the
following matters relating to the capital assets are allowable :
(а) repairs and renewals of assets the expenditure on
which, in consequence of the war, must be postponed or sus-
pended ;
(б) exceptional depreciation or obsolescence, due to the
war, of assets employed in business;
(c) the necessity in connection with the war of providing
plant which will not be wanted for the purposes of the business
after the war ;
( d ) liabilities incurred in a business at the instance of
the Commonwealth Government in pursuance of the war-
time policy of the Government.
The deductions in such cases will be fixed by the Commis
sioner from whose decision, however, the taxpayer, if dissatis-
fied, may appeal to the Board of Referees. It may reasonably
be assumed, I think, that where a taxpayer has expended
capital in the provision of plant which is required for war
purposes but which will not be required for the purposes of
the business after the war, he will be allowed to write down the
value of that plant to its value for sale and removal.
Wasting Assets. — Wasting Assets and leasehold pro-
perty are accorded special treatment. A wasting asset, as
defined by the Act, includes a mine (other than a coal mine)
a quarry, timber rights, and any similar asset which through
gradual removal of the substance of the asset becomes exhausted.
It is provided that, where the profits of a business arise wholly
or partly from the use of a wasting asset, a deduction may be
made from the excess profits of such amount as it would be
necessary to contribute to a sinking fund in order to liquidate


the amount expended in purchasing or acquiring the wasting
asset when such asset has become exhausted.
Sinking Funds. —In calculating the amount of the con-
tribution required to be made to such a sinking fund the period
for which it is estimated that the asset will remain profitable
must be calculated from the date on which it was first used by
the owner of the business as a wasting asset for the purpose
of that business. This estimate must be made as at the end
of the accounting period then being dealt with and presum-
ably, though this is not specifically stated in the Act, in the
light of the latest available information. The reason for the
exclusion of coal mines in the definition of wasting assets is
not apparent to me. The experience so far gained in this
State, of coal mining, is not extensive, as the industry, as
regards privately owned mines at least, has never been of
relatively great importance, but, such as it is, it goes to show
that a coal mine is certainly a wasting asset. However the
matter of the non-allowance to Victorian coal mines of the deduc-
tion provided in the Act for other wasting assets will probably
not be of great moment. A deduction is also allowed in the
case of a mine (other than a coal mine) of any amount which
has been appropriated out of profits in the accounting period
for development or for new plant, but if any amount so appro-
priated is not expended before the end of the following account-
ing period the amount unexpended shall if it would otherwise
have been war-time profits be liable to tax at the rate in force
at the time of appropriation.
In the case of a leasehold property for which a premium,
in addition to the agreed rent, has been paid, or in respect of
which the lessee has undertaken to spend money in improve-
ments which will revert to the lessor at the termination of
the lease, a deduction shall be allowed equal to the amount
obtained by dividing the amount of the premium or the
amount expended in improvements by the number of years
unexpired, of the lease, when the premium was paid or the
expenditure on improvements incurred.
Exempt Businesses. —Amongst other businesses which
are exempt from the war-time profits tax are those of agricul-
ture, fruit-growing and the maintenance of dairy herds for
the supply of dairy products. One or other of these businesses,
particularly agriculture, is frequently carried on in conjunction
with the pastoral industry. In such a case an apportionment
of the capital used in each business would be required and it
can readily be seen that some very fine points and distinctions
would probably arise in making an apportionment of this


character. The following illustration is given by the Commis-
sioner of Taxation of the method of making the apportionment
in what is considered to be a typical case :
“A. is a wheat farmer and sheep owner. He occupies,
say, 1,000 acres of land, all of which is arable. Assuming
that his stock occupies half his land while the other half is
being tilled his capital might be estimated as follows ;
Agricultural business 500 acres @ say £4 .. £2,000
Pastoral business 500 acres @ say £4 .. .. 2,000
Live Stock 500 Sheep @ 30/- ~ .. 750
£2,750
It is probable that some addition may be made to the
capital of the pastoral industry if it can be shown that the
tilled land is used for pastoral purposes at any time in the
year. Any claim in this respect must be supported by con-
clusive evidence to the Department.”
Pastoral Industry,— A good deal of space has been
devoted in the Commissioner’s hand-book to the Pastoral
Industry and to the assessment of persons engaged in that
industry,it being pointed out that such assessments arc governed
by circumstances which are not found in any other business,
namely, the natural increase and deaths of stock, but I am
afraid that the limit which has been set to the length of these
papers will preclude me from giving as much attention to
this division of the subject as I think should be given-to
it by a gathering such as this is. The capital of a pastoralist
will consist of money invested in land, improvements, live
stock, plant and machinery, etc., accumulated trading profits,
trade credit balance, and of live stock acquired without pur-
chase, the latter item covering the natural increase of the
flock.
The Taxation Department has prescribed by regulation
the method of arriving at the capital invested by a pastoralist
in his live stock, the basis being :
(1) Live stock on hand at the beginning of the first of
the three pre-war trade years or (in the case of a business
which has not had three pre-war trade years) of the first
trading year must be valued at cost if the cost price is known ;
but if the cost price is not known the live stock on hand must
be valued at the Departmental standard value ;
(2) All natural increase in each year must be valued at
the Departmental standard for natural increase ;


(3) All purchases in each year must be shown at purchase
price ;
(4) Live stock on hand at the end of each year must be
valued at the average price per head ascertained from clauses
1,2, and 3 hereof.
The standard values for natural increases in this State
are : —Lambs 12/6 ; Calves £6 ; Foals £l5.
There are some further points of interest to which I should
like to refer but the time at my disposal will not admit of my
doing so. Before concluding the paper, however, I must
make mention of the effect which an increase or a decrease of
Capital will have on the taxable profits.
Effect of Fluctuating Capital on Profits. — The
provisions of the Act in this regard are that in any case in
which during the accounting period ( i.e . any period of 12 months
for which the accounts of the business are made up and which
ends after 30/6/15) increased capital has been employed on
the business a deduction shall be made from the profits of
the accounting period of—
(а) The statutory percentage (10 %) per annum on the
amount of the increased capital ; or
(б) The percentage per annum (on the increased capital)
of the profits standard on the average capital and borrowed
money (if any) used in the pre-war trade years—
whichever is the greater, the deductions to be proportional to
the part of the accounting period during which the additional
capital has been employed.
In the event of decreased capital being employed an
addition to the profits is to be made, the basis of arriving at
the addition being similar to that just mentioned regarding
the deduction from profits. But, if the decrease in the capital
has been due to compulsory dispossession {e.g. owing to unin-
sured assets being lost by fire, flood, etc.) the profits of the
accounting period shall not be increased.
These provisions are necessary to allow of the war-time
ptofits being compared on a like basis with those of the pre-
war years. Otherwise the profits of a business employing
increased capital in the war-time years might show excess
profits although the same percentage was earned in both
periods. For example : —Capital in war-time years £lOO,OOO ;
Profits £12,000; Capital pre-war years £60,000; Profits
£7,200.


There are thus apparently excess profits of £4,800, but
when the adjustment provided by the Act is made, i.e. when
a deduction is made from the war-time profits of the amount
which is equal to the profits standard on the increased capital
—£40,000 at 12 % —it is found that there are no excess profits.
At the conclusion of the reading of the last paper the
Chairman said that he thought they had received an immense
amount of information in tabloid form. The matter was open
for discussion, and they would endeavour to answer any
relevant question ; but, he asked that speakers would be brief
as the papers, greatly condensed as they were, had occupied
more time than anticipated. There was no discussion ; but
a few questions were asked, the only one of importance being
put by Mr. R. W. Norman, A.1.A.V., who said he had travelled
700 miles to be present. He wished to know whether the
proceeds of fruit, etc. left at credit of members of a Co-
operative Society, upon which interest was allowed them,
would be liable to taxation as borrowed money (capital). Mr.
Brennan in reply said that as Current A/c Credit balances or
money at call, with banks, was not liable to be treated as
borrowed money, he opined that the proceeds in question,
would also be exempt.
Mr. E. E. Keep (President Victorian Employers’ Federa-
tion) moved a vote of thanks to the Chairman and the three
gentlemen who had given them so much valuable information.
He hoped that the papers would be printed as he was sure there
would be a large demand for them. Mr. Keep, himself, put
the motion asking that it be carried by acclamation, which
was most heartily accorded.
