INSTRUCTIONS TO COMMISSIONERS.
Department of Public Lands,
Brisbane, 24th February, 1877.
SlB,
As “ The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876 ” will come into
operation on the Ist proximo, it is desirable that the Land Commissioners
and Land Agents should be made acquainted with the particular points in
which its provisions differ from those of the Act of 1868 ; I have therefore
subjoined, under the several headings which it is desirable to advert to, the
necessary instructions for your guidance, which I trust will supply all that
is required for working the Act.
Registration of Applications.
1. The procedure in regard to the lodgment and acceptance of appli-
cations will mainly continue the same as heretofore. There will be an
Application Book, called in the Act “ The Eegister of Applications,” in
which the applicant or his duly constituted attorney will require to sign his
name, for the purpose of establishing his right of priority over any subse-
quent application. The book used as a Eegister of Selections under the Act
of 1868 (and supplied by the Audit Office), in which all payments are
entered, is to be used for the entries under the new Act,—a strong line being
drawn below the last entry under the Act of 1868, and the words “ The
Cbown Lands Alienation Act of 1876 ” being written immediately above
the first entry under the last-mentioned Act. The numbers of the selections
under the Act of 1876 will follow the last number under the Act of 1868, in
consecutive order ; as, I believe, it will be found more convenient to have a
continuous series of numbers in each district, than to commence a new series
under each Act. A Eegister of the Bailiffs on each selection, which can be
posted up from the agreements required to be lodged under the provisions of
sub-section 4 of section 28, will also require to be kept for the purpose of
reference when the selectors apply for their certificates.
Lands open to Selection.
2. The only lands open to selection under the Act on the Ist March,
when the Act of 1876 comes into operation, are —Ist. The unselected country
lands in the Settled Districts; 2nd. The unselected lands within Homestead
Areas; and 3rd. The unselected country lands within Town Eeserves open
respectively to selection under the Act of 1868 at the time of its repeal. The
upset prices and maximum areas allowed to be selected of these several
classes of laud will be proclaimed on the Ist March, and the information
contained, therein will be communicated to you by wire before that date, so
that you may be able to receive applications on the day the new Act comes
into operation.
Portions of the lands resumed from runs during the last session of
Parliament will also be declared open to selection at dates which will be
specified in the proclamations. Further information in regard to these
lands will be conveyed to you from time to time.


Selections under Act of 1876.
3. Persons who hold selections under the Act of 1868 may make applica-
tions for adjoining land subject t) the restriction as regards boundaries
contained in the Act, and provided also that the maximum area of 5,120
acres is not exceeded. Selectors, however, Avho have resided personally on
their selections, whether under the Acts of 1868 or 1876, for a yeir, may
make another selection subject to the maximum area as above not being
exceeded. In such cases the declaration in accordance with Form Gin the
regulations must be made by the applicant and be attached to the applica-
tion. With these exceptions, no person can hold more than one selection
under the Act of 1876.
Date of Proclamation must he affixed to each Application to select.
4. As the upset price and maximum area allowed to be selected of all
land open to selection under the Act requires to be proclaimed, it will be
necessary to give the date of proclamation on all applications to select, in
order that a proper check may be established on the work of the Land
Agents. This will only apply to conditional purchases, as the upset price
of Homesteads is fixed by the Act and will not be affected by any procla-
mation of upset prices, whether within or outside Homestead areas.
Simultaneous Applications.
5. When there are simultaneous applications to select the same land, it
will be necessary to offer the land at auction amongst the applicants, when
the applications are dealt with at the Land Court. In the 7th and Bth
sections of the general regulations under the Act you will find the procedure
defined. When the applications comprise the same land there will be no
difficulty in dealing with them ; but in cases where numerous applications
overlap, it will require great care on your part to ascertain the particular
areas which will require to be competed for, —the principle of the Act being
that only that land which is applied for simultaneously should be submitted
to auction. This is fair, as there may be instances in which a
small selection overlaps a very large one, and under such circumstances it
would not be equitable to require the applicant for the larger area to compete
for the remainder of the land included in his selection, for which he is the
only applicant.
In dealing with applications which overlap each other to a small extent,
you will endeavour to adjust, if possible, the boundaries, without prejudice
to the interests of any of the selectors, with the view of securing to each a
definite area, and so get rid of the necessity of submitting the land to com-
petition ; but this will not authorise you to ignore the rights of any of the
selectors, nor to take such action as will prove detrimental to the revenue.
When an applicant acquires the title to the land included in an overlap
by competition, the rent of the selection will be raised proportionately to
the area competed for, the balance of the land being leased at the upset
price fixed by the proclamation.
You will perceive that Homestead Selectors are entitled to priority
over Conditional Purchase Selectors when they are simultaneous applicants.
When Homestead Selectors are themselves simultaneous applicants, the
land will require to be submitted to auction in the same way as in the case
of Conditional Purchases.


Notice of Withdraival to he forwarded to Pastoral Lessee.
6. In the case of lands resumed from runs, subject to the provisions of
“ The Settled Districts Pastoral Leases Act of 1876,” you will cause the
Land Agent to forward a notification of withdrawal (a supply of which will
be sent to you) to the Lessee of the Eun, as prescribed in sections G and 7
of that Act.
Ltnprovements. on Lands selected.
7. When improvements are upon lands open to selection, you will
proceed according to the usage adopted under the Act of 1868, unless the
lands have been resumed subject to “• The Settled Districts Pastoral Leases
Act of 1876,” as in the case of the resumptions to be proclaimed on the Ist
March, or the runs hitherto resumed, as per margin, when you will adopt
the course prescribed in, sub-sections 8,0, and 10 of section 4 ot that Act,
to which 1 beg to draw your attention.
■ In the case of arbitrations for the purpose of determining the value of
improvements or otherwise, under “ 2he Settled Districts Pastoral Leases
Act of 1876,” the forms to be used are similar to the forms H, K, L, M in
the General Regulations, with the substitution of the title of the above Act
instead of “ The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876.”
Business in connection with Selections under Act of 1868.
8. Any business reqivring to be transacted in connection with selections
under the Act of 1868, in the case of applications for certificates or other-
wise, may be dealt with at your monthly courts, gazetted under the new
Act. A notification to that effect will appear in the Gazette.
Timber Licenses.
9. The timber regulations established under the Act of 1876 provide
for the issue of licenses by the Land Commissioner instead of by the
Benches of Magistrates. The regulations sufficiently define the duties
which devolve upon you in regard thereto, and I would suggest that you
should lose no time in acquainting yourself with the nature of the work
placed in your hands, so that no inconvenience will be experienced by the
public, and also, that by giving a careful attention to this branch of your
duties, the land revenue may be increased. In a separate letter I have
drawn attention to this subject, and have solicited suggestions which your
local knowledge may enable you to supply.
Bailiff of Crown Lands.
10. It is proposed to place the Bailiff's of Crown lands more under your
control and supervision than they have hitherto been. These officers will
therefore in all cases receive their instructions and forward their reports
through you. This will be understood as referring to the general conduct
of business, and will not preclude the Minister from directing the bailiff,
should occasion arise, from executing any order he may give him.
Powers of two Justices.
11, You will observe that by the Act you are empowered to exercise the
some powers and authority as any two Justices of the Peace. This will not
entitle you to deal with any cases out of your jurisdiction as Land Commis-
sioner, but is for the purpose of placing you in the position of being able to
enforce the attendance of witnesses, and to uphold order in your Court. A
form of summons is supplied in the Regulations which is to be used when
the attendance of witnesses is required.


12. In conclusion, I have to request tliat you will read tlie Act and the
Regulations attentively, and also examine the several forms, so that you may
be able to supply all necessary information respecting the Act to any person
making inquiries on the subject. Supplies of these forms will be forwarded
as soon as they are printed, as well as maps showing the resumed lands which
it is proposed to declare open to selection in April.
I also forward copies of “ The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876 ’*
and “ Settled Districts Pastoral Lands Act of 1876,” together with drafts of
the Regulations which will be proclaimed on the Ist of March.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
W. ALCOCK TULLY,
Under Secretary.

It is hereby notified that applications under the provisions of the forty-

fourteen years of the runs in the unsettled districts, the current leases of
which will expire on and after the 31st December, 1870, may be addressed

Chief Commissioner of Crown Lands.
Department of Public Lands,
Brisbane, 2nd September, 1870.
His Excellency the Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council,
has been pleased to establish the following Regulations under the provisions
of "The Pastoral Leases Act of 1869,” for regulating the proceedings of
valuers appraising the rent of runs during the terms of renewed leases for
pastoral purposes.
By His Excellency’s Command,
J. MALBON THOMPSON.
Regulations.
1. The appointment of assessors and umpires for the purpose of valuing
runs and appraising the rents to be charged thereon, and also the mode of
procedure in conducting the appraisement so far as prescribed, shall bo
carried out in accordance with the provisions of the 46th, 47th, 48th, and
49th sections of the Act.
2. Before entering on any appraisement, the assessors and umpire shall
eachfrespectively make a declaration in the form set forth in the 70tn section


of the Act, and in the schedule annexed, that they have no direct or indirect
pecuniary interest in the matter in question. These declarations will require
to be attached to the award in each appraisement.
3. After the requirements of the preceding clauses have been complied
with, the valuers shall proceed to procure such evidence as may be necessary
for the appraisement of the rent to be paid for the run during the term of
renewed lease, in the following manner:—
(a.) The gross area of the run shall be determined as nearly as practicable.
\h.) The proportion of the gross area which may be wholly unavailable
for pastoral purposes at all seasons of the year shall be estimated,
but such amount of unavailable area shall never be computed at more
than one-half the gross area of the run. The gross area, and the area
unavailable for pastoral purposes, shall be entered on the form B.
(e.) The quantity ox stock which the run is capable of depasturing in
average years shall be determined, and the number of sheep and cattle
shall be entered separately on the form B.
(d.) The grazing capabilities of the run having been determined, the
annual rent shall be computed at a rate ranging from one pound to
four pounds per square mile of the available area, according to its
capabilities for grazing stock; but as every run, in pursuance of the
23rd section of the Act, is deemed capable of carrying at least one
hundred sheep or twenty head of cattle per square mile, this estimate
may be adopted as a standard for the guidance of the valuers, who
will thereby be enabled to determine the cases in which the minimum
rent allowed by the Act may be appraised.
(c.) Should the assessors deem that the special advantages of the run are
such that any further amount of rent should be charged, they are to
enter the amount thereof in the form B, and the total sum of such
valuation shall be the rent appraised.
4. The following forms shall be those used for the purposes of these
Regulations:—
