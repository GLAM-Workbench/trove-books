THE MELBOURNE
It is a remarkable fact that the two
institutions of which the colony of
Victoria has most reason to be proud ?
its University and its Public Library?
were founded at a period when, and
under circumstances sufficient, in the
estimation of most people, to render
the initiation and accomplishment
of such an enterprise improbable in
the extreme. Thirty years ago, the
settlement of Port Phillip formed
part of the colony of New South Wales.
It had only been occupied for fifteen
or sixteen years, and, at the com-
mencement of 1851, it contained a
population of less than 100,000 souls,
scattered over a territory about equal
in area to that of England and Wales.
Its chief port and only large town had
received the name of her Majesty?s
first Prime Minister and political
preceptor. The surveyor who laid it
out, and who is still living, seems
to have had some happy prescience
of its future magnitude, and he
gave a width of three chains to five
great thoroughfares running east and
west, and to nine others running north
and south. The discovery of gold
in 1851 occurred almost simultane-
ously with the separation of the dis-
trict from New South Wales, and its
erection into a distinctive colony, upon
which was conferred the name of otir
Gracious Sovereign. An immense in-
flux of immigrants took place, and
society was completely unhinged by
the rapidity of its growth, by the
dislocation of all its industries, and
by the vast amount of treasure which
was exhumed from the bosom of the
earth. It would be scarcely an ex-
aggeration to describe it as a period
of delirium. The population of Vic-
toria, which had been only 76,000 in
1850, rose to 364,000 in 1855, and to
537,000 in 1860. In four years the

revenue of the colony increased from a
quarter of a million to nearly three
millions and a quarter; the total im-
ports, which had been of the value of
only in 1850, amounted to
17,659,05 H. in 1854; and the value
of the gold raised, between 1851 and
1860 inclusive, amounted to the pro-
digious sum of Property
rose in value enormously ; fortunes of
fabulous amount were made in trade
and commerce ; a powerful impulse
was communicated to speculation and
enterprise of every description; and
the one word in everybody?s mouth
at this feverish period was ?gold :
? Gold ! gold ! gold ! gold !
Bright and yellow, hard and cold,
Molten, graven, hammered and roll?d ;
Heavy to get, and light to hold,
Gold ! gold ! gold ! gold ! ?
Such masses of the precious metal
used to be found within a few feet of
the surface, that a single stroke of
the pick-axe would often transform a
penniless adventurer into a man of for-
tune ; and the sober narratives of some
of these extraordinary finds read like
the inventions of a romancer. There
was naturally a good deal of reckless
dissipation in those days, and sovereigns
were as little thought of then as shil-
lings are now. Mechanics could earn
five-and-twenty shillings a day, and
the fortunate possessor of three or
four three-roomed cottages could cal-
culate upon drawing a rental of a
thousand per annum from them. Pub-
licans were coining money, and shop-
keepers, when they allowed you to
purchase their commodities at an
advance of 500 per cent upon the
prime cost, did it with all the
air of conferring a personal favour.
Servants there were none to be had ;
and Bridget, who had once blacked
your stove and brushed your boots,


might be seen arrayed in a gorgeous
satin dress, and lolling in a hired
carriage, as the bride of a lucky digger,
who had come down from Ballarat
or Castlemaine to find a wife, and to
squander some of his hoard of gold in
treating all comers to champagne, at a
pound a bottle, in the Criterion Hotel.
Society was turned completely topsy-
turvy, and the only wonder is, in
looking back upon those days, that
it was not utterly disorganised, and
that the machinery of government,
both political and municipal, did not
come to a standstill.
Fortunately for the colony, many
of its early settlers were educated
gentlemen, and among those who took
a prominent part in the administation
of its public affairs were the Bight
Hon. H. C. E. Childers, Col. Pasley,
Sir Andrew Clarke, Sir William
Stawell, the present Chief Justice of
Victoria and Chancellor of the Mel-
bourne University; and the late Sir
Bedmond Barry, one of the Judges of
the Supreme Court. To the energy
and foresight of the first and last of
these Victoria owes the institution of
its University, and to Sir Bedmond
Barry, more particularly, the founda-
tion of its admirable Public Library.
The latter dates back to the year
1853 ;to a period, that is to say, of
the wildest excitement, when the auri
sacra fames appeared to be insatiable ;
when art, literature, and science, were
held in the greatest contempt by the
eager adventurers who were pouring
into Victoria from all parts of the
world ; and when, in the estimation
of men whose thoughts were engrossed
by money-making, there must have
seemed something perfectly quixotic
in the proposition to spend some
thousands of pounds in the commence-
ment of a public library, planned on a
scale of palatial grandeur, and calcu-
lated to cost upwards of a million of
money before it was completed. Its
founder thought otherwise, and pos-
terity will gratefully acknowledge his
wise and beneficent provision, and the
unremitting care and affection with
which he watched over the birth and
growth of his public-spirited project.
Sir ?then Mr.?Bedmond Barry was a
young Irish barrister of good family,
who had emigrated to Australia when
the settlement of Port Phillip was in
its infancy. He seems to have foreseen
its future importance, and took up his
abode in the rudimentary township of
Melbourne, in preference to establish-
ing himself in the more attractive city
of Sydney. In course of time he was
appointed one of the judges of the
Supreme Court of the colony of ATic-
toria, and having an ardent affection
for literature, music, and the fine
arts, he devoted himself to the pro-
motion of their study and practice
with characteristic energy and per-
tinacity. In the first instance, the
local legislature voted 10,000?. for the
erection of a suitable building to serve
as a Public Library on a block of land
nearly two acres in extent, and sur-
rounded by four streets, in a central
position; 3,000?. being at the same
time appropriated for the purchase of
books. Five trustees were appointed,
with Mr, Justice Barry as their chair-
man. The building was opened by the
acting governor of Victoria on the
11th of February, 1856. A further
sum of 20,000 1, was voted by the
legislature, in addition to a liberal
grant for books \ and an additional
reading-room was opened by Sir Henry
Barkly on the 24th of May, 1859.
In the leading columns of the Argus
the institution of a National Gallery
of Art was warmly and perseveringly
advocated by Mr. James Smith, one
of the political writers and the art-
critic of that journal ; and a sum of
money having been appropriated by
the legislature for that purpose, a
Museum of Art and School of Design
were established in connection wfith
the Public Library, and a Techno-
logical Museum was subsequently in-
corporated with it. We need not
trace the gradual expansion of these
excellent institutions during the last
twenty years. Suffice it to say, that
at the present time the library con-


tains 111,644 volumes, including
pamphlets ; that there were 261,886
readers during the year 1880; that
the number of visitors to the galleries
and museums during the same period
was 96,247 ; that there are about 120
oil-paintings and water-colour draw-
ings in the National Gallery; thirty
statues and busts of marble, and 190
casts of busts and statues in the
Museum of Art; and that the number
of students in the various schools
was :
Design?46 male and 67 female.
Painting?s male and 33 female.
Engineering?36 male.
Chemistry, Metallurgy, and Mineralogy?43
male.
Thus it will be seen that the Mel-
bourne Public Library fulfils, to some
extent, the purposes of a popular
university; while the advantages it
offers are open to all comers, without
any restriction, as regards the library
itself, and with only a few necessary
formalities, as regards the other de-
partments grouped under the same
roof.
Its administration is conducted by
a Board of Trustees, twenty-one in
number, including the Chief Justice,
the Chancellor of the University,-
eminent politicians, university pro-
fessors, and men of letters, as well as
representatives of banking and com-
merce ; and there are sub-committees
to which are entrusted the manage-
ment of the various sections. Their
offices are purely honorary. A secre-
tary, a librarian and staff of assistants,
a curator of the technological museum,
a teacher of painting, and a teacher
of drawing, with the necessary attend-
ants, compose the staff of the institu-
tion. The library is open from 10 a.m.
to 10 p.m., Sundays excepted; but
there is a growing feeling in the com-
munity that it should be open on that
day also, with a change of assistants,
as the experience of other cities, both
in Australia and in Europe and
America, is considered to confirm
the desirability of such a step, more
especially in a place like Melbourne,
where so many young people are liv-
ing in lodgings, and stand in need of
some place of resort in which they
can pass a few hours on a Sunday
without detriment to their health or
morals. The Museums and National
Gallery are open to the public from
noon until dusk throughout the year ;
but they also are closed on Sunday,
which is the only day in the week
upon which numbers of persons pos-
sess the requisite leisure to visit them,
and there is a very general desire
that this restriction also should be
removed.
Internally the library consists of a
reading room 240 feet long, 50 feet
wide, and 30 feet high, with tables
and chairs ranged along its whole
length for the convenience of readers.
On each side are ten bays, each of
which is also furnished with a table
and chairs. There is likewise a room
set apart for ladies frequenting the
institution. A gallery, accessible by
two flights of stairs, runs round the
whole building, and is filled with
books of reference and works not
likely to be in popular demand. This
also is open to the public. The books
are everywhere classified according to
their subjects, each bay, as a general
rule, containing those which are com-
prehended in one particular depart-
ment of literature. On the basement
story of the building is a spacious
apartment devoted to newspaper
readers, containing complete files of
the various Australian journals.
As we have said, no restriction
whatever is placed upon the frequenters
of the library, excepting that they
are expected to manipulate the books
with clean hands, and to return them
to their places when done with. The
use of ink is forbidden in taking ex-
tracts, as it might lead to the injury of
the works copied from, and none are
allowed to be taken out of the building.
In all other respects the student or the
desultory reader is as free as he would
be in his own library, if he should
happen to have one, and for the time
being he is ?monarch of all he sur-


veys.? He may consult a hundred
different works in as many minutes,
if he thinks proper, or he may con-
centrate all his attention on one.
There are sectional catalogues to
assist him in his researches, and
obliging attendants to answer his
inquiries. He can be as studious or
as discursive as he pleases, and it lies
within his power to range over the
entire field of literature, both ancient
and modern.
This unlimited freedom, it is only
right to add, has been very little
abused. An exceedingly small num-
ber of books have been stolen, and a
few have been mutilated by the
excision of plates or of leaves. The
place is frequented by a moderate per-
centage of greasy loafers and dis-
reputable faineants; but the evils
incidental to such a promiscous gather-
ing, in a city like Melbourne, are
insignificant by comparison with the
advantages which the institution con-
fers upon those who are qualified to
benefit by it, and who resort to it for
instruction or recreation. In the
evenings, more especially during the
winter season, the place may be de-
scribed as crowded. The most perfect
silence and good order are maintained.
No sound is heard but the rustling of
leaves or the muffled foot-fall of a
reader going to replace a volume on
the shelf, or taking his departure for
the night. The frequenters include
persons of all ages, from the stripling
of fifteen to the white-haired veteran,
who complains that the type is so
much smaller and so much less dis-
tinct than it was when he was a
young man. The classes of society
most numerously represented are the
operative and the lower-middle class,
with a fair sprinkling of the declasses.
As to the books most in demand,
works of fiction, biography, history,
and voyages and travels seem to
command the preference, but those
of a higher character obtain a rea-
sonable share of attention. Sport-
ing literature appears to be intensely
popular, and some books of this kind
?histories of the turf, for example?
are saturated and malodorous with
the porous exudations of moist-fingered
readers. These have also suffered by
the predatory fingers of petty larce-
nists, who have torn out plates of
famous race-horses ; but, on the whole,
as was remarked just now, these mis-
chievous depredations have been few
in number, and the great majority of
those who habitually resort to the
Melbourne Public Library feel that
they possess a proprietary interest in
the institution, and that they are
under an obligation to protect its
contents from spoliation or injury
accordingly.
There are few countries, in fact,
where so much is done by the State for
the wage-earning classes of the com-
munity, as in Victoria. The State
undertakes the gratuitous education of
their children ; it reserves large areas
of valuable land in and around every
centre of population, for recreative
purposes ; its land legislation is framed
so as to offer every facility to small
settlers ; and its fiscal system has been
adopted with a special view to secure
to local industry a monopoly of the
local market; although that system,
being in direct opposition to every
sound princple of political economy,
has failed to do so, and has really pro-
moted the prosperity of the neigh-
bouring colony of New South Wales,
which has wisely adhered to free
trade. Furthermore the State, in
Victoria, subsidises hospitals in which
people can obtain the best medical
treatment, medicine, and maintenance
without cost; and it has discontinued
applying any portion of the revenue
accruing from the sale of the public
domain, to the assistance of immigra-
tion, because the operative classes?
who, being numerically stronger than
all the rest put together, control the
elections ?imagine that every new
comer is a competitor to be feared,
instead of a co-operator to be welcomed.
Lastly, the State spends about 16,000�.
per annum on the Melbourne Public

Technological Museums ; while it also
subsidises every free Public Library,
Mechanics? Institute, or Athenaeum,
throughout the colony; and there is
scarcely a township of any importance
that cannot boast of an institution of
this kind, supplied with a good collec-
tion of books, newspapers, periodicals,
maps, &c.
And this suggests the mention of an
excellent feature of the library under
notice: we allude to its lending
department. Any free library or
cognate institution in the country
districts, as well as in the suburbs of
Melbourne, can obtain, for a period of
three months, the loan of from 200 to
400 volumes ?duplicates of those in
the Public Library ; and, on the return
of these, a fresh collection is sent out
to replace it. The cases are so con-
structed as to serve the purpose of
temporary book-shelves in the place to
which they are consigned ; and as this
regulation is eagerly taken advantage
of, a stream of good literature is
constantly circulating through the
colony ; and the cost to the institu-
tions thus benefited is only that of the
carriage of the books themselves. At
the present time, there are upwards of
6,000 volumes in circulation in this
way.
Of the contents of the Public
Library, it would be impossible to
speak at any length without exceeding
the due limits of a paper of this kind.
It contains few rare editions, and still
fewer literary curiosities. Utility has
been the object principally aimed at;
and what have been chiefly studied are
the requirements of a practical and
energetic community, containing an
abundance of readers and very few
bibliomaniacs. History, biography,
the applied sciences, poetry and the
drama, voyages and travels, theology
and serial literature, make up no small
part of the collection, which has been
enriched by many donations from
European sovereigns, and from the
various learned societies of Europe
and America. Her Majesty the Queen,
the late Emperor of the French, the
Emperor of Germany, the King of the
Belgians, the King of Italy, and the
King of the Netherlands ; the Govern-
ments of the United States, of the
Argentine Republic, of the Hawaiian
Islands, of Spain, and of the Swiss
Confederation, figure in the list of
donors. So do the Governors of most
of the British dependencies ; the Par-
liament of Great Britain, and many of
the chief public men and institutions
in the mother country ; and literary
and scientific associations in all parts
of the world. A summary of the
donations thus received, gives the
following totals :
Volumes. Pamphlets.
British Government and
Total ... 22,996 13,483
The bequest was made by the late
Count Castelnau, the naturalist, who
was consul - general for France in
Victoria, and died there.
The alphabetical catalogue of the
Melbourne Public Library fills two
substantial quarto volumes of upwards
of 1,000 pages each, and is to be
followed, in due time, by a classified
catalogue; for which an admirable
model is presented by that of the
Parliament Library of Victoria, com-
piled in 1865, This also, it may be
remarked, in passing, contains a very
fine collection of works in every de-
partment of literature, about 50,000 in
number ; as it had the good fortune to
be, for five years, under the manage-
ment of an enthusiastic man of letters,
with a wide knowledge of general
literature, who was enabled, by the
liberality of the local legislature, to
enrich many departments of it with
books drawn from all parts of Europe.
With respect to the Public Library
of Victoria, what is wanted to secure
its efficiency, and to perfect its admin-


istration, is such an endowment as
would render it independent of the
Victorian Parliament, as regards the
salaries of its officers. A gift or
bequest of 20,000�. or 30,00(F. for
this purpose, from an absentee colo-
nist, would confer upon the institution
a very great boon. Its trustees are a
corporate body, but they have no estate;
and the Government for the time being
claims to exercise the official patronage.
Now this is liable to serious abuses ;
because it is apt to be administered
upon political grounds exclusively, and
without regard to the fitness of the
persons appointed to the vacant posts.
A glaring instance of this kind oc-
curred about three years ago, when a
comparatively illiterate person was ap-
pointed to the important and respon-
sible post of Parliamentary librarian.
The appointment was condemned as
scandalous by the press of the colony,
and when a change of Ministry
occurred, the obnoxious appointee
was dismissed, to be subsequently re-
instated in defiance of public opinion.
A precisely similar incident might
occur in connection with the Mel-
bourne Public Library; and, if it
were to happen, it would be both a
calamity and a disgrace. But if the
salaries of the various officials con-
nected with it were derived from the
interest of an invested endowment
fund, the trustees could then claim the
exercise of the necessary patronage,
and would be guided, in so doing, by
considerations of the interest, welfare,
dignity, and utility of the institution
entrusted to their control; an institu-
tion of the highest value and import-
ance to the mental culture of the great
mass of the people of Victoria, and a
lasting monument to the public spirit,
the foresight, and the enlightened
patriotism of the late Sir Bedmond
Barry.
