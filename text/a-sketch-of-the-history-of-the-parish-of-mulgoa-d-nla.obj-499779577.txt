OF THE HISTORY OF THE
Parish of Mulgoa
DIOCESE OF SYDNEY N.S.W

Reverend W. R. BOWERS
(RECTOR OF THE PARISH)


THE FACTS CONCERNING THE RENOVATION.
OF ST. JANES' CHURCH.
I
*
♦ %
t
First, to give continuity to the Record, let me recount,
briefly, the accepted history of the Building,
. .
In 1814, the year of Waterloo, Governor Macquarie Invited
the public to subscribe towards the erection of a new Court-House
on the site on which St. James 1 now stands.
• •
* %
On October 17, 1819 the Foundation Stone of the ccurt House
was laid, but on the suggestion of Commissioner Blgge, Macquarie
agreed that the building should be erected as a church. The
date on the Memorial Stone is 1820.
On the sth January, 1822, although the Church was unfinished,
the first service was held.
On the 11th February, 1826 the Church was consecrated by the
senior chaplain, the Rev. Samuel Marsuen.
♦ •
%
t
In 1834 the Eastern Porticos, vestry and Gallery were added
r to the Church.
' '
1
On the evening of May 50th, 1836 the first clergyman in
charge, the Rev. Richard Hill died suddenly* in the vestry.
In 1846 the Galleries were enlarged, this would be the
Northern Gallery.
.After that time little, apparently, had been done to keep the
building in good order, for when, in December 1893, my firm ten-
dered to renovate the Church, the building was in a state of great
disrepair. The roof had sagged and leaked. The walls. In places,
were saturated with wet to such a aegree that the damp showed for
several years after the repairs were completed. It was found,
also, that the roots of the Moreton Bay fig trees on the South side
of the Church had travelled for a long distance under the floor of
the basement.
• ,♦ ♦
• *
The Architect was Mr. Varney Parkes, and the contract was
signed and the work begun in February of 1894. - There were two
special conditions:-
4
*
*
1. That the weather was to be kept out of the building.
2. That Church services were to be carried on as usual.
*
• 1 .
•** ♦ ,
* *
It was, therefore, necessary to begin by erecting a platform
six feet under the ceiling over the whole area of the Church, for
the protection of the congregation, and from which the new ceiling
could be constructed.
%
4
The work consisted of extensive drainage to the foundations
and a new sewerage system:-
Taking up the floors of the Basement, concreting and laying
new floors, enlarging the window openings and building areas where
these were below the ground level.
%

.
. *
Removing defective stone and brick-work and re-facing where
necessarylan extensive Job).


Removing steps and building up the old West Entrance Door.
and erecting a new portico and entrance to the Tower.
«
Removing the much-worn stone stairs in the Towel known as the
Convict Stairs, and erecting new stairs td the Gallery.
* ‘
»
Building a chamber with*anuoriel window In the western wall
of the Tower for the bell-ringer.
«
Opening up the central portico in King Street by removing the
brick walls between the columns and paving the side enclosures with
asphalt blocks.
* *
<
The old roof principals of Hardwood were to be replaced by
new principals of Oregon timber, defective timbers removed and
the roof re-slated.
» - .

* ♦
Other work in connection with the roof embraced new dormers,
eaves and gutters and a new celling.
'i
The spire was to be stripped and re-built and covered with
new copper sheets of an ornamental design.
The entrance doors were to be of cedar with pamelled inside
screens and swing doors.
The new windows to the Church were to be glazed with lead
lights and new louvre frames were to be put in the tower.

It was not at first Intended to re-build the large King Street
Portico, but owing to defective stones and doubtful foundations,
it became necessary to take It completely down, and a white stone
from Ifarriokville, similar in colour to the old stone, was partly
used in the re-erection.
Special sandstock bricks, too, were made to the face-
work of the building. These bricks were made at Liverpool, and
were a perfect match with the original bricks in size and colour,
being similar to the bricks used in the old Liverpool Church.
The old dwarf wall and iron railing to King Street were removed
and the present wall and railing substituted, except that portion
to the eastern end which was altered at a later date.

NOTES.
%
*
The following notes, perhaps of more interest to Architects and
Builders than to the general public, may be of interest to the
members of the Society.
- *
I 4
The extreme length of the Church la 169 ft. 6, the width 52 ft.
and the walls are 5 ft. 6 thick. The Tower is about 24 ft, sq.,
but is not a perfect square, the sides varying in length. The
height is 92 ft. and the Spire 75 *t. to the top of the Cross, a
total of 165 ft. which is 4 ft. less than the entire length of the
buklding.
•*
«
The centre-line of the Churoh is the centre-line of the old
Convict Barracks, built in 191? now the Industrial Court on the
opposite side of Queen* s Square.
11 f T ■ fv w *
Th<* roof Is of low pitch, and the .tie beams 5$ ft* .long, had
sagged 9* in c ®ntre, but the walls had withstood the thrust,
and now remain as they were built, convex, irom 5 4o 4 inches on
the inside, face, a testimony to the forethought of the Architect.
Mr. Greenway.
"*sr ~UL WmM&mt


On the other hand, we found that while the face of the briok-
work showed the hand of the craftsman, the Inside of the wall was
evidently the work of the labourer, and that the Architect had to
depend more on bulk than on bond for the stability of his structure
but we must not forget that while the early xeocrds show that *
obtain number of highly skilled mechanics, even from
® time, the great bulk of the labour available was unskilled,
9
As one of the conditions of the contract was that the Church
was to be kept weather-tight it was necessary to reconstruct the
roof without taking off the covering.
At the rear of the Churchja. gantry and crane were erected and
a hole was made in the roof, large enough to admit the tie beams
and other timbers, which were prepared on the South enclosure at
that time supposed to belong to St. James 1 and on which the Bunco
Court and Judges* Chambers now stand.
The principal rafters of Oregon timber were thei? put together
inside the roof, and erected alongside principals, which
were afterwards cut.out. The roof was then straightened, the old
slates taken off and resisted in sections.
«
The old spire was at that time the haunt of hundreds of pigeons.
When dispossessed, they took flight to the cornices of the Town
Hall, the Synagogue and the Museum, where their descendants still
vex the care-takers of those buildings.
.
• •
We commenced operations by constructing a platform around
the top of the Tower, guarded by a high enclosure us a safe-guard
against possible accidents.
On examination we found that the King post of the spire was
as sound as a bell,, i
Two of the large wall plates, however, were so rotten that
the spire was 4 Inches out of perpendicular, leaning towards King
Street and the Supreme Court, This knowledge was kept quiet, as
a public outcry had arisen in the press against the vandalism of
the Church authorities in stripping off the copper covering which
in the course of years had weathered to a beautiful green colour.
Other members of the public, toe, had arrived at the hasty con-
clusion that it was intended to totally remove the spire. We had
a number of visits from interested persons, one from a Bhip f s
captain, who informed us that the conspicuous ball and cross, by
which the Church was surmounted, was a navigation mark for which
he looked out when entering the harbour and no one had a right to
interfere with a navigation mark. The Church authorities were
rather perturbed by the criticism to which they were subjected
and temporised somewhat to popular sentiment by ordering that the
new copper sheets were on no account to be artiflcally coloured
but were to be sprinkled with sea water from day to day before
being fixed, until they took on the beautiful green tinge which
the old covering had acquired from the rains of many years.
4
,
Meanwhile, we proceeded with the work, first making secure
the post be means of steel Joists resting on stone corbels built
into the tower walls and* bolted to each side of the post,
4
I
Ve then carefully extracted and replaced with new the decayed
wall plates, A new plumb point was fixed in the apex of the spire
towards which we worked, dismantling old timbers, putting in new


&nd strengthening the King post at each new floor, until we reached
the top and brought the lion rod, on which the Ball and Grose were
mounted, again Into line.
V
Naturally, our not be carried on without noise,
and one day looking downr we saw tolling up the old ladders a l
stout figure dressed in official blue. Reaching the platform on
which we stood, his face moist with unwonted exercise, he delivered
the startling message that he had instructions unless we promised
forthwith "to stop that hammering M to bring us before the C}6urt.
Before replying we pondered and the temptation was strong upon us
to send back the message that the Court was in danger, as the spire
was leaning towards it, and if it fell we could not answer for the
consequences. But, like the Qiurch-trustees ,we temporised and
promised to abate the nuslance. Later when building the Banco
Court and Judges* Chambers adjoining, we had frequent visits from
the Judges to see how the work was progressing, and I do not
recollect that they made any further objection to "the hammering. ll
« •
t ,
I have already mentioned that the sides of the tower are
unequal. There is a variation of about 4 inches; and as the
copper sheets on the equal octagonal slues of the spire make a
geometrical design it was Impossible to altogether hide this defect,
which is visible from the street, the hips of the tower roof vary-
ing in height at the point of intersection with the sides of the
spire.
I
The design of the new covering showed a new terminal, but
it was decided to bow so far to public criticism as to retain,
if possible, the original ball and cross. . x*. small platfrom to
rest on top of the ball was made in two sections anu bolted together
and on this a short laduer was placed. . We found that with the
exception of some repairs required to the foot of the cross, the
copper-work was perfectly sound.
m
The cross, which I measured, is 10 ft. high and the ball 4 ft.
in diameter.
The Government mark, the broad-arrow, was stamped on the old
copper sheets about 4 inches apart; on the iron railings of the
convicts* stairs, on some of the bricks and also on the timber of
the roof.
Lying alongside one of the tie beams was a carpenter's heavy
chisel, and in the timber a name was cut.
From the staging of the spire a good opportunity presented
itself to the photographer, and some fine views of Sydney and the
Church were taken by the Government Printer.
Although there were anxious moments there were no accidents.
One day two men were working on the outside of the spire when one
of them slipped, but recovered his balance. I overheard his mate
address hi,m in native Australian, "You fool, had you not caught
the rope you would have been in a certain place not heaven
in five minutes.**
• * %
On another uuy when one half of the spire was covered, a storm
came up with half a gale blowing, but, fortunately subsided.
V
The architectural details of the old building were retained
in the moldings of the stonework ana the finials of the iron rail-
ings. The old joinery was of Cedar, and the work good. The
Church windows were box-frames, and the elipitical ventilating
sashes were distinctive of the «ork of the period. Similar fan-
lights may still be seen in the houses of old- Sydney.


These renovations were carried out under the supervision of
the architect} Mr* Varney and the cost of the work was
£6,157. 2. 3.
,
Sometime after we had finished our contract the Bev. Carr-Smlth
arrived from England and we continued to ao repairing work in and
about the Church, the Rectory and Broughton House up to 1899.
During the next three years extensive alterations and improve-
ments were made to the interior of the Church to the plans of Ur. J.
H. Buckeridge. These Included the removal of the northern and
eastern galleries, the permanent placing of the choir, which during
the century appears to have wonder*d completely round the Church,
In its proper the building of an apse, the new Organ and
choir stalls, new parquet and tiled floors, and new pews, a new
entrance was also made to the tower anu gallery at the south-west
corner. This work was, we understand, carried out by day-labour-
r
In 1904 we tendered to finish certain portions of the work
under Mr. Bur chain Clamp, for whom we were at the time building
St. James 1 Hall.
■

We built the present pulpit and in its construction used some
of the cedar from the old circular Communion rail, the cedar columns
of which are reproduced in the pulpit.
Strong feelings were aroused in connection with the removal
of the old Communion railing. Said one old gentleman to me, point-
ing to the adjoining font, "There, X was baptized. Here, 1 was
married. Allow that Communion rail to be removed, never I"
i -
Similar objections were raised to making a chapel of the
enclosed 'Portico on the South side, which had for many years been
the Organ Chamber.
This work, including the Cedar Screen, we carried out for
Mr. Clamp, first underpinning the foundations.

We, also, removed the Oriel window from the Tower, as it was
no longer required, and in 190? we fixed the Campbell memorial
window. There are now six memorial windows. The others axe as
we left them in 1904,

We noticed, lately, that the stonework of the Pediment adjoin-
ing the Court House had been removed.

Judging from old prints the favourite view of St. James* was
from the southern or Hyde Pork side. On either hand, in line,
stand the Barracks and the Law Courts* a convenient and, perhaps,
significant conjunction which gives food for speculation.
The foreground of the picture has been altered and, we think.
Improved, but the rearing of high commercial buildings make one
fear that the beautiful skyline, in which the spire is such a ocn-
spciuous object and which has been familiar to the citizens of
Sydney,for 100 years,, may eventually disappear.

The vicinity of St. Jakes’ is historic ground, and this Church,
more than any other I know of in Australia, has acquired that
indefinable atmosphere which links the present with the past.

Introduction.
vVhen I undertook to write the history of the
Parish of Mulgoa. I did not know how difficult the
task would be. In searching for the documents
upon which I relied for the necessary informa-
tion. it was found —and it is a cause for deep re-
gret —that the oldest and most important records
could not be traced, therefore only a short and
incomplete outline of that history can be given.
*
We are glad to note that the Standing Commit-
tee of Synod contemplates collecting the old re-
cords of the churches in the Diocese, and keep-
ing them at the Registry. Thus these old and val-
uable documents will in future be carefully pre-
served.
We sincerely hope that this little book will
commend itself to the reader, and awaken in
each. love, devotion, and gratitude for the Church
of God in our midst, and stimulate zeal in Church
work.
*
Mulgoa is an aboriginal name, the meaning of
which is not known. It was then the happy hunt
ing ground of a powerful sub-tribe of the great
. •
Kamilaroi nation, which extended from about
Cape Howe, on the south, along the coast to
about Port Stephens on the north, from thence
in a westerly direction along a narrow strip on
*
the north side of the Hunter River up to Murru-
rundi, thence by the Dividing Range to the foot
of the Moonbi above Tam worth; thence to Ma-
nilla, Barraba, Cobbedah. Bingara, and down the
Gwydir and the Barwon Rivers to Walgett. From
this place by a line a little east of Barradine and
Coonabarrabran, near the sources of the Talbra-
gar Creek and the Goulburn River.
The Kamilaroi nation had sub-tribes occupying
separate portions of the tribal territory, each
claiming its own "Taurai,” or food and hunting
grounds, and “Mulgoie” was no doubt the happy
Taurai of a happy people at the time of the first
service in. 1827. as the surrounding country
abounded in game, fish, and wild fruits. Up to
the present time some of their stone tomahawks
and axes are found in a finished and unfinished
state in the district, and within the last decade
a number of them have been ploughed up at
‘•Fernhill,” Mulgoa.
Many a Kuringal ceremony (making boys into
men by knocking out the tooth, which was a most
serious and impressive one in the eyes of the
aboriginal) took place in sight of our now beau-
tiful church.
In the memory of one of the oldest inhabitants
as many as 200 aboriginals have been seen togeth-
er at “The Cottage,” the first residence of the Cox
family, in Mulgoa in the early days of the dis-
trict.
The parish is eight miles south of Penrith, and
while it is not as extensive as many others in the
diocese, is without question one of the most dif-
ficult to work. Most of the roads are bad, and
the small population is scattered far and wide.
«
It has seven centres., viz., Mulgca, Greendale.
Luddenham, Silverdale, Badgery’s Creek. Wal-
lacia, and Shancomore, with a population of about
760 souls, and the area is something like 200
square miles.
The parish is in the happy possession of four
well-preserved and carefully-cherished churches.
S. Thomas’, Mulgoa (Parish Church); S. Mark’s.
Greendale; S. James’, Luddenham; and All
Saints’, Silverdale.
It also contains five Public Schools, and till
quite recently one Provisional School.
%
Mulgoa is a favourite holiday resort, the beauty
of the surrounding scenery and the climate being
most attractive.
The principal industries are fruit-growing and
dairying.
Mulgoa was occupied at an early date by three
sons of Lieutenant Cox. an officer in one of the
earliest regiments that came to the colony —
George, Henry, and Edward. Their properties
were the models of early country residences, and
the owners themselves worthy types of the
graziers who settled in the Counties of Cumber
land and Camden.
In 1836 there were many large establishments
in the district, containing about four hundred per-
sons. besides many small farmers.
In those early days Mulgoa was an important
and wealthy parish, as is evidenced by the beau-
tiful homes and estates of former residents.


S. THOMAS’ CHURCH, MULGOA.
The foundation-stone of this historic and beau
tiful Parish Church was laid on August 22nd,
1836, by Miss Jamison, daughter of Sir John
Jamison, K.G.V., of Regentville, and the church
was consecrated by the Bishop of Australia —
Bishop Broughton—on September 13th, 1838. It
has been stated that the church was built by
convicts, but this is not correct; the work was
' 7
done by free labour, subscriptions being raised
privately, and help received from the English
Church Society. It may be of interest to know
that at a meeting, held in Sydney in 1837, Bishop
Broughton reported that the following subscrip-
tions had been collected for the erection of the
following churches (I will only mention a few of
the oldest churches):
Appin, £2OO privately raised, £25 from Eng-
lish Church Society.
Sutton Forest, £420 privately raised, £lOO
from English Church Society.
Cook’s River, £5OO privately raised, £5O from
English Church Society.
Camden, £660 privately raised, £l5O from
English Church Society.
Cobbitty, £350 privately raised, £5O from Eng-
lish Church Society.
*Mulgoa, £9OO privately raised, £lOO from
English Church Society.
*The largest sum mentioned as locally raised.
The Reverend Thomas Hassall —the first In-
cumbent of the Parish —held his first service
here on February 11th, 1827, in a barn, near “The
Cottage,” where Alderman Blaikie now resides.
On April Ist, 1827, Thomas Hassall formally took
charge of the districts of Mulgoa (or Mulgoie, as
it was then called), South Creek (now called St.
Marys), Cabramatta, Cobbitty, Narellan, Camden,
and Argyle. Through his earnest endeavours,
with the ever-ready and most liberal support of
George, Henry, and Edward Cox, the stately edi-
fice was erected.
We should be deeply grateful to those good
men who, in spite of very great difficulties, com-
menced the work for God and His Church in this
place, and who have left behind them unmistak-
able evidence of earnestness, liberality, and
piety. “Their works do follow them.”
After eleven years of hard and faithful work
Thomas Hassall resigned from this parish, five
days after the consecration of the church.
In these early days the congregations were
large. Six to eight four-in-hand drags, besides
other carriages, could be seen each Sunday morn-
ing filled with earnest and devout worshippers.
The church is a solid stone building, of excel-
lent workmanship. The interior measures 60ft.
by 30ft., and will seat 200 people, and is adorned
with a pretty square tower 50ft. high.
Originally there was a gallery at the west end
of the church, and the old-fashioned, high pews—•
in the upper part of the church —were closed in
with doors.


The Reverend T. C. Makinson —the second In-
cumbent —succeeded in colouring the glass for
the first east window, small panes of blue and
yellow, with a dove in the upper part. There
were also the Lord’s Prayer and the Ten Com-
mandments on either side of the east window,
all of which have unaccountably disappeared.
The present beautiful and much-admired east
window was given in memory of George Cox,
Esq., and represents
The incredulity and confession of S. Thomas.
Nathanael as seen by our Lord under the fig
tree.
And our Blessed Lord with the two disciples
at Emmaus.
“THE COTTAGE.”
This is the oldest residence in Mnlgoa, having been built
by Mr. William Cox for his sons, George and Henry, who after-
wards built and resided at “Wimbourne” and “Glenmore.” It
was then occupied by their brother, Edward, till he moved to
Fernhill, and it is now in the possession of his grandsons, H.
M. S. and A. B. Cox.
The eight side windows were given by Mr.
George Cox, Mr. Edward Cox. Mr. J. J. Riley, Mr.
Adams (Tasmania), E. E. Cox, junior, as thank-
offerings for peace after the Crimean War; the
Reverend George Vidal (with the initials A.C.V.),
in memory of his son; the two others were sub-
scribed for by the parishioners of Mulgoa.
The lamps, which were specially made in Eng-
land for the church, were given by different
parishioners and friends, and two by the wife of
the Rev. J. Shearman.
The first musical instrument used in the church
was a Seraphine, which stood in the gallery.
The present pipe organ, built by J. W. Walker,
London, 1865, was put together and erected by
the late Canon O’Reilly, for many years Rector of
S. Philip’s Church, Sydney. The gallery was re-
moved to allow the organ to be placed in its pre-
sent position, which seems a pity.
The bell, one of the best in the diocese, was
subscribed for by the parishioners generally. It
weighs half a ton, and cost over £l5O. The
words “Glory to God in the highest” are inscribed
upon it.
The Holy vessels, which are solid silver, were
given in memory of George and Eliza Cox by
their children in 1874.
The old, high pulpit still remains in the church.
/
but the old prayer desk has given place to a new
one, which, together with the Litany desk, cre-
dence bracket, Re. table, and alms dish were pre-
sented by the Reverend E. N. Wilton, 8.A., a
former Rector, and now Precentor of S. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney. The coloured hangings were
given by Mrs. Wilton (the Precentor’s mother).
The large old Bible and Prayer-book were given
by Mr. J. R. Gosling, nephew of the late Vener-
able Archdeacon Robert King.


Two brass Altar Vases were given by members
of the choir, and two by Mr. Berkeley.
The old and unique Font is marble, on a stone
base. The stone was cut from the quarry at
"Glenmore,” and the marble came from Carwell,
near Rylstone.
Ten acres of land was given for the church by
Edward Cox, Esq., and forty acres for the Rec-
tory by George Cox, Esq.
Surrounding the church is the cemetery. There
are several graves of the Cox family. On the
first stone we read the following inscription:
Edward Cox, Esq., of Pern Hill.
Died 18th May, 1868.
Aged 63; and
Jane Maria, Widow of the late Edward Cox, of
Fern Hill, and third daughter of Captain Brooks.
of Denham Court, near Liverpool,
Arrived in the colony 1812, and died at Penrith.
1888, aged 82 years.
“FERNHILL.”
A beautiful homestead, built for Edward Cox, Esq., in the
year 1842. and now occupied by R. B. Baynes, Esq., Mayor of
Mulgoa. Imagination can paint nothing more picturesque and
beautiful than this property, with its undulating pasture-lands
dotted with sheep, its forest, and background of mountain. The
view from its verandahs is extensive and delightfully varied.
We next come to a vault, upon which we read
the name of George Cox, of Wimbourne. Died
August 20th, 1868, aged 74; and also Eliza, his
wife, who died 20th June, 1874, aged 73. (Mrs.
George Cox was a daughter of Lieutenant Bell.)
A handsome marble cross marks the grave of
Edward King Cox, died 25th July, 1883; and also,
Milliceut Ann, his wife.
A high granite monument stands over the grave
of Margaret Wharton, the beloved wife of James
Cox, M.D., died 21st Feb., 1876.
There are also memorials to—
Allaster Grant Maclean, Surveyor-General of
N.S.W., who died on 29th September, 1862, aged
37. He was the second son of John L. Maclean,
of the 43rd Regiment, and at one time Superin-
tendent of Convicts.
Oswald Maclellan, infant son of James Cox,
M.D. Died April —, 1862.
Margaret, wife of Eli Starkie. Died September
10th, 1841.
John Lowe, an old and faithful servant of Fern
Hill. Died February —, 1845.
Peter Brown. Died 1839.
Ann Maria Anshaw. Died 1853.
Nathaniel Norton. Died 1838.
David Williamson Morris. Died 19th July, 1839.
And many others, notably Samuel Jackson, who
came to Mulgoa as tutor to Mr. Henry Cox at
Glenmore. and who for many years was Church-
warden and a faithful worker for the Church.
There is an old stone, the lettering on which is
almost illegible, with the name Bolton, 1811. II
is difficult to understand how such an old head
stone is found in the Mulgoa Churchyard. A 1
though this old cemetery possesses no very old
dates, excepting the mysterious one of 1811, it
has very historical associations.
Our little history of Mulgoa would be incom-
plete without mentioning two important events
which took place at the Parish Church. On Sep
tember 14th, 1906 (the sixty-eighth anniversary


of the consecration of the church), the late and
beloved Archbishop, Dr. William Saumarez Smith,
visited this parish for the purpose of administer-
ing the rite of Confirmation, and although it rain
ed in torrents, and the night was very dark, fifty-
five of the candidates who had been prepared for
the holy rite found their way through the dense
darkness, the soaking rain, and the bad and
muddy roads, many having to walk long and
dreary miles, and one hundred and fifty persons
attended the service. This is indeed a wonderful
record for a country parish like Mulgoa. Many
“WIMBOURNE.”
This delightful residence, surrounded by 1,800 acres, was
built about 90 years ago for G. H. Cox, Esq. Originally it was
a cottage, and over 50 years ago the top storey was added.
The late Mr. P. C. Hewitt purchased this property from G. H.
Cox. Esq., in May, 1901. There is a vineyard, about 15 acres
in extent, and wine making is still carried on there. Visitors
to the district are always interested in the deer, over 30 of
which roam the deer park of this beautiful estate.
still speak of it as an extraordinary time. We
may state that this was the Archbishop's last
visit to S. Thomas’ Church.
Passing on to the seventy-second anniversary
(September 13th, 1910), our new and beloved
Archbishop, accompanied by the Reverend Pre-
centor Wilton, 8.A., paid his first visit to this
parish, to administer the holy rite of Confirma-
tion. During the afternoon his Grace was met by
about two hundred of the parishioners, and was
presented with an illuminated address of wel
come. Never, perhaps, in the history of Mulgoa
was there such an enthusiastic gathering.
In the evening the large congregation which
filled the church listened with rapt attention to
the plain and forcible words uttered by the Pri-
mate, who took for his text. “What is that to thee,
follow thou Me.”
No on? present will ever forget that beautiful,
solemn, and soul-stiring service. We are deeply
thankful for the help and blessing received
through the Primate’s visit.
Forty candidates were confirmed.
Some reference should be made to the old and
faithful servant of the church. Verger Hahn,
whose record of nearly twenty-six years’ devoted
service deserves mention. The whole of that
time he was only absent from his duties on two
Sundays, through sickness and death in the
family. He arrived in Sydney in the year 1855,
and was a member of the first German Band that
played in Australia. In 1857 Mr. Hahn was mar-
ried at S. James’ Church, Sydney, and for 30 years
was in the employment of the Cox family. Hahn
has entered upon his 80th year, and is still hale
and hearty.


S. MARK’S CHURCH, GREENDALE.
This pretty little church and its cemetery were
consecrated by the Right Reverend William Grant
:* ,> f v •.
Broiighton, D.D., Bishop of Sydney, on November
12th, 1849.
It is a solid stone building, and much admired
by all who see it. The interior presents a hand-
some appearance, with its lofty roof and pretty
sanctuary.
On January 4th, 1903, at 3 p.m., after a very
still and oppressive day, Greendale was visited by
a cyclone of terrific force, such as was never
known in these parts before; it came from the
S. MARK’S CHURCH, GREENDALE.
west, and bifurcated in north-easterly and south-
easterly directions, each track being about a mile
wide. S. Mark’s was on the outskirts of the
former track, and received considerable damage,
the roof of the vestry being lifted, also part of
main roof, the belfry, with stone cross, was blown
down, some of the stones of which must weigh
2cwt., and practically the whole of the coping
stones were removed; added to this the vestry
door was forced in, and much damage done to con-
tents of vestry. Had the building been in the
centre of the storm’s track it must have been
totally ruined.
Last year (1910) the churchwardens undertook
to appropriately refurnish the church. The old
furniture had done good service for many years,
but it was poor, and quite out of keeping with
the building. A new altar cloth, altar desk,
brass vases, credence table, dossal curtains, pray-
er desk and lectern were purchased, and on Sun
day, July 10th, dedicated by the Reverend Pre-
centor Wilton, 8.A., in the presence of a large
congregation.
As we pass through the peaceful little church-
yard we see many graves, and there are not a few
without headstones, doubtless some of these are
the oldest in the cemetery. Among the many we
note the following:
In memory of
Thomas Shadforth,
Formerly Lieutenant-Colonel of
H.M. 57th Regiment,
who departed this life 4th August. 1862.
Aged 90 years.
And
Frances, his wife,
who died at Ravenswood, 6th October, 1850.
Aged 79 years.


Also,
Frances Marianne Maxwell,
youngest daughter of
Henry and Mary Ann Shadforth.
Died 23rd June, 1854.
12 years and 6 months.
In memory of
Henry Williams.
Died 21st February, 1899, in his 95th year.
For 50 years a tenant of the Greendale Estate.
“Rest for the weary.”
“GLENMORE.”
This charming old residence, which was built for Henry
Cox, Esq., about the year 1825, was purchased by James John
Riley, Esq., in 1855, and is now occupied by the Misses Riley.
Both house and garden, the latter a bewildering profusion of
rarity and beauty, and the old hawthorn hedge, have an air of
English quaintness that appeals to the imagination of the ar-
tistic visitor. Paddocks now occupied by cattle were once a
sea of waving wheat, which is said to have been the finest at
that time grown in the Colony.
In memory of
Benjamin Meanly. Died June 17th, 1863.
Aged 63 years.
Stone erected by the Churchwardens of
S. Mark’s Church, Greendale.
Thomas Parsons,
Died 18th February, 1864,
33 years.
Mary Ann Ford.
Died September, 1855.
Mary Ann Lee,
Died August —, 1853.
Mary Porter,
Native of Blackpool, England,
Died 1852. Aged 60 years.
Ann Waters,
Died January —, 1852. Aged 51 years.
Sacred to the memory of
Ann Elizabeth Wentworth,
who departed this life 13th March, 1851,
Aged 40 years.
And whose mortal remains were conducted to
this last earthly resting-place by a pro-
cession of 830 disconsolate neighbours.
Reader, pause and consider that by the exer-
cise of many virtues she earned this tribute to
departed worth. “Go thou and do likewise.”

who departed this life 23rd September, 1851,
Aged 40 years.
CONTRIBUTED BY J. C. MAYNE, Esq.
The Greendale Estate comprises several very
early grants, dating from 1811. Among them was
one to Ellis Bent, the Judge Advocate of that


period. It has frontage to the Nepean, wherein
is the pool called “Bent’s Basin.” In issuing
grants then, after naming the boundaries, came
“to be called for ever by the name of Moulsey,”
in this instance, and so with the other grants.
Only one Greendale grant bears a native name:
it is "Ooroolong.”
The total area is about 9000 acres. In olden
times a considerable area was cultivated, and the
many remains of tenements indicate that much
prosperity prevailed. But about 50 years ago rust
came, and the growing of wheat gradually ceased,
later also of hay. The dairying industry is now
FAI RLIGHT.
Two miles from the main road we find this very old home
built for Nathaniel Norton. Esq., situated on a magnificent emi-
nence from which is obtained a view unsurpassed in the dis-
trict, both in extent and magnitude. Date of building cannot
be ascertained.
chiefly pursued by the occupants of the Estate,
in great measure over larger areas than were
farmed of old.
The late Reverend W. B. Clark, the geologist
of last century, dwells at some length in one of
his papers upon the evidences of volcanic origin
existing at Greendale and thereabouts, pointing
out the rounded caps of many hills in support of
the statement; but not only to Greendale does
this apply, for the neighbouring properties of
Shancomore, Vermont, etc., exhibit similar forma-
tion.
The graves of many pioneers are in the two
churchyards, while across the river is another
ground which, from its condition, would seem to
have the remains of some of the first settlers.
In the Church of England ground is the tomb
of Colonel Shadforth. a Waterloo hero; that also
of an early squire, Mr. George Wentworth, a half-
brother of the statesman, William Charles Went-
worth.
Tales of “derring do” are not wanting, some
nearly tragic. A round hill, overlooking Shanco-
more, is said to have been the haunt of a des-
perado, Donohue. However, it is discounted by
other localities having a similar legend attaching
to them.
In a sequestered spot, lying under a ridge on
Shancomore, is the ruin of a “still,” used long
ago. In those days there was much very primi-
tive. May be they were a thirsty lot, and there
was lacking the refining that comes of education
and softer manners. Well does Crabbe say —
“Be to their virtues very kind!
And to their faults a little blind.”
Many incidents could be recounted bearing
upon much that was regrettable. Unfortunately
little, if any, instances of our better nature, veri-
fying the truth that
The good men do oft is buried with their bones,
The evil they commit lives after them.


S. JAMES’ CHURCH, LUDDENHAM.
The foundation-stone of this church was laid by
Mrs. E. K. Cox, on 13th July. 1870. The church
was opened for Divine worship on 25th July (S.
James’ Day), 1871, and, with the cemetery, conse-
crated by the Most Reverend Frederic Barker,
D.D., Bishop of Sydney, on 19th September, 187 S.
The following detailed account of the history of
the Church of St. James’, Luddenham, has been
culled from the minute-book so splendidly kept
by the late Reverend James Ross:
On March 16th, 1870, a meeting was held at 4
p.m. for the purpose of taking definite steps for
the erection of a church at Luddenham, and, not-
withstanding the extraordinary continual down-
pour of rain, about one hundred or more persons
S. JAMES’ CHURCH, LUDDENHAM.
met. The meeting took place on the ground set
apart by Sir Charles Nicholson for church pur-
poses. Not deterred by the rain, our lady friends
were at their posts. Punctually at the specified
hour —4 p.m.—all things were ready, the tables
laid so very tastefully in a most commodious and
remarkably suitable booth, presenting the out-
ward appearance of about 50 or 60 feet of a tun
nel. covered with tarpaulin, and affording really
comfortable shelter from the pouring rain, though
it had been intended to shelter from the sun,
which, unfortunately", had not been seen in these
parts for some considerable time. Tea was cor-
dially enjoyed, as was abundantly testified by the
pervading cheerfulness. Jokes were passed
freely, about the weather generally, and the mud
in particular. Everybody seemed in the best of
humour; not a clouded face was to be seen
amongst those present. When the tea things
were in due course removed, and all as comfort-
ably seated as the circumstances would permit.
Mr. Mayne, of Greendale House, was voted to the
chair, and presently, on a raised platform at the
far end of the booth was to be seen the chair-
man, with the Reverend J. Ross —Incumbent of
the parish —at the table with papers, etc., indi-
cating business.
After prayer by Reverend J. Ross, the same
reverend gentleman gave a detailed statement of
church affairs at Luddenham.
COPY OF THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT.
“It is not unknown to most of you that, sympa-
thising with the inconvenient distance between
the people of Luddenham and the churches of
Mulgoa and Greendale, I have, since January,
1869, held a monthly Sunday evening service in
a private house very kindly placed at our dis-
posal for the purpose. Our thanks are certainly
due to Mr. Geo. Eaton, senior, for his steadfast
sympathy in this matter, and I trust his co-opera-
tion in church matters will be no less hearty in
the time to come than it has been in times past.
The monthly service has been more than well
attended, and the average attendance fully war-
rants me in stating here what has been already
stated by many of your own number, viz., that a
separate building with adequate accommodation
has now become an absolute necessity. Seeing
the tendency of things, and observing with plea-


sure the increasing interest in these monthly
services, as testified by the ever-increasing at-
tendance, and with a view to forwarding matters,
in the month of July last I wrote to Sir Charles
Nicholson, detailing to him the circumstances of
our case, and praying him to grant a portion of
land sufficient for the building of a church. This
I did. not without having thankfully received and
duly appreciated offers of a site from several of
our own number —to wit, Messrs. R. D. Graham-
Harris, John Lawson, and Geo. Eaton, sen. My
application to Sir Charles Nicholson was in ac-
cordance with his well-known liberality to Lud-
denham, and per the return mail I received this
letter, which I now read. ... On receipt of this
THE OLD SCHOOL HOUSE.
This was the first building erected in Mulgoa (date un-
known). It was built by William Cox, Esq., for a dairy, where
butter and cheese making were carried on. The old cow bails
were there for years after it was converted into a school house.
A heap of bricks now marks the spot where stood a cottage,
facing the main road, and occupied by Dr. Black till the year
1839 or 1840, when he left, to go to Penrith.
letter I immediately communicated its contents
to the Bishop, and desired his Lordship’s further
direction. In reply I was requested thankfully to
accept Sir Charles’ handsome offer, and endeav-
our, with all convenient speed, to forward the
object in contemplation. In accordance with the
terms of Sir Charles’ letter, 17 acres of land have
been measured and marked off by Sir Charles’
agent, Mr. Jackson, who has very kindly, so far
as in his power, facilitated matters, and we are
assembled at this moment on a portion of the
grant, by the special permission of the present
tenant, Mr. Joseph Haynes, who has very cour-
teously granted us immediate possession of that
which really is 'in transitu.’ ”
Having read this statement, Reverend James
Ross strongly appealed to the people to come
forward and aid him in this endeavour to place
the public ordinances of religion literally at their
doors.
The first resolution was then moved by Mr. R.
D. Graham, who, after suitable introductory re-
marks, read as follows:
“1. That this meeting, recognising the necessity
that exists for a church at Luddenham, resolves,
to take steps for the immediate erection of such
building.”
This resolution was seconded by the Reverend
John Vaughan, who, notwithstanding the discom-
forts attending a ride from Penrith in such
weather, seemed to enjoy the meeting immensely,
and with his wonted earnestness and humour ad
dressed the people on the terms of the resolution.
The resolution was then put by the chairman,
and carried unanimously.
Mr. Thomas Magee moved the second resolu-
tion in a most substantial way by at once sub-
scribing £2O towards the building-


“2. That the following persons be requested to
form themselves into a committee for the official
management of matters connected with the pro-
posed building: —Reverend J. Ross (president and
secretary), Mr. Beardow (treasurer), Messrs. E.
R. Cox, R. D. Graham, H. S. Shadforth, J. C.
Mayne, A. Fanant, John Lawson, Thomas Magee,
R. Taylor, G. Eaton, junior, and —. West.”
Mr. Beardow, in a few pointedly appropriate re-
marks, seconded this resolution.
It was then put to the meeting, and carried
unanimously.
A canvass then took place, at the close ot
which the subscription-list showed about £9O, in-
REGENTVILLE.
This once noted mansion had many years ago a great in-
terest for Colonists. It was the residence of Sir John Jami-
son, K.G.V.—whose daughter laid the foundation stone of S.
Thomas’ Church, Mulgoa —a member of the old Legislative
Council, and one of the most distinguished men of his time in
Australia. It was situated about thirty-five miles from Sydney,
at Regentville, near Penrith.
eluding £25 promised by Sir Charles Nicholson,
which result seemed to those immediately con-
cerned very satisfactory, considering the disad
vantage under which the meeting had taken
place, the state of the weather having probably
deterred double the number from being present.
The Church Building Committee met on 28th
March, 1870, in the house of Mr. J. Lawson, at 3.30
p.m. Present: Reverend J. Ross, Messrs. Bear-
dow, E. K. Cox, H. S. Shadforth, J. Lawson, Thos.
Mayne, and Robert Taylor. After prayer by
Reverend J. Ross, E. K. Cox moved —“That the
site for the church be fixed about 20 or 30 yards
J
from the road, and on the rise immediately after
the Greendale dividing fence towards the school.”
Seconded by J. Lawson, and carried.
A plan for the building was tabled, and mainly
approved of, with a material alteration in the
position of (west) door, which it was resolved to
place at the north side of the porch, thus making
room for a convenient vestry. At the Church
Building Committee, held on April 11th, 1870, at
10 a.m., the tenders for building the church were
opened —one from Messrs. Anderson and Wagner
for £lBO, another from Michael O’Mealy for
£lBB, to complete the mason work, finding all
materials.
There being no one to testify to the compe
tency of Messrs. Anderson and Wagner as ma-
sons, E. K. Cox moved, and H. S. Shadforth se-
conded —“That the tender of Michael O’Mealy be
accepted, with this reservation —that the work be
not commenced until the amount of his tender be
actually subscribed.” Agreed. The members of
the Building Committee were requested to use
their separate efforts to collect the necessary
funds for completing the contract for mason
work, and that the following ladies be requested
to co-operate with the committee in collecting
funds: —Mesdames Beardow, Eaton, sen., Graham,


Coldwell, and the Misses Freeburn, Taylor, and
Magee.
At the Building Committee meeting held at
Mr. Lawson’s house, April 25, 1870, it was pro-
posed that a tea meeting be held when the foun-
dation-stone is laid, and that the stone be laid on
14th June, 1870.
At the next Church Building Committee meet-
ing it was decided that, on account of the un-
settled state of the weather, the date for laying
the foundation-stone be altered to 13th July. Car-
ried.
Mr. Beardow moved that battens be used on
roof instead of boards.
Mr. Shadforth moved, as an amendment—" That
the original plans of boards for roof be adhered
S. THOMAS’ RECTORY, MULGOA.
to.” The amendment was lost. Two plans of
roof were tabled; 20-feet rafters were fixed upon.
Mr. Magee took objection to some of the stones
on the church ground, which, according to the
way in which they were dressed, indicated that
they were intended for the outside, and they,
according to the grain of the stone, were not fit
for outside. The committee adjourned to the
church ground to settle the matter. The stones
were pointed out, and the contractor’s attention
called to the matter. He was duly cautioned
against what were called "soldier stones” in the
building.
At a Church Building Committee Meeting, held
August 29.1870, a letter was received from the con-
tractor in re extra work owing to the fall in the
ground on which the church is being built. At
the Building Committee meeting held 3rd Octo-
ber it was reported that the contractor —O’Mealy
—had "struck work.” The secretary Was re-
quested to write to him, stating the regret of the
committee that he had taken such an unjustifiable
course, and expressing a hope that there would
be no further delay. The secretary was also re-
quested to call O'Mealy’s attention to the neces-
sity for "binding stones” in the building 5 feet
apart.
At a Church Building Committee meeting held
on April 3rd, 1871, Reverend J. Ross tabled a
paper, signed by O’Mealy, cancelling his contract,
and unconditionally leaving the committee to
finish the building as seemed good to them. It
was then agreed that Thomas Magee should un-
dertake to see the building completed according
to plan.
At a meeting of the Church Building Com-
mittee, held on sth July, 1871, arrangements were
made for the opening of church and tea meeting
on that occasion. The date fixed for the opening
was 25th July (S. James’ Day), 1871.
On October 5, 1871, Reverend J. Ross nomi-
nated Messrs. T. Magee, C. H. Beardow, and J.
Lawson to act as managers in lieu of church-
wardens until Easter Tuesday next. These gen-
tlemen, with the Incumbent (Reverend J. Ross),
meet at S. James’, Luddenham, being the first
quarterly meeting as a separate vestry.
The first Easter meeting of Luddenham was
held on Easter Tuesday, 1872, and the following
were duly elected: —Clergyman’s warden, J. Law
son; people’s wardens, Thos. Magee, John Will
mington, with Mr. Beardow as a sidesman.
The pretty stone Font was presented by Messrs.
Gilflllan, Paterson, Birnie, and Peebles.


ALL SAINTS’ CHURCH, SILVERDALE.
Beautiful, indeed, for situation is the site of
this pretty little weatherboard church, which was
built in the year 1906, during the Rectorship of
the Reverend B. N. Wilton, 8.A., and dedicated
by the late Archbishop of Sydney —Dr. Saumarez
Smith —-on 11th September the same year. Ser-
vices in this part of the parish were first con-
ducted by the Reverend G. H. Allnutt, now Rector
of Cobbity, at Mr. Gibson’s house, and then for a
number of years at the house of Mr. W. Sales;
after which, for nineteen years, they were held
at “Havilah.” the residence of Mr. Lloyd Wil-
liams. In the year 1905 the residents of Silver-
dale, under the able leadership of their much-
esteemed Rector, determined to erect a church.
ALL SAINTS CHURCH, SILVERDALE.
Offers ot neip were soon forthcoming. Mr. W.
Sales at once offered a suitable block of land, and
Miss Williams accepted the secretaryship of the
committee which was appointed to arrange ways
and means. A number of friends likely to help
were then appealed to, and. thanks to the energy
of the Rector and others, sufficient funds were
soon in hand to commence the work. Mr. Lloyd
Williams, who firmly believed that the work un-
dertaken in God’s name must come to a success-
ful termination, generously and promptly ad-
vanced the money to pay all accounts as they
were presented. He also superintended the build-
ing of the church, and by his loyal devotion to
the cause has earned the thanks of aT church-
men, especially those resident in the locality.
Ornamental trees planted round the structure
greatly improve its appearance, and on the com-
pletion of the chancel, which is now being erect-
ed. it will be difficult to find a more picturesque
house of prayer. Moreover, it is free of debt,
and a sum of money sufficient to carry out the
improvements is actually in hand. The annual
sports in connection with the church during the
last three years have brought in £7l. A remark-
able result in a district, the population of which
only numbering 60 souls. The whole history of
All Saints’ Church is a sermon-in-brief on the
tremendous value of unity in, and loyalty to, the
work of God and His church.
Silverdale is a charmingly situated mountain
hamlet at the western extremity of the parish.
and eight miles from the Parish Church. Though
in the depths of the bush, it is only sft miles from
the metropolis, and comparatively easy of access.
The climb up the mountain —800 feet —brings its
own reward in extensive views and exhilarating
and health-giving air; and while still in close
proximity to the sea, it is on the fringe of that
vast plateau extending from the banks of the
Nepean to the edge of the great plains. The
climate is an ideal one, and for this reason the
pretty little boarding-house, “Havilah,” is an ideal
resort for the spending of the annual vacation.
The history of the district extends back to about
the year 1830, when two grants of land were
made —one to Mr. Waldron, the other to Mr.
Wentworth. Not long after, Mr. Shadforth


selected a large area, which since then has been
cut up into those small homesteads from which
the present farmers are making a living. Mr.
Blaxland erected, and for some time worked, a
flour mill on the banks of the Nepean, on what is
now the property of Mr. J. E. Baines.
WALLACIA.
This is a quiet, peaceful, pretty little spot, on
the banks of the Nepean River, three miles from
Mulgoa. For many years it was called Wallace,
This historic building was erected in year 1855, and was
first occupied by a Mr. Graham. It afterwards became the first
Post Office in Mulgoa. Formerly all mails were left at the
Rectory for people to sort out their own letters, etc. The Cot-
tage is now occupied by Mr. E. J. Turnbull, Town Clerk, who has
resided here for the past 25 years.
but the authorities decided that the name must be
altered, as there was another place of the same
name in the colony of longer standing. After
considerable discussion among the residents it
was suggested that the new name be Wallacia,
and this was finally approved of by those in
authority. The whole estate, comprising about
2000 acres, belonged to the late Sir Charles
Nicholson, and for a time was rented by Mr.
Robert Wallace and his brother for grazing.
Robert, after whom it was called, resided
where the present Wallacia Post-office now
stands; the cottage was the only dwelling
between the river and Bringelly-road. Nearly
the whole way was thick bush, and there was
only the mail track between Mulgoa and Ludden-
ham. The mail was carried on horseback. Mr.
William Leggo, an old Crimean veteran, who re-
calls personal acquaintance with the late Miss
Florence Nightingale of sixty years ago, is one of
the oldest residents. He arrived in the neigh-
bourhood in the year 1883, and not only built the
house in which he now resides, but made the
bricks himself on his own property. The long
row of stately pine trees along the roadside were
planted by Mr. Leggo, and which he grew from
seed.
The first mail coach from Wallacia to Penrith
was run by Mr. Leggo, who was also instrumental
in getting the Post-office for Wallacia.
For many years regular church services were
held at “The Pines,” Mr. Leggo’s residence; but
now the services are held at “Murroobah,” the
residence of Mr. Kirchen.
Wallacia is becoming a favourable resort for
tourists. The weir at present being constructed
will greatly improve the river, and will add to
the attraction of the place; and when the pro-
posed Warragamba irrigation scheme is accom
plished Wallacia will be the centre of a large and
settled population, while retaining and increas-
ing its popularity as a health and pleasure resort.
We sincerely hope it will be possible to secure
a site for a church at an early date, and thereby
make the necessary provision for the future.


BADGERY’S CREEK.
Regular church services are held in this part
of the parish in a hall erected by the residents of
Badgery’s Creek, and it is hoped that the work of
building a church will soon be inaugurated. Mr.
C. J. Swann has kindly given an allotment of
ground (half an acre), which is fenced, and
planted with ornamental trees. The sum of £4O
has been locally raised towards the building.
Sunday-school is held at Mr. Swann’s residence
every Sunday afternoon, and a Girls’ Guild meets
every Saturday afternoon at the same place. The
people take a keen interest in the church ser-
vices, and the attendance is very good.
Badgery’s Creek is principally composed of
small holdings, on what was originally the Sir
Charles Nicholson and Roberts’ estates.
IVY COTTAGE—MULGOA ROAD.
This building was formerly the blacksmith’s shop on the
Glenmore Estate, the marks on the door where the nails were
straightened being still distinctly visible.
It was subsequently occupied as a dwelling by the late .
Jackson, whose widow and daughter still reside there.
