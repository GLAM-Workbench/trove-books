PREFACE.
snettwetaiwtw
fN taking up my pen to introduce the Second
Canto of my poem to the public, I feel more
diffidence than I experienced in commencing the Canto
itself.
I received some rough handling from the public and
the press?especially the former?in connection with my
Preface to the last Canto; but, while I was rather freely
condemned for the boldness of my utterance, I have the
gratification of knowing that the justice of my strictures
on the public taste was, almost universally, recognised
to be just. However unwise and gratuitous, it cannot
now be recalled, nor do I wish to apologise for one
single assertion in the Preface to the first Canto.
Of the reception the poem itself met I have no
occasion to complain. Indeed, on the contrary, the
flattering comments that reached me through private
sources, as well as the generous recognition my humble
effort elicited from the press, were of so encouraging a


nature that I resolved, whether wisely or otherwise a
few months will determine, to persevere in my intention
of continuing the tale.
I would, indeed, be a traitor to every instinct of grati-
tude did I not fully acknowledge the obligations I am
under to the press; for, from not less than twenty
colonial newspapers in the most important centres of
population, I received not only words of kind com-
mendation, but of generous encouragement. In only
one solitary case in Victoria was the poem dismissed
with a few commonplace and hackneyed observations
of that stereotyped kind that might be supposed to
emanate from a critic who had never read a half-dozen
lines of the Canto ! In a few instances the reviewers
remarked, while otherwise admiring the easy flow, and
rhythm, that the first Canto possessed more monotony of
metre than the poetic tales of Sir Walter Scott?that, in
short, I should have adhered more closely to the ? great
master? whose immortal efforts I endeavoured, so
ineffectively, to make my model. There can be no one
who has carefully studied Scott that must not see that
he has written Stanzas ?ay, almost whole Cantos ?in
some of his grandest poems, with barely a vestige of
change in the measure; but, then, he has invested his
tales with such absorbing interest to the lover of
romance that the monotony of the metre was forgotten
in the grandeur of the execution. To an attribute like
this I am not so impudently vain as to aspire ; but I
have, however, endeavoured to obviate that objection in
this Canto, and my efforts in this direction will appear
more pronounced as the tale progresses towards com-
pletion.


PREFACE
If I might be permitted to cite one other instance,
even at the risk of being subjected to the unjust animad-
version of instituting a presumptuous comparison, I
would remind the reader that Byron?s Giaour, Lara,
Mazeppa, and some of his other minor poems, are equally
open to the same objection. And still no critic in any
European land ever took him to task in connection with
this. Why, therefore, not an equal generosity on our
side of the equator, especially when the exercise of it
tends to promote a something that no intellectual lover
of our young country should wish to see crushed in the
primitive stages of its existence ?a poetic romance of
our early days ?
I have paved the way in my first Canto for the kindly
interest of more than six hundred readers, and if this
second instalment of my tale realise my anticipations, I
have some slight hopes remaining that the few hundred
copies as yet unsold will not remain a permanent encum-
brance on the shelves of the Publisher.
In soliciting the generous consideration of my critics,
I must advance a fact that ought not to be divested of
the importance it should merit. The ancient associa-
tions, the happy nomenclature, the romantic surround-
ings, and the historic reminiscences with which an old-
world romance may be invested are impossible cf
attainment in a new land like our Australia, save only
such as exist in our aboriginal traditions, or in tie
imaginative creation of an ideal dreamer. If I cannot?
not being a native Australian ?lay claim to sufficient
originality in describing the natural features of our
colonial scenery, let me hope, at least, that I may not le


refused that meed of justice which might be ungrudgingly
accorded to one who loves the land of his adoption with
a sincerity that must conduce to inspire a generous love
of simple truth, when treating, even in romance, of a
land as beautiful in its favoured features as it is unique
in its peerless progress and illimitable resources.

Cfrc Slaift of Utilkfoa:
AN AUSTRALIAN POEM.
CANTO 11.
HEN life is young, and bright, and fair
Unshadowed o?er by coming care,
How little in the battle?s strife
Does early manhood cling to life!
Nor death?s embraces do we fear,
Nor prize we high what life holds dear :
In dreamy youth?s romantic mind
This world we?d freely leave behind;
The realms unknown we?d fain explore
Of that mysterious, dreaded shore,
Where youthful fancy loves to stray
In boyhood?s young, untroubled day.


When stormy winds assail onr bark,
The waves are high, the night is dark,
The billows round us raging roll
To wreck the dark, tempestuous soul;
When life is but a hostile strand?
A sad, insipid, hollow land,
A strange, unfathomable mine?
Ambition?s tomb and sorrow's shrine,
Then fickle nature wildly clings
To ev?ry change that fortune brings,
Would fain postpone the dreaded day,
When death maintains his ruthless sway
His dark dominion drear;
And cling the closer still to life,
And struggle fiercer in the strife,
Thro? ev?ry passing year.
When waning life can nought bestow
But sad regret and bitter woe,
The memory of folly?s ways?
Sad retrospect of other days !
The hollow friendship, false and frail,
That fancy deemed could never fail;
The hopes that early manhood gave,
Forgotten, withered in their grave;
The love that lighted up our way,
But flickered only for a day;
For memories like these we live
When life has little else to give,
And cling, unconscious, to the pain




Earth?s freely freighted store
Where life is but a fleeting dream,
The reflex dark of Lethe?s stream,
On Pluto?s fabled shore.
Ah ! why, frail nature, at the last,
Thy Upas spell around us cast ?
Or why, fond nature, vainly strive
To keep the vital spark alive P
For reason tells ?twere better far
To cease to wage unequal war;
Submissive yield us to the doom
That wraps mortality in gloom,
That frees the spirit from its thrall,
Obedient to the final call,
Inevitable, dread !
And leaves the tenement of clay
To moulder painlessly away,
To slumber with the dead.
Then, nature frail, why struggle on,
When all the joys of life are goneP
The buried love, the friendship fled,
The bloom of early manhood dead;
While aspirations, bright and fair,
In sable chaos also share
That wreck of universal gloom
Which points unerring to the tomb?
That only resting place to find
Eelease from sorrow-burden?d mind;
Where fickle fortune lures no more,


And all our pangs at last are o?er
Within this world of weeping woe,
This pilgrimage of man below,
Where sorrow?s tears for ever flow.
Upon his couch the stranger lay,
And slumbered thro? the waning day;
The friendly watchers by his side
Beheld the flowing, ebbing tide;
For now a constitution strong
Gave battle to the tyrant long.
Anon, the foe appeared to clasp
The struggling victim in his grasp,
So that for long ?twas hard to tell
Who?d conquer in that struggle fell.
At length the weak, impeded tide
In gentle flow began to glide,
Then gathered strength amain,
And tinged his pallid cheek anew
With slightest shade of healthy hue?
The semblance of a stain!
When soothing sleep had been obtained,
A respite from the foe was gained ;
And feeling then in better vein
The story was resumed again,
But in a soft and lower strain ;
Nor ceased until the evening shades
Had darkly draped the forest glades,


And o?er the valley threw,
Slow stealing, softly all around,
Upon the solitude profound
A gloomy, sombre hue.
? That night I lay me down to rest,
Wild thoughts upon me heavy prest;
The flitting fancies of my brain
Evoked a strange, but pleasant pain;
My heart went out with one wild bound
To her my soul responsive found,
And all my youth had passed away
That stilly eve of summer day;
The lightness of the heart was fled,
That days of sunny boyhood shed ;
Love?s dreamy pictures round me stole,
Bright aspirations of the soul,
To win so fair a bride,
Who, fostered in the forest lone,
To peerless womanhood had grown
In lowly, modest pride.
? I slept not thro? the weary night?
At faintest dawn of beaming light
I wandered forth the creek beside,
And dreamy, watched its waters glide ;
And wondered would my life be so,
A calm, unruffled, placid flow;
Or would its stream impeded be
Like yonder eddy, where the tree


Resistance gave the tide,
And stemmed the current?s quiet flow,
And chafed the waters far below
That rolled in angry pride.
? While musing thus beside the stream,
In love?s delightful, dawning dream,
Fair Maggie?s form appeared in view,
As, tripping o?er the morning dew,
Her steps approached me where I lay,
Beside the streamlet?s rippling play.
There seated, thoughtful, by my side
She gazed upon the mimic tide,
While I, in confidence grown bold,
In sad and lowly accents told
My simple tale of days gone by,
That dimmed her bright and gentle eye;
But when I told her that I came
To this bright land to carve a name,
And live within that forest wild,
With artless innocence she smiled,
And lighted up her dark brown eye
With soft and dreamy ecstasy.
? I knew not how the moments fled?
All Nature?s beauties, cold and dead,
Unnoticed and forgotten lay?
The landscape stretching far away,
The beauty of the savage dell,
Upon my vision fading fell;


The early songsters of the grove
Unheeded sang their songs of love;
For, ah ! what picture could compare
With that fair maiden seated there !
What music of the brilliant throng,
With plumage gay and varied song,
Could thrill with such sensation dear
As Maggie?s tones upon mine ear !
While, with her hand within mine own,
She told me of a life so lone
Within that forest wild ;
Of how her early days had flown
Ere she to womanhood had grown,
A wayward, petted child !
?And, now, in accents sadder grown,
In sorrow?s quiet, chastened tone,
She told me how her father?s pride
Would make of her a stranger?s bride?
Of how her soul was filled with dread
At some wild words that he had said
About disgrace upon his name,
Dishonour never linked with shame ;
And that thro? her he hoped to save
That name from crime?s unholy grave.
She shuddered as the words she said,
And, sobbing, slowly bent her head
In sorrow deep upon her breast,
Like spirit pining for its rest
From earthly toils, from worldly care,
And sadly wept in silence there,
With all the seeming of despair.




? She scarcely knew what love was now;
Its beam incipient o?er her brow
A moment shone reflected there,
Before her heart was yet aware;
She knew not then the struggle?s pain,
The sleepless night, the fever?d brain,
The burning heart, the throbbing brow,
The anguish of the broken vow,
The wild remorse, the living death
That clings unto the latest breath;
The deep regret that ever moves
The heart of one that truly loves.
And then the woe when lovers part,
The yearning of the lonely heart,
The longing for the days gone by,
Of soul to soul?s responsive sigh;
Nor did she know the power that dwells
In dreamy love?s bewitching spells,
Its wild, resistless sway;
Ah! if she had, she would have known
Before it high resolves have flown
Since Eden?s fatal day.
XVII.
?The morn advanced, we rose to go,
And homeward bent our footsteps slow ;
Nor once again did either name
A subject fraught with so much pain ;
And while we walked beneath the shade
That gnarled box and gum-tree made,
She drew a picture bright for me
Of what a squatter?s life would be,


And said she?d be my guide
Thro? wooded dell and forest deep,
O?er craggy range and mountain steep,
O?er all the station wide,
?Till I familiar should become
With their extensive cattle-run?
Could yard the horses, mark the brands,
And know her father?s station hands,
Safe wander home at close of day
Thro? devious scrub and winding way;
And then another picture drew
Of pleasures ever sweet and new,
That while away the ev?ning long
With melody and joyous song.
I fondly worshipped at the shrine
Her fancy painted free,
And only hoped such life were mine,
Such dream of ecstasy !
XYIII.
?We soon beheld, approaching near,
Her father?s stately form appear;
His kindly eye upon me bent,
A welcome ease unconscious lent?
For some instinctive prompting strong
In secret whispered me of wrong.
He greeted me with friendly smile,
And held my hand in his the while,
And welcome gave me o?er and o?er
To young Victoria?s golden shore ;
Then sought my pardon for the way
He sudden left me yesterday.


And while he gently pressed my hand,
He fain would make me understand,
Australia?s changeful summer day
Was not more fitful in its way
Than was his mood, when mem?ry traced
Its passage o?er life?s arid waste :
Ah! few their thoughts can backward cast
With pleasure only on the past.
??He took my arm, we walked along,
The fallen trunks and boughs among,
That round in thick disorder lay?
The victims dead of deep decay,
For many a long forgotten day ?
For ages strewn by Nature?s toil
Upon the rich and virgin soil.
Here Fire its fell destruction shows,
Where round the blackened trunk it rose,
Or up the body swept its way,
Thro? wasting age a willing prey;
There Time?s unaided, potent hand
Has felled the forest monarch grand,
That long withstood the stormy blast,
The tempest wild for ages past,
Among its branches high ;
The Lightning?s victim lay beside,
That once arose in rival pride,
In years and years gone by.




So that I scarce could understand
I stood not still on Britain?s land ;
For cultured taste implanted there,
Thro? woman?s nice, artistic care,
A truly smiling English air.
XXII.
? And now arose a tinkling swell
Upon the air?the breakfast bell
Came ringing o?er the garden ground,
With swelling cadence in its sound.
Its tinkling tones proclaimed a change,
That seemed to me abnormal, strange:
?Tvvas seven o?clock? -a novel time
To fashion?s hour in Britain?s clime.
The early walk, the bracing air,
The breezy hills around me there,
Conspired to make the signal clear
A welcome music to mine ear ;
For in those days no laggard I
Responsive to that call to fly.
?Tis part of Nature?s fickle plan,
Her ways mysterious to man,
When life declining, later on,
Its impress leaves our strength upon,
Ami bends or breaks the giant frame,
We miss the wish to feed the flame
That flickers weak and low,
That waning strength requires more
The nearer we approach the shore
Of Nature?s dreaded foe.


XXIII.
? Through long, long years I ne?er forgot,
In all my sad and chequered lot,
That first repast by Maggie?s side,
In beauty?s young, unconscious pride;
The staid, unstudied, native ease,
The unobtrusive wish to please,
The simple acts of maiden grace
With which she filled a matron?s place,
And tended to her agkd sire,
Anticipating each desire,
Had all my admiration won
Before the meal was well begun
On that auspicious morn.
And, oh ! the beauty of her face
In Nature?s rare and chiselled grace,
A goddess might adorn.
XXIY.
? The morn advanced ?he led the way
To where in sleepy shadow lay
The library. Here fronting grow,
And drape the windows deep and low,
Two willows weeping by the side,
In fond embrace by creepers tied;
And thro? the casement odours sprung
That perfume on the senses flung,
Inhaled in dreamy softness there
From ev?ry gentle breath of air,
From ev?ry breezy wind,
That over beds of roses blew,
And from their fragrance essence drew
Of ev?ry balmy kind.


xxy.
? I gazed in admiration round
On ancient tome and volume bound;
And much I wondered to behold,
From stories that I heard of old,
Such marvel in this land of gold ;
For I believed, induced by fame
That widely travelled o?er the main,
That life?s refined joys were sold
And sacrificed for love of gold;
That love of letters was unknown,
The seeds of literature unsown,
Unfostered in the land;
Yet here, within the forest wild,
Her unassuming parent smiled
With no unstinted hand.
XXVI.
? My musings thus no longer ran,
For, seated both, he thus began :
?My friend, the son of Hubert proud.
Before whose lion will have bowed
Tne highest magnates of the land
Where Hilton?s ancient towers stand,
I fear me much my humble home?
No turret roof, no antique dome,
No stately elm to cast its shade,
Nor gloomy yew to flank the glade?
Will suit thee ill, whose life was passed
Amidst the glory ages cast
On your ancestral pile;
Around the grey and gloomy walls
Of Hilton?s proud and ancient halls
In Britain?s far-off Isle.


XXVII.
? ? Though poor it is, unworthy thee,
Yet highly honoured would it be
If you consent with us to dwell,
Like lonely hermit in his cell,
Like banished exile settle here,
With no congenial spirit near,
Save one old man in life?s decline,
Who long hath passed meridian?s prime,
And one bright star, his hope and pride?
The image fair of her that died,
And now is lying lone
In Boroondara far away,
lowly lies her sainted clay
Beneath the marble stone.?
XXVIII.
u I wished to speak, to let him hear
How much I prized a life so dear;
But ere my thoughts had utt?rance ta?en,
He hastily resumed again :
* When first I came within this wild,
Ere Maggie?s mother on me smiled,
My heart high throbbed with foolish pride
That dame Tradition?s tongue supplied;
But banished the delusion vain,
That, cherished, brings its victim pain;
For boasted birth was nought to me,
Where life a struggle long should be
In this fair land, that sweetly smiles
On all alike from British Isles ?
From German shore or Russian plain,


From smiling France or sunny Spain,
Or even on that Tartar band
From China?s oriental land ;
The Jew and Gentile on her store
May win alike the golden ore
That glitters in her sand,
That deep within her bosom lies,
That man?s ambition deifies
In ev?ry Christian land.
XXIX.
??I battled hard, I brushed along,
And roughed it with the roughest throng,
That could be gathered to mine aid,
Of ev?ry nation, clime, and shade.
My hut of logs where light was seen?
Ay, sun and stars?the slabs between !
My roof of bark with timber laid,
Like ribs across to keep it stayed !
My grate, a yawning chasm wild
Of stones and clay chaotic piled !
My bed a canvas stretcher slim,
That scarce had space to stand within?
Where wild disorder held its reign
Untrammelled in its own domain !
The blackened ?billy? told a tale
Of useful life adown the vale
Some twenty years ago,
Where yet unchanged my dwelling stands,
Among the huts of station hands,
Five hundred yards below.


XXX.
? * I?ve often in the saddle been
From dawn to dark, no meal between;
And when I reached the hut at night,
Too wearied out the fire to light,
I?ve drunk a pannikin of tea
Remaining cold siuce made by me
At early dawn of morning grey;
Then on my stretcher weary lay?
Too tir?d to think I?ve sunk to rest,
No anxious care upon my breast ?
Now, in the land of slumbers, I
Across the plains in fancy fly;
Now scour the ranges far and wide;
Now up the mountain?s craggy side,
Or down the gorges rugged ride.
In dreaming Fancy?s wild career
I sped o?er creeks like bounding deer:
Such dreams, indeed, were reflex true
Of what I daily then went through;
Yet, still, I look with fond regret
To days I never shall forget?
Those happy days gone by ?
What though I buried all my pride,
And roughed it on the roughest side
Beneath an Austral sky !
XXXI.
? ?For you less turbulent will be
The stream that turbid flowed for me;
But, yet, I pray you?ll understand
A pioneer within this land
A dreamer?s fancies must forego,


And in the struggle courage show ;
Must shoulders brush throughout the strife
With elements of vulgar life;
The olden pride must bury deep
Where young ambition?s yearnings sleep.
And now, my friend, if still you mean
To battle on this rugged scene,
My overseer you shall be;
But still an honoured friend to me ;
Nor shall I pay with niggard hand
Your service in this golden ,land:
From small beginnings fortunes spring,
If to the battle?s strife we bring
A willing heart and steady brain,
With perseverance in their train.?
XXXII.
?What boots it now, long years are gone.
My gratitude to dwell upon ?
The morn was waning fast away,
And still we chatted on;
My duties in abeyance lay
Till one short week be gone.
To rest me from my journey o?er
The long and weary wave,
To reach Australia?s far-off shore,
My home ?my destined grave !
That week of blissful, bright repose,
Whose mem?ry haunts at Nature?s close,
Will haunt and linger round the tomb
To radiate its sullen gloom,
And fright the charnel crowd away
That hideous batten on decay!?


That week!?that bright pellucid stream
Of life and love's ecstatic dream?
In dreamy rapture glided on,
And cast its spell my life upon.
XXXIII.
u A letter that arrived that day
Called Henty hastily away ?
An urgent summons to come down
And spend a hasty week in town ?
This news the slightest, passing shade
On Maggie?s brow a moment laid.
I saw she guessed the hidden cause
That from his home her parent draws:
Whate?er it was I knew it pained
For that short moment it remained ;
But as the valley?s sunny side,
When floating shadows o?er it glide,
Resumes its golden glow anew
Before the impress well we view,
So passed away the shadow?d pain,
And left her brow as bright again.
XXXIY.
? That ev?ning Henty went away
To that fair city by the bay,
In early life?s young budding dream,
Upon the banks of Yarra?s stream ?
To Melbourne city ?bursting forth
With vigour foreign to the North ?
Which now might hold a primal place
Among the cities of our race


In older lands I ween;
But rears her head in peerless pride,
The cities of the South beside?
A solitary queen !
XXXY.
?We wandered down at ev?ning close
To where the station huts arose ;
Within the valley lone they lay,
Five hundred yards or more away.
The noisy life, the busy sound,
Of stern and bearded men around,
In manhood?s strong and stalwart prime,
From ev?ry land, from ev?ry clime
(For shearing season, just begun,
Had thickly peopled Henty?s run),
Arose upon the ev?ning air
From motley groups? assembled there.
xxxyi.
? As slowly we approached the crowd,
Its noisy tumult rising loud,
I watched the strange and busy scene
The trunks of stringy-bark between.
Here, improvised with little care,
A cooking range in open air,
On simple nature?s rustic plan,
Upheld the broken frying-pan ;
Indented * billys? stood beside,
As dark as Erebus?s tide;
While some exert their cooking skill,
Some others at the river fill
The varied vessels they employ
The day?s ablutions to enjoy.


XXXVII.
?No queen among the courtly throng,
That fawn and flatter all day long,
Could draw such homage from the proud
As Maggie from this rugged crowd.
They loved the very ground she trod,
Could even kiss the hallow'd sod,
Where?er her foot a moment lay,
To take the impress light away.
Their toil a moment they suspend,
And now in nature?s homage bend ?
Such grace her presence fair bestows
Upon untutor?d men like those ?
Her words were few, she told the crowd,
That deep in lowly rev?rence bowed,
Or stood in admiration dumb,
That I, her father?s friend, had come
To lend mine aid upon the soil,
And mitigate his wonted toil;
That I their master hence should be,
And due respect be paid to me,
If that they would her favour gain
And loyal to their trust remain.
A cheering cry rang long and loud,
Responsive from the faithful crowd?
The portion better known ?
While Maggie, smiling, bowed to hear
That welcome, simple and sincere,
And honest in its tone.
XXXVIII.
?We wandered on along the hill,
Thro? twilight stealing, calm and still.


Nor sought we soon the ev?ning meal,
Tho? long had rung the warning peal.
Within a deep verandah's shade
The table for the tea was laid;
The moonbeams struggled to obtain
Employment in that dim domain.
A shaded lamp alone bestowed
The light that, glowing mellow, showed
Where Maggie sat like fabled queen,
Or gladsome woodland fay ?
Like spirit of some fairy scene
That fancy chases in a dream,
That, laughing, flees away.
xxxix.
?When tea was o?er she led the way
To where the ladies? bower lay,
That sweet resort where women fly
When wine and wassail revel high.
A smiling realm of fairy taste
Was here before my vision placed;
But ere my wonder could subside,
She glided softly from my side,
The grand piano sat before,
And ran the keys her fingers o?er;
While, in a soft and plaintive strain,
She sweetly sang this sad refrain:
? ?MAGGIE'S SONG.
? ? That moment sad I?ll ne?er forget
You bade me long farewell,
Beside the rock, the sighing trees,
Adown the lonely dell;


Where oft we met in other days,
And thought we?d never part;
Where oft you kissed my willing lips,
And pressed me to your heart.
? ?l?ll ne?er forget that moment wild,
Your wailing heart?s despair,
When in your eager, burning hand
I placed that lock of hair ?
The lock I stole with secret love
From off my fevered brow;
The wild emotion of your heart,
Methinks I feel it now !
??Tho? long, long days have passed away,
I see you standing there,
As on that well-remembered night,
The reflex of despair !
Oh! when will mem?ry pass away
To still this heart of mine,
To drown its thoughts of other days
When fondly pressed to thine !
<% ? Oh ! when will mem?ry cease to live,
To still this weary mind,
This weary torture of the soul,
This anguish undefined!
Oh! when will calm, and peace, and rest
Possess my weary soul,
And still this wild, untutor?d heart,
Beyond my weak control!?
i
? I saw the tears steal down her cheek;
I pressed her hand ?I dared not speak?
The light subdued a softness threw


Of golden halo?s palest hue.
The moment lone had lent its aid,
Within the chamber?s mellow?d shade,
To thrill my heart with throbbings wild,
As thro? her crystal tears she smiled.
A whirl of wild excitement came
Around my heart in glowing flame :
I kissed her unresisting hand
With lips like Egypt?s burning sand ;
With throbbing heart and heated brain
Poured forth in love?s low, pleading strain
The tale so long and often told,
That never, never can grow old.
In passion?s words I told the tale
Of love that time could never pale,
That sorrow?s gloom could never change,
Nor all the bliss of life estrange?
The love that sealed my fatal doom,
The love I?m betaring to the tomb !
?In softly breathed whispers low
She told me what I longed to know;
Nor left me in suspense remain?
My pleading was not made in vain.
I clasped her, yielding, to my heart,
As though we?d never, never part;
I kissed her warm and blushing brow,
No lips had ever pressed till now
In love?s bewitching, fond caress,
In love?s endearing tenderness.
And, oh! that fond and trusting smile
She sweetly beamed on me the while?
While dreamy gazing in mine eyes,


As softly on my bosom lies
Her velvet cheek and tresses brown,
That darkly floated wavy down?
Sent rapture strange and undefined
In wild disorder thro? my mind.
XLII.
?Ingentle converse, soft and low,
Like currents deep that rapid flow,
The moments swift unnoticed glide
With Maggie seated by my side.
Her plighted troth was all mine own
Before that hour of bliss had flown ?
Her ev?ry tone upon mine ear
Was like the echoes that we hear,
As. thrilling with resistless spell,
They linger for awhile,
When faintly dies the organ?s swell
Far down the holy aisle.
Nor was our bliss unblent with pain,
For other thoughts unwelcome came ?
Of how her father, haughty, cold,
Would hear of all his projects old
Destroyed by one whose honour he
Had trusted with sincerity;
But in our happiness, howe?er,
We dreamt not then of future care,
Eesolving that we should not tell
What in his absence short befell;
But hide the secret of our love
From all but the Unseen above;
And when the dreaded moment came?
As come it must some day?
To brave the worst and bear the blame,


For potent Love?s most hallowed flame
Oft reason leads astray.
XLIII.
? A week of rapture passed away,
A dream of love from day to day,
As o?er the plains I daily ride
With Maggie mounted by my side.
She rode a swift and noble steed,
And well could moderate his speed,
As down the gorges deep we rode,
Where human foot had rarely strode
Since first creation dawned;
Or up the hill?s deep-wooded side,
O?er fallen trunks and gullies wide,
O?er crevices that yawned ;
While oft she left me far behind,
Her laughter ringing on the wind,
Her hair embracing light her zone,
In wanton, loose disorder blown,
As on she bounded o?er the plain,
Or back resumed her pace again?
That headlong pace anon?
And at my efforts vain she?d smile,
That horsemanship from Britain?s Isle
I piqued myself upon.
XLIY.
?And oft at noonday?s burning blaze
We?d seek a cooling shade,
And fly the scorching, solar rays
Within some forest glade.
The reins upon a bough she?d fling,


And, laughing, lightly bound,
With graceful, agile, airy spring,
Unaided to the ground.
And then beneath the cooling shade
Her whip and gloves and hat she laid ?
A meet-, sequester?d spot to shun
The burning rays of Austral sun ?
There, stretched beneath embow?ring screen,
Of foliage deep and evergreen,
I?ve laid me down for hours long
Her classic face to gaze upon;
And there to Maggie?s gentle ear
Oft read the tales she loved to hear,
That never failed to draw a sigh,
Or moisten dim her melting eye.
The grief of Constance now she?d share,
Now pity gentle Lady Clare,
Would now upbraid, now Marmion praise,
With all a woman?s fickle ways,
So hard to understand.
Oh ! these were happy, happy days
I read to her the poet?s lays
Of Caledonia?s land.
?Anon the tale she would not hear,
And drawing nearer and more near,
Her arm around my neck she?d twine,
And press her glowing cheek to mine;
Or, gazing down into mine eyes,
With that unchanging love, that dies
Not e?en beyond the ghostly tomb,
In Time?s eternal, dreaded womb,
She?d brush my locks of truant hair


And twine them round her finger fair,
And stroke my cheek from wrinkles free*
Not hollow then, as now you see,
And kiss my brow?O God, the thrill!
I feel the shock electric still.
O, rapture sweet of love?s caress !
Thou essence of life?s happiness !
Ah ! why art thou for ever fled,
And left me lone to mourn thee dead,
To dwell upon my bitter fate,
And hers ??But I anticipate.
XLYI.
4 ?Among the station hands I saw,
My second day at Millewa,
A man, who struck me at the time
As one who would not shrink from crime.
Should dark and deadly deeds demand,
A cruel heart and ruthless hand.
The scowling mien he never tried
At any time from me to hide;
Showed that he viewed my advent there
As tigress in her forest lair,
That savage growls before her brood,
Resents the steps that would intrude.
While broad hia build, aud strong of limb.
Forbidding was his visage grim;
The narrow brow o?erhanging down
His features gave a savage frown;
While deadly malice hidden lay
In that dull eye of leaden grey.
The lips were thin, a palish blue,
Of faint and sickly livid hue;
And round the corners one could scan


The cruel nature of the man.
The lower face and nostril wide,
Licentious passions typified.
The hollow cheek and shrivelled skin
Betrayed no trace of blood within;
While dark, reflected passions bare,
With no redeeming feature there,
Were seen their demon war to wage
On that repulsive, open page.
XLYII.
?And when, by chance, I caught his
Among the ? hands ? when passing by,
I felt a strange repugnant chill,
That undefined and mystic thrill
(As superstition weirdly tells
When man is subject to her spells,
And hearkens to her tones),
That thrills the bravest of the brave,
If step unknowing cross the grave
That?s destined for his bones.
XLYIII.
?I sought his history to know
One ev?ning in the glen below
He came a year or two before,
They merely knew his name ?no more !
He soon became a useful ? hand,?
Then overseer of the band;
For Henty prized his knowledge rare,
Obtained he knew not how, nor where.
He recked but little of the past
Of where his bygone life was cast ?
What tho? he bore the felon brand
From Norfolk or Yan Dieman?s Land,


His useful, willing service won
That place of trust upon the run
That I, unwitting, was to hold,
While he resumed his place of old,
Deprived of all his sway ?
In him ?twas easy then to know
I?d have a dark, remorseless foe,
Until my dying day.
XLIX.
?The station name this worthy bore?
Tho?, sooth to say, he had a score?
Was Bill M'Ginty?better, still,
His name was known as Norfolk Bill;
But how, or whence the knowledge came
That won him this unenvied name ?
Suggestive of his past career? ?
The hands among did not appear.
They never liked the villain mean
Since first his rufiian face was seen;
But when he rose above the band,
And bossed them with unsparing hand??
For petty tyrants of the hour,
Whom fortune elevates to power,
Evince this trait, that marks their kind,
This littleness of little mind?
The hate they bore to Norfolk Bill
Was not estranged, but deeper still.
I felt, thro? this, I could depend
Upon the willing aid they?d lend
To thwart the villain?s dark designs,
Whate?er arose in after times.


? That fleeting week was past and gone,
And all my duties entered on,
When news from Herbert Henty came ?
Another week he must remain
Before returning home from town,
As fortune did not seem to crown
The mission that had drawn him there,
Unwilling, from his daughter fair.
The note was penned in cheery strain,
Yet every line betokened plain
That Herbert Henty vainly tried
Some deep anxiety to hide.
But when I saw the stricken face
Of Maggie, as she read apace,
And reached that dreaded portion where
He hinted that she must prepare
The ? stranger?s? sleeping-room with haste,
With all her good, unerring taste,
My heart grew cold to see her there
The image wan of chill despair.
? Forgetful of my presence nigh,
She gazes long with vacant eye
And troubled look upon the page;
The fate those simple words presage,
In their dread import well she knew,
With its attendant sorrow, too.
A moment sped?an age to me,
The witness of her misery?
Yet for my life I could not dare
Intrude my love, or seek to share
The secret of her mental woe,


Tho? longing much the source to know ;
But now her eyes she slowly raised,
And wistfully in mine she gazed,
Her finger pointing to the line,
As from her marble hand to mine
She passed the scroll for me to scan,
And saw me tremble ?me, a man !
With frightened whisper in mine ear,
As tho? the walls might even hear; ?
? Canst guess, mine own, this secret friend
Who comes, a week or two to spend ?
Canst guess, my darling, who ?twill be ?
O God! protect us now !? ?tis HE !?
? ?Twas needless then to tell me who ?
That dreaded ? he ? too well I knew
Could be but one that would impart
Such speechless woe to Maggie?s heart.
And as the dread conviction rose,
With all its heart-oppressive woes,
I strove in haste my nerves to steel
With courage feigned I could not feel;
And lightly tried to laugh away
The dawning cares of coming day;
Then kissed the tears that soon began
To trickle down her features wan,
And watched the drops of crystal glide,
For well I knew the pent-up tide,
That now began to overflow,
Would aid to drown her source of woe.
A moment more my manner gay
Dispelled in baste her gloom away,
As morning?s early, summer beam


The mist from fount, and lake, and stream
Or as the penetrating ray
That enters cell of dungeon grey,
The rusty bars between,
Dispels the wretched captive?s gloom,
And brightens up his living tomb,
And radiates the scene.
?Ah, joyous youth! ah, happy time!
When hearts were bright as orient clime.
When Hope could chase the brooding cloud
Before it cast its gloomy shroud
Around the heart, upon the brow,
Alas ! we miss thy presence now.
O simple heart in folly?s ways !
O verdant spring of early days !
When all is young, and fresh, and fair,
And life a dream of beauty rare,
And smiling Hope unceasing shone,
We prized thee not till thou wert gone
With happy youth?s elastic mind
She cast her sorrow to the wind.
In sweet communion soft and low?
Those whispered nothings lovers know ?
She soon forgot the passing shade
Her father?s news unwelcome made.
?That night she played for hours long,
And many a sweet and plaintive song,
The Eastern nightingale might own,
She warbled in that chamber lone;
Anon, she sought to hear me play,
And softly sing some lover?s lay;


Another time I would not dare
To touch the keys or chant an air ;
Now diffidence aside I flung,
And while she listened thus I sung:?
? ? SONG.
? ? In the early morning,
Ere the stars are paling,
Long before the dawning
O?er the sky is sailing,
Dreaming of thee only
By the rapid river,
In that moment lonely?
Dreaming, dreaming ever !
? ?Where the moonbeams shimmer
O?er its bosom silent,
And the waters glimmer
Bound the river island?
Always bright and gleaming,
Mellow, rich, and shining,
There of Lena dreaming,
Desmond lies reclining.
? ?Where the winds, in howling,
Bend the trees asunder,
And the tempest growling
Mocks the mighty thunder;
Where the lightnings quiver,
Bright and forked and gleaming.
the rapid river
Desmond lies a-dreaming.
4t ? Dreaming of thee only,
There I love to wander,
In the forest lonely
Dreamily to ponder;


Where the winds are sighing,
Sad and soft and lowly,
There I lazy lying,
Dream of Lena solely.
? ? Where the leaflets quiver,
Sioft in dreamy slumber;
Where the rolling river
Flows the dark trees under ;
Where the works of Nature,
Grand and awful seeming,
Rise aloft in stature,
Desmond lies a-dreaming.
? ? Dreaming, Lena, dreaming !
Brightest dreams of pleasure,
While the sky is teeming
With its starry treasure;
Dreaming of thee only,
Bright in beauty?s power;
Hark, the moment lonely?
Midnight?s silent hour !?
?As strangely fled the coming days
As passeth in a dream,
The shady, evanescent haze
Of some forgotten scene?
Some memories of days gone by
We would recall in vain;
But, indistinct, they wanton fly
Across the wildered brain.
Fair Maggie lent but little aid
In all the preparations made;
Nor was the work so tardy done


By Martha?s hands with joy begun.
Old Martha ! Maggie?s trusted maid,
Her friend and nurse, her guardian staid,
Who watched her infant, cradle bed,
And taught her baby feet to tread,
And guided well her youthful days,
And taught her lips the Maker?s praise,
And watched her womanhood so fair
Develop into beauty rare.
< ? Old Martha loved her darling child
With all a mother?s passion wild;
While Maggie?s love and friendship shown
Accorded well with Martha?s own,
And deep repaid the nurse?s care,
For ev?ry thought with her she?d share;
What marvel, then, old Martha Lane
Those preparations made with pain,
That mirrored to her darling pet
No pleasure sweet, but deep regret;
But, like a faithful servant, still
She bowed before ?the master?s? will;
His slightest wish she?d e?er regard,
Tho? now, alas ! the task was hard ?
For Martha noted well the way
Our time we spent from day to day;
Then what of pleasure could she show,
Or welcome on the guest bestow,
Whose coming visit she foresaw
Must trouble bring to Millewa.
? We lately noticed, too, with fear,
M?Ginty?s evil face appear;


At times unwelcome, sudden, rude,
On some pretence he?d oft intrude,
When seated on the sloping hill,
Or by the music-babbling rill,
Oft in the depths of forest glade,
Or in the arbour?s leafy shade;
No place' from his intrusion free,
Or sacred to mv love and me.
f
A shudd?ring sense of coming ill
Arose whenever Norfolk Bill
Destroyed our bright and happy dream,
Unruffled as the gentle stream
That rippled in the dell,
In softest melody along,
And murmured low the sleepy song
That sighing rose and fell.
LYIII.
?From day to day my passion grew,
While time upon its mission flew ;
Night after night we tarried long
The garden walks and shades among.
One evening towards the close of day,
As down the lawn we bent our way,
My arm around her waist entwined,
Her head upon my breast reclined,
She paused, and wildly gazed on me,
In weird and silent mystery?
She seemed so strange; a horrid dread
Its shadow o?er my spirit shed;
But in a moment fled the pain,
And Maggie was herself again.
With frightened lips she whispered low,
Some dread foreboding let her know


That trouble deep was brooding nigh?
Disgrace, and crime, and misery ;
Nor would she longer now remain,
But begged me lead her back again,
While whispered lowly in mine ear
The words ?* He comes to-night,? I hear.
? Upon a couch now seated low,
I tried to calm the tumult?s flow,
That sore disturbed her gentle breast
With anxious fear and deep unrest;
And while I tried her fears to calm,
With all a lover?s soothing balm,
Upon my efforts weak she smiled ;
Then saw her list with terror wild
To steps upon the terrace near,
That fell upon her quickened ear.
Now flushed she with impeded breath,
Now paled as cold and chill as death !
Her eyes were fixed upon the door,
As slowly down the passage floor
She heard, as rigid as the dead,
The ominous, the double tread !
I sudden sprang to Maggie?s side,
The door that moment opened wide ?
A mist of blood in surges came
Across my horror-stricken brain !
O God ! my reeling reason spare !
My brother, Rupert, standing there!?
