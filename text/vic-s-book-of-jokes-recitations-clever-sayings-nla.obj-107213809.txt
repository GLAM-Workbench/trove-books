STOP! LOOK!! LISTEN!!!
A hen is not supposed to have
Much commonsense or tact,
Yet every time she lays an egg
She cackles forth the fact!
The mule—the most despised of beasts—
Has a most persistent way
Of letting people know he’s there,
By his insistent bray!
The busy little bees all buzz.
Bulls roar, and cows all moo;
The watch-dogs bark, the ganders quack.
And doves and pigeons coo!
The peacock spreads his tail and squawks,
Pigs squeal and robins sing.
And even serpents know enough
To hiss before they sting!
A rooster hasn’t got a lot
Of intellect to show.
But. none the less, he always has
Enough good sense to crow!
But Man—the greatest masterpiece
That Nature did devise—
Will often stop and hesitate
Before he’ll Advertise!

DEDICATED
‘TO THE WORLD AND HIS WIFE.”
Preface.
Friends, Romans, and Countrymen:
This little book of “Vic’s” high-class recita-
tions, jokes, sayings, etc., is written by me for
the sole purpose of bringing gladness to the heart
of Man and Woman, and more sunshine to the
World in general. We all seem to be taking
Life too seriously nowadays, yet we are all
willing to admit that Life itself is the greatest
joke of all; so, if by any chance this little book
causes an outburst of laughter or a smile, or
rubs out a wrinkle from someone’s worried brow
or lets a ray of sunshine into an aching heart
or changes a nasty thought into a sweet one,
apart from any selfish financial gain on my part,
it will have, I claim, the unique distinction of
having achieved its object.
Your Smiling Friend,
VIC.

Sleep with His Father!
It’s the first-love affair that hurts, but it’s the
last that matters!
Poverty is really no disgrace—providing, of
course, the victim doesn t owe us anything.
The prettier a woman is, the less she believes
that “love is blind!”
Many a girl is on the shelf to-day because
she kept a fellow waiting on the corner yester-

The Healthy man is full of Egotism.
The Wise man is full of Pessimism.

A moth—because it only eats holes!
A young widow with a fortune is very for-

Many a man has become a “gaol-bird” merely

It takes a brave man to wheel a pram with

Never call a man a fool— borrow from him!


The other day a Jew was found wandering

Ihe other day I went to the Zoo (no! they
didn’t keep me there), and I saw one of the
keepers giving the elephant a drink out of a
bucket. Having been born curious, I asked
the keeper what he was giving the elephant to
drink, and he answered, “Camphor water.”
“Why does an elphant drink camphor
water?”
And he said: To keep the moths away from
his trunk!”
When I was leaving the Zoo to get into a
tram, I noticed a man also getting into the tram,
with a large monkey alongside of him on a chain,
and noticing a number of women and children
on the tram, too, I jumped up from my seat
and said to the conductor, “Do you allow
monkeys on these trams, Mr. Conductor?”
And he replied, “Sit down and they’ll never
notice you!”
I see by the papers that a horse called
Cigarette won a race the other day, but I didn’t
win anything, because I had no roll tobacco!
Many a man kids himself a “wise old bird”
until some woman comes along and makes a
“cuckoo” out of him!

I asked a Sydney friend of mine if he saw
that pretty little poem I put in one of the morn-

was worth the penny!”

Abscess!


(There is no title to this little poem, because
the man who wrote it took poison soon after he
wrote the last line. —Ed.)
Oh! How well do I remember,
It was three years last September,
As I staggered down the street
With manly pride.
My heart was in a flutter
As I fell into a gutter,
And a big Pig came and laid down
By my side.
(Rest.)
Yes, my heart was in a flutter
As 1 lay there in the gutter,
When a lady, passing by,
I heard her say:
“You can tell a man who boozes
By the company that he chooses!
* And the Pig got up and
Slowly walked away!
We are told that it takes seven tailors to
make a man —but one ‘bloomer can break
him!

“THE WHITEST MAN I KNOW.’
(By Fenton Gower.)
He’s a-cruising in a pearler
With a dirty nigger crew,
A-buying pearls and copra
For a stingy Spanish Jew.
And his face is tanned like leather
B’neath a blazing tropic sun,
And he’s working out a penance
For a thing he hasn’t done.
’Round the Solomons he runs,
Trading beads and cast-off guns,
A-buying pearls from grinning niggers,
Loading copra by the tons.
And he’ll curse ’em and he’ll smile.
But he’s thinking all the while
Of a penance that he’s working out
For a thing he hasn’t done.
We’ve been ’round the Horn together.
And I comes to know his worth.
The truest pal I ever had;
The Whitest Man on earth.
He pulled me out of many a scrape.
He’d risk his life for me,
And side by side for many a year
We rough’d it on the sea.


S-s-sh! A woman came between US.
Boys, she was as beautiful as Venus
And she set her cap at him,
And she hooked him un-a-wares.
So I sails off on me own,
A-leaving him and her alone;
I signs aboard a tramp for Frisco,
A-leaving them in Buenos Ayres.
When I met him in a twelve-month,
He was gone to the deuce;
She had blacken’d all the good in him
She play’d him fast and loose.
And she ran away with a Dago,
Who was letting dollars fly,
And left my mate to drink away
His precious soul and die.
Well, I talk’d and talk’d him over,
’Til we signs aboard the Rover.
It was just like good old times again
Til we shores at Rio Bay.
There the hand of Fate show’ d plain
Brought us face to face again
With the woman and the Dago
Who had taken her away.


Listen! We were sitting in a cafe
When the couple came along.
Sne simply smiled and pass’d us by,
And vanish’d in the throng.
My mate jump’d up to follow,
But I wouldn’t let him stir,
And later on the waiter
Brought a note that came from her.
In it—she pretend’d she was sorry
For the wrong that she had done.
And she frett’d for the wrong she done
So she want’d to atone.
There was so much to explain,
Would he meet her once again
In the garden after midnight?
She would wait for him alone.
He went, and, unbeknowns to him,
I followed on behind.
We watched, we saw, the shadows
Of two figures on the blind.
’Twas the woman and the Dago,
And I heard the Dago shout.
They quarrell’d, the woman scream’d.
And then a shot rang out.


My mate dash’d through the curtain,
And I follow’d, making certain
That me little gun was ready,
’Case I had to make a stand!
There we saw the Dago dead,
With a bullet thro’ his head,
And the woman alongside of him.
With a shooter in her hand.
Before the Civil Guard came in
My mate had snatched her gun
And told them to arrest HIM!
For a thing he hadn’t done.
I—l tried madly to explain things,
But they shook their heads at me
And the woman let ’em take him,
So that she could get off free!
(Rest
In the Court I sat and heard her
Tell ’em all—he done the murder —
And I pray’d that she might be stricken
Into some ungodly shape!
Well, friends, he was sentenced for his life,
But out there —where corruption’s rife—
I bribed and bribed, until at last
I managed his escape!


And I stow’d him on a hooker,
Sailing far from woman’s wiles.
And he s working his salvation out
Among those South Sea Isles.
While the woman’s there at Rio,
A-weaving of a spell,
With a crowd of fools, awaiting her command
To burning hell!
But the Whitest Man I know
Runs a Christie Minstrel show.
A-buying pearls from grinning niggers,
Loading copra by the ton.
And he’ll bargain and he’ll smile,
But, surely, he’s thinking all the while
Of a penance that he’s working out
For-a-thing-he’s-never-done!
Some people can’t possibly be two-faced, or
else they would wear the other one!


SHE’S A SHEIK!
In the days of Cleopatra and Anthony the
latter had just won another battle, and he sent
his runners up to tell Cleo. to doll herself up, as
he was coming along to have a yarn with her.
On his way up to her flat, Anthony met one of
his runners returning, and the runner threw him-
self, carpet-like, before Anthony and said; L>!
kind sir, Cleopatra is down with Tonsihtis!
“Dash those Greeks!” muttered Anthony; “I
shall declare war on them in the morning.
WHICH ONE WAS SILLY?
A Superintendent who had just taken over
an asylum, in order to show his democratic
views, took off his uniform and, donning plain
clothes, went down the yard, where the
“Lunies” roamed around talking to trees, etc.
To the first man he came to, he said, “Good
morning,” and the lunatic replied with the same
greeting, just as sweetly then, looking hard at
the newcomer, he added: I don t remember
ever seeing you before!”
“No,” answered the Superintendent, smilingly.
“You see. I’m not one of you boys-—er—Fm
the new superintendent around here!
The lunatic looked hard at him again, and
then replied: “Boy, you’ll get that knocked out
of you I was blooming Napoleon himself
when I came here!

THE PIG-TAIL OF LI FANG FU
(by Sax Rohmer.)
They speak of a dead man’s vengeance.
They whisper a deed of hell,
Neath the Mosque of Mohammed Ali,
And this is the thing they tell.
In a deep and a midnight gully.
By the street where the goldsmiths are
Neath the Mosque of Mohammed Ali,
At the back of the Scent Bazaar,
Was the House of a Hundred Raptures,
The tomb of a thousand sighs,
Where the sleepers lay in that living death
Which the opium smoker dies.
At the House of a Hundred Raptures,
Where the reek of a Joss-stick rose;
From the knees of the Golden Idol,
To the tip of his gilded nose;
Through the billowing oily vapour,
I he smoke of the black Chandu,
There a lantern green cast a serpent sheen
On the pig-tail of Li Fang Fu.


There was Rams Lai of Bhiwani,
Who could smoke more than any three;
A pair of Kashmiri dancing girls.
And Ameer Khan Motee.
And there was a grey-haired soldier, too —
The wreck of a splendid man —
When the place was still I’ve heard mounted
drill
Being muttered by “Captain Dan.’
Then one night, as I lay a-dreaming,
There were shuddering, frenzied screams
But the smoke had its spell upon me —
I was chained to that couch of dreams.
All my strength, all my will, had left me.
Because of the black Chandu,
And upon the floor—by the closed, barred
door—
Lay the daughter of Li Fang Fu.
’Twas the first time I ever met her,
But often I dream of her now;
For she was as sweet as a lotus,
With the grace of a willow bough
The daintiest ivory maiden
That ever a man called fair.
And I saw blood drip where Li Fang Fu’s whip
Had tattered her shoulder bare.


I fought for the power to curse him.
And never a word would come.
To reach him! To kill him!
But opium has stricken me helpless and dumb.
He lashed her again and again.
Until she uttered a moaning prayer,
And, as he whipped, so the red blood dripped
From her ivory shoulders bare.
When crash went a window behind me,
And in leapt a grey-haired man,
And he tore the whip from the devil’s grip.
I knew him—’twas Captain Dan!
Never a word spoke he; but, remorseless,
Grim, his brow with anger black,
He lashed and lashed till the shirt was slashed
From the Chinaman’s writhing back.
And when in his grasp the whip broke short.
He out with his long, keen knife—
The pig-tail, for which a Chinaman
Would barter his gold-—his life!
He cut the pig-tail from Li Fang Fu,
And this is the thing they tell
By the Mosque of Mohammed Ali—
For it lea to a deed of hell.


In his terrible icy passion.
Captain Dan that pig-tail plied.
And with it he thrashed the Chinaman
Until any but he, had died.
Until Li Fang Fu dropped limply down —-
Too feeble, it seemed, to stand—
But swift to arise, with death in his eyes,
And a long, keen knife in his hand.
Like fiends of an opium vision,
They closed in a fight for life,
And nearer the breast of the Captain crept
The blade of a gleaming knife.
Then a shot 1 a groan, a wisp of smoke.
I swooned and knew no more,
Save that Li Fang Fu lay silent and still
In a red pool near the door.
But ever shall I remember now
That curtain of sleep was drawn.
And I woke, ’midst a deadly silence,
In the darkness before the dawn.
There was blood on the Golden Idol.
My God, that dream was true!
For there, like a slumbering serpent,
Lay the pig-tail of Li Fang Fu.


From the House of a Hundred Raptures
I crept, ere the news should spread
That the devil’s due had claimed Li Fang Fu,
And that Li Fang Fu was dead!
(Rest)
’Twas the end of an Indian summer.
When Fate or the ancient ties
Drew my steps again to the gully,
To the tomb of a Thousand Sighs.
And the door of the house was open;
All the blood in my heart grew cold,
For within sat the Golden Idol,
And he leered as he leered of old.
And I thought that his eyes were moving
In a sinister, vile grimace.
When suddenly there, at his feet, I saw
A staring and well-known face.
With the shriek of a soul in torment
I turned like a frenzied man.
Falling back from the spot where the moonlight
Poured down upon “Captain Dan.”
He was dead, and in death was fearful,
With features of ghastly hue,
And, snake-like ’round his throat was found
The—Pig-tail—-of—Li-—Fang—Fu!


This world is full of willing people—a few
willing to work and the rest willing to let them!
You can often tell what a woman really
means by what she doesn’t say.
The man who thinks he knows a woman like
a book usually discovers a few uncut pages.
Cork-screws have sunk more people than
cork-jackets will ever save.
When money talks, good taste is too quiet
to be heard.
Tact is the art of lying gracefully in a pass
for the stalls of this world and a pit for the
next.
A handsome man knows his world, but not
always his power. A beautiful woman knows
her power, but not always her world.
A woman stops telling her age as soon as her
age starts telling on her.


They say —two heads are always better than
one, but you try and convince a father of twins
about this!
A director is known by the Company he
keeps.
From an English paper: A gentleman
wants shooting.”
It’s the angel of a girl that plays the devil
with a man.
A modern wife nowadays doesn’t want a
husband who will go through fire for her. She
wants one who will get up on a cold morning
and make one for her!
Although we can’t see any reason for riots
in India —the Hindu!
A toothless woman never sees anything worth
laughing at.
He jests at scars who has never dodged a
car.


All men are homeless, but some are home
less than others.
Never take on a better half until you are sure
of better “quarters.”
Asked why he didn’t drown his sorrow, a man
pointed out he couldn’t because she was too
good a swimmer!
Before marriage a man swears to love.
After marriage a man loves to swear.
Life be one darn thing after another, but
Love is two darn things after one another!
I had a lovely flower garden.
But my love for it is dead,
Cause I found a bachelor’s button
In my little Pansy’s bed.
Motor cars think they are doing you a favour
by missing you nowadays.
The wife who comes down to the breakfast-
table with her hair anyhow usually starts her
husband on the road to some other woman’s
breakfast-table.


’OSTLER JOE.
(By George R. Sims.)
I stood at eve when the sun went down
By the grave where a woman lies,
lured men’s souls to the shores of Sin
With the light of wanton eyes.
Who sang the song that the siren sang
On the treacherous Lurley Height,
Whose face was as fair as a summer’s day
And whose heart was as black as night.
Yet a blossom I fain would pick to-day
From the garden above her dust;
Not the languorous lily of soulless sin,
Nor the blood-red rose of lust;
But a sweet white blossom of holy Love
That grew in that one green spot,
In the acrid desert of Phryne’s life,
Where all else was parched and hot.
In the summer, when the meadows
Were aglow with blue and red,
Joe, the ’Ostler of “The Magpie,’’
And fair Annie Smith were wed
Plump was Annie, plump and pretty,
With a face as fair as snow;
He was anything but handsome
Was the “Magpie’s’’ ’Ostler Joe.


But he won the winsome lassie
They’d a cottage and a cow,
And her matronhood sat lightly
On the village beauty’s brow;
Sped the months and came a baby
Such a blue-eyed baby boy.
Joe was working in the stables
When they told him of his joy.
He was rubbing down the horses;
Gave them, then and there,
All a special feed of clover
Just in honour of his heir.
It has been his great ambition
(And he told his horses so)
That the fates would send a baby
Who might bear the name of Joe.
Little Joe the child was christened,
And, like babies, grew apace.
He d his mother s eyes of azure.
And his father’s honest face.
Swift the happy years went over—
eais of blue and cloudless sky ;
Love was lord of that small cottage
And the tempters passed them by


Down the lane by Annie’s cottage
Chanced a gentleman to roam.
He caught a glimpse of Annie
In her bright and happy home.
Thrice he came and saw her sitting
By the window with her child.
And he nodded to the baby.
And the baby laughed and smiled.
So at last it grew to know him
(Little Joe was nearly four).
He would call the pretty “gemplum”
As he passed the open door;
And one day he ran and caught him.
And in child’s play pulled him in,
Thus the baby Joe had prayed for
Brought about the mother’s sin.
Twas the same old wretched story
That for ages bards have sung;
’Twas a woman, weak and wanton,
And a villain’s tempting tongue;
’Twas a picture deftly painted
For silly creatures’ eyes
Of the Babylonian wonders
And the joy that in them lies.


Annie listened, and was tempted—
Was tempted, and she fell.
As the Angels fell from Heaven,
To the blackest depths of Hell;
She was promised wealth and splendour
And a life of gentle sloth,
Yellow gold for child and husband—
And the woman left them both!
Home that eve came Joe, the ’Ostler
With a cheery cry of “Wife,”
Finding that which blurred forever
All the story of his life.
She had left a silly letter,
Through the cruel scrawl he spelt;
1 hen he sought the lonely bedroom,
joined his horny hands and knelt.
“Now, O Lord, forgive her.
For she ain’t to blame!” he cried,
“For I ought to seen her trouble
And a-gone away and died!
Why, a girl like her, God bless her,
’Twasn’t likely as her’d rest
With her bonny head forever
On a ’Ostler’ s ragged vest”


“It was kind of her to bear with me
All the long and happy time;
So, for my sake, please forgive her,
Though you count her deed a crime
If so be, I don’t pray proper. Lord.
Forgive me, for you see,
I can talk all right to horses,
But I’m kind a strange to Thee!’
Ne’er a line came to the cottage
From the woman who had flown.
Joe, the baby, died that winter.
And the man was left alone.
Ne’er a bitter word he uttered.
But in silence kissed the rou,
Saving what he told his horses,
Saving what he told his God!
Far away in mighty London
Rose the wanton into fame.
For her beauty won men’s homage,
And she prospered in her shame.
Quick from lord to lord she flitted,
Higher still each prize she won,
And her rivals paled beside her
As the stars beside the sun.


Next she trod the stage half naked,
And she dragged a temple down
To the level of a market
For the women on the town;
And the kisses she had given
To poor ’Ostler Joe for naught,
With their gold and priceless jewels
Rich and titled rogues bought.
Went the years with flying footsteps
While her star was at its height;
Then the darkness came on swiftly,
And the gloaming turned to night.
Shattered strength and faded beauty
Tore the laurels from her brow;
Of the thousands who had worshipped
Never one came near her now.
Broken down in health and fortune,
Men forgot her very name,
Till the news that she was dying
Woke the echoes of her fame.
And the papers, in their gossip,
Mentioned how an actress lay
Sick to death in humble lodgings,
Growing weaker every day.


One there was who read the story
In a far-off country place,
And that night the dying woman woke
And looked upon his face.
Once again the strong arms clasped her
That had clasped her long ago,
And the weary head lay pillowed
Upon the breast of ’Ostler Joe.
All the past he had forgiven—
All the sorrow and the shame.
He had found her sick and lonely,
And his wife he now could claim.
Since the grand folks who had known hei
One and all had slunk away,
He could clasp his long-lost darling.
And no man could say him nay!
In his arms Death found her lying.
From his arms her spirit fled.
And his tears came down in torrents
As he knelt beside his dead.
Never once his love had faltered
Through her sad unhallowed life.
And the stone above her ashes
Bears the sacred name of “Wife.’
That’s the blossom I fain would pluck to-day
From the garden above her dust.
Not the languorous lily of soulless sin
Nor the blood-red rose of lust;
But a sweet white blossom of holy Love
That grew in that one green spot
In the acrid desert of Phryne’s life,
Where all else was parched and hot.


COLLEGE PUZZLES.
It has always been a puzzle to me
What sailors sow when they plough the sea ?
Does coffee go down with the roll of the drum
And why is a speaking likeness dumb?
What is it that makes a window blind?
Whose picture is carried in a frame of mind?
When a storm is brewing, what does it brew?
And does the foot of a mountain wear a shoe?
How long does it take to hatch a plot?
Has a school of Whales a tutor or not?
Have you ever perused a volume of smoke?
Can butter be made from the Cream of
“Vic.’s” joke?
Can you fasten a door with a lock of hair?
Did the bitter wind ever bite you and where?
Who is it paints the sign of the times?
Does the moon change quarters for nickels and
dimes?
How can money be tight when change is loose?
Now, what in the name of Thunder’s the use
Of going through College and taking degrees
When we’re faced with problems such as these?

“Let not thy fancy be guided by thine eye,
nor let thy will be formed by thy fancy; but
let thy understanding moderate between thine
eye and thy fancy!"—F. Quarries.
Lord Beacon said: "Those who derive their
worth from their ancestors resemble potatoes,
the most valuable part of which is under-
ground."
We have it on reliable authority that, whereas
in days gone by Scotchmen used to love to
emigrate to London, now they are being born
there to save the expense of travelling down.
DO YOU KNOW
That ice can be found in large quantities
at both the North and South Poles!
No matter how fast a fish may swim, it will
never perspire !
There are really no feathers in the wings of
a hospital!
The hair on a pig is really all on the one
side —the outside
No mouse will ever agree with us when we
say that a black cat is an omen of good luck!


LAMB AND MINT SAUCE, PLEASE.
Mary took her little lamb
Through Melbourne for a sprint,
And in a fit of playfulness

It’s very wrong of people to say that the

“Now, Tommy,” said the Teacher, “why

Three cross-eyed prisoners were brought up
before a cross-eyed Judge in Chicago, and to
the first prisoner the Judge said; “What s your
name?”
The second man, thinking he was_ being
spoken to, answered; “John Smith, Sir.
The Judge turned indignantly to him and
said: “I wasn’t speaking to you, was I?”
And the third man said; “So help me God,
Sir, I didn’t say anything!’’
When Pat reached home that evening he was
telling his wife a peculiar experience he had in
the city that day. He said he was walking
along the street, and he thought he saw a friend
of his walk past him, so he shouted out: Hello,

turned around and said. My name s not Tom,
and he turned around and said, ‘My name s not
Mick, either,’ and, bejabers! when we both

was neither of us!
I see the Two Black Crows are talking about
the “early bird catching the worm” stuff on their

THE PERSIAN KITTY.
(By Claude Hare.)
The Persian Kitty, perfumed and fair,
Strolled into the garden—just for air,
When a Tom-cat, leath, lithe, and strong,
A-wagging his tail, just came along.
How s it, Kid? said Tom-cat with a smile;
“What about trusting your new pal for awhile?
Let s get away from this old backyard fence;
All you need, my dear, is exper-i-ence! ”
But I don t know you! was her curt reply,
And of strangers Fm a trifle shy.”
Oh! its all right,” he said, with a grin;
“When we fall out, you’ll fall in!”
The morning after the night before
The Persian Kitty came back at four;
The look in her innocent eyes had went.
But the smile on her face was a smile of content.
And in the aftermath, my friends, when children
came
To that Persian Kitten of pedigreed fame,
They weren’t Persian—they were black and
tan,
And she told them their daddy was a travelling
man.
He was—he’d shifted!


A STORY OF ST. PETER.
(By Peter the Hermit.)
St. Peter stood guard at the Golden Gate
With a solemn mien and an air sedate,
When up to the top of the golden stair
A Man and a Woman ascended there.
Applied for admission, there came and stood
Before St. Peter, so great and good,
In hopes the City of Peace to win,
Asked St. Peter to let them in.
The woman was little and lank and lean,
With a scraggy beardlet on her chin;
The man was short and thick and stout,
And his “tummy” was built so it rounded out.
His face was pleasant, and all the while
He wore an honest, genial smile;
The choir, in the distance, the echoes woke.
And the man kept still while the woman spoke
“Ah! Tfnt grandest, the Golden Gate,” said
“We two come hither beseeching thee
To let us ?nter the heavenly land
And play oiv harps with the angel band


“Of me, St. Peter, there is not a doubt;
There is nothing in Heaven to bar me out.
Fve been to the meetings three times a week.
And almost always I rise and speak.
“I’ve told the sinners about the day
When they would repent of their evil way;
I’ve told my neighbours, I’ve told them all.
About Adam and Eve in the Primal Fall.
“I’ve marked their faith in duty clear,
Laid out their plans for their whole career.
So, good St. Peter, you’ll plainly see
That the gate of Heaven is open to me.
“But my old man, I regret to say,
Hasn’t walked exactly in the narrow way;
He smokes and he swears, and grave faults he’s got
And I don’t know whether he’ll pass or not.
“He never would pray with honest vim,
Or go to revivals or join in a hymn;
So I had to leave him in sorrow there.
While I with the chosen united in prayer.
“He ate what the pantry chose to afford.
While I, in my purity, sang to the Lord,
And then if cucumbers were all that he got.
There’s a chance if he merited them or not.


“But, oh! St. Peter, I love him so.
To the pleasures of Heaven please let him go;
I’ve been enough of a saint. I’ve been.
Now won’t that atone —can t you let him in.
“By my grim gospel, I know this is so
That the unrepentant must fry below;
But isn’t there some way you can see
To let him in, who is so dear to me?
“ ’Tis a narrow gospel by which I pray,
But the chosen expect to find some way
Of coaxing or bribing or fooling you,
So their relations can amble through.
"And say, St. Peter, my sight is dimmed;
I don’t like the way your whiskers are trimmed
They are cut too narrow and outward tossed;
They would look far better cut straight across.
“Well, we must be going, our crowns to win;
So open, St. Peter, and we’ll pass in!
St. Peter stood still and stroked his stalt.
And, in spite of his office, he had to laugh.
Then said, with the fire gleam in his eye.
“Who’s ’tending this gate, you or 1.
And thus rose in his statute tall*
And pressed the button on the wall.


And said to the imp that answered the bell,
“Escort this woman down into H !”
1 he man stood still as a piece of stone,
And stood sadly, gloomily, there alone.
A lifelong-settled idea he had
That his wife was good and he was bad;
If she had to go to the regions dim,
There wasn t a ghost of a show for him.
Slowly he turned, by habit bent,
To follow the woman wherever she went.
St. Peter, standing on duty there,
Observed that the top of his head was bare!
And calling the gentleman back, he said,
Say, friend, how long have you been wed?”
Thirty years! with a weary sigh.
And then he thoughtfully added, “Why?”
St. Peter first looked up, then down,
Then raised his hand and scratched his crown;
Then, seeing a different thought to take,
Slowly half to himself he spake.
Thirty years, with that woman there;
No wonder the man hasn’t any hair.
Swearing is wicked and smoking’s not good;
He smoked and he swore —I should say he would


“Thirty years with a tongue so sharp.
Say, Angel Gabriel, bring him a harp—
A jewelled harp—with golden strings.
Good sir, pass in when the angel sings!”
Gabriel gave him a seat alone —
One with a cushion up near the throne.
“See that on the finest aroma he feeds;
He has had about all the hell he needs.
“It isn’t just the right thing to do,
To roast him on earth and the future, too.
They gave him a robe and glittering wings,
And a jewelled harp with golden strings.
And he said as he entered the realm day,
“Well, this beats cucumbers, any way !
And so the Scripture came to pass
“That the Last shall be first, and the first shall
Last!”
One swallow may not make a summer, but
I’ve seen a grasshopper make a spring.
Friends will be interested to know that I am

ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER
WRITTEN.
“Where can you buy a cap for your knee?
Or a key for the lock of your hair?
Or can your eyes be an academy
Just because your pupils are there?
“In the crowns of our heads, what gems are found?
Who travels along the bridge of your nose?
And does the calf in your leg get hungry at times
And devour the corn off your toes?
“Can the crook in your elbow be sent to gaol?
Where’s the shade from the palm of your hand?
How can you sharpen your shoulder blades?
What becomes of, your lap when you stand ?
“Whose fire do you light with the spark of your
eyes?
Who loops the loop in your ear?
Does the drum in your ear belong to a band?
What all this is about, I don’t seem to under-
stand!”
The definition of a sailor is a man who lives
on water, but doesn’t touch it on land.
The definition of a German is animal life
living on beer and sausage.


THE VAMPIRE.
(By Rudyard Kipling.)
A fool there was—
And he made his prayer.
Even as You and I.
To a rag and a bone,
And a hank of hair
(We called her the woman who did not care)
But the fool—
He called her his lady fair,
Even as You and I.
Oh! the years we waste,
And the tears we waste,
And the work of our head and hand,
Belong to the woman
(And now we know she could never know)
And did not understand.
A fool there was
And his goods he spent.
Even as You and I.
Honour and faith,
And sure intent
(And it wasn’t the least what the lady meant)
But the fool must follow
His natural bent.
Even as You and I


Oh! the toil we lost
And the spoil we lost,
And the excellent things we planned,
Belong to the woman
Who didn’t know why
(And now we know she never knew why)
And did not understand.
The fool was stripped
To his foolish pride.
Even as You and I.
Which she might have seen
When she threw him aside
(But it isn’t on record the lady tried).
So some of him lived,
But most of him died,
Even as You and I.
But it isn’t the shame.
And it isn’t the blame,
That stung like a white-hot brand.
In coming to know
That she never knew why
(Seeing at last, she could never know why)
And could never understand.
Moses: “Mine son is getting married.’’
Cohen: “Is he?’’
Moses: “No—l key!


CALF LOVE.
He met her in the paddock
As the sun was sinking low;
They strolled along together
In the twilight’s afterglow.
She waited, until patiently
He had lowered down the bars;
Her soft eyes bent towards him,
Just as radiant as the stars.
She didn’t smile or even thank him;
In fact, she knew not how,
For he, you see, was a farmer’s boy,
And she a Jersey cow!
“Jack, dear, supposing I was to die, what
would you do?’’
Jack: “I would go off my head, darling.”
Wife: “Would—would you get married
again?
Jack; “Oh! I don’t say I’d go off my head
altogether.”
Mr. Newlywed; “Did you sew that button
on my white trousers, darling?”
-Mrs. Newlywed: “No, love. I—l couldn’t
find the button, so I just sewed up the hole.
Was that right, dear?”


THE LUCK OF THE GAME.
’Twas up in the Gippsland region.
Me and me wife Sue.
We was working a few dozen acres.
And I never knew when we’d be through.
But, ah! one day came a stranger,
A traveller from the Lane, so they say;
And that night when I came home, sir,
She’d motored with the traveller away.
And now it’s in Melbourne I’m toiling.
Yet I start at the toot of a horn,
And I stand about in dread and in terror.
With a feeling so sad and forlorn.
When I hear the soft purr of a motor,
My heart, sir, just seems to crack.
Do I hope, some day, I will see her?
No, I’m afraid she’ll want to come back!
The greatest profession in the world to-day
is the barber’s, because he does his “head-work”

ONE OF THE BOYS.
It happened in New York before they dis-
covered “near-beer.”
A drunk stood in front of an hotel shouting
out. “Porter! Porter!”
Yes. sir; coming, sir,” answered the porter.
What—hie—hotel’s dis?” asked the drunk.
This is the Park Hotel, sir,” replied the
porter.
“Do I—hie—do I liv* here?” asked the
drunk.
What name, please?” asked the porter, as
he guided the drunk over to the booking office.
Smith—l’m Char—hie—lie Smith.”
So the porter looked up the ledger, and saw
where Mr. C. Smith occupied Room 645 (on
the sixth floor), and told the half-conscious
gentleman so.
Take—hie—take me up,” said the drunk,
and up they went.
About ten minutes afterwards another
“drunk” came along in front of the same hotel,
shouting, “Porter! Porter!”
“Yes, sir; coming, sir,” answered the porter.
“What’s—hie—-the name of this hotel?”
asked the drunk.
“Park Hotel, sir,” answered the porter.
‘Do I’s liv* here?” asked the drunk.


“What name, please?” queried the porter,
leading him inside.
Smith Charlie hie Smith.” So the
porter again looked up the ledger, and informed
Mr. Smith of Room 645, on the sixth floor.
“Tak—hie—me up!” And as they were
on their way to the lift, it suddenly dawned on
the brainless porter that he had taken a Mr.
Smith up to the same room only ten minutes
before, and told the drunk so.
’Twas me. I—hie—l fell out the bloom-
ing window!” said the drunk.
“No, dear; the peculiar odour one smells
around the post office hasn’t anything to do with
the dead letters!”
The more food goes up, the less it goes down !
Sweet Young Thing: “You’re rather bald,
aren’t you?” :
Second Childhood: “Yes, my dear. ; You
see, grass never grows on a business street, does
it?”
She; “No, that’s true. It can’t come through
the concrete!”


SHE RECOGNISED HIM BY HIS
CHILD.
An Italian, with his “organ-da-monk,” went
over to the aborigines’ camp one afternoon and
started playing that old favourite, “Yes, We
have No Pyjamas, when out came a few black
gins, and, after eyeing him suspiciously, one
asked him if he was married yet.
“No chanca!” replied the Dago, shaking his
head.
“You plurry liar!” answered the black gin,
floni him t 0 the monkey on the organ.
Where you gettum monkey flom, den?”
ANSWERS TO CO-RESPONDENTS,
“Yes, dear, the proper length of a young
lady s dress should be—a little over two feet.”
ROTTEN LUCK.
Her death was so sudden,
Her death was so sad.
She gave up her life—
Twas all that she had.
She now lies sweetly buried
B’neath a willow bough;
There s always something happening
When a train hits a cow!


KELLY’S DREAM.
(By J. W. Kelly.)
About a week ago I was invited
By an old-time friend of mine
To come up to his residence
And test his beer and wine.
We ate a lobster salad
And a lot of other truck.
And drank each other’s health
Until the hour of three had struck.
Well, we drank until we didn’t know
Which was wine or beer;
Till our heads felt rather heavy.
And our brains not very clear.
Well, I got me home—l don’t know how.
My prayers I think I said.
But, anyway, I was paralysed
When I got into bed.
Well, I died and went to Heaven;
I saw that repentance was now for me too
When suddenly I was ushered
late
Before the Golden Gate.
“Well, what will you have?” said Peter.
“Don’t you know you can’t come in,
For you must surely suffer
The greedy glutton’s sin!”


Then I turned aside and said no more
And hung my head in shame.
And Peter’s clerk stood close by
And wrote “Lost” against my name
Next came an Italian,
One whom I knew real well;
So I stopped and listened patiently
To the story he might tell.
Gooda Father Petro,
I comma to you at last;
My peanutta days are overa,
And my banana nights are passed.
<» T »
1 treata my neighbora hka myselfa,
No begga— no robba—no steal.
And nevera on the sidewalka
I throwa the banana peel.”
‘‘You get out!” said Peter;
Your gains were ill-gotten.
Your peanut shells were empty,
And your bananas ofttimes rotten!”
The Italian turned away,
And a tear was in his eye;
He came and stood behind me
And heaved a heavy sigh.


Next came an aged Hebrew,
With a satchel in his hand,
And before the Gate and old St. Peter
The “sheeny” took his stand.
“Ah, Father Pieter!
I vill tell you vat I vill do.
Hi haf got jewellery fit for angels,
Hi vill auction off to you.
“I could sell dem on the instalments plan,
But dat vould be a sin;
So hi vill give dem at you at half price,
If you vill only let me in.
■
“On earth I keept a clothes’ store,
My goots vere neat and strong;
And to show you hi had a overcoat,
Hi forgot to fetch it along.
“Then you did well, said Peter;
“For very well you know
There’ll be little use for overcoats
Where you will have to go!*’
So the Hebrew turned aside,
And as he was a friend of mine,
Just like me and the Dago,
He “sashayed” into line.


Next came an old maid—
One bound to have her say—
And she began addressing Peter
In this most peculiar way.
“Oh! Goodness gracious me! Here I am,
After gossipping many a year;
So open the gate and let me in,
As I will be catching cold out here.
Give me a first-class pair of wings,
A silver shield, and then
I won’t be afraid
Of the naughty, naughty men.”
“No,” Peter answered blandly,
“No angels have grey hair,
And you have no sons or daughters,
So you would be a stranger there.”
The poor old maid wilted.
She must ever more repine,
And just like me and all the rest,
She waddled into line.
Next came a German,
Now paralysed with fear,
Who on earth ofttimes paralysed
His customers with beer.


“Veil, Fadder Beter, I come to you.
Free from sin,
And I vill only ask you ein favour,
Dat is—lf you vill let me in 1
“Mein vife she runned avay from me.
To hide mein shame I cried.
So I vent down by the river
Und committed susan-cide!
“Then you begone!” said Peter,
“And suffer thy disgrace.
You came before I sent for you;
I cannot make a place.’
The German turned away and said,
“Oh Gott! Oh Mein!”
And, just like me and all the rest.
Took his place in line.
Next came poor Paddy,
A son of Erin’s Isle,
And greeted old St. Peter
With a very gracious smile.
“Ha! Ha! Sure, it’s yerself, St. Peter,
Looking so nice and swate;
So get your clerk to let me in
And show me to me sate.


“Hold!” cried Peter; “your case, like all the rest
Must first be tried.
You will have to show a passport
Before you can get inside.”
“But. hurry up,” cried Paddy,
“Or for supper I’ll be late,”
And purposely he took his old slouch hat
And threw it inside the gate.
“Go, get thy hat,” said Peter,
“Thou sacrilegious lout!”
So Paddy went in and slammed the gate
And locked old Peter out.
Then, through the keyhole, loud he cried,
“Tm master now, you see;
But I 11 give up Heaven, gate and crown
If ye’l! set Old Ireland free.”
I then awoke, and found my head
Between the bed and wall;
The sheets got tangled around my feet—
Twas that lobster did it all ?
We must always remember those who have
done us a favour—when we want another
favour done. >


WHY THEY CALL MEN 4 POOR FISH.”
“What bait do you use?” said the Saint to the Devil,
“When you fish where the souls of men abound?
“Well, for special tastes,” said the King of Evil,
Gold and fame are the best I have found.
“But, for common use?” said the Saint. “Ah!
then,”
Said the Devil, “I fish for man —not men,
And the thing I hate is to change my bait,
So I fish with a Woman the whole year round.”
Marriage without love is hateful,
Marriage without money is silly.
But marriage without love or money is dmky-di mad-
ness.
h Now let’s sing, “When my cross-eyed sweet-
J\ heart became my cock-eyed bride.”
The best man that ever lived
Must take his child on faith alone,
But the worst woman that ever lived
Knows her child’s her very own.
Women would be far more charming if a
man could fall into a woman’s arms without
falling into her hands.


WHAT HAPPENS TO US.
When the workmen own our workshops.
And the railwaymen the rails.
And the grocery assistants own the groceries.
And the postmen own the mails;
When the preachers own the pulpits,
And the cashiers own the shops,
And the coal-miners own the coal mines,
And the gaols are owned by “cops”;
When the conductors own our tram-cars,
And each driver owns a bus,
Will you ask the rest of the people
What the happens to us?
„ Our next songs will be:—“Girlie, Tie Up
Your Shoe-lace, Your Tongue’s Hanging Out,”
and “I’ve Got Enough Money to Last Me for
the Rest of My Days, Providing I Die To-
night.”
What always gets me is you hear of most of
the wise men still wearing ziffs—but so does a
cocoanut.
Men argue that women cannot be trusted too far
Women argue that men cannot be trusted too
near.

“THE LADIES.”
(An unpublished poem by Rudyard Kipling.)
Now, I’ve picked up my fun as Ive found it,
I’ve ranged and I ve roamed in my time;
I’ve had my choice of sweethearts,
And four of them were prime.
One was a half-caste widow,
One was a v/oman from Prone,
One was the wife of a friend of mine,
And one was a girl from Home.
Now, I never go ’nap on the ladies.
Because, taking them all the way long.
You never can tell til you ve tried them.
And the you are likely to go wrong.
There were times when I thought that I might have
There were times when I knew that I might.
But the more you mix with the yellow and brown
It will help you a heap with the white.
My first was a shy one from Oogli,
She was shy as a babe to begin;
But Aggie de Castra she made me.
And Aggie was as ugly as sin.


Older than me, but my first one,
More like a mother she were;
But she taught me the way to promotion and
And I learnt about women from her.
Then I went up to Burma,
Acting in charge of a bazaar.
And I got me a tiny little heathen
From buying supplies off her pa.
Funny and yellow and faithful,
A doll in the tea-cup she were;
We lived on the square, like a true married
And I learnt about women from her.
And then I was transferred to Neernah,
Or I might have been keeping her now,
And I got me a shiny she-devil—
The wife of a nigger at Mow.
She taught me the Gipsy folks’ boolee—
A kind of volcano she were.
Do you know, she tried to knife me one night.
Just because I wished she was white;
But I learnt about women from her.


Then I came home on a steamer,
Along with a kid of sixteen —
A girl from a convent in Mourat:
One of the straightest I’ve ever seen.
Love at first sight was her trouble;
She didn’t know what it were.
Well, I couldn’t do such, ’cause I loved her too much
But I learnt about women from her.
Now, I picked up my “fun” as I’ve found it,
And now I must pay for my “fun” (ziff!)
The more you mix with the many,
The less you will settle with one.
And in the end of it, sitting and thinking,
And dreaming of hell-fires to see,
So be warned of my lot—as I know you will not —
And-learn-about-women-f rom-me!
A married man’s best friend in this world is
his own wife’s husband.
A tipsy fellow knocked on the door of a
strange house.
Householder: “No, old chap, Im sorry I
can’t remember you—even though your breath
smells familiar!”


MAKES A MAN THINK—DOESN’T IT?
Two wise men by the wayside sat
And each bemoaned his lot.
One because he d just buried his wife,
And the other because he had not!
Many a man who finds his way to the mar-
riage altar would now like to find' a way to
alter his marriage!
Even the man who lives to a ripe old age is
still a bit green where a woman is concerned.
One wife may be a necessity, but another
man s wife is a luxury very few of us can resist.
Some people go to church and clasp their
hands so tightly that I’m blessed if they can get
them open when the old collection plate comes
round.
Girls, never let one leg know the other is
being pulled.
No, Willie, Adam was never a kid , so he
wasn’t exactly a goat, isn’t it?
The difference between a bachelor and a mar-
ried man is one has no button on his shirt, and
the other has the button, but no shirt to put it
on to.
In the good old days a man used to pack his
musket and powder and go hunting for deer(s).
Now it s the dears in packs with powder puffs
that go hunting for a man!


MR. BOOZE.
Many babies who are brought up on the
bottle are often brought down by it—after they
grow up!
There are heaps of women who find it quite
easy to say “No” to a man these days. Of
course it all depends on what he’s trying to sell!
“Do you know who was the first elec-
trician?”
“No, who?”
“Noah! Didn’t he make the Ark light on
Mount Ararat?”
Remember, girls any “sport in a storm.
It may take a mother twenty years to make
a man of her son, but it only takes another
woman twenty minutes to make a fool of him!
I told my girl the other night that I have
really only met two very beautiful women in all
my life, and she asked me who was the other one!
We are told that Orpheus walked into hell
to find his wife, but I know Oscars with cars
now who wouldn’t even ride into Heaven to
look for theirs!
A chip of the old block —sometimes turns out
a blooming blockhead!
Motor cars have got nothing on women when
it comes to running people down.


Boys, it s a stiff neck that has no turning—
when a good pair of knees goes by!
No, Bertie, all men who get married nowa-
days aren’t fools, y’know—some are merely
born unlucky, don’t yer know!
When Mr. Cupid aims straight for the heart
he usually Mrs. it!
Flattery is a sort of bad money to which
our own vanity gives currency.
Girls are wearing their skirts so short now
that a near-sighted friend of mine followed a
good sort down the street the other day, and it
turned out to be a Scotchman with kilts on!
