?RUNG OUT?
TOLD BY
AN AUSSIE OFFICER
OF THE GREAT WAR
(COPYRIGHT)


A UTTLE FOREWORD.
?Rung Out? hopes that his little War Stories will
be entertaining. He has tried to avoid the ?revolting?
and ?harrowing.? One story is sad?but too true.
Some attempt to depict conditions and the way things
were done near the front line during the Great War.
The fact of ?Rung Out? being an Infantryman gave
him many opportunities of realising the horror, filth
and pathos incidental to all wars, more so in this
Great War.
To paint realistically in words its episodes, one
misses the pen of a Zola, a Hugo, or a Hardy, or such
men. ?Rung Out? has done his best with truth and
sentiment. He aimed at naturalness, avoiding as far
as possible philosophical jargon or unnecessary display
of bibliography.
The few references to the French tend to show the
misery this dauntless race experienced.
What ?Rung Out? saw emphasised the dire import-
ance of being prepared for war and the ?common
sense? of carrying it on in the other fellow's country.
?Rung Out? trusts that any description herein will
cause no unnecessary sadness to the families of the
bereaved ones. If so, he asks them to remember that
it is better ?to die for Freedom than live in slavery.?
Such a determination was written on the escutcheons
of those Heroes who saved the Empire, by immortal-
ising themselves.

Little Jeanne
(My Rose of Picardy.)
Amiens, 1918.
?Ron, before you leave Paris, buy me a bangle for
a little girl friend of mine, who is about 10. I will
go up to 50 francs, Ron, old chap.?
?Aha! J , some little French kid, eh? Now,
isn?t she more than 10??
?Oh! Shut up! Just the kind of thing you would
say. Anyone can see you come from Melbourne.?
?Her name is Jeanne, and she is my sweet little
Rose of Picardy. I love her, Ron! And also bring
some soap, that scenty stuff, if you have room in your
old pack?five or six cakes. If you knew her, Ron,
I?ll bet you would stuff your pack with all kind of
good things for her and go short yourself. Poor little
kid! She lives with Her mother near the Amiens pic-
ture show, right on the railway line, too; a dangerous
possie, as Fritzy is always shelling and bombing the
line, and already there is a great big hole in the wall
of the picture show. I?ll tell you all about her, Ron.
You?ve got plenty of time. You mightn?t get a lorry
for an hour, and besides, you have got fourteen days.
That means three weeks. You are bound to be absent
without leave, and with your excuses you?ll bluff the
Heads. I know you, Ron!
?This is how I met her. We were on our way to-


wards Paris on a job for Divvy. Mac was sitting
alongside me in the front lorry. He said: 'There is
an old girl waving to us, sir/ 'Let us pull up and see
what she wants, Mac/ Could we call at Poity and
ask Madam for a couple of cases and bring them
back to her home, pointing to a two-storied house in a
small street a couple of hundred yards away?
" 'Delighted, Madam. We will bring the cases, if
possible, to-morrow morning as we return/
"Holding her hand was a little French girl about 10
years of age, poorly dressed ?all in black. One could
see that Fritzy was intensifying the struggle of their
meagre existence. The kiddy's name was Jeanne. She
just missed being pretty ?lanky, pallid, with strikingly
beautiful eyes ?violet?with a long face which showed
a soupcon of a smile as her mother introduced her to
us.
"The next morning we pulled up at little Jeanne?s
home. The mother and the two girls were expecting
us. We carried the cases inside, and Mama, who was
very grateful, insisted upon us having some coffee ?
'cafe noir??no milk, no sugar?none in Amiens then.
Between the intervals of sipping this offering, the
mother told us that their father had been killed near
Verdun early in the war, leaving her with a little home
to battle for the two children, Jeanne and Marcelle.
Apart from the blow, they were compelled to face
the terrors of the future. They had no relations near
them. The husband?s brother lived at Marseilles, some
hundreds of miles away, too far for them to reach


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 7
under war conditions. They could not leave Amiens,
as they had no place to go, and besides, what would
become of the furniture in their little home? You
know, Ron, that the population of Amiens decreased
every day, and at the moment there were less than
1500 people remaining in the city.?
I urged them to clear out. 'For God?s sake, clear
out! Look! Look at that gaping hole in the wall
of the cinema yonder ! Madam, you must leave. I
will take you to a safer place with some of your
belongings/
"She was undecided and looked distressed; would
let me know in a day or so, when they would like me
to move them.
"With tears in her eyes she said 'au revoir?, and
made the two girls shake by the hand 'Monsieur
Australien/
"I called every other day, leaving them condensed
milk, sugar and other rations to comfort them. One
bright, sunny day, owing to the delay caused by one
of the lorries, I wandered with little Jeanne to the
gardens near the river. She delighted to point out to
me the roses, now growing somewhat wildly?no at-
tendant there now to trim them. Still, they were
beautiful.
" 'Yes, they are roses of Picardy! Ah! Jeanne, you
are my little Rose of Picardy. But tell your mother
that I am going to move her and you two kids to-
morrow. I don?t like the look of things. See how
badly he bombed the station last night??


?Tremulously she admitted that, although it would
be hard to go away to 'somewhere/ which meant ?no-
where? to them, she would make her mother pack up.
Ihe sad little party agreed to be ready with their
packages for me to take 'somewhere along the road
towards Paris/
?But Destiny had planned things differently! God's
unseen providence?which men nickname 'Chance'?
decided for them.
?They put it off from day to day. This gave me
further opportunities of stealing an hour with my little
Jeanne among the roses of Picardy."
Ron returned to his Battalion strangely, only two
days late. He had brought the bangle, plain-gold,
ringed with blue enamel. Jeanne was delighted, and
her mother made her promise that she would not
remove it until she was a big girl.
My duties did not permit me to continue my happy
little visits to this forlorn home, but some three weeks
later, when visiting Amiens, Mac and I ran over to
see our friends.
Oh, God! The inevitable!
The square had been badly bombed. We stood in
front of No. 21, and were glad to think that they were
gone.
Alas! it was not so! Mac had climbed over the
debris?bricks, mortar, shingles, etc., and discovered
the body of my little friend, Jeanne. She had appar-
ently been dead four or five days. A little arm, its


flesh now showing death?s sickly pallor, was protrud-
ing from the shambles, still bearing my little keepsake.
I could not look at her!
It took me some weeks to forget this tragedy.
One evening I was invited by a Tommy Major to
visit a theatrical troupe which was giving a show to
his Battalion near Amiens. As I entered a long
wooden building I was met by the strains of the
stringed instruments playing ?Roses in Picardy.? I
was overwhelmed. Oh, God! what thoughts ran
through my brain. There was no ?joie? in the reper-
toire for me that night.
A few weeks afterwards my leave came along. I
spent four days in Paris before crossing the Channel.
Wandering one beautiful morning in the gardens of
the Tuilleries, I became interested in the French chil-
dren ensconced in their beautiful perambulators. In
one attractively draped was a little girl, dressed
with all the taste that Parisian finery could display,
healthy, with sparkling eyes, pretty smile.
?Whose child is this? What is her name??
? Jeanne ?but we call her Rose?
Jeanne! ?Rose! Oh, memory, what didst thou
bring to me! Oh, God! My dear little Rose of
Picardy! This is another little Rose in Paris ?
Jeanne! Rose!!
Life?s inequalities and injustices seemed still more
incomprehensible to me.
Perhaps my little Rose of Picardy was better off!


O. C. Beer
(Officer Commanding Beer.)
Amiens, 1918.
The 2nd Division, A.1.F., was billeted in and about
Amiens during middle Summer, 1918.
The weather was decidedly warm. One afternoon,
loud and sustained cheers could be heard issuing from
many buildings.
It was rumoured that the Divy was to be issued with
k ï¿½er pints daily; so many sous each pint?its
cost.
The period of this rest for the Divy?now greatly
thinned by casualties during the more recent fighting
was longer than usual, to last some weeks, provided
of course nothing seriously went wrong (always a pos-
sibility up at the front).
The lads had earned this rest if ever humans did,
and the heads agreed to try and obtain supplies of
beer, but only after weeks of seriously discussing pros
and cons of such a procedure?l mean ?godsend,? for
that?s how the boys put it.
I was dug in near (map ref. 62b Gl2 d 1.0.).
It was nine o?clock (2100 in military jargon). Mac
and myself were scheming how we could get hold of
a G.S. lorry to move the sundry paraphernalia of our
party, which consisted of 16 men, to Gappy, to be
nearer to the Division. To requisition a lorry during
rest seemed silly. We knew what Divy would say, so


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 11
we decided to take a loan of a couple of half-limbers
(loan meant pinching them for the time being) and
hitch up our own saddle neddies to do the pulling.
Bobby Burns was never more correct in his ?The
best laid schemes o' mice and men,? etc., than in this
instance.
Our honor was not forfeited but our whisky was.
Mac's old Scotch nut was working overtime to better
my schemes. That evening he brought some three or
four transport pals to my dugout. He treated them
well ?to my whisky. Momentarily I wondered at his
presumption, as Mac rarely presumed. I joined them
in their toasts, and learned with the ?Deoch and Doris?
that they were from the transport lines. I dropped to
his scheme. Surely 'twas better than an entry in his
paybook and a censure from Divy Headquarters for
me. Two bottles of Johnnie Dewar landed all the
party's equipment by a move that was made unosten-
tatiously, efficiently, and might I say almost
spiritually.
Let me tell you that I had guarded this whisky for
weeks and weeks, intending to invite a few brother
officers to a birthday dinner ?my birthday came along
all right, hut my health was drunk in beer, and not in
Johnny Dewar.
Late that evening, after having rather hurriedly ar-
ranged our homes, we determined to make the most of
our rest, and let Mills bombs, hand grenades, and other
deadly weapons rest in their possie till the Divy moved.
Where could we get a swim? Where was the jolly


old canteen? Where could one get a game of bridge?
etc. Common queries under the circumstances.
A runner! Ugh! What?s this about? ?A?? form.
Messages and signals.
To U. . 62b G 12 1.0.
?Report to Major W , D.H.Q.R., 2050 to-mor-
row. D Capt. per D.A.A.G.?
?I wonder what the H i s this, Mac ?We seem
popular with Divy. At any rate, there?s no swim for
me to-morrow morning. Divy must be 12 kilos away,
and I can t ask Betty (my dear old prad) to do twice
that distance and get back in time for a dip.?
Mac and I wondered and wondered what was in
the air. Are we out for a spell? We gave it up, he
mumbling philosophically ?C?est la guerre.?
After my early breakfast (special that morning)?
3 e ggs (2 frs. each) and a bit of bacon, and before 7
a.m?Betty was ambling me towards Allonville. On
arriving there, I found that Divisional Head Quarters
was occupying one of Hennessys Chateaux, this being
a beautifully old-fashioned one, with its huge barn
nearby. I proceeded to report to Major W . The
Major was in bed, and what a bed! Gorgeous, invit-
ing, and canopied?a la Louis Quinze. Hennessy
suiely left it especially for one of our most popular,
courteous and assiduous of officers on the Divy.
Later, in the ante-room of the D.A.A.G. office in
the front of the Chateau, I received my orders from
him, viz.; ?There? (placing six bundles on a table)


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 13
?are 50,000 frs. Take them! Sign for them! To-
morrow four large lorries will be in front of your
billet ?7 a.m. Take what men you like from your own
staff, proceed to any old place where beer can be ob-
tained, and return with sufficient beer for the Divy
(barely nine thousand strong at that time?ye gods!)
by four p.m. Wednesday, and report to me.?
He added that the Corps had decided to issue beer
to the troops every second day, till they moved up to
the front area.
?Yes, Major; but tell me where will I get the beer??
Oh! I dont? know?that's your job.? ?Where can I
go? Anywhere?? ?Yes, to Paris, London, or Heaven
if you like; but get the Beer.?
?You had better count this jolly cash, Mr.
?My God! It will take me all day, Major.? ?Yes, it
will; think you can take the risk ? It?s sure to be cor-
rect; it has just been issued by the Cashier to Divy,
and has been checked and weighed.? He added laugh-
ingly: ?You?ll have plenty of time to-night?
The plan was that I should pay for the beer and
and charge the men cost price, using the whole fifty
thousand frs., or any part thereof, as necessary, but
when the job was completed, I had to return the
50,000 frs. ?no more, no less. Where could I get
beer? Worry! Worry! Perhaps failure.
A few moments after I discovered myself in the
large courtyard of the Chateau. I stood, almost
oblivious to my surroundings, my brain was clouded
in a sort of miragal fear. It twinged, it burned aflame


14 LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES
in a quagmiral quandry; it cried aloud for Mac?
where s Mac ? Subconsciously it broke away from its
labyrinthine aberrations and mirrored Mac?s sphinx-
like face, which dispelled all worry instanter.
(Mac! Who was Mac?) Mac was my Sergeant,
born in Dumfries. Had spent six years in Australia,
and had joined the A.I.F. at the country?s first call,
and was twice wounded. To me, Mac was Scotland?s
greatest son; stolid, resourceful, and stood under all
occasions as staunchly as ever stood ?Craig Ellachie.?
?Mac will get you through.? He did!
Regaining my mental equilibrium I rode back. None
knew the wealth in the green knapsack strapped across
my shoulders; its potentiality! its errand! its laughter!
its song! its jokes! nor its heads!
?Woods! Have you fed Betty?? ?Yes, Sir!? The
pioneers will look after her till we return.? ?Right
oh! All aboard.?
The lorries passed through Amiens and down the
Grand Route de Paris for Beer, Beer?Glorious Beer.
I was Officer Commanding Beer. Great, wasn?t it ?
What did I know about Beer? Balliol sur Somme on
our right. ?No brewery there, Sir; only a Froggies?
canteen with its ?vin blank? stuff.? Go on! Go on!
The railway gates were shut through which we had
to pass to enter a town called Conty. The Poilu on
guard at the crossing informed us that there was a
brewery in the town, and it made good beer. Cheers!
Cheers! Go on again! ?Enfin nous avons une Bras-


serie. It was true! Dashing into the cellar, a ?No
Entrance? notice was marked over the door (never
respected at the front), and didn?t stop Mac. ?Plenty
Beer, Sir. Plenty!? Really, I believe had one closely
scrutinized Mac he would have discovered a slight sus-
picion of a smile on his face.
?Where?s the brewer?? A short, stout Richlieu-
bearded Frenchman appeared! We knew the meaning
of his gesticulations. His words were smothered by
our questions. ?How much beer can you give us? We
have four lorries.? ?Sorry, Monsieur! I sold it all to
the Blicks, and they will call for it to-day, sometime.?
Alas! alas! We were petrified, silent, immobile. No
Beer! All Sold!
Though silent and statuesque, Mac was unperturbed.
He was again scheming. We had to get beer by 4
p.m. . . . He whispered in my ear; ?The Blicks
moved last night up into the line, Sir, near ?Mont-
diddier,? and they don?t want any beer. Tell Monsieur
this, and ask him did they pay a deposit?? ?No, they
had paid no deposit,? answered Monsieur, and point-
ing with his finger, added that he had heard a terrible
bombardment towards ?Montdiddier? last night.
A bargain was struck. A receipt given for payment
of the beer and deposit on the casks, and as quickly as
the Frenchman marked in chalk the number of litres
contained in each cask on both bungs, did the willing
hands of the beer party dump the treasured liquid into
the awaiting lorries.


Ihere was no need to urge them on, no time for
them to sample its quality. ?Get the dashed stuff
aboard the lorries. Go like H , the Blicks may
come any old moment.?
As the chains of the backboards of the last lorry
rattled, I triumphantly bellowed out: ?Merci, Mon-
w U J' ~A U reV ï¿½ ir '? ? Merci - Beaucoup. See you
Wednesday.?
Goon! Goon! With throttles fully opened, our
little convoy of this Heaven-sent soother gave every
chance to the imprisoned contents of the barrels to
Wo [ k a head ? as the huge rough tyres of Daimler
and Thornycroft bounded, rattled and bumped over
the war-worn road on our return to Amiens, well
ahead of time; each member of the little party fully
satisfied that this kind of ?go-getting and damn the
consequences,? especially when the ?get? was Beer
was the way to win the War.
It was no concern of theirs to worry over the poor
1 ommy s disappointment. It was their job to get Beer
?for their Aussie brothers. Let the Blicks battle for
themselves. It was our duty to get the beer. Hadn?t
Divy told us to get it anywhere and anyhow, and de-
iver it at So and So by Such and Such an hour? We
were going to do it.
As dusk approached the Beer fatigue party were
fatigued (or pretended to be so), and were insistent
in their endeavours to persuade me to pull up the
convoy to permit of them resting their weary limbs.
That day they had worked hard, despite the fact that


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 17
it was only a battle for Beer. The day was warm, and
they were thirsty.
Next morning at n a.m., two days before our allot-
ted time, I reported to Major W? ?, of D.A.A.G.,
the result of our mission! He showed little surprise
at our promptness, and quietly informed me that the
Divy must have more Beer in two days' time.
The beer was issued to the various Battalion Quar-
ter Master stores paid for (at cost), 200 frs. being
charged as deposit on each cask, the amount the
Frenchman had insisted on me paying.
All went well in camp that night. It was alleged
that the ?Divy?s Beer Officer" was the smartest bloke
in the A.l.F.?knew his job?the beer wasn?t dear?
it was pretty good. This was borne out by the noise
of rolling empties in a few hours after delivery on the
French cobbles of Amiens backyards.
Divy was supplied with its quota of beer three times
a week. The cash had balanced regularly, but one
evening, after the fourth delivery, Mac?s face showed
concern. This was unusual, very unusual. Ihe cash
hadn?t balanced. Mac was some 2400 frs. short.
?Great Caesar! Short be damned. ... I collected
it myself. You counted all the returns. The deposits
paid for empty barrels were collected. It can? tbe
short." ?It is, Sir." ?How! Who? Perish the
thought! I was responsible, and had to return the
fifty thousand when all was over. Where is it?"
?I know, Sir! It?s those jolly deposits. They?ve put
one over us?given us more empty barrels than we


18 LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES
supplied?cash short 2400, equivalent of 12 casks.
They won?t get me again!? They didn?t! ?But what
about my 2400 frs.?? ?Leave it to me. Sir. I?ll get it
all right.? He did?in this way:
Amiens was deserted, as was its brewery. There
were hundreds of good casks lying in the cooperage of
this brewhouse, for Fritzy to burn or blow up. At the
very moment Fritzy was shelling the railway line and
its station.
The French Mission at Amiens informed Mac that
there was no reason why these casks should not be
used by the Army. C?est la Guerre!
Now! All was easy.
Once more the cash balanced.
The French brewer at Conty was agreeably sur-
prised to find some very good casks of another brand
among those returned by the Aussies. The Beer
Party Staff thereafter was punctilliously careful to see
that there were no ?rung-ins? in the casks returned to
It.
Everything was going swimmingly. Our journeys
every second day to Conty were quite enjoyable. The
fields on each side of the road appeared happy and
resplendent. In their midst was the harmony of the
colours of the poppies, and of cornflowers. The Frog-
gie Brewer was well satisfied with our purchases, and
each morning on our arrival supplied ?dejeuner a la
tourchette,? cooked by ?sa Femme? in the Dinkum
.rrench tasty way.


We were all very sorry to realise that our job was
nearing completion.
?The Division will move to the forward area on the
27th. No 1 Battalion to Glissy. No. 2to Tronville,
and so on.?
The final count of the cash was rather satisfactory,
showing a surplus of 217 frs., although Mac could
not balance. At any rate, it was not short. The
50,000 frs. were returned to Major W , who, on
being informed there was 217 frs. surplus, seemed un-
concerned, and suggested to blow it up at the Canteen
among the boys, adding: ?The job was done pretty
well.?
On being handed a receipt for 50,000 frs., I felt re-
lieved, and at least could say that my Digger Staff had
done their duty in this battle of Beer.
But there was a denouement : Three weeks after
the Divys return to the front area, I received ?A?
form M. & S., viz.:
?Lieutenant to report to Corps. A.I.F. Head-
quarters to Major D at once.?
?Mr. , Army complains that the Blicks Battalion
allege that you, being in charge of transport of
lorries on date at Conty, by means of subterfuge
and , did intimidate a French brewer named ,
and did cause him to deliver quantities of beer that
had been ordered and paid for by Blicks Battalion.
Examine this officer and forward report to Army
at Flcxicourt.


?What have you to say, Sir?? I explained at length
my action on that day, and added emphatically that
?I was ordered to get beer, anywhere, anyhow, and de-
liver it by 4 p.m. on a said day to my division. I did
what I was told, and I am prepared to swear that no
deposit was paid by the Blicks Battalion for the beer,
and contend that I was justified. I hope I will be
backed by Corps in this matter/?
?You mustn?t talk like that, Sir; there is no need to
talk of backing up or backing down to Corps.
?Report at once to your Battalion, Sir!
You will hear more of this later.?
I didn?t.


Retrospection
g AN AUSSIE OFFICER PRESSES
THE BELLS.
AMIENS, 1917.
There was a heavy rumble behind me along the
road. One sickly light peered weakly through the
gloom, and the big lorry came rolling past.
?Say, Dig.!? I yelled, ?going to Amiens ??
The lorry driver roared back a negative?he gave
his destination as some French village; but the pro-
nounciation had been so Anglicised and distorted by
tongues unused to the niceties of French, that it may
have been Chinese, for all I knew.
I trudged along, squelching through the slush and
clinging mud ?weary, sad, sore, and sorry. Lord, it
was cold! And dark as Erebus, too! The drizzling,
misty, monotonous rain added the final touch to make
dreariness and desolation complete.
Another rumble. Another lorry crawled by.
?Are you going to Amiens ?? The same old query.
?No.? The same old answer.
?Well, are you going anywhere near Cardonette ??
?Yes; I can dump you near it,? came back the
scarcely-hoped-for reply.
I slung my pack over the lorry and scrambled
aboard. She wheezed and rocked unsteadily along at
about five miles an hour.
About 2 a.m., at long last, we struck Cardonette.
Then, nearly frozen stiff, I started out to search for


22 LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES
some sort of a billet. The street was empty and for-
lorn. I knocked at a number of places, but the only
responses were snores or sleepy profanity from the
comfortable inmates. At last, near the church, I saw
a light. My luck was in. Four well-wrapped men
were playing poker. They welcomed me as a long-
lost brother, extending the hospitality, even so far as
to invite me to have a drink. I grabbed the bottle of
whisky which stood on the sideboard?or, rather, the
table ?well soiled with small hillocks of candle-grease.
A drink! It was always appreciated during the long
Winter on the Somme; but now I was just dying for
one. A drink, by God?yes. I tilted the bottle, full of
confidence. But, alas! it was dry as a desert?empty
as politicians? promises. The faint, fading smell
of whisky seemed to mock at my disappointment.
Anyway, the poker party was breaking up, and one
of my newly-found friends offered to show me a billet
near his old girl?s place. He led me to an old shed. I
threw my pack down, and was soon ready to sleep.
But I had apparently put my bedding on a heap of blue
metal. It was sharp and hard, and full of piercing
edges and points. I was too tired to care, and, des-
pite such discomfort, I was soon profoundly
slumbering.
Imagine my feelings when I awakened in the morn-
ing and realised that I had been sleeping in a much-
used fowl-house?and then I understood the portent of
what I had considered my blue-metal bed. Time ac-
counted for the hardness. The rafters were high above
my head. ?Foul? was right. I made a break for some-
where, anywhere, out of the way. ...


I picked up a train at St. Roche, near Amiens.
Arrived in Paris at 4 p.m. A French bath, a shave,
and a hearty dinner, and once again I felt fit to face
the Kaiser and the whole ?bloomin? German Army.?
London! I arrived there eventually after having
been battened down below in the Channel steamer, and
nearly suffocated by the foetid atmosphere. Although
I had but a small credit in my paybook, I determined
to do myself well. I instructed the taxi-driver to
take me to the ?Savoy.? I had not visited there for
twelve years; but its welcome atmosphere and luxuri-
ous comfort was deep-rooted in my memory.
?Soldiers Half-pay,? read a notice over the office,
but it was obvious that such an arrangement was not
altogether favoured by the management. They pre-
ferred patrons able to pay the full tariff rated by an
hotel of such standing. Hence the German-looking
clerk said, disinterestedly, ?Sorry, sir, we are full.?
I guessed the ruse.
?I must be put up,? I told him. ?I will pay the
full tariff. I know one of your directors, Lord D ;
he lives close by, Savoy Mansions, so ?
Either the mention of that name, or the promise to
pay the full charges, altered the demeanour of the
Teutonic clerk.
?The only room I can give you, sir, is the honey-
moon room, 16/- a day extra.?
With a jocular ?Right-oh,? my little bit of luggage
disappeared to join me again in the lift, soaring sky-
wards to the honeymoon room.
I dined with a few friends. Not so wisely, perhaps,
but very, very well!


Awakening in the morning at 9 o?clock, the sun was
casting its comforting glow into my room, and revealed
the true beauty of the wonderful mauve and straw-
coloured curtains that hung from the gorgeous
windows.
There was I, comfortably ensconced in a Louis
XIV. bed, caparisoned and canopied de luxe. A row of
electric bells caught my eye. Eight of them, marked
from the ?Managing Director? down to the ?Boots.?
There is ever a sort of fascination to press a bell;
a little effort brings lots of results ?like rubbing Alad-
din?s lamp. I couldn?t resist the temptation. I pressed
them all, twice over; some of them three times for
luck.
Talk about service! I had attention galore?waited
on hand and foot. It seemed impossible to believe that
a few hours before I had stretched in a wet blanket
on the floor of a French fowlhouse.
Ye gods! Cardonette! Will I ever forget thee?


Mules, Rum, Blowflies
FRANCE, 1917.
PART I.
About the end of the first week of January, 19x7,
the Battalion was preparing to move up from the sup-
port to the front line, distanced only some few yards
from Fritzy, who was just in the rear of the Butte of
Walencourt.
The Butte was a mound of hard clay, like a sugar-
loaf in form. It was a short distance from the town
of Le Sars, and was a relic of some religious rite of
the early days of the Celts. There are still many of
these mounds in widely distributed areas of France.
I was on the roll to move forward. Determined to
carry all possible accoutrements to help me to bear the
intense cold (a record for 18 years), which all France
was experiencing at that moment.
To my great surprise, I received an order from the
Adjutant to report to Major at Scotch Redoubt
Camp, some ten kilos behind the support line. Whether
on account of the abnormally severe conditions of the
weather, or the difficulty in moving troops over the
hard, slippery ground, the Fritzy was particularly
quiet, and, in consequence, I was not very windy before
trudging forward, when making the final examination
of the men of my platoon, their gas masks, rifles and
rubber Wellingtons, etc. The platoon was only 18
strong.
To be withdrawn at this moment would appear to
be a blessing in disguise?blessing! A paradoxical
word to use describing any episode in the front area


of this bloody holocaust. Still, it meant more com-
fortable quarters?more sleep?warmer rations. From
every point of view, this order should have been
obeyed with ?esprit dc corps.? I did not like leaving
the lads of my platoon at the eleventh hour?it did not
look well. I had to go.
I arrived at Scotch Redoubt Camp about 9 pip
emma, and immediately began searching for Major
?s quarters. Every Armstrong hut was occupied,
and nobody had heard of the Major or anything about
the fuss of stolen mules. Tired?cold?hungry, I got
into a hut with some Canadians, with feet almost
touching their brazier, whose embers were quickly
dying. I laid thinking a while of Courts, bombs, gas,
etc., while my chats did overtime work. I fell asleep,
to awake long ere morning, painfully cold, and re-
mained so till the light of dawn made itself apparent;
washed in water said to be warm; swallowed a sort of
breakfast, and continued my hunt for the Major and
his Court.
Yes! The Court was to sit at 9 a.m. to ?enquire
into the whereabouts of two mules alleged to have been
stolen from the transport lines of one of the English
Battalions by two A.I.F. privates, to wit, Digby and
Malone.*
It frequently happened when horses, mules were
killed in action, or escaped from the lines of the
Battalion or Artillery transport, their places were filled
easily and promptly by marauderers from other units,
in lieu of requisitioning animals from the general
depot near the Channel. The brands of the animals
were blotched out or rendered indistinguishable by


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 27
the thieves. In some few instances, mules were daubed
with some suitable colouring to hamper identification.
This game was too common.
The Tommies and Canadians said that it was ?Those
Diggers? who did the pinching. ?They would take
anything, those chaps.? On the other hand, the
Loggers contended that they never lost any mules or
horses, and had no need to do any pinching; ?they
had come over to fight, that?s all.?
Headquarters said these thefts must stop. Action
was taken, and Digby and Malone were up, and a
Court was sitting.
The Court consisted of Mr. President (the Major),
a Captain and three other officers.
It was elicited that one of the mules identified had
a white spot on his near hind leg?this animal was
found near Contalmaison in the A.I.F. lines.
Surely, Mr. President, the fact of the brand (South
American) tended to show that this animal belonged
to the Second County Battalion, and had been taken
by Digby and Malone, who were seen near the lines a
little before dark on the 10th May,? etc., etc.
The prisoners? friend, an officer nominated by the
prisoners to defend them, urged that the evidence of
the American brand had to be discounted, if not en-
tirely dismissed, as many S.A. mules were similarly
branded. He admitted that the white spot on the hock
might be used against them. ?But this, Mr. President,
is a concidence, and we will produce another mule
similarly marked.? This was done; case breaks down.
Not proven.


Still two mules short in the Tommy Transport lines.
None short in Diggers' lines.
Digby and Malone returned to their battalion. Great
rejoicing among their pals. ?Those bloomin? Tommies
tried to put one over the Diggers. They think us mugs
?cos we came from so far away. We don?t want to
shake their mules ?the asses should know that?we
wouldn?t.?
A few nights afterwards there was a rumpus in the
Belford lines. A reddish-looking mule had been taken
from them ?although a sentry patrolled that night
their al fresco stables.
?Those Digger coves at their old games again. I?ll
swear! But if we make a fuss they?ll coom and pinch
the dummed lot the next night. They say that those
Orstralians bee goo on ?orses. Ah, chuum! I know
they bee good on mules.?
PART 11.
The Court was over. I retraced my steps, flounder-
ing in the deep snow, and set off to join up my Bat-
talion in the line. I purposely failed to report to Bat-
talion Headquarters, but steered straight for my pla-
toon, saw Capt. at the Company Dugout, who
was surprised at my appearance, and said if I liked I
could do my bit by relieving ?Little Gcorgie? at mid-
night at Maxwell?s support, adding, ?It is not too quiet
a spot, as Fritzy is grenading and sending over pine-
apples.? ?Righto!?
The Company?s Headquarters was In a fairly large
well-timbered, erstwhile Hun dugout, at the foot of a


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 29
hill, with two entrances. On approaching it I noticed
curious swirls of steam issuing from its mouth, shaping
themselves like a gossamer blanket-man?s breath-
human exudations. It smelt foul, but what matter!
The dugout was warm and outside 29 degrees of frost
reigned a record. I went down below. My batman
put me through his ordeal. Had Imy revolver? Was
it loaded? Is your gas-mask all right, sir? Got enough
cigs. ? Will you have a fresh pair of socks, etc., etc.
I left the dugout, which was some 400 yards behind
the front trenches over the top of the hill. Four Dig-
gers accompanied me.
We were following stealthily a winding course, slip-
ping on the frozen ground, heading towards Fritzy.
The moon appeared bigger than we had ever seen it
before?cruel, callous, its brightness at the moment
most unwelcome. We were dressed in long white
overalls similar to those worn by chauffeurs, our tin
hats covered with chalk, all means to prevent Fritzy,
who was on our left on top of a mound which com-
manded our path, from spotting and firing at us.
Alas! Alas! Despite our camouflage, our shadows
caused by the moon were easily discerned, and as we
moved, so did the dark shadows on the snow-covered
ground.
Zip! Zip! Zip! Zip! Zip! A burst from his
Maxim?down on our stomachs, each man behind the
other in Chinese fashion; remained still for a few
moments, then up again and made a dash of six or
seven yards forward. Zip! Zip! Zip! Zip! Zip!
Zip! Down again. Finally, after receiving four or
five bursts, we jumped into the first trench of Max-


welFs support, panting, somewhat jumpy, but we had
dodged the Hun, for the nonce.
As I jumped, I landed almost on top of my little
Goulburn pal, Lt. Georgie , who encouraged me
by his laughter and jaunty manner. ?Well, J ,
what are you coming up here for? I thought you went
about those pinched mules ??
?I am to relieve you, Georgie !?
?Rats, rats! You can?t kill Huns, and besides, this
is the quietest spot in France.? Was it?
I took over from him. The post consisted of three
trenches in echelon now defended by one officer, one
sergeant, and 22 men, in distance less than 40 yards
When the moon went to sleep my little pal Georgie
returned to Headquarters, retracing his steps down
the hill from the enemy (whose voices could often be
heard), but this time no Zip! Zip! for him. It was
dark, and the Maxims were in consequence idle. Back
to the Company?s Headquarters ?to his pint of rum,
warm socks, cocoa, a little chat, a cig. and a snore ?
despite the foetid smell of the dugout. He had earned
this respite.
All quiet in Maxwell?s support ?till about 5 a.m.,
when, apparently at the bidding of the patrolling Fritzy
officer to his post, a whizz ?a scream: ?bang?a pine-
apple?more pineapples ?our issue totalled 17. The
last got into the rear trench which at the time I was
occupying. Ugh! Ugh! I heard its thunder. I saw
its burst, with its soft, beautiful opalescent sparks.
Could such a rainbow-coloured visitor accompany hor-
ror?death? I smelt its chemicals. ?I felt for its
quarry.


It was my second experience of casualties in the
line. Momentarily, I stood spellbound, and then rushed
to do what was possible. Stretcher-bearers! Stretcher-
bearers ! Five men of my little platoon were carried
to the ambulance post near Company's Headquarters,
two, I feared, ?to the far beyond," three to be patched
up and sent to the nearest casualty clearing station,
and, perhaps, Blighty.
Silence reigned in the trench for a long time. Our
rations were distributed, and all day long we almost
stagnated, occasionally moving up and down with our
heads well below the parapet (what there was of it)
to keep clear of the snipers' fire, making an effort to
ease our stiffened and jaded legs. The sun shone bril-
liantly all day long, but, as a Digger remarked, ?With
as much 'eat in it as in a candle." Tem-
perature 28 degrees of frost. Nineteen men?-all fed
up, wearily anticipating the hour of relief.
What again! A grenade?another?more?from
Fritzy just to show us that there was a war on. This
time he mixed them; we had more pineapples, but
only thirteen on this occasion. No casualties.
Fifty hours after my departure from the dugout, I
was relieved by another officer. I arrived at the dug-
out ?dead beat," depressed, frozen, with six days'
bristles on my face. I had eaten next to nothing for
hours, and noticed not the stuffy air of the dugout.
Down, down, in the direction of Hell to seek warmth,
food and sleep?
the innocent sleep,


32 LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES
Sleep that knits up the ravell?d sleeve of care,
The death of each day?s life, sore labour?s bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature?s second course,
Chief nourisher in life?s feast.?
Bell was there, my smiling batman, a great big-
hearted Englishman; he half-carried me to a wire
stretcher, mattressless, left by Fritzy some seven
months previously when hunted out by some Scotties.
He deftly removed my huge rubber boots, rubbed my
feet, pulled on warm socks, and holding a mess tin,
?Drink this, sir! It will do you good!? It was rum!
Good old Jamaica!
Let me tell you that while Bell was caring for me,
by candle-light (candles that were stuck to the wooden
walls by means of mud, producing more soot than
light), I remarked dozens of long, thin, dopy French
blowflies crawling on the timbered ceiling above my
head in a semi-comotose way. They had, as Winter
approached, sought the warmth of our dugout, imitat-
ing the ways of humans.
Blowflies! Blowflies! What a harvest the war was
for them. Men! Mules! Horses! Ugh! Ugh!
They had been feasting for months! Ugh! I loathed
them more than my assiduous companions who accom-
panied me everywhere, hidden in the secret recesses of
my clothing, where they lived their parasitical life?
disturbed only by an occasional scratch.
I grasped the pannikin of rum, that Heaven-sent
elixir. Poor old Bell had guarded this solace for hours,
having hidden it on a ledge of timber near the roof. I
was ready for my rum! Inadvertently I glanced at


the contents of the mug. Another ugh! There was no
cheerio! By the candle's sickly light I spied three or
four of these grey-bodied, blood-red-eyed, long French
blowflies struggling in the alcohol, climbing on one an-
other?s backs to dodge a spiritual death?exemplifying
by their action the Frenchman's ?Sauve qui peut."
I pushed away my pannikin, my stomach revolted
Bell, arching two or three of his fingers, lifted out the
blowflies from the pot.
Oh, sir, it doesn't matter! it's all right. Drink it!
Take it, sir, it'll warm you."
?No! No! No! No!"
Fie pressed me again and again!
?Oh! very well, sir. Cheerio!" And down went
my rum.
Bell liked rum?he didn't mind blowflies!


Lieutenant Tom
i AND HIS CASE OF WHISKY.
Albert, France, Jan., 1917.
(Ron Kept Some for him.)
One could not see the duck-boards; they were cov-
ered with snow, now hardened by the record freeze.
Dozens of wearied Diggers?well-wrapped?showing
humps on their backs?human Dromedaries?humps
of clothes, mufflers, water-bottles, etc., were leaving
the front line.
The crescent moon silhouetted strangely their
forms as they tramped back from the trenches which
overlooked the village of Le Sars.
The poor devils had spent nine freezing days and
nights doing their bit opposite Fritzy. At the moment,
the thought of the warmth of the Armstrong Huts was
comforting them. Lieutenant Tom was further
consoled by the knowledge that there was ?something?
extra for him at the Camp. He had gleaned (whether
by a premonition or a whisper from the ration party
was not known) that his usual monthly case of whisky
sent by good old Peter from Blighty had arrived at the
Quarter-Master's Stores.
It was whisky weather! No one would dare broach
this panacea till he arrived at the rest camp. Who,
who dare open it ? Ron! Ron would dare anything?
any man ?any woman. What! Whisky? Well!
Poor old Tom commanded the last platoon to leave
Fritzy's companionship. The others had arrived in
camp hours before.


Soon! Soon! But oh! How much farther ? The
slow, freezing tramp tramp seemed never-ending. But
?the warmth of the hut and some of Peter?s best!
Buck up! Oh! Buck up! Soon!!
Mr. Generosity is ever a much-appreciated gentle-
man in all climes ?but in the fighting area he pales
to insignificance alongside his rival, Mr. Initiative!
That night Mr. Initiative was active ?damned
active! Spoils to the victors! Yes. But get in first!
Four a.m. found old Tom?dead-licked moving into
the camp with his straggling platoon. Dumping every-
thing on the floor of the hut he cried out for Tidmarch
?his company?s Quarter-Master. Where?s Tidmarch ?
Where?s his case of whisky?
Ron, staggering from the rear of the hut, spluttered
out: ?It?s orite, Tom (hie) ?it?s arrived, and we?re
(hie) kept some for you? ?handing Tom a pannikin
with barely a nip in it. ?We thought (hie) of you,
Tom. We?ve all drunk S?Peter?s health three or four
times. S?now (hie) s?your turn. But, Tom, tell
S?Peter ?the old blighter (hie) ?to send three or four
cases next month! We all like it (hie), and so does
Ron (hie). ...?
Tom wolfed down his share, and to please Ron,
drank to Peter ?the only health he drank to ?that
morning. It was his ? Something ? from his case. His
share!
Tom always takes the Initiative now!


Trade in Scotch Porridge
(On Leave.)
FRANCE, 1918.
?Now! You are in Scotland. What will you take
for breakfast, old man??
?Give me something really Scotch, that's what I
would like, Peter."
Such was my reply to my Scotch friend as we were
crossing the last span of the Firth of Forth bridge
on our way from London to Dundee.
I was sitting in a comfortable restaurant carriage of
the Caledonian Express, ready for any kind of break-
fast.
? 'Tis ten years, Peter, since I was last in your
country. I can tell you truthfully it did not rain for
the three whole days I was there. I saw the sun
each day in the morning for half an hour. Now, give
me something Scotch?dinkum Scotch ?Scotch por-
ridge. In my country, as you know, Peter, although
we grow oats, the American stuff is always put in
front of us."
?Aye, laddie, ye'll get no American stuff on this
train. Waiter! bring Mr. some porridge and a
grilled herring for me."
The porridge was beautifully served and much
appreciated by me. When we had finished breakfast,
I asked the waiter the brand of the porridge.
?American rolled oats, Sir. Everybody likes it."
Oh! Oh!


I dare not put into print what my friend said in his
angry outburst. He bounded from his seat, and in a
high-pitched voice, ordered the waiter to bring the
packet. Strangely true, it displayed the name of a
well-known American firm. I chaffed him and
laughed.
?I can?t take it in, old man. Do you know, my
father is the Chairman of this Railway Company, and
has always insisted on British food being served at
meals. He idolised Joe Chamberlain and his high
tariffism, contending it would help the Scotch farmers,
etc., etc.
Peter was a scion of an old Scotch family which sold
Scotch in bottles, drank it from quarter casks; still
sells it, drinks it, and thrives on it. I continued to
smile half-heartedly at Peter?s discomfiture. Then by
soft words I tried to palliate the untoward happening,
but my attempt was obviously leading to
recriminations.
?Your domned country is the dumping-ground for
the debris from all European and American factories.?
A ?coup-de-grace? for me!
?But ye?ll change, laddie, and so will the brand of
the porridge when I see Dad? (looking at his watch)
?in half an hour on Dundee station.?
It was.


?Cidre?
(Cider.)
SUR-LE-SOMME, 1918.
?A note from a runner, Sir, from Battalion Head-
quarters.?
I had to report to my Colonel.
?Mr. , we are leaving ?Prische? on Saturday,
7.30 a.m., and the Battalion will arrive at Rene about
4 pip emma. You will go ahead and arrange billets
for all. You seem to ?compris? Patois better than
the Parisian accent, eh??
?Very well, Sir. Old Betty and I will do our best!?
Poor old Betty, twice shrapped, blind in one eye,
but loyal! Never known to act impetuously in any of
her physical movements. Still, every time got me
somewhere. Her great interest and affection for her
nosebag, though Fritzy bombed all around her, was
ever constant.
By 4-3ï¿½ on Friday, Betty and I were rather tired.
She had jogged me along some twenty-five kilometres.
I ferreted out the best billets available for the boys.
It was now up to me to get one for myself, not for-
getting Betty.
It was almost dusk when I spotted a barn, some
two or three hundred yards from the village, standing
back from the main road to Charleroi. It appealed
to me?its contentment, half-hidden in a cluster of
trees, all leafless, the thicker branches giving away
slightly to the weight of the little deposits of snow
caught by them. Behind the barn stood an old-
fashioned brick cottage.


On knocking I was received by a middle-aged
woman who, after my explaining the purport of my
errand, looked as cold as the blast of December?s
northerly wind.
?1 don?t understand, Monsieur. I cannot speak
English. I don?t understand.?
Summoning up my courage, I took her to the door
and showed her Betty. The spectacle of the quad-
ruped, as silhouetted by the dying sunlight, softened
not her antipathy to either of us.
Madame was seemingly more concerned in her
eagerness to close the door than to cater for our
needs.
I left the forlorn Betty to herself. ?C?est la Guerre.?
hollowing the old lady closely I gained a footing
in my new home, there to brave the lioness in her
den. Boldly I advanced towards her French stove,
almost falling into a box containing her youngest child.
??Box,? I call it, failing a better term. It was half
cot, half perambulator, yet looked cosy. I began
warming my finger-tips, and watched furtively the
sweet creature peel potatoes for the next day?s meal.
I had seized a post. In it I determined to entrench
myself.
There were two chairs in this kitchen-dining room.
One was supporting a bowl of apples, the other pac-
kets wrapped in soiled paper which externally pre-
sented the appearance of meat or some other viscous
substances. Subsequently, I discovered them to be
haricot beans and sundry damp articles of children?s
underwear.


I planked myself on the only available seat ?a tripod
stool?and stole what warmth I could from her un-
inviting provincial French stove.
Condemned! Despised! Forgotten! Appropriate
words; they fittingly portrayed her mood towards the
weather-beaten stranger.
Many contests have been won by ruse. Would
mine succeed?
I picked up the kid from its box, and in my best
Parisian French remarked, ?Quel joli enfant!?
That got her! Suddenly turning, she insisted on me
putting the child back into the box-cot-perambulator
contraption.
Ah, ah! She could speak French?she ?compreed?
that.
A little while afterwards she offered me a cup of
coffee. Did I take it ? Victory was mine! My first
French prisoner! A female?but forty-five!
Unfastening my knapsack I proceeded to ease the
inner man?s craving. She offered to ?rechauffe? my
'Fully beef,? and critically examined my ration bis-
cuits (ships).
An hour afterwards I was comfortably ensconced
in my sleeping bag on the floor of a room, which was
obviously the children?s quarter.
The next afternoon the Battalion marched into the
village. Apparently the billeting had once again been
passably well arranged. Few growls?little confusion.
The amity existing between the old girl and myself
was somewhat estranged when I landed two brother


LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES 41
officers on her to share her quarters, her cafe, and the
squeals of her three kids.
The march north into Germany (we understood that
the terms of the Armistice spelt a lengthy occupation
by the Aussie troops near Cologne) was slow.
The transport of rations, etc., became gradually
more difficult as we advanced. This resulted in a de-
lay for some twelve days. In the interim I had
thoroughly ingratiated myself with my commandeered
hostess.
She surprised me one night by asking me to have
?something? with her. What did she mean? Was
she leg-pulling? What was ?
Patois or Parisian, she knew the meaning of ?Oui,
Oui.? A minute or two afterwards she brought from
the rear of the house a bottle ?corked, labelless, well
and truly be-mudded. It was cider! Cider, in pretty
good condition, too.
Fritzy had occupied this area of Belgium for over
three years, and in his war-like style, had left the
peasants almost bereft of food, much less anything in
the form of alcohol ?mild or strong.
Where had she hidden this? How much did she
have left ? That was the question!
My brother officers were courteous and kind to *he
old girl, and made good by showing all sorts of atten-
tions to her children. The next night three bottles of
cider were produced. The bonhomie of my com-
panions was appropriately recognised.
I pressed her to reveal her cache, and for some time
she refused me. Following a present to her of a few


42 LITTLE JEANNE AND OTHER STORIES
cakes of perfumed soap (positively unobtainable owing
to the enemy commandeering all fatty substances)
which one of the Battalion officers had brought from
Paris, she let me into her ?grand secret.?
Immediately at the rear of the house, between it
and the barn, there were four or five flower-beds
whose boundaries were indicated by rows of bottles,
bottoms upwards, buried in the soil at an angle of
forty-five degrees. By this means she had success-
fully contrived to bluff the cunning of the ever-
searching Fritzy during the whole of his occupation.
He had seen the bottles, walked over them, kicked
them, but?mirabile dicu!?had not enjoyed their
contents.
Cider! Cider to tickle the throats and warm the
hearts of these modest Aussies survived Fritzy?s
commandeering.
You can readily imagine our disappointment when
I informed my pals that the old girl?s cider was all
gone!
?Found! Stolen! Drunk!
A Digger in his wandering was curious enough to
pull up and examine a bottle, likewise its contents.
The next day the gaping holes accounted for a
noisy but merry evening in the barn occupied by them
and the almost forgotten Betty.
The Battalion will move at 7.30 a.m.,
marching
Betty and myself once again to do the billet hunting
to-morrow to ?fresh woods and pastures new.?
Some Diggers say, ?There is a kick in cider.?
