One day their father sent them out
With parcels somewhat bulky,
Now John and Jane were often good
And made their parents glad, #
And Janie started with a pout,
And John looked very sulky.
But you will notice that they could
Sometimes be rather bad.

The night is dark, the Stores are shut,
The household sleeping lies,

And Dingo, too, is dozing, but
With wakeful ears and eyes

In form, and fur, and feature;
And this one was, we must <
A bad, dishonest creature.)

So stony still Dog Dingo keeps,
His breathing seems to stop;
While in a thieving Koala creeps,
Intent to rob the shop.
The Koala disentangles.
And hark! a sudden sound he hears
The window hasp is tried,
It opens gently, there appears
A furry head inside.
All round the wretch begins to prowl
To sniff or taste each thing.
But sudden, with a furious growl,
Dog Dingo makes his spring.
Then struggling both with all their strength,
All paws, and claws, and angles,
They fight and bite, until at length, M
The Koala disentangles.

Beyond he sees a door stand wide,
To gain it straight he dashes,
A treacle vat stands just inside,
And in, headlong, he splashes.
Aroused, the Hoppers hurried down
Or Dingo would have let him drown.

And now the twins make up their mind

This story really gives us pain,
But still we can’t couceal
That, like the Koala, John and Jane 1
Once did their best to steal. ?~r-'
They did their best, as days went past,
Their discontent to throttle,
But oh ! an order came at last
To send away the bottle.
There was a bottle filled complete
With peardrops to the top,
And of that special kind of sweet,
No others in the shop.
J pP ■ \
Then Jane and John began to tease,
They longed to taste them so;
Their father said, “Take what you please,
But not the peardrops, no.”
And Jane —what would her mother say?
While Dingo licks the peardrops up,
The twins on bread and water sup.

Then Dingo lifts a frowning face,
And gives a warning yelp,
But still he follows just in case
They may require his help.

Oh! foolish little Kangaroos
’Tis really most improper,
You should for your amusement choose
The pipe of Mr Hopper.
John, “ Papa just loves to smoke.
We ought to try it too.”

joke ! ”
A.
The twins start smoking, as you see,
Sa} r s John, “Delicious, this!”
Jemima, with a large fusee,
Is simply full of bliss.
But soon their talk and laughter fail,
And Dingo, at them peeping,
Perceives the twins turn deadly pale,
And hears Jemima weeping.
Away to fetch Mamma he goes,
And shortly in their beds
Three bad young Kangaroos repose
With sadly aching heads
But Dingo does not mock them, no,
Nor even say, “ I told you so.”
