A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES


1844 - 1944
In spacious well kept grounds, erected on an
eminence overlooking the city, the Goulburn Hospital
is ideally situated, favoured by a bracing and healthy
climate.
Here is a picture of the building in 1884, and
comparison with the existing institution shown below,
which houses a community averaging 220 people,
illustrates the remarkable growth in hospital accom-
modation.


GOULBURN DISTRICT HOSPITAL
IF
imX. or more than a century the Goulburn District Hospital has rendered magnificent service
to sick people from the wide area in the centre of which it stands.
Since the year 1842, when only 38 patients were treated during the twelve months, the
institution has continuously expanded in keeping with the demand for hospital accommodation,
until the present daily average of nearly 150 once again taxes its capacity.
The main section of the present buildings, providing for 24 patients and a staff of 18, was
erected in 1887. Additions since then include an infectious block, private wards accommodating
48 patients, operating theatre, X-ray room, domestic buildings.
An annexe built in 1940 to provide for soldiers from nearby camps, no longer needed for


that purpose, was this year converted and is being used as an emergency obstetric ward, pending
the construction of a new maternity block.
Self-contained, and providing for the treatment of 30 little patients, a new children’s ward,
complete with every modern convenience, beautifully furnished and decorated was opened on
12th December, 1943, to be rapidly followed by the construction of a kiosk, managed by the
Ladies’ Auxiliary.
The hospital has grown with the needs of the district, until it now contains 195 beds or cots,
which demand the constant attention of a nursing staff numbering 70. Annual expenditure
totals £30,000, and the buildings and plant are valued at £lOO,OOO.
Providing comfortable quarters for the nursing staff, two modern homes have been erected,
the “ Springfield ” in 1928 and the “ Lady Grose ” in 1939, each accommodating 30.
A tribute to the splendid type of girls who have embraced the nursing profession at the
Goulburn District Hospital, and the excellent tuition received from Matrons, Hon. Medical
Officers and the senior nursing staff, is their fine examination record. During the past 20 years,
not one of nearly 200 who sat for their final examination failed to pass.
Great praise in this regard is undoubtedly due to Matrons Uhr, Mann and Stevenson, who
have during the past 25 years controlled the nursing staff. Matron Stevenson has completed
23 years’ service at the institution. Devoting her life to the work, the hospital has reached


such a high standard of efficiency that it is recognised throughout the State as a most successful
training centre. This is facilitated by the wide and general nature of the work undertaken by
the Hon. Medical Staff.
Hospital staff and patients alike owe a deep debt of gratitude to those gentlemen, including
the late Doctors A. P. Gillespie, S. P. Lyttle, and R. 0. Williams ; G. A. Buchanan, now in Sydney,
and the present panel, H. Roger Cope, R. G. Woods, J. H. Coles, G. H. Kennett, F, Justin
McCarthy, B. Aileen Mitchell, J. P. Lyttle and A. H. Crowley.
The first Resident Medical Officer and also a salaried secretary were appointed in 1909, the
latter position being filled for the past 23 years by Mr. F. Jennings, affectionately known to the
nursing staff as “ Pop.” He is still at the helm, and together with Matron Stevenson, in
co-operation with the Board, controls a large and happy family, whose ministrations leave
nothing to be desired.
Very soon the institution will undoubtedly be established as a base hospital, with the
consequent further extension of its buildings, equipment and staff to meet the ever increasing
call for treatment.
Many directors have unselfishly devoted both time and energy towards the progress and
welfare of the hospital during the past century, and Presidents who played their parts in recent
years include Archdeacon Ward, Andrew Mclntosh, Robert Lansdown and Fred Davies.
