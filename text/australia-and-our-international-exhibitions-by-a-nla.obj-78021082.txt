SIR DANIEL COOPER, BARONET;
A NOBLE EXAMPLE OF
COLONIAL ENTERPRISE, INTELLIGENCE, HONOUR,
AND PROSPERITY,
THIS POEM IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED

thirty years ago.

PREFACE
The continued prosperity of Australia*?notwithstanding the present
temporary depression in trade and distress among labourers may be
attributed in no small degree to the fortunate and fruitful fact that
English Colonies are, for the most part, free from that Imperial or
Satanic influence which has been the curse of the Mother Country
since the year 1874.
From that period to the present, not only everything dependent on
the noble example of justice, honour, and morality in high places has
remained dormant, but every humble or lofty effort on the part of
zealous labourers for the National weal has either been privately slain
or publicly paralyzed.
How paralyzed, and by whom ? By the baneful action of English
knaves and dupes. By the former, in their venal readiness to aid
any vicious policy abroad or retrograde movement at home ; and by
the latter, in their blind or favour-seeking support of a self-exalted and
godless Dictator, and onef of the greatest enemies of a Christian country
that ever appeared in human form.
Explanatory Note. ?The author?s aim in the subjoined poem has
been a suitable illustration of International events ?past and prospec-
tive ?rather than a composition of poetic grandeur.
* Her great Institutions are in a highly prosperous state, and the Bank of New South
Wales, of which Sir Daniel Cooper is a Director, is one of the richest and most successful
banks in the world.

?Twas in the Princely*
When Art her peaceful
A Crystal Palace, filled
year of fifty-one,
victory had won,
with treasures rare,
Was fashioned by the world into a ? fair! ?
Ambition here, by master-minds inspired,
Onward to future eminence aspired,
Prompted by England, as the pioneer
Of zeal in other nations, far and near.
Twin star of joy at this auspicious hour, ?
A Queenly magnet 2 of surpassing power,
Revealed an offspring destined for renown,
As England?s converse jewel in her Crown :
Eleven brief summers from the date of birth,
This native child of our prolific Earth
Presented to Britannia?s second ? show v
The key 3 to land where boundless riches flow
The late Prince Consort was the chief promoter of the Exhibition,
2 The Gold Fields of Victoria,
3 A model ?pyramid,? in the Exhibition of 1862, representing the quantity of Gold
exported from Australia since its discovery in the year 1851.


With natural resources far and wide,
And growing colonies on every side,
Great Britain, without envy, may regard
All who obtain and merit their reward :
A Christian Kingdom, jealous of its name,
Scorning the path of selfishness and shame,
Should e?er be just and generous of praise
To those who?d nobly follow in its ways.
One nation 4 , proud of undivided force,
Another 5 , potent on each changing course,
While Austria, farthest of the foreign band,
Kindled laudations loud from land to land :
Each in its International display,
The patron power for merit of the day,
Awarded rank the bearers still retain,
As marks in trade more durable than gain.
As mighty things from little ones proceed,
A type of greatness in the smallest seed
May point to power when patriarchs retire,
And sons of the great grow greater than their sire
Empires, like men, have all their junior stage,
And ere on stately duties they engage,
Each must display in learning and in art,
The vital features of some noble part.
4 The United States of America.
a France under various forms of Government.


Through tracts of hidden wealth since time began.
This world, created for the good of man,
Hath ever opened out in virgin space,
New founts of honour for the human race :
While rotten realms, designed for birds of prey,
By natural extinction pass away,
United branches 6 of the great expand,
To fill and fertilize each distant land.
VII.
? Dark Continents,? with glorious- works in store,
For Freedom?s future heroes to explore,
Will ever-and anon disclose, when due,
A brilliant course for Wisdom to pursue:
Just to the pagan, pity for his state,
Man should improve, not pilfer his estate,
That Christian generations, yet unborn,
May view the past with pride, unmixed with scorn.
VIII.
Let students tell on the historic page,
How Australasia, in the present age,
Did suddenly in virgin robes arise,
To dazzle and delight her parent?s eyes ;
How?civilized?she grew from hour to hour,
Into a great and still extending power ;
How rich possessions in a triple line 7 ,
Will follow in succession to the end of time.

IX.
Britannia?s loyal sons across the seas,
Proud of their home at the Antipodes,
Have called aloud, and have not called in vain,
On senior states that would their fame maintain,
To render from each highly honoured mart,
A kindred tribute to Colonial Art :
That one and all may visit and behold
New works of merit in a land of gold.
When heirs obtain, as seasons onward roll,
Freedom from future guidance or control,
Colonial saplings into kingdoms grown,
Will honour claim to Rulers of their own :
Nature?s revolving world and daily nurse
May all things, in the flight of time, reverse
England will then salute, with parent pride,
A new Great Britain on the other side.
Hail ! thriving regions of the southern shore,
With undeveloped riches yet in store !
No vine of merit, potent at the root,
E?er failed, in time, to yield abundant fruit:
When Cook, the patriot, brave in word and deed
Espied the opening for thy future seed,
Sad was the issue of the heathen strife,
That robbed the world of his exalted life.


Honour the name of the undying dead,
Whose spirit smiling at the fountain head
In Sydney ?chief of the Pacific Sea?
Will e?er survive, in fame, to honour thee !
A record of the past in all things pure,
For countless generations will endure !
And in the future, from this date 8 will shine
Thy ? International ? of ?seventy-nine !
Postcript. ?The success of the Exhibition is now assured beyond the
shadow of a doubt: and the individual labours of the worthy Baronet to
whom the foregoing poem is inscribed, have tended in a great measure to
insure the certainty of a favourable issue. While he undertook to promote
the European part of the project, his own hands, aided by a few others, have
given practical effect to his resolve. On this account, the colony of New
South Wales owes a lasting debt of gratitude to one of her own sons, whose
voluntary labours will contribute in no small degree to the cultivation of the
Arts and Sciences among the rising generation of his native land.
8 From the opening day.
