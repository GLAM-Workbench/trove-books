AN HEROIC EPISTLE,
JrROM GEORGE fcARRINGTOM, ESQ. TO MAJOR SEMfPLE,
Oa his Sentence of Transportation to the Coaft of New South Wales.
THOUGH that imperious mandate wrings my heart, ( a )
Which dooms my liberal Semple to depart,
I mock the power whole penal purport fails,
And yield thee, half confol?d, to New South Wales!
The barque flow drops adown the bufy tide,
Where London?s for trefs frowns, in ancient pride, (�)
Onwhofe foul deck, amid a ruffian band,
Fate and his fetters bid my Semple ftand;
That band who, palling where, with oozy wave.
Old Thames the pitch-fraught Wapping (c) deigns to lave,
With execrations drink the frowfy air,
Which curls the tatter?d banners of Rag Fair,
Where Jew-receivers batten on their fpoils, (</) -�
And mock, fecure, their ill-requited toils. (*)
While'thus, methinks, I mark thy manly rage,
Brand, with dilhonour due, this thanklefs age
? Farewel the fog this hated clime exhales!
And welcome, doubly welcome, New South Wales?
Shall talents, vafl: as mine, lhall fldll profound,
Whofe fame, untir?d, hath meafur?d Europe round,
Cramp?d by conflruriions, fall, a fatal prey,
To dull decifions, and a difmal day ?
No ! be my daily meal a few dry?d filh,
The hardy native of Kamfchatka?s dilh!
Or let me furnifli out one flender fea�
To fome New Zealand king?s luxurious guefl;
Rather than bind my ariive fpirit down,
In torpid fetters, to this hated town !?
Difcretion frames the wifh; ?thy Ready mind
Views, with due fcorn, the world thou leav?fl behind.
Ev?n I?perhaps condemn?d to fall unknown?
No more my wonted Ikill or courage own,
IMITATIONS.

?Mid nightly fires no more I dare to prowl, (/)
And falling houfes now affright my foul*.
Oft as my fancy?s nobler flights attend,
O?er half the world?s great ball, my exil?d friend,
She loves, with bold prophetic ken, to foar
?Mid the dim wonders of the deftin?d fhore ;
To rend the myftic veil of years away,
And bare the future glories of the Bay ?
That Bay where now, methinks, at anchor ride
A mighty nation?s bulwark, wealth, and pride ??
That Bay round which the prophet?s eye defer its.
In cumbrous pomp, a fecond London rife.
Fir?d with the thought, I feel my foul dilate,
Plalf-doom?d to envy ev?n my Semple?s fate !
Pernicious thought! for, as it warms my heart,
I feel my fam?d dexterity depart;
I court dete&ion by a bungling hit??
Theme of the vulgar Knuckler's vulgar wit.
Yet who can mark, unmov?d, thy rifing fame.
Perchance the founder of a princely name ;
See future Semples vie with Howards now.
While confcious family erefts their brow ;
Norwifh (though not unknown to fame) to join
His humbler fate to fuch a fate as thine.
What! vie with Howards ? Yes, illuftrious crew {
As Howards now delight to vie with you ;
Holding that confcious good, to be a lord ? (g)
lake kindred virtues?its own beft reward.
Sure as, with flubbed locks and fable hofe,
Great dukes and earls on vulgar wits impofe.
And laugh to mark the ftranger?s timid eye.
Who holds his pockets as they pafs him by �
So fure thv fons, in future times, fhall be
Boaftful of blood, tho? carelefs of degree.
Stiff with a ftatefman, with a cobler drunk.
Rude to a duchefs, pliant to a punk ;
Short, blunt, uncouth, fliall decent forms forfwear,
And wear their manners?as they wear their hair;
With Roman pride, their outlaw?d fires confefs.
In all the quaint uncomelinefs of drefs.
Some native ruler, driven to a nook,
Shall fcorn a pedigree from King or Cook ;

Shall boaft old blood, tho? flowing from a fire,
Who broil?d a Boatfwain at a brufhwood fire*.
Yet fhall his pride engender many a good,
Wealth to the labourer, to the helplefs food;
Big Hofpitality fhall own his call,
And deck, with giant hand, his cheery hall ;
Hurl from its half-worn hinge the mafly gate.
Sit in the liberal porch, and fmile in Hate ;
Whom oft?, perchance, the comic mufe fhall aid
To woo the wonder of the village maid;
Genius fhall then, who here delights to wear
The form of Harry Bunbury, turn player ;
Wit, beauty, worth, expand their various pow?rs.
And a new Winjiay rear its honor?d bow?rs.
Deep-thinking moralifts fhall then, as now.
With caufe and confequence, contrail their brow,
And to a demonflration wifely prove,
When precepts fail, that great examples move.
Sages profound! o?er you a king fhall reign,
In virtues richer?than in rich domain;
Whofe faultlefs life fhall fearching fpleen defy,
And give Detraftion?s venom?d tongue the lye.
While,'at his palace gates, fome frugal peer,
In modern flyle, a Faro Bank fhall rear;
For there, as here, fhall gambling level ail,
And Prince and Scamp purfue the thrifty call.
Some Bufo then, whom vice and want fhall aid
To fhun the meanne/s of an honeft trade?
Who fold a faufage, or who black?d a fhoe?
Shall gain a regal fortune in Peru ;
When, objeil fad of Rapine?s pitijefs vow!
Peru fhall be, what Indoftan is now.
Return?d?This man of wealth his wealth fliall fliower,
To gain his foie remaining object, power.
And, fcorning modes by which poor patriots cozen,
Shall purchafe boroughs?by the baker's dozen.
Now fliall he throw, at modifh clubs, the main,
Nor duke nor earl th? uhequal fet difdain;
Till griping avarice, and the love of play,
Stretch o?er his flavifh heart their filler fvvay;
While the day waftes in calculations deep,
And the fell Club invades the hours of fleep.
There, as he prowls for prey, fome royal youth?
A dupe, through honour, and difarm?d by truth?

THE FORCE OF NATURE.
AN elderly French lady, retired to a country feat, had only one
child, a fon, who was a handfome young man, but a game'
der and a debauchee. Deditute, at length, of other means to live,
he aflbeiated with a drolling company of comedians; who, as it hap-
pened, palled a fliort time at Worceder, near which town was the
old lady?s refidence. After fudaining a few characters, the young
actor was difeovered, and the circumdance imparted to the mother.
Though highly difpleafed with her fon, (he could not refid a wifi]
to fee him, and for this purpofe went incog to the theatre. The
Gameder was the play, and the young man filled the principal part.
During the recital of thofe paflages, which bore a refemblance tc

Henry Fielding and bis Works, fays he was the inventor of that cant phrafe, good,
nefs of heart. One Ihould be induced to wonder that any man, profclling himfelf i
Chriftian, Ihould dare to treat that attribute as cant, whofe fpirit the facrcd volumes,
which form the foundation of our faith, breathe in every line, and which the
Jioly Author of that faith never ceafed to inculcate by example, as well as pre-
cept ; from which, in Ihort, we claim our grand fuperiority over the Pagan fy
fiems?if we could not difeover his motives. But the fecrct comes out: This Editor
has alferted that the novel of Tom Jones teaches virtue upon principle to be impof-
tore. Is this true ? Is Alworthy held forth as an impoftor ? A man mull feel him-
fc-lf fore from the juft indignation which is levelled againft the miferable pretenfions ol
