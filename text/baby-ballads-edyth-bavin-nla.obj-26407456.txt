I’LL BE A CAPTAIN
/ \
I — ( \ -A. i
HEN I’m on the sands at play,
I watch the ships across the bay,
Starting out so clean and bright
To sail the sea all through the night;
To sail across the ocean blue,
I think I’d like that, wouldn’t you?
Oh, when I’m grown a man I’ll be
The captain of a
ship at sea

BLUEBELL
KNOW a tiny tot of two,
With cherry lips and eyes so blue,
With dimples here and dimples there,
And sunbeams playing in her hair.
When she was born the fairies came
And brought her Bluebell for her name,
Which wdl becomes this tot of two,
With cherry lips and eyes of blue.

IN THE SUN
URSE said, “Now, just stay there
awhile,
I shan’t be very long,”
And I was starting to obey,
When everything went wrong;
A little breeze blew in and said,
“Please do come out and play.
You’ve been in here for hours, and,
It’s such a lovely day.”
I didn’t mean to disobey,
But, oh, it was such fun
To run out with that little breeze,
And play games in the sun.

MILLICENT MAY
TINY wee field-mouse,
Called Millicent May,
Had such an adventure
One bright summer
day.
While mother was busily
Sweeping the floor,
Millicent naughtily
Opened the door.
“How lovely,” she sighed,
To be out in the sun.”
No sooner she thought it
Than, 10, it was done!
She put on her bonnet,
Crept out on tip-toe,
When hark, from a tree
A voice laughed, “Ho, ho, ho!”
Poor Millicent shuddered,
A jackass she knew,
Was waiting to grab her;
Oh, what should she do?
looked at the monster.
Pretending to sleep,
While she crept through the grass,
Trying hard not to weep.
When all of a sudden
She heard a voice say,
“Where are you, where are you,
My Millicent May?”
“I’ll pounce now,” laughed Jackie,
But just as he tried,
Her mother espied her,
And dragged her inside.
Away flew the Jackass,
High up in a tree,
Where he stayed all the morning,
As cross as could be!


GRANDMAMMA
TOOK my Grannie for a walk,
And very hard we both did talk;
She ’splainedso many things to me
(I wish I were as wise as she).
Her hand is very soft to hold,
And though she is so very old,
She always likes to take a walk,
And doesn’t mind how much I talk!
MR. CROW
R. CROW, why do you caw
Right beside the nursery door,
And wake me up before it’s light:
At least, before the sun is bright?
I do not like your voice at all —
Other birds have nicer call;
So please don’t wake me any more,
Cawing by the nursery door.

BABY SISTER
AST night when I was fast asleep,
The fairies came with silent creep,
And brought a little sister.
“ I’m sure I heard them laugh with glee
To think of how surprised we’d be;
And then I think they kissed her,
For there’s a dimple in her chin
To hold the fairy kisses in.
Page Six


I WISH I WERE YOU
H, dear little bird,
As you fly ’cross the sky,
I watch you and envy you
Soaring on high.
I wish I had wings
And could fly with you too.
Oh, dear little birdie,
I wish I were you.
Page Seven


SECRETS
HEN nursie goes out, the fairies
come in
To the nurs’ry to talk to me;
They speak very soft, most awfully soft,
For fear she should hear them, you see.
They tell me why pussy-cats see in the dark,
Why puppy-dogs bark at the moon,
Page Eight
And how little blackbirds get into
a pie,
And a dish runs away with
*
spoon.
For nurse doesn't know that
Fm not asleep,
When she is downstairs after tea,
And, of course, she can’t guess that the
fairies come in
To tell all their secrets to me.


IN THE COUNTRY
HE cows walk leisurely along,
The birdies sing a little song,
The lambkins eat the meadow grass,
And stare at people as they pass.
I do not wish to go to town
Where people hurry up and down,
Fd rather in the country play,
For there Fm happy all the day.
Page Nine


B ONDER where the fairies live,
I wonder what they do,
I wonder what they think about,
I cannot tell, can you?
The fairies live in every flower
That in a garden grows,
From the tall and stately lily
To the tiniest bahy rose.
They keep the garden sweet and fresh,
They bathe the flowers in dew,
And while they work they sweet dreams
To send dear one to you.
Page Ten


WHO ARE
YOU?
LITTLE hird to my window flew,
’Twas opened wide;
That I could see his wond’ring eye,
His quiv’ring wing.
And there he sat and look’d all
round,
He look’d at me, as if to say,
“And who are you?”
Then hopp’d inside.
Then hopp’d up on the window sill
still as I watch’d him there —
The pretty thing,
And off he flew!

GOOD-BYE TO THE OCEAN
OODBYE lovely ocean I’m going
back to town,
Goodbye pretty seagulls, good-
bye.
No more can I paddle and play on the beach,
Nor climb to the lighthouse so high.
Goodbye little swimming pool, cool and so
clear,
Goodbye little path by the sea.
Oh, how I shall miss you when I am at
school!
I wonder if you will miss me?
Goodbye to the headlands, the bay and the
boats,
Goodbye to the Emily Jane,
Oh, how I should like to stay here by the sea
And never do lessons again.
P age Twelve


The fairies come and peep at me y
And dance all round about. ■BELflK 1®
I see them tripping through the door,
Then peeping through the crack,
And racing o’er the nursery floor,
Across the wall and back.

And racing o’er the nursery floor,


THE ELEPHANT
ESSIE the elephant at the Zoo
Is bigger than me and bigger than
you.
She has two eyes that are very small
And scarcely any tail at all.
But her trunk is very big and strong —
She curls it up as she walks along.
I wouldn’t like to live at the Zoo
And carry people about, would you?

FAIRY HELP
HAVE a little flower bed,
All full of pansies, pink and
blue,
And underneath the tiny plants
I think some fairies live, don’t you?
Nurse says they mind the baby roots,
And give them water fresh to drink,
For flowers could never be so sweet
Without the fairies’ help, I think.
TO THE FAIR
OGGETY-TROT, joggety-trot,
Off we go to the fair!
Joggety-trot, joggety-trot,
What will a penny buy there?
A candy for baby a penny will buy —
A candy, my sweetest one, if you don’t
cry;
So smile at your mother, we’ll soon be
there;
Jiggety-joggety —off to the Fair!

THE DREAM
UT in the garden I heard a queer
sound,
So walking on tip-toe I looked all
around,
And I saw a door open —I just peeped
through,
I don’t think that was a wrong thing to do.
Standing inside was a dear little mouse,
And this was the door of his own little
house;
He invited me in, the nice little fellow,
He wore a green cap and coat of bright
yellow.
“Please, Mousie,” I said, “won’t you tell me
vour name?”
Said he, “Yes, I will, if you’ll do the same.”
I said, “My name’s Tommy”; said he, “My
name’s Tim.”
I thought it most awfully clever of him.
He showed me all over his neat little house,
And cooking the dinner was little wife
mouse,
In pretty blue gown and a snowy white cap,
While the bahy was having its afternoon
nap.
“Oh, fancy,” I laughed, “If I were a cat.”
And poor Mr. Mouse raised his eyebrows at
that,
While Mother Mouse stared (she was mak-
ing a stew),
And the baby woke up. Oh, such a to-do.
They screamed, “I believe he’s a cat in
disguise.
Just look at the horrible green of his eyes.”
And just as they all scampered off in
fright,
I sat up in bed and I found it was light.

HE laughing Jackass sits out on the gate.
His mate proudly sits by his side
And listens intent as he merrily laughs.
He couldn’t be sad if he tried!
Soon more kookaburras will come at his call,
And fly with him into a tree,
Where together they’ll laugh at their wonderful joke,
I wish they could tell it to me.
Page Seventeen


LITTLE STARS
EAR little stars to shine so bright,
Like fairy lamps all through the night;
Baby and I just love to peep
At you, when nurse thinks we’re asleep,
Then back to bed we quietly creep.
Page Eighteen


THE POLAR BEAR
LOVE the Zoo,
Don’t you?
And the animals there,
Especially the bear —
Not the bear in the pit
(Though, of course, I like it);
I expect you’ve seen
The one I mean —
It’s the Polar Bear
With snow-white hair.
I like him best.
The rest
Aren’t a patch on this bear
Who, I declare,
Likes his home made of ice—
Thinks it’s awfully nice.
He must miss it, too,
Here in the Zoo.
I’m sure in his soul
He prefers the South Pole.
Page Nineteen


ISTEN while the rain-drops fall
And beat against the nursery wall,
Making such a splashing noise
As though to frighten girls and boys;
I think the wicked elves are out,
Hopping everywhere about,
ith little impish grinning faces,
’Neath the window running races!
Page Twenty


HEN Mother barfs our baby
She turns her round about,
And splashes her all over,
Then when she takes her out
She wraps her in a big soft towel,
As cosy as can be;
And Mother says, when I was young,
That’s what she did to me!
Page Twenty-one


DOES ANYBODY
KNOW?
HIGH is the way to Fairyland,
Does anybody know?
Is it through the wondrous clouds —
' So soft and white as snow?
Or is it over yonder hills,
Where little wild flowers grow?
Which is the way to Fairyland,
Does anybody know?

GOLDEN WATTLE
OLDEN WATTLE, fairy stuff,
Little balls of yellow fluff;
Hear the bees how loud they hum
To say they’re glad that spring is come.
When the stars begin to peep,
Then the wattle falls to sleep
Like a tired child in bed,
It droops its pretty golden head.
Page Twenty-three


NIGHT - TIME
T night, when it is moonlight time,
I jump up out of bed,
And climb upon the old armchair,
That’s taller than my head.
And up there in the dark blue sky
I see the moon so bright,
Page Twenty-four
And wish that I could sleep all day,
And stay awake all night.
For I am not afraid, you know,
To see the curious shadows go
Scamp’ring ’cross the nursery wall;
Oh, no, I’m not afraid at all!
Through the window, open wide,
Like little elves, they hop inside,
Dancing here, and dancing there.
Never stopping anywhere.
Nurse says they’re only fairy things,
Shadows made by fairies’ wings;
That is why I like to peep
At them, instead of going to sleep.

A LITTLE ELF
S I walked in the garden
I heard a little elf
Playing in the apple tree
And laughing to himself;
Then as I passed he shook the tree,
And apple-blossoms fell on me.

BOBBIE
OBBIE lives out on
farm by the sea,
I think he’s the luckiest
boy,
de’s a pony to ride, a dog, and
a cat,
And a magpie that talks,
Tyl Now just think of that!
Anri twn little
And two little calves
f-
That are going to the show,
Bobbie’s the luckiest boy that I know.
He rides in the lorry with butter and cheese
And sees it all packed on the boat.
And William the man who looks after the
farm,
Tells Bobbie such wonderful things;
He knows where to find the great eagle-
Then watches the fishermen draw in their
net
hawk’s nest,
(Some day he will help them,
Of course he can’t yet!)
And just where the bell-bird is heard at its
best,
He climbs the big mountain,
Where wallabies go,
And knows where to get
The wild orchids that grow,
Bobbie’s the happiest boy that I know,
For Bobbie, the luckiest boy that I know.

ITTLE ROBIN, sing to me.
Tell me which you’d rather be,
A tiny birdie in a tree
Or a big, strong boy of four like me.

STORIES
HENEVER I’ve been very
good,
Behaving as a nice child
should,
I have some chocolate after tea
And mother tells some tales to me.
She tells me where the dream flowers grow,
And everything I want to know;
Then when I nod a sleepy head,
She takes me off at once to bed.

THE NOISY
PARROTS
O-DAY the parrots were noisy and gay,
I think they were having a party
In the top of a gum-tree out in the field,
They seemed so happy and hearty.
Oh, how they did chatter, those bright painted birds:
Some yellow, some green and some red;
But not one of them listened, the rude little things,
To a word that another one said!

THE CLOCK
ICK-TOCK, Tick-tock,
Out in the hall says the grandfather clock.
Look at him there, how solemn he stands.
Pointing the time with his big black hands.
Nurse says he is very much older than me,
And older than grannie, and she’s eighty-three.
How tired he must be, poor grandfather clock.
Of standing out there saying Ticketty-tock!
Page Thirty


Of course that wouldn’t be quite fair
If Nursie knew that she was there;
But grown-up people cannot see
When fairies
THE VISITOR
AST night a fairy came to tea,
And sat at table next to me.
Nurse didn’t know that she was
there,
Although she shared my nursery chair.
She put her fingers in the jam,
And stamped and cried, “I want more ham.”
Then when she salted Nurse’s tea,
Nurse was cross and scolded me.
Page Thirty-one


t
YRIL is a crocodile,
Peter is a pig,
Marmaduke’s a monkey,
Precocious little prig.
They all live in the Noah’s ark
With Bill the polar bear,
And Percival the parakeet,
And many others there.
But when I’m gone to bed at night
They all come out to play,
Then when I wake nurse sends me off
To put them all away.
Page Thirty-two


WIND FAIRIES
HE little wind-fairies were out to-day,
Making such a commotion;
They rode on little white horses,
Far way over the ocean.
They raced about on the sandy shore.
And tossed the boats out at sea;
Went laughing and whistling everywhere,
As merry as merry could he.
They snatched our hats and ruffled our hair,
And shrieked as they scampered away
To pull and to push at the fisherman’s boat,
That lies down there in the bav.
j
They chased little seagulls away from the sea,
And thought ’twas the greatest fun;
For they never once stopped their impish tricks,
’Till they went to bed with the sun.
Page Thirty-three


THE DUSTMAN
WISH the dustman wouldn’t come
So early every night;
I do not want to go to bed
When all the world is light.
When I am grown up very big
I’ll go to bed quite late,
When all the street lamps have been lit
And all the clocks strike eight.
Page Thirty-four


THE SWING
IGH UP, high up,
Swing over the wall.
“Take care, take care,”
Cries Nannie, “you’ll fall.”
I’m sure I could touch it
If Nurse wouldn’t call,
“Be careful, be careful,
Or else you will fall.”
High up, high up,
High up, high up,
How small she looks there
From where I am swinging
I can see the blue sea,
Where the big ships are sailing.
But they can’t see me.
About in the air.
High up, high up,
I can look out to sea
High up, high up,
Swing over the wall,
“Take care, take care,”
Cries Nannie, “you’ll fall.”
And see the ships sailing,
Though they can’t see me.
High up, high up,
O ever so high,
There’s a tiny white cloud
Floating close to the sky.
Page Thirty-five


EE the farmer with his plough—
Gee-up, Dobbin, whoa there now.
Great lumps of earth on the
farmer’s feet,
The evening air is cool and sweet,
The sun sinks down behind the hill,
Everything is very still,
While the farmer with his plough
Calls to Dobbin, “Whoa there now.”
Page Thirty-six


THREE BEARS
URSE doesn’t know that there are
three bears
Sitting in here on the nursery
chairs;
Nurse doesn’t know and it’s perfectly true,
That they’re all escaped from their home in
the Zoo;
One’s Bruin, one’s Teddy, and one’s Mr. T.,
These are their names ’cos they told them to
me.
Oh, wouldn’t nurse jump if she knew three
great bears
Were sitting about in the nursery chairs!
So p’raps you had better go back to the Zoo,
For here she is coming, and if she sees you,
Poor nursie might die of the terrible fright;
So off you go, bearsies, dear bearsies, good-
night.

THE PENITENT
ABY, say your little prayer:
“Please God make me good.”
Go on darling. “Mummy, dear,
Do you fink he could?”

A LOVELY DREAM
Was full of toys and things
HAD a splendid dream last night,
’Twas all about our school.
I dreamt we had no teachers
And not a single rule.
Bats and balls and tops and trains
Like Father Christmas brings.
All the pegs upon the wall
Of caramel were made,
And everyone just helped themselves
And no one ever paid.
The chairs were made of chocolate
And all the tables, too;
Oh, dear, it was a lovely dream;
The lesson books had disappeared
I wish that that were true.
I wish it could come true.
I don’t think school will ever be
As nice as that, do you?
The class-room, like a gorgeous shop,
Page Thirty-nine


ADDY likes to come with me
When I go a-riding;
Likes to chase the bunnies out
Of places where they’re hiding.
Tommy trots along so trim,
Bunnies do not bother him.

BILLY 800
ILLY-BOO’S a little boy,
Not quite as big as me;
He plays at all the things I play,
And sometimes comes to tea.
He never speaks a single word,
And never makes a noise,
And though he skips and jumps and runs,
He’s not like other boys;
For when there is no sun at all,
And days are dull or grey,
I cannot find him anywhere
When I go out to play!
Page Forty-one


OFF TO SCHOOL
ROTTING off to school they go,
Happy little faces,
Merry smiles and dancing eyes,
So full of charms and graces.
Up above they see the sky,
And the gold sun peeping.
Later on, the sun will go,
And shadows will come creeping
Thus their days pass quickly by,
Shadows may come after,
So let them dance and sing and shout
To tunes of merry laughter.
Page Forty-tu)o


OOD-NIGHT, children,” the
dustman calls,
And with him you must go
To slumber deep in the land of sleep,
The land where the dream flowers
grow.
Page Forty-three


AT THE ZOO
0 you know what the lion told me
At the Zoo when I was there?
“No, I don’t,” he snapped, “but that’s not
all.
That he thinks the people very rude
The way they come and stare,
For what I hate much more
Is the silly way folk laugh at us —
What do they do that for?”
And make remarks about him
At his very own cage door.
Mr. Lion is vexed I said,
And will not understand
He said that in the jungle
Such ways he never saw!
That people only stare because
They think he is so grand!
Then I spoke to a little monkey
Who was in a dreadful rage,
And you are vexed because they laugh,
But that is silly, too,
And I asked him most politely,
“Don’t you like being in a cage?”
’Cos if you will play funny tricks
What can the poor things do?
Page Forty-four


MY HOME
T’S an old house in the country,
And it’s made of stout white stone,
It has four attic windows
And a garden all its own.
There are elm trees tall and stately,
And a hedge of box-thorn grows
Thickly along the low white fence,
Quite close to the briar rose.
There are fruit-trees in the orchard,
And tall acacias too,
Whose welcome shade in summer time
Is sweet for me and you.
It’s a quaint old-fashioned garden,
Where honeysuckle grows,
And fills the air with fragrance
As it bends to kiss the rose.
It’s an old house in the country,
And though afar I roam,
My thoughts will fly on wings of love
To my dear Australian home.

SPRING - TIME
SPLASH of purple in the grass,
A sweet scent in the air,
Wild hyacinths are coming up.
We see them everywhere!
LOVE to ride my scooter in the
street,
My scooter with its hooter;
To see the people scatter,
As they hear the merry clatter
Of my scooter with its hooter
In the street!
