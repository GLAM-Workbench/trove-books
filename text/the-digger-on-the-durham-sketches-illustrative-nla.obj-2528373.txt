THE DIGGER ON THE "DURHAM"


THE DIGGER ON THE
"DURHAM"
Sketches Illustrative of Life on a
Troopship, executed on the Voyage
Home of the 26th QUOTA, A.I.F.
BY
RANSOME T. WYATT
SYDNEY
W. C. PENFOLD & CO. LTD., 183 PITT STREET
1919


FOREWORD
■THE following sketches were made and used on board the
transport Durham during the voyage home of the 26th
demobilization quota of the A.I.F. They were executed under
somewhat cramped conditions on the troop-deck with no thought
of publication or of anything but their immediate purpose either
of announcement or amusement. As such they do not claim to be,
nor must they be regarded as works of art or decorative illustration,
but they do attempt to give some idea of life on a troopship —of
the diggers amusements, disappointments, impatience of delays and
their own peculiar humour. Even where a sketch is obviously hasty
or crude no attempt has been made to improve it for publication.
In some cases where the humour is too local for general understand-
ing a few words of explanation have been added, otherwise they
tell their own story.

The eternal inoculations in the A.I.F. are the subject of this
sketch. The M.O. with the corkscrew legs purports to be
Major Soiling, A.A.M.C. He criticized the anatomical
knowledge of the artist, but the " Durham" diggers will
side with the artist.
Notice the " two-up" ring in the centre of the queue.
Where two or three diggers are gathered together there
-you will find a " two-up " school.

" Say, Bill, it's wet all right'
[That mental condition recognized throughout
the A.I.F. as " dopey" is illustrated here.
On a long voyage, such as that of H.M.A.T.
" Durham," this is very noticeable.]

This is another exaggeration —founded on the fact that
owing to a little misbehaviour the C.O. cancelled the last
concert of the voyage.
The padre would like it understood that the artist has
taken a little liberty with his announcements.

Another popular slide at the expense of the speed of the " Durham."
The three figures in the foreground were an anticipation of the probable
appearance on arrival of the C.O., Lt.-Col. Freeman, D.S.O., M.C.; the
Adjutant, Capt. Zander; and the M.O., Major Soiling.

Some dissatisfaction was caused through a claim
made on the troops by the ship for damage,
assessed as above, alleged to have been done to
a steampipe. Above is depicted an opportunity
that the C.O. accorded for an explanation.

Another skit on the subject of claims. The Colonel and
Adjutant are seen receiving preposterous claims. In the upper
panels the diggers are having the same entered in their pay-
books and emerging from the pay-office " broke."
