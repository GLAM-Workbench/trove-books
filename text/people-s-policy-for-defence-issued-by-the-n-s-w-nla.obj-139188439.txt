PEOPLE’S POLICY FOR
DEFENCE
PRICE, 2d.
FOR VICTORY OVER
FASCISM !
Issued by the N.S.W. Legal Rights Committee, Room 520 Daking House, Sydney . A. Ogston, Sec.
Legality For Banned Body Would
Speed-Up War Effort
(ADAM OGSTON, Secty., Legal Rights Committee.)
World fascism, in the form of Tojo’s blood-drenched Japanese
soldiers, knocks loudly at Australia's back door. Our heroic
A.1.F., emulating the gallant Red Army, are dealing heavy blows
at the oncoming foe. But the Japs creep nearer daily. Soon
they may be actually fighting on our beloved soil, and for the
first time in history foreign invaders may be shedding their blood
and ours on the sun-parched plains and beautiful shores of this
land of ours.
The fury with which our boys in
khaki fight can only be matched by
the devotion to duty shown by the
army in overalls on the production
battlefront. Despite the undoubted
eagerness of the working class to de-
feat the enemy, there are sinister in-
fluences at work in this country who
are doing their best to lower morale
and create a condition of confusion
which would make it easy for the
invader.
Strikes and struggles are occurring.
The press is at great pains to show
how “disloyal” the workers are, yet
not a word is being said or written
about the real causes of the discon-
tent gripping the people. It becomes
imperative, therefore, for all patrio-
tic Australians to seek out the causes
and point to the remedy.
AN “ILLEGAL” BODY.
In this country is an organisation
of Australia, whose chief aim is win-
ning the war. Their influence has
grown tremendously in the last six
months, due, among other things, to
the victories of the Soviet Union over
Hitlerite Germany. Despite their
passionate desire to contribute
to the war effort, and the fact
that they are even now doing their
utmost to increase production, swell
the army, and lift morale, this organ-
isation is an illegal organisation,
and is thus working under tremen-
dous difficulty in doing its bit for the
common effort.
It becomes, therefore, a major
question of war effort for the Federal
Government to lift the ban immedi-
ately from the organisation and re-
store the property stolen from it by
the previous government.
This would break down one ob-
stacle to a total war effort.
If we are to have a people’s de-
fence—if we are to lift morale to
that level of struggle necessary to
defeat the enemy, if we are to put
our house in order, increase produc-
tion, and swell the armed forces,
then we say: “Let all organisations
have a go. Restore their full legal
status!”
Wharfies Resent Slanders
FACTS OF SODA-ASH DISPUTE
At a mass meeting of wharf laborers, a resolution to work
the soda ash was put forward. It was carried with only eleven
dissentients.
This gives the lie to those who
malign the patriotism of the wharfies.
The attitude of Prime Minister Curtin
was roundly condemned. Eddie Ward,
according to press reports, expressed
surprise. It is the opinion of the
wharflaborers that Mr. Curtin’s state-
ment was not a decision of Cabinet.
Wharfies, and all dinkum Austra-
lians, resent Mr. Lazzarini’s threat of
“work or the Army.” The Australian
worker considers it to be an honor
to join the Army, not a punishment.
Statements of this nature do not settle
disputes or improve public confidence.
WHY THE THREAT?
The threatened use of the Navy, far
from making for an increased war
effort, might have completely blocked
production by provoking a general
stoppage on the waterfront.
It was because of this, because
shipping must be kept moving, pro-
duction must go on and on, that the
workers reached their decision.
The soda ash problem must be
tackled in a thorough manner if a
victory on the production front is to
be won.
OBNOXIOUS CARGO.
This is the most obnoxious and dan-
gerous cargo handled on the water-
front. Workers handling it for some
days are compelled to go on compen-
sation. This is an effective way of re-
ducing man-power and production.
The use of drums instead of bags as
at present, the better use of concilia-
tion, would go a long way to secure
Industrial peace.
January 22 was the third anniver-
sary of the wharfies’ struggle
against shipping scrap iron to
Japan.
A.W.U. Want
Ban Lifted
At its half-yearly Meeting
held Jan. 22nd, the N.S.W.
Branch of the A.W.U. declared
in favor of restoring legality
to the Communist Party of Aus-
tralia.
The Resolution read:
“Realising the urgent need for
unity and 100 per cent, war effort,
I propose that this meeting of mem-
bers request our Union to urge the
Federal Goverrnment to legalise at
once the Communist Party.”
Resolution, moved by M. Lauder,
was carried unanimously.
J. Mac Neil, general president of
the A.W.U., and secretary of the
N.S.W. Branch, stated he would
submit it to the Convention. Chris.
Dalton, Branch president, was also
in attendance.
EVACUATION NOTE
School teachers, conscious of our
national peril, volunteered to give up
holidays in the interests of the com-
mon safety. They were prepared to
plan and carry out efficient evacu-
ation in which their experience,
knowledge of children, and of or-
ganisation could have successfully
and speedily solved the problem.
Several were called-up to learn
rope making!
“Miners Out To
Smash Fascism”
(Special interview with the new
President of the Miners’ Federation.)
“There are no strings to our
offer of increased production.
We mean business; we’re out to
help smash fascicm. But we
won’t allow our promises and
guarantees to be exploited by
certain selfish coal-owners or
any other section.”
Wells urged that the tirade
against the miners because of
isolated stoppages be stopped.
“Miners are producing record
quantities of coal, and they
should be made to feel that their
efforts are appreciated,’’ he said.
“The bungling and provoca-
tion which lead to these stop-
pages must be handled by the
Government.”
Fighting Provocation.
“1 he miners,” he added,
“must learn to fight for higher
production in face of and
against provocation from the
owners.
“Complete confidence can be
secured all the way round as
soon as these attacks and slan-
ders are ended.”
“Bob” thanked Adam Og-
ston for his message of congrat-
ulation. “Yes, my election was,
indeed, a vindication of militant
policy.’’
Belgian Priests Spurn
Anti-Bolshevik Crusade
The Hitlerites didn’t succeed
in forcing the Catholic clergy to
endorse the “crusade” against
the U.S.S.R.
The Fascist / press admits that out
of several thousand clergymen only
one, only a single clergyman, agreed
to come out in favor of war against
the U.S.S.R,
Catholic action against the occupa-
tion forces is of a mass character.
Cardinal Van Roy, head of the Bel-
igan Catholic Church, declared that
the enemies of Hitler Germany are
Belgium’s friends and that his people
“prefer death to the disgrace of go-
ing on their knees to the invader.”
Battling Waste
WORKERS ON ALERT
“It’s your production against
his,” says the poster. How seri-
ously is the message of this
poster entertained in certain
quarters ?
The engineering, blacksmithing and
boilermaking shops at the Mortlake
establishment cf Lie Australian Gas-
I .ight Company are in use only during
the customary working hours, and
then only upon w.vk for the industry.
The Mortlake Sub-branch of the Gas
Employees’ Union have decided to ap-
proach the Government on this wast-
age of machinery.
Such a policy o* monopoly use of
equipment is a deliberate restriction
of our Australian war potential. It is
a crime against the people. Total war
means total effort. Even if it also
means a reduction of profits.
St. Peters Wool Storage.
An invoice lot of wool such as
stored here may consist of 150 bales.
The wool is stored in “double dumps.”
When a unit is commenced there may
be six to twenty invoice lots to be
stacked.
In most cases the full invoice is not
sent from the dump to the store.
Often they are e few bales short.
When a shed is full, holding perhaps
fifty different invoices, and each
stack is incomplete, great confusion
arises. This wastes time and space
and labor.
The responsibility falls mainly
upon woolbrokers’ offices where the
orders for invoices are issued.
If the complete order were issued
to the wool-dumping firms, they in
turn would be able to deliver these
complete to the storage units.
Discussion with the foreman on
the job in one case brought a
marked improvement.
More Shipping—More Profits.
On the outbreak of war in the Paci-
fic, a ship bound for Hong Kong was
recalled, and ordered to discharge its
cargo of flour, tinned goods and fod-
der at the ports where each consign-
ment had been loaded.
At thus same tinv a sister ship w'as
loading similar cargo for Darwin.
For greater efficiency and speed, the
ship recalled from the Hong Kong trip
should have been diverted to Darwin.
But that would have meant less
profit to the owners!
Steel Workers
Step-Up
Production
Increase has taken place at
Alloy Steel. Through the efforts
of the men themselves, produc-
tion has been stepped-up con-
siderably, in one section by
nearly fifty per cent.
The men have had a number of
meetings to find ways of getting bet-
ter co-ordination of work and more
efficient production.
Suggestions have been made to the
boss with beneficial results.
At the moment more speedy pro-
duction is being held up through the
scarcity of an electric appliance. The
men have written to the Supply Min-
ister asking him to speed up delivery.
The men have promised to step-
up production, 100 per cent, if given
better working facilities and 100 per
cent, co-operation from the man-'
agement and the Government.
BUILD A PEOPLE’S ARMY
(By W. McDOUGALL)
The grim warning of Deputy-Prime Minister Forde, “calling the people of Australia to
their battle stations”, raises even more sharply than ever the question of Home Defence, the
building of a People’s Army, to defend every factory, street and home.
Fortunately for us, we have a
wealth of experience to draw from
—the guerilla fighters of China,
Spain, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia
and the enslaved nations of Europe.
Unfortunately for us, there has not
been a strong enough Govern-
lead to stir the people, making use of
their initiative, arming them and
teaching them how to make and use
rough-and-ready weapons against the
Invader.
The military forces and the Volun-
teer Defence Corps should be backed
up by a civilian population that is
organised, trained and armed.
EAGER TO GO.
The Australian people are already
prepared to emulate their brothers
and sisters of other lands. Already
local citizens’ committees have been
set up in many areas, training and
drilling, and working out methods
to play their part against the Japan-
ese. Lack of co-ordination and the
sporadic nature of such committees
is a reflection, not on the commit-
tees, but on the authorities who have
not helped and encouraged them.
Diehards, of course, don’t like the
idea of “amateur armies.” however
capable. They would rather see
Japan take over than have their
Old School Tie ideas upset.
Such ideas must be swept aside,
however, if Australia is to be saved
from the invader. Proper train-
ing and equipment should be
given to the people, and arms sup-
plied where available.
END DELAY.
Get on with the job! Calamity
howlers create panic. True, but
publicity must be given to the
bungling that has taken place, how
we were misled as to the true situ-
ation on the Pacific, and to the lack
of effective strength to our fighting
forces.
That is but part of the picture.
What can we do now with what
we have; what we can do to over-
come the dangers ahead—that is
the main thing.
We can learn from the struggles
of the people of the Soviet Union
who, in this second major trial,
once again proved masters of the
situation. It is this: The morale
of the people is the dominant factor
in determining victory or defeat.
Listen to Marshal Voroshilov:
“During the Civil War (1917-
21) the Red Army, poorly clad,
ill-fed and indifferently armed,
defeated and utterly destroyed the
well-equipped forces of the inter-
centionists and Whiteguards. This
revealed the spirit and high morale
of the new Red Army, a genuine
revolutionary army of the people.”
Eighteenth Congress, C.P.S.U.,
March, 1939.
UP TO GOVERNMENT.
It is up to the Government to
show quite decisively to the people
that profits and influence will not
be allowed to slow up the factories
and war machine; that the price
of working-class sacrifice is a share
in the control of management, and
in the politics of the war itself.
No effort should be spared to
encourage initiative by the people
in finding ways and means, in co-
operation with the proper authori-
ties, of perfecting defence meas-
ures. Ruthless action must be
taken against Fifth Columnist
and pro-fascists generally.
Big business interests who want
bigger dividends rather than a total
war effort must be effectively dealt
with. This will not weaken the
morale of the people. On the con-
trary, it will inspire the strength and
confidence so necessary in the pre-
sent highly critical situation.
Control Capital, Capitalists
And Manpower
(By J. B. MILES)
The organisation of all the resources of the nation for the
greatest possible war effort must include the organisation of man
power. This means that the minimum number of workers are em-
ployed on civilian needs, but not to the point of undermining the
well-being and efficiency of workers, or lowering the morale of
our soldiers due to fear for their families,.
It means to place men where they can contribute most effect-
ively to production. It means to draw women into industry to
release skilled men for other work, and to release men, not essen-
tial to industry, for the armed forces.
It should mean keeping skilled men
whose work could add to the equip-
ment of our forces out of the call-
up and enlistment. It means trans-
fer of labor from industry to indus-
try, probably the closing of some
non-essential plants and, in some in-
stances, transfer over long distances.
The aim is the highest level of war
production and the mobilisation of the
strongest possible armed forces and
organisation for civilian and industry
protection and civilian defence. No
mere regimentation will secure these
results in this country; there must be
consideration for the effects on
workers.
Closing of non-essential enterprises
is not enough; there must be, as Mr.
Ward put it, “regulation and organi-
sation of the capital resources of Aus-
tralia.” Control of capital is not
merely control of money; it is also
control of raw material, semi-pro-
cessed material, factories and other
means of production, and such con-
trol of owners and managers as will
ensure that none is allowed to place
private interests before production
for victory.
Treatment of Workers.
The transfer of workers under the
Government man-power plans should
be carried out in agreement with the
unions involved. This was ’done in
the transfer of wharf labor from
Queensland to Darwin. Travelling
expenses and payment of wages while
travelling must be met, either by the
Government or the enterprise to
which workers are transferred. If it
is possible to transfer families with
workers, this should be done, and
expenses met in the same way. If it
is not practical to transfer families,
then an allowance becomes necessary
to meet the added cost in such cases.
Experience in towns where war
industry has grown rapidly makes
it clear that there will be an acute
housing and accommodation pro-
blem when the new, factories are
opened, when those understaffed
are fully manned. These difficul-
ties should be anticipated and pre
pared for, otherwise there will be
inefficiency and discontent.
In all the press statements and
comment no attention has been paid
to these problems. The unions have
the duty to see that they are not
ignored. In the Interests of morale
and the aim—production—the Gov-
ernment and unions and employers
must prepare to solve them.
What Kind of Control of
Capital ?
The announcement of the man-
power plans, and Mr. Ward’s state-
ment of nationalisation, has raised a
controversy. Neither the national-
ises nor the defenders of private en-
terprise put forward a clear plan.
Some employers and managers have
made it clear that their conception of
efficiency is that they be allowed to
run their business in their own way,
resisting all Government interference
and all trade union efforts to safe-
guard workers and to improve pro-
duction.
On the other hand, the history of
capitalist State enterprise indicates
that there can be as much corrup-
tion and inefficiency as in any private
enterprise. The issue is the greatest
production now from the enterprises
as they are, and as they may be bet-
ter organised in the near future. To
“take over completely,” as Mr. Ward
said, would create a bloc between
efficient and inefficient owners (and
many others who are not opposed to
private enterprise as a system), and
introduce an element of more or less
serious conflict into the nation which
would result in less production.
“Wealth Must Be Regimented.”
But if the workers have to make
sacrifices, so must the wealthy.
Wealth must be regimented, Mr. Ward
said. Very good, but how, and how
much? While speaking of “complete
nationalisation,” Mr. Ward also said,
“confiscation of industries is not con-
templated.” He would give the owners
of capital bond interest rates. So
the workers would still produce a
surplus to augment capital!
Such nationalisation has been des-
scribed by Socialists as State guar-
antee of an income to the capitalists,
and therefore, is not Socialism. And
on what basis would the interest be
paid? On the actual paid capital,
or the market price of shares, or on
a valuation of the enterprise to-day?
The need is to get the Govern-
ment to use its existing powers, in
consultation with labor organisa-
tions as well as business men, to
regiment wealth as well as man-
power.
The control of raw material, the
power to close non-essential factories,
the power to control inefficient fac-
tories and deal with provocative
managers and employer organisations,
the power to tax and control the
money hoards of the wealthy exist,
and have been partly used. The full
use of these and other powers in re-
lation to capital as well as man-
power need not raise the disturbing
issue of private ownership of means
of production except when there is
refusal to conform.
Government and Unions.
The essential and the immediately
practical issue is control in the in-
terests of production and victory.
There are forces urging control of
workers only, and others are putting
forward confused demands for imme-
diate abolition of private enterprise.
Both are opposite sides of embarrass-
ment and disturbance to the Govern-
ment, production and morale.
What is needed is co-operation
between the Government, the unions
(including the Left), and employers
who place production before profit,
to organise man-power, with due
regard to well-being and efficiency,
and to “regulate and organise the
capital resources,” ruthlessly against
any private interest hindrances,
but without raising private pro-
perty issues in a way that would
cause deep division and lessen
production.
Shop Committee
Active
HOWARD AUTO-CULTIVATOR
Readers will recall the suc-
cessful meeting of the Howard
Cultivator shop committee with
the management. This commit-
tee is on the job. It again shows
the way.
It is pressing the management to
forward the following telegram to the
Government:—
“We know that a number of drop-
forging dies have been completed,
and are now ready for use in this
plant, but as there is no material
available the work cannot go on.
We feel that this is a reflection upon
those responsible for the supply of
material to firms such as this. We
insist that, in the interests of Aus-
tralia's war effort, some immediate
action be taken to ensure delivery
of the material required without
further delay.”
Production Lags
At Perdriau’s
Using two moulds, the Perd-
riau Rubber Company produces
an average of seventy tyres each
week. This amount could be
turned out daily under a pro-
gressive policy with more men
and moulds.
The firm is said to have secured,
some months ago, a contract for
23,000 Bren gun carrier wheels. The
management stated that two new
“pots” would be installed with extra
moulds. Three shifts would work on
this contract, producing approxim-
ately 2300 tyres per month.
But nothing happened, except a de-
sultory attempt to instal the extra
pots.
The same tragic picture is seen in
the pneumatic tyre section. Here six
pots are used, but, for the past four
months, only at one-third capacity.
The firm is badly behind in its
army contract for these essentials
of mechanised war.
International Comment
(By E.W.C.)
ALLIES’ GREATEST
GENERAL
“I regard Stalin as the greatest
general in the allied cause to-day.”
This opinion was expressed by Sir
Hubert Gough, the general who com-
manded the British Fifth Army in
1916-18.
When some labor leaders paid
similar laudatory tribute to Lenin,
after the Revolution of October, 1917,
his reply was: “If only they would
praise us less and try more to learn
what we are really doing.”
It is certain that Stalin, who is
noted for his modesty, shares this
feeling.
The people of Britain and Australia
also do.
TORY PLOT
The British Communist Party has
exposed a Tory plot to get rid of
the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill.
They are trying in a most cunning
fashion to make use of public anxiety
over the Par Eastern situation to fur-
ther their reactionary ends.
If Churchill were deposed and his
place filled by Sir John Anderson or
another of the Chamberlain gang, it
would mean a reversal of the Anglo-
Soviet Friendship policy, and a re-
turn to the Munich line of appeasing
German reactionaries.
Britain would become another
Prance, Australia would be thrown
to the wolves, even as Austria and
Czechoslovakia were.
This plot must be smashed. Church-
ill’s policy in many respects falls
short of what is needed in the pre-
sent situation, but it is preferable to
that of the Tory old brigade.
Churchill must be shown that the
people of the Empire are 100 per cent,
behind the policy of the Anglo-Soviet
Alliance, the policy of decisive victory
over the Axis.
Pressure must be sustained for the
opening of a second front against
Hitler, and the removal of the Men
of Munich from the Cabinet.
MALAYAN EPIC
The gallant fight of the
A.I.F. on the Muar River front
constitutes an epic in the an-
nals of warfare.
Two battalions (1800 men) opposed
a Japanese division (15,000 men).
Enormous casualties were inflicted
on the enemy. Ten Japanese tanks
were knocked out within an hour. A
serious situation was prevented from
becoming a complete and utter rout.
There is grim tragedy in the refer-
ence to our “advanced anti-tank
GUN” (gun when it should be guns,
guns and guns again); “the only gun
we had left was put out of action,”
etc.
Similarly with the stories of
bayonet assaults on machine gun
nests, etc.
The Muar River battle provides one
more proof that Australians can take
it.
But we have no desire to go on
taking it. What we want is to dish
it out, and to dish it out, we need
the arms, to get the arms we need a
100 per cent, effort in the factories.
Trade unionists have shown their
desire to supply this. It is up to the
Government and employers to co-
operate.
The Industrial Relations Council
was by no means satisfactory to the
Trade Unions, but they sought to im-
prove it, not to sabotage its work.
The employers who withdrew from
this committee should be disciplined;
they are letting down our boys in
Malaya and other battle stations.
The Red Army’s New Recruits in training far behind the lines listen
to the day’s communique.

PEOPLE'S
POLICY FOR DEFENCE
Labor’s Budget Better
Than Fadden’s, But —
POOR WORSE OFF COMPARED
WITH WELL-TO-DO
The great need of the moment is to produce the arms and
to train the men to defeat the Axis. The greater the success in
this job the greater is the Government need for money to finance
the war effort.
As we work wholeheartedly to
achieve the essential aim of the pre-
sent war, namely, to smash the Axis,
we must welcome greater budget ex-
penditure by the Labor Government.
The bigger budget of revenue and
expenditure of the Curtin govern-
ment is in part a measure of its su-
periority over its U.A.P.-U.C.P. pre-
decessor. Moreover, it must be admit-
ted that incomes from wages, which
should be exempt from taxes in nor-
mal times, must bear a share of war-
time taxation.
A progressive system of taxation
must follow a reasonable interpreta-
tion of ability to pay. Doubtless there
will still be the better-off and the
worse-off after all sections pay their
taxes, under the present war-time cir-
cumstances. But at least the position
of the poor should not be made worse
in relation to the better-off sections
by the imposition of the war taxes.
Ability to Pay.
How does the new Federal war tax,
which was deducted from wages from
the first w'eek in January, measure
up to these principles? The tax rises
to a rate of one shilling in the pound,
and there is not much attempt to
make it progressive by increasing the
rate of the tax on high incomes rela-
tively to their ability to pay a higher
rate.
A man, married, without children,
earning the basic wage, pays an extra
shilling weekly in “war tax.” A man
with a similar number of dependents
on £lB a week pays an extra seven-
teen shillings a week.
After he has paid all Federal and
State taxes, the man on the basic
wage has £4/8/- left, and the man
on £lB a week has £l3/2/-.
Many workers get a margin these
days, and are perhaps more in the
position of a man earning £5 per week.
If he has only a wife he pays an extra
3/10 weekly, and has £4/13/- a week
left after he has paid all Federal and
State taxes.
Less Food for Workers.
In both of these cases the wage-
earner is faced with enforced reduc-
tions in food, clothing or necessary
recreation for himself or his family.
Meanwhile, a man on a high income
is still able to get all necessities and
customary comforts, and even luxur-
ies.
The poor become worse off if any-
thing, as compared with the well-
to-do.
It must be remembered moreover
that the last budget imposed new in-
direct taxes, which meant for the
small wage-earner a penny more for
cigarettes and beer, which amounts
are paid without any worry by the
higher incomes.
The Labor Government made a con-
siderable advance on the Fadden ad-
ministration which manipulated the
finances in the interests of the rich.
It has increased the taxes on high
incomes and on public companies ap-
preciably.
More Taxes from Rich.
The present scale of luxury expendi-
ture shows that these taxes can be
increased still more and should be
increased before new 1 calls are made
cn the lower incomes.
A taxation policy framed on prin-
ciples which will secure more equal
sacrifice is absolutely necessary to
avoid a situation in which many
workers have to do without some
of the bare necessities of life.
The Menzles-Padden policy of bud-
geting in the interests of the rich did
much to undermine the war effort,
because the people were aware that
they were not getting a fair deal. A
Labor financial policy based more and
more on ability to pay will do much
to secure a maximum war effort.
Strike Against Luxury
Production
Workers at Ford’s factory,
Brisbane, recently struck because
the management continued to
produce cars for civilian use. The
men issued a statement that they
would stay out until military
lorries were put on the assem-
bly line.
This was done!
The daily press did not report
this important event.
A.W.A. Shop
Committee Bulletin
Congratulations on their pub-
lication “Fuse Cap.’’
“Fuse Cap’s” first issue deals
with the pressing problems of
production, man-power and
A.R.P. The editorial board
have done a good job.
It is evident that the shop
committee is energetic and is
actively tackling the task in a
thorough and determined man-
ner. This is the way the war
will be won.
EMERGENCY.
The staff of Fox Bros., a Pitt
Street firm engaged on war work, are
faced with a problem. Air raid
wardens employed here have been un-
able, despite determined efforts, to
locate the sector warden. This is
the cause of considerable confusion,
and hinders the entire A.R.P. pre-
parations of the firm.
Role Of Anti-Soviet Press
By JOHN FISHER
“BULLETIN” & SIR K. MURDOCH
Over the last few weeks, in! posters and leading articles,
the “Bulletin” has plunged again Into anti-Soviet propaganda.
The “Bulletin” many years ago
had a reputation for progressive
Australianism. It trades on that
ancient reputation, when pouring
out its poison in the interests of
anti-Australian profiteers.
And it has a crisp and bogus-radical
style of writing—similar to that used
by Hitler when building his “National
Socialist German Workers’ Party”—
which appeals to many people who
would not be deceived by a “Sydney
Morning Herald” editorial.
If, however, the “Bulletin” makes
headway with its anti-Soviet propa-
ganda, other organs of big business
may bring up their heavy guns in
support. Apart from its more pro-
vocative- function, the role of the
“Bulletin” is pehaps to test how much
the public, and the Government, will
tolerate in the form of attacks on
our Russian Ally.
Obvious Lie
The “Bulletin” complains that “at-
tempt after attempt was made by
‘Australian’ Communists and their
dupes to embroil this country With
Japan.” It repeats the obvious lie
put over Tokio radio that a “Soviet
naval attache” congratulated Japan
for sinking the “Prince of Wales” and
the “Repulse”! This and a lot more
that could have come straight from
Hitler.
And the “Bulletin” put on its poster
(January 21) the Infamous phrase
which Sir Keith Murdoch worked
cautiously into a long and windy
article: “Russia is secretive, suspicious
and silent”!!
Sir Keith Murdoch, Australian press
magnate, was until recently Director-
General of Information. He has just
concluded a visit to Britain at the
invitation of the British Information
Ministry.
His article, boosted by the “Bulle-
tin,” is perhaps the most amazing
attack ever made by a responsible
man on an Aliy in time of war.
(An Ally, in this case, which has
borne the chief burden of the fight-
ing and the casualties.)
Murdoch’s article was featured in
the Sydney “Sunday Sun” on January
11, and in leading newspapers
throughout Australia.
Murdoch Runs Amok
It has to be seen to be believed.
Here are some of the things that Mur-
doch cabled from London: “A large
proportion of Germans even admire
Churchill. A very large proportion
Would welcome a negotiated peace
with Britain. How far Russia can
continue pushing and harassing the
retreating Germans depends largely
upon the amount of supplies—prin-
cipally British supplies. There is good
hope that the Germans will suffer
heavy losses through the next three
months, but no hope that Russia will
attack Japan. Russia is secretive,
suspicious and silent . . . Our own
splendid (British) production, and the
Americans’ huge potential production
have been planned for strategies and
policies which now require recasting.’’
Any neutral observer would get the
impression that Murdoch Was a dan-
gerous lunatic calling for an at-
tempted pact with Germany against
Russia. Even the ghost of Chamber-
lain would warn him against trying
that on. It is hardly likely that the
Soviet Government will let itself be
outwitted in 1942 any more than in
1939.
But, from the Australian point of
view, we may well be angry and
alarmed that such propaganda is
appearing in newspapers claiming
to speak for the nation.
Making Japan Glad
One can imagine that Japanese dip-
lomats would gladly seize on such
articles as Murdoch’s, and hand them
to the Soviet Government as “proof”
that Australia, or at least its leading
newspapers, did not seem to want
Russia as an Ally.
To put it mildly, such anti-Soviet
propaganda would hardly encourage
Russia to hasten its active interven-
tion on the side of Australia against
Japan. The propaganda is particular-
ly provocative, as the tone of the
Soviet Press is entirely friendly to-
wards Australia.
This matter is being taken up by
a very high Commonwealth author-
ity, who is said to be making it
clear in appropriate quarters that
this anti-Soviet propaganda is en-
tirely opposed to Government pol-
icy.
This is a long way better than noth-
ing. But, if leading newspapers con-
tinue to make this type of attack on
Russia (as distinct from honest
opinion), we need not wonder that our
relations with Russia, in our present
hour of peril, are not as close as we
would like.
In their blind class hatred of work-
ing-class Russia, some of our Press
barons are prepared to sink the Aus-
tralian ship.
Russia as Ally
The “Bulletin” does not seem to
want us to have Russia as an Ally.
Nor does Tokio. Nor does Berlin.
Nor, perhaps, do certain of the “old
gang” in the British Foreign Office
who have never been keen on Aus-
tralia having direct links with any-
where (except the British Foreign
Office). And Moscow’s attitude to-
wards Australia is one of non-inter-
ference; they won’t try to ram friend-
ship down our throats if we don’t
want it.
But Australia can have close and
cordial relations with Russia against
the common enemy if we are pre-
pared to overcome some purely arti-
ficial obstacles set up by interested
parties.
More than this, Australia —a
Pacific power with a great demo-
cratic tradition, with a Labor Gov-
ernment including some personal-
ities of world standing—can by vig-
orous action pjay a leading part in
assisting a real A.8.C.D.8. collective
security pact, against all aggression.
Malay Reds On
Defence Council
GOVERNOR WELCOMED
PARTY OFFER
In the desperate danger now threatening, the Malayan Com-
munist Party, whose offer of help was accepted by the Governor,
has been given a major role within the Chinese Mobilisation
Council. “It is a historic landmark in British Colonial policy,”
reports a press correspondent.
Plans to enlist 10,000 local Chinese
against the Japanese are being under-
taken by the Council.
The police admit the efficiency of
the overnight flood of vivid posters
and pamphlets issued by the Com-
munists exhorting Asiatics to unite
with Britain, America and Russia to
defeat the Japanese.
The correspondent talked with party
leaders just released from gaol, heard
of the hundreds of agents organised
behind, the Japanese lines, of contact
maintained with them, of the com-
mon hatred of fascism among thous-
ands of Malayan and Chinese workers
ready to fight with the Allies “if en-
couraged.” These leaders place their
names on the manifestos “though they
know the Japanese murderers may
enter Singapore.”
“Arm the Masses!”
The membership of the Party in-
clude not only the native and In-
dian thousands, but also Europeans
with wide trade union and guild
influence.
The Communists are pressing for
the arming of the many thousands
clamoring to be drilled and organised,
and also for the Assembly to grant
living standards which will ensure
that the workers will be physically
capable of carrying out the war
struggle to the best advantage.
The life of thousands of these work-
ers is a continual guerilla skirmish
with death, poverty and disease. They
are steeled to hardships. Twenty
thousand such men, organised and
even partially armed, would be a tre-
tnendous force to help rout the fascist
invader,

SCIENCE.
Specialist scientists of the Agri-
cultural Department, experts of in-
sect-carrier disease and insect con-
trol, were compelled to enlist as
ordinary privates. These men can be
of invaluable service in preventing
disease and saving A.I.P. lives.
Tropical warfare demands their
organised services. Has anything
been done to remedy this wastage of
talent?
A.R.P. In
The Railways
The Minister for N.E.S., Mr.
Heffron, will be asked to receive
a deputation on A.R.P. in the
railways. The shop committees
are playing a most active part
and are making headway.
In many metropolitan workshops
and power stations, meetings have
been addressed by local officers upon
A.R.P. The practical value of these
was greatly increased by constructive
criticism and suggestions from the
workers. Good results have followed
the workers’ participation. However,
the rank and file suggestions have not
always been carried out.
At Eveleigh Carriage Shop and
Works a needless and dangerous posi-
tion exists. Untrained officers have
been appointed by the Department as
wardens over trained wardens, some
of whom are actually official instruc-
tors.
The shop committee has submitted
a draft A.R.P. plan. This is what is
needed. Workers can plan.
End Aluminium
Wastage!
SAY COCKATOO WORKERS
The Federal Government has
issued a heart-rending appeal to
all housewives for old alumin-
ium pots and pans for planes.
Workers at Cockatoo Dockyard are
amazed at the huge amounts of the
metal being used on a certain naval
ship. Two large deck lockers have
been made of thick aluminium and
thousands of feet have been used to
provide deck head lining, bulk heads
and ratings’ personal lockers, besides
hundreds of key tallies. Substitute
materials, such as sheet metal, mason-
ite or plywood, could be easily used,
giving nearly equal efficiency.
We say there is a lot of humbug
being talked about this matter. Every
piece of unnecessary aluminium
should be eliminated from the ships.
We call upon the Navy Board to do
this immediately in the Interests of
the defence of our country.
Our slogan must be: All available
aluminium for aircraft!
The Inside Dope
A letter to the well-known New
York Periodical, “P.M.”:—
Dear Sir,—
Nobody can fool me. By carefully
reading the daily newspapers for
two years, plus the columns of
Dorothy Thompson, Westbrook
Pegler, General Johnson and Walter
Lippmann, I have learned that: —
Hitler decided to fight the Soviets
because his ally, Stalin, was com-
pletely under his thumb and was
sending him all the war supplies he
needed. The Finns are fighting for
Hitler because Finland is a little
democratic nation, and Baron
Mannherhelm is its George Wash-
ington. The Russians are resisting
the Nazis so tenaciously because
they hate Stalin’s Communism and
are planning a revolution. The
Nazis and Communists are fighting
to the death because Communism
and Nazism are the same thing
called Communazism. The Red
Army did not collapse in ten days
because it is made up of ignorant
peasants who won’t listen to the ex-
perts of the U.S. War Department.
It crimped the blitz because all its
best military leaders had been purged
by Stalin.
I know all the inside dope about
Russia because I read the news-
papers.
(Signed)
WELL-INFORMED.
COST-PLUS AGAIN.
Before the war, waste metal at
Armco, Sutherland, was carefully
collected and tied in bundles for the
worker whose job it was to arrange
for their disposal. Since the intro-
duction of cost-plus this is not so.
Hours and hours are wasted
—drained away from the war effort.
LIFT THE BAN!
(On occasion of the 1942 Welcome to J. B. Miles, Australian
Leninist Leader, to be held at the Sydney Town Hall, Saturday
night, Jan. 31.)
Our strength is great,
But greater yet will be.
Let this mass-social start
A fire of people’s power
To wage this people’s war:
Let each one play full part
The fascist beasts to rout
And crush for evermore.
Our comrades die:
We will avenge their death!
So let us each one work
For full production boom
To make the people win:
Let none sit back or shirk
To wreak the Fascist doom,
But everyone all in!
All democrats, all workers,
Your interests are at stake!
So, for a free Australia,
For a stronger National Union,
Use every means you can;
Fight on, petition, slogan,
Till Parliament takes action
AND LIFTS THE PARTY BAN!
—Jean Montgomery.
Bottlenecks In
Metal Industry
SURVEY REVEALS WASTE OF
MATERIAL, TIME AND CASH
The main bottleneck in the metal industry is the fact that
there are insufficient steel furnaces and rolling mills.
This factor was evidenced from 1939, when Australian in-
dustries outside of the B.H.P. were unable to get all their require-
ments. In some cases they were able to obtain only 80 per cent,
of their requirements, yet in this period the B.H.P. were exporting
steel overseas, much of it to Hong Kong.
Essington Lewis, as chairman of
8.H.P., and in his Government capa-
city. was aware of the situation. In-
quiries will show that expansion in
this direction, if any, was confined to
8.H.P.-controlled industries in the
vulnerable coastal factories.
Steel is still going into production
on non-essentials, such as modern
hotels. In one Newcastle industry,
plant was taken off war work to make
2,000 stainless steel golf club heads.
Steel is being wasted in the con-
struction of new factories, machines,
shipbuilding yards, without due con-
sideration for existing facilities, and
the proper utilising of non-essential
factories and their machines for war
production.
MILLS CLOSED.
In Lysaghts, Newcastle, four sheet
mills have been closed down for the
past 18 months, due to the shortage
of steel. Recently a stainless steel
sheet mill was constructed in C.S.C.,
plus three furnaces. This is a typical
exiample of wastage in not using
existing plant capable of doing this
work.
In Railway shops, machines are
working on Railway jobs during the
day, and working on war work as
overtime. This means stopping the
machine at the finish of day work,
dismantling the job, then put the war
job on to the machine, when, in
many cases another hour’s work
would have finished the first job.
USELESS HAULS.
Bullet proof steel, manufactured
in Port Kembla, and rejected there,
has been sent by rail to Newcastle
where it was again rejected. May-
be it will travel elsewhere for fur-
ther inspection.
Annexes have been waiting for shell
steel, while large quantities have
been lying in stock at B.H.P. Steel
not so important have been given
priority in rolling.
Modern speedy machines have been
lying idle, whilst slower machines
have been given jobs, the completion
of which is of dire necessity.
TIME WASTED.
Tradesmen are forced to leave im-
portant jobs, chasing a foreman to
obtain a signed requisition for a few
nails or nuts and bolts in moulding
shops (8.H.P.). Half-a-dozen shovels
and rams are shared between over
50 moulders and their apprentices.
Shells made in N.S.W. and filled
in Victoria, and component parts
for tanks and other mechanical
equipment are made in various
parts of the Commonwealth. Some
factories finish their part of the
contract for bodies before others
have started to make the machines
necessary for their completion.
N.E.S. News
A.C.I. Management
Co-operates
In contrast with a number of
other factory managements,
Australian Consolidated Indus-
tries executive welcomes the co-
operation of the unions in an
endeavor to lift A.R.P. effici-
ency to 100 per cent.
It has already met one deputation
from two unions and has suggested
a further meeting with a deputation
to cover all unions.

Women’s Offer Rejected by
Warden
Answering the N.E.S. call for assist-
ance, Labor women in Waverley of-
fered their services to an official.
They were met with a blunt rejection.
There was no work for them, he
said. They should go home and look
after their children. The women sug-
gested a number of things they could
do. They even suggested they could
whitewash the guttering of the
streets, but the warden refused all
offers. Such wardens prevent the
N.E.S. from becoming fully efficient.
With the absence of most male
wardens from their homes during the
day, it is urgent that the women who
are at home be trained in N.E.S. work
to meet any daytime emergency.
★ ★ ★
Shop Committees Ignored
In a number of factories in the
Redfern-Rosebery area, managements
are getting ahead with A.R.P. ar-
rangements. Committees are oper-
ating in most of them. These com-
mittees, however, are appointed by the
bosses; in some cases are made up
entirely of staff and office workers.
Many of these people are sincere
helpers, but others are just stooges,
with absolutely no prestige among
the majority of the employees.
The leaders of Workers, the practical
men who would be of great use in a
raid, or in the technical side of A.R.P.,
the shop delegates and shop com-
mittees, have been completely ignored.
Australian Glass Manufacturers
and Austral Bronze managements are
among the worst offenders.

Air Raid Trenches Should be
Covered
Air raid trenches in parks are pro-
viding children with much fun —and
some danger. Kiddies in Redfern and
Surry Hills literally swarm in and out
of them. An accident has already oc-
curred in Surry Hills. A small child
fell in and broke his leg.
Open trenches are not only a dan-
ger to children. In a raid they give
no protection against falling shrap-
nel from ack-ack fire. All trenches
should be timbered and covered. They
should also be properly drained, as a
heavy fall of rain might even result
in drowning tragedies.
AT POOLE & STEEL.
The Shop Committee at Poole &
Steel have formed A.R.P. squads, and
an ambulance squad is in practice.
Now, in all the matter of first aid,
all fire hydrants have been allotted
a squad, their position numbered. An
air raid shelter is in course of com-
pletion. Sand boxes are being made
and filled for use in dealing with
incendiary bombs.
In the interest of conservation of
water, the shop committee have asked
the management to instal a large
tank to catch rain from the main
roof. There is also a simple cool-
ing system at each drinking tap. We
find that where a length of pipe is
exposed to heat, men allow water to
rim until it becomes cool.
Water Famine
SACK THE WATER
BOARD!
What’s Become Of
Cooper Report ?
Daily the water position gets
worse. The picture is one of
utter confusion. lon Idriess has
made some significant observa-
tions. Dr. Bradfield has put for-
ward a plan. The meteorolog-
ical records and other figures
speak for themselves.
The Cooper Report was a warning
ignored, an opportunity lost. The pub-
lic needs to know 1 more of the Cooper
Report facts. The position now is
such that the health and defence of
Australia are seriously threatened.
While we do not urge the blind ac-
ceptance of any scheme, the Snowy
River scheme has much to commend
it. If immediately commenced, it
would take a long time to complete.
It, or some other scheme, should have
been started long before the drought
had run seven long and devastating
years.
Planning and Action.
To-day, because of the red tape,
the lack of planning and sheer in-
competence, it would require average
rainfall for the next five years before
the water shortage were remedied.
Consider what this means in terms
of healtli, production and defence
needs, in terms of food, stocks, etc.
Those responsible must be dismissed
and immediate and efficient planning
—and action —begun.
During the rains, millions upon mil-
lions of gallons poured over the War-
ragamba Weir to the sea, wasted, and
still nothing is done. There is another
angle. Of revenue collected by the
Water Board for 1938, amounting to
£2,783,000, no less than £1,540,000 went
in interest. Thirteen shillings in the
pound.
Waste must be stopped. But re-
strictions do not replace water.
Action, planned and efficient, must
be taken now. ’
WATER WASTAGE.
Approximately twelve gallons per
minute are wasted twenty-four hours
daily at the Redfern Ice-making
plant. The water flows through the
cooling packets of the compressors.
It could be re-circulated, prevent-
ing all waste. This is true of hun-
dreds of similar cases.
