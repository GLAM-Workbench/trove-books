Wattle Blossom.
Eventide.
So dreary was the day, but now
The length’ning shadows fall,
A gentle sense of restfulness
Steals softly over all.
The aged mother sits alone,
And thinks of by-gone days,
Her soft grey hair illumined by
The sun’s departing rays.
She sees once more a happy home,
Where peace and plenty reigned ;
No discord there—all harmony,
And love that never waned ;
While she herself was Queen of all,
And ruled with gentle sway
Her willing subjects. None to her
Were half so dear as they.
The picture was so bright and fair,
Her eye in memory dwelt
So fondly, lovingly thereon,
As if again she felt
The kiss of husband on her brow,
Or heard wee Nellie’s shout
Of laughter, as she ran to watch
Jack turn his horses out.


But to this earthly Paradise,
With soft and sinuous grace,
The tempter came. At first Ja:k frowned,
'I hen turned a smiling face.
“ What harm is in a little drop?
I’ll take it like a man.”
But what that little ended in—
Oh ! tell it if you can.
In vain his father speaks of shame,
II is voice he scarcely hears :
Disgraced, degraded, till at last
A felon’s cell he fears.
At dead of night he steals away
To seek a foreign shore,
And little recks he that to some
His last farewell is o’er !
The poor old mother droops her head,
As if she lived again
Those weary years of anxious dread,
So full of silent pain.
The bitt’rest tears in life are those
We may not, dare not shed ;
And fraught with anguish all too keen
The “ Good-bye ” never said.
She saw wee Nellie growing pale,
And weaker, day by day,
Till hope died out within her heart.
Her darling might not stay


To be her help and comforter,
And stroke her father’s brow,
To drive away the look of care
So often seen there now.
Dear little Nell! When spring-time came
Her face was white and wan,
Dark circles were beneath her eyes,
Her pretty colour gone.
Her hand is in her father’s now,
Her head is on his breast.
As they together watch the sun
Sink slowly down to rest.
‘ Oh ! Daddie mine ! ” she softly says,
“ Our Jack will come some day,
I am quite certain that he will,
But I shall be away.
And will you please just tell him, Dad,
That little Nellie said
She always loved dear brother Jack ?
Now put me in my bed.
“ And call dear Mummie here. My head
Feels very strange to-night.
Please bring the lamp—its getting dark,
And oh ! I love the light.
Just say ‘Our Father’ once again,
And sing ‘ Abide with Me,’
Then talk about that wondrous Heaven,
Where Nellie soon will be.


“ Was tl.at a tear I felt ? Oh, Mum !
You must not look so sad.
I always feel so tired here.
But there I shall be glad :
For Jesus takes the little lambs,
And folds them to His 1 reast.
No sickness in that Land - no pain,
Just peace and perfect rest.”
A few days passed, and little Nell,
Was laid beneath the sod ;
Her sweet child-spirit left its clay,
And winged its way to God.
And ere another year had flown,
Her father, too, was dead.
“ Bereft of child, and husband too,”
T hq lonely woman said.
T he chair rocked slowly to and fro,
The old grey head was bent,
The poor thin hands but lightly clasped
For life was nearly spent.
The shrunken lips gave utterance low,
“ Could I but hear my Jack
Say, Lord I wandered far away,
But Thou hast brought me back.”
Whose step is that outside the gate ?
Who comes up to her chair,
And kneels before her, takes her hand
With words of whispered prayer ?


“ Mother ! forgive your erring son,
Oh ! speak but once again,
And say you love your wayward Jack
Though he has caused you pain.’
“My boy ! my boy ! I knew you’d come
To close your mother’s eyes,
I’m dying, Jack ! but we shall meet
Beyond these fading skies.
I fain would stay a little while.
Now that I have my son,
But angel spirits beckon me
My race is nearly run.”
She lay upon her pillow white
When morning sunbeams shone.
A heavenly smile was on her brow,
The wrinkles almost gone.
All earthly cares were left behind,
’Twas light at Eventide,
God’s likeness was upon l.er face,
And she was satisfied.


Daylesford
Oh could I sing, I’d sing to-day
Of Daylesford—Land of sunny ray !
In sweetest strains my tongue should tell
Of mountain height and sheltered dell;
Of springs, where healing waters flow,
Of gardens, where rare blossoms grow.
Mt. Franklin lifts his stately head,
And shows where once was lava bed ;
With “ Lady Franklin ” at his side
So coyly nestling, like a bride,
Telling each heart on pleasure bent,
Where happy holidays are spent.
Oh ! if the Trentham Falls could say
How many thousands wend their way
And silent stand enthralled to see
Such wild majestic scenery—
They’d cry, to toilers in the city,
“ In me behold felicity.'’
The rippling Loddon curves and frets
With rocky Falls, and sparkling jets ;
And on its banks—picture idyllic—
The spot on all the earth to picnic,
The greensward spreads a carpet soft,
While drooping willows wave aloft.


Entranced by music, mirth and song,
The lazy fishes glide along :
W hile from the hills the shots resound
W’here game in plenty may be found :
And through the trees “ The Glen ” is seen,
A fit abode for Fairy Queen.
Could I but stand on Wombat Hill,
And view the glorious landscape, till
One spark of true poetic fire
From pen might flow ; and, rising higher,
Spread to one sheet of flame, and light
A world of longing for the sight
Of lovely Daylesford-—(passing sweet
To those who seek a safe retreat
From ever carking care and pain)
With countless myriads in its train,
That flame should streatch from near and far,
From Southern Cross to Polar Star,
Till praise of thee from every mouth,
Thou Baden-Baden of the South.


The Woman of Canaan.
Her little one fell sick. The mother’s heart,
Bleeding and torn with anguish at the sight
Of her child’s sufferings, cried aloud to God
To ease her darling’s pain, or let her die.
One came and told her : “ Lo! there lives a Man
Who healeth all diseases—the blind and dumb,
Halt, leprous, paralytic, with a word.”
Into her eyes arose the wild, glad light
Of hope. Without a thought of questioning
She started on her journey, and rested
Not; till, footsore, worn and weary, she came
Unto the house where Jesus was. The Lord,
With toil and care weighed down, was fain to rest
But no, the crowd of sick and suffering ones
Came surging on, and first among them, she
Whose little daughter lay with devils spent.
Unheeding then the proud and scornful looks
Of those who would have stayed, she knelt down,
With broken, yearning cry before His feet—
“ Oh, Son of David ! Hear! Have mercy too !
My little child, my daughter dear, is with
A devil sorely vexed.” But to her plea
He answered not one word. Impatient then
Grew His disciples ; loud their voices rose ;
“ Send herr'away—she crieth after us.”
Gently the Healer spoke : “lam not sent
Save unto the lost sheep of Israel.”


Then nearer still she drew, and clasped her hands
About His knees, with soulful, pleading eyes,
While rose the bitter wail: “ Oh, Lord ! lam
The most unworthy, yet, dear Lord, help me”
Camly He gazed upon her face and said
“ It is not meet to give the children’s bread
To dogs.” Into her heart there came a gleam
Of hope. He to herself had spoken, and
He did not chide. The mother-love welled up
Within her breast, as, with a mighty strain,
She clasped His hand more tightly in her own,
And, smiling faintly through her tears, she said,
With deep humility : “ Thy Word is Truth,
And yet the dogs do sometimes eat of crumbs
That from beneath the children’s table fall.”
Then did the holy face light up with love,
The gentle voice in soothing accents fell—
“ Great is thy faith, and it shall be to thee
Just as thou wilt. Thy daughter is made whole.”
With eyes o’erflowing to her feet she rose,
One rapturous glance of thanks, and she was gone
Forgetting all the weariness and pain
In the wild tumult of her new-born joy,
With eager, beating heart and hurried step
So full of hope and trustful happiness,
Homeward she sped, unheeding sights and sounds,
Till her eyes feasted on her darling child
In calm and healthful slumber on the bed.


Mysie's Home-coming.
1 he shades of night are falling fast, the birds have gone
to rest,
Alone the curlew sits and cries, with mournful note
unblest.
And I am tired, tired, mother, and fain would lay my head
Down in the lonely churchyard, among the silent dead.
Do you remember, mother mine, the day I left your
home ?
Left the dear old Fatherland in foreign clime to roam ?
Oh ! I was happy, happy then, my heart was full of
pride ;
For was not John, my dearest love, standing by my side ?
“ Good-bye,” you said, “my dariing. May your life be
free from care,
No sorrow such as I have seen, e’er whiten that fair hair.
May heaven’s sunshine rest on you and him you truly
love,
If never more to meet on earth, we’ll meet in heaven
above.”
And then we sailed to Austral’s shore, my husband dear
. and I,
The land where golden wattles bloom, 'neath blue and
sunny sky,
With constant, thoughtful, watchful love, he soothed each
little care; ..
Ah ! how much joy and happiness came in that one short
year !


God knows it is not good for us too much of peace to
know ;
’Tis best to lie at Jesus’ feet, tho’ sorrow keep us low.
’Tis for our good He chastens us, but oh ! how hard it
seems
To wake in bitter pain and woe after blissful dreams.
One evening as we sat and talked of coming joys and fears,
John’s loving arm encircled me, his hand dried up my
tears.
“ Cheer up, wee wifie, God is good, our times are in His
hand,
He will guide and keep us safely till we reach the Better
Land.”
’Twas thus he spoke, then up he rose, he to his work
must go,
A miner works by night or day, and ’twas his shift below,
One loving kiss he gave me, a sweet, sad legacy,
Thank God we did not part in strife or enmity.
Oh, mother ! pen can write no more, what words can
paint my grief ?
My own dear love, my darling pride—-why was his life
thus brief?
“ Killed by a fall of earth.” ’Twas thus the verdict ran
Oh ! cruel, cruel mother earth, to slay so true a man.
They told me how they bore him hence, and laid him in
his grave,
Whilst I, with fever tossing, kept calling some to save ;


Then they brought a tiny blossom, a little fair-haired
child,
A minister of joy to ease my heart with sorrow wild.
Oh, mother ! then, and not till then, I knew a mother’s
love,
Alas! the flower soon faded, and to earth returned my
dove.
Was ever sorrow such as mine ? My little child, my pet;
Sad as my heart had been before, it made me sadder yet.
I long to lay me down and rest, this world seems full of
care,
’Tis hard to see above the cloud, the line of silver rare;
My heart is throbbing, aching sere, my head is full of
pain,
Perhaps ’twould ease the smart to see your dear old face
again.
So, mother dear, I’m coming home—home to your faith-
ful breast,
To stay with you till Jesus calls the weary one to rest;
For I am tired, tired, mother, and fain would lay my head
Down in the lonely churchyard, among the silent dead.


A Plea for the Poor.
Your Christinas gift ! What shall it be
To the Holy Child who was born for thee
Who bore such agony and woe ;
Died, lived—that you Heaven’s bliss might kno.v
He is not here. I cannot go
And at His sacred feet bend low ;
Bearing an offering, rich and sweet—
Such for the Master would be meet.
Hear now His words : “ The poor are here,
And always will be.” Ah ! too near ;
Turn not that dainty head aside,
Do not that ragged form deride.
I am not rich ; my cares are great;
Let those who live in kingly state
Give precious gifts. My little mite
Would count for nothing in His sight.
List! “ Inasmuch as unto these,
Even so to Me.” Kind words will ease
The sorest heart; the bitterest tear
Is dried when loving hands are near.
I have no time ; my hands are tied,
With children ever at my side ;
Why should I feel for others’ woes ?
I work from daybreak to its close,


No time is lost through kindness wrought,
Hearts are made sad from want of thought;
So on this merry Christmas Day
Make one child happy—one, I pray.


To-morrow.
To morrow, dear, 10-morrow,
I am 100 tired to talk of work to-night,
My he..d aches with the noise and clang < f this world’s
din,
Sweet thoughts have flown away and bitterness creeps in,
I'erhaps they will return, with morning light
To-morrow, dear, to-morrow.
To-morrow, child, to-morrow,
I know that thou art cold and hungry now,
Those little eyes are red with weeping all the day,
But sickness, cold, and hunger, all will flee awmy
When father’s ship sails o’er the ocean’s brow
To-morrow, child, to-morrow.
To-morrow, love, to-morrow,
Nay, weep not so, nor look so pale with fear,
I weary now, but soon the promised rest will come,
My Father’s loving voice will gently call me home
\\ hen morning comes, you may not find me here,
To-morrow, love, to morrow.
To-morrow, boy, to-morrow,
Don’t dream to-day, but work with vigor on,
With valiant heart and hand, fight nobly for the right,
Nor dream of taking rest, till presses on the night,
Then count the gloiious victories you have woq
Tp morrow, boy, to-morrow,


To-morrow, when’s to-morrow ?
Says little May, of scarcely summers three,
“ You said to me last night, that when I went to bed, .
And on the pillow white, I laid my little hea 1
That I should sleep and wake, and it would be
To-morrow. When’s to-morrow?”
To-moriow, ah, to-morrow,
Enough of joy, enough of sorrow’s clasp
Come> to each human heart with every fleeting day.
Up now, and work for God, morn, noon and evening pray,
An Allwise Hand keeps ever in His grasp
To-morrow, yes, to-morrow.


In Memoriam.
Dear Mother! Nevermore
Shall I address thee thus in human form :
Thy soul still lives, thy body silent lies
With yonder worm.
Too late the message came
That thou wert passing from this troubled sphere.
Death waited not for me to say “ Good-bye,”
My mother dear.
I saw thee cold and still,
Upon thy face a look of peace serene;
And then I thought of what thou wert, and what
I might have been.
Thou wert a mother wise
With a stern sense of duty, love combined,
To bring your children up in ways of truth
Was bent you mind.
Mother ! thy toil is o’er,
Thy hands lie folded on thy peaceful breast;
So till the summons comes for one and all
Dear Mother! Rest.
B


The Silver Wedding Day.
On! feanie, lass! How time slips by,
’Tis five and twenty years
Since on your hand I put the ring,
’Midst blushes, smiles and tears.
Right proud was I for all the world
To see my winsome bride,
So shyly, yet confidingly,
She kept her husband’s side.
No grey hairs, then, my darling one,
No wrinkles on your brow ;
But dearly as I loved you then,
I hold you dearer now.
A faithful wife and helpmeet too,
Socthing in sorrow’s hour—
Alas ! that some so lightly prize
A loving woman’s power !
Do you remember our first tiff
About a dress you wore ?
I said that you were very proud,
You said I was a bore.
There followed sulky looks and tears
For nearly a whole day,
It seemed to me those leaden hours
Would never crawl away.


But evening came and with it peace,
You gave in first you know—
You didn’t ? Well I think you cid
But you shall have it so.
I only know ’twas sweet to feel
Those dear hands on my brow,
And then the sweet, forgiving kiss,
I think I feel it now.
Of sorrows we have had our share,
Stern grief will have a day.
Our lovely boy, our first-born child,
Too soon he passed away.
The house seemed oh ! so lonely then,
So very, very still—
With breaking heart you bowed you head
And said “ It is God’s will.
God has been very good to us,
And sent us children dear,
Bright, rosy, laughing boys and girls,
Their parents’ home to cheer ;
But our first-born child awaits us—
An Angel ’midst the Blest,
“ Where the wicked cease from troubling.
And the weary are at rest.”
We’re not so young as once, Jeanie !
We watch our children grow,
We see in them our faults again,
Perhaps some virtues too.


Iltaven guide and keep them safely when
We both are called away ;
Keep our darling-; pure and holy,
Keep them ;rom sin we pray.
And when God sends His angels bright
To beckon you or me,
May we be not divided long.
Our life of harmony
Must needs bi severed for a while
But scon we’ll meet again,
Wheie serrow has no part, dear wife,
For joy’s eternal reign.


Eric.
Stooping one day by the fireside, I paused with my hand
on the brush,
As a host of bitter-sweet memories came over my heart
with a rush.
Amid the bright glowing embers was blazing a large
empty reel,
And tears of passionate longing to my sad, weary eyes
did steal.
Once again I beheld on the hearthrug my bonnie wee
baby boy,
Laughing and crowing with innocent glee over his
newest toy ;
With sticks and reels we made him a cart to drive “gee-
gee ” like daddie,
How he laughed when his tins toppled over, the sweet
little laddie 1
Oh, Eric, Eric, my darling 1 will the yearning never
grow less
For one look of love from those dear, dark eyes, one
clinging, close caress ?
Oh ! if but for one short hour I might strain thee to my
breast!
But, little blossom, God holds thee, and I own that His
care is best.


What though I kneel on the hearthrug, and pray for
strength to be brave
In fighting the battle of life, till its sorrows end in the
grave ?
Don’t I know that my sweet angel bairnie is safe in the
Heavenly fold,
Where the walls are built of precious stones and the
streets are shining gold.


Here and There.
Here a little toiling - ,
’Neath the summer sun ;
There the full fruition,
“ Faithful one, well done.”
Here the burden bearing,
Souls for Christ to win ;
There, with jewels sparkling,
Waits the diadem.
Here a little groping,
Praying for the light ;
There eternal sunshine,
Faith dissolved in sight.
Here a little heartache,
A sobbing, trembling sigh ;
There God Himself shall wipe
The tear from every eye.
Here a little scorning,
Bitter thoughts and strife ;
There he that overcometh
Shall wear a crown of life.
Here a few sad partings,
Smothered sobs of pain ;
There the links united
Make one perfect chain,


Here a little waiting,
Tired heart and hand ;
There the rest remaineth
For God’s chosen band.
Oh ! tender, pitying Father
From evil keep Thine own,
Till, white-robed, sinless, holy,
We bow before Thy throne.


The Little Queen.
Into a dingy room ran a barefoot, ragged child,
Her auburn hair was streaming in tresses long and wild
“ Mother,” she cried, “ a lady passed, and oh ! what did
she mean ?
She stroked my hair and kindly said * Good-day my little
Queen ’
“ Yes, she said ‘ Little Queen ’ to a dirty child like me,
So ragged, untidy, and not fair to see ;
With a smile from her eyes so bright and so keen,
She took my hand and kindly said ‘ Good-day my little
Queen.’
“You used to kiss me once, but now you scold and beat
instead,
And many times, when hungry, do I wish that I were dead;
But, to-day, the lady paused, with lovely smile serene,
And in tones like sweetest music said ‘ Good-day my little
Queen.’ ”
All night the child lay tossing, with feverish restless eyes,
Her thoughts too often turning to the Home beyond the
skies,
She spoke of angels fair and bright, of glorious things
unseen,
And said, “ I wonder up in Heaven shall I be called a
Queen.”


A few days more, the tired eyes were closed in death’s
long sleep,
The mother turned her head away, nor once was seen to
weep;
But the angels gladly welcomed home the weary one to
rest,
And her childish treble mingled with the sweet songs of
the blest.
Oh, Mothers! rich and poor, your children need your
loving care,
You little know how fragile-sweet these heaven-sent
flow’rets are
Don’t wound the loving, tender heart, nor crush the little
mind,
The little ones in “ Mother ” should always sweetest
comfort find.
Sow gentle words and kindly deeds along the thorny
road,
Do all the good you can for them, and leave the rest
to God ;
Your mission is the noblest this trouble-worn world holds,
The training up for God these precious infant souls.


Ail Desperandum.
1 sat beneath a willow tree
Rebellious, wrathful, sore,
My life seemed full of misery,
My cup of woe ran o'er.
I thought of all I had to bear,
Chastisings, losses, pain,
When soft there floated thro’ the air,
Like Angel’s sweet refrain—
“ Trouble comes and trouble goes,
Why should I complain ?
If now the sun be hid with clouds,
’Twill surely shine again.”
I looked around, above, below,
Nor human form could see,
It surely came from heaven above,
’Twas sent to comfort me.
And o’er my spirit soon there stole
A sense of sweet relief,
The burden seemed not half so great,
The words had soothed my grief.
Upright I sprang with lighter heart,
Consoled, refreshed and glad
That God had not forsaken me,
Tho’ but a little lad,


With firmer tread I hastened on,
And suddenly espied
A tiny, dainty, fairy form,
Who sang with childish pride.
Years have rolled on, my hair is white,
My sands have nearly run,
Yet I can ne’er forget the day,
The singer, nor the song.
And tho’ her voice is weaker now,
Her love is still the same ;
My wife, my comfort, sings for me
The dear old sweet refrain—
“ Trouble cames, and trouble goes,
Why should I complain ?
If now the sun be hid with clouds
’Twill surely shine again.”


Three Pictures.
A word —a touch—a look—a tone—
Love comes and sits upon her throne.
Spring blossoms peep ; wee birdies trill;
Sunlight dances o’er vale and hill.
To-day, a smile: next, th’ averted eye ;
A sudden chili —a whispered Why ?
A touch of pride—a lifted head ;
“God be with him,” she softly said
Rich Autumn tints - life’s golden grain :
Hands clasped, no more to part again,
Remembered vows; fulfilment meet
Forgotten now the bitter-sweet.


A Twilight Story.
Bring out my chair, little Nellie, put it under the wattle
tree,
I’m weary of staying indoors, child, come here and talk
to me.
Talk of the dear old days, Nellie, when faith and hope
were so bright,
But, ah ! I forgot —’tis your mother, not you, I’m thinking
about to-night.
Let me look at your face, little Nellie, smooth back the
curls from your brow,
Ah ! your eyes are so like your mother s, and she is in
heaven now :
Bright, shining eyes, never afraid to look at you through
and through,
For she had no sin to hide, little Nellie, no shadow of
aught untrue,
You’re wanting a story to-night, Nellie ? Child, my stories
are nearly all told :
I can almost see the bright city, with its streets of
shining gold,
I can almost hear the children, with their laughing
frolicksome glee,
But I must cress the river first, though it has little dread
for me,


Years ago, years ago, little Nellie, I was not much older
than you,
I had a fond love, my Willie, so handsome, manly and
true.
’Twas always sunshine where Willie was, for he carried
it in his heart;
Do you know the reason, dear Nellie ? He had chosen
the better part.
He promised to take me one evening for a stroll by the
riverside,
We had so much to talk of, Nellie, I soon was to be his
bride ;
But I watched and I watched, and he came not, till angry
I turned away,
Vowing I'd never forgive him-no, never, come what may.
Just as I turned to go home, Nellie, I saw mischievous
Alice Grey,
“ Is it Willie your wanting ? *’ laughed she, “just look
up the other way ”
I looked—not a word could I speak-for Willie stood
there,
Holding fast, with encircling arm, a maiden tall and fair.
Oh, quickly I ran to my home, and fast I bolted the door,
And I wept and I mourned for my Willie, now lost for
evermore :
Sorrows and tears and sighs are sent by the chastening
Hand above,
But the hardest thing in life, Nellie, is to lose faith in one
you love.


“ Good-bye, my love ! for never may I feel thy warm
hand-clasp again,’'
(I wrote it firmly, Nellie, tho’ my heart wds racked with
pain),
“ So, true, so brave, I thought you, but now alas ! I find
My idol was all clay, fit only for man’s foot to grind.”
I sent the cruel letter, child. Thank God ! it never
reached his eye,
For ere the twilight shadows fell, my love was brought
home to die :
Tust one false step, and headlong down the open shaft he
fell,
And when help came, he whispered low, “ Carry me to
little Nell.”
And as I watched beside him, the life blood slowly ebbed
away,
In broken gasps he faltered out: “My love —my little
darling! May
We meet where partings are no more—beside the great
white throne —
My widowed bride —God comfort thee—Nellie! my own !
my own!”
I used to sit and listen for his foot-fall on the fl jor,
’Twas long before I realised that he would come no more ;
So lonely" seemed the sad, sad hours, the weary years
dragged by,
He had been all the world to me, no kith nor kin had L


At eventide I often sought the place of Willie’s rest,
To place upon his silent grave the flowers he loved the
best,
And once, in turning homeward, I saw one who mourn-
ing wore,
She turned her sweet, sad face to me —l had seen it once
before.
My breath came hard, I grasped her arm—“ Tell me,
oh ! tell me true,
By all you hold most dear, what was the dead to you ? ”
“ The truest friend I had on earth,” she said in solemn
tone,
“ He showed me once, when sorely tried, that my life
was not my own.
“ A thoughtless, foolish, giddy girl, I had early left my
home
To wed against my parents’ wish. We soon were forced
to roam ;
At last when widowed, desolate, of all my friends bereft,
I looked around the cold, cold world—nought but my
child was left.
“ My child—l could not bear to hear her ask for bread I
could not give,
And some kind friend might cherish her when"her mother
ceased to live:
Thrice did I kiss my darling, then, with wild despairing
cry,
I hastened to the river’s brink, with a mind resolved to
die,
c


“ Ere I could take the fatal plunge a strong man held me
fast,
I struggled hard, but strength o’erpowering made me
desist at last.
He pointed out my wickedness, yet so kindly was his
tone,
Almost before I knew it, my story was his own.
“ He took me to some Christian friends, who food and
shelter gave,
And I never more was tempted to seek a coward’s grave,
For soon I learnt the blessedness of a Saviour’s priceless
love,
Now with patience I possess my soul, till called to
Heaven above.”
That was her story, Nellie—then she slowly turned away,
But I threw my arms around her—begged her with me
to stay.
“I, too, am very lonely, bring your child and live with
me,”
“ A little while,” she answered, then kissed me silently.
But all too swiftly, Nellie, sped the peaceful hours away,
The one I now so dearly loved, she had not long to stay,
And her sweet face clouded slightly when the Autumn
shadows fell,
As she whispered, “ When its over, who will care for
little Nell ? ”


“ Oh, hush, dear one ! ” I softly said, “your child shall
be my loving care,
Her childish prattle sounds like sweetest music in my
ear.”
Her smile gave thanks ; her spirit soon had reached the
great unknown,
To join the throng of ransomed ones around God’s
beauteous Throne.
And many happy years, Nellie, we’ve spent together, you
and I,
Now I’m just waiting for the message from my Father’s
house on high.
You’ll be a good, true wife to John, he’s waited patiently,
And I long to join my Willie—Nell! I can hardly see.
The morning came, and with it peace, the weary was at
rest,
Why should we mourn when Jesus calls to regions of the
blest;
Those who have borne the cross below, there to have
harp and crown,
With sins and sorrows washed away and burdens all laid
down.


Kismet
The Meeting.
Will he come to-night, to-night, I wonder,
In the twilight dim ?
Oh, silly heart ! why do you throb and start,
Just at thought of him ?
When the sun sinks slowly down to his rest
And the birds fly home,
Shall I hear his loved footsteps near the gate,
Telling he has come ?
Shall I feel the hot blush run o’er my face
As he takes my hand ?
Shall I know he is reading my fond heart ?
Will he understand ?
Will he hold me close, so close to his heart,
His heart—perchance mine ? N
Will those dear lips impress the sweet, warm kiss
That brings joy divine ?
Will the bright stars look down, and soft winds breathe
Love, tender and true ?
Will he tell to-night, to-night, I wonder
The sweet old tale, still new ?

The Parting.
Only a torturing hand-clasp,
Not a word by either spoken,
Only a tremulous eye-glance,
But he knew her heart was broken.


Only a face at the window,
A tearless, sorrowful eye,
Only a tired heart murmuring
“ God help us both —Good-bye ! ”
Only an outward-bound steamer,
A man sternly pacing the deck—
Is he seeking the Balm of Gilead ?
Or will his life be a wreck ?


No Vote.
I have no vote. Alack ! a-day !
That tyrant Man should hold such sway,
Deny us “ Women’s Rights,” and plead
“ The House” of women hath no need.
I have no vote. Oh, cruel fate !
I may not help to rule the State ;
Must politics avoid—and lend
A hand to wash and cook and mend.
I have no vote. Men will not meet,
With warmest hand-clasp, on the street,
And softly murmur in my ear,
“ You’ll vote for me, my dear, my dear ? ”
I have no vote, But lam Queen
Of richest kingdom ever seen.
The crown of Motherhood is mine,
I wear it as a gift Divine.
I want no vote. ’Tis better far
To be a voter’s guiding star.
To train our sons to love the Lord,
And rule their voting by His word.
I have not lived in vain, if I
Have influenced one man’s destiny
For good. As for my sons—God knows
What promises their future holds.


“ She hath done what she could.” So fell
The words from lips she loved so well,
What higher tribute could there be
To woman's loving ministry ?


She Would'nt.
Are you tired of work, dear heart ? No wonder ;
So many worries,
Bustles and flurries,
Like to tear body and soul asunder.
The day has been hot and close and dreary ;
You washed all the socks,
And mended the frocks,
And baby was cross; now you feel weary.
So weary, you fain would lie down and rest;
But more's to be done,
No rest ’neath the sun,
For mothers with eight little children blest.
Yes, I can do just as I please, my friend,
I walk at pleasure,
Or sit at leisure,
And dream all day from beginning to end.
I have no children to vex or tease me,
My floors are all clean,
No speck to be seen,
And everything just in place to please me.
You’d better lend me your Emily Jane,
I’d teach her to cook,
To sweep every nook.
Her board would be wages enough ’tis plain.


Or perhaps you’d rather I took wee Jack
He’d polish the knives,
Teaze cats out of lives,
But 1 fear he would soon be coming back.
It might be well to take Mary Ellen,
But she’s rather young,
My nerves would be unstrung,
If she for her mother went around yelling.
“No thank you, Miss Charity.” Is that what you say ?
See me far enough first ?
Of all creatures the worst
Is an ungrateful woman like you, so good-day.


Waiting for promotion.
To die in the Lord. ’Tis so sweet to know
Not for one hour shall I be left alone,
The valley of the shadow hath no dread,
For Thou art with me. Is the darkness gone ?
He will be always with me, The promise was
Never to leave nor forsake. Did He not say
Because I live, ye shall live ? Satisfied
I shall awake in His likeness. Is it day ?
I cannot realise even now that I
Shall be like Him, presented faultless there,
Before the Father. I, so full of sin,
Shall the pure, white robe of righteousness wear.
Only to think the Son of Heaven’s King
Gave His own blood that I might be forgiven,
And since His name on earth I feebly spoke,
He will acknowledge me to God in Heaven.
The “ little while ” He spoke of is over,
My life-work ended -sword and shield laid down.
Such a little service—what a rich reward!
I’m waiting for promotion, for the crown.
The sun is nearly set, the day is done,
I feel my Saviour near, and it is light.
Barth slowly fades, the shadows melt away,
’Tis Jesus, Jesus only— Friends, good-night!
These lines were suggested by words uttered by Rev. B. Rodda,
just before his death, September, 1895.
