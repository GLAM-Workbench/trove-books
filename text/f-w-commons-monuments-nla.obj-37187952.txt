A WRITER HAS SAID: “Against expenditure
in honor of the dead, Heaven has uttered no prohibition,
and earth is not injured but benefited by it.”
To obtain good value, there is a course open to the
public, viz., to entrust the work to an established firm
whose business has been steadily built up on the public
favor, and whose works, small as well as large, have stood
the tests of time and public criticism.
It has been truly said “ that attractive and beautiful
cemeteries assist our piety and promote the refinement
and elevation of society, whilst their influence exalts all the
faculties of the soul.
Whether your requirements consist of a simple
memento to mark the grave, or a highly sculptured family-
memorial, I guarantee the same careful and capable atten-
tion throughout, and at the lowest possible price consistent
with good material and workmanship.
Should you require any work done, call on us at
our Works, or, if more convenient to you, write us and
make an appointment, and one of our firm will wait on you
and give you all necessary' particulars.
I make no canvass for work.

Walton Memorial


Bronze
The accompanying Print will serve to convey the value of this metal.
Monograms. Letters, Celtic, Runic, and Norman Ornaments for
Crosses. Name Panels for Granite Kerbs, Bases, Panels, Figures, and
Mural Work in bronze, yellow brass, or oxidised metal supplied.
For anything you require, write.
It is surprising to note the erratic prices quoted for metal goods.
The mode of production may be answerable for this, which in many cases
is exorbitant, quite beyond the means to do business, and it frequently
occurs that the high cost is not accompanied with a satisfactory job.
The prices will be found reasonable, and the work embodying that
standard of finish that will please those who are always open to introduce
something new and good.
Sketches and Prices forwarded promptly on request, and if you
desire my assistance I am prepared to furnish plans.
Being under the impression that I am first to offer Bronze Plates
at first cost, under unique conditions.
Assuring you of my best service.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE
WORK OF
F. W. COMMONS
The accompanying Illustra-
tion serves to explain the utility
of the patent columns erected
at the Convent of Mercy, Bal-
larat East.
Estimates given for similar
construction, with the choice
of many figures in various
sizes.
I have a complete plant for
any work which can be carried
out to your own design.
Commons’ Patent.
This construction is simple
to assemble, easily and quickly
erected, and cannot be taken
apart. The elements will keep
it clean ; it is a permanent job.
