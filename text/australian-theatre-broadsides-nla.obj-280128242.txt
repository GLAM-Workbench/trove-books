“ Several volumes,” replied Bacon, in

“ Do you imagine a poor fellow like
you can have any ohauce o wit? such an

“ Well, I don’t know. Things look
rather favorable. Her mother withdrew
from the parlor at eleven o’clock last
night, leaving us alone.”
Jonesley—“ Coming around to my
golden wedding next week ?” Brown-
kins (indignantly)—“ Your golden wed-

Jonesley—“ No; but I’ve bagged an

Full of Ability : Father; “ I would like

Father (enthusiastically): “ Yes, in-

Little Bobby: “I pa, what’s a sanr

Mr. Hadaliver: “It’s a place where,

you were dead; and after you’ve been
there a month, you think you never were
alive before.”

Go Over to the Other Side.
He had determined to serve his country
and leave his practice at home, but met
with grievous remonstrance from his
mother.
“ I beseech you not to go to this war,
my son ! ” she pleaded, her soft eyes full
of tear*.
“ But I do not go to fight, mother,”
said the doctor cheerfully. “I am going
as a medical man. Surely there is no
harm in that.”
“ Well, well,” she said doubtfully, “go
then, if it must be so.” Then suddenly
a gleam of joy lit up her countenance.
She looked bravely into her son’s face
and said :
“If you find you kill more than you
cure, I advise you to go straightway over
to the other side, my son! ”

“ Certainly, if necessary.”
“Do you think they would believe

“ One of them would, I know.”
“ Ah, indeed. And why should he,
pray ? ”
“ Because he was present when I first
saw her. He was at the gate when I rode
up, and she put her head out ot the second-
storey window, and I said to her, ‘ How
d’ye do ? ’ ai d called out I’d be back to
supper in half an hour. I’m no giraffe ; ”
and everybody smiled except the barrister.
“ Evidently you were overlooked in the
account of the entertainment last night,’g
said the gossip.
“Oh, no,” replied Mrs. Newrich. “I
was mentioned. Didn’t you see the last

“ Yes. It read ‘ and others.’ ”
“ That s me,” asserted Mrs. Newrich

Thus an American paper.— The tele-
graph companies of Australia suffer a
good deal from the fondness of the
natives for bracelets and ear and nose
rings made of telegraph wire.” All this
statement, by the way, is true, except
that there are no telegraph companies in
Australia, and that the few stray aborig-
inals to be found near telegraph lines
never dream even remotely of touching
the wires. The remainder of the state-
ment is quite correct, that is, if there is
any remainder.

A MARVELLOUS MACHINE.
The progress of modern invention is ever in the
direction of labor-saving appliances, and applied
mechanism is now capable of doing almost any-
thing hitherto done by hand. Writing machines
are amongst the most modern introductions,
and the march of improvement has manifested
itself most markedly in this direction. Abso-
lutely the very latest is the “ Elliott and
Hatch” Book Typewriter, a machine which
writes in books, addresses cards, labels or
envelopes, and conducts the ordinary corres-
pondence of professional and business men.
The writing in books is a feature not possessed
by any other typewriter. The principles of
construction are wonderfully simple, and no
limit is placed upon the size, binding or thick-
ness of the book to be used. Forms and
documents up to 18 x 23 inches can be written
upon over their entire surface. John Andrew
and Co., 13 Bridge-street, Sydney, are the
sole agents in Australia, and most cordially
invite inspection and examination of the
machines working in their showrooms.

Two East-enders were discussing the war news.
“ I say, Bill, who’s this ’ere Warren ? ”
“ Why,” said the other, “he was a copper once. Charlie
Warren, don’t you remember ? ”
The other reflected for a moment, then he said, medita-
tively :
“He never copped me. Which was his beat ? ”
“Were you really happier before you became civilised?”
asked the white man.
“ Well,” answered the Pacific Islander, “ I must say I
didn’t have all this worry about whether my trousers were
getting baggy at the knee.”
