It seemed that Petty had started drawing
babies when she was practically a baby herself;
and later, in the intervals of painting, and sing-
ing, and drawing joke pictures for the magazines,
she returned to babies as a man to his secret vice.
I grabbed them up and took them home.
Pinned up all over the room, they looked down
at me laughing babies, crying babies, naughty
babies and one revoltingly good one.
I wonder whether you'll be as thrilled with
these drawings as 1 was when first I saw them.
It was at the Paterson’s home which is
definitely unique that, meandering round the
house, I came across a drawing of a baby one
of the most delicious babies 1 had ever seen.
I demanded to be shown more babies and
more and more!


I moved them round till they got into some
sort of pattern Babies in the Country, Babies
by the Sea, Babies in Bed.
The more I looked at them, the more real they
became. I knew them all. They weren't just
drawings. They were babies, with real names
and personalities and stories. It was plain which
were boys and which were girls and who lived
where, and who did what. And, what's more,
their destinies were as an open book.
Betty's Babies Everybody's Babies arc
perfect.
If your baby is here in this book and un-
wittingly he—or she—has been traduced, don't
blame Betty. Blame me.


Everybody's baby wakes up differently.
Bettine, for instance, is a particularly
noisy waken She grizzles and stretches,
and throws everything possible on to the
floor. She seems to have a definite
grudge against this necessity for facing
a new day. Which is absurd. Because,
once she is around and about, she finds
living an interesting and satisfying
occupation. Awake, she is a gay adven-
turess; but in the early morning she shows
signs that the future husband of Bettine
should make arrangements to get up first.
Sfchani— -t
In striking contrast are
Barbara's reactions to the
sun's first rays. Fast asleep
she is and then suddenly
her eyes open wide, and
her mouth begins to curl
up in a smile. The sunrays
dance through the window
and her blue eyes dance
with them. It seems that
every morning she awakens
afresh to life, and finds it

George is a disgruntled waker. He doesn't thrash around like
Bettine, but his first expression is a scowl. Perhaps there is a reason
for this. Maybe his dreams have been spoilt by the sun in his
eyes. And who but George knows what dreams he had... or how
near they were to completion?
John is fond of food, and his
first thought is of the staff of baby
life. As at the moment it is not
forthcoming, he acts on the know-
ledge that fingers are a good
substitute. For a time at least. But
John’s mother knows that it is
unwise to delay feeding time
unduly in the early morning.

Small fingers do a multitude
of useful jobs in the world. There s
an infinite variety of purposes
for which these important
appendages to the baby frame
may be utilized.
faul regards them as toys, and, even while in the act of chewing,
he watches with intense admiration the positions into which his fingers go
almost the gymnastics of them. It is a study which fascinates and
never palls
As one grows older,
fingers become explorers.
Elaine uses hers for account-
ancy to check up on the
ever-growing collection of
teeth which are something
to marvel at. The application
of massage to the gums is
also effective, and insures
against undue complaint.

Tommy, though not yet endowed with the gift of
intelligible speech, finds that, rightly employed, his
fingers will do the talking for him. Here they are
seen assuring the world at large that it is useless
simply to plump him in his high chair. The matter
of Food is one of pressing importance.

According to Penelope, it
is on established fact that a
smooth, gaily-colored ring is
as effective as fingers in
staving off starvation. She is
one of those babies with the
inborn virtue of making the
best of a bad job, and in the
fullness of time will marry a
masterful man . . . and be
happy in the service.
No. so’Hazel. Hazel is tough
and demands what she
wants when she wants it. By
the strength of her personality,
and with the aid of the radio,
she has sold her maternal
parent on the idea that ice
cream is the health food of
the nation. But she is wrestling
with a doubt as to whether
anticipation in this particular
instance may have been
better than the freeze of
realization.

Cups are fascinating objects, with
limitless possibilities in their depths.
Dorothea is teetering at the brink,
but Dennis is prepared to drain his
cup and life —to the dregs.
Lan finds his drinking vessel an

Anne favors the couch in the lounge, as its
material is soft to the touch, and has a certain
piquant flavor which titillates the palate.
Mdchael, who is a he-man pure and simple, goes
to the great outback. Over the fence he can see
the next door hens with their chickens, and a ginger
cat chasing its tail. Yes. there are plenty of thrills

There are toys AND toys. Babies and their bigger and better brothers
and sisters take a poor view of the type of toy that Father regards as
quite an ingenious contraption, what” or that Mother describes as being
"too cute for words.”
Mothers and Fathers should be told once and for all that it is not parent-
love that prompts such purchases, but rather innate selfishness and lack of
understanding.
In David's
bicycling clown that Daddy
is winding up is a fearsome
and revolting thing. He
intends at once to return to
his ball, the rolling of which

happy, as soon as the irritating clown on wheels has whirred itself to a
standstill, to resume her entrancing occupation of squeezing the sawdust

considers it in the nature
of an insult that one

him. He is content to
ignore the thing, how-
ever, and to busy himself
with something really

process of deluging the
nursery floor with
sponge drops.
Is Robin a throwback
to some remote Chinese
ancestor? He is wedded
to his beads as the Oriental
merchant to his abacus.
Though he accepts inter-
ruption with a suave
politeness that gives color
to the throwback theory,
he will soon be back again
at his counting; “Ee, Erh,
San, 5ze...." His dog and
his ball will go unheeded
while the age-old counting
continues.

There's something about the country that cglls for a Back to Nature
approach. The flapdoodle of Town life must be abolished without delay.
Gay and her twin sister Joy begin by removing their footwear. Socks
will follow, for grass crunches in fascinating fashion under bare feet.
Freda is intent on a mys-
terious rite: "He loves me, he
loves me not,’ Of course he
does —of course he will. Born
to be a hausfrau, Freda at the
moment is a phlegmatic
young person who bides her
time. She is a tubby baby, and
she will be a cushiony
woman. Everything she wants
will come to her but her

Kim is and always will be a dreamer. But, tor
all his dreaming, he is a young gentleman of strong
character and deep seated grey matter. A dual
personality . . . with idealism always striving for

Norman is bom to command. He already realises
his power over a doting father and mother, and
smiles without undue enthusiasm when people in
buses say; "What a beautiful child." He knows he
is a beautiful child, and is out to trade on it. Rather
an unpleasant creature, Norman, though by his
very success he will make people oblivious of
the fact.


Sandra wants to know
the whys and wherefores
of everything. Even if you
gave her a watch, she
would spend the minimum
of time listening to its
ticking, before busying
herself finding out why it
ticks and how. Essen-
tially feminine in her
allure, Sandra possesses
more than her share of
traits usually attributable
to the male. It will be
interesting to follow her
choice of a career.
Noel knows how to get
anything whether it be
a Christmas stocking
worthy of his name, or his
father’s pen-knife. He is a
born actor, of course, and
as soon as he acquires
the fruits of his perform-
ance he will assume the
mask of innocence and
amiability.


Bronwyn is a thinker. Not a quick thinker —rather
an assimilator. Once she knows a thing she knows
it for all time. She’s not obstinate ... not exactly ...
but what she knows she knows. She is tempera-
mentally sound, and eventually rule the marital
roost with a rod swathed in velvet.

Going down to the sea in ships is an old story. The very young go
in prams, push-carts, buses with an occasional Rolls-Royce. But
their reactions are much the same, whatever the mode of transport.
Alan is of the stuff of
which archaeologists are
made. What tomb of the
Pharoahs could yield any
treasure greater than the
discovery of water under
sand? It is a miracle
and a miracle to be
savored to the full.
Dick and Dawn —more twins —are content to marvel at the wonder
of the sea itself. Blue, white, grey, green . . . ever-changing colors rioting
before their eyes. Surely this tremendous expanse of Movement has
everything the baby sight could desire?


Old -stagers like Guy and his friend Reggie
are not content merely to look. They must see,
touch and feel. When a chap can undress himself,
prior to striding without adult supervision into the
turbulent waves, then he is a man indeed.

There goes Tod, paddling
away and watching out with
care for any sharp rock or
shell. He's a careful cuss, is
young Tod, and believes in
hurrying slowly.
There is the matter of heat,
too, to be considered.
Janet is finding that sun
on the back of the neck can
be too much of a good thing.
She is a bit sick, too, of doing
the spade work while her
elders cavort in the waves.
Her elders? Even her
youngers.
Esther prides herself on
thinking first of others ... and
of course Teddie comes first
of all. Poor Teddie. in his
thick coat. But she knows by
experience that a shower
bath is the most he can take
without damage to his figure.

That smile of ecstacy on
the face of Diana proves
her to be the huntress she is.
Behind there in the waves,
struggling and spluttering,is
her brother—two years older
too whom she has “hap-
pened" to trip up. A moment
of glory this, a just retri-
bution for indignities she
has suffered in the past.
Last, an etiquettish re-
minder to Winifred. Towels
are for drying the person...
and. if no handkerchief is
available, a sniff will do.
From the corner of her eye,
Winifred obviously looks for
this reproof at which she
will only laugh.

FI arold is endeavoring to retain
a pleasant and dignified express-

doubt as to whether outsize blue
ribbon bows are in accordance
with his status as Man of the

humored: and, though the bows
are large, the matter is too small
to be worthy of a scene.

Though Harold may be one
of those chaps who take things
in their stride. Guy believes in
voicing his feelings. He dislikes
his bonnet, he loathes his bib, and
he fails to see why he should be
dressed up like a sore toe and still
kept in bed! And, what's more, he
wants the world to know it.

Yvonne is a chewer.
What other use is ribbon,
anyway? It’s got a funny
taste, though . . . and the
fingers become unpleas-

may develop.
The dernier cri in
gardening fashions is here
displayed by William
Bill to you. Proudly he
goes forth to conquer
slugs that slither and
worms that wriggle. This

men, and will wipe out the
stigma attached to his
long hair and his dimples.
