PREFACE.
A first attempt to analyse a language of which the
people themselves who speak it have only a practical
knowledge, and who are, consequently, incapable of
answering, or even comprehending, grammatical ques-
tions, must, under any circumstances, be in many respects
imperfect; more especially must it be so in the present
instance, where, from the wandering habits of the
people, and our want of adequate means to induce them
to remain with us for any length of time, it is im-
possible to maintain that constant communication with
them which would be requisite towards attaining a
complete knowledge of the structure of their language.
In addition to these considerations, the shortness of the
time I have been amongst them (only two years and a
few months) must necessarily be another source of
imperfection.
The following sheets, therefore, do not profess to
contain either a complete Vocabulary, or a perfect
Grammar, I hope, at some future period (should Ibe
spared), to be able to furnish a complete development


of the structure of this language, and a Vocabulary
which shall contain all (or nearly all) the words—which
probably do not amount to more than from three to
four thousand.
It remains for me to state the reasons which have
induced me, at the present moment, to give publicity to
the following pages.
Several persons have, from time to time, expressed a
wish to see something of this language, respecting
which, by reason of its great difference, not only in the
grammatical forms, but also in the radicals of the
words, from the language spoken by the natives in the
vicinity of Adelaide, the Grammar and Vocabulary
published by my friends Messrs Teichelmann and
Schumann gives no information whatever. His
Excellency the Governor also expressed a wish to the
same effect.
I, in consequence, commenced arranging the ma-
terials I already possessed, in which work I have not
such a knowledge of the English as would enable me
to express myself correctly upon all occasions. 1
should not have been able to use the English language,
had not my friend Mr Lindsay, to whom I take the
opportunity of returning my thanks, most readily
assisted me upon this point.
Some defects of arrangement may probably be
discovered, and upon several points further information
VI


is desirable. They, however, contain all that lat
present know of the language. The Vocabulary has
been carefully compiled, the whole having been twice
reviewed with different natives, so that the meaning
assigned to the words may be relied upon as correct.
I submit these sheets to the public with the hope
that they may be found useful to such as may be
desirous of forming some acquaintance with the
Aboriginal Dialects, and that they will be interesting
to the philosopher and philologist, as exhibiting the
peculiar structure of a language spoken by a people
very generally considered the lowest in the scale of
civilization.

CHAPTER I.
OF THE CHARACTERS TAKEN TO REPRESENT THE SOUNDS
OF THE LANGUAGE, AND THEIR PRONUNCIATION.
1. The following characters have been adopted to re-
present the sounds of this language
* The sound represented by “ ng” in the English language is of fre-
quent occurrence in the Australian dialects, both at the beginning and end
of syllables, but it is a simple sound, and not formed by the coalescence
of “ n” and “g” ; although it is here represented by these two characters
for want of a better, there being no type foundries in this Province
whereat to get a proper character cast, viz., an “n” with the last stroke
lengthened—to which letter it is closely related, being the guttural nasal
corresponding to the labial and dental nasals “m” and “n.” When the
ng is long, it is indicated by a stroke over the n, thus, hg.
B


2. Vowels.
FIGURE. POWER.
A a ain are, father
E e ein there
I i iin tin
0 o oin bone
U u oin move, or uin full.
3. Diphthongs.
FIGURE. POWER.
Ai i in light
An ow in now
01 oi in oil.
2. These vowels and diphthongs are to be considered as
always short. The same sounds long are represented by a
duplication of the character; and in order to make the
number of written characters as few as possible, this dupli-
cation is indicated by a small stroke over the letter, as ngape,
" 1,” in which the “a” is to be pronounced long as in “ father”;
without this mark the“ a” would be short as in “ man.” When
two consonants come together the syllable is made long, but
the vowel remains short, as “atte,” in which, though both
vowels are short, the first syllable is long and the second
short. Thus the quantity of every syllable being distinctly
shown, the pronunciation is fixed and certain. When two
different vowels concur they coalesce and form a diphthong,
if their nature permits, or unless separated by the mark of
diaeresis ( ” ).
CHAPTER 11.
OF SUBSTANTIVES AND THEIR CASES, AND OF
PREPOSITIONS.
3. Substantives have three numbers, singular, dual, and
plural; but there is no difference of form on account of
gender.
a. The singular for the most part ends in “e” or “i.”
Some few words terminate with a consonant.
h. The dual is formed by adding the termination “ engk”
10


and rejecting the terminating vowel* of the singular, as
“mune,” lip, “ mune-ngk,”f the two lips.
c. The plural is formed by adding “ar” and rejecting the
terminating vowel, as “ bami,” girl, “ bam-ar,” girls.
4. The relations expressed by the Latin and Greek cases
are in this language expressed by particles added to the
root in the following manner :
5. The genitive case is expressed by the following par-
ticles :
SINGULAR.
-aide Korn-aide yarnde> The spear of the man, or,
man’s spear y the man’s spear.
DUAL,
-engg-al Korn-engg-alyarnd-engk7 The two men’s
man two of spear two y spears.
PLURAL.
-an Korn-an mam-ar) r r , mn „, a
f* / i\ p i Ahe men s risii.
men of (several) nsh y
G. The dative case is formed by —
S. D. P.
-ungai -ungenggul -ungar
-angk
-aide -engg-al -an
Ngate pemp- ani wark-ungai7 I will give to the
by me (a) giving shall be woman to y woman.
Ngate-...m-..angk ramm ir 7r u u
by me you to (a) telling has been y ave 0 ou
-ungai and angk. though synonymous, cannot, however, be
used for each other, -angk is always used with the pronouns,
and -ungai with other words, -angk is used with the fol-
lowing words, which have the force of both substantive and
pronoun: nafigaiye, my father; nangaiy-in-angk, to my
father ; naiyowe, your father ; naiy-in-angk, to your father;
yikko-walle, his father; yikko-wan-angk, to his father;
nainkowe, my mother; naink-in-angk, to my mother;
* When a word ending with either of the vowels “e” or “i” takes an
affiix beginning with a vowel, one of the vowels, generally the first, is fre-
quently, but not always, thrown out, as, “ korne/’ man ; “korn-engk”
(and not “ korne-engk”), two men ; “ korn-ar” (and not “ korne-ar”),
men (three or more) ; but when the affix begins with a consonant, the ter-
minating vowel is retained, as “pooke,” (a) well; “ pooke-nende,*’ from
(the) well.
f This mark (-) shows the parts of which compound words are com-
posed, as “korn-alde,” of the man, compounded of korne, man, and
-aide, of; “yaral-ind-an-angk,” composed of yaral, when, inde, by
thee, an, mo, angk, to. It is also used to show that a letter has been
omitted by contraction, as “ korn-ald-” abbreviation of “ korn-alde,” of
(a) man.
11


ninkowe, thy mother; ninkin-angk, to your mother;
narko-walle, his mother; narko-wan-angk, to his mother ;
gelanowe, my brother; gelanowan-angk, to my brother;
gelauwe, thy brother; gelan-angk, to thy brother; gelau-
walle, his brother; gelauwan-angk, to his brother;
maranowe, my sister; muranowan-angk, to my sister;
marauwe, thy sister; maran-angk, to thy sister ; marau-
walle, his sister; marauwan-angk, to his sister. These
words being rather irregular in their formation, will be
given, together with some others, in a table further on.
7. The accusative—
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
-engg-un* -ar
Ngate nakk ir ngfim-angg-erengg-un porl-engg-un

Porn-...ur-itye wlwir-il > Ua a cj-
dying was he disease lO 0 lsease -
10. The prepositions out of (e, ex), from, on account of
(ob), are expressed by the following particles :
-nende -nenggulund nande
-anyir
Warrauw- an-angk nguk- poke-nende
(a) fetching (be there) me to water well from
Fetch me some water from the well.
* The “k” in -eng and -angk always becomes “ g” before another affix
beginning with a vowel.
t “ “ g,” and “b” become “ t,” “ k,” and “p” before an affix
commencing with a vowel, as, yarnde, spear; yarnt-il, by (a) spear ;
raande, house; raant-angk, in (the) house; turabe, raw; tump-ar
maatn-ar, raw fish.

Blukk-un-itye ngum-anyir 7tt • r • j r
r -j • if & J . rb He is airaidoi you.
atraid is he you on account 013 J
-anyir appears to be used only with pronouns and pro-
nominal substantives.
11. The prepositions “out,” “of,” and “from” are also
expressed by the following compound particles, in which the
-an- is probably a contraction of -angk, in the sense of “ in”
or “ at.”
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
-an-mant -an-nenggulund -an-nande
Yarnd-inde ? 3 Whence do you I Mant-an-mant. From the

&?£rT ,ae wark -""f ai t Go thou to the woman,
going (be) thou woman to >
ungai and -angk may not be used one for the other, but
no rule can at present be given for their correct application,
except that -ungai must never be used with pronouns, which
are formed with -angk in the singular, dual, and plural.
13. The same preposition “ to,” in connexion with the
proper names of places, is expressed by -an, -aid, -ar, singular,
engg-al, dual.
Polt-au, to Poltong. Ram-au, to Ramong. Ngartt-au,
to Ngartong.
Kot-ald, to Kotungald. Mutabarri-ar, to Mutabarringar.
Witt-engg-al, to Wittingenggul.
These words, Poltong, Kotungald, Wittingenggul, signify
at the place which they designate. What one would suppose
from analogy to be the simple nominatives appear not to be
used. These, together with the names of several other
places, will be given, with their inflexions, at a future page.
* Words ending with “ u” or “ o” require a “ \v” to be added before
an affix beginning with a vowel.

39. There are, in addition to the primitive substantives,
such as korne, a man ; porle, a child; nangge, the sun, &c.,
others derived either from other substantives, or from the
roots of verbs, or formed by the combination of an adjective
and substantive. Of those derived from other substantives
there is, as far as at present known, but one class, for by the
addition of the particle inyeri, signifying belonging or apper-
taining to, or that which appertains to the root, as,
-war is used only in the sense of on, upon
18


From Kurle, head ; Kurlifiyeri, what belongs to the head;
a hat or cap.
“ Ram-ong, name of a place, Ram-inyeri, native or
inhabitant of Ram-ong.
“ Kurre,leg; Kurr-inyer-engk (dual), pair of trowsers.
Substantives from the roots of verbs are formed by the
following :
-urmi, signifying thing or instrument.
-amalde, expressing the person or agent of the action de-
noted by the verb, as,
From Tant-in, sleeping or to sleep; Tant-urmi, sleeping
thing, a bed.
From Kalt-in, cutting ; Kalt urmi \ spade
cutting
" Pett-in, stealing; Pett-amalde, a thief.
“ Pull-un, bathing; Pull-amalde, a person who bathes,
a bather.
-amalde is also added to substantives as well as to the roots
of verbs, as.
From Mame, fish, is formed Mam-amalde, a fisherman.
“ Nurrari, kangaroo; Nurrar-amalde, one who catches
kangaroos.
The following are examples of words compounded of an
adjective and a substantive: —
Yande-orn-, old man, from yande, old, and -orn-, abbre-
viation of korne, man.
Yande-nnin-, old woman; from yande, andmTrnine, woman.
To words of this class the particles of the table § 38 are
affixed in the following manner; —
JNaQ-wurle plongge ? Yant-ald-orn-
who se charming instrument? old of man
Whose charming instrument is this ? The old man’s.
Yant-.. (§ fb note) engk-* -r , ,
, “ J J ° . r I rvo old men.
old they two menj
Yand*ar-orn> ou men
old men )
Such words as kuii-ifiyeri, kallt-urmi, pett-amalde, take
the affix at the end, as, kurl-iayer-ald kandari, band of a hat,
or hat-band.
* These, it will bo observed, are exceptions to the rules 7 and 9,
notes. The natives appear, upon many occasions, to confound the letters
“k”aud“g,” “ d” and " t,” “ p” and “ b,” or to use an inteimediate
sound.

CHAPTER 111.
OF ADJECTIVES. OF THE DEGREES OF COMPARISON. OF
NUMBERS.
40. Adjectives receive the same particles as the substan-
tives to which they belong- Example :
Tarnalo pemp-ani brap-ungar porl-ungar
no more (a) giving shall be bad to child-ren to
I will no more give to the naughty children.
These particles are, however, frequently omitted in one of
the words, but more commonly in the substantive than the
adjective, as,
Nau-wurl-ar maiyingg-ar ?■) m , , , ?
who....se they clothe s?> vvllose are ttiese Lotties .
Nankur-ungenggul porl-7 They are for the two good
good two for children.
41. Besides such as may be considered primitive adjec-
tives, there are others formed—
a. From substantives, by the affixes,
-watyeri, signifying full Of, abounding in.
-itye, without, deprived of.
Examples :
Moke, hole; Moko-watyer-ar* nger-ar ) Nets lull of holes,
hole full of they net...s y torn, broken.
Muwe, sleep; Muw-itye (§ 3, b. note) porl-') A sleepless
sleep-less child,) child.
b. From the roots of verbs, by the affix,
-auwuri, denoting habit or custom of doing the action, or
possession of the quality signified by the root, as,
Blukk-un, being afraid, Blukk-awur- engk korn-engk
for possessing they two man they two
Two cowardly men.
c. From the names of places, by the affix inyeri, as (§ 39),

42. The relations of equality, superiority, and inferiority,
commonly called the degrees of comparison, are expressed as
follows:
a. 1. The comparative of equality.
Krauwe hittyekatye manek ell-in-itye hittyenekatye
great this equal being is it this
This is as great as that.
a. 2. The comparative superiority by the particle -ru, as,
Su ye g g r r eT’ tt tye ™s * *-•
The other particles (§ ) are inserted between -ru and the
root, as,
Hiy-engg grauw-engk, efigk, grauw-engk-ra
these two great they two they two great they two more
These two are greater than those two.
The ‘ f k” of Hiyengk and engk is changed into “g” for
the sake of the sound, on account of the succeeding words
commencing with a “g.”
a. 3. The comparative of inferiority.
Tarnau grauwe manek ell-...in-...itye hittyenekatye
not great equal being is it this
This is not so great as that.
h. The superlative degree can only be expressed either by
a repetition of the word, or by prefixing the adverb peke, very,
as,
Kin-auwe yarnde yullba-ity-*yulb- (§3 b. notef)! His spear is
him of spear long it long /the longest.
Peka-tye ( b. note)* grauwe ngan-auwe knake
very it great me of knake
My fighting-stick is the greatest.
43. The particle -ol is used both with adjectives and sub-
stantives to form diminutives, as,
Porl-..ar-ol 7 Little Ngarake-017 Little duck, or
child-ren little.) children duck....ling duckling.
Sort "little} Very short ’ 0r ' the short one ’^
* When an affix begins with ‘'i,” instead of following the rule (J 3. b,
note*), the final vowel changes to “a,” and the two coalesce to form
the diphthong “ai,’’and in some cases the “i" is rejected, leavingonly
the “a."

CHAPTER IV.
OF PRONOUNS.
I. Of the Personal Pronouns.
40. These may be conveniently divided into separable and
inseparable. Ihe separable pronouns are like the pronouns in
wlfiol IS \ ? ngUagG l W ° rds re P resentin g the persons to
which they belong ,• the inseparable are fragments of the
separable pronouns, attached as affixes to other words.
46, The separable pronouns are as follows :
1. Pronoun of the first person, “ I.”
SINGULAR. DUAL
Nom. Ngape, I No-sle we two v PLIIRAI "
Acc. NU me
Abl. IN gate, by me Ngele, by us two Ngftne, by us.

2. Pronoun of the second person, “ Thou.”
Nom. Nginte thou Ngurle, you two Ngune, you
Acc. Ngum,_thee Lorn, you two Nom, you
Voc. Ngmt-a, O thou! Ngurl-a, you two! Ngrma, you!
Abl. Nginte, by thee Ngurle, by you two Ngune, by you
3. Pronoun of the third person, ‘‘He,” “ she ” “it ”
Nom. Kitye, he, she, it Kengk, they two Kar, they
Acc. Kinhim &c Kengg-un, them two Kan, them
A bl. Kile, by him, &c. Kefigg-ufby them two Kar, by them
47. The inseparable pronouns are
I. First person.

Nom. -ap -app, -appe, I angall, we two -angaft! we
Acc. -an,* -ah, me -alamm, us two -anamm, us
Abl. -at, -att, atte, by me -angall, by us two -angafi, by us

Engk and ityan sometimes occur as separable pronous as

(a) uiymg (there) is it (a) burningj some burned (corpses)
48. Ihe other relations or cases are expressed by the fol
lowing particles added to the accusatives of all three numbers
and persons : mmuers

T he others are formed after the same model.
2. Fossessive or Adjective Pronouns.
49. These are formed by adding to the accusatives of the
personal pronouns,
-auwe of,
-auwurle >■ belonging, or
-afiyeri J appertaining to.
These pronouns (or rather adjectives) take the same par-
tides (§ 39) as the substantives to which they refer; only it
must be observed that the form ngafi-anyeri must never be
used in the nominative and accusative, or with the particle
-ambe, foi which the forms nganauwe, nganauwurle, are
proper; and that these latter can never be used with any of
24


the other particles. (The particle -ald-amb-, compounded nf
-aide and -ambe, follows the same rule as -aide, and requires
-anyen.) I hus one must say— Nganauwe porle nnf

Ihe other cases are to be formed by inserting the proper
particles (§ 38) between the root and the pronoun in the same
way as the above.
7. an-, my; m-, thy ; n-, his, her, its, prefixed.
Yang- an-...ai mulde ?> 0
where my ,? pipe? j Where .s my pipe ?
Yare m-.,.a-..tye mitye ?7 ~r , , . ,
what your ? it name ? i What ,s * our name ?
Yange n-...ai yarnde ?7 ™r. . 9
where his ? spear ? S Where 18 hls Bpear ?
Reflective and Reciprocal Pronouns.
54. There are two forms of reflective and reciprocal pro-
nouns, the first having both a reflective and reciprocal, and
the second only a reciprocal signification.
55. Those of the first form are both separable and in-
separable. The separable are,
1. Of the First Person.
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
Ngap-an-angk Ngele-nangk Ngane-nangk.
2. Of the Second Person.
Nginte-m-angk Ngfirle-nangk Ngune-nangk.
3. Of the Third Person.
Kity-en-angk Kengg-enangk Kar-enangk.
56. The corresponding inseparable pronouns are,
1. Of the First Person.
-ap-an-angk -angall-enangk -angafi-enangk.
2. Of the Second Person.
-inde-m-angk -ungull-enangk -ungun-enangk.
3. Of the Third Person.
-ity-en-angk -engg-enangk -ar-enangk.
57. The formation of these may be traced in the singular,
though it is not so evident in the dual and plural ; thus,
Ngap-an-angk, is “I me to,” Nginte-m-angk, “thou thee
to,” kity-en-angk, “he him to.” They have either a re-
flective or a reciprocal signification, as the case may require.
Examples :
Ng&p-an-angk dretul- ur 7 T u .
I me to cutting have been) 1 have cut m y selt -
28


iSgele-nangk laggel- ambe -v
we two us to spearing may be /Let us two spear each
or \ other, or throw spears at
Laggel- amb-...angall-enangk L each other.
spearing may be we two us to 3
58. The other form, having only a reciprocal signification,
and consequently used only in the dual and plural, appears to
be formed byinserting the inseparable personal pronouns (§ 47)
between the two syllables of the adjective or adverb kingung,
separate or separately, thus : king ung, the pronoun stand-
ing in the place of the line, as, king-angall-ung, we two each
other or we two separately, and in opposition to each
other, (do, &c.).
1. Of the First Person.
DUAL.
King-angall-ung, we two each
other
PLURAL.
King-angan-ung, we each
other.
2. Of the Second Person.
Kifig-ungull-ung, you two each
other
King-ungun-ung, you each
other.
3. Third Person.
Kingengg-ung, they two each
other
King-ar-ung, they each
other.*
The etymology we have given would lead to the conclusion
that the reciprocal signification of these words is merely
conventional, and not expressed by the words themselves,
and in fact we find that they have not always the reciprocal
meaning ; thus, they say,
King-angall-ung tant- ambe > Let us two sleep se-
separately we two sleeping may bey parately.
Kingangallung ngopp- Let us two walk se-
separately we two walking may be S parately.
As well as,
i i } They are plucking
King-ar-ung trmdel- .in menak-ar (. ou { eac f, othe / 3
they each other plucking out are beard..,s t beards
King-angan-ung mend ambe ") Let us strike each other,
we each other striking may bej or fight (with sticks).
* The reflective and reciprocal pronouns are known only in the
nominative case. Whether the other cases are in use is not yet known.
29


4. Demonstrative Pronouns.
59. Theie are two demonstrative pronouns, hiye, this, and
nSJye, that: and also two derivatives from hiye.
1. Hiye,* This.”
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
Nom. Hiye Hengg-engk Har-ar
Acc. Hin Hengg-un Haran
Abl. Hile Hengg-ul Har-ar.
The other cases are formed in the same manner as those
of the personal pronouns (§ 48).
2. Naiye, That.”
Nom, Naiye Nak-ak Narar
Acc. Orne Unek-ak
Abl. Orle Urle-ak Narar
Gen. Orn-auwe 7 n. i
Orn-auwurle 1 Un-auweak
Dat. Orn-angk Un-angg-ak
From Orn-anyr
For Orn-ambe
The cases left blank in the dual and plural, if in use, are
not known.
GO. The forms derived from hiye are hiyekai, this, which
is known only in the nominative case singular, and hittye-
nekatye, known only in the nominative case, but in the
singular, dual, and plural.
Hittyenekatye, “ This” (emphatic).
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
Nom. Hittyene-katye Henggefie-kengk Harafie-kar.
61. From hiye is formed an adjective or possessive pro-
noun, hih-auwe or hin-auwurle, of or belonging to that. It
follows the same rules as the other adjectives derived from
pronouns (§§ 48, 49).
5. Interrogative Pronouns.
62. There are two interrogative pronouns, ngangge, who,
and mifiye, what.
1. Nangge ? “Who?”
SINGULAR, DUAL, AND PLURAL.
Nom. Nafige, who Gen. N-auwurle, whose
Acc. Nauwe, whom Dat, Nake, to whom
Abl. Ngande, by whom From N-anyir, from whom
Gen. N-auwe, whose For N-ambe,for whom
30


2. Minye ? “ What ?”
SINGULAR, DUAL, AND PLURAL.
Nom. Minye, what
Acc. Minye, what
Abl. Mure, by what or from what, as a cause
p, t j Meke -j
EN ’lMgk-urle, sometimes, mek-auwiirle |°* w “ at
Dat. Meke, to what
With Mengge, with what (instrument or material)
From Minde, from what
For Mek-imbe, for what
The above forms seem to imply ignorance of the number,
whether singular, dual, or plural, concerning whom or which
the question is asked, as in the following examples :
N-auwurle ngere ? Ngan-auwe. Lam-auwe. Nara-au we
whose net ? mine. us two of. us of.
Kan-auwe.
them of,
i.e. Whose net is this ? The answer may be either Mine,
or It belongs to us two, or Ours, or Theirs.
Ngand-an petting?
by whom them (a) stealing has been ?
Porl-...i1. Pori- eng- ul. Pori- ar.
child by. child...ren two by. child...ren by.
i.e. Who has stolen them ? The child, or The two children,
or The children.
But where the number, whether singular, dual, or plural,
is known, the inseparable personal pronouns are added in the*
following manner (§ 47) :
Nauw-e inde-...yan nakk ir ?") What person did you
whom by the him (a ) seeing was ?_> see ?
Nauw-...ind- efiggun nakk-ir ? > What two persons
whom by thee them two (a) seeing was did you see ?
Nauw-...ind- an nakk-....ir What persons did you
whom by thee them (a) seeing was ?_> see ?
Nak- ind- enggun-...angk pemp-? 1 two P er
to whom by thee them two to (a) giving ? °u give.
Ngang-inde ?) Who are I Ngang-ungulle ?*■) Who are you
who thou ? 3 you ? | who you two ? 3 two ?
who gg ’ U yfuf ? } Who •» y°“ ? (See § 47. 2.)
The final “ e,” as in many other cases, is here merely euphonic.
31


03. The possessive or adjective pronoun n-auwe, or
n-aQwurle, appears to be formed in the same manner, and to
follow the same rules as the other adjective pronouns (§§ 48,
49), but as it is always used in a contracted form, we give it
below with all its variations.
N-auwe ?or M-aQwurle ? “ Whose ?”
SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
rN-auwe N-aQwengk N-aawar
‘ (.N-aQwui-le N-auwurl-engk N-auwurl-ar
N-auw-enggun N-auw-ar
■'-N-auwurle N-auwurl-engg-un N-auwurl-ar
G. N-anyer-ald N-anyer-engg-al N anyer-an
D. N-anyer-ungaiN-anyer-ungenggul N-anyerung-ar
Ab. N-anyer-il N-anyer-efiggul N-anyer-ar

1 IN-auwurlambe Nauwurl-engg-un-ambe N-auwurl-ar-ambe
Whose? (one) - Whose ? (two) Whose? (many)
6. Relative Pronouns.
64. The demonstrative pronoun narye, that, appears to be
sometimes used as a relative, as in the following examples :
Ngahde-m...angk waiy inpote?|Who is leading the
by whom you to (a) leading is horse ?/ horse to you ?
Chari-....il , I Nand- il ?),
Charley by/ a \by whom by him ? 1 Charley .
Nalye lew-...in maiit-..(§ 9, note)...angg-..(§ 7, note) an (§ 51,1)
That living is house at my
He who lives at my house (my servant).
Ngande-....m-..angg-..(§ 7, note)..engg-ul ramming ?
by whom you to them two by (a) speaking was ?
Who are the two who told you ?
Henggullekengk, nak-ak wald-...ak lew in ak
by those two those two there they two sitting are they two.
Those two who are sitting there.
Note. Hengullekengk is the ablative dual of hittyekatye,
which was omitted being noticed in § 60 through mistake.
The meaning is the same as that of hitlyenekatye. Harekar,
in the following example, is the ablative plural. Nak-ak and
nar-ar are the dual and plural of nalye (§ 59, 2). The affix
-ak has the same meaning as engk (see table of particles,
§ 38), and in sentences in which nakak occurs, the following
verbs take the termination -ak in preference to -engk, as in
the above examples:
32


Ngand-....im memp- ing? >By whom have you
by whom you (a) striking has been ?3 been beaten ?
Harek-ar, nar-ar wald-...ar lew in \By those who are
by them those there they sitting arej sitting there.
6.5. The personal pronoun kitye, he, seems also sometimes
to perform the office of a relative, as,
Ngate nakk- ir korne, yarn-. ir an-ang-itye
by me (a) seeing has been man, speaking was me to he
watangrau.
yesterday.
i.e. I have seen the man who spoke to me yesterday.
7. Indefinite Pronouns.
(5Q SINGULAR. DUAL. PLURAL.
Yam, another Yamm-engk, two others Yamm-ar, others
Kittyur, another
Kangul, kangulun, another
Ngrunt-ar, all
Yam seems to include the idea of kind or species, as,
Hiye-kai ngaitye em ? Hng hng,* yam korn
this ? countryman your? no other (tribe) man
Is this your countryman? No, a man of another tribe.
while kangul or kangulun merely expresses another, as,
Kaikunda (§l6, note) yan kangulun korn-
(a) calling (be there by thee) him another man
Call another man (either your countryman or any one else).
Tyile-kai? Hng hng, yam mitye, barley
rice ? no, other name, barley
Is this rice? No, another kind of grain, barley.
Note. These words are at present known only in the no-
minative and accusative cases.
8. Emphatic Pronouns.
67. Emphatic pronouns corresponding to the English
forms “ I myself, thou thyself,” &c., are formed by adding
* This and its correspondent yes (hng) represent sounds something
like the grunting of a pig, and having some affinity to the English inter-
jection “hem !” or “ahem!” which would be more correctly written “hm!”
33


the particle -on to the personal pronouns, either immediately,
or after an affixed pronoun in the accusative case, when such
occurs in the phrase, as,
Ngate-on merupp- ani yap-ar> I myself will cut
by me myself (a) cutting shall be wood S the wood.
Ngate-yan-..0n en- ani > T , .
by me it myself (a) doing shall be ) 1 m y se,f wlll do “•
This particle is used in the singular, dual, and plural, but,
as far as hitherto known, only in the nominative and ablative
cases. The particle -ai (alone, only) has sometimes the
same force as -on, but cannot be separated by any inter-
vening word from the pronoun to which it belongs. Example :
Mgel ai-...yan waiy- ir pote
by us two alone it (a) leading has been horse
We two ourselves have brought the horse.
CHAPTER V.
OF THE PRONOMINAL SUBSTANTIVES.
68. There is a class of words which have the force both
of a substantive and an adjective pronoun in connexion
therewith, which we shall distinguish by the name of pro-
nominal substantives. They are probably contracted forms
of compound words, formed by joining together a substan-
tive and pronoun, but of which the etymology cannot, for the
most part, be at present traced. They are all, as far as
hitherto known, words expressing relationship of consan-
guinity, They differ from other substantives in the forma-
tian of the cases. The accusative differs from the nomina-
tive, and is formed from it according to its termination by
changing
NOM. ACC.
-ye into -yin
-owe “ -in
-auwe “ -an
-anowe “ -anowan
-owalle “ -owan
-auwalle “ -auwan.
The genitive is the same as the accusative. The other
34


cases are formed by adding the following particles to the
accusative:
-de ablative case, by
-angk dative case, to, with (in company)
-anyir from, on account of
-ambe for.
Examples:
1. Nangai-ye, my father, and Naink-owe, my mother.
Nom. Nangai-ye, my father Naink-owe, my mother
Acc. Nangai-yin, my father Naink-in, my mother
Gen. Nangai-yin, of my Naink-in, my mother’s
Dat. Nangai-yin-angk, to my Naink-in angk, to my m.
Abl. Nangai-yin-de, by my Naink-in-de, by my mother
From Nafigai-yin-anyir, from Naink-in-anyir, from my m.
For Nangai-yin-ambe, for Naink-in-ambe, for my ra.
Words of this class are used only in the singular. The
dual and plural must be formed by affixing the inseparable
pronouns (§ 47) to the dual and plural of ngaiyeri, father, and
ninkeri, mother, as naiyer-efigg-an, my two fathers; ninker-
ehgg-an, my two mothers; ngaiyer-ar-an, my fathers;
ninker-ar-an, my mothers. These latter forms are to be
declined in the same manner as tart-engg-an and tarrt-ar-an
(see § 52, 2). The dual and plural of the pronoun is to be
expressed by the inseparable dual and plural pronouns,
affixed to ngaiyeri, as ngaiyeri-alamm, father of us two;
ngaiyer-engg-alamra, two fathers of us two ; ngaiyer-ar-alamm,
fathers of us two, &c., similar to tarte-alamm, tart-engg-
alamm, tart-ar-alamm (§ 53, 6).
2. Nink-owe, thy mother, and Nark-owalle.
Nom. Nink-owe, thy mother
Acc. Nink-an, thy mother
Gen. Nink-in, thy mother’s
Dat. Nink-in-angk, to thy m.

35


Note. Yin and yin-de, lan and lan-de, are frequently
used for ngaryin, ngaiyifide, gelan, gel-an-de.
The other words of this kind which have been observed
are, yik-owalle, his or her father; gel-anowe, my brother;
gel-auwalle, his or her brother; mar-anowe, my sister;
mar-auwe, thy sister; mar-auwalle, his or her sister. These
may easily be declined by attending to the rules in the former
part of this section.
CHAPTER YI.
OF VERBS.
Of the Verb “ To be”
69. Whether this language has any word or particle which
can stand for the abstract verb or logical copula “is,” seems
uncertain; at all events, if such word or particle should
exist, it is for the most part omitted, though sometimes ap-
parently supplied by ell-in, or the particle el, probably a
contraction of ell-in, a word whose radical meaning is
doubtful, but which appears to be used in the various senses
of existing, continuing, desiring, acting, doing, moving, going,
coming. It cannot, however, be generally used in place of
the English verb “to be,” without modifying or altering the
sense of the proposition, as will be seen from the following
examples.
Ka- mma-itye porl ? Hng, ngan-awe porl?^ S child
whether your it child? Yes, me of child C Yes it is
Hiye-kai meralde yape. Hiyekai yape, merald-itye

This is dry wood. This wood is dry.

Ngate pant- ir porle, balb-..emb-itye

I brought forth a child and it was white; or, My child
was white when it was born.
The final “ e” is here merely euphonic.
36


Note, -ir and -etnb are merely particles of time, and not
tenses of the verb “ To be.”

2. Of Attributive Verbs.
70, All verbs in this language are expressed by words
terminating in -in, -un, or -en, in the present tense, as,
Ngape yay-in, I eat
Ngate takk-in, I eat
NgMe} mutt - an ’ J drink -
Ngate kangg-en, I laugh at.
As in other languages, some of these words must neces-
sarily, from the nature of the action or state which they
signify, be verbs active or transitive, as ngate memmp-in, I
* -embe and -in, panicles denoting respectively past and present time,
(see \ ).
37


strike; ngape mend-in, I strike; and others neuter or in-
transitive, as ngape lew-in, I sit; ngate tant-in, I sleep.
It must here be observed that some of these words, as
y ay-in, require the pronoun to be ngape ; others, as takk-in
and kangg-en, require ngate; while some, as mutt-un, may
take either ngape or ngate —why, we shall endeavour to show
presently.
Duplex Form of the Verb
71. Many of these words admit of a change of form, so that
the same idea may be expressed in two different manners, as,
Ngate-yan lakk-in, I spear him
Ngap-il laggl-in, I spear him.
1. Korn-il lakk-in mam-, The man spears the fish
2. Korne laggel-in mam-il, The man spears the fish.
a. Now, in considering these forms, the question arises—
How are these phrases to be analysed ? What is the literal
meaning of the words and particles which compose them ?
Let us in the first place suppose ngate and korn-ii to be the
agent nominative or active cases of ngape and korne, and see
how this hypothesis will assist us in the analysis. By an
active case we must understand a peculiar form of any word,
showing it to be the agent and not the object of an action
signified by some other word expressed or understood. Upon
this supposition, then, we should imagine korn-il lakkin
mame, to signify either The man spears the fish, or The fish
is speared by the man ; but how are we to explain the second
phrase—Korne laggel-in mam-il ? Here we have korne
without the sign of the active case, and therefore, according
to our hypothesis, it cannot be regarded as the agent in the
action expressed lay laggel-in, which word, from its difference
of form, must be taken to mean something different from
lakk -in. If w r e regard lakk-in, in the first sentence (I) as
active, laggel-in will probably be the passive, and conversely.
The next word, mam-il, we find with the sign of the active
case, from which we conclude it to be the agent in the action
of spearing. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the whole
sentence (2) signifies either, The man is speared by the fish,
or, The fish spears the man —the exact reverse of what we
already know to be the true meaning. We must therefore
seek some other explanation. Suppose ngate and kornil to
have the force of Latin ablatives, or of English words pre-
ceded by the preposition “ by” or “ with”—then, instead of
38


being used generally as agents, they will be employed only
when the sense of other words, with which they may be in
connexion, renders their employment necessary. Next, let
us take lakk-in not to mean either “ spears” (transfigit) or,
“is speared” (transfigitur), but simply the name of the
action, the gerund, or verbal substantive spearing (in English
often confounded with the participle, from having the same
form), such as is the word preaching, in the sentence —“ He
was sent to prepare the way by preaching repentance.” The
third word, mame, will now be the accusative case, governed
by lakk-in, and we shall have the phrase No. 1, analysed as
follows: •
Korn-il lakk-in mame.
man by spearing fish.
The English idiom requires the copula “is” or “there is”
to be introduced, but as this is generally not expressed by
the natives (§ 69) even where it is absolutely necessary in
the dialects of Europe, this will be no serious objection to
the view we have taken. The phrase will thus be equivalent
to “ By the man is spearing the fish,” or, “ There is a spear-
ing the fish by the man,” or “ The action of spearing the fish
is with the man,” i.e. “ The man spears the fish.”
b. In the second form,
Korne laggel-in mam-il,
we have the word korne without any particle, which we may
suppose to be in the nominative case. Then laggel-in
which; from its difference of form, we must suppose to have
a different meaning from lakk-in. Suppose it the participle
“spearing.” We now have f< man spearing- “ man”
in the nominative case, and the participle agreeing with it
To complete the sense we require an object, which we should
expect to find in the accusative case. We have however
the word mam-il, in the ablative. This, we think, may be
explained by regarding the particle -il as pointing out the
object with which the man, to whom the action of spearing
has been attributed by the word laggel-in, is engaged. We
shall thus have
Korne laggel-in mam-,.il
man spearing fish with,
or, “ The man spearing is with or at the fish,” which makes
a good sense although not quite according to the English
idiom. In the first sentence, korn-il lakk-in mame, the
particle -il will indicate that the action is with (apud), and
m the second, korne laggel-in mam-il, that the man and
39


action considered together, or the man acting, is with (apud)
the fish. In some instances the dative is used, as,
Nsap-an-angk dretul-un> T ...
® r P M am cutting myselt.
I me to cutting y ° J
The two first phrases are to be explained in the same
manner.
Ngate-..yan lakkin \By or with me spearing him (there is),
by me him spearing.) or, I spear him.
Ngap il laggel-in> I spearing (am) with him, or,
I with him spearingj lam spearing him.
the -il, in ngap-il, being the ablative of the inseparable pro-
noun -itye, he.
c. Taking this view of the subject, all those words which
require ngape (§ 71 ) are to be regarded as participles or
adjectives; and those which require ngate, as verbal sub-
stantives, or gerunds, or the mere names of the actions,
without reference to anything else, like the Greek infinitive
with the article, as, to typtein, the act of striking;
while those which take both ngape and ngate must be re-
garded, like English words with the affix -ing, as sometimes
participles and sometimes gerunds; and they have accord-
ingly been so designated in the Vocabulary, Whether our
explanation be, or be not, regarded as theoretically correct,
these distinctions will at least serve the useful purpose of
showing when it is proper to use the forms ngape and korue,
and when ngate and korn-il.
d. As far as the derived forms, laggel-in, from lakk-in;
dretul-un, from drck-in, &c., are concerned, our view of the
case is supported by the analogy of the New South Wales
dialect, and the opinion of Mr Threlkeld, who gives the form
“ wiyellin” as the participle corresponding to “ wiyan,” (he)
speaks (See Threlkeld’s Grammar, page 68, Conjugation
Communicative). Here also the same difference as respects
the agent is observable in the two parallel forms of expression.
'■ who"* 0 speaks (Threlkeld’s Grammar, page 127.)
" by*whom (Encounter Bay dialect.)
2. Ng4n unnung wiyellin ydng ? 7 (N. S. Wales dialect,
who there talking out there ?J T.’s Grammar, p. 127)
2. Ngangge rammel-in lalde? > /I 7 , D
who talking out there?) (Enccvmter Bay diaiect).
40


Though the fact is not noticed by Mr Threlkeld, who con-
siders nganto as the agent nominative or active case of
ngan; but, with this theory, the omission of the particle -to
in the second of the above sentences appears to us inexpli-
cable, as ngan must be equally the agent in the action of
speaking in both. There is, however, this difference be-
tween the Encounter Bay and New South Wales dialects,
that in the latter the participle, as well as the word from
which it derives, governs the accusative, while in the former,
as before stated, the participle always governs either the
ablative or dative. Examples :
Wiyellin bon bang|(New South Wales. Threlkeld,
telling him I 1 page 68.)
N f P ‘hT m “fTeSnr} (“er Bay.)
72. The verbal substantive and participle serve to express
the active, the passive, the reflective, and the reciprocal mo-
difications of the verb.
a. The active is expressed either by the verbal substan-
tive or participle, as examples already given show.
b. The passive is expressed by the verbal substantive, as,
Lakk-in-ityan") A spearing him there is; or. There is a spear-
spearing him 3 ing °f him ; or. He is speared.
. A spearing me has been; or. There
Lakk-i-...ir.. (s 74)..anr has been a spearing of me; i.e., I
spearing has been have been speared.
Note. Observe that it is only custom fUsus, quern penes
est jus et norma loquendi) which requires in the English
language that the word governed by the gerund should be in
the genitive case whenever the article is used; the sense is
better with the accusative, as the genitive merely indicates
a relation between the action and person, or shows that they
are in some way connected, but leaves it uncertain whether
the relation be that of agent or patient.
c. The reflective modification is generally expressed by the
participle with the reflective pronoun (§ 57), but sometimes
also by the verbal substantive with the simple pronoun :
N fT a tf “gl l -cutting myself.
Ngat-..an drCk-in7 T
by me me (a) cutting! cu m^ s

d. The reciprocal sense is expressed by the participle only,
with the reciprocal pronouns (§§ 57, 58), as,

we each other striking (are)) We str,ke each other -
King-ar-ung laggel-in korn-ar7 The men are spearing

Tenses and Moods.
73. The terminations -in, -un, -en (§ 74) appear to he
particles indicating present time added to the root, which
without this addition appears to he a word of the same form
as nouns with e final, as, yaye, eating ; prelde, driving away.
These roots are used as the Infinitive and Imperative moods
in the English. Examples :
Giy-in-angan wergittul-') Let us go fishing, or,
(let there be) going by us fishing £ to fish.
Giyin...angan prelde, or, preldul-
(there is a) going by us driving (gerund) driving (participle)
We are going to drive away (our enemies).
Takke, or, takk> N
(be there) eating j Eat (imperative).
74. The following particles substituted for -in, -un, -en,
serve to express differences of meaning corresponding to the
tenses and moods of other languages :
TABLE OP PARTICLES USED IN THE CONJUGATION OP THE VERB.
* The root is supposed to be situated in the place of the blank line.
42


These particles are applied both to the verbal substantive
and to the participle. The examples which follow will
illustrate their application.
75. The participles appear to represent an action as pro-
gressing, and consequently unfinished at the time spoken of,
in which respect they are similar to the English participles.
Thus, pettel-itye* signifies. He is now in the act of stealing,
corresponding to the English form. He is stealing, while
kile pett-in answers to He steals.
The present tense, as in English, is frequently indefinite
as to time. Examples :
Brup-ar korn-ar pett-in ) D , , ,
r u j j. i • /.i •x c Bad men steak
by bad men stealing (there is) j
Y»n-ap ngopp-un7 T . T u
soon I going S 1 Soon gomg ’ meanm o> 1 Wlll soon S°-
The preterite seems merely to indicate remote time.
The perfect seems to answer more to the Latin than to
the English perfect. It serves for both the English perfect
and imperfect.
The future merely indicates any future time.
76. The verb undergoes no change on account of number
and person, which are expressed by the subject of the pro-
position. The pronouns separable and inseparable stand
before or are affixed to the verb or some other word in the
sentence, as the following examples will show :

Note. As far as we have been able to discover, no par-

this or any of the other modal particles (except -il), so that
the time of the action must be gathered from the context.

CHAPTER VII.
OF ADVERBS.
77. Derived adverbs corresponding to English adverbs
in -ly are formed from adjectives by adding the particle -warr,
which is probably the root of warr-in, making, doing. Ex-
ample :
Nginte brupe-...war- kalt- in') v . ,
by thee bad making digging is _> ou badly.
78. Every adjective may be used as an adverb, without
any particle being affixed, as,
Narr-..inde yarn- in 7tt , , , ,
plain you speaking are! ou s P ea v pi ai *dy*
79. The following adverbs of time, place, &c., are those
in most common use ; some others will be found in the

CHAPTER VIII.
CONJUNCTIONS.
80. This language possesses but very few conjunctions.
It has not even the copulative conjunction “and,” which we
believe exists in almost all other languages. The five words
following are the only ones we have met with which can be
regarded as conjunctions, and of them the third latter may
perhaps with some propriety be considered as adverbs of

CHAPTER IX.'
NAMES OF PLACES.
81. As the forms assumed by the names of places are in
some respects anomalous (§ 83), we shall here give a table
exemplifying the three forms assumed by words of this class
in answer to the questions Yafiwande ? where are you going ?
Yang-inde lew-ai? where do you live? and Yand-iiide? whence
do you come ? respectively. As observed in § 82, the
simple nominative case can never be obtained Trom the
natives, which may perhaps arise from their not having any
occasion to speak of places except as respects going to,
staying at, or comin gfrom.
82. Example of Polte :
Yafiw- a.-..nde ? Polt-.an> Whither art thou going?
whither wilt thou (go) ? Polte toj To Polte.
Yang-.,iade ]sw--....ai ? Polt-...0ng7 Where are you staying ?
where you staying ? P. at > At Polte.
Yand-...inde ? Polte....noiif) Whence do you come ? From
whence thou? Polte froray Polte.

vicinity of Adelaide, belong to the Adelaide language, as
their terminations show; and, indeed, are known only to a
few individuals who have been in the habit of visiting the
Adelaide tribe, and who can speak both languages.

* The natives have four modes of disposing of their dead. Old persons are
buried. The middle-aged are placed in a tree, the hands and knees being
brought nearly to the chin, all the openings of the body—mouth, nose,
ears, &c.—being previously sewn up, and the corpse covered with mats, pieces
of net, or old clothing. The corpse being placed in the tree, a fire is made
underneath, round which the friends and relations of the deceased sit and make
a lamentation. In this situation the body remains, unless removed by some
hostile tribe, until the flesh is completely wasted away, after which the skull
is taken by the nearest relation for a drinking-vessel. The third mode is to
place the corpse in a sitting posture, without any covering, the face turned to
the east, until dried by the sun, after which it is placed in a tree. This plan is
adopted with those to whom they wish to show respect. The last mode is to
burn the body, which is practised only in the case of still-born children, or
those which die shortly after their birth.

Maiy-il-iyan luw- ur ) It has been broken by the wind ; or,
wind by it a breaking was J The wind has broken it.
-il (3), from,
Wir-in-ap yarnt-il 1 r ... ,
ill am I spear from \ 1 am 111 from a spear-wound.
il (4), with, upon.
Ngapc laggel-in k6y-....il >1 am platting a basket (basket
I platting am basket upon S made of rushes).
61


Note. The utility of the particle -il in the above and all
similar phrases is by no means obvious, as, according to
European idioms, it would seem for the participle laggel-in
to govern the object koye in the accusative case; it may,
however, be considered that the agent and its attribute are im-
mediately connected in sense, and that something is required
to call the attention to, and point out the object of the action
expressed by the participle. In the phrase—Warke laggel-in
koyel—'“The woman is making a basket”—warke is first
mentioned without any circumstance to show that it is the
agent in any action, and then the action in connexion with,
and as an attribute of, warke ; and the office of the particle
seems to be to call off the attention from the agent and its
attribute, and direct to the object. In the parallel phrase—
Wark-...il lakk-in koye woman is making a
woman by (a) platting basket (there is) j basket.
the particle -il, in the second sense above given, shows that
warke is the agent, and at once calls off the attention to the
action and object following, which seem to be considered
together in the same maimer as the agent and action in the
previous example.
