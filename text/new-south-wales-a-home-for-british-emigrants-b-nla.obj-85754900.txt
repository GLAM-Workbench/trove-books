TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES,
From whom, for twenty-three years, I have received
unnumbered favours, I cheerfully dedicate this little
Pamphlet, in the hope that it may be the means of
diffusing information concerning a Colony so admirably
adapted as a Plome for the surplus population of this
Country—a Colony whose future is so pregnant with all
that can tend to the happiness of the human race.

LECTURE
“ NEW SOUTH WALES AS A DESIRABLE PLACE
FOR BRITISH EMIGRATION.”
Me. Chairman,
In the present day, when the means of transit are so
various and rapid, when by telegraph and steam oceans and
continents are bridged, and the whole world brought so closely
together; when the great question of emigration is in the
foreground of people’s thoughts ; when there is hardly elbow-
room for the overgrown communities of Europe ; when many
are struggling, with little hope, in this dear old land, and are
asking which of the colonies presents the greatest attractions ;
where am I likely to get on the best ? which is preferable—
America or Australia? —when I hear these questions so
frequently asked, I do not think I can be properly charged
with presumption if I attempt to answer them by presenting
the claims of New South Wales as the most desirable place for
the surplus population of this country. I wish you to under-
stand that I have no purpose of my own to serve in this
Lecture. I am a clergyman of the Church of England who
has spent 23 years in the colonies, 16 in the city of Sydney,
and seven in Bathurst, a provincial town in New South Wales,
so that I may fairly claim to have had some considerable
experience in city and country life. I can say, without any
boasting, that I have taken an active part in the religious
and social movements in the colonies, and have not been
unmindful of the political questions which from time to time
have agitated the minds of the colonists, I also know some-


thing of English habits, having spent about 27 years in this
country. I only mention these facts to show that from experience
I am entitled to speak, and more, I can assure you, that my
object in delivering this Lecture is to promote the happiness
of my fellow creatures. From what I daily see around me lam
confident that a large number of persons who are overcrowded
in this tight little island would he of greater benefit to England
if they commenced life anew in the colonies ; their transference
would be a blessing to England, wealth to Australia, and a
source of unspeakable happiness to themselves. Don’t think
because lam an Australian that Ido not love England; it has
been truly said by travellers who have visited Australia that the
residents of New South Wales “ are more English than the
English.” No man is more intensely English than myself;
though Australia is my adopted country, yet I love this dear
old land —this land, notwithstanding all her defects, the envy
of the world—this land so rich in the associations of a glorious
past —this land which has a wondrous destiny, that of mould-
ing the sentiments and stimulating the energies of nations yet
unborn ; and I am persuaded the way to increase the stability
of England is to send to her vast colonies her own children,
who in those distant lands will reproduce those institutions
which are the surest pledge of a nation’s happiness, the con-
servative element in this world of fickle change. The senti-
ment which animates the heart of New South Welshmen is
well expressed in that grand old patriotic song:—
“There’s a land that hears a well-known name,
Though it is but a little spot;
’Tis the first on the blazing scroll of fame,
And who shall affirm it is not ?
For the deathless ones who shine, and live
In arms, in art, and song;
The greatest that this wide world can give,
To this little land belong.
Tis a glorious spot—deny it who can,
The island home of an Englishman.


“ The Briton may traverse the pole or zone.
And boldly claim his right;
For he calls such a vast domain his own,
That the sun never sets on his might,
Should the haughty stranger seek to know
The place of his home and birth,
And a flush will rise from cheek to brow
While he tells of his native earth.
’Tis a glorious charter —deny it who can,
That’s breathed in the words, I’m an Englishman.”
In compiling this Lecture I am greatly indebted to an
essay on New South Wales, by G. H. Reid, Esq., of Sydney,
and also to several pamphlets on New South Wales, by Chas.
Robinson, Esq., of Sydney. The figures for the most part are
taken from the Statistical Register, published by the Govern-
ment of that colony. Mr. Reid in his admirable essay
says : —“ Distance does not seem to lessen, or growth impair
the loyalty of the Australian populations to the mother-country,
but it must not be supposed they cling to her from a sense of
weakness or a want of spirit. Let those who doubt their
vigour bestow a glance upon their achievements. Within
40 years the colonists, with the concurrence of the Imperial
Government, have fringed this colony with infant States
already able to exercise the powers of elaborate political
systems, and sustain over their vast territories forms of govern-
ment which blend the freest principles of the American with
the safeguards of the British Constitution.
“ If proof of national progress is demanded, we can point to a
population which rose in 30 years from two hundred and
fourteen thousand to two million souls, or 834 per cent.,
whilst during the same period the population of Canada and
the United States increased by 660 and 136 per cent. We can
point to a trade which rose in the same generation from less
than six millions to sixty-three millions, or 950 per cent.,
whilst the wonderful increase in British trade was only 400 per
cent., that of the United States 335 per cent., and that of


Canada GSO per cent. ; and if told that Australian progress has
seen its best days, we reply that the trade of Australasia rose
from sixty-three millions in 1871 to eighty-seven millions in
1874.* If we enquire further, we learn that upwards of five
millions six hundred thousand tons of shipping entered and
cleared the ports of these colonies in 1874; that there are
seventy million head of live stock in our pastures, and nearly
five million acres of land under cultivation.
“ There are two thousand miles of railway open, and a far
greater length in progress or projected. Upwards of twenty-six
thousand miles of telegraph, to which additions are being rapidly
made, unite every part of the group with the rest of the world.
“ The amount of revenue of the several governments ap-
proaches fourteen millions sterling.
“ You have only to contrast these facts with our sparse popu-
lation to get a true idea of Australian progress. The suprising
indifference shown a few years ago by many home politicians to
the integrity of the Empire, and the stability of British great-
ness —for they are allied—have disappeared. Still it may not
be out of place to introduce facts in proof of the growing im-
portance of the Australian trade to the British people. The
value of the exports from the United Kingdom to Australian
ports in 1851 was two millions eight hundred and seven
thousand three hundred and fifty-six; in 1871 it was ten
million fifty-one thousand nine hundred and eighty-two. In
■other words, our market for British industry and commerce
lias been enlarged in tAventy years by over 250 per cent., as
the exports for 1871 of British produce and manufactures to
all colonial dependencies Avas thirty-three millions and a
quarter, and that to Australia and New Zealand Avas 30 per cent,
of the Avhole. The proportion is now much larger, for the
exports in 1873 to these colonies rose to a declared value of
seventeen millions, an increase of OA r er seven millions and-a-half,
or 75 per cent, in tAvo years.” And to slioav still more the

since that period.


prosperous character of Australian trade, the total imports to
New South Wales alone, in 1878, was’fourteen millions seven
hundred and sixty-eight thousand pounds; and of this about
seven millions was imported direct from Great. Britain.
I wish it to be clearly understood that my Lecture has
reference principally to New South Wales, for it should always
be borne in mind that Australia is divided into five flourishing
colonies with independent Legislatures—Western Australia,
South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales.
New South Wales is the oldest of this group—the parent of
this goodly race of thriving children.
The geography of Australia is very little understood in some
parts of England, at least by a great many people. I have had
persons send to me a request that I, residing in New South
Wales, would just take a walk over and call upon Mr. or Mrs.
So-and-so some fine morning in South Australia, this little
undertaking involving only a walk of about 2,000 miles. I
confine my remarks to New South Wales, because there,
as I have said before, I have spent the best 23 years of my life.
There was a time in the history of Australia when a man
did not care about owning himself as a resident of the far
famed Botany Bay, and I little thought over 40 years ago
when I heard such terrible stories of the place that the hap-
piest days of my life would be spent so near it.
It is well known that on the 28th of April, 1770, one hundred
and ten years ago, Captain Cook, one of nature’s noblemen,
whose deeds in the field of exploration and of science will
shed lustre upon his name throughout all time, landed near
Sydney at a place called Botany Bay. The important event of
the great discoverer first stepping on shore has been com-
memorated by the Philosophical Society of Sydney placing a
plate of copper, with a suitable inscription on it, on the over-
hanging cliffs above the spot where he landed; near that place
I have often wandered and pondered over the Providential
guidance in connexion with his discovery of Australia, and the
subsequent possession of it by the British race.


Only last year a monument was erected in Hyde Park,,
Sydney, at great cost, to the world-famed hero. It represents
him as gazing out to sea with a telescope in his hand, his
features expressive of a desire to find out other lands.
New South Wales is the largest of all the colonies in the
extent of its territory, and more than that, it is thoroughly
English in its forms of social life ; and above all, the most,
richly blessed by a kind and beneficent Creator in its varieties,
of soil, climate, and mineral wealth.
It lies between the parallel of 28° and 37° South latitude,
and within the 141° and 154 y meridians of East longitude.
The country is warm and dry; great varieties of temperature are
occasionally experienced for short periods, but on the average
of years the difference between the mean temperature of sum-
mer and winter is not more than 20°. Mr. Charles Eobinson
very graphically says, “New South Wales embraces a magnifi-
cent territory of 323,437 square miles —an area equal to that of
France, Great Britain, and Ireland combined, and larger than
any European State with the single exception of Eussia.
“ The whole of this territory lies beyond the Tropics, within
the most favoured belt in the world, and instead of being the.
barren, sandy desert which early explorers imagined, comprises-
some of the most valuable agricultural areas, and some of the
richest and most extensive natural pasture lands to be found in
the world. The physical aspect of the colony is very marked,
and may be easily described. Through its entire length a.
mountain range stretches from north to south, throwing out
spurs to the east and west, but in the main running parallel
with the coast at a distance varying from about 25 ■to 120-
miles. This range, known in its southern portion as the.
Australian Alps, and further north as the Blue Mountains,
widens out at intervals on to rough table-lands of 20 or 30
miles in extent, with lofty peaks varying in height from 3,000
to 7,000 feet, abounding with the wildest and most picturesque
scenery, and forming the water-shed of the Continent, from
which innumerable tributaries supply the rivers which drain


the western interior on that side and flow into the Pacific-
Ocean on the East.
“ The mountain tract is for the most part sterile and unpro-
ductive to the agriculturist, long a terror to the early settlers,
by whom it was considered impassable, hut it makes ample
amends by the inexhaustible treasures of gold, copper, tin,,
iron, coal and oil, to he found in its offshoots and at its foot in
all directions.
“ Beyond this range there is a gradual slope to the vast plains-
of the interior, where millions of sheep and cattle roam at large,
and enrich the enterprising settler with their produce, fed upon
the natural grasses alone. The narrow strip lying between
the dividing range and the coast is the oldest settled and
most populous, intersected with many small rivers, undulating,
with hill and dale, in some places well wooded, and at intervals
presenting whole districts of the richest soil, adapted for all
kinds of agriculture. These towns and villages are to be met
with every few miles, and pretty villas, country seats, and
homesteads peep through the bush or nestle in the meadows
on all sides.
“ The coast line measures over 800 miles, broke with many
bold headlands, and indented with numerous bays, mostly
narrow at the entrance, some of them leading to noble rivers,,
impeded with sand-bars but capable of being easily cleared,
and affording ports and harbours of refuge in stress of weather.
“ The capital of the colony, Sydney, stands at the head of
Port Jackson, a harbour of romantic beauty and surpassing
loveliness, not having its equal in the w r orld, wooded to the
water’s edge, but broken at intervals with frowning cliffs that
run to the height of 300 feet, and stretching inland in a
hundred finely rounded bays, presenting every variety of form,,
and fringed with wreaths of white foam all along the lines of
glittering sand.
“ Here, land-locked and secure, all the mercantile and armed
fleets of the world may ride at anchor at one time, and leave
space enough for the increase of one hundred years.”


The metropolis of New South Wales is Sydney. The
population of this city and suburbs is almost 180,000, and I can
say without any fear of contradiction that it can compare with
.any city in the world of its size for the beauty of its public
buildings, enterprise, and trade, and all the manifestations of a
great commercial entrepot. It has been said by an English
writer:—
“It is the sailor’s delight to be snugly moored in Sydney
Cove at the present day as it was to the captains of the first
fleet that entered Port Jackson. As the traveller or emigrant
passes between the perpendicular and overhanging cliffs that
stand at its entrance, like the portals of some giant edifice, he
is struck with feelings of dread at the swell of the Pacific
Ocean, and the rocky desolation around.
“ This is suddenly changed to pleasure as the picturesque
scenery of the inner harbour opens up its panoramic beauty,
and he sails along a lake-like inlet, where the agitation of the
sea ceases, as the ship passes a succession of bays and coves
indemted by exquisite points of land, and guarded by small
islets, he is charmed with the fairy-like aspect of the scenery ;
and when the captain informs him that each of these bays is
deep enough to float a line of battle ship, with sufficient room
to hold all the navies of Europe, he cannot but marvel at the
maritime advantages of Sydney Harbour.
“Then, as the ship comes to anchor, the city appears the
perfection of a great seaport.
“It has landing facilities at quays where the largest merchant-
men moor alongside, and there is no current or impetuous tide
to endanger the shipping, no dirty muddy streams around
the ships, no dingy-looking warehouses to offend the eye —
all is bright, clean, and wholesome, spreading a cheerful
aspect around the harbour. The clear waters below, and
the bright blue sky overhead, throw out in bold relief the
white freestone buildings that compose the city; extensive
suburbs spread in every direction. Here dwells a population
of 180,000, surrounded by all that is magnificent in nature, and


the architectural designs of Greece and Rome have a habitation
and name beneath a sky that surpasses in purity and intensity
of blue the far-famed skies of Italy.”
Besides, the port is free—no vexatious imposts retard or
fetter trade, for the people of New South Wales believe in that
policy which has strengthened and developed the resources of
the mother-country, and which has done so much to place her
in the Imperial position she occupies to-day among the nations
of the world.
“ Here, on the 26th of January, 1788, the first Governor,
Captain Philip, landed with his rough colonist band of 1,030
people and his scanty supply of 431 head of cattle, poultry, and
live stock, all told.” In 1850 the population of the colony was
265,503; in 1851 the southern portion was formed into the
Colony of Victoria, taking 68,335 of the population and
6,000,000 head of sheep and cattle. In 1859 the northern
portion was separated to form the Colony of Queensland,
taking 25,000 of the population and 2,419,000 sheep and cattle;
yet, and I wish you to remember this, on the 31st of December,
1878, the population of New South Wales was 693,743.
The number of live-stock, 31st March, 1879, the property of
35,435 stockholders, was 27,295,424 ; horses, 336,468 ; cattle,
2,771,583; pigs, 220,320; sheep, 23,967,53. Within a brief
period —in the lives of some among us —a city has been founded
containing a population of 180,000. Not less than 650 post towns
have been built, some of them approaching the magnitude of
cities, one of them at a distance of 944 miles from the Metropolis.
As an indication of the prosperity of the country, I may
state that on the 31st December, 1878, the amount of money
at the credit of 32,644 depositors in the Government savings
bank was 1,333,017.
The number of Government Post office savings banks
throughout the colony was 166 ; the amount at the credit of
18,957 depositors on the Ist of January, 1878, was 467,452.
There are ten banking companies carrying on business in
New South Wales.


Their total liabilities were 18 millions, and their assets 22j
millions.
Their paid-up capital amounted to £7,930,000, the amount of
their dividends for the year, £517,000, their reserved profit at
the time of making such dividend was nearly £3,000,000.
The total amount of coin and bullion held by the banks and
Mint was about £3,000,000, and the total amount coined at
the Sydney branch of the Eoyal Mint up to the present year is
about 44 millions sterling.
At the several banks there are 12 millions of deposits bearing
interest, and 5 millions not bearing interest.
The agricultural returns to the 31st March, 1879, show that
there were 378,876 occupiers of land (excluding those for
pastoral purposes). The total extent of holdings was 21,471,596
acres ; of this area 613,642 acres were in cultivation, 15,903,803
acres were enclosed but not in cultivation, and 4,954,150
acres were unenclosed. The following figures show the area
occupied by and the produce obtained from each crop :

free, 9,469,200, of which 1,657,600 are foreign and 7,811,600
are inland.
The general total value of imports for 1878 amounted to
£14,768,873 sterling; exports, £12,965,879, making a total
trade of £27,734,752, Tl:e excess of imports .to exports
amounted to £1,802,994, The value of imports of the mean
population was * £2l 15s. Bd. per head, and of exports
£l9 2s. sfd. ; of this trade of £27,000,000 upwards of
£12,000,000 was done with the United Kingdom.
The total value of wool exported being the produce of the
colony amounted in value to £5,723,316. The value of wool
exported to Victoria was £2,153,399 sterling.
The general total of vessels entering the various ports of the
colony during the year 1878 was 2,469, comprising 1,580 sailing
and 889 steam vessels. The total numbers under the head of
British possessions were 2,282; American, 91; French, 31,
and the remainder under various nationalities.
The country abounds in minerals of all descriptions.
The estimated value of the gold raised from the year 1851 to

Passing, then, from these dry, yet important facts, I would
remark, that the climate of the colony is most genial, and
highly favourable to health ; every variety of temperature is to
foe found within so vast an area, and with such varied physical
features.
“ On the table lands frost, snow, and hail are common ; on
the inland plains the thermometer is over 100° in the shade
in the greater part of the summer; but in Sydney, which is
central, the mean temperature is only 62°, similar to
that of Lisbon, the extreme range in the shade being 106°
in summer, and 36° in winter. On the whole there are
few parts of the colony where the heat is more trying
than the hot summer months in England, while nowhere,
except at a few places on the summit of the mountain ranges,
is there anything of the rigorous English winter. The air is
clear and bracing; the light gorgeous; the sky for an average
of 200 days in the year cloudless ; the nights most enjoyable,
with bright constellations of stars well defined spread over the
whole of the heavens, and the moon when full giving light
enough to read by, and revealing the whole landscape beneath.
“ Small pox and many ailments of children, and infectious
diseases, so natural to this country, are unknown, and some
that have been imported quickly died out.
“ Even with the unsettled life incident to a new country, its
vital statistics compare favourably with those of almost any
other part of the world, and give a far higher average of life
than those of the United Kingdom. In no part of the British
Empire are life and property more secure ; even in the mining
districts, where a rush of 10,000 persons occasionally takes
place in a few weeks, there is less crime and disorder than in
many English towns of the same number of inhabitants. The
whole country is divided into police districts, and in the far
interior whatever crime may be committed seldom escapes
detection and punishment.”
The Aboriginals, a harmless race, are fast dying out. No
coloured labour is employed in New South Wales. There are


a few thousand Chinese in the colony. I have seen a good
deal of them in the interior, and I consider them to be good
citizens, frugal in their habits, industrious, and almost indis-
pensable to the agriculturist, especially at harvest time; their
principal occupation is in rearing vegetables, and in this their
industry ensures success. There was a scare about them a
few months ago ; people were afraid that the Chinese were about
to supplant the British workman; mass meetings were held,
the Larrakins insulted the Chinese, a good deal was said by
politicians that ought never to have been said, but I am of
opinion that many who took part in the agitation misappre-
hended its importance, and see their mistake. At the same time,
nobody desires the wholesale importation of Chinese. The
.subject is many-sided, and must be approached in a calm and
impartial spirit.
More than half the population are native born, of the true
English type, more so probably than in any other colony.
National animosities such as cause so much anxiety in the
United States scarcely exist here.
Roman Catholics and Protestants live side by side, mid
although each maintains his own view with a considerable
degree of warmth, yet their differences of opinion do not
involve broken heads.
“ Secure in the enjoyment of political and religious equality,
all classes are order-loving and law-abiding. Political and
religious differences scarcely ever lead to a breach of the peace,
not even during the most excited Parliamentary and Municipal
elections. Public schools are established in every part of the
colony, being erected and endowed by Parliament. These
schools are highly efficient, and are available for all classes of
the community. Three-fourths of the population are settled in
cities and towns, where all the comforts of English life are
common to every home, and few of the pastoral population are
more than two days’ ride from some centre where supplies may
be obtained at reasonable prices.”
There is a richly-endowed University, with professors of


European reputation ; and in connection with these are affiliated
colleges attached to the leading denominations in the colony;
so that while due attention is paid to the secular studies, the
training of the moral and religious is not lost sight of.
The university is open to all classes. There are several
bursaries for those who are in want of means to prosecute their
studies, and the Government are instituting exhibitions from
the public schools of the colony for the scholars who have
attained the greatest degree of efficiency.
Wages are high and work plentiful. The eight-hour system
is almost universal. Persons understanding agriculture are
very scarce, and though in the capital there are some unem-
ployed, and some loafers who talk but never work, yet no man
or woman, when willing and able to work, need ever be long
out of employment; and I believe I am under the mark in
stating that the colony, at the least, could absorb yearly 25,000
immigrants. Of these 7,000 or 8,000 should be agricul-
turists.
“ Why should the labourer, the artizan, the small capitalist
toil, often through a weary life, in the over-crowded markets of
the Old World when, under the same Crown, the same laws,
and among a people of the same race and language, they may
find a ready welcome, full employment, liberal wages, large
profits, and every facility for acquiring land and possessing
homes of their own.”
Is it nothing for the labourer to have good beef and mutton
everyday in the week at 2d. to 3d. per lb., and also the means
to purchase it, besides being able to put by something for a
rainy day ?
Bear in mind that every good emigrant is wealth to the
colony and wealth to England, for her trade with her 2,000,000
Australian children ranks next in value to her trade with India
■with its 200,000,000. Do you want customers in England ? Con-
trive, then, to send out to the colonies some of your surplus
population, and convert that which is now a confessed weak-
ness into a source of strength.


We promise to no one immunity from toil; you won’t get on
without hard work; you must put your shoulder to the wheel;
you must be self-reliant; gold is not found in the streets;
bread is not rained down from heaven. If a man will not work
then let him starve.
“ The lazy, the improvident, the blow-flies of society, the
drunkards and the dandies, such as abound in all large cities,
and are a curse and nightmare to any community where they
dwell—these will not do for a young country, hut honest,
manly labour, and capital, in small or great sums seeking in-
vestment, these may come with a certainty of success;” and
I predict that if the class I have indicated come out to New
South Wales they will never regret the step they have taken
in casting in their lot with their brethren who dwell in this
sunny land.
At the same time, a writer on the colonies has wisely said,
“ None possessed of competence in the mother-country, with
fair prospects of its continuance, and who value an easy and
comfortable life, can be advised to convert themselves into
Australian colonists. On the other hand, all who desire to
exchange a condition of virtual or comparative poverty for a
moderate competence, with fair prospects of wealth into the
bargain, or to turn their labour or capital to better use, or to
obtain higher wages or profits from the ordinary run of industry
or investment, or who are not afraid to venture their time and
means upon reasonable chances of success, will do well to try
their luck, and are not unlikely to have their hopes fulfilled and
aspirations satisfied, in the Australian colonies,”
I hope it will not be inferred that there are not times of
depression in the colonies. Of course there are. It is insepar-
able from the nature of things ; there will be ebbs and flows—
but I feel assured that, should there be, from causes external to
the country, or from long-continued drought, or from deprecia-
tion in the value of the exports, that which causes a temporary
ebb, and produces in the minds of some the most gloomy
forebodings, yet the advancing tide of prosperity will soon


obliterate the remembrance of those adverse times, and carry
up the national hope still higher and higher.
There are many advocates of a Protective policy in the
colony, but my experience teaches me that, as a rule, they are
born of, and are the outcome of, a melancholy distrust of the
future. They are to me like persons who have strong limbs,
but who declare they are weak, and will persist in using
crutches. Times, from some cause or other, become unsatis-
factory—there is a lull in the tide of prosperity (as if it was
reasonable to suppose that there are to be no dull days). The
dulness must be attributed to some cause, and free trade gets
abused. People don’t so much attack the principles of free
trade, these are impregnable, but they cry out, give us Protec-
tion to native industry—in other words, close our ports against
the nations of the world; let us make our people buy in the
dearest market, let us isolate ourselves from the great world
outside us; let us force, by unnatural and artificial means, indus-
tries which are not, and, from the nature of things, never can
be, self-supporting. These, in fact, are the cries heard when
clouds lower —yet, notwithstanding this, I believe the people of
New South Wales are against a tariff Protective in its character.
Again, I know there are a considerable number of persons, and
I shall not infringe upon the rules of good taste if I call them a
little noisy, who protest against anymore assisted immigration.
They want to make New South Wales a place for a small
family part) r . They say, Are not 600,000 people enough for this
country ? It is astonishing how selfish human nature is, how
contracted we get in our ideas by reasoning in a circle of
misconception.
Did God make that grand and glorious land, with all its
marvellous resources, its vast acres, its pastoral domains, its
wheat and vine producing soils, its inexhaustible mineral
wealth, all to fall into the hands of as many people as would
make up one respectable English town? Unmitigated bosh ! !
Sheer nonsense ! ! We want population—population wisely
chosen. We don’t want what are vulgarly called the “rag-


tag” of England or Ireland. We don’t want the scum floating
about your large centres of population, but we do leant bone
and brain and muscle, and you have got these to spare. We
want strong hands and hopeful hearts. We don’t want the
Micawbers nor the Stigginses of society ; but we want men
who are not afraid of work —men who will be content
to rough it for a time —who will put up with the ups
and downs, and smile at difficulties as things that must be
overcome. Give us such men; no matter how large their
families —the more the better. Give us agricultural labourers
who can mow, and sow, and reap —young farmers who love to
turn up their sleeves, and like to be up early in the morning.
We don’t want a ship-load of “ glass eye makers ” or “ cotton
spinners.” Give us a good sprinkling of virtuous domestic
servants who don’t want to be fine ladies. Give us population
of this character, and depend upon it they will repay the dear
Old Country with gratitude, and strengthen the bonds that
unite this mighty Empire.
I know a good few persons who come out with very sanguine
expectations, and who, because they don t just fall into a place
in a few weeks, get disgusted with the colony, and go back
again, and give the colony a bad name. Others come, and
when they get out feel that they have left their friends behind
them, get home-sick, and return. Others —one-handed people
w ho, when they don’t get employment just in the same
groove they did at home, say all manner of evil against the
place. There are some who are very unfortunate. They
arrive at a time of depression, and they say, We have been
gulled by gross misrepresentation. In*spite of all this I make
bold to say that to the industrious, thrifty, and contented
workman there is no colony in the world to equal New South
Wales. Within the last twenty years I have induced a con-
siderable number to emigrate, and I can solemnly state that,
going over their names in my memory, contrasting the
position they occupied in the Old Country, and seeing what
each is doing to-day, without one solitary exception they have


all raised themselves immeasurably in the social scale, and are
securing a competency to gladden their declining days.
The colony suffers a good deal from persons who, when they
have obtained wealth in the colony, go to the Old World,
speak evil of everything colonial, and leave their property to be
taken care of at the expense of the State, whilst they pay no
fair quota towards the maintenance of the State itself.
There are some people who are clamorous about the rights
of property, but who, strange to say, forget its responsibilities.
The question very naturally asked by the intending emigrant
is, What are my prospects of getting land? That question is
easily answered. The Land Law of the colony is one of the
most liberal in the world. The desire of the Government is to
settle an industrious yeoman population on the soil. For this end
a Bill was brought in by Sir John Bohertson, K.C.M.G., and
passed through the Parliament, known as the “ Free Selection
Act,” by which any person over the age of sixteen could select
any Government land from 40 to 320 acres (it has since been
increased to 640 acres), at the rate of 20s. per acre. What is
required is that he shall pay 25 per cent, down in cash. The
remaining 75 per cent, is thrown over a period of about 20
years. And as it is the intention of the law, in affording these
easy terms, to open up the agricultural lands as widely as
possible to the freehold possession of the bona fide settler,
it is rendered compulsory on the purchaser to reside three
years upon his own land, and to improve it to the value of 10s,
per acre. These conditions are found necessary to prevent
the defeat of the scheme by large tracts of land being cheaply
accumulated by capitalists.
Australia presents a wide field for enterprise, and to no class
does she offer greater inducements than to the bona fide farmer.
What a prospect is open to the industrious yeoman ! There is
land within easy access to the railway second to none in the
world. Land which will grow wheat 30 bushels to the acre,
maize 60 bushels to the acre, and the variety of products such
as sugar, tobacco, lucerne, arrowroot, as well as the ordinary


English crops, give opportunity for enterprise which cannot be
possibly found in England; and this land, as I said before,
can become his freehold at 20s. per acre. Should he desire to
become a pastoralist, he can rent blocks of country at a
nominal price.
Besides a great part of the colony being adapted to the
growth of corn, the Hunter Valley and the districts bordering
upon the sea to the north and south of Sydney are well suited
to the orange (as many as 10,000 have been gathered in one
year as the produce of one tree), which fruit is grown in
great quantities, and forms a large item in our exports to the
neighbouring colonies. Other fruits, such as the peach, nec-
tarine, and apricot are produced in great abundance. I have
often seen delicious peaches given to the pigs.
In the colder districts English fruits abound, such as cherries,
apples, pears, plums, and gooseberries ; currants and straw-
berries grow in great luxuriance. Figs and grapes grow more
plentifully than blackberries in England.
The vine flourishes in almost every district in the colony,
and Australian wine is now shipped to all parts of the
world.
New South Wales being a dependency of Great Britain,
its laws are identical with those of England; a Governor is
appointed by the Crown, but he seldom interferes except on
questions of Imperial interest.
The Parliament is comprised of two Houses. The members
of the Upper House are appointed by the Executive for life ;
members of the Lower House are elected by the people.
Electors include all males of the age of 21 years, provided they
are on the electoral roll, and have been residents over six
months in one defined place of abode, and are subjects of the
British Crown.
There are statesmen in both Houses who would add lustre
to the British Parliament, and, take representative institutions
as a whole, they have contributed to the welfare and happiness
of the people.


The administration of Justice, whether in the Supreme or
District Courts, is presided over by judges who have the con-
fidence of the public, and the colony may well be proud of the
men who sit upon her Bench and the men who practice at her
Bar.
The Press of the colony is Very much like what it is in
England—the guardian of the liberties of the people —conducted
with great ability and free from that sensationalism which too
often degrades itself and demoralises the people.
The colonists, as I have said before, are order-loving and law-
abiding, and on a public holiday, which is one of the institutions
of the colony, among 100,000 persons, well-dressed and con-
tented, and bent upon enjoyment, you will scarcely find a case
lemanding the interference of the police.
Outdoor amusements are indulged in very freely, and in
cricket, with the rifle, and on the water, New South Wales can
more than hold her own.
The unpleasant circumstance which occurred last year in
connection with the cricket match in Sydney has been
magnified into undue and unjust proportions-, and is unworthy
of the magnanimity which ought to characterise the lovers of
that grand old English game.
The colony is essentially Democratic, but the people are
intensely loyal; it is also singularly free from demagogues,
although at times they appear upon the colonial stage.
The fact is, there is no political grievance, and vote by ballot
has purified the elections. Open voting would, I feel assured,
be a curse to Australia. We should have elections degenerate
into religious faction-fights, where Catholic and Protestant
would be set against each other, for both Protestant and
Catholic are full of energy, each seeking to obtain the mastery.
The Catholics number a fraction under a third of the popula-
tion, but they are a great political power, and statesmen some-
times do what is done here, pander to them on purpose to
obtain the Catholic vote. I have very strong views on Protes-
tantism myself. I believe the future of that great country


depends a good deal upon the handing down to future genera-
tions the Reformed faith ; but I am quite willing to admit that
the great body of Catholics in Australia are excellent citizens,
and many among them are gifted with no ordinary genius.
Although New South Wales is Democratic, yet all the leading
men in the country see the necessity of having the people
educated; and, to the honour of the community be it said,
last year the sum of about £400,000 was voted out of the
Consolidated Revenue as a grant towards the common schools
of the country. In 1878 there were 1,189 schools under the
Council of Education, with 128,125 scholars.
The system of education in New South Wales is, I believe,,
one of the very best in the world, and it has produced marvel-
lous results. Sir Henry Parkes,K.C.M.G., the present Premier,
introduced a Bill into the Legislature in 1866, and it has
become associated with his name, which will cause his exertions
on behalf of the education of the people to be held in remem-
brance long after his voice has ceased to be heard in the
political arena.
The system is divided between National and Denomina-
tional ; the Denominational element is the only weak part of
the system, because it fosters the erection of small rival schools
where there is only room for one good public school.
The National schools are secular, with the exception that every
facility is given to ministers of religion to instruct the children
of their own denomination for one hour each day in class-rooms
built for that purpose ; the books of the Irish National Board
are the reading-books adopted, and they contain a great deal of
biblical teaching.
In the Denominational schools the same lesson-books are used,
the same secular teaching, the same inspection, the first hour
of the day being devoted to religious instruction. Just as I left
Australia the public mind was very much agitated on account
of a series of pastorals issued by the Roman Catholic bishops,
denouncing in the strongest language the common schools of
the colony as seed-plots of immorality, lawlessness, and infi-


delity, and forbidding Catholic parents to send their children to
the schools under the penalty of excommunication. Many of
the Catholic laity protested against the pastorals, as being un-
wise, and unsupported by facts, and likely to set on fire religious
animosities ; a bitter controversy was raging in the colony
when I left.
The Government, seeing the continued discord produced by
having two sets of schools under one system, have brought in
a Bill* to abolish Denominational schools after a given period.
The Press of the country is with the Ministry, and the elec-
tions that have taken place plainly indicate that the people will
no longer tolerate any more grants being paid out of the revenue
of the country towards the support of Denominational schools.
It pleasing fact that amid all the evidences of material
progress the essential element which gives to the State its
greatest security has not been lost sight of —without it what is
there to glory in ? You may have a splendid structure, adorned
with all that is magnificent, but if the foundation is not secure
the edifice will be like that house which was built upon the sand
—it will not outlive the storm that some day will beat upon it.
Depend upon it, religion is the golden bolt which binds
together the diverse interests of the State ; it secures the rights
of property as well as the rights of the individual conscience ; it
gives the truest value to the morality of a people, purifies the
intelligence, and directs the national judgment. Over the
portals of every free country there should be engraven the
utterance: “Righteousness exalteth a nation; sin is a re-
proach to any people.” Apart from the different views in
regard to man’s individual salvation, no wise man will lightly
account those aspirations which belong to man in his spiritual
relationships, but will seek to respect them as the best
guardians of the virtue of its citizens and the stability of the
Constitution.
From the Ecclesiastical Returns I find that in the year 1878
* The Bill has been passed which will take all aid from Denominational
schools in three years.


there were 1,250 churches and chapels in the colony; number
of ministers of all denominations, 631; number of sittings,
198,000 ; average attendance on Sundays, 200,000.
The Church of England is the leading denomination, with
207 ordained ministers and about 40 catechists; Roman
Catholics, 164; Presbyterians, 83; Wesleyan Methodists, 89 ;
Congregationalists, about 30. The various religious bodies are
active, and are each represented by men of mark. It augurs
well for the future that sojnany men of culture in the different
Christian organisations are labouring earnestly in this young
country to implant those Divine principles which are insepar-
able from a nation’s greatness.
There are 86,014 Sunday scholars in the colony, with 8,063
teachers.
It is with no ordinary feelings of pride that I rejoice in the
marked progress of the Church of England in New South Wales.
Much of this is to be attributed to the indefatigable exertions
of that wise and sagacious counsellor, Dr. Barker, the Bishop
of Sydney, and Metropolitan, who has for twenty-five years
guided the spiritual instincts of a great and free people. The
Church of England, taken as a whole, is moderate in tone, and
Evangelical in its character. Ritualism does not thrive —men
have too much to do in connection with the real practical work
of the ministry to find time to fight about the colour of a stole,
or waste money over elaborate vestments for the celebra-
ting priest; a man who has to ride on horseback sometimes
60 miles on a Sunday, and preach three times, has something
else to do than seeing after playthings which are more fit for a
nursery than a church.
The desire of the Bishops is to find earnest men whose great
aim is the salvation of immortal souls, and in this they have
been successful. There are five dioceses in New South Wales —
Sydney, Golbourn, Newcastle, Grafton and Armidale, and
Bathurst —presided over by prelates sound in the faith and de-
voted to the interests of the people. There is no aid given to
religion from the State ; each denomination rests for support


upon its own members. And I thank God the Church of
England in Australia has done well, though left to her own
innate resources; it is true we have not the noble structures
which are the glory of this dear old land —those historic fanes
which are the memorials of a people’s faith.
We have not in every village the tapering spire pointing
heavenward, nor sweet church bells calling worshippers into
the presence of the Eternal, but we have buildings which do
credit to a people’s love for God, fyid in every place there is
evidenced a desire to meet the growdng wants of an increasing
population. It may be asked if things are so bright and rosy
in the colony, how is it that appeals are so frequently made to
the people of England for aid towards religious works ?*
The answer is very simple. Everything has to be done.
Churches have to be built, parsonage houses and Sunday
schools to be erected, a salary to be provided for a resident
minister. And who are to do all this ? —the settlers, who many
of them have just come out, and whose minds are occupied as
to how to get on ? Impossible ! Bear in mind that w T e have
not only to provide for our own wants, but for those who are
daily coming to our shores —people often without means, and
people who have had the privileges of an endowed Church and
have never been trained to give. Here, a great deal has been
done by the piety of } f our ancestors. These grand buildings
which are the glory of our land, parishes with endowments,
these are the outflow of the love of former ages. In a new
diocese none of these things are to be found. It is a noble
work, a glorious work, to perpetuate the love of Him who died
for us, to carry on to future ages the story which has not lost
its power to charm. You have great privileges in this land—
privileges shared by no country under heaven. Oh, will you
not give of the crumbs which fall from your richly-laden table
to help those who pine for religious ordinances in the regions
* The colonies are greatly indebted to the Colonial and Continental Church
Society, of Sergeant’s Inn, Fleet Street, London, for the aid granted by them
for missionary woik.

beyond ? I know the difficulties of the minister in the interior
of Australia, and I do affirm that not only is it a duty, but
it ought to be considered as a cause for thankfulness, to be
permitted to extend and strengthen the Church of our fathers
in the distant parts of England’s Empire.

And if you make up your mind to emigrate, don’t go by a
sailing vessel. Steam is preferable. Don’t conjure up any grave
forebodings as to the voyage ; a great deal too much is made of
it—it is not a dreadful thing at all. I have made six passages,
three out and three home, and although I have been jammed
in the ice 3° below Cape Horn, and have been upwards of
a fortnight in successive gales in the English Channel, yet I
can affirm there is a bright side, a very bright side, to a voyage
to Australia. In a week or two after leaving the white cliffs of
Albion you get into a delicious temperature, which you will
thoroughly enjoy till you are near the Line, the heat on which
is seldom inconvenient; you then make for the Cape of Good
Hope ; you will touch at Adelaide and Melbourne, where you
can land if you desire. In about forty days from starting
from England, you will sight Sydney Heads, and soon be
moored in the finest harbour of the world, surrounded by all
the comforts of the Old World, in a climate unequalled for its
exhilarating and life-imparting power, and beneath a sky fairer


than that of Italy. In your passage you will see sunsets the
most glorious and picturesque—flying-fish darting with lightning
speed above the crested waves, looking like silver arrows
shot from a well-strung bow; the beautiful dolphin, with
his coat of many colours; the strange-looking albercore
and benita; you will see porpoises, like wayside acrobats,
turning summersaults for your amusement; huge whales
basking in supreme indolence, and spouting up streams of
water for your diversion. Birds in many varieties you will
see—Mother Carey’s chicken, or “ stormy petrel,” for which
sailors have a superstitious reverence, believing each bird to be
the living embodiment of some ship-wrecked mariner; Cape
pigeons, and Cape hens, and that king of sea-birds the albatross,
measuring 12 feet from wing to wing. You will listen to the
music of God’s great organ, the mighty ocean, and the song of
sailors as they pull on the slackened sheets, or haul taut the
braces, for they do all their work with a song, and the harmony
is more than pleasing, as at night-time you hear the sound of
their voices borne upon the wind. You will see other vessels,
and speak them, too, bearing the products of the world to
different parts. You will see flags of all nations, but none you
will greet with so much joy as “ that flag which has braved a
thousand years the battle and the breeze.” You will suffer
some slight inconvenience, perhaps, by being pitched out of
your berth by the sudden rolling of the vessel; you may feel at
times a strange indescribable creeping over the top of your
head, gradually descending to the spinal marrow, terminating
in a desire to feed the fish with the meal you have just
swallowed. You will declare that you are not sick, and
then relapse into a state which language is not able to describe;
you may wish, more than once, that you had stayed at
home —you may perhaps cry out for your mother, but these
slight and passing inconveniences will only help to fill your
log-book with graphic incidents in relation to your yielding
nature, and cause you to be an authority on the best way to
cure sea sickness when you get on shore.


If you should determine to set sail for Australia, I strongly
recommend you to go by the Orient Line ; their vessels are
magnificent, and the universal testimony of those who have
travelled in them is, that they present the cheapest and best
method of reaching our Australian colonies.
The steamers are amongst the largest afloat, averaging
between 4,000 and 5,000 tons register each, and are of pro-
portionate horse-power, enabling them to make the passage
each way in 40 days; one of the vessels, indeed, has made the
trip from Plymouth to Adelaide, a distance of over 12,000
miles, under 35 days. The steamers are built in water-tight
compartments, and are fitted with all the most modern improve-
ments for the safety and comfort of passengers, amongst which
may be mentioned steam-heating apparatus for use in cold
weather, punkahs for the tropics, ice-house, baths, smoking-
room, barber’s shop, pianos, library, &c.
All classes of passengers are carried, the fares ranging from
14 to 70 guineas. This is inclusive of board, the food provided
being ample in quantity and of the best quality. Stewards’
attendance is given not only to the first and second but also to
the steerage passengers, no less than 40 to 50 stewards
being carried in each vessel. The ships are in fact large
floating hotels, and even medical attendance is given to those
requiring it, without charge.
The monotony of a long sea voyage by sailing ship is avoided
in the steamers, not only by the rapidity of the passage but by
the pleasing breaks in the journey afforded by the steamers
calling at sundry places for coals and fresh provisions. Out-
wards these are the Cape de Verde and the Cape of Good Hope
before reaching Adelaide, the steamers thence proceeding to
Melbourne and Sydney. Passengers for New Zealand are
transferred to steamers of the Union Steam Ship Company
of New Zealand, which run in connection with the Orient
vessels. In returning from Australia the steamers take a
straight course through the.lndian Ocean to the Gulf of Aden,
then up the Red Sea to Suez, through the Canal to Port


Said, next along the Mediterranean to Naples, thence to
Plymouth and London.
The steamers sail punctually every fortnight, and full infor-
mation can be obtained from the Managers of the Line, Messrs.
F. Green and Co., and Anderson, Anderson and Co., Fenchurch
Avenue, London, E.C.
Take with you clothing suitable for cold and warm weather ;
burden yourself with as little luggage as possible—don’t take
two boxes if you can put your things in one ; be very careful
of ship acquaintances ; don’t be too communicative ; avoid
gambling and drinking as you would a serpent; take plenty of
exercise; use cold water freely inside and out; don’t be
crotchety —take things as they come, and mix the sauce of
content with the sometimes overdone and underdone provisions
from the harassed cook ; above all, seek God’s blessing ; never
be ashamed to pray to the God of your fathers, and, by Plis
kind providence, you will find that a voyage to Australia is more
pleasurable than otherwise.
Should you have a favourable passage by steam, you will, in
about 40 days, land in Sydney, which you will find at the head
of the finest harbour in the world. The public buildings,
churches, &c., rival those of the Old Country. When we
reflect that one hundred years ago Sydney was an untrodden
waste, only disturbed by the wild man’s corroboree; that
nature was unsubdued; and when it appeared that God had
made the land for nought; when we think that within that
brief space the land has been possessed in the highest sense ;
that the place once hushed in the death stillness of inactivity
is now instinct with life; that to what is glorious in
Nature Art has lent her decorative charms, and embellished the
Queen of the South with all the adornment that wealth can
give ; that now as well as the sound of the hammer and the
o 7
“ fall of the flail,” and the roar of the furnace for six days in
the week, on Sabbath-days the sounds which tell of another
life, and point to realms beyond —the voice of bells, sweet
church bells —break upon the ear in whispering harmonies of


heavenly music, recalling memories of home, and pointing
to the bright to-morrow, proclaiming that the messenger of
mercy is about to tell of the glories of the Cross, and inviting
men to worship at the footstool of Him who delights in the
praises of His people. When we reflect that all this subjuga-
tion of nature, all this marvellous miracle of genius and of
daring enterprise has been effected under God by the British
people; in such contemplation, are we not right to pride our-
selves that we belong to a nation rich in such achievements, and
though IG,OOO miles of water roll between the child and parent, it
has not quenched the love for Home. For be it known that
when the stricken wives and children of our Indian warriors
needed help, and the heroes of Alma and of Inkerman besought
our aid; when grim want appealed from Lancashire, when
cotton failed, and hunger invaded the homes of British
workmen, the response was £loo,ooo*, an offering from
New South Wales alone. The question will very naturally be
asked, “How shall I be likely to succeed?” You imagine,
perhaps, that you are going among strangers, and that a cold
reception awaits you. Cheer up, my friends, for I can assure
you that you will have no occasion to grumble at the weather
nor the hearts of the people; a more hospitable race than the
residents of New South Wales does not exist in this wide world
of ours. You are not about to land among a race of unculti-
vated money-grubbers, who have renounced all the courtesies
of civilized life ; you will find a hearty welcome, and a scrupu-
lous regard and consideration for the wants of those who desire
to cast in their lot with the dwellers of the Sunny South.
There are things you will not easily find, and these are syco-
phancy and flunkeyism. If you do go and try to cut it fine, and
turn up your nose at meat at 2d. per pound, and talk about
your “ illigant cousins,” and the grand society you have kept at
home, they may say you ought to have stopped there, for the
Australian eye is quick at detecting the “ Horatio Sparkins ” in
modern society; some may even go so far as to call you a

humbug ; but if you go there with a determination to do what
is right, and to make the best of everything, you will find as
your reward a well-merited success.
Titles, in Australia, are not the only passports to position.
What is a man worth to the country ? Australia wants strong
hands and clear brains. Don’t build castles in the air; before
you put on the top-stone you must delve in the foundation.
Don’t set your mind on doing this, or getting that. Nor
grumble, and be disheartened, if every anticipation of your
sanguine mind is not realised to the full. Remember that
the percentage of educated persons is much larger than
in England, for the child of the Australian mechanic has
better educational advantages than his brother at home.
Don’t think you are going to astonish the natives, or else, per-
haps, the only person astonished will be yourself. Take that
which first offers, and then look out for what will suit you
better. Don’t expect a large salary at first; if you do, most
likely you won’t get it; they will give you what you are worth,
and not a cent more. Above all, if you have religion, take
it with you, and if you have not got it, be persuaded, and
seek it —it will never be a drawback.
Be determined at all costs to maintain a Christian character,
and then your entrance to the colony will be a blessing and
not a curse. And now, my friends, I have done. To me it
has been a pleasing task. I have spent the best years of my life
in that land —I have a goodly heritage within its borders. I
w r ent there a stranger nearly a quarter of a century ago, and
“the lines have fallen unto me in pleasant places.” I know
that within its shores there are a generous, free, and hospitable
people. I have seen many come out there from the old land
with nothing, and have soon seen them surrounded with all
that can tend to make men happy and contented in this world.
And yet there is room for millions more. Untilled soil, only
waiting for the yeoman’s labour ; room for enterprise and skill;
room for thousands of strong hands and hopeful hearts; room
among a people whose social life is like your own ; for you will


feel, if you come, that you are not like a stranger in a strange
land.
Australia sends an invitation to willing toilers, and she
promises a hearty welcome; beneath her bright blue sky you
can win the rich fruit of honest independence, and you will
feel as you gaze upon that flag which floats upon the breeze
beneath yon southern cross —that flag the emblem of the free—
that although you have left England that you are not less the
freeman of England still, and that your entrance to Australia
has not weakened the bond which unites you to a country
which stands first among the nations of the world in the great
and blessed work of peaceful colonization; a country rich in
the association of historic memories—a country which, thank
God, bears no mark of decay; a country which has been
privileged by Heaven to people the waste places of the earth !
Hail! fair Australia, jewel of the sea!
How few the spots that can compare with thee!
Broad plains invite the crowded hordes of earth;
Language but fails to tell thy matchless worth.
Land oft reviled—when most it should be praised—
By those whom thou’st from degradation raised.
Thy sky so bright, it has a glorious hue,
And hearts beneath so brave, and yet so true.
Within thy harbour, Austral’s joyous pride,
The largest navies in the world may ride ;
A sweet Elysium, full of fond delights,
Ne’er dreamed of in the famed “ Arabian Nights.”
Thy genial clime iraparteth looked-for health,
Thy mines of gold receptacles of wealth,
Thy unfilled lands invite the yeoman’s power,
Which will repay him with a wealthy dower.
Let none approach thy shores who scorn to work
Thou wantest not the hands that labour shirk.
The tattered sons of poverty are welcome there,
Thou wilt enrich them without any fear;
The aristocracy of worth is what thou’lt hail,
Such men succeed, such men can never fail.


The ill-fed thousands on our country’s shore
Will find within thee good and ample store.
What flowers can boast such rich and lovely dye
As bloom beneath Australia’s peerless sky ?
What birds of plumage rare, and form sublime,
Are found within this beauteous southern clime!
Beneath thy rich and ever fertile soil
Are mines of wealth to recompense your toil.
No gold so bright in all the lands of earth,
None can compare for its intrinsic worth,
I've roamed amid the grandeur of the West,
But, oh ! to me Australia’s far the best.
Her stars are brighter than all stars beside ;
The Southern Cross, our famed Australia’s pride;
The Northern Bear has held his empire long,
But w 7 ho has ever told his worth in song ?
Upon the escutcheon of our fair blue sky
Is that bright meteor wrought in gold on high,
Which ever speaks of mercy and of love,
And points the way to brighter worlds above.
Long live Australia, England’s fairest gem !
She graces well that grand and sturdy stem.
Long may her people venerate their sire
With hearts aglow with true and loyal fire!
And may their union last till time is o’er,
And earth be occupied by man no more !
