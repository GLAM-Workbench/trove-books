THE MUNITIONS COTTON LEAGUE,
MOUNT MORGAN.
Chairman : The Mayor of Mount Morgan.
Treasurer : K. D. Armstrong.
Secretary : G. Stephen Hart.
After publication of the article. ?No
Cotton, No Shells,? in the ? Morning Bul-
letin ? and ? Daily Record ? (Rockhampton),
and the ?Mount Morgan Argus,? a public
meeting was convened by the Mayor of
Mount Morgan, Alderman Louis Halber-
stater. at the Technical College on Septem-
ber 11th. At this meeting the following
motion, moved by Mr. E. Noel Goode,
metallurgist of the M.M.G.M. Co., and
seconded by Mr. Frank Griffiths, assistant
metallurgist, was carried unanimously :
? That a committee be formed of those
present, with power to add to their num-
bers, with his Worship the Mayor as
chairman, and Mr. Hart as secretary, to
get cotton grown throughout Queensland
for purposes of defence, and that a public
meeting be called in Mount Morgan, when
they get word that seed is available, to get
seed planted by each resident of the dis-
trict.?
The following were appointed an adver-
tising sub-committee :?Messrs. K. D Arm-
strong, E. J. Williams. R. P. Williams, C.
Briggs, W. P. Henwood, and the chairman
and secretary.
The public meeting was held on the 23rd
September at the School of Arts, at which
addresses were delivered by five speakers,
who came from Brisbane: for this purpose,
the first two speakers having been selected
and sent to us by the Publicity Committee
of the University of Brisbane.
Mr. Daniel Jones, cotton expert, outlined
the history of cotton growing in Queensland,
and stated that on Queensland scrub soils
cotton could be produced more cheaply than
anywhere else in the world. It was a simple
crop to grow 7 , and there was unlimited land
suitable, A grower could expect 1000 lbs of
seed cotton per acre. He hoped cotton cul-
ture would be taken up throughout the dis-
trict.
Mr. L. C. Bagster, B.Sc., explained the
use of cotton made from explosives was to
drive the shells from the guns. To explode
the shells coal tar products were used, but
Australia?s present coal tar output could
provide sufficient for a million shells per
annum. Nitric acid, at present made from
imported nitre, was also required. He out-
lined a method of making nitric acid from
nitrogen in the air, which could be carried
out if we ignored patent rights. There would
i>e no shortage of cotten for this war so long
as we could obtain America?s supply.
Mr. H. L. Hartley, M L A., apologised for
the absence of the Minister for Railways
{Hon. John Adamson), who had hoped to
attend as a member of the Munitions Exe-
cutive Committee. Mr, Hartley gave a
rousing patriotic address, and eulogised the
gentlemen who had initiated the movement.
Mr. James Stopford, M L.A., said no one
could watch the wounded men returning
from the war without registering a vow to
do something else to help if they could not
go to the front themselves. Even it their
cotton was not needed in this war, they
would feel that they had it if it was needed.
They could also demonstrate whet her cotton
could be grown commercially in this district.
He congratulated their secretary, Mr. Hart,
on his efforts The Premier and the Minister
for Agriculture wished him to inform the
meeting that their sympathies were with the
movement, and they would do all they could
to assist it. He had also to announce that
the Government had increased their guaran-
tee to Ifd per lb for seed cotton.
Captain Richards, who was received with
great applause, expressed pleasure at seeing
so many oid faces once more. Cotton ap-
pealed to him more from the industrial than
the munitions point of view. Mining towns
needed a second industry to fall back upon.
Bendigo, Ballarat, and Gym pie were absorb-
ing their growing population in farming
pursuits. And besides making munitions
they must look ahead and build up and foster
Australian industries.
The meeting carried the following motion,
proposed by Mr. Stephen Hart and seconded
by Mr. Colville Christie :
? That a Munitions Cotton League be
now formed, to press forward the production
of cotton in Australia, so that it may be
available for the manufacture of munitions,
and that all those present on handing in
their names, accompanied by one shilling,
be members of the League, with power to
add ; and that the committee which
arranged this meeting be the committee of
the League with such others as they may
add.?
The vote of thanks to the speakers was
moved by the Mayor of Mount Morgan
(Alderman L, Halberstater), and seconded
by the Chairman of the Calliungal Shire
(Mr. Syd, Gray).
Amongst the many prominent citizens
present in an audience of about 400 were
Messrs. A. A. Boyd (general manager Mount
Morgan Gold Mining Co., Ltd.). L. A. West-
cot t (underground manager), Morgan Johns
(constructional engineer), C, F. Smith

H. Maynard, E. Hillman, and G. L. Sherriffs
of Mount Morgan, and Messrs. Harvey
Warde and R. G. Brown of Rockhampton.
The Rockhampton dailies sent special report-
ers. The large hall would have been com-
pletely packed but for an important special
meeting of the A.W.U, suddenly 7 called for
the same time, which Kept away many warm
supporters.
After the meeting over a hundred mern-
beis of the League were enrolled, and circu-
lars were sent to Members of Parliament,
Municipal Councils, Agricultural Societies,
Farmers* and Progress Associations, and
Head Teachers of State Schools, which
brought in cordial replies from the Municipal

The ? Morning Bulletin,? Rockhampton,
at once started a competition amongst their
local school children, whilst the ?Daily
' Record ? helped with leading articles, para-
graphs, and cartoons. The Agricultural
Society (Rockhampton) are awarding very
generous prizes, further added to by the
Rockhampton Council, for cotton growers in
connection with their next Show,
The Queensland Country Press arranged
for the publication of the ?No Cotton, No
Shells ? article throughout Queensland.
The Agricultural Department also pub-
lished the article in their Monthly Journal,
and undertook to deliver free seed to any
intending grower at his nearest railway
station.
The farmers have loyally taken up the
matter of growing cotton, the largest plant-
ers known to us being W. P. Henw'ood,
Sranweli, 40 acres, and the members of the
Woodend Farmers' Club, 20 acres. The de-
mand for seed has now compelled the
Agricultural Department to limit each indi-
vidual grower to sufficient to plant two
acres.
Circulars were sent to 50 gentlemen, who
had already grown cotton, to get reliable
information from farmers themselves for the
benefit of other farmers. Seventeen replies
are to hand, four being from growers who
only grew small lots for Show purposes. Of
the others, nine recommend farmers in their
districts to grow it for profit, and four re-
commend them not to. The first eight
replies may be quoted as typical :
Mr. C. Litzow, of Yernor, on the Esk line,
grew 2 acres and spent �4 per acre on
ploughing twice 8 in. deep, and cultivating
well. His crop yielded 1.503 lbs. per acre.
A lad of 16 picked 120 lbs. per day for
per lb. He planted 5x3 feet apart, fresh
each year, and is planting again this year.
Mr. J. Coombes, of Caoella. put in 7 acres
of ploughed and harrowed ground fora yield
of 807 lbs. per acre, but found 100 lbs. per
day was the picker?s tally. He planted in
drills 3 ft. 6 in. apart, thinned to 15 in. be-
tween the plants, and kept down weeds with
a horse hoe. The crop w?as treated as a
perennial.
Mr. J. Larsen, also of Capelia, sowed ia
drills on ploughed land, and spent 30s. per
acre to keep the crop clean. His yield aver-
aged 720 lbs. per acre, over an area of 15
acres, and he planted over 200 lbs. a day.
The bushes were cut off each year 2 in, above
the ground, and were planted fresh after
three years. He recommends thick seeding,
as all the seeds do not germinate.
Mr. John Sanderson, of Stan well, averaged
672 lbs. per acre, over 25 acres, from bushes
5 ft. apart, and treated as perennials. Up
to 300 lbs. was picked in a day, and as pick-
ers got a shilling for 15 lbs. they did ex-
tremely well. Other cultivation costs were
�3 per acre. Mr. Sanderson has grown
almost every variety and will answer any
inquiries from intending growers.
Mr. A. Miller, of Raglan, has 7 acres, and
is planting three more on newly-burnt-bff
scrub land. His yield last year was small,
but cows were fed on the cotton bushes for
two months. He recommends farmers to
grow it as a profitable crop and a useful
standby. He plants 4 ft. by 2 ft., and keej s
down the undergrowth between the plants.
At Raglan 200 lbs. ppr day was picked.
Mr, P. Mosby, of Wovvan, plants 2 ft.
apart, with 5 ft. to 6 ft. between the rows,
and recommends the constant use of a hoe
or cultivator until the plants are well deve-
loped. He icommends planting sweet
potatoes or maize between the rows to keep
any caterpillars away from the cotton and
also points out the advantage of growing a
crop for which the price is not fixed by the
local storekeepers. Mr. Mosby has about 2
acres now. but may add another 5 acr-s if
the weather permits. Amount picked per
day, up to 2 cwt.
The two remaining growers found the crop
unpayable, but one advocates no cultivation
and the other put the total cost of the crop
at 13s. per acre. Low yields resulted, which
miant small tallies for the pickers, and up
to per lb. is given as a fair price for
picking such crops as theirs. Their crops
are however, both available for patriotic pur-
poses, and one generously offers to pay the
wages of the men who pick it, and then
donate the crop. October to December are
given as the best months for planting, but
Mr. Sanderson recommends planting in Feb-
ruary. All the growers prefer Uplands
cotton to Sea Island.
Professor Orme Masson. F.R.S., of the
Melbourne University, who is second to no
scientist in Australia, has said Germany has
stated that the declaration of cotton as con-
traband has not affected her. first because
she has ample supplies, and second because
she does not require it?two contradictory
statements by which she probably hoped to
hide the fact that it is far more serious than
most people realise.
To us it seems that at present the safety
of the Empire is largely dependent upon the
cotton growers of America, who, in times of
peace, have exported over forty-one million
pounds worth of cotton to Great Britain iry
a single year.
Oar present efforts to establish the cotton
industry in Australia seem only limited by
the funds available for propaganda work.
What are YOU going to do about it ?
Are YOU going to contribute to our funds T
Are YOU going to get cotton growing
tested in YOUR district, or tell us of some-
one else who will ?.
