PREFACE.
One of the changes recently made in the mathematical
work of the schools in England and Australia is the intro-
duction of simple numerical trigonometry of the right-
angled triangle quite early in the course.
It is true that this numerical trigonometry can be learnt
in conjunction with geometry, and that no special textbook
is necessary. And the teaching of the different parts of
school mathematics is no longer carried out, so to speak,
in separate compartments. But the subject is of such im-
portance and interest that it seems to deserve some more
careful treatment.
In this little book only the Sine, Cosine, and Tangent
of an acute angle are used. A separate chapter and many
examples are devoted to each. The importance of graph-
ical solutions by means of squared paper is not forgotten.
In most of the worked examples in the text figures drawn
to scale, and with the scale clearly indicated, are given.
A final chapter deals with some applications of these
ratios, chiefly in field work. A feature of this chapter is
the attention given to simple experimental work.
Those who proceed to a fuller study of trigonometry in the
higher forms of the school, will find that much of the
arithmetical work in these pages is unnecessary when log-
arithmic calculation is available. From pupils at this early


stage of their course a knowledge of logarithms is not ex-
pected, and the examples throughout the book are supposed
to be worked without their aid.
. Tables of Natural Sines, Cosines and Tangents have
been inserted and they are used throughout the book.
I have purposely refrained from carrying the work
past the simplest trigonometry of the right-angled triangle.
In my opinion those who devote more time to the subject
should do so later in their course and on more general lines.
Perhaps I should add that it is far from the view of the
author that all the work given in these pages should be
covered in such an introductory course as is referred to in
the first sentence of the preface.
In the preparation of this book and in the correction of
the proofs I have received much help from Mr. R. J.
Middleton and Mr. H. J. Meldrum, Lecturers in Mathematics
at the Teachers’ College, Sydney. To them both I desire to
express my hearty thanks.

CHAPTER I.
INTRODUCTORY.
§ 1. Trigonometry, as its name implies, has to do with the
measurement of triangles. In this little book we shall deal
only with right-angled triangles.
The sides and angles of a triangle are called its elements
or parts. The angles of the triangle ABC are denoted by A,
B and C; the sides opposite these angles by a, b and c.
Fig. 1.
If we are given a sufficient number of the elements of a
triangle, we can determine the remainder with the aid of what
are called the Trigonometrical Ratios. What these are, and
how they are to be used, will be explained in the following
chapters.
The Measurement of Angles.
§ “• Angles are usually measured in degrees, minutes and
seconds.


A degree is the 90th part of a right-angle.
A minute is the 60th part of a degree.
A second is the 60th part of a minute.
Thus—6o seconds (60") =1 minute (I'),
60 minutes (60' ) =1 degree (1°),
90 degrees (90°) =1 right-angle.
The terms minutes and seconds are derived from the Latin
words partes minutae primae and partes minutae secundae,
originally applied to these quantities.
§ 3.—Directions are conveniently given by reference to
the points of the compass. The circle on which the com-
pass needle moves is divided into 32 equal parts, each part
being thus the eighth of a right-angle, or 11° 15 . fhe names
of these points of division are given in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2.
The points are named with reference to the cardinal points,
N., S., E., and W.
Directions may also be indicated by saying that the position
in question bears so many degrees East of North, or TV est of


Fig. 3.
South, etc. Thus when it is said that a place B lies N. 15° E.
of a place A, it is meant that the angle between AB and
the line due N. is 15° and lies towards the East (Fig. 3).
In this notation N.N.E. would be written N. 22° 30' E.,
or E. 67° 30' N.
§ 4.—The meridians are semicircles on the surface of the
earth, the poles being the ends of their diameters. Places on
the same meridian have the same longitude.
A ship sailing due N. or S. is moving along a meridian.
Again, points which have the same latitude lie on circles;
the planes of these circles are perpendicular to the line join-
ing the poles. The equator is the circle, or parallel, of lati-
tude zero. As we go 90° to the N. and S. of the equator
these circles get smaller and smaller, till at the poles, whose
latitudes are 90° N. and 90° S., they vanish.
The position of a ship is marked by its latitude and
longitude. The sailor uses a nautical mile, different from an
ordinary or statute mile of 1760 yds., so that he can more
easily obtain his new position from the distance run and the
direction of the course.* Theoretically the nautical mile is the
* The position of a ship is, of course, determined very exactly by observation
of the sun, moon and stars. But this can only be done in clear weather. The log
and the compass are used for what the sailor calls his “ dead reckoning.”


distance along a meridian corresponding to a change of V in
latitude.
Taking the earth as a sphere of radius 3960 miles, the
length of a meridian from pole to pole is
7 r X 3960 miles.
„ , n 3960 .
Therefore the are for 1 tt X mi * es 7
= 22 7r miles,
484 .. . 22
= -~y~ miles, taking tt = —,
= 691 miles.
5280
And the arc for 1 k ~ ft-
-60
= 6085 ft. nearly.
As the earth is not a true sphere, the nautical mile, as thus*
defined, would vary, being greater near the poles than near
the equator. It has, therefore, been found convenient to
assign a standard value for nautical use, namely 6080 ft.
It will be seen that 60 nautical miles are roughly equal to
69 ordinary miles, and that a speed of 30 nautical miles per
hour (what a sailor would call 30 knots) is roughly equal to
a speed of 34J ordinary miles per hour. A knot is not a
nautical mile; it is a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour. The
connection of the name with the knots on the old form of
log-line is familiar.
If a sailor knows that on a certain run he has made 10
nautical miles North or South, then he can say that he has
changed his latitude by 10'. If he has made 60 nautical miles
North or South, then he has changed his latitude by I°.
The question of the difference in longitude produced by a
journey of a certain number of miles East or West is not so
simple.


In the metric system the fundamental unit, the metre, is
intended to represent one ten-millionth of the arc of a
meridian from the equator to a pole.
If one place is 1 kilometre North or South of another, the
9
difference in their latitude is degrees or 0-54 minutes.

OM OP' OP
would be the same for the different points.
Whatever acute angle we take, we should get a similar
•result; these ratios should be independent of the position of
Cthe point P upon the arm of the angle.
f The work could be divided among the members of the class.
•Each could be told to draw with his protractor an angle AOR of
;a definite size—say, 25°; then to take a point P upon the arm
lOR and draw PM perpendicular to the arm OA. Different dis-
tances should be assigned to each pupil for the point P.
If the work is carefully done, the ratios should be very nearly
the same for each drawing.
§6. —The three ratios we have named, and their reciprocals,
are.called the Trigonometrical Ratios of the angle.
MP
The ratio is called the sine of the angle.
The ratio is called the cosine of the angle.
MP
The ratio , is called the tangent of the angle.
OM
r OM
The ratio is called the cotangent of the angle.
OP .
The ratio is called the secant of the angle.

The ratio is called the cosecant of the angle.
MP
The reasons for these names will be referred to later. The
first three ratios are the most important. The others are
simply their reciprocals. It is only with the sine, cosine,
and tangent that we shall be concerned in this course.
B


§ 7.—We have not yet proved that these ratios are
independent of the position of the point P upon the arm of
the angle. The drawing and measurement carried out, as
suggested in § 5, can make it seem extremely likely that this
is so. But we cannot be quite sure that this is the case, if
we rely only upon such work. When we measure the length
of a line, we are only getting an approximate result. The
closeness of the approximation depends upon the instrument
used. But in every case the result is to be regarded as true
only within the limits cf experimental error. And, of course,
we cannot take every point on the line, nor every angle.
In Trigonometry, as in Geometry, this experimental method
does not give a proof.
In the next section this fundamental, theorem, that these
ratios are independent of the position of the point P upon
the arm of the angle, is proved.
§ B.—Let P and P' be any two points upon the arm OR of
the angle AOB (Pig. 5).
Fig. 5.
Let us assume* that OP and OP' have a common measure
OQ, so that OP = m X OQ and OP' =m ' X OQ, m and
m' being two positive integers.
* This assumption follows the now generally recognised principle that an
ordinary school course should not he required to include incommensurahles ; in
other words, that in such a course all magnitudes of the same kind should be
treated as commensurable. — \_Cf. Report on the Teaching of Geometry (The Mathe-
matical Association) , § 48.]


Let OB be perpendicular to OA.
Draw the perpendiculars PM, P'M' and QH to OA, and
PN, P'N' and QK to 08.
Then QH, PM and P'M' are parallel, and QK, PN and
P'N' are parallel.
Also OK = HQ, ON = MP and ON' = M'P'.
But we are given that OP = m X OQ, so that OP is made
up of m parts each equal to OQ.
Therefore OM is made up of m parts each equal to OH and
OM = m X OIL*
Similarly ON = m X OK, OM' = m X OH, and
ON' = m' X OK.

Therefore no matter where the point P is taken upon OR,

OM
Also the reciprocals of these ratios are independent of the
position of the point P on OR.
Thus the six trigonometrical ratios of an acute angle are
definite positive numbers associated with the angle.
* This follows from the theorem enunciated below —given in all modern
elementary textbooks of Geometry :
“ If there are three or more parallel straight lines, and the intercepts made by
them on any straight line that outs them are equal, then the corresponding inter-
cepts on any other straight line that cuts them are also equal.”


§ 9.—ln the preceding section it has been convenient
to take the point P upon the bounding line OR. We would
obtain the same values for the ratios, if P were taken on
the initial line OA and the perpendicular PM drawn to the
arm OR.
Fig. 6.
For, if P is taken upon OA, cut off OP' from OR so that
OP' = OP (Fig. 6), and draw P'M' perpendicular to OA.
Then the triangles MOP and M'OP' are congruent.
Therefore the corresponding ratios are equal.
§ 10.—Denote the angle AOR by the symbol 6. Instead
of writing sine AOR, cosine AOR, tangent AOR, we write
sin 6 , cos 9 , and tan 0.
Fig. 7.
Fig. 8.
Also MP is the side opposite the angle 0 in the triangle
MOP, both in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8; OM is the side adjacent to
9, and OP is the Jiypothenuse.


The definitions of the ratios can
therefore be stated afresh, for an
acute angle in a right-angled
triangle :
. opposite side
hypothenuse
„ adjacent side
cos 0 . j
hypothenuse
opposite side
adjacent side
Fig. 9.
This is a very useful form in which to remember these
ratios. We have shown that, they are definite positive
numbers associated with the angle.
It follows at once from the definitions of the sine and
cosine of an acute angle that—
-0 •< sin 6 1,
O<C cos 6 1,
and sin 12 6 cos 2 6= 1.
§ 11.—In the right-angled triangle ABC, let C be the
right-angle (Fig. 10).
Then we have
• a a
sin A =-,
c
and cos A = —.
c
It follows that
a = c sin A,
and h = c cos A.
Fig. 10.
Thus the sine of an acute angle in a right-angled triangle
is the factor by which the hypothenuse must be multiplied to
give the side opposite to this angle; the cosine is the factor
for calculating the side adjacent to this angle.


EXAMPLES 11.
1. If a, b are the two sides of a right-angled triangle, and c
is the hypothennse, draw triangles, to a suitable scale, in which
(i.) a = 3 ft., 6 = 4 ft., c = 5 ft.
(ii.) a = 12 ft., b = 5 ft., c = 13 ft.
Also write down the values of sin A, cos A, tan A, and of
sin B, cos B, tan B, in these triangles.
2. ABC is a right-angled triangle, C being the right-angle.
The sides a and b are equal. What is the size of the angle A
and what are the values of sin A, cos A, and tan A?
3. ABC is an equilateral triangle, the sides being 2 in.

the triangle ABB are 30°, 60° and 90°. Also find the values
of sin 30°, cos 30°, tan 30°, and sin 60°, cos 60°, tan 60°.
4. ABCD is a rectangle in which the side AB is double the

and obtain corresponding results for BE and CF. What
follows from these results'?


CHAPTER III.
THE SINE OF AN ACUTE ANGLE.
§ 12.—We have seen that the ratio
MP opposite side ......
or —— (Fig 1 . 11)
0 P hypothenuse v
is called the sine* of the angle AOR.
Also we have shown
that this fraction has
the same value, no mat-
ter where P is taken
upon either arm of the
angle.
In the next sections
it will be convenient-to
take P at unit distance
from 0 on the arm
OR.t
Fig. 11.
g 13_We shall now examine how the sine changes as the
angle increases from 0° to 90°.
Take a quadrant of a circle of unit radius bounded by the
radii OA and OB (Fig. 12).
* The word used by the Arabs for the line MP (Of. Pig. 12) was literally
translated into Latin in the 12th century hy the word sinus (bosom, or gulf). At
that time, and till a much later date, the sine, cosine, etc., ref erred to lines in a
circle, the radius of which had to be stated. The sine of the angle AOP (or more
correctly the sine of the arc AP) was the line MP, and the cosine the line OM or
the line NP.
t The length taken as unit is, of course, at our disposal. In Fig. 12 the length
of OA is 2 inches, so that the unit of length on this scale is 2 inches. The figure
would have been too small for our purpose if 1 inch had been chosen as the unit.
Similarly, 10 cm., or 1 dm., would be a convenient unit on squared paper ruled in
millimetres.


Let AOP be an angle 0 in this quadrant.
Let PM and PN be the perpendiculars from P to OA and
08.
. „ MP
Then sin 6 = p
MP, since OP is unity,
= ON.
Thus the number which gives the length of ON in the scale
on which OP is unity will be equal to sin 6.
Fig. 12.
As the angle increases from 0° to 90°, the point N con-
tinually moves out along 08.
It follows that as the angle increases, the sine increases.
And, as we have already seen, the sine is never greater
than 1.

§ 14. —If we have a very small angle, the point N will be
very near the point 0 ( Cf. Fig. 12).
When OP moves still nearer to OA, the point N moves still
nearer to the point 0, and when OP ultimately coincides with
OA, the point N coincides with the point 0.
Thus the length of ON becomes zero, when 6 becomes o°.
Therefore we say that sin 0° = 0.
Again when the angle is very nearly a right-angle, the point
N will be very near the point B, the end of the radius.
When OP moves still nearer to 08, the point N moves still
nearer to the point B, and when OP ultimately coincides
with 08, the point N coincides with the point B.
Thus the length of ON becomes unity, when 0 becomes 90°.
Therefore we say that sin 90° = 1.
§ 15. —As 0 increases from 0° to 90°, sin 6 continually
increases from 0 to 1.
Every angle between 0° and 90° has its own sine, a positive
proper fraction, which belongs to it and to no other acute
angle.
And we shall see below that, if we are given the sine, we
can identify the acute angle to which it belongs.
Approximate Sines Shown Graphically.
§ 16. —From Fig. 13 we can read off approximately the
sine of any angle from nearly 0° to nearly 90°.
The pupil should draw this figure for himself to a suitable
scale on squared paper. He should then construct a Table
of Sines:


Fig. 13.
Approximate Determination of Sines from
a Geometrical Construction.
§ 17.—When an angle is given, the value of its sine can be
determined approximately, as in the preceding section, by the
aid of a circle of unit radius.
But it is not necessary to take OP of length unity. All that
we have to do is to mark off any convenient length OP upon
one arm of the angle. Then we draw the perpendicular PM
MP
to the other arm, measure MP, and calculate the ratio
To find sin 25° by this method:
With the protractor draw the angle AOR (Fig. 14) equal
to 25°.
Mark off OP = 5 cm.


Fig. 14.
Draw the perpendicular PM.
On measuring MP we find that it is, as nearly as we can
tell, 2-1 cm.
Hence sin 25° = 0-42 approximately.
Geometrical Construction for the Acute Angle
whose Sine is a Given Positive Proper Fraction.
§ 18.—We have seen that as 6 increases from 0° to 90°,
the point N (Fig. 12) continually moves out from 0 to B.
Thus ON takes all the values between 0 and 1 as 6 passes
from 0° to 90°.
It follows that to construct the acute angle whose sine is
a given positive proper fraction, we have only to determine
the point N which corresponds to this fraction.
When N is known, the angle AOP follows immediately.
But it is not necessary to use the circle of unit radius. All
that we have to do is to construct a right-angled triangle in
which the length of one side is given by the numerator of the
given fraction, and the length of the hypothenuse is given by
the denominator.
The angle opposite the side referred to is the required
angle.

The Table of Sines.
§ 19.—1 t is possible to calculate the values of the Trigo-
nometrical Ratios of an angle to any required degree of
accuracy. The way in which this has been done need not be
known by the beginner. The results are given in the Trigo-
nometrical Tables under the headings Natural Sines, Natural
Cosines, Natural Tangents, etc.
The word “Natural” is added to distinguish these Tables
from others which contain the logarithms of the sines, cosines,
tangents, etc., sometimes with 10 added to each logarithm.
The Tables at the end of this book are Four-Figure Tables.
The results are given to four decimal places. If greater
accuracy is required, others are available, calculated to a
larger number of places.
The Table of Sines will now be used in the following
problems:
(a) To find the sine, when the acute angle is given.
( Cf . §§ 20-21).
(b) To find the acute angle, when the sine is given,
(Cf. §§ 22-23).

To find the sine, when the angle is given.
8 20.—1 n the Table we have the following figures:—


Supposing we wish to find sin 19° 14'—
Thus we have sin 19° 18' = -3305
sin 19° 12' = -3289.
And we know that sin 19° 14' lies between these two numbers.
We look along to the column at the right-hand of the page.
This gives the amount to be added for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes.
(As the angle increases from 0° to 90°, the sine continually
increases).
tu i • mo (-3289
thus we have sin 19° 14 | .QOO5
= -3294.
Worked Examples.
§ 21. —Example I.—A road is inclined at 10° to the
horizontal. How many yards does a man rise vertically for
every 100 yds’, progress straight up the road? (Fig. 15.)
Fig. 15. Scale, 50 yds. = 1 in.
Let the vertical ascent be x yds. in 100 yds.
Then we have x = 100 sin 10°
= 17-36.
Therefore the vertical ascent in 100 yds. is 17 yds. to the
nearest yard.


Example 2.—ln a rectangle the diagonal is 24 ft. and it
makes an angle of 22° with the longer side. Find the lengths
of the sides. (Fig. 16.)
Fig. 16. Scale, 10 ft. = 1 in.
Since the diagonal makes an angle of 22° with one side, it
makes 68° with the other.
Let the lengths of the longer and shorter sides be x ft. and
y ft.
Then we have x = 24 sin 68°
= 24 X -9272
= 22-2528.
And y r— 24 sin 22°
= 24 X -3746
= 8-9904.
Thus the sides are 9 ft. and 22 ft. 3 in. to the nearest inch.


Example 3. —A ship’s course is N. 26° E. The distance run
is 18 miles. How far does she go East on this run? (Fig.
17.)
Fig. 17.
Scale, 10 miles = 1 in.
Let the distance travelled to the East be x miles.
Then we have x = 18 sin 26°
= 18 X -4384
= 7-89 • • •
Therefore this distance = 7-9 miles to the nearest tenth
of a mile.


EXAMPLES IV.
1. Write down the approximate values (using Four-Figure
tables) of—
(a) sin 18° 10', sin 28° 10', sin 38° 10'.

What are the actual values of sin 45° and sin 60° ?
2. If A = 35° and B = 30°, find sin (A + B) and

sin A + sin B.)

The Table of Sines ( continued ).
To find the angle when the sine is given.
§ 22.—For example, if sin 0 = ‘3305, what is the value of 6 ?
Here we have at once from the Tables ( Cf • § 20)
e = 19° is'.
But suppose we had been given the problem
If sin 6 = -3333, what is the value of 6 P
The Table of Sines tells us that
sin 19° 30' -3338
sin 19° 24' = -3322.


Thus 0 lies between 19° 24' and 19° 30'.
The difference between -3333 and -3322 is -0011.
We look along to the column at the right-hand of the page,
and find that this difference corresponds to 4' added to 19° 24'.
Thus 6 = 19° 28'.
We work out another example in fewer words:
If sin 0 = -3379, what is the value of 9 ?
We have sin 19° 42' = -3371.
Difference = 8 (corresponds to an increase
Therefore 6 = 19° 45'. 3 ).
It is convenient always to work from the figures in the Table
next helow the given ratio. If the “difference” lies between two
of the numbers in the column on the right-hand of the page, we
agree to take that to which it is the nearer. If it is half-way
between two, we'take the larger.
The right-hand column on these pages is really obtained from a
Simple Proportion sum. The differences in the ratios (in this
case the sines) are taken as proportional to the differences in
the angles, these differences being small compared to the angles.
This assumption can be justified, but its truth must be taken for
granted now.
Worked Examples.

vertical wall. If it touches the wall 20 ft. from the foot of

Let the inclination to the horizontal be i .
Then sin f) = $ = -6667.
But sin 41° 48' = -6665.
Difference = 2 (corresponds to an in-
crease of I').
Therefore 6 = 41° 49'.

Therefore B = 48° 35'.

CHAPTER IV.
THE COSINE OF AN ACUTE ANGLE.
§ 24.—We have seen that the ratio
OM adiacent side
or (Pig. 20)
0 P hypothenuse v
is called the cosine of the angle A OR.
Fig. 20.
Also we have shown that this fraction has the same value
no matter where P is taken upon either arm of the angle.
In the next sections it is convenient to take P at unit dis-
tance from 0 on the arm OR.
The word cosine is derived from the Latin words com-
plementi sinus, which were contracted into co. sin., and finally
into cos.
The reason for the name will be clear if we remember that
when two angles make up 90°, the one is said to be the com-
plement of the other.
But from Pig. 20 we have —
cos MOP = sin OPM.
Denoting the angle MOP by 6 , this may be written
cos 0 = sin (90° —6).


_ 1 i ; 141 ■ .
In other words—
cos 9 sine of the complement of 9.
The prefix co- in the names cotangent and cosecant is
accounted for in the same way.
§ 25. —We shall now examine how the cosine changes as
the angle increases from 0° to 00°.
Take a quadrant of a circle of unit radius bounded by the
radii OA and OB (Fig. 21).
Let AOP be an angle 9 in this quadrant.
Fig. 21.
Let PM be the perpendicular from P to OA.
mi „ OM
iben cos 9
= OM, since OP is unity.


Thus the number which gives the length of OM in the scale
on which OP is unity will be equal to cos 0.
As the angle increases from 0° to 90°, the point M continu-
ally moves in along OA.
It follows that as the angle increases, the cosine decreases.
And, as we have already seen, the cosine is never greater
than 1.
§ 26. —lf we have a very small angle, the point M will be
very near the point A, the end of the radius ( Cf. Fig. 21).
When OP moves still nearer to OA, the point M moves still
nearer to the point A; and when OP ultimately coincides
with OA, the point M coincides with the point A.
Thus the length of OM becomes unity, when 0 becomes o°.
Therefore we say that cos 0° == 1.
Again when the angle is very nearly a right-angle, the point
M will be very near the point 0.
When OP moves still nearer to 08, the point M moves still
nearer to the point O; and when OP ultimately coincides
with 08, the point M coincides with the point O.
Thus the length of OM becomes zero, when 6 becomes 90°,
Therefore we say that cos 90° 0.
§ 27. —As 6 increases from 0° to 90°, cos $ continually
decreases from 1 to 0.
Therefore every angle between 0° and 90° has its own
cosine, a positive proper fraction, which belongs to it and to
no other acute angle.
And we shall see below that if we are given the cosine we
can identify the acute angle to which it belongs, just as, if we
are given the sine, we can identify the acute angle to which
- belongs.

cosine of any angle from nearly 0° to nearly 90°.

Approximate Determination of Cosines from a
Geometrical Construction.
§ 29. —When an angle is given, the value of its cosine can
be determined approximately, as in the preceding section, by
the aid of a circle of unit radius.


But it is not necessary to take OP of length unity. All
that we have to do is to mark off any convenient length OP
upon one arm of the angle. Then we draw the perpendicular
PM to the other arm, measure OM and calculate the
. OM
ratlo OP'
To find cos 25° by this method:
With the protractor draw the angle AOR (Pig. 23) equal
to 25°.
Fig. 23.
Mark off OP = 5 cm.
Draw the perpendicular PM.
On measuring OM, we find that it is, as nearly as we can
tell, 4-5 cm
Thus cos 25° = 0-9 approximately.


Geometrical Construction for the Acute Angle
whose Cosine is a Positive Proper Fraction.
§ 30.—We have seen that as 8 increases from 0° to 90°,
the point M (Fig. 21) continually moves in from A to 0.
Thus OM takes all the values between 1 and 0, as 0 passes
from 0° to 90°.
It follows that to construct the acute angle whose cosine
is a given positive proper fraction, we have only to determine
the point M which corresponds to this fraction.
When M is known, the angle AOP follows immediately.
But we need not use the circle of unit radius. All that we have
to do is to construct a right-angled triangle in which the
length of one side is given by the numerator of the given
fraction, and the length of the hypothenuse is given by the
denominator.
The angle adjacent to the side referred to is the required
angle.

§ 31. —We have seen in § § 19-23 how to use the Table of
Sines. The Table of Cosines, which contains the cosines of
angles from 0° to 90°, is employed in the same way. The
only difference arises from the fact that the cosine decreases
as the angle increases from 0° to 90°.
From this Table we are able to read off the cosine of any
acute angle, and to say what is the acute angle to which a
given cosine belongs.

To find the cosine, when the angle is given.
§ 32. —Suppose we wish to find cos 40° 32'.
In the Table we have the following figures:
Thus we have cos 40° 36'= -7593
cos 40° 30' = -7604.
And we know that cos 40° 32' lies between these two
numbers. We look along to the column at the right-hand of
the page. It tells us that if we add 2' to 40° 30' we must
subtract -0004 from -7604. (The cosine decreases as the angle
increases from 0° to 90°).
Thus we have cos 40° 32' = -7600.
Worked Examples.
§ 33. Exampe 1. —ln a right-angled triangle A = 22°
and the hypothenuse c = 125 ft. Find a and b. (Eig. 24.)
Fig. 24.
Scale, 50 ft. = 1 in.


Since A = 22°, B = 68 c .
Then we have a = 125 cos 22°
= 125 X -9272
= 115-9 • • •
Therefore a is 116 ft. to the nearest foot.
Also b 125 sin 22°
= 125 X -3746
= 46-825.
Therefore h is 47 ft. to the nearest foot.
Example 2. —A ship’s course is N. 32° E. The distance run

if her port of departure is in lat. 20° N. ? (Fig. 25.)
Fig. 25.
Scale, 5 miles = 1 in.


Let the distance travelled North be x nautical miles.
Then we have x == 10 cos 32°
' = 8-480.
Thus the required distance is 8-5 nautical miles to the

To find the angle, when the cosine is given.
§ 34.—Eor example, if cos 0 -7588, what is the value of
e f
The Table of Cosines tells us that
cos 40° 42'= -7581
and cos 40° 36' = -7593.
Thus we see that 6 lies between 40° 36' and 40° 42'.
The difference between -7581 and -7588 is -0007. We look
along to the right-hand of the, page and find that this difference
corresponds to 4' subtracted from 40° 42', since an increase
in the cosine arises from a decrease in the angle.
Thus 6 =4o° 38'.
We work out another example:
If cos 6 -7610, what is the value of 6 ?
We have cos 40° 30' = -7604.
Difference 6 (corresponds to a decrease
of 3').
Therefore 6 =4o° 27'.
As remarked on page 33, in the case of the sine, it is usual to take
the number in the Table next below the given cosine. The minutes,
obtained from the right-hand of the page, have now to be subtracted
from the angle.

Then we have cos 0 =

But cos 72° 36' = -2990.
Difference = 10 (corresponds to a de-

CHAPTER V.
THE TANGENT OF AN ACUTE ANGLE.
§ 36.—We have seen that the ratio
MP opposite side
or -i-f (Fig. 28)
OM adjacent side
is called the tangent of the angle AOR.
Fig. 28.
Also we have shown that this fraction has the same value
no matter where P is taken upon either arm of the angle.
§ 37.— We shall now examine how the tangent changes as
the angle increases from 0° to 90°.
Take a quadrant of a circle of unit radius bounded by the
radii OA and OB (Fig. 29).
Let AOR be an angle 6 between 0° and 90° and let OR
cut the tangent to the circle at A in the point P.
Then AP is at right-angles to OA.
AP
Therefore tan 6 =7— >
OA
= AP, since OA is unity.


Fig. 29.
Thus the number which gives the length of the intercept
AP on the tangent, in the scale on which OA is unity, will be
equal to tan 6.
This is the reason why we have the name tangent for this
ratio.
As the angle increases from 0° to 90°, the point P con-
tinually moves away from A along the tangent.
It follows that as the angle increases the tangent increases.
When the angle is 45°, AP = OA, and we have
tan 45° = 1.
It follows that between 0° and 45° tan 0 < 1, and between
45° and 90° tan 0 > I.


§ 38.—1 f we have a very small angle, the point P will be
very near the point A ( Cf . Fig. 29).
When OP moves still nearer to OA, the point P moves still
nearer to the point A; and when OP ultimately coincides with
OA, the point P coincides with the point A.
Thus the length of AP becomes zero, when 6 becomes o°.
Therefore we say that tan 0° = 0.
Again when the angle is very nearly a right-angle, the point
P will be a long way up from A.
As the angle gets nearer and nearer a right-angle, the point
P moves continually further up the tangent. By going
sufficiently near to a right-angle, the length of AP will become
greater than any number we care to name.
Thus as the angle gets nearer and nearer to a right-angle
the tangent increases without limit.
This is what is meant by saying that
tan 90° is infinity.
This result is usually written
tan 90° co .
§ 39.—As 9 increases from 0° to 90°, tan 0 increases
from 0 to oo .
Every angle between 0° and 90° has its own tangent, a
positive number, which belongs to it and to no other acute
angle.
We shall see below that, as in the case of the sine and
cosine, if we are given the tangent we can identify the angle.
Approximate Tangents shown Graphically.
§ 40. —From Fig, 30 we can read off approximately the
tangent of any angle between 0° and about 70°.
As the angle increases from 70° towards 90°, the tangent
increases so rapidly, and becomes so very great, that the
diagram becomes altogether too large.


As a matter of fact,
tan 75°- lies between 3 and 4,
tan 80 s lies between 5 and 6,
tan 81° lies between 6 and 7,
tan 82° lies between 7 and 8,
tan 83° lies between 8 and 9,
tan 84° lies between 9 and 10,
tan 85° lies between 11 and 12,
tan 86° lies between 14 and 15,
tan 87° lies between 19 and 20,
tan 88° lies between 28 and 29,
tan 89° lies between 57 and 58,
tan 89° 30' lies between 114 and
115.
But these results, at least those at
the end, could not conveniently be ob-
tained graphically.
The pupil should draw this figure for
himself to a suitable scale on squared
paper, and construct a rough Table of
Tangents.
Fig. 30.


Approximate Determination of Tangents from a
Geometrical Construction.
§ 41.—1 t is clear that when we are given an angle, the
value of the tangent can be determined approximately, with
the aid of a circle of unit radius, as in the preceding section.
But the circle is not necessary in the figure. All that we
have to do is to draw the angle with the protractor. Mark off
on OA a convenient length OM and raise the perpendicular
MP. If OM is 1 inch, then we have to read oft the length
of MP in inches (C/. Fig. 31). If OM is 10 cm., the num-
ber of cm. in MP, divided by 10, will give the tangent.
Fig. 31.
Geometrical Construction for the Acute
Angle whose Tangent is a given number.
§ 42.—A1l that we have to do is to construct a right-angled
triangle so that one of the sides containing the right-angle is
of unit length, and the length of the other, on this scale, is
the given number. The angle opposite the latter side is the
required angle.
If the number is less than unity, the angle lies between 0°
and 45°. If it is greater than unity, the angle lies between
45° and 90°.

The Table of Tangents.
§ 43. —We have already explained how to use the Table of
Sines and Cosines. The Table of Tangents, which contains
the tangents of angles from 0° to nearly 90°, is employed in
just the same way. From this Table we are able to read off
the tangent of any acute angle, and to say what is the acute
angle to which a given tangent belongs.
The Table of Tangents ( continued ).
To find the tangent when the angle is given.
§ 44. —Suppose we want tan 46° 10'.
in the Table we have the following figures:—
Thus we have tan 46° 12'= 1*0428
tan 46° 6' =1*0392.
Also we know that tan 46° 10' lies between these two
numbers. We look along the column at the right-hand of the
page. It tells us that if we add 4' to 46° 6', we must add
*0025 to 1*0392.
Thus we have tan 46° 10' = 1*0417.


Worked Examples.
§ 45.—Example I.—ln a right-angled triangle C = 90°,
A = 36° 50', b= 56 ft. Find a. (Fig. 32.)
Fig. 32.
Scale, 40 ft. = 1 in.
We have a = b tan A.
Therefore a = 56 tan 36° 50'
= 56 X -7490
= 41-94 • •
Therefore a = 42 ft. to the nearest foot.
Example 2. —A tower AB subtends an angle of 55° at a
point C on the horizontal plane on which it stands, C being
120 ft. from the foot of the tower. What is its height?
(Fig. 33.)


Fig. 33.
Scale, 100 ft. = 1 in.
Let AB x ft.
Then x = 120 tan 55°
= 120 X 14281
= 171-3 . . .
Therefore AB = 171 ft. to the nearest foot.

-The Table of Tangents {continued).
To find the angle , ichen the tangent is given.
§ 46. For example, if tan 9 = 1-0513, what is the value
of 6 ?
The Table of Tangents tells us that
tan 46° 30' = 1-0538
tan 46° 24' = 1-0501.
Thus we see that 6 lies between 46° 24' and 46° 30'. The
difference between 1-0501 and 1-0513 is -0012. We look
along to the right-hand of the page and find that this differ-
ence corresponds to 2' added to 46° 24'.
Thus 9 = 46° 26'.
We work out another example:
If tan 9 -- 1-0674, what is the value of 9 P
We have tan 46° 48' = 1-0649.
Difference = 25 (corresponds to an increase
of 4').
Therefore 9 =46° 52'.


Worked Examples.
§ 47.—Example I.—ln a right-angled triangle, C = 90°,
a= 49 ft., h= 56 ft. Find A. (Fig. 34.)

49
We have tan A -8750.
56
But tan 41° 6' = -8724.
Difference = 26 (corresponds to an in-
crease of s').
Therefore A = 41° 11'.
Example 2. —A chimney 90 ft. high casts a shadow 145 ft,
long. Calculate the sun’s altitude. (Fig. 35.)
Let 6 the sun’s altitude.
90
Then tan 6 —tTk = ‘6207.
145
But tan 31° 48' = -6200
Difference = 7 (corresponds to an increase
of 2'L
Therefore 6 = 31° 50'.

CHAPTER VI.
SOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY.
§ 48.—Trigonometry is very frequently used in finding the
height or distance of an object like a hill, tower, or tree, the
breadth of a river, the area of a piece of land, etc. Indeed,
as the name Trigonometrical Survey suggests, every careful
survey of a district depends upon trigonometrical calculations.
In this chapter some elementary methods of solving such
problems will be illustrated by simple examples. But the
general methods in use require more advanced work and for
them logarithmic calculation is indispensable.
Simple apparatus will also be described by means of which
the observations referred to can be carried out. Boys should
be encouraged to make such apparatus themselves, and to
calculate heights and distances in the neighbourhood, to draw
up a plan of a piece of land, and to find its area, etc.
Elementary field-work of this kind will make such an
introductory course as this much more valuable.
•Angles of Elevation and Depression.
§ 49.—i n practical work, such as surveying, the observer
has an instrument called a theodolite, Which, among other
things, gives him the angle through which a telescope is
turned in a vertical plane from the horizontal position till it
points to the object to be observed.
If this object is the top of a mountain, tower, tree, etc., and
the observer is below it, he looks up to the object and the
telescope is turned up from the horizontal position through
an angle. This angle is called the Angle of Elevation of the
object. (Fig. 36.)


If the observer is on the top of a cliff, hill, or tower, etc.,
and looks down to an object, the telescope is turned down
from the horizontal position through an angle. This angle
is called the Angle of Depression of the object. (Fig. 37.)
In other words, the angle between a horizontal plane through
the observer’s eye and a line joining the eye to an object is
called—
(i.) The Angle of Elevation of the object, if it is above
the point of observation;
(ii.) The Angle of Depression of the object, if it is below
the point of observation.
Fig. 36.
Fig. 37.
If the observer is at 0, and AB are two points in the
vertical plane AOB, such that OA is horizontal,
[_ AOB = the angle of elevation of B (Fig. 36); and
(_ AOB = the angle of depression of B (Fig. 37).
The Clinometer and the Plane-Table.
§ 50.—An instrument which will measure angles of eleva-
tion and depression is sometimes called a clinometer.
E


For rough measurements the protractor itself can be turned
into a clinometer. We need only attach to a piece of fine
Fig. 38.
string a small weight and fasten the other end of the string
to the centre of the protractor by a pin, or other con-
venient means. When the protractor is in a vertical plane
and its edge horizontal the string will hang as in the dotted
line in Fig. 38, just pressing against the face. If the pro-
tractor is then set by the eye to the point to be observed,
the angle of elevation or depression, as the ease may be, can
Fig. 39.
be read off from the position of the string. For example,
in Fig. 39 the angle of elevation is found to be B°.


For more careful measurements the apparatus sketched in
Fig. 40 can be easily constructed. The upright is a piece of
wood, about 12 in. by 3 in. by 1 in. Another piece, about
Fig. 40.
12 in. by 3 in. by 2 in., is accurately planed so as to form
a rectangular block. In the middle of the face (12 in. by
2 in.) a hole is bored and a clamping-screw fixed, so that the
block can be screwed fairly firm to the upright. In this way
we can have motion about this axis, and the block will remain
at rest after being turned through any angle. To the face
(12 in. by 2 in.), for convenience just below the axis of
rotation, a semi-circular protractor is fixed with the diameter
uppermost and parallel to the edge. At the centre of its
circle a pin is inserted. To the pin a weight is attached by
a fine stxing.
If this piece of apparatus is held so that the string just
presses against the block and passes through the 90° mark
on the protractor, the top surface of the block and the
axis of rotation will be horizontal.
If the block is now turned about this axis, the stand
remaining fixed, the angle through which it has been turned
will be indicated by the position of the string after this
rotation.


To complete the instrument a line should be drawn right
along the middle of the top face of the block to act as the
line of sight. If more accuracy is required, two 11 sights”
Fig. 41.
can be inserted in this line. For example, two small brass
screws with the central grooves filed to the same depth by
a triangular file, such as is used in sharpening a saw, would
serve the purpose. The top of the screws must be at the
same height above the block, and the central grooves right
along the middle line. A card held over the one further
from the observer’s eye will give a triangular gap, and the
point to be observed should be in a line with the lowest
points of these Y-shaped hollows.
So that the axis of rotation will be horizontal, it is con-
venient to use this instrument along with the plane-table,
the instrument sketched in Fig. 41, by which angles in a
horizontal plane are measured. The plane-table is simply a
portable table on a tripod. The table has to be horizontal,
and this can be tested by a spirit-level, the levels being
taken in two directions along the surface. Two levels fixed
to the table would be more convenient, but such small levels
are not so easily obtained as the ordinary cai’penter’s level.


On its surface a circular protractor is fixed. Such a pro-
tractor could be made of paper and then pasted on. A
“ pointer ” is fastened to the table by a pin through the centre
of the protractor, which should also he the centre of
Fig. 42.
the table, and the pointer is free to turn above this pin as
axis. The pointer in the instrument shown is simply a piece
of an ordinary wooden ruler with one end sharpened to a
point. At this end a pin is fixed perpendicular to the ruler
and at the other end there is a small screw-eye. The top of
the pin should appear at the centre of the screw-eye, and
the pin should be along a vertical radius.
As the exact position from which the observation is taken
must be known, a weight is attached by a string to the vertex
of the tripod, or the centre of the plate to which the legs of
the tripod are hinged. This weight will mark the point of
observation.
Near the side of the observer in Fig. 42 the clinometer will
be noticed on the ground.
This piece of apparatus allows angles in a horizontal plane
to be measured. In Fig. 42 the observer has the pointer
turned to the pole fixed upright in the ground some distance


away. This pole should be in a line with the pin at the
end of the pointer, when seen through the screw-eye. The
pole marks one end of a base-line, as described in § 56, and
the instrument is at the other. The observer would then
turn the pointer, without moving the table, till it comes into
line with another marked position. And the difference of
the readings on the protractor would give the angle through
which the pointer has been turned.
These two simple pieces of apparatus allow the observations
for which the surveyor uses a theodolite to be carried out.
Simple Examples in Heights and Distances.
§ 51.—The following worked examples illustrate the
simplest kind of observation: —
Example I.—A tower stands on a horizontal plane. A man
on the ground, 100 ft. from the tower, finds the angle of
elevation of the top to be 50°. What is its height? (Fig.
43.)
Fig. 43.
Scale, 100 ft. = 1 in.


Let AC be the tower, and B the point of observation.
Let AC = x ft.
Then we have BC = 100 ft.,
and l_ ABC = 50°.
Therefore x 100 tan 50°
= 11948.
Therefore we take the height of the tower as 119 ft.
Example 2.—A man looks from the top of a cliff, 120 ft.
high, at a mark in the water. He observes that the angle of
depression of the mark is 32°. Find how far it is from the
foot of the cliff. (Fig. 44.)
Fig. 44.
Scale, 100 ft. = 1 in.
Let AC be the cliff and B the mark.
Let BC = x ft.
Then we have AC = 120 ft.,
and i ABC = 32°.
Therefore x = 120 tan 58°
= 192-036.
Thus we take the distance to the mark to be 192 ft.
In this example it was better to work with /.BAG than
/_ABC, as by doing so we avoided division.


Example 3. —To find the breadth of a river, a man observes
a point A on one bank just opposite a point B on the other.
He then walks along the bank—supposed straight at this
place—to a point C, such that BC —■ 150 ft. The angle ACB
is found to be 42°. What is the breadth of the river? (Fig.
45.)
Fig. 45.
Scale, 100 ft. = 1 in.
Let the breadth be x ft.
Then we have x 150 tan 42°
= 150 X -9004
= 135-06.
Thus the breadth of the river is 135 ft. to the nearest foot.
EXAMPLES XY.
1. A tower stands on a horizontal plane. A man observes
the angle of elevation of the tower from a point on the plane.
Find the height of the tower in the following cases:
(i.) Distance of point of observation from tower = 200 ft.;

sion of a boat directly opposite. Find the distance of the

(ii.) Angie of depression 2o°; height of cliff = 150 ft.
(iii.) Angle of depression = 60°; height of cliff = 275 ft.

(i.) Height of cliff = 100 ft.; distance of the boat = 150 ft,
(ii.) Height of cliff = 120 ft.;, distance of the boat l7O ft.
(iii.) Height of cliff = 160 ft.; distance of the boat = I’OO ft.
(iv.) Height of cliff = 200 ft.; distance of the boat 375 ft.
5. To find the breadth of a river a man marks a point A
on one bank just opposite a point B on the other. He then
walks along the first bank down the river to a point C, distant
]OO yds. from A, and finds the angle ACB to be 55°. What
is the breadth of the river?
6. With the same observations as in the preceding question,
find the breadth of a river as the mean of three observations


taken at distances 100, 125, and 150 yds. from A. The angles
subtended by AB at these points being 44° 30', 37° 48' and
33° 30'.
7. Ais a tree on one bank of a river. Bis a point on the
other bank directly opposite A. The angle of elevation of
the top of the tree is 55° 30' and its height is 80 ft. Find the
breadth of the river.
8. Ais a point on one bank of a river. Bis a point on the
other bank directly opposite A, and 10 yds. from the edge.
An observer walks from B at right angles to AB up the river
30 yds. to C, and finds that the angle ACB = 75°. He starts
again from B and walks down the river at right angles to
AB 40 yds. to D and finds the angle ADB = 70°. Find the
breadth* of the river as the mean of these two observations.
The Determination op Areas.*
§ 52. —The area of a field of a moderate size can be ob-
tained, and a fairly accurate plan prepared, by means of
measurements with the chain (the surveyor’s line, 66 ft.
long).
In using the chain two men are required. The leader goes
ahead with one end of the chain; the follower, who holds the
other end of the chain, remains at the starting point. When
the chain is pulled tight, the follower directs the leader so
that he will be in a straight line towards the point, the dis-
tance to which they are measuring. This point has usually
been marked bj r a pole stuck up for that purpose. The
leader puts a peg in the ground to mark the end of the first
chain, and they walk on. When the follower reaches the
peg the process is repeated.
* §§ 52-59 are more difficult, and have been inserted chiefly for the sake of
those who will not proceed to a fuller study of Trigonometry. Some of them may
wish, to know the way in which the elements of Trigonometry can he applied to
simple field-work. It should he noted that the calculations will he much shorter
if logarithms are used.

Suppose that ABODE (Fig. 46) represents a piece of land
to be surveyed. The surveyor measures with the chain the
length of a suitable line (say AD) joining two corners.
He also obtains the positions of L, M, and N, the feet of
the perpendiculars from the corners B, C and E to AD, and
the lengths of BL, CM and EN. These lines are called the
offsets.
When the leader comes to the points L, M and N, he puts
in pegs, and BL, CM and EN are measured with the chain.
By this means the positions of B, C and E are fixed, and
the held may be plotted to scale, if desired.
The Field-Book.
g 53. The above measurements are entered on a page of
the field-book, beginning at the bottom of the centre column,
which shows the distances of the various points from A.
Offsets on the left of the measured line AD are shown on
the left of the central column, and offsets on the right are
shown on the right.
LINKS.


As there are 100 links in a chain, this works out as
follows:
I I X 144 X 1-50 \
Area to right = U X 142 X 2-60 > sq. ch.
( i X 144 X 140 )
C -855 )
= < 1-456 > sq. ch.
( -627 )
= 2-938 sq. eh.
Area to left = | X 3-40 X 1-60 sq. eh.
= 2 - 72 sq. ch.
Total area =5-658 sq. eh.
But 1 acre = 10 sq. eh.
Hence the total area of the plot is approximately
0-57 acres.
The Area of a Triangle.
§ 54.—When the distances are large and the ground un-
even, it is much easier to measure angles with accuracy than
lengths, and for all surveys on a large scale a different
method to that above described is employed.
If the field is triangular, we could find its area and shape
in various ways:
(1) We might measure the length of one side and the size
of the adjacent angles.
(2) Again we might measure two sides and the included
angle.
We omit the case in which the three sides can be measured
directly, as we are supposing the dimensions too great, or
the ground unsuitable. The formula for the area of a
triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides is given in most
text-books of geometry.
I. — To find the area of a triangle ABC, when we know one
side and the adjacent angles; e.g., a, B and C. (Fig. 47.)


Fig. 47.
Let AD be the perpendicular from A to BC.
Then AD=BD tan B
=CD tan C.
But BD -j" DC = a.
Therefore AD( ——- -f- -- «•
y tan B tan C /
tan B tan C
Therefore AD =a~ ~—; — -•
tan B + tan C
Then Area = | AD X BC
_ tan B tan C
a a tan B + tan C
Tig. 47 has been drawn for B and C acute angles. Slight
changes in the work would have to be made if either of the
angles were obtuse.
This formula should not be remembered, but each case
worked out from an appropriate figure.
11. —To find the area of a triangle ABC when two sides and
the included angle are given; e.g., a. c and B.
With the same figure and construction as above, we have
AD = c sin B.
Area t= i AD X BC
= 4 a c sin B.
If the two sides contain an obtuse angle, it will be easily
proved, from a suitable figure, that we replace the sine of the
angle by the sine of its supplement.'


EXAMPLES XVI.
1. The base of a triangle is 120 yds. The base angles are
66° and 54°. Hoav many sq. yds. does it contain 1 ?
2. One side of a triangle is 440 yds. The adjacent angles
are 130° and 20°. How many acres does it contain?
3. Two straight roads, AB, AC, diverge from A at an angle
of 48°. AB is I mile and AC is \ mile. A straight fence
is put up from B to C, Find the area in acres of the
triangle ABC.
4. AB, BC are two straight fences containing an angle of
78°. The length of AB is 4 ch. 37 Ik. From what point in
BC must a fence be run across to A to cut off an area of 1
acre?
-The Area op a Field avith Straight Boundaries.
§ 55.—1 f the field is a quadrilateral Ave can find its area
and shape as in § 52, or we may proceed as follows: —
Fig. 48.
If we can measure AB and AD (Fig. 48), also
the angles BAG, ABC, CAD, ADC, then we can find the
areas of the triangles ABC and ACD by § 54.
Again, if the four sides can be measured and two of the
opposite angles, the area would follow from the second
formula of § 54.
But it might happen that only one of the sides could be
conveniently measured. In this ease Ave could still find the
area from the results of § 54.


For suppose that we can measure BC. We then observe
the angles ABC and ACB. We can thus work out the area
of the triangle ABC.
When the area of ABC is known, the length of AC follows
from the formula for the area, when two sides and the in-
cluded angle are given (also cf. Ex. 6, page 22).
We now proceed to the triangle ACD. To find its area we
need only measure the angles ACD and DAC, since we know
AC.
It is obvious that this method can be extended to a field
of any number of sides. But with these elementary methods
the work is long.
§ 56.—1 t may happen that the dimensions are too large, or
the ground unsuitable for the measurement of any one of thQ
sides of the field. In this case a convenient line, PQ, is
measured on level ground within or without the given area,
and this is taken as the initial line or base-line.
Fig. 49.
From the ends P and Q, the angles APQ and AQP are
observed (Fig. 49). Thus the area of the triangle APQ can
be obtained, as well as the length of AP.
With AP as new base-line, we observe the angles APB and
BAP. From these observations and the length of AP, the
area of the triangle APB is found and the length of PB.
In this way we can proceed round the figure and obtain its
whole area, and plot it on a plan.


§ 57. —Such a plan as has been spoken of in the previous
sections indicates the shape of the field, but does not give the
actual directions of its boundaries. In many cases these
directions are needed. For this purpose a compass is
required, by means of which the bearings of the lines would
be obtained.
The simple measurements we have considered have been
supposed to refer to fairly level ground. If the ground is
hilly it would be necessary to use more elaborate methods
to show the heights of the observed points above the
horizontal plane through the base-line and the projections
of these points upon that plane.
More Difficult Examples in Heights and Distances.
§ 58.—1 t frequently happens that the method of §5l can-
not be employed; as, for example, when the foot of the
observed object is inaccessible.
The method used in the following example will give both
the height and the distance of the point observed.
Example.—From two points, A and B, one mile apart, on a
horizontal plane, the angles of elevation of the top of a hill
due East of both points are found to be 25° 24' and 40° 12'
respectively. Show that its height above A and B is about
5720 ft. and its horizontal distance from B about 6770 ft.
Let D be the top of the hill, and C the foot of the perpen-
dicular from Dto the plane. (Fig. 50.)
Then A, B and C lie in a straight line.
Let BC = x ft. and CD = y ft.
Then from the triangle ACD we have
y (x + 5280) tan 25° 24'.
And from the triangle BCD we have
y = x tan 40° 12'.
These two equations are sufficient to determine x and y.
F


Fig. 50.
Scale, 2000 ft. = 1 cm.
The tvork, without logarithms, is a little easier if we take
the tangents of the angles at D instead of those at A and B.
In this ease we have
x + 5280 = y tan 64° 36',
x = y tan 49° 48'.
5280
These give y = tao 64 „ 3r _ tan 4 9»-48'
5280
•9227
= 5722.
tan 64° 36' = 2-1060
tan 49° 48' = 1-1833
•9227.
But as these values for tan 64° 36' and tan 49° 48' are
correct only to four decimals, we cannot be sure of the last
figures of our answer. •
We thus say that the height is about 5720 ft.
Again we have x = y tan 49° 48'
= 5722 X 1-1833
= 6770-8 . .
Thus the distance is about 6770 ft.


§ 59.—Another method of finding the difference of level of
two points, and the horizontal distance between them, will
now be described.
It will be seen that the calculations involved are very
similar to those of § 58.
P and Q are the two points, and QR the perpendicular
through Q to the horizontal plane through P (Fig. 51).
Fig. 51
The observer at P fixes his theodolite so that the axis of the
telescope is at C, vertically above P.
His assistant holds a rod vertical at Q; the divisions of this
rod are distinctly marked and are visible from C.
The angles of elevation, ACD and BCD, of two of these
marks, A and B, are read off from C.
These observations determine PR and QR.
For example—
Suppose PC = 5 ft. 6 in.; [_ ACD =7° and [_ BCD = 8°;
QA = 2 ft. 6 in., and QB = 5 ft.
Let PR = x ft. and QR = y ft.
Then from the triangle ACD we have
(y + 2|) 5J = x tan 7°; '
and, from the triangle BCD,
(y + 5) 5i = x tan B°.


Thus y—3 = x tan 7°, (1)
y—4 = x tan B°. (2)
Subtracting (1) from (2).
2-5
X ~ -0177
= 141-2 • •
tan 8° = T 405
tan 7° = -1228
•0177.
Therefore the distance is 141 ft. to the nearest foot.
And y = x tan 7° + 3
= 141 X -1228 + 3
= 17-3 • • • + 3
= 20-3 • • •
Therefore the height is 20 ft. to the nearest foot.

THE SONGS OF A SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.
By C. J. Dennis. Tenth thousand. With 14 full-
page Drawings by Hal Gye and Foreword by
Henry Lawson. Cloth, 3s, 6d.
The Bulletin (Sydney): “‘The Songs of a Sentimental
Bloke’ is the most typically Australian book published for a
decade. Its humour, its sentiment, its genuine humanity, are
expressed with feeling and an assured poetic craftsmanship.
C. J. Dennis is not only an Australian poet: he is a poet.”
Sydney Morning Herald : ‘ ‘ Bill is a wholly delightful
person, and from what he tells us of Doreen, she must be
equally delightful . . . Mr. Hal Gye’s illustrations deserve
mention; their idea is distinctly original, and the scheme is
carried out cleverly. ’’
Daily Telegraph (Sydney): “Captivatingly fresh and
original . . . The verse is very human and clean, and its
appeal is universal, for it depicts the simple emotions that are
not confined to the class that uses dialect . . . Sure to be
popular, because it has the qualities of humour and lifelike-
ness. Also the feeling in it rings true.”
The Argus (Melbourne): “The genuine humour of these
larrikin love poems is all the more effective because beneath
the surface fun there is a suggestion of deeper feelings that
ennoble men and unite them in the bonds of common fellow
ship. ’ ’
The Age (Melbourne): “ ‘The Sentimental Bloke’ is a
striking conception and his portrayal masterly. ’ ’
The Herald (Melbourne): “The Bloke is a character who
is likely long to remain deservedly popular in this country’s
literature. ‘The sonnet shining in the eyes’ has been fixed
by Mr. Dennis in what is certainly a classic of its class, and
he secures an effect of true poetry without straining a
simile or defying the canons of Australia’s colloquial speech. ’ ’
Queenslander; “A well-printed, cleverly-illustrated, and
pleasant to handle little volume. The humour of the ‘ Sent!
mental Bloke’ has an exquisite quality, its sentiment a tender-
ness, and its philosophy a soundness which compel attention
.. . genuine poetry ... a sensitive appreciation of the
beautiful . . . wholesome philosophy . . admirable verses. ’ ’

trations. Cloth gilt, gilt top. 3s. fid.; full morocco,
gilt edges, fis. ( postage 2d.)
.7. Brunton Stephens, in The Bulletin: “Boake’s work D

the life.”

Bookman; “These verses are full of poetic fancy musically
expressed.”
Sydney Morning Herald: “The indefinable charm is here,
and the spell, and the music. ... A distinct advance for
Australian verse in ideality, in grace and polish, in the study
of the rarer forms of verse, and in the true faculty of poetic
feeling and expression.”

By Victor J. Daley. With portrait. Cloth gilt, gilt
top, 3s. fid.; full morocco, gilt edges, fis. (postage
2d.)
Daily Telegraph: “Most of his verse is tinged with sad
ness—as in most Irish poetry —but there is a fine imaginative
quality that lifts it to a far higher plane than that of the
conventional melancholy rhymer. There are poems in this
book that recall the magic of Rossetti .... Victor Daley
has left his mark in the beginnings of an Australian literature."

full morocco, gilt edges, 6s, ( postage 2d.)
The Academy: “These ballads (for such they mostly are)
abound in spirit and manhood, in the colour and smell of Aus-
tralian soil. They deserve the popularity which they have won
in Australia, and which, we trust, this edition will now give
them in England.”

WHEN I WAS KING, AND OTHER VERSES.
By Henry Lawson. Tenth thousand. Cloth gilt,
gilt top, 3s. 6d.; full morocco, gilt edges, 6s,
{postage 2d.)
The Spectator; “A good deal of humour, a great deal
of spirit, and a robust philosophy are the main characteristics
of these Australian poets. Because they write of a world
they know, and of feelings they have themselves shared in,
they are far nearer the heart of poetry than the most accom-
plished devotees of a literary tradition.”
ON THE TRACK AND OVER THE SLIPRAILS.
By Henry Lawson. Twentieth thousand. Cloth gilt,
gilt top, 3s. 6d.; full morocco, gilt edges, 6s.

{postage 2d.)
Scotsman: “Its verses draw their natural inspiration from

teristic and compelling rhythms from the clatter of horses’
hoofs.”

gilt top, 3s. 6d.; full morocco, gilt edges, 6s.
(postage 2d:)
The Academy; “A book of honest, direct, sympathetic,
humorous writing about Australia from within is worth a
library of travellers’ tales . . . The result is a real book —a
book in a hundred. His language is terse, supple, and richly
idiomatic. He can tell a yarn with the best.”
CHILDREN OF THE BUSH.
By Henry Lawson. Eleventh thousand. Cloth gilt,
gilt top, 3s. 6d.; full morocco, gilt edges, 6s.

JOE WILSON AND HIS MATES.
By Henry Lawson. Eleventh thousand. Cloth gilt,
gilt top, 3s. 6d.; full morocco, gilt edges, 6s.
{postage 2d.)
The Athenaeum: “This is a long way the best
work Mr. Lawson has yet given us. These stories are so good
that (from the literary point of view of course) one hopes
they are not autobiographical. As autobiography they would
be good, as pure fiction they are more of an attainment.”
London: Wm. Blackwood (ft Sons.

TEE GARDE'S! OF KAMA.
Daily Chronicle: “No one has so truly interpreted the
Indian mind —no one, transcribing Indian thought into our
literature, has retained so high and serious a level, and quite
apart from the rarity of themes and setting—the verses remain
—true poems.”
STARS OF TEE DESERT.
Outlook: “It is not merely that these verses describe
Oriental scenes and describe them with vividness, there is a
feeling in the rhythm—a timbre of the words that seems akin
to the sand and palm-trees and the changeless East.”
IN DIAS LOVE.
Spectator: “The poetry o< Laurence Hope must hold a
unique place in modern letters. No woman has written lines
so full of a strange primeval savagery —a haunting music—
the living force of poetry.”
London: William Heinemann.
THE WITCH MAID, AND OTHER VERSES.
By Dorothea Mackellar. Cloth gilt, gilt top, Bs. 6d.
(postage 2d.)
Sydney Morning Herald : “ She possesses to a remarkable
degree the faculty of conjuring up before our eyes an extraordin-
arily vivid picture in a single line or even a word or two. Miss
Mackellar can grasp the essential spirit of a scene, and what is
rarer still, can find words to make us, too, see it, where before we
have been blind ”

printed in colours, 3s. 6d. ( postage Id.)
Sydney Morning Herald: “A charming and interesting
little book , . . they live and breathe, and he has contrived to
make actual to us those remote and almost incredible days
. . . Mr. Smith’s admirable illustrations are an equally im-
portant feature of the book, which, in addition to its interest,
presents a great antiquarian value.”
TEE RISING OF TEE COURT , AND OTHER
SKETCHES IN PROSE AND VERSE.,
By Henry Lawson. With picture cover (Common-
wealth Series ), Is. (postage Id.)
Queensland Times ; “These stories show Lawson at his
best, and Lawson at his best is not to be beaten by short story
writers in current literature.”
AN OUTBACK MARRIAGE: A Story of Australian Life.
By A. B. Paterson, Ninth thousand, with picture
cover {Commonwealth Series), Is. (postage Id.)

and vivid presentment of the wild life and the picturesque man-
ners of the Australian bush, while in form and style it claims
recognition as a work of considerable literary distinction.”
TEE OLD BUSH SONGS.
Collected and edited by A. B. Paterson. Thirteenth
thousand, with picture cover {Commonwealth
Series), Is. {postage Id.)
Daily Telegraph: “Rude and rugged these old bush songs
are, but they carry in their vigorous lines the very impress of
their origin and of their genuineness . . . Mr. Paterson has
done his work like an artist.”
GODS AND WOOD THINGS.
By L. H. Allen. Paper boards, Is. {postage Id.)
Sydney Morning Herald; “Mr. Allen is one of the select
band who are saturated with classic lore and who seek to
translate the beings of pagan mythology to the Australian
bush. ‘Gods and Wood Things’ contains both prose and verse
—the latter rhapsodical, the former mystical.”

tinct charm in these fairy tales.”
SCRIBBLING SUE, AND OTHER STORIES.
By Amy Eleanor Mack. With coloured and other
illustrations and decorated cloth cover, 3s. 6d.
(postage 2d.)
These stories are written in the same happy vein as “Bush-
land Stories.” Miss Mack’s intense love of nature is reflected
in all her books, and her readers, both young and old, are at
once attracted by the natural ring of her work.
GEM OF THE FLAT : A Story of Young Australians.
By Constance Mackness. With coloured and other
illustrations and decorated cloth cover, 3s. 6d.
(postage 2d.)
“Gem of the Flat” is a story of Australian bush children.
The local colouring is distinctly good; the children are alive,
and talk like real children; the incidents are natural and well
described. The style is fresh, the dialogue well managed, and
the story as a whole is interesting and pleasant, with a good
tone about it.
DOT AND THE KANGAROO.
By Ethel C. Pedley. Illustrated by F. P. Mahony.
Third edition, with decorated cloth cover, 2s. 6d.
(postage 2d.)
Sydney Morning Herald : “ ‘Dot and the Kangaroo’ is with-
out doubt one of the most charming books that could be put
into the hands of a child. It is admirably illustrated by Frank
P. Mahony, who seems to have entered thoroughly into the
animal world of Australia. The story is altogether Australian.
... It is told so simply, and yet so artistically, that even
the ‘grown-ups’ amongst us must enjoy it.”

(postage 6d.)
Sydney Morning Herald: “No man ever entered on a
better fight with his fellow citizens, with the Governors, with
the British Government, with the scientists, with the judicial
authorities, indeed with almost every authority that w-as there
to be fought, than John Macarthur when he undertook single-
handed the great fight which finally established the wool
industry in Australia. ’ ’
Uniform with the above.

By Ernest Scott, Professor of History in the Uni-
versity of Melbourne, author of “Terre Napoleon”
etc. With numerous portraits, maps, manuscripts
in facsimile, etc. Cloth gilt, 21s. ( postage 6d.)
The Bulletin: “Will take its place as one of the great bio-
graphies in our language. The inexplicable fact that hitherto
no full biography of the first man to circumnavigate Australia
has appeared is also a fortunate fact. Flinders has waited a
century for his biographer, and it was worth this silence of
a hundred years to find Ernest Scott. . . , And to this
fervor of research must be added Ernest Scott’s lucid literary
style and his interest in the personal side of his subject.
Equipment, style, sympathy, and his subject combine to make
a brilliant achievement in biography. ... A word must
in mere justice be added in praise of the publishers. The
appearance of the book is worthy of its contents.’’
LIFE OF LAPEROUSE.
By Professor Ernest Scott. With Chart of Voyages
in the Pacific, and 13 illustrations. Cloth, 3s. 6d.

This story of Laperouse’s work as an explorer and his close

thoroughly revised and greatly enlarged, with

Australian Mining Standard: “Students are greatly in
debted to Mr. sussmilch tor the able manner in which he has
presented in compact form all that is known at the present
time on the subject. . . . The illustrations throughout are
excellent, but the coloured geological map which serves as a
frontispiece is a model of what such a map should be, avoid-
ing the opposite evils of overcrowding and meagreuess. Mr.
Siissmilch’s book should be of value, not only to students in
the colleges, but to those practical miners who are also
students. ; ’
