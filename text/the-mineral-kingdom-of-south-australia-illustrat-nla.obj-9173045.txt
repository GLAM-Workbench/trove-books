No, 1. Class of Specimens in which Silica pre-
dominates. Silica Minerals.
1. Compact Rizalithe (granulithe, white-
stone). —It has the appearance of horn-stone.
There occur some mica and some oxyde of iron
within the clefts of this rock—now and then, a
little felspar is seen in the fractures. This rock
begins at Mount Crawford, and runs through
the Barossa Range.
2. Pyritic Rizalithe.—The mass of this rock
is the same as the former, but it is entirely
filled with sulphuret of iron, or iron-pyrites;
some pure brimstone is found in the rock.—
Barossa Range.
3. Siliceous Rizalithe.—The mass nearly all
silica, with a red mineral, called by me Gaw-
lerite, but which shows an inclination to pro-
duce substances from this rock different from
those of the first rizalithe.—From Mount
Barker, running towards Mount Crawford.
4. Felspatic Rizalithe.—This rock is in-
clining to produce felspar in the mass, and mica
with oxyde of iron in the clefts. Where the
rock is siliceous, there appears sulphuret of
iron in the interior.—Barossa Range.
5. Gawlerite, with Mica.—The small veins
in No. 3 spread by diverging lines within the
rock of rizalithe, and producing prismatic
crystals of a felspatic nature. The oxyde of
iron from the alumina makes its appearance in
the rock.—Barossa Range.
6. Rizalithe, with predominant
silica, in which the quartz appears un-
changed, and the felspar produces the oxyde of
iron.—Same place.
7. Aluminos Rizalithe.—The mass is a com-
pact rizalithe, but it has been colored on the
surface by the annual fires on the hills, by
which the oxyde of iron has been developed as
the coloring substance.—Mount Lofty Range.
8. Quartzose Rizalithe, granulated by pre-
dominant silica, in which the alumina is half
dissolved and impeded to produce iron.—This
rock, as well as the former, is often confounded
with sandstone, and the quartz is indeed falling
into sandstone; but sandstone is formed by
sand, whilst rizalithe had been formed by water.
—Mount Lofty Range.
9. Amphibolic Rizalithe.—The root of the
rocks called gneiss and sienite. In its clefts
appear often amphibole instead of mica, and
wavellithe, or hydrargilithe, instead of felspar,
proving the germs of fluorine in rizalithe.—Ba-
rossa.
10. Felspatic Granite* —The mass of rizalithe
is still observed. Felspar is predominant, and
quartz appears as pure silica in the rock.—Ba-
rossa.
11. Ferruginous Granite.—The mass of ri-
zalithe is half changed into oxyde of iron;
some felspar and very little specks of mica may
be seen.—Barossa.
12. Glucinous Granite.—An entire separa-
tion of quartz, felspar, and mica, constitutes
this rock; but the felspar is different from that
which occurs in European granite, and inclines
to produce glucina. The quartz abounds in
pure silica, and the mica is scarce. —Mount
Crawford.
13. Alcalic Granite.—The quartz scarce; the
felspar peculiar, containing alcalies, viz., soda,
potassa, lithia. Mica is silver-white and rich
in silica.—Jacobs's Glen, Barossa.
14. Coarse-grained Granite.—Quartz and
the common felspar predominant in equal pro-
portions ; mica abounds, lying in different di-
rections in the rock.—Same place.
15. Spodamen-Granite.—The felspar mostly
gpodumen, the mica adhering to felspar, and
the quartz separate as pure silica.—Same
place.
16. Albitic Granite.—The felspar mostly
albite, the quartz separate in grains, the mica
siliceous and silver white in abundance. This
granite contains frequently crystals of beryl.
Mount Crawford.
17. Micaceous Granite.—Mica predominant
in one direction more than in the two others.
Felspar and quartz separated in lumps, con-
taining often beryl.—Mount Crawford.
18. Ferruginous Micaceous Granite.—The
predominant mica colored by oxyde of iron.
Mount Crawford.
19. Coarse-grained Albite-Granite.—The
quartz abundant, the felspar albite, the mica
scarce. This rock contains large crystals of
beryl, which continue sometimes in chains
through the whole stratum of it.—Mount Craw-
ford.
20. Felspar, separate from granite, found
sometimes as graphic granite.—Do.
21. Mica, frequently with quartz.—Do.
22. Quartz, separated from a granite, in a
state of dissolution. The felspar dissolves first
ipto porcelain-earth, and then into clay; the
mica changes into iron, and, where the silica
dissolves entirely, it changes into carbon. Thus
quartz and mica are turned into carburet of
iron, or plumbago, in every place where the
rock of granite is decomposed.—Mount Craw-
ford.


23. Glucinic Granite, with Robelithe.-—Do.
N.8.-—Robelithe is the first onset for the for-
mation of beryl. Any part of the granite is
found wrapped in by robelithe, which is identical
with beryl.—Same place.
24. Robelithe, including frequently quartz.
fA-Do.
25. Quartzose granite, with crystals of beryl.
These crystals occur disseminated, chained,
and accumulated in the rock. —Mount Craw-
ford.
26. Beryl, in six-sided prisms, mostly pre-
cious, but on the surface deprived of its trans-
parency and lustre, by the influence of the at-
mosphere and the fires.—Do.^
27. Glucinous granite, with robelithe and
tourmaline. The quartz distinctly separate,
the felspar Australian and glucinous, the robe-
lithe mixed up with the felspar, the tourmaline
imitating the robelithe in crystallization, in-
clining to a pyramid instead of a prism.—
Mount Crawford.
28. Fragments of black tourmaline; is abun-
dant in granite, with predominant quartz.—
Do.
29. The same out of granite, in a state of
dissolution, produces plumbago.—Do.
30. Tourmaline enclosed in quartz, some-
times with a little felspar. The crystals brittle,
and easily frangible on the surface.--Do.
31. Do. in felspar, with some quartz, and
seldom mica. The crystals of tourmaline some-
times replace the whole rocks of granite.
—Mount Crawford.
32. Tourmaline in mica, both of which are
sometimes entirely connected.—Mount Craw-
ford.
33. Green tourmaline in granite, with pre-
dominant felspar, black and white mica, and
small grains of quartz. The green tourmaline
is decomposed by the influence of the atmos-
phere. —Do.
34. Black and green tourmaline in granite,
in which the quartz often is found in crystals.

*—Do. N.B —The asbestos, in the shape of
wood, cork, leather, flax, &c., demonstrates a
remarkable instance of the changes of sub-
stances. The rock-wood running through huge
strata of siliceous and magnesian rocks, turns
everywhere into horn-stone and chalcedony, in
every degree of purity. The asbestos has often
a tendency to crystallization, and the crystals
answer the form of amphibole, but sometimes
those of diallagon and of epidote. There are
many strata of rocks containing asbestos, either
in the place of mica or in that of amphibole;
in the last case, the mica is replaced by fo-
liated talc.
