IN
FAVOUR OF THE SYSTEM.

much larger attendance at the schools. W ith-
in three years of 1867 (when rate-bills were
abolished in New York) the increase in that
State reached 64,748, and the report for 1870
stated that the rate-bill plan had “ repelled
attendance by directly taxing it. ”
The increase referred to, it should be re-
marked, was not due to increase of popula-
tion ; for, while the report for 1871 showed
that the average attendance in the rural dis-
tricts was nearly 17 per cent, greater than
in any year of the rate-bill system, the
increase in school population was less than
•one and a-half per cent. The report of
1873 says :—“ The statistics for the year are
distinguished by the unprecedented aggre-
gate and average attendance at the schools,
which exceeds that of any previous year by
several thousands. This is not a spasmodic
increase, but is the product of an uninter-
rupted growth that has characterised the
returns each year since the free school system
was inaugurated.” The report for 1874 says :
—“The free school system, inaugurated in
1867, has been so successfully vindicated by
its results, that it may be deemed secure.
Under its operation the aggregate yearly at-
tendance of pupils at the public schools has
increased nearly eighty-two thousand, and
the average daily attendance nearly eighty
thousand.”
The Commissioner of Public Schools for
Rhode Island says of the city of Providence:
“ The effect has been in the highest degree
satisfactory. . . The number of children
in schools has largely increased, and the per-
centage of those who do not attend school
largely diminished.”
Similar testimony is given by the New
Jersey Board of Education, and also the
Michigan report.
The Connecticut report is in the same di-
rection, and the Secretary to the Board said
in 1869, shortly after Free Education became
law in the State : ‘ ‘ The law has received an
emphatic ratification from the people. The
rate-bill is buried beyond the hope of resur-
rection.” In the following year he said:
“ The free school law has accomplished more
than its friends promised ; the test of experi-
ence is decisive ; the actual results of the
first year’s trial show that nearly six thou-
sand children were kept from school by the
rate bill. ” The following year again showed
a further increase of 5,744. The increase in
attendance in the year previous to the adop-
tion of free schools as shown by the report
was only 432.
I might quote any amount of testimony of
a similar character did space permit. For
further information I refer my readers to
Francis Adams’ excellent work on “ The
Free School System of the United States.”
“If there is one question,” says the author,
“upon which the citizens of the United
States are practically unanimous, it is in
support of free schools. The guage of pub-
lic interest in the system is the burden of
taxation which the people are willing to bear
for its maintenance.”
3. In answering argument No. 3 I feel that
I cannot do better than quote the words of
Mr. Adams having reference to the stock
objections usually made against free schools.
“ One of the most common objections,” he
says “ is that free education is a charity, and
is calculated to undermine the sense of inde-
pendence in those who receive it. ... In
the older States of America, where free schools
have been long in operation, such a criticism
is never heard ; but in some of these States
where the system has been inaugurated
during recent years objections of this
kind have been made. The State Superin-
tendent of Virginia thus replies to them in
his second Annual Report: ‘ According to
current usage, public education means
education provided by the community as a
whole, in contradistinction from education
provided by private means. It recognises
the principal that the commonwealth has a
stake in the pupils—the young people—and
that she means to guarantee her own future by
seeing that they do not lack the means of
improvement. It is education by the people,
of the people, for the people. In other
words, it is education by the public for the
public good. It does not mean charitable
by free. To say that a community, in pro-
viding a benefit for itself, is doing an
act of charity, is a solecism
Nobody stultifies himself by calling a
free bridge a charity.’ The State Superin-
tendent for Kentucky says :— ‘ We claim
that the common school is no charitable in-
stitution erected outside of the State, to be
abandoned or maintained as charitable
wealth may elect to dole out its alms.’ In
the Northern and Western States no man
dreams that in sending his children to a free
school he becomes the recipient of charity,
and no argument so absurd is ever advanced
against the system. In Connecticut, before
the abolition of rate-bills, or school fees, it
was said that such a step would weaken the
feeling of self-respect in parents, and lessen
their interest in the work of education,
How far it has done so, the Secretary of the
Connecticut Board of Education shall tell.
‘ Experience has disproved the objection that
free schools would lessen the interest and
responsibility of parents. The argument
was, that men never value what costs them
nothing ; but the fact is, that parents do pay,
and all pay their fair and equal share for
the support of this central public interest.
This system not only enhances the interest of


Free Education : a Word in favour of the System.
Although the majority of members have
declared in Parliament against Free Edu-
cation, I cannot help believing that the time
is not very distant when a system of Free
Education will prevail in Tasmania.
It seems to me that whatever arguments
can be urged against such a system can be
more than answered by the reasons which
can be urged in its favour, and by an appeal
to the results which have attended its work-
ing in other countries.
Three arguments appeared to have great
weight with lion, members during the recent
debate on the Education Bill.
1. That it is not the duty of the State to
provide Free Education.
2. That to introduce a system of Free Edu-
cation would be to destroy the
sense of responsibility in the parent,
and cause him to take less interest
in the education of his children ;
and,
3. That the system would foster a spirit
of pauperism in parent and child
The first argument owes its force to the
manner in which it is stated—the word
‘ • duty ” leading the debater aside from a
consideration of the real question at issue,
viz. : whether it would be “wisdom” on
the part of the State to provide Free Educa-
tion, and it is in their bearing upon this
point that arguments 2 and 3 are worth con-
sideration.
Dealing with the arguments in the order
in which they are stated above, I would
urge :
1. That when the State makes education
compulsory, insists upon a child being sent
to school, and punishes the parent for non-
compliance with its mandate, it assumes
parental control over the child in so far as it
overrides the wishes and intentions of the
father, and takes upon itself the responsibility
which that father fails to discharge.
Having done so much it is surely illogical
upon the face of it for a State to throw
obstacles in the way of the application of a
principle which it has decided to act upon.
And yet this is exactly what the State does
when it makes education compulsory without
making it free. It cannot be denied that the
enforcement of fees offers serious obstacles to
the application of the principle of compulsory
education, and it goes without saying that
the abolition of fees would reduce the
necessity of compulsion to a minimum.
Unless education is made free as well as
compulsory, the State actually does that for
which it punishes the parent : it places a
stumbling-block in the way of the child’s
education.
To what extent education should be made
free is altogether another question. It is a
debateable point whether the responsibility
of the State should extend beyond teaching
“the three R’s.” Confining its responsi-
bility to providing compulsory elementary
education, the State would leave little room
for objections against education being made
free as well as compulsory. I do not say
that the State should have nothing to do
with a “ higher system of education.” On
the contrary, I think that Government should
establish technical and other schools for the
benefit of those who are only partly in a
position to acquire the education which they
are fitted to receive, and which is necessary
to qualify them for their true and proper
positions in after life. But Ido say that in
so far as education is made compulsory, to
that extent should it be made free.
2. Does the application of a system of
Free Education as a matter of fact tend to
make parents take less interest in the educa-
tion of their children ?
At the outset it may very safely be as-
serted that the parent who values education
is not likely to value it less if it is free;
while the parent who undervalues education
is not likely to think more of it if he is taxed
to support it by being made to pay fees. It
will be the policy of the latter to evade the
law, if possible, and to keep his child from
school as often as he can. Fees, in fact,
may be regarded in one sense as a tax upon
attendance. But let us put argument No. 2
to the test of experience.
When Bishop Frazer visited the United
States some years ago rate-bills for the sup-
port of education were in vogue in New
York State, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode
Island, and Michigan, but in New York the
agitation against rate-bills was at its height,
and in 1871 the rate-bill was abolished
throughout the Union, and the schools made
wholly free The result was soon seen in the




the parent, but dignifies the school in the
esteem of the pupils, and quickens the
educational spirit of the whole people. Every
taxpayer having contributed his share to the
support of the schools naturally looks after
this investment. Such was our theory,
and now we say such is the fact. Each school
register has two blank pages for the records
of visits of school officers, parents, and others.
These records show a great increase in the
number of visits to our schools. The united
testimony of teachers and school officers
affirms the quickened sympathy and zeal of
parents.”
“But, on the other hand, it has been
abundantly proved that the custom of
demanding school fees and remitting them in
special cases does produce a sense of
degradation. A former Superintendent of
New York State says: ‘ Among other
obstacles to be encountered is the reluctance
of many parents to participate in the benefits
afforded by exemptions, owing to the manner
in which this bounty, as they call it, is
bestowed. They will not send their children
to the schools to be reproached for their
poverty, and assailed with taunts that they
are educated at the expense of their more
fortunate neighbours.’ As long ago as 1845
the County Superintendent of Tenesee (X. Y.)
said: ‘ There are children in the State, and we
have reason to believe in almost every
county in the State, who do not attend any
school, for the very obvious reason that their
parents have not the means to pay their rate-
bill ; and the self-respect and pride of these
parents forbid that they should be exonerated
from such payment by the trustees.’
Governor Clark, in a message to the Legisla-
ture in 1856, proved, from the returns sent to
the Superintendent’s Department that a very
large number of children were kept out of
school on account of ‘ the repugnance on the
part of parents to avail themselves of their
privilage to educate their children in forma
pauperis as a district charge.’” Bishop
Fraser gives similar testimony.
Let me, in conclusion express an opinion
that our present system is far more cal-
culated to foster a pauper spirit than
Free Education would be. Class distinctions
are now induced, and those who pay fees
look down upon those who cannot pay, and
regard them as the charity boys and girls of
the schools.
After all, it is not so much the feelings of
the parents which have to be considered, but
rather which system of education is best
calculated to carry out the intention of the
Legislature in the provision which it makes
for public education ; and surely that system
must be the best which offers fewest obstacles
to the realisation of that intention.
Under the present system not only are
many parents discouraged from sending their
children to school, but an inducement is
held out to teachers to pay attention to one
class of children at the expense of another
class —the class that does not pay.
I think, under due limitations as to the
extent to which education should be given
in our primary schools, the free system
of education is the system which would be
found to work best in Tasmania.
