LIFE IN THE
DENS,; KENS, AND SLUMS OF LONDON.
This is the age of great cities, both ancient and modern, for
many old cities haye been found full of wonders after having
been lost amid the wreck and dust of ages. Famous old London
has been the scene of many great events. It was formerly en-
closed with gates and walls, some of which remain. It is now
the largest and richest city in the world. It contains nearly three
million souls. Its merchants are princes; it is the mighty pulse of
avast empire beating with life-tbe glorious metropolis of our noble
Queen Victoria on whose realms the sun never sets ! long may
she live, and happy may she bo! London has been ravaged by
plague, fire, and war; in it have been seen many splendid pageants
and sights?mailed kings, barons, and knights, have met in fight
and tournament before monarchs and England?s fair noble dames*
From it mighty hosts and knights templar have marched to war;
and captive kings and nobles have been led through it in triumph.
London contains many fine buildings, both old and modern, chief
among which are the Mint, on Tower-hill, where coin is made; it
has wonderful means, machinery, and wealth for this purpose. The
Koyal Exchange is a noble pile, where much business is transacted.
The Bank of England contains untold wealth?gold and silver
are heaped up in it like stones and dust; its business is enor-
mous ; its machinery for making banknotes, &c., is matchless;
and it is a magnificent pile. The Mansion House, where the Lord
Mayor holds his Court, is a fine structure. Guildhall is a vast
range of gorgeous and splendidly embellished buildings, where
all the great and grand civic entertainments are held. St. Paul?s
Cathedral is a vast edifice, full of tombs, statues, obelisks, and
sculptures, sacred to England?s mighty dead. It has a whispering
gallery, and a grand organ. As we leave the city we pass through
the old gates of Temple Bar. At Charing Cross, once Charing
Village, is Trafalgar-square, with great Nelson?s statue and
fountains. Here also stands the National Gallery, filled with
fine pictures. Nearer the river Thames stand Westminster
Abbey, Henry the Seventh?s Chapel, and the New Houses of
Parliament, all noble piles. We have not space to refer to the
British Museum, a vast pile of buildings, filled with wonders
from Nineveh, Babylon, Pompei, and Herculaneum. It also
contains Egyptian mummies, minerals, mammalia, insects.


statues, ancient records, books, and other marvels, from all
parts of the globe, too numerous to mention. The Tower of London
is a very large and strongly fortified place. As we enter its outer
gates we perceive men clad in strange attire; these are called
beefeaters. The Tower is surrounded by a moat ; as we cross
it and pass under one of its massive gates we behold the old
portcullis suspended above us, once intended to invaders.
But we have not time to visit its interior. There are oldjchambers
in it containing instruments of torture and death. There are
also the crown jewels and other regalia exhibited. There is a
large stand of arms, an armoury, and a very strong garrison.
The Tower has been the theatre of events and crimes. The New
Coal Exchange is a splendid building, beautifully adorned ; oppo-
site which is new Billingsgate Market, far surpassing old Billings-
gate, with which many old ladies nicknamed ?fishwomen?are allied,
who, smoking short pipes and clad in strange dress, carried fish
to and from market j they also kept fish-stalls in the streets, and
were as a class notorious for profanity, ignorance, and intempe-
rance. Peace, aye, peace to your manes, ye fair old English
dames!
I now desire you to visit with me the Dens, Kens, and
Slums of London. These are found in its low and poor dis-
tricts ?Petticoat Lane, Rag Fair, &c. In these places fairs were
held for the sale and exchange of old clothes, Wapping, Rat-
cliff Highway, and Spitalfields have each their dens and kens.
Saffron Hill was notorious for its dens and kens. The old house
in West Street is famous in history, where concealed property
and plunder has been found, where many robberies and murders
have been committed. The old Fleet Ditch it is believed received
the dead bodies of many murdered victims, which sunk in the
river Thames, or floating out to sea sank down to the bottom of
the ocean. Among other places I may mention as famous for
their dens and kens is the Seven Dials, where seven roads meet,
and where strangers can be more easily lost than in the bush.
St. Giles?s is famous for its Rookery, but upon its site a baptist
chapel has long stood, of which General Havelock, the good and
the brave, was a member. There is also Kent Street and the
Mint, in the Borough. Of the latter place I shall speak more
fully. The Mint, as its name implies, was formerly the place
where the coin of the realm was made. It was once enclosed by
gates, and was then the fashionable part of London, where the
nobility and gentry resided. When I first visited the Mint an
old palace existed; but the Mint at length became greatly
changed??the gold became dim, and the most line gold tar-
nished.? It was infested with thieves. Here I have visited the
house of Jack Shepherd, the housebreaker. This and other
houses had various doors of ingress and egress, and cellars with
secret trap doors, for plunder. The Mint was formerly badly


pared and lighted, a safe retreat for thieres, especially in the
days of the old watchmen, alias the Old. Charlies, a class of
worthies not quite forgotten, whose venerable and weather-
beaten forms I yet behold, dressed in their great coats and slouch
hats, with their old red-nosed faces nearly buried in their neck-
erchiefs and comforters, armed with a formidable staff and a
great rattle capable of awaking and alarming a whole community.
Shades of departed greatness, methinks I see ye still sitting, or
hear ye snoring, in your dismal old watch-boxes! Methinks I
see your aged terms tottering along the streets now, shedding a
dim light from your broken horn lanterns as ye go. I hear again
your hoarse voices crying ? All?s well,? or bawling the hour of
the night or morning, and the state of the weather, Farewell
ye ancients, no more the sport of the youth, the sot, the de-
bauchee, the thief. Your race is run, and we could not but
eulogise the deeds of the poor old Charlies, Many of the large
houses in the Mint at length became the abode of the vile, being
converted into low dens of infamy, of which there were more
than thirty, some having a hundred lodgers. The charge to
lodge in these dens varied from 2d. to 6d. per night. But in
very few of them was there either comfort or order. Most of
them had kitchens to which all the lodgers had free access.
Here there was usually kept a fire and cooking utensils. In some
of the largest dens a deputy was kept who had charge of the house.
Many of the owners of these dens have in a short time made large
fortunes and retired; and I have myself met some of the owners
of these dens at fashionable watering-places on the English coast.
Many of these dens were badly drained and ventilated, miserably
furnished, and many were filthy in the extreme ; vice, like the
hydra-headed monster, reigning rampant in all. Not twenty
persons in the Mint attended divine service on the Sabbath.
Most persons were drunken, immoral, and profane. I have
myself seen great wickedness in the Mint. On the Lord?s Day
quarrels and fights in the street, and robberies were frequent, and
shouts of murder often broke the silence of the night. On
entering one of these dens and casting your eyes around the moral
darkness it was only to discover sights of woe, and candidates
for those regions of darkness and doleful shades the poet Milton
so fearfully describes. Such a motley group would baffle the
pencil of an Hogarth or Lawrance to portray. Thieves, linguists,
debauchees, beggars and others, were found mending clothes,
shoes, &c., singing, quarrelling, and fighting ; some were washing
and ironing, others smoking and drinking. What a Babel, making
confusion worse confounded! What a tide of misery, what a surge
of guilt, is ever heaving and overflowing from that ragged, shoeless,
and stockingless host. An angry sea of endless life seems ready to
rush out of those frail bodies, as if time was not bearing them on
fast enough to the vast ocean of eternity. What crime, what


talent, what power, what elements o ruin are centred here. May
God control, convert, and save such. But among all the various
forms, features, and dress of that motley group, behold that
youth without stockings or shoes, with an old cap on his head
through which his hair is seen. Observe his laughing eye, his
saucy jaunting air, his swaggering gait, his impudent leer?as
much as to say in the language of looks, ? I know all about it,
I?m no novice m the school of vice. I am an adept at my trade.?
See, he has a broom in his hand, for he is a crossing-sweeper, one
of a class of persons who sweep a clean path for themselves and
others. Persons of this class usually obtain a good living, in-
deed fortunes have been made by members of this dirty profession,
and good crossings have when sold realised large sums. A
crossing sweeper, a civil youth, whose good conduct attracted the
notice of some Clerks of one of the Inns of Courts in London,
was taught by them to read and write, and the poor deformed
and before friendless outcast did not rest satisfied ?he had a soul,
a mind, a mighty principle within?he became a clerk, a solicitor,
a barrister, a wig adorned his head, a gown covered his deformed
body, and his hands that once handled a broom now handled a
brief. Did he rest there ? No j he had a noble soul 5 his motto
was that of every true patriot, Christian, philanthropist, and
student, ?upward and onward.? He had set nis mark, he aimed
at it, he reached it, the goal of his ambition, he obtained the
prize, he attained the summit of the lofty mount, and on the
tribunal he sat as a Judge. He dispensed justice from that
eminence to show to us that the way is open to many to achieve
noble deeds. Doubtless he often looked back upon the difficult
path he had trod; he thought of the miry clay. But the days
of want, woe, rags, sorrow, and shame, were past. He found
the promise true, ? God raiseth the beggar from the dunghill to
set him among princes.? Let your aim, then, be high }? he
builds too low who builds beneath the skies,? Struggle forward,
look upward, in the path of duty, of piety, of virtue, of in-
dustry. Behold the prize, the glory, the rapture, the crown, the
harp, the song, a present heaven, life now, eternal life in Christ by
faith. But there is also a downward road. I knew a well-bred
lady who once rode in her carriage, but who, falling from the
path of virtue, sank down step by step untill she became a
crossing-sweeper, an abandoned and wretched outcast, a polluted
and polluting creature. The path of sin is downward. Take
heed young man, be careful; oh be watchful young female of
sin; avoid temptation, shun evil society, beware of the cup of
sin, it appears to be of pure gold, flowing with nectar ; it pro*
mises hfe?the devil who holds it as an angel of light says
" drink, oh drink.? Ye young, believe him not, he is a liar; he
holds the cup of death, it is full of poison, deadly character-
ruining, soul-destroying poison. When be tells you of th?


pleasures of sin, when he paints the path of guilt as a pleasant
path, strewn with flowers and fruits, believe it not ?they are
apples of Sodom and grapes of G-ommorrah; when he tells you
to drink of the guilty streams of youthful pleasure shun the
whispers of the vile seducer. Then think of the guilty, wretched,
and abandoned outcasts, who were as virtuous, as pure, as happy
as you, and now how fallen, how changed, how miserable, Be-
member that ? the wages of sin is death,? its service a cursed
lingering, slavish, cruel'service; and sin is the vilest monster in
the universe, though decked with flowers, though painted fair
and youthful. Flee from sin and temptation as from a viper,
and shun, oh shun, I entreat you, I implore you, the intoxicating
cup. It is a flend; afterwards it biteth like a serpent and
stingeth like an adder. In one of these dens lived a man who
once rode in his carriage, but was afterwards through poverty
obliged to sell baked potatoes in the streets for bread. In other
dens I have met with linguists, ruined spendthrifts, and persons
who once moved in high stations. In others I have seen beggars
gambling for large sums, others writing begging letters, others
training children to vice. I once found several boys in what
might justly be termed the thief?s training establishment, where
they receive instructions to thieve. One of the modes adopted
is, an adult thief puts on a woman?s dress with a bell or small
coin in the pocket of the gown, and the thief that can extract the
coin without ringing the bell is then employed professionally to
rob tills and pick pockets. How thankful should South Austra-
lians be that there are no thief training schools here, but an
earnest desire is manifested, and efforts made, both by the Legis-
lature, the Educational Board, and by others, to impart a sound,
useful, Christian education, on a broad basis that ? knowledge is
power,? and that the soul be without it is not good. The houses to
which plunder is taken are called fences, their real character
being concealed. I knew two owners of such houses who were
both barbers. Other houses of bad character are concealed by
whatever means are available. In others wicked females called
procuresses entrap the unwary, who are often ruined. But I
have by Clod?s blessing induced females to leave vile houses, have
put them in asylums, restored them to their friends and homes,
and they have again become good members of society. In one
low house I found several girls in one room; on talking to them
one began to weep, and said she had received pious instruction.
The others then began to rail at her. I gave them tracts, which
were afterwards thrown down stairs. But the same night the
girl who wept sold her clothes and spent the money in gin. She
felt then ?
Sin?s shame but history,
Judgment a mystery,
.Quite maddened with woe
She shrank not to go


To death and the grave!
No friend near to save,
Wildly shrieking did leap
In the dark chilly deep.
At midnight, I heard, she threw herself off London Bridge into
the Kiver Thames, where she was found a lifeless corpse. Let
the vile seducers of female innocence beware, ? There is a' God
that judgeth in the earth,? ?when he maketh inquisition for
blood he remembereth them.? But does the poor victim fall
alone. No! the parents and friends often come to an early grave
also. But, alas, I have known keen poverty drive virtuous
females whose kindred were starving to detested vice. They
have often been brought in London by sin and want to an early
grave, and their proper epitaph would be,? Died from starvation.?
1 once visited a poor widow, a seamstress, with a large family,
who received only 4s. for making six garments covered with
most costly lace. Yes, only Bd. each. These garments were
made for a duchess, who paid fifty guineas for them. Here it ye
females, and let it echo through the higher walks of life, in
palaces and halls, until the death-knell of unrequited toil is rung
out through an emancipated and free earth, till' men grasp each
other s hands, saying?we are one kindred. Hear it ye females of
Australia, and be grateful that ? the lines have fallen to you in
pleasant places,? for you have a goodly heritage ; but remember
that in England females tenderly reared, educated, and sensitive,
toil from morn till dewy eve for a miserable pittance. I have
known them make shirts for fd. each, and find the cotton;
others for Id,, and IJd. each. I have visited them in their
poverty and misery, their bony fingers plying their busy needles
in their cold, cheerless, fireless garrets and dark cellars; and I
have heard their dirty, neglected, starving children cry for bread.
Do not think it an overdrawn picture, it is alas too true. I have
called to see them after a time; the reply has been ? Gone.?
? Gone where P? ? Taken to the Union, Sir, and died.? I have
ruminated, gone, where ? to a pauper?s grave ! gone, the victim
of unrequited toil! About single female seamstresses I have
asked, ?Gone where?? gone?in a whisper?gone to swell the
ranks of those who lived a wretched life, and often died a horrid
death, who rush by suicide, uncalled for, and unprepared, into
the awful presence of an angry God!
THE WIDOWED SEAMSTRESS,
? 0, mother, mother, give me bread,?
A dying child in anguish said.
?I would my dear, my darling son.
But cannot till this work is done.?
? Oh mother, mother, do not weep,
My hunger?s gone, I want to sleep;
Mother, I would, but cannot cry,
Parched is my tongue, and dim my eye.


?Mother, you look so wan and worn.
And oh, this garret seems forlorn!
Come, kiss me, mother, ?ere I die.
And meet me soon in yonder sky.?
The mother tottered to his bed;
But ah ! his gentle soul bad fled
Far from the|reach of woe and pain,
Where he shall never want again.
She clasped him in a cold embrace.
Kissed his pale lips and angel face;
Muttered his name in accents wild,
Then fell a corpse upon her child!
Footsteps are heard, and cries of bread !
Mother ! ah, hapless ones, she?s dead ;
No light, no fire, no?death is here.
And want has killed your mother dear.
The children shriek, pale with affright.
The alarm. O, that heart-piercing sight.
Both dead, alas! too late to save.
They rest now in a pauper?s grave.
Most of these dens had dismal lamps burning in front of them
at night. I preached often at one, and I shall not soon forget
the place or congregation. When I entered the owner or deputy
usually came and ordered silence, when all work was suspended.
But sometimes new comers, not knowing the rules, would inter-
rupt. On one occasion a new comer contradicted the preacher
when an old lodger named Mother Eagg knocked her down.
I had of course to stop until order was restored. But sometimes
I met with difficulties in ascending and descending staircases?a
projecting beam in the dark would knock in my hat, or a stair
was gone. I once came down an almost perpendicular staircase
upon my back instead of my feet. While visiting an old man
on one occasion an old lady came in, whom the old man led
across the room. ?Is she blind ? ** O yes, sir. 1 1 Wus false 3
she was not, but pretended to be so. She stood daily in the
Borough, with her hands held very modestly out for alms. She is a
sham, one of the many shams of London. A pretending deaf
and dumb man was suspected not to be so ; a person went up to
him and said, ?Pray how long have you been deaf and dumb??
He replied ?-Sixteen years, sir.? I have often seen the wretched
outcasts who prowl about London as beggars who impose upon
the public, some sitting before writing in chalk on the pavement,
? I?m starving, I?m hungry,? others with patches and bandages,
others with crutches and wooden legs, some with their arms in
splinters ; these badges of deception being thrown off when
they arrive at home, where they eat and drink to excess. There
were shops in the Mint where they could obtain every luxury,
from a halfpennyworth of tea, sugar, or anything else. I have
seen the wretched mendicants getting drunk at the boozing kens,
alias the gin-palaces, which after the day?s begging were usually
filled with them. These kens had most of them a fine. glass


lamp over the door, plate-glass windows, and were splendidly
furnished. In some a concert or low gaff was held, where the
before lame beggars were to be seen capering on the light fan-
tastic toe. I have seen great disorder in some of these houses,
and much quarrelling and fighting. Some of these dens were
tenanted by swellmobmen, alias Knobblers, who were generally
very fashionably dressed. There is a class in London called
translators, not being skilled in learned lore, but in translating
new boots and shoes out of old ones. These were generally very
intemperate and depraved. In one shop six of them had only
one decent coat among them. On visiting another, who lived up
stairs, I saw on either side of the door a questionable shape, two
large cans of hogwash, which sent forth a noisome smell, while
in the room it required great care to avoid annoyance and con-
tamination. This man was a deist. He told me had once heard
a minister preach on bodies j he said there were three kinds of
bodies?celeschal, trestrall, and south trestrall. This I ques-
tioned, but he said he knew he was right. He knew when the
Scriptures were translated into English?in the time of Wat
Tyler, when the devil and Dr. Fauster lived. I have visited and
seen some joyful and some dreadful deaths. One was that of
a pious woman, who died very happy, of whom it might be said
and of otners?
Hark! she sings of yon pure rest
Where her husband reigneth blest.
0, ray children dear, adien,
1. alas, must part from you!
Some have died in an awful state of sin. One old lady died
drunk, while singing a song. A man who had never slept in a
bed for fifteen yei rs was killed while drunk. I have seen awful
cases of ignorance, depravity, and vice. A minister, a friend of
mine, was sent for by a dying man ; the man said, '? Make haste
and pray for me, for I?m going to hop the twig (to die)!? In
one case I visited a pugilist who seemed awfully afraid to die;
At night he lay upon his bed,
With raving anguish tost ?
He gnashed bis teeth, and seemed to dread
To land on death?s dark coast.
His scorn of death proved then to be
Bat a mere empty boast.
But even in these dark regions good has been done. By the
labours of the Earl of Shaftesbury and others the new Lodging
House Act has been for some time in effective operation, and to
some extent order, cleanliness, and, comfort have been introduced
into these before wretched sinks of vice. Many of the old dens in
the Mint have been removed. A new Kagged Day and Sabbath
School, a new place of worship, a library, and a penny bank,
have been established; several model lodging houses have also
been opened in various parts. And I trust every coast will soon
have lighthouses and lifeboats, and every city its fire-escapes, to


?are life; and also washhouses and baths filled with fresh and
salt water, conveyed at but a small cost from the sea, which last
would not only be a luxury to invalids and others, but might
also be used as a reservoir to extinguish fires?a project which is
now under the consideration of Lord Shaftesbury in London.
In bidding adieu to London, where good and evil, joy and
woe, toil and ease, wealth and want, exist in such great contrast,
we remark that much has been done to improve and raise the
masses; the lamp of Truth giving the light of Life, has shone in
the garret, the cellar, the ragged school, the prison, the union, as
well as in abbeys, churches, and chapels, alleys and lanes, where
many publish the Word of Life. And having spoken of cities,
let me remind you that there is a city whose builder is Q-od; its
walls are jasper, its ?gates pearls, its streets gold, its walls are
garnished with all manner of precious stones ; it is the dwelling
place of Deity, of angels, and redeemed spirits. Wishing that
you, beloved reader, may be a denizen of that bright, sinless,
sightless city, and spend your eternity amid its purity, felicity,
and glory, I shall close with a few lines ?odes to Liberty and
the Admella: ?
ODE TO LIBERTY.
Hai), Liberty! fair child of light!
We see thee rising in thy might;
Thy chariot wheels are heard afar,
Amid the awful din of war.
Go forth all radiant like the morn,
Let matchless grace thine head adorn;
Ungird thy sword from off thy thigh,
And raise thy mighty voice on high.;
Now bid the down-trod nations rise.
Proclaim the truth, tilijerror dies;
Through the wide earth let man be free.
And prove thy charms, fair Liberty!
Patriots, 'gainst tyrants fight your way,
Now march and conquer, win the day I
Let Liberty victorious stand;
God bless our Queen and native land!
THE ADMELLA ODE.
Weep for lost loved ones, weep,
Who perished in the deep?;
The young, the fair, the brave.
Sank in one common grave.
The noble cabin boy
With Harris sought to buoy
Others, but ah, they died.
With more our joy and pride.
Joy with the saved, the saved
For whom God?s help was craved !
Laud high the bold and brave.
Who did them nobly save.
To God an anthem raise,
To whom be highest praise;
Write each bold hero?s name
On the bright scroll of lame.
