Long ago there lived a little
Girl, whose name was Lulu.
She had blue eyes and curly,
brown hair, which her friend,
the Wind, loved to blow about
her bright little face.
Lulu was very happy, for
had she not all that heart could
desire ? Her home was a dear
little home, with lots of green
lawn, and flowers, and trees.
under which she used to play on sunny days
You could never count all the toys and
play-things that Lulu had. But there was


one thine she loved above all the rest. It
was not a doll, or a set of tea-cups either.
It was
H %owq> White pipe,
which her mother had given her, to make
bubbles with.
She loved making bubbles out of the
soapy water which she kept in an
Qf ©lb Kyohcn tTea=cup.
And the Wind, as he came singing through
the trees, used to catch up the bubbles, and
puff them over the fence, and across the
green fields. What became of them Lulu
could not think, but she wished very much
to know what the Wind did with them.

dream, until, at last, she made up her
mind that she would go and seek this
Ikmobom Be\>onb the Sea,
where the Red Suns sank to sleep,
Jn the Jslanb of Ipalms.
Well, one day she took her Long Clay
Pipe and her Old Broken Tea-cup, and,
sitting down under a tree, she drew a long
breath, and began to blow, gently and
steadily, through the dear old Pipe.
The bubble grew and grew, until it seemed
larger than the moon. It was the biggest
bubble Lulu had ever blown, and lovelier
than anything in the whole world.
Then the Wind came out of the woods,
brushing the leaves as he came. His cheeks
were puffed out, in a way that he had when
he felt very jolly, and he wore a sea-green
cloak and a crown of wild roses.


Cben tbe 'Ulllnb
Came out of tbe “Moobs.
He smiled at Lulu, and touched the
Bubble with his Wand, which was made of
shells and sea-foam. Lightly he flung it into


the air, where it floated and hung, like a
Star
that had been dipped in a
IRainbow,
Then the Wind puffed out his cheeks
more and more, and blew upon the Bubble,
and it sailed slowly away. And the Wind
leapt over the hedge, and went fluting gaily
down the valley, shaking the spiders on their
webs, and the little birdies in their nests.
But Lulu looked only at the Bubble. She
saw the Sun laughing and sparkling m it,
and she heard, as plainly as could be, a
singing in the air, which seemed to say :
O little lady, Fm the Wind,
That rumples all your hair;
I know where all the bubbles go,
Fve come to take you there.


They're up above the silver gums,
They're underneath the Sea,
And FII show you ever/ one of them,
If you will follow me.
IVe put one on the Emu's head:
He thinks it is a hat;
I fastened one to Tiny's tail,
I broke one on the Cat.
I gave the very pretty ones
To fairies over sea,
And I'll show you what they've done with
them,
If you will follow me.
So Lulu, with her Long Clay Pipe and
her Old Broken Tea-cup, ran to the
wicket gate, which the Wind had set
ajar. Before her was the bubble,
gleaming with a thousand lights, and as
she gazed, it grew and grew, until it
became a


palace of Xlght
with a Hundred Shining Windows and a
Door carved out of Foam, with Knobs of
Gold and Pearl.
At each shining window, she saw a tiny
Fairy Face, and each face was a-glow with
smiles, and tiny hands were waved to her ;
and the air was full of little voices, singing:
O come and be our Fairy Queen,
You’ll have a crown of gold to wear,
You’ll have a gown with silken sheen,
And strings of rubies in your hair.
The Palace floated softly down, until it
seemed to rest on the heads of the dandelions
and the clover flowers. And then the door,
with knobs of gold and pearl, opened wide,
and a burst of sweet song fell on Lulu’s ears.
She waited no longer, but boldly went up
the steps, and into the Great Hall, the floor
of which was paved with rubies and diamonds.

As she went in, Fairy Maids, on either side,
bowed low, as though a great Queen were
entering.
Another door opened, and Lulu stood in
a large room—the Room of the Twenty
Shining Windows.
Hither came other
Fairy Maidens to
robe the Queen. One
brought a pair of slippers, with buckles of
silver and gold. She kneeled, and placed the


slippers on Lulu’s feet, and Lulu, looking
down, saw that they were set with wms, that
glistened like beads of dew on sunny mornings.
Another brought a golden bowl, filled with
pure water, with which she washed Lulu’s
hands and face ; another a golden comb and
brush, with which she dressed Lulu’s brown
hair. Others took off her home clothes, and
clad her in robes of Fairy Land.
J
Zbc fairies’
Sonci,
When they had made[an end of dressing her,
they put a sceptre m her hand, and a crown


of gold upon her head, and, kneeling down,
they lifted up their sweet voices, and sang :
Bow to the Queen of the Fairy Isles,
Who lives in the House of Happy Smiles,
That's built of the bricks of Good Intentions,
And filled with the things of Quaint Inventions;
That's served by the servants Yes and Please,
And kept by the warders Joy and Ease;
Bow to the Queen of the Fairy Isles,
Who lives in the House of Happy Smiles.
And after that, they led her to another room,
where each Shining Window was a Picture.
In the midst of it was a little Table, covered
with a snow-white cloth, and before the table
was a quaintly carven
3voxs> Chair,
and all about the walls were Mirrors, in
which Lulu could see herself and the Pictures
of the Shining Windows.


And when the Fairy Maidens had left
her, she ran and peeped through the Shining
Windows, one after one, and through one of
them she thought she saw
o
tbc Mint*,
laughing at her, and puffing out his jolly
cheeks; but he was gone in a moment.
Then Lulu stood before a mirror, and, as
she looked at herself, she smiled and smiled,
and thought it was good to be a Queen,
and live in a Palace of Light, and have a
hundred Fairy Maids to wait upon her.
Having gazed at her own fair image,
she went and sat in the Ivory Chair, and
put her feet upon the Velvet Footstool. On
the table was a Silver Bell, which looked
so pretty that Lulu could not but touch it.
It made the sweetest chiming that she had
c>
ever heard.


At once, there entered a dozen Fairy
Maidens, each bearing a dainty silver dish,
in which were all the nicest things to eat
that one could think of—such cakes and
dainties as only Fairy Land can show.
Lulu was very hungry, and she did not stop
till she had gone through all the courses.
Then she dipped her fingers in the Golden
Bowl, and dried them on a Silken Napkin,
and leaned back in her Chair, feeling very
happy indeed.
At last she thought she would like to see
all the rooms in her Palace. So she rang
the Silver Bell again, and straightway all
the Fairy Maidens trooped in, and curtseyed
low, and the chief one of them all said :
“ Will it please your Highness to follow ? ”
Lulu rose, and she looked like a Queen
indeed. From room to room she passed,
up-stairs and down-stairs, and each room

seemed lovelier than the last. But the one
she liked best was the bed-room set apart
for her. It had a sweet little bed in it,
and the floors were strewn with the softest

was a Window,

which she could

finest lace in Fairy Land. She sat
before a fire of Sunbeams, that a great
Enchanter had placed in the heart of a
Diamond ; and whilst she so sat, one Fairy
combed her hair with the Golden Comb, and
another played on a Harp with golden strings.
" By what path must we go to win to the
Island of Palms and the Kingdom beyond
the Sea ?*' asked Lulu, for she knew that the
Palace was floating through the air, and she
was sure that It was bound for the Island of
Palms, and no where else.
And a Fairy who read out of a Great
Book, and was very wise, arose, and made
answer ,
First must we go by the Path of the
Stars, and then by the Bridge of the
Rainbow, and then by the Highway of
the Clouds, and, last of all, by the Street
of Fire that leads to the Island of


palms, where the IRch Suns Sinh

“ Even now,” she went on, i( are we

On hearing this, Lulu went and stood in
the Balcony. She looked down on the
Valley, which was filled with darkness, save
for lights that twinkled here and there like
bright pin-heads.
Then she saw that the Palace moved ever
upward and upward, along the curve of a
dark mountain, shaggy with woods, where the
beasts roared, and Giants called one to
another ; and beyond that, in the Blue-black
Dome of the Sky, lay the Path of the Stars,
the very dust of which shone like powdered
Suns.
Lulu threw kisses down to the Valley, where
her happy home lay in the depths of the

for Daddy, and a third for Auntie. Then

she lay down upon the little bed, and folded
her hands to sleep. But, before she fell
asleep, she heard voices singing from Star to

saw the eyes of
J
God, loving her
and watching
over her ; and
so she closed
her eyes and
slept.
When the sun
rose, she peeped out of her window, and lo !
the Palace was floating toward the Gate of the
Bribge of the TRambow*
The great Archway was decked with Sky-
flowers of every colour, and the Bridge itself
was strewn with flowers and gems, and on some
of the flowers Lulu saw drops of dew and
tiny bubbles, such as she used to blow when
first she got the long, White Clay Pipe.
And far below was the Sea, shining in the
sunlight, and upon it were many ships sailing,
and great fishes were leaping and sporting.

She slept and woke
again ; and when she
looked through the Shin-
ing Windows, she saw
great Mountains of Mist
and Cloud, piled round
about without end. Some
were white as washed wool,
and some were black as
night, and out of the heart
of their blackness came
flames, and jets of fire,
and rumblings, which
shook the Palace, and
made Lulu’s heart leap
with fear.
But the Fairy Maidens
came, and played on their
Sbe Brcb of
fibe IRatnbow.
Harps of gold, so that her fear left her, and
she even dared to stand in her Balcony,
and gaze at the wondrous Cloud World.


And when mid-noon was come, they came
to a glittering White Palace, before which,
on a great throne, sat the
iFrost Iking,
with a spear-like Sceptre in his hand, and a
Crown of Ice Crystals upon his head, and
m the midst of the Crown was set a great
Emerald. His beard reached below his
waist, and it sparkled as if many jewels were
hung therein. Out of his mouth came a cold
breath, which turned the cloud-wreaths into
stone, and made Lulu shiver, so that she
withdrew and sat down before the fire of
the Diamond.
Again she slept, and when she opened her
eyes, she saw that the Windows were glowing
with a fiery red light, and the Fairy Maidens
told her that they were now m the
Street of jfire,
which stretches West to the Island of

Palms. And Lulu was glad, for she knew
that they would soon be in the Island, and

sporting with the bubbles which she had
made with her Clay Pipe.
D own the Street of Fire glided the Palace,
until about even-tide it stopped above a great
mountain. Slowly it sank down, and stood
upon a green lawn.
Then the great door of the Palace swung
open, and Lulu, with her tram of Fairy
Maidens, came forth, and stood upon the
steps, and she saw before her the Wind, with
his jolly face wrinkled into smiles. He took
Lulu by the hand, and led her down the
steps to where his children stood, happy girls
and boys, who welcomed them with shouts
of glee, and then ran about, and made

merry with each other in the green glades.
Some played on flutes of reed, some tossed
bubbles in the air, some hung lamps of
bubbles to the leaves of the trees, and
others made ready a feast for the Queen
that had come over the Sea.
And Lulu was very happy; yet there was
one thing that frightened her and took the
laughter out of her heart. For when she
turned herself about, the Palace of Light was
no more ; it had vanished into the air, and
all the Fairy Maidens with it, and on the
place where it had stood were only the
Xono, Mbite flMpe (OBk
©lb Broken tCea=cup.
When she saw these, she dried


her tears, and put the Pipe and the Cup in
the Silken Tent, which the Wind had made
for her.
The days in that land were long and
sunny ; no clouds came, and no storms swept
across the sky. The Island was clothed with
Woods of Palms and Ferns, and many other
trees, in which beautiful birds sang and made
their nests.
And amid the Woods were paths, which
the Children of the Wind had made. One
ran to the Sea-beach, where the waves
crooned and lapped upon shells and yellow
sand, and here the Children of the Wind
were wont to bathe. Another path, which
Lulu loved most of all, ran to the
IRocfc of Seeing,
which jutted into the Sea, and from which
Lulu could look far out upon the waters.

At first the days passed like Dream Da}s,

and Lulu and the Children
of the Wind played many
games, and were ver) r happy
together. But there came
a day, when Lulu began
J 7 o
to think of the Home in
the Valiev, and of her
j 7
Mother and Daddy and
Auntie, who would miss
their little girl.
Her playmates could not
guess what made her eyes
fill with tears at times, for
they never wept in the Island
of Palms, and none there
knew what it was to be sad.
So Lulu, when sad thoughts
filled her heart, would go
alone, save for the Clay


Pipe and the Old Broken Tea-cup, to the
Rock of Seeing, and there she would sit and
blow bubbles, and dream of the dear old
Home.
She had asked the Wind to take her back,
but he shook his head, and said that none
who came to the Island could ever leave it,
saving only himself, to whom it was given to
go where he liked. And she believed him,
because the Wind was her kind friend.
One day, as she sat dreaming in a cleft of
a Rock, she started up in great fear, for
round a corner of the Rock she saw a
Strange jface,
that looked at her out of deep, dark eyes.
It was a sad, kind face, and when Lulu
looked again she ceased to fear, and even felt
some pity for the stranger with the sad,
beautiful eyes.

“ Come with me, O Earth Child,” he said

heart, knew that she must obey, and yield

“ These,' said he, “you must leave

How BUBBLES went to
the ISLAND of the
GREA T MA GICIAN.
When Bubbles knew that Lulu was still
asleep in the Castle of the Great Magician,
he was very sad, and thought no more
about the Flying Squirrel, but only of
Lulu, and how he might wake her from the
spell which the Magician had thrown over
her, and how he might bring her back to
the dear Home in the Valley.
He asked his Daddy to buy him a
Pipe,
long and white,
and he chipped a bit out of his
{ IfoUQ,


thinking a Mug would do quite as well as
an Old Broken Tea-cup. He blew hubbies
every day, but nothing came of
them. They were
nothing more. He

the Wind passed,
and made noanswer.
Perhaps he had for-
gotten about Lulu, or perhaps
the Fairies were all dead, or

to sleep for a thousand years.
It was very sad, and Bubbles’ head used
to ache with thinking how he should find
a way to the Island of the Magician. He
broke his Pipe, and threw it behind the
grate, but the Mug he kept, to put crumbs
in for the robins and sparrows, that came
every day to feed on the green.


One day he went down to the creek, and
sat upon a log, which long ago had fallen
across the stream. He was thinking of
Lulu still, and wondering why it was that
no Fairy voices ever spoke to him as they
had spoken to the girl.
Whilst he was busy with these thoughts,
he suddenly heard the
flfcew, mew!
of a Cat, that seemed in distress. He could
not see it, for there were thick bushes all
around. So he called out, “ Puss, puss,
puss!” and there crawled out of a bush
the leanest and hungriest - looking Cat
you ever saw. It
did not seem a
nice Cat, but Bub-
bles was a kind
boy, and when the

Cat came near enough, he reached out
his hand, and patted it on the head in a
very friendly manner.
The Cat mewed again, and tried to purr,
but it was a very feeble purr, that seemed to
stick in its throat.
“Stay, Puss,” said Bubbles, “and I’ll get
you some nice milk in a moment.”
He was off, and back again in no time,
with some milk in his Broken Mug.
The Cat lapped up the milk greedily,
stretched herself, purred quite loudly, and
then there happened a very strange thing
indeed. Bubbles was just going to stroke
Pussy’s neck, when lo ! the Cat was hidden
in a wreath of blue mist, and out of the mist
there stepped a

I remained so, till your kind heart took pity

But the Stone was in his hand, glowing
with warm, golden light : that, at least,
was no dream.
He looked up at the
flfcountam,
which seemed to touch the sky, and he
thought that this must be the Mountain by
which Lulu reached the
path of tbe Stars*


I WTT"

So, putting the Magic Stone
in his bosom, he began to
climb the face of the Moun-
tain.
lt was steep and rocky,
and the bushes were full of
thorns, which scratched his
legs, his hands, and his face.
He had gone but a little
way, when his shoes were
torn to pieces. He was
very hot and thirsty, too,
and nowhere could he find
a drop of water to drink.
His courage began to fail
him, and he was minded
to turn back. The crest
of the Mountain frowned
far above him, and his feet
were weary and torn. He thought of the


Magic Stone, but the Princess had told
him that he must only use it when a
great danger threatened him.
He sat down on a stone to think, and he
was so busy with his thoughts that he did
not see a
Curious Hnimal,
that hopped round a rock and sat looking
at him. It had a long tail, and was covered
with soft fur, and it had gentle brown eyes.
It came nearer and nearer, until it touched
the boy’s elbow. Bubbles stood up and
cried out, and would have run away ; but
he was very weary, and when he looked
again, he saw that the animal was very gentle
and tame, and that its eyes were the friend-
liest eyes in the world.
It rolled itself about, too, and made such
funny signs with its paws, that Bubbles


began to laugh at its antics. He was no
longer afraid now, and by and by he
thought what a nice gee-gee it would make.
So, without more ado, he climbed upon
its back ; and the animal seemed very
pleased, as if it had been wanting that all
along.
No sooner, indeed, was Bubbles firmly
fixed on its back, than it started
off, hopping and leaping,
up the Mountain.
It never stopped,
except to let Bubbles
drink at a spring which
oozed out of a rock.
In a short time it stood on the
very top of the Mountain, and
when Bubbles got off, it scampered
hubbies raises away, and was out of sight in a
up tbe /Iftountafn.
moment.


'OClooO of
tbe animals.




When Bubbles looked around, he beheld
a great Wood before him, and he knew that
this must be the Wood of the Animals,
whereof the Princess had told him. It was
dark and gloomy, and strange roarings and
mutterings fell upon his ears. The Sun was
fast hasting to his rest beyond the Sea, and
(Breat Black Blrbs
came flocking to the Wood, screeching and
cawing, in a way that made Bubbles tremble
with fear.
The shadows of the Wood lengthened out,
and closed about him. He was all alone,
save for a
Xlttle IBivb
that flew out of a bush, and hopped and
played before him, sometimes fluttering up to
his feet, and sometimes flying away a short
distance. Bubbles began to follow it, pleased


by its gambols, and feeling sure that such a
pretty thing could mean him no harm.
Soon it was joined by other birds of the
same kind, which chirped and hopped and
flew with great glee, until it reached a glade
by the edge of the Wood, where Bubbles
saw a dear little
Ibouse,
made of twigs and leaves, and in it he saw
a little feather bed, and by the bed a mug of
milk and a little loaf of bread. Whilst he
was drinking the milk and eating the bread,
the Birds danced in their
Bandno Iball,
in a way that was delightful to see, and when
he lay down on the feather bed, they
covered him over with leaves. And so he
fell asleep, and did not wake until the Sun
was high in the sky.


Sbc jStrbs
Entertain
The Birds had been up long before, and
stood round waiting for Bubbles to open his
eyes. Then they began to sing and dance
again, and one of them brought him
H pair of Shoes,
which fitted him as if they had been made
for him by the cleverest shoemaker in the
world.


And when lie had drunk some more milk,
and eaten some more bread, and some wild
berries, which the Birds brought to him in
the hollow of a large leaf, he took his leave of
them, and set out again, tor he knew he
must waste no time in getting through the
Wood of the Animals.
So, although his heart beat loudly, he
plunged into the Wood, where it was dark
and cold, and where there were strange
shadows and sounds, that made him start
at every step.
He had gone but a little distance, when
the path, if such it could be called, sloped
down into a
Dailey
where he saw what made him shiver with
fright. For the Valley was the terrible
Dailey of the Serpents,


Cbc Dalles of
tbc Serpents.
Whichever way he
looked were thousands of
these dreadful creatures.
They hung in loops from
the branches, they coiled
round the trees, they
wriggled over the ground,
and they made such a
hissing that Bubbles
thought a mighty Wind
was raging through the
Wood.
He was m great fear,
when he suddenly remem-
bered the Magic Stone
which the Princess had
given him. Surely here
was a great danger, for
even now the Serpents
were glaring at him with their fiery eyes


He drew the
flfcagic Stone
from his bosom, and no sooner had his lips
touched it than there arose on all sides a
screeching and laughing, such surely as no
boy had ever heard before. The Wood
grew darker, and presently Bubbles saw
myriads of long-beaked birds, which darted
down upon the Serpents, pecking them with
their beaks, and cuffing them with their
wings, and lifting them up into the air and
dropping them upon the hard rocks. In
less than no time, it seemed, there was not
one Serpent left alive, and then the strange
Birds, each with a Serpent in its mouth, flew
away, gurgling and laughing as before.
Much surprised at this sight, Bubbles
crossed over the Valley, and, after walking for
the space of an hour, came to a place where
the Wood was not so dense, and where a


River rolled down over a sandy bed. Pleased
with the sight of water, he ran, and was about
to quench his thirst, when he beheld a huge
animal wallowing through the water towards
him.
bubbles JBcbolbs
tbc Monster.
It lashed the water into foam with its tail,
and it opened and shut its horrid mouth m a
way that was dreadful to look at. Bubbles
thought his end had come, and was so
frightened that he dropped the Magic Stone


into the water. He saw it shining at the
bottom far beyond his reach. At that
moment a bird that had been sitting on a
branch over the stream, darted from its perch,
and dived into the water, and came up again
with the Magic Stone in its mouth. It flew
straight to Bubbles, and placed the Stone in
his hand, after which it took up its perch
again on the branch.
The Monster was coming nearer and
nearer, and Bubbles made haste to kiss the
Magic Stone ; whereupon a
Uittle Blackman,
armed with a Spear and an
H ye,
came out of the Wood
“ Fear not, little man,” he cried


With that he flung the Spear, and after-
wards the Axe. The Spear went right
through the body of the Monster, and the
Axe behaved in the most wonderful manner,
for it leapt about, as if it were a
Hiving {Thing,
and hacked the body of the Monster until it
was quite dead, and all the water was red
with its blood.
Bubbles was so glad when he saw the
Water-Monster dead, and so grateful to the
Little Blackman, that he ran to him and
kissed his hand, at which the other seemed
very pleased. Then the Little Blackman
led Bubbles up the river to a place where
he kept a small boat, made of the bark of a
tree. In the boat he ferried Bubbles over
the River ; and before they parted, he gave
him some sweet fruit, and also the


Memberful Eye,
saying as he did so :
“ Whatever you wish to chop, the Axe
will chop.”

over tbe ißivcr.
After that he got into his boat, and paddled
back, ever and anon waving his hand to
Bubbles.
After eating the fruit, Bubbles entered the
Wood once more, taking care to have the


Magic Stone and the Wonderful Axe in
readiness for anything that might happen.
For the Wood now became darker, and it
seemed that Night was falling.
He went but a few paces, when he came
upon a green glade, at one side of which was a
Ibiuje IRocfc,
and in the Rock was a
tSSBm
Cave.
The glade looked so nice that Bubbles
thought he would stay there, and spend
the night in the Cave.
At the mouth of the Cave he saw a great
foot-print, and he began to be afraid. But
grasping the Wonderful axe firmly in one
hand, and the Magic Stone in the other, he
stepped into the darkness of the Cave.

What was his surprise to find
that the light from the Stone filled
the whole place, and made it as
bright as day !
Thus cheered, he began to look
about him. In one part of the
Cave was a huge bed, in another
place was a pile of bones, and in
a corner were many jars of milk.
Bubbles did not know that this
was the home of the
Giant (Baroo,
a wicked relation of the Great
M agician. So, thinking no evil,
he drank some of the milk, and
lay down on the Giants bed,
where he soon fell fast asleep.
He had first, however, placed
the Magic Stone on the pillow,
where it shone like the sun ; and

the Wonderful Axe he held tightly in his
little hand.
In a short time he was startled out of his
sleep by a frightful roar, which made him
get up and look round in the utmost terror.
“ H oor-r, H oor-r !
“ I smell the flesh of a man ! ” roared the
Giant, for he it was, returning with his
evening meal.
When he came into the light cast by the
Magic Stone, Bubbles saw that he had
Cbree Ibeabs,
and that round each of his heads was a coil
of Snakes, which writhed and hissed, and bit
at the very air. The Giant frowned at
Bubbles, and the frown was on the three
heads at the same time. Then he lifted
up his
<sreat Club,


and was about to hurl it, when Bubbles
remembered the Wonderful Axe.
“ Chop, Axe, chop his head off—all three
of them ! ” he cried, in his terror.
No sooner said than done,
for the Axe at once whirled
itself through the air, and
hacked the Giant’s heads off in a twinkling,
and the huge body fell with a crash upon the
floor of the Cave.
Then Bubbles slept in peace till the
morning, when, after drinking some more
milk from the jars, he made ready to depart.
The birds were making merry, each in its
own way. From the thick vines the pigeons
were cooing, and a lyre-bird was yelping, as
he danced with his mates.
“ Come and swing, Little Man ! ” said
the Wongas
And Bubbles saw a great rope looped


between two trees, and Woodpeckers and
Wongas were climbing up and down on it.
Very willingly he went and sat in the
loop, and the birds swung him to and fro,
and sang and capered and flew here and
there, until Bubbles clapped his hands with
delight. He would gladly have played all
day with them, but the birds said they must
be off to look after breakfast.
So he went on his way through the
dark Wood, dreaming, as he went, of Lulu
and the Island beyond the Night.
All at once he heard a great crashing and
rushing, and a fierce yelping, as of hundreds
of hounds ; and presently a
String of Ikangaroos
came hopping and panting for their lives,,
and, as they ran, they cried out :
“ Fly, fly ! the Dingoes are here ! ”

tor Bingocs.


But they did not stop for Bubbles, who, in
great fear, crouched in the hollow of a tree.
Then came the Dingoes, foaming at the
mouth, and snapping their sharp teeth
together; and when they came near the
hollow tree, they paused and sniffed about,
growling and biting each other all the time.
At last they found the hole where Bubbles
was hidden, and when they saw him, they
snarled with joy:
“ Bir-r, Bir-r-r ! Here is good eating for
Dingoes ! ”
Shaking with fright, Bubbles drew out
the Magic Stone, and flashed it in the faces
of the Dingoes, who, strange to tell, at sight
of the Stone, fled howling through the Wood,
as if they had seen a ghost at the very least.
“ Ha, ha, ou, ah ! ” laughed a Jackass.
“ Aren’t they cowards ? ”
“ But where are you going, Little Man,
with the Magic Stone ? ”


“ I am going to seek Lulu in the Island of
the Great Magician,” said Bubbles
“ Poor Little Man ! ” mut
tered the Jackass, as

Just then a bittern stuck his beak m the
ground, and began to boom away at a great
rate.
“ Good-bye, Little Man,” said the Jackass.
“ I must be off, to get ready for the
J6aIL”


Bitterns were booming loudly on every
side, and on every tree Bubbles saw the
birds preening their wings and putting the
finishing touches to their toilettes. And
then there was a loud whirring of wings, as
they began to fly off to the West, for there
it was that the Bunyip held his Court.
Bubbles was much frightened, but still he
trudged on, whilst the Wood was alive with
animals, all running the same way. Some
came out of hollow trees, some came from
under rocks, and some from holes in the
ground.
They were in such a hurry that they
barely glanced at Bubbles, and he began to
feel lonely amid all this rushing crowd, and
he longed for a friend at court to say a good
word for him to the terrible Bunyip. True,
he had the Magic Stone and the Wonderful
Axe, but, for all that, he was frightened by


the pattering of thousands of feet and the
whirring of thousands of wings.
“ Cheep, Cheep ! ” said the Wag - tail,
stiffening his tail, and hopping in front of
Bubbles. “ Cheer up, Cheer up, Little
Man. The King is waiting. Follow me,
Little Man.”
So Bubbles went on, and the Waor-tail
cheeped, and fluttered about his feet.
The Sun was fast sinking now, but the
glow of a great fire spread through the trees,
and soon Bubbles and his little friend came
upon a wide space as bright as day, so
bright, indeed, that the very stars veiled their
eyes. Here, in countless numbers, were
gathered the
Bitbs anb the Beasts
who owned the sway of the
Bun^ip*


Such a din there was ! Grunting, squealing
whistling, every sound that happy beasts and
birds can make.
“ Make way, make way ! ” cried the
Wag-tail, puffing out his breast. “ Make
way for the
Xittle flfcan with tbe HDagic Stone!"
The Kangaroos, the Wallabies, the Opos-
sums, the Native Bears, the Bandicoots,
and the Wombats, pressed back, treading
on each other’s heels and tails, and Bubbles
and his guide passed through this living
lane, and came to the place, where stood the
terrible Bunyip, nodding his head, and
grunting in truly kingly fashion. On either
side of him stood a tall Emu, each crowned
with a shining helmet, and each holding a
palm leaf, which they waved over the head
of the King.


“ Bur-00, Bur-oo !
“ Whom have we here ? ” said the Bunyip.
The Wag-tail flew up, and perched himself
on the great horn that grew out of the
Bunyip’s forehead, and then he whispered
some words in the King’s ear.
“ What say you ? What ! O good,
good I The Little Man with the Maeic
Stone and the Axe that chopped off the
three heads of the Giant !
“Welcome, Little Man, to the Court of
the Bunyip. To-night you shall have sport,
and to-morrow my herald—he that is swiftest
of foot—shall take you to the
(5r e\> ilfcan of the Sea ”
H ere he gave an order, in a strange
tongue, and a Kangaroo came out of the
throng, and lifted Bubbles gently on to the
back of an Emu, in order that he might be
better able to see the dancing of the Animals.


Cbc jeungip’s

“ Now let the band strike up,” said the
Bunyip, “and let the ball begin.”
So the bitterns stuck their noses in the
ground, and boomed and drummed ; the
lyre-birds yelped, the thrushes whistled, the
parrots and cocka-
toos screeched, and
crows sat round on
the trees and cawed,
and the jackasses
laughed when they
got a chance. Then
o
began the funniest
o
dance that eye ever beheld, for the Bunyip
had given command that no two animals of
the same kind should be partners. The
Kangaroo and the Native Companion led
the way, the Bear gave his paw to the Black
Cockatoo, and the Wombat bowed to the
Curlew, and so on, each one picking out the


partner he loved best. Round and round
they went, ever faster and ever merrier, and
when the Kangaroos and Wallabies tucked
their tails under their arms, to keep them out
of the way, the Bunyip roared with delight,
and Bubbles laughed, until the tears flowed
down his cheeks. Hour after hour they
danced, until the King said it was time for
good people to go to bed and put out the
lights.
“ Back to your homes, good people, as
fast as feet and wings can take you.”
So, ducking their heads to the Bunyip, the
beasts scuttled off through the trees, and the
birds flew home to tell their little ones of the
Bunyip’s ball.
Then the Bunyip yawned, and when the
Emu had put on his night-cap, he lay down
on a bed of scented leaves, and was soon
snoring loudly and happily.


As for Bubbles, the Emu showed him a
snug feather bed, where he slept as soundly as
he would have slept in his little cot at home.
He got up with the Sun, and made ready
to depart. The Bunyip hoped he should see
him again.
“ When you come back from the quest, as
I hope you will, do not forget to pay me a
visit, and bring Lulu with you.”
Bubbles said he would be sure to come,
and then he mounted an Emu that stood by
waiting for him, and was carried swifter than
the Wind down to the shore of the Sea,
where lived the Old Grey Man of the Sea.
“ I bring you the
Xtttle HDan,

said the Emu

/!ban of tbc Sea.




“ It is well,’' said the Old Grey Man of
the Sea, stroking his long white beard.
“H eis welcome. But he has far to go, and
the tide waits for him.”
The Emu, having done the bidding of his
lord the Bunyip, bowed in a courtly way, and
returned, as he had come, swifter than the
Wind.
Then the Old Grey Man of the Sea gave
Bubbles to eat and to drink, and spoke kindly
to him, telling him what he must do.
“ You must sail over the
Sea of Honomg
for twenty moons, until you come to the
Jslanh
of the
{Three iptmcesses,
who weave the


leathers of <solb.
But you must beware of the White Rock,
that moves for ever on the Seas, and is
drawn by four-and-twenty Whales, the smoke
of whose nostrils reaches the clouds. Upon
this rock lives a great Ogre, who devours
those that go down to the Sea in ships, and
scatters their bones upon the Sea-floor.
“ Fair is the Rock to look upon, and
beautiful Maidens sing upon the shores of it,
so sweetly that the sailors are blinded, and
drive their ships forward, until the long arm
of the Ogre seizes the ships and dashes them
to pieces upon the rocks.
“ Watch, night and day, and when you
hear their singing, go not nigh the Rock,
but flee with all the speed you may.


“ But now make haste. We tarry too
long.”
They walked then to the Sea’s edge, where
Bubbles saw a boat with a prow carved like
unto a swan’s head, and in it was a mast and
a velvet sail, furled with ropes of gold.
The Old Grey Man of the Sea blew a
loud blast upon a shell, and straightway there
came racing and tumbling through the waves
a great number of Dolphins, which placed
themselves in pairs in front of the boat ; and
then the Old Grey Man of the Sea harnessed


them with thongs of seal-skin, which had
buckles of silver and pearl. Then he lifted
Bubbles, and placed him in the boat, and
ofave him £ood store of meat and drink for
o O
the long voyage that lay before him.
“ Adieu, my son, and may no evil befall
thee.”
With that, he clapped his hands, and the
Dolphins reared their glossy backs, and sped
away over the smooth Sea, so fast that the
land was soon lost to view.
Day after day, and night after night, they
sped onward. Many suns came and went,
and many moons waxed and waned, and ever
there was the same smooth, landless sea.
At last, one morning, when the
IDavvn
first sprang into the sky, Bubbles woke out
of a sweet sleep, in which he had dreamed of


Lulu. There was a strange singing in his
ears, and all the air and the sea seemed full
of fairy music, sweeter than aught he had
ever heard in the world. He lay still, and,
with half-closed eyes, listened as one in a
trance.
Then dimly, as in a dream, he was aware
of a great White Rock, and he saw the foam
spouted to the clouds, and on the strand were
many Maidens, dancing and singing, and
waving white hands to him.
But his memory came back to him, and all
in a moment he knew the trap of the White
Rock, that moves for ever over the seas.
Dolphins,
he cried
Then he bethought him to haul down the
velvet sail, and no sooner had he loosed the
ropes of gold than the boat flew over the

waves, and a thick mist
fell, which hid the Rock,
and the Spouting Whales,
and the Witch Maidens on
the strand.
For many days they
flew through the mist, and
at last they came upon a
Shining Sea, in the midst
of which was set a
(Sreen Jslanb,
with White Cliffs that
blinked joyously in the
sunlight, and high upon
the brow of a hill stood a
Stately palace,
with many
Shining XHHinbows*


Then the keel grated upon a pebbly
strand, and Bubbles sprang forth, with the
sv.wiMagic Stone and the Wonder-
Jig ful Axe, for he knew that,
without these,
Lulu could never be won
from the Island of the Great Magician
The Dolphins blinked up at him out of
their little eyes, then lashed their tails, and in
a moment were far out at Sea, for now must
they return to their master, the Old Grey
Man of the Sea.
Bubbles watched them, until the Mist’hid
them from sight, and then he turned, and
followed a Path that led to the garden of the
Stately Palace. When he reached the steps,
the great door swung open, and a voice said,
“ Enter, and have no fear.”
So, with good hope in his heart, he passed
in, and came to a room where sat the

each spinning threads of
gold, out of which they
made the Feathers of
Gold, whereof the Old
Grey Man of the Sea
had told him, and the
three of them were talking
and laughing right mer-
rily, and they were very
beautiful to behold.
When they saw Bubbles,
they left their spinning
wheels with a cry of joy,
and ran to him, and kissed
him, and set him in an
Ivory Chair m their midst, and he was very
happy with them, and looked from one to
another with glad smiles upon his face.

Then one of them rang a
Silver Bell,
that stood upon a table nigh her, and forth-
with many Fairies came in, with fresh robes
for him, and dainties to eat and drink.
And it came into the mind of Bubbles that
these were the Fairies that waited upon
Lulu, and that this was the
palace of Xlobt
in which she went to the Island of Palms
And he was very glad thereat.
The three Golden-haired Princesses made
much of him, and told him many things
which it was needful for him to know.
“ You have still,” said they, “to wend
over the Sea of Blackness, and then you
must overcome the Great Magician with a
magic greater than his own, and, last of all,


you must enter the Grim Castle, and wake
Lulu from the sleep in which she lies.
Already you have the magic with you to
overcome the Magician, and, for the rest, you
must trust to your own heart, and have
no fear.”
Then they gave him each a
jfeatber of (3o\b.
One they fastened upon either arm, and
one they fastened to the Crown of Gold
which the Fairies had set upon his head.
And after that they brought him to a high
Cliff that looked far over the Sea, and
they bade him leap boldly into the air
and have no fear.
And Bubbles, because he had great
trust in them, sprang from the edge of the
Cliff, and behold ! the Feathers of Gold bore
him up, and flew through the air with him.

Over the

he sped, the Sea which
moans and heaves for
ever, and in a short
space Bubbles beheld a
Craggy Island and a

upon the top of it. He
knew in his heart that
this must be the Island
of the Great Magician.
In a moment he
stood upon the bare

He sought the

stood in much doubt and fear he saw in
the cleft of the rock the

When he raised his face he saw before
him the Great Magician himself, dressed
in a night-black mantle, and there was a
frown on the sad, beautiful face.
“ What do you here, O Child from over
the Sea ? ”
“ I come to wake Lulu from her sleep,
and to take her back to her Home in the
Valley.”
“ Foolish child ; to wake Lulu from her
happy sleep is beyond thy power.” And he
laughed a sad laugh, which made Bubbles
pity him.
He had been minded to throw the
Wonderful Axe at the Magician, but the
pity he felt stayed his hand, and he let
the Axe fall to the ground. Then,
whispering to himself, “ Hurt him not, but
only soften his heart,” he drew the Magic


Stone from his bosom, and flashed its light
upon the Magician.
Instantly there was a
(Sreat Blinking Jflasb,
and a
peal of
that shook the Island, and a bright cloud
arose from the midst of which came a voice,
“Übou bast won,

And Bubbles thought that, in the cloud,
he saw the face of the Great Magician,
shining with the brightness of the Sun,
and there was no longer a frown upon his
brow, but a smile of Joy and Love.

And the Island was no more what it
had been nor the Castle. For the Island
was now like a
(Batben of the fairies,
with trees and flowers and singing birds,
and the Grim Castle was a Palace, fair as
a dream, and the sunlight played about it,
and entered it at many doors and windows.
And Bubbles, greatly surprised by all
that he saw, entered the Palace, and there,
on a richly dight bed, lay Lulu ; and she
was so lovely in her sleep that Bubbles
gazed long before he thought of trying to
wake her.
But presently he kissed her lightly on
the forehead, and Lulu woke up from her
long sleep and looked gladly at him, and
when she saw the Long, White Clay Pipe
in his hand, and the Old Broken Tea-cup,


she rose up with a right joyous cry, and
threw her little arms about Bubbles’ neck,
and the twain of them were very happy ;
and they passed out into the garden of
the Singing Birds, and they also sang, out
of the fullness of joy that was in them.
And Lulu fondled the

and the
Broken Cea^cup,
and she said :
“ Come, let us make a

And, because there was no soapy water in
