Lecture on
MAN, HIS CHARACTERISTICS AND
ACHIEVEMENTS.
Delivered at the University of Adelaide to the Members
of the Royal Geographical Society of Australia, S.A.
Branch, October 28, 1908.
[By Mr. Thomas S. Reed, J.P.]
The creation of man has ever been a topic of pro-
found interest. Long before the Adamic period as descri-
bed in my former lecture, a race of men existed whose
remains were discovered by geologists, from time to time,
in strata embracing at least 240,000 years, intermingled
with the remains of the colossal beasts of that epoch;
men in full contrast to those of our own time ?men as
evidenced by their bones, of great strength and gigantic
stature, and which were needed together with the power-
ful weapons they used, in self defence, and in the
slaughter of these animals for food. And these records
of prehistoric man?s presence have been made not only
in England, France, and other parts of Europe, but in
Africa also, where the discoveries of Professor Petrie,
Mr. Karr Seaton and others in Somaliland and in the
Nile Valley, show that in these regions men were living
all through those primeval ages. And 1 should like just
here to say that I have in this lecture neither intention or
desire to enter into that difficult question of evolution.
My one purpose is in emerging from the prehistoric at-
mosphere to this nearer age or epoch, to consider man as
we find him within this historical era under every variety
of race, of environment, and of locality.
The most * recent scientists point to three distinct
types of man, the white as seen in the Caucasian of
Europe, the yellow in the Mongolian of Asia, and the
black in the' Ethiopian of Africa; and it is remarkable


sits in a lower room, and over her head are let down
through the chinks of the upper room floor two or three
cocoanut leaflets. She then pulls at one and asks whose
it was?if the reply was not from her favoured one she
left it and pulled at another until she found the one she
loved when she pulled it down out of his hand. The
happy man then remained to arrange for the marriage
day; the others went each to his own place.
The Russian peasant or moujik is infinitely stupid
and profoundly stolid, a patience apparently unaffected
by any externals, but on fire within, ever ready to break
out. He lives in dirt and squalor, on sour black bread,
salt, and milk curds?when he can get it. He was in-
finitely better off as a sffrf; his emancipation was one
thing, the providing the freed serf with the wherewithal
to live, was another. Thousands on thousands therefore
starve as we constantly hear.
AN ith respect to the Gypsies, the origin of this re-
markable race was stated by Gypsy Smith when in Ade-
laide as ?an unsolved problem.?? There is no doubt, how-
ever, according to the German writer Grellman that the
Himalayan slopes were the original home of all the
Gypsies prior to the year 1417 when they first made their
appearance in Europe. The two languages are also very
similar; in Hindostani the word ?snow? is hima, in
Romany it is him; the word ?bearer? is in the former
lava, in Romany loya. and in both languages Himalaya
means ?bearer of snow.? AVhen the Gypsies first came to
this country they brought with them peculiar ideas on the
subject of property, a feature which they have always
retained; as in all their European travels they have in-
variably had an intense dislike to purchase their own
eggs and poultry. Their whole physiognomy is strongly
suggestive of an Eastern origin?their chief figures are
athletic and muscular, and they lead a shiftless and vag-
rant life unaffected by the inclemency of the seasons.
The Gypsy women are as a rule very beautiful, and in
spite of the traditional opposition of the tribes have some-
times married well. The Hungarian Gypsies produce the
most wonderful strange and weird music in the world. A
band was induced to come over in 1889 when they played
in Paris and London to crowded and astonished audiences
with six violins, a ?cello, a double bass, a flageolet, and


cymbals, and I quote one or two sentences describing
their performances. ??They put all the strange beauty
and poetry of their lives into all the music they played?
fierce passion, unutterable sadness, love, and rage, in al-
ternation, then in a moment their voices were hushed in
a sudden wild wail, and at last stilled in a glad ecstacy,
for they sang as well as they played. A splendid specu-
lation for a (leach or any other to bring over such a band
here or to England; but full of risk, as the one difficulty
is in their restlessness to get them to stay and to keep
an engagement.?
The yellow races number more than a third of the
world?s people and comprise the Chinese, Japanese,
Koreans. Tartars, and Thibetans. Among these the
Chinese are in the first rank. Their characteristic in any
progressive sense, until the last few years, has been one
of intense stagnancy, of petrified civilization. In demean-
our an imperturbable calm, but in the under strata a
latent spirit of life and vigour and an assiduous
persistence in labour, by means of which they spread
over and are to be found in every country and in every
clime.
The Japanese, although low of stature, and with only
slight muscular development, have yet powers of great
endurance and unflinching bravery as shown in the last
war. Intellectually they stand at the head of all the
Mongol races and in many respects can take almost equal
rank with the European natives. Their laws are founded
on European principles, their police are organized on
European models. They have two Universities and thou-
sands of schools; tin* education is compulsory, but not
free except to the poor, and they printed their first book
in the eighth century. The Japanese woman is the charm
of her country: though small she is attractive and beau-
tiful, and her neck is beautifully modelled. Bearing in
mind her exquisite taste in the design and colour of her
silk and cotton textures, it is to be hoped that she will
never substitute the European costume for her own.
The Dutch gs a rule are reputedly brave, stubborn,
and honest; taciturn and cold in manner they can at the
same time be blunt and outspoken. They are great
smokers and have excellent appetites, and there is an ex-


tensive consumption of �in. but except at fairs an uncer-
tain locomotion is seldom witnessed. The Dutch, how-
ever. have been essentially a great people, a people of
scholars, historians, and painters; for they have produced
a Scaliger, a (Irotius, and a Rembrandt.
The Swede is physically a tine race, and together with
the Norwegian of generally higher stature than any other
European nation. From highest to lowest rank the
Swedes are gentlemen in feeling and in bearing. They
attach the highest importance to politeness and considera-
tion for others, as evidenced daily both by rich and poor,
who invariably salute each other as they pass.
I he Norwegian of the Norse branch of Teutonic stock
is brave and manly, and clever at all kinds of handiwork,
felling his own trees in the forest, with which he builds
his house. The women are comely and almost English
in feature and complexion.
The true Norse or Vikings of the Eighth and Ninth
century were, apart from the piracy, a noble race; with
them woman whether as maiden or wife was held in the
highest respect. The mode of burial in ships belonged
exclusively to the Vikings. If unburnt the ship was
buried in a huge mound as discovered at Bergen Stift in
1887 where besides the impalpable dust, lay seven
swords, a golden bracelet, and the stones of a hand mill.
\\ hen burnt at sea the \ iking Iving was laid down on
the deck of his warship, which being set on fire and
speeding along in a fierce gale with every sail set, the
ttames enveloped the ship in one sheet of fire in which
his spirit was believed to make its ascent heavenwards.
The Spanish woman is very beautiful, but it is a
beauty which comes early to maturity. She is a distin-
guished linguist for she holds in her hand the elements
of a second and more far-reaching language than that of
the tongue. There is nofhing that a well educated fan
cannot say in the hands of a Spanish woman, and though
held in the most innocent and apparently natural
manner, it yet conceals or reveals a purpose in every
movement, as she has a perfect code of signals, each one
as expressive as her autograph.


The Scotch as a rule have a splendid physique and
are tall in stature both men and women.
Before describing in detail the various characteristics
of man in our own time, the people of our own British
Nation, I will only mention one typical illustra-
tion of a true English woman; that of our
beloved Queen ?beautiful in character, scarcely less
so in features (which in her latest photographs
have undergone little change since the day I stood
by her carriage on her first entry into London)
and than no fitter successor could have been
chosen to the great and wise Victoria. And I cannot
suggest a better type of a true gentleman, and of well-
known English family than the late Sir Samuel
Davenport, whose ?Natures Nobility? was fully recog-
nised by the late Prince Alfred, who, when they came
together towards the close of his visit, remarked ?Why
Avas I not introduced to him before??
In allusion to man in our own historical age under
his various characteristics, physical and mental, we may
include under the former head, stature, personal
physique, costume, manners, and habits of life.
And referring first to stature; every one likes to be
of or above an ordinary height; a little dwarfish man
therefore wears a tall hat, high heeled boots, and walks
very uprightly. The average height of the man is about
5 ft. 7 in., that of the woman from 3 to 4 inches lower.
In Scotland high stature is a characteristic of the race.
Jardine of Jardine whom I used to see at Moffat was 7 ft.
2 in.; although one morning in London in 1862 close
to the Mansion House I and my son saw an Englishman
walking along of 8 ft. 4 in., an estimated measurement
which appeared in the next day?s Times. One great ad-
vantage of high stature is being able to look over the
heads of a crowd, or over some hat and its floriculture if
worn at an entertainment; the great disadvantage lies in
the height of a doorway, or in the length of the bedstead,
for then ?man wants that little long.? Far shorter, how-
ever was the aforesaid Englishman than the 11 ft. 4 in.
of Goliath; and if-e\ r en the accuracy of these figures were
questioned, other allusions to giants are made as well in
secular as in Biblical history. Pliny in his natural
history, mentions the discovery in a mountain of Crete,


of a human skeleton six cubits, or nearly 12 feet long; and
iigil, speaking of a labourer who when ploughing
turned up the bones of his ancestors, says ?He gazes as-
tounded on the gigantic bones that start from their
broken sepulchres.? But coming nearer home, Sir. Geo.
Grey, when Governor of New Zealand, found as an orna-
ment in one of the Whares the leg and arm bones, now in
the British Museum, of a man who must have been quite
nine feet high.
And now a word of reference to the only visible
part of the body, the head, the features, the face.
In any portrait of a man or a woman it is the face
that always rivets our attention; all else is subordinate.
The forehead and the eye especially give expression to
the whole face. And then the nose; animals in general
have snouts and beaks and trunks, but no animal has a
perfect nose but a man; although I once saw in the Egyp-
tian Hall, Piccadilly, two Aztecs whose nasal organ cer-
tainly did resemble a beak; indeed the whole face was
bird like. The nose indeed is everything in a face; in
woman the straight Grecian nose or the nose retrousse
which has also its charm. With the Duke of Wellington
the nose was the whole man, and with Lord Brougham in
heated argument, it was also the one prominent feature
and was always in constant action.
And then apart from the nose, perhaps next to the
eye, the most important facial organ is the eyebrow, in
its extreme exercise of mobility, and in such manifold
forms and command of expression, whether of affirma-
tion, 01* doubt, or distrust, or disbelief, in all of which the
eye evidently takes its full part with the eyebrow in a
dual and correspondent exercise. And last of all both
eye and eyebrow seem to possess and express a penetra-
tive kind of influence in the knowledge or adjustment of
character. In conversation also, the emotion of surprise
is expressed almost everywhere by the raising of the eye-
brows; sometimes by opening the mouth; with negroes
it is by protrusion of the lip as if to whistle, and with our-
selves when doubting some assertion there very fre-
quently is a whistle. The emotion of auger on the'other
hand is expressed by lowering the eyebrows and by a
distinct contraction of the forehead cuticle. There is,
however, one more instance in which the eyebrow comes


into direct exercise as described by the late Sir Jas.
Paget, and that is in the effort of the will to suppress the
sensation of pain, when there is a strong contraction
amounting sometimes to a closure of the eye itself.
The hair may be divided into four different shades,
black, dark brown, chestnut, or golden-brown, and fair.
Red hair of all shades is an individual anomaly, for
there are no red-haired races or communities. Personal
objections, however, to this colour and to other colours
also, have been frequently raised when the tints have been
altered by chemical process.
Costume is another important characteristic. With
the natural demand of the body for as perfect a stratified
adjustment as possible, the outcome has not always been
as artistic as could be desired. In former days, with
women it was the poke bonnet and the fardingale, the
hair parted in the middle, and tightly plastered over the
forehead. The men wore the beaver hat, tight trousers
closely strapped round the foot, and in full dress a blue
?coat with brass buttons. Years before, the men wore a
full velvet suit, as did my father, and I suppose my
grandfather before him, who was born in 1730, the third
year of George the Second's Reign. In the present day
the costume of the man has been in great part adopted by
the woman. She has taken the collar, the cuff, the tie,
the felt hat, and, when hunting, the tall hat and the
tailor made coat; and the man now says with Micah ?ye
have taken the things which I had, and now what have I
more.?
Another prominent characteristic is that of manners
and general deportment, in which as compared with the
old ideals of two or three generations ago, there is a mar-
ked degeneracy, a general verdict declared in other
countries and repeatedly in our owu magazine articles.
And when we speak of sociability of manner, the contrast
between the English and Foreign deportment is no-
where more manifest than when brought into association
with strangers. With the English the general charac-
teristic is a reluctance to fraternize with any casual ac-
quaintance until fully satisfied with his social position.
But the foreigner talks at once to his neighbour as the
?Oamarade? of-the moment, and any interval of silence
is to the French a case of ?bete noir.? In our artizan


class as a rule, in the miner, the navvy, the mason, the
man in the street, a low standard of manners is very
frequently a marked characteristic, as evidenced in their
general deportment and in their language. You never
see or hear this coarseness of manner or speech in the
Maori, the Swede, or in any of the northern natives. With
them manliness is gentleness, and their yea is yea and
without the adjectives. The French can teach us a
lesson; a stonebreaker on the road as I have often seen
in France and in Belgium will invariably doff his cap as
you pass with a ?bon jour? salutation. And this is a
habit acquired from infancy. In France, every adult of
whatever grade is addressed as ?Monsieur,? ? Madame,?
or ?Mademoiselle,?and these three words are said to have
done much in founding that universal politeness so
characteristic of that nation.
In full contradistinction, however, to all our short-
comings.as a people, in any elements in which by compari-
son we must take a lower place, we can yet assert
positively that in true worth of character, in reliableness,
in our perfect freedom and in our personal relations, the
English nation has ever stood out among all other
countries in the van of true progress by upholding the
principles of truth, and of liberty, of right, and of justice.
Last and of great importance under the physical head
is the Mode and Habits of life, for these affect the life
itself which we sometimes deliberately shorten. I sup-
pose one secret of a long life is the casting aside of all
worry, although we can hardly envy the French philo-
sopher Fontenelle, who lived to an extreme old age. He
was described as possessing an unruffled calm, totally un-
moved by any emotions, and as having two brains, one
in the usual place, the other where his heart should be;
and through this serene and passionless apathy (des-
cribed by Madame Geoffrin as a delicate machine that
would go on for ever if placed in a corner where no one
could brush against it) he lived on to a hundred years.
In alluding to the Mental Characteristics, when we
come to the mind from which they spring, modern science
tells us that the brain at its seat is a marvel of marvels,
a mass of nerve cells; and that in all the reactions giving
thought, perception, self-consciousness, soul, mind, the


great factor is a current of ether passing through the
nerve cells, and that the complex activities of thought,
even those of the body, all have their seat in the brain;
that even the feeling of anger and the feeling of hunger
arise in the brain, from which also proceed all those
mental feelings and emotions so generally ascribed to the
heart, which is said to be merely a muscular organism
propelling the blood. I cannot here omit a most marvel-
lous statement by the late Sir Jas. Paget in his address
to the London University students in 1888, as to what the
brain can accomplish and which true as it is, and must
be, he himself declared to be inconceivable. ?To the
scientific student there are new wonders everywhere, let
me tell the last that I have observed. Mademoiselle
Janotha was so good as to play on the piano, at my
request, one of the swiftest pieces of music known to her,
a presto by Mendelssohn. The time it occupied was
taken, and the number of notes was counted. She played
5,995 notes in four minutes and three seconds; rather
more than 24 notes per second. We may, from this, esti-
mate approximately the number of what we may call
nervous vibrations transmitted during a given time to
and from the brain; from the brain to the muscles, and
from the muscles and the organs of hearing and of touch
to the brain. Each note required at least two voluntary
movements of a finger, the bending down, and the raising
up; and besides these a very large number of lateral move-
ments to and fro of the fingers, as well as many and
various movements of the wrists, elbows, shoulders, and
feet. It was not possible to count these, but I think I
can be sure that they were not less than at the rate of
one movement for each note, making, altogether, not less
than three voluntary movements for each note; certainly
not less than 72 distinctive variations in the currents of
nerve-force transmitted from the brain to the muscles in
each second, and each of these variations was determined
by a distinct effort of the will. And observe, for herein
may seem a chief wonder, each of these movements was
directed by the will to a certain place, with a certain
force, a certain speed, at a certain time; and each touch
was maintained for a certain length of time. Thus there
were, as we may* say, five distinct and designed qualities
in each of the 72 movements in each second. Moreover,
each of these movements, determined by the will and ex-
actlv effected bv transmission of nerve-force from the


brain along nerve-fibres to the muscles ?each of these
movements was associated with consciousness of the very
position of each finger, each hand, each arm, and each
foot before it was moved and while moving it, and with
consciousness of the sound of each note and of the force
of each touch. Thus there were at least four conscious
sensations for each of the 24 notes in each second; that
is, there were at the rate of 06 transmissions of force from
the ends of nerve-fibres, along their course to the brain,
in each of the same seconds, during which there were 72
transmissions going out from the brain along other nerve-
fibres to the muscles. And then, add to all this, that dur-
ing the time, in each second of which the mind was con-
scious of at least 96 sensations, and directed not less than
72 movements, it was also remembering each note to be
played in its due time and place, and was exercised, with
the judgment, in the comparison of the playing of this
evening with those of the time before, and with some of
the sentiments which the music was intended to express.
It was played from memory, but Mademoiselle Janotha
assures me that she could have played it as swiftly at
sight, though this would have added another to the four
sensations associated with each note.?
Viewing the mind in its early transitional
history, there seem to be three stages in every
child?s life, the intuitional, the tuitional, and the
rational. By the intuitional I mean that period
when the child simply takes in what it receives
from others; by the tuitional when he conies into
contact with teachers and outside the home; and by
the rational when he begins to think and decide for him-
self. And it is the tuitional that stands out in the young
life as the one prominent factor in the formation of
character. A great school at Eton or Harrow, and at
Rugby, especially under an Arnold, has its ?esprit de
corps,? its discipline, its emulation, and sometimes as
under that marvellous man Edward Timing, of Upping-
ham, it evolves a high principled central focus affecting
the character of every pupil. In that great school the
boys themselves voluntarily formed a council of twelve
to watch over and bring to book any of their fellows
guilty of anything that was foul or low in language or
principle or act, in order to establish and sustain a high
moral tone among their number.


Following the school is the University. Just before
I left England, its doors until then confined to men, w r ere
opened to women also, who as graduates of two Cam-
bridge Colleges, entered the lists, competing on equal
terms, side by side with the men, and with what results?
About the year 1865 that grand woman Mrs. Fawcett ex-
pressed a strong desire to a number of friends in her
drawing room that higher educational facilities might
he afforded to womankind. The Universities were
shortly afterwards thrown open, and her own daughter
Philippa, at Newnham College, Cambridge, (of which
Helen Gladstone was the Principal) subsequently ob-
tained a first class in language, in logic, and in mathe
matics, and a year after, she heard in the Senate House
the words ?Philippa Garrett Fawcett ?Above the Senior
Wrangler ,? ? a proud triumph indeed, for she had out-
stripped by many marks Bennett the distinguished mathe-
matician. And she was not one in any sense that burned
the midnight oil with a wet towel round her head. Six
hours a day was her study limit, she was an adept at
lawn tennis, hockey, and she was a proficient fencer.
But apart from the ordinary channels of education a
great University can become, and did become, the birth
place of a movement which affected and will affect the
character and spiritual environments of the Anglican
Church to all time, a movement ?the Tractarian? which
had it arisen among individuals and elsewhere would have
crept along and grown but slowly. But rising as it did
from a great centre of intellectual activity it sprang at
once into vigorous manhood just because there existed in
the University a force drawing to itself a number of intel-
lectual powerful minds. A similar channel for a spiritual
outflow, and with the same results, was seen in that great
religious movement where Ignatius Loyola, Francis
Xavier and other students seized upon the Paris Univer-
sity as its own centre, a seat of learning and intellectual
force where they could bring into full maturity the prin-
ciples and structure of the Society of Jesus.
And now, furthermore, of all these people that have
come before us it*is the white race alone that have always
been in a state of active and progressive improvement
throughout. Through them alone civilization has been
advanced, and through them alone the arts and sciences


and industries have been developed in advancing the
great interests of humanity.
And I should like here to glance, and as briefly as
possible, at the history of this progress through the vari-
ous stages of discovery and invention in the different
branches of science up to the present day.
And if we begin with the engineering, perhaps the
most wonderful work in the world was that of the An-
cients, in first transporting and then raising and planting
those enormous blocks of stone; those of the Pyramid 30
feet long; the limestone quarried from Assouan a dis-
tance of 50 miles, the red granite from 500 miles and con-
veyed first to the Nile, then from the Nile along a road
said to have been of polished granite beautifully
carved with hieroglyphics (a road that took ten
years in building), to the site of the Pyramid
itself. Then we have Carnac Pillar 63 feet high
and 14 feet in diameter, and the Statue of Raineses 11.,
60 feet high and weighing 887 tons; these also were
brought from distant quarries. How were they raised?
The correctness of the one prevailing opinion?the in-
clined plane of hardened earth or clay ?has been proved
by a great American geologist, Dr. Win, Dali, who in 1878
discovered at Jersey two of these huge uprights and a
rootling slab of enormous size; and behind and against it
an inclined plane of earth beaten very hard and extend-
ing from the level of the uprights to the general level of
the soil. There seems little doubt that the inclined plane
was used largely in the lower strata of the Pyramid, but
this could not apply to the interior chambers and galleries
and narrow passages. The whole work is incompre-
hensible to our scientists, even the polishing and the carv-
ing, especially of the hard red granite, with, according to
Herodotus, only their iron tools. And the only appliances
we know they had for this great work, from the pictorial
remains, were sledges, rollers, levers, and ropes. No re-
mains have ever been found of any derrick, crane, or
hoisting machine, nor is there any word in their language
answering to them.
Coming forward to our own times to the Nineteenth
century, that marvellous epoch of Man?s achievements,
one prominent item in Modern Enginering is the construc-
tion of wide span bridges; I suppose one of the longest


is the Forth Bridge in Scotland, the total length being a
mile and a half in two Cantilever spans of 1,700 feet each,
and two of (575 feet each, leaving a clear headway at high
water of 152 feet. In other structures there is the Eiffel
Tower in Paris 980 feet in height, in which were used
900 tons of iron at a total cost of �200,000. A still more
daring and Babel-like effort is seen in the Singer Office
Building now in course of erection in New York, a true
skyscraper 740 feet in height and with 49 floors, a build-
ing which covers acres, and w T hen finished will accom-
modate 6,000 people. And now if we enter the wide field
of Science, the last century was an epoch of glorious
achievements, of successive triumphs, of continuous pro-
gress.
The most prominent factor in Educational Science
was the establishment of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, which held its first meeting at
in 1831, and of which Sir David Brewster was
practically the founder. I had the privilege of member-
ship at its meeting at Bristol in 1837, and of then hearing
Condvbeare and Lubbock and Carpenter, and also Hera-
path and Prestwich; and it was at that meeting that
Wheatstone read the first paper on Electric Light.
And perhaps no man in the history of any nation has
ever lent so powerful an influence in its development as
Prince Albert in the World?s Fair of 1851 at Hyde Park,
the first of a long series of International Exhibitions that
have continued with increasing interest up to this day.
It was an exhibition that gave an immense stimulus not
only to science but also to British paintings, to sculp-
ture, and to commercial industries in every department.
Of the sciences, first in order we have the Camera
and all that it has done and is doing. It can photograph
the features of a loved one, and the features and the
fingers of the criminal; it can bring before us the exquis-
ite scenery of far distant countries. Ascending upwards
it prints off the lightning flash, and still ascending it will
give us the varied tints of those seldom seen but gorgeous
sunsets. But its greatest marvel of all is the detection of
objects too faint to be seen by the largest telescope, the
discovery of the stars of whose very existence we were
ignorant, and altering very materially our previous esti-


mate of their number. Before the employment of photo-
graphy in this direction, their approximate number was
estimated at 30,000, the present estimate being thousands
of millions.
It is not generally recorded that the first telescope
was made by a spectacle maker in Holland, who in 1608
happened one day to take up two lenses and look through
them at a weathercock, and finding that he could see very
much more distinctly, he put them in a tube and thus
made the first telescope.
The Telegraph had its primary forecast in 1632, when
Galileo referred to a secret art by which through the
sympathy of magnetic needles it would be possible for
persons to communicate with one another at a great
distance. And again in 1753 when one G. Morison of
Greenock, in a published letter is said to have set down
the principles very clearly; but its real life history began
with Wheatstone and Cook.
Closely allied to this is the telephone, in which the
usual inaugural question ?Are you There?? may certainly
find the response ?I am Here,? in Edison's Phonograph
the medium of recording and reproducing articulate
human speech or song. Many artists now make use of
the phonograph while painting a portrait, as they declare
that it helps to banish the bored look which a subject
usually assumes when sitting for any length of time; in
the case of children, for instance, when unable to sit
much longer without restlessness or fatigue, especially if
the phonograph is turning out melodies or funny
speeches.
A still further advance is seen in the introduction of
wireless telegraphy, in which Marconi, after careful and
experimental study of the question, has worked out and
brought to perfection the various branches of the system,
nearly all of which (as described by Carl Snyder in his
recent work) were discovered by various scientists long
before his day.
Another revelation is the ?Rontgen Rays,? dis-
covered in 1595, which are the results of electrical actions
in certain vacuum bulbs ?the Rontgen Rays, so indispen-
sable to surgery, disclosing a needle in the body, our own


pictorial bones, or, as about a year ago a number of dia-
monds secreted inside the neck of an Asiatic.
Then followed the discovery of ?Radium? by Madame
Curie in 1902, an element of remarkable properties. Its
prominent feature is the emission of great energy and
possessing marvellous powers of penetration; and extra-
ordinary power of bringing about chemical action; which
has been described so lucidly by Professor Bragg in his
lectures at the Adelaide University.
And then what advances have been made in Surgery?
In my boyhood a man absolutely worthless in his life was
at his death worth two guineas a limb for the knife of the
dissector ! At that time my father had to send one of his
men night after night to the cemetry, well armed, and
with a lantern, to watch over the grave of my sister.
Now, under the term of ?unclaimed relatives? dissecting
cases are numerous and gratuitous.
Then, the general treatment was bleeding and leech-
ing and cupping, now it is the more refined counter
irritant.
Them, it was the agonies of tooth extraction, now it
is the painless dentistry, although long since in my office
in King William Street even with that inscription out-
side, the yells were frightful and frequent. The present
discoveries in surgery are marvellous, in the substitution
of new for lost tissues, and antiseptics for the destruc-
tion of germs, in wiring and screwing of bones, up to
the grafting of a nose. And only a few months ago a
German Professor reported to the Medical Journal of
Berlin, an operation in which a heart pierced by a bullet
was sewn up, and the patient cured in six weeks. And
Imre I may be pardoned for a slight digression in men-
tioning a case which occurred in the fifties during mv
lesidence at Derby in the experience of mv friend Dr
Gisborne. A young medico at a post mortem case had
given evidence and diagnosed the general appearance of
the heart. Just after this the doctor told me with drv
humour the heart was at that very time in spirits in mV
surgery, as 1 had previously examined the body.?
And then out of consideration to those of us who are
peculiarly susceptible to pain, there was in the beginning
of last century, the discovery of anaesthetics by the late


Sir J. Simpson, who with two other doctors, experimented
upon a certain substance, which was chloroform. Upon
inhaling its vapour they all three became temporarily in-
sensible, when on recovering Dr. Simpson at once re-
garded this hitherto neglected substance as an agent for
procuring insensibility to pain. Further trials confirmed
his opinion, and thus a satisfactory anaesthetic was given
to the world.
To the microscope we owe the discovery of the germ
theory in all its multifold radiations, bacilli so numerous
that hundreds of thousands can be spaced on a square
inch.
One series of the first lectures on Mesmerism, was de-
livered early in 1837, by a German Professor in Bristol.
The experiments were tried on pale cataleptic subjects
who were rigidized and then submitted to the audience for
testing, such as hanging a heavy weight on an extended
limb, or pricking some sensitive spot on the arm with a
pin, which many of us did.
After these lectures also, the first of its kind was one
of a still more sensational character by Win. Herapath,
a great chemist of that day, on the properties of nitrous
oxide gas, given at a large Lecture Hall in Clifton with
ascending seats as in our University. The effects pro-
duced by the gas apparently differed according to the
temperament of the inhaler. The first subject stepped
suddenly forward and in a most tragic attitude rendered
a quotation from Shakespeare, and then collapsed. The
next stood up squaring at the lecturer in true pugilistic
form. The third fled up the seats with the apparent light-
ness of a bird in the midst of the audience, but with no
injury or inconvenience to anyone. I witnessed this same
result years after at the London University when a medi-
cal student whom they called ?Smike,? ?tall and thin as
in Dickens?in this case under nitrous ether gas fled up
the amphitheatre close to where I was sitting but so
lightly that no one appeared to be the least disturbed in
any way.
And then mark the progress in railway speed, begin-
ning at Stephenson?s first locomotive, the ?Rocket.?
People laughed at the idea of its covering 16 or IS miles
an hour, although Stephenson himself, not long after its
first appearance pushed it up to 36 miles an hour in


carrying the wounded statesman, Huskisson to his home.
Years after this, when travelling on the Great Western,
between Swindon and Didcot, Brunei took out his watch,
and after a short interval told me, ?for the last 7 minutes
we have gone 72 miles an hour.? But this speed is now
far eclipsed by the motor, reaching 100 miles an hour, but
with the sacrifice at that and at a far lower speed, of
many lives.
In Steam Navigation the progress is no less wonder-
ful. In 1840 the Gurnard paddle steamer covered 84 knots;
in 1889 the twin screw Teutonic 20 knots; and to-day the
Mauretania with a steam turbine of 115,000 blades drives
three shafts, and three screw propellers at 29 knots,
equal to 314 miles an hour.
Not content with his mastery of the sea surface, man
has dived into the depths with the Submarine. Our first
vessel was built and tested secretly by the Admiralty dur-
ing the Crimean War. Now, after many modifications it
is almost perfected, although still very difficult to secure
a perfect balance between the weight of the vessel and of
the water displaced.
The same onward progress is seen in water power it-
self, which we can now trace from the mill waterwheel
to the harnessing of the great Niagara, an achievement
in hydro-electric engineering, by which over three
quarters of a million horse power is generated for the use
of factories, extending as far as 75 miles from the source
?of supply.
During the last 30 years under the head of Chemis-
try, the number of known elements has very rapidly in
vreased; in three of the latest of these especially; the first
that of Argon, an inactive gas in the air but of great
?density, discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1892, and, also
quite independently of him and by a different formula, by
Professor Ramsay. The second is Helium, the lightest
of all the gases' except hydrogen, and discovered by
Frankland and Lockyer in 1808 under a particular line
in the solar spectrum, and which was also recognised in
the spectrum of Orion and other fixed stars.
The very dust in the air is a scientific marvel, as
shown by scientists in Paris, at Stockholm, and
by 41. Jung at Geneva, viz., that minute metallic


particles, iron especially, as also cobalt and copper
tloat in the air. lied there temporarily by atmospheric
agitation. Polished surfaces, dust tables in fact, have
been laid down and carefully adjusted so as to receive
the deposits of these dust cinders which have been care-
fully collected with a flat hair brush and examined in the
microscope. This dust ?these metallic particles?were
especially found on the snowflakes at Stockholm, in the
forests of Finland, and by Jung on the great St. Bernard
Pass, where the fresh white snow would in about half
an hour be covered with a sheet of red ferruginious
particles.
Last and highest of all is the science of Aerial Navi-
gation. It began with the gas balloon of Montgolfier,
succeeded by a great uncle of my own, Wyndham Sadler,
who as the first English Aeronaut made several success-
ful ascents at Bristol, at Oxford, and subsequently at
Liverpool, where his last ascent (as seen in an oil paint-
ing in our family) showing his descent into the
Irish Channel, where entangled in the car ropes,
he is being dragged along the sea but happily
saved from drowning by a fisherman?s craft. After
this terrestrial pursuits engaged his entire atten-
tion. These ascents of comparative amusement
were succeeded by those of deep scientific interest,
when between 1802 and 1860 Clashier, piloted by
Coxwell made 28 ascents resulting in valuable records
of the air, its temperature, its dryness, and currents, the
thickness of clouds, &c., &c. Following these and in our
own immediate time is the military balloon, and last of
all the airship, in which the problem that has impas-
sioned men for more than 3,000 years has at length been
solved and successfully by the Brazilian Santos Dumont
Cody, the Messrs. Wright Brothers of America, and by
Major Capper, R.E., who have made voyages of 50 to TO
miles sometimes against a strong wind. The terrible
possibilities of a first great battle between the world
powers each equipped with an aerial fleet are beyond all
conception, in the havoc nay the destruction of both
fleets and harbours and cities; and which Heaven fore-
fend.
And now in conclusion we have seen man made of
the earth yet making it subservient to his will, we have


seen man traversing the earth on the rail, the ocean with
the paddle, the screw, and the turbine, and descending
into the depths with the submarine. We have seen him
annihilating distance with the telegraph and the tele-
phone, and ascending upwards with the balloon and the
airship.
After this cometh the end: all these great dis-
coveries, these wondrous inventions must with every man
be succeeded by another and a last revelation described
by Charles Kingsley as ?the Great Secret,? when every-
thing must be left behind, the manifold works, the brain
that conceived them, and when the spirit unclogged by
the body will make its last and final ascent with the
speed of the lightning flash into the eternal space. Ke
it for us so to live life?s work here, that there it may be
ours to carry on some grander work in worlds unseen and
unknown.


TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN
EXPLORATION.
Thos. S. Reed, J.P.
Mr. T. S. Reed, the veteran Secretary of the Society
(who is in his ninety-third year), delivered an address on
the efforts of the Australian explorers during the period
ot the Society?s existence.
Exploration is a dominant faculty in each section
of the human family, for it relates' not only to the
discovery, but to circumstance, to every day life, where
it may take the form of curiosity in one branch, to the
desire of acquiring information in the other. And the
expansion of this latter faculty on the masculine side of
(xeation led evidently to outside developments, to the
exploration of new and untraversed regions far away
from limited and domestic environments.
And certainly it must be worthy of all acceptation
that few keener delights in life are to be met with than
those experienced by a first discoverer of anything
previously unknown to the rest of the human family!
and especially to the opening up of territory never yet
i rodden by the feet of white men; experiences only to
be acquired by an innate strength of purpose in'the
explorer, by a fixed determination in the face of great
difficulties to bring honour to the place of his birth *
This paper has a twofold purpose, and is the
outcome of a suggestion by Mr. W. J. Sowden at our
last Annual Meeting held on June 25th, 1000: viz., that
the 25th Anniversary of our Geographical Society would
be a fitting occasion, first, to make some illusions to the
explorations of John McDouall Stuart, whose jubilee of
the commencement of his far northern work in 1860 we
can now commemorate, and secondly to recount on this
anniversary the explorations which have been carried
out since the formation of this Society, as a supplement
to the able address on Australian Exploration which was
delivered by the late Sir Samuel Davenport at the
Inaugural Meeting of this Society on June 10th, 1885.


John McDouall stuart.
The year 1800 and two following years are probably
the most notable in the annals of exploration, and John
McDouall Stuart stands out in full prominence as the
one explorer by whom this high distinction was achieved.
He had commenced his training with Captain Sturt in
1844, which evidently implanted an eager desire to enter
the field of exploration on his own account.
In the first exploration he arrived at Lake Torrens
on June 22nd, 1858, after which he discovered and named
Chambers Creek, from which he made explorations in
the neighbourhood of Lake Gairdner, thence proceeding
to Fowler?s Bay, when half starved and with provisions
nearly exhausted they got to Streaky Bay, finally
reaching Thompson's Station at Mount Arden, thus
terminating his first expedition.
In April, 1859, Stuart made another start, when
Hergott, one of his companions, found the well-known
springs that bear his name; a place declared by medical
authorities, from its dryness, as specially suitable for
consumptive patients.
Stuart then crossed Chambers Creek, arriving at
the Davenport Range, after which he discovered a large
creek running through very gool country, which he called
the Neales. Following this down for some days he was
obliged to return through difficulties with his horses.
But the one desire of John McDouall Stuart was to
cross the Australian Continent from South to North, and
the South Australian Government had offered �2,000 to
the successful competitor. ,
And it was in March, 1800, that Stuart, with three
men and thirteen horses, made the first of his daring
attempts with this object in view, ultimately reaching
Lake Torrens and Lake Eyre, and after this discovering
and naming Chambers? Pillar. On the 9th of April he
discovered and named the Macdonnell Range, after the
then Governor of South Australia. He then came to a
high hill, which he named Central Mount Sturt, after
his old friend, Captain Sturt. It should be here said
that Stuart in each of his foregoing explorations was
equipped at the sole expense of Messrs. Chambers and
Finke.


But this first expedition had now to be relinquished
through difficulties with the Natives, the loss of many of
his horses, and the indisposition of Stuart and his
companions, and he turned homeward, reaching Brodie?s
camp at Hamilton Springs on the 2Gth of August. One
satisfactory result, however, had been 'obtained, for the
?eighteenth degree of latitude hade been reached, and he
had proved that the interior of Australia was not a stony
desert like that region visited by Sturt in 1845.
On January Ist, 1861, Stuart started on a second
expedition, but was again driven back through lack of
water for the horses and themselves, and returned in
safety to Adelaide about the end of the year.
Once again he made a third and final attempt to
traverse the continent from Adelaide along a central
line, and started on October 25th, 1861, better equipped,
and with an increased number in his party, which
included Mr. W. P. Auld and Mr. Heath Nash now
present.
They camped on the Roper River on the 25th June,
1862, and reached the coast on 24th July, when Thring
shouted out in triumph ?The sea, the sea.??
There, says Stuart, I stood?there I stood on the
shores of the Indian Ocean, when I washed my hands
and dipped my feet in the sea, there I stood with
unmeasured delight at having accomplished the great
object of the expedition.
They then returned to the valley where Stuart had
his initials cut on the largest tree in the vicinity
(4. M. I). S.); a tree which has since been found and
recognized, but which has unfortunately been destroyed
by fire.
Stuart then says ?I did not intend to put up my flag
until I arrived at the month of the Adelaide, but finding
the creeks so numerous and boggy I struck straight for
the coast, and here planted a flag which Chambers had
kindly given me." And lastly, along the greater part of
Stuart?s track the overland telegraph line has been
erected, an enduring monument to his indomitable
perseverance. 1 fl


But it had a sad ending, for Stuart's health, after
repeated attacks of illness, had completely broken down,
his sight had almost gone, his right hand had become
useless, and, quite unable to ride, he was slowly borne
along on a stretcher between two horses until they
reached Mount Margaret Station, from which, after
resting a little, he eventually reached Adelaide. He died
in England on June sth, 1866, and was buried in Kensal
Green Cemetery, where his sister erected a monument to
his memory.
< CENTRAL AUSTRALIAN EXPLORATION.
Mr. David Lindsay started from Hergott Springs in
October, 1885, when the course of the Finke River was
followed to the point where the river is lost in the sand
north-east of Dalhousie. He then directed his course to
the frontier of Queensland, which he crossed under 25-30
S. lat. From this he marched across a hitherto unex-
plored region to Charlotte Waters Station of the Trans-
continental Telegraph Line.
In February Lindsay continued his journey across
the eastern spurs of the MacDonnell Range to Lake
Nash, where he arrived in April. A survey was made of
the whole country traversed, and the course of the Finke
and Herbert Rivers accurately determined.
W. H. TIETKINS, F.R.G.S.
The lirst in the list of Australian explorers in the
beginning of the last quarter of a century is Mr. W. H.
Tietkins, who in 1880 took charge of the Central Austra-
lian Exploring Expedition, when he started from Ade-
laide to Bond Springs, 1,058 miles. He then went
onwards, leaving Bond Springs on March 11 to Glen
Helen and Mount Sender, to examine the hitherto un-
traversed country to the north-east of Lake Amadeus,
subsequently discovering and naming the Kintore Range,
to the north-west of Lake Macdonald, and also the
Bonython Ranges, to the south-east. On his return he
set at rest the exaggerated ideas in existence as to the
?extent of Lake Amadeus, as he passed through 60 miles
of country supposed to be contained in its area without
seeing a vestige of water.
Mr. Tietkins ? arrived at Charlotte Waters on his
return on August 15, and brought with him to Adelaide
J Ji 11


a large number of mineral and botanical specimens, and
an interesting relic, now in onr rooms, of the overgrowth
removed from a tree "blazed? by W. C. Gosse in his ex-
ploring expedition in 1873.
THE ELDER SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION.
In 1801 the late Sir Thomas Elder. K.C.M.G., who
had already done so much in the cause of exploration,
projected the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition with
the view of completing that portion of Australia hitherto
untraversed.
The expedition, led by Mr. David Lindsay, started
from Warrina on May 2, 1891, pushing on to Cootanoo-
rinna Station, which they left on May 12, with the view
of exploring the unknown regions in South and Western
Australia, and a large tract of country west of the Trans-
continental Telegraph Line and the Victoria River. The
expedition proceeded via Fort Mueller to Mount Squires,
and then onwards to Queen Victoria?s Spring, where,
being disappointed at not finding water, Mr. Lindsay had
to push on to Fraser?s Range, from which he proceeded
to Hampton Plains in order to complete as far as possible
the examination of the first block of the territory he was
instructed to traverse. But owing to the continued
drought Mr. Lindsay took the expedition via the Yilgarn
Goldfields to the Murchison, where there was both feed
and water for the camels and provisions for themselves.
During this march the scientific members sent in their
resignation, and Mr. Lindsay was instructed to return to
Adelaide and consult with the Council of the Geogra-
phical Society. One important item in the expedition
was an intimation in Camp 73 of the existence of gold in
hit. 31.14,
Before leaving Perth Mr. Lindsay, at the request of
the Council, instructed Mr. L. A. Wells to explore a block
of country between lat. 20 deg. and 28 deg. S. and long.
119 deg. and 124 deg. E. He started from Anneen Depot
on February 18, 1892, and completed his explorations on
April 5, 1892. It is recorded that a total of 4,279 miles
were traversed by the expedition, of which 2,745 miles
were through unexplored country.
Owing to the differences that occurred in the party
an investigation was made by the Council of the Society,


and Mr. Lindsay was exonerated from the charges pre-
ferred against, him by the members of the expedition, but
as Sir Thomas Elder, in a letter addressed to the Council,
decided to bring the expedition to a close, the Council
acceded to his wishes.
THE HORN SCIENTIFIC EXPLORING
EXPEDITION.
CHARLES WINNECKE.
An expedition of great interest was equipped by W.
A. Horn, Esq., in 1894, the objects of which were first a
scientific examination of the country from Oodnadatta to
the MacDonnell Ranges, and the collection of specimens
illustrative of the fauna, flora, and geological structure,
and mineralogical resources of that region, and the illus-
tration by photography of any remarkable natural fea-
tures of the country traversed. Secondly, the securing
of photographs of the aborigines in their primitive state,
and of their mural paintings in caves and on rocks, and
the collection of information as to their manners, cus-
toms, and languages.
The general survey of- the country was undertaken
by the well known surveyor, the late Mr. Charles Win-
necke, as leader of the expedition, and the scientific
branches by Professors E. C. Stirling. Ralph Tate, and
Baldwin Spencer, who. with Messrs. Bell. \\ att, Heart-
land. and Mr. Horn himself, comprised the members of
the expedition.
The time at their disposal was limited to three
months through the inability of the professors to be
absent any longer from their duties.
The expedition left Oodnadatta on May 5, 1894, and
travelling northward they came to the Goyder River,
where they hoped to find tin* country admirably suited to
scientific examination, but almost the contrary proved
to be the case, as a succession of dry seasons had resulted
in a great scarcity of animal and vegetable life, and our
collections suffered, accordingly. From the Goyder a
five days' excursion was made to the west, terminating at
Engoordina, on the. Finke River, where numerous tent-
shaped hills and ranges were discovered and correctly
mapped.


From Enj>oordina the expedition proceeded to Idra-
cowra, passing through a detached range of tabletopped
hills, then passing on through Henbury to the Janies
Ranges, where on the plains between these ranges wen 1
seen splendid grasses growing in rich profusion, includ-
ing the Mitchell grass of Queensland. They then passed
on to the Peterman Creek, and James, Levi, and (Jills
Ranges, where numerous specimens were procured for
the petrological collection.
Low sandstone ridges then occurred, extending to
the west and beyond Laurie?s Creek, where some perfect
specimens of rare fossils were obtained.
They then took a northerly course, and visited seve-
ral mountains of the MacDonnell Ranges, where a most
unusual geological feature was noted. The ranges here
consist of apparently isolated mountains joined by low
ridges and interspersed with well-grassed plains. Here
for the first time since leaving Oodnadatta metalliferous
rocks were found, and the prospectors diligently ex-
amined various localities.
On June 1(5 they arrived at I leering Creek, and two
days later entered a remarkable valley, with wall-like
ranges, which Winnecke named Merceine Valley, an
escarpment extending in an unbroken line for 20 miles.
On June 21 they reached Glen Helen, Mount Sender,
and other mountains, which were correctly charted, and
their exact heights determined. After this, arriving at
the Finke Gorge, in the Finke River, they passed south-
erly, reaching Hermannsburg Mission Station on July 2,
where an extended stay was made for a thorough exami-
nation by the geologists and prospectors of the adjacent
country, when valuable additions were made to the seve-
ral collections.
Alice Springs was reached on July 15, from which
three days later the expedition left on its return journey,
when they travelled southward through splendidly
grassed country, arriving at Oodnadatta on August 5.
During this three months' period large collections were
made in many of the departments of science, and 27,000
square miles of country w T ere correctly mapped in detail.
Although the aborigines encountered were singularly
few, every possible opportunity of studying their habits


and customs was embraced, and much interesting infor-
mation concerning them was gathered, and many native
curios and relics were acquired.
Nothing could exceed the zeal which was shown in
the general work of investigation and collection, and the
journey from start to finish was accomplished without a
single mishap. The scientific results of this expedition
have been published by Mr. Horn in four volumes.
THE CALVERT EXPEDITION.
L. A. WELLS.
An expedition equipped by Albert F. Calvert, Esq..
F.R.G.S., London, led by Mr. L. A. Wells, the South Aus-
tralian surveyor (his cousin, Mr. C. F. Wells, being'
second in command) was dispatched in June, 189(5, for
the purpose of exploring the remaining blanks of Aus-
tralia.
Starting on June 13, 1890, Wells arrived at Salt
Lake Way a month later, and then pushing on to the
Lindsay Gordon Lagoon, he arrived at the Harry John-
stone Water, when, finding an ample supply of camel
feed and water, he formed a'depot, from which he went
200 miles northward, where, on September 29, he found
and named Surprise Well. From this Wells pressed on
still northward till he came to a well which he named
Separation Well, as here the party separated, C. F. Wells
and G. L. Jones intending to examine the country in a
north west direction, and then to rejoin the caravans at
Joanna Springs.
The leader in the meantime went northwards
through high sand ridges, dense spinifex, and scanty sup-
plies of water, in one place getting only (55 buckets of
water in 36 hours? baling?and all this in extreme heat,
losing three of his camels, and having to abandon the
whole of his equipments (save a few absolute necessaries)
and the scientists? collections.
In this emergency Wells was obliged to push on for
known water at the Fitzroy, which he, with his party,
at last reached on November 7, with the remaining
camels at their last gasp.
The leader then s'tarted soon after with his party to
look for the two comrades who he hoped had succeeded


iii finding Joanna Springs, when, on January 10, 181)7, he
was forced to return unsuccessful. Early in March he
renewed the search, and at this time, on April IJ, he
found some few articles belonging to the lost men in the
possession of the natives.
A third time Wells started, on May 13, with two
members of the Police Force (Inspector Ord and Trooper
Nicholson), and some native trackers, and at last found
some natives.whom they induced to guide them to a spot
where, on May 27, they discovered the two bodies, Wells
and Jones, lying among the spinifex and sand; a satchel,
a compass, G. L. Jones's journal, and a notebook with a
piece of paper addressed to his father and mother, stating
that after the separation they had gone west-north-west
for five days, where, through the intense heat, they only
had two quarts of water left, when they became very
weak, and unable to follow the camels, who had wan-
dered away, and that he did not think they could last
very much longer.
Nothing remained now for the leader but to tele-
graph the sad tidings to Adelaide, when arrangements
were made by Mr. Inspector Ord for the removal of the
remains to Adelaide, where, on July IS, the two comrades
were accorded a public funeral ?a most impressive cere-
mony. amidst a large and representative gathering.
The flag that then covered the coffin, inscribed ?Com-
rades,? was afterwards presented to the Geographical
Society by the Executors of the late Air. A. T. Magarey,
who had?acted on behalf of Air. Calvert from the first
inception of the expedition.
HONOURABLE DAVID CARNEGIE.
One of the most notable Australian explorations was
that of the Honourable David Carnegie, fourth son of the
Earl of Southesk; who. with a party of only three and a
black boy, left Coolgardie on July 1), 1896, intending to
cross the great sandy desert from south to north, a work
which, in the face of great difficulties, he not only
achieved in safety, but also returned by another route to
his starting point.
In his upward route he passed by Alenzies and Sandy
Creek to a spring of permanent water in a cave which he


named Empress Spring, in honour of Queen Victoria;
then arriving at Maepherson's Pillar on September 1.
After this he crossed many sand ridges to some neigh-
bouring wells, sometimes marching IS miles in a day
through plains of spinifex. He then took a northerly
course to Margaret River, where, by a sad gun accident,
he lost his friend, Charlie Stansmore, casting a gloom
over the rest of the expedition. He arrived at his
northerly point Hall?s Creek, Kimberley, on December
4. after a journey of 1,413 miles, counting deviations.
Here he heard of the sad disaster to the Calvert ex-
pedition, and generously offered to put his camels and
party at Mr. Well?s disposal, and do anything he could
to help. But after some weeks had elapsed, and hearing
that two search parties were in the field, he left on the
return journey on March 22. 1807, when passing Sturt s
Creek for Mounts Wilson and Elphinstone, he got to
Lake Macdonald on May 1(5. and then on to Woodhouse
Lagoon, reaching Coolgardie in August, after an absence
of thirteen months, a notable journey indeed, considering
the smallness of his party and the many difficulties In 1
encountered, some of his . camels proving fierce and
almost unmanageable, and having sometimes to haul a
reluctant camel over the sand ridges.
The Honourable David Carnegie had the explorer's
ardent spirit, which would have led him to further contri-
butions to Australian geography, but for his unfortunate
death at Lakoja, in Nigeria, where he fell beneath a
shower of poisoned arrows, one of which pierced his
thigh. He died fifteen minutes after he was hit, on
November 27, 1900.
ALLAN A. DAVIDSON.
FURTHER EXPLORATIONS IN CENTRAL
AUSTRALIA.
The Central Australian Exploration Syndicate was
formed in 1898 for the purpose of exploring a large block
of country in Central and Northern Australia, and Mr.
Allan Davidson was appointed as leader.
The exploration extended over a period of three
years from 1898 to 1901. Two years were occupied in
proving the country east of the Transcontinental Tele-


graph line, between Barrow's Creek and Tennant's Creek
Telegraph Station, a block containing over 11,000 square
miles, when many goldbearing areas were discovered,
some of which would be considered very payable if the
country were made accessible, as Mr. Davidson stated,
when the Transcontinental Railway comes into existence.
On the completion of the two years? work Mr. David-
son was appointed by the London principals of the expe-
dition as leader of a second and western expedition,
which left Adelaide on May 5, 1900.
The farthest western point reached was longitude
128 deg. 51 min., hit. 20 deg. 0 min., when a range of hills
was discovered which r. Davidson named Gardiner.
AH the hills and ranges were thoroughly tested for mine-
rals, but they were not of a payable nature so as to make
the expedition a success, and the expedition returned to
Barrow?s ('reek in September, after an absence of nearly
five months.
R. T. MAURICE.
31 r. Richard Thilwell 3laurice was for some years
engaged in exploration work in the desert country to the
north of the Nullabor Plains, and in 1900 he organized a
party which, starting from Fowler's Bay, visited the
Rawlinson Ranges, in Western Australia, and returned
by way of the Mann and Tomkinson Ranges. This was
followed b} T an expedition from Fowler's Bay, on the
south coast, to Wyndham, on the north coast, through
the desert country in the region of the Western Austra-
lian boundary. To Mr. Maurice we are indebted for
the mapping out of a large area of unknown country, and
for our knowledge of many of the available waters in
some of the most inhospitable parts of Australia. 31r.
Maurice patriotically bore the sole expense of these ex-
peditions. and the resulting collections of native imple-
ments, &c., were always generously placed at the dis-
posal of our Museum.
BARCLAY AND 3IcPHERRON.
One small area of country yet untraversed remained
in Central Australia, a range of sandhills about 300 miles
long by 200 miles wide, north of hit. 20, and bounded by
the Finke, Plenty, and 31arshall Rivers, and partly by


the MacDonnell Ranges, and an expedition to exploit it,
was equipped by Mr. Ronald McPherson, assisted by the
S.A. Government with the loan of camels, the leader
being Captain H. V. Barclay, the well-known Australian
surveyor. The party, which included Captain Langley,
D.5.0., left Oodnadatta on July 24, 1904, and got into the
sand ridges after leaving Anacoora Bore, 250 deg. 50
min. 10 sec. S., 135 deg. 39 min. 40 sec. E., and there
found that these sand ranges ran like waves of the sea,
varying from 70 to 200 ft. in height when they took their
course in the valleys, once travelling 120 miles between
the sandhills, when they saw nothing but the sky.
After passing them they pushed on to the MacDonnell
Ranges, and thence to the Hale, Plenty, and Hay Rivers;
but on account of the shortness of water and great heat
they were obliged to travel by night, resting by day, and
eventually returned to Adelaide on December 5 of the
same year.
And now, while recounting the work of these ex-
plorers, we cannot forget their predecessors, and that
these now before us form the last links of a long chain
of explorers with whose very work the last century
began. And it is surely fitting for us on this occasion,
to complete, to fill up the whole interval, and to include
in full remembrance the life history of all these great
founders of our Australian Colony, especially remember-
ing the infinite cost and endurance and self-sacrifice in
which these foundations were laid.
In the full energy of life they were mastered and up-
held and sustained, and carried along by noble and con-
straining forces within; and a grand tragic life, indeed,
was theirs, with each of them the one object in view?
rhe founding in sections of a new world, a foundation
stone, with each laid, not in the sunlight of a city before
an admiring multitude, but laid ofttimes in the impene-
trable gloom of the desert bush. Other great colonies
had their founders; in ages past and gone, the Athenians
had their Theseus, the Romans their Romulus, the Scan
dinavians their Odin, but surely we also can point to our
Cook and Flinders, and Oxley and Phillip; our Sturt and
Mitchell, and Eyre and Leichhardt, our Bourke and Wills
and McDouall Stuart and Forrest, our Giles and Car-
negie, and Wells and Jones, our Lindsay and Maurice,


who covered an area in this great colony infinitely
greater than the whole aggregate of Athens and Rome
and Scandinavia; and each of these our explorers laying
a foundation for himself, for every mile they discovered,
every new area they brought to light, was a new step
towards the building up of a great people, some of them
indeed opening up channels through which the golden
and silverv streams are now flowing as the very life blood
of succeeding generations.
But at what a cost! Who of us who live at home at
ease can fully appreciate the process, the heroic endur-
ance through which those great missions were accom-
plished. in shipwrecks often, in perils on the sea, in perils
in the bush, in hunger and thirst, and in weariness and
watchings often by night and by day.
With longing yearning hearts those explorers oft-
times looked into the black darkness of death, striving to
see some spark of light, but in vain, a light in which we
now live of a great structure growing higher and still
higher; a light of which they in spirit may now be with
us. fully conscious, in silent yet triumphant witness of
1 hese glorious results of their labours; fully conscious, it,
may be, and listening with us to the tribute we are one
and all now offering with willing hearts to their life his-
tory. a tribute based upon the conviction that the results
of each and of every exploration have been an essential
element not only in our welfare as a colony, but in the
welfare and national progress of the whole world.
