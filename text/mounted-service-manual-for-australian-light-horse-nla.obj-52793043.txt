PREFACE.
Important as the dismounted fire action of mounted
troops has always been held to be, the recent improvement
in fire-arms, and above all the introduction of smokeless
powder, has given the fire action of mounted men a power
which, in future, must materially modify, if it does not
revolutionise, the tactics of the field of battle and the
strategical combinations of a campaign.
Tactical Value.
The long and effective range of modern rifles, the flat
trajectory of the bullets, and their deadly precision have,
on the one hand, enormously increased the power of defence
against direct attack, while, on the other hand, the in-
visibility of the enemy, due to the use of smokeless powder,
and the consequent difficulty of locating his position or
estimating his numbers have increased the difficulties of the
offence a hundredfold. It is now easy for a few mounted
men, who are handled well and witu confidence, to hold
in check a relatively large force; while equally in the
offence a body of horsemen led with dash and vigour are
capable of achieving great results by the sudden capture of
an important strategical or tactical point, by outflanking
the enemy’s position, and even by attacking it in reverse.
When the great area over which modern battles will extend,
the vast range of artillery fire, the accuracy and deadly
effect of modern fire power are taken into consideration, it


will be understood that extreme mobility and the power of
covering distances at a rapid pace by the advanced bodies
of troops become imperative. It should be always borne
in mind that in modern battles infantry once committed to
an attack cannot be withdrawn except by loss of initial
energy, and of morale. No commander, therefore, would
willingly develop an attack upon an enemy whose presence
is only revealed by a shower of bullets at long range and by
fire from unseen artillery.
Having in view, therefore, the distances to be covered, the
advanced troops, whether utilised as a screen or as scouts and
patrols, must necessarily be mounted. The use of infantry on
foot for such purposes becomes, under the changed conditions
of war, slow, cumbersome, and ineffective. It is more
necessary now than at any previous period to push forward
the mounted troops, who, by their rapid manceuvring and
by their far-reaching flank movements, can gain intelligence
of the enemy by compelling him to display his strength and
make evident his position.
The preliminary part, therefore, of every skirmish and
of every engagement must largely depend upon the action
of the mounted troops. Mounted troops who are trained
to fight on foot are peculiarly adapted to the requirements
of this service, and the value of such troops has been
enhanced by the experiences recentlj obtained in South
Africa to an extent that bids fair to be little short of
revolutionary.
Provided that the character of the country is suitable,
there must unquestionably be occasions when a well-timed,
daringly conceived, and gallantly executed charge of cavalry
will be as conclusive as ever; for example, upon an infantry
demoralised by a long and overwhelming fire action with
consequent loss of life. It is also assumed that for opera


tions against an enemy possessing cavalry trained upon the
European model, it will be as desirable as heretofore to
possess a cavalry force trained to shock tactics and to
offensive action mounted. It must be remembered, how-
ever, that a charge, to be effective, must be delivered by
troops thoroughly trained and suitably horsed. The co-
hesion indispensable for a successful charge, and the well-
broken charger without which neither lance nor sword can
be effectively handled, can only be obtained after long and
careful training, not only of men but also of horses, such
training, in fact, as is only possible for troops after long
embodiment and continuous instruction. This role of the
mounted service is dealt with in Cavalry Drill, 1898.
Although opportunities for the shock tactics of the past
few centuries will be of rare occurrence, still good and bold
horsemen, ably and intelligently led, who are capable of
developing the power of modern fire-arms to the highest
point, will undoubtedly exercise a controlling effect in future
war. The present Manual deals with the organisation,
drill, tactics and strategy of this last-mentioned description
of mounted troops.
Simple as it may appear in some respects to raise large
numbers of mounted troops valuable in the manner de-
scribed in Great Britain and her Colonies, it is only by a
leadership of a very high order on the part of the officers
on the one hand, and by a carefully-devised organisation on
the other, that such troops can be used with effect or be
maintained in efficiency.
The very highest degree of knowledge, zeal and experience
is required from all officers to enable them to win the con-
fidence of their men by skilled leadership. Knowledge is
power, and in order to obtain the best results the principle
must be always maintained that he who leads must be he


who instructs. It is a well-known fact that men in the
mass are much what an organisation or system makes them.
It is imperative, therefore, that the greatest possible care
and the most constant and earnest thought should be
bestowed by all officers upon those principles of drill and
organisation which are required to maintain mounted troops
effective in the field, as apart from that show and display
which is so frequently mistaken for real military efficiency.
Mounted Troops fulfilling the foregoing conditions are
divided into two categories :
I. Horsemen trained to fight on foot, i.e., Light Horse.
11. Infantry soldiers temporarily provided with increased
powers of locomotion, i.e., Mounted Infantry.
I. Light Horse, etc., are required, («) to fight on foot,
both in the offensive and defensive; (6) to perform the
duties classed under the head of “ Information,” viz., recon-
noitring and screening ; and (c) to afford “protection ” from
surprise for all bodies of troops, both halted and on the
march.
Mounted troops of the description given above, who are
capable of fulfilling this rdle with success, must be daring
and bold horsemen, careful horse-masters, and.must possess
at once that cohesion and individuality which are only
begotten of a sound organisation and of true discipline.
They must be prepared when mounted to rush a position
held by the enemy, and under possible but exceptional
circumstances they may even be called upon when mounted
to make a sudden onslaught upon the enemy.
11. Mounted Infantry are required to perform only
the duties pertaining to infantry, who are temporarily
provided with the increased means of mobility or rapid
locomotion. They may be divided into two categories ;


(a) Mounted Infantry organised in small units, which
act as integral parts of the infantry battalion and of
the infantry brigade to which they belong.
( h) Mounted Infantry concentrated and organised into
large units, so as to form adjuncts to an independent
mounted force for the performance of purely infantry
service.
For the successful performance of these duties, it is
necessary that the personnel should be carefully selected
infantry soldiers who have been thoroughly trained in all
respects as such. They must be good shots, intelligent, and
possess a hardy physique. Provided that the men thus
selected are efficient soldiers, well led by experienced officers,
and properly organised, it is not difficult to give the training
in riding, horse management, drill and tactics which will
enable them to carry out the limited amount of recon-
noitring and scouting duties required when acting mounted
with infantry, or, when co-operating with an independent
mounted force, to be at hand for the performance of such
infantry duties as they may be called upon to carry out
when acting with them.
Experience has also shown that Mounted Infantry mayi
after prolonged training and practice in the field, be utilised
for the same purposes as those mounted troops referred to
under the first heading.
Strategical Value.
Not only, however, has the tactical value of mounted
troops increased as already shown, but the very favourable
conditions for the defence, which has been commented upon,
make the strategical value of mounted troops in the future
as great, if not greater, than the tactical. A strategical
attack upon an enemy’s flank and rear by a rapid and far


reaching march will compel the evacuation of a position
which it may be impossible to attack in front. A boldly-
conceived and swift descent upon the enemy’s line of com-
munications or upon some temporarily isolated portion of
the enemy’s force may be productive of immense results,
and bring panic and demoralisation upon the enemy’s
troops.
Mounted troops who are to play such a strategical part
must be capable of a self-sustained and self-contained effort.
They must be organised for independent action, and must
include mounted troops (trained to fight on foot) and
artillery, with a proportion of those departments with-
out which no body of troops can remain efficient in the field,
viz., Engineers (for engineer services and field telegraph),
Medical Staff Corps and Army Service Corps.
The force fulfilling these requirements must be a com-
plete fighting unit and be capable of dealing in dis-
mounted action with an enemy’s infantry in a manner
which no cavalry, organised and trained as modern European
cavalry, can ever hope to do.
The value of mounted troops for strategical purposes in
war is in direct ratio to their rapidity of movement, and
the mobility of such troops must be necessarily dependent
upen the quality of their horses, and to the thoroughness
and efficiency of their disciplineand organisation.
There is no branch of an army which requires such
careful and laborious organisation and management as a
mounted force. The strength and power of a mounted
corps is that of its weakest link or component part; for
example, with bad saddlery the highest training of the men
and the most perfect quality of the horses are of small
value. It cannot be too strongly impressed upon all con-
cerned that men and horses upon service can only be
maintained effective in the field by the most complete


discipline, and by the most laboured organisation of every
minute detail.
This Manual has been framed to meet the foregoing
requirements so far as can be done within the compass of so
small a work.

ORGANISATION, DRESS, AND EQUIPMENT.
ORGANISATION.
The principles of organisation essential for mounted
troops are assured by the squadron system, i.e., that the
squadron shall be maintained as the tactical and adminis-
trative unit, capable of independent service at all times,
The squadron should be divided into four troops, each com-
plete in itself, and capable, in its turn, of independent
service. The troop is further divided into permanent
sections of four men with their four horses, one of whom
will be selected as section leader.
Each troop should be composed of men raised in the same
locality, or, if detachments from existing corps, of men
belonging to the same regiment or battalion. The per-
manent sections similarly should be made up by men who
live in the same vicinity in civil life, or who have some
association in common.
Men and horses should never be transferred from their
original troops, or even sections, except for unavoidable
reasons. Men and horses should maintain at all times
their relative positions in the ranks, in barracks or in
bivouac, in stables or in horse lines. Men will be permitted
within limits to choose their own sections.
It will bo found that the permanent section or comrade
system, if carefully and intelligently adhered to in principle
no less than in letter, will produce the highest and best
M.S.M. I)


form of discipline. Men will naturally fight better and
with more confidence among those whom they know and
trust rather than among strangers. Self-respect and good
conduct are more assured among men who are bound to-
gether by ties of comradeship and of previous acquaintance
than among men who are strangers to one another.
The principle of comradeship once established goes far to
supply the discipline which makes united action possible,
and therefore produces that cohesion, or mutual reliance,
and that instinctive confidence which insures individuality
or self-reliance.
Confusion becomes less probable, and by the comrade
system thus initiated much of the work of the non-commis-
sioned officers is obviated—men in the same section per-
forming small offices for one another, which under other
circumstances must be carried out as a fatigue by men
specially detailed.
A regiment or battalion may be formed by associating
together from two to four squadrons.
A regimental staff in proportion will then be required.
A. brigade may be formed of from two to four regiments.
The establishment (1) of a squadron ; (2) its sub-division
into troops; and (3) the regimental staff for a regiment of
four squadrons are inserted.
It is not possible that squadrons will at all times turn
out at their full establishment, and commanding officers,
therefore, will be guided by the following general rules;—
There should never, if possible, be more than six sections,
i.e., 24 men in a troop for purposes of drill or manoeuvre.
Troops should never be broken up if it can be avoided,
but always kept intact as a unit.
Permanent sections should be preserved intact at all
times as far as possible, but if in consequence of the absence
of certain individuals they cease to be so temporarily, the


sections thus reduced in numbers should be broken up and
distributed among the others. It is a good plan for the
sections to be known by the name of their section leader
rather than by any particular number.
Non-commissioned officers of and above the rank of
sergeant, the artificers and trumpeters should be serrefiles,
and not included in the section system.
The squadron leader is solely and entirely responsible for
the instruction, drill, equipment, and interior economy of
his squadron, and for the training of his horses, their
condition, and the shoeing, subject to the direct supervision
and command of the officer commanding the regiment.
It is the duty of the regimental staff to afford the
squadron leader whatever assistance he may require in
carrying out his duties, but they will in no respect interfere
with his performance of them. Thus the adjutant may
assist, if requested, in the drill and tactical instruction of
the squadron, the quarter-master in matters of interior
economy, and the veterinary surgeon in horse manage-
ment, &c.
Similarly the troop leader will be responsible for his
troop, subject to the command and supervision of the
squadron leader, and the section leader will in like manner
be responsible for the three men and four horses of his
section.
The above system of decentralisation gives each officer
and man a distinct and is calculated there-
fore to create and foster that individual action which is of
such vital consequence in modern war, and which tends
further to bring out the best military qualities of all
ranks.

ORDER OE DRESS AND EQUIPMENT.
Remarks.
The following list of articles of field kit for officers and
men with their distribution are published as a guide to
commanding officers and all concerned. The distribution
herewith laid down is that authorised for mounted troops
provided with the regulation cavalry pattern saddle, adopted
to a cavalry charger under the most favourable conditions
of service. It is obvious that the weight carried is prohibi-
tive to small horses, or for horses who have lost condition
upon active service.
Commanding officers must, therefore, use their utmost
endeavour upon active service to reduce the weight carried
by their horses, and must be prepared to take the field with
the minimum weight consistent with efficiency, the balance
being carried in the regimental or squadron transport, or
left at the base,
It is not deemed expedient to lay down any hard and fast
rule in this matter, as the condition' of every campaign,
and the equipment of every corps varies in a greater or less
degree.

PART I—DRILL.—TRAINING OF THE
SOLDIER ON FOOT.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
The primary objects of all drill are to secure discipline,
mobility, cohesion, and individuality on the part of the
soldier, upon the field of battle.
Discipline is the intelligent subordination and prompt
obedience to the will of a superior, without which any body
of troops is but a mob of armed men.
Cohesion is the instinct of united action, which is secured
by mutual reliance on one another, and by obedience to the
will of a superior. It is this quality which enables men to
be worked in masses.
Individuality is the utmost development of the self-
reliance and intelligence of the individual soldier, which
enables him to act with effect, and upon his own personal
initiative in the scattered formations necessary under
modem conditions of war.
It is a well-known fact that men in a mass are much
what an organisation makes them, and it will be found that
the squadron system, explained under the head of Organisa-
tion, and the development of the ties of comradeship which
this system fosters, will go far to provide that discipline,
cohesion, and individuality, which are the fundamental
requirements of modern tactics.
The squadron will therefore be as carefully maintained
as the tactical unit on the drill ground, as it is or-
ganised as the administrative unit in quarters. It will
be found that exactitude of movement, steadiness on
parade, and discipline when acting in large bodies, will to
a very large extent be ensured by this system, without


recourse to a long and monotonous routine of rigid drill,
and of meaningless parade movements.
Having the foregoing three objects in view, the drill
herein laid down, both mounted and dismounted, is based
upon the squadron column in single rank. Simplicity and
rapidity are all important factors in the handling of mounted
troops, and the single rank System provides both.
The single rank drill can be learnt with the greatest
facility. The cumbersome movements for maintaining a
rear rank in its position relative to the front rank are
obviated, and a far greater rapidity and flexibility of move-
ment is ensured. The squadron column— i.e,, the squadron
in columns of four ranks spread over a
wide and deep area, and is capable of being compressed and
expanded with the utmost rapidity, either to suit the ground,
or in accordance with the density of fire. Each rank is at
the same time intact and separately commanded.
With the development of the individuality of the soldier,
however, there is always the fear lest the training which
produces the instinct of that steadiness, and of that unthink-
ing obedience in critical moments, which are the proud
traditions of British soldiers, may be neglected. It is as
necessary as ever to have the means of exacting, when
necessary, that stern and unyielding discipline of the battle-
field, which keeps troops steady and in hand at the moment
of greatest peril, and enables a loader to assume the offensive
or to carry out a counter stroke. These qualities are
especially required of mounted troops fighting on foot.
Care should therefore be taken to ensure that troops, when
called to “ attention,” maintain the utmost steadiness and
immobility. The attitude of “ attention,” which teaches
steadiness and complete control by a leader, is very trying,
especially to partially-trained troops ; men will consequently
be kept standing at attention for as short a time as possible.


It will be noted that troops drilled upon the single rank
system have no front or rear in the sense of those terms in
the double rank drill. The confusion and want of flexibility
arising from the latter is therefore avoided. The front is,
generally speaking, the direction in which the enemy is
supposed to be. In the event of theserrefiles happening to
be in front, and in the event of it being desirable that the
troop leaders should resume their normal position the order
will be given by the Commanding Officer—“ leaders change ”
—when the troop leaders and serrefiles will exchange places
by moving round the flanks of their troops.
A.
SQUAD DRILL.
Sec. 1. General Rules.
I.
1. The object of the exercises contained in Parti is to fit
the untrained man to take his place in the ranks of his
squadron for field training.
2. Battles are won by co-operation, and the co-operation
of numbers cannot be secured unless every officer and man
is perfectly acquainted with his dutier, has acquired the
habit of prompt and implicit obedience to the commands of
a superior, and, at the same time, is capable of acting on his
own judgment and accustomed to use his wits. The man,
therefore, should be encouraged to concentrate all his
energies on the exercise he is carrying out, to move as
smartly as possible, and to stand perfectly still when wait-
ing the next word of command. When every individual is
intent on doing his duty, and knows how to do it, training
and discipline are satisfactory.


3. The instructor must be clear, firm, and concise in
giving his directions. He must be patient, making allow-
ance for the different capacity of the men whom he is train-
ing ; and always bearing in mind that careful individual
instruction is the best means of developing the intelligence,
and therefore the foundation of military efficiency.
4. The instructor, who will invariably carry a rifle if the
squad is receiving rifle instruction, will teach as much as
possible by illustration, either performing the movements
himself or causing them to be performed by a trained man,
placed facing the squad. He will be careful, in order to
stimulate the intelligence and interest of the untrained
men, to explain clearly, in simple terms, the reason of
every movement and formation, and their application on
service.
5. Instructors should be encouraged, in giving the details
of the different movements, to use their own words. So
long as the instruction is clearly understood by the men, it
is quite immaterial whether the phrasing of this Manual is
adhered to.
6. When first taught his positions, the untrained man
should be properly placed by the instructor; when more
advanced, he should not be touched, but made to correct
himself when admonished. He should not be kept too
long at any one exercise. Squad drill should be inter-
mixed with instruction in the handling of the rifle and
with physical training, and close order drill with skir-
mishing.
7. Short and frequent drills are preferable to long lessons,
which exhaust the attention both of the instructor and man.
Men should be moved on progressively from squad to squad
according to their merit, so that the quick intelligent
soldier may not be kept back by men of inferior capacity.


To arrive as soon as possible at the first squad should be
made an object of ambition to the young soldier.
Words of Command.
11.
1. Every command must be distinctly pronounced and
sufficiently loud to be heard by all concerned.
2. Every command that consists of one word must be
preceded by a caution. This caution, or cautionary part of
a command, must be given deliberately and distinctly ; the
last or executive part, which, in general, should consist
of only one word or syllable, must be given sharply; as
Company — Halt, Half Right — Turn. A pause will invari-
ably be made between the caution and the executive word.
3. When the last word of a caution is the signal for any
preparatory movement, it will be given as an executive word,
and separated from the rest of the command by a pause : thus
Right — Form, Quick — March, as though they were two
separate commands, each with its caution and executive
word.
4. When the men are in motion, executive words must
be completed as they are commencing the pace which will
bring them to the spot on which the command has to be
executed. The caution, therefore, must be commenced
accordingly.
5. Young officers and non-commissioned officers will be
frequently practised in giving words of command, and they
should always, even when on fatigue duty, bear in mind
the obligation of setting an example of soldierly smartness,
in this as in all else, to those beneath them. Slovenly and
indistinct words of command result in slackness and hesita-
tion on the part of the men.


6. The cautions and commands in this Manual are, as a
rule, given with regard to one flank only, but the same
principle applies equally to movements to the other flank,
which should also be practised.
The words printed in italics in the margin are the com-
mands to be given by the instructor.
Drill by Signal.
111.
1. All exercises of movement, except ceremonial, will be
practised both by word of command and by signal, the
whistle being used to attract attention. Both command
and signal are to be used during the same exercise, in order
that the soldier may be equally alert and exact under both
modes of conveying orders. When drilling by signal, the
instructor will see that the soldiers look at once at the
commander on the whistle sounding, and remain looking at
him until the executive signal is given.
For Signals, &c., vide Part 111., Sec. 4.
SQUAD DRILL, WITH INTERVALS.
Sec. 2. Formation of Squads.
1. A few men will be placed in single rank at arm’s
length apart; while so formed, they will be termed a squad
with intervals.
2. Untrained men will, in the first instance, be placed by
the instructor without any dressing; when they have
learned to dress, as directed in 5, they will be taught to
fall in, as above described, and then to dress and to correct
their intervals. After they have been instructed as far as
20, they may fall in as directed in 21.


3, Men formed into a squad will be directed to observe
the relative places they hold with each other; while resting
between the exercises they wilt be permitted to fall, out and
move about; they will be instructed on the words Fall in
to fall in as they stood at first. This should be constantly
practised.
Untrained men will be instructed singly as well as
together in all exercises as far as 20.
Sec. 3. Position of the Soldier.
The exact squareness of the shoulders and body to the
front is the first principle of the position of a soldier. The
arms should hang easily from the shoulder, elbows to the
rear; the fingers together, slightly bent, and their tips
touching the thigh lightly, behind the seam of the trousers;
the hips drawn back, and the chest advanced, but without
constraint. The heels must be in line and closed; the
knees well braced back ; the toes turned out so that the feet
may form an angle of 45 degrees; the weight of the body
on the fore part of the feet; the head is to be held erect;
but not thrown back ; the chin to be slightly drawn in,
and the eyes looking straight to the front.
Sec. 4. Standing at Ease.
Keeping both legs straight carry the
left foot about ten inches to the left, at
■ the same time raise both hands behind
the back above the buttocks, and grasp
_ the right hand with the left.
Stand at Ease.


When the untrained man falls in for instruction he will
be taught to place himself in the position above described.
Squad,
Atten — tion.
j On the word Attention, spring up to the
( position described in 3.
No deviation from the position of Stand at Ease will be
permitted unless the command Stand—Easy is given, when
the men will be permitted to move their limbs, but without
quitting their ground, so that on coming to Attention no
one shall have lost his dressing.
When there is no special reason for ordering Stand at Ease
before Stand — Easy, the order to Stand—Easy will be given
without it. On the caution Squad being given to men
standing easy, every soldier will at once assume the position
of standing at ease.
Sec. 5. Dressing a Squad with Intervals,
f On the word Right, the head and eyes
] will be directed to the right.
Eyes — Right.
On the word Dress, each man, except
the right-hand man, will extend his right
arm, back of the hand upwards, finger tips
touching the shoulder of the man on his
right. At the same time he will take up
his dressing in line by moving with short
quick steps, till he is just able to distinguish
the lower part of the face of the second
man beyond him. Care must be taken
that he carries his body backward or
forward with the feet, keeping his shoulders
, perfectly square in their original position.
Dress.
/ On the word Front, the head and eyes
' will be turned smartly to the front, the
\ arm dropped, and the position of the
(, soldier, as described in 3, resumed.
Eyes — Front.


Sec. C. Turnings.
' On the word Turn, keeping both knees
well braced back and the body erect, turn
to the right on the right heel and left toe,
raising the left heel and right toe in doing
■ so.
On the completion of the preliminary
movement, the right foot must be flat on
the ground, and the body raised on the
left toe, both legs braced up.
Right — Turn.
( On the word Two, bring the left heel
•' smartly up to the right, closing the heels in
( doing so.

On the completion of the preliminary
movement, the left foot must be flat on the
ground and the body raised on the right
toe, both braced up.

At squad drill with intervals, the turnings will always be
done by numbers.
It will be understood that the foregoing instructions refer to drill without
spurs ; when spurs are worn, allowance must be made for them in placing the
right foot in the first motion of the right and left turn, and the right heel will
be closed to the left on the completion of the second motion.
Sec. 7. Saluting.
General Instructions.
The instructor should impress upon the squad the impor-
tance of this most necessary military duty.
The saluting of officers by their men is an outward sign
of discipline and good order in a regiment which should be
observed with the utmost strictness, and it should be
explained to the men that when saluting an officer they are
performing an act of respect to the commission conferred
on him by His Majesty the King. Equally, officers should
be most punctilious in returning the salutes or signs of
respect given them by their men.
Careful instruction should therefore be given officers and
men in giving and returning salutes—with and without
arms, mounted and dismounted.
1. Saluting to the Front.
Caution.— Salute, by Numbers.
f On the word One, bring the right hand
I smartly, with a circular motion, to the
I head, palm to the front, fingers extended,
J point of the forefinger one inch above the
I right eye, thumb close to the forefinger,
I elbow in line, and nearly square, with the
One.


J On the word Two, cut the arm smartly
| to the side.
™ t
U ' o,
Caution.— Salute, Judging the Time.
( On the word Salute, go through the t wo
\ motions described in One and Tivo.
„ ,
a u e -
2. Saluting to the Side.
Cautions.— Right (or Left) Hand Salute, by Numbers; or
Right (or Left) Hand Salute, Judging the Time.
The salute will always be with the hand further from the
person saluted.
The procedure will be as described in (1), except that as
the hand is brought to the salute, the head will be slightly
turned towards the person saluted.
Men should be practised in marching two or three to-
gether, saluting points being placed on either side. When
several men are together, the man nearest to the point will
give the time.
When a soldier passes an officer he will salute on the
third pace before reaching him, and will lower the hand on
the third pace after passing him ; if carrying a cane he will
place it smartly under his arm.
A soldierj if sitting when an officer approaches, will rise,
stand at attention, and salute; if two or more men are
sitting or standing about, the senior non-commissioned
officer or oldest soldier will call the whole to Attention and
salute.
When a soldier addresses an officer he will halt two paces
from him, and salute as above described. He will also
salute before withdrawing.
When appearing before an officer in a room, he will
salute without removing his cap.


A soldier, without his cap, or who is carrying anything
that prevents him from saluting properly, will, if standing
still, come to attention as an officer 1 passes ; if walking, or
on a bicycle, he will turn his head smartly towards the
officer in passing him.
All ranks wearing the sword will always salute with the
right hand.
3. Officers Saluting with the Sivord.
PREPARATORY DRILL ON FOOT.
The squad will be formed up at extended intervals (two
yards) Standing at Ease, the sword hanging forward by the
slings, the shoe of the scabbard resting on the ground close
to the left foot and just in front of the heel, the palm of
the left hand resting on the top of the hilt, the right arm
hanging by the side, the right foot drawn back six inches,
the left knee slightly bent.
“ Attention —Bring the sword upright by the side, the
shoe of the scabbard resting on the ground as before, the
left arm extended, the hand round the scabbard, thumb in
front, fingers in rear; at the same time bring the right foot
smartly up in line with the left, and brace both knees.
“ Quick March" —Raise the sword smartly with the left
hand at the first pace, without stooping or disturbing the
position of the body, and grasp the scabbard at the point
where the sword balances when held at an angle of 45 deg.,
the fingers round the scabbard, the thumb along the edge,*
the arm fully extended, the hilt touching the back part of
the arm.
“ Halt.” —Lower the sword to the ground, as in the
position of Attention.
•For officers, substitute“ and place tbe forefinger below the lower ring
of the scabbard, the thumb and remaining fingers round it.”


“£h •aw Swords." —The sword is drawn in three motions,
(1) Raise the scabbard until the little finger of the left
hand is in line with the elbow, grasping the back (for
officers’ swords, upper) ring with the thumb and forefinger,
the remaining fingers closed in the hand, the thick part of
the fore-arm against the side ; at the same time pass the
right hand smartly across the body to the sword knot, place
it on the wrist, give it two turns inwards to secure it, and
as the handle is grasped draw out the blade slowly until the
hand is in line with the elbow, turning the edge to the rear
and straightening the left arm in rear of the thigh,
the right arm close to the body, shoulders square to the
front. (2) With an extended arm draw the sword slowly
from the scabbard, edge to the rear, in rear of the left
shoulder, and bring it to the Recover , that is, with the bar
of the hilt in line with the bottom of the chin, blade
perpendicular, edge to the left, elbow close to the body; at
the same time bring the scabbard upright by the side as at
Attention. (3) Lower the sword smartly to the Carry ,
that is, with the hand in front of the elbow and little finger
in line with its blade perpendicular, edge to the front.
“Slope Swords.” —Relax the grasp of the last three
fingers, and, without disturbing the position of the hand,
allow the back of the sword to fall lightly on the shoulder,
midway between the neck and the point of the shoulder.
“ Stand at Ease.” —Allow the scabbard to tall forward to
the full extent of the slings, and place the palm of the left
hand on the mouth of it, shoe of the scabbard resting on
the ground, close to the left foot and just in front of the
heel ; at the same time draw back the right foot six inches,
aud slightly bend the left knee.
This position of standing at ease is always to be adopted
on foot with swords drawn, both in the ranks and at open
tiles, as when formed for the Sword Exercise.


“Attention .”—Come smartly to the position of Attention
as before described, the sword at the slope, the scabbard
upright by the left side.
“Carry Swords.”— Resume the grasp of the last three
fingers and bring the blade perpendicular, as in the third
motion of drawing swords.
“ Return Swords." —The sword is returned in three
motions. (1) Carry the hilt smartly to the hollow of the
left shoulder, blade perpendicular, edge to the loft, elbow
level with the shoulder, at the same time bringing forward
the mouth of the scabbard about three inches, grasping the
back (for officers’ swords, upper) ring with the thumb and
forefinger ; then, by a quick turn of the wrist, drop the
point in rear of the left shoulder into the scabbard and
resume the position at the end of the first motion of Dratv
Swords, shoulders being kept square to the front throughout
this motion. (2) Let the sword fall smoothly into the
scabbard, release the hand from the sword knot by giving it
two turns outwards, the right hand remaining across the body
in line with the elbow, fingers extended and close together,
back of the hand up, and bring the sword to the position
of Attention. (3) Drop the right hand smartly to the side.
In marching with swords drawn, the scabbard is to be
raised on the word March, and lowered to the ground on
the word Halt, in the same manner as described for marching
with sword not drawn.
On the march (except when on the passing line in
marching past), or when manoeuvring, the sword is to be
at the “ Slope,” both on foot and mounted. When mounted,
the little finger is to lie in rear of the hilt.
When the sword is at the Carry mounted (in parade
movements and on complimentary occasions), the hilt is
to rest on the right thigh, the blade perpendicular, the
wrist rounded so as to incline the edge slightly to the left,


tiie grasp of the lower linger.) slightly relaxed, the little
linger in rear of the hilt.
Officers’ Salute in Marching Fast. —The salute on the
march is to commence when at tea and to finish at six
paces from the reviewing officer, taking the time from the
officer on the right.
First pace : Carry the sword direct to the right to the
full extent of the arm, hand as high as the shoulder,
back of the hand to the rear, blade perpendicular. During
this motion shift the grasp of the sword, placing the thumb
on the flat of the hilt pointing upwards, and the tips of
the fingers in line with the edge of the sword, which will
be to the front.
Second pace : Bring the sword by a circular motion to the
Recover, keeping the elbow as high as the shoulder.
Third pace : Still keeping the elbow to the height of the
shoulder, bring the hilt to the right shoulder, hand as high
as the elbow.
Fourth pace : Lower the sword to the front to the full
extent of the arm, the point in the direction of the right
foot, about 12 inches from the ground, edge to the left,
thumb extended in the direction of the point, elbow very
slightly bent, hand directly under and not in front of the
shoulder.
The head is slightly turned towards the reviewing officer
whilst passing him.
After passing the reviewing officer six paces, the sword
is brought to the Recover with the right foot, carrying it
well to the front, and to the Carry at the following pace.
Officers’ Salute at the Halt —The sword being at the
Carry :—(1) Bring the sword to the Recover, shifting the
grasp as described in the first motion of the salute in
marching past, but with the edge of the sword to the left.
(2) Lower the sword to the front at the full extent of the
M.S.M. c


aim, the point in the direction of the right foot, about
12 inches from the ground, edge to the left, thumb extended
in the direction of the point, hand directly under the
shoulder.
MARCHING.
Sec. 8. Length of Pace anil Time.
1. Length of Pace. —ln quick time the length of a pace
is 33 indies ; in stepping out it is 3G inches; in double time,
10; in stepping short, 21 ; and in the side step, 15 inches.
2. Time. —In quick time, 128 paces, equal to 118 yards,
are taken in a minute, or four miles in an hour; in double
time, 180 paces, equal to 200 yards a minute. The time of
the side step is the same as for the quick step.
Distances of 118 and 200 yards will be marked on the
drill ground, and non-commissioned officers and men prac-
tised in keeping correct time and length of pace.
Sec. 9. The Drum and Face Stick.
No man, or squad of men, is to be taught to march
without the constant use of the drum and pace stick.
The drum will first beat the time in which the men are
to inarch when the squad is halted ; then, from time to
time, when it is in motion. While the drum is beating at
the halt, the men will give their whole attention to the
time ; when it ceases, the instructor will at once put the
squad in motion.
In order to ascertain whether the time is beaten cor-
rectly, a pendulum should be used.
The length of the pace in marching will be corrected
with the pace stick, the accuracy of which should occa-
sionally be tested by measurement.


Sec, 10. Position in Marching.
In marching, the soldier must maintain the position of
the head and body, as directed in 3, with the weight on the
fore part of the teet. He must lie well balanced on his
limbs. In slow time his arms and hands must be kept
steady by his sides, care being taken that the hand does
not partake of the movement of the leg, and the toes must
be pointed downwards. In quick time liits arms will swing
naturally from the shoulder, the right arm swinging for-
ward with the left leg, and the left arm with the right leg,
the hand not to be swung in advance of the leading foot
nor across the body. The hand will not be raised higher
than the waistbelt. The movement of the leg must spring
from the haunch, and be free and natural.
Both knees must be kept straight, except while the leg is
being carried from the rear to the front, when the knee
must necessarily be a little bent, to enable the foot to clear
the ground. The foot must be carried straight to the front,
and, without being drawn back, placed firmly on the ground,
but so as not to jerk or shake the body.
Although several men may be drilled together in a squad
with intervals, they must act independently, precisely as if
they were being instructed singly. Each soldier must bo
taught to march in a straight line, and to take a correct
pace, both as regards length and tini ', without reference to
the other men of the squad.
Before the squad is put in motion, the instructor will
take care that the men are square individually and in
correct line with each other. Each man must be taught to
take up a straight line to his front, by fixing Iris eyes upon
some distant object; and then observing some nearer point
in the same straight line, such as a stone, tuft of grass, or
other object.


See. 11. The Quick Hard,.
( The time having been given on the drum,
j on the word J larrlt the squad will stop oil'
j together with the left foot, in quick time,
' observing the rules given in 10.

Sec. 12. The Halt.
1 On the word Halt, the moving foot will
< complete its pace, and the other will be
( brought smartly up in line with it.
Squad — Half.
Sec. 13, Stepping Out.
/ When marching, on the word Out, the
) soldier will lengthen the pace by 3 inches,
b leaning forward a little but without alter-
(, ing the cadence.
„ „
1 w '
This step is used when a slight increase of speed, without
an alteration of cadence, is required ; on the word Break
info Quick Time—Quick , the usual pace will be resumed.
Sec. 14. Stepping Short.
f On the word Short, the foot advancing
I will finish its pace, and afterwards each
c soldier will shorten the pace by 12 inches
I until the word Forward is given, when the
quick pace will be resumed.
Sten — Short,


See. 15. Marleinr/ Time,
/ On the word Time, the foot then
advancing will complete its pace, after
which the time will be continued, without
advancing, by raising each foot alternately
j about 0 inches, keeping the feet almost
■- p ara ]j e i w ith the ground, the knees raised
to the front, the anus kept steady at the
sides, and the body steady. On the word
Forward, the pace at which the men were
\moving will be resumed.
Mari' — Time.
From the halt, the word of command will be Quid',

Sec. 16. Stepping Bade.
i ' In stepping back, soldiers must be taught
j to take a quick pace of 33 inches straight
I to the rear, preserving their shoulders
\ square to the front and their bodies erect.
I In halting, the foot in front will be brought
! back square with the other.
Paces,
Step Pads —
March.
The step back should never exceed four paces.
Sec. 17. Changing Step.
To change step in inarching, the advanc-
ing foot will complete its pace, and the
ball of the rear foot will he brought up to
■ the heel of the advanced one, which will
make another step forward, so that the
time will not be lost, two successive steps
being taken with the same foot.
Change — Step-
This niiiy be required when any part of a squad, or a
single soldier, is stepping with a different foot from the
rest.


To change stop when marking lime, a man will beat
twice with the same foot.
Sec. 18. The Rouble. March.
The time having been given on the drum,
on the word March, the men will step oil
together with the left foot. At the same
time they will raise their hands as high as
the waist, clenching the lists, the flat part
of the wrist inwards. The arras should
J move backwards and forwards with free-
dom, care being taken that the hands are
kept the width of the shoulders apart : the
head to be kept erect, and the shoulders
square to the front. The knees are to be
more bent, and the body more advanced
[ than in the other marches.
Double

On the word March , each man will carry
his right foot lo inches direct to the right,
and instantly close his left foot to it, thus
completing the pace ; he will proceed to
- take the next pace in the same manner;
shoulders to be kept square, knees not
bent, unless on rough or broken ground.
The direction must he kept in a straight
line to the flank.


t On the word Halt, which will be used
J when the number of paces has not been
i specified, the men will complete the pace
{ they are taking, and remain steady.
Squad —II alt.
A squad should not usually be moved to a flank by the
side step more than 12 paces.
Sec. 20. Turning when on the March.
!1. Turning to the Right, and back
into Squad. —On the word Turn, which
should be given as the left foot is coming
to the ground, each soldier will turn in the
named direction, and move on at once,
without checking his pace.
Bight — Turn.
( On the word Turn , which should bo
j given as the right foot is coming to the
I ground, each soldier will turn again to the
j left, and move on without checking his
[ pace.
Left — Turn.
12. Turning to the Left and hack into
Squad. —Soldiers will turn to the left in
like manner, the word Turn being given as
< the right foot is coming to the ground.
I They will turn again to the right, the
I word Turn being given as the left foot is
y coming to the ground.
Left — Turn.
Bight — Turn.
A soldier will always turn to the right on the left foot;
and to the left on the right foot. If the word Turn is not
given as the proper foot is coming to the ground, the
soldier will move on one pace and then turn.
3. Making a Half Turn to the Right, or Left. Men
will also be practised in making a half turn to the right or
left on the words Right or Left Incline, and then moving


on (without checking their pace) in a diagonal direction,
taking up fresh points, at once, to march on, and turning
in the original direction on the word Adcuncr.
4. Turninij About. —Men will also be taught to turn
about, which must be done by each man on his own ground,
in three paces, without losing the time. Having completed
the turn about, the soldier will at once move forward, the
fourth pace being a full pace of 33 inches.
SyUAD DRILL, IN SINGLE RANK.
The following sections are applicable to mounted troops
both on foot, and when mounted. Allowance will bo made
in the latter case as regards intervals and distances in
accordance with the size of the animals upon which the men
are mounted. As regards pace the “ Quick ” march
answers to “ Walk " march and the “ Double ” to “ Trot."
Bee. 21. Formation of the Squad in Single Hunk.
At this stage of the instruction a few men will be formed
in single rank, each man being allowed a space of 30 inches.

See, 22. Dressing when Halted.
In dressing, each man will look towards the flank by
which he is ordered to dress with a smart turn of the head,


as described in J>. He must carry his body backward or
forward with the feet, moving to his dressing with short
quick steps, without handing backward or forward. His
shoulders must be kept perfectly square and the position
of tiie soldier, in 3, retained throughout.
In Succession.
Bight or Left
Dress.
Ei/es — -front.
1. Dressing in Succession. —The instruc-
tor having directed a flank man to stand
steady, looking to his front, the remainder,
on the word Dress, will move into line in
succession. The faces of the men are the
line of dressing. Each man must be able
to distinguish the lower part of the face of
ttie second man beyond him.
I When the instructor is satisfied that the
j line is correct, he will give the command
\ Eges — Front, on which the men will turn
\ their heads and eyes smartly to the front.
Similarly, a squad will be taught to dress back, the men
stepping back one pace on the command Bigh t — Dress, and
moving back into line in succession.
2. Dressing Together. —When soldiers are on the align-
ment they have to occupy, and it is necessary to correct
their dressing, the command Bight—Dress will be given, on
which they will move up or back to their places successively,
commencing with the man on the named flank,
The instructor should invariably fix upon some object on
which to dress his line.
It will be found most useful to accustom men to dress on
an alignment oblique to any well-defined adjacent line,
such as the side of a square parade ground.
Sec. 23. Turnings.
The untrained man will next practice in single rank, judg-
ing the time, the turnings lie has been taught by numbers.


See. 21, Marching in Sc/iiaJ.
Before a squad is ordered to march, the directing flank
must be indicated by the caution, By ihe right. By /he
centre, or By the left. The centre man should be named by
the instructor. During the march, the shoulders must he
kept perfectly square to the front, the body steady, eyes off
the ground. Each man will preserve his position in the
general alignment by an occasional glance towards the
point of direction.
The squad will first be taught to march straight to the
front, by the right, by the centre, and by the left. It will
then be practised in all the varieties of step in quick time,
and in marking time, after which it will be exercised in
double time.
The man will be practised in changing the pace without
halting from quick to double, on the caution Break into
Double Time, followed by the command Double, and from
double to quick. In breaking from double into quick time,
on the word Quick the arms will be dropped to their usual
position.
The instructor should teach the man on the flank, or in
the centre, according to the caution, to select two distant
points to march on, and before anproaching the first to
take another in advance on the same line, and so on.
By occasionally remaining halted in rear of the directing
man, and fixing his eyes on the distant objects, the instructor
can ascertain if the squad is marching straight to its front.
When a soldier finds himself a little behind, or before,
the other men of his squad, he must be taught to recover
his place in the rank gradually, and not to rush to it,
which would make him unsteady and spoil the marching of
the rest.


Rh/ht Incline.
Advance -!
(or Retire).
Sec. -•>. The Diagonal March.
i When the squad is on the march in line,
and is required to move in a diagonal direc-
tion to the right, the word Riijht Incline
will be given, upon which the men will
turn half right, and move diagonally in
that direction, each regulating his pace so
that his own shoulders are parallel with the
-| shoulders of the man on his right. The
right-hand man will direct, and must there-
fore pay particular attention to the direc-
tion and pace. When it is intended to
resume the original direction, the word
Advance (or Retire) will be given, on which
every man will move forward in the original
direction without checking his pace.
li the diagonal march has been properly performed, the
squad when halted, or after the word Advance (or Retire),
will be found to be in a line parallel to its original
position.
The diagonal march will also be practised in double time.
Sec. 20. Ghanfjintj Dire-liun.
Soldiers will first be taught to wheel from the halt, after
which they will be instructed in changing the direction of
the squad while on the march.
It will be explained to the squad that, in wheeling, the
Hank which is brought forward is termed the outer flank,
the other the inner flank ; thus in wheeling to the right,
the man on the left of the squad is called the outer flank
man, the man on the right the inner flank man.

On the word Mureh, the inner think man
marks time, turning gradually with his
rank. The remainder step together, the
whole glancing to the outer Hank, except
I the outer flank man, who regulates the
j pace at which the wheel is made, stepping
the usual pace of 33 inches, and conducts
the flank so as to avoid crowding and
increase of intervals ; the other men regu-
late their length of pace according to their
distance from the inner flank, and all resist
pressure from the outer flank, but give
way to pressure from the inner flank.
On the word Halt, which may be given
j at any period of the wheel, the men will
i j ia j t an j turn their eyes to the front ; on
" the word Dress, they will take up their
| Messing py ti, e centre, or flank to which
' they dressed before wheeling.
j On the word Front, the men will turn
( their heads and eyes to the front.
A squad will wheel to the left in like manner.
Nothing will sooner tend to enable the untrained man
to acquire the length of step proportioned to his distance
from the inner flank, than continuing the wheel without
halting for several revolutions of the circle.

lie intends it to move: this may be done at any degree of
the circle.
Hoc. 27. Marching as in file.
\ 1. From the halt. —Soldiers, when staud-
j ing as in tile, must be instructed to cover
| each other exactly. The head of the man
i mine( Ji a tely before each soldier, when he
is correctly covered, will conceal the heads
of all the others before him.
Right — Turn.
On the, word March, the whole will step
off together, and will continue to step a
full pace, without increasing or diminishing
the interval between each other. No look-
( ing down nor leaning back is to be allowed.
The leader is to be directed to march
straight forward on some distant object,
the remainder of the men covering cor-
rectly during the march.

tiec. 28. Changing direction as in file.
The squad, when marching as in tile,
will be taught to change direction. The
instructor, as he gives the word, will, if
| necessary, indicate the new direction by
j signal. The leading man will move round
Jthe circumference of a circle having a
' radius of four feet. The other men, in
succession, will follow in his footsteps with-
out increasing or diminishing their distances
| from each other or altering the time, but
1 shortening the pace a little with the inner
[ foot.
Right — Wheel.
If a squad is ordered to halt, mark time, or step short
when a part of the men only have wheeled into the new
direction, the remainder should be instructed to cover off,

and the leading man will halt instead of stepping short, the
remainder doing the same as they reach their places.
Sec. 30. Marching with arms.
Squads with arms will Ire practised in the different
marches, and variations of step, described in the foregoing
sections. During these practices, the closest attention must

PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION FOR MOUNTED
DRILL,
The untrained men, when thoroughly grounded in the fore-
going instructions, will be drilled as a troop.
The troop will be formed up, and told off as follows ;
Sec. 32. Formation of a Troop on Foot.
The troop will form in single rank, each man occupying
at least 30 inches in the ranks.
“ Troop — )
Fall in.” :■
“Attention.” I
As before detailed.


A steady soldier will be selected as centre guide, and
posted as the left hand man of (he right half of the troop.
The instructor will place one of his assistants or a
selected man as troop leader three paces in front of the
centre guide.
The centre guide will be cautioned to keep three paces
exactly in rear of the troop leader, unless specially directed
to take up his own points to march on.
It will be explained to the men that the dressing, when
formed in troop, is by the centre and is kept in the same
way as when in squad, except that each man’s position at
the halt and pace when marching depend upon the troop
■leader, and that each man in the ranks must keep a proper
distance, viz., three paces, in rear of him.
“ Eyes —

/ The troop leader will place himself in
i front of the centre of his troop, facing the
1 centre guide, each man will look towards
< his centre (except the centre guide, who
j will look straight to the front), and will
I dress up until he can see the surface of the
\ face of the second man from him.
j This command will be given when the
•: troop is dressed, upon which every man
( will turn his head and eyes to the front.
The instructor will then proceed to inspect the troop to
see that the arras, appointments, clothing, &c,, are clean
and in good order.
Rifles will be inspected and examined as directed in Part
I (h) Rifle Exercises.

See. 35. Movements by Sections.
The wheel of sections is made upon the flank man of each
section.


Thu words of command are “ /Sections Right,”
“ Sections — Left,” “ Sections — About.”
In all cases when the above commands are given, sections
wheel at once, without the word “ March.” If they are
given at the halt, the men halt on completing the wheel ;
if given while on the move, the men continue in movement
after completing the wheel, and do not receive the word
“ Forward.”
After “ Sections —Right,” the sections are fronted by
“ Sections —Left.” and vice versa.
After wheeling sections about, the dressing continues to
the same point as before going about.
The wheel of sections to the right or left is completed in
3 paces, the wheel of sections about in 6 paces, the outward
flank man taking a pace of about 12 inches, so as to bring
the section into line on the last pace.
The distance between sections after wheeling into column,
is 3 paces, 1| paces in half sections, and 1 pace in single
files.
Broken sections of less than 4 men should be placed as
second section from the left of troops.
To retire when marching along a road in sections, the
order is “ Sections — About.” The sections on the flanks
should be occasionally changed during the exercise, in order
that every man may learn to lead steadily and acquire
readiness in commencing marches and formations.
In column of sections, half sections and single files,
the dressing is to the inner’ or directing flank on which the
troop leaders are posted ; and the men on that flank are
responsible for preserving their distances and covering. If
the right of the troop be in front, the left is the inner flank,
and vice versa.


Sup. -JG. Decrease and Increase of Front.
(Plato TIL, Figs. 1-2.)
The, column of sections, half sections, etc , arc supposed
in the following instructions to have the right section (half
section or tile) leading. All decreases of sections, &c., will,
therefore, he from the right, and all increases will be made
on the left. The sequence of the numbers in the section
should, therefore, remain always the same (*.«., No. 1 on
the right, ifec.) unless otherwise ordered.
In the preliminary instructions the movements should
always be executed from the halt, as described herein, but
the mode of decreasing and increasing the front here laid
down is equally applicable to columns on the move ; in the
case of column of sections, &c., the rear must be ordered to
halt when decreasing the front on the move, and to increase
the pace when increasing the front.
Thus in decreasing from sections on the move on foot the
command will be “Form Half — Sections,” “Hear—Mark
Time” (if mounted “Rear — Halt”), when all but the
leading half section will mark time (or halt), and in
increasing the front from half sections to sections, <fec., while
on the march the command will be “ Form Sections,”
“ Mark Time in Fron t ” (if mounted at the walk, “ Rear —■
Trot ” ; if at the trot “ Rear —Gallop ”).

{a) Retirement* from a Flank.
The instructions for retiring from the right (or left) are
the same as for advancing from the right (or left), the com-
mand “ Sections About ” being first given.


Sec. 38. Formations to the Front, Flanks and Rear.
If any of the commands “Sections — Right,” “Sections
— Left," and “Sections—About” be given at the halt the
men halt on completing the wheel, but all other formations
from sections, half-sections, Ac., whether from the halt or
while on the move, are done on the move, for example, a
squad is on the march in a column of sections or half sections,
the word “Front — Form” is given, followed by “ Rear —
Double ” ; if therefore it is desired to execute any of them
to the halt, the caution “ To the Halt ” must be prefixed
to the command for the formation.
When done to the halt, the whole of the men move
during the formation at the pace ordered, or continue the
pace at which they are moving ; but when the formation is
to be made without halting, as in increasing the front, the
rear sections, Ac. (except in the formation to a flank from
sections) must be ordei ed to move at an increased pace, and
the command for the formation will be followed by the
words (if on foot) “ Rear — Double,” (if mounted) “ Rear —
Trot ” (if at a walk), “ Rear—Gallop ” (if at a trot).
At preliminary instruction the formations should be
made from and to the halt, and the leading sections, Ac.,
may then be moved up separately and placed on the
ground.
The leading men as they form are to be placed perfectly
square to the front or flank, but when the men have
acquired some proficiency the unit of formation should
occasionally be placed obliquely to the original front, so
that an alignment can be formed in any direction required.
The men are never to be allowed to move up in the least
degree faster than the regular pace ordered, but they must


be taught to form to the front, etc., in any direction and at
any pace ordered.
On the completion of the following formations during the
earlier instructions of squads without leaders “ Eyes —
Front” must bo given when the formation is to the halt
(except to the inner flank from sections), and “Eyes
Centre ,” (fee., when done on the move ; but in all cases where
there are leaders the men are taught to take their alignment
from the proper directing point as soon as the formation is
completed.
The modes of executing the formations in various direc-
tions described herein are to be thoroughly learnt by all
ranks and invariably practised when time and space permit;
but when the men are able to execute them with tolerable
accuracy at all paces, they are occasionally to be exercised
in forming line in any direction, viz., to the front, to the
right or left of the leading body, to either flank and to the
rear, without regard to their proper positions in the ranks,
and special importance should be attached to their ability in
forming oblique line towards the right or left front. In these
impromptu formations, on the instructor’s, or squadron
leader’s command the troop leaders will rapidly align them-
selves at the usual intervals in the direction indicated by
the instructor’s or squadron leader’s command and signal,
and the men will as quickly as possible form in rear of them.
Such impromptu formations will always be followed, when
mounted, by a short advance.

The sections wheel into line and halt.
In this case the words “ Sections — Lejt”

execute the formation to the halt, the
caution “ To the Halt ” must be given.
“ Sections
N.B.—Line can be formed to the right in the same
manner by the command “ Sections — Right,” the original
right-hand section becoming the left-hand section in the new
alignment.
To form troop to a flank from half-sections or single files,
sections will first of all be formed, and the procedure is then
as above.
(c) Formations to the Rear. — ll Any formation of sections,
&c., to the rear is executed by wheeling about sections,
half sections or single files, and then executing the
formation required ; or the head of the column wheeled
and the formation made to a flank.” For instance, if a
column of sections is advancing in one direction and it is
desired to form a line facing in the opposite direction, the
word of command will be “ Sections — About, To the Halt
Form Troop ” (if done to the halt). “Sections — About—Form
Troop, Rear Double (Trot, or Gallop )” (if on the move).


Sec. 39. Occupation of a Position.
The following movement is the quickest and simplest
method of occupying a defined position by any given
number of men whom it is desired to place simultaneously
in the firing line.
The officer commanding (or instructor with) the troop or
squad will select in the centre of the given position some
conspicuous and definite object, for example a tree, bush, or
rock, he will similarly select objects upon the right and left
of the position. These objects will be indicated to the
centre man (or section if the extension is to be by sections),
and to the flank men (or sections) respectively of the troop
or squad. When thoroughly understood by the men (or
sections) named, and by the whole troop, the officer com-
manding (or instructor) will direct the remaining men (or
sections) to fill up the intervals in accordance with the
cover which they may find or which circumstances may
render most advisable. He will then give the command
“From the centre extend “ Occupy the position indicated
“Double March.”
The centre man (or section) and flank men (or sections)
will then move direct upon the objects named, the
remainder opening out and filling the intervals.
The centre man (or section) will be usually detailed as
the unit of direction.
Upon the arrival of the men (or sections) upon the
position indicated each will individually select and take up
his (or its) position and lie down, being careful not to
expose himself against the sky if the position is situated
upon the crest of a hill or ridge.
This movement will be constantly practised for positions
of varying sizes from 50 to 500 yards, both by single men
and by sections, until it is thoroughly understood by all
concerned.


It is to be observed that this movement constitutes the
basis of skirmishing and of the modern system of attack.
The principles given above are equally applicable to bodies
of troops of varying strength whether on foot or mounted.
When this movement is carried out by the men mounted
tiie extension should invariably be by sections, and the
length of the position selected must vary according to the
size or strength of the body of troops.
(B.)
RIFLE EXERCISES.
Sec. 40. Preliminary Remarks.
It is necessary that the mounted soldier should be able to
handle his rifle with facility and in accordance with the
regulations on this subject. Considering, however, the
greater importance of other portions of his instruction it is
advisable that as short a time as possible should be
devoted to the Rifle Exercises.
General Rules.
1. Men, on joining, before they commence the Rifle
Exercises, are to be taught the names of the different parts
of the rifle and bayonet.
2. The rifle exercises will not be performed at inspections,
nor by any body of soldiers larger than a squad.
3. The instructor should always be provided with a rifle
when at drill, in order that he mry be able to show the
untrained men the required positions and motions. Such
practical instruction should, as far as possible, be substituted
for the minute detail given in the text.
4. Drilling by numbers should be restricted to the
instruction of undrilled men.
5. The rifle must be carefully handled, especially when
fixing or unfixing the bayonet, in piling or unpiling arms,
and when coming to the Order.

(as above described.
2. To Unfix Bayonets, first bring the rifle to the trail, and
place it under the left arm. Unfix with the right hand,
return the bayonet, and come back to the Slope,
XVIII.
Arms will, as a general rule, be carried at the Slope.
When soldiers step off from the Order, they will come to
the Slope as they take the first step, returning to the Order
as they halt.
When ordered to mark time from the halt, the foregoing
rules will apply.
If standing with ordered arms, and directed to close to
the right or left, to step back, or to take any named number
of paces to the front, the men will come to the Short Trail.
XIX.
Changing, Segueing, and Slinging Arms.
On the command Change Arms, the rifle if at the Slope
will be carried to the opposite shoulder ; if at the Trail to
the other hand.


On the command /Secure Arms, the soldier will place the
breech of the rifle under the left arm-pit, the knob of the
bolt to the rear.
On the command Sling Arms, the soldier will pass the
head and the right arm between the sling and the rifle, the
sling passing over the left shoulder, and the rifle, muzzle
upwards, hanging diagonally across the back.
XX.
Grounding and Taking up Arms.
On the command Ground Arms, the rifle will be placed
gently on the ground at the right side, bolt head to the
rear.
On the command Take up Arms, the men will take up
arms and come to the Order.
XXI.
Inspecting Arms on Parade.
1. The men, standing at the Order, will receive the
command, For Inspection, Port Arms.
For
Inspection
Fort — Arms.
To Port Arms. —Cant the rifle, muzzle
leading, with the right hand smartly across
the body, guard to the left and downwards,
the barrel crossing opposite the point of
the left shoulder, and meet it at the same
time with the left hand close behind the
back-sight, thumb and fingers round the
<] rifle, the left wrist to be opposite the left
breast, both elbows close to the body.
Seize it at the same time with the thumb
and fingers of the right hand round the
small. Then pull out the cut-off, open the
breech and grasp the butt with the right
hand, immediately behind the bolt, thumb
pointing to the muzzle.


2. When arms are inspected at the Port only, as in
inspecting a squadron or company on parade, or for the
purpose of ascertaining that there is no cartridge in the
rifle or magazines, each soldier, when the Officer, or non-com-
missioned officer passes the file next to him, will close the cut-
off and breech, press the trigger, order arms, and stand easy.

the lower band, and place the rifle quietly
on the ground at the Order.
3. Examine Arms.
If it be necessary to examine arras, as before Ball Practice,
&c., on the word Arms , the men will come to the Ready
Position with the muzzle of the rifle so inclined as to enable
the Officer to look through the barrel, the thumb of the
right hand being placed in front of the bolt to reflect light
into the barrel.
The Officer will look through each barrel to see that it is
clean and free from rust. The soldier, when the Officer
passes the file next to him, will close the cut-off and breech,
press the trigger, Order Arms and stand easy.
XXII.
Piling Arms (Plate IV.).
The squad or troop will be taught to pile arms as follows;
The three or four men of a section (No.
3 will probably be holding the horses) will
act as follows—The men will turn inwards
-j towards one another, No. 1 placing himself
on the right of No. 2 and No. 4 on the left
of No. 3 (if present), and place the butts
of their rifles between their feet.
Pile — Arms,


Nos. 2 will incline the muzzles towards
those of Nos. 4, barrels downwards, and
slipping right hand to the upper band, will
seize the rifles of the Nos. 4 with the left hand
j in the same manner and hold up the piling
swivelsof both rifles with the forefingers and
thumbs, crossing the muzzles by the right to
bring the swivels together. The Nos. 4 will
cut the right hand to the side.

Nos. 1, holding their rifles, sling upwards
at the lower band, will incline the muzzles
forward, and with the left hand will link
swivels through the crossed muzzles of the
Nos. 2 and 4, raising their butts as high
as necessary to do so. Nos. 2 and 4 will
now turn the barrels of their rifles towards
the Nos. 1 who will then place the heels of
their butts six inches to the right of their
right toes so as to make the pile secure.

FIRING EXERCISES.
Sec. 41. General Instructions.
1. Those exercises must be so taught as to inculcate skill
in the handling of arms, and ease and accuracy in the firing
positions.


2. The Tiring Exeioises will never he performed as a
drill, or for inspection purposes, by a larger body than a
squad.
Independent fire is the general rule in action. Volleys
have undoubted!) 7 a good moral effect, and tend to steady
the men in moments of excitement or unexpected danger ;
but their advantages are outweighed by their disadvantages,
and they should seldom be employed, except as a means of
maintaining discipline, or of finding the range, and never at
any other than large and well defined targets.
Magazine fire, in both attack and defence, is necessary at
all opportune and critical moments. The moral effect is
very great ; for the purpose of covering the ad vance against
a strong position, and against an enemy surprised, demora-
lised, or suddenly attacked in flank it may be expected to
produce excellent results.
In order to economise ammunition, it is important that
the use of the magazine should be controlled by the leaders;
but there are occasions when it must be left to the men,
whose judgment must therefore be trained during peace
instruction.
Aim correctors should be frequently used in the instruo*
tion of untrained men and bad shots.
4. For independent firing by numbers the squads, which,
as a rule, should consist of about 12 men to each instructor
shall be formed up at the Order in single rank as usual, or
at 1 or 2 paces interval as circumstances require, and from
15 to 30 paces from the mark,s to be aimed at.
Each man will be shown a mark to aim at. For this
purpose small black “bull’s eyes,” the size of a shilling on
a white circle about 2 inches in diameter, are to be painted
on the barrack wall, 3 feet apart, in two lines, 3 feet and
18 inches respectively from the ground.


It is to be understood that such marks are intended
solely for the elementary instruction of untrained men. In
the case of trained soldiers who have reached a fair
standard, natural objects only should he aimed at; these
should be occasionally prominent, and more often indistinct,
and at varying ranges. Exercises in firing should also
frequently take place at moving, vanishing, and advancing
targets, represented by fatigue men.
The words Right and Left when used to indicate the
object, will always be understood to mean the object which
lies to the right or left front of the firer.
5. The fixed sight is the elevation, on the bed of the
backsight for 500 yards.
The fixed sight should be used, when fully exposed
infantry or horsemen appear within 500 yards, at a rush of
fanatics, and, generally, at ranges under 500 yards, when
there is no opportunity to judge distance and set sights
accurately. On such occasions aim must be taken at the
feet or at or below the ground line.
If it be necessary to fire with the bayonet fixed, the fixed
sight must be used, and aim taken at the feet of the object
or at or below the ground line.
When conditions admit of steady marksmanship at small
objects the sight should be set to the distance estimated.
The adjustment and uses of the fixed sight, with and
without the bayonet, must be taught during instruction in
the Firing Exercises.
6. The term Ready is used to describe the position in
which a soldier holds his rifle for loading, or after loading
and before coming to the Present.
The command Ready is the order to load in independent
and volley firing.
The term collective fire is used to describe the inde-
pendent fire of bodies under control, and also volley firing.


All orders except those of the fire unit commanders are
termed cautionary commands ; those of the fire unit com-
manders are termed executive commands.
7. A fire unit is that body whose fire is controlled by the
executive command of one leader. In skirmishing it is
usually the squad or troop but at times the section. In
close formations it may be any body of men up to a com-
pany.
8. Cautions to attract attention, such as Squad, Com-
pany, &c., will not be given to men except when they are
standing at ease, or easy.
9. All objectives should be named in clear, simple
language, and never in any set terms. No imaginary
objects are to be named, e.g., “at the cavalry ” when there
are no cavalry.
10. The position to be assumed must only be ordered
when a change is required. Thus, a squad standing is
required to fire independent standing. The executive
command is Independent, Ready, &c.
11. If no orders are given as to the rate of fire it will
be Slow at the rate of about five rounds in one minute,
this being increased or decreased by orders as circumstances
may require. Opportunity is to be afforded to the men, on
occasion, to use their own judgment in varying the normal
rate.
By Rapid Hire is understood tie highest rate of fire,
consistent with accuracy, which is obtainable when single
loading. This may be taken to be about ten rounds per
minute.
The rate of Magazine Fire should be about ten to fifteen
rounds per minute.
The commands Magazine, Rapid, or Slow, will be given as
required to change from one rate to another. It will not
usually be necessary to direct cessation of fire to give these


commands. In volley firing the rate of fire is in the hands
of the commander.
In Rapid and Magazine Fire quick aim is essential, and
m&a must be taught to press the trigger firmly, but without
jerking, the moment aim is obtained.
12. A long shrill whistle is the signal to at once discon-
tinue fire. Its verbal equivalent is the command Cease
Fire.
On this signal, or command, men will immediately bring
the rifle to, or retain it at the Ready, and await orders.
The cessation of fire may be necessary in order to change
sighting, or objective, or nature of fire, &c.
Further, it is often advisable to create short pauses in
independent fire in order to observe the effect, or to steady
the men.
When necessary, the whistle signal must be repeated by
all subordinate commanders, but when the squadron com-
mander’s whistle is distinctly heard, and at once acted on,
no repetition is required.
Note.—ln independent and volley firing the cautionary
commands of the squadron commander are printed in
ROMAN capitals, the executive commands in italics.
Sec. 42. Aiming.
1. Before commencing the Firing Exercises untrained
men must be taught the rules for aiming, to adjust the back
and extreme range sights readily and accurately, and to aim
at stationary objects, up to medium ranges.
2. Rules for Aiming.
(1) The backsight must be kept upright.
(2) The left eye must be closed.
(3) Aim must be taken by at once aligning the sights on
the mark, the tip of the foresight being in the centre of
and in line with the shoulders of the Y.


In regard to the point at which aim should be directed,
men will be instructed as follows :—■
When aiming deliberately at small and clearly-defined
marks, under conditions which admit of accurate marks-
manship, the whole of the mark should be seen over the
top of the foresight.
When snap shooting at any object which appears and
disappears, the foresight should roughly cover the mark.
Under all other conditions, aim should be taken at the
lowest visible portion of the object, or ground line.
Aiming with extreme range sights.
In aiming with Mark I* L.M. rifle, the whole of the
bead of the dial sight should be seen in the centre of the
aperture.
With all other marks of the Lee-Metford, and with all
marks of Lee-Enfield rifles, the top of the bead only should
be in the centre of the aperture.
3. Adjustment of sights.
The backsight will be adjusted by moving the slide until
the top is even with the place on the bed, or on the leaf,
giving the elevation for the distance named; then for
distances over 500 yards the leaf will be raised. The
extreme range sights will be adjusted by moving the pointer
of the dial sight to the place on the dial giving the eleva-
tion for the distance named and then raising the aperture
sight.
5. Aiming at stationary marks.
For instruction in aiming at stationary marks tripods
will be used. The tripods support sandbags about feet
from the ground. A target with a black bull’s-eye of
suitable size, according to distance, will be used to aim at,
and should be placed at first at short range.


The method of instruction will be as follows :
The recruit will be directed to adjust his sight to the
named distance, and to aim at the bull’s-eye with his eye at
a point above and in line with the butt plate. Having
aimed, he will step aside, and his instructor will verify the
aim, point out errors, and instruct him as to correcting
them. As proficiency is attained the target will be placed
at longer ranges, and natural objects will also be aimed at.
When possible, the sight to be used will be that for the
actual distance from the target or natural object, as known
to or estimated by the instructor.
The use of the extreme range sight will be taught at the
bull’s-eye target placed at any convenient distance, the sight
being set to any given range.
6. The rules for aiming and the method of adjusting the
sights will in the first place be taught to untrained men by
lecture and theoretical instruction.

Notes on Independent Firing by Numbers—Standing
In giving the range, the word yards is not to be used.
The command is At 700 or At 650, &0., or Fixed sight.
The Present requires special attention. The recruits
must be frequently brought back to the Beady by the com-
mand As you were, in order to establish accuracy and
facility in the motions, but this command is on no account
to be given in order to ensure the motions being performed
in exactly the same time. Careful instruction is required
to teach the recruits to align the sights at once on the mark
as the butt meets the shoulder.
Their proficiency should be frequently tested by making
them aim at the eye.
In the early stages of recruit instruction it is often
necessary to keep a man for some time in the Present
position standing, in order to correct faults. In such cases,
to avoid tiring the man, he should be made to rest the
fore-end of his rifle on a tripod or rest.
Instructors should attend to the following points at the
Beady and Present ;—


At the Ready. —The rifle to be held firmly with the
left hand at the place where it is held at the Present, the
small of the butt in front of the hip, the fingers of the
right hand behind the guard, body erect and balanced
equally on both feet, eyes fixed on the mark.
At the Present. —The body should be erect and well
balanced. The rifle should be held firmly in the palm of
the left hand, the wrist kept well up, sights perfectly
upright, butt well in the shoulder, left elbow well under
the rifle, right elbow nearly square with, but to the front
of, the right shoulder, head slightly inclined forward, not
sideways. The trigger should be pressed, not snatched at;
aim should be taken quickly and the breathing restrained
whilst aiming and pressing the trigger.
In Coming up to the Present from the Ready. —The
finger must be placed on the trigger during this motion.
There must be no shifting the right hand, on forefinger,
after the rifle is at the Present.
Instructors must habituate the men to make a slight
pause at the Present after firing.

Notes on Independent by Numbers, Kneeliny.
The man’s general build must guide the instructor in
applying the directions for placing the left foot on the
command Ready. Short and thick-set men often require
the left foot to be placed less than a pace to the front.
Both skill and patience are required to teach the kneeling
position to recruits without causing them undue discomfort.
Cavalry will not bring the weight of the body on the
heel, and the right knee should point more to the front.
Instructors should attend to the following points at
the Ready and Present.
At the Ready. —The left heel must be slightly in advance
of the left kuee. The right knee should point to the
right front.
At the Present, —The body should be kept well down on
the heel, and as erect as possible, the elbow in the most
comfortable and convenient place on the knee, or over it
if preferred. The left leg, hand, and arm, and the right
shoulder should be on the same vertical plane. In aiming
at a high mark, the necessary elevation should be obtained
by raising the left elbow off the knee, if required.

Other positions. —-When the foregoing fire positions have
been thoroughly taught, the recruit must be instructed in
firing, as follows :
Kneeling on both knees.
Kneeling on one knee, with body erect and left elbow
unsupported, as in standing.
The object of these positions is to enable a man to fire
from behimj cover which is too high to allow of the normal
kneeling po'sition, and too low to afford shelter standing.


He must further be instructed in firing from behind
trees, boulders, and parapets, and from windows. &0., the
rifle being supported according to circumstances.
Bee. 47. Miscellaneous Instruction.
Rest Positions. —When men are in any of the firing
positions, and it is desired to rest them, the command Easy
will be given, when they will assume any position which
gives ease. They may, if they require, place the rifle on the
ground, guard to the right.
In independent and volley tiring, men will carry out
subsequent orders from the Easy.
Sec. 48. The Safety Catch.
When it is required to engage or disengage the “ safety
catch,” which may be done either when the mainspring is
compressed or released, the commands will be as follow :

f Place the thumb on the safety catch and
j press it downwards.
The safety catch will be raised by troops in action before
advancing or retiring, and by all men whose arms are
loaded or magazines charged.
In the case of troops armed with rifles which are provided
with safety catches, the command unload will not be given
before moving from the tiring position.

When lying.— Moving the body round
from the hips.
The command Front to be used as required, but if men
firing half-right are required to fire half left the command
Front need not be given.
The sequence of command is as follows :
Independent, — Beady, Quarter Right, At, — At, —&c.
The commands Half Right, &0., are to be used to teach
untrained men the methods of turning ; they are not to be
employed as a general rule. The commander should
indicate the objective in his own words, the men turning
towards it without further orders.
Sec. 50, Firing at Moving and Vanishing Objects.
Theoretical and practical instruction in these practices
will be afforded to all untrained men during the firing
exercises. Trained soldiers must be exercised as often as
is necessary to keep up efficiency.
1. Moving Objects. Men must be instructed to aim first
on the object, then following it sideways to carry the aim a
little in advance; how much in advance depends on
distance, rate of movement, and on the direction taken by
the object. In aiming at an object moving directly or


obliquely towards or away from the firer, allowance for
elevation must usually be made by aiming lower or higher.
The following may be taken as a general guide in firing
at moving objects ;
The bullet travels about 500 yards in 1 second.
~ ~ 1,000 ~ 3 seconds.
» ,■ 1,500 „ 5 „
Aim should be taken about 1 foot in front per 100
yards a.t a man walking.
Aim should be taken about 2 feet in front per 100
yards at a man doubling.
Aim should be taken about 3 feet in front per 100
yards at a horse trotting.
Aim should be taken about 4 feet in front per 100
yards at a horse galloping.
Men must be practised in aiming higher and lower, with-
out moving the slide, on objects advancing and retiring.
2. Vanishing Objects. —ln aiming at an object which
appears and disappears, the rifle should be brought to the
shoulder on its appearance and aim taken as rapidly as pos-
sible on the lower part.
Both moving and vanishing objects should frequently be
represented by fatigue men.
Sec, 51. Snap-Shooting.
Snap-shooting consists in rapidly covering a mark and at
once releasing the trigger ; it will be practised first as an
instructional drill, and later in a practical manner from
behind cover. Snap-shooting is usually applied to firing at
objects which appear and rapidly disappear at short ranges,
but it is often of value at long range under conditions
where effect must be sought rather from showers of bullets


placed in the vicinity of the objective, than from deliberate
marksmanship. In this class of shooting the trigger must
be released smartly but without jerking ; careful instruction
is required, and supervision must be exercised to prevent
snap-shooting developing into reckless fire.
For practice at short range, men behind cover should be
allowed from three to four seconds for exposure, fire at
objects from 100 to 300 yards, and return to cover. The
objects may be stationary or vanishing, and men should be
practised both in firing over cover and from the edge of
cover. The marks should be made to appear at different
points. The minimum exposure of the firer’s head and
shoulders must be insisted on,
(a) Allowance for Wind.
Both untrained and trained soldiers will be taught to
allow for the effects of wind by aimiug to the right and left
of objects. In teaching the allowance to be made under
various conditions, instructors must be guided by the notes
on the subject in the Theoretical Principles and by their
own experience.
In the early stages of this instruction tripods should be
used, or rifles should be rested on breastworks, &c., and the
men directed to aim a certain distance off the mark. This
distance should be subsequently marked by a fatigue man
with a flag ; in this manner any errors made in judging
lateral distance will be made evident to the men aiming.
(b) Power of Fire.
Men will be frequently exercised in the practice of
delivering sharp bursts of rapid or magazine fire, both short
and prolonged,


Sec. 52. Long Range Sights.
Untrained men must he thoroughly instructed in adjust-
ing and aiming with these sights whilst performing the
firing exercises. Trained soldiers must be kept efficient in
their use.

II rifle, first pressing it downward with the
thumb), open the breech, lay in as many
cartridges as may be ordered, pressing each
down with the thumb (with Mark I rifle,
pressing the base of each downward, allow-
<J ing the point to drop forward), and press
in the cut off.
Care must be taken that the pressure of
the thumb on the last cartridge inserted is
maintained until the cut-off has engaged
over the cartridge.
Close the breech, press the trigger, and
bring the rifle to the Ready.

ing to the right, flat against the under part
I °f the fore-end close against the guard,
holding it with the fingers of the left hand,
thumb over the bolt.
Then turn the barrel over to the left,
right side uppermost, and with the thumb
of the right hand push out each cartridge
from its base, returning it to, the pouch.
Replace the magazine, turn the barrel
upwards, and bring the rifle to the Ready.
Order — Arms, or other commands.
Notes on Charging Magazines.
Should it not be desired to charge magazines fully, the
number of cartridges to be inserted must be ordered,
thus; —
With 7 cartridges—Charge magazines.
If it is necessary to charge magazines and at the same
time assume firing positions other than those the men are
in, the command must be given accordingly, thus :
A squad or troop standing in single rank is required to
kneel and charge magazines. The command will be ;—-
Kneeling—Charge magazines.
Men must also be constantly exercised in charging maga-
zines in all positions in the intervals between firing,


Accidents in charging magazines can only occur through
neglect of the instructions. A fruitful source of danger is
the neglect to maintain the pressure of the thumb on the
last cartridge until the cut-off has engaged over it. This
action must be specially watched in teaching recruits and
insisted on at all times.
In practising the charging of magazines dummy cartridges
will always be used, and the motions must be rapid.
Instructions fob Ceasing and Re-opening Fire and
for Varying the Rate op Fire.
The commands vary according to requirements. The
command Continue is the order to resume fire which has
been temporarily discontinued, This command does not
apply to the re-opening of fire after unloading or after an
advance.
If, whilst fire is proceeding, changes of objective or sight-
ing are required, it may be necessary to direct cessation of
fire.
Under such conditions the following commands apply :
1. Men firing Slow independent are required to change
objective and sighting and to use magazines.
The commands, after cessation of fire, are :
Squadron commander, At (Object), At (Range), Maga-
zine, Continue.
Fire unit commander, At (object), Magazine, At (range),
Continue.
2. Men firing Magazine independent are required to
change to Slotv independent, and to change objective.
The commands, after cessation of fire, are :
Squadron commander, At (Object), Slow, Continue.
Fire unit commander, Slotv, At (object), Continue.
The men close cut-offs without command.


It will often be possible to vary the rate of tire, and even
to change objective and sighting, without discontinuing
tire, the orders being passed along the line. The following
are examples of commands under such conditions :
3. Men firing Magazine independent are required to
change to Slow independent.
The commands are :
Squadron commander. Slow.
Fire unit commander, Slow.
The men close cut-offs without orders.
4. Men firing Slow independent are required to use
magazines.
The commands are :
Squadron commander, Magazine.
Fire unit commander, Magazine.
The command Close Cut-offs will seldom be required
except for changing the rate of fire during volley firing.
Change from independent to volleys is rarely required ;
when this is necessary complete commands must be given.

Sec. 58. ybfes on Fire Commands and on the General
Application of the Firing Exercises.
1. The skilful control and direction of the fire of masses
of men is dependent on systematic accuracy of commands,
and on the correct method of conveying orders to the men,
from the senior officer downwards. Failing these, the
intentions of the commander cannot be properly communi-
cated, and mistakes and loss of power must result. Slow-
ness in opening fire never arises from the completeness of
orders, but rather from inaccuracy, uncertainty, and
hesitation on the part of the leaders. The firing exercises
must be regarded as essentially elementary training for all
commanders in giving complete and correct orders for fire
under varying conditions.
2. In applying the drills of the firing exercises, it must
be kept in mind that whilst accuracy of commands is at all
times of the first importance, no more should be given than
are actually required, and there should be no undue repeti-
tion. If changes are required in description of fire, in
objective or in sighting, such changes must be specified, but
otherwise original orders stand good.
The following are examples ;
(a) A line of skirmishers advancing is ordered to open
independent fire at 1,000 yards. The executive commands
are :
Independent , Beady, At —, At 1000, — Commence.
The subsequent command throughout the advance is
Commence, change of sighting and objective being ordered
only when required.
In such a case the firing positions are never named, each
man taking up such position on halting as the ground he is
on indicates.


(6) A body firing volleys at 1,500 discontinues fire and is
directed to reopen volleys at the same object at 1,409. The
cautionary command is — At 1,400 continue. The execu-
tive command is— Ready, At 1,400, Present, <bc.
3. Although the principle of complete control must never
he lost sight of, both leaders and men must be trained to
think and act for themselves in situations where control of
fire has ceased; or where it is evident that fire can be
opened with effect, but where orders have not reached them ;
and exercises must be improvised having this training in
view. By the gradual withdrawal of leaders the men should
at times be left free to advance and keep up the fire without
orders, their methods and fire action being subsequently
criticised.
There are many occasions when it is impracticable to give
the normal orders for fire. Thus, for example, a body of
men under cover is required to take up an extended frciit
under fire, and it is important that those first in position
should open a rapid fire to cover the movement of the
remainder. Under such conditions previous general in-
structions as to action must take the place of fire commands,
and the leaders must subsequently resume general direction
and control.
4. Again, the normal methods of passing orders and the
complete detail of commands may occasionally be dispensed
with, for the purpose of accustoming men to use their own
judgment. Thus, fire at an object suddenly appearing for a
limited time, should be opened by the nearest commander
on the spot, the order Independent, At (object) being
sufficient, the men being left to themselves as to position,
sighting, use of magazine, Ac., and their action being sub-
sequently criticised.


5. When the fire is combined with movement in two
ranks, the command Halt , or Halt, Lie doivn, will, when
necessary, precede executive fire commands.
6. In skirmishing, the unit of fire is usually the troop,
but in most cases skirmishers can work only by sections.
In close formations a larger unit than the troop is often
desirable. In the case of a regiment called on to open fire
in a close formation, the fire unit may, according to circum-
stances, be the whole squadron. If volleys be employed, it
is desirable that the fire unit should be as large as possible,
its actual size depending on local conditions and the forma-
tion the body is in. In close formations the squadron
commander will usually name the fire unit, thus : —Yolleys
by Troops, at—.
If he does not do so, subordinate commanders will judge
the requirement for themselves.
7. All cautionary commands are passed from the squadron
leader to the troop leaders. The object of teaching this
system in close formations is to establish the correct method
of passing orders in skirmishing. But for the practical
opening of fire in close formations the cautionary commands
of the squadron leader may be given direct to the troop
leaders when circumstances admit.
8. The range should be given by the senior officer direct-
ing the fire if known to him, but he should at times leave
the subordinate commanders and th,. men to find it for them-
selves. When the range is definitely ascertained, it must
be passed to all concerned.
9. The object of magazine fire is to bring a sudden and
powerful fire to bear at an opportune or critical moment.
Its control by the officers is of importance, but both sub-
ordinate leaders and the men must be taught to use their
judgment in employing it without orders under suitable
conditions.


Sec. 59. Special Directions Jor Instructors.
1. The term Instructor , as here applied, includes all
officers and N.C.O.’s who are charged with the training of
the men.
2. Instructors must be thoroughly acquainted, not only
with the musketry regulations and firing exercises, but also
with all drill methods and instructions, which bear on the
employment of fire in the field.
3. A word-perfect knowledge of the drills is valueless un-
less it is combined with facility in imparting that knowledge,
and in rapidly detecting and correcting faults; it is to this
that the instructor must be specially trained.
4. In teaching the firing exercises, the instructor will carry
a rifle and a whistle ; he will not only explain motions to
untrained men, but will practically illustrate them. He
will place himself in such a position as will best enable him
to closely observe each man’s position and actions, and to
give orders and explanations without unduly raising his
voice.
Errors must be corrected by verbal instructions ;
instructors should on no account touch the men to place them
in position, and should rarely approach them to correct
mistakes.
All noise is prohibited ; commands must be clear and
quiet, loud enough only to be heard by those to whom they
are addressed.
Long explanations are wearisome and to be avoided. It
is sufficient to,deal with one point at a time, and directions
should be short and clear.
5. Uniformity of action is on no account to be specially
considered in the early drills. The command 4s you were
is nob to be given for the purpose of establishing this. The
teaching of mechanical regularity of motions, with the

erroneous view of producing smartness, is forbidden. Ter-
fection in the actions of each individual soldier is the point
to aim at; when this is arrived at uniformity follows of
itself,
6. The early exercises of untrained men must be performed
with great deliberation ; smartness in assuming firing posi-
tions, and in returning from such positions, to the order,
must not be looked for at first. A man unaccustomed to
the kneeling position cannot rise quickly without pain.
7. The practice of remedying faulty firing positions, when
once assumed, teaches little. An incorrect position usually
arises from want of accuracy in the preliminary- actions
which lead to it, and it is to these that attention must be
given.
In instructing untrained men, close attention must be
given to the build of individuals ; the instructions, if
properly applied, are sufficiently elastic to enable every man
to acquire a correct and comfortable position.
Awkward men must receive special attention, but not in
the form of extra drill. This must be afforded by dismissing
the more advanced before the time for the drill expires.
8. In all firing positions there is a tendency on the part
of untrained men to get the eye too near the cocking-piece.
Instructors must correct this, and explain that the further
the eye is from the backsight the more clearly will the sights
be defined, and the less strained will oe the position of the
head and neck.
9. All instruction must be smart, alert, and to the point;
it must be varied and made interesting. Men’s muscles and
brains must both be kept moving. On no account should
the more forward be kept in tiring attitudes whilst the
backward are being instructed.
10. Great importance attaches to the instruction of un-
trained men in the methods of releasing the trigger. The


instructor must not only explain, but illustrate the methods
by placing his hand over that of the man, and performing
the motion.
11, There is often a tendency to allow men to stand at
ease, or rest, after a few snaps at a mark. This is necessary
in the case of men unaccustomed to the handling of arms,
but as proficiency increases, exercises in fire must ba
prolonged, and trained soldiers should be expected to
continue firing often for considerable periods.
12. During the progress of the firing exercises, instruction
in musketry must be imparted to the men by explanation,
question and answer. As to the scope of such instruc-
tion, it is sufficient to say, that all detail which must be
known to the instructor should be progressively taught to
the men.
Sec. 60. Webley Pistol Exercise.
The instructor, having previously taught the names and
parts of the pistol, will form up the squad at one or two
paces interval, about fifteen to twenty paces from the marks
to be aimed at.
' Draw the pistol with the right hand,
pointing the muzzle to the front.

Sec. 61. Range Finding.
1. Ranges are measured on maps, and by means of range-
finding instruments, and are estimated by eye and by sound.
Under certain conditions trial shots or volleys are
employed to find the range.
2. The manipulation of the regulation range-finder is a
question of practice and accuracy of work. Commanding
officers are responsible that all officers and sergeants are
skilled in its use.
3. The judging of range by eye is of the utmost impor-
tance and requires special attention. Facility can only be
obtained by thought, observation, and practice, and certain
simple principles must be kept in mind.
Judging Distance by Eye.
1. Preparatory Instruction in Observing Objects at
Known Ranges. —The first instruction consists in teaching
men to recognise short units of measure. Long distances
are eventually estimated by the mental application to them
of short amd familiar ones.


Familiarity with short ranges must be acquired by
observation of distance posts placed in the vicinity of the
quarters at ranges from 60 to 300 yards.
2. Instruction will be given in observation of objects at
fixed distances; such objects will be men standing, kneeling
and lying, singly, and in bodies, both in the open and
behind cover; natural objects also, such as houses, features
of ground, waggons, guns, horses, &c., should be selected.
During this instruction men should be taught the effect
on the eye of the varying conditions of light, ground, &c.
Objects appear nearer —
1. When the sun is behind observer, or generally in
bright light.
2. When the background is of a different colour to the
object.
3. When looking over water, snow, or level ground.
4. In the clear air of mountainous localities.
Objects appear further off—
1. When background and object are of similar colour.
2. When looking over a valley or undulating ground.
3. When the object lies in the shade.
4. When the object is viewed in a failing light or through
mist.
5. When an enemy is only partially seen.
Instruction in Judging Distances.
1. The instruction must be progressive. Estimates of
long distances should not be attempted until short ones can
be judged with accuracy.
2. Each individual must improvise his own method
of applying short units of measure, which are well known to
him, to the distance to be judged. The following methods
may be taken as a general guide.


3. The observer may decide that the object cannot be
more than a certain distance off, nor less than a certain
distance : these must be kept within the closest possible
limits, and the mean of the two taken as the range.
The observer selects a point which he considers halves
the whole distance, estimates this, and doubles it; or he
similarly divides the distance into a certain number of
lengths which are familiar to him.
The observer estimates the distance along well defined
objects on side lines.
General Instructions.
1. Men will be thoroughly trained both in observation of
objects at known ranges, and in judging on objects at
unknown distances,
2. Judging distance should form a part of the daily
training of the soldier, and practical work will be frequently
supplemented by short lectures and questions. This
instruction will usually be afforded in combination with any
exercise which is being performed, the correct distance, if
not previously known to the commander, being ascertained
by the range-finder or by pacing. No record is required,
but company commanders and all subordinate leaders will
make themselves acquainted with the capabilities of those
under their command.
3. It will at times be sufficient to call out a few selected
officers, N.C. officers, or men to judge the range ; the mean
of their estimates will usually be found a reliable guide,
but every man present must know the point judged on,
and must be made aware of the correct distance.
4. Spare time on the rifle range should be utilised in a
few exercises of observation of the appearance of objects at
known distances, or of judging unknown ranges.


The limit up to which judging distances by eye can lie
practised instructively must depend on climatic conditions.
3. Distances will be judged in all positions, but more
frequently lying, sitting, or kneeling,
(i. When practising fire exercises, range will bo
measured or systematically estimated before fire is allowed
to open. It will often be necessary to find the range and
communicate it to all ranks before leaving cover for a fire
position.
7. Squadron commanders will be responsible that all
officers, N.C. officers, and all men who show’ aptitude, are
trained up to a high standard, and that all others are care-
fully and progressively instructed.
Range-Finding by Trial Shots or Volleys.
1. This method is of value when the ground in the
vicinity of the objective is of a nature to show the strike of
bullets, and when there are no very distracting influences,
such as effective opposing fire.
2. Trial shots or volleys will be fired with the elevation
for the estimated range, the results being watched with
field glasses. Distance and nature of ground must deter-
mine the power of fire required and the point to aim at.
This point may be the actual objective, or any ground in
its vicinity which is more suited to show the strike of the
bullets. Volleys will usually be required. The greater the
difficulty in observing the fire the larger must be the unit
firing.
3. In firing trial shots or volleys at long ranges, it is
difficult to determine the actual distance of the strike of
bullets beyond or short of the object; the sight should
therefore be usually raised or lowered not less than 100
yards at a time until the object is enclosed between two
volleys, the one over the other short. The next volley should


be tired with the moan of the two elevations, and any slight
correction bo subsequently made.
Judging Distance by Sound.
1. The system of judging distance by sound is based on
the rate at which sound travels. For practical purposes
sound may be said to travel at the rate of 1,100 feet a
second, i.e., 1,100 yards in three seconds. Between the
flash (or smoke) of a rifle or gun and the sound of the
report a certain time elapses. If this period of time be
carefully noted in seconds, the distance the sound has
travelled can be calculated. To reckon the time between the
flash and the report, it is necessary to train men to count
mentally according to a fixed cadence, namely, eleven beats
in three seconds. Each beat will represent 100 yards ;
thus, when a man counts up to six, the corresponding
distance is 600 yards.
2. This method of judging distance is of value at night
when the flash of a gun or rifle is visible, and by day when
engaged with an enemy who uses black powder. It should
be taught to all untrained men, and trained men should be
sufficiently practised to keep them efficient.
D.
BAYONET FIGHTING.
Sec. 62. General Instructions.
1. The use of the bayonet as a weapon of both attack and
defence is a necessary part of the instruction of the mounted
soldier trained to fight on foot. Proficiency in bayonet
fighting will add much confidence to men in action, whether
in an assault upon an enemy’s position or in defence against
an unexpected onslaught of cavalry.


2. The soldier should in the first instance be taught to
deliver his points with vigour, to form strong and quick
parries with precision, and to be active on his feet, and
until he has thoroughly mastered all these details he should
not be permitted to indulge in loose play. Short and
frequent lessons are jireferablo to those of long duration,
and the following points should be observed :
(a) Before delivering a point the rifle should not bo
drawn back.
(b) Wide parries should be carefully avoided, and
quick returns constantly practised.
(c) In “loose play” the legs and feet should be fre-
quently in action, and although the parries should
be made as described in the instructions, the arms
should at other times move with freedom and
elasticity.
3. A squad will only be inspected in IY, Loose Play,
never in I, 11, or 111.
4. Parts I and II are merely preliminary exercises. They
are not intended to train a squad to perform certain
motions simultaneously, but to accustom the individual
soldier to handle his rifle with bayonet fixed, to strengthen
the muscles, and to quicken the movements. 11l is
intended to give the men confidence and quickness in loose
play.
5. Bayonet fighting will never be carried out by a larger
body than a squad, and every opportunity should be utilised
for encouraging the men to take interest in this portion of
their duty.

taken that each attack is made with the intention of hit-
ting the opponent.
To Disengage.
Without drawing back the rifle lower the point of the
bayonet, and passing it under the opposing weapon, with-
out any pause deliver the point.

SKIRMISHING.
Sec. G 3. General Rules.
1. Skirmishing is movement in extended order, during
which each individual acts and thinks for himself, and
makes use of all his powers, mental and physical, to attain
a common object. A spirit of independent action, con-
trolled by the general directions of the troop and section
leaders, should be sedulously encouraged.
2. Skirmishing is the formation adopted for modern war-
fare. The attack is generally carried out by successive lines
of skirmishers, working up, if possible under cover, to deci-
sive range (about 600 yards), and gradually merging into
one another until they form a strong firing-line, enveloping,
or partially enveloping, the enemy’s position.
3. Skirmishers move with varying intervals, arms at the
trail.
Dressing, keeping step, and fixed words of command are
to be dispensed with.


■l. The movements of skirmishers may be performed
cither at the double, iu quick time, at the quickest pace pos-
sible consistent with accurate shooting, or by creeping
along the ground as in stalking game.
At drill, skirmishers will always extend at the double,
5. The instructor will name a direction, or place, as being
the known or supposed position of the enemy, which is
called the “ Objective.”
6. Although words of command are given for preliminary
drill purposes, it is to be distinctly understood that in skir-
mishing work all orders, so far as is possible, are to bo
conveyed by signal only.
7. The foregoing rules, and the principles involved by the
following instructions, are equally applicable, whether the
men are mounted or on foot for dismounted service.
Sec. 64. Extending.
The First Method has been already described (Part L, A,
Sec, 39), when it is required to oooup} r a frontage or position
of which the centre and flanks are fixed by defined marks,
such as trees, &c.
This method is in all respects the best, as it leaves much
to the individual intelligence of each man (or section).
Second Method. —-In the event, however, of there being
no distinct object, or when it is required to extend from
behind cover, it may be desirable to proceed as follows, and
the extension will be made by indicating the number of
paces required for extension from any named man (or
section), thus :


From the Right
(Left or
Centre)
to
paces, Extend.
From Line to the Front.
r 1. From the Halt. All except the
1 named man (or section) will spring to
attention, turn outwards, step off, and
extend the ordered number of paces, halt,
order arms, turn in the original direction,
stand at ease.
2. On the March. —The extension will
be made on the same principles, the named
j man (or section) continuing to move
straight on, the remainder making a half-
turn outwards, and breaking into double
time. As each man gains his interval in
the alignment, he will turn in the original
direction, and break into quick time. If
moving at the double the named file will
continue to move at the double, the re-
i mainder turning outwards, and quickening
I their pace until they complete the extension.
3. From Column of Sections or File. —lf the extension is
from the head of the column the order will be From the
Right (or Left) to — paces. Extend.
If it is required to extend to both flanks the order will
be No. 1 Squad (or Section), From the Right, No. 2, From
the Left, to — paces, Extend.
A man (or section) will be invariably named to direct,
and “ the objective ” or point upon which he is to march
will be clearly pointed out to him, and also to the remainder
of the men.


Sec. 65. Closing.
1. From, the halt. —All except the man
(or section) named will spring to attention.
The remainder will turn inwards and
move off, halting, ordering arms, and turn-
ing towards the enemy as they reach their
places.
2. On the march. — The man (or section)
name d continue to move on; the
remainder will make a half-turn inwards
-j and close in double time, turning to the
front and breaking into quick time, as they
reach their places.
3. When retiring. —On the command
Close, the man (or section) named will
continue to move on in quick time, the
remainder, making a half-turn inwards and
breaking into double time, will close in,
breaking into quick time as they arrive in
their places.
n /7 n if
(Left or^ 1
' -L r ,
ose '
Intervals between men (or sections) of the extended line
may be varied at the will of the commander either by
naming objects for increased or decreased extension or by
indicating the number of paces.
Sec. 66. Advancing or Retiring or Moving to a Flank.
The men (or sections) will advance or retire as directed,
care being taken that the unit of direction moves direct
upon the objective.
In moving to a flank the men (or sections) will make a
half-turn in the direction indicated by the order “ Bight
(or Left) Incline,” resuming the original direction on the
“ Advance ” (“ Retire ”).
M.S.M. /


Sec. 07. Changing Direction and Change oj Front.
Change
Direction
to the Right
(or Left).
The man (of section) on the flank named
will turn in the required direction (which
will bo indicated by signal), and if on the
march, will continue to move on in quick
(or double) time, the remainder moving
■ into their places in double time (or at a
quicker pace). Each man (or section) will
halt, or break into quick (or double) time
as he arrives in the new alignment, and
the directing section will be given a new
point to march on.
The change of direction may also be made upon a central
man (or section), whereupon the men (or sections) on the
inner flank will conform to the new direction and gain their
original distance as soon as possible.
A change of front of skirmishers, whether on the march
or at the halt, is executed in a similar manner.
When the men are mounted and the front therefore
much extended, the changes of front will usually take
place on a central unit.
Sec. 68. Relieving Skirmishers.
1. In relieving a Hue of skirmishers, when halted, the
new line extends under cover, advances up to the old line,
and takes up their position in the intervals. The old line
then retires, under the protecting tire of the new line, and
closes when it reaches cover.
2. In relieving a line of skirmishers while retiring, the
new line extends a considerable distance to the rear, and
each man (or section) selects a good position. The old line
doubles through the new, and closes when it reaches cover.


Sec. 69. Reinforcing Skirmishers.
A line of skirmishers is reinforced in a manner similar
to that described for relieving skirmishers halted.
Skirmishers should he reorganised, when a favourable
opportunity occurs, so as to preserve their original units of
sections, troops and squadrons intact.
Sec. 70. Advancing (or Retiring ) by Alternate Lines of Men
(or Sections) in Skirmishing Order.
The advance (or retreat) of one line of skirmishers
passing through another should he constantly practised
both on foot and mounted.
This formation is especially valuable when the line of
skirmishers which is directed to advance (or retreat) to a
further position and can be covered in its advance (or
retreat) by the line of skirmishers already in position.
The old line of skirmishers already in position should
not be moved until the new line has established itself in ils
new position. The old line can then either ad vance further
by passing through the line last posted, or it can be closed
and form support.
Sec. 71. Halting.
When skirmishers are retiring or inclining, and the halt
is ordered, they will invariably turn to the front and lie
down, or, if at preliminary training, stand easy.
Sec. 72. Cover.
1. The paramount importance of concealment must be
impressed on all ranks. One officer showing himself may
betray the fact that a position is occupied ; or that an out-
flanking movement is in progress. Officers and non-com-
missioned officers must be careful to set an example in this
respect, and see that it is followed by the men.


2. On broken ground, every man, if possible, will halt
behind cover. When halted behind cover the men will
stand, kneel, or lie down, according to the nature of the
shelter ; in the open they will lie down, keeping their heads
low.
3. An almost universal rule in making use of cover is to
always fire from the bottom and the right, if possible, and
not from the top or the left ; for example, lying down at
the foot of a tree and to the right, and not standing behind
it, or round the bottom of a boulder and not over it. If a
skirmisher finds that there is no cover handy to his line of
advance, or that the cover which exists is already occupied,
he must throw himself down in the open, and lie as flat as
possible.
4. When engaged in bush, high crops, long grass, gorse,
&c., which only give cover from view, skirmishers must be
careful never to show themselves except when actually
firing, and then as little as possible, and never in any cir-
cumstances to crowd together.
They must never expose themselves on the skyline, or
against a background which would show them up.
5. In making use of rests for their hand in levelling their
rifles, skirmishers must be careful to avoid allowing the rifle
to rest upon or against a rock or hard substances, which,
causing a “jump,” makes accurate shooting impossible.
Sec. 73. Skirmishing Practice and the Distribution of
Troops in Skirmishing Order. (Plate XVI.)
1. As soon as the preliminary training is completed the
practical application of the principles inculcated will be
taught on broken ground and with horses. Without con-
stant practice over undulating, wooded, hilly, mountainous,
or rocky country, men can never become efficient
skirmishers.


2. Silence and attention must be strictly maintained,
and although uniformity is not to be demanded, each man
should move with the utmost smartness and alacrity.
When taken out into the field, the soldier is often apt to
imagine that a relaxation of discipline is permitted, and
that even at attention thealertness and instant obedience of
the barrack-square is not required. This spirit cannot be
too strongly repressed.
3. The troops allotted to skirmishing practice will now
be divided (should the numbers available admit) into
skirmishing or firing line and supports. ( Vide Plate XVI.)
A reserve may be added if there are troops sufficient.
Plate XYI.
SKIRMISHING PRACTICE.
Two Thoops extended in a Line op Skirmishers (or
Firing Line), by Sections, with the remaining
two Troops op the Squadron in support.


N.B.—The extension from A to JB and the distance from A
and C will vary according to the ground and to the proximity
of the enemy. When the squadron is mounted, the interval
from A to B should for instructional purposes vary from
500 yards to 3 or 4 miles.
The supports should conform to the movements of the
skirmishers and relieve or reinforce as required.
The reserve (if any) will conform to the movement of the
support.
The principles upon which the skirmishers or firing line
suppoits and reserve will be worked are dealt with in F.
(Attack) and G. (Defence) of this Part.

COMBINED TACTICS.
Note, —The following sections deal \vith the combined
tactics of the three arms : Mounted Troops, Artillery, and
Infantry, as follows; —ln the Attack, Src. 70-74, and in
the Defence, Sec. 77-79, all inclusive.
ATTACK.
Sec. 74. —General Principles.
1. Modern improvements have tended to assimilate the
tactics of the three arms—Mounted Troops, Artillery, and
Infantry.
Fire is the predominant factor with all three.
No fixed rules, however, can be laid down for the attain-
ment of a superiority of fire upon the field of battle.
The first condition is an intelligent use of ground, not
only on the part of the commander, but of all officers and
men ; and on no two battlefields are the physical features
exactly alike. The second condition is the concentration
of superior force, moral or material, at the decisive point;


and on no two battlefields are the elements that constitute
this force identical. It is impossible, therefore, to fight
battles in accordance with a sealed pattern.
2. The tactical outcome of the effects of modern tire and
of smokeless powder is that a small force, judiciously posted,
can easily hold its own against superior numbers.
To a certain extent this favours the force that stands on
the defensive position. Many more men than formerly can
be spared for the reserve, and to deliver the counter-stroke.
The force, however, that attacks, provided, as will generally
be the case, that it is numerically superior, profits in an
almost equal ratio. The strength of the assailant has
always lain in his power of manoeuvring, of hiding his
movements, and of massing unexpectedly against some
weak or ill-defended point. To-day his power of manoeu-
vring is greater than before. The increased strength of the
local defensive renders it comparatively easy for him to
form with part of his force an impenetrable screen, behind
which the remainder can move unmolested and unobserved:
while a small detachment will suffice to guard his commu-
nications. Again, the object of his manoeuvres will be to
place a portion of his force on the flank of the line he is
attacking. If he can accomplish this, the tremendous effect,
moral and physical, of enfilade fire, will go far towards
causing the evacuation of the position.
On the other hand, in order to win a decisive victory, to
carry out the pursuit, and to annihilate his enemy, the
defender, at some time or other, must leave his position and
attack. But the time, if not the place, of the counter-
stroke, must depend on the adversary’s movements; and a
few minutes too soon or too late may make all the difference
between success and failure.
3. All military operations, both offensive and defensive,
are much more likely to be successful if they partake of


the character of a surprise. If the assailant’s cavalry is
well handled, the direction of the advance of his wain body
may escape detection until it is too late for the defender to
take counter-measures.
Sec. 75. Plan of Attack and Objective.
1. The officer commanding the assailants will base his plan
of attack upon the information which has been gained by a
thorough reconnaissance conducted by the mounted troops.
2. As a rule, the first objective will be the locality, or
localities, which facilitate the concentration of superior
force and the development of an effective fire against the
most vulnerable part of the position. When these localities
have been seized, strengthened against counter-stroke, and
the ground beyond carefully reconnoitred, the position itself
will be attacked ; and the objective will be that point where
the commander intends to break the enemy’s line.
The first thing to determine is the vulnerable point, i.e.,
the objective; the next, the form of attack ; the next, the
distribution of the troops.
3. The objective, as stated above, will be the most vulner-
able point; and against this point the main, or decisive,
attack will be directed, while a secondary attack holds the
enemy to his ground elsewhere. In order to combine the
greatest moral and materia! effect, the foim of attack, unless
the flanks rest on impassable obstacles, will always be
enveloping, and the strongest effort will be made against
the most sensitive part of the position.
Whether the secondary, or holding, attack is to be pressed
home depends on circumstances. As a rule, in order to
carry out their object, and prevent the enemy from thinning
his line to strengthen the vulnerable point, it will be neces-
sary for the troops making the secondary attack to act with
considerable vigour.


4. The principles that govern the distribution of the three
arms are as follows :
The entire strength of the artillery will be brought into
action as soon as the plan of attack has been decided
on.
The infantry or mounted troops on foot on whom the
brunt of the attack must fall, will be formed in
greater strength, and consequently in greater depth,
opposite the point where it is intended to break the
enemy’s line, and in less strength where it is intended
merely to hold him to his ground.
The whole or a portion of the mounted troops, whether
they take part in the attack or not, will be so placed
that they can take up the pursuit the moment the
enemy retreats.
Sec. 76. —The Attach.
1. The Artillery will come into action under the protec-
tion of the advanced guard. Its first object will be to beat
down the fire of the enemy’s guns ; the second to bring an
overwhelming fire to bear on the spot selected for the main
attack.
2, In this preparation the attacking infantry or mounted
troops on foot will almost always be called upon to take
part ; for the defenders, if there is no fear of their position
being rushed, will take care not to expose themselves, and
the attacking artillery will have no target. If, on the
other hand, the attacking force establishes itself within
effective range, i.e., within 1,200 yards of the position, and
seizes points of vantage which intimately affect the defence,
the enemy will be bound to bring his infantry into action.
Unless the ground is particularly favourable it will seldom
be advisable to advance to decisive range until the defending
infantry has been exposed to a heavy fire of artillery.


3. When it is considered that the defence is sufficiently
crippled and demoralised the advance will be resumed, and
the leading units, reinforced from the rear whenever they
are checked, and covered by the fire of both infantry and
artillery, will fight their way up to decisive range, i.e.,
within 600 yards of the enemy’s front. There they will
endeavour to establish themselves, if possible, in good fire-
positions, and, still in co-operation with the artillery, to
subdue the enemy’s fire until it becomes possible to push
in to closer range.
Sec. 77. —The Assault.
While the troops told off to develop the attack are engaged
in the struggle for fire superiority, and have probably become
wholly absorbed in the firing-line, the remainder of the
attacking force, with the exception of some portion of the
reserve, will come up in rear of the point which has been
selected for assault, and which is to be carried with the
bayonet, cost what it may. The critical moment has now
come. The artillery pours in the most rapid fire, and orders
are given for the final advance of the infantry or mounted
troops on foot. Strong reinforcements, if possible, are
thrown in, and, as they strike the firing-line, carry it with
them, and pressing forward with the utmost vigour and
resolution, regardless of losses, rurh the position with the
bayonet.
Sec. 78. The Pursuit.
1. No victory is complete unless it is instantly followed
up. All the available troops should be employed, and no
time should be allowed the enemy to rally, to take up a
fresh position, or to form rear guards. The exhaustion or
losses of the troops cannot be accepted as an excuse for not
pursuing, for no matter how hardly a victorious army may


have been tried, the condition of a defeated army must be
far worse.
2. The action ot the mounted troops and artillery should
be characterised by great boldness. Every gun should be
brought into action at decisive range ; and while the
mounted troops pressing round the flanks, endeavour to
head off the retreat, to capture the artillery, and to keep
the flying masses on the run, the infantry, reforming as
rapidly as possible, and replenishing their ammunition,
should be prepared to follow at a moment’s notice.
3. It will be difficult, however, to make timely prepara-
tion for the pursuit during the progress of the fight; and
the commanders of the mounted troops in default of definite
orders, must take upon themselves the responsibility of
reaping the fruits of victory, and, in any case, of keeping
touch with the enemy.
Sec. 79. The Squadron in Attack (on foot).
General Rules.
1. The principles of formation for troops employed in the
attack are based upon those laid down for “ The Occupation
of a Position,” Part I, Sec. 39, and upon the rules and
detail given under the head of “ Skirmishing,” Part I, E,
Sec. 59, &c.
So far as the rank and file are concerned there is nothing
further to learn except how to apply ohe same intelligently
and to the best advantage in accordance with the general
principles laid down above.
2. In executing an attack independently, the squadron
commander will employ his four troops in accordance with
the general principles. He will see that his front and
flanks are protected by scouts; and after as thorough a
reconnaissance as his means permit, he will carefully explain
to the subordinate leaders and men the object to be attained


and the plan of action. He will point out the “objective,”
and indicate the position or front which he intends to cover.
He will tell off the squadron into firing-line and support,
arrange, if possible, for outflanking the enemy, by a detach-
ment probably mounted, keep a small reserve in his own
hand, probably mounted, and act in almost all respects in
the same manner as the commander of a considerable force.
3. In executing an attack in conjunction with other
squadrons the squadron commander must explain the orders
he has received. He will similarly point out the “objective”
and indicate the position or front allotted to the squadron.
4. During the advance the squadron commander should
place himself where he can best watch the firing-line and
the enemy, and at the same time issue orders to his support.
His duties in action are as follows :
(1) He is responsible that his squadron is supplied with
. extra ammunition before going into action, and will
make the necessary arrangements to bring up a
further supply.
(2) He will be careful to co-operate with the other
squadrons, to cover their advance by fire, and to
maintain the direction.
(3) He will keep the commanding officer acquainted with
any change in the dispositions of the enemy, and
pass on all information rece’ved from the scouts.
(4) He will exercise a general control over the fire of
his squadron, and decide when it should be opened.
(5) He will decide when to reinforce the firing line, bearing
in mind that the longer a few men can gain ground
unassisted, the better will bo the chance of ultimate
success.
(6) He will give the necessary orders for changes of direc-
tion or front.


(7) He will be on the look-out to support other sqnadions
by changing direction temporarily, and enfilading,
or firing obliquely on, a portion of the enemy’s line.
(8) He will take every opportunity of rallying and re-
organising his squadron.
(9) He will lead his men in the assault.
(10) If the assault succeeds, he will lose no time in rally-
ing and re-forming his men, in replenishing ammuni-
tion, and preparing for counter-attack.
5. Troop-leaders in the firing line will place themselves
where they can best supervise the skirmishers; when in
support they will be in front of their troops. Their duties in
action are as follows ;
(1) They must he constantly on the look out for the signals
of the squadron commander.
(2) They must maintain the direction.
(3) They will see that fire is not wasted, and that it is con-
centrated on important targets.
(4) They will observe the enemy’s movements, and report
at once to the squadron commander.
(5) They will lead the men from cover to cover and in the
assault.
(6) If the assault succeeds, they will lose no time in rally-
ing and re-forming their troops.
(7) During the advance they will take all leaderless men of
other squadrons and corps under their command, and
keep them so until the action is over, or the force
re-forms.
6. The frontage occupied by a squadron acting dismounted
and independently depends on the nature of the operations.
A portion of the squadron, extended at wide intervals, may be


told off merely to hold the enemy, while the remainder, at
closer intervals, makes the decisive attack.
The rule that a strong firing line should be established in a
good fire position at decisive range must always be observed
by the portion of the squadron which is told off for the decisive
attack ; and although the men need not be so dose as in
the case of larger forces, still, to dislodge an enemy of nearly
equal strength, the firing line, at decisive range, should not be
weaker than one rifle to every two or three yards of front.
7. The squadron commander, whether acting independ-
ently or in concert with others, will be guided by circum-
stances in deciding on the number of skirmishers he will
extend in the firing line, and on the formation of the re-
mainder. During the delivery of the assault on the enemy’s
position, the men will cheer and bugles be sounded.
Sec. 80. The Regiment in Attack.
General Rules.
The commanding officer will act upon the same principle as
explained for the squadron commander in relation to his four
troops. He will decide upon his objective, and upon the
front or position to be covered, allotting a portion to each
squadron upon the principles indicated in Sec. 39. He will
detail a certain portion of his regiment for the flank attack
who will probably be mounted, and a portion for the holding
attack in front. He wall make arrangements, if the ground
admits, for covering the advance by long range fire, and he
will retain the reserve at his own disposal, which should be
mounted or in close proximity to their horses.
In issuing his orders, he will be careful to communicate
to all concerned everything that is known of the enemy—
his own intentions, and his position during the action.
The officer commanding a brigade or larger unit than a
regiment will act in a similar manner.


G.
DEFENCE.
Sec, 81. General Principles.
From a perusal of the General Principles for the Attack
laid down in F, it will he seen that the effects of modern fire,
and of smokeless powder, enables a small force, judiciously
posted, to hold its own against superior numbers; that the
defensive has gained in power of resistance, but has lost in the
power of inflicting a decisive defeat; that the offensive has
gained in facility of manoeuvring, but has lost in the facility of
acquiring information. The defender must not, however, be
content with repulsing the attack. Such tactics, although at
the moment they may spare life, are likely in the long run to
be more costly and less effective than more vigorous methods;
and in order to bring a campaign to an end in as short a
time as possible, every general engagement should be a bid
on both sides for a decisive victory.
The commander of the defence may be certain that merely
beating back the attack will avail him nothing ; he must,
therefore, be prepared not only to defend his position, but
also to take the offensive when opportunity offers, or, in
other words, to make a counter-attack.
2. Tactics in the defence have the same end in view as in
“ Attack,” viz., the attainment of superiority of fire pre-
paratory to an attack with the bayonet.
3. The manner in which a defensive position is occupied
depends on the strategical object, on the character of the
operations, on the physical features, and on the strength,
morale, and composition of the troops engaged. It is thus
impossible to lay down precise rules; and the only reliable
guides are a thorough knowledge of the effects of fire, a
practised eye for ground, and an appreciation of the great
results to be derived from a well-timed and energetic
offensive.


4. A commander who intends to fight a decisive action on
a defensive position has two distinct objects to keep in
view ;
(1) The defence of his line of retreat.
(2) Counter-attack.
5. The troops will be divided into two main portions, one
for the defence, the other the General Reserve for the
delivery of the decisive counter-stroke.
The troops detailed for the defence should be divided
into two bodies ;
The first to resist the attack with fire, i.e., the firing line.
The second, the support or local reserve, to support the
first and to clear the front by local counter-strokes.
The General Reserve will usually be posted in rear of the
centre. It may, however, be echeloned in rear of a flank
when facilities are offered for a counter-stroke.
The mounted troops acting mounted with the forces on
the defensive should do their utmost to delay the enemy. A
proportion should be allotted to the General Reserve.
Sec. 82. The Position.
The chief requisites of a position are as follows :
( a) The locality chosen should satisfy the strategical
object.
(b) The extent of the position should be suitable to the
strength of the defending force; i.e., there should be
enough men and guns to fulfil the object of the com-
mander, the maintenance of the position or entrench-
ment, and the delivery of a decisive counter-stroke.
(c) A clear field of fire over the country in front and on the
flanks, and no dead or unseen ground within effective
range.
(d) Flanks resting on ground naturally strong, or made so
by entrenchments.


(e) Good cover.
(/) Good artillery positions, not necessarily command-
ing, but with a clear field of fire, and so situated
as to provide flanking as well as frontal fire.
(y) Sufficient depth and good lateral communication in
rear of the entrenchments, so as to allow the free
passage of troops to any desired point.
( h) Good means of retreat; if possible, several roads or
tracks, and a strong rallying position in rear.
Sec. 83. Retreat.
1. If timely precautions have been taken, such as the
selection and reconnaissance of rallying positions, commu-
nication (confidential) of the line of retreat to officers com-
manding sections of the defence and reserves, proper
disposition and early withdrawal of supply trains and
ammunition columns, a defeated army may be to some
extent saved the enormous loss and demoralisation which
are the usual concomitants of retreat.
2. The rallying position should be occupied by some
portion of the artillery, and by infantry units which still
retain their organisation : the mounted troops, aided by a
strong force of artillery, will check the enemy’s advance
from the captured position ; while the remainder of the
force, with the exception, if possible, of a re‘ar-gnard in
support of the mounted troops, will move as rapidly as
possible to the shelter of the rallying position, and there
reorganise.
3. Officers commanding retreating troops must recognise
that the greatest danger will arise from attacks in flank
delivered by the enemy’s mounted troops and horse artillery;
if possible, therefore, they should take precautions that all
commanding heights, parallel to the line of retreat, are
occupied by flank guards.


Sec. 84. The Squadron in Defence [on Foot).
The squadron will act in accordance with the principles
laid down above.
Every effort should be made to deceive the eneniv as to
the extent of the position and to the number of troops
employed. Every stratagem should be resorted to with
this intention. A few men should be constantly changing
their position and open with magazine fire, &c.
All dead ground in front and on the flanks should be
observed by scouts.
A few men only should be placed in the firing-line at
first, the remainder being kept under cover until the enemy’s
infantry advance.
The duties of the squadron commander are as follows:
1. To see—
That every man has good cover, and can use his rifle.
That the firing-line is well hidden, and the existence
of entrenchments concealed.
That ranges are taken.
That every man knows the ranges.
That every man has plenty of ammunition and a
full water-bottle.
That the support knows the position of the firing-line.
2. He will also ascertain the position of the dressing
station and of the reserve ammunition.
3. He will report to his commanding officer all move-
ments of the enemy.
4. He will control the fire of his men ; and, unless he
assigns these duties to his subalterns, he will point out the
targets, and fix the range.
5. He will see that his flanks, if exposed, are protected
by scouts.
6. He will send out scouts, and keep himself informed
of the enemy’s movements.


I. He will be careful to keep touch with the squadrons
on either flank.
h. He will keep a sharp look-out for opportunities for
local counter-attacks, and report them at once.
9. He will hold his position until ordered to leave it.
10. When acting independently, he will give orders for
the fire to commence.
The duties of the troop leaders are similar to the above.
Sec. 85. The Regiment in Defence.
General Rules,
The commanding officer will act upon the general prin-
ciples laid down above. His duties are similar to those
indicated for the squadron leader. He should further make
himself acquainted with the line of retreat, and have all
his dispositions made and a rallying position selected in
rear.
The General Reserve will be. under the command of the
second in command, but will be under his direct control, and
will receive the signal from him for the counter-stroke.
The officer commanding a brigade or larger unit than a
regiment will act in a similar manner.


PART II.—EQUITATION, HORSE MANAGE-
MENT, ANT TRAINING, &c.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
Although men joining a mounted corps, such as those for
whom this Manual is drawn up, infantry men excepted, are
expected to have a knowledge of riding, and the manage-
ment of horses, it is necessary for uniformity that rules
should be laid down regarding instruction in horsemanship
for those who require it. The military system of riding,
mounting, dismounting, and manoeuvring led horses may
be easily acquired by men experienced with horses.
Little thought or care is, as a rule, bestowed upon horses
in those countries and in those districts, where horses are
cheap and numerous, but campaigning and military service
generally necessitate the utmost attention being paid to
the care and maintenance of the horses. There are also
certain considerations in horsemanship the necessity for
which may not be obvious at first sight. It is not an
uncommon practice in some countries for men to ride hard,
and often to its utmost limit of endurance, a certain horse,
and then to turn him out, not, perhaps, to see or think of
him again for some days, or even weeks ; this system allows
him ample time to recover his condition, or for any saddle
galls or sores to cure themselves. Such a condition of things
is entirely inapplicable to a campaign, or to military service,
where each man has only one horse upon which he has
solely to rely for his efficiency as a mounted soldier. This
horse has to endure hard and continued work, frequently
under most unfavourable conditions, upon little and indif-
ferent food, and with occasionally a short allowance of
water, consequently horses, especially if grass fed, fall away


in condition to an appalling extent. As the condition of
a horse disappears so do his bones become exposed, and
liable to the slightest injury or abrasion. Therefore, the
most assiduous care and attention to the riding and hand-
ling of their horses can alone prevent a body of mounted
men from becoming hopelessly inefficient.
Military equitation consists in the skilful and ready
application of the “aids in. horsemanship” by which the
rider guides and controls his horse in all its paces, and in a
settled balance of the body, which enables him to preserve
a firm seat in every variety of movement.
“Aids in horsemanship” are the motions and proper
applications of the bridle hand and leg to direct and deter
mine the turnings and paces of the horse, by which the horse
will obtain a light mouth and yield to the impulse he
receives from the rider, who should be able to guide his
horse with his bridle hand and legs, and be capable on all
occasions of preserving a firm seat, and of having his right
hand and arm at full liberty for the use of his weapons.
Horses are to be ridden on all four reins (except for
inspection, when they will be ridden on the bit as laid
down), and kept well up to their bits either at a walk or a
trot. At the trot each man should rise in the stirrups,
always throwing the weight of his body forward. The
weight of the body should be almost entirely supported by
the knees and thighs pressing against the horse’s sides, and
by the feet resting in the stirrups. In this manner the
weight of the body, being hardly ever upon the seat of the
saddle, is borne by the side bars. The weight is thus
supported by the ribs of the horse, and the possibility of
injuring the ridge bone is minimised.
The training of the horse is a matter of the greatest
importance to the efficiency of all mounted troops. Although
it is unnecessary that the horses provided for mounted


troops, who rely mainly upon their dismounted action, should
be as highly trained us those provided for cavalry, whose
primary duty is the effective use of sword or lance, yet it is
of the utmost consequence that all horses should stand still
to be mounted, should be easily handled in manoeuvre,
should stand fire, and above all lead well.
No pains should be spared to reach this standard of
efficiency, and every effort should be made to train the
horses to stand quite still by themselves when their riders
dismount to tire, the reins being thrown over the head.
A.
RIDING INSTRUCTOINS.
General Remarks.
The following instruction in military equitation will be
carried out at the discretion of the responsible officers
concerned, and to the extent required for the proficiency of
their men in horsemanship and handling of horses.
It cannot be too strongly impressed upon all mounted
troops that a very high degree of horsemanship is impera-
tive if full justice is to be done to the service for which such
troops are raised. The idea that a•“ rough and ready "
horseman is all that is required cannot be too strongly
repressed. Sore backs for the horses and lack of confidence
in presence of the enemy on the part of the men are the
certain results of bad horsemanship.
Sec. 1. Method of Imparting Instruction, &c.
1. Mounted infantry men and occasionally others will on
joining require instruction in riding and in the manner of
holding their reins and rifles when mounted. This will, in
the first instance, be most conveniently taught in a riding
school or open manege.


It must always be remembered that the officers alone are
responsible for the instruction of their men in riding as well
as in their other duties.
Having been shown how to saddle and bridle their horses,
to take their reins over, &c., the men should lead their
horses to the school, and when there be instructed as to
mounting, <fec.
Should the horses be raw and untrained, as may happen
abroad, the men should be mounted, shown how to hold
their reins, and their stirrups put right for them, one by one.
The greatest care should be observed to prevent a man
losing confidence in his first efforts to manage his horse. It
must be borne in mind that especially in the ease of infantry
the men have been selected for service as mounted infantry
on account of their qualifications as soldiers, and their
treatment, therefore, while under instruction, should be
that of picked and highly-trained infantrymen.
The lessons should not be too long, and should be con-
ducted with patience and care. Men should not be kept
too long at preliminary riding instruction ; but as soon
as they possess a fair knowledge of how to ride, the proper
method of holding the reins, how to dismount and mount,
they should be taken into the field.
The first object to be sought for in riding instruction is
to give the men confidence and an easy firm seat, they will
be taught to sit erect, to rise in the stirrups, and to adopt
as nearly as possible what may be termed the “ hunting
seat.”
In doing this, care must be taken that the men do not
ride too short, and as a result sit on the cantles of the
saddle instead of well down in- the middle of it. They
should be told how to preserve their seat and balance by
the grip of the thighs, and at the same time to sit easily
and without stiffness, with the whole figure pliant and


accompanying each movement of the horse, while the
elbows and lower limbs are steady.
It must be pointed out to them that a man must guide
his horse by his legs as much as by his hands, and that if a
horse is ridden with a light give-and-take feeling he will not
pull at his rider. They must also be taught to use the side
of the leg and to keep their heels well down and out. Spurs
are not required except for sluggish horses.
Great care should be taken at all times, and especially
when on a march or when the horses are being exercised,
to prevent the men from sitting on their horses in a slovenly
lounging way.
During the preliminary riding instruction bridoon reins
only should be used, and afterwards bits should only be put
on those horses which require them. (At Aldershot, and
where regular equipment is drawn for mounted infantry,
the Portmouth reversible bit is drawn instead of the
cavalry bit and bridoon. This, with a single rein, is lighter,
simpler and more suitable for the mounted infantry man,
and also for the class of horse on which he is usually
mounted.)
It must be carefully impressed upon the men that horses
must be kept at “Attention” whenever the men are in that
position, in other words the horse must be “collected ” and
held in hand by the legs being closed and the reins tightened.
Unless this is done it will not be possible for the men to
move off simultaneously upon the word “ March” a most
essential matter.
The horse will equally be allowed to “ Stand at Ease ”
when the man sits at ease.
Sec. 2. Leading and Standing to tJie Horse.
“ Attention , Reins Over.” —The men standing on the near
side of the horse in line with the horse’s fore feet will pass


the bridoon reins over tlie head and hold them with the
right hand, the forefinger between them near the rings of
the bridoon; the right arm bent. The hand as high as the
shoulder. The end of the reins in the left hand which hangs
easily behind the thigh.
“ Stand at Ease.” —Each man will carry off the left
foot as in foot drill, but the right hand will slide down the
bridoon rein to the full extent of the arm, the rein being
retained in the hand, and the left hand will hang down by
the thigh.
“ Attention .”—As in foot drill, toes in line with horse’s
fore feet, holding the reins as before.
“In Front of your Horses.” Each man will take a full (
step forward with the right foot and turn to the rightabout
on the ball of it, taking the bridoon reins in each hand near
the rings, still holding the ends in the left hand, raising
the horse’s head to the height of his shoulder, 6 inches from
his breast, and making his horse stand even, hands and
elbows to be as high as the shoulder. (In this position a
man shows a horse to an officer when halted.)
“Dress.” —When fronting the horses, the men will dress
to the centre or flank, as directed.
“ Stand to your Horses.” —Each man will take a full step
forward with the right foot, to the horse’s near side, and face
left about on the ball of the right foot, coming to the.
position of “Attention,” fronting the same way as his horse.
The men will be instructed in the preceding positions
and movements when the reins are put over the horses’
heads and hanging on their necks.
“Attention ” as before,'but holding the left rein near the
ring, the right hand raised as high as the man’s shoulder,
the left hand hanging down straight by the thigh.
“Stand at Ease.” —The left foot will be carried off as in
foot drill, but the right hand will slide down the bridoon


rein to the full extent of the arm, the rein being retained in
the hand; the left hand will hang down behind the thigh.
Leading the Horse. —Horses will be led and the reins
held as detailed above.
Leading through a Gate or Doorway. —The man will place
himself in front of his horse, taking a rein in each hand
near the bridoon rings, and stepping backwards, will see
that the horse’s hips are clear of the door posts. When the
horse is through the man will place himself again on the
near side.
Passing an Officer. —When leading a horse past an officer,
a soldier placing himself on the side of the horse on which
the officer is, will turn his head smartly towards him, look-
ing him in the face.
Sec. 3. Mounting.
“Prepare to Mount.” —Turn to the right on the left heel,
placing the right foot opposite the stirrup parallel to the
side of the horse, heels 6 inches apart, take up the bridoon
reins at the end with the right hand, and place the left
hand between them, the near or left rein passing outside
the left hand, and the off or right rein between the first
and second finger; the left hand resting on the neck of the
horse about 12 inches from the saddle.
With the right hand draw the reins up until an even and
gentle feeling of both reins on the horse’s mouth is obtained,
and throw the end of the reins over to the off side. Twist
a lock of the mane round the thumb of the left hand, which
closes firmly on the mane and reins. Place the left foot in
the stirrup as far as the ball of the foot, and the left knee
against the saddle, the right hand on the cantle of the
saddle.
(When using bit and bridoon combined, the bridoon reins
will be held as detailed above, and the bit reins will be


brought up inside them, the near or left hit rein being
outside the little finger, and the off or right bit rein between
the second and third finger, the feeling on the bit being
more gentle than that on the bridoon.)
N.B.—When in line at close interval, the odd numbers
will rein up one horse’s length.
“Mount.” —Spring off the right foot and rise to the
stirrup, and shifting the right band from the cantle to the
pommel of the saddle, bring the right leg over the saddle
clear of the horse, and drop gently into the saddle, placing
the right foot in the stirrup without help of hand or eye ;
quit the mane with the left hand, the pommel with the right
hand. The reins should be held with both hands when
riding without arms.
Mounting with Rifle. —Each man as he turns to the right
will grasp his rifle with his left hand at the lower band,
butt downwards, sling to the rear, and mount as directed in
3. When mounted, he will seize the rifle with the right
hand at the hand guard and bring it to the “ Advance.”
Sec. 4. Dismounting.
(a) “Prepare to Dismount.” —When at close interval, the
odd numbers move up one horse’s length. Draw up the
reins and twist a lock of the mane round the thumb of the
_>eft hand, which must be advanced about 12 inches; take
the right foot from the stirrup and place the right hand on
the pommel of the saddle.
“ Dismount.” —Raise the body from the saddle, support-
ing it on the right hand and left foot, swing the right leg
well clear of the horse and drop smartly on the ground, quit
hold by left hand and foot, and come smartly to the position
of attention.
(h) Dismounting with Rifle —“Prepare to Dismount.”
Each man will raise his rifle smartly in front of his body,


with the sling towards the horse’s head, then lower the butt
under the bridle hand in front of the near wallet, and seize
with the left hand just below the upper band, sling to
the front. The right hand will twist a lock of the mane
round the left thumb,
“Dismount.” —The dismount will be proceeded with as
directed above. When dismounted, the rifle is to he held
at the order in the left hand.
In dismounted duty the rifle is to he shifted from the left
to the right hand when the horse lias been handed over.
In dismounting for dismounted duty, the bridoon rein
will be passed over as follows, in order to enable the horse
to be more readily led by the No. 3 ;
Heins over for leading. —The bit reins are passed over
and in front of the bridoon rein, the bridoon reins are then
passed over the horse’s hea<), and the end of them brought
over the left bit rein in the case of Nos. 1 and 2, and over
the right bit rein in the case of No. 4.
Sec. 5. Method of Holding the Reins and Position of
Hand and Arms.
Bridoon or Reversible Bit, Reins Only. —(a) When riding
without rifles, each hand will hold a rein between the third
and fourth finger, the end being thrown over the forefinger
and the thumb closed upon it; when the horse is in motion
the hands should he about 3 inches from the body, and
from 4 to 6 inches apart, but when sitting at ease they
should bs close together and rest on the front of the saddle,
right hand over the left. Thumbs uppermost, wrist slightly
rounded outwards, back of hands to the front.
(6) When riding with arms, bridoon reins only. The
reins will be taken at the end by the right hand, and the
left hand placed between them, the near or left rein passing
outside the left hand, and the off or right rein passing


between the first and second finger ; the fall of the rein
will then be thrown over the closed fist and be kept in
position by the thumb.
Bridoon and Bit Combined. —The bridoon reins will be
held as detailed above, and the bit reins will be brought up
inside them, the near or left bit rein being outside the
little finger, and the off or right rein between the second
and third fingers. The bridoon and bit reins will then be
drawn up by the right hand until a gentle feeling of the
horse’s mouth is obtained, the feeling on the bit being more
gentle than that on the bridoon.
The reins will then be thrown over the closed fist and
be kept in position by the thumb.
This is termed riding on all four reins.
Bit Reins Only. —When it is required to ride on the bit
reins without using the bridoon, the latter will be slackened
out evenly until the end lies across the palm of the hand.
This is termed riding on the bit.
Position of Bridle Hand. —The upper arm hanging
straight from the shoulders, left elbow lightly touching the
hip; lower arm nearly square to the upper; the hand
opposite the centre of the body, about 3 inches from it,
back of the hand to the front, wrist rounded outwards,
hand as low as possible.
When riding without arms, the right hand will hang
from the shoulder behind the thigh without stiffness, back
of the hand outwards and fingers bent.
Mounted troops, as distinct from cavalry, will rarely be
mounted on trained horses, but usually on those of the
country in which they are serving. Por this reason, and
because manoeuvring in close formation is rarely required
of them, the horses will, when both bits and bridoons are
used, be ridden on all occasions upon all four reins, with
the bit rein barely tight. When being inspected, or in


marching past, horses may be ridden on the bit. The use
of the bit should be taught; it being impressed on the men
the necessity of never pulling dead on it, but always using it
with a give-and-take pressure, using the legs at the same
time to keep the horse collected, and up to the hand.
Sec, 6. Formation of the Ride.
The ride being formed in line down the centre of the
school (Plate XVII., Fig, 1,1), with an interval of 6 inches
between files (i.e., from knee to knee) the word will be
given—
“ Attention .”—The ride to be perfectly steady.
“ Eyes Bight — Dress." —Each man will have his body
quite square to the front, his head well up, and just turned
enough to allow a glance of the eye towards the dressing
point, so as to see the surface of the face of the next man
but one.
“Eyes Front." —Each man will turn his head and eyes
to the front.
“ Walk, March." —(Plate XVII., Fig 1,2). The ride moves
forward together, preserving the dressing. On ariving at
the side, the right-hand man turns his horse to the right
and marches straight forward close to the boards or side of
the school ; the remainder halting, turning to the right in
succession, covering the leading file, and keeping 4 feet
distance from head to croup.
“Leading File, Circle." —(Plate XVII., Fig. 1,3). The
leading file describes a circle according to the strength of his
ride, every man following the track of the leading file and
keeping his distance.
“ Leading File, Change." —The leading file turns his
horse to the right, leads straight through the centre of the
circle, and on arriving at the opposite side, changes the
bend of his horse, turns to the left, and commences the


circle to the other hand; the remainder follow the move-
ments of the leading file.
“ Go Large.” —The loading file goes round by the side of
the school, the remainder following.
Plate XVII.

1 Ride formed.
2 Walk, March.
3 Leading File, Circle.


PLATE XVII,
Fig. 2.
1 Down the Centre.
2 No. 1, Right turn.


“ Trot ” —“ Trot Out.” —The pace is gradually increased to
9 miles an hour.
“Leading File, Left Incline." —The leading file makes a
half turn from the side by a double feeling of the inward
rein, supporting his horse with the outward leg. On arriv-
ing at the opposite side of the school, he squares his horse
by feeling the outward rein and supporting him with the
inward leg and rein, and the bend of the horse is then
changed. The remainder follow the movements of the
leading file and cover.
“ Trot Short.” —The pace is gradually decreased to 7 miles
an hour,
The ride is next told off in two divisions as follows :—On
the command—
“ From the Front, Number.” —The men tell off as pre-
viously instructed. In the case of there being an odd
number of files, No. 1 ride will be made the stronger.
Supposing that there are 16 men, the word will then be
given—
“ Numbers 8 and 9, Flanks of Rides Prove,” —The flank
men of rides smartly stretch out their right hand, at the
full extent of the arm, palm of the hand to the left, fingers
extended and close together, thumb clc ;e to the forefinger,
and level with the top of the shoulder.
If the men are riding on both reins, they pass the right
rein into the left hand while proving.
“As you were." —The men drop their hands smartly to
the usual position.
“Down the Centre.” —(Plate XVII., Fig 2,1), The leading
tile makes a square turn to the right from the centre marker
M.S.M. g


at the end of the school by feeling the inward rein and
closing the outward leg, every man riding up to the same
ground and applying the same aids. In tiling down the
centre, a straight line is to be kept, every man covering to
his front. On arriving at the opposite end, the outward
leg is to be closed to prevent the haunches from flying out.
The whole of No. 1 ride being at the side of the school,
the word is given—
“ N o. 1, Right Turn." —(Plate XYIL, Fig. 2,2), followed
by—
" No. 2, Right Turn.’’ —ln crossing the school care must
be taken that every man keeps his interval of 3J yards
from knee to knee.
"No. 1, Right Turn.’’
"No. 2, Right Turn.” —As soon as No, 2 ride is on the
side of the school, the word is given—
" No. 2, Circle Right’’ (Plate XYIII, Fig. 1,2), followed
by—
" No. 1, Circle Right.’’ — Circles are made from the side of
the school to the centre. In circling, each file causes his
horse to leave the side by a double feeling of the inward
rein, retaining a steady feeling of the outward, the horse
to be well supported by the outward leg. The dressing is by
the right, the ride leaving the side with the leading file, the
centre with the rear file (Plate XVIII., Fig. 1,3), and
arriving again at the side with the leading file. If the
circles are correctly made, there will be an interval of 3J
yards from knee to knee when half-way between the side
and centre of the school, and 4 feet distance from head to
croup when at the centre and side.


“No. 2, Circle and Change ’’—(Plate XVIII,, Fig. 2.)
“No. 1, Circle and Change:'— The dressing changes to the
left as soon as the ride leaves the centre, and when the
circle is nearly completed each tile changes the bend of his
horse (Plate XVIII., Fig. 2,3), and tarns smoothly to the
other hand.
Both rides being now in file, they receive the word—
“ Down the Centre ,” and the ride is continued by the fol-
lowing words of command—
“No. 1, Left Turn.”
“No. 2, Left Turn."
“No. 1, Left Turn."
“No. 2, Left Turn,"
“No. 2, Circle Left."'
“No. 1, Circle Left.”
“No. 2, Circle and Change."
“No. 1, Circle and Change.”
As previously directed,
substituting left for
right in the explana-
tions, and vice versd.
No. 1 ride being on the side of the school, the word is
given—
“ No. 1, Right Incline, ” followed by—
“ No. 2, Right Incline.” —ln inclining, each file makes a
half-turn to the right by feeling the inward rein and closing
the outward leg, and moves in an oblique direction across
the school, dressing by the left. When properly dressed
each man should just see the right cheek and back of the
right shoulder of the second man from him, an interval of
3J yards from knee to knee being kept. On arriving at the
other side of the school, each file squares his horse by feel-

ing the outward rein and supporting him with the inward
leg and rein ; the bend of the horse is then changed, and
the rider covers the leading file.
The ride should occasionally be halted when on the
incline in order to see that each file is placed in the proper
direction and that the dressing is correct.
“No. 1, Left Incline .”
“No. 2, Left Incline.” “Bide — Halt!”
The foregoing movements should be at first practised at
the walk. When the ride shows a certain amount of pro-
ficiency, and the turns and circles, &c., are thoroughly
understood, they should be repeated at the trot to each
hand.
As a rule, all turns and circles should be executed when
the rides are moving from the instructor, so that the dress-
ing and covering shall be toward him, and the men may
more readily attend to his instructions and corrections.
For the same reasons, the inclines across the school should
be made when the rides are moving towards the instructor.
The ride should be frequently halted during the lesson,
and the men dismounted “for dismounted duty,” so as to
accustom them to dismount quickly and form up; then
mount—and the horses stand still.
Sec. 7. Position and Motions of Arms when Mounted.
“Advance Arms.” —The right hand grasping the rifle
behind the backsight is placed with the flat of the rifle
resting on the upper part of the right thigh, muzzle of rifle
pointing just clear of horse’s left ear, and right elbow
slightly inclined outwards,


“ Carry Arms." —From the advance, without moving the
right hand from its grasp of the rifle, place the butt in the
hollow of the right thigh, muzzle to lean to the front, and
slightly to the right, trigger-guard to the left.
.A. non-commissioned oflicer or soldier when reporting to,
or speaking to an oflicer, will carry arms.
"■Return Arms ” (for the Namaqua bucket).--From the
advance place the butt of the rifle in the bucket, letting the
right hand slide up the rifle to the upper band.
“Draw Arms.” —Let the right hand slide down the rifle
to the hand guard, and draw the rifle smartly from the
bucket.
R.B. —Arms will only be returned when moving at a
walk on the line of march.
“ Sit at Rase.” —Bring the rifle from the advance smartly
over the bridle hand, which is to be sunk down on the
pommel.
If it is intended to rest the men the command “Sit Easy”
is to be given, otherwise the men are to sit steady and
silent in their saddles.
A mounted man is expected to perform all his duties
with his rifle in his hand. Orderlies, however, do not
carry rifles, but side arms only.
Sec. 8. Saluliny Mounted.
A man, when mounted without arms, will bring his horse
to a walk within two horses’ length of the oflicer to be
saluted, bringing his right hand up to his bridle hand at the
same time. When half a horse’s length from the oflicer he
will drop his right hand smartly to the position of
“ Attention,” and turn his head towards the oflicer.


If halted, and an officer approaches, he will come smartly
to attention, and turn his head towards the officer when
half a horse’s length distant.
With arms drawn he will observe the same rules as
above, except that he will bring his arras to the “ Garry,”
instead of dropping his right arm to the side
The words of command when paying or returning a com-
pliment are “ Carry Arms” “ Eyes Right (or Left).”
Sec. 9. Officers' Swords, how Carried and Saluting.
Officers will only draw swords when ordered, and upon
inspection or ceremonial parades.
When the men are at the Advance,” officers “Slope
Swords.” When at the “ Garry,” they will “ Carry ”
swords.
When reporting to or speaking to a senior, officers
“ Carry ” swords, “ Salute,” and then “ Garry.” They will
similarly “Salute” when leaving.
General Instructions.
“ Draw Swords.” (1) Pass the right hand smartly
across the body, over the bridle arm, to the sword knot,*
place it on the wrist, give it two turns inwards to secure it,
and as the handle is grasped draw out the blade slowlyf
until the hand is in line with the elbow, turning the edge
to the rear, the right arm close to the body, shoulders
* When the sword is attached to the saddle, it may be necessary to draw out
the blade so as to rest the hilt on the bridle arm before the sword knot is taken and
the handle properly grasped.
t Swords must be drawn from and returned to the scabbards slowly, in order
to preserve the edge.


square to the front. (2) With an extended arm draw the
sword slowly from the scabbard, edge to the rear, in rear
of the left shoulder, and bring it smartly to the Recover , that
is, with the bar of the hilt in line with the bottom of the
chin, blade perpendicular, edge to the left, elbow close to
the body. (3) Lower the sword smartly to the Carry, that
is, with the hilt resting on the thigh, blade perpendicular,
edge slightly inclined to the left, the grasp of the lower
fingers slightly relaxed, little finger in rear of the hilt, arm
close to the body, that part of it between the wrist and the
elbow lightly touching the hip.
“ Slope Swords.”— Bring the lower part of the arm at
right angles to the upper, hand in front of the elbow, relax
the grasp of the second and third fingers, and allow the
sword to fall lightly on the shoulder, midway between the
neck and point of the shoulder, the little finger still in rear
of the hilt.
“ Sit at Ease.” —Keeping the sword at the slope, place
the hands on the front part of the saddle, with the right
hand over the left.
“Attention.” —Come smartly to the position of Slope
Swords.
“ Garry Swords.” —Resume the grasp of the second and
third fingers and bring the blade perpendicular, the hilt
resting on the thigh, as in the third motion of drawing
swords.
“Return Swords.” —Carry the hilt smartly to the hollow
of the left shoulder, blade perpendicular, edge to the left,
elbow level with the shoulder; then, by a quick turn of
the wrist drop the point in rear of the left shoulder slowly
into the scabbard, and resume the position at the end of the
first motion in Draiv Swords, shoulders being kept square
to the front throughout this motion. (2) Return the
sword slowly into the scabbard, release the hand from the


sword knot by giving it two turns outwards, the right hand
remaining across the body in line with the elbow, fingers
extended and close together, back of the hand up. (3)
Drop the right hand smartly to the side.
B.
TRAINING OF THE HORSE.
Sec. 9a. Handling Young Horses.
Untrained or young horses must be gradually accustomed
to the rifle, military exercises, drums, and firing, both
mounted and dismounted. The horse, being naturally
timid, must not have his terror added to by harsh treatment
Patience and gentleness must be observed, and the horse
finding that these sights and sounds do him no injury, and
are not accompanied by chastisement, soon becomes
familiarised with them. One minute’s loss of temper or
violence in the rider may throw the horse back fora month.
Suddenness of movement should be avoided in all practices
with arms, and everything should be done smoothly and
quietly.
To accustom the horse to firing, a blank cartridge should
be fired at the end of each lesson for some days, and a little
corn given to him after it.
The greatest care should be taken to prevent horses,
especially young horses, from acquiring the trick of
refusing to leave the ranks. Horses showing this tendency
should be especially schooled, and if necessary their position
in the troop should be constantly changed.
Sec. 10. Mode of Swimming a Horse.
Occasions may occur on service where a mounted soldier
may be obliged to swim his horse. The rider should then
take up and cross his stirrups to prevent the horse from
entangling himself with them ; he should drop the reins,


seize the mane with one hand near the withers, and throw
himself flat on the water on th» downstream side of his
horse, guiding him as much as possible by splashing the
water against the head and neck, and only using the
bridoon when that means fails. When the horse comes
into his depth, he may again get back to his saddle.
Holding on to the horse’s tail is the safest of all methods of
swimming with the horse.
It is absolutely essential to give the horse complete con-
trol of his head, and it is advisable to remove the bits.
The slightest touch upon the reins alters the position of the
head, and may cause the horse to sink.
Sec. 11. Jumping.
A mounted soldier should avail himself of every oppor-
tunity to practice his horse over jumps, such as fallen trees,
fences, water, and other obstacles.
Sec. 12. Leading.
The horse must be taught to lead well, and horses should
lie frequently exercised over bad ground, the man leading
by the bridoon rein being correctly passed over the horse’s
head in his right hand and with his rifle at the trail in his
left. Blank ammunition should occasionally be fired while
leading.
The Nos. 3 mounted will be frequently practised in lead-
ing the horses of their comrades.
If a hotse at first will not lead, he can be easily taught if
an instructor follows with a whip.
Sec. 13. Saddling.
1. The saddle should be placed in the middle of the horse’s
back; the front of it about the breadth of the hand behind
the play of the shoulder.


2. The numnah should be raised well into the fork over
the withers by putting the arm under it:
3. The girth should admit a finger between it and the
iiorse’s belly. In saddling a horse the girth must be
tightened gradually, and not with violence. It is recom-
mended that the girths of all except young and growing
horses should be fitted so as to be worn at home in the
second or third hole from the free end of the girth strap.
4. The surcingle should lie flat over, and not tighter than
the girth.
5. The breastplate should be so fitted that the upper edge
of the rosette or leather is the breadth of three fingers
above the sharp breast-bone. It should admit the breadth
of the hand between it and the flat of the shoulder, and
also between the martingale (when used) and the horse’s
chest.
6. Rifle Bucket. —The attachment straps are looped round
the rear and iron stay; both are then buckled to the
bucket, adjusted at such a length that the muzzle of the
rifle is rather lower than the man’s shoulder. The stay
strap is passed through the surcingle at about right angles
to the bucket.
7. The blanket can bo folded in several ways. With a
horse of normal shape and condition the following method
is recommended: The blanket is folded lengthways in
three equal folds, one end is then turned over 24 inches,
the other is turned into the pocket formed by the folds ;
the blanket thus folded is placed upon the horse’s back
with the thick part near the withers. Size when folded
2' 0" x T 8", when unfolded 5' 5" x 4' B''. The folding of
the blanket may be modified to suit horses of peculiar con-
formation, and to meet alteration in shape consequent upon
falling away in condition, or from other causes.


JT.B.—The foregoing paragraphs, 5 and 6, refer to the
regulation cavalry pattern saddle. The same principles,
however, hold good with other patterns of saddlery.
Sec. 14. Bridling.
1. The hridoon should touch the corners of the mouth,
but should hang low enough not to wrinkle them.
2. The hit should be placed in the mouth so that the
mouth piece is one inch above the lower tusk of a horse,
and 2 inches above the corner tooth of a mare. This can
only be laid down as a general rule, however, as so much
depends on the shape and sensitiveness of the horse’s
mouth and on his temper.
3. The curb should be laid flat and smooth under the
jaw, and should admit two fingers easily between it and the
jawbone.
4. The headstall should be parallel to and behind the
cheekbone.
5. The noseband should be the breadth of two fingers
below the cheek bone, and should admit two fingers between
it and the nose.
6. The throat lash should admit two lingers between it
and the horse’s jaw.
7. The hridoon rein should be of such a length that,
when held by the middle, in the full of the left hand, with
a light feeling of the horse’s mouth, it will touch the rider’s
waist.
Sec. 15. Instructions for Tent-pegging , Lemon-cutting,
and Tilting at Rings.
Every encouragement should be given to such of the
following exercises as will improve the horsemanship of
the men, and familiarise the horses with their military
surroundings and requirements.


The horses used for these practices will be selected
from the strong and active. Those of a nervous tempera-
ment will not be used.
The exercises are not to take place oftener than twice in
each week, and no horse will be ridden more than four runs
altogether on any day.
At all times an officer, or reliable non-commissioned
officer, who is himself thoroughly well instructed, will be
present and superintend the practice.
They will first learn to ride with spear shafts without
heads at the rings , and afterwards at the pegs with sharp
spears. In riding at the pegs the knuckles must be kept
turned down, and the point of the spear turned a little
outwards, so that the butt end of the shaft may be recovered
over the back, and not over the arm, which is liable to hurt
the wrist.
They should at first be taught to move at a walk, then at
a canter, and when they have become expert with their
weapons, at the full speed of their horses.
The men will be instructed not to pull up their horses too
suddenly after passing the peg.
They should be particularly instructed that, in taking
the peg, speed and style will be taken into consideration in
awarding prizes.
When cutting at the lemon, the chief object should be to
cut with the edge of the sword. i'lo good mark should be
given to a man who merely knocks the lemon off the stick,
or bruises it and does not give it a clean cut.
C.
FIELD FIRING,
Sec. 16. Dismounted Service and Field Firing.
Constant practice in mounting, dismounting, and firing
should be carried out. Every opportunity should be


afforded for voluntary practice, and every possible encourage-
ment given by prizes, &0., to insure the proficiency of men
and horses in all the phases of dismounted service. Firing
with blank ammunition or with Morris’s tube may be substi-
tuted for the regulation practice ammunition when a range
or open country is not available. For purposes of drill the
actual firing may be dispensed with. It is, however, the
best possible training for men and horses to have the pro-
cedure in Sec. 17 constantly carried out both by sections
and troops, and no pains should be spared to interest all
concerned in such an attractive and valuable phase of
their military training.
Sec. 17. Field Firing.
(Plate XIX.)
The field firing is divided into two portions, that of
section firing and of troop firing. The first is individual
practice, when every shot would be effective —the second is
volley or mass firing.
Field firing is always to be practised with horses, and
should, if possible, take place at a different range from the
one used for ordinary target practice.
The following rules are given as a guide for carrying out
troop and section competitions.
(1) Points will be given ;
(a) For shooting.
(b) For riding, leading of troop or section, manage-
ment of led horses by the Nos. 3, &o.
(c) For time.
(2) A course should be chosen, vide Plate XIX., which
will admit of at least three firing points at unknown dis-
tances between 800 and 300 yards from the targets, and


the ground should be of a nature to test the troop or section
leaders’ capabilities in leading, keeping horses under cover,
&C. There should be fences between the firing points ; the
whole distance covered should be not less than a mile and
a-half.
(3) The men should be in “drill order.”
(41 Presuming that there are three firing points, 10
rounds will be fired as follows :
(a) On the order from the umpire to start, each section
or troop will in turn gallop to the first firing point, and
fire 3 rounds.
(b) Gallop to the second firing point and fire 3 rounds.
(c) Gallop to the third point, and fire 4 rounds.
( d) Gallop to the finishing point and halt.
(5) Volley targets should be used for “ troop field firing,”
second-class targets for “ section field firing.”
(6) Troops will fire “ volleys,” hits on target to count
four points.
Sections will fire “ independently” :
Points—Hits.—Bull’s eyes to count ... 4 points.
Centres ~ ... 3 ~
Outers ~ ... 2 ~
A section will be disqualified if any man fires more than
the specified number of rounds at any point.
(7) A miss fire should be brought to the notice of the
umpire at the firing point at once, and the round will be
changed. No allowance will be made for a miss fire reported
afterwards.
(8) Words of command will be given as laid down in the
Firing Exercise.
(9) The following points should be awarded for (6) riding
&c., in sub-para (1).
Very good—ls points
Good 10 ~


Fail' 6 points
Indifferent 3 ~
Bad N one?
(10) Points will be awarded for “ Time ” as follows :
The troop or section doing the competition in the shortest
PLATE XIX.
ILLUSTRATION OF A CUORSE FOR FIELD FIRING.


time will be allowed 25 points; 2 points will be deducted
from that total for every 30 seconds or fractions of 30
seconds in excess of the best or shortest time.
(11) An umpire should be stationed at each firing point.
In awarding points he should take into consideration :
(1) The leading of the troop or section leaders.
(2) Whether the troop or section are kept together
without straggling and in hand.
(3) Whether the proper words of command are given.
(4) The management of the horses by the Nos. 3,
The winning troop or winning section is the one which
obtains the highest net aggregate total points for style and
time, plus the percentage of points to rounds fired.
The above exercises may be varied by troops linking their
horses for dismounted service, or by training horses to stand
with their reins over when their riders dismount to fire.
The No. 3 can be directed to place their horses under
cover until he receives a signal from the section leader, or
he can be directed to lead their horses at a trot, or gallop
round a post during the time that the remainder of the
section are dismounted and firing.


PART III.—DRILL. TRAINING OF THE
SOLDIER MOUNTED.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
Sec. 1. Fundamental Principles of Instruction in Drill.
The principles of drill for the soldier on foot already
explained are identical with those for the soldier mounted,
having regard to the difference as to intervals, distances, and
pace which are necessitated by the animals with which the
mounted troops are provided, viz., horses, ponies, camels, &c.
In war only what is simple can attain success, therefore,
what is simple must alone be taught and practised during
peace time. The principles of drill and manoeuvre contained
in the regulations must be so thoroughly mastered, and the
necessary evolutions so practised, that they shall be capable
of execution with certainty and precision. No exercise
should be learnt on the drill ground which is impossible of
execution on the field of battle.
The essentials of mounted drill are simplicity and rapidity.
The first principle for the execution of any movement is
that each unit is to he led to its position in the new forma-
tion hy the shortest route, in the simplest manner, and as
rapidly as possible, compatible with the preservation of
good order in the ranks.
The object to be kept in view by all commanders when
training any body of mounted men is so to exercise it that
it shall be able to manoeuvre by following its leader with-
out commands or trumpet sounds.
Constant repetition of the same movement should be
avoided, and the length and character of exercises should
be suited to the strength of men and horses.


The following are the principal tests by which the general
drill efficiency of a body of mounted troops can be judged : —-
(а) That commands and signals are obeyed simultaneously
and correctly.
(б) That there is a complete absence of noise and
confusion.
(c) That the various units of command are capable of
being handled by their leaders alike in close or
extended formation by signal and in silence with
rapidity and smoothness.
When in close formation.
( d ) That pace and direction are carefully maintained.
(e) That distances and intervals are correctly kept from
the unit of direction, that wheels are accurately
made, words of command distinctly given, and proper
cohesion and steadiness are properly observed.
When in extended order.
(/) That the men act independently, both singly and by
sections, with confidence, intelligence, and rapidity,
(y) That the troop leaders and the section leaders have
a proper latitude given them.
When any movement or formation is ordered it must be
understood that it is to be performed on the move (i.e., the
troops are to continue in movement after it is completed)
unless the order is preceded by the words “ To the halt.”
Sec. 2 Terms of Formation and Manoeuvre.
A Division. —The largest tactical body in which mounted
troops are formed, usually two brigades.
A Brigade consists of two or more regiments.
A Regiment consists of two, three, or four squadrons.
A Squadron is the tactical unit of mounted troops, and is
composed of two, three, or four troops. Squadrons are
numbered from the right when in line or echelon, and from


Squadron Quarter Column. —A squadron with its troops
at five horses’ lengths distance.
Mass. —Line of squadron columns, closed to two horses'
length interval.
Close Column. —Troops or squadrons in column at one
horse’s length from one another.
Brigade (or Divisional) Line of Masses. A line of two or
more regiments each formed in mass with such deploying
interval as may be ordered plus 16 yards between them.
Brigade Mass or Divisional Mass indicates a brigade or
divisional line of regimental masses at close interval.
Column of Masses. A column of two or more regiments
each formed in mass, one behind the other at such distance
that a Brigade or Divisional Mass can be formed to a flank
by wheeling at a small angle.
Echelon. —A step-like order of bodies of troops. A most
valuable formation, which minimises the danger of enfilade
lire and enables a front to be at once made to a flank in case
of a sudden flank attack.
Direct Echelon. —A line broken into several parts which
move direct to the front or rear in succession, and therefore
do not oveflap or alter their intervals from one another.
Double Echelon. —A form of direct echelon in which, in
the case of squadrons, the centre squadron of a regiment is
advanced to open column distance beyond the flank
squadrons.
Oblique Echelon. —A line broken into several parts, as by
wheels from line or column of more or less than the
quarter circle, so that they are oblique to the former front,
parallel with one another, and either overlapping or less
than their proper interval from one another.
Front. —ln a general sense, the direction towards which
a body of troops or a single man is facing ; with reference


to an alignment, the direction of the real or supposed
enemy.
Flank. —Either lateral extremity of a rank, line, or
column ; also the direction to either hand of a body, at right
angles to its front. Flanks are distinguished as “ right ”or
“left,” according as they are on the right or left of the men
who compose the body, when facing to the front.
Pivot. —The flank on which a body wheels. The man on
that flank is termed the “ pivot man,” or simply the “ pivot.”
Fixed Pivot, —The term applied to the pivot, when dur-
ing the wheel the pivot man is halted and turns upon his
own ground.
Moving Pivot. —The term applied to the pivot, when
during the wheel the pivot man moves on the arc of a circle
without halting.
Alignment. —The straight line on which the front of a
body of troops is formed or is to form.
New Alignment. —The line on which a body of troops is
marching, after it has changed its direction, or on which
troops are to be formed.
Deployment. —The formation of line to the front from
column To avoid the vulnerability of column formations,
as in the case of frontal attack, and *o enable the utmost fire
power to be brought to bear,
Deploying Interval. —The interval between contiguous
columns necessary to enable them to form line to the front.
Change of Front —A new alignment either meeting or
intersecting the former alignment.
Change of Position. —A movement by which a body of
troops moves altogether off its ground, either to the front,
flank, or rear, and reforms on a new alignment.


Base. —Two points marked by officers, non-commissioned
officers or men, placed at a distance apart, to indicate a line
by the prolongation of which the proper alignment of a line,
or the covering of a column is, in certain cases, regulated.
In the former case it is termed an “alignment base,” in the
latter a “covering base.”
Base Body. —That on which a formation is made, or on
which the alignment is at the halt, e.g., “base regiment,”
“ base squadron.”
Directing Body or Unit of Direction. —The body on which
the direction, pace, and alignment of a line, or the direc-
tion, pace, and relative positions of the several parts of a
column or echelon depend, e.g., “ squadron of direction,”
“directing troop,” “section,” or “file.”
Dressing. —The act of taking up an alignment correctly.
Covering, —The act of a body placing itself correctly in
rear of another.
Oblique March and Inclining. —Movements by which
ground is gained to the front and flank simultaneously,
while a general direction is observed parallel to the original
alignment.
Wheeling. —A movement by which a body brings forward
a flank on a fixed or moving pivot.
Troop Guides. —N.C.O.’s placed in the centre or on the
flanks of each troop.
SerreJUes. —Such officers, N.0.0.’5, and others as may be
detailed to ride in rear of a squadron.

ground over which a body of troops is to move.


Parade Movements. —The movements laid down for the
inspection of a regiment or body of troops.
Parade Line. —The line on which troops form for review,
and from which tiie reviewing officer is received and saluted.
Passing Line. —The line on which the troops march past at
a review, and at the centre of which is the reviewing officer’s
post.
Pave. —The denomination of different degrees of speed ;
also a measurement of distance (33 inches) on foot.
A Horse’s Length. —A term of measurement (8 feet).
AHo rse’s Width.—Th ree feet, which includes 3 inches
outside the rider’s knee on either side.

Sec. 4. Commands , Trumpet Sounds , and Signals,
Commands.
It should always be remembered that the way in which
a word of command is given has a great influence on the
manner in which the movement ordered is executed.
In action and in critical occasions the intonation of the
voice and the emphasis given to the words of command are
frequently of the greatest importance in steadying and
reassuring the men.
It must also be remembered that with mounted men it is
especially necessary that words of command be given loudly
and distinctly.
The executive part must be clearly distinguished from
the cautioning part, and must not follow it too quickly.
The word “ Walh " or “ Trot ” will in every case precede
the word “ March” when the men are mounted.
It must be remembered that the abrupt decisive ending
to an executive word of command, so necessary to make men
on foot move smartly, is not suitable to mounted men, for
whom the word on which they move should be drawn out
and rolled, thus:
“ Walk—M-a-r-r-c-h,” and when the pace is to be increased
to a trot—“ T-r-r-o-t.”
When in squadron, troop leaders, as a rule, give no words
of command unless, owing to dust, mist, darkness, or any
other cause, their troops are unable to distinguish their
signals ; in that event they give the necessary word, but no
louder than is requisite to enable their own troop to hear it.
When under instruction, troop leaders will give words of
command at the discretion of the instructor.
When troops, the squadron being in line, are to act in
the same manner and at the same moment so that the


squadron moves as a single body (as, e.g., in inclining), troop
leaders do not make use of signals ; when, however, they
are to act separately (as, e.g., in wheeling troops to a flank,
advancing in squadron column from line, in changing the
direction of the head of a squadron column, or in the incline
of a squadron column), each troop leadermakes the correspond-
ing signal and directs his troop by the direction and pace of
his horse.
The commands of brigade and division commanders will
be conveyed by gallopers.
Words of command should be sparingly used, in fact, when
once the men have been well instructed and practised under
their own leaders all manoeuvres should be executed in silence
either by means of signals, the whistle being used to attract
attention only, or by conforming to the movements of a
given unit of direction. The power of their leaders to drill
and manoeuvre them with the utmost rapidity and smooth-
ness, but in silence, is the highest test of well drilled and of
handy, intelligent mounted troops.
The leader of every unit must ride in such a position that
he can readily hear the command, the trumpet sound or
whistle, and see signals; he is responsible that these are
passed on correctly to the leaders next to him.
Trumpet and Bugle Sounds.
During field movements each squadron commander is to
be accompanied by a trumpeter. The squadron trumpeters
are, however, to repeat no other sounds than those for the
“ Halt,” except when in column of route or at a distance
from the enemy, when all sounds may be repeated.
Trumpet and bugle sounds are to be used as seldom as
possible except as signals, for which, however, the whistle is
preferable.
The authorised field and regimental calls are contained in
the book of instruction entitled 11 Trumpet and Bugle


Sounds.” Trumpeters, when sounding, must hold the
trumpet turned towards the body of troops for whom the
call is intended, and keep the bell up. All trumpeters
will use the field bugle when sounding field calls.
Bugle calls should be restricted to the following :
“Squadron Column,” “Mass” “Right (or Left) Wheel,”
“Forward", (infantry “’Advance”), “Trot” (infantry “Double”),
“Gallop” (infantry “ Double” repeated), “Halt,” ihe
“ Alert,” and the “ Horse Call.”
The “ Horse Gall ” is the three first bars of “ Watering
Order.”
The formation of squadron columns is indicated by the
sound “ Squadron Column.”
If “ Squadron Column ” is sounded when the regiment is
in line, or in Echelon of squadrons, each squadron will
advance in squadron column from the right; if the regiment
is in column of troops, line of squadron columns will be
formed on both flanks ; if in mass, deploying intervals will
be taken from the squadron of direction.
The sound “ Mass ” indicates the formation of mass on
the directing squadron from whatever formation the
regiment may be in. If preceded by one or two G’s, it
indicates that mass is to be formed to the right or left
respectively.
If “Right (or Left) Wheel ”is sounded when the regiment
is in column of troops, it will refer to the head of the
regiment; if the regiment is in line of squadron columns,
it will refer to the head of each squadron. If sounded once,
it indicates a half wheel of the head (or heads); if sounded
twice, a whole wheel. The initial one or two G’s will not
be repeated.
Signals.
The following signals are to be employed to represent the
words of command mentioned :


(а) “ Advance ” or “ Forward.” —Arm swung from rear
to front, alongside of the horse, finishing with the
hand pointing to the front,
(б) “ Walk ” or “ Quick Time.” —Hand open and raised,
elbow bent, hand in line with the shoulder.
(c) “ Trot ” or 11 Double .”—Clenched hand moved up and
down between the thigh and the shoulder.
( d) “ Gallop.” —Circular movement of the hand below
the shoulder in a vertical plane.
(«) “ Halt.” —Arm raised perpendicularly.
(/) “ Incline.” —Arm extended horizontally and body
turned in the required direction.
(g) ‘ ‘ Right (or Left) Wheel ” or “ Change Direction.” —
Circular movement of extended arm horizontally in
line with the shoulder in the required direction.
Swinging the body round at the same time.
(A) “ Retire ” or “ Sections about.”— Arm circled above
the head.
(i) "Dismount.” —Two or three slight movements of the
open hand below the knee towards the ground.
(. k) "Mount! —Squadron leaders mount when the com-
manding officer mounts. The commanding officer
then makes two or three slight movements of the
open hand (palm uppermost) upwards.
(/) “ For Dismounted Duty, Dismount.” —Arm raised as
for "Halt,” and then pointed to the ground.
(m) " Lie Down.” —The open hand lowered a few times,
from the height of the waist towards the ground.
(n) " Rise.” —The reverse of the “ Lie Down ” signal.
(o) “ Horse Gall.” —Head-dress raised above the head, or
a pocket handkerchief waved. This signal will pre-
cede all other signals which affect the led horses.


{p) “ Extend.” —Extend botli arms horizontally in line
with the shoulders, hands open. Drop them to the
sides. Raise the right or left arm in the direction
to which the men are to extend, and double back
the hand to the shoulder as man)'- times as is neces-
sary to mark the number of paces: If the men are
to extend from the centre raise both arms horizon-
tally in line from the shoulders, and double back
both hands to the shoulder to mark the paces.
(q) “Close.” —Both arms raised as for the “ Extend” and
then brought together in front of the body, as high
as the chest. Right, left, or centre to be first
indicated as in {p).
Any of the above signals made with the head-dress held
in the hand, hut not above the head , will apply to the
enemy.
(?■) “No Enemy in Sight {also a Negative Signal).” —The
rifle or sword held up perpendicularly at the full
extent of the arm.
(s) “ Running Short of Ammunition.” —Two men crossing
weapons.
{t) “Enemy in Sight—ln Small Numbers.” —Sword or
rifle held horizontally over the head.
(u) “ Enemy in Sight—ln Force.” —As in (»•), but
weapon raised and lowered frequently.
The officers using these signals should, as far as possible,
face the same way as those to whom the signals are made.
Signals of position, such as 11 Halt ”or “ Incline ,” should
be maintained. Signals of movement, such as “ Advance ”
or “Incline,” should be repeated until it is clear that they
are understood.
M. S. M. h


In order to prevent the signal I! Incline ” being mistaken
for “ Advance,” it is most important that in the former the
hand should be kept level with the shoulder.
Before giving a signal, commanders above the rank of
troop leader will blow their whistle. Troop leaders, on
hearing their squadron commander’s whistle, will look for
his signals (not for that of the regimental commander or
brigadier) ; squadron commanders in their turn will look
towards the regimental leader.
Sec, 5. Formation of the Troop Mounted.
The troop will form in single rank and will be proved, as
described in Part 1., Sec. 32 et seq.
The troop leader will post his serrefiles, &c., in accordance
with the instructions laid down in Part 111., Sec. 7.
If the men are armed and their rifles at the “advance,”
on the command “ Prove ” they will bring their rifles to
the “Carry,” and on the command “As you, were” will
resume their original position.
If unarmed, or their rifles slung, they will prove by
extending the arm to the front.
Sec, 6. Proving a Squadron.
Vide Plate XX.
The squadron will then be formed in column of troops,
i.e., squadron column.
For posts of leaders and serrefiles, see Sec. 7,
The squadron leader will then prove the squadron as
follows :—■
“ Flanks of Troops — Prove.”
And while they are proving ; —■
“ Centre Guides — Prove.”
“ As you were.”


“ Section Leaders — Prove.”
“As you were.”
“ Flanks of Sections Prove.”
“ As you were.”
“ Tforseholders — Prove.”
“ As you were.”
“ Odd Numbers — Prove''
“As you were.” .
“ Sections — Bight.”
“ Sections — Right.”
“ Sections — About.”
The Squadron Sergeant-Major or Quartermaster-Sergeant,
if not acting as a Troop leader, will be detailed to bold the
horse of the Squadron leader. If neither are available the
trumpeter will perform this duty.

PLATE XXI. Not drawn to scale.
A SQUADRON OF 4 TROOPS IN LINE, EACH TROOP HAVING
4 COMPLETE PERMANENT SECTIONS.


Sec. 7. Posts of Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers
after the Squadron is Formed.
For tactical drills and inspection purposes the squadron
may be drawn up in column of troops, in quarter column
of troops, or in line. When applied to more than one
squadron, the two first-named formations become “ Line
of Squadron Column.”
Squadrons may also be formed for parade purposes, in
line of half-squadron column, No. 2 and No. 4 Troops
forming up on the left of Nos. 1 and 3, at column distance,
“ In Line ” the troops are placed side by side with the
usual interval, and are numbered Ist, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th as
they stand in line at the time.
Squadron leaders, troop leaders, and serrefiles are posted
as follows ; —Squadron leader, if accompanied by a trum-
peter (for parade and inspection) : 3| horses’ lengths in
front of the line of troop leaders, and opposite the centre
of the squadron, but while drilling and manoeuvring his
own squadron he is not restricted to any particular position.
His usual position is 4 horses’ lengths from a flank and
equally distant from the Ist and 4th troops of his squadron.
{Vide Plate XXI.)
When personally guiding his squadron and in regimental
movements in line of squadron columns, he is 2 horses’
lengths in front of the Ist troop of his squadron.
The troop leaders are posted 1 horse s length in front of
the centre of their troops.
Serrefile officers (if any) are 1 horse’s length in rear of
the centre of the squadron.
Non-commissioned officers acting as troop serrefiles are
1 horse’s length in rear of the centre of their troops.
Sergeant Farriers (2) will be 1 horse’s length in rear of
the 'right and left flanks of the squadron, covering their
own half-squadrons.


Squadron leader s trumpeter, if accompanying him, is at
| horse’s interval on his left and the same distance to his
rear. If not accompanying him (as in marching past), he
will be in rear of the second file of the right flank of the
squadron next the Sergeant-Farrier.
In squadron column the troops are placed parallel to each
other, one in rear of the other, at a distance equal to their
frontage (unless in quarter-column or specially ordered
otherwise). The actual distance between troops in single
rank would be at least 1 yard for every mounted man in
the ranks.
When thus placed, a wheel of troops to either hand will
bring the squadron into line.
The troops are numbered from the front as Ist, 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th, as they stand in column at any time.
TROOP DRILL.
Sec, 8. General Remarks.
Each troop must be thoroughly trained under its leader
to take its place in the squadron, both on foot and mounted,
in accordance with the details of drill laid down in Part I.
for the Training of the Soldier on Foot.
The formation of the troop and the manner of proving
has been explained in Part 1., Secs. 32 to 34 inclusive.
The movements by sections should in the first instance
be practised in squads or troops of 12 or 16 men, and
at the walk. When the men execute them correctly at
this pace, they should be practised at the trot and occasion-
ally at the gallop, but sections are not to be wheeled about
at the latter pace.
The drills will afterwards be gone through in troops with
leaders, and finally in squadron with officers and serretiles
complete.


In mounted drill the words “ Wall—March ” will he
substituted for “ Quid I—March 1 —March ” on foot.
Sec. 9. Instruction of Officers, N.G.0., and Section Leaders.
Before any attempt is made to drill their men in the field,
officers, N.C.0., and section leaders must be thoroughly
instructed in their duties, first theoretically in quarters,
then on foot, and finally mounted.
The N.C.O. and section leaders must be accustomed to
set pace, and give the direction in the event of the troop
leader or serrefile being away from his proper place.
Sec. 10. Lace and Direction.
Evenness of pace is of the greatest importance in
manoeuvring large numbers of mounted men.
In line, care must be taken not to diminish the pace,
and in column not to increase it.
In all changes of pace it must be a fixed rule that before
the new pace is taken up 3 horses’ lengths will be passed
over at the pace the body was moving before the change
was ordered. The commander of every unit is responsible
for the correct leading of his command. The direction, if
necessary, will be indicated either by naming an object on
which the directing troop leader is to lead, or by the com-
mander riding in the direction required and ordering the
directing troop leader to follow in his track.
When a change of direction is made, leaders should at
once turn their horses and point in the new direction.
The rate of walk is 4 miles an hour, at which rate 1171-
yards are passed over in 1 minute.
The rate of trot is for cavalry 9 miles an hour as the
general pace of manoeuvre, at which rate 264 yards are
passed over in 1 minute, or J mile in 1 minute 40 seconds.


The normal rate of gallop for cavalry is 15 miles an
hour, at which rate 440 yards mile) are passed' over in
1 minute.
The rate may be increased at the discretion of the officer
leading an attack when under fire.
The pace should be not more than that which the body
can sustain in good order, i.e., the pace of the slowest horse.
In every exercise ground used by mounted troops, a
of a mile, or shorter distance, if necessary, is to be
accurately measured and marked, and the troops are to be
constantly practised in walking, trotting, and galloping
over the distance so marked, at a uniform rate of move-
ment.
Officers and non-commissioned officers are not to be con-
sidered fit to lead troops until they have acquired proficiency
in riding at the regulated rates of manoeuvre over the
measured distance. They should further be accustomed to
estimating distances of several miles; which can afterwards
be verified by the map, or from the length of time required
to traverse them.
The foregoing rates of speed are those laid down for
cavalry, and may be taken, therefore, as the maximum rates
of speed for other mounted troops. It is obvious that for
troops mounted on small horses, or upon animals other than
horses, the rates of speed and paces will vary in each case,
and commanding officers must use their discretion accord-
ingly-
The pace on service should, as a rule, be that of the
weakest horse and of the worst rider. To be a good judge
of pace is one of the essential qualifications of a good leader
of mounted troops.
Sec. 11. Dressing.
The dressing of a troop consists in the perfectly square
position of every horse and rider with regard to the front,


in the preservation of the correct intervals between files,
and in the maintenance of the proper distance from the
troop leader. On the move it consists in riding smoothly
and perfectly square to the front at the pace ordered or led,
in the maintenance of correct intervals between neighbour-
ing files, and in keeping the proper distance from the troop
leader.
The proper interval between files is in all cases to be
taken from the directing point. The men must give to
pressure from that point, but resist it from the flanks.
All dressing will be towards the centre, and should when
possible be done on the move and in rear of an alignment.
No markers for dressing are to be used, nor is any time to
be lost in dressing so long as the general alignment is
correct.
It must be always borne in mind that except with horses
trained in a manege it is almost impossible to correct dres-
sing by “ passaging ” at the halt, or even by “reining back.”
Dressing should, therefore, be done on the move in rear
of and when coming up into an alignment.
It is to be understood that the dressing of troops and
squadrons will invariably be carried out as above described
on all occasions of drill and in the field : but if, on any par-
ticular occasion of parade, an absolutely accurate alignment
is required at the halt, it is allowable to dress the ranks by
a flank.
Sec. 12. The March in Line.
On the command “March ” or the signal of the troop
leader, the whole troop moves off together, at the pace
taken by the troop leader.


The following principles regulate the march in line :
(a) Strict uniformity of pace.
( b) Correct and steady direction.
(c) Riding with correct intervals and distances looking
straight to the front without crowding.
Any change of direction of the troop leader is conformed
to by the centre guide turning his horse the same degree
when he arrives at the point where the troop leader made
the change, and by the men gradually but quickly placing
their horses in the same direction, and keeping the front of
the troop square to the leader’s front.
It is a principle of great importance, for the maintenance
of steadiness and good order in the ranks, that in moving off
from the halt at the trot or gallop, the horses should be
first put in motion at the walk and then gradually but
rapidly urged by the proper aids to the trot and from it to
the gallop, as the case may be; and a similar rapid grada-
tion of pace is to be observed in coming to the halt from
the gallop or trot. In like manner, in passing from the
walk to the gallop, or vice versd, the horses will be made to
break into the trot. About ahorse’s length should be traversed
at each intermediate pace. This principle of progressively
assuming and relinquishing the quicker paces will be
observed in all movements in the field.
Further, in order to preserve the uniformity of movement
which is essential to good order, the trot and gallop must
commence and cease simultaneously throughout a body of
mounted troops.
If, owing to the restiveness of his horse or difficulty of
ground, the troop leader’s pace should at any time be very
irregular, the centre guide will regulate the pace, so as to
ensure the advance of the troop being smooth and uniform.


If, during the advance, any of the men are stopped by an
obstacle, they will, without waiting for orders, drop back
into the serrefile rank until it be passed, when they will at
once resume their places in the ranks at an increased pace.
In diminishing and then increasing the front in order to
pass obstacles, the movements laid down in Part 1., Sec. 38,
should be frequently practised.
If the troop in line, or in squadron column is required to
march over difficult ground, or across open ground exposed
to an enemy’s fire, which cannot be crossed in good order or
safety at close files, the leader should extend his men from
the centre or a named file, at whatever interval circumstances
may render advisable. Thus ; “From the Centre {or a named
File ) Yards Extend.”
On the command “Close,” the files close to the centre,' or
named file.
Sec. 13. Inclining and Wheeling.
Inclining.
For detailed instructions, see Part L, Sec. 25.
Wheeling.
For detail instructions, see Part 1., Sec. 26.
The following are the words of command for the different
degrees of wheel :
“ Quarter right {or left)” (BAG). “ Half right {or left)”
(BAD). “ Bight {or left) Wheel” {HAY). “ Three-
quarters right {or left) about Wheel” {HAY). “Right
{or left) about Wheel ” (BAG).


The degrees of wheel are represented on the following
diagram :
Plate XXJa,
Wheeling on a Fixed Rivol.
All wheels of a troop from the “ Halt ” or at a walk are
made on a fixed pivot except when a column changes
direction.
Wheeling on a Moving Pivot.
Wheels at the trot or gallop, and at all paces when a
column changes direction, are executed on a moving pivot.
The same general principles are to be observed as in
wheels on a fixed pivot.
The troop leader continues, during the wheel, the same
pace that the troop was moving at before the wheel was
ordered.
In the case of bodies smaller than a troop the outer flank
man will direct, and his pace during the wheel should be half
as fast again as that at which the body is marching, and the
original pace will be resumed on completion of the wheel.
With troops in single rank the movement “ Troops, right
about — Wheel ” is unnecessary. If a retirement is required


the word “ Sections—about ” should be given, by which much
time and space is saved.
Sec. 14. Elementary Instruction for Dismounted Service.
Troop leaders will instruct their men in the principles of
dismounted duty, Secs. 19 to 27, preparatory to dismounted
duty with the squadron.
The “ Occupation of a position,” as described in Part 1.,
Sec. 39, and “Skirmishing,” Part 1., Secs. 59 to 69, should
be frequently practised.
THE SQUADRON.
Sec. 15. Posts and Duties of Officers.
Squadron Commander.
The posts and duties of officers, &c., have been already
described, vide Part 111., Sec. 7.
Sec. 16. Orders of formation; their Description and
Use.
The following are the orders of formation of a squadron :
(а) The line for purposes of rushing a position, of exten-
sion or of inspection, vide Plate XXI.
(б) Squadron column or squadron quarter column for
manoeuvre, vide Plate XX.
The (a) line and (b) squadron column have been already
explained. The normal formation for drill and manoeuvre
is squadron column or squadron quarter column. For
purposes of inspection and for the rare cases when an
onslaught “ Mounted” is ordered a half-squadron column
may be formed by the 2nd and 4th Troops moving up on
the left of the Ist and 3rd. The rear half-squadron will
close to troop interval.


Sec. 17. Evolutions.
The following evolutions are to be practised by the
squadron ;
From Line :—
The march in line.
Changes of direction.
Formation of squadron column.
Advance in extended order by a directing unit.
Formation of line of section or half-section columns in
“ bush formation.”
From, Squadron Columns ; —•
The march in squadron columns.
Changes of direction, position, &c.
Formation of line, &c., in any direction.
Advance and retire in extended order by a directing
unit.
Formation of half-section column or “ bush formation.”
From Sections, &c :
Movements by sections, &c., and formations, have been
laid down in Troop Drill, and the movements are per-
formed in squadron in exactly the same manner.
When a squadron moving in sections, &0., has to form
squadron column on the move, the rear of each troop will
be ordered by its commander to increase its pace (rear,
“ trot,” or “ gallop and as soon as the troop is formed it
will be led, in the case of half-sections, &0,, at an increased
pace into its position in the column.
FKOM LINE.
The March in Line.
On the command 11 March,” or the signal of the squad-
ron commander, the whole squadron moves off together,
each troop acting in every respect as laid down for the


advance of a single troop, the general alignment and
cohesion of the squadron being secured by the troop leaders
riding on the same alignment, and at the proper intervals.
The leader of the centre (or right centre) troop is termed
the directing troop leader. He is responsible to the squad-
ron commander for the direction and pace of the squadron.
The other troop leaders, riding at a uniform rate, and look-
ing principally to the front, align themselves on him, and
take their intervals from him or from the next troop leader
towards him.
The squadron commander indicates to the directing
troop leader on what object or in which direction he is to ride.
All troop leaders, while looking principally to the front,
are to be attentive to any indication the squadron com-
mander may make for their guidance. Before making any
such indication, the squadron commander should attract
the attention of troop leaders by whistle.
Obstacles are passed as in the case of a troop, or by
advancing in “ bush formation.”
In advancing in any extended formation, the extension
is made from a named file of the squadron; after the
extension has been obtained, the troop leaders, in front of
the centre of their troops, maintain the alignment, the men
of each troop dressing to the centre of their own troop.
On closing, the troop leaders and men incline inwards towards
the named portion of the squadron.
The squadron should be practised in making long advances
at the trot and gallop in extended order.
Change of Direction, &c.
Any change of direction ordered by the squadron com-
mander is to be carried out gradually by the directing troop


leader, due regard being had to the pace at which the
advanced flank will have to move. The other troop leaders
will conform rapidly, but without sudden check or hurry,
and will be careful to retain their proper intervals.
Squadron Column from Line.
Column to a flank.—“ Troop s, Right Wheel —( March).”
Each troop wheels to the right.
Squadron column to the front.—“ Squadron Column from
the Right {\st Troop, ‘Advance’) — (March).” The right
troop advances, the remainder incline. ( Vide Plate XXII).
Squadron Column to the rear.—The squadron retires in
column of troops from either flank, by first wheeling sections
about to the hand from which the retirement is to be made,
and at once advancing in column of troops.
FROM SQUADRON COLUMN.
The March in Squadron Column,
The march of each body is conducted on the same
principles as the march in line, the leading troop leader

sion on arriving at the point where the leading troop

Change of Position.—The squadron column can change
its position by changing the direction of its head, by wheel-
ing troops into line to either flank, or by inclining. The
incline should only be used for short distances.

Sec. 18. Half Section or “Bush Formation,”
(Plate XXV.)
(For moving through bush or broken country.)
The advance in squadron column by half sections from
Hanks of troops in line has been found a peculiarly valuable
formation for rough, broken, or forest country.
Large numbers of mounted men by this formation can be
manoeuvred with silence, rapidity, and with the least possible
confusion. It admits of the front being rapidly expanded
or contracted, and gives the maximum freedom and flexi-
bility of movement to the various units.
It is found that horses, especially if untrained or badly
broken, are most easily handled in this formation. Bad
riders can more easily conform to the necessary manoeuvres
in this formation than in any other, especially if well led by
the troop leaders.
Great care must be taken to define clearly beforehand
the unit of direction. The regularity and smoothness of the
whole manoeuvre will largely depend upon the leading.
Changes of direction are indicated by signal from the
commander to the leader of the unit of direction, upon
which the remainder conform by the shortest lines.
The following diagram illustrates this formation and
makes further explanation unnecessary.
Squadron column or line can be reformed if necessary by
forming sections and then moving “ Sections — Right (or
Left) ” into squadron column or by increasing the front and
forming as already described.

Sec. 19. Ground Scouts.
Although every man in the squadron is to be instructed
in the duties of ground scouts, a sufficient number of men
must be selected for their superior intelligence and good
horsemanship, and especially trained as the scouts of the
squadron.
The duties of scouts are to ascertain whether the ground
in the immediate vicinity, in front of the squadron (and on
its flanks in column), is suitable for mounted troops, to
point out obstacles and to indicate the best points of passage.
Scouts must be careful not to unnecessarily expose them-
selves to view on high ground, or against the sky line.
Single troops should always throw out scouts in difficult
ground ; a squadron should never manoeuvre over unknown
or broken ground without being preceded by a ground scout.
The number of scouts employed, and the distance to
which they are to go out, must depend upon the nature of
the ground and the rapidity with which the body is moving;
they must not, however, be more numerous than is abso-
lutely necessary, and must be sufficiently in advance to give
ample warning of obstacles, but never out of sight of their
squadrons.
Under ordinary circumstances, one man per squadron is
sufficient, and, as a general rule, ground scouts should not
be less than 200, nor more than 500 yards at the outside
away from their squadrons ; if on a flank, they must know
what sort of ground intervenes between them and the
column.
Squadron commanders are responsible (without any order)
that one scout from each squadron gallops out to a point at
a suitable distance, as explained above, in front of the
centre of his squadron if in line, or line of squadron columns,
or opposite the exposed flank of the squadron ; in the latter


case also, the leading squadron sends out an additional scout
ahead of the column. After reaching this point, each scout
conforms as far as possible to the pace and to any change
of direction of his squadron.
When moving fast over very difficult ground, two scouts
may with advantage be sent out by each squadron ; one
man can then halt to point out a passage, while the other
explores the nature of the ground.
The following signals are to be used by ground scouts :
If the ground is boggy, or otherwise impassable, they will
halt and raise their rifles perpendicularly; they will then
make for whatever point appears practicable, pointing
towards it with the rifle. If the ground within view in
front and on either side is quite impracticable, a scout will
face his squadron, raise his rifle and ride in to the squadron
to report.
As the duties of ground scouts in broken ground take a
good deal out of the horses, squadron commanders will be
careful to equalise the work among their scouts, and to save
all unnecessary galloping; thus, if a line retires over ground
not previously traversed, fresh scouts will be sent out to the
new front, and those already out will rejoin their squadrons.
DISMOUNTED DUTY.
Sec. 20, General Instructions.
It must be the aim of the mounted troops for whom this
Manual is framed to combine the precision, the silence, and
the steadiness on parade, added to the self-reliance and the
individuality which are the characteristics of good infantry,
with the quickness of movement, and the rapid decision in
seizing positions, which are the principal attributes of good
cavalry.


The cases whore mounted troops would be most effectively
employed upon dismounted duty are :
(а) To seize and hold tactical positions, often far in
advance of the slower moving infantry columns, and
to deny their occupation to the enemy.
(б) While holding the enemy in front to turn and out-
flank him upon all occasions, and even by a widely
extended manoeuvre to threaten his rear.
(c) To force a defile, or to seize a bridge, fords, &o.
(d) To offer resistance, during a retreat, sufficient to com-
pel the enemy to deploy, and thus to gain time.
(«) To support cavalry or reconnoitring parties by
covering their retreat through a defile, or by taking
advantage of any other suitable position for bringing
fire to bear unexpectedly on pursuing cavalry.
(/) To form strongly posted pivots or rallying points for
the support of cavalry when attacking, and to hold
in check an enemy’s cavalry and artillery at bridges,
fords, defiles, <feo.
(g) To defend cantonments, camps, bivouacs, and un-
occupied posts.
With reference to ( h) a well directed fire opened upon
the flank or rear of an enemy by even a small body of dis-
mounted men, well placed under cover, has frequently in
war had the effect of turning the enemy out of a strong
posted position.
The utmost care is required in dismounting men where
opposing cavalry could attack them.
Mounted troops should dismount for fire action, if
possible, under cover. Great attention will be paid to
placing the horses under cover, and to thus protecting them
from the enemy’s observation, and from his fire.
The nearer dismounted men are to their horses the better,
as they gain confidence thereby and can then allow the


enemy to approach within easy range, at the same time
retaining the power to mount and move off rapidly.
The Nos. 3 (or horseholders) will be trained in
manoeuvring led horses both in squadron column and in
line formations.
Mounting and dismounting must be carried out expedi-
tiously, and when mounted the men should get away
quickly.
Sections and larger units on fairly level ground where no
immediate cover is available should gallop to the point
where they are to dismount, and, having dismounted, the
No. 3 should be directed by the section leader to take the
led horses under the best available cover.
Sec. 21. Fire Power.
The development of the lire power is of the first impor-
tance ; the value of mounted troops must necessarily be
gauged by their effective use of the firearms with which
they are provided.
Every shot should be effective, and this accuracy of
marksmanship can only be ensured by individual shooting.
It is not advisable that mounted troops acting dismounted
should fire volleys by smaller fire units than troops At
extreme ranges volleys maybe fired by squadrons. (Vide
Firing Exercises, Part 1., C.)
Volleys have undoubtedly a good moral effect, and tend
to steady men in moments of excitement or suspected
danger.
Sec. 22. Fire Discipline.
Fire discipline means strict attention to all orders from
the commander and control of the amount and direction of
fire; it ensures careful adjustment of the sight to the


correct range, and teaches the power of remaining under
fire without replying to it; and above all in the din of
battle, when casualties amongst officers and non-com-
missioned officers remove all superior control, it enables the
mounted soldier acting on foot to continue to deliver his
fire in the best direction with coolness and deliberation.
The physical strength and endurance of the attacking
force are highly tried by the fatigue inseparable from a
long advance under fire, and the assault is consequently
delivered under difficult conditions. These difficulties can
only be counterbalanced by absolute obedience to orders
and strict fire discipline.
Sec. 23. Methods of Carrying out Dismounted Duty.
Dismounted duty may be performed by the following
methods ; —(1) By the whole force dismounting and linking
horses. (2) By three-fourths dismounting and leaving the
Nos. 3 mounted in charge of the horses of each section.
(3) By half dismounting, leaving two men of each group
holding the horses.
Method (1), or linking horses, is applicable when a long
continued dismounted action is contemplated, and when the
horses are required to remain stationary. In the event of
the dismounted men having left their horses at a distance,
and it is not advisable to withdraw them from the firing
line, the Nos. 3 only may be sent back to bring up the
horses, the remainder maintaining their position.
Thus-
“ With Linked \
Horses — I
Prepare to j
Dismount.” J
Troop leaders advance two horses’lengths,
the odd numbers advance one horse’s length.


All dismount. The even numbers bring
their horses up into line, and close in
towards the right; the men then take one
pace to the front, and turn about facing
their horses. The headropes will then be
-j brought over the horse’s head clear of the
reins, without unfastening the coil or knot.
Each man then passes his rope to the man
on his right, who passes it through the
upper ring of his own horse’s head collar,
and ties it two half hitches.
“ Dismount.”
The horses of officers and serrefiles will be linked on the
right.
A section or half-section will be detailed as a horse
guard.
Horses may be further “ringed” into a circle, by
bringing round the flanks and tying them together. A
stampede becomes almost impossible in this position.
Horses may also be linked either singly, by twos, or
by sections without a horse-holder, in cases where linking
gear is issued.
The following Methods are indicated :
Method of Linking Horses with Patent Linker.
The linker will be fastened by one hook to lower ring of
backstrap, the other end to be passed through the ring of
head rope and hooked to same ring.
( a ) “By Sections.” —On the command “By Sections
Link Horses ,” the whole dismount, and facing their horses
with the right hand unfasten the top hook and free it from


the headrope. Nos. 1, 2 and 3 then hook the disengaged
end to lower ring of baekstrap of the horse on their right
and stand clear. No. 4 then brings his horse round and
hooks to No. 1.
If the horses are to be retired under cover, No. 3 will
advance a horse’s length and remain mounted; Nos. 1,2,
and 4 will dismount, No. 1 unfastening the top hook and
hooking to the lower ring of No. 2 ; in like manner No. 2
to No. 4 ; No, 3 will then lead the three horses on the off
side to cover by taking over the Ijridoon rein of No. 4.
(b) “By Half Sections’’ —On the command “By Half
Sections Link Horses,” the men of each half section turn
inwards, each horse’s head being brought up opposite the
saddle of the other horse on the off side ; both men dis-
mount and unfastening the linker hook one end to the off
ring of the bridoon and the other to any D or ring of his
comrade’s saddle which may be available. The horses are
thus facing in opposite directions.
(c) “By Single File.” —On the command “By Single
File Secure Horses,” each man dismounts, unfastens the
linker and hooks one end to the near ring of the bridoon
and the other to any D or ring on his saddle which may be
available.
N.B.—As an alternative to the abo/e the off stirrup may
be brought over as the man dismounts, and the end of
linker hooked to it instead of to aD or ring. In this method
the stirrup should be brought down behind the near wallet.
Method ( h) is that which should be usually practised
and adopted, as it has the advantage over Method (a) of
quickness and mobility. It gives a larger number of
rifles for fire action than does Method (c).


“ For Dis-
mounted Duty
— Dismount.”
The troop leaders advance two horses’
lengths, the odd numbers advance one horse’s
length, and all dismount as rapidly as
possible except the Nos. 3 (the horse
\ holders), the even numbers bring up their
horses in line with the remainder, and the
whole passing the bridoon over (in accord-
ance with the instruction in Part [I., Sec. 5),
hand the rein to the No. 3.
The procedure for dismounting from sections or half-
sections, as per Method (c), is similar to the above.
Method (c) should only be adopted when in column of
route, when it is impossible to form sections, or when
quickness is the all essential factor. Horses can be more
readily led, and be moved at a greater speed in this than in
Method ( b ), and the men can more quickly be got into action.
The led horses should not be in the line of fire in rear of
the dismounted men unless under sufficient cover.
An officer, if available, or the squadron sergeant-major,
will be left in command of the horses of each squadron ; he
will invariably take precaution to guard against surprise,
and he must keep up constant communication with the
fighting line.
If the horses are at all isolated and unsupported, care
must be taken that sufficient guard is left with them.
The officer or non-commissioned officer in charge must
take care that the horses of sections do not get mixed
up together, but that sections are kept distinct, with
horses’ heads towards the fighting line. The men, when dis-
mounted, should form with the utmost rapidity, and in perfect
silence, in front of their horses in their original formation.
The three men composing each section will invariably
keep together, more especially in bush or broken ground •,
no single man ought ever to be surprised by the enemy, and


the men belonging to each section should have a persona!
responsibility that their section comrades are at no time
deserted.
In dense bush the sections ought not to be more than a
few yards apart. In more open ground this interval may
be increased according to the necessities of the case.
In skirmishing, a section of direction and a troop of
direction will invariably be indicated by the commanding
officer, and all should conform to the movements of the
section of direction, so far as circumstances will admit.
In open ground, although the three men of a section
should work together, they need not be necessarily close to
each other, but each man may choose his own piece of cover.
If it should be required to dismount to the flank when in
column of route, the sections should, as a rule, be wheeled
into line to the flank required and men dismounted from
line. The men may be dismounted, however, from column
of sections if necessary.
Sec. 24. To Mount.
When it is desired to mount in order to change the
position, the horses will be ordered up by the order
“ Horses up,” or by signal, or bugle sound, “ Horse Gall —■
Advance.” The firing line will wait the command, bugle-
call or signal “ Stand to your Horses,” or “ Mount,” before
rising, and if firing will keep up the fire. It may be
advisable to mount by alternate troops or squadrons.
If fighting has ceased, the firing line may be marched
back to join the horses, or the horses may be brought up.
Horses are to be brought up at a walk unless otherwise
ordered, and halted close to the dismounted men, and under
cover if possible. If it is required to bring the horses up
quickly the word, signal, or bugle sound “ Trot ” or
“ Gallop ” is given after the horse call or signal.


On the command “ Stand to your Horses” the sections
will run in as rapidly as possible to their horses; each man
will take his horse without noise or talking, and upon the
further word of command, or signal, “ Mount,” the whole
will mount independently and take their places in the ranks.
Nos. 3 will either assist the men of their sections to mount
restive horses, or if not thus required move at once up into
the alignment, to be out of the way of the men mounting.
Men in action are not to mount in moving from one position
to another for short distances.
Sec. 25. Drill and Manoeuvre of Led Horses.
Led horses will be manoeuvred by words of command or
signals similar to those laid down for mounted drill.
Sec. 26. Object of Movement Immediately Intended to
he Explained to the Men.
It is of the utmost importance that on every occasion the
object of the intended movement should be fully and carefully
explained to all the men before they are allowed to go into
action.
It will be usually found possible to halt the squadron
during each period of advance on retreat, and to explain to
them the intentions of the next movement. The few
moments thus lost will be more than repaid by the increased
efficiency gained from intelligent action.
Sec. 27. Mounted Troops versus Cavalry—Square
Formations.
Mounted troops trained to fight on foot, if well handled,
if proper precautions are taken and if correct tactics are
pursued, have little to fear from navalry, unless in a very
open country, and with great inferiority of numbers:
M.S.M, i


officers should lose no opportunity of impressing this fact
upon their men.
They should never allow themselves to be taken by surprise
by cavalry when mounted, so as to give cavalry a chance of
charging them, as thereby they lose the superiority which
their rifle fire gives them.
Under modern conditions cavalry could not attack an un-
broken fighting line except in extended order, and if coolness
and steadiness are displayed such an attack will be readily
repelled.
If an attack is imminent mounted troops should, if time
admits, gallop to cover or enclosed and broken ground, and
thence repel it and retaliate.
If parties of cavalry seriously threaten the horses when
the men are dismounted and extended in fighting line a
portion should be directed to run in, fix swords or bayonets
and form round the horses.
If time does not admit of a retreat to broken ground the
men should be dismounted and a square formed round the
horses.
The following method, illustrated in Plate XXVI., is the
simplest and best for forming a square ; in the case of a
regiment, an echelon of squares should be formed, that flank
being refused from which the attack is made. It may be
advisable to keep one or two squadrons in hand mounted to
be used as opportunity offers.
(a) “ Form Line of Squadron Columns at 3 horses’ lengths
interval.”
(h) “ For Dismounted Duty Dismount and form a Regi-
mental (or a Squadron) Square.”
As soon as the men have dismounted they will at once
run out and form up as in Plate XXVI., so as to cover the
horses, and will be ordered to fix bayonets ; the Nos. 3 at
once close up to one horse’s length from the troops in front.


A space will be left by the dismounted men for the machine
gun in the interval between the companies.
The horses of officers and serrefiles will be placed on the
inner flanks of squadrons.
Line may be formed on any face with the greatest rapidity
by the command, “ Line on Front {Sear, Bight, or Left)
Face — Run,” when the men will form, as directed, by the
shortest line on the flanks of the square named. On the
command, “ Reform Square,” they will run in and form
round the horses as before.
PLATE XXVI.
TO ILLUSTRATE FORMATION OF SQUARE TO RESIST THE MOUNTED
ACTION OF CAVALRY.


Squares are moved as circumstances require, the led
horses conforming.
Well trained men should be able to dismount and form
the above square, and be ready to open fire in 25 to 30
seconds, and mount and move of! in 40 seconds.
Squadron squares are similarly formed, the 2nd troop
making the right face of the square, the 3rd troop the
left, the 4th troop the rear face, and the Ist troop the front
face. In all cases the dismounted men must be kept in
hand by troops and cover the horses.
If time will admit, and it is not an object to move the
square when once formed or to mount and move off rapidly,
the horses may be linked. By turning about the horses of
the Ist and 3rd troop the horses may further be ringed by
half-squadrons, and thereby made secure from a stampede.
One or two men will be required as horse guard.
Sec. 28. Practice necessary in Part I. (A), (E), (F),
and (G).
The troop, squadron, or regiment will practice “ Occupa-
tion of a Position,” Part 1., A, Sec. 39, and “ Skirmishing,”
mounted, as laid down in Part 1., E, Sec. 59, &c. The
principles of the Attack (Part 1., F, Secs. 70 to 76), and the.
Defence (Part 1., G, Secs. 77-81), will be frequently
practised.
THE REGIMENT.
(Plate XXVII )
Sec. 29. Posts and Duties of Officers, and of Regimental
Sergeant-Major.
Commanding Officer and others.
No precise place can be assigned to the commanding
officer, or to the second in command. The former must at


all times avoid keeping too close to his regiment, as in such
a situation he cannot exercise proper supervision over its
movements. His positon generally should be where he can

THE REGIMENT.


best superintend his regiment, make his words of command
heard, and his signals seen by the squadron commanders.
When personally guiding his regiment he will be well
placed if he rides about 30 yards in front of the directing
squadron commander. The second in command will assist
the commanding officer generally. The adjutant rides near
the commanding officer.
The regimental sergeant-major acts as the regimental
marker assisted by a squadron serrefile. When the
regiment is in line or line of squadron columns, he will ride
in rear of the squadron of direction. When in column, on
the outer flank of the leading troop.
Sec. 30. Evolutions.
The following evolutions are given as a guide for the
mounted drill of the regiment. It is to be distinctly under-
stood that they are only to be taken as examples, and do
not furnish an exhaustive list of all the movements a

and 111.
The instructions contained in Sec. 27 are also applicable
to the regiment.
Skirmishing and dismounted duty will be continually
practised on all mounted parades.


Sec. 31. Principles of Field Movements.
The most essential conditions to be observed in held
movements are that every movement, as a whole, should be
as simple and rapid as possible, and that each troop or
squadron should move into its position by the most direct
route available, and in the formation which best admits of
its moving in good order and most rapidly presenting a
front in any direction from which it could be attacked if
the movements were being executed in the presence of an
enemy.
The relative positions of squadrons in line or column, as
also of troops within squadrons, may be changed at any
time. The troops of each squadron must be kept together,
but consistently with this the regiment can be formed in
line or in any other order without regard to the original
positions which squadrons or troops occupied.
The movements required to be executed by individual
squadrons in regimental drill are the same in all respects
as those already learnt in troop and squadron drill.
In all movements of the regiment, one of the squadrons
is designated the squadron of direction, being the one on
which the pace and relative positions of all the other
squadrons depend.
In line and line of squadron columns, the centre or (if
the numbers be even) the right centre squadron is usually
selected as the squadron of direction. The commanding
officer can, however, change the unit of direction at his
discretion.
In all movements in echelon, and in inclining, the flank
squadron on the hand towards which the movement is made
is the squadron of direction, from which all others preserve
their distance and intervals.


In direct echelon and columns of squadrons or troops, the
leading body directs, the other bodies taking their distance
and interval (or covering, as the case may be) from it.
In forming line or line of squadron columns on the move,
the squadron already named directs as soon as it has formed
in line.
In formations in which squadrons are formed first before
being brought up into the new alignment, the leading troop
of each squadron does not take an increased pace until the
squadron is formed.
All field movements, except changes of front, are
described hereafter as made on the move ; regiments should,
however, be occasionally exercised, for instructional pur-
poses, in performing such movements to the halt.
In forming line to the front from column of troops or
squadrons with all the squadrons on one flank, and in
wheeling into line, the squadron leaders should be brought
to the flank on which the formation is to be made before
the latter is ordered ; the flank on which the formation is
to be made is in all these cases to be designated.
In all formations to the front from column on both flanks
of the leading body, the 2nd squadron will invariably form
on the right, the remainder on the left. If it should ever
be required to form with two squadrons on the right, the
caution “ Two Squadrons on the Bight ” will be prefixed to
the command.
In all formations to the front from oblique echelon, the
formation will invariably be made on the leading body of
the echelon; in forming from direct echelon to the halt,
the line may exceptionally be formed on a rear body.
In formations to the halt, all bodies move at the pace at
which the regiment is already moving, or which may be
ordered by the commanding officer, except in those forma-
tions from column of troops in which squadrons are formed


first before being brought up into the new alignment, in
which case the rear troops of each squadron form squadron
at an increased pace.
In formations on the move in which squadrons have to
traverse unequal distances, the base body continues the
pace, and the rest complete the formation at the next
quicker pace ; if, however, the regiment is already moving
at the gallop, the base body will check to the canter until
the formation is completed, the rest continuing the pace,
unless specially ordered to increase it, until aligned on the
base body.
If it be desired, in other than the above movements, to
execute them to the halt, the preliminary caution “ To the
Halt ” must be given, or the halt can be sounded as soon as
the formation is completed.
When movements are executed to the halt, the leader of
the base squadron will cause his squadron to move up a
sufficient distance (when such advance is necessary) to
enable the other squadrons to form, and the base body
advances three horses’ lengths.
In formations to the halt of line of squadron columns,
the base body generally moves up to the depth of the
column. In the above formations the space required for
wheels on a moving pivot must also be taken into consi-
deration.
In successive formations of line to the halt, as a general
rule, each troop or squadron will be halted when it arrives
in line with the serrefile rank of troops already on the
alignment and will dress up; and similarly in the successive
formations of line of squadron columns.
In executing movements for which precise directions are
not given in the following instructions, it is to be under-
stood that, as a general rule, squadrons which are formed


in squadron column will be led into their new positions by
merely directing the head of the squadron.
Echelon Movements, in direct echelon (vide Plate XX VII.,
tig. 4), formed by the march of squadrons direct to the
front or rear in succession at any desired distance, combine
to a great extent the advantages of an advance in line with
greater freedom of movement than is possible in that order,
as line can be rapidly formed to the front, or to either flank.
Direct echelon may also be formed with effect from the
centre of a line, both flanks being refused, and so to resist
attempts to gain the flanks.
Advances in direct echelon should, as a rule, be made
from the flank which is secured or protected, the exposed
flank being refused ; similarly, retirements in echelon should
be made from the threatened flank.
A Link op Squadron Columns or Line of Squadron
Quarter Columns, the Normal Formation for Field
Movements (vide Plate XXVII., fig. 1). —The advantages of
this formation are its mobility and flexibility ; it is more
easily handled on broken ground than a deployed line, each
squadron forming an independent unit, while still preserving
the general alignment ; the squadrons can be better kept
in hand than when in line ; irregularities in one squadron
are not so easily communicated to those on the right and
left; squadrons can readily turn obstacles and obtain such
cover from fire as the ground may afford; they present a
smaller object to artillery fire than when in line, and the
files can be further extended, when under fire or in passing
bad ground, than when the regiment is in line.
Although definite words of command may be laid down,
in the description of field movements, for the wheel of
troops, from line or column into oblique echelon and for
the change of direction of heads of squadrons, the exact
degree of wheel to be executed will in all cases depend upon


the direction in which the squadrons are required to move ;
this should be indicated by the squadron leader by placing
his horse in the new direction by signal or in some similar
manner.
A Regiment in Mass (vide Plate XXVII., fig. 2), on
account of its superior flexibility and compactness, should
always be employed in manoeuvre when circumstances
necessitate the adoption of a compact formation.
A Regiment in Column of Teoops {vide Plate XXIII.,
fig. 3), owing to the long time it takes to form line to the
front, is not adapted for the general purposes of manoeuvre;
it is, however, required for flank movements, the passage of
defiles, and changes of position to a considerable distance,
and is the ordinary march order in the field.
A Regiment in Column op Squadrons is not suitable
for manoeuvre, but is occasionally employed as an inter-
mediate formation, as when a line of squadron columns or
any part of it is required to take ground to a flank by the
wheel of troops.
Retirements are to be executed by the wheel about of
sections.
If, in retiring before an enemy, it be wished to threaten
his advance by constantly showing a front, the movement
should be made by successive squadrons.
A retiring body of mounted troops should never remain
halted with their backs to the original front. If the
command <f Halt ” is given to a body in retirement, sections
must be at once wheeled about before being halted.
When mounted troops are to withdraw to the rear of a
line of infantry, or of mounted troops acting on foot,
they should clear the front as rapidly as possible, retiring if
necessary from both flanks, so as to allow of its opening
fire. It is only in cases of absolute necessity that mounted
troops will pass to the rear through a firing line.


la order to prepare regiments for working with others in
brigade, they should frequently be exercised at regimental
drill in movements such as they would have to perform in
brigade, with the other regiments represented by flag or
skeleton squadrons.
Ground scouts should invariably be thrown out during
some portion of the drill, so as to habituate both officers and
men to the precautions which it is necessary to take on
unknown ground and in the presence of an enemy.
It is not considered necessary to enter into any further
detail as. regards regimental drill. The accompanying
plates will illustrate the principles of the evolutions neces-
sary, which have been sufficiently explained in troop and
squadron drill.

THE BRIGADE.
Sec. 32. Posts and Duties of Officers.
No precise place can be assigned to the brigadier. He
will ride wherever he can best superintend and direct the
movements of his command. When personally guiding his
brigade, he will be well placed if he rides about 30 yards in
advance of the commander of the regiment of direction.
When the brigade is formed for parade, his post in all orders
of formation is ten horses’ lengths in front of the leading
officer or officers, and opposite the centre of the brigade.
His staff officers are two horses’ lengths in rear of him, and
at one horse’s length interval from each other ; gallopers, if
present, one horse’s length in rear of the staff officers, except
when the staff, including gallopers, does not exceed four
officers in number; in this case the staff will form in one
line.
The duties of the brigade major are to assist the brigadier.
Sec. 33. Evolutions.
Brigade movements will be executed on the same prin-
ciples as laid down for the regiment.
In the formation of line, line of squadron columns, or line
of masses from column or echelon, it is a general rule that
regiments will be formed first, and afterwards brought up
into the general alignment.
In movements in which rear bodies «re brought up into
alignment with the leading body, the rule laid down in the
case of the squadron and regiment will be observed, viz., the
second regiment will form on the right of the first; the same
principle will hold good should the brigade be composed of
only two regiments.
When regiments have to move independently, command-
ing officers must name their regiment before giving the
executive word of command.


In all movements in line, line of squadron columns, or
line of masses, a squadron of one of the regiments (which
which will be considered the directing regiment) will be the
brigade squadron of direction, and the nearest squadron of
the other regiment will serve as directing squadron of that
regiment.
In brigade movements, commanding officers must attach
the greatest importance to moving their regiments into the
required position with rapidity, and must not devote their
attention to details of regimental drill.
Officers commanding regiments will only use the bugle
for the purpose of repeating the brigadier’s bugle signal, so
as to show that it has been understood, and will as a rule
give the orders for the movement of their own regiments
either by word of command or by signal.
When the brigadier’s general order is given by signal only,
regimental commanders will repeat the signal, which will be
at once ao ted upon by the squadron commanders. If the
brigade order is conveyed verbally, regimental commanders
will repeat it before giving the words required for the
movements of their respective regiments.
Squadron commanders repeat the regimental words of
command, as in regimental movements, but do not repeat
the general brigade order.
When the order of the brigadier is not distinctly heard,
or is not understood, each regimental commander, when the
intention is obvious, will conform as quickly as possible to
the movement executed by the other regiment or regiments.
The sound “Squadron Column” or “Mass,” indicates
that each regiment will assume that formation.
If repeated, Brigade line of Squadron Columns or Brigade
Mass is required.
The exact movement to be performed by each regiment
in brigade drill must often be decided by the features of the


ground, and much latitude must be given to regimental
commanders in this respect; accordingly, the movements
described in the following sections must be looked upon as
guides rather than as hard and fast forms to be adhered to
under all circumstances.
The following are the orders of formation of a Brigade:—
Line—Line of Squadron Columns (or Quarter Columns)
—Brigade Mass —Line of Masses—Column cf Masses
—Column of Troops.
The same evolutions, &0., as for the regiment will be
practised.
Movements from “ Squadron Columns.”
1. Mass to the Right.
Brigadier’s command :
“ Heads Right Wheel ” followed by “ Mass ” when
column of troops has been formed.
2. Column of Masses to Right.
Each regiment will receive the order “ Right Form
Mass,” the rear regiments then draw up to their
correct distance at an increased pace.

3. Squadron Columns.
(а) With two regiments in brigade, the leading
regiment opens out from its right squadron and
the second regiment forme squadron columns
upon the right of the leading regiment.
(б) With three regiments in brigade, the leading
regiment opens out from its second squadron.
Prom Brigade Mass.
4. Squadron Columns to the Right.
Brigadier’s first command :
“ Columns of Masses to the Bight.”


Officer commanding regiment:—
“ Change direction to the Right ” or “ Right Wheel,”
Brigadier’s second command :
“ Squadron Columns .”
5. Change direction to the right.
When the change is less than a quarter circle the
whole brigade will make a slight change of
direction by wheeling. When the change is a
quarter circle each regiment will change direction
by wheeling independently and move direct to its
position. The outer regiments must advance a
certain distance before changing direction.
Sec. 34. The Mounted Attach.
Although the mounted troops for whom this Manual is
framed are not primarily intended to execute an attack
mounted, there may be exceptional circumstances when they
may be required to rush the position held by the enemy.
It may also be required of them to take advantage of a
sudden opportunity for a rapid onslaught upon the enemy,
when demoralised or in rapid flight.
The mounted attack should be carried out in line of
squadron columns, or in line of half-squadron column, viz.,
the 2nd and 4th troops moved up into line with the Ist and
3rd, as described in Part Y, Sec. 15. This formation gives
two distinct lines, one supporting the other, each separately
commanded.
When about 500 yards from the enemy the command
will invariably be given, “ The Line will Attach.” Upon
this the pace may be slightly increased. When about 100
yards from the marked enemy the command “ Charge ” will
be given.
It is from the uniform velocity of a force that its greatest
effect is to be derived; the pace, therefore, must on no account


be so rapid as to prevent the preservation of distinct and
well-defined ranks, nor should it be so much hurried as to
bring up the horses to the attack blown or even distressed.
In practising the charge, after covering 50 or 70 yards at
the most rapid pace that the troops can bear in good order,
the commands “Trot” and “Walk” will be successively
given ; the pace will thus be gradually decreased, and a
distance of 30 or 40 yards will be allowed before the final
halt. No attempt is ever to be made to halt abruptly in
practising the charge.
In action the shock will of course be followed by a melee
in which the ranks will become broken and the men more
or less dispersed.
On the command “ Close,” the men will at once form with
the utmost rapidity in rear of troop leaders, and form
squadron columns as soon as possible.
Under certain circumstances, when for example the fire
is heavy, it may be advisable to attack in squadron column,
each troop being extended at a given interval, and the men
should accordingly be practised in getting into an extended
formation rapidly and silently, from the centre or a flank
as required. When in extended order a general alignment
must be kept with the centre guide. Long and rapid
advances in this extended formation should be constantly
practised.


PART IV.—MANŒUVRE.
PRELININARY REMARKS.
A careful perusal and study of the Preface to this
Manual is especially recommended when reading Part IV.
It has there been shown that the mounted troops for
whom this volume is drawn up should be capable of all the
duties allotted to cavalry except those associated with the
use of the arme blanche. Mounted Infantry, from the fact of
their shorter training and impromptu organisation should
be confined to the performance of purely infantry services
which the increased means of locomotion provided them,
should enable them to effectively carry out in conjunction
with a mounted force.
Under the changed conditions of modern war, mounted
troops trained to fight on foot have nothing to fear from
the other arms. They possess in themselves that fire
power, and must acquire that training which will enable
them to hold their own in offensive or defensive action with
the best infantry, and in the power of mobility and rapidity
of movement with the best cavalry.
Mounted Troops Acting Independently.
Napoleon laid down the principle ohat the value of troops
in war was in direct ratio to their rapidity of movement.
Mounted troops, therefore, organised and armed, as are
those for whom this Manual is framed, have a value which
it must be the aim of their leaders to utilise to the fullest
possible extent. This can only be effected by great power
of initiative and by the encouragement of independent
action, not only among the subordinate leaders, but also
among the group leaders and men themselves, within such


limits only as may be defined on the spot by the superior
commanders.
It is, however, essential to success that a complete
mutual understanding should exist between the chief and
the subordinate commanders; the latter having the full
confidence of their superior, should possess that self-
reliance begotten of a mutual understanding which goes so
far to ensure success, and which admits of minor details of
command being left to subordinate leaders and to the men
themselves. It will be found that the development of this
mutual understanding will almost obviate words of com-
mand, and movements will be executed and combinations
carried out almost by mutual instinct, and by a common
impulse. The sympathy and the instinct which exist
between the huntsman and his hounds form, perhaps, the
best illustration of what is meant. The squadron leaders
and even the troop leaders, when once committed to inde-
pendent action, should be interfered with as little as
possible, and should be left as much as possible to them-
selves after once the general plan and idea of the superior
commander has been made clear to them.
Mounted Troops and Mounted Infantry acting with
Cavalry.
The duties of mounted troops or of mounted infantry acting
with cavalry in operations of a purely cavalry type, will
be to form points of appui for the wider-reaching, envelop-
ing cavalry movements, rallying points in case of reverse,
and effective protection for the accompanying artillery and
ammunition train. It will be their especial duty to follow
up vigorously any advantage gained by the rapid onslaught
of the cavalry, to make good the points of vantage won,
and to form a solid and powerful reserve of power in case


of a check or temporary reverse. In retreat theii- fire-power
will be of the utmost importance.
It is essential, however, to any real success of a mounted
force of cavalry, mounted troops, mounted infantry, and
artillery, that all the component parts should work together
with a thorough knowledge and appreciation of each other’s
especial power. This can only be ensured by confidence in
the professional knowledge of their leaders, by a true spirit
of comradeship and by a bond of mutual sympathy. It
may be truly said that a force so constituted is capable of
achievements of the highest order.
Mounted Troops and Mounted Infantry Acting with
Infantry.
Mounted troops and mounted infantry working with
infantry will usually be attached to the infantry brigades
upon the same principle as divisional cavalry attached to
an infantry division. It will be their duty to act as scouts
and reconnoitring patrols far in advance of the infantry
battalions, more especially on outpost duty and on advance,
rear, and flank guard service. They will be guided entirely
by the orders given them by their infantry commanders and
by the movements of the troops to whom they are attached.
The Mounted Infantry will usually have this duty allotted
to them.
Practice or Manceuvre.
Manauvre represents the application of drill to the cir-
cumstances of contact with the enemy. A clear distinction
must be drawn between parades for drills and those for
field manoeuvre.
Manoeuvre must always be conducted upon some clear
tactical idea, which must be based on correct principles and
intelligently understood by all engaged in the operation.


It should be an invariable rule, both in peace manoeuvre
and in war, that commanders make known, as far as cir-
cumstances admit, everything that they themselves know
of the movements of the enemy, of the position of their own
troops, of the intentions of the senior officer in command,
and of the special object for which the manoeuvre is under-
taken. It is time well spent, even if it occasions delay
in moving, to show all concerned the ground and to carefully
explain the intention, &c., of the operation. It is by these
means that intelligent co-operation, independence of
action, and initiative among subordinates are fostered and
encouraged.
It must be thoroughly understood that facility in hand-
ling troops, especially mounted troops, can only be acquired
by practice. The art is not to be taught by books, nor does
it come from study, nor is it altogether a natural instinct.
It is given to some to have a greater or a less facility for
acquiring the power of handling troops, but it is practice,
and practice alone, which added to careful study enables
men to successfully lead numbers and masses of men with
the necessary silence and rapidity.
Every opportunity must be utilised to this end, and in
districts or countries where it is difficult, if not impossible,
to concentrate a sufficiently large body of mounted men for
the purpose, much may be done by ha-ing skeleton squad-
rons, regiments, and brigades represented by a few men
with ropes and flags.
Sec. 1. General Observations.
Manoeuvre. —The duties of mounted troops may be con-
sidered under two headings :
I. As those of an independent force of mounted troops
only.


11. As those of a component part of a mixed force of all
arms.
In the case of I. the Mounted Troops constitute a rapidly
moving force organised for independent service in front of
an army; it will be their duty ; primarily to gain information
of the enemy and of the country ; secondly to form a screen
to prevent an enemy gaining similar information of the
movements and numbers ot the army in rear, and thirdly,
to gain an ascendency over an enemy’s mounted troops
similarly employed. These duties will require all the
highest attributes of good mounted troops, those, therefore,
which are the best trained and best mounted, will usually
be selected for this service.
In the case of 11. the mounted troops will be required to
accompany the infantry columns, and acting in conjunction
with them, to perform the reconnoitring, patrolling, and all
other services for which their superior mobility may fit them.
It is probable that the force of mounted troops thus
employed will be largely composed of mounted infantry.
Detached duties. —-The duties described above are termed
the detached duties of mounted troops, and are divided as
follows
A. Information.
(1) Systematic reconnaissance, or the obtaining of
information regarding the opposing troops, and
the country.
(2) Forming an effective screen which shall prevent
an enemy’s mounted troops from penetrating
and gaining information of the movements and
numbers of the army in rear, or from interfer-
ing with its concentration.


B. Protection.
(1) Halted by means of outposts—
(i) With an independent mounted force.
(ii) With a mixed force of all arms.
(2) On the march by means of advance, rear, and
flank guards.
The general principle upon which the formations neces-
sary for the foregoing detached duties are based is that of
an infantry attack consisting of (1) a firing-line of sentries,
Cossack posts, patrols, and advanced bodies, (2) supports,
and (3) a reserve.
If this principle is constantly borne in mind together
with the fact that in the case of the “ firing-line ’’ the duties
are extremely trying to men and horses, it will be found
easy to understand the detailed instructions given hereafter.
It is beyond measure essential to minimise the number of
men allotted to these duties as far as possible. It is not,
moreover, required of them to fight, so much as to observe,
and if necessary hold in check the advance of the enemy
until relieved or reinforced by the main body. The “ firing
line,” therefore, can be reduced to an extent which causes
it to lose in a measure its resemblance to the fighting for-
mation described above, although the system remains the
same.
The system is well illustrated by an outstretched hand
with the fingers extended; the finger tips and nails represent
the sentries, Cossack posts, and patrols ; the middle joints
the picquets, the whole of which comprise the firing line ;
the knuckles represent the supports, and the wrist the
reserve ( vide Diagram).

Special Articles Required. —Every officer should be pro-

in charge of parties should, as far as possible, be similarly
provided :
Map of the ground to be traversed, with the main roads
traced in red and the rivers in blue, and transparent
cover for the map.
Black, red, and blue pencils, and indiarubber.

distance, moreover, in front of the advanced troops of the
mixed force which they may be covering, will similarly
depend on circumstances.
In the event of the bulk of the enemy’s force being
distant from the point of concentration the independent
Mounted Troops may be required to operate many miles
distant, in which case communication must be carefully
maintained by a succession of military or communicating
posts.
The outpost line, <fcc., of the main force must be carefhlly
maintained quite irrespective of the operations of the inde-
pendent mounted force, with which, however, it should be
in constant and uninterrupted communication.
The first duty of a body of Mounted Troops ordered to
reconnoitre is to gain and keep touch with the enemy, to
drive back any opposing cavalry, and approach the main
detachments of the enemy’s infantry, so as to discover their
positions and report their movements. Special tasks may,
in addition, often be assigned to the commander of a recon-
noitring force, such as ;
1. To destroy magazines, railways, telegraphs, and so
hinder enemy’s concentration,
2. To seize special points which may be of use to its own
army, or the loss of which may seriously affect the
enemy’s plans.
3. To cover the mobilisation and subsequent movements
of its own army by keeping the enemy at a distance,
and by protecting railways, telegraphs, &c., from his
raids.
The commander of the Mounted Troops must first receive
instructions of the following nature from headquarters :
(1) News of the enemy’s position and movements,
together with the commander-in-chief’s intentions.
m.s.m. j


(2) The questions which the commander-in-chief desires
to have answered, such as, for instance, whether
certain towns or places are occupied; whether
detachments or masses of the enemy’s troops have
reached a given line ; whether on a given railway or
road troops are being transported, &c.
(3) The daily halting places of the heads of the main
columns and of headquarters.
(4) Means available for transmitting information.
(5) Arrangements as to supplies.
(6) Points to be seized or destroyed.
At the commencement of operations, when the opposing
forces are at a distance of several days’ march from each
other, and uncertainty exists regarding the enemy’s where-
abouts, long distances at a rapid rate will have to be covered
by the reconnoitring bodies.
Officers’ Reconnoitring Patrols and Contact Squadrons. —
Well mounted officers’ patrols, supported by Contact Squad-
rons if opposition is feared, will be therefore pushed rapidly
forward to important points, to touch main roads and rail-
way junctions and places where indications of the enemy
are likely to be found.
Commanders of reconnoitring detachments must take
the necessary steps, without special orders on the subject,
to ensure that their messages shall be rapidly and safely for-
warded. At the same time commanders of larger units
can often greatly assist in this by pushing forward small
detachments to important points on roads for the purpose
of receiving and transmitting messages.
Advance of Main Body with “•Advanced Squadrons.” —
While these reconnoitring detachments advance as rapidly
as possible to their objectives and seek to clear up the
general situation, the mass of the Mounted Force would


move more or less concentrated according to the nature of
its mission.
The nature of the country to be passed through and the
strength and enterprise of the enemy will determine the
dispositions of an advanced Mounted Force ; several roads
running parallel to the advance will enable information to
be rapidly transmitted from front to rear, while a number
of lateral roads facilitates concentration. Considered in
detail, the following dispositions should satisfy the require-
ments :—■
(a) Information must be sought, the enemy discovered,
and contact maintained, by small bodies, to which
great independence must be accorded.
( b) These fractions must be followed up by larger bodies,
so strong and at such a distance that they can
always render them the support necessary to attain
their object.
(a) There must be ability to concentrate the whole force
with rapidity and certainty, so as to prevent the
isolated bodies being beaten in detail, and, there-
fore, too great dispersion must be avoided, and an
effective system of intercommunication must be
organised.
(d) A reserve must be provided, as an ultimate support
and rallying point.
Against civilised troops, and in a cultivated country, the
front that can be covered by a division, without undue
extension, may be taken to be about 12 miles ; but, accord-
ing to the nature of the country, the character of the enemy,
and the necessities of the case, a division may be expected
to cover a front of 18 or 20 miles. While at a distance
from the enemy, the advanced bodies can be pushed further
forward, extended over a wider front, and allowed more


complete independence than when the enemy is within
striking distance; and as soon as the position and direction
of movement of the enemy’s main forces have been clearly
ascertained, the reconnoitring force must contract its front,
so that concentration in any particular direction may be
speedily effected.
The advance of the main body or bodies of the Mounted
Force will naturally be by the principal roads running in
the required direction; while the smaller and more
advanced bodies, although paying particular attention to
the roads on which the enemy’s chief forces may be expected
to move, will scour the whole of the country within the
assigned zone.
if there are two routes, a brigade might move on each
route, each covering its own front with a regiment or more
if necessary, a reserve for the whole being formed by a
regiment from each brigade following in rear on the most
important of the two roads ; but, as a rule, in a country
which is at all practicable for mounted men, the general
disposition of the division will be as follows : —■
One brigade with the horse artillery may be held back in
reserve, following a central route. About 2 miles in front
will march the headquarters of the leading brigade (one
regiment). About the same distance in front, but from 3
to 4 miles on either flank, will march the other regiments
of the brigade. Each of these advanced regiments, keeping
two squadrons in support, will detach two squadrons to the
right and left to a similar distance in front. These are
called “ Advanced Squadrons ,” to distinguish them from all
other detached reconnoitring squadrons, which are termed
“ Contact Squadrons.”
This arrangement takes the form of a screen composed of
several successive lines, increasing in strength and concen-
tration from front to rear upon the principle of the out


stretched hand, and the distances and intervals named
should be such as will enable the division to concentrate in
time to resist any attempt to break through the screen in
force at any point.
Each of the advanced squadrons providing for its
immediate security by a small advanced and rear guard
and flankers is now arranged for systematic reconnaissance
and screening. Patrols are sent out about 2 or 3 miles to
the front and flanks, whilst the remainder of the squadron
moves along a central route. From the patrols small
scouting parties will be detached in order to thoroughly
search the country.
The distance of the advanced squadrons from the support,
and their intervals from each other, will depend upon
the nature of the country, the direction of the roads, and
the proximity and force of the enemy. If the object is
merely to reconnoitre, they will generally be extended as
far as possible, in order that too many men may not be
employed on the service ; but the distance and intervals
should be such that the different bodies may be able to
receive support in case of encounter with hostile forces.
In reconnoitring in open country and on good roads, the
patrols may be pushed as much as 4 or 5 miles in advance
of their squadrons, a distance that can easily be traversed
in an hour, but when they come in contact with the enemy,
they will either fall back, if necessary, for support, still
preserving the touch of the enemy, or the advanced squad-
rons can be brought closer to them, as may seem most
advisable.
If the chief object is to screen the force in rear from the
reconnaissances of the enemy, the intervals should be
smaller, so as to ensure the patrols being able to keep touch
with one another. In this case, the squadrons should not
be more than about 3 miles apart.


If for screening purposes the squadrons are 3 miles apart
and the troops of each squadron are broken up into groups
or patrols, the patrols furnished by each squadron at
intervals of about a quarter of a mile should approximately
cover a front of 3 miles. In most countries it will be
found that a few patrols can effectually do the work required
of them.
One man of a scouting party will ride in to its patrol with
information, and the patrols will similarly send in information
to their squadrons. The squadrons communicate with each
other laterally, either by communicating posts or communi-
cating patrols. Connecting posts will be established
between the supporting squadron and the main body, and,
if necessary, between the advanced squadrons and the
support.
Such special patrols as the commander of the force may
consider necessary will be pushed forward in advance of the
whole. These will, as a rule, receive their orders direct
from the G.O.C.
Each independent body (whether squadron, regiment, or
brigade) must have its own special advance or rear guard.
The greatest attention must be paid to inter-communi-
cation between the several brigades and the whole of the
detachments. Everything that happens, and all informa-
tion gathered, should be quickly communicated to neighbour-
ing bodies of the force. With this view it should be
arranged by the commander that all parts of the force shall
halt every 4 or 5 miles, on a previously determined line,
moving forward simultaneously after each successive halt.
The G.O.C. and brigade commanders, and all leaders of
units will then know at stated intervals of time the exact
position of every part of the force, and advantage can be
taken of this opportunity for feeding, watering, &c.


Each Regiment to have a Section of the Advance. The
commander of the advanced force, in issuing his orders, will
be careful to define the boundaries of the line of advance of
each of the advanced regiments. The commanders of these
regiments in their turn will define the boundaries of the
line their advanced squadrons are to take, whilst the com-
manders of those squadrons will take care that the instruc-
tions given to their patrols are such that there will be no
overlapping. Each patrol will know as far as possible the
line on which his advance has to be made, and the part of
the country it is his duty to search.
Whatever alterations circumstances may require in the
foregoing dispositions, the reserve should always be on or
near the principal route by which the enemy may advance,
and must be as concentrated as possible.
Every commander of a patrol, squadron, or larger recon-
noitring body is responsible that contact with the enemy, once
established, is never abandoned without definite orders to that
effect from a proper authority.
The maintenance of contact may at times draw some of
the squadrons further to the front or to a flank. Complete
independence will thus become necessary, and the task of
the “ Advanced Squadron ” becomes that usually assigned
to a “ Contact Squadron.”
Concentration for Opposition to Enemy. —On gaining
contact with the enemy, partial or complete concentration
will become necessary either to break through the enemy’s
screen or preserve our own.
This matter of concentration is, therefore, a most impor-
tant one, and the possibility of having to resort to it at any
moment after touch with the enemy has been gained must
be constantly kept in view by the leaders of all units
engaged in the reconnaissance.


Although concentration will generally result in a fight,
the opposing force, if weak or badly-trained and deficient
in initiative and resolution, may sometimes resort to passive
expedients such as holding defiles, bridges, or villages with
dismounted men, perhaps assisted by a few guns or machine
guns. In this case, whilst the more vigorous force con-
tinues to press forward its advance, a part of it will have
to be directed in a dismounted attack upon such points
When deciding upon the point of concentration the com-
mander of the independent force will endeavour to bring
superior forces to bear against the enemy at some decisive
point, whilst he makes such dispositions as will prevent
hostile patrols from moving round his flanks unseen. Com-
manders of units must bear in mind that the success of their
leaders’ dispositions will depend in great measure upon how
they carry out his orders and the speed with which they
reach the point of concentration ; and it is only by a close
observation of the country passed through and the knowledge
of it so gained, that they will be enabled to act with effect.
This duty must be regarded as of the highest importance,
and should be constantly practised when troops undergo
instruction in reconnaissance.
During concentration unceasing reconnaissance of the
enemy must be kept up.
Allotment of Troops. —The commander must decide,
according to the general situation and the nature of the roads,
whether the artillery, mounted infantry, and machine guns
attached to the force shall march with the reserve, or whether
any portion of it shall accompany any of the columns.
Reconnaissance and Screening Duties by a Force of Mounted
Troops as a Component Part of a Mixed Force of all Arms.
A force of mounted troops, which may be employed on
reconnoitring and screening duty as a component part of


a mixed force of all arms, will be disposed on the principles
above laid down.
Sec. 3. Principles for the Guidance of Reconnoitring
Parties and of Contact Squadrons.
An intelligent officer, well mounted, and possessing an
eye for country is the most effective means for reconnais-
sance. In order to enable him to draw correct conclusions
he must frequently be trusted with confidential information,
known only at headquarters, of what the enemy is doing and
of his own commander’s intentions.
The strength of the detachment to accompany an officer
depends entirely upon circumstances. Small hostile parties
may have to be forced back, and several messages may
have to be transmitted by orderlies. Officers’ patrols will
thus vary in strength from two to three individuals, or two
officers alone, to perhaps complete squadrons, which can
remain in contact with the enemy for a considerable time.
Reconnoitring is especially the duty of mounted troops,
and the smart and ambitious mounted soldier will see at
once that here is a golden opportunity to distinguish him-
self. It is when detached, with perhaps only two or three
comrades on a duty of this kind requiring dash and daring
combined with coolness and presence of mind, that men
really have the chance to show what they can do, and what
they are worth.
Reconnoitring is a work of observation, not of fighting;
therefore numbers are not necessary for it: they would
indeed be out of place, for a large party could not travel so
far and fast as a small party, and would be more likely to
attract hostile attention. Their object is to see as much
as possible without being seen themselvbs. Consequently
they will rarely move together, but rather spread out, taking
care, however, to keep well in touch with each other. While


careful to avoid showing themselves against the sky line,
they will nevertheless avail themselves of opportunities that
may offer, as they go along, to ascend high points and get a
good view of the country round. Inhabited places will be
avoided as much as possible, except for the purpose of making
necessary enquiries, and under no circumstances will the
whole party enter a house all together. They will remember
that their real work will only begin when they have found
the enemy, and that then is the time, if they want the infor-
mation they carry back to be full, precise, and valuable, to
exercise both daring and prudence, and to be ready to run
almost any risk to attain the end in view.
If they find the enemy in position they must be prepared
to describe the position very exactly, also its extent, the
approaches to the flanks, and how they are guarded, and
whether it is entrenched or not. The strength of the enemy
and the composition of his force must be noted. If they
encounter the enemy on the march, they may fairly estimate
the number of men seen by remembering the rough data
given in Sec, 5.
When approaching any place which may harbour an
enemy the party will act with the greatest caution. Common
sense and circumstances must tell them what to do.
Similar principles will guide them in a defile or any cover.
In these and in all similar circumstances the golden rule is
for the party to be so scattered as to make it impossible
that they should all be surprised or captured in a body,
and yet to remain all through well in touch, supporting and
backing each other up, and working together in perfect trust
and harmony. This means high-class work, and requires
good men and good training to accomplish it. Sections 5
and 6 should be carefully studied in this connection.
The following list of general instructions to be given to
the commander is here added as a guide :


A clear statement of the information required and the
mission upon which he is sent.
The probable movements and intentions of the main body
whilst he is detached from it, and those of other detachments
similarly sent out.
All that is known regarding the enemy which might in
any way assist or influence his action.
Any special instructions regarding prisoners, seizure of
papers, &c.
Nature and frequency of reports, where they are to be
sent, and mode of transmission.
How the detachment is to be rationed and foraged.
Hour of starting and details as to strength, equipment,
&c.
The instructions given to the leader of any reconnoitring
party must not tie him to any procedure, still less to any
particular road, but must state clearly the questions to
which he has to find the answers.
After receiving his instructions the commander of the
reconnoitring party will assemble his officers, N.O. officers
and group leaders, and explain the situation carefully to
them, and so much of his proposed plan of action as it seems
to him desirable they should know.
Requisitioning and Foraging. —-This is as a rule the
principal means by which reconnoitring detachments are
supplied.
Requisitioning must he carried out systematically through
the local authorities, and payment must be made in
accordance with the orders of the campaign. A receipt
must always be given.
A party detailed to carry out a requisition tells off about
a quarter of its strength, under an officer, to guard the
outlets of the town or village As soon as all the approaches
are guarded, the head local authority is sent for and the


place and time for the supplies to be delivered clearly
explained; one or two of the inhabitants are taken, if
necessary, as hostages; sentries are placed over any place
in which supplies are seen to exist; while the remainder of
the party takes up a suitable position in the direction of the
enemy, posting look-out men and sending out patrols. All
individuals who come within the line are to be detained till
the work is finished.
After posting the main body, the commander, accompanied
by a trumpeter, returns to the locality and superintends the
loading of the supplies, which should have been collected in
an open space. If there are no horses, but carts, &c., in the
place, some of the horses of the detachment must be harnessed
to them.
Destruction of Railway and Telegraph Lines. —Neither
railways nor telegraph lines should be damaged without
special orders, and these should al ways specify the nature of
the damage, whether to be partial, or as complete as circum-
stances will permit.
Whenever possible, the work executed should be of such
a nature that it will not be easily detected.
For details how to destroy railway and telegraph lines,
&c., see Part YII.

Officer's Patrols. —Officer’s patrols are usually organised
in conjunction with contact squadrons for reconnaissance
far in advance of the cavalry screen. The principles upon
which they are conducted are given above in Sec. 3.
Reconnoitring Patrols. —The principles given above in Sec.
3 for officer’s patrols are to be adopted. The strength of a
reconnoitring patrol will vary according to the object to be
attained from two or three men to perhaps a troop. As a
rule a section will be found a suitable size on many occasions.
See also Sec. 3 and Secs. 13 and 21.
Patrols are the real eyes and ears of a reconnoitring
force, and it is chiefly upon their zeal, bravery, and intelli-
gence that the successful performance of a reconnaissance
will depend. They must be allowed great freedom of action.
Their first duty is to gain and keep contact with the enemy,
and in their movements everything must be subordinated
to gaming information.
Patrols should be always preceded by scouts.
The actual work to be done by reconnoitring patrols will
always come under one of two headings, viz :
Information of an enemy. Vide Sec. 5.
~ ~ a country. Vide Sec. 6.
Communicating Patrols or Posts.— Patrols or posts of
this description are employed to keep up communication
between detached bodies of mounted troops and the force in
rear which they are covering, or with which they are acting
in concert.
Posts should, as a rule, be about 5 miles apart, and at
easily recognisable spots. If a post is established off the
road a sentry will be posted on the road.
If these posts are not established, communication can
only be kept up by communicating patrols riding across
from one squadron or column to another.


lii either ease the men should be acquainted, as far as
possible, with the routes taken by their own and neighbour
ing squadrons.
Sec. 5. Information of an Enemy.
The following are the principal means by which this is
obtained ;
(a) Traces left by the enemy.
(b) Information obtained by questioning inhabitants,
prisoners, deserters, &c.
(c) Personal observation on seeing the enemy.
Clouds of Dust. —lf the dust cloud is thick and low, it
indicates infantry. A thin and high dust cloud indicates
cavalry. If the cloud is broken, it indicates artillery or
train. The length and movement of the cloud enables the
strength of the force and direction of march to be roughly
estimated.
In such calculations, the effect of wind must be taken
into consideration.
Bivouac Fires. —The position and strength of an enemy
can be estimated from the number and extent of the fires.
If the flames appear and disappear, it is a sign that the
ground is occupied, and that men are moving between the
observer and the fire.
An unusual number of fires may indicate the enemy
means to move, and has lit the extra fires as a ruse.
If there is much smoke at an unusual time, the enemy
may be cooking prior to moving off.
Noises, Tracks, < fc. —Doga barking, horses neighing, an
unusual amount of smoke from chimneys, are signs of the
presence of troops in inhabited localities.
Much may be gleaned from tracks on the road. If the
ground is evenly beaten down, the column consisted of


infantry ; hoof and wheel tracks indicate cavalry and
artillery. If the tracks only occupy half the road, the
column was probably not a large one. If the road is
trodden on both sides, the force was probably one of
considerable strength.
On a calm night, on hard ground, the noise of—
A company marching can be heard at 600 yards.
A squadron or battery, at a walk, can be heard at 800
yards.
A squadron or battery, at a trot, can be heard at 1,200
yards.
A single horseman can be heard at 150 yards.
Deserted Camping Grounds. —The number of fireplaces,
and the length and breadth of the ground occupied, enable
the strength of the force to be estimated. Articles of
equipment, buttons, papers, dead horses, ammunition, <kc.,
found lying about, will show the arm to which the troops
belonged. During a pursuit such traces will often enable
valuable inferences to be drawn as to the nature of the
retreat and the enemy’s condition.
Estimate of Numbers. —A given point is passed in one
minute (no allowance for opening out) ;
By about 250 infantry in fours.
~ 120 cavalry in sections, at a walk, or if in rear
of infantry, about BC.
~ 6 guns, if in rear of infantry.
~ 260 cavalry, in sections at a trot.
If the distance between two points (telegraph poles, mile-
stones, &c.) is known, a simple but sufficiently accurate
method of calculation is to allow two men per yard for
infantry marching in fours ; two men per yard for cavalry
in half-sections ; 1 man per yard for cavalry in sections;
20 yards to a gun or waggon, and 10 yards to a two horse

vehicle. Thus if a column of infantry is a mile long it is
composed of about 3,500 men.
* No allowance for halts.
Scouts, Precautions, <Lx. —No precise rule can be laid
down as to the distance scouts should be detached. This
must depend upon circumstances. Each scout should
understand what he has to look for, and (if detached to a
certain distance) how and at what place he is to make his
report. The patrol leader should clearly indicate these
places of rendezvous, and explain to the scouts, as far as
practicable, how to reach them.
As a rule, these patrols will find that their only chance
of safety at night is to shift their position after dark and
pass the night in a wood, taking care not to be seen when
entering it.
As officers and men of these patrols run a great risk of
falling into the enemy’s hands, they should have no papers
about them containing information regarding the force to
which they belong ; this is especially the case with regard
to any private diary that they may keep. It is desirable,
too, that they should destroy any written instructions when
they have committed them to memory.


Patrols should attract as little attention as possible,
swords, mess-tins, &c., must therefore be prevented from
rattling, and the horses kept on soft ground as far as prac-
ticable. Shining surfaces should be dulled.
Each man, from the start, should do all in his power to
observe the features of the country and impress on his
memory the route traversed, so that he may easily find his
way back, and- be able to act as guide if necessary. To this
end he should frequently look backwards to see how the
ground looks from the front. It may be useful to tnake marks
at cross roads, such as barking a tree or making a heap of
stones, as a guide to the right road.
Patrols should, as a rule, move deliberately, so as to have
time to observe ; but they must endeavour to see without
being seen. They should march and halt as much as
possible under cover, and move rapidly over open ground
exposed to the enemy’s view. They must be very careful
when ascending heights not to expose themselves on the
sky-line. It may often be well for two scouts to approach
the crest together, one of them dismounting and reconnoi-
tring the crest, while the other holds the horses in rear.
The horses must be spared as much as possible, kept off
heavy ground, and fed and watered at every opportunity.
Avoid Fighting. —-It is a general rule that patrols should
never fight if it can be avoided, unless 1 they have orders to
take prisoners. If any enemy’s patrol is seen, it will
generally be best to hide and watch its movements; but
much will depend on the special nature of their duty.
If patrols are cut off, they must on no account allow
themselves to be taken prisoners. A bold attack will often
extricate them from a seemingly hopeless position, and it is
imperative that at least one man should return with the
intelligence gained. With this view it is well that each
man in a patrol, when there is no reason to the contrary,


should know the object of the mission, so that it may be
attained even if the leader is cut off.
Sec 6. Information of a Country
Officers and N.C.O.’s of mounted troops must spare no
pains to acquire the knowledge, and gain the experience
required for successful reconnaissance work. If this duty
is to be performed in the presence of an enemy, the highest
soldierly qualities are necessary.
Officers and responsible non-commissioned officers em-
ployed in this duty must have an “ eye for country,” and
be accustomed to observe ground from a military point of
view, to realise its capabilities in relation to the working of
the troops, and to judge it accordingly. They must be able
to compile, without loss of time, a short practical report,
and to execute in the saddle a rough sketch, to accompany
the report, the object of which must be to illustrate and
make the report clear.
If good reports are to be obtained in the field, officers and
non-commissioned officers must be trained during peace by
careful theoretical instruction and lectures. It is imperative
that a certain number of non-commissioned officers in every
squadron should be so trained that they can be relied on to
discharge satisfactorily the duties of leader of an “ officers’
patrol,” and that all N.C.O.’s and group-leaders should be
able to lead a reconnoitring patrol (vide Sec. 8).
The Men should be trained what and how to observe,
and to he able to state concisely ivhat they see ; they must
also be able to find their way about the. country as
messengers and to repeat verbal messages.
It is recommended that ability as a patrol leader and
reconnoitrer should be considered as one of the most
necessary qualifications for a non-commissioned officer to
possess before promotion to the rank of sergeant.


Sec. 7. Rules for Framing Reports.
(a) Reports to the same person should be numbered con-
secutively, and place (stating the number of picquet or post),
date, hour, minute, and signature of sender given.
(f>) They must be written legibly with names of places
and people printed, in block letters.
(c) Source of information and grounds for reliability
stated, and vague terms avoided.
(d) Points of the compass should be used in defining
direction, otherwise “our” or the “ enemy's" “right,”
“left,” “front,” or “rear” should be stated. When
describing rivers, the terms “right,” or “left,” bank should
be used (right bank of river is that bank which is on the
right when looking towards mouth of river).
(e) The information in a report should be given upon the
following principles : lst, make the report as short as if
it were a telegram ; 2nd, it as full of information
as if for an unintelligent man who has never seen the
object reported on.
The body of the report will begin thus ;
Place ( Cross roads 2 miles N. of Primley Green.
and Date. ) 9.45 A.M., August 22nd, 1901.
The whole value of a report often turns upon the accuracy
of place and time being clearly and correctly stated in
accordance with the map issued to the troops. It is better,
therefore, to give this information in the body and at the
commencement of the report, than as a postscript.
In making a report the writer.should imagine himself in
the position of the officer who has to read and act upon it.
Common sense will then indicate what to say and how best
to say it. Bear in mind that reports, even very important
ones, are often hastily read by those receiving them, and


under circumstances when clearness and conciseness of
expression are all-important.
The following are some hints as to what to observe ;
Bivouac. —Place for bivouac should be near road, well
hidden, with good approaches. Vide Part YL, Sec. 2.
Bridge. —State material, length, breadth, width of road-
way, height, parapet, number of arches, nature and thickness
of piers, repairing materials, approaches at both ends.
Building. —State condition, situation, height, size, mate-
rial, roof, enclosures.
Camping Grounds. —When tents are issued a regiment of
infantry requires in round numbers a space of about 250
yards front by 400 yards depth to encamp comfortably. A
mounted regiment takes about the same, a battery of artil-
lery rather less. All can manage with much less, if pushed
for space. The rule is to take all the room available,
when space is no object, for sanitary reasons. In reporting
a site for a camping ground or bivouac, military considera-
tions will outweigh all others if an enemy is in the neigh-
bourhood. Thus, it must not be commanded by any ground
within range, or be located in any position liable to surprise;
it should have easy approaches and good communications
throughout; water, fuel, and supplies should be within easy
reach.
Sanitary Considerations are soil and drainage; newly
ploughed land should be avoided ; also low-lying and swampy
country and the sites of old encampments; sand and gravel
are good.
Country. —State whether open, closed, or wooded, flat,
undulating or hilly, cultivation, swampy, &c. If enclosed
state nature of fences.


Enemy. —State number, arm, what doing, whereabouts.
Vide Sec. 5.
Ferry. Ford. - State width, depth, bottom, banks,
approaches, boats. Never accept statements about fords
without personally testing them. Safe depths are 3 feet
for infantry, 4 feet for mounted troops, 2 feet 4 inches for
field artillery or transport waggon.
Lake or Waterhole. —State width and length, depth, boats.
Look-Out. —Note look-out places, good signalling stations,
&c.
Hills or Mountains. —-State height, steepness, surfaces.
Positions Jor Defence. —Open ground to front, cover for
defender’s line of retreat.
Railway. —State single or double track, embanked or
sunk, rolling-stock, engines, carriages, cattle trucks, &c.,
carrying capacity, sleepers, &c., tunnels, bridges, character
of country traversed, drivers, guards, and other railway
officials available.
River or Creek. —-State width, depth, bottom, banks,
velocity of current, bridges, boats, navigable or not.
Character of banks which command the other, whether
they are open, or wooded, or marshy. The existence of
islands in a river ; these often facilitate bridging operations,
and help to conceal preparations.
N.B. —To ascertain the rate of the current, throw a branch
into mid-stream, and see how far it floats in a minute. Two
miles an hour is a “ swift current
Road. —State whether metalled, fenced, condition, width,
surrounding country, means of repairing or improving,
gradient, character of country passed through, open, wooded,
cultivated, &c., places on or near the road suitable for
encampments, supplies obtainable en route , &c.


Railway Stations. —State length, breadth, shape, and
number of platforms, coal, water, rolling-stock, stores,
telegraphs, facilities for detraining and entraining troops,
horses, guns, &c ; suitability for defence.
Supplies. —State amount of food, forage, cattle, crops,
ovens, carts and horses.
Telegraph. —State number of wires, height and material
of posts.
Town or Village. —State size, situation, defensibility,
large buildings, supplies.
Water. State quality, how obtained, how much in dry
weather, size of and accesfj.to watering-places.
Woods, Bush, or Scrub Country. —-State size, density,
undergrowth, height of trees, roads through.
Sec. 8. Sketches.
The perfection of modern maps of civilised countries has
to some extent diminished the necessity for field sketches.
At the same time cases will often occur in which a sketch,
as the result of a reconnaissance or as an illustration to a
report, must supplement the map. Moreover, in reporting
upon a position, certain details which would be difficult to
describe in writing can be readily shown on a sketch.
It is also frequently necessary to supplement the military
maps issued of country little known, and to verify or revise
the details.
Every officer, every N.C.0., and every group leader,
before he can be considered fit to be detached from his
squadron on ordinary patrol duty, should be able :
(1) To understand the conventional signs, vide Plate
XXXVI.
(2) Measure distances on a map by scale.
(3) Read a military map, and orient it by compass and
by the sun.




(4) Write out by reference to a map clear directions
sufficient to enable a man to find his way from one
place to another.
(5) To identify villages, farms, hills, &c., shown on a
map.
(6) To find his way from one place to another in an un-
known part of the country by means of a map only.
(7) Make an intelligible written report on any given
length of road to be traversed on horseback.
B. PROTECTION.
(1).—PROTECTION OF TROOPS WHEN HALTED.
OUTPOSTS.
Sec. 9. General Observations.
The system of protection for troops halted is called
“ Outposts ” :
Outposts do for an army halted in camp or in bivouac
what advanced, rear, and flank guards do for it when it is
on the march.
The principles and the tactics are in each case identical.
Outposts, like advanced and rear guards, are intended to
prevent surprise, and watch the enemy's movements, while
screening their own, and give time to deploy for fighting
when fighting is intended. If an army is going to fight
well it must rest well; and rest can only be obtained for it
by guaranteeing it perfect security when halted for the
night.
A knowledge of outpost duty is of the greatest impor-
tance to mounted troops. The duties on outpost service
are the most arduous which devolve on mounted soldiers in


the field, and their importance cannot be exaggerated. As
a rule infantry take outpost duty during the night, mounted
troops during the day ; occasionally, however, the latter
have to perform the duty day and night.
Frederick the Great said “It was pardonable to be
defeated, but never to be surprised.”
The outpost system has been compared in Sec. 1 to the
hand with the fingers extended ; the nails and points of
the fingers being the Vedettes , Cossack posts and patrols;
the middle joints, the picquets; tho knuckles, the supports;
and the wrist, the Reserve and Gamp (vide Diagram
XXXV).
Outposts for mounted troops should be considered from
two points of view :
(1) When acting as an independent mounted force in
front of, or distant from the main column.
(2) When acting as a portion of a mixed force of all
arms taking part in one and the same military operation.
(1) When Aoting as an Independent Mounted
Force.
Sec. 10. Selection of the Outpost Line.
Every commander of a body of troops halted in the field
must:—
1. Protect himself against surprise.
2. Take such precautions that his men and animals may
rest undisturbed.
3. Make sure of having plenty of time, in case he is
attacked, to occupy a good defensive position.
The outposts are the means by which he fulfils these
requirements.
If the enemy is so continuously watched that he can
make no movement without being observed, surprise is


manifestly impossible. The first duty, therefore, of the
outposts is RECONNAISSANCE.
In order that the main body may rest undisturbed, all
partial attacks must be warded off, and the enemy’s troops,
especially his artillery, must be prevented from approaching
within range of the camp or bivouac. The second duty,
therefore, is resistance.
A commander, consequently, in selecting his outpost line
must decide (1) upon his “ Line of Resistance ,” and (2)
upon his “ Line of Observation.”
It may sometimes happen that one position will have to
answer the requirements of both.
The general front should if possible run along some well-
defined natural feature, as a commanding ridge, edge of a
bush, or the line of a river, thus obtaining a position for
resistance , and an extended vieio for observation.
This position, while the main body rests, will be secured
by the outposts.
It is not enough, however, to deny this position to the
enemy. It might have a most disastrous effect if the main
body were shelled or fired on while forming up in camp, or
while in the act of occupying a position. It is essential,
therefore, that the outposts should be pushed so far to the
front as to prevent the enemy’s guns from approaching
within effective range, not only out of Jie camp or bivouac,
but if possible of the defensive position ; and, also, that they
should be of sufficient strength to prevent his advance until
that position is occupied by the main body.
Thus, as a general rule, it may be laid down that the out-
post line, in undulating country, should be within effective
rifle range of all ground from which the enemy’s artillery
might shell either the position or the camp ; and on a bare
plain, at least two miles in front of the position.


Sec. 11. General Rules.
1. The greatest latitude should be allowed to all officers
on outpost duty, so long as their arrangements are calcu-
lated to ensure long warning of attack, a stout resistance,
and close co-operation between all portions of the outpost
line.
2. To see without being seen is the first maxim of out-
post duty as it is of scouting. The more the enemy is kept
in ignorance of the strength and position of the outpost
troops the greater will be his uncertainty ; and uncertainty
is a most fruitful cause of mistakes and rashness.
The rare occasion when outpost troops may show them-
selves is when it is desirable to deceive the enemy, and to
induce him to exaggerate the numbers and confidence of
the force opposed to him.
3. The dangerous hours for the outposts are just before
dawn and just before sunset. An enemy will often attack
late in the day in order to possess himself of advantageous
ground, and secure himself there by entrenching during
the night; and he will still more often bring up his troops
under cover of darkness, and endeavour to rush the outpost
line as soon as it is light.
4. The outposts will, therefore, stand to arms half an
hour before, dawn, and remain under arms until the patrols
report to the commander of the outposts that there is no
sign of an immediate attack.
Moreover, the relief of the outposts will fall in half an
hour before dawn and march at once to the outpost line.
The troops relieved will not return to camp until the
patrols report all clear.
5. All troops in the front line of the outposts will
strengthen their posts, clear the line of retreat, and, when
ordered to do so, barricade roads, tracks, bridges, and erect
sangars,


6. The degree of readiness to be maintained will depend
on the vicinity of the enemy and the character of the
country. The units furthest from the enemy need not
always maintain the same condition of readiness as those to
the front.
7. Officers should retain all written, and write down all
verbal, orders received, and hand them over with a note of
any useful information obtained, to the officers relieving
them,
8. All information must be sent at once to the officer
commanding the outposts.
9. The strength and composition of the outposts depend
so entirely on circumstances, such as the strength, character,
and whereabouts of the enemy, the distance of the camp
from the defensive position, the nature of the country, that
the only useful guides are experience and common sense.
Three rules only can be laid down as regards strength :
(1) Outpost duty is most exhausting ; so not a man
nor horse more than is absolutely needed should
be employed. If more than one-sixth of the force
is employed, the efficiency of the troops will
suffer.
(2) The movements of troops are generally confined to
the roads; in civilised warfare, therefore, except
in very open country, it is generally sufficient to
hold the roads by which the enemy may approach
in strength, and to occupy intervening country
with an occasional Cossack post or by patrolling.
(3) The outposts must be strong enough to delay the
enemy’s attack until the main body has had time
to occupy the defensive position.
10. Troops on outpost pay no compliments.


11. No field-call is to be sounded by troops on outpost
except, in case of emergency, the “ Alert.”
12. Outpost duties must be practically as well as theo-
retically taught. Whenever troops are being exercised in
outpost duties a portion should be told off to represent an
enemy. Unless this is done the exercise is likely to be
carried out in a perfunctory manner, the men will acquire
careless habits, and opportunities of cultivating their intelli-
gence and powers of observations will be lost. Instructions
should be given to patrols distinctly and clearly in the
presence of their comrades, and on completion of this
duty their mistakes should be pointed out to them, so that
all may profit by their instruction.
Sec. 12. The Subdivision of the Outposts.
Mounted troops employed on outpost duty are divided
into three portions, viz.:—
I.—Picquets, including sentries, Cossack posts, and
patrols.
ll.—Supports.
lll.—Reserve.
I. The picquets usually form the line of observation and
furnish the Cossack posts, reconnoitring patrols, visiting
patrols, and their several reliefs.
11. —The supports usually form the line oj resistance , and
should as a rule be equal in strength to the picquets, and
will furnish examining posts and detached posts when
required. One support should as a rule be told off to every
two picquets. Officers’ patrols especially detailed should
be furnished from the support.
A complete squadron of four troops would thus furnish
two picquets each of one troop and one support of two
troops.


111. The reserve in the case of comparatively small
forces is often the main body itself, but with large bodies
a special reserve should be told off.
Sec. 12. Definition of Terms used on Outpost Duty.
A Cossack Post. —A single sentry or vedette and his
relief, i.e., 3 men (1 on sentry, 2 in relief), under a non-
commissioned officer or section leader.
A Picquet. —A body of men generally a troop of 5 or 6
permanent sections, formed of the non-commissioned
officers and men not required for the Cossack posts. It
furnishes a dismounted “ look-out sentry ” who will watch
the line of Cossack posts, and report signals to the officer
commanding the picquet; also connecting sentries, if
necessary.
Supports and Reserves. —Stronger bodies in rear of
line of Cossack posts and picquets to assist them to resist
attack.
A Standing Patrol. —Consists of a small party sent
beyond the outposts usually by night, which conceals itself
near a probable line of approach to give warning of an
enemy’s advance.
A Reconnoitring Patrol. —Consists of a section under
its section leader, or a small body ruder an officer, which is
sent beyond the line of Cossack posts, to patrol in the
direction of the enemy, and reconnoitre the ground, and
gain information of the enemy.
A Visiting Patrol. —Consists of an officer or a non-com-
missioned officer and 1 man sent to visit the line of Cossack
posts, and to see if all is correct.
An Examining Post. —ls a section or larger body with a
responsible non commissioned officer or officer, posted on the


main approach to examine all persons approaching the line
of outposts.
A Detached Post. — Consists of 1 or 2 sections under a
non-commissioned officer, generally placed on the flank of
the line of outposts to protect the flank, or to hold any
point of especial tactical importance.
N. B.—Picquets are numbered from the right, and
Cossack posts from the right of respective picquets.
Sec. 14. Duties oj the Commander of the Outposts.
All troops on outpost duty are under his orders, and he
is responsible for the security and repose of the main
body.
His usual position will be with the reserve, or if there is
no reserve, with the supports of the centre outpost squad-
ron.
When, by reconnaissance, or by the aid of the map, he
has made himself acquainted with the ground the outposts
are to occupy, he issues orders on the following points;—■
1. Information of the enemy.
2. Position of the camp of bivouac.
3. Position to be occupied by the main body in case of
battle.
4. General line to be occupied by the outposts, stating
generally the “ line of observation ” and “ line of
resistance”; define section of front or number of
roads allotted to each outpost squadron, and post
or posts of the reserve.
5. Disposition of “standing patrols” if required.
6. Dispositions (if necessary) in case of attack; for
instance, whether the outpost squadrons are to fall
back on the reserve, or whether the reserve is to
reinforce the outpost squadrons.


7. Preparations for defence; barricades; and construc-
tion and improvement of lateral and other com-
munication.
8. Special arrangements by night (if any).
9. Smoking or lighting fires.
10. Position of examining posts.
11. Signalling.
12. The hour at which the outposts will be relieved.
13. His own position.
If necessary, he will direct patrols to be sent out by the
supports and reserve, detailing their strength and the hour
at which they will march.
Sec. 15. Duties of the Officer Commanding a Squadron on
Outpost Duty.
First, he will carefully examine the country over which
the squadron advances to take up its position, noting
the favourable localities for disputing the ground if
he has to retreat.
Second, make arrangements for a protracted resistance
by selecting a good defensive line which, if possible,
shall support and be supported by the line occupied
by the squadrons on either hand ; by strengthening
it artificially; and by deciding how to post his men
in case of attack.
Third, carefully examine the country to the front of his
defensive position, and anticipate the points from
which he will probably be attacked, selecting points
for “ standing patrols ” if necessary.
Fourth, utilise all facilities for observation.
Fifth, make arrangements tor constant patrolling.
On taking over the section of the line the squadron is to
occupy, the commander will send out parties of skirmishers
to cover him while he posts his picquets, Cossack posts, and


detached posts, to examine the country to the front and to
learn the direction of the roads, tracks, and streams. He
should also send small patrols to communicate with the
squadrons on the flanks, and to learn the road to them.
These parties of skirmishers should be composed of the
men who will be the first to be employed upon patrol.
He will give his instructions to the commanders of pic-
quets and detached posts in accordance with the orders be
has himself received. He will then decide on the position
of the support, which he will himself command.
He will be particularly careful to ensure that the country
to the front, unless it is very open, is constantly patrolled,
that the commanders of picquets and detached posts
thoroughly understand what his intentions are in case of
attack, and that they make adequate preparations for
defence. He will ensure that there are available men to
act as orderlies for conveyance of information to the reserve
and troops in rear.
He will visit his picquets and detached posts at frequent
and uncertain intervals.
He will see that all fires, if permitted by the commander
of the outposts, are carefully concealed from the view of the
enemy.
He will make arrangements for the issue of rations and
forage, if necessary for cooking (which may be done by the
supports), and for the supply of water.
As soon as he has made his disposition, he will send in a
report, accompanied by a rough sketch, to the commander
of the outposts.
Sec. 16. Distribution of a Squadron on Outpost Duty.
It has been shown in Sec. 12 that the squadron would be
usually divided into two or three portions, viz.;—One or
two picquets, and a support.
M.S.M. h


If necessary one or more detached posts and an examin-
ing post would be furnished by the support.

regards the position of the enemy and the situation generally
before moving off. He will also indicate his own position.

PICQUETS.
Sec. 17. General Rules.
1. Primary duty to see and hear without being seen and
without being heard.
2. Pay no compliments, but officer commanding reports
himself to any superior visiting the picquet.
3. Eating, feeding, and watering to be carried out one-
third at a time; at night all must be alert, especially an
hour before dawn.
4. The girths and saddles of one-third to be loosened hy
day, when all seems quiet, but never at night.
5. No man to leave the picquet except to fetch water,
forage, &c. Those off duty to rest and sleep during the day
as much as possible, but never to take off arms, ammunition
pouches, or belts.
6. No fires allowed except in concealed places, and then
only if permitted.
7. No noises or trumpet sounds allowed, and all orders
given in a low voice.
8. No one permitted to approach except on duty.
9. In the presence of the enemy, his general position and
that of his outposts should be known to every man of the
picquet, also the position of the support and picquet on each
flank.
Sec. 18. Duties of Officer detailed for Picquet Duty.
First.—lnspect his command, especially the arms, ammu-
nition, saddlery, shoeing, spare shoes, rations, and forage.
Second. —Note in pocket book main points of instructions,
see that maps are distributed (if available), roughly copied
or inspected by, and explained to the officers and non-
commissioned officers.


Third. — Marches off his party preceded by advanced and
flanking patrols, all of whom should on the way observe the
nature of the country passed.
Fourth. —Upon arrival at his approximate position he
halts under cover, sends some skirmishers and one or two
small patrols, in the direction of the enemy (unless this has
been already done by the Squadron Commander), to watch
front and flanks until the Cossack posts are posted, and
directs visiting patrols to communicate with neighbouring
posts. Th e position for the picquet should be from 300 to
600 yards in rear of the centre of its line of Cossack posts,
close to a main line of approach—preferably a junction of
routes leading to the front—with clear ground for action to
the front and flanks and free communication with the
neighbouring picquets and supports, and concealed from the
view of the enemy. Ground should be level and firm so as
to give rest to the horses ; in rear of a bridge or defile ; in
rear of a township, avoiding any enclosed places difficult to
extricate itself from in case of attack, or in the outside
buildings or enclosures as the case may be, leaving always
a line of retreat open.
Fifth. —Having carefully examined the ground to beheld
by his picquet and reconnoitred the front with his glasses he
will select the position for his picquet, and decide as to the
number of Cossack posts, standing patrols, &c., required.
He should then tell off his picquet, the Cossack posts being
told off by groups,
Picquets, if practicable, should always occupy defensible
positions; and these positions, in order to preclude the
possibility of their being carried by a sudden rush, should
be made as strong as means permit.
A picquet must not take post in a house or an enclosure
unless ordered or permitted to do so by the commander of


the outposts • or unless circumstances render sucli a measure
necessary in order to enable the outposts to maintain their
ground, and to secure the main body from sudden attack.
Sixth. —lt is desirable that the line of Cossack posts
should run along well defined features, such as a ridge
of high land, banks of a river, far edge of a wood, &c., and
that the flanks should rest on other troops or natural
obstacles not easily passed unobserved, such as a swamp,
creek, waterhole, or river, but never on the edge of a dense
bush. In the last case a detached post should be placed in
the bush with special orders for patrolling.
Seventh.—Rules for posting Cossack posts. —The front of
a picquet depends entirely on circumstances ; it may be 1
mile or as much as 4or 5 miles. Under ordinary circum-
stances the front will usually be 1 mile assigned to a
picquet; the smallest number of Cossack posts, ike.,
absolutely necessary will be posted, which may vary accord-
ing to the configuration of the country, but generally
speaking two to a mile. The sentry of a Cossack post should
as a rule be dismounted at the discretion of the picquet
commander. The group leader and the relief of each
Cossack post will always dismount, but be prepared to
stand to their horses ready for any emergency ; they should
be concealed as much as possible. The sentry should have
a clear view to the front, see posts on right and left, or at
any rate the ground between, so that no one could pass
unobserved ; flank Cossack posts must be in sight of those
of the neighbouring picquet, and flank Cossack posts of the
line will usually be thrown back, and it not protected by
an impassable natural obstacle will generally be supported
by a detached post. The sentries should always be
posted beyond the edge of a small wood or small village.
At night they must depend chiefly on the sense of hearing,


and should be posted on low ground to get advantage of the
sky line and on or close to approaches, but not near running
water, trees, &c.
Eighth. —When all are in position the officer commanding
the picquet will inspect the line, accompanied by the non-
commissioned officer who superintends the relief of Cossack
posts (usually the troop sergeant), making any necessary
alterations in their disposition ; see that all approaches by
which an enemy could approach are observed, advantage
being taken of any high points, buildings, trees, &c., and
explain as follows to the section leaders in charge of each
Cossack post, and see that each sentry understands, viz. : —■
(1) Direction of enemy and what is known of his position
and movements.
(2) Extent of front each sentry is specially to watch, and
any points requiringspecial observation.
(3) The number of the post and number and position of
the posts on each side.
(4) The number and position of the picquet and the way
to it.
(5) The position of the nearest examining post.
(6) The name of the officer commanding outposts.
(7) Names of any townships, hills, rivers or defiles in
sight, and where the railways and roads lead to.
(8) The countersign.
N, B.—The non-commissioned officer or troop sergeant
detailed to superintend the reliefs must listen attentively
to these instructions, making notes if necessary for the
information of the sentries when posting reliefs.
(9) He will then ivithdraw the original skirmishers and
return to picquet, alter its position if necessary—informing,
if he does, Cossack posts and neighbouring picquets—
dismount picquet, post look out sentry , arrange for

patrolling, indenting on support for more men if necessary;
choose night position for the picquet (if required fur night
duty) and prepare a scheme of defence, also report and
furnish a sketch of his position for the information of officer
commanding outposts.
The following procedure is given as a guide for instruc-
tional purposes only ;
Sec. 19. Duties of Cossack Posts.
A Cossack post is usually a permanent section detached
under its section leader to occupy a position.
The rifle fire from three men well posted, having, when
forced to retire, the means of a rapid retreat at hand, con-
stitutes a very formidable defence, especially with smokeless
powder when their exact position cannot be recognised.
In case of an attack No. 3 should be mounted and have the
horses of his comrades near at hand, and ready but under
cover until required.
The section leader is responsible for the proper carrying
out of the duties of his post.
Cossack posts and their sentries, unlike infantry, have
their own means of safety at hand in the speed of their
horses; consequently they can be posted at greater
distances from the picquet and in more unsupported


positions and are able to hold their ground, and withstand
an attack from even a considerable body of the enemy.
It will generally be found that two or three Cossack
posts will be sufficient for each picquet to furnish, and that
these posts can be selected with more regard to their
advantages as look-out stations and less regard for the inter-
communication than in the case of infantry.
The men of a Cossack post not on sentry duty should be
prepared to reconnoitre to the front, and to occasionally
patrol to the flanks and communicate with the neighbouring
posts. Their duty is “to see and not be seen.” They
will not slacken girths until permitted to do so.
If the line of Cossack posts cannot be seen from the
picquet, a connecting link must be thrown out from the
picquet.
Orders for Sentries furnished from Cossack Posts.
1. Keep out of sight of enemy, and have rifles with
magazine charged.
2. Make no noise or unnecessary movement.
3. Allow no one unauthorised to pass or loiter near.
He must not allow more than one stranger at a time to
approach his post. If any person, not on duty or unpro-
vided with a pass, does approach, he will direct him to the
examining post, if there is one ; if the'-e is not, or if it is
too distant, he will call the section-leader, who should
detain him till the arrival of the visiting patrol or send him
to the picquet under escort. Any person who disobeys is
to be shot.
4. If the enemy is seen to be approaching, and there is
time to warn the picquet by signalling or sending a message,
this should be done in preference to firing.
5. Watch the ground from to as far as
the Cossack posts on right and left.


6. The number of post is , picquet is , and
the name of the officer commanding picquet is
7. In case of enemy’s mounted troops approaching, the
section-leader should be called and the picquet should be
■warned by signals. Avoid circling, moving, or doing any-
thing which would attract the enemy’s attention if possible.
One of the post should go, if necessary, to the picquet and
give the necessary information.
8. If the enemy approaches rapidly and suddenly, call up
the rest of the post, fire, and act according to circumstances.
9. Pay no compliments to officers or armed parties.
Sec. 20. Duties of Visiting Patrol.
Consists usually of two men, one being an officer or a non-
commissioned officer of the picquet. They will move along
the line of Cossack posts and sentries under cover from the
enemy’s view, and visit Cossack posts at uncertain times to
see if they are alert and have anything to report, also com-
municate with neighbouring picquets.
Sec. 21. Duties of Reconnoitring Patrol.
Consists of a small party under an officer or a permanent
section under a non-commissioned officer; gathers informa-
tion by pushing forward in front of the line of Cossack
posts and examining unseen ground, receiving following
orders from picquet commander :
1. Distance to go.
2. The road or direction to follow going and returning.
3. The ground particularly to examine.
4. Time will be expected back.
The principles laid down in Secs. 3 and 4 should be
studied under this head.


Sec. 22. Duties of Look-Out Sentry on the Picquet.
1. He should if possible see all the Cossack posts and
sentries, calling attention to any signals they may make.
2. He will be dismounted by day, sometimes mounted by
night, always with rifle unslung and loaded.
3. He will pay no compliments, and only challenge at
night.
4. A connecting sentry (mounted) may be placed between
him and any Cossack post he cannot see.
SUPPORTS.
Sec. 23. Supports.
The support should be about half a mile in rear of the
centre of its picquets, and in a position fulfilling the same
conditions as that laid down for a picquet, taking also into
consideration —
(a) The nature of the opposition intended to be made.
( h) The existence of cover from view.
(c) Shelter from bad weather.
Rules for picquet apply, though less stringently, to sup-
ports. A “ look-out sentry ” (mounted or dismounted)
should be placed in the direction of the picquet, and roads
may be barricaded, and position artificially strengthened.
Communicating patrols should be frequently sent to the
picquet, and a patrol kept in readiness to ascertain cause of
any alarm.
Sec. 24. Duties of Officer Commanding Support.
1. To carefully examine all country in his charge, noting
best position for disputing ground (on the line of resistance),
and strengthen it if possible.
2. To prepare scheme of defence.


3. To send at once all reports and information to reserve
and commander of outposts.
4. To detail a detached post when required and direct
the examining post to take up the position selected by the
officer commanding outposts.
Sec. 25. Duties of Examining Post.
(Usually furnished by the Support.)
An examining post consists of one or two sections under
an officer or a selected non-commissioned officer posted under
cover or where a main approach runs into a position by
which alone strangers may pass the chain of Cossack posts.
It is their duty to examine all persons attempting to pass
through the line of Cossack posts, and to detain them if
necessary.
A flag of truce must be detained until instructions are
I’eceived from superior authority, and if permitted to pass
must be blindfolded and led under an escort by a circuitous
route to the officer commanding outposts. Prisoners and
deserters must be ordered to lay down their arms and be
conducted in silence to the picquet commander.
No conversation, except by properly authorised persons,
is to be allowed on any subject, under any pretence, with
individuals bearing flags of truce, or with other messengers
from the enemy.
Sec. 26. Detached Posts.
(Usually furnished by the Support or Reserve.)
A detached post may be necessary in certain cases to
occupy some special point outside the regular chain of Cos-
sack posts. Its strength will depend upon circumstances.
Communication must be kept up with the outpost line.


RESERVE.
Sec. 27. The Reserve.
Usually consists of one-third to one-half of the whole force
detailed for outpost duty, and would only be required when
a large body, such as a regiment, is employed on outpost
duty. It should be placed about 600 or 1,000 yards in
rear, and near the centre of the supports, or may be divided,
when, for instance, the outpost line is very long, or the
country intersected or very difficult.
The troops forming the reserve should, as a rule, make
use of all available shelter,
If there is any chance of an attack at dawn or in the
evening, the reserve should move up close to the supports
until the patrols report that there is no danger.
Saddles and arms when taken off should be placed ready
opposite each man’s horse, and a guard detailed for receiving
messages, &c.
Any strong reconnoitring patrols, detached posts, or exa-
mining parties will be furnished by supports or reserve.
Sec. 28. Duties at Night.
Outposts at night, in civilised warfare, should seldom be
drawn closer to the camp, unless for some adequate tactical
reason, such as to hold the junction of roads or paths.
At night, except in very open country, the enemy can
only advance by roads and tracks. These should, therefore,
be strongly occupied, together with any bridges or fords
that lie to the front.
It is the sense of hearing, rather than the eyesight, which
must be depended on at night, and sentries should be placed
on, or close to, approaches.


When, by reason of darkness, of the absence of roads and
tracks, and landmarks, of the difficulties of the country, or
of the character of the enemy, patrolling by night is imprac-
ticable, standing patrols or detached posts should be pushed
out well beyond the line of sentries. It is advisable to send
the standing patrols beyond the line occupied by day, with
orders to conceal themselves close to the probable line of
approach. Nothing more disconcerts a night attack, carried
out in accordance with observations made during the day,
than to stumble on an enemy’s post sooner than expected.
When acting against an uncivilised enemy accustomed to
a life in the open, and whose senses of hearing and sight are
consequently very acute, the standing patrols or detached
parties must be especially on their guard to avoid surprise.
Alterations in the disposition of the outposts for night-
work should be arranged during daylight, and be carried
out after dusk.
If the bulk of the mounted troops is withdrawn at night-
fall, standing patrols, if practicable, should be left out
several miles to the front and flank, and should watch all
roads, bridges, and fords beyond the reach of the infantry
patrols.
Sec. 29. The Countersign.
All persons approaching a sentry’s post by night from
any direction are to be challenged :—“ Halt. Who comes
there 1 ” If the reply is “ Friend ,” the sentry will give the
order, “ Advance one, and give the countersign."
Persons who do not implicitly comply with the above
orders are to be fired upon.
Any one not in possession of the countersign, or giving
it incorrectly, must be sent to the examining post. If he
attempts to escape he is to be shot.


Sec. 30. Flags of Truce.
On the approach of a flag of truce, the sentry, assisted by
the Cossack post, will advance and halt it at such distance
as to prevent any of the party who compose it overlooking
the posts ; the section leader will then inform the officer
commanding the picquet, and will detain the flag of truce
until instructions are received.
If permission is given for it to enter the line, the
individuals bearing it must first be blindfolded, and then
led under escort to the commander of the outposts. No
conversation except by his permission is to be allowed on
any subject, under any pretence, with the persons bearing
the flag of truce.
If the flag of truce is merely the bearer of a letter or
parcel, the picquet officer must receive it, and instantly
forward it to headquarters. The flag of truce having taken
a receipt, will be required forthwith to depart, and no man
of the picquet must be suffered to hold any conversation
with the party.
Spies should be sent in under escort to the commander
of the outposts at once, without being questioned.
Sec. 31. Relief of the outposts.
1. If the force marches the next morning, the outposts
will quit their position as soon as the new advanced guard
has passed beyond them, and will join their units on the
march.
2. If the force halts, the outposts should be relieved
from the reserve (or from the main body, as the case may
be) every 24 hours.
The relief of the outpost squadrons, or of the whole out-
posts, is thus carried out: —


The relieving force parades in some central position to
receive its orders from the new commander of the
outposts.
Each commander of an outpost squadron, provided with
either a map or a guide, marches his squadron to
the position held by the squadron he is to relieve as
already explained ; and, having communicated with
the commander of this squadron sends out his
picquets, and, if necessary, detached posts, or
examining post.
The new picquet takes post alongside the old, and both
officers proceed to relieve the Cossack posts together,
the commander of the old picquet superintending the
relief of the posts, and making certain that all
orders and information are correctly transmitted.
At the same time, the men detailed for reconnoitring
patrols in both picquets go out together, so that the
new patrols may be shown the ground, ike., by those
who are already acquainted with it.
During the relief the officer going off duty communicates
everything regarding the post, particularly as
regards standing patrols, to the officer who relieves
him; any special orders being handed over in
writing.
As soon as the patrols have returned and reported all
secure, the old picquet falls back, and the new one
moves on to the ground it has vacated.
3. If outposts are sent out in the afternoon, they should
parade in sufficient time to receive their orders, and to
reach their position, send out their patrols, entrench their
positions and examine their ground, before sunset. This is
especially impoi tant in tropical countries. The same rule
holds good when outposts are relieved during the afternoon.


If outposts are relieved in the morning, the new outposts
should parade in time to receive their orders, and to be
close to the reserve (or supports) of the old outposts at the
first streak of light.
Sec. 32. Outposts Before or After a Battle.
If the enemy is close at hand and battle imminent, or if
the battle only ceases at nightfall to be renewed next day,
the whole of the troops must be in complete readiness for
action. There may not even be room for outposts, and the
troops will have to bivouac in their battle positions, pro-
tected only by patrols, Cossack posts or double sentries.
In such cases the first line is practically the outposts.
It will often occur, under these conditions, that no orders
can be issued as to measures of protection by superior
authority ; in such cases nothing can relieve the com-
manders of the regiments and squadrons in first line of the
responsibility of securing themselves from surprise, and,
unless circumstances forbid, of keeping touch of the enemy
by means of patrols.
Sec. 33. On the March from Day to Day.
When halting near dark till sunrise next morning, if at
some distance from the enemy, it will generally suffice to
place such marching outposts as will ensure the main body
till the next day.
All important points, e.g., cross-roads, defiles, fords,
bridges, <fec., at some little distance in front or on the flanks
of the position, should bo occupied at once. Each position
would probably be covered by a picquet and two or three
sections, inter-communication and information being main-
tained by patrols.
If close to the enemy, perhaps within a day’s march, the
same principle can be adopted, but great vigilance and


energetic patrolling will be necessary. The outposts will
nearly always be placed in twilight or darkness on unknown
ground, which the enemy will have no better opportunity
of examining than ourselves.
Sec. 34. Action in Case of Attack,
It is impossible to lay down any precise rules for the
conduct of outposts in case they are attacked by the enemy.
If they have performed their duty of gaining information
properly, the movement of the enemy will be known, and the
main body will be prepared for action.
The outposts, however, must be prepared to stand their
ground against any odds, until the main body has occupied
the defensive position previously selected. This does not
mean that the picquets, unless they have received special
orders to do so, should hold on to the last, but that the line
of resistance should be occupied, and that the outpost
squadrons, as soon as their flanks are threatened, should
retire gradually and systematically, disputing all favourable
ground.
The retreat should be carried out by successive portions
of the line, commencing from one or both flanks.
When, however, outposts are unexpectedly attacked by
an enemy of unknown strength, it is their duty to make as
strong a resistance as possible, in order to make the enemy
show his real force, and to find out whether the attack is
serious, or is only the attempt of a reconnoitring party to
push back the line of defence so as to discover the force
behind it.
In any case, the rule must be borne in mind on outpost
duty that, if necessary, the smaller fractions must sacrifice
themselves to protect the larger.
It must be always borne in mind that the power and
period of resistance of mounted men, when well posted and


invisible, is out of all proportion to their strength of
numbers.
A few determined men who are marksmen, should be
able to hold in check a very much larger attacking force
until their retreat is threatened.
Smokeless powder and the rapid power of locomotion fur-
nished by the proximity of their horses have enormously in-
creased the power of mounted troops on the defence.
The support should either reinforce the picquets if they
are successful or cover their retreat if they are driven in,
and should particularly guard against any picquet being
outflanked and cut off. The nature of the defence to be
made by the support will chiefly depend upon the facilities
offered by the ground. These points should all have been
carefully considered when the line of resistance was decided
upon.
As soon as the enemy’s intentions are evident, the com-
mander'sends word to the commander of the outposts, the
supports, and the neighbouring picquets.
(2) —When Acting as a Portion of a Mixed Force of
all Arms.
See. 35. Duties of the Mounted Troops on Outpost
Duty with a Mixed Force.
Even when there is an independent mounted force in
front, a proportion of mounted men should be allotted to
the outposts, and the commander of the outposts, before
writing his orders, must decide how these troops are to be
posted and distributed.
By day the mounted troops allotted to the outposts may
form an advanced screen several miles in front and on the
flanks of the outpost companies, or they may simply form
a mobile reconnoitring force.


Whether a screen is maintained at night must depend on
circumstances. It should be remembered, however, that, if
possible, touch with the enemy should always be maintained,
even during the darkness.
If it is decided to form an advanced screen, the general
line to be occupied will be determined by the commander
of the outposts, and notified in his orders; but all details
will be left to the immediate commander of the mounted
troops.
If there is a body of independent cavalry in front, the
mounted troops will be pushed out as a connection between
the independent cavalry and the outposts.
In this case the squadrons or troops will generally occupy
important points more or less distant from the front and
flanks of the outposts, such as passages over rivers, defiles,
isolated hills, road junctions, <fec.
In selecting a general line to be occupied by his mounted
troops, the commander of the outposts will be guided by the
following considerations :
1. The importance of keeping touch with the enemy.
2. The importance of patrolling round the enemy’s flanks.
3. The distance that the patrols have to cover in recon-
noitring the enemy’s position ; the shorter this dis-
tance the less the fatigue.
4. The necessity for constant intercommunication between
all bodies of troops holding the general line, and of
co-operation if the enemy attacks.
5. Defensive capabilities.
6. Facilities for observation, and thus economising patrols,
7. Facilities for feeding men and horses.
If it is considered inadvisable, in consequence of the
wear of horseflesh, to form a screen of mounted meti in ad


vance of the outpost companies, the commander of the
mounted troops will reconnoitre the enemy’s position, send-
ing back a proportion of his force to report to the
commander of the outposts for distribution among the
outpost companies, &c. •
Sec. 36. Allotment of the Mounted Troops to Infantry
Outposts.
The commander of the outposts will direct the officer
commanding mounted troops to allot a proportion of
mounted troops (usually mounted infantry) to each section
of the outpost (or to outpost infantry companies), and to
the reserve both for patrolling and for orderlies.
In a mixed line of outposts reconnaissance will be
especially the duty of cavalry and of the mounted troops,
while the protection is rather the work of infantry. The
two arms must co-operate together in these duties.
The number of mounted men is determined by the
following considerations ;
1. By day, if the enemy is within 10 miles, and there is
no body of independent cavalry to the front, there
should be enough mounted men with the outposts to
keep touch with him, and to watch the flanks. If
he is over 10 miles away, there should be enough
mounted men to patrol or watch for that distance
all the roads by which he may approach the camp.
A troop on each, with supporting squadrons at the
junction of two or more, will generally be sufficient,
2. If a body of independent cavalry lies between the out-
posts and the enemy, the former should still be
covered by posts and patrols of mounted men ; who
should, if possible, keep touch with the independent
cavalry.


3, By night, if the bulk of the mounted troops are with-
drawn, a section should be left out on each road as
standing patrols. At night, except in very open
country, the enemy can only advance by roads and
tracks. TheSe should, therefore, be strongly occupied,
together with any bridges or fords that lie to the
front, and beyond the reach of the infantry patrols.
Sec. 37. Cyclists.
Many of the duties enumerated in Sec. 36 could be well
carried out by cyclists in place of mounted troops.
In any case, for orderly duty it is most advisable that
where possible cyclists should be used. Nothing expends
the condition of horses so rapidly as outpost duty and the
service of orderlies. Every consideration, therefore, should
be paid to the representations of the officers commanding
mounted troops in these regards.
(2).—PROTECTION OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH.—
ADVANCED, REAR, AND FLANK GUARDS.
Sec. 38. Advanced Guard—General Observations.
1. Every body of troops moving in a hostile country, or
through a country in which it is possible that an enemy
may be encountered, should be preceded by an advanced
guard.
2. The general duties of the advanced guard are as
follows :
(a) To search for the enemy, and guard against
surprise.
(b) When the enemy is met, to push back his advanced
troops, and prevent the march from being
interrupted.


(c) If the enemy is encountered advancing in superior
force, to hold him in check until the necessary
dispositions for opposing him have been made.
(d) If the enemy is discovered on the defensive, to take
up the most advanced position compatible with
security against counter-attack, and to use all the
means at disposal, except reconnoitring in force,
to ascertain the hostile dispositions.
3. The advanced guard system is divided into two
portions, the vanguard and the main guard.
The instructions contained in the following sections will
be found to be very simple, if the prineiples, which have
been illustrated by the extended hand in Sec. 1, are
thoroughly understood. (Vide Diagram XXXY.)
Advanced guards, rear guards, and flank guards perform
the same duties in relation to a force on the march as out-
posts to one halted.
The distance between the advanced guard and the
column depends upon circumstances. If too great, the
advanced guard runs the risk of being overwhelmed ; if too
small the main body may be surprised.
4. The leader must, however, be guided by the follow-
ing considerations; —
(a) As the advanced guard has to give timely warn-
ing of an enemy’s approach, it must be pushed
further to the front in proportion to the length
of time the main body requires to deploy, and the
ease and rapidity with which the enemy can
advance.
(h) The time intelligence is likely to take in coming in
and being transmitted, and the amount of resist-
ance that can be offered by the advanced guard,
must be taken into account.


(c) The character of the enemy, and his tactics and
armament, materially affect the position of the
advanced guard.
(d) It is clear that on a night march, or in snowy,
foggy, hazy, or rainy weather, the distance between
the various parts of the advanced guard and its
distance from the main body must be reduced ;
while in a very open country, by day, when com-
munication can be freely maintained, the several
parts can extend over a greater range.
Sec. 39. Composition and Formation of an Advanced Guard
of Mounted Troops.
The strength will vary from one sixth to one-fourth of
the whole force.
The principle of the formation of an advanced guaid is,
that it should consist of a number of bodies gradually
increasing in strength from front to rear, so as to oppose a
constantly increasing resistance to an enemy, and to provide
each party in front with immediate support if any slight
opposition impedes its advance.
Supposing a squadron to be employed for this duty, it
will usually be divided into the following parts :
(a I Advanced party )
0 , 1 J >
(o) Support f
,
or vanguard.
s
(c) Reserve, with flanking patrols, or main guard.
On receiving the order to form the advanced guard, the
squadron commander will tell off his squadron {vide Sec. 42).
Any particular directions regarding the road to be
followed, intervals, distances, the flanking patrols to be
sent out by the reserve, &c., will then be communicated to
the parties concerned. These instructions will be short and
precise, stating clearly the names of the places to be passed,
and will be repeated by those concerned.


On the order being received for the advance guard to
move off, the squadron commander will give the preliminary
caution, “ Form the Advanced Guard.”
The advanced party and flanking patrols (each preceded
by a file as advanced scouts) will move at an increased
pace so as to get their proper position in front and on the
flanks of the advanced guard; for tie former this is
about 600 yards in front of the support, and for the latter
at an interval of not less than half a mile from the reserve,
and roughly in line with it.
When the rest of the squadron (support and reserve) have
advanced a sufficient distance from the main body (which
will vary with circumstances, but about 600 yards may be
taken as the normal distance), the reserve will be ordered
to walk, the support moving on until it gets about 600
yards in advance of the reserve.
Thus, under ordinary circumstances the advanced guard
will cover about a mile in front and the same distance in
depth.
As regards the distances to be kept up between the
various parts of the advanced guard and the latter from the
main body, the commander must use his discretion, being
guided by the following general principles :
Each fraction (scouts, advanced party, support and
reserve) should cross the intervening space from one point
of observation to another rapidly at a trot, whilst behind
each commanding rise a short halt should be made till the
body next behind has drawn within its normal distance ;
at this juncture a further advance will be made to the next
rising ground, when the fraction will again halt under
cover, and the same procedure will be followed.
By this means horseflesh is saved, the ground is
thoroughly examined, and the advance of the force is carried
out in security with the least possible delay.


(a) Commander oj the Advanced Guard.
The commander’s attention must be principally directed
to the following points ;—•
1. Measures for the security of the march.
2. The ground, and how best to take advantage of it.
3. What he proposes to do if the enemy is encountered.
In order to enable the commander to take full advantage
of the ground in case of attack, a correct reconnaissance of
the road and neighbouring country is indispensable.
The commander of an advanced guard should thoroughly
understand the general intentions of his superior, and
should have clear instructions as to the line of action which
is desired in case of collision with the enemy.
Before starting, the commander should note in his pocket
book the main points in his instructions, such as the places
he is to pass, and should mark the latter on his map. He
should also take care that maps are distributed, roughly
copied, or at any rate inspected by and explained to the
officers and N.C.O.’s.
He must carefully inspect his command, and pay parti-
cular attention to the arms and ammunition, to the saddling,
state of the shoeing, spare shoes, &c., and to the rations
and forage to be carried.
The commander of the advanced guard will usually
march with the reserve, but being responsible for the con-
duct of the whole advanced guard, is not restricted to any
one position.
All orders for the advanced guard are sent to him, as
also all reports from the various fractions of the advanced
guard ; such of the latter as are of importance will be for-
warded by him to the commander of the main body, but he
will invariably state his own opinion as to their reliability.
He will keep the commander of the main body regularly


informed as to the movements of the enemy, and anything
that could affect the movements of the main body.
Should he at any time leave the reserve, he will make
arrangements to ensure his receiving orders and reports
without delay, and will instruct the coram inder of the
reserve how to act in his absence.
( h ) Commander of the Advanced Party.
In order to carry out the special duties of his command
he must utilise every possible means for obtaining informa-
tion regarding the enemy, his numbers, position, &c. To
do this it is not only necessary to send out patrols and
observe for himself, but all persons who are likely to be
able to give information should be questioned, and whenever
possible prisoners should be taken.
(c) Formation and Duties of the Advanced Party.
The duties of the advanced party are
(a) To explore the ground and cover the march of the
advanced guard in such a manner as to avoid
unnecessary delays.
( h) Reconnoitre the road and the country on both sides
of the main line of advance, with regard to the
nature of the road and the main features of the
country from a military point of view.
(c) Rapidly gather as complete aad reliable information
regarding the enemy as possible.
(d) Drive back hostile parties opposing the advance, and
take prisoners from th<m.
(«) Detect, and at all hazards defeat, any attempts of the
enemy to place obstacles in the roads, destroy bridges
or otherwise impede the free passage of the troops.
The advanced party will move along the route to be
followed by the main body. If the march is on a confined


road, a section will be sent forward, as advanced scouts,
about 100 yards, and at least one man should ride 20 yards
or so in rear of the party. If the country is open, or there
are parallel roads on either side of the main line of advance,
sections will be detached to either flank, with orders to keep
generally within touch of the centre sections, and roughly
level with them. Each section should move in diamond
shape, i.e., one man in front as scout and one in rear.
The special duties of the advanced scouts are to observe
the country in front and on the immediate flanks.
( d) The Support.
The Support forms the body from which the advanced party
are reinforced, it supplies any other detachments that may be
required in front, and is the first formed body of any size
to meet the enemy.
Whenever the advanced party halts, the support also
halts, as far as possible under cover, until the cause of delay
is ascertained. Similarly, it halts whilst a village or wood
is being turned, until it is seen that it is unoccupied or the
reverse.
If there is a guide, he will, as a rule, march with the
support.
The support keeps up connection with the advanced party
by means of a connecting file, which will ride about 300
yards in advance ; it also provides a connecting file which
rides 300 yards in advance of the reserve.
(e) The Seserve.
The Reserve must, be ready at all times to move quickly
to the front or flank if its assistance should be required, or
to form a rallying point for the parties in front.
The only detachments regularly supplied by it are the
flanking patrols and a connecting file halfway between it
and the main body.


Sec. 40. Communication between the parts of the Guard.
The advanced party and flanking patrols communicate,
as far as possible, by signals, as riding backwards and
forwards uses up the horses. These signals should consist
principally of signs, such as holding the hand over the head
for “Halt,” and pointing in any direction in which they
wish the others to look. If advanced scouts have to report
anything, only one man should ride in with the informa-
tion. Scouts on the extreme flanks should, if possible,
communicate anything of great importance to the nearest
scouts.
Signalling with flags is not generally suitable so far in
advance, as it might attract the enemy’s attention ; but
signallers should always accompany the advanced guard so
as to be able to transmit intelligence whenever circum-
stances render it possible to do so with safety, and when
time and horseflesh can be saved thereby. Cyclists might
be utilised for these purposes.
The chief duty of the connecting files is to facilitate the
several parties of the advanced guard keeping the proper
distance and taking the same direction, and they will call
attention to any considerable deviation in these respects.
They will at once repeat signals either from the front or
rear, and must, therefore, constantly look back at the next
party in rear. They must be especially alert when the
road is winding or passes over hilly ground, and when
marching through towns or woods at night and in thick
weather.
Connecting files should always be double when men can
be spared.
As the rate of march of the main body necessarily regu-
lates that of the advanced guard, each party of the latter
must be careful to maintain connection with the body next


in rear of it. To this end links should be dropped at points
where, owing to bends in the road or to the hilly or enclosed
nature of the country, the usual connecting files are unable
to keep in sight the parties between which they are
marching. This precaution will often be necessary at
cross roads or where a road divides.
As the habit of constant communication is essential, a
report should be sent from the advanced guard to the main
body every hour, or other named period.
Sec. 41. To Tell off a Squadron as an Advanced Guard.

Sec. 4:2. The Advanced Guard of a Mixed Force of
all Arms.
1. The strength of the advanced guard depends on the
numbers and whereabouts of the enemy; but when there
is the slightest chance of a conflict, it will be proportionate
to the strength of the force it is covering, and will vary
from a fourth to an eighth. The general rule is that the
advanced guard should be strong enough, in case the enemy
is met advancing to the attack, to give the main body time
to form up for action ; or, in case the enemy is in position,
to hold its own against counter-attack.
The larger the force, the larger in proportion will be the
advance guard, for a considerable force takes a long time to
form up and prepare for action.
2. As the advanced guard for a mixed force of all arms
has to perform the double duty of reconnoitring and fighting,
it will usually be composed of all arms.
3. The proportion of each arm will depend on the nature
of the work to be done, and the character of the country to
be traversed.
In an open country, the number of mounted troops and
guns may be proportionately much greater than in a close
or mountainous country.
4. In mountainous or forest country, as well as for
purposes of instruction, an advanced guard may be formed
of infantry alone. Otherwise, no body of infantry should
M.S.M. I


be allowed to inarch in the proximity of the enemy without
being secured from surprise by a proportion of mounted
men.
Mounted infantry will be especially valuable in moving
rapidly to seize or hold special points, such as commanding
hills, bridges, defiles, where it may be necessary to forestall
the enemy, or by the occupation of which the further move-
ments of the advanced guard may be facilitated. It may
also be usefully employed in turning the flanks of hostile
troops who may have checked the vanguard, or in support
of the advanced guard cavalry.
5. A party of engineers will usually be attached to the
advanced guard for the purpose of removing obstacles which
require skilled labour.
6. The special circumstances of the case must determine
the amount of baggage that accompanies the advanced
guard. But when it is likely that the enemy may be
encountered, the advanced guard should not be encumbered
with transport.
See. 43. Dispositions on the March.
1. The principles which affect the disposition of a mixed
force of all arms are identical with those laid down in the
case of a regiment {vide Secs. 38 and 39), the rules which
govern the distance of the main guard from the vanguard
are as follows :
(a) The vanguard will be sufficiently far ahead to pre-
clude the possibility of the main guard being
unexpectedly assailed by long range fire.
(b) The main guard will never be so far in rear as to be
unable to render rapid and effective support to the
vanguard in case of emergency.
2. The main guard should be sufficiently far ahead of the
troops it is covering to give them time to form up and


prepare for action in case of attack, and also to secure them
from coming under fire while on the line of march.
3. Connection should be maintained between the different
parts of the advanced guard by mounted orderlies, cyclists,
signallers, or connecting files, and also between the main
guard and the troops in rear.
4. At cross-roads, or points where it is possible that the
main body may take the wrong route, one or more men
should be dropped by the main guard to point out the way.
Sec. 44. Advanced Guard in a Retreat.
It is always advisable to have a small advanced guard to
a retreating force. Its special duty is to clear away
obstacles that would delay the march. But it should
observe all precautions against surprises. A strong party
of engineers should be attached for the removal of obstacles,
restoration of bridges, repair of roads, &c.
Sec. 45. Method of Examining Localities.
(a) The Main Road.
The following are the points to which attention must be
directed :
The Road —lts condition, gradients, width, bridges, fords,
embankments, &c. If any obstacles to the march exist,
their nature, and method of turning them, must be reported.
(6) Villages, Towns, &c.
If there is reason to suppose that a place is unoccupied,
it is generally sufficient if the advanced party rides rapidly
round and through it, after a preliminary examination by
its advanced scouts, signalling to the support that all is
clear.
In localities where there are post or telegraph offices, all
letters, registers, &c,, should be seized as soon as possible,


Whilst the commander is questioning the inhabitants the
supports halt on the near side, the advanced party watching
the approaches on the far side. When he has finished, the
support trots through the village, and the parties in advance
regain their distance also at the trot.
If any of the enemy are met in the village the advanced
scouts should, if necessary, fire so as to warn their com-
rades, and then either follow up the enemy if he retires or
await the advanced party.
If there is reason to think that the locality is occupied,
the first thing is to approach as close as possible without
delay, and endeavour to reconnoitre the place from some
neighbouring height. If this cannot be done, the advanced
party will endeavour to work up to and round the place in
order to ascertain the enemy’s strength and dispositions,
while the support halts under cover.
Houses should be searched by men in parties of at least
two, one to remain at the entrance, and, if possible, they
ought to be able to communicate during the search by
speaking.
In searching localities on the line of march care must be
taken that the advance of the rest of the advanced guard
and the main body is not thereby delayed. The advanced
bodies must, therefore, trot on in time to examine the
places which cannot be passed without being searched.
If an inhabited place is merely passed on the march, it
should not be altogether left by the advanced guard until
the arrival of the main body, and care is to be taken that
no information is sent by any of the inhabitants to the
enemy.
If the place is the termination of a march and the main
body is to be halted there, it falls to the advanced guard,
after entering and examining it with due precaution, to
make every preparation to ensure permanent security, also


to obtain every possible information as regards the enemy
and as regards the supplies and resources generally.
To this end the following steps will be taken ;
(1) All approaches are to be reconnoitred and guarded,
and the best look-out stations occupied.
(2) The town-hall, railway station, and post and telegraph
offices are to be occupied, and schools, offices, &c., searched
for maps if required.
(3) The mayor, or corresponding personage, will be
required to wait on the commanding officer, and to afford
information regarding the neighbourhood, roads, bridges,
ferries, fords, resources in provisions, bakeries, mills, drink-
ing places, smithies, saddlers’, wheelwrights’ and carpenters’
shops; he will also procure guides if required.
(4) In an enemy’s country the authorities will be ordered
to cause all weapons to be brought, at a fixed time, to some
enclosed space, where they will be rendered useless.
(c) Woods.
In examining a wood the centre section of the advanced
party follows the main road, the flank sections riding round
the outskirts, if the wood is not too large. If the wood be
large, the centre and flank sections will detach as many files
as may be required to search it thoroughly, the men keep-
ing touch as far as possible from the centre.
( d) Defiles.
The course to be pursued is much the same as with
villages and woods. The crest of the defile, if it is formed
by high ground, should be searched by scouts rather in
advance of the advanced party. If there is reason to
suppose that the defile is unoccupied, the different parties
pass it at the trot, the advanced party proceeding as quickly


as possible, on reaching the far side, to any spot from which
a view can be obtained.
(e) Rivers.
On arriving at a river, the passages must be carefully
examined, and if the bridges are broken, insecure, or insuf-
ficient, their state must be at once reported, and steps taken
if necessary to procure the workmen and material required
for their repair. The most important point is to secure as
many points of passage as possible for the troops in rear,
and to indicate in good time their suitability for the several
arms.
Sec. 46. Flank Guard.
1. If there is any possibility of a column on the march
being attacked in flank, a flank guard or guards should be
especially detailed.
With a large force, the flank guard will usually be fur-
nished by the main body ; with a small force, by the main
guard.
2. The duties of flank guards are the same as those of
advanced guards with the exception that a flank guard will
be more often required to hold its ground, without support,
until the main body has reached a certain point.
3. The strength, formation, and composition of a flank
guard, and also the distance from the main body is governed
by the same principles as those laid down for an advanced
guard.
4. A flank guard will reconnoitre and protect itself by
adopting the same dispositions as an advanced guard, but
with stronger reconnoitring parties and supports on the
exposed flank.
5. Should the main body change direction so that the
march becomes a flank march {i.e., a march across the
enemy’s front),it will generally be advisable to use the old


advanced guard as a flank guard, and to form a new
advanced guard, and, if necessary, a rear guard, from the
main body.
Sec. 47. Rear Guard—Composition and Duties.
1. A rear guard to troops retreating is essentially a
fighting force of the three arms. The principal duty of the
mounted troops forming part of a rearguard is to keep touch
with the enemy, and discover his movements. Artillery is
valuable on account of its long range and facility for easily
withdrawing from and taking up other positions. Fire-
power is of paramount importance as a resisting force,
causing the enemy to be delayed, and time to be gained. •
2. The duty of a rear guard is to enable the main body
to conduct its retreat in good order, and without being
molested by the enemy. It should be lightly equipped and
unaccompanied by baggage.
3. The first thing a defeated force requires is to be
relieved from the pressure of a too close pursuit. This is
done by detaching a portion of the force as a rear guard to
make head against the enemy’s advance while the remainder
continues the retreat. The remainder of the force is thus
enabled to continue its movement in comparative safety
and gradually to recover order and confidence.
4. The strength of a rear guard may vary from one-fourth
to one-fifth or even one-third of the force to which it
belongs, and the artillery' may be brought up to a strength
out of all proportion to that of the rear guard itself.
Sec. 48. Formation and Distance.
When the pursuit is not close, the disposition of a rear
guard on the line of march will closely resemble that of an
advanced guard reversed, with the distances somewhat
reduced. In a mixed force of all arms the mounted troops


should form the extreme rear, watching the country by
which the enemy could advance. The mounted troops will
be supported by some infantry, called the rear party, which
will act in the same manner as a vanguard. The remainder
of the troops of the rear guard move as a main guard in the
order in which it can most readily come into action, and
there should always be some infantry between the artillery
and the enemy.
A squadron detailed for the rear guard is told off in a
similar manner to that for an advanced guard. (Vide Sec.
41 and PIatesXXXVIII. and XXXIX.) On the order to
march, however, being received, the support and rear party,
&c., gain their distance by allowing the rest of the force to
march off; the flanking patrols move off at once.
All details regarding the method of watching the enemy
and conducting the other duties laid down for the advanced
party are equally applicable to the rear party.
Special care must be taken in the choice of the flanking
patrols and the direction they are to follow, as on them
falls the task of detecting the turning movements the enemy
is sure to undertake.
Too great a distance should not be allowed to intervene
between the rear guard and the force it is covering. When
a rear guard halts to fight, every moment separates it fur-
ther from the main body ; whereas with a pursuing force
every moment brings its reinforcements closer.
The distance, however', of the reserve of a rear guard
from the main body should, if possible, be at least a mile,
and should be sufficient to prevent the main body being
shelled by the enemy, especially in passing a defile.
A rear guard should keep strong patrols, if necessary
strongly supported, as wide as possible to the flanks. Early
information will thus be obtained of any attempt of the
enemy to pass between the rear guard and the main body


With a mixed force of all arms it is seldom advisable to
detach parties of infantry to move at a distance on the
flanks. If the enemy be in force, these parties could effect
little. If he be not in force, his movements in that direc-
tion, once they are discovered, are of little importance.
The rear guard should, as a rule, move concentrated, ready
to fight with its full strength, but keeping strong scouting
parties well out to its flanks and rear to obtain information,
and to keep the advanced parties of the enemy at a distance.
Sec. 49. Action of a Bear Guard.
1. The manner in which a rear guard carries out its
mission of gaining time for the remainder of the force to
retreat in good order, is by compelling the enemy’s troops
to halt and deploy for attack as frequently as possible.
This is usually effected by taking up a succession of defen-
sive positions which the enemy is compelled to make dis-
positions for attacking or turning. When these dispositions
are nearly complete, the rear guard moves off in echelon
and repeats this action on the next favourable ground. All
this consumes time, and time is what is most needed by a
retreating force.
2. In occupying positions of this kind, two important
points have to be observed : (1) to show as strong a front
as possible to the enemy; (2) to make sure of good lines of
retreat.
3. The manner of occupying a rear guard position differs
from that of occupying a position meant to be resolutely
defended. The object of a rear guard is to compel the enemy
to deploy a considerable portion of his force before ventur-
ing to attack, and then to move off before the attack is
pressed home. It can therefore place the greater part of
its force in the fighting line from the outset, retaining a


proportionately small part in reserve; and it is generally
advisable to make a great display of force.
4. The artillery should be able to open fire on the enemy
at long range, and thus compel his infantry to assume attack
formation at the greatest possible distance.
The means of retiring from it should be convenient.
Guns posted wide on the flank of a rear guard position
have great facilities for offence, but must be accompanied
by a strong escort, or they will run grave risk of being cut
off.
Sec. 50. Commander of Bear Guard.
1. A point of great importance to the commander of a
rear guard is judging the proper time to retire. If he
retires too soon he is only partly carrying out the work
required from the rear guard. If he falls into the error of
trying to dispute every inch of ground he will lose time,
and while he is allowing one portion of the enemy’s
force to hold him in front, another portion will turn him
and cut him off.
2. When retreating, it is always advisable to send
beforehand a reliable officer to the rear to note favourable
positions for defence on the line of retreat of the rear guard.
3. Clear instructions should be given to the commander
of a rear guard as to the extent to which he is at liberty to
break down bridges, burn villages, destroy property, &c.,
with a view to impeding the enemy’s advance ; for the
retreat may be only of a temporary character, and it may
be in contemplation soon to re-occupy the country passed
through. In default of orders the commander must use his
own discretion.
4. Boats should be removed to the side of the river
further from the enemy and sunk. Villages, woods, and
houses if the circumstances demand it, can be set on fire by the
rear party, after it has passed them. The enemy’s move


ments may be greatly hindered by the destruction of
railway, and especially of telegraphic communications.
Sec. 51. Counter Attacks.
Counter attacks should'seldom be resorted to by rear
guards, except to gain time when hard pressed, or when the
enemy commits some obvious blunder. There can be little
hope of inflicting an appreciable defeat on the enemy who
is being constantly reinforced by troops in rear ; and it is of
more importance to save one’s own men for the arduous duty
assigned to them than to inflict a loss on the enemy that he
can quickly make good.
Sec. 52. Rear Guard to a Force Advancing.
A rear guard to a force advancing is chiefly employed
in collecting stragglers, guarding baggage, keeping off
marauders, and generally covering the rear of the column.
It is usually composed of infantry with sometimes a few
mounted men added for watching the flanks.
C.—GENERAL DUTIES OF MOUNTED TROOPS
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER ARMS.
The general duties of mounted troops in relation to the
other arms are that they are, in the first place, the eyes
and ears of the force to which they are attached, and, in
the second place, it is for them with their fire power and
with their means of rapid movement and of long-sustained
marches to turn positions and to threaten and strike at the
line of communications of the enemy.
The duties of mounted troops as the eyes and ears of the
Army have been dealt with at length under the foregoing
headings of (A) Information and (B) Protection respectively
in this Part IV.


It is now proposed under the two following headings to
deal with the considerations which govern the best and
most effective development of their fire power and mobility.
It is upon these two factors that tactical victory on the
field of battle, or strategical success in the theatre of opera-
tions, must almost tntirely depend.
It is well, before considering the details involved, to
broadly understand how these principles may be best
applied. No better illustration of the effective power of
mounted troops in modern war seems to present itself than
that fighting formation always spoken of as the bull’s head
and horns, which was adopted by the best fighting tribes of
South Africa—the Matabele and the Zulu.
The main army was represented by the head, whence, as
soon as the enemy’s positions and intentions had been
ascertained, the horns rapidly developed, so that whether
the main body or head maintained a defensive attitude, or
advanced upon the enemy, the two horns or wings circling
round gripped the enemy in an enveloping movement.
These tactics were borrowed by the Boerk, as the experience
of their early campaigns of two centuries ago, and have
been adopted by them in all their campaigns since, and
were constantly practised against our troops in the campaigns
of 1881 and 1899-1901.
Occasions will not be numerous in which an enveloping
attack on both flanks will be possible, and it is more likely
that the development of one flank only be possible, both on
account of the number of troops required, and having regard
to the counter-movements of the enemy.
It is impossible to lay down the exact proportion which
mounted troops should bear to the other arms. Circum-
stances must dictate what is necessary and what is feasible.
Much must depend upon the character of the country in


which the campaign is conducted as well as upon the fight-
ing qualities of the enemy.
D.—THE FIGHT— OR THE TACTICS OF MOUNTED
TROOPS.
In considering the tactics of Mounted Troops trained to
fight on foot, it will be sufficient to treat of the offensive.
The defensive tactics are necessarily a dismounted service,
and as such dealt with in Part I; They are comparatively
simple.
The tactics, however, of the offensive may not appear so
simple, and they will be enlarged upon accordingly in the
following paragraphs.
Carrying out the principles laid down in 0. the aim
generally of the offensive action of mounted troops will be,
as explained by the simile of the bull’s head and horns, to
hold an enemy in front with one portion of the force, and
with the other either to get quickly upon one or both flanks,
and, if possible, to strike in upon his rear. Mounted troops
trained to fight on foot must always bear in mind that they
are comparatively weak when mounted, and that if attacked
by cavalry, or even by active men on foot, their only means
of effective defence is by their prompt dismounted action.
In dismounted action the vulnerability of the horses must
never be lost sight of. Every precaution also must be
taken to avoid being taken by surprise, or being attacked
by cavalry in country especially favourable to that arm,
where alone a sudden charge might have some possible
chance of success.
An offensive movement or attack would as a rule be
divided into three phases, thus :
I. The reconnoitring phase.
11. The manoeuvring phase.
111. The attack.


I. The Reconnoitring Phase.
The first phase is best carried out by reconnoitring patrols,
which have been already dealt with in A. Early and
accurate information should reach the commander to enable
him to carry out the second or manoeuvring phase to the
best advantage, and thus to make the best dispositions for
the 3rd or attacking phase.
The principle should be observed that in order to bring a
mounted force superior to that of the enemy at decisive
points it is essential to avoid any unnecessary dispersion
of squadrons from the main body ; as few men as possible
should be detached for the service of security, retaining as
many as possible for fighting purposes.
11. The Manoeuvring Phase.
Mounted Troops acting with Cavalry as an Independent Force,
Assuming that the force of mounted troops is moving in
a country adapted to cavalry action, that the advanced
guard reports the enemy in strength several miles in front,
and that the commander determines to engage him, his first
duty will be to thoroughly reconnoitre the ground in his
immediate front, and decide upon the actual area towards
which he will manoeuvre so as to bring about the fight.
He will in assuming that a portion of the force is cavalry
be governed for the most part by the quality and class of
the troops under his command, and of those opposed to him.
Positions should, if possible, be selected for the artillery,
machine guns and mounted troops trained to fight on foot
which fulfil the following conditions :
(1) They should command any ground within range which
the enemy might be able to take up whilst affording
natural flank protection and ample cover.


(2) They should be concealed from the enemy, for example,
a wood or village with water and hedge-rows would
form suitable points provided that ingress and ogress
were simple.
(3) The ground on either, or at least on one flank of the
position, should admit of the free deployment and
unrestricted manoeuvre of the cavalry, e g., ground
of an open, undulating character, the isolated
features (farms, copses, &c.) upon which do not
hamper its movements.
The features of the ground should also be used to screen
the manoeuvre of the cavalry force, especially where they
present rallying points which can be occupied with machine
guns or dismounted men to cover a retreat and check
pursuit. The object of the leader in this phase of the
action will be to ascertain his adversary’s strength and
dispositions, to divine his intentions, and if possible to so
manoeuvre his own force as to compel the enemy to conform
to his movements, and then allure him, if possible, into the
close vicinity of the concealed dismounted troops and guns.
It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the com-
mander should have a quick eye for country, decide on his
plans without hesitation, and move his command with the
utmost promptitude.
The commander has next to consider upon which flank of
the guns he will manoeuvre so as to draw on the enemy. So
many considerations having reference to the effectual
co-operation of cavalry, mounted troops, and artillery are
dependent upon local conditions that it is impossible to lay
down any rule.
Exact orders for formation to be adopted in this phase
cannot be definitely stated. They should be such as are
most suitable for drawing the enemy on and concealing our
own force, while admitting of rapid and certain concentra


tion. An echelon of three lines will generally be suitable,
the Ist line preferably in line of squadron columns, the 2nd
line moving in a concentrated but flexible order of forma-
tion upon the exposed flank, viz., mass, and taking every
advantage of ground independently, and third line consisting
probably of artillery, machine guns, and the mounted
troops trained to fight on foot upon the inner or pivot
flank. Vide Plate XL.
The movements, which should be as simple as possible,
will consist principally of changes of position and advances
by successive larger or smaller echelons.
As soon as its position is decided upon, the artillery and
3rd line mounted troops will move rapidly towards it, but
the guns will not unlimber until the mass of the enemy
appears, or his position is ascertained, and the cavalry has
commenced its manoeuvres to draw the enemy into the
required situation, the 3rd line acting as pivot and support.
The same general principles apply to the manoeuvre of
the smaller units in this phase.
111. The Attack.
The final or attacking phase with a force composed of
cavalry and mounted troops combined would be that the
Ist line breaking into the enemy endeavours to ride him
down with the first onslaught, that the 2nd line supports
the Ist, and finally that the 3rd line composed of the
artillery, and mounted troops trained to fight on foot, either
moves so as to make good the vantage won by the Ist and
2nd lines, or makes a pivot and a rallying point in case of
reverse.
In the event of mounted troops acting alone, the attack
would be mad# by the Ist line dismounted in the most
favourable ground available, a portion of the force would,
however, be always held in hand, mounted probably in the


PLATE XL.


2nd line for disposal according to circumstances. The 3rd
line carrying out the principles already indicated would
endeavour to turn the enemy’s flank and to strike his rear.
Mounted Troops acting as a Component Part of a Mixed
Force of all Arms.
In acting with a mixed force of all arms the duty of the
mounted troops would be, after providing a certain propor-
tion for patrol and reconnoitring purposes as a screen to
the infantry, to establish a superiority over the mounted
troops of the enemy, and then from one or both flanks to
gain the flanks and rear of the enemy.
A commander in this must be guided entirely by his own
judgment. He must be careful to avoid being outflanked
in his turn, and he must further avoid getting under the
direct fire of his own main body in his attempts upon the
rear of the enemy. It is wisely said, as regards attacks
upon the flank and rear of an enemj', that once the troops
of the enemy begin to look behind and think of the safety
of their line of retreat victory is half assured.
Mounted troops, however, thus committed to action on
foot must be prepared to press the attack home.
E.—WIDE-TURNING MOVEMENTS AND RAIDS, OR
THE STRATEGY OF MOUNTED TROOPS.
1. General Observations.
The importance of raids or strategical marches of mounted
troops cannot be too strongly emphasised.
Such operations can only be successful if arranged and
organised beforehand, with infinite care and pains. Infor-
mation should be obtained, precisely indicating where
provisions and forage could be obtained, where horses can be
watered and rivers forded, and where roads are practicable.


The troops themselves and their horses require also to be
in first-rate condition, hard, and inured to war. It is
hardly necessary to add that the difficulties are far less
when the operations are undertaken in a country which is
fairly well known and among a population which is friendly.
There can be no doubt that in all future campaigns
wherever there is a numerous and highly organised body of
mounted troops on either side, and when the country, com-
prising the theatre of war, is favourable, raids or invasions
of mounted troops into the country occupied by the enemy
will be one of the most important duties of the mounted
services.
On the declaration of war, mounted troops should be
employed on extensive raids to impede the mobilisation of
the enemy ; to destroy communications by road and rail, to
levy contributions, and to seize depots of warlike stores;
this action, as well as that of reconnoitring, will bring on
collisions between the two opposing forces of mounted
troops, as well as the advanced guards of other arms.
The result of these actions will largely influence the fate
of the campaign.
2. Illustrations—Strategical Operations.
The strategical power of mounted troops has been com-
mented upon in the Preface to this Aranual. The following
instances speak for themselves, and may be accepted as
examples ;
Napoleon’s Campaign, 1813-1814.—1 n the Napoleonic
campaigns of 1813 and 1814, the Russian cavalry operations
were organised and led in a far bolder manner than in any
previous campaigns of that age. Among the most famous
may be mentioned Tchernikoffs operations far in rear of the
French army after the battle of Grossbeeren in the autumn of


1813. On this occasion the Russian leader, well emulated
thereafter by the American commanders, advanced 140 miles
at the head of 3,000 horsemen and four guns into the heart of
Westphalia, and captured and retained possession of Cassel,
the capital of that kingdom, for more than a week. “ The
effect of this stroke,” says Alison, in his history, “ was soon
felt through the whole North of Germany.” In the same
year, Tetterborn, another Cossack leader, captured Ham-
burg by a similar feat. Platoff, again, with 7,000 Cossacks
and Austrian Horse from Bohemia, encircling the French
upon the Elbe, attacked and routed, far in their rear at
Altenburg, the French cavalry under Le Fevre-Desnouettes.
American War of Secession, 1862-65.—General J. E. B.
Stuart, of the Confederate Army, who, leaving Darksville on
9th October, 1862 (Plate XLa.), and crossing the Potomac
at McCoy’s Ford, captured Chambersburg, and thence by
a series of rapid marches, completely circled round the
Federal army under McClellan, severing all his lines of
communication, and finally recrossed the Potomac on the
12th October at White’s Ford with a loss of three men!
The Confederate force consisted of three small brigades,
under Brigadier-General Wade Hampton, Colonel W. H.
F. Lee and Colonel W. E. Jones, respectively, numbering
1,800 of all ranks, and a battery of four guns under Major
John Pelham. A distance of 145 mi’as was covered in 76
hours, and a portion of the distance—viz., Chambersburg
to Hyatt’s Town, 65 miles—in 20 hours. So successful was
this raid that something near akin to a panic seized the
money market at New York, and a momentary paralysis of
uncertainty made itself felt throughout the whole Federal
army, and there further resulted a temporary collapse of
the Federal cavalry, which had wasted itself in a fruitless
effort to pursue. Yet Stuart’s cavalry, so little affected
were they by their splendid exploit, contested the advance






of the Federal infantry, when, some days subsequently, in
overwhelming numbers they crossed the James,
This great raid of Stuart’s during the American war does
not stand alone, and if space admitted descriptions might
be given of Forrest’s numerous Confederate raids in
Tennessee; of Grierson’s great raid from La Grange,
Tennessee, in the North, across the State of Mississippi to
Baton Rouge in Louisiana, in the South, 1,000 miles in 24
days—a feat which paved the way to thecapture of Vicksburg,
and the seizure by the Federal troops of the Mississippi, the
great highway of the Western States. A description might
be given of Sheridan’s final exploit with his three divisions
of cavalry, which, by what General Grant called “ Sheridan’s
throttling process,” cut the line of retreat of the Con-
federate General Lee by a long sweeping movement, and
brought about the closing surrender and collapse of the
Confederate cause at Appomatox Court House in April,
1865.
Turco-Bussian War, 1877-78.—The advance of General
Gourkho across the Balkans with a mixed force of cavalry
and lightly-equipped riflemen, in July, 1877, may be cited
as the first attempt by European troops subsequent to the
American War to develop a similar “strategical influence
upon the campaign.”
Egyptian Campaign , 1882.—Coming nearer home, we may
quote the strategical march of Major-General Sir Drury
Lowe’s Cavalry division in 1882 (Plate XLb.), which captured
Cairo by a coup-de-main and at one blow arrested all the
further bloodshed and all the loss of life which would
else have followed upon the rout of the Egyptian troops by
Lord Wolseley at Tel-el-Kebir. The bold strategical march
of the Cavalry division ordered by Lord Wolseley is the
most complete illustration of the value of the strategical
operations of Mounted Troops.


The following Mounted Troops took part in the foregoing
march, viz. :
( Household Cavalry.
4th Dragoon Guards.
(7th „
( 2nd Bengal Cavalry.
< 6th „ „
(13 th „
N. Battery, A. Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery.
Mounted Infantry.
Mounted Detachment Royal Engineers.
17th Company Army Service Corps.
This force marched from Kassassin at 8 p.m., 12th
September, 1882, took part in the battle of Tel-el-Kebir at
daylight, the 13th, and marching soon after captured the
citadel of Cairo, at 8 p.m., 14th September.
A strategical march of 70 miles in 48 hours.
South African Campaign, 1899-1901.—Illustrations of
the value of mounted troops for strategical operations
would be incomplete without allusion to the brilliant
results achieved in the South African War, 1899-1900, by
the action of the mounted troops, which were utilised by
Field Marshal Earl Roberts in a similar manner.
The forced march of the cavalry division under Lieut. -
General French at the commencement of the operations in
February, 1900, not only struck across the line of communi-
cations of the enemy on the Modder, but relieved Kimberley,
and by a rapid march thence subsequently closed the
encircling movements so ably planned which terminated in
the surrender of Cronje and 4,000 men at Paardeburg.
In the subsequent advance under Lord Roberts from
Bloemfontein, upon Pretoria, in May and June, the cavalry
division and the mounted troops- operating upon the west


and in advance of the main army successively turned all
the positions of the enemy, and prevented his making any
attempt at any serious defence of the many and successive
excellent defensive positions which presented themselves.
Subsequently, in July, in the Eastern Transvaal the same
troops, in a similar manner, turned by a rapid flanking
movement three difiicult and very defensible rivers, forcing
the enemy to retire in front of Lord Roberts’ army almost
without firing a shot, and subsequently occupied Middelberg.
Strategical operations or raids cannot, however, be lightly
or hastily undertaken. They require, as has been pointed
out, a vast amount of careful organisation and arrangement
beforehand. Supplies have to be located in the territory
through which the march is to be conducted, and this can
only be done by means of reconnoitring parties and spies.
The troops themselves and their horses require also to be
in first-rate condition, bard and inured to war. It is
hardly necessary to add that the difficulties are far less
when the operations are undertaken in a country and among
a population which is fairly well known and friendly as in
the case of principal raids in the American War.

Bloemfontein to Pretoria from May Ist to June, 1900,

(B.)
Sec. 2. Escorts for Convoys ( Stores , Baggage,
Ammunition, Prisoners, &ci).
The strength of escorts for stores, baggage, ammunition,
prisoners, &c., must always depend upon the length of the
train to be escorted, and the circumstances of the occasion.
The following instructions are, therefore, only intended as
a general guide for the distribution of the different parties
of such escorts ; and the officer in command must always
make his arrangements so as best to suit the circumstances
of the moment.
All such escorts must invariably be preceded by an
advanced and followed by a rear guard, upon the principles
laid down in Part IV., B, the strength of which will vary
according to circumstances and the number of men employed
on the escort.
It is necessary to send out flanking patrols in order to
watch the flanks of the column, which should be taken from
the advanced and rear guards, so as to leave the main body
of the escort intact. The position of the officer in command
of the escort is where he can best superintend the movement
of the whole body.
The escort must always conform to the pace at which the
column to be escorted is proceeding, this pace being regulated
by the officer in charge of the transport. Waggons convey-
ing gunpowder or ammunition should never move at a more
rapid pace than a walk. Ammunition columns should never
halt in towns or in the vicinity of fires, and the escort
should not under any circumstances be allowed to smoke.
Escorts accompanying prisoners or ammunition always
march at Attention with rifles loaded.
In ordinary marches, the baggage escort or guard is often
composed of the dismounted men accompanying a regiment


Their cloaks and valises are carried in the baggage waggons.
The officer in command must be mounted, and accompanied
by a mounted sergeant or corporal to assist him in his
duties.
A dismounted baggage escort or guard, if sufficiently
strong, is formed as followed ;
(a) A portion immediately in front of the leading waggon
of the column.
(b) Two men per waggon, one on each side to give assistance
when required to the waggons, apply the skid, scotch
the wheels when halted on an incline, &c. These
men must not place their rifles on the waggons, or
hang on to the waggons in any way. During a long
march they should be relieved from time to time.
(c) The remainder, under a non-commissioned officer,
immediately in rear of the last waggon.
When the baggage of several regiments is marching
together in a general column, the baggage guard of each
regiment will be formed as above, and the men of the
baggage guards are to remain constantly with the waggons
of their respective regiments. No men are to fall out with-
out the permission of the officer commanding the baggage
guard, and officers in command of baggage guards or of escorts
to convoys must enforce strict discipline and an exact com-
pliance with all orders relative to the march of the column;
irregularities in connection with the march of a baggage
train may cause delays which will occasion the most serious
inconvenience to the troops. Officers employed on such
duties should invariably have with them a copy of all orders
relating to the march of the column, the route to be followed,
&c.
The distance to be preserved on the march between the
rear of one waggon and the horse’s heads of the next is


four yards. The waggons should not move at a faster pace
than a walk, except in very urgent cases.
(C.)
MARCHING.
Sec. 3. General Remarks.
The efficiency of mounted troops is in direct ratio to
their power of mobility, or in other words to the efficiency
of their horses. This can only be maintained by constant
practice in marching, and by observing certain fixed
principles.
The “ secret of war lies in the legs,” wrote one of
Napoleon’s ablest marshals, and it must be clearly under-
stood that the power of manoeuvre for strategical purposes,
so strongly commented upon in Part IV., depends entirely
upon the care, attention, and training which have been in
peace time devoted to the marching rapidly and for long
distances of bodies of mounted troops. There is no royal
road to success in this respect. Hard work, assiduous care
and a studied experience on the part of officers, and earnest
persevering zeal on the part of the men are the only
elements which can ensure a satisfactory result.
The first and most important consideration is a good and
properly fitted saddle. The saddle in ordinary civilian use is
unsuited to military requirements. The weight which the
soldier has necessarily to carry car not be distributed or
carried without detriment to the horse unless upon a specially
constructed saddle; without such a saddle it may be
taken for granted that it is practically impossible to
maintain any mounted troops efficient upon active service
in the field.
The greatest care should be taken before a march that
the saddlery is in proper order so far as circumstances
admit,


Horses should invariably be walked in going up or
down hill.
The marching columns should, when circumstances
admit, be in half sections, each man upon the outside of
the road ( i.e ., “Divide the Road”), thus allowing the
officers to pass freely up and down the column, and
allowing passage to traffic between the files.
The five most important points for officers to note
are;
(1) That each man sits square and steady on his horse.
(2) That no man quits his stirrups.
(3) That no buckle, strap, or portion of the rolled blanket
or cloak touches the ridge bone of the horse behind,
and that the front of the saddle is well above the
crest and withers in front, and that no strap or
article which may chafe or injure be allowed to get
under the saddle.
(4) That the saddle is properly girthed up and does not
oscillate.
(5) Horses are to be ridden on all four reins or upon the
hridoon or cheek reins only, but they are to be made
to “ ride ” up to their bits either at a walk or trot.
There will invariably be an officer, a non-commissioned
officer, and a sergeant-farrier or shoeing-smith with the
rear guard to all columns. The officer will be in charge of,
and be responsible for, all men and horses who fall out or
lose shoes. He will insure that men falling out do not
attempt to rejoin their squadrons or companies, but will
remain in rear of the column until the next halt.
Men whose horses require to be re-shod or who for any
cause are compelled to fall out and remain behind the rear-
guard will rejoin at a steady pace.

&c.
30 minutes —2-J miles.
(b.) Second Hour.
30 minutes—2-| miles.
30 minutes—3J miles.
Tong halt for half an hour and small feed.
In the case of horses which are untrained to trot the
canter is permissible.
The variations of the marching must be adapted to cir-
cumstances, such as state of the roads, the physical nature
of the country, and the condition of the horses; but the
general principles indicated in the above routine for march-
ing will be invariably observed.
The steadiness and regularity of pace is an all-essential
factor in a successful march. The pace must be so regu-
lated that the rear of the column can keep up without


quickening the pace. In turning corners, or in passing
obstacles or obstructions in the road, the pace of the front
of a column must be slackened to prevent the rear having
to close up at a quickened pace. The walk will be 4 miles
an hour, and the trot 9 miles an hour or less according to
the size and power of the horses. The trot is the pace at
which mounted troops can move at a quickened rate with
the least detriment to the horse’s condition, and with least
chance of causing saddle galls.
At a slow trot, if properly carried out, the horseman
should support the whole weight of his body upon the
inside of his thighs, and the soles of his feet resting in the
stirrups. He should never allow the body during the trot
to touch the actual seat of his saddle ; leaning forward, he
will in this manner relieve his horse’s back of the weight
of his body, except so far as it is evenly distributed over
the side bars of the saddle resting upon the ribs.
By careful attention to the principles above indicated,
and by constant care, forced marches of from 40 to 50 miles
may be made for short periods, without serious detriment
to the efficiency of horses or men.
In general it may be calculated that mounted troops
should march at the rate of about 5 miles an hour including
all halts.
The last 2 miles or so of a day’s march should always be
traversed at a walk, so as to bring the horses in cool.
Sec. 5. Buies to be Observed,
1. Halts. —-The average rate of marching, including the
short halt, given in the routine of marching, should be 6
miles per hour.
Officers will mark beforehand upon their maps the points
on the road which the parties under their charge should
reach at the end of each hour, and so far as is possible
M.S.M. m


arrange for the prolonged halts to take place at suitable
places on or near the road. By these means accurate time
can be kept in covering long distances, and an evenness of
pace with proportionate distance is insured.
It will be noted that by the routine laid down in Sec. 4
the horse is relieved of the weight of the man and his arms
for a quarter of an hour in each hour, and the free circula-
tion of the blood is thus allowed into the skin of the back
under the saddle—one of the surest preventatives of sore
backs.
There should be a half-hour’s halt, the “ long halt,” after
every 2 hours’ marching. In a prolonged march after 4
hours the horses should be fed and the men have dinners,
or a meal of bread and cheese.
Every opportunity should be taken during a march of
allowing horses to graze, or nibble grass during halts.
2. Marching on Foot. —ln marching on foot the bridoon
or cheeh reins should be passed over the horse’s head and
led in half sections, the men upon the inside of their horses,
i.e., near and off sides respectively, and the horses close to
the outer edge of the road on either side, i.e., “Divide the
Road ” ; stirrups and leathers being crossed over the flaps
of the saddle. The rate of marching on foot should be at
least 4 miles an hour, and the horses and men be kept
locked up, i.e., 4 feet from head to croup
3. Feeding Horses on the March. —Horses’ stomachs are
small in proportion to the size of their bodies and food
requirements : it is, therefore, most advisable that, if pos-
sible, at each, i.e., half-hour’s, halt, they should be first
watered, and then, if possible, a small feed or a little hay
should be given.
4. Watering Horses. —There is no operation which requires
more care, attention, and forethought than the watering of


a considerable number of horses. A careful and organised
arrangement for watering must be made before the arrival
of the column, or horses will be badly watered, and much
valuable time lost.
Upon approaching the proposed watering-place, an officer
should be sent forward to ascertain the most suitable means
for watering, and the formation best adapted to the ap-
proaches to, or situation of, the watering-place. A canvas
bucket is supplied as a part of the cavalry soldier’s equip-
ment in some armies, which enormously facilitates the
watering, and enables horses to be watered more rapidly,
and without regard to the approaches to, or situation of, the
watering-place.
If a watering-place is available on the road, the horses
should be watered a mile or two from their destination.
Horses should be watered slightly, whenever possible,
especially in hot climates.
In tropical climates, or hot weather, the nostrils and
mouth should be wiped and moistened with a wet sponge,
kept for that purpose in the wallets, when it is impracti-
cable to water.
5. Special Duties and Discipline on Line of March. —■
There is no occasion on which the discipline of a regiment
is more tried, nor on which the attention and vigilance of
every officer in maintaining order and regularity are more
especially requisite, than upon the line of march. Officers
must be careful to preserve the compact order of a column
of route by not allowing irregular distances, straggling or
falling out, except during the periodical halts.
In the case of ordinary marches, unless under exceptional
circumstances or in very hot weather, it is not advisable
that mounted troops should march at a very early hour. It
is always desirable that time should be given for the men
to breakfast, and the horses to feed well before starting.


All parties of mounted troops should invariably march
off at “ Attention.” The commanding officer will afterwards
use his discretion in allowing the party to march at ease.
But before arrival at the destination, and always in passing
through towns, the party must be called to attention, and
arms must be drawn.
The ordinary length of a day’s march for mounted troops
may be reckoned at from 15 to 20 miles, but of course on
active service, or even in cases of emergency in time of
peace, this distance may often have to be considerably
increased. Provided the pace is not unduly hurried, the
more quickly a march is completed, under ordinary circum-
stances, the better it will be both for man and horse.
6. Billeting. —lf billeted in a town the time at which the
saddles are to be taken off should be announced and an
alarm post fixed by the officer in command of the party
before the men are dismissed to their billets. Xo officer
should leave the parade until the men are told off to their
billets and the alarm post notified.
7. Inspection of Horses. —The squadron officers must
visit the whole of the stables in which their horses are
billeted. Troop parades also will be arranged by them
when necessary.
If a swelling or heat is noticed on a horse’s back and no
skin is broken, the most simple remedy to adopt is to put
over it a cloth wetted with salt and water, the cloth being
kept on with the surcingle and a pad of straw. The mix-
ture should not be made too strong in salt. If the skin is
broken cold water only should be used. In bad cases of
sore backs veterinary advice should, if possible, be obtained.
All officers should have sufficient acquaintance with the
management of horses to be able to treat ordinary cases of
sore backs or other simple ailments on their own responsi


bility. The panels must be carefully brushed and dried ;
saddle blankets, numnahs, should be beaten lightly and also
dried.
8. Arms. —In billets, when on the march, all arms should
be removed from the stables and taken with the men to
their rooms. When marching in disturbed districts in aid
of the civil power, the bridles should also be similarly
taken from the stables and kept in the personal charge of
the men.
(D.)
TRANSPORT BY RAIL AND BY SEA.
Section 6.
1. Transport by Rail. —lt is essential that in all move-
ments by rail the utmost order and regularity should prevail.
Silence will be rigorously enforced. The actual details as
regards the formation of the troops and the manner in
which horses and men are entrained will depend upon local
circumstances, such as the size of the station, and the posi-
tion of the train, etc. Careful arrangements should be
made in conjunction with the railway authorities and orders
issued beforehand.
The discipline and general efficiency of mounted troops
are quickly gauged by the silence, rapidity, and good order
in which they entrain and detrain.
For detailed instructions, vide the King’s Regulations
and Orders for the Army.
2. Transport by Sea. —Detailed instructions as regards
the embarkation, disembarkation, and the duties on board
ship will be found in the King’s Regulations and Orders
for the Army, which should be carefully studied by the
staff and squadron officers. Detailed instructions for the
fittings of horse transports are to be found in the Regula-
tions for His Majesty’s Transport Service.


Standing orders—printed, if possible—should be drawn
up beforehand and published, so that all ranks may
thoroughly understand the routine of embarkation and the
duties on board ship. The health of men and horses, the
comfort and the efficiency of all must depend, in large
measure, upon the good order and regularity which is main-
tained during the voyage.
(E.)
CROSSING RIVERS.
Section. 7.
1. Fording. —The selection of a ford and the crossing of
rivers with mounted troops are operations requiring much
experience and oare.
If the fords are in any respect deep and dangerous, the
bits should be removed from the horses’ mouths, and the
men warned to disengage their feet from their stirrups,
being at the same time reminded of the principles necessary
if required to swim. It may sometimes be advisable to
station a few expert swimmers and a rope at or below the
ford.
The following depths are fordable :
For infantry, 3 feet.
For cavalry, 4 feet.
Waggons containing ammunition, 2 feet 4 inches.
Gravelly bottoms are best, sandy bottoms are bad, as the
sand gets stirred up, and the depth of water thus increases.
Fords should be clearly marked by long pickets driven
into the river bed above and below the ford, their heads
being connected by a strong rope. It is well to mark the
pickets in order that any rise of the water may be at once
evident,


The depth of a river is generally most uniform in straight
parts; at bends the depth will generally be greater at the
concave bank, and less at the convex.
For this reason a river which is not anywhere fordable
straight across maybe found passable in a slanting direction
between two bends.
In the absence of fords the passage must be effected
either by swimming, by ferrying, or by the construction of
a bridge.
2. Swimming. —The instructions for swimming horses
will be found in Part 11,, B, Sec. 10.
It may be possible to arrange a flying bridge, a raft, or
procure boats for the purpose of conveying the men, their
saddlery, and kits. In this case the horses must be either
driven into the water and forced to swim across, or they
may be led by their bridoons only, and then towed by the
men in the boats.
No opportunities should be lost of practising men and
horses in this very important part of their military training.
3. Ferrying. —lnstructions for the construction of rafts
suitable for ferrying horses over rivers are given in the
“ Manual of Elementary Field Engineering.”
A raft capable of carrying 13 horses can be constructed
of four piers, each consisting of sevmi (100-gallon) casks,
bearing a platform 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, provided
with a rail removable at the two ends, but firmly fixed at
the sides.
The horses should be ridden on to the raft along a road-
way (supported if necessary by piers) which need not be
wider than 6 feet in the clear, but must be long enough to
reach from the shore to water of sufficient depth to float
the raft.


As each horse is placed in its position across the raft, the
rider will dismount and stand to his horse’s head.
The raft should be guided by a cable stretched from shore
to shore, led through two snatch-blocks attached to the raft
and can be hauled across by men or horses.
On reaching the further side, the horses should be led
ashore.
4. Rules to he Observed by Troops in passing over
Pontoon and other Temporary Bridges. —When large bodies
of troops have to pass a river, and circumstances permit,
three bridges should be made, one for infantry, one for the
mounted troops, and a third for artillery and waggons which
accompany the force. This does not apply to ambulance
waggons, &c., accompanying regiments. Columns of
infantry, artillery, waggons, and cavalry should not be
mixed together in passing a bridge.
Mounted troops will, as a rule, cross in single file or half
sections, but never at a faster pace than the walk. All horses
should be mounted when crossing the bridge, and none should
be led across.
Wheel carriages of all kinds with trained horses, are to
cross fully horsed ; with unsteady horses, carriages must be
passed over by hand.
Halting on a bridge is to be avoided. If it be absolutely
necessary to halt on a pontoon bridge, gun wheels must rest
as nearly as possible midway between two boats. Artillery
should cross at increased distances. If the bridge sways so
as to become very unsteady, the column must be halted and not
allowed to resume its movement until the swaying has ceased.
These rules apply to all suspension, military, spar, and
floating bridges.
Officers will incur grave responsibility if they cross a
bridge otherwise than in the way recommended by the
engineer officer in charge.


(F.)
ANNUAL FIELD TRAINING.
Sec. 8. General Remarks.
It is most desirable that each squadron should be put
through a consecutive and pre-arranged course of annual
training, no matter how short relatively the total period of
mobilisation or embodiment may be.
It is in the first place most important to maintain the
identity and the individuality of the squadron as an indepen-
dent unit, and in the second, it is most essential to ensure
instruction being given by the squadron officers themselves,
so that the principle “ of those who lead being those who
instruct ” shall invariably be upheld.
The following paragraphs give the outline of a system
which has been tried and proved to be moat successful. It
is hoped therefore that it may assist commanding officers to
draw up and carry out with the assistance of their squadron
leaders a connected course of training upon similar lines,
even if of short duration.
Every officer, N.C.0., and man should be present during
the days allotted for the training, the syllabus of which
should be published as long beforehand as possible, so that
officers, N.C. O.’s, and men may know the subjects in advance
upon which they will receive instruction, and prepare
themselves accordingly. The course should be connected,
and as far as possible continuous, but must necessarily vary
according to local circumstances.
Sec. 9. The Principles of the System of Annual
Field Training.
1. Squadron to he as Complete as Possible. —lt is probable
that there will be men who for various reasons are unable
to be present with their squadron for field training.


Officers commanding regiments and squadrons should, how-
ever, use all means in their power to have their squadrons
as complete as may be for each day’s instruction.
Officers commanding squadrons should be allowed to vary
the order of days laid down in the syllabus of instruction,
when special circumstances render variation desirable.
2. Duties of Officers at Training. —The instruction of the
men during the course of annual field training, both
practical and theoretical, will be conducted solely by the
officers of the squadron.
Officers should therefore by previous study of the special
subjects laid down for each day’s training be prepared to
impart the instruction required. The lectures will
especially require care and thought in their preparation,
and should be made as interesting as possible. In each
case lectures should be followed by catechising the N.0.0.’s
and men.
(3) Duties off Instructors and of Staff Sergeants Attached.
—lt is the duty of the instructional staff attached to units
to be present during this annual field training, and to
assist the squadron officers when called upon to do so.
They will bear constantly in mind that the instruction of
the unit at the annual field training is to be conducted
solely by the officers. They are responsible for the
preliminary and elementary training of the N.C.O.’s and
men before the course commences, under the direction of
the officer commanding, and their success will be gauged
by the standard reached by the N.C.O.’s and men under
their instruction.
It will be their duty under the officers commanding
squadrons to ensure that such men as may have been
absent from a previous day’s training receive instruction in
those subjects which have been missed by them during such


absence. Officers commanding squadrons should make
local arrangements for this retrospective instruction.
4. Supervision and Assistance by Senior Officers and
Adjutants. The officers commanding regiments, the
majors, or the adjutants, will, as far as possible, personally
supervise the squadrons under training, and lend active
assistance when required. The adjutants especially will be
ready to render assistance or advice to the officers com-
manding squadrons when imparting instruction.
5. Annual Training not to he Elementary. —The annual
field training proposed above should not be “ Elementary ”
or “ Recruit ” training. All elementary instruction should
be conducted as preliminary to the annual field training.
For instance, it is not contemplated that the rifle exercise
or the firing exercise should be included in annual field
trainings.
6. Returns of Attendance and Proficiency. —A special
form of squadron field training return has been approved,
in which officers commanding squadrons will give a com-
plete nominal roll of the squadron, stating against each
man the days of attendance, and the proficiency attained
during the course, together with the result of the final
examination.
In addition, a special report at tl e termination of the
course is made of the N.0.0.’5, and of their individual
proficiency.
The Officer Commanding regiment should, in forwarding
these returns, submit the name of any officer, non-com-
missioned officer, or man, who, in his opinion, it is undesir-
able to retain in their respective positions by reasons of
non-attendance, want of knowledge of their duties,
inefficiency as soldiers, or other cause.


7. Examination at the Termination oj the Annual Field
Training. —Upon the last day of the training an examina-
tion of the squadron will be conducted by the State Com-
mandant, or by an officer representing him.
At the termination of the examination the inspecting officer
will personally record the character for proficiency of each
non-commissioned officer or man, in the column allotted for
that purpose in the annual field training return.
The inspecting officers should, in considering the recorded
opinion of the officers commanding units, have with them
the officers commanding squadrons, the troop leader, the
squadron sergt.-major, and troop sergeants, with a view to
conferring with them when necessary.
They should base their confirming opinion, when any
question arises, by the combined opinion of those officers
and non-commissioned officers under whom the soldier
in question has been directly serving.
Inspecting officers should rely upon the opinion of
officers commanding units in the case of such men
whose civil duties do not admit of their having been
present upon every occasion during the training. It may
happen that a good and valuable soldier is, through no
fault of his own, prevented from attending regularly during
the course of instruction, and may even be unable to
be present at the examination upon its conclusion.
8. Report on Officers and Staffi Sergeants. —At the final
inspection alluded to in para. 7, the officer conducting the
examination should furnish a special report stating each
officer’s zeal and ability, judging thereof very much from
the manner and success with which they have imparted
instruction to their men, and of the general efficiency of
their squadrons and troops.
An opinion of the value of officers will to a very large
degree be formed from this report.


A similar report will be furnished upon the Instructional
Staff' attached to the squadrons, which, to a large extent,
will similarly testify as to the efficiency or otherwise of
such instructors.
These reports should be retained by officers commanding
regiments and corps for future reference.
9. Higher Tactical Training. —Squadron training should
be followed subsequently by regimental training, which
should be similarly and methodically drawn up beforehand.
By the system thus indicated each squadron and regiment
will have been trained connectedly, continuously, and upon
one general plan. The higher and all-important tactical
training of larger units, such as brigade and division, can
thus be carried out with satisfactory results, during any
camp of continuous training that it may be possible to hold.
Sec. 10. Recruiting.
Recruiting. —Officers commanding regiments and corps
should, so far as local circumstances admit, arrange
that the recruiting of their squadrons and units take place
at such times as to admit of the recruits who have com-
pleted their elementary instruction as such being subse-
quently included in the annual field training as drilled
soldiers.
It will be found that the section system, if well carried
out, will prove the very best and most effective recruiting
agency. Sections should be recruited and organised from
given sub-districts, villages, or clusters of homesteads.
Section leaders should be held responsible that vacancies
are filled by eligible men and by the right class of horse.
The important principle of decentralisation is further deve-
loped by these means.


(G.)
INSTRUCTION IN DETACHED DUTIES.
Sec. 11. Hints and Suggestions for System of Instruction.
The following suggestions are published for guidance with
the object of indicating the lines upon which the instruction
of squadrons and regiments in reconnaissance duties and in
framing reports, &c., should be conducted.
It is obvious that local circumstances and varying condi-
tions will prevent any uniform system of instruction being
carried out and make any hard and fast rules impracticable.
Commanding officers of regiments assisted by their 2nd
in command and adjutants must arrange as best they may
for the instruction of their officers ; and the squadron leaders
and troop officers in their turn for the instruction of their
N.C. officers and men as circumstances will admit.
Officers. —An officer of mounted troops should lose no
opportunity of training himself to observe ground from a
military point of view, to realise its capabilities in relation
to the working of troops.
Every officer should learn how to make practical recon-
naissance reports, illustrated by rough sketches, upon :
1. A road.
2. A position for an outpost line, for defence, &c.
3. A section of a river, railway, &c.
N.G. Officers and Men. —Every N.C. officer and section
leader should be a capable patrol leader. He should be
able to instruct the men in his charge in all that is required
of them on detached duty.
Every N.C. officer and section leader, before he can be
considered fit to be detached from his squadron on ordinary
patrol duty, should be able :
1. To read a military map, and understand the conven-
tional signs.


2. To measure distances on a map by scale.
3. To write out by reference to a map clear directions
sufficient to enable a man to find his way from one
place to another.
4. To identify villages, farms, hills, &c., shown on a map.
5. To find his way from one place to another in an un-
known part of the country by means of a map only.
6. To make a short but intelligible written report.
The men also should be trained what, and how, to observe,
and to be able to state concisely what they see ; they must
also be taught their duty as despatch riders, and to repeat
verbal messages.
Officers commanding squadrons are entirely responsible
for the instruction of their N.C. officers and men in the
above duties.
Theoretical Instruction. —The thinking power of N.C.
officers and men should be developed to the utmost by means
of lectures and theoretical instruction. Every opportunity
should be taken of explaining and discussing the duties of
mounted troops, especially the principles laid down in the
Preface and Part IY.
The squadron commander should arrange that his officers,
N.C. officers, and intelligent men ride owt in small parties
for the purpose of working out short practical problems and
schemes in advanced guard, outpost, and patrolling services
in relation to the varied circumstances of the actual ground.
Such exercises will tend to teach subordinate leaders how
best to apply military tactical requirements to ground.
Patrolling duty and patrol leading should next follow.
For this purpose subaltern officers should ride out with
small parties of N.C. officers and men, in order to instruct
them in their duties, and small patrols of four to six men
under a N.C. officer should be sent out on missions, which


should be clearly defined and in writing. The programme
should sufficiently indicate the route to be taken and the
nature of the reconnaissance required. The latter should
include the most varied object*, such as finding a position
for a picquet in a particular neighbourhood, with a view to
covering a certain section of ground ; reconnaissance of
localities with respect to capabilities of defence or for quar-
tering of troops ; whether defiles, bridges, and passages of
rivers are passable on certain routes, &c. Reports from
patrol commanders should be accompanied with small pencil
sketches, executed in the saddle.
Instruction in sketching, &c., should chiefly take the
form of enlarging an existing map before setting out, and
then filling in details.
Too much attention can be paid to neat draughtsmanship
indoors at the expense of rapidity and accuracy in the
field. Map-making ought certainly not to be the aim and
object of the course of instruction for R.C. officers in
reconnaissance.
Practical Exercises. —Two squadrons might be sent to
camps or villages, say 10 miles apart, and then take up a
line of outposts in opposition to one another. The com-
manding officer of the regiment should test and practice the
squadrons by means of schemes, each in turn, in outpost
and reconnoitring work.
Ability as a patrol leader and reconnoitrer should be con-
sidered one of the most necessary qualifications for a N.C.
officer to possess before promotion to the rank of sergeant.
Sec. 12. Staff Rides.
There is no better system than that termed a “Staff
Ride " in order to train mounted troops in reconnoitring
and screening duty.


The procedure is as follows :
A general and special idea of a thoroughly practical
character is prepared by the directing officer suitable to the
particular country over which the ride is to be conducted.
The scheme may be for one or for two or more days.
Skeleton officers’ patrols and contact squadrons are formed
by two or three officers or men either on horseback or on
bicycles. Similarly the advanced squadrons, supports, and
reserve are represented by a few officers and men, provided,
if possible, with small flags so as to indicate what they
represent, and their exact position.
The movements of the supposed enemy maybe conveyed by
means of messages prepared beforehand by the directing
officer, and sent to certain indicated spots, post-offices, farms,
or inns, a day or two previously. These messages will then
be called for by the officers’ patrols in accordance with the
orders given them by the directing officer, and opened.
The information contained in them will then be acted upon
by the patrols or transmitted to those concerned exactly as
would be done upon active service.
In this way a very useful and interesting system of
practical instruction can be carried out at little, if any,
expense.
The whole of those partaking in this exercise can at the
termination of the proceedings be directed to concentrate
at some particular point for an assumed attack or defence
of a position. The directing officer can then after hearing
the result from those concerned sum up the situation.


(H.)
MACHINE GUNS, THE TACTICAL USE AND
DISPOSITION OF.
Sec, 13. General Principles of their Employment.
The principles of the use of machine guns are generally
speaking those laid down for dismounted action. Vide
Part 1., E and G, also Part IY., D.
Machine guns will, as a rule, be attached to every mounted
force acting in the field. It is not, however, intended that
they should in any way supplant the action, nor is it supposed
that they can reduce the importance, of horse artillery.
The long range of field guns, and the moral and material
effect of their projectiles, must always maintain the value
of horse artillery in covering the movements of mounted
troops. The fire of machine guns, will, however, be an
important factor in all operations, and form a powerful
addition to the fire-power of a mounted force.
Every knoll or point of vantage which commands the
enemy’s position, but is too small for the occupation of
artillery, may be effectively utilised for the action of a
machine gun, and it is especially desirable to bring machine
guns into action at points which could not be made use
of by artillery.
The action of machine guns will be guided by different
general principles from those which apply to a horse artillery
battery. Machine guns take up little space, and when in
position present but small obstacles to the movements of the
mounted troops with which they are acting. Their range,
when compared with that of artillery, is limited, but they
have this special advantage ; they can be traversed upon a
wide arc when firing, and can thus sweep the whole front
of an opposing line with a continuous, rapid, and deadly
fire. They should, therefore, take up a position as near as


safety will permit to the front or flank of the enemy, from
which an effective fire can be maintained. They will at all
times form a valuable auxiliary to the firing line, and if
handled with dash and judgment will have important moral
advantages, especially in the defence. It is important that
they should be concealed from view as much as possible, as
this adds much to their moral effect.
On outpost, and other detached services, as well
as for the purpose of temporarily holding a position which
may have been gained by the mounted troops, for the pro-
tection of cantonments and bivouacs, and during a retreat,
their action will frequently be of the greatest assistance.
During an Action. —During the preparation for the attack,
machine guns should be pushed rapidly forward to as good
a position as possible, and should continue their fire until
the firing line or skirmishers pass them in the attack.
Machine guns must act in strict subordination to the
movements of the mounted troops; and, as their value
consists in the assistance which they can give to those
movements, they should not, except under peculiar circum-
stances, have any special escort. Positions should not be
taken up by them in which they are likely to be exposed
to sudden attack unsheltered by the force to which they are
attached.
Should the mounted troops by their operations take up a
position which it is important to hold, the guns must be at
once pushed forward to it. Their fire will go far to make
up for any want of infantry.
If an onslaught mounted has been made, or if a position
has been rushed, and the enemy is obliged to give way,
the machine guns should at once be pushed forward, and
be ready to support the pursuit, or to join in further opera-
tions by firing on any forward body which may seem
prepared to offer resistance.


The value of machine guns to mounted troops appears
almost greater after a repulse than after a successful
encounter. If they are properly handled in well-selected
positions, it should be very difficult for any pursuing cavalry
to push home its success without severe loss. Under
shelter of their fire, too, time may be gained for the arrival
of reserves or for the reoonsolidation of broken
squadrons. A machine gun, with its light equipment, can
always fall back so rapidly that it will generally be better
to leave it in action as long as possible, and until its preser-
vation makes retreat an absolute necessity.
CEREMONIAL.
Sec. 14. Parade Movements.
As little time as possible should be devoted to instruction
in ceremonial or parade movements. It will be found that
if a corps has been well and intelligently trained in drill
and manoeuvre, the parade movements will present little
real difficulty, provided that the staff and officers have
mastered the detailed instructions here given.
Posts op Officers, &c.
Commanding Officer in all Formations. —ln front of the
centre of the line or leading body, two horses’lengths in
advance of the leading officer or officers.
In marching and ranking past ia any formation, after
passing the saluting point, the commanding officer falls out
and places himself by the reviewing officer, except with the
regiment in line.
In case where there is a second in command, he will be
in rear of the regiment in all formations, and in marching
and ranking past he will be one horse’s length behind the
adjutant (half horse’s length when ranking past by single
file).


Adjutant in Marching Past. —ln all formations, one
horse’s length in rear of the serrefile on that flank of the
rear squadron which is the nearer to the saluting point.
In Ranking Past hy Single File.— Half horse’s length in
rear of the 4th squadron.
In Ranking Past hy Sections. —One horse’s length in rear
of the 4th squadron.
Squadron Commander in Marching, Trotting , and Gal-
loping Past by Squadrons or Squadron Column. —One
horse’s length in front of the troop leaders, opposite the
centre of his squadron or leading troop. In regiments
with standards, the leading squadron commander is one
horse’s length in front of the standard.
In Ranking Past hy Single File. —ln front of the squad-
ron, half a horse’s length in advance of the right troop
leader. In regimental parade movements, after passing the
saluting point the squadron commander falls out to the
right, and places himself on the right of the commanding
officer while his squadron is ranking past.
In Ranking Past hy Sections. —ln front of the squadron,
one horse’s length in advance of the inner troop leader.
Troop Leaders in Ranking Past hy Single File. —The
right troop leader half horse’s length in rear of the squadron
commander; the second troop leader half horse’s length in
rear of the right troop leader, and so on.
In Ranking Past by Sections. —The right troop leader is
one horse’s length in front of the inner file of the leading
section, the second troop leader at the same interval on the
left of the right troop leader, and so on.
Serrefiles.- — In Ranking Past hy Single File. —ln rear of
the squadron, half horse’s length from head to croup, officer
serrefiles in rear of non-commissioned officer serrefiles.


In Ranking Fast by Sections. —Forming the rear section
of the squadron, officers on the right.
Staff Officers. —In Line. —ln one rank at close files, on
the right of the adjutant, in line with the front rank, in the
order laid down for foot parade. After the inspection staff
officers will fall out, and place themselves in rear of the
inspecting officer at the saluting point.
Trumpeters and Band. —As a rule, during the parade
movements, the whole of the trumpeters will be formed
with the band, which in line in two ranks with the kettle-
drum one horse’s length in front of centre of front rank, is
posted on the right of the staff at one horse's length interval
from them.
If the band is not present, the whole of the trumpeters
or buglers will usually be formed in single rank on the right
of the staff officers, at one horse’s length interval from them.
If required to form up with their squadrons, trumpeters
will be in the rear ranks of their troops, except squadron
trumpeters, who will be posted as follows :
In Line and Column. —lnside the right (or senior)
squadron serrefile.
In Ranking Past by Single File and Sections. —ln rear
of the officers at the head of the squadron.
The commanding officer’s trumpeter is half horse’s length
to the flank and to the rear of that officer, on the flank
further away from the saluting point
Sec. 15. Inspection or Review of the Regiment.
The regiment is formed in line of squadron column
(except in the case of small bodies of less than one squadron,
when they will be formed in line), on the ground where the
reviewing officer is to be received. The parade may, if
ordered, be formed in line of half squadron column, i.e., the


2nd and 4th troops forming on the left of the Ist and 2nd
at column distance. It will be observed that the formation
of half squadron column gives two lines, and is in appearance
the same as that of cavalry in line with two ranks.
A point is marked about 150 yards in front of the centre,
at which the reviewing officer will generally take his station.
The march past will be in squadron column unless other-
wise ordered.
While the regiment remains stationary on the parade line
for the purpose of receiving the reviewing officer, squadron
commanders do not repeat the words of command until the
regiment is to be put in motion for marching past.
When the reviewing officer presents himself before the
centre, the command “ General Salute, Eyes Centre —
Carry Arms ”is given; the time is taken from the com-
manding officer, and the officers salute with their swords
and come down at the last motion to the position of the
salute. The band plays the first part of a slow march, or
trumpets sound, according to the rank of the reviewing
officer; after which the officers recover and carry their
swords with the commanding officer.
The reviewing officer then goes towards the right,
accompanied by the commanding officer, and the whole
remain steady while he passes along the regiment, the
band playing, or trumpets sounding until he leaves the line.
After the inspection of the ranks is completed, the
commanding officer gives the words “ Advance Arms,”
on which the officers slope swords and the serrefile officers
resume their places.
Marching Past.
On the general caution '‘March Past in Squadron
Column,” squadron commanders give the caution “ Sections
Right.”


On the command “ Walk” “ March,” the troops and band
wheel to the right, and the staff (except the adjutant) fall
out. The adjutant marks the passing line by placing a
serrefile non-commissioned officer or farrier at the point A,
PLATE XLI.
facing the regiment and outflanking it by about 40 yards,
and on a line about 4 yards in advance of the point at
which the reviewing officer will post himself. The two
markers place themselves at the points B and 0, about 60
yards on the right and left of the centre, and dress by the
marker A and the adjutant, who posts himself at E, 12
yards outside that marker. Another serrefile non-com-
missioned officer or farrier places himself at_D, outflanking


the regiment by the same distance as the marker A. The
markers keep their arms at the Garry while the regiment
is marching past.
The distance between the markers A and B should be
sufficient to allow depth for the formation of the regiment
in mass, viz., about 70 yards in round numbers.
The band marches in front of the column. Each squadron
when it arrives opposite marker A, receives the command
“ Squadron, Left Wheel, Trot,” from its leader, and when
square, “ Forward, Walk.” He then directs his march on
marker A. Each squadron, when its leading sections
arrive within section distance of the alignment at A,
receives from the squadron leader the words “ Sections,
Left.”
When the leading troop of each squadron arrives at the
marker B, the squadron leader gives the command “ Carry
Arms,” “Eyes Right," on which the troops dress by the
right, and continue to do so until opposite marker 0. The
serrefiles dress by the right. While passing from Bto C
it is the duty of the man on the flank of each troop which
is the nearer to the saluting point to keep the flank exactly
upon the line of markers.
The band (or trumpeters, when there is no band), 6
horses’ lengths in front of the commanding officer, com-
mences to play immediately after the leading squadron has
wheeled on to the passing line at A and, after passing the
reviewing officer, it wheels to the left, clears to the flank of
the column, then wheels to the left about so as to take up
a position opposite to the saluting point, and plays while
the regiment is passing. It remains in this position until
the conclusion of the parade movements.
The officers, when they arrive within 10 yards of the
reviewing officer, salute ; the squadron and troop leader of
the leading troop of the Ist squadron take the time from


the commanding officer ; the troop leaders of the leading
troops of the other squadrons from the squadron com-
mander. Serrefile officers, if more than one, take the time
from the officer on the right of their rank. At 10 yards
beyond the saluting point the officers “ recover ” and
“ carry ” their swords.
When each squadron arrives at marker C, the squadron
commander gives the command “ Advance Arms.’’ “ Eyes
Front. ”
Each squadron on arriving at marker D receives from its
leading troop leader the words “ Number Troop, Left
Wheel.” The rear troops of the leading squadron will after
completing the wheel at D, trot up and regain their interval
from the leading troop ; in a similar manner, each squadron
will, in turn, trot up and recover its interval from the
squadron in front.
After the rear troop has completed its wheel at D, the
commanding officer may (unless acting with cavalry) halt
and go “ Sections About ” —‘‘ Leaders Change,” and when
facing in the reverse direction he can rank past if desired.
If, however, he is acting with cavalry, as soon as the rear
troop has wheeled at marker D, the commanding officer
gives the word “ Trot,” and the column moves round the
square, each troop wheeling at the several angles, until the
leading troop approaches marker A, when the commanding
officer gives the word “To the Halt,” “ Mass or Quarter
Column to the Left.” The commanding officer can then, if
desired, rank past by single file or sections or carry out what-
ever instructions may be given.
In ranking past by single file or by sections the same
principles are observed. The officers, &c., who precede the
squadron, take up their positions for ranking past in front
of (he leading section. On the commanding officer’s
caution “ Rank Past by Sections ( Single File),” the com


raander of the Ist squadron immediately gives the words
“Garry Arms” (on’ which the officers carry swords),
“ Sections (Single File)Right (or Left).” “ Leading Section
(Single File) Left (or Right) Wheel.” The officers, &c., at
the same time take up their positions for ranking past.
On the word “ March,” the leading section wheels to the
left (or right) and advances to the front, the remainder
follow in succession in the same manner, wheeling at the
same spot as the leading section wheeled, the filesextending
as soon as they have made their second wheel.
The distance from head to croup and the interval from
knee to knee are each a horse’s length, each section dressing
to the right and covering from the front.
The other squadrons in succession, as it comes to their
turn, receive the same words of command from their com-
manders, and advance in a similar manner.
Ranking past by sections is usually to be executed at the
trot, in which case officers do not salute.
At marker D (or A) each section wheats to the left (or
right), and moves forward at the trot ; the command
Squadron Column to the Front,” “ Leading Squadron, To
the Halt, Form Squadron Column ” being given when the
leading section has moved up the depth of the column after
wheeling off the passing line.
In ranking past by sections and single file a distance of
four horses’ lengths will be preserved between squadrons.
If it is desired to trot past, the caution is given “ Trot
past in Squadron Column.” The squadrons move off as
described above.
When trotting or galloping past the troops look to
the front. The regiment can then, if desired, gallop past.
This movement is generally performed in the reverse
direction to the other parade movements, by entering the
passing line at marker I), For this purpose the front of the


column is reversed by the wheel about of sections. The
direction of the head of the column, after trotting past, is
changed to the left, and when the column has arrived on
the original parade line the commanding officer gives the
word “ Sections About ” —“ Leaders Change” followed by
“ Gallop Past in Squadron Column,” “ Gallop .”
The officers will carry their swords as usual, but the men
will keep their arms at the advance.
As soon as all the squadrons have wheeled off the passing
line at A, the commanding officer gives the command
“ Trot.”
The regiment, on arriving on the original parade line, is
again formed into line of squadron column, or otherwise in
accordance with the original formation.
The markers, on the conclusion of the parade movements,
rejoin the regiment as soon as the line is halted.
Fobmation for Review in Mass or in Mass op
Squadron Quarter Column.
It may sometimes be necessary to form a regiment for
review in Mass, or in Mass of Squadron Quarter Column.
The staff, except the adjutant, will be in rear of the
centre at a horse’s length distance; the band three horses’
lengths in rear of the staff. If required, the staff and band
may be formed on the right, at the same intervals as when
the regiment is in line.
Before the reviewing officer arrives on the ground, the
commanding officer gives the command “ Officers to the
Front” “ March," on which the squadron officers come to
the front at the trot, and take post at one horse’s length in
front of their squadron.
The staff officers, if present, remain in their original
places, and do not come to the front.


The line of officers is dressed, from the flank towards
which the dressing is, by the second in command or adju-
tant.
The reviewing officer is received as described for a regi-
ment in line.
On the conclusion of the inspection of the ranks, the
commanding officer gives the commands “ Advance Arms,”
“ Officers take Post,” “ March,” when the officers in suc-
cession move to the rear at the trot.
Advance in Review Order.
If the regiment is to advance in review order at the con-
clusion of a review, it will be formed in line of squadron
columns in mass, or in mass of squadron quarter columns
as required on the original parade line, the band being
formed in rear of the centre at three horses’ lengths
distance from the serrefile rank. The commanding officer
gives the caution “ Officers to the Front,” “ Advance in
Review Order,” on which the officers move to the front and
take post as described above. The commanding officer
then gives the words “ Carry Arms,” “ Walk — March,”
officers carrying swords on the word “ March” on which
the regiment will advance by the squadron of direction
until within 40 or 50 yards of the reviewing officer, when
it will be halted and receive the command “ General Salute,”
“Eyes Centre” the officers saluting and the band playinginthe
same way as when receiving the reviewing officer. During
the advance, the band commences to play on the command
“March,” and ceases on the command “Halt.” After the
officers have recovered and carried swords with the com-
manding officer, the regiment will wait for orders.
The commanding officer will subsequently give the com-
mand “Advance Arms,” and all officers resume their places.
In the advance in review order, squadron commanders
only repeat the command “ Halt.”


Sec. 16. The Brigade and Division.
The bands will be massed 25 yards in rear of the centre,
standing in the same order as their respective regiments.
When formed on parade for inspection the Division Com-
mander is ten horses’ lengths in front of the line of
Brigadiers. The latter the same distance in front of com-
manding officers. Staff officers two horses’ lengths in rear
of them, one horse’s length interval from one another.
Gallopers one horse’s length in rear of staff officers, except
when the staff, including gallopers, does not exceed four
officers in number, in this case the staff will form in one
line.
If the brigade is formed for the review or inspection of a
royal personage or superior officer, on the latter presenting
himself, the Brigadier will give the command “ Attention ,”
“ Royal (or General ) Salute,” ‘'Carry Arms,” the time being
taken by commanding officers from him. The officers will
have been brought to the front before the royal personage
or superior officer is received. If the latter inspects the
troops, the Brigadier will accompany him during the inspec-
tion, but commanding officers will remain at their posts.
The brigade staff while passing down the line will precede
the Brigadier by two horses’lengths. Gallopers one horse’s
length in front of the staff. If the Divisional Commander
is the inspecting officer, his staff will follow that of the
Brigadier at two horses’ length distances.
In the case of a division, the directions given in the pre-
ceding paragraph will be observed generally, Brigadiers
accompanying the Divisional Commander during his inspec-
tion of their several brigades, but brigade staffs and com-
manding officers will stand fast; if, however, the troops are
inspected by a royal personage or superior officer, the
Brigadiers will remain at their posts. While passing down


the line during the inspection by the Divisional Commander,
the divisional staff will precede him at two horses’ lengths
distance, in the following order :
D.A.Q.M.G.
Gallopers (if present).
A.D.C. A.D.C.
D. A. A.G. A. A.G.
C.
When a brigade or division has been directed to form up
for inspection, a squadron of one regiment is named as the
squadron of direction, the two markers of that regiment
take post outside the points where the right and left of the
squadron of direction will stand when at Order, and the
markers of the other regiments mark the points where the
right and left flanks of their respective regiments will
stand, dressing upon the markers of the base regiment. In
the absence of the staff officer, the adjutant of the regiment
furnishing the base squadron will, as on all similar occasions,
place the base marker and superintend the dressing.
The march past will usually be conducted in the same
order as is laid down for the single regiment, regiments
moving off in succession. When marching past in any order
of formation, column distance will be kept between regiments
and brigades ; in ranking past, the distance between them
will be 8 horses’ lengths.
The intervals between the markers, who will be posted as
during the parade movements of the regiment, must be
regulated to suit the ground and the number of troops on
parade. When two regiments are to march past, the
markers A and B are furnished by the Ist regiment, 0 and
Dby the 2nd regiment; when there are more than two
regiments, the markers A and D are furnished by the
flank regiments, B and C by the regiment or regiments in
the centre of the line.


When the markers move out or on the order of the staff
officer, the bands will trot through the nearest interval,
and form in line at marker B, ready for marching past and
awaiting the order to advance from the staff officer.
While on the passing line, the brigade-majors and aides-
de-camp are two horses’ lengths in front of their brigadiers,
and at one horse’s length interval from each other, the
gallopers (if present) being one horse’s length in front of
the staff officers. Brigadiers are two horses’ lengths in
front of the commanding officers of their leading regiments.
Officers salute as in the parade movements of the regiment.
When marching past the Divisional Commander, Briga-
diers fall out after saluting and place themselves on his
right while their brigades are passing, their aides-de-camp
and trumpeters accompanying them.
If the division is reviewed by an officer senior to the
commander, the latter marches past two horses’ length in
front of the staff of the leading brigade, being preceded at
two horses’ lengths by his staff, who ride at one horse’s
length interval in the order detailed. In this case the
divisional commander alone falls out, accompanied by an
aide-de-camp and the trumpeter.
The staff officers at the head of the column follow the
bands at sufficient distance to ensure their clearing their
front on wheeling off the passing lino. The bands wheel to
the left after passing the saluting point, wheel again, and
form facing the reviewing officer, at a sufficient distance
from the passing line to allow the troops to march past in
the order of formation required.
Preparatory to ranking past by sections, regiments will
usually form in column of masses or quarter column at
marker B, but this order of formation may be modified to
suit the ground.


In ranking past by sections, the divisional commander
will be in front of the head of the column, preceded by his
staff officers, who will be formed in sections, as far as
possible, at one horse’s length distance and interval. This
applies also to brigadiers and their staffs. The staff of the
leading brigade will follow at two horsestlengths in rear of
the divisional commander, and the commanding officer of
the leading regiment of each brigade will follow the briga-
dier at a similar distance.
While passing down the line, during the inspection of
the ranks, the trumpeters of general and commanding
officers will ride together in rear of the procession.
After galloping past, the bands will at once clear the
front at the trot, and move to the position indicated by the
staff officer. The troops will usually form line of squadron
column facing the saluting point, or, if the space is restricted,
line of masses or quarter columns can be formed.
(K.)
GUARDS.
Sec. 17. General Rules.
1. When guards turn out they will fall in with arms at the
slope. When the guard is commanded by an officer, he will
be three paces in front of the centre of the guard, other
officers will take post as in line ; when by a non-commis-
sioned officer, he will fall in on the right of the guard.
Whenever a guard of honour forms up, the commander
will be three paces in front of the second file from the
right, or, in a confined space, from the flank by which the
personage for whom the guard is mounted will approach ;
if there is a second officer he will be three paces in front of
the second file from the other flank,
m.s.m, n


Guards will march with arras at the Slope, and with
bayonets fixed.
In wet weather arms will be carried at the Secure.
2. Guards will not turn out after retreat or before reveille,
except at tattoo, on the approach of a body of troops,
in cases of alarm, or to receive grand or visiting rounds.
They will not pay any compliments during this period,
except to grand rounds, to whom they will present arms.
3. Sentries will not present arms to any officer or armed
party (except grand rounds) after sunset; but as long as
they can discern an officer, they will come to their front on
his approach, and stand steady with the rifle at the slope
till he has passed.
4. Sentries in their sentry boxes will salute by coming
smartly to attention.
The honours and salutes paid by guards and sentries are
as follows:
To General and field officers of the army and officers of
the navy of corresponding rank a sentry will present arms,
to other officers he will order arms.
To all armed parties, whether they are commanded by an
officer or not, he will present arms, and the party will
return the compliment by drawing and carrying swords,
carrying or sloping arms, or carrying arms (when mounted),
as the case may be. Parties with side arms are to be con-
sidered as armed parties.
To all unarmed parties a sentry will order arms, unless
they are commanded by field officers, in which case he will
present; in return, the commander of the party will give
the word “ Eyes — Bight,” or “Eyes — Left,” as the case may
be, and having passed him, “ Eyes— Front.”


Parties marching with arms at the secure, and parties
with side arms, will pay and return compliments as unarmed
parties.
Sec. 18. Relieving or Posting a Guard.
1. When the ground admits, a new guard will advance
in line towards the front of the old guard, and will be
drawn up 15 paces in front, or six paces from the left of
the old guard.
2. As soon as this is completed, the old guard will present
arms, and the new guard will return the salute.
3. Both guards will in like successive manner order
arms, and stand at ease.
4. The guard will then he told off, and the first relief
sent out. When the first relief of a new guard is sent out,
a corporal belonging to the old guard will accompany it to
bring in the relieved sentries. If the relief moves in line,
he will be on the left flank, if in file (or as in file) he will be
at the head of the front rank of files (or rank). As soon
as all the sentries are relieved, the two corporals will
change places, and the corporal of the old guard will assume
command. While the relief is going round, the commander
will take over the property in charge of the guard according
to the list in the old guard report.
5. When the reliefs have returned, and all the men of
the old guard have fallen in, both guards will be called to
attention, and ordered to slope arms.
6. The old guard will then move off in sections or half-
sections, the new guard presenting arms.


7. When the old guard is clear of the ground, the new
guard will slope arms, and if not already there, will
move on to the alignment occupied by the old guard, facing
similarly. Arms will then be ordered, and the commander
of the guard will read the orders of the guard to his men ;
these orders will also be read to the men forming the first
relief on their coming off sentry. The men of the guard
will then be dismissed to the guard room.
Sec. 19. Believing and Posting Sentries, and Marching
Beliefs.
1. On the approach of the relief, the sentry, with rifle at
the Slope, will place himself in front of the sentry box.
The corporal of the relief will proceed as follows:
Belief, Halt. At about 6 paces from the sentry.
The man who is to relieve the old sentry will then move
out from the relief and place himself at one pace from the
latter, turning towards him; the old sentry will then give
over his orders, the corporal referring to the board of orders
to see if they are correctly given.
f On this word, the old sentry will take
one pace to his left, and then move to his
place in the relief, turning to the rear,
and the new sentry will take one pace
forward.
Pass.
Sentries,
*hout Turn.
( Both sentries will then be ordered to
( turn about.


Quick-March. J
The relief will be marched off-
2. When a sentry who is to be posted on a new post hag
reached the post assigned to him, he will be ordered to halt
and turn about. The corporal will then read the orders to
him.
3. The object for which he is posted, the front of his
post, and the extent of his beat, will be clearly pointed out
to a sentry when first posted.
Sentries must not quit their arms, lounge or converse
with anyone on any pretence, nor may they stand in their
sentry boxes in good or even in moderate weather.
Double sentries moving about on their post will always
turn outwards when turning about.
4. Marching Beliefs. —Reliefs of fewer than four men
will be formed in single rank as usual, when of four men,
or upwards, they may be formed into two ranks. (In streets,
or narrow places, reliefs should always be marched in single
rank.) When marching in line, the corporal will be on the
right; when in file (or as in file), he will be on the proper
front of the rear file (or man).
Sec. 20. Sentries Challenging.
1. When it gets dark the sentries will challenge in the
following manner : On the approach of any person the
sentry will call out in a sharp tone, Halt. Who comes there ?
when on a post where a sudden rush could be made upon
him, he will at once come to the Ready, if the person
approaching gives a satisfactory reply, the sentry will
say Bass friend; All’s well, remaining at the Slope


or Ready, till he has passed. If the person approaching
answers grand (or visiting) rounds, the sentry, if there is
no countersign, will say Pass grand (or visiting) rounds-
All’s well ; presenting as they pass if they are grand rounds.
But if there is a countersign he will say Stand grand (or visit-
ing) rounds: Advance one and give the countersign , at the
same time coming down to the Ready. In this position he will
receive the countersign ; and if it is correct will say Pass
grand* (or visiting) rounds; All’s well; and proceed as
above described.
2. If the sentry is on or near the guard-room door, he will
proceed as described below :
Sec. 21. Guards Turning Out.
The following form will be observed when a guard is
visited bythe fieldofficer or captain and subaltern of the day
called grand or visiting rounds :
On their approach the sentry at or near the guard-room
door will challenge ; Halt; who comes there ? The officer
will reply, grand (or visiting) rounds ; the sentry will
then call: Guard — turn out. The guard will fall in with
bayonets fixed and arms sloped, and, if there is no
countersign, the commander will cad out: Advance, grand
(or visiting) rounds. All’s well; to grand rounds he will
present; to visiting rounds he will remain at the Slope.
If there is a countersign to be given, a corporal or
sergeant with a flank file of the guard will double out, and
when about 10 paces from the rounds will order the file to
halt, and will then repeat the challenge ; Who comes there ?
The reply will again be, grand (or visiting) rounds ; the
non-commissioned officer calling : Stand, grand (or visit


ing) rounds. Advance one and give the countersign.
Rounds will then in a low voice give the countersign,
which the non-commissioned officer alone will carry, in
double time, for verification to the commander of the
guard. If correct, the commander of the guard will call
out, Advance grand (or visiting) rounds. All's well. The
file will then double back to the guard, and rounds will
advance to the guard, which will present arms to grand
rounds.

of travelling escorts at a rapid pace, should be understood,
in order that both officers and men may be able to perform
the duties required of them when detailed for this service.
Escorts are formed up with arms a., the Advance, facing
the point at which the Royal Carriage is waiting. They
are formed in single rank.
In the case of a field officer’s escort it will be formed up
(if space is available) in line or in half-squadron column as
described in the first paragraph of Sec. 15.

Plate XLIII.
ROYAL ESCORTS.
Fig. I.—Captain’s Escort without Standard.
An escort should be told off and formed up in such a
manner that its different parties can move off in succession
in the required direction without any delay or confusion,
and without the advanced parties having to pass across the
front of the rear parties. Thus, if the escort is to move
towards its right, it should be told off from the right; if


towards the left it should be told off from the left. In the
following instructions the escort is supposed to move off
from the right. In all cases the non-commissioned officers
and men composing an escort must be thoroughly instructed
beforehand as to the exact positions they are to occupy.
The position for the officers or non-commissioned officer
riding by the Eoyal Carriage (unless other special instruc-
tions are given) is near the door, with their bodies in line
with the carriage window. The officer in command of the
escort should always ascertain beforehand on which side of
the carriage the principal Royal Personage will be seated,
and will invariably ride on that side; in most cases it will
be the right, and the following instructions are framed on
that supposition. The officer next in seniority takes post
on the opposite side of the carriage. If the Royal Person-
age desires to speak with any person riding with the pro-
cession, the officer of the escort must drop slightly back, in
order to allow the person to approach the carriage, still,
however, remaining on the same side of the carriage, and
resuming his original position the instant the conversation
has ended. The officer in command of an escort has a most
important duty to perform; he is at all times immediately
and solely responsible for the safety of the Royal Person-
age, his place cannot be supplied by anyone not belonging to
the escort, and he must on no account be interfered' with
by any other officer.
The only authorised paces for escorts are the walk and
the trot. They ride with arms at the Advance, with the
exception of the two leading and rear men of the advanced
and rear guards respectively, who in all escorts have their
arms at the Carry.
The pace of the procession is regulated by that of the
Royal Carriage, and the different parties of the escort must
be careful to preserve their distances from it. In most cases


50 yards is the distance to be maintained between the differ-
ent parties of the advanced and rear guard of an escort,
but this distance may be diminished according to circum-
stances. As a rule, the rear of that party of an escort
which immediately precedes the Royal Carriage will keep
at a distance of about three horses’ lengths in front of the
leaders' heads; and the head of the party immediately
following the Royal Carriage will be at one horse’s length
distance behind the carriage. On all occasions the greatest
care must be taken that the progress of the Royal Carriage
is not in any way impeded.
When the cortege arrives at its destination, the escort
forms up, with arms at the Carry, facing the Royal Carriage.
The actual mode in which the formation is to be made will
frequently be affected by accidents of position and by the
extent of space available; but the escort must under all
circumstances form up facing the Royal Carriage, without
reference to which is the inner or the outer flank of the
column. As the Royal Personage quits the carriage, the
officers salute, and the trumpet sounds.
All orders regarding the disposal, dismissal, &c., of an
escort are to be taken by the officer in command from the
equerry in waiting or other officer of the Royal Household.
Escorts are not permitted to cloak except when the
Royal servants are cloaked, and when a procession has to
pass through a crowded thoroughfare it is not desirable
under any circumstances that the escort should cloak.
When cloaked, however, escorts will have their arms at the
Advance.
All escorts turn out in “ Review Order,” unless other-
wise ordered.
Sec. 23. Detailed Instructions for Escorts.
The following plates explain in detail the strength and
mode of formation of the different Royal Escorts which are

telling off and forming up escorts cannot in all oases be
exactly carried out, and the officer in command must
exercise his discretion in adopting the method of telling off
and formation which are most suitable; but the general
distribution of the different parties of each escort must be
in accordance with that here described.

FUNERALS.
Sec. 25, General Instructions.
The party appointed for the escort, according to the rank
of the deceased, will be drawn up facing the place where the
corpse is lodged. Small parties will be formed with their
files extended at one side pace from each other. When the
corpse is brought cut the officer commanding will proceed
as follows
“ Present—Arms.”
“ Reverse — Arms,"
The officers’ swords are reversed under
the right arm, the point of the sword
downwards, the hilt being grasped with
the right hand.

Large funeral parties will march by troops or sections,
which will move at the head of the procession.
In small parties, after the men ha'-e reversed arms, they
will simply be turned either to the right or left, and moved
to the head of the procession in files.
“ Slow —
March,"
f The party will move off in slow time fol-
( lowed by the band, with drums muffled.
Unless specially ordered by the officer commanding the
garrison, the band will not commence playing the Dead

When the head of the procession arrives near the burial
ground, if the escort is formed in troops, sections or half-
sections, they will be ordered to form a lane for the corpse
to pass through by the troops or sections wheeling outwards
and then after halting turning inwards towards the corpse.
If the party is formed in half-sections, the ranks will be
inclined outwards, and will then be halted and turned
inwards.

PART VI.—INTERIOR ECONOMY, BIVOUACS
OR CAMPS, AND STABLE DUTIES.
Sec. 1. Interior Economy.
A sound system of interior economy for mounted troops
must be one of decentralisation, based upon the squadron
system. It must be thoroughly understood that the squad-
ron officers are individually and collectively responsible for
the comfort, health, and well-being of their men, horses,
and equipment.
The squadron leader is responsible to the officer com-
manding the regiment or larger unit, and the regimental
staff are to afford assistance or advice to the squadron
officers, and are in no way to relieve those officers of their
responsibilities or duties.
The two most important points for squadron officers to
observe are : (1) the food and comfort of their men, and (2)
the forage and well-being of their horses. No pains should
be spared to provide good, ample, and well-cooked food for
the men, especially when in hard work or subject to the
strain of a campaign.
The greatest pains should be taken in a campaign to
provide clothing, soap, and tobacco for the men. It is
above all important that in the field each man should be
supplied with two flannel shirts, which should be worn
alternately, that not in use being exposed to the air or
dried in the sun. It is only by these means and by con-
stant care that men can be kept free from vermin when in
the field, which in itself is a matter of great consequence to
the health and well-being of the troops.


Sec. 2. Encampments , <bc.
Troops may, when halted for the night, be sheltered (a)
in bivouac, (6) in camps, (c) in cantonments.
The repose of troops, and consequently their health, being
to a great extent dependent on obtaining shelter at night,
it is clear that too much attention cannot be paid by a
commander and his staff to the selection of the time and
place of a night halt, and to security from attack while in
a state of rest.
1. Bivouac. —A bivouac is practically an encampment
without tents, and the same rules have to be observed.
The question of tents is purely one of climate and of
available accommodation. If they can be dispensed with
all the better, for they add considerably to the train of an
army.
As a rule a bivouac for a regiment is laid out as for a
minimum camp in column of squadrons or of half-squadrons
{vide Plates XLIYa. and b). Line of squadron columns
has also been found convenient. A site which is both dry
and level should be selected, and when with other troops
should be placed in rear, and as near to the water as con-
venient. In the absence of picquet lines, horses may be
ringed.
2. Gamp. —Mounted troops will, as a rule, be encamped
on the plan shown in Plate XLIYa. A squadron encamped
singly will follow the method shown in Plate XLIVb.
3. Before taking up a camping ground for the night, one
or two officers, usually the quartermaster and adjutant, with
at least one N. 0.0. per squadron should proceed in advance,
select the site, mark out the ground, and above all, make
all the necessary arrangements for watering the horses. It


PLATE XLIV A.
PLAN OF ENCAMPMENT OF A MOUNTES REGIMENT OF FOUR
SQUADRONS OR COMPANIES.




is most essential that the orders for watering should be
given if possible before the arrival of the troops, as nothing
takes so much time or requires so much care and patience
as to water horses well after a hard day’s work.
4. The following procedure on arrival is given as a
guide:—
Instructions for Picqueting Horses on Arrival in Gamp or
Bivouac. —The squadron or regiment will be formed up
in the formation which has been selected to be adopted for
the camp or bivouac, on the ground between the quarter
guard and that marked out for the horse lines.
The procedure will then be as follows:
1. Dismount, pile arms, take off belts, &c., and hang them
on the arms. The Nos. 3 hold the horses, and their arms
are piled with the remainder.
2. Go back to the horses and take built-up ropes, heel
ropes, and pegs off the saddles, the Nos. 2 taking those of
the Nos. 3.
3. Fall in again in front of arms, and march to the ground
marked out for horse lines. When the left of each half
squadron is opposite the flag marking the horse lines, halt
and front.
4. Drive in a peg at the flag and put the built-up rope
together, passing it through the loop on a peg about every
15 yards.
5. Fasten the rope to a peg at the end of the line and
stretch it out in the direction of a flag or stick placed as a
distant point, and then drive in the pegs at equal intervals
along the rope.
6. Drive in a heel peg 4 paces (or at a distance to suit
the average length of the horses) from each end ofjthe line
on the side on which the horses’ heels are to be.


7. Fall in the men and dress them between these two
pegs. Each man to be opposite the centre of his own piece
of built-up rope, and to have his heel peg in his hand.
When the men are dressed, order them to drive the pegs
in between their heels (the pegs to stand away from the
horses at an angle of about 45 degrees).
JV.B. —The section leaders will be held responsible that
the Nos. 2 put the Nos. 3 pegs in the right place after they
have driven in their own.
8. Lay out the heel ropes, but do not fasten them to the
pegs.
9. The men then go back to the horses and file them on
the lines, each man halting his horse opposite the centre of
his own piece of built-up rope, and at once unfastening the
head rope and tying it to the line with two half-hitches.
10. Fasten shackles of heel ropes round horses’ legs above
the fetlock joint, and then secure the end of the heel ropes
to the loops of the peg with two half-hitches.
N.B. —When the horse ispicqueted, the head rope-should
just be sufficiently long enough to allow of the horse’s head
being in its natural position when the horse is standing
with its head perpendicular to the picquet line.
11. Slacken the girths and raise the saddle, or take off
the saddles, and then water or feed according to order. If
the saddles are taken off they are placed between the horses’
heads and the line where the tents are to be.
12. Fetch, and pitch the tents, or, if there are no tents,
fetch the arms and pile them where the tents would be.
Frequently on foreign service (notably South Africa) it
will be found that heel ropes are not required, especially
after the first few days.


Quarter guards are to be posted immediately the men
have dismounted.
When the baggage waggons arrive, they are to be drawn
up in rear of the camp, clear of the ground on which the
tents are to be pitched. The waggons are to be packed
with their tailboards towards the camp.
The horses are invariably to be picqueted before the tents
are pitched, or any other operations are commenced;
therefore, in packing baggage waggons, the picketing equip-
ment should be put in last, as it is first required on pitching
the camp. After the horses are picqueted, the men not
required as stable or horse-line guards will be told off in
parties for drawing and pitching tents, digging kitchens and
latrines, cooking, drawing forage, rations, fuel, water, &c.
In general a lateral space of 5 feet should be
allowed to each horse at the picquet lines; but if the
encampment is only for a single night, or it is necessary to
compress the depth of the camp, this space may be reduced
to one yard, as in the ranks.
Fastening the picquet lines to the wheels of the waggons
(which should be locked) is the quickest and safest way of
securing the transport horses.
Kicking and vicious horses should be picqueted at some
distance from the others.
13. Regularity in Tents in Standing Camps. —Between
reveille and early morning stables, blankets should be taken
out of the tents and folded with waterproof sheets above
and below, and placed on the left of the tent door. In fine
weather the curtains of the tent will be rolled up before the
breakfast hour. The men’s mess tins, tin cups and plates,
will be piled on the left of the tent door, and on the right
of the blankets. A tent orderly will be detailed daily for
each tent, who will be responsible for the general cleanli


ness of the tent, plates, cooking pots, &c., and will act as
mess orderly.
Rifles will be neatly arranged round tent poles.
14. Horse Lines in Standing Camps. —The horse blankets
and waterproof sheets if in use will be removed from the
horses immediately after early stables sounding, folded
neatly and placed in line in front of each horse, nosebag
placed on top. Heel pegs will be carefully dressed, and
should be kept whitewashed. Picket lines tightened where
necessary. Horse lines will be kept clean and well swept.
In all cases the forage should be stacked on the outer
flank of horse lines, in line with picquet pegs.
15. Regimental Notices. —Each regiment should provide a
regimental notice board, which should be placed in front of
the regimental quarter guard tent.
Orders to be read to the troops daily. Copies of regi-
mental and brigade orders to be put on regimental notice
board daily. All notices affecting the men should be put
on this board.
16. Refuse Pits. —-A regimental refuse pit will be dug
near the kitchen of each regiment, as well as those of
officers’ and sergeants’ messes, into which all scraps, paper,
broken bottles, &c., collected by the regimental fatigue
party, &c., will be placed. Small rectangular squadron
refuse pits will be dug at regular intervals, into which
paper, &c., may be thrown.
17. Manure. —Manure will be neatly stacked well to the
rear of the camp. Care is to be taken in removing litter
that it is not dropped about the camp.
18. Quarter Guards and Ficquets. —Each regiment
will mount a quarter guard, and will, in addition, furnish
the necessary stable picquet at the hour named in orders.


19. Canteen —Canteen should be opened as follows :
For sale of groceries only, 6.30 to 8 a.m. All articles,
11 a.m. to 2 p.m., and 4to 9 p.m. On Sunday the canteen
will be closed during the hours of Divine service.
Orderly officers will visit the canteen daily. Any case
of irregularity will be at once brought to the notice of the
officer commanding.
20. Hospital. — (a) A Field Hospital should be estab-
lished for the reception and treatment of the sick in
camp.
(b) A. book will be kept to record the visits of all officers
to Field Hospital.
(o) Hours of admission (except in cases of emergency)
are notified, and the “daily sick” will parade daily,
at hours to be similarly published in orders, at the
Medical Officer’s orderly tent.
All “ daily sick ” will be accompanied by a sick report, in
duplicate. The non-commissioned officer doing duty
as “ marching sick ” will be responsible that this is
duly carried out.
“ Sick reports ” must be forwarded with non-commissioned
officers and men being sent on by medical officers for
admission to the Field Hospital. The arms, accou-
trements, and valises will rccompany them. For
these a receipt will be given by the non-commissioned
officer in charge of the Field Hospital to the non-
commissioned officer “ marching sick.”
(d) Non-commissioned officers and men admitted to the
Field Hospital will be rationed for the day of
admission by their respective corps, unless a special
order to the contrary is given by the Principal
Medical Officer. After that they will be dieted by
the Field Hospital.


21. Sanitation. — (a) A Medical Officer will act as Sani-
tary Officer and inspect daily every portion of the
camp and its immediate surroundings.
(b) Earth should be thrown over refuse pits twice daily,
as well as over soil in latrines, and disinfectants
freely used in addition. These will be supplied by
the quartermaster.
( c) Regimental Quartermasters are responsible that the
greatest care is to be observed in all kitchens,
latrines, and urine pits, to prevent litter.
22. Trumpeters and Buglers. —The trumpeters of each
regiment will “ en masse ” sound reveille, feed, dismiss from
stables, mess calls, retreat, first and last post daily.
23. Regularity of Lines. Especial care should be
bestowed upon the regularity and neatness of squadron
lines.
Officers commanding squadrons will be responsible to
commanding officers for the area occupied by their men.
24. Uniform. — Uniform will be worn at all times in
camp. m
25. Hours for Issue of Rations. —lssues of rations, forage
and fuel will be made daily at regulated hours.
Ration and forage parties will form up under the direc-
tion of the supply officer. The corps first on the list of
issue one day, taking the last place on the following day,
and so on.
26. Watering. —The Quartermaster in the case of regi-
ments will be responsible for constructing the necessary
arrangements for watering.
Sec. 3. Stable Discipline.
The greatest importance should be attached to a proper
system of stable discipline being established and maintained.


It is only by a complete and highly organised system of
interior economy and stable management that mounted
troops can be maintained effective. The strictest attention
io every detail of the essentials of stable discipline is
imperative.
It is upon such system that the health and condition of
the horses, and therefore the efficiency of the corps, depend.
It is necessary that the men should never be suffered to
retain the idea that stable duties are merely the duties
of fatigue.
On service some of the arrangements regarding details of
stable hours and routine, which can be carried out in
peace time, may fall through ; this, however, matters little,
provided the squadron officers are watchful, and careful of
their horses, and prevent them being neglected, as to their
watering and feeding, on account of the men being
fatigued or sickly.
The following routine is laid down as a guide for hours,
&c., of a squadron or regiment, which will require modifi-
cation according to circumstances ;—•

Much of the attention which is paid to grooming and
s iddlery during peace time should be transferred
1. To seeing that each horse gets properly watered and
fed.
2. To having girths and surcingles kept soft (leather girths
should be dressed occasionally with hot fat or dubbing).
3. To watching for sore backs and girth galls.
4. To sparing all horses unnecessary fatigue, e.g., never
allowing men to sit on their horses when they can be dis-
mounted ; never taken out of a walk unnecessarily, &c.
The following is the ordinary routine of stable duties :
When on service in the field and during training, officers
attend all stables. Every officer will invariably attend
second or mid-day stables.
Stables is a parade, and the same punctuality and regu-
larity during stables is to be observed as on the daily
parades.
The orderly officer attends all stables.
The “ Warning” for stables will sound 15 minutes before
stable hour.
On “ Stables ” sounding the men will “ Fall in ” in fatigue
dress, by troops, with their grooming articles, and answer
their names.
The non-commissioned officers of troops report to the
squadron sergeant-major, who will report to the senior
officer, when the word will be “Bight Turn — File in.”
During stable hours no man is to leave stables or horse
lines without permission, nor is any man to stop grooming
to clean his saddlery until his horse is passed as sufficiently
groomed ; at the “ Turn in ” to morning stables all men are


to help to clean out stables or horse lines before commencing
grooming.
Officers are to watch the men grooming, and see that
time is not wasted ; they are to notice the state of the
horses, bringing to notice any horses falling off in condition.
They are frequently to examine their squadron horses to
see if sufficiently groomed, and lose no opportunity of getting
acquainted with the temper and constitution of each horse,
as well as the capabilities (in knowledge of grooming and
dealing with horses) of their men.
To test the condition of a horse’s coat, both as to cleanli-
ness and health, it should be felt with the bare hand.
Mane and tail should also be examined.
The following routine of “ Stable duties ” is published
for guidance, and should be adhered to with modifications
according to circumstances.
Sec, 4. Stable Duties.
1. Pick out and wash horse’s feet.
2. Sponge the eyes, nostrils, and dock,
3. Groom legs.
4. Groom body.
5. Groom head, mane, and tail.
6. Clean saddlery.
7. Horses are to be invariably watered before feeding.
8. The feeds and the hay will be made out by a non-com-
missioned officer detailed from the troop, and each man will
be responsible for feeding his own horse.
9. When “ Peed ” sounds the section leaders will see that
horses are fed at once and that in camp the nose bags are
simultaneously put on. On no account is a horse to be
groomed whilst feeding.
10. It is the duty of the squadron orderly sergeant to see
that the nose bags are removed when they have finished


their feed, and report that he has done so to the regimental
orderly sergeant, who will insert the fact in his report.
11. Smoking is prohibited in or near stables or horse
lines.
12. At inspection or when a senior officer visits the horse
lines, the men will be called to attention, and stand smartly
to their horses’ heads; upon the order “Go on,” they will
resume Work.
13. The troop officers will personally inspect and pass
each horse before the men leave stables.
14. The horse lines or stables are in charge of line
sentries or stablemen. These men come on duty to relieve
the regular night stable picquet sentries at the warning for
morning stables. Their duties are to keep the lines and
stables clean, to prevent horses injuring themselves or each
other, to take the nose bags off the horses when they have
finished feeding, and to make out the hay.
Their meals will be brought to them by the room or tent
orderlies.
The orderly officer, when he visits the stables or horse
lines, will satisfy himself that they are performing their
duties.
Sec. 5. General Instructions.
1. At watering hours horses are to be quietly ridden or led
to and from water under at least one officer per squadron.
No trotting or hurrying of horses is on any account to be
allowed. Unless attention is paid to the observance of this
rule, it will constantly be neglected, much to the detriment
of the condition of the horses.
Full time is to be given horses while drinking, and care
must be taken that the men do not hurry them.
Ten minutes before feed hours, one man per group is to
be sent for the feeds. The horses are not to be fed before


the senior officer on the lines or in tlxe stables orders the
“ Feed” to sound, on the report being made to him that the
feeds are ready.
If this is not done it is not possible to tell with certainty
that all the horses have been fed. Horses are, moreover,
inclined to become restless and will injure one another if
not fed simultaneously.
The senior officer, on the report “All fed” being made to
him, will order the “ Dismiss ” from stables, before which
no officer, non-commissioned officer, or man will leave
stables or horse lines.
2. Officers commanding squadrons will satisfy themselves
that sergeants of troops have made daily and due provision
for the watering, feeding, and grooming of the horses of the
men who are not at stables; also that the sergeant farriers
have made their daily examination of each horse’s shoes, and
that any horses ailing have been sent for the veterinary
surgeon’s inspection, and any horse requiring shoeing to the
forge.
Section leaders are responsible that all the horses of
their sections are properly looked after and fed, assistance
being given if required upon application to the sergeant of
troop.
Before turning out of stables everything is to be left
properly arranged in its place. Barrows emptied, saddlery,
&c., according to order, and stablemen properly told off.
3. Horses severely wounded or seriously ill will be
removed from squadron stables or lines, and placed in a
hospital stable or sick horse lines, where they wall be under
the special charge of the veterinary surgeon.
Experienced men, at the rate of about two to five horses,
will be detailed as hospital stablemen.
4. After parade, field, drill, or march, the horses should
be brought in as cool as possible. If horses are sweating it
M.S.M. 0


will be found a good plan to dismount and lead 10 minutes
before reaching stable. Many horses who fret mounted
towards home will cool down quickly on being led.
Horses must always be unbitted (and, if possible, the
men must dismount) when they are taken to water.
The horses when filed to stables will be stripped, and
men set at once to dry their backs under the saddles for 10
minutes, the feeds being made out at once. If the horse’s
back is still hot the numnah or blanket should be left on
with the surcingle slack.
On “ All fed” being reported, the “ Dismiss ” will sound,
khd the men will turn out to put on fatigue dress (loose
canvas trousers or “ slacks ” are recommended). If dinners
are ready, the warning for stables will sound half an hour
afterwards, and “ Stables ” and "•Officers’ call ” three-quarters
of an hour afterwards, otherwise the warning will sound in
5 minutes, and stables in 20 minutes.
After the horses are sufficiently groomed the men should
get to work on their kit and saddlery, taking special care
to dry the numnah or blanket, and to soften the girths and
surcingle.
Each man should be permitted to leave stables as soon as
he shows his work done to the non-commissioned officer of
his troop.
Officers Will invariably attend stalles after a march, and
Will then examine the horses, causing them to be passed
before them to see they are sufficiently groomed, examining
their backs, and paying special attention to any horse who
appears to be suffering from his work. Girth galls are to be
especially looked out for.
5, It is only by assiduous attention, careful feeding,
watering and grooming that horses can travel long journeys
or perform military services without detriment. It has been
already stated that, though the grooming need only be of a


rough character, nothing is so essential to the well-being of
horses as rubbing by a wisp of hay or straw or by a brush.
By these means circulation of the blood is restored to the
surface of the skin after a long journey and the pores of
the skin are released from the perspiration, thus restoring
inspiration and respiration through the skin.
6. It is to be constantly borne in mind that the squadron
officers are alone responsible for the efficiency and condition
of their horses. The veterinary surgeon will assist them in
this part of their duty when necessary, and should make
constant inspection of the horse lines and horses in his
capacity as veterinary adviser to the officer commanding
the regiment. The veterinary surgeon should on no account
give orders affecting the horses of a squadron without inform-
ing the officer commanding the squadron, nor should he
inspect the horses in charge of any officer without notifying
beforehand his desire to do so.


PART VII.-DEMOLITION OF RAILWAYS AND
TELEGRAPH LINES, STRENGTHENING OF
POSTS AND FIELD FORTIFICATIONS.
Sec. 1. Destruction of Railways and Telegraphs.
General Remarks.
Railway and telegraph lines should never be damaged
without special orders. These orders should always specify
the nature of the damage : whether it is to be partial, so
that it could be rapidly repaired by our own troops, or as
complete as circumstances will allow.
As a rule the time and means at the disposal of mounted
troops will only permit of the partial interruption and
destruction of railway and telegraph lines. If the damage
to be effected is intended to be complete, the work should,


if possible, be entrusted to the mounted portion of the field
engineers attached to the mounted troops, or to officers,
non-commissioned officers and men serving among the
mounted troops who have received the necessary special
training, by whom it will be more quickly and systema-
tically done.
Sec. 2. Railways.
For the destruction of railways, guncotton is the quickest
and most effective explosive, but it should only be used by
trained men.
The following steps may be taken :
Permanent Way. — (a) Cut rails with guncotton. (Two-
thirds of a 1-lb. of guncotton will destroy the heaviest rail.
It should be fastened close against the thin part between
the top and bottom, and near a chair, W.B.—The pieces
will fly far.)
(b) Blow up culverts or small bridges if enough explosive
is available. For hasty demolition of a masonry bridge
remove the road metal and filling at the centre, and place
the charge over the arch ring as shown at a in Plate XLY.,
Fig. 5. Tamp with the road metal if there is time.
(c) Remove the fishplates and shift the position of the
rails slightly.
(d) In hot countries, at night or early morning, insert
wedges between the junction of rails, points, &c., thus
opposing an obstacle to the extension produced by the sun’s
rays during the day. This will cause deviations in the line
in all directions,


(e) Remove portions of the line at intervals, especially mt
curves.
(/) A line may be blocked for many hours by bringing
about a collision, or running a train off the track.
N.B. —Officers should embrace any opportunity offered
them of learning how to start or stop a locomotive.
(g') When plenty of men are available the permanent way
may be torn up, and the sleepers built up in piles for burn-
ing, the rails should be then placed on them and twisted
when sufficiently heated. This is done by inserting the
points of picks in the holes at the ends of the length of rail
and twisting in opposite directions.
( h ) Lines can be destroyed by the following method :
Men should be formed along the line in single rank outside
of it and facing inwards, the rails at both flanks disconnected
and the ballast loosened round the sleepers. At a signal,
the men seize the rail, lift it up with sleepers attached, and
then turn it over. Some of the men should be provided
with stout poles as levers.
Bolling Stock, —(a) Remove or destroy connections of
water tanks.
(6) Locomotives can be rendered useless, but repairable,
by taking off the connecting rods on each side of the engine,
or the piston or safety valve.
(c) For complete destruction, a shell or a small-arra vol-
ley through the barrel of the boiler is effective.
( d) Carriages and waggons may be burnt, or run off the
rails at an embankment, or destroyed by collision,


PLATE XLV.


PLATE XLVI.


Sec. 3. Telegraph Lines.
For the destruction of telegraph lines, the following
methods may be adopted ;
(a) Establish a “ leak ” by connection of the conductor
to earth. This may be best done along the pole.
( h ) Establish a contact between two wires.
N.B.—Artificial faults, to be successful, require to be
skilfully made ; officers should therefore endeavour to obtain
the services of men skilled in telegraph construction; intel-
ligent operators will also give valuable assistance. In every
mounted corps of any strength, men in some way or other
connected with the telegraph service will probably be found
in the ranks.
(c) If time permits and if it be desirable to make the
demolition more complete, a number of poles should be cut
down and burnt, and as much wire as possible should be
cut into small pieces and removed or carefully hidden.
Sec. 4. Strengthening of Posts.
Mounted troops are frequently employed to seize and
hold localities until the arrival of the infantry, and in such
cases it may be expected that they will be attacked by
superior numbers, every effort should therefore be made as
soon as the locality has been occupied to strengthen the
ground to be defended by artificial means :


These may be ;
(a) The hasty preparation of walls, fences, or other exist-
ing cover for defence.
(h) The provisions of cover for the firing line by means
of shelter trenches, pits, or breastworks.
Mounted troops detached for duty of the above nature
will most likely be supplied with entrenching tools, borrowed
for the occasion from the nearest troops in possession of
them. These will be carried on pack saddles, or in a light
cart or waggon capable of moving at the same speed as the
troops.
The following entrenching tools are obtainable from the
infantry, viz.:—Shovels, pickaxes, felling and hand axes,
saws, crow-bars, &c.
The following points must be borne in mind in the pre-
paration or provision of cover :
(a) Two feet of earth unrammed, 48 inches of soft wood
such as fir, or 28 inches of hard wood such as oak or red
gum, are proof against rifle or shrapnel bullets at any
range.
(h) The maximum heights over which fire can be
delivered by men of average height are—
Man standing, 4 feet 6 inches
~ kneeling, 3 feet
„ lying down, 1 foot
Machine guns, 3 feet to 4 feet, according
to nature of mounting.
N.B.—ln the following figures the sign thus -)- denotes
beighth above ground level, and the sign - depth below.


Cover. —Walls Figs. 1 to 4, Plate XLY., shows types of
walls prepared for defence.
Points to be remembered are :
(a) Notching is easier and much quicker than loop-holing.
(b) Head cover, i.e., cover in front of the men’s heads,
should be ample in every case.
(c) The enemy must be prevented from using the loop-
holes should he succeed in closing on the wall.
Notches can be made by unskilled men with crowbars
or chisels, or even picks. One man can notch an ordinary
wall in five minutes, but as a rule ten minutes should be
allowed. They should be made at intervals of from 3to 5
feet.
Head cover can be provided by placing large stones or
two filled sandbags over the notch. Logs are not proof,
but are better than nothing.
The enemy can be prevented from using the loopohles or
notches by making these a clear 6 feet from the ground on
the enemy’s side, or where this is impracticable, by digging
a small ditch to the depth of a foot below the notch on the
enemy’s side of the wall, and scattering the earth well to
the front.
In the case of high walls, banks of earth or platforms
must be made for the defenders to stand on so as to enable
them to fire through the loopholes or notches.
Close board fences may be utilised by digging a trench
behind and banking the earth against them. With such
an exterior revetment, head cover can easily be arranged.


PLATE XLVII.


PLATE XLVIII.


A wall of four or live inches of shingle supported between
thin boards or corrugated iron, is proof against bullets.
Shelter trenches. —Where no cover can be obtained from
existing banka or walls, it may be obtained by digging a
trench and throwing the earth on the enemy’s side of it.
The front of the trench should be vertical when the soils
admits of it, and the interior of the parapet revetted as steeply
as possible.
If the trench be 1 foot 6 inches deep and the earth piled
up to a height of 1 foot 6 inches, the occupants of the
trench firing (kneeling) over the parapet are fairly covered
against rifle fire ; but the trench should always be 3 feet
deep if possible.
Fig. 1, Plate XLVII., shows a type of trench which can
be made in ordinary soil in about two hours.
Keep in mind that the object of the shelter trench is to
protect men firing from it, and that the trench is of no use
unless the ground in front is thoroughly seen and swept by
the bullets of the defenders. This can seldom be done
unless the parapet of the trench is as much as 18 inches
above the ground ; but the parapet must always be kept as
low as possible, for the sake of concealment.
Fixing the position of the trench requires judgment and
practice. The eye must, of course, be brought to the level
of the intended parapet in order to see whether all the
ground in front can be observed.
Long grass or rough ground will sometimes make it abso-
lutely necessary to raise the parapet to as much as 3 feet
above the surface. {See Plate XLYIL, Fig. 2). This
increases labour and makes the parapet more conspicuous,
but cannot be helped, as fire effect is of more importance
than protection.


If the ground in front can be seen from the surface level,
the trench can be more completely concealed, that is, if the
excavated earth can be properly disposed of. Earth
scattered widely over a grass surface may be more con-
spicuous than a parapet. The deeper trench of course
implies more labour.
When there is time enough, the trench can be much
improved by being traversed and recessed, as shown in
Plate XLYIL, Figs. 3to 5. The traverses localise the effect
of common shell, and the recesses give protection against
oblique shrapnel.
Head cover can be got by making a loop-hole covered
with brushwood and earth. (See Plate XLYIII., Fig. 1).
This raises the parapet and makes concealment more diffi-
cult, especially as loopholes are very difficult to hide.
The command of the foreground is also diminished. In
many cases, therefore, it is better to dispense with the head
cover.
Plate XLYIII., Fig. 2, gives a type of overhead cover.
Such cover can seldom be made in hastily extemporised
trenches on account of the amount of material required.
Concealment of Trenches. —This is of the first importance.
Keep the parapet as low as possible, and use common sense in
adopting means to make it resemble the surrounding ground.
In grass land, sod it, and water the sods. If branches and
grass are used to screen the parapet, remember that they
should be fresh, as when withered they may be very con-
spicuous.
Never put a trench on the sky line.
When possible, provide screened or protected communi-
cations to the rear.


Breastworks. —Breastworks are parapets raised breast
high above the natural ground level.
Breastworks of logs, or of logs and earth were found
very useful in the New Zealand and American Wars in
places where timber was plentiful.

explosives, especially for destruction of bridges and for
