The Chairman: Ladies and Gentlemen,? l
am sorry to have to preface our business this
evening by referring to a sad event, namely,
the death of Mr. Milford, who, as probably
most of you are aware, was District Goods
Manager at Birmingham. Mr. Milford, who
had just recovered from a serious illness, died
suddenly on Sunday last, and was buried at
Bristol to-day. We in this Society are specially
concerned, because he was the President of the
Birmingham Branch of the Society. I am
sure you will all agree we have lost a good
friend and colleague, for whom everyone had
the greatest respect, and that we should like
to express sympathy with the family in their
bereavement.
I have to introduce to you Mr. Charles
Travis, who is to lecture on ? The Railways
of Australia and New Zealand.? I am not
sure that it is necessary to introduce Mr.
Travis, because he is already an old friend of
the Society, and, as you may remember, he
gave us a paper here two or three years ago
on the subject, I think, of ? Railway Organisa-
tion.? He is, or rather, he was, a railway
officer some few years ago, and has since be-
come Associate Editor of the Railway Gazette
and Editor of the Railway Engineer, and so is
still very much immersed in railway affairs.
He is particularly qualified to speak on the
subject of the lecture to-night for the reason
that he acted as Secretary to the Commission
appointed to enquire into and report on the
railways of Australia and New Zealand in
the early part of last year, commencing with
the New South Wales railways and following
up with a report on the railways of New Zea-
land.

Mr. Chas Travis, M.lnst.T.


I think I see here to-night Mr. Warren-King,
who also accompanied that Commission in the
capacity of secretary to Sir Vincent Raven. I
am glad to see him here, and he will no doubt
be able to keep a check on the speaker.
We shall have an opportunity of first-hand
information in regard to these railways from
one engaged in the enquiry and report, and I
will ask Mr. Travis now to be good enough to
proceed.
Mr. Charles Travis : The pleasant
task before me this evening is by no
means a simple one. It is always
difficult for us to visualise conditions
different and far distant from our
own, especially when the ground to be
covered is so vast and the conditions so
fundamentally different. An hour?s talk
must therefore be of a most intensive
character if one is to deal even briefly
with the high spots, particularly when
regard is paid to the fact that nearly
one hundred lantern slides are to be
shown.
Thus pleading for your indulgence in
case my treatment appears sketchy, let
me say that my purpose is to bring
before you the main features of the
railway systems of Australia and
New Zealand, and to supplement that
description by a few impressions. It
will be noted that I am not using the
all-embracing word ? Australasia,? this
being for the reason that our kinsmen
in New Zealand do not like it. Nor
incidentally do the railways of the
different States very much like being
classed as Australian railways. Just
as the Scotsman prefers the name of his
country to be given when reference
thereto is made, so the Queenslander,
Victorian and Westralian desires
specific reference to his State. This
State jealousy, valuable in certain
respects but an obstacle to effective
development in others, is typified in the
railway problem. As an instance, this
vast Continent is saddled with a costly
heritage in the way of mixed gauge,
caused largely through State jealousy,
that will be a source of inconvenience
and great expense for many years to
come. But I shall refer to this later.
My Journeyings.
As many of you know, I went to
Australia with Sir Sam Fay and Sir
Vincent Raven to act as Secretary of
the Royal Commission on Railways and
Tramways in New South Wales, and in
that capacity had the pleasure of being
associated with Mr. J. A. Warren-King,
of your own railway, and Mr. S. E. Fay,
my two colleagues on the Secretariat.
While still in the early stages of the
New South Wales investigation an in-
vitation was received by the Royal Com-
missioners to conduct a similar inquiry
in New Zealand, and as this was ac-
cepted, the whole party proceeded there
on completing the work in New South
Wales. We spent five months in New
South Wales and over two months in
New Zealand, at the end of which
period I returned to Australia and
travelled thousands of miles on the rail-
ways there. My journeyings took me
to a point nearly 150 miles north of
Brisbane in Queensland, down to the
southernmost part of Tasmania, all
along the eastern coast of Australia,
across the Continent to the coast of
Western Australia, and all over the
New Zealand system, a special memory
in this connection being that south of
Bluff station I stood at the last buffer
stop in the world, short of the South
? Pole.? In all I negotiated 25,000 miles
of railway in Australia and New Zea-
land, apart from some 4,000 miles in
Canada and America on my way home.
Altogether my tour comprised close on
60,000 miles of travel by sea, road and
rail.

Railway Mileage of Australia.
It is, of course, generally known that
there is a considerable mileage of rail-
way in Australia, but few probably
realise the size and comprehensiveness
of the systems operated by the Common-
wealth and the six State Governments.
Indeed, unless one has travelled exten-
sively over them, it is almost impossible
adequately to appreciate the extent
of railway development in the sub-
continent. On June 30, 1924, the last
date for which complete figures are
available, the railways aggregated the
respectable total of 25,000 miles, or
about equal to the route-mileage of this
country. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment owned 1,733 miles, Queensland
6,040 miles,. New South Wales 5,523
miles, Victoria 4,435 miles, South Aus-
tralia 2,452 miles, Western Australia
3,629 miles, and Tasmania 673 miles.
The official population figure for Aus-
tralia given by the Commonwealth
statistician is 5,873,503. Thus there is
one mile of line per 235 inhabitants, a
very striking feature when compared
with this country.
The New Zealand railways aggregate
3,085 miles of line and are supported by
a population (including Maoris) of
1,400,000. They differ in many im-
portant respects from those of Aus-
tralia, and will be dealt with separately.
The map shewn on the screen gives
the location of the Australian railways,
and it will be noticed that, generally,
they comprise coastal systems?using
the word coastal rather more broadly
than we should interpret it. Here and
there, however, long spurs push out into
the interior under the urgent impulse
of pastoral development.
Some slight idea of the enormous size
of the Australian Continent will be
gained from reference to the map. It
is not perhaps generally realised that
the area of Australia is nearly as great
as that of the United States of America,
that it is nearly one-fourth of the area
of the whole of the British Empire, and
that it is more than twenty-five times
as large as the United Kingdom. Yet
the population is less than 6,000,000
souls, or far below that of London.
From Meekatharra (W.A.) to Dajarra
(Q.) there is a continuous line of rail-
way (except for break of gauge) of
5,500 miles?equal to a return journey
across the United States, or from Lon-
don to Hong Kong. Such a journey
would, however, involve changes owing
to break of gauge on six occasions.
Meekatharra is 600 miles north-east of
Perth, while the Queensland railways
run out westwards nearly 600 miles to
Dajarra from their main northern line
which is more than one thousand miles
'long, along the coast, the connection to
Cairns being completed last year.
The Network of Railways.
In the eastern, south-eastern, and
southern parts of Australia there exists
a considerable network of railway lines
converging from the various agri-
cultural, pastoral, and mining districts
towards the principal ports, which are
themselves connected by systems of
lines running approximately parallel to
the coast. In the east, lines radiating
from Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton,
Brisbane, Newcastle and Sydney extend
inland in various directions for dis-
tances ranging up to over 600 miles;
in the south-east there are numerous
lines, those in Victoria converging


towards Melbourne, while others in
New South Wales have their terminus
in Sydney; in the south there are four
main lines, with numerous branches,
running from Melbourne, while from
Adelaide one main line, with several
branches to the coastal towns, runs
inland in a northerly direction for a
distance of nearly 700 miles, and
another line runs in a south-easterly
direction to various ports, meeting the
main line from Melbourne on the border
of South Australia and Victoria near
Serviceton. The South Australian and
Victorian railway systems also meet on
the border at two other points, one near
Pinnaroo, and the other at Rennick,
near Mount Gambier. Victoria and
New South Wales exchange traffic at
Albury and Tocumwal, and New South
Wales and Queensland have at present
their only interchange point at Wallan-
garra.
In Western Australia there is a con-
nected system of main or trunk lines
between the ports of the State and the
agricultural, pastoral, and mining dis-
tricts, while there are also two short
lines, one on the north-west, the other
on the south coast, which are uncon-
nected with the main system. By the
opening, in 1917, of the 1,051 miles
long Trans-Australian railway from
Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, through
communication by rail was established
between the eastern States and the
Western Australian railway system.
In Tasmania, the principal towns are
connected by a system of lines, and
there are also, more especially in the
western districts, several lines which
have been constructed for the purpose
of opening up mining districts.
Queensland is well ahead of the other
States with regard to mileage, having
6,040 miles on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. The
railways of Queensland have been
thrust out boldly into the interior, while
the main line from the border through
Brisbane and along the coast is nearly
1,300 miles in length. Second from this
viewpoint is New South Wales, with
5,523 miles on the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge.
New construction is proceeding in
various directions, special attention
being given to the building of cross-
country lines to connect with the
principal arteries and so consolidate the
system. Then follow Victoria (5 ft. 3 in.
gauge) with 4,435 miles and the most
compact system in the Commonwealth,
Western Australia (3 ft. 6 in. gauge),
3,629 miles, South Australia (5 ft. 3 in.
and 3 ft. 6in gauge), 2,452 miles, and
the island system of Tasmania, with 673
miles, almost entirely on the 3 ft. 6 in.
gauge. Truly, there is a mixture of
gauges, and when it is added that the
Commonwealth line connecting Port
Augusta, South Australia, and Kalgoor-
lie, Western Australia, is on the 4 ft.
8| in. gauge, it will be realised that the
gauge problem is, indeed, a serious one.
Except between Adelaide and Mel-
bourne, it is impossible to travel be-
tween any two State capitals without
changing trains.
Traffic Aspects.
New South Wales and Victoria rank
very high over the other States from
the traffic point of view. In fact, if
Victoria be left out of consideration,
New South Wales has a larger volume
of passenger, freight and livestock
traffic than all the other States of the
Commonwealth put together. Around


both Melbourne and Sydney there is a
great and growing suburban traffic, and
this naturally swells the number of
passenger journeys made on each sys-
tem. Victoria, aided by its extensive
and most efficient electrified train ser-
vice in the Melbourne area, shows a
figure of 167,861,864 passenger jour-
neys, this being nearly 40,000,000 in
excess of the New South Wales figure.
Round Sydney, however, the Govern-
ment tramway service?which was very
favourably reported upon by the recent
Royal Commission ?carries many pas-
sengers who would normally be carried
by railway, and it is probable, when the
Sydney railway electrification scheme
is completed, that the railway passenger
journey figures will indicate a progres-
sive upward trend. Turning to freight
traffic, New South Wales is easily first,
the 14,950,516 tons being almost double
the corresponding Victorian figure and
four times that of the three other main-
land systems. Tasmanian freight traffic
totals no more than 684,861 tons. New
South Wales also takes first place with
livestock tonnage, the figure being
742,611, against Victoria?s 489,012 and
Queensland?s 464,199. South Australian
livestock tonnage is 153,813, Western
Australia 95,787, and Tasmania 22,100.
The average train-miles per average
mile of railway are the highest in New
South Wales (4,342), and the lowest in
Western Australia (1,347), Victoria,
South Australia, Tasmania and Queens-
land being placed intermediately in the
order given. Both in Queensland and
Western Australia there are, of course,
areas very sparsely populated, and the
scanty (but sufficient) train service to
those places detrimentally affects the
figures.
Capital Costs and Operating Ratios.
Some interesting variations are to be
noted in the capital costs of the Aus-
tralian railway systems. New South
Wales is easily at the top in this re-
spect, her figure of �93,355,167 repre-
senting �16,904 as the average cost per
mile open. These figures compare with
�66,253,102 (�14,939 per mile) in the
case of Victoria, and �49,711,014
(�8,230 per mile) for Queensland; and,
of course, cannot be compared critically,
for the reason that each system is on a
different gauge, while physical con-
ditions and traffic equipments vary con-
siderably. The South Australian mixed-
gauge system averages �8,900 per mile,
Western Australia �5,411, and the little
Tasmanian system �9,472. Relative to
the other 3 ft. 6 in. gauge systems, the
capital cost per mile in Tasmania seems
high, but it is abundantly accounted for
by the extremely difficult character of
the country traversed.
Tasmania has the melancholy satis-
faction of working with the highest
operating ratio?93.97 per cent.?their
position being a very serious one owing
to the small area of the country, the
sparse population, and the exceedingly
strong competition of the road motor
vehicle and coastwise steamer. On the
other hand, New South Wales has the
most satisfactory operating ratio, their
figure of 69.91 per cent, comparing with
71.20 per cent, for Western Australia,
73.83 per cent, for South Australia,
74.63 per cent, for Victoria, and 87.34
per cent, for Queensland. While some
of these working results are satisfactory
and others less so, it must be said that,
taking all the circumstances into con-
sideration, they reflect credit on the ad-
ministrations.

There are many other figures of im-

adequately to discuss the question of
Australian railways, but I will not
trouble you with them this evening. A
table of operating statistics will, how-
ever, be included in the printed report
of my paper, so that anyone desirous of
so doing may make comparisons for
himself.

Railway Organisation in Australasia
Generally speaking, there was not
until recently much real difference in
the overhead administration of the
various State railways of Australia, but
recent developments have led to marked
divergencies. Time will not permit of
lengthy analysis, but a brief review of
the question, always an important one,
may be of interest. In the first place,
the railways of each State are controlled
Australia there is a Chief and a
Railway Commissioner.
It is when one gets down to the
general administrative control that vital
changes are apparent. Working from
north to south and then over to the
west we find in Queensland, an organ-
isation essentially of an area character
?in other words, the system is divided
into four areas, each in charge of a
General Manager who has control over

the whole of the working, etc., in his
own area, subject, of course, to the
general supervision of the Railways
Commissioner.
The organisation of the New South
Wales Government Railways, until the
advent of the Fay-Raven Royal Com-
mission, was essentially a departmental
one, the only striking difference from
the traditional form of British organ-
isation being that the construction and
maintenance of permanent way and
works were the functions of separate
officers, and that the Chief Traffic
Manager had charge of both traffic
operating and commercial matters, as
was the practice some time ago on the
North Eastern Railway. Even now,
the organisation has not been changed
to any material extent, the only im-
portant point of difference being that
the system has been divided into four
areas for traffic and commercial pur-
poses, and in charge of each an Area
Commissioner has been placed. Un-
fortunately, so far as can be gathered,
the adoption of the Commission?s
recommendation in this regard has not
been carried out completely. The idea
was that an Area Commissioner should
be all-powerful in his district, and while
conforming to essential instructions for
the system as a whole, he should have
supervisory authority over the per-
manent way maintenance, locomotive
running and operating forces. But
under the present arrangement it would
seem that the Area Commissioner is
really a glorified district superinten-
dent, with little or no more real power
or authority than he had previously.
All the change has meant would seem
to be an increase in the salary list!
In Victoria they have adopted a
departmental organisation framed
generally along American lines, while
in South Australia a recent re-organisa-
tion has divided the system into a num-
ber of divisions, each in charge of a
divisional superintendent responsible
for operating and maintenance, the
technical departments continuing to
function under their own chiefs in
certain respects. Western Australia,
Tasmania, and the Commonwealth
Government adhere broadly to the de-
partmental system, while New Zealand,
which previously had a modification of
the departmental scheme, is at present
re-organising along broader lines. In-
stead of a General Manager and two
assistants, there is now a Railway
Board of three (including the chair-
man), this following a recommendation
of the Royal Commission. Certain other
changes working towards the divisional
system are also in progress. It is
not my intention to commit myself
definitely to an expression of opinion
with regard to any particular scheme
of organisation to meet Australian con-
ditions, but I am convinced that the
methods adopted in South Australia and
Queenslands, both of which, I am as-
sured, are functioning well, are worthy
of careful consideration. It is certain
that in such vast countries as those con-
tained in Australia responsible local
representation is essential, and this can-
not be secured under the purely depart-
mental system.
Railways and Politics.
One of the most serious menaces to
the successful administration of the
railways of Australia is that they are
brought far too closely into the political


game. It would require a separate
lecture to deal with the malpractices of
which I have personal knowledge if I
were to discuss the question in any
detail, so I am afraid you will have to
take my word for it that, in Australia,
politics and railways are so closely
interwoven that the railway administra-
tions are hindered on all hands, and the
whole political atmosphere is poisoned
by the use of the railway weapon. It
might not be uninteresting to give a
few examples.
Let us first consider the discussion on
the railway estimates and see what
happens. The Minister for Railways
moves that the estimates be passed, and
a debate ensues, but never by any
chance on the estimates themselves.
Some members of the opposition,
primed on some trivial railway matter
by their constituents, oppose the esti-
mates and spend valuable hours of par-
liamentary time in dealing with small
matters purely of domestic moment to
the administration. I could wish that
all here might enjoy?as I did?reading
the debates on the railway estimates for
the past three years in New South
Wales, as they could then get some little
idea of what State control and operation
of railways really means.
But that is only one side of the ques-
tion. The Government have another
pleasing little way. Would it be be-
lieved that they will order lines to be
built when the railway experts have
given overwhelming evidence to prove
that such lines will not, as far as can
be seen, ever be able to pay operating
costs, let alone cover interest? Some
bright individual conceives the idea that
a line between A and B or an extension
of XYZ line would be useful, and al-
though the Railway Department, in
their evidence before the deciding body,
show the utter impracticability of the
line from the financial point of view,
that does not deter the Government
from deciding to build it. The usual
result is that the Railway Department
is saddled with still another unre-
munerative line.
Even that does not exhaust the bene-
fits of Government control, and I would
briefly call attention to the extravagant
way in which they conduct railway con-
struction work. This question may be
considered under two heads, firstly in
regard to railways, the construction of
which the Railway Commissioners are
anxious to expedite, and, secondly, those
ordered to be built by the Government
which the Railway Department are not
keen about. In connection with the
first, insignificant sums would be voted,
and then work would have to be stopped
for a year, and in the second, it was
by no means an unusual event for the
authorities, having previously urged the
need for haste, suddenly to decide, for
certain obvious reasons, to stop the
work for a time. The result was that
in each case it was necessary for the
men and materials on the job to be
moved elsewhere and then, when a fresh
start was made, for them to be moved
back. Sometimes this happened on
several occasions?a costly way of
working, as you will realise. This
practice came in for scathing criticism
from the recent Royal Commission.
I would next refer to New South
Wales in particular. In the Official
Year Book of that State it is said that
? While the primary object of State rail-

way construction has been to promote
settlement, apart from the considera-
tion of the profitable working of lines,
the principle has nevertheless been kept
in view that the railways should be
self-supporting.? As a comment upon
this official statement, I quote the
following from a letter I received in
Sydney: ?It is heresy to utter it, but
the fact remains that the greatest in-
dustry in Australia is not wool-grow-
ing, agriculture, mining, or manufactur-
ing, but speculation in future values of
land. . . .? Most of the new lines
which show a yearly deficit on working
were politically promoted for the pur-
pose of enabling holders of land near
by to pocket an unearned increment
from would-be users of the soil. Since
Labour has become a political power
one has seen millions borrowed nomin-
ally for railway development, but really
to find well-paid work for party
hangers-on and to create temporary
? booms ? in districts where seats might
be captured and held.
If any student, I wrote when out in
Australia, would learn what the Govern-
ment ownership and operation of rail-
ways really mean, he should certainly
visit Australia and New Zealand, Let
him go with an unbiassed mind, let him
visit every State in the Commonwealth
and observe the way in which railways
are made the shuttlecock of politics; let
him study railway conditions from the
ground up, and if he then can find a
single good word to say for the national
ownership and working of the railways,
he will indeed be well blessed. A famous
American once said, ? There is too much
government in business and too little
business in government.? Cynical or
otherwise, this phrase is pecularily
applicable to the business of railroading
in Australia and New Zealand, where
the politicians exert such a control over
the railway administrations that the
latter are unable to develop along the
best lines. In New Zealand the rail-
ways are vested in the Minister for
Railways, which gives him power to
interfere in ordinary adminisitrative
matters, and while this is not the case
in the six States of the Commonwealth,
railway legislation in Australia ?or the
interpretation thereof by the politician
?affords plenty of scope for adequate
pressure to be brought on the Com-
missioners to move along certain lines.
The Sydney Bulletin, commenting
upon developments following the report
of the Royal Commission, said that
? The English experts doubtless know
a vast amount about the business man-
agement of railways, but as regards the
political engineering of railways the
doorkeepers at Parliamentary House
might easily give them points.? In
other words, tersely stated, the business
of railroading is part of the political
game, and one in which land values
play an important part.
Rates, Permanent Way and Sleeping
Cars.
Before dealing with New Zealand
there are one or two matters of Austra-
lian interest upon which I would touch.
First, in regard to rates and charges.
In a country such as Australia, where
the railways are owned by the State, it
is impossible to disassociate the con-
struction and operation of the railways
from the development and welfare of
the State, consequently the railways are


frequently used as a vehicle for the ex-
pression of Government policy. When
drought conditions or serious market
disturbances beset primary producers,
appeals are invariably made to the
Government for rebates in freight on
the commodities affected. During the
past few years a great deal has been
done to relieve the pressure upon pro-
ducers by granting substantial rebates
in railway freights on cattle, sheep,
pigs, horses, fodder, frozen meat, dairy
products, ores, etc. These concessions
amount to considerable sums annually.
With regard to traffic, broadly speak-
ing, the working is unbalanced on all
lines. The flow of traffic is generally
to the seaboard and varies according
to shipping and local requirements.
On the development side, not being
hampered as we are in Great Britain,
they have improved the structure
gauge. The standard Australian struc-
ture gauge is bigger than ours. In 1912
it was decided to depart from the
British practice in favour of one offer-
ing greater clearance facilities. All
new lines now conform to a structure
gauge of 15 ft. high from rail and allow-
ing width of stock 10 ft. 6 in.
Permanent way practice generally is
not up to British standards, though
many stretches of track are quite good.
There is a small amount of 100 lb. and
90 lb, section rail laid, and a fair
amount of 80, 75 and 71� lb. section
rails, but the great bulk of the track,
which is unchaired, is 60 lb. section and
below. Staggered joints are adopted in
certain States.
Next, with regard to sleeping cars, an
occasional subject of interest in Great
Britain. The Trans-Australian, Western
Australian, and Queensland Railways
are the only railways in Australia run-
ning second-class (equivalent to British
third) sleeping cars, but they all operate
first-class cars. The Trans-Australian
line has 33 second-class sleeping cars,
the Western Australian Railways 19,
including three composite cars, and the
Queensland Railways 21, including
three composites. Of course, the cir-
cumstances of three railways are funda-
mentally different from those operat-
ing in this country. In such widely-
scattered States journeys of forty-eight
hours and more are taken in the way
we travel on a four-hour journey, and
it is essential on the long runs to the
outback districts to provide sleeping
accommodation. So far as their first-
class sleeping cars are concerned, the
railways of Australia undoubtedly hold
a high place. Those on the Trans-
Australian line are the best, being most
comfortable two-berth compartments,
with the added advantages of a shower-
bath in each car. The facilities on the
5 ft. 3 in. gauge lines of South Australia
and Victoria, and the 4 ft. 84 in. lines
of New South Wales are also very good,
particularly in the two-berth compart-
ments, upon which the administrations
are now standardising, while, consider-
ing the restrictions of the 3 ft. 6 in.
gauge, the sleeping cars provided by the
Western Australian, Queensland and
New Zealand railways must be given
commendation. After quite recent ex-
perience of the facilities on each line,
I would go so far as to say that in every
respect the latest cars are superior to
the sleeping accommodation provided
on the American lines, utilisation of
which, to the average Briton, is a pain-
ful and embarrassing experience.


Train Services.
The distances between principal
points in Australia, time of fastest
trains, and speed are given below:?

Of course, the throughout journey

Gauge Unification in Australia.
One of the most important needs in
connection with railway development in
Australia is a definite step forward
towards the unification of gauge, at
least on the lines comprising the east-
west transcontinental route. Particu-
larly is this essential in view of the in-
tention shortly to proceed with a north-
west transcontinental line, as it would
be folly in the highest degree to per-
petuate the evil of break of gauge on
this new artery. There can be little
doubt that the comparatively sparse
transcontinental passenger and freight
traffic on the existing lines is primarily
due to the difficulties of transhipping,
and the resultant cost and delay, and
until this is remedied traffic will con-
tinue to pass by coastwise steamer
rather than by rail.
Recent news from Australia indicates
that the Federal Government is seized
with the necessity of making a definite
move towards unification. A Royal
Commission which investigated this
matter recently forcibly pointed out the
evils of the present system?or lack of
system?and indicated the progressive
step towards a remedy, but action has
so far been delayed owing in part to
lack of co-operation between the States.
Some little time ago a meeting was
held in Melbourne on this question of
gauge. The meeting had particular
reference to the north-south line, and
it is stated that an indication of the
Federal Government?s policy was given
in the announcement that the Govern-
ment was anxious to overcome South
Australia?s opposition to the construc-
tion of a new standard gauge link be-
tween Hay and Port Augusta. Ap-
parently, opposition arose from the fact
that the Commonwealth Government
had long been pledged to construct the
direct north-south line and South Aus-
tralia was pressing for this to be done.
As, however, the Sydney Morning
Herald well expressed it in a leading
article: ? The Federal Government
rightly holds that the crippling breaks
of gauge in the Australian railways
must be reformed as soon as possible
and is, therefore, opposed to assisting
the confusion by itself building more
narrow gauge track, especially on a
transcontinental route. It would, in-
deed, be a wasteful method of proceed-
ing to eradicate breaks of gauge on the
east-west line only at the price of ex-
tending the non-standard gauge on the
north-south line.?


The present standard gauge proposals
of the Commonwealth Government are
the building of a new line from a junc-
tion on the east-west line at Kingoonya,
running northwards to strike the exist-
ing Oodnadatta line at Williams? Creek
station, west of Lake Eyre. This new
line would be 150 miles in length and
would leave 120 miles of the existing
3 ft. 6 in. gauge track from Williams?
Creek to Oodnadatta to be rebuilt prior
to the further construction of standard
gauge track northwards to Alice
Springs. A second line is in contempla-
tion from Port Augusta in South Aus-
tralia to Hay, New South Wales, and as
this would leave only the one break of
gauge at Kalgoorlie for traffic between
Fremantle and Sydney it appears to be
an attractive proposition.
Traffic between Queensland and the
other States is to be facilitated by
the provision of a direct line on the
4 ft. in. gauge from the existing
Casino-Kyogle Railway in New South
Wales to South Brisbane. This railway
is now being built, and when it is com-
pleted and the Clarence River at Grafton
is bridged, there will be through com-
munciation on the standard gauge be-
tween Brisbane, Sydney and Albury on
the Victorian border. With regard to
the other side of the Continent it is not
likely that Western Australia would
favourably consider the conversion of
their 3 ft. 6 in. gauge main line from
Kalgoorlie to Perth and Fremantle un-
less they were assured of very material
assistance from the Commonwealth.
But if Australia is to have reasonable
railway mobility it is indisputable that
the conversion of this 400 miles section
will some day have to be faced.
Assuming the proposals outlined
above were carried out, Queensland,
New South Wales, South Australia,
the Northern Territory and Western
Australia would be connected by the
4 ft. in. gauge. The capitals of South
Australia and Victoria would, however,
still be disconnected from the others,
although physically connected between
themselves on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge. It
would, therefore, still be necessary for
traffic for these States to be transhipped
at Port Augusta or Quorn ?and again
at Terowie?unless the 120 miles of
3 ft. 6 in. gauge line between these
places is converted. Relief might be
obtained by carrying through the pro-
posal to introduce a third rail to enable
transcontinental stock to continue the
journey to Adelaide.
Truly, this gauge question of Aus-
tralia is a perplexing problem. For its
early mistakes ?and lack of foresight,
possibly excusable in the circumstances
?Australia will have to pay dearly, and
it is no use shirking the issue. The
4 ft. in. gauge has been accepted as
the Australian standard, and both the
Commonwealth Government and the
various States should co-operate whole-
heartedly in the effort to secure a coast-
to-coast gauge system without loss of
time.
Conditions in New Zealand.
Turning now to New Zealand ?and
I am afraid shortage of time will neces-
sitate brevity?let me say that the
geographical features of the Dominion
play a great part in the determination
of railway construction in a country
so sparsely populated. Many links be-
tween sections, at present isolated one
from another, would certainly have

been constructed had traffic possibilities
been greater, although in some cases
this work would involve relatively large
expense.
New Zealand comprises a group of
islands more than 1,000 miles long and
with an average breadth of 104 miles.
No point is more than 75 miles from the
sea. The coast line amounts to 4,330
miles. The North Island is 500 miles
long and has an area of 44,468 square
miles. The South Island is a little
longer and has an area of 58,525 miles.
The two together are slightly smaller
than Great Britain and Ireland. It has
3,085 miles of railway on the 3 ft. 6 in.
gauge.
New Zealand is a country possessing
extensive ranges of rugged mountains,
great rivers and lakes, and is, therefore,
very differently situated with regard to
railway construction than a country of
more favourable topographical features.
The numerous mountain chains and the
innumerable rivers fed by the heavy
rainfall present a tremendous obstacle
to the relatively cheap construction of
railways and probably account for the
delay in connecting links that will ob-
viously have to be constructed some
time or other. Already the New Zea-
land railways include 2,472 bridges and
viaducts, representing over 48 miles,
and 27 miles of tunnel, and when the
lines at present under construction are
completed, these figures will be in-
creased substantially.
There are many proposals afoot for
railway extensions and improvements,
and the general scheme of development
is to be commended from the point of
view of railway consolidation. At the
same time a country such as New
Zealand, with a population less than
1,850,000, cannot afford railway
luxuries, and must be content for the
present, with due regard to real neces-
sities, to work in the direction of con-
solidating railway interests and of
cheapening railway transport rather
than that of developing new lines of
problematical value, or of formulating
ambitious schemes of railway improve-
ment in districts insufficiently developed
to warrant the expenditure.
On the 31st March, 1925, the New
Zealand Government railway system
comprised 3,085 miles open for traffic,
the system being divided into seven
separate and disconnected sections.
Three of these sections are in the North
Island and four in the South Island,
there being no through communication
between the two islands. In the North
Island the system extends as far north
as Opua and Okaihau, these being
situated respectively 605 miles and
618 miles from Wellington, the head-
quarters of the Railway Department.
In the North Island there are two
avenues of communication between
east and west, one via Frankton Junc-
tion and the other via Palmerston
North. In the South Island, apart from
the three short isolated sections in the
Westport, Nelson and Picton areas, the
railways begin at Parnassus, 82 miles
from railhead on the Picton section,
and are concentrated on Christchurch,
Dunedin, and Invercargill, the only
means of communication between the
east and west being via the Otira
Tunnel, this connecting the Greymouth
section of the railway with the re-
mainder of the South Island system
below Parnassus. The south-eastern


sector of the South Island possesses a
number of branches, some of which are
unprofitable and are likely to remain so
for many years to come. From Parn-
assus, the northern extremity of the
main line system in the South Island to
Bluff, the southern extremity, the dis-
tance is 467 miles. Less than fifty miles
of line are double-tracked. Sidings
account for 835 miles, so the mileage,
reduced to single track, is 3,942.
During the year ended 31st March,
1924, the Railway Department carried
28,436,475 passengers, while freight
traffic amounted to 6,925,517 tons.
The total revenue for the year 1923-
24 was �6,984,211, and the working
expenses �5,403,766, thus leaving
�1,580,445 to cover the amount required
to meet interest on loans. The percent-
age of working expenses to receipts was
77.37 in 1923-24.
The lecturer then took the audience
for a tour, aided by lantern slides, from
a point north of Brisbane in Queens-
land, down through New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia, across
the Trans-Australian line through
Western Australia, thence to Tasmania,
and finally through the North and South
Islands of New Zealand down to Bluff,
the most southerly railway station in
the world.
Space considerations prevent the
whole of his remarks being given, but
notes of special interest are included
herein for reference purposes.
Queensland is a State with a length from
north to south of 1,300 miles, a breadth of 800
miles and a coast line of 2,250 miles. The
area is 668,497 square miles, or almost twelve
times the area of England and Wales. A
range of mountains named the Dividing Range
extends the whole length of the country from
north to south and presents an obstacle to
railway communication. The railways com-
prise over 6,000 miles of line, and as the
population of the State is 845,000, this repre-
sents about 140 per mile of railway. There
is a main line section along the coast, over
1,300 miles in length. For some years now
the Queensland Railways have been operating
at a huge annual deficit, the activities of suc-
cessive Labour Governments probably having
something to do with this.
The Railways of New South Wales, unlike
any other in Australia except the Common-
wealth Trans-Continental line, are on the 4ft.
81in. gauge, and 5,523 miles are open for
traffic. The extreme length of the state is
900 miles, and its extreme breadth 850 miles.
The total area is 310,700 square miles, about
2\ times the size of Great Britain and Ireland,
or equal to Great Britain and France joined
together. The population is 2,247,572, of
which over 1,000,000 are in Sydney. In New
South Wales the comprehensive suburban
electrification scheme in the Sydney area, the
construction of cross-country connecting lines,
the modern signalling installations, and the
new locomotive and carriage works at
Chullora, give abundant signs of development
as required to meet the growing demands of
traffic. Reference should also be made to the
part of New South Wales (and Queensland) in
the building of the Kyogle-South Brisbane
line, which, when completed, will give a
through line on the standard gauge between
Sydney and Brisbane, and so avoid the change
at Wallangarra, while accelerating the transit
by five hours.
Victoria, the most compact State in the Com-
monwealth, and second in importance from the
railway point of view, is fortunate in many
respects. While her traffic conditions are not
ideal, she is much better off than her con-
temporaries in being more homogeneous. This
State forms the south-eastern corner of Aus-
tralia, and at its extreme points is 240 miles
long and 250 miles in breadth. Its area is
87,884 square miles, somewhat less than Great
Britain, and her population is 1,657,095, of
which 900,000 are in Melbourne. The mileage
of railway open for traffic is 4,391, all on the
5 ft. 3 in. gauge, except for 122 miles on the
2 ft. 6in. gauge. One special advantage in
common with South Australia, Victoria shares
as against the other States, is that the capital
cities of Melbourne and Adelaide are con-
nected by the same railway gauge.
The special feature about the Victorian
railways is the electrically operated service
round Melbourne, of which Victoria has every
reason to be proud. It is certainly a most
efficient instrument of transport. The service
is admirable, and it has had such an effect


on stimulating passenger traffic that it has
now become necessary for the trains to be
strengthened and for a more intensive service
to be operated on many lines. Flinders Street
station handles 250,000 people daily, while
2,300 trains pass through. At the three
stations 324,000 people are handled. The ad-
ministration is now considering the complete
electrification of certain branch lines outside
the Metropolis.
South Australia and the Northern Territory
which may well be considered together, as
until a comparatively recent date they were
one, represent, with the exception of Western
Australia, the largest section of the Common-
wealth. Together they comprise an area more
than seven times the size of the United King-
dom. South Australia has a population of less
than 600,000, of which 280,000 are in Adelaide.
In the Northern Territory there are only 200
miles of railway on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, this
belonging to the Commonwealth Government,
but in South Australia proper there are 1,190 i
miles of 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, and 1,261 miles of
3 ft. 6 in. gauge.
In South Australia development schemes are
being pressed forward with vigour, and it is
especially pleasing to notice the complete way
in which all the improvements will dovetail
into each other to form a virile whole. In
order to handle traffic in a more economical
manner, a large number of 30- and 40-ton cars
are now being placed in service, and so that
these may be handled at a minimum cost,
large engines are being provided. Hence, it
becomes necessary if the utmost efficiency is
to result for up-to-date locomotive depot facili-
ties to be installed, and together with the com-
plete reconstruction of Adelaide station and
the principal locomotive shops at Islington,
this work is now in progress. Where
necessary, moreover, the tracks and bridges
are being strengthened so that there shall be
no restriction upon the full utilisation of the
heavier equipment. Additional lengths of line
are being equipped with electrical signalling,
and the area of train control is being rapidly
extended.
The State of Western Australia has an area
of 975,920 square miles, or about eight times
the size of Great Britain and Ireland. The
ponulation is 364,000. Its railways are on the
3 ft. 6 in. gauge and have a present mileage
of 3,609, this including a 400-mile stretch of
main line from Kalgoorlie to Perth and Fre-
mantle, which forms part of the East-West
transcontinental route.
Tasmania is an island nearly as large as
Ireland and is situated at the southern ex-
tremity of Australia, from which it is divided
by Bass Straits, 120 miles wide. In climate it
is the most temperate of the Australian States.
The population is many thousands short of a
quarter of a million. It has 638 miles of rail-
way on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge.
Near Wellington, in New Zealand, the
Rimutaki incline presents an obstacle to
economical traffic working. This incline be-
tween Cross Creek and Summit is three miles
in length on a grade of one in fifteen. As it
is impracticable to work it by adhesion, a
third rail, on the Fell system, for gripping and
braking has to be maintained. Maximum load
per engine is 60 tons dead weight, or about
20 tons actual traffic. Frequently four engines
are employed to lift one train. Minimum time
for journey is forty minutes, but with mar-
shalling and re-marshalling of train one and
one-third hours is required. Proposals are on
foot to abolish this incline by the building of
a tunnel five miles long at a cost exceeding
one million. As, however, this would cut
travel distance, and on mileage scale of charg-
ing adopted in New Zealand would lead to loss
of revenue, there has been delay.
One of the biggest works ever undertaken
by the New Zealand Government Railways
was the piercing of the Arthur?s Pass?Otira
Tunnel. This was opened in 1923 and is the
Empire?s longest tunnel. It is five miles 554
yards long, and is single line on a grade of 1
in 33. It cost �1,500,000, the electrified section
being nine miles long. The difficult character
of the country will be appreciated from the
fact that in one length of nine miles on the
approach to the tunnel there are 17 other
tunnels besides three steel viaducts, one of
which carries the railway 236 feet above the
gorge. Three-position colour light signals are
used on this section.
Concluding, Mr. Travis said: In
spite of all their difficulties the railway
administrations of Australia and New
Zealand must be held to have developed
their systems in a marked degree during
the past few years. Hundreds of miles
of line have been built?some con-
structed owing to ? political necessity,?
still almost barren of traffic or reason-
able prospect of traffic?while many
large schemes of development are either
in course of progress or are projected
for early attention. Moreover, great
improvements are being effected both in
facilities and service by the provision of
up-to-date equipment and plant.


Still, the railways of the Antipodes
have many big problems to solve. In
every State there are scattered links
which must be joined up to the main
line before they can prove of real value,
and as the intervening country is
usually of a different character, heavy
engineering works are needed. Again,
many of the principal arteries of the
various systems have been developed to
serve particular seaports, and in view
of the present-day tendency towards de-
centralisation, new connecting lines are
essential. That they will go ahead there
is no question, always assuming they
are not too severely troubled by the
politicians. They all want placing on a
business basis, and then with adequate
settlement there is no doubt that the
railways of Australia and New Zealand,
despite disadvantages inseparable from
their position, will be able to work
steadily to a brighter era. The railway
officers are sound, and if the politicians
will merely leave them alone, which I
sorely doubt, they can be depended upon
to develop their systems on lines offer-
ing the best results from railway work-
ing, coupled with the best interests of
the various countries. As for the chief
administrators of the systems of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand, I am proud to
know them personally. They are, to use
an Aussie colloquialism, a ? bonzer ? set
of boys. (Applause.)

Discussion.
The Chairman : Ladies and Gentlemen, ?
Probably few if any of us have yet had an
opportunity to visit the Antipodes, except, of
course, Mr. Travis and Mr. Warren-King. Mr.
Travis has taken us, in the limited time at
his command, on a trip over the enormous
lengths of railway he has described, and with
his descriptions and the aid of the pictures on
the screen, the journey has been exceedingly
interesting. I fancy the impression left on our
minds after what we have seen is the vastness
of the areas of the countries of Australia and
New Zealand and the extraordinary smallness
of their population.
With regard to the railways, the conditions
and circumstances affecting them are perhaps
more or less similar to those affecting our own
railways at home. They have had the same
questions to consider: electrification; mixed
gauges, which we put right in this country
many years ago; and high capacity wagons;
but Mr. Travis did not refer to the question
of road motor competition, which is assum-
ing so much importance with us here. I do
not know if this is a burning question in
Australia. It is interesting, of course to find
that our friends on the other side are exercis-
ing their minds on similar questions to those
which affect us.
I am sure we are much indebted to Mr.
Travis for giving us the benefit of his experi-
ences, observations, and views in his most in-
teresting and entertaining lecture.
I do not think the lecture is one calling for
much discussion in the way of debate, but if
any of you desire to ask questions or make
comments, I am sure Mr. Travis will be pleased
to hear them.
Mr. Wheeler : Mr, Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen, ?I am sure it has been a great
pleasure to us, and everyone here has listened
with great interest to Mr. Travis. There are
one or two questions I should like to ask.
Mr. Travis dealt with the financial aspect of
the railways, and referred to the great losses
they sustained. How do they raise their
money? Do they get it in the way of a loan
guaranteed by the Government, and is it paid
for at a fixed rate of interest, or does the
money come out of the Government Ex-
chequer? In this country in the past the rail-
ways had great financial difficulties, and Mr.
Travis will know one of those lines very well.
It seems to me that while in this country the
loss was borne by the individual shareholder,
in Australia it is shared by the community in'
general.
In connection with the administration of the
railways he referred to the Commissioner. Is
this gentleman the head of the railway service
and distinct from the Government, or is he
really the representative of the Government?
In regard to the capacity of the wagons, the
pictures seemed to show that the wagons were
very large, and I should like to know the
capacity of those used for the grain traffic on
the different sections.


In those portions of the country where the
climate is very hot, are insulated wagons used
for the purpose of conveying the dairy pro-
duce, and if so, are they satisfactory?
I should appreciate any information on these
points.
Mr. Gale : I should like to ask Mr. Travis
firstly, whether in his travels he passed over
the railway known as the Great Northern Rail-
way of South Australia which, starting from
the eastern end of the Trans-Continental Line,
runs northward along the western side of
Lakes Eyre and Torrens through Oodnadatta
towards the Northern Territory. Has the
building of this line resulted in any develop-
ment of the district it runs through?
Some years ago one train per fortnight
sufficed for the traffic on the northern portion
of it.
Secondly, can Mr. Travis say whether the
Otira Tunnel has justified its building, having
regard to the very heavy cost of construction,
which was increased by the constant labour
troubles which arose.
Is there now any very great bulk of through
traffic between the Greymouth and Christ-
church sections via the tunnel?
A Member : In my opinion perhaps the most
interesting part of the lecture would have
been that portion which Mr. Travis found it
necessary to cut out owing to pressure of time,
and that is in regard to the political question.
Some of the people in this country turn to-
wards the nationalisation of railways, and in
Australia we have an exact nationalisation
of railways in operation, and it would have
been very interesting to the members present
to learn what bearing politics has on the rail-
ways in Australia.
Reply to Discussion.
Mr. Travis : I thank you very much for
the hearty vote of thanks you have accorded
me, and will just reply briefly to the points
raised, as my voice, which unfortunately
failed me yesterday, is nearly breaking.
The Australian railways generally are faced
with severe motor competition, which is as bad,
if not worse, than that encountered by the rail-
ways in this country. In many parts of Aus-
tralia there are no roads suitable for motors,
but in the neighbourhood of the main centres
of population it is possible, with the high-
powered American cars in general use, to com-
pete effectively over distances up to sixty
miles. In New Zealand, where most of the
roads run parallel to the railways, motor com-
petition is very great, and the Minister for
Railways recently introduced a new branch
with the specific object of combating road com-
petition.
One speaker asked whether there was a com-
pulsory retiring age at an early stage in Aus-
tralasia. I think in Australia it is generally
about 60, but in New Zealand the Minister of
Railways recently decreed that all railway
officers should retire after forty years? service,
and it is a fact that many really good and
active railway officers have been retired under
that decree. It seems somewhat unfair in view
of the fact that if one man joined the service
from overseas at 20 he could stay on until he
was 60, whereas a national joining the service
at 14 or 15 would be retired compulsorily at
54 or 55 years of age.
The question of railway finance in Australia
was raised, and I am afraid that I can do no
more than briefly comment upon this, as there
is sufficient material in the question for a
separate lecture. Briefly, however, it may be
explained in this way. The State borrows the
money and so much of it, usually nothing like
the amount required, is given to the railways.
Assuming the money has been borrowed by the
Government at 4 per cent., and later the Gov-
ernment borrows further monies at 5 per cent.,
thus raising the average interest on loan
monies, the railways have to pay the higher
rate. In other words, they do not pay the
actual interest on the proportion of the loans
allocated to them, but on the average interest
for the State loans generally. The Govern-
ment, therefore, under present circumstances,
makes a bit out of the railways.
Mr, Wheeler : But if the railways do not
pay, by whom is the loss borne?
Mr. Travis : In that case the loss is, of
course, borne by the taxpayer.
With regard to administration, upon which
one speaker commented, the Commissioner of
an Australian State Railway, while the ad-
ministrative head of his system, is responsible
to Parliament through the Minister of Rail-
ways, who naturally has ways and means of
ensuring that his policy shall be followed to
some extent. In New Zealand, however, the
railways are vested in the Minister for Rail-
ways who can, therefore, interfere in matters
of administration. With regard to detailed
administration, and considering the circum-
stances of New South Wales in particular, the
Chief Commissioner virtually has absolute
power, although there are also two Assistant
Commissioners. In other words, whatever de-
cision is arrived at by the two Assistant Com-
missioners, the Chief Commissioner can veto
it and have his own way.
High capacity wagons in Australia are of
various tonnage capacities, but approximately
30 and 40 tons. In some States they are now
developing 50-ton wagons for grain traffic.


One gentleman asked a question with regard
to the Oodnadatta railway. This runs some
hundreds of miles into the heart of South
Australia and traverses a barren area where
there is practically nothing to see. As, more-
over, the train service is about once fortnightly
I did not have an opportunity of travelling
over it. Central Australia, to which the Ood-
nadatta line gives access, was reported by
Steffanson, the Swedish explorer, as a land
flowing with milk and honey, but competent
Australians consider that he was quite wrong.
It has been said that this area will be found
productive in due course, but it seems very
doubtful owing to the shortage of water.
Another speaker asked whether the Otira
tunnel in the South Island of New Zealand
had obtained sufficient traffic to pay for its
construction. I am afraid that it has not, as
so far, the amount of traffic secured to the
railway from the coastwise steamers has not
been very great. This connection, secured at
great expenditure, between the South Island
main line and the Greymouth section, has un-
doubtedly been justifiable, and in future will
be of the utmost value.
The following points subsequently
raised by members have been replied to
by Mr. Travis as shewn :?-
Questions.
(1) Inter-State Through Bookings.
Do through bookings operate, either for pas-
senger or merchandise, or both, between the
railway systems of the various States, i.e., is
it possible to book through or send traffic at
through rates from, say, Perth to Melbourne,
or Adelaide to Brisbane? If so, can you tell
us what is, the method of apportionment of re-
ceipts between the various systems, i.e., is it
upon a mileage basis or pro rata to local fares
and rates, and is such apportionment affected
by any central State organisation approximat-
ing to our Railway Clearing House?
(2) Basing of Rates and Fares.
Is the Australian practice to fix these on a
mileage basis or zone system, or how?
(3) Petrol Rail Motor Operation,
About 1919 or 1920 a petrol rail motor
vehicle was placed into operation upon the
Lismore-Grafton section of the New South
Wales Railways. This section is, we believe,
isolated, or then was, from the main system.
This vehicle was constructed by the simple ex-
pedient of taking a road motor lorry, fitting
it with flanged wheels, and converting it into
a passenger vehicle to carry about thirty pas-
sengers, a trailer also being attached for the
carriage of milk churns, dairy produce, and
other similar traffic of the district.
The late Lord Northcliffe during his Empire
post-war tour, was apparently impressed by
this type of vehicle, and if we remember
rightly, mentioned it in one of his articles in
the Daily Mail.
Some few years back the Railway Magazine,
we think, briefly mentioned the vehicle, point-
ing out its extremely economical cost of opera-
tion, mentioning that the running expenses per
train mile were very low compared with the
receipts per train mile (somewhere about 1/3
as compared with 4/-). It was suggested that
Answers.
(1) Through bookings operate both for
passengers and goods between the railways of
the various States. In connection with freight
traffic, however, if the consignors desire it they
can send their traffic to accredited tranship-
ping agents at the border stations. The
method of apportionment is to divide the re-
ceipts between the two or three States in-
volved according to mileage, and settlements
are effected by their own departments, there
being nothing approximating to the British
Railway Clearing House.
(2) This is a difficult question to answer
because in Australia there are so many varia-
tions from the mileage basis. In regard to
passenger traffic each capital city and other
large centres of population, such as Newcastle,
have a suburban area extending to 34 miles
from the centre, in the case of New South
Wales, wherein the mileage fares are lower
than the country fares. Generally, however,
apart from these suburban fares, the mileage
basis of charging is adopted in connection with
passenger fares. With regard to freight
traffic, tapering rates have necessarily to be
adopted in order to enable those producers
many of hundreds of miles from the distribut-
ing centres to be given an equal chance with
those located in more favourable geographical
positions. In articles on the railways of Aus-
tralia published in The Railway Gazette from
October 30th to December 18th, reference to
these rates will be given in detail.
(3) The petrol rail motor vehicle mentioned
is still in operation on the isolated Grafton-
Murwillambah section of the New South Wales
Railways. Originally running as stated be-
tween Lismore and Grafton it is now running
from Grafton to Murwillambah. The results
of its working were so satisfactory that the


the State were, as a result, going to further
develop this type of vehicle. Did you have any
opportunity during your tour of inspection of
getting any data upon this subject? The point
we, of course, have in mind is as to whether
such a light and cheaply-operated type of
vehicle could not be effectively used upon
branch lines in this country to meet road com-
petition, from which these now suffer so
severely.
(4) Rail Connection with Canberra.
It was stated in one of the daily newspapers
one or two years back, that no railway con-
nection had been made with Canberra, the
Commonwealth capital, but as far as we can
judge by the large panorama of the new city
in the Australian Pavilion at Wembley, the
railway runs to or near the city. Can you
please say if Canberra is yet rail connected,
as it would seem absurd that the official head-
quarters of the Commonwealth should be with-
out the principal means of land communica-
tion.
(5) Water Competition.
Is this an important factor in either Aus-
tralia or New Zealand? From the map of
Australia shewn on the screen, the railways
in the main follow the seaboard and, owing
to the lack of gauge uniformity necessitating
transhipments, there seems every probability
a live ? Port-to-Port ? sea competition exists.
Water transit is always considered cheaper
than rail or road, and in the Antipodes it has
advantages not enjoyed in other countris. For
example, to send goods from, say, Brisbane to
Perth by rail, many transhipments have to be
reckoned with in basing a through rate, and
in consequence amounts to cover a terminal
service at each transhipping point would ap-
parently be added to any mileage charge. By
sea, two terminals only are involved ?except-
ing any rail haulage to or from ports.
Some delay in connecting trains must take
place at change of gauge points on the rail
journey, whereas the boats, although maybe
like the tortoise, steadily plod along the whole
time.
Also is there any canal or river competition
in either country as we understand it here?
Railway Commissioners decided to develop the
scheme. For the ten months ending April,
1924, the working expenses per mile were
12.3d., and the gross earnings per mile 29.6 d.
There are now six rail motors operating upon
the railways of New South Wales, the aggre-
gate results for the six motors being, expenses
per mile 16d., and earnings per mile 30.5 d.
During the ten months ending April, 1924,
they covered 37,000 miles.
With regard to the general question, a num-
ber of rail motor vehicles were introduced
recently in South Australia and have been
instrumental in developing passenger and light
parcels traffic very considerably. They ran
long distances from Adelaide and are con-
sidered to have done extremely valuable work.
Full details of these vehicles will be published
in the November 20th issue of The Railway
Gazette.
(4) I had the pleasure of visiting the new
capital city of Australia and reached it sub-
stantially by rail. The Commonwealth Railway
now owns four miles 75 chains between
Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) and Canberra,this length
being managed and maintained by the State
of New South Wales for and on behalf of the
Commonwealth.
(5) Obviously water competition so far as
coastwise steamship services are concerned is
extremely troublesome to the railways of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. Owing to the tran-
shipments necessary on the railways between
any two capitals (excluding Melbourne and
Adelaide), the traffic is more cheaply handled
by sea, and there can be little doubt that rail-
way traffic development has been largely
hindered owing to the break of gauge. In New
Zealand, moreover, as there is no place more
than 75 miles from the seaboard, coastwise
steamer competition has proved an effective
competitor as against the railway. Addi-
tionally, there are many fine ports all con-
nected with railways which necessarily lose a
lot of their traffic and simply secure it for
short distances, and consequently more or less
unremunerative haulage. There is very little
canal or river competiton, as we understand it.
