tIUBIEEE ODE
In Commemoration of the Fiftieth Year of Her Majesty?s Reign,
HENRY HALLORAN, C.M.G.
In the heavens above is a glory serene;
On the earth is a joy that extends far and wide, ?
For the hearts of the loyal, with passionate pride,
And with jubilant shouts, name the name of The Queen !
Over land, over sea,
?Tis a great J �bilee,
And blessings fall thick on the name of The Queen,
The ? May flower? that was sweet of old, ?
A dream of girlhood?s loveliness, ?
Lies still in Britons? hearts like gold,
And swells their voices as they bless
Victoria, their gracious Queen,
Whom they for fifty years have seen, ?
A light that never turned away ;
And so, on this triumphant day,
For what thou art and long hast been,
Victoria! they turn to Thee !
And bless Thee, in this Jubilee.
[?]


They turn to those days of thy girlhood again,
And see the fair flower of their glorious land ;
The power of kings, who for ages held reign,?
Now centred and clasped in thy maidenly hand ;
The chivalrous heart, in its homage, bows down
To the fair face that smiles at the weight of a crown;
And all that is loyal and manly unite
In devotion to Her whose proud right is Her might.
The blessings of a cloudless day
Before Her path made holiday;
The flowers sprang beneath Her tread ;
The bright sun shone above Her head ;
And Love came soon to bless Her name, ?
For what were Sovereign state missing a woman?s claim ?
O ! years that came and went
With sweet content
When peerless Albert, in his conscious soul,
Found the immaculate peace of Love?s control
And thro? serenest days of golden hours
Dreamed highest dreams of human happiness ;
And with a Scholar?s and a Christian?s powers
Taught monarchs how their fellow-men to bless.
Those days have gone,
Yet lives She not alone ;
The presence of the Saint She breathes in still;
Blessed in fond memories, ?bowed to Heaven?s high will.


The shadowless days are around,
And a dream that is dearer than day,
With a silvery sound
As of fountains unbound,
Makes bright, as with sunshine, the way;
And utters the words that are dear to Her ear ?
? I am with Thee by night and by day.?
The past wreathes the present with flowers that still
All the sweets of their earlier spring-tide distil.
Let the eye of the gazer pass over its path,
And behold the proud progress the Nation has made;
In Science and Learning what triumphs it hath, ?
What mighty success in its Commerce and Trade:
It speaks with the peoples however remote; ?
The lightning bears thought over mountain and main;
The nerves of the Nation ?they smite, as they smote ?
Thro? the world speak the will of the national brain ;
And the wanderer afar, in his wonder, may read,
?Ere yet it is wrought, of each marvellous deed.
VIII.
The might of the Nation has grown ;
The voice which was stifled or still,
Or in bonds, to the people in freedom, unknown,
Now speaks with a dominant will,
And a power in the councils which govern the State,
And conspire to make it united and great.
r 31


In the populous East our great Empire has spread;
In the West new Dominions appear,?
Dominions that stand in their might, without dread;
The Pacific cries, ? Come, Britons, here !?
? Let the acorns be planted,?the dominant race
For the future assume, as in duty, its place.?
While the great Southern Colonies, marrow and bone
Of the glorious Motherland, cleave to the Throne ;
Tho? proud of themselves, yet as proud still to be
The subjects of Britain ?tho? equally free, ?
And of Her, our loved Queen, at whose magical name,
Men are stirred, with a transport of national fame:
While the names of their Milton and Shakspere hold sway
In the hearts of our young, as of men who are gray.
Poised in the stainless ether, men behold,
In characters of gold,
Prefigured signs of wonders yet to be,
When Science reads the marvels of the sea, ?
Its fathomless depths irradiate by light?
On mirrors , what may startle mortal sight!
The lightning?s power may drive aerial ships
From Morning?s gate to where the red sun dips,
And to our wondering eyes lay bare,
What vast subjacent lands still hold, in fond despair.


And greater still, may modern Keplers trace
Within the clouded mirror?s mystic face, ?
Beyond the Pleiades, the stellar light
Of myriad stars that now escape our sight,
Tho? aided by the mightiest telescope
Which toils with unknown distances to cope.
Look forward fifty years, with eyelids bold,
And dream of what our grandsons may behold.
The one linked Empire spanning earth and sea,
A constellation of the powers to be,
Despite the envious breath of those who say
That Britain?s glory hastens to decay;
For faithful to herself and sons afar,
Their banded might shall hold the springs of war.
Look backward fifty years :
The laboring seaman steers
His gallant vessel baffled by the wind ;
The ship?a palace now ?in proud despite
Of Ocean?s angry might,
Speeds onward; driving waves in giant grandeur back,
And marching like a king along its track, ?
While storm and darkness fall away behind, ?
The ? Stage? that crawled along the greasy hill
With pace that almost had the power to kill ?
The Iron Horse beheld, and in dismay
O?er hill and plain began its fiery way ?
Thro? mountains fle-w, with speed that left behind
The keen pursuers, hail and storm and wind ;
Bearing its freight of jewelled Beauty bright
To Pleasure?s haunts, amidst the boisterous night,
Without one speck upon their garments rare,
Without one ruffle of their lustrous hair.
[s]


War troubles the world in its bitter unrest;
May the elements never be tranquil a day ?
A storm in the East, or a storm in the West,
Or a storm in the North, drives the sunshine away;
And the blood of the people is poured out, like rain,
In the madness of conquest, the madness of gain?
Are the Nations still stirr?d by the instincts of Cain ?
War still smites the earth with a terrible rod,
For the madness of man is the judgment of God.
But far as the banner of Britain has blown ?
And far as her sons have contended in fight?
They ever, as brave men, have stood for their own?
They ever, as true men, have struck for the right;
And what they can do they at Alma have shown,
And proud Balaclava their daring may cite,
Or repeat, when the gates of Herat need their might!
XIII.
When blood is congested, the cancer at bay,
The leech has his terrible office to heal:
The merciful knife cleaves the evil away;
His office were vain did he shrink from the steel.
War is not a game for grown children to play ;
And the right must be held, tho? the terrible Sword
Comes into Man?s councils, and claims to be Lord.
Tho? all else should sink in a pitiless fate,
Every Briton must gather, with heart and with hand,
United to fight for a country so great ?
United to die for the loved Motherland ?
United she stands, tho? the nations may fail ?
Divided, her beauty grows tarnished and pale.


XIV.
There is sorrow for the Dead who perish for the Living,
Tho? the Living have the gain achieved by those who die :
The Soldier has most joy, for his joy is in the giving,
And the blessing that he gives his guerdon will supply;
His red blood is the wine which his country will remember
When the suns of June look down on his solitary grave;
Or when the howling winds of a pitiless December
Sweep the guarded shores of Britain with its defiant wave.
They gave their lives ungrudging, as the Widow in old story
Gave ?her all,? two ?mites,? nor grudged she all her princely bounty gave;
Their names, like Gordon?s name shall live, in chronicles of glory?
The memory should never die, ?midst brave men, of the Brave.
How the remember?d sweets of England?s May,
Caught in a boy?s brain seventy years ago,
May waken love on this propitious day,
These random rhymes may tell to friend and foe.
XVI.
The Lord be praised !
The ? May flower? still is there ;
The radiant June
Leads on bold summer with his shoulders bare,
And brow upraised,
To the gay sun and to the mellow moon.
Still does Victoria reign
Over the brave and free,
In many lands,
Who, with uplifted hands,
And hearts upraised,
Keep Jubilee,
And bless Her name again.


XVII.
Then let the peaceful cannon thunder
In Thy name ? Victoria !?
Strike the nations round with wonder, ?
She is our Queen Gloria !
Time the union may not sunder,
Gloria! Victoria!
We, the men across the sea,
Raise our loyal hearts to Thee
On this joyful Jubilee,
Victoria! Victoria !
God in His great mercy shield Thee, ?
Earth its choicest blessings yield Thee, ?
Let our one great prayer still be
Every blessing fall on Thee
And Thy People great and free,
On this joyful Jubilee, ?
Victoria! Victoria!
Mowbray,
21 June , 1886.
