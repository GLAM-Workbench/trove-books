/?/$� /4/1/Z? PROGRESS OF QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIES.
COPPER.
The copper deposits which are so widely distributed over Qeeensland
attracted attention early in its short history. Fn the year 1861 some
of these lodes were being tested, and the official record takes note of
three mines in the Gladstone district which produced 49 tons of ore.
The trial shafts from which this ore was raised, did not apparently lead
to more permanent work, for in 1862 no copper ore appears on the list
of exports ; but the Registrar of the colony in his annual report notes
the fact that a promising lode had been discovered in the Kennedy
District?being the mine afterwards known as Peak Downs. Next year,
1863, it is recorded that 1100 tons of copper ore were exported, work
having been fairly commenced in the Peak Downs mine. Once begun
it was prosecuted steadily, a id for many years it was the only copper
lode opened in Queensland. But although the lode was large and the
ores of high per centage- including gi?eat blocks of rich malachites and
other carbonates?it was found that they could not be profitably carted
along a rough bush track for 200 miles to the port. Therefore furnaces
were erected on the spot, burning wood, and the ore smelted ; so that
the cost of carriage was diminished by carting the product only in its
most valuable shape. The mine yielded large quanties of ore but little
profit to the shareholders, as the expenses of mining consumed most of
the proceeds. But, while this was going on, copper ore was discovered
in other localities. A remarkable deposit of native copper and oxide
was found near the Cloncurry river, in the north, at a distance of over
200 miles from the Gulf of Carpentaria, The exceeding richness of this
deposit induced the discoverers to make an effort to work it in spite of
its inaccessible situation and the wild country intervening between it
and the coast. The attempt, of course failed. The ore was all that
could be desired, but it only sold for enough to pay the fancy rates of


carriage demanded by the bullock drivers, together with the expenses of
working and shipment. Copper was also discovered at Mount Perry on
the upper Burnett and at Kilkivan on the northern watershed of the
Mary. The prospectors could not, however, induce capitalists to assist
them ; the experience of Peak Downs was not encouraging, and the in-
difference lasted till about 1870, when the increasing price of copper in
the European market called attention to the Queensland deposits.
Some Sydney capitalists determined to work the lode at Mount Perry,
and sent up a staff of miners to begin operations. A company had been
formed on a plan afterwards adopted in many subsequent cases, which
caused a disastrous check to the progress of the industry. A cash
capital of �6500 was made to do duty fora share list nominally amount-
ing to �60,000. In the case of Mount Perry the capitalists who had
taken up the shares supplied the deficiency by guaranteeing a bank
credit, and the extraordinary richness of the ores, together with the high
price ruling for copper did the rest. The mine was worked to a profit,
in spite of the long land carriage to port, and in a few years the bank
credit was covered and dividends amounting in the aggregate to nearly
three times the cash capital returned to the shareholders from the produce
of the lode. The commencement of operations at Mount Perry was the
signal for an outburst of mining activity, or to speak more correctly of
mining speculation, which was increased by the discovery of tin near the
southern border. The copper deposits in the Wide Bay and Burnett dis-
tricts, of which the existence had been previously known and disregarded,
were eagerly sought for. In all directions land containing mineral-lodes
was taken up and company after company floated to work them. In all
these cases the same fatal plan was followed of subscribing a small cash
capital and loading it with an enormous mass of paid up shares. As
instances, the Normanby Company may be mentioned, with a cash
capital of �SO 0, and 80,000 nominal shares of �1 each ; the Victoria
with i' 6,500, and 100,000 shares; and the Mount Clara with �1,200,
and 40,000 shares. But these were only single instances. The largest
actual capital subscribed in any case was about �15,000, but most of the
companies were formed on a far less substantial basis. And to add to
the prevailing frenzy, the original Peak Downs mine, which had been
working on steadily for many yeax-s, gave a dividend in 1872, equal to
about 75 per cent, on the whole of the very large capital invested in it,
a dividend produced in a, great measure by neglecting necessaxy explor-
ations and taking out all the ore within reach for the furnaces. The
prices of shares of all descx-iptions went up to absurd figui?es. The �1
shai?e of the Mount Perry mine sold for over 405., representing a value
for a property in which barely �13,000 had been expended of over
�120,000. JNox?manby shares sold for over 305., Mount Clara for 10s.,
representing values of �120,000 and �20,000, for properties in which
�5,000 and �1,200 had been expended, and which had neither paid a
dividend, nor appeared likely to pay one. In the year mentioned?-1872
?smelted copper to the value of �234,540, and ox-e worth �23,183 was
exported, and no less than 2148 mineral selections were taken xxp for
antimony, bismuth, cinnabar, copper, coal, galena, ii?on, kerosene shale,


opals, silver, tin, zinc, and plumbago. The ? flush times ? of California
were reproduced on a small scale, and each selection as soon as marked
of, became a marketable commodity, portions selling freely at prices fixed
almost entirely by the excited imaginations of buyers.
Of course there could be only one ending to this outbreak of mad spec-
ulation. Not only was a capital which might have sufficed to put two
or three copper mines into permanent working order spread over twenty
different lodes, but in almost every case work was begun on the most
lavish scale, with all the paraphernalia of high salaried managers, &c.
In one case after another the money originally subscribed, together with
whatever advances the company could secure on their property, was ex-
hausted, leaving the lode opened up and partly explored, but with no
means of utilizing the mineral. The enormous mass of nominal shares
floated by each company precluded them from raising funds to go on, and
the general reaction from the frenzy of share gambling forbade the hope
of obtaining exceptional assistance from investors. The singular result
followed, that while funds had been freely forthcoming to open unex-
plored mineral country, none could be obtained to work proved lodes.
Besides, the exceptional price ruling for copper had begun to fall, so
that one by one the whole crop of new mining enterprises, which had
sprung mushroom-like into existence, withered and faded away. The
mines were sold for nominal prices and shut up, the companies went into
liquidation and the shareholders, deploring their losses, were apt to
attribute them not to their own blind folly, but to the mineral lodes
which had been, not the subject of their investment, but the counter's in
the big game of speculation which they had been playing. And this was
not the worst result that followed from the general excitement of that
period, for the managers of the established mines, spurred on to create
big dividends, had concentrated their energy in the exhaustion of ore
that had been opened out, neglecting the proper exploration of the lodes
to provide for the future. They were therefore ill prepared for a fall in
the price of copper, and the shares having fallen into the hands of buyers
who purchased at the ridiculously inflated prices prevalent during the
?excitement, the holders would advance no more money. Those mines
therefore have never recovered the shock, and the present position of
this branch of our mining industry is most unsatisfactory?worse a great
deal, than it need be in spite of the low price ruling for the metal.
The present position of copper mining in the colony, though very un-
satisfactory, affords no cause for discouragement. The old mines of
Peak Downs are far from worked out, and the same may be said of
Mount Perry, although of course the low price of copper will not bear
the heavy carriage charges and the cost of smelting with wood fuel. Of
the mines in the Wide Bay and Burnett districts, it is not too much to
say that at least a dozen are now lying with abandoned shafts, in which
lodes of ore are visible, capable of yielding a very handsome return on
?capital invested in working them even at the present prices for the metal;
although certainly not rich enough to create working capital out of ore
alone. They vary greatly in character. Some are comparatively narrow
veins carrying rich ores ; others, like Mount Clara in the Kilkivan

district, are regular quarries, in which all the mining work has been
done almost without shifting a ton of rock not containing copper. The
approach of railways now being constructed, will no doubt lead to some
renewed mining activity in these localities, especially as abundant coal
has been found near the coast. But, copper lodes are found almost over
the whole colony. In the Gladstone district and in the neighbourhood
of Rockhampton, lodes have been found and explored. A mine has been
worked a short distance south of Mackay, and the ore has been found in
the country to the back of Townsville and on the Cape York Peninsula.
The great deposit of native copper and rich ores on the Cloncurry has
already been mentioned, and indications of copper ore has been found ?
though not explored?at many other points on the coast and in the
interior. In fact the very abundance of the mineral has been the chief
bar to the success of this branch of our mining industry, for it caused the
dispersion of the capital available at one time for its prosecution over too
wide a field for success. It is to be hoped that when the reaction has
worn itself out, and copper mining is again resumed, it will be conducted
in a more judicious manner. If so, it is probable that Queensland will
take the lead as a copper-producing country.
