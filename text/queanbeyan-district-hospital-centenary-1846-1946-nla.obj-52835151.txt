QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL
(Established 1846)
'IIT'E ask you to accept this booklet as a souvenir of the Hospital’s
" one hundred years of service. It does not pretend to cover every-
thing that has happened during the century which has passed since
the hospital’s establisment in 1846 but it is an authentic record of
the more Important and interesting events associated with the
Institution.
The secretary (Mr. A. K Johnston) has compiled the brochure
from the hospital minute books and other records. Unfortunately
the original minute bock (1846-1869) has been lost and consequently
the details relating to the early years of the hospital have been
obtained from the files of the “Queanbeyan Age”; other matter has
been taken from the Centenary Booklet of Queanbeyan and later
copies of the “Age.”
When we review the past we must admit that much progress has
been made during the century but this milestone should not mark a
resting point but rather serve as a foundation on which to build
another century of progressive hospital work, for I know of nothing
which is of greater service to a community than the work performed
by its District Hospital.
Warcy Vist
Chairman of Directors.




The original Minute Book of the Hospital appears to have bee»
lost and consequently it is not possible to give a list of Presidents and
Secretaries since 1846 but the record is complete from 1868 and prior
to that date the names of several occupants of the positions are know*.

QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL
CENTENARIAN SUMMARY
TN the year 1846 the village of Queanbeyan was just a halting plao*
on the journey to Monaro. There was a ford across the river,
good pastures for travelling stock and a selection of inns where the
best obtainable brews were served by jovial hosts.
Aged pioneers, fossickers servants from the various station pro-
perties would fall sick and, in many cases, die like beasts of the field
with no one to care for them or ease their pain. This state of affairs
stirred the feelings of the pioneer townsmen of that date and they
got together and formed the Queanbeyan and District Hospital Society
with the purpose of caring for those poverty stricken inhabitants of
the district who fell victims of disease.
Sufficient funds were subscribed by benevolent business men, graziers
and citizens to take a lease of a stone building in East Queanbeyan (or
Irishtown as it is better known to the older Inhabitants) and to instal
therein as Matron a Mrs Wil’iam Ruster She was paid £25 per annum
plus the cost of feeding the patients, and the rent of the cottage wais
£2O a year. Although the expenses were so small, judged by our present
day standards, the amount proved a big drain on the resources of the
little band of men. whose foresight and energy made them stand out
in their day as amongst the foremost residents of the State.
Included in this early band were Doctors Hayley and Morton, the
latter remained a member of the Committee for thirty-five years, until
his death in 1881. Others whose names were actively associated with
the early years of the Hospital were Messrs. John Gale and J. J. Wright,
who were both members of Parliament later, and Messrs. W. G. O’Neill,
G. Hunt, R. Price, R. Mehegan, A. Levy, M. Twentyman, E. Walsh,
D. Jordan, W. R. McCarthy and Rev. Kavenagh. These were the leaders
of thought and action in Queanbeyan in those days.
In the first few years of the Society’s activities patients were few
and for long periods there were none at all. This is not surprising
when it is remembered that the population of the village was only 208
in, 1851. By 1861 it had increased to 682, chiefly on account of the


boom caused by the Kiandra gold rush following the discovery l»
March 1860 of two nuggets weighing 160 ozs. and 93 ozs. and in October
•f that year one weighing 400 ozs. During the rush thousands passed
through Queanbeyan on their way to the diggings. By the year 1860,
however, the work of the hospital was deemed to be of such importance
that the Society had taken steps to proceed with the construction of
the first real hospital building, and in 1862 Mr. D. Jordan erected a
stone building 74 feet by 32 feet, to accommodate 16 patients, at a cost
of £lOsl. The plan was prepared by a Mr. Downey and the stone was
obtained from Simms’ quarry in the “Honeysuckle.” This building
was used as a hospital until the present hospital was erected in 193 C
when internal alterations were effected and it was transformed into
quarters for the nurses. It remains as a monument to the faithful
construction of buildings of those days and will be used as portion of
the nurses’ home for many years to come.
In the year 1862 there were no less than 35 members on the Com-
mittee, with power to add, under the chairmanship of Mr. J. J. Wright
with Mr. John. Gale as secretary, but these two resigned office between
the annual meeting and the opening day and their places were taken
by Mr. George Campbell and Rev. A. D. Soares. There was no grand
opening ceremony but the transfer of the few sticks and chattels that
comprised the hospital furniture was quietly carried out and Matron
Rusten, with her husband as wardsman or male help, was installed in
her new quarters.
For the first year there was an income of £221/0/2 and an expen-
diture of £217/1/111, including some of the back money due to Matron.
There were 20 subscribers and the number of patients admitted during
the first year was six cf whom two died. Patients may have been
fewer in those days but they stayed longer, as the average stay of
patients was 68 days as compared with 11 to-day.
Any subscriber having the sum of £3 to his credit could be admitted
as a patient on his own application but otherwise he would have to
get three members cf the Committee to recommend his admission.
After the £3 was used up in a month, the fees were 2/6 per day and alt
patients, during their convalescence were required to assist in cleaning
the wards and apartments. The main causes cf admission were diseases
of the liver, dropsy, old age, poverty and neglect, delirium tremens,
typhoid fever, asthma and diseases of the lungs.
The chief items of income in the early years of the hospital appeared
to be pound fees and Police Court fines, both cf which were paid to
the hospital.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


In 1863 the Committee applied for Government subsidy but none'
was paid until 1865 when £5B/7/11 was sent along. By 1864 the popu-
lation had increased to such an extent as to warrant the opening of a
school, at which 44 pupils were enrolled. This year also marked the
establishment of the first telegraph communication between Quean-
beyan and other centres. For the years 1865-66-67 by a strange coin-
cidence the number of patients admitted was eleven of whom four died
each year, so that apparently in those days the chance of survival as a
hospital case was less than two to one.
There was no domestic water supply at the hospital all water being
obtained from the waterman who carted it from the river. In 1876
the Committee decided to purchase two iron ships tanks and they were
installed but, strangely enough, it was not till 1878 that tenders were
called for guttering and piping to run the roof water into the tanks.
In those early years considerable difficulty was experienced in
getting the people of the district to contribute to the hospital as they
were wont to say that the hospital was there only for the benefit of
Queanbeyan and the Annual Report for the year 1869 says “The Com-
mittee deeply regrets the apathy shown and the little interest taken
in the welfare of so desirable an institution as the District Hospital
and for further support earnestly appeal, particularly to the wealthy
section of the community and the heads of such establishments in the
district as have hitherto failed to contribute towards its support.” In
1871, however, the Annual Report says there was a “marked improve-
ment in the support afforded by the district to the hospital.”
In 1869-70-71 the number of patients were 14, 11 and 12 respectively
but after that there appears to have been a gradual rise in the number
treated and in 1877 there were 19 patients which prompted the annual
meeting held in January 1878 to sanction the appointment of an assistant
to the matron.
The large pines, oaks and elms in the hospital grounds were planted
in 1870. Round about this time the Committee appeared to be very
disinterested; they were supposed to meet quarterly but two consecutive
meetings lapsed for want of a quorum and the President never attended,
in fact for many years the position of president appeared to be a post
of honour which did not entail attendance at meetings.
In 1871 the tender of T. Jordan was accepted for the erection of
a kitchen, “including the bricking of the floor” at a price of £46/10/-.
There were apparently hospitals at Braidwood, Cooma and Kiandra in,
that year for the Committee decided to co-operate with the
in protesting against the reduction of Government aid.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


Letters of the day were couched in flowery language beginning “I do
myself the honour to Inform you” and concluding “I have the honour
to be your most obedient servant.” These courtesies were not always
carried into the meeting room, however, for the minutes disclose much
heat and not a few faction fights at committee meetings.
Reduction of Government subsidy by 50% in 1872 brought forth a
protest which pointed out that for several years past the cost of running
the hospital had been not less than, £2OO financed by £B5 in subscriptions,
etc., £B5 Government subsidy and £3O in fines and unclaimed poundages
“which latterly have considerably decreased.” The letter concluded
by advising the Government that unless the £5O set down on the
estimates was increased the hospital would close on Ist January, 1873
The move was apparently successful for the Government contributed
more than £5O and the hospital did not close.
There had been various alterations in the number of committeemen
in these earlier years and they had been reduced to six but were
increased to 12 in 1874 in which
year the Government was asked
to place £l5O on the estimates
for Queanbeyan.
On sth January, 1875, Mrs.
Rusten, who had been Matron
of the Hospital since Its incep-
tion, died In office, shortly before
her 67th birthday.
In reporting the death of the
Matron at the annual meeting
on 15th January 1875, the annual
report bore this testimonial to
her; “Of the late matron the
committee desire to speak in the
highest terms. She possessed
many estimable qualities was an
attentive, skilful nurse and a
trustworthy public servant.”
Mrs. Rusten left four children,
John, Caroline, Mary Ann ar.d
Lucy, in addition to two orphans
whose parents died in hospital
and whom she adopted.
Her husband, William, died
nine years later, aged 84 years.

Mrs. Rusten was Matron from
1846 to 1875.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


At the annual meeting in 1875 a special vote of thanks was carried'
to the Secretary for his services during the past eight years and it was-
decided to raise funds for a testimonial to him but be would have none
of it and threatened that if they started “going round cap in hand oa
his behalf, that moment he would resign.”
A washhouse and covered passage was erected in this year for
£57/10/-.
At the meeting on 12th April, 1875, the secretary reported that
“On Friday last Dr. Johnson officially reported that the matron had
returned from Goulburn with a black eye and was then under the
influence of drink.” She was reprimanded by the committee and
threatened with dismissal if a repetition should occur. Later in the
year matron was again in trouble for allegedly “tampering with the
religious views of a patient” but at a subsequent enquiry she was
cleared of the charge.
The annual meeting of 1876 voted £25 to purchase a gold watch
and chain for presentation to the secretary for services rendered; the
amount was Insufficient and later £5/17/6 was added. In April of this
year it was decided to notify local innkeepers that no bills for spirits
or wines furnished to the hospital would be paid without written orders
from the medical officers.
Dr. S. L. Richardson became associated with the hospital in 1877
and continued that association for 41 years during which period he was
one of the medical officers and also acted as secretary for several years.
In 1881 the Inspector of Charities recommended that the institution
be placed in charge of a framed nurse but this reform was not intro-
duced until some years later. During this year the Press representatives
were excluded from committee meetings as it was claimed that some
of their reports were calculated to injure the welfare of the institution
and were not a fair statement of facts. Apparently the matron In
office in 1882 would not allow the committeemen to do as they liked
around the hospital for in June of that year it is recorded that a
committeeman complained that matron had forbidden him to pick
flowers from the garden and had made use of some very insolent lan-
guage to him.
In the early eighties the usual number of patients treated each year
was 16 or 17.
Apparently there were a number of Chinese residents in those days
for in the minutes of the committee meeting held on 4th July, 1883, it
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


is recorded that the chairman reported he had casually mentioned is
Ah Way’s shop that the hospital funds were low and Ah Way had at
•nee voluntarily gone about amongst his countrymen and collected CU.
He (the chairman) thought such liberality was a credit to the Chinamen
living here. Further evidence of the philanthropic principles of the
residents at that time is obtained from the fact that a bazaar held in
April 1884 showed a net profit of £179/12/3 —quite big money in those
days.
The year 1884 was a momentous one for the district for in that
year the railway construction between Bungendore and Michelago was
being carried out. This meant extra work, worry and responsibility
for the hospital as evidenced by the fact that the patients treated
during that year rose to 42, of whom 38 were males. The railway
contractor, A. Johnston & Co., promised an annual donation of £2lO
to cover the cost of patients admitted from their works on condition
that additional furniture and other requislties were obtained for the
hospital. The offer was accepted and £IOO authorised to be spent in
this direction.
In 1885, A. Johnston & Co. increased their subsidy to £315 per
annum but the admission of patients from the construction works
seemed to be a big problem. The railway works had their own medical
officer who attended to the patients admitted from there. There were
98 patients treated during 1885 and most of these were railway con-
struction workers.
Friction between the hospital authorities and the contractors
apparently reached a climax in 1886 when, after some difference between
them, it was resolved that patients from the railway works would be
admitted only on payment of 10/- per day per patient, guaranteed by
the company. As this amount is more than the present day public
ward charge it is not to be wondered at that the company turned down
the offer and decided to make their own arrangements. The old
■Union Club building, just across the river, was chosen as the site of
the railway hospital and from then on their patients were treated there.
Cases fell to 67 in 1886; 35 in 1887 and by 1889 had dropped back to 18.
The annual report of 1887 reports that the “railway works are now
completed in this district.” Although there had been a partial service
before that date the Queanbeyan Railway Station was officially opened
on September 8, 1887, and regular railway communication between the
district and the metropolis commerced.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


THE OLD UNION CLUB, IN TRINCULO PLACE
It was in this two storey building that the railway contractors
established their own hospital in 1885.
Getting back to the ordinary routine of the hospital during these
years we find in the minutes of Ist October, 1884, a reflection on hygiene
as we know it to-day. The meeting authorised the secretary to have
a cover put on the pit at the rear of the closets —small wonder that
typhoid fever was one of the more common aliments of those times.
For the first time a laundress was engaged in, 1884, at 3/- per day.
The increased number of patients and added responsibility must have
affected the matron’s temper for it is recorded that a doctor had reported
that “on account of matron’s ill-temper to the patients several had
asked to be taken away from the hospital.’’ Matron thereupon resigned.
At that time patients were being fed by matron from the dieting
allowance of 1/6 per day per patient but in April 1885 this was increased
to eightpence per meal per patient. The arrangement did rot last long,
however, for in September of the same year a dieting scale was adopted
and tenders called for supplies.
The annual meeting ir, January 1885 gave consideration to a com-
plaint by one of the subscribers that it was inadvisable to have members
on the committee who were conspicuous by their absence from meetings.
This led to some very acrimonious remarks and in the course of the

discussion one member pointed out how very little was being done by
country residents towards helping the hospital.
The strength of the committee was increased in 1884 to 24 and
in that year Mr. J. J. Wright retired from the committee. He is
recorded as being the last of the original members with an unbroken
period of service.
In April 1885 it was decided to have a large ward erected at the
northern end of the hospital as a fever ward and in July of that year
the tender of Thomas Jordan was accepted for the job at a cost at
£245. This building is now used as the nurses recreation room.
Mrs. James Land, who had been matron since June 1885, died in
office in 1888. The minutes were sometimes brutally frank and It is
reported that in appointing a successor to the deceased matron in
July 1888 “after a long and desultory conversation” Mrs. Mary McTeman
was appointed.
The year 1889 appears to mark the beginning of the payment of an.
honorarium to the secretary; it was fixed at £lO per annum but was
altered in 1890 to £5 plus ten per cent, on all monies collected.
Rather a strange regulation was adopted in September 1890 when
it was decided that “no pauper patients be admitted except those sent
in by the police authorities” but in 1892 the application of the Hospital
Act to Queanbeyan made it incumbent to admit any sick patient for
treatment, whether they could pay or not.
In January 1891 Dr. P. Blackall first became associated with the
hospital and, like his colleague Dr. Richardson, this association con-
tinued for 41 years, ceasing with the retirement of Dr. Blackall in 1932.
1891 marked the introduction of the policy of admitting patients
on the reoomendation of subscribers cn’y, but the ’92 Act no doubt
upset this policy.
All hospital land was enclosed with a fence in 1892. The report
for this year says the hospital was never in better working order than
at present and has £IOO at fixed deposit. Twenty-seven patients were
adm’tted that year. The first mention of hospital “Board” appears
in the minutes of 1892. There were 27 patients that year and for the
following years the figures had an upward trend, being 34, 52 and 55
respectively. There was a slight drop for the next couple of years
but in 1899 sixty-one patients were treated and the figure hung around
the 60 mark for several years.
The Government insisted in 1894 that when filling any vacancies
for matron, trained nurses only could be considered.

AFTERNOON TEA IN THE HOSPITAL GROUND, 1906
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


There were no less than 26 nominations for a committee of 15 in
1895. The hospital buildings were roofed with galvanised Iron in this
year at a cost of £69. The mortuary In those days was known as the
“deadhouse” and in ore of the minutes of 1895 there is a direction to
the matron, that “no corpse sha’l be left in the wards but removed to
the deadhouse.” Matron countered at the following meeting by
enquiring where she was to put the lumber which was stored in the
deadhouse.
In May 1895 it was decided to place a skylight in the Board room
“so that operations could be carried out to better advantage than in
the wards.” Matron appears to have been paid £BO per annum in the
nineties, plus l/6d. per day to victual patients. Prom this she had
to provide a pr'baticner. Later she was allowed another £1 per month
so that she could have the services of a “servant girl.”
Prom then on to the century the hospital appears to have drifted
along without anytlrng eventful happening.
The fees were 2/6d per day in 1901.
1903 was quite an eventful year as the new operating theatre, which
was built by J. J. Purcell at a cost of £202, was opened by Sir Austin.
Chapman, our fust Pederal member.
In 1904 there is mention of a donation of £3OO by the President,
Mr. Pred. Campbel 1 of “Yarralumla” and although this appears to have
been his laigest donation up t~ that time it was not unusual during
his presidency for him t~ ccnfibute anything up to £lO from time
to time if he thought it was needed. Mr. Campbell was a committeeman
for over 30 years and president from 1399 unt ! l his departure in April
1913. In 1914 be made a cash donation of £IOO to hospital funds and
placed a further £9OO at fixed deposit in perpetuity. The Board still
receives the interest from this.
Further additions were added to the hospital buildings in 1905, the
contractor being J. Jordan and the price £404/10/-. The telephone
was first connected in this year.
Acety’ene gas was installed on 12th August, 1907, at a cost of £36.
More additions were added in 1909 at a cost of £219/15/-, Mr. J. Jordan
again being the contractor.
Patients treated reached 90 in 1908 and 89 the following year, after
which there was a sudden rise due to the choice of Canberra, then
unnamed, as the Pederal Capital. The town of Queanbeyan began,
to grow with giant stiides during this early construction period of the
1846 QCEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


Federal Capital when hundreds of workmen came to the district
ushering an era of prosperity for the business people of Queanbeyan
and the town generally.
This influx added to the worries of those responsible for the man-
agement of the hospital and the accommodation was sorely taxed owing
to the fact that no other accommodation in the nature of a hospital
was available for the sick of the district.
In 1911 no less than 209 patients were treated and the committee
was very worried over the problem as, apart from having insufficient
accommodation available, the added costs of running the hospital were
proving a headache and in 1912 the finances were in a particularly
bad way. As from the Ist January of that year the Home Affairs
Department, which handled the early construction work at Canberra,
agreed to pay the Queanbeyan Hospital a subsidy of £100; this was
increased, after much haggling, to £2OO as from Ist February 1913. but
was reduced to £IOO again on Ist April 1917 and ceased altogether at
the end of June in that year.
At this period, due to the first WorM War, the construction pro-
gramme at Canberra practically came to a standstill. When it was
resumed, after the conclusion of hostilities, the hospital authorities were
never ab'e to get the Canberra authorities to give them a subsidy of
any kind in spite of the fact that the task of providing hospital-
isation, for the people of our Federal Capital proved a burden and kept
the hospital in a state of poverty. A hospital had been erected at
Acton but for a long period was clcsed aHogether. When it was
reopened people had become so used to regarding Queanbeyan as their
hospital that in the early nineteen-thirties the Board closed down on
the admission of Canberra patients unless they paid in advance.
There have been big changes since then and to-day Canberra is
equipped with one of the most modern, hospitals in the Southern
Hemisphere and Queanbeyan is not bothered with Canberra patients
but depends to a large extent on Canberra for the hospitalisation of
many of its obstetric cases.
After a record period in office of 21 years, H. F. Downey retired
from the position of secretary in 1912. He assumed office again many
years later for a short period.
A collection taken up at the time of the naming of Canberra by
Lady Denman, wife of the Governor-General, on 12th March, 1913,
yielded £29/1/1.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


In 1916 the ha’l at Majura was sold to the Federal Government
lor £2OO and the money was given to the hospital by the people of
Majura, and in December ol the same year the Ginninderra Farmers
Union donated the sum of £IOO. These appear to have been the best
efforts from the country section of the hospital area during its hundred
years.
The present isolation block was built in 1919 by Adam Patterson
for £1333 and a further £250 was spent in equipping and completing it
ready for occupation. In this year John Gale broke an association of
over 60 years with the hospital when he resigned as auditor.
The pneumonic influenza epidemic caused the hospital authorities
a good deal of worry and not a little extra work round about 1919-20.
Electricity was installed throughout the hospital in August 1921.
The first mention of plans for a new hospital crops up in 1924 when
a further acre and a half of land was acquired to make room for the
projected structure.
Mr. W. A. Deans who had been secretary on several occasions,
died ’n office in 1925.
The hospital was connected to the town water supply in October
1926. By 1927 the hospital was maintaining a fair daPy average of
patients and after representations had been made to the authorities
was later gazetted as a training school for nurses. This year also
marked the formation of a ladies auxiliary to assist with the work of
the hospital and although it had temporarily gone out of existence for
a year or so, since then the auxiliary has been instrumental in raising
hundreds of pounds, and an auxiliary is still doing useful work for
the hospita l .
In 1928 the committee accepted an offer from the Government to
build a £12,000 hospital and find £B,OOO, the hospital committee to find
the other £4OOO, and in June 1929 it was notified that tenders were
to be called for the job but something went amiss and the whole plan
was subsequent'y scrapped and new plans and estimates prepared for
the present hospital building.
The present senior medical officer. Dr. A. H. Hart, first became
associated with the hospital on taking up practice here in 1928.
Mr. A. H. Collett became Chairman, in 1929 and continued in
office until 1938, being succeeded by Mr. P. W. Hammond who died in
office in 1941 when the present Chairman, Mr. Darcy Vest was appointed.
The date cf the annual meeting was changed from January to
August in 1930. The first mention, of a systematic contribution scheme
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


was in 1930 but the Board turned down the proposal and it was not
until 1935 that the Board put a contribution scheme into operation.
In 1929 the present secretary, Ancel Johnston, took office as a part-
time officer and he was appointed full time secretary in 1934.
THE PRESENT MATRON
Miss M. B. Wright, 1930-1946
The present Matron, Miss M. B.
Wright, came to the hospital in
March 1930 and her occupancy
of the position for upwards of
sixteen years is a record for the
hospital in its present position.
Actually the first Matron, Mrs.
Busten, occupied the position for
over 28 years but sixteen of these
were spent in the old cottage in
Irishtown.
The most successful effort in
aid of the hospital up to that
time was made in 1928 when a
district queen competition and
carnival yielded a profit of £l,lBO
15/8 which was paid to the
building fund of the hospital.
This record still stands, as ano-
ther effort of a similar nature
in 1933 brought in £1,083/7/6
to the building fund and in
1941 the hospital combined
with four other patriotic and
charitable organisations in what
was actually the greatest effort of all time, but as the profits were
shared equally between the five organisations the hospital’s share was
£684/9/5. These appear to have been the largest amounts raised by
concerted efforts ever the years.
In 1930 the hospital sent its first delegate to the Hospitals Conference
in Sydney to discuss with other hospitals representatives matters dealing
with this phase cf cur national life. The hospital is usually represented
at these annual conferences nowadays.
During the later years of the hospital there appears to be a tendency
on the-part of well-wishers to remember the institution in their last
will and testament ana Dequests that are particularly noted include
£6OO from the late Harriett Harding, £lOO from the late T. J. Kellv
£5O each from late Richard Moore, Agnes Moore, Emma Young and
Denis Kellv.

THE PRESENT
HOSPTAL
Opened 25th August,
1933.
THE OLD HOSPTAL. Opened 1862.
Remodelled in 1933 and since
then used as Nurses Quarters.
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


The year 1932, with the depression in full swing and many local
workmen on the dole, was a momentous on,e for the hospital for it was
in that year that the long overdue new hospital was approved for
erection by the then Minister for Works, Mr. R. W. D. Weaver. It
was decided to build the hospital by day labour and thus absorb as
many of our unemp l oyed citizens as possible. Work on the job began
on 13th October 1932 ard the new building was opened by Mr. W. W.
Hedges, M.L.A., deputising for Mr. Weaver, on 25th August 1933.
The cost of the new building, including the mortuary and altera-
tions to the old hospital to fit it out as nurses quarters, was £17,096/18/4
of which the Government found £12,000. As the Board had sufficient
in hand to meet the balance the building was opened free of debt.
Furnishing and equipping was also met from funds in hand for
the purpose.
With the opening of the new building admission figures began to
rise and a diphtheria epidemic which broke out in 1934 completely
crowded out the isolation block and one end of the new hospital had
to be used to provide accommodation for the children who were victims
of the epidemic. At one time there were no less than 70 patients in
hospital and the daily average for the month of April, when the
epidemic was at its peak, was 58. As a direct result of this epidemic
the town of Queanbeyan was one of the first towns in the State to
institute an immunisation campaign against diphtheria and the immu-
nisation of children against the dread disease has been carried out
annually since then with the result that very few cases of diphtheria
occur to-day.
The total patients treated during the twelve months up to 30th
June 1934 was 789 and the daily average 30.7. These were records at
the time and although the number treated has been exceeded several
times since then the daily average is still a record. The number
admitted during the year was exceeded in 1943 (802), 1941 (812), 1939
(871), and the record year 1940 (927); in this year the daily average
was 30.26, just a fraction below the 1934 figure.
Although the new building was only opened in 1933 it was as early
as 1934 that the Board made representations to the Government for
extensions in the nature of a maternity block and paying unit and
plans were actually prepared and submitted to the Board in 1935 but
no finality was reached until eleven years later.
1935 saw the hospital provided with fly-screening throughout: this
had been omitted from the original specifications and the first summer
in the new building proved to be one of torment for patients and staff
1846 QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


owing to the troublesome housefly and his overgrown relative, the
“blowey.”
The Board made overtures to the Hospitals Commission with a
result that the job of making the hospital flyproof was completed in
1935 at a cost of £3OO.
The year was a very important one for the hospital for it was in
February of that year, after much consideration, that the Board
decided to initiate a systematic contribution scheme. Mr. K. S.
Foenander was engaged to set the scheme in operation and he did
an excellent job. On 22nd February of the same year Mr. O. J. Stear
was appointed collector-canvasser of the contribution scheme and he
continued in that capacity until the scheme was merged into the Central
Southern Zone of the Country Hospitals Benefits Association in May
1942. The Scheme and the H.B.A. have proved beneficial to the
hospital and to the many regular contributors who have had no difficulty
in meeting their hospital fees by means of the regular contribution
collected from them.
Another milestone in the history of the hospital was the installation
of a modern mobile X-ray urit in 1935 at a cost of £515. The unlit
is still in operation and has rendered very useful service to the insti-
tution and to the medical officers engaged in the diagnosis of ailments.
No doubt with the enlargement of the hospital a larger and more
modern plant will be installed in the not distant future.
1935 saw two Vice-regal visits to the hospital, the first by Lord
and Lady Hore-Ruthven (afterwards Lord and Lady Gowrie) on 7th June
1935 and the second by Lady Isaacs, wife of the Governor-General, on
3rd July 1935. It must surely be a record for a hospital to receive
official visits from vice-regal representatives of the Commonwealth and
State within 28 days of each other.
It was in 1935 that the Hospital Board as at present constituted'
first came into being. The numerical strength of the Board so far as
Queanbeyan is concerned is ten members, of whom four are appointed
by the Government and six elected trienially by subscribers. The
Chairman and Treasurer are elected annually from these ten, who are
known as Directors.
As the result of the re-opening of the Lake George Mines at
Captain’s Flat a Clearing Station was established at that centre In
August 1940. under the control of the Queanbeyan District Hospital.
It is still operating but will shortly go out of existence as a new hospital
is being established at Captain’s Flat under the control of their own
Board of Directors.

Since the establishment of the new hospital the Board has left mo
stone unturned to keep abreast of the times and ensure that the hospital
is equipped with necessary modem appliances. In 1945 an appeal was
launched for the Installation of modem radio equipment throughout
the hospital and was enthusiastically supported by citizens of the
town and district. The modem two channel receiving set was installed
the same year by the A.W.A. with headphones to every bed and loud
speakers throughout the institution. The total cost was £BOO but it
has added considerably to the comfort of the hospital.
The year 1946, heralding the hospital’s one hundredth year of service
to the community, has also brought glad tidings, for the representations
which have been made throughout the past eleven years have borne fruit
and tenders have beer, accepted for the erection of the new Maternity
Unit, Paying Unit and Nurses Home at a total cost of £35,253, of which
the Government will find all but £6,000, which has to be provided by
the Board. Much of the credit for finalising this matter goes to our
State member, Mr. J. W. Seiflert, who has been most persistent im
urging our claims on the Government during the past few years. The
contract for the construction work has been let to Mr. W. J. Perry, of
Canberra (tender price £29,792), and the hot water and heating services
will be installed by J. Sainsbury & Co.
The new Nurses Quarters will comprise 15 nurses bedrooms, four
sisters bedrooms, sisters sitting room, nurses sitting room, kitchenette,
bathrooms, showers, boiler room and usual annexes. They will be used
in conjunction with the existing nurses quarters in which accommo-
dation is provided for nine nurses with a room each, in. addition to
Matron’s quarters and nurses recreation room and kitchenette.
The Paying Unit will provide accommodation for eleven more
patients and embodies a waiting room, sun room, sister’s room and the
requisite service annexes.
The Maternity Unit will provide accommodation for seven patients
and will have a labour ward, babies’ room, preparation room, and
waiting room, as well as the necessary annexes.
When the building programme has been completed the hospital will,
with the isolation block, provide accommodation for 54 patients without
crowding. It is anticipated that the new sections will be ready for
occupation about the middle of 1947, and will be complete in every
detail.
With the introduction of the Commonwealth Free Hospital Scheme
on Ist July 1946, every publle ward patient is entitled to free treatment
in a hospital and patients in the paying sections of the hospital will
184# QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL 1946


benefit in like proportions. When one examines the hospital system
of to-day it must be admitted that we have travelled a long way since
our first hospital was established in 1846 when hospitals were really
the last hope where the sick and suffering were sent so that they might
die in comparative comfort. Since then they have developed from
asylums for the dying to temples of healing.
It is not so long since the public hospital was scorned by those
who felt that their station in life warranted “something better” but
to-day the worldly person realises that what the public or district
hospital cannot provide for their benefit is unobtainable elsewhere.
Although the hospitals of this State may be rather behind the time*
when compared with some European and American hospitals, never-
theless much progress has been made over the last few years, particu-
uarly since the Hospitals Commission was appointed in 1930 to control
the hospitals of the State, and if our system continues to progress at
the same rate our modem hospitals will appear to our grandchildren
almost as antique as Queanbeyan’s first hospital of a century ago
appears to us to-day.
For the year ended 30th June, 1946, there were 707 patients treated
for a total of 9942 bed days. 730 individual outpatients were treated.
The adjusted daily average of occupied beds was 28.2. The total
expenditure was £5652 of which Salaries and Wages accounted for
£3354; Provisions, £1131; Drugs, etc., £331; ami Fuel and light, £347.
Total Income was £5659 (Pees, £2417; H.B.A. Scheme, £1899; Govern-
ment Subsidy, £1080).
