CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, R.N.
Born-27th October, 1728 Died-14th February, 1779.
A SHORT SUMMARY.
It has been truly said that “ Scarcely the name of any Englishman is held
in greater respect,” and this was said of a humble, Cleveland lad, the son of a
farm labourer.
Before Cook took command of three naval expeditions of discovery he
had, over a period of ten years, surveyed and charted much of the coast of
Canada, which he had helped to win from the French a few years previously.
During this period he had studied mathematics and qualified for a
commission in the Navy. On 25th August, 1768, in command of the Endeavour,
he set out on the first of his three voyages of discovery, each of which lasted
about three years.
His first voyage, acting upon instructions, was devoted to observing the
transit of Venus in the West South Pacific, and upon this he reported in due
course. It was Captain Cook who cruised round and proved that Australia,
New Zealand, New Guinea, Tasmania, were islands, and skirted the border
of the Southern icefield.
On his second voyage (July, 1772 to July, 1775), owing to his wisdom and
foresight, only one man died, a crowning proof of his sagacity and concern for
the welfare of his men.
On his return from both these voyages, honours were showered upon
him, and again, early in 1766, he volunteered to lead a third expedition and
reached New Zealand in February, 1777. After again visiting Tahiti and Hawaii,
Cook set off for Alaska. His two ships were the “ Resolution ” and the
” Discovery.” In the following January, the “ Resolution ” was at Hawaii,
and it was here that, during the night of February 13-14 the ” Discovery’s ”
cutter was stolen. Cook landed the next morning with an officer and 7 marines
to take the king as hostage. An islander insulted the British Commander, and
a shot was fired. The natives charged, and in the act of turning to his boats to
call them inshore, Cook was stabbed in the back.
On the 21st February, 1779, the remains of the great navigator and
explorer, Captain James Cook, R.N., vyere committed to the deep.

The Losing of the Cottage
and the Gaining of
the Obelisk.
October, 1934, the Victorian Celebrations are being held
in Australia. In this connection, Mr. Russell Grimwade of Toorak,
near Melbourne, intimated to the Victorian Government, that
be would be prepared to purchase the Cottage standing at Great
Ayton, Yorkshire, for transportation to Australia and Re-erection at Melbourne
as a perpetual memorial to Captain James Cook, R.N. Negotiations were
completed, and the great importance which Australians attach to Cook’s
memory is revealed by the wealth of arrangements which have been made
for the opening of the Cottage at Melbourne.
The question then arose as to how best to utilise the site left at Great
Ayton, and the Victorian Government expressed their desire to have a Memorial
erected thereon and on the Bth August, 1933, Messrs. Dixon Brothers of Great
Ayton, very generously offered to the Victorian Government the site or such
portion thereof as might be required for the erection of a suitable memorial.
The Firm of Messrs. Dixon Brothers of Great Ayton, consisting of William,
Mansell and Arnold, respectively, have taken a large part in these negotiations,
and it might be said that there have been no more loyal and devoted co-workers
in all matters appertaining to Captain Cook’s Life. Nor can mention be omitted
of Mrs. Arnold Dixon, also of Great Ayton, and her enthusiasm and unceasing
devotion to the memory of Captain Cook.
On the 22nd August, 1933, the following letter was received by the then
Mayor of Middlesbrough (Councillor J. Wesley Brown, J.P.), from the
Hon. Richard Linton, the Agent-General for Victoria (Australia) in London :


Office of the
Agent-General for Victoria (Australia),
Victoria House,
Melbourne Place, Strand,
London, W.C. 2.
21st August, 1933.
Sir,
CAPTAIN COOK’S COTTAGE, GREAT AYTON.
With further reference to your letter of the I Ith instant, and
to my reply of the 14th idem, 1 have pleasure in informing you that
I have now received a cablegram from my Government relating to
the generous offer of Messrs. Dixon Bros, to present the whole of the
site on which Captain Cook’s cottage stands or such portion thereof
as may be required for the erection of a suitable memorial.
My Government authorise me to accept the whole of the site
provided that satisfactory arrangements can be made for its future
control and maintenance, and I should therefore esteem it a great
favour if you would be good enough to bring before the Town Council
when they meet again, the proposal outlined in your letter above
referred to, and should they assent to take over the future control
and maintenance of the site I will take the necessary steps to assume
formal possession, and shall then have very great pleasure in handing
it over to the Council.
1 am, Sir,
The Worshipful Your obedient Servant,
The Mayor of Middlesbrough, (Sgd.) RICHARD LINTON,
(Councillor J. Wesley Brown, J.P.) Agent-General.
Town Hall,
Middlesbrough.
On the 10th October, 1933, the Town Council of Middlesbrough, having
considered this matter, resolved as follows :—
I. That the Victorian Government be informed that the Town
Council is readily prepared to accept the site of Captain Cook’s
Cottage at Great Ayton and to undertake the future care and
maintenance thereof and of any commemorative stones which


may be placed on it by the Victorian Government as an Open
Space under the Open Spaces Act, 1906.
2. That all costs incurred in the maintenance and control of the said
Open Space be borne by the Town Council in manner provided
by the said Act, and that the Town Clerk be authorised to complete
all documents necessary to effect the purpose of the Town Council
herein.
On the 12th March, 1934, the site of the Cottage was conveyed by way
of Gift from the Victorian Government to the Corporation of Middlesbrough,
in trust for the perpetual use thereof by the public pursuant to the provisions
of the Open Spaces Act, 1906. On this land stood the cottage and it was here
that Captain Cook visited his aged father before sailing on his second voyage in
the “ Resolution ” in July, 1772.
During this period, the Cottage, having been acquired by the Victorian
Government through Mr. Russell Grimwade’s generosity, had been dismantled,
shipped to Australia, and was being re-erected in Melbourne in June, 1934,
ready for their Centenary Celebrations. These Celebrations are to be opened
by H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester in October, 1934.
It may be interesting to mention here that just how much the famous
Explorer is immortalised in Australia may be realised by the fact that in 1899,
the Government of New South Wales dedicated an area of 253 acres on the
spot where Captain Cook landed in 1770, now known as Kurnell, as a public
reserve. The reserve is controlled by seven Trustees and every year on the
Saturday nearest to the Anniversary of the great Navigator’s landing, an important
commemoration is held on the spot.
Also, on this public reserve is erected a small library dealing principally
with incidents in the life of Captain Cook, and housed in this library are copies
of the Souvenir issued by Middlesbrough on the occasion of the opening of the
Stewart Park, Marton, in which Park is situated a granite vase marking Captain
Cook’s birthplace, and also the Souvenir in connection with the Bi-Centenary
Celebrations arranged in the Cleveland District in 1928.
The stones to form the Obelisk to be erected by the Australian Government
on the site at Great Ayton, were shipped, in the same cases which carried the
Cottage to Melbourne, from Melbourne by the S.S. “ Hobson’s Bay” which
was due to arrive in Hull on the 15th August, 1934. The Stones were eventually
received on the site on the 21st August, 1934.

The Obelisk consists of 39 stones, is 13 feet in height, and is an exact
replica of the one at Cape Everard. The granite for the obelisk was quarried
less than 40 feet from the Cape Everard Obelisk itself. The Memorial bears
the following inscription plates :

PRESENTED BY W. RUSSELL GRIMWADE.
The Architects in charge of the erection of the Obelisk on behalf of the
Government of Victoria, were Messrs. Brierley Rutherford and Syme, of York,
and the Contractors for the erection Messrs. O. Atkinson & Son, also of York,
On the 22nd September, 1934, a meeting of the Committee elected to


take charge of the various arrangements was held. The Committee comprised
the following :

Mr. Preston Kitchen, 0.8.E.,T0wn Clerk, Middlesbrough (Hon. Sec.).
At this meeting the position of the Middlesbrough Corporation in regard to
the future control and maintenance of the site and Memorial was explained,
and arrangements for the Unveiling Ceremony were considered.
The date for the Ceremony, namely, the 15th October, 1934, was fixed
so that it might synchronise with the Celebrations in Australia.
In accordance with the wish of the Premier of Victoria, Australia,
expressed in the following letter received by the Agent-General for Victoria
in London, it has been decided that the site of the Memorial at Great Ayton
shall henceforth be called “ Point Hicks,” :


VICTORIA,
Premier’s Office,
34/2811. Melbourne, C. 2.
20th August, 1934.
Dear Sir,
Adverting to your letter of the 24th January last, No. 4545. with
reference to various matters in connection with Cook’s Cottage, I now desire
to inform you that the question of giving a name to the site of Cook’s Cottage
at Great Ayton has received consideration and it has been decided that the
site should be known as “ POINT HICKS,’’ being named after a part of the
Australian coast (Victorian section) from which a Yorkshifeman (Captain
James Cook) returned to tell his parents of his discovery of the Sixth
Continent.
Yours faithfully,
(sgd.) STANLEY ARGYLE,
Premier.
The Agent-General for Victoria,
Victoria House,
Melbourne Place, Strand, W.C. 2.
The area of the site is Three hundred and thirty eight square yards or
thereabouts, and is situate in Bridge Street, Great Ayton, Yorkshire.
In such manner has the link of Fellowship between Australia and the
Mother Country been sealed, and the two countries become more closely
bound by the possession by Australia of a “ bit of Cook's Heart,” as one
Australian was heard to remark when viewing the Cottage at Ayton before its
removal to his country.
