Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,
Thinks what ne?er was, nor is, nor e?er shall be.
In every work regard the writer?s end,
Since none can compass more than they intend
And if the means be just, the conduct true.
Applause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.

Zhc Silliab.
*? Note toot the, flute and agitate the gong.
Silly am I, and silly is my song.'
?A Fact.
Calliope ! from thy bright throne descend,
And on the numbers of my strain attend ;
Smile on my labour, bard-inspiring maid,
And grant the boon of thy auspicious aid ;
For now, with trembling hand, do I essay
To wake the / lofty and heroic lay.
And what shall be the burden of my song ?
The triumphs that to feats of arms belong ?
The god-like valour of the battlefield
When heroes press and equal heroes yield ;
Where, ?midst the carnage, many a warrior bleeds
And mighty Mars inspires immortal deeds ?
Such themes as fired the Grecian bard of old,
From whose great soul those deathless numbers


That tell of Troy, and with such power bespeak
The glory of the Trojan and the Greek ?
Ah, no such tale now animates my lay,
I sing of deeds wrought in our modern day ;
Deeds which their authors have to fame upborne
And may with fitting grace the verse adorn.
For who shall say the glorious football-field
Unto the battle-ground a place must yield ;
Or that less noble hearts or weaker hands
The grand occasion of the game demands
When dexterous youths urge on the furious fray
To snatch the fortunes of the fearful play ?
Australia?s sons religionise the game
And make its close pursuit their dearest aim ;
All else to its great claim must yield command,
For Sport holds empire in the Great South Land.
0 Sport! Thou god of lithe, athletic frame,
How Young Australia exalts thy name !
To thee he rears the consecrated shrine,
And all his worship, all his love is thine.
For thy dear sake he shuns the stupid schools,
For Brain must not intrude where Bicep rules ;
The scholar and the sage the crown must yield
Unto the hero of the Sporting Field.


Happy Australia ! fortune-favoured land,
Among the nations shalt thou take thy stand ;
Thy noble sons to thee bright bays shall bring
From cricket fields and from the fistic ring ;
And on the rippling river?s gentle breast
Their prowess shall the gallant boys attest,
Though envious rivals, in their spleen, may groan,
? They manage boat-sculls better than their own.?
Intrepid Sport! with patronising sway
Be near to guide her destiny alway.
Self-dedicated, lo ! her youths resign
Their deepest homage at thy trophied shrine.
And if thy kindly aid be with her still,
Immortal deeds her annals proud shall fill.
Onward, my tardy harp ! nor thus prolong
The needless prelude to thy lofty song ;
Recount the glories of th? eventful day
When rival heroes urged the football play.
In fair Victoria, brightest of the band
Of colonies that grace the Austral land,
Far in the back blocks rose two rustic towns,
Divided by the widespread Wombat Downs,
Renowned for matchless maidens, plump and fair,


Famed less for length of tongue than length of hair.
No toilet arts their rosy cheeks disgraced,
And no unhealthy stays their zones encased ;
Beneath the blazing sun they bared their arms,
Nor feared to bronze their Amazonian charms;
They thrummed not on pianos all day long,
Nor made night hideous with the high-class song
Like many ladies in fair Melbourne do,
And find admirers who applaud them too ;
They rose betimes, and the old barn-door cock
Sufficed to fill the functions of a clock,
And ere the town smiled ?neath the early sun
They had the poultry fed and milking done ;
And in the harvest time not loth were they
To work the winnow or to tend the hay ;
The dairy oftentimes evoked their care,
For many an arduous duty claimed them there ;
Whilst in the kitchen with uncommon skill
They toiled with homely grace and right good will
They knew all mysteries of the cooking art,
And could make epicures adore a tart;
Their savoury dishes truly could excite
Easy digestion and keen appetite.
Even as the daughters such endowments knew,


The sons were noble and accomplished too ;
Erect they stood, as staunch and firm as rocks,
Their average height six feet ?unhelpt of socks.
But to my story : What does it avail
That 1 should tediously delay my tale ?
My muse of manly beauty little recks?
Enough that I should note the dearer sex !
The towns to which I your attention drew
Are known as Wombat Flat and Wombywoo ;
To the fair district of Borungawong,
In broad Bugmeadowshire, do they belong.
And the great story which I shall relate
Befel one afternoon of recent date.
The game of football has apostles found
In every township on Victorian ground ;
But in the Flat, and eke in Wombywoo,
Football devotion with great fervour grew ?
There every lad the royal game was taught,
And some to marvellous perfection brought.
And so it chanced that in these boastful days
Both towns grew most profuse of wild self-praise,.
Till Hannibal Smith-Jones of WombywoO'
To those of Wombat Flat a challenge threw.
The Flats took up the gauntlet straight away


And fixed the battle for the first of May,
And that eventful date, without delay,
Was set apart as a great holiday.
The local press each week was filled with news
About the Wombats or the Wombywoos
The ? Claptrap Courier,? issued in the Flat,
Had promised every Wombat a new hat
Should they assert their prowess in the fray
And prove themselves the heroes of the day.
The organ of the town of Wombywoo?
The ? Buzzing Bee ? ?likewise quite generous grew
Loudly they chanted of their favourites? fame,
Extolling their adroitness at the game ;
They prophesied success for Wombywoo,
And in their fervour ev?n poetic grew.
Homerius Jackson seized his tuneful lyre
And chronicled his soul in words of fire,
The grand refrain thus : ? Lads of Wombywoo,
Flap, flap your wings ! crow ! cock-a-doodle-doo ! ?
The learned editor, Sempronius Quill,
Said, should the Wombywoos attest their skill
And bring the laurels of football renown
In joyful triumph to their native town,
That very night, at his own private house,


They should sit down to dine and to carouse;
Then, should no mild frugality appear,
But prodigality of wholesome cheer.
Urged by their generous friend, the Wombywoos
Trained constantly to strengthen limbs and thews
And Eucalyptus Drake, the local quack,
Prepared a potion called Killimpsicae?
A wondrous med?cine setting forth a claim
To raise the spirit, renovate the frame,
And guaranteed, if taken night and morn,
To cure Consumption or to kill a Corn.
The Wombat Flats, meanwhile, are not asleep ;
A course of steady exercise they keep ;
From all hard work they prudently abstain
Lest they should bruise a limb or muscle srram ;
With anxious hearts they wait the first of May
And all their cares are for the coming fray.
At length the day arrives?a perfect one,
Blessed with unclouded sky and temperate sun ;
The gentle winds have lulled themselves to sleep
All Natures elements calm concord keep.
In crowds the populace forsake the towns
And briskly journey to the Wombat Downs,


For there the rivals teams must urge their might
For victory in dubious football fight.
Old men and women thitherward repair,
And frisk about like two-year-olders there.
The folks from Wombywoo and Wombat Flat
Now intermix with smiles and jovial chat.
Into Silenus Boosey?s canvas booth
They flock to pledge affection?s lasting truth ;
And soon upon the shanty?s grassy floor
Ignobly stretched lay fifty men or more,
While with loud song respire the flaccid walls
?Mid rattling pannikins and boisterous brawls.
Dogberry Dobbs, the sergeant of police,
Whose duty ?twas to regulate the peace,
With helmet flattened like a steam-rolled pot
Lay ?midst the heap, the drunkest of the lot.
Long ere the sun had the meridian gained
Silenus? vessels to the dregs were drained.
Then some, by mad caprice or mali:e led,
Pulled down the tent on his defenceless head.
His hairless cranium ill could stand the attack,.
And down he toppled like an empty sack.
The partner of his joys?his dear Susanne ?
Straightway to fetch the donkey go-cart ran.


JSilenus in the vehicle was placed,
And driven to his home with frantic haste.
Lo !on an apple-case--to court full view!
Whom have we here? the inevitable Jew !
Yea, there, as large as life, the Hebrew stands.
A scribbling book and pencil in his hands;
The selfsame creature who, some days ago,
The town paraded, shouting out ? Old Clo? ! ?
Behold where now he stands in flash array,
Bawling, with nasal twang, ? I lay ! I lay !
But let him brawl till throat sore-parched may feel,
And to the crowd for patronage appeal!
The folks of Wombat Flat and Wombywoo
Have ere to-day found out the wily Jew.
They?ll have no dealing with his betting book,
Lest from his nose his heels should take the hook.
Poor Moses, finding all entreaties vain,
With many an earnest protest did complain,
Till, abdicating his high apple-case,
He, with unholy murmuring, left the place.
And now, to pass the leisure time away,
Diverting games the youths and maidens play.
Diana Dawkins and Lothario King
Have grouped a band for ? Kissing in the ring.


The winsome maids and youths alternate stand
And form a circle linking hand to hand.
Now one goes gaily round and round in quest
Of that dear youth whom she esteems the best,
Who, by kind Cupid?s favour, shall not miss
The rapturous guerdon of a honeyed kiss ;
Whilst gleefully the players in the ring
With laughing voice a pleasant ditty sing.
Lo ! in the circle stands Lucinda Mopps,
But none upon her arm the kerchief drops ;
Like a bouquet some days left on a tomb
She stands neglected in her perished bloom ;
Her twentieth year has long since past away
And her dark hair is thickly streaked with grey;
?Tis true she ne?er could boast angelic charms
To woo the amorous youth to her fond arms !
But why denied to her Love?s sweet embrace ?
A warm heart?s rarer than a pretty face.
And poor Lucinda was a tender soul
Whose heart was warmer than a living coal.
Then why could she no doting spouse secure ?
Her cause was overlooked, for she was poor.
See Cleopatra Tubbs, with far less grace,
And a large wart disfiguring her face !


Unnumbered dandies she can eas?ly mash,
Because they know her Pa has lots of cash.
Alas ! the baid must pause to shed a tear
To think that Love can be so insincere,
For ever thus throughout the Universe
?Tis not the heart he seeks it is the purse.
Yet droop not, fair Lucinda, nor repine :
Some gallant Romeo may yet be thine ;
But if the youths still hanker after pelf,
Lorn summer rose I I?ll marry thee myself.
Hark! on the air rise what delicious sounds
To which the heart responsive lightly bounds ;
Kind Fate, it is the Yabba Yabba Band
Discoursing music eloquently grand ;
With Jocund din the crack-pot cornets blare
And the big drum convulses the wide air ;
Loudly the clarinet?s shrill notes ascend,
So aptly tuned to set the hair on end ;
Now tenor horns their mellow voices rouse
One after one like Brown?s proverbial cows ;
The huge bombardon?s intermittent drone
Is heard pom-pomming like a sick bull?s moan
The modern classic now demands their skill
And they perform with a devoted will,


For well they love the lofty master-themes
Wherein such soulful inspiration teems.
Hark ! with what fine effect they ripple through
Mozart McGinty?s ? Valse di Wooloomoolo ! ?
The notes have ceased; the echoes die away ;
The soul once more seeks her abode of clay ;
When heavenly music?s rapturous strains arise
She is translated to her native skies,
Or dreams of Italy so far away
Where the eternal hurdy-gurdies play.
Now to the east where looms a spacious tent
In expectation great all eyes are bent;
The canvas doors are slowly drawn aside
And forth the Wombat Flat contestants glide.
All in due order and in neat array
On to the field they wend their eager way.
With orient splendour in the sunshine bright
Shimmer their uniforms of red and white.
Their townsfolk all send up a lusty cheer ;
Hats, caps, and kerchiefs waving high appear ;
Grey-headed dames and damsels young and fair
For their success evoke a fervent prayer.
Their captain, Hector Jones, assumes the lead,


Far famed was he for many a doughty deed ;
Well versed in all manoeuvres of the game ?
And many a scheme himself had learned to frame
Full oft the Flats owed unexpected gain
To Hector Jones?s cool and subtle brain.
Mercutio Snooks takes the next honoured place?
Worthy was he such lofty rank to grace,
Taught in the famous fields of Bungaree,
Few handled football with such skill as he ;
Oft, when the fight was fiercely forced in front,
He saved the goal with his Hibernian punt.
Next Agamemnon Potts and Plato Graggs,
Coriolanus Griggs and Cato Braggs,
On either wing these fearless champions played,
Ensuring conquest by their powerful aid ;
Ready were they with many an artful knack
The dribble, duck, the dodge and double back ?
The curious feats they oftentimes would do
Much hearty laughter from beholders drew.
Next came big Ajax Swab of great renown,
Known as ?The Bruiser? in his native town ;
With conscious pride his martial head he reared,
And softly stroked his sunset-coloured beard,
Which down upon his elephantine chest,


Unsullied of the shears, was wont to rest.
? The Bruiser,? who red beard betokened pluck,
Led on the doughty demons of the ruck ;
And many a stout foe?s heart with fear would throb
When close he felt the vyce-like grip of Swab.
Ulysses Trott, Samson and Cyrus Pratt
Followed with Ajax for the Wombat Flat.
Now others of less note in file appear
And tall Napoleon Jinks takes up the rear;
Not lack of skill, disfavour, nor disgrace
Puts bold Napoleon in the humblest place :
Full many a dashing player?s prowess shrinks
Before the opposing skill of ? Boney ? Jinks ;
The goal sneak he, and all his worth confest
Owning him fit to battle with the best--
Hard it would be indeed to find his peer
With forceful foot to navigate the sphere.
To the far sky another cheer ascends
As from the tent the Won. by woo team wends ;
Their manly forms much admiration drew?
All newly garmented in navy blue?
And at the head of their well-ordered rank
The ledger keeper of the Gobung bank
Their skipper he, Herminius Johnson named,


For all round sporting prowess widely famed,
Yet not upon athletic fields alone
The name of bold Herminius is known :
He is the idol of fair Worn by woo
And the regard he gains is but his due;
All social movements own his kindly aid
And by his care are gay and pleasant made ;
The Duckfoot dancing club his worth declare,
For much in evidence his skill is there;
At all their balls what art he remonstrates
i
As on the fiddle he manipulates ;
Schooled is he too, to studious cares allied,
Yet wholly free from stiff pedantic pride ;
In him were most harmoniously combined
A m-nly frame and cultivated mind.
Next to Herminius came Adonis Vane,
Called by his rougher comrades ? Lady Jane.?
Around his neck a silken scarf he wore ?
Fair Desderaona?s gift the day before ?
Now to the field he goes with heart aflame
To fight for Desdemona and for fame;
Of stature low he was and lithe of frame,
Yet a superb exponent of the game,
And, though but five feet six and scare nine stone,


Against the best he more than held his own ;
Full well his foes the sterling merit knew
Of the vice-captain of the Worn by woo ;
On every field his treble voice was known,
A kind of chronic grievance in its tone.
Foemen?s supporters oft obnoxious grew
To ? Lady Jane,? the dude of Wombywoo,
But with the ladies he found ample grace,
1* or well they loved his smooth and handsome face
And then the style in which he always drest
A disposition lady-like confest.
Twas said that with the tongs he curled his hair
Of which he seemed to take fastidious care,
But idle gossips shows such manners ill
And slanderous tongues we know cannot keep still
What though Adonis had some dudish ways
And loved the ladies and their honeyed praise ?
The dude is not, as some rude people think.
The long-desired Darwinian Missing Link.
After Adonis came Horatius Gray
Who in the centre rules with supreme sway ;
For resolution and untiring care
None can with bold Horatius compare ;
He yields not nor submits to overthrow


And gives no quarter to his baffled foe.
Next came Columbus Clark, the centre-back,
Strong to defend when furious foes attack ;
With fearful mien his Herculean form
Rose ?mid the stress of the besieging storm ;
Foes he repulsed and stupefied with fright,
Driving them reeling to the left and right.
Rienzi, White and Julius Ctesar Black
( This was the right and that the left wing back)
Followed their comrade ?worthy warriors they
In stern defence to stem the fierce affray.
The ruck men next appear in order due
Headed by Brutus Wilson staunch and true;
Then Cassius Thomson and Alfonso Parkes,
Renowned for smartness with the little marks,
With Menelaus Cook called ? Legs and wings ?
From the peculiar way he strides and springs ;
No peer had he for keeping on the ball
And in the ruck he marked above them all,
To steer the sphere he owned no slight control
And his left foot recorded many a goal.
Achilles Smith came next, the forward man,
And round the concourse vast a murmur ran ;
Full well the unerring goal-sneak?s fame was known


Above all rivals high he stood alone.
The wing men now in close array appear
And Dionysius Dean brings up the rear.
Now, as both teams are gathered on the field
And their respective forces stand revealed,
Vague speculation on the great event
Much piquant ardour to discussion lent,
And round about the excited multitude
In many a place hard blows hard words pursued
The Wombat team the heavier men possest,
But skill, not bulk, decides the truer test.
I he Wombywoo superior form present,
For wiser exercise they underwent;
More fit they seem the unwaning strife to stay,
For in their ranks much calm endurance lay.
On to the field now comes in wuite attire
Mercurius Tate, the champion field umpire ;
No cumbrous garment on his limbs he bore
And on his feet the light golosh he wore,
Whilst from his wrist a silver whistle bright
Depended by a cord of blue and white.
Great speed must be the order of the day
When swift Mercurius Tate controls the play ;


His winged feet had proved their urgent pace
In many a long and close contested race ;
From scratch he won the Wagga Wagga Cup
And in the Lai Lai Plate was runner up.
Into the centre of the field he goes
And lustily his shrill-toned whistle blows ;
The players all take their appointed place
And nerve and sinew for the combat brace ;
From the vast crowd tumultuous cheers arise ;
Each town in wild enthusiasm vies ;
Amid the clamor and uproarious dm
The ball is bounced, the players rally in.
Sharp was the onset, and confused ruck-play
For some few moments in the centre lay,
Till Cyrus Pratt the airy oval got
And tapped it neatly to Ulysses Trott,
Who stood outside the ruck with fox-like zeal.
Ready upon the foe a march to steal ;
He drove the ball across to Plato Craggs
Whom to the earth Rienzi White soon drags
Around the wing Rienzi forced the play
But Agamemnon Potts debarred his way ;
Now Samson Pratt came with his usual dash,.
Rushing between them like a lightning flash,


He seized the ball and took a timely kick,
For Brutus Wilson caught him mighty quick.
Adonis now proudly assumes command
And dashes down the centre simply grand ;
The little demon makes the Wombat stare,
He comes so smartly ere they are aware ;
He punts the leather to Aurelius Brown ;
Claudius Nelson brings Aurelius down ;
Up to the breach Achilles gamely lined,
But with a rush the ball was forced behind.
Quickly the globe was footed off again
From which ? The Bruiser ? did a mark obtain ;
Audaciously he strove to break away,
Though young Adonis had him safe at bay ;
Onward he goes in his misguided haste
With ? Lady Jane ? close clinging to his waist ;
In vain Adonis strove to curb his speed,
He found the ponderous task too great a deed ;
Whilst burly Ajax dragged him o?er the field
Unto Mercurius half a score appealed ;
He promptly whistles Ajax back again
And a free kick awards to ? Lady Jane.?
Adonis kicks and Menelaus marks
And drives it forward to Alfonso Parkes ;


Right into goal the ball Alfonso sends
Where Claudius Nelson gallantly defends ;
Across to Braggs the leather Claudius passed
Who made the pace excitable and fast;
Around the wing with furious haste he sped
Sending the ball to Cyrus Pratt ahead
Who drives it close to the opposing goal
Where Clark and Jinks fight stoutly for control;
Fiercely the rivals strive the prize to gain?
Titanic strength starts every swelling vein
And nerves are strung and strenuous sinews strain
But, whilst the twain so dexterously contend,
The sweeping ruck-men on the ball descend ;
Big Ajax Swab comes with the foremost bound
And kicks the spinning leather off the ground,
Between the posts the ball unhindered goes ;
Quickly the two recording pennons rose
And from the Wombat Flats hilarious friends
A cheer tremendous to the sky ascends ?
Hats, caps and bonnets in the air are thrown,
And on the fourfold wind Swab?s name is blown.
Soon into play the ball again is sent.
Each Wombat Flat elate with bold intent ;
Herminius Johnson used each art he knew


To rouse the valor of the Wombywoo.
Bravely they sweep upon their doughty foes
And their superior excellence soon shows.
Now Dionysius Dean effects a run
And some superb manoeuvring is begun ;
Thomson now marks to Menelaus Cook
From whom Alfonso Parkes the leather took;
In splendid order once again from Parkes
By lofty springing Menelaus marks.
The Wombat Flats display intense surprise
And watch with gaping mouth and staring eyes ;
Bold Menelaus takes them unawares
And for a venturesome attack prepares ;
.Straight for the goal he dashes on his way
Just as the bell proclaims a truce to play,
But, all unconscious of the tinkling sound,
He pushes forward with elastic bound
And for the goal he aims a left foot screw,
Sending the leather safely spinning through ;
The skillful feat wins not its due reward,
Yet the spectators generous praise accord.
Ends being changed and play commenced again,
Tne Wombywoo attacked with might and main ;


Right down upon their desperate foes they bore
Bringing the ball close up to goal once more,
When Dionysius with a well-judged punt
To Menelaus marked, close up in front.
Now Menelaus takes a steady aim,
Hoping kind Fate may equalize the game,
But, though the shot was twenty yards at most,
The ill-directed leather struck the post,
Then to Herminius Menelaus turns
And cries ? Sure Fortune all our labour spurns ;
I fear we cannot hope the day to gain,
For twice my efforts have been all in vain.?
? Nay, noble friend,? Herminius replies,
? ?Tis with the persevering conquest lies ;
Believe me, we shall yet subdue the foe,
For, lo ! already much fatigue they show,
And, if we all our firmer foot advance
And seize the kiss-curl of fleet-footed Chance,
Success not long shall with our foes remain
Nor our persistent efforts prove in vain.?
This said, into the fight his comrade goes
Inciting friends and disconcerting foes.
Control with either side alternate stayed ;
Now up, now down the field the conflict swayed,


Till Plato Craggs?wing-centre, Wombat Flat?
Obtained a little mark from Cyrus Pratt;
To Agamemnon Potts the ball he drives;
Herminius Johnson just in time arrives ;
Upward with Potts into the air he went
To catch the buoyant globe in its descent,
And baffled Agamemnon soon was found
Lying spreadeagle on the grassy ground ;
His gloomy look much sore distress revealed
The while Herminius cantered down the field ;
To Smith, the goal sneak, well the ball he drove
And for the mark Achilles gamely strove,
But wily Nelson closed in from the wing
And spoilt with artful hip Achilles? spring.
Now for the ball Mercutio swiftly goes
And dashes wildly past both friends and foes;
He seizes it and with prodigious force
Right down the field directs his gallant course;
Bold Menelaus now he casts aside
And now Alfonso?s clutches he defied.
Now Brutus Wilson?s arm has no avail
And Cassius Thomson?s stubborn efforts fail ;
So through the city some affrighted steed
Loosed from his bondage flies with frantic speed,


Pedestrians, shouting, join in eager chase
And strive with fearless zeal to curb his pace ;
Some think to seize him by the broken rein
And some snatch wildly at his flowing mane,
But every bold device is all in vain,
Urged by the shouts of his approving friends
Straight down the centre now Mercutio wends,
Whereat Horatius all his force excites ?
Truly no trivial task his arm invites.
As when a mastiff sauntering on his way
A mongrel meets who thinks his path to stay,
With lofty scorn surveys the low-born brute
Who, grown presumptuous, dares his path dispute
So pompous Snooks observes Horatius Gray
Who calmly stands to bar his onward way ;
He thinks to spurn his challenger aside,
But meets his downfall in his ill-judged pride,
For, even as he who kept the bridge of old,
The Wombywoo Horatius was bold ?
He seized Mercutio by the ample girth
And stretched him prone upon the verdant earth ;
Horatius in due turn Mercutio spurned,
Then with a long drop-kick the ball returned.
Aurelius Brown receives the bouncing sphere


And to?ards the goal speeds on with fleet career,
But Claudius intercepts him on his course,
Bringing him to the ground with thund?ring force
The ready Griggs now snatches up the ball
And Cassius Thomson works his speedy fall ;
Then Hector Jones came with a sturdy stride
And shouldered Thomson forcefully aside ;
He gained the ball by dint of biilliant play
And round the left wing pushed his gallant way ;
By Cyrus Pratt well shepherded he goes
Into the very homestead of his foes,
Windmg up grandly with a lofty punt,
Driving the airy leather clean in front;
Napoleon Jinks sailed up and took the mark.
Beating in splendid style Columbus Clark.
An easy task before Napoleon lay ;
The goal was scarely fifteen yards away,
And carelessly he drove the leather through
To the discomfiture of Wombywoo.
The Wombat Flats? rejoicing knew no bounds,
With wild applause the rocking air resounds
And, when the ball was put in play again,
The fierce excitement swelled and burst amain ;
From Wombywoo a counterblast arose,


The multitude one mighty Babel grows,
From every throat a vocal torrent flows.
The players, by the noisy praise inspired,
Into their work with double vigour wired ;
The Wombat Flats, elate with their success,
Upon their stout opponents hotly press
Who by degrees all o?er the warring field,.
Disordered and distrest, were forced to yield.
Herminius with consternation views
The wild confusion of the Wombywoos ;
Imperiously he urged his wavering band,
Directing them by many a wise command ;
Into the surging ranks he coolly goes
And to his comrades fine example shows ;
Soon in their midst good order is restored
And the fierce onslaught checked which on them poured.
Now Titus Green burst through the bustling throng
And by nice handball brought the ball along;
He passed it neatly to Adonis Vane
Who, driving forward f marked to Green again ;
From a sharp angle Titus tries to score
But Wombywoo?s endeavours fail once more.
Mercutio looks a vantage-ground to find
As he prepares to kick off from behind


And with a hasty glance he gazes round,
Taking a broad survey of all the ground ;
Now quickly he perceives where Cato stands
Alone and wildly motioning his hands,
Rapid as thought to Braggs the ball is sent
Who with a smile accepts the compliment;
Away he flies, lithe Braggs renowned for speed
Let tardy footsteps follow?Braggs shall lead ;
Around the wing he winds with jocund pace,
Each stride bespeaking suppleness and grace,
And, as upon the swaid the ball he threw,
Back to his hands it came with measure true ;
Midst the spectators from his many friends
The loud acclaim, the greeting shout ascends,
But, as he proudly paced upon his way,
Across the field careered Horatius Gray
Who seized the ? Wombat Flyer ? as he sped
And rudely hurled him on his luckless head.
Now at full length poor Cato speechless lies
Nor from his grassy couch attempts to rise ;
His friends, alarmed, soon hastened to his side
And many a vain restorative applied,
Until young Grigsby Gore?
The head assistant in the local store?


With stately step the tearful crowd prest through
And from his breast an ample phial drew ;
It bore some potion of superior worth
Distilled not from the products of the earth,
Three stars emblazoned on its label-sign
At once revealed its nature was divine ;
Swift to the lips of Braggs the glass he placed
Who soon aroused at the enchanting taste
And in his teeth the phial clenching fast
Loosed not his hold till every drop had passed
Adown his greedy throat, a gulping tide,
Though Gore in protestation loudly cried.
Meanwhile Horatius Gray secuied control
And sent the football to?ard the Wombat goal ;
A fierce encounter close in front ensued
?Mong fiery foes with giant strength endued ;
With equal force they urge the furious fray
And how the strife would end ?twere hard to say
To neither side the odds of victory went.
For these would not submit nor those relent,
And all the time the sphere upon the ground
By forceful feet was driven round and round :
Achilles Smith his judgment cool maintained
And patiently outside the ruck remained,


And soon the ball so madly whirled about
An opening found and swiftly darted out ;
Achilles caught the trophy, liyhtning-quick,
And drove it through the goal with easy kick
A mighty cheer divides the ambient air
As the two flags the grand result declare.
The vocal torrent gushes forth once more
With more stentorian fury than before ;
Amid the tumults replicating swell
Unheard rang out the truce-proclaiming bell ;
Smith-Jones rushed on the field the strife to stay
And the tremendous uproar dies away.
To the marquee the players now repair
To rest and join in light refreshing fare ;
Herminius Johnson like a general wise
The time employs his comrades to advise ;
With prudent care he goes to every one
Suggesting what to do and what to shun,
This he applauds for valour in the fray
And that reproves for some unskilful play.
The Wombat Flats no like attention show ;
Assured they deem their rivals? overthrow;
With boasttul chat they while the time away
Recounting their own actions in the fray ;


So lustily each his own trumpet blows
That he in self-conceit a hero grows.
Once more the bell its rousing summons pealed.
Again the rivals seek the warring field ;
Amid the plaudits of the multitude
The ball is bounced, the glorious game renewed;
The Wombat Flats with sudden charge assail
And o?er their unexpectant foes prevail ;
Big Bruiser Swab burst through the bustling throng
And running strongly brought the ball along ;
To Plato Graggs the airy globe he passed
Who on to ? Boney ? Jinks propelled it fast;
Now Jinks goes down before Columbus Clark
Who plays round ? Boney ? and secures a ma�k;
Columbus up the field now breaks away
Sending the leather to Horatius Gray.
When, lo ! Braggs seizes Gray in foaming rage
And in a tussle fierce they both engage ;
Down to the earth they fall with crushing blow,
Cato above, Horatius Gray below.
The game is stopped, the combatants removed,
And Braggs by Tate is rigorously reproved.
Helpless upon the gronnd Horatius lies,


Though several times he vainly strove to rise ;
His grieving comrades bear him from the field
Hoping his injuries may soon be healed ;
With careful haste him to the tent they take
Where he is nursed by Eucalyptus Drake ;
Full soon the gentle maids of Wombywoo
With tearful eyes around the awning drew;
A thousand dear enquires now are made,
A score of darlings volunteer their aid,
A hundred delicacies foudly sent,
And countless smelling-bottles freely lent;
The invalid so kindly sought and sued
Is overwhelmed with sweet solicited.
Meanwhile the play renewed grows fierce and fast,
The pace becomes too violent to last;
On either side the ruck much trouble shows,
Fast down each face the perspiration flows,
The placemen still much energy possess,
And earnestly into the combat press ;
Socrates Tompkins, Wombat centre-man
For the first time since the great game began,
Bold in the absence of Horatius Gray,
Assumed command and showed some pretty play ;
Right through the ranks in splendid style he sped


And Dean and Green in vain pursuit he led ;
Onward to Braggs the leather he impelled
Who widly leapt with arms wide open held ;
The clumsy spring his sorry plight contest,
The flying football smote him on the chest;
Down to the earth a helpless heap he goes,
While from the crowd a mirthful shout arose ;
Confused awhile he lay upon the ground,
Then slowly rising gaped and stared around
And where he was he scarcely seemed to know,
Dazed as an idiot at a puppet show.
Now Potts beholding Braggs? hopeless case
Rushed to the breach with quick and well-timed
And deftly dodging put in some smart play ;
Swiftly across the field he bent his way.
Passing the ball on to Ulysses Trott
Who scores the third goal with a flying shot;
Loudly the Wombat Flats applaud the feat
Deeming the victory at last complete.
In vulgar jibes their venomed tongues they use
Heaping contumely on the Wombywoos.
Herminius Johnson wakes his voice again
To urge his ranks nor urges them in vain.
With rush precipitate they forward sweep


And in subjection fast their foemen keep ;
Hector, alarmed, beholds their bursting might
And vainly tries the Wombats to incite ;
The raging onset they can not withstand.
They gradually yield on every hand,
Fierce and more fierce the assailing ardour grows
While more distress the force defending shows ;
From Wombywoo outburst impeluous cheers
As on the field Horatius re-appears,
Swift to his post he bounds with lightsome tread,
All indication of late ailment fled,
Into the fight with fearless heart he goes
Winning the ball from half a dozen foes,
Out of the ruck he comes with dashing pace,
His friends in combat gallantly give place,
And, guarding the attack from every side,
Assist him to emerge with unchecked stride,
Onward he speeds with unretarded tread
Nor swerves nor halts but dashes right ahead
Passing the ball on to Adonis Vane
Who in a trice for goal rushed on amain.
Now dodging Nelson forward still he goes
And one by one defeats his stalwart foes ;
Fast from the goal emerges mighty Snookes,


Ire and determination in his looks,
His growling anger he cannot restrain
As forth he runs to meet the valiant Vane.
As some huge bulldog with unweildy bound
And gaping jaws leaps at the nimble hound
Who not unwary of impending woe
With swerve alert evades the savage foe
And, scamp?ring off fleet as the winged wind.
Soon leaves his wrathful enemy behind,
So ? Lady Jane ? eludes Mercutio Snooks
And smiling views his rage-distorted looks,
Close to the undefended goal he drew
And, coolly pausing, kicked the football through
Mercurius hastily renews the fray
For time is now too precious for delay,
But lo ! on every hand the Wombywoo
With forceful art their tiring foes subdue ;
Horatius Gray secures control once more
And journeys down the centre as before.
But, not receiving so much strong support,
He found the task with arduous labour fraught
And, lest an error should his risk befall,
With prudent care to Parkes he kicked the ball
Behold again Braggs comes with reeling pace,


Dilated eyes, set teeth, and scowling face;
With arms upraised and hands clenched fiercely tight
Again he seeks to wreak his brutal spite,
But ill success his reckless rage attends,
For soon Horatius, warned by watchful friends,
Quick turning round, confronts his furious foe,
Averting thus the meditated blow.
Yet Braggs impelled by wild consuming hate
Threatened and fumed in a distracted state,
And closing in on Dray with subtle bound,
Around his girth his sinewy arms he wound ;
Then Gray one arm coiled round his rival?s waist,
The other underneath the chin he placed.
Then, thrusting back Braggs? head with forceful jerk,
Him he despatched with short and s ; mple work ;
Braggs with a groan relaxed his angry hold
And back to earth completely helpless rolled,
But soon recovering from the stunning blow,
Again jn foaming rage he sought his foe;
And now to all observers it was plain
The draught divine had mystified his brain
Inebriate with the celestial dew
Distilled by Bacchus and his jolly crew,
A mighty passion fires his surging soul ;


His eyes with rage distended flash and roll;
He pours on Gray the vials of his wrath
And loudly threatens all who cross his path.
Hector ashamed, his tingling cheeks aglow,
Observes with pain the scandal and the show,
Till, waxing wroth at the unseemly scene,
He rushes up with darkly-scowling mien
And from the field removes the erring Braggs
Whom by the ignominious heels he drags.
Again the time bells tinkling tone ascends
For the last time proclaiming change of ends ;
Now must the fight with fiercer zeal be fought
And every art with greater skill be wrought,
For now the game has to the crisis grown
When tougher tests the better team shall own.
VIII.
Three goals to two the heralds now proclaim ;
The Flats in triumph still maintain the game
And, as the ball is set in play again,
Both teams the combat urge with might and main.
Slowly the victory verged to Wombat Flat
Through the grand work of Swab and Samson Pratt;
Down to the goal with laboured pace they drew,
Hard-fought and hampered by the Wombywoo;


From right-wing back at length Rienzi White
Dashed through the open ranks with rapid flight,
But, as he sped upon his hasty way,
On the uneven turf he tript and lay;
Then Agamemnon Potts caught up the sphere ;
Timotheus Jenkins ? curbed his high career ; ?
Jenkins to Vane then passed the airy ball
Who bolted forward heedless of them all.
Onward with merry pace and artful force
He deftly pressed his deviating course;
From clutching foes he swiftly swerved aside
And safely from his fleet pursuers hied ;
Around the field the lusty plaudits ring
As on he speeds in triumph down the wing ;
From ladies fair their sweetest smiles were cast
To greet the handsome hero as he passed ;
See ! in the crowd dear Desdemona stands
Waving a kerchief in her waxen hands ;
Adonis marks his lady-love?s applause ;
Her gracious smile exalts his noble cause ;
Zantippe Vane at Desdemona?s side
Her nephew views with ecstasy and pride ;
Happy Adonis by their praise inspired
Still kept his course in style that all admired


And with a long drop-kick superbly done
He crowned at last the day?s most brilliant run.
Just as the ball had left his sprightly foot
Big Samson Pratt who came in hot pursuit
Shouldered Adonis with unbridled zeal
And sent him spinning like a Catherine-wheel.
Fair Desdemona marked her lover fall
And heard the indignant hiss from one and all;
Her gentle breast is racked with wild alarms,
She swoons away in Juliet Cubby?s arms
And, as the stupor o?er her senses came,
She murmured thrice Adonis?s dear name.
Not so Adonis?s unmarried aunt
Whose spirit none could rule and nothing daunt;
With pain she views her nephew lying low
And then with scorn surveys his stalwart foe
Nor long could she her rising wrath control
And she approached him with her parasol ;
With stealthy step she reached him from the back
And down upon his head brought one smart crack;
Quick to the rightabout fierce Samson turned
And in amaze his female foe discerned
From whose strong lungs loud accusations roll
With emphasisings of the parasol.


With courteous airs and mild apologies
He strives the wild Zantippe to appease :
? Presumptuous man, in vain dost thou essay
The torrent of a woman?s tongue to stay ;
?Go, push the shoreward ioiling ocean back
Or stop the earth in its diurnal track?
But lovely woman is in her sweet way
A despot with supreme linguistic sway.
Hast thou forgot the moral tales afford ?
Know then the tongue is mightier than the sword
Be wise and flee from the enraged dame ;
Thou art no match for her at her own game.?
?Twas thus Minerva unto Samson spoke
And from the Tartar?s tongue away he broke; .
Zantippe for a time could not forbear
But poured her threats out on the listless air,
Then to her nephew?s aid away she flies
But he upon the ground no longer lies ;
No hurt had he despite his heavy fall;
His great tenacity surprised them all.
Into the glorious fray he goes once more
With even greater ardour than before.
The ball was marked by Hector Jones meanwhile
Who beat Aurelius Brown in brilliant style ;


Aurelius to the mark expectant stands
And stops the ball with high-uplifted hands;
With artful handball Hector then he tricked
And in a trice to Smith the leather kicked ;
Down to the earth by Nelson Smith was brought
Just as the ball in arms secure he caught.
Loud swell the ringing cheers on every side,
For Smith?s precision had so oft been tried
That as a wonder it was widely known
And through the land had quite proverbial grown
Soon through the goal the airy globe is sent
?Mid frantic shouts that shake the firmament;
Mercurius Tate, impatient of delay,
Soon in the centre set the ball in play ;
Now both the teams on equal footing stand
And stoutly strive to gain the upper hand,
Applying to the task their utmost skill
They force the game with fierce and fiery will.
Big Ajax mustering all his manly might
Enacts the lion?s portion of the fight,
Receiving from his friends immense support
Awhile with great success he bravely fought
But all his noble efforts were in vain,
For soon the Wombywoo aroused again,


Their greater stamina begins to tell
And studious training now repays them well ;
Their ruck men seem with double strength renewed
The while the ? Flats ? relapse in flagging mood.
The Wombywoos maintain secure control
And work the leather to?ard the Wombat goal;
Alfonso Parkis and Cook the oval bring
With steady pace around the northern wing
Where, charged by both the Pratts with dire intent,
Out on the open field the ball is sent;
Now Griggs and Green both for the leather race
But Griggs possest by far the fleeter pace,
Yet not content with vanquishing his foe,
Some of his fancy form he needs must show ;
He passes Green in supercilious style,
Upon his lips a most contemptuous smile ;
Titus enraged a strenuous efforts makes
And his insulting foe soon overtakes ;
With crushing force he brought him to the ground ;
Thefearful shock was heard for yards around ;
And, while upon the field confused he lay,
In triumph Titus bore the ball away ;
Returning then the foe he thus addressed,
? Vain boaster ! where the pride thou once possess?! ?


Hath it dissolved like furnace-heated snow
That thus thou art content to lie so low?
Unthinking braggart ! did?st thou not expect
That pride should fall and insolence be checked ?
Thee shall I watch henceforth with lynx-like zeal
And my insatiate vengeance thou shalt feel.?
With haughty mien the warning Griggs defied
And leaping to his feet he thus replied,
? Cease, cease this idle vaunting of the breast ;
Let deeds not words thy frothy rage attest;
Think?st thou with empty breath me to affright
Schooled in the brunt of many a hard-fought fight ?
Then sheathe thy tongue or, if it must be so,
Come match our strength and meet thine overthrow
How often thus great boasters will appear
O?er weaker men to brag and domineer;
Relying on their consciousness of might
They dare the foe to the unequal fight
In all the bluster of heroic sham
Like the grim wolf that mocks the timid lamb,
Brave only when advantage they possess
And their superior strength predicts success ;
So Griggs, depending on ungenerous power,
Idly presumes to make his rival cower


But ill he reckons Green?s undaunted might
When stern occasion calls him to the fight.
The promptings of a noble soul impart
Strength to the arm and courage to the heart
And mightier foes with meaner souls endowed
Before their truer manliness are bowed.
Now as the ball is driven back once more.
And Griggs and Green strive for it as before,
Pain and dismay in Griggs?s looks are seen
As he beholds the bodeful glance of Green ;
And, as bold Titus paces by his side,
He feels his strength relax at every stride
Yet, lest his friends should mark his sorry plight,
He rouses and recalls his wavering might
But all his forced-up courage proves in vain,
For Titus brings him down to grass again
And, as he ruminates his second fall,
He sees his rival prance off with the ball.
Titus right up in front impelled the sphere
Where Parkes awaits it, not a rival near,
But Brutus Wilson heated by the play
With headlong bound obstructs his comrade?s way
The rueful act much irritation cost
For ?twixt the two a splendid chance was lost ;


Jones grasps the situation at a glance
And takes advantage of his foes? mischance ;
Between the twain he dashed with ready feet
A nd bore the ball away with footsteps fleet;
On to Ulysses Trott the ball he cast
From whom to Plato Graggs ?tis quickly passed ;
Away with hurried paces Plato flies,
Forward to goal a bee-line course he tries
But Dionysius meets him on the way
And overmastering him reverses play.
A winding course Dean for the left wing makes
Where Cyrus Pratt his gallant journey breaks ;
Herminius, coming to his comrade?s aid,
Despatching Pratt some genuine skill displayed ;
Ajax and Agamemnon he despoiled
And Samson and Ulysses fairly foiled ;
Each after each he overcame them all
And left-wing forward then propelled the ball.
Titus and Griggs once more for it contend
But Griggs?s reign of power is at an end ;
All hope, all courage his faint heart forsakes,
A weak, irresolute attempt he makes ;
Titus essays to lure him but in vain ;
The knave has no desire to fall again,


The ancient adace he hath learnt by heart :
? Of valour prudence is the better part ?
Titus with scorn sees Griggs?s pride subdued
And with the ball his open path pursued,
Across to Smith he drove the leather straight
But on Achilles close the back-men wait;
Nelson and Snooks with one conspiring bound
Annul his chance and bring him to the ground.
Ulysses swiftly brought the ball away
And down the field the ?Wombats ? push the play ;
The game once more looked hopeful for ? The Flat ?
As Ajax forward-marked to Cyrus Pratt;
From Pratt?s long kick then ? Boney ? strove to mark
But failed to wrest the envied prize from Clark ;
Columbus passed to Vane without delay
And he propelled as quickly on to dray ;
A long drop kick Horatius contemplates
And, till the ruck get forward, calmly waits ;
Then to the ball he puts his foot?s full weight,
Sending it sailing forward far and straight.
As. circling through the air, the ball descends
Each side for bold supremacy contends
But, whilst they fiercely for possession fight,
Summoning to the work their utmost might,


Achilles Smith advancing from the rear
Leapt o?er them all and seized the circling sphe-ie,
The brilliant feat evokes prolonged applaus
And ev?n from foes great admiration draws
And, as he views the narrow goal once more,
Of yards from where he stands a triple score,
He calls upon the Gods his aim to bless
And graciously to crown him with success.
Now in the earth he delves his sturdy heel
While all in silence wait the great ordeal;
Within the hollow place he plants the sphere
And takes ten steady paces to the rear
And then advancing his elastic foot
With great precision to the globe he put;
Straight as an arrow the unerring ball
Sped on its course to the strained gaze of all
And through the goal, untouched, it won its way,
For none had power its headlong flight to stay.
Up go the dual pennons and forthwith
The echoing skies record the name of Smith ;
The frantic crowd the wild applause prolong
In glad vociferation loud and strong ;
Cheer after cheer ascends with deafening force
Till palates parch and throats are hot and hoarse.


Mercurius Tate soon sets the ball in play
And Wombywoo sweeps on with crushing sway ;
The Wombat Flats their failing strength exert
And gamely strive the conquest to avert
But all in vain their plucky efforts prove ;
Their storming foes all obstacles remove
And pressing forward with collective force
They rally still on their triumphant course.
Right into goal the breathless fight they urge
And there awhile the players seethe and surge.
The grand excitement wild and wilder grows ;
They scarcely can distinguish friends from foes ;
In frenzied haste and blind confusion thrown
Each seeks to conquer by his strength alone
But, as they thus with frantic heat contend,
The bell proclaims the combat at an end.
Four goals to three the records now display
And Wombywoo has won the glorious day.
Twice t-venty youths now on the green parade
And every twain on shoulders high conveyed
A Wombywoo from the victorious field ;
Amid the cheers and shouts that thunder-pealed
To the great tent they bear their noble freight
Where thronging friends praise and congratulate


Awhile the band with much excess of drums
Extemporise ? The Conquering hero comes.?
Sempronius Quill then made a witty speech,
Extolled the victois, and shook hands with each ;
His promised invitation he extends
Unto the Wombywoo and all their friends.
Johnson and Tate and young Adonis Vane
Were toasted in deep floods of rare champagne ;
The Wombat Flats were duly entertained.
In friendly flowing bowls their health was drained
At length, the pleasant ceremonies o?er,
With jocund song they steer for home once more
The multitude their different ways pursue
But gayer go the hearts to Wombywoo ;
The Wombat Flats upon their homeward way
Are glum as belles on a wet holiday.
* * * *
Here let me leave the jovial Wombywoos
And with all due respect dismiss the Muse ;
I cannot go like that discourteous crew
Who part from her without the least adieu ;
I>ll touch the tangled harp-strings once again
And wraft her homeward with a loving strain :
Fair Goddess, to thy starry throne ascend,


,-x>C^�^Ooo-
For now my tedious tale is at an end,
Yet not farewell, sweet song-inspiring Maid,
May I not further hope thy kindly aid ?
What, though I have unstrung thy tuneful lyre
And thy bright skirts bedraggled in the mire !
Apollo shall repair each golden string,
Attuning it with new and mellower ring ;
And long-haired Naiads on Parnassus mount
With water from the pure Castahan fount
Shall wash thy garments whiter far than snow,
Till they shall shimmer with their wonted glow
Bring my best love to thy fair sister band
And ask their favour for the Austral land ;
May winged Loves and singing Zephyrs bear
Thy radiant being through the perfumed air ;
Mount, mount to thy celestial home once more
I kiss my hand saluting, ? Au revoir ! ?
Hickling & Powell, Prints., Brunswick, East.
