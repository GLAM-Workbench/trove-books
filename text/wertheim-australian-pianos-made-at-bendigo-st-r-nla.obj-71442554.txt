RICHMOND, MELBOURNE
HAT business knowledge and application, backed by Capital, can do is realised when
we see that which but a short time since was mere waste desert ground, inhabited
only by the insect world, converted to-day into an orderly quadrangle, covered with
vast scientifically constructed buildings containing hundreds of skilled workmen, under
whose hands the material which has entered in Natures raw state issues forth a new, finished,
intricate artificial organism, to add to the happiness and well-being of mankind.
The looker-on may watch the waggons conveying huge trunks of trees and masses of metal
into the great Factory which stands on what a year or so ago was but a piece of waste land in
Richmond, and, if he but wait long enough, will see this same raw material issuing again as that
most intricate of modern inventions the Pianoforte. He may enter and observe every stage, every
detail of this transformation. He will find, indeed, that whatever the accumulated experience of the
world has had to teach regarding safety, convenience, and sanitation has been embodied in the
construction of the buildings, and that the machinery of every department is of the latest pattern,
comprising all the most ingenious devices for assisting and perfecting labour.

WERTHEIM AUSTRALIAN PIANOS
Pianoforte-making being a new industry in Victoria, it has been necessary to import skilled
artisans to instruct our local workmen, and, needless to say, these latter have been invariably
selected for special efficiency and intelligence.
Possessing then perfect buildings, the most approved plant, and thoroughly capable artisans,
together with that experience which a long connection with the Pianoforte Trade affords, we feel
that we are enabled to enter into competition with other makers of the highest celebrity confident
of success. For, surely, what can be done by a German, an Englishman, or an American can be
equally well done, and perhaps even bettered, by an Australian. A little consideration will show
that this is not mere boast, but quite a practical possibility.
Here on the spot there is a much better opportunity of judging the effect of our hotter climate
on the material. The durability and perfection of an instrument depend entirely on its being
constructed in such a way as to resist the varying degrees of heat and moisture to which it is
subject. The problem in Australia differs in every particular from that in Europe. The Australian
output forms such a small fraction of the trade of European makers that they cannot give to the
all-important factor of climatic conditions the same attention which obtains on the spot. In many
cases, also, Australian woods are in their very nature more suitable than foreign woods for our
special conditions. Besidas this, there are many mechanical devices for obviating shrinkage and
expansion which form a part of our system of building, and which are quite unnecessary in colder
climates. These facts are of fundamental importance.
It is well known that European exporters do not as a rule send out their best instruments,
for which there is a ready immediate market at their doors. There is a tendency to look on any-
thing as good enough for remote Australia. We, on the contrary, stake our reputation on every

instrument produced in our Factory. Living in the midst of our customers we are, in a kind of
way, on our honour to put forward only such instruments as after due testing we know to be
worthy of our reputation.
It must be remembered that beauty of tone, elasticity of touch and durability depend, not only
on one or two evident factors but on the care with which every detail of the material has been
selected and tested, and on the attention bestowed on the manifold component parts which go to
make up the instrument. We leave nothing to chance. Every piece of wood that enters our
Factory has its history docketed from the day it comes in to the day it goes out. The manifold
processes by which it is seasoned and prepared are all accurately noted, and thus genuineness is
guaranteed. Wcrtheim Pianos are Australian made. We are proud of that fact, and believe
Australians will be proud of it too, but it is not our intention to make that our claim to your
support. We recognise the fact that every assertion made for the Wertheim Pianos has to be
fulfilled?that the instruments themselves must create the evidence on which our reputation will be
built. Our energies now, and always, will be in the direction of progress.
We had the accumulated experience of the world?s greatest factories to work on. We visited
them all ?gathering an idea here, getting a hint there?and garnered a rich harvest in valuable
information. We considered everything, sifted everything, and the result is, we believe, the most
replete and up-to-date Factory in the world. It is equipped with the most modern and approved
plant that money can buy.
Those who direct the destiny of the new Wertheim Factory are men who have spent their
lives in the piano business. They have studied and thought along scientific lines. They know
exactly what class of instrument Australian climatic conditions demand, and are strong in their
determination to produce that instrument in its best form

The foremen in charge of the various departments are the picked best of the world?s most-
renowned factories. Each man is a specialist ?an artist?in his particular branch.
No trouble, no expense have been spared to ensure for our instruments the most durable
construction. Only the best of high-grade materials is employed, and every piece of timber is
thoroughly and naturally seasoned for many years, as well as kiln-dried before being used. This
process is all-important in the manufacture of pianos, as it does away with any possibility of
shrinkage or displacement after construction, so injurious to the permanent durability of an
instrument. We never hold less than ten years? supply of timber in our seasoning sheds. Minutest
attention is concentrated even on the smallest of details, as each branch of construction is carried
out by skilled workmen under the supervision of experts?specialists in their own particular lines.
All the many departments are on the same floor level, thus affording easy access from one
department to another. The principal divisions comprise: timber-seasoning sheds, sawmills, drying
kilns, wood-working machines, joiners? shops, veneer matching, veneering, sounding-board making,
drilling and enamelling shops for iron frames, case making, stringing, action fitting, regulating, tuning,
polishing, and finally despatch room.
Each department or workshop is divided from the adjoining shops by fireproof division walls
and doors. The whole factory is lofty, airy, well lighted, the building being so grouped and arranged
that full advantage is taken of the daylight. Over a hundred huge plate glass windows, containing
10,000 square feet of glass, are provided in the building.

planks are built of several layers of thoroughly seasoned hardwood, each layer crossing
the grain of the preceding one at right angles, thus rendering any splitting, warping, or yielding a

matter of utter impossibility. Once the tuning pin is fixed into these layers, it stays where it is
placed, thus keeping the piano permanently in perfect tune. The tuning pin is further supported by
a collar of hardest Beechwood, fitting closely round the tuning pin, reducing the heavy leverage and
preventing the pin from coming into contact with the iron frame. We thus avoid the undesirable
metallic quality of tone which always results whenever contact is made between strings and metal frame.
The iron framework of the Wertheim Pianos is of one piece, unusually heavy, and
IRON FRAME made f rom a blending of metals which produces a frame of tremendous strength
and uniform density. This plate is cast from a special pattern designed by us along scientific lines,
so as to secure not only the utmost of strength to resist the great strain of the strings, which
represents 20 tons, but also uniformity of scale, etc.
The sounding-board has been well called the soul of the pianoforte, and it is the
SOUNDING- j m p 0r f an f par f 0 f the entire structure. The tone is largely dependent upon it,
BOARD and c h arac ter of the tone is controlled to a great extent by the character of
the board, the quality of the wood from which it is made, the manner in which its different
sections are matched and prepared, the care taken and the labour expended. A properly pre-
pared sounding-board may be likened to a ploughed field which produces the richest kind of
harvest, while to expect a full sympathetic tone from a piano in which the board is deficient is akin
to looking for crops from sterile land. True, the casing, the strings, the hammers, the scale, and the
manifold factors which go to make up the instrument do affect the resultant tone: but it is the
sounding-board more than any other one factor which determines the tone quality. Two artistic
instruments, as near as possible alike in other respects but one containing a poor sounding-board
and the other a distinctly fine sounding-board, would produce tones at once distinguishable?a

commonplace quality characterising the tone of the former, while an exquisite, superb musical tone
would come from the latter. The Wertheim Sounding-board is scientifically shaped by experts of
tried ability and many years? experience in Continental factories of great repute.
ACTION AND ere are wo ou t s t an ding qualities which stamp a piano as good or bad. We
TONE refer t0 the qualities tone and touch - ,n these two particulars the "Wertheim?
has attained the height of perfection. It combines both the rich full volume of
tone, exquisitely pure, sympathetic, with a mellow singing quality, and that light, easy responsive-
ness of touch to the finest degree which for years has been the chief aim of piano makers.
Brilliantly responsive to the slightest touch, the Wertheim Pianos embrace the latest and most
scientific tuning principles, and we have adopted only those devices which have proved ever-
lasting in their durability and perfect in their tone production. For full sonorous volume of tone,
distinguished by its mellow quality, our instruments will challenge comparison with the product of
the world?s oldest and most-renowned factories.
CASE DESIGNS CaSe * s art istically carried out, and cannot fail to appeal to the
most fastidious of tastes. We produce splendid examples of architectural skill.
There is a distinctive beauty in Australian woods which makes them peculiarly suitable for
decorative purposes. The woods of no other countries possess quite the same characteristic
delicacy and variety of grains and tints. A case made out of the Queensland silky Oak, for
instance, is as strikingly original as it is fascinating and elegant in its effect. It charms and attracts
the eye with its unusual yet delicate mosaic. Then there is the more grave and massive style
suggested by the rich depth of the Tasmanian and Victorian Blackwood. While the Fiddle-back,
appropriately so named, suggests the glow and fire which we see in old Italian violins. Then there are
excellent samples of more known woods, such as Queensland Rosewood, Crow?s EJm, Satinwood,

FINISHED cons^ruc^on their Wrest Planks, Sounding-boards, etc,, in fact in the whole
ARTICLE building up of the cases in so many cross-sections and layers, our pianos are expen-
sively made in the very parts which do not show. No attempt is made to make
quantity at the expense of quality. No attempt is made to rival the enormous output of makers
of cheap pianos. No instrument is hurried through our factory, but each takes the full time by
which alone a perfect piano can be made and fully tested before being delivered to a purchaser.
There is only one way to make a superior piano, that is the old-fashioned conservative painstaking
way, and it is necessarily expensive.
No other pianos so thoroughly embody the advancement of piano construction as the
Wertheim. ,, Perfection is the word that best describes the ? Wertheim.? Minutest attention is
given to the smallest detail, and faithful fidelity to the highest canons of Art. We claim, and
behind that claim is our reputation, that there is no instrument at present on the market which
will prove so satisfactory and economical in the long run as the ? Wertheim.? We have made
many claims and many assertions. We made them wittingly and in the full understanding that
they would have to be substantiated. That they will be we are confident?so confident, in fact,
that every piano which leaves our showrooms bears with it a ten years? guarantee. Beyond this
period no guarantee has any commercial value, for any defect in construction or material will have
made itself manifest long before.
To have been first is proof only of antiquity;
To become first is proof of Merit.

The iron frame is made from a blending of several metals, which produces a frame of tremendous
strength and uniform density. It is scientifically modelled in conjunction with the wrest plank to resist
the great tension of the strings (equal to many tons) to which it is subjected. It is securely bolted to solid
upright bracings, adding to the enormous power of resistance. The wrest plank is laminated or built up of
several layers of thoroughly seasoned hardwoods, each layer crossing the grain of

pins with the iron frame, the
holes in the iron frame are bushed with collars of well-seasoned hardwoods,
which tightly embrace each tuning pin. We thus avoid all harsh and metallic
sound.
The Action of the ? Wertheim? is distinguished owing to the elasticity and
perfect evenness of touch, combining both delicacy and strength. It is supported
in position by three beautifully finished iron standards, which makes the action
thoroughly stable, prevents warping of the centre rail, which is the pivot of the
action, and thus keeps the mechanism in correct adjustment. It is under-damper,
check-repeating, with front escapement, embodying all improvements that tend
to ensure an elastic and responsiVe touch. Where, in addition to the forte and
the half-blow, a third pedal-?the Celeste?is provided, the latter produces a
charmingly soft, sweet dolce, the most effective soft pedal ever devised, and
most useful for practising. The wires are oblique overstrung; the pedal action
is simple, strong, and quite noiseless.

artistic sense will approve of.
