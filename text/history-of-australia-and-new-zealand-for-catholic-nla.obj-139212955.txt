INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
The school histories of Australia which have
hitherto been published, though more or less
meritorious from a secular standard, are wanting in
one essential for Catholic children—they ignore
religion. It is to supply this want that this little
book has been prepared.
The portion dealing with the history of the Church
in the colonies, her trials and triumphs, has been
derived in the main from the elaborate “ History of
the Church in Australasia,” by His Eminence
Cardinal Moran, the “ Progress of Catholicity in
Australia,” by the late Yery R,ev. Dean Kenny, and
the Yery Rev. Dr. Byrne’s “ History of the Catholic
Church in South Australia.” The civil history
includes a brief account of the early maritime
discoveries, the chief inland explorations, and the
principal political events of Australia and New
Zealand.

HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA
FOR
CATHOLIC SCHOOLS.
CHAPTER I.
EARLY DISCOVERIES.
The date of the discovery of Australia is not known
with any degree of certainty. Yague ideas of the
existence of a Great South Land were held by Strabo,
Pliny, Marco Polo, and others. Some writers main-
tain that Magellan’s followers sighted the western
coast in 1522, and in a French manuscript chart, dated
1542, is figured, lying to the south of the Moluccas,
an extensive territory (called Jave la grande — i.e .,
Great Java) which agrees fairly well both as regards
extent and position with the northern portion of
Australia. This map is supposed to have been
copied from a previously existing Portuguese chart,
and on this account the Portuguese are now generally
credited with the honour of being the first Europeans
to set foot on Australian soil.
Cornells Houtman, 1597.— 1 n 1597 Cornells
Houtman, a Portuguese pilot in the service of the
Dutch East India Company, is said to have sighted
and given the name of Houtmaris Abrolhos to a group
of rocky islets lying about 45 miles to the north-west
of Champion Bay, in Western Australia. (The term
Abrolhos is a contraction of a Portuguese expression
meaning “ keep your eyes open.”)


De Quiros and Torres, 1606. —The first really
trustworthy accounts of discoveries in Australian
waters date from the early part of the 17th century.
Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, a Spanish navigator, who
had discovered some of the Polynesian islands in 1595,
in his ambition to rival the great Spanish discoverers,
Cortes and Pizarro, prevailed upon the King of SjDain,
Philip 111., to supply him with means to under-
take a search for the Great South Land. He procured
a letter from the Pope, “ commanding all good
Christians to help him,” and, in addition, His Holi-
ness gave a special blessing to his undertaking. The
expedition, which consisted of three ships, was fitted
out by the Governor of Peru, acting under orders
from Philip. He Quiros commanded the small
squadron, and Torres, another Spanish navigator, was
second in command. Sailing westward from Lima,
Tahiti was discovered early in 1606, and soon after,
“on the feast of Pentecost, 1606, he saluted from afar
what appeared to him to be the Great Southern
Continent of which he was in search, and gave it, in
honour of the festival which was that day celebrated,
the name “Tierra Austral del Espiritu Santo,” which
has been justly translated £ Australia of the Holy
Ghost.’ ” Further on in the work from which this
extract is quoted, His Eminence Cardinal Moran
submits evidence which shows very clearly that the
territory in which He Quiros anchored was Port
Curtis (on the east coast of Queensland), which he
named the Harbour of Holy Cross. It appears,
further, that He Quiros built a church on the main-
land, where twenty Masses were celebrated and
attended by all his men. Mutiny on board his ship,
the Capitana , loss of some of his crew, and sickness
of others, compelled He Quiros, it has been supposed,
to return to America before ascertaining the extent
of his discovery. All that is recorded of his hasty
departure homewards is the following statement in


Torres' account of the voyage : “At one hour past
midnight the Capitana departed without any notice
given to us and without making any signal.” Torres,
after waiting many days in vain for the return of De
Quiros, set sail also, and passed safely through the
strait dividing Australia from New Guinea which now
bears his name. He reached Manila in 1607, but the
records of his voyages lay unknown until 1762, when,
after the capture of that city by the British, the
Admiralty authorities had them translated and pub-
lished. On reaching Acapulco, De Quiros sent a
memorial to the King of Spain, with an account of
his discoveries, praying to be entrusted with
another expedition. His prayer was granted after
some delay, but he died at Panama on his way to
Lima.
The Dutch. —The Dutch in 1606 sent out from
Bantam, in the East Indies, a small vessel, the
Duyfhen (Dove), to explore the southern coast of
New Guinea. The Gulf of Carpentaria, on the
eastern side, was also explored as far as Cape
Keerweer (Turnagain), where some of the crew
landed. Many of them were killed by the blacks,
whereupon the captain was glad to turn his ship
homewards. For ten years no more discoveries
were made, but in 1616 Dirk Hartog*, another
Dutch navigator, visited the west coast of Aus-
tralia in the Endracht (Concord), and landed on
the island in Shark Bay, called after him. He
examined the coastline from 26|-° to 23° S.
and gave it the name of Eyidracht Land. Among
other Dutch navigators of this period may be men-
tioned Jan Carstens, who sailed along the northern
shore of Australia in the Arnheim , and had the mis-
fortune to lose eight of his crew, who were murdered
by the blacks. Captain Edel, in 1619, explored much
of the western coast, and the Leeuwin (Lioness), in
1622, sailed around the southern coast from Cape


Leeuwin to King George’s Sound. Peter Nuyts, in
the Guide Zeepard (Golden Sea Horse), in 1627,
explored the Great Australian Bight as far as the
archipelago bearing his name. His account of the
land he sailed along was just as unfavourable as those
furnished by his predecessors.
Proposed Settlement. —Nevertheless, the Hutch
determined, in 1628, to form a settlement on the western
shores of New Holland, as Australia was then called.
For this purpose a fleet of eleven ships, under the
command of Commodore Francis Pelsart, was des-
patched from Holland in that year. All went well
with the colonising expedition until rounding the
Cape of Good Hope, where contrary winds separated
the ships. Soon after, Pelsart’s vessel was wrecked
off Houtman’s Abrolhos, but these islands and
the adjacent mainland having little or no water, he
was obliged to proceed in an open boat to Batavia
for assistance and provisions. During Pelsart’s
absence, the supercargo (Jerome Cornelis) and a por-
tion of the shipwrecked crew formed a conspiracy
to seize him on his return, take charge of the ship,
and turn pirates. Many who refused to join this
band of desperadoes were cruelly murdered, but a
number who had taken refuge on another island close
by valiantly defended themselves, and anxiously
awaited the return of the Commodore. On his return,
Pelsart’s suspicions were aroused by the unusual
appearance of a boatload of his crew, who put off to
meet him dressed up in rich costumes made from the
silks and other fine stuffs that formed part of the
cargo of the Batavia. The mutineers (with the excep-
tion of two who were marooned on the mainland near
Champion Bay to become a prey to the blacks), were
summarily punished by hanging, and the idea of
making a permanent settlement was then abandoned.
Tasman, 1642. —Abel Jansen Tasman was sent


out in 1642 by Antony Yan Diemen, Governor of
the Dutch possessions in the East, on a discovery
expedition. He discovered Tasmania, which he
named Yan Diemen’s Land, and which he believed
to be part of the mainland of Australia. He
reported the country to be inhabited by giants, not
knowing that the notches, five feet apart, cut in the
trunks of the trees, were used by the aborigines in
climbing after opossums. The same year Tasman dis-
covered New Zealand, which he believed to be one
island. Afterwards he discovered the Friendly
Islands, Fiji, and other small groups in the Pacific.
In 1644 Tasman was sent out in the Limmen to
determine, among other things, whether New Guinea
was connected with the Great South Land. He sur-
veyed the Gulf of Carpentaria, which he named after
Governor-General Carpentier, of Batavia. Many of the
bays and islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria still bear
names significant of Tasman’s visit ( e.g ., Limmen Bight ,
named after his ship, and Maria Island , named after
Maria Yan Diemen, the daughter of Antony Yan
Diemen).
Vlaming*, 1696. —The “ Swan River,” so called
from the numerous black swans found there, was
discovered by Ylaming in the Geelvink (Goldfinch),
while in search of a Dutch cargo vessel that had been
lost, it was thought, on the west coast of Australia.
After carefully examining the coast from the Swan
River to the North-west Cape he sailed for 1 Batavia,
taking with him two black swans, which were at that
time considered a prodigy.
William Dampier, 1688 and 1699,- The world
is indebted to William Dampier, a buccaneering,
roving Englishman, for the first genuine account of
the north-western parts of Australia, written in a
vivid narrative style. Tired of his piratical
pursuits in the West Indies, he, in 1688, joined a


vessel commanded by Captain Swan, a friCiid of his,
and intended for trade on the South American coast.
The crew, however, mutinied and became pirates.
Eventually the vessel reached the Philippine Islands,
where the captain and forty others were put on shore
and left to their fate. Dampier remained on the ship,
and, with the remainder of the crew, proceeded in
quest of a quiet spot where his vessel could be cleaned
and repaired without interruption. This he found in
Cygnet Bay, an offshoot of King Sound, on the north-
west coast of Australia, and near a group of islets
which he called “ Buccaneers’ Archipelago.” During
his sojourn of over two months, Dampier, who ap
pears to have avoided the society of the rough
buccaneers as much as possible, made a careful ex-
amination of the surrounding country. He noted the
land and sea breezes (which he quaintly describes),
the habits and manners of the natives, the plants and
animals peculiar to the country, and all of his re-
marks on these matters show a keen observation and
a critical judgment. Dampier quitted the vessel at
the Kicobar Islands, from which he reached Sumatra
in a canoe, and, after many adventures, reached Eng-
land. He afterwards published an account of his
voyages, which the fertile imagination of Defoe made
the ground work of his delightful novel, “ Robinson
Crusoe.”
Moved by a restless spirit, and influenced by power-
ful patrons, Dampier, after a short retirement on his
estate in England, undertook another voyage to Hew
Holland, to decide whether it was a continent or only
an archipelago. He sailed in the Roebuck under an
Admiralty commission, and on Ist August, 1699,
arrived at Shark Bay, where he spent eight days
in a fruitless search for water. He explored the
north-west coast for 1000 miles, and describes it as a
barren and waterless desert, while the inhabitants
appeared to him to be the most miserable and de-


graded on the face of the earth, disgusting and
repulsive both in appearance and habits. He described
the kangaroo as “ a strange creature like a racoon,
which used only its hind legs, and, instead of walking,
advanced by great bounds or leaps of twelve or fifteen
feet at a time.”
In 1705 Martin Van Delft conducted the last
voyage of exploration undertaken by the Dutch. He
sailed along the north coast, but the results of the
voyage were in no way important.
Captain James Cook, 1770,— The British Go-
vernment, in 1768, sent out a small expedition for a
double purpose —to observe the transit of Yenus in the
South Seas, and to explore New Zealand. The com-
mand was given to the admirable and intrepid
navigator, Captain Cook, whom New South Wales
has honoured with a statue in Sydney. A small
vessel, the Endeavour , was supplied him. Accom-
panying him were two naturalists, Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander, a pupil of the
celebrated Linnaeus, besides Mr. Green, a well-known
astronomer, Mr. Buchan, a draughtsman, and Mr.
Parkinson, an artist. Arrived at Tahiti, the first
part of his mission was admirably carried out, the
observations of the transit having been very suc-
cessful. That accomplished, he directed his course
towards New Zealand, which he circumnavigated
and mapped. Then, after passing through Cook’s
Strait, he sailed west and sighted Australia near
Cape Howe. Continuing his course northwards he gave
to the chief headlands and inlets he passed names
significant of their appearance or in honour of his
friends and patrons, and on 28th April, 1770, he
reached Botany Bay, where he remained ten days.
The natives resisted his landing, and were quite hostile
during his stay, notwithstanding the numerous efforts
he made to be friendly with them. The names of the


naturalists, Banks and Solander, were given to the
two headlands of the bay. When he left Botany Bay
he sailed north. He did not enter Port Jackson,
thinking from the narrow entrance it was only a
boat harbour, but in honour of his friend, Sir George
Jackson, he gave it the name it has ever since
borne. He continued his voyage, passing and naming
several prominent features on the coast— e.g., Broken
Bay, Smoky Cape, Point Danger, &c.—until he reached
the Queensland coast. Still sailing northward, his
vessel struck on the Great Barrier Beef, and only
after strenuous efforts did he succeed in getting her
off. It was soon found, however, that she was
leaking badly, and in this condition she was brought
with all possible haste to the shore at the mouth of a
stream called by Cook the Endeavour. On beaching
ihe vessel there it was found that a large lump of
coral had pierced her timbers, and, remaining fast
in the hole it had made, saved the vessel from
foundering. Having effected the necessary repairs
Cook sailed northward past Cape York, near which
he took possession of the whole of the eastern coast
of Hew Holland for George 111., bestowing upon it
the name of Hew South Wales.


CHAPTER IT.
COLONISATION OF NEW SOUTH WALES
The loss of the American colonies led to the
colonisation of Australia. After the “ Declaration
of Independence,” in 1776, English convicts could
no longer be sent to Virginia, and the English
Government had therefore to look out for a new
penal settlement. Cook’s “Botany Bay ” occurred to
them. From his account of the eastern seaboard
it was a pleasant, fertile, promising land —in
marked contrast with the gloomy western shores,
as described by Dampier. It was, moreover, so
distant from civilisation that there was no danger
of convicts, once there, making their escape. All these
considerations had weight with Viscount Sydney, who
w T as at that time Secretary of State for the Colonies,
and he determined to plant a convict colony in New
South Wales. Captain Arthur Phillip (1788-
1792) was selected to command the expedition and
to be first Governor of the settlement.
First Fleet. —The “first fleet ” consisted of the
20-ton frigate Sirius , its tender the Supply (under
Captain John Hunter), with three storeships, and
six transports for conveying the criminals (756 in
number, of whom 192 were women), and a guard of
378 soldiers. The fleet sailed from England in May,
1787, and arrived at Botany Bay on the 18th, 19th,
and 20th January, 1788.
Port Jackson. —After a day or two’s experience
of Botany Bay, its shores were deemed unsuitable as
a site for the future settlement. Its waters were
hallow and afforded no safe anchorage, and the ships


being unable to proceed very far up the bay, had to
lie near the heads exposed to winds and waves.
Phillip at once saw that it was unsuitable, and
without delay set out in search of a better site.
This he soon discovered in Port Jackson, with
whose beauty and extent he was in raptures.
He was at first undecided whether to settle on
the north or south shore of the harbour, but the
discovery of a small stream of fresh water running
into an inlet which he called Sydney Cove decided
his selection. On 26th January (known ever since
as Anniversary Hay) the ships were brought round
from Botany and anchored in the Cove The prisoners
were landed, and at once set to work clearing the
land. A flagstaff was erected, volleys were discharged
by the marines, and the Governor read his commission.
He also delivered a kindly address to the convicts,
and advised them as to their future conduct. This
done, little time was lost in providing for the shelter
and other material wants of the little community.
Religion. —lt is strange and unaccountable that
Captain Phillip, who is credited with prudence,
sagacity, and foresight, and who was most zealous in
preparations for the expedition, made no provision for
the spiritual wants of the men, women, and children
committed to his charge. Ho minister of religion,
schoolmaster, or teacher was appointed to instruct the
ignorant. Was the oversight his fault, or that of the
Government? Was it owing to thoughtlessness or
indifference to religion ? Whatever the cause, it was
a great mistake, a national calamity, and cost the
Government dear. Religion is divine. To it we owe
our civilisation, our good laws, our salutary institu-
tions. Its influence is felt universally, where truth
and virtue abound. Had Phillip had its ministers to
instruct and console the convicts, he would not have
been “ forced to govern with the lash and the hang-
man’s rope.” It was not for want of being reminded


of tlieir duty that the Government neglected their
obligation to the fallen colonists. The Rev. Father
Thomas Walshe, an Irish priest, petitioned Lord
Sydnsy to permit himself and a brother priest
to go out to minister to the spiritual wants of
their co-religionists. They volunteered their services
without fee or reward, merely asking for their passage.
Their truly Catholic and self-sacrificing appeal was
not entertained, nay, it was not even acknowledged.*
This is Father Walshe’s letter :
My Lord,
You have been apprised of the desire which two
clergymen of the Catholic persuasion have to instruct the
convicts, who are of their faith, and who are destined for
Botany Bay. I beg leave to inform your Lordship of my senti-
ments concerning this request. There are not less, probably,
than 300, ignorant, you may imagine, of every principle of
duty to God and man. The number is great, and consequently
constitutes an object of consequence to every man who has
the happiness of his neighbour at heart. That the Catholics
of this country are not only of inoffensive principles, but that
they are zealously attached to the constitution of it, I may
presume, is well known to your Lordship. For my part, who
am one of those clergymen who wish to take care of the con-
victs of my persuasion, I beg to acquaint your Lordship that
if I be so happy as to be permitted to go, I trust my en-
deavours to bring these unhappy people to a proper sense of
their duty as subjects and citizens may be attended with some
salutary consequence. They earnestly desire some Catholic
clergyman may go with them, and I trust to the known
humanity of the Government that a request which seems to
promise some hopes of their reformation wdll not be denied.
It is well known that these people will not pay the attention
to the other ministers which they will to their own. Perhaps,
also, the presence of their priests may be of great use to make
them readily obey every order of their Governor, and I have
no doubt our conduct will meet the approbation of them.
I sincerely pity those poor people, not so much for the
disagreeable situation into which they have brought them-
selves, as for the misdemeanours which have made them
deserving of it. Yet, I trust if their ignorance be removed,
and their obligations as men and Christians be forcibly incul-
* See Barton’s History of New South Wales, from the Records, Vol. 1., p. 51,


cated to them, that this may be a means, under Providence, of
their becoming useful to themselves, and perhaps afterwards
to their country.
At least this I sincerely wish. Nor do I think I car. ever
be as happy elsewhere as in the place of their destination,
employed in using my endeavours to bring them out of the
wretched state of depravity into which they have fallen. I
entreat, therefore, most humbly, that this our request may
be granted. These poor people will bless and thank you. I
shall take care that they be not forgetful of their obligations
to the Governor and Lord Sydney.
I have the honour of subscribing myself,
Your Lordship’s most humble servant,
Thomas Walshe, Priest.
P S.— My Lord, —We are not so presumptuous as to
wish support from the Government; we offer our voluntary
services. We hope, however, not to offend in entreating for
our passage.
This petition breathes throughout the true spirit of
the missionary priest.
One minister of religion only—the Rev. Richard
Johnson—accompanied the fleet. At the eleventh
hour he was appointed at the earnest request of a
Protestant bishop.
Troubles and Suffering's of Early Colonists.
—The work of clearing the land for building pur-
poses and cultivation was rapidly proceeded with.
It was soon found that the bulk of the convicts
were idle, lazy, and improvident, more inclined to
pull down rather than build up—adepts at steal-
ing, but useless as farm hands. None of them knew
anything of farming. The only man in the settle-
ment who had any knowledge of planting and sowing
was one of the Governor’s servants, tinder those
circumstances but little food could be raised from the
soil, though a supply was much needed, for the pro-
visions that had been brought were running short.
Starvation staring the young colony in the face, the
Governor despatched the Supply to Batavia and the
Sirius to Cape Colony for stores. They returned with
only a few weeks’ stock, and soon the outlook was as


gloomy as before. All the inhabitants, from the
Governor downwards, were put on short rations and
numbers died of starvation. The colony was relieved
by sending 280 persons to Norfolk Island, where they
were expected to support themselves by the cultivation
of its fertile soil. The Sirius , which conveyed them
thither, struck on a rock at the island, but fortunately
there was no loss of life. The arrival of a second lot
of convicts did not tend to lessen the prevailing
trouble and distress. Disease, neglect, and sickness had
left their marks upon the new arrivals. Few if any
out of the 1500 were fit for anything but the infirmary
or hospital. But the darkest hour had passed. Three
store ships arrived most opportunely, bringing pro-
visions sufficient to dispel all fears of famine, and
never afterwards were the convicts exposed to such
terrible privations as they had undergone.
The First Catholics. —In addition to their share
of the corporeal sufferings that threatened destruction
to the infant settlement, the Catholic portion of the
community had to bear the cross of spiritual destitu-
tion. Other convicts had their clergymen—they had
none; and, when the best-disposed of them met under
a clump of gum trees or other shady retreat to recite
the Rosary, read the litanies or prayers at Mass, they
were accused of plotting rebellion, and forbidden,
under the severest pains and penalties, to meet
together for any purpose.
When New South Wales was founded in 1788, the
penal laws against Catholics were in full force
throughout the British dominions. The toleration to
teach their religion and to worship God in their own
way, now happily prevailing under most governments,
was then denied them. The golden rule, to do to
others as we would have others do unto us, was little
observed in those days ; and nowhere, perhaps, and
possibly by no others was its non-observance so much


felt as by tlie Catholic convicts of Sydney. Theirs
was a hard lot. In spiritual matters they were worse
off than the early Christians. The first Christians in
Rome could fulfil and attend to the duties of public
worship, under privations, difficulties, and dangers
no doubt, but still they could do so. The first
Catholics of Australia were bereaved of all spiritual
comfort and consolations. They had no priest to
celebrate Mass for them, to instruct them, or admin-
ister the sacraments to them. Further, they were
the victims of intolerant prejudice. They were forced
to attend the services of the Church of England for
twelve years—l7Bß to 1800. Liberty of conscience
was denied them. Their rulers assumed that their
souls as well as their bodies were under bond to the
State. The neglect of the spiritual interests of the
Catholic portion of the convicts may have been owing,
as Mr. G. B. Barton observes, to “ official indifference
to religion.’ 7 The statesmen of that period certainly
did not recognise its healing, reforming, strengthening,
and guiding influence. The first governors took their
tone from them. The attempts at proselytising the
shepherdless Catholics reflect little credit on Governor
Phillip or his successor, Governor Hunter.
La PeroilSG. —Two French discovery ships, under
the command of La Perouse, put in at Botany Bay
for repairs shortly after Phillip’s arrival. While
there, the naturalist of the expedition, Pere Receveur,
died from wounds received at the Navigator’s Islands
and was buried on the north side of the bay, a
monument, afterwards destroyed by the aborigines,
being erected over his grave. Governor Phillip, in a
friendly spirit, had another erected, with the original
inscription engraved on a copper plate, which
he attached to an adjacent tree. The late Rev.
Father Norbert Woolf rey, of Waver ley, had a large
slab placed over the grave of Pere Receveur, with the
inscription engraven in it, while at the same time


he caused a substantial iron railing to be erected
around it.
Explorations. —Phillip before his return to Eng-
land, in 1792, had explored the coast north as far as
Broken Bay and the Hawkesbury, and the district
west as far as Richmond and Penrith, which he
describes as “ good country.”

Governor Hunter, 1795-1800.— From the de-
parture of Governor Phillip in December, 1792, till
the arrival of Hunter in September, 1795, the colony
was ruled by Major Grose, as Acting-Governor, for
two years, and for the remainder of the period
by Captain Paterson. During the three years of
their rule, these two officers secured for themselves
a monopoly of land, labour, and trade. The choicest
blocks of land around the settlement they partitioned
among themselves and their friends, the labours of
the convicts they controlled and directed for their own
benefit and that of their favourites. They bought up
merchandise at their own price as it arrived (owners
being prohibited from selling it to the best advantage),
and retailed the goods often at a profit of 1200 per cent.
Their Government was little better than a military
despotism, and their principal aim was to make money
by any means, good or bad. To Grose must be laid
the charge of establishing the wholesale traffic in rum
by the New South Wales Corps—a body of soldiers
enlisted in England in 1790 for service in the colony.
He had acted as recruiting agent in the organisation


of this corps, which contained within its ranks men
who had been a disgrace to every British regiment.
Hunter, on his arrival, tried hard to put down the
evil practices of the military, whose unscrupulous
conduct tended to lower, rather than raise, the moral
condition of the convicts, and in a short time the
condition of the settlement improved. He brought
out a number of farming men who received grants of
land on the Hawkesbury. About sixty convicts of
short sentence time also received grants of land, and
most of them became successful farmers.
The colony was now short of nothing but live stock.
The attempts to import cattle were not successful.
The discovery in 1796 on the “ Cowpastures ” of a
herd of 60 head—the offspring of those that had
escaped during Phillip’s time through the carelessness
of the keepers—was now a source of great joy to the
community.
Lieutenant SllOPtland discovered the Hunter
River in 1797, while in pursuit of escaped convicts.
A coal mine was opened and worked by convict labour,
and the town of Newcastle established.
Bass and Flinders. —George Bass, a surgeon,
and Matthew Flinders, a midshipman, came out
in the Reliance with Hunter. They were plucky,
fearless young men. Soon after their arrival, they
explored the coast from Sydney southwards as far
as Illawarra, in a boat eight feet long, called the
Tom Thumb. In 1797 Bass set out in a whaleboat
with a crew of six men, and discovered the Shoal-
haven Ptiver, Jervis and Twofold Bays, and passed
through the strait which bears his name as far as
Western Port (Victoria). In 1798 they sailed round
Tasmania (which was up to that time believed to be
part of Australia), Flinders making accurate charts
of the coast. Bass s fate is shrouded in mysterv *
the general opinion appears to be that after leaving


Australia he was immured in the Brazilian silver
mines, having been captured by the Spaniards while
dealing in contraband goods on the South American
coast. Flinders in 1800 carefully surveyed the coast
from Sydney to Hervey Bay, and then proceeding to
London, published his charts. They were highly
praised, and he was appointed to make a complete
survey of the Australian coast. This work he carried
out in the Investigator. Fie commenced his examina-
tion of the coast at Cape Leeuwin, and, following
the southern and eastern shores, reached Sydney,
where he remained some time, while his vessel was
undergoing some necessary repairs. Leaving Port
Jackson, he made a careful survey of the remainder
of the east coast, and then, passing through Torres
Strait, was forced to sail to the island of Timor for
further repairs to his vessel, which was now in a very
leaky condition. A temporary overhaul having been
effected, he sailed round the north and west coasts 3
and then back to Sydney. Flinders was thus the first
man to circumnavigate the Australian continent.
Having accomplished this, he set sail for England,
but was obliged to put into the Mauritius to have
his vessel repaired. Here he was imprisoned by He
Caen, the governor, and robbed of his charts, which
were sent to France, and there published as the work
of a French navigator named Baudin,who had met with
nothing but kindness from Flinders in Tasmania, and
from the people of Sydney. Flinders was liberated
after six years’ imprisonment, and, on his arrival in
London, prepared another set of charts and log book
for the press, but, worn out by the effects of his long
imprisonment, he died, on the day of their publi-
cation. He will be ever remembered and respected as
the most distinguished of the pioneers of Australian
maritime exploration. It was, besides, at Flinders’
suggestion that the continent received, in .1814, the
name of Australia, “ as being,” he said, “ more agree-


able to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of
the other great portions of the earth.”
Religious and Social Condition.— Upto this time
there was but one clergyman in the colony—the Rev.
Mr. Johnson—a Moravian Methodist. For a long time
he preached in the open air, having no building for his
congregation. The Government appeared to be utterly
indifferent to the interests of religion. Commodious
buildings were erected for dwellings, stores, &c., but
they would contribute nothing towards building a
house of prayer to God. How different it is in Catholic
countries, as the chaplain of a Spanish exploring vessel
which arrived in the port in 1793 observed. When a
settlement is made by his nation, he said, “the first
thought of colonists and of Government is to plant
the cross and erect sacred edifices of religion.” On the
arrival of Governor Hunter, Mr. Johnson plucked up
courage to denounce the government of Grose and
Paterson, and to complain of the official neglect of
religion. As a result of Mr. J ohnson’s bitter
complaints and repeated appeals, a church was at
length erected. It “was built of posts, wattle, cabbage-
trees and mud plaster, and was covered with a thatch
made of cabbage-tree leaves.” But a few months after-
wards, as Governor Hunter wrote, “ some wicked and
disaffected person or persons took an opportunity of
a windy and dark night, and set fire to the church.”
Governor King, 1800-1806,— Philip Gidley
King, who had been Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk
Island since 1788, succeeded Hunter in 1800. He
received instructions to stop the traffic in rum carried
on by the New South Wales Corps. Most of the officers
were mercenaries, who Joined the corps to make
money (which they did by pandering to the vices
of the convicts), and then return to England. Bum
and other goods were imported by those officers and
sold to the convicts and settlers at enormous profit.


The Governor acted promptly, and confiscated large
quantities of spirits, much of which was the product
of illicit distillation, for, in consequence of the great
demand for ardent spirits among the colonists, illicit
stills were numerous, and farmers soon found that
they could make about three times as much out o p
their wheat when distilled than they could by selling
the grain. He regulated the selling price of rum,
fixing it at 10s. per gallon. This action naturally
gave grave offence to the gang of military rum
dealers, two of whom, for instance, had in their
establishment no less than 4000 gallons of rum, which
they had been unwilling to part with at even £1 per
gallon.
The First Priests, 1800. —Fathers Dixon, Harold,
and O’Neil, the first Catholic priests, arrived in 1800.
They were transported for being suspected of
taking part in the Irish rebellion of 1798, but they
were innocent of the charges made against them.
Father O’Neil having been pardoned, returned to
Ireland in 1802. Father Harold was told off to
Norfolk Island, and Father Dixon was appointed by
the Colonial Government in 1803 to administer to the
religious wants of the Catholics of Sydney and its
outskirts. The three principal settlements of the
colony then were Sydney, Parramatta, and the
Hawkesbury, which he attended in rotation, under
restrictive regulations published by the authorities.
Governor King bore testimony to the “ regular and
exemplary conduct ” of Father Dixon, while his own
flock testified to his zeal, charity, and devotedness to
his sacred calling. Nevertheless this same Governor
made the rising of convicts at Castle Hill in
1804 a pretext for depriving Father Dixon of the
small allowance and rations he received from the
Government. Of fomenting or favouring the out-
break at Castle Hill he was as innocent as the
Governor himself; but having been sent out as a


rebel he was considered a “ turbulent priest,’ 5 whom
it was exjDedient to get rid of.
Wool-gTowing*. —After several years’ service as
a member of the blew South Wales Corps, Captain
Macarthur, perceiving the great facilities the colony
presented for sheep-farming, gave up his commission
and entered upon wool-growing. He received from
King a large grant of land at Camden. He tried
two or three breeds of sheep which produced
wool of inferior quality. After some failures and
delay he succeeded, during a visit to England, in
getting from King G-eorge 111., who was greatly
interested in farming affairs, some merino sheep,
which proved to be suitable for the climate of New
South Wales. The introduction of this little flock
may be regarded as the commencement of the great
staple industry of Australia.
Outbreak at Castle Hill.—A gang of convicts,
200 or 300 strong, working on the road at Castle Hill,
near Parramatta, rose in 1804 against their guards,
removed their irons, and marched with firearms to-
wards the Hawkesbury, expecting to be joined by
others in that district. They were overtaken near
Windsor by Major Johnston and 25 soldiers. The
ringleaders were executed. The rest, on promise of
future good behaviour, were allowed to return to
their work.
Persecution Of Priests. —Immediately after the
disturbance Father Dixon was obstructed in his
duties, his allowance withdrawn, and his rations
stopped, because the authorities pretended to believe
that the Irish political prisoners instigated “ the
Castle Hill mutiny.” Mr. Holt, in his autobiography,
asserts that among those who broke out were free
men, Englishmen and assigned servants. Father
Dixon left the colony in 1808, and Father Harold,
who had been at Norfolk Island, came to Sydney


and officiated in his place. But a regulation
was issued and enforced, compelling all convicts,
without distinction, to attend Divine service in the
Church of England, the penalty for non-observance
being from twenty-five to fifty lashes. This cruel and
intolerant rule separated Father Harold from his flock.
As he - could no longer discharge his sacred duties, he
left the colony in 1809, and for eight years, from
1809 to 1817, the Catholics were without a priest.
They often begged to be excused from attending the
Protestant service, but the curt reply of the clerical
magistrate was—“ Co to church, or be flogged.” It
was evident that the Covernment was bent on allow-
ing no other form of Divine worship but that of the
Church of England Presbyterians and other dis-
senters were coerced like the Catholics. Many addi-
tions were made to the ranks of the Church of
England clergy, and she was blossoming as the State
Church of New South Wales
Governor Bligh (1806-1808), —Captain Bligh,
the hero of the mutiny of the Bounty , and a naval
officer of distinction, succeeded Governor King in
1806 He came with instructions from the British
Government to stamp out the traffic in rum-selling
by the military officers. Pie spared no pains to effect
this and other reforms of a social nature, but failed
because a powerful and interested clique stood in his
way at every step. His order prohibiting the barter
of spirits for produce or goods of any kind was
disregarded Then commenced the struggle which
ended in his expulsion.
Captain John Macarthur was imprisoned for
allowing a convict to escape from a small vessel, of
which he was part owner. Bligh appointed a court
to try him, consisting of Judge-Advocate Atkins, and
six officers as a jury. Macarthur objected to being
tried by on the ground that he was preju-


diced, and a bitter enemy of his. The military officers
sided with Atkins, and the Governor threatened to
imprison them for their action. He requested Major
Johnston, the commandant-, to wait on him for the
purpose of discussing their conduct. The major
declined to do so. But, on the petition of the
principal residents of Sydney, he proceeded to
Government House, in full military array, and over-
turned the Government of the colony by arresting
Bligh.
Major Johnston had himself appointed Governor,
Macarthur was made Colonial Secretary, while all the
other important offices in the Government were
bestowed upon their friends. He carried on the
Government until superseded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Foveaux, his senior officer, who in turn gave way to
Colonel Paterson, then stationed in Tasmania.
After about a year’s “ imprisonment ” in Government
House, Bligh was liberated by Paterson, on
condition that he would leave the colony for England.
Instead of doing so, he endeavoured, in vain, to enlist
the sympathies of the Hawkesbury settlers in his
behalf. He then went over to Tasmania for the
same purpose, and was kindly received by the people;
but news from Sydney having arrived of his solemn
promise to leave the colony without raising any dis-
turbance, he did not succeed. He escaped being
re-arrested by sailing at last for England, where he was
appointed to an important post in the navy. The
home Government, as a matter of course, resented
the high-handed action of those who had taken part
against Bligh. Johnston was tried by court-martial
in London for his part in the rebellion against
Bligh, and was cashiered from the service. Macar-
thur having left the army some years before, was
not amenable to military justice; but he was sum-
moned to England and afterwards interdicted from
returning to the colony for eight years,


Catholic. —The Catholics were still without a
priest or guide to attend to their spiritual wants, or to
direct them in the way of salvation.
Governor Macquarie, 1810-1821, Lachlan
Macquarie had instructions from the home Govern-
ment to reinstate Bligh for twenty-four hours, but
he having left the colony such a course was impossible.
All the officers dismissed on the arrest of Bligh were
reinstated, and the New South Wales Corps was
ordered to proceed to England. Under the new
Governor the morals of the community began visibly
to improve. The temptations of the rum traffic
were removed. He encouraged industry and tem-
perance, and promoted education, He has been
described as a “ roads and building governor,” by
reason of his activity in converting tracks into roads
and frail structures into substantial edifices.
The forming of the road over the Blue Mountains
in 1815 was the great event of his administration.
Many attempts had been made to cross the Blue
Mountains, but they ended in failure until Gregory
Blaxland , Lieutenant Lawson , and William Charles
Wentworth discovered a route in 1813. Convicts were
at once set to work, and in two years completed the
road from Penrith to Bathurst. The rich pasture
lands of the west were then opened to flockowners on
the coast, who gladly availed themselves of them, and
soon settled on the plains of the Macquarie and
Lachlan.
Macquarie’s favour and encouragement to the
“ emancipist ” convicts, whose sentences had expired,
brought upon him the resentment of a number of
free settlers. Most of these convicts had been trans-
ported for offences which, at the present time, would
render them liable only to a few weeks’ imprisonment.
It was nothing but base envy on the part of the free
settlers to oppose their redemption. After serving


two terms of governorship Macquarie retired in 1821,
regretted by the bulk of the colonists.
Arrival of Father Jeremiah Flynn, —Father
Flynn, with the authority of Prefect Apostolic from
the Holy I ather, arrived in Sydney in 1817, to minister
to the spiritual wants of Catholics, who had been
without a priest since the departure of Father Dixon,
He had authority from Rome to administer the Sacra-
ment of Confirmation. Pious, zealous, and burning
for the salvation of souls, he travelled to all the centres
of population in the colony, baptising, hearing con-
fessions, giving instructions, and celebrating Mass.
His great zeal and edifying demeanour bred envy in
the minds of a narrow-minded clique of anti-Catholics,
who cried out for his expulsion. Macquarie unfor-
tunately listened to them, and although he had the
reputation of being firm, humane, and liberal, yet in
this instance he showed his weakness, prejudice, and
despotism. He declined to entertain the petition
of 400 respectable colonists of all denominations,
praying that Father Flynn might be allowed to
remain in the country for the good of the Catholic
portion of the community. To prefer such a request,
he said, was a piece of “ presumption.” So the good
priest had to leave the shores of Australia. Before
leaving, it is said that he left the Blessed Sacrament
in the house of Mr. William Davis, on Church Hill,
Sydney, near where St. Patrick’s now stands. Around
the Blessed Sacrament many of the Catholics of Sydney
prayed on Sundays and holidays, that their Saviour
would take pity on them, and send them priests. Dr.
Folding, in his report of the Mission for the Propaga-
tion of the Faith, attests that the Blessed Sacrament
was found uncorrupt, and that the species was con-
sumed on the arrival of Fathers Therry and Conolly.
Father Flynn lost no time, on returning to Ireland,
in bringing his grievance before the Rev. Dr. England


(soon after appointed Bishop of Charleston), then on
a visit to Cork. The latter brought the matter before
Lord Donoghmore, M.P. for Cork, who had it dis-
cussed in the House of Commons. The arbitrary
conduct of the Governor was severely censured, and
it was generally acknowledged that great injustice
had been done in depriving 10,000 poor Catholics
of their esteemed spiritual adviser and pastor.
The Rev, Fathers Therry and Conolly.--
These two good priests arrived in the ship James on
2nd May, 1820. They brought with them powers
from their ecclesiastical superiors and full civil
authority from the Home Government. Each had a
salary of £lOO a year. They presented themselves
without delay to General Macquarie, who acknow-
ledged their credentials, but determined to fetter
them as much as possible. On the 6th June, 1820,
he issued instructions to them “ not to try to make
converts from the members of the Church of England
or Protestants in general, to confine their labours to
those of their own flock, and warned them on their
peril.” They were not to interfere with the Catholic
children in the orphan schools, all of whom were being
brought up in the faith and tenets of the Church of
England. He further ordered that Mass should be
celebrated only on Sundays and holidays of the
Church of England. Though tolerating them, he
appeared to be sorry he could not compel everybody
in the colony to attend the services of the English
Church under fines and pains, tie could not drive them
out of the colony as he had driven Father Flynn, but
he did what he could to hamper them. He had,
however, in Father Therry and Father Conolly,
stern, devoted missionaries to deal with who were not
to be daunted by decrees or threats, who were, like
St. Paul, chosen vessels to bear the name of the Lord
far and wide in spite of perils and dangers.


First Catholic Church. —The want of a church in
which to ofler the Holy Sacrifice and to give instruc-
tions in the Word of God was at once felt by Fathers
Therry and Conolly. They resolved to supply it without
delay. Two months after their arrival a meeting was
held in the Court House, Sydney, presided over by the
Hev. Philip Conolly, at which it was resolved to build
the first Catholic Church in Australia. The Govern-
ment gave the site, and the foundation stone of /St.
Mary's was laid on 29th October, 1821, by Governor
Macquarie, who, in reply to Father Therry’s address to
him, said : “It was a great gratification to me to
witness and assist at the ceremony now performed.”
The Government Gazette reported the attendance at
the ceremony as a “ vast assemblage of respectable
persons. 7 ’ The plans and designs for the sacred edifice
were on a large scale. People thought it absurd for
Father Therry to have what they believed visionary
notions about the vastness of the future temple. “It
will never be completed,” they said ; “ there will never
be a congregation large enough to fill it.” How mis-
taken were those views and how true the confidence of
the reverend founder time and results have proved. He
saw his designs completed and the cathedral filled to
overflowing before his death. Father Conolly went
to Tasmania in 1820, and until the arrival in 1826 of
Father Power, Father Therry had no assistance.
During these six years his missionary labours were
incessant. His flock was scattered over a large area,
which embraced Parramatta, Wollongong, Hawkes-
bury, Penrith, and other places.
Governor Brisbane (1821-1825). —Sir Thomas
Brisbane’s vice-royalty, which lasted only four
years was remarkable for reforms and explorations.
He gave freedom to the Press in 1824, trial by jury,
and an instalment of self government by the appoint-
ment of an Executive Council of seven to advise him.
The explorations of Surveyor-General Oxley in the


north led to the discovery of the Brisbane River,
where a convict establishment was formed, and the
city of Brisbane founded. Hume and Hovell, in
1824, led an exploring party from Lake George to
Western Port, Victoria, discovering the Murrum-
bidgee and the Murray on the way. Allan Cun-
ningham, botanist, discovered a short and practicable
route into the Liverpool Plains through Pandora’s
Pass. Brisbane built an observatory at Parra-
matta and devoted himself to the study of
astronomy, finding relief in the study of this and
other pursuits from the wrangling of the two rival
parties in the State, the “ Exclusives ” and the
“ Emancipists.” The former claimed to be alone
entitled to grants of land and other favours from the
Government; the latter (who were once convicts, but
who had become free on the termination of then-
sentences) demanded equal rights with their rivals.
It was impossible to please both parties, and the
Governor was glad to be recalled, in 1825, before
the end of his term of office.
Governor Darling’ (1825-1831).— This Gover-
nor, through his blundering, was unpopular throughout
his administration. He drove the “ Emancipists ”
appointed by Macquarie out of the public service.
Pie was at war with the Press. He had a bill passed
through the Legislative Council wherein a second
conviction for libel was punishable with banishment
from Hew South Wales. It was aimed at William
Jharles Wentworth, one of the founders of The
Australian , a newspaper which persistently attacked
with great severity the acts of the Governor. He
strove, also, to drive Father Therry from the colony,
and might have succeeded but for Wentworth, then
the leading barrister and public man in Sydney, and
the determined foe of bigotry and oppression.
Father Therry was deprived of his salary for no


fault of his or breach of regulations, but simply
through a printer’s error. In a letter to the Sydney
Gazette , recounting the many grievances of his hock,
the zealous archpriest, referring to the clergy of the
Church of England, said that “ they were entitled to
and possessed his unqualified respect.” The word
unqualified was printed qualified. The printer ad-
mitted the mistake was his, yet Father Therry was
punished for “ disrespect to the Establishment.”
This was the poor plea used for depriving him of the
small allowance from the State, but his real offence
consisted in exposing the exclusiveness of the Govern-
ment in respect of schools, burial grounds, &c. The
Government offered Father Therry £3OO to leave the
colony, but such a good shepherd would not desert
his flock, and he was encouraged to remain by
Wentworth, who advised him that the Governor
could not send him out of the colony. Prohibited by
the Government, Father Therry was obstructed by the
officials in the discharge of his duty in the hospitals
and gaols. He was not, however, to be deterred by
bans or bayonets from visiting the sick and com-
forting the dying. Neither soldier nor sentinel,
pampered menial nor hireling, could resist his zeal and
fortitude in the service of God. It is recorded that
on going to one of the hospitals to visit a dying man
he was stopped by the guard. Addressing him, he
said : “ The salvation of this man depends upon my
ministration. Which is your duty V } Impressed by
his earnestness, the sentinel lowered his arms and
allowed him to pass. Many other instances are on
record of Father Therry’s zeal in the cause of God
overcoming all obstacles.
The principal explorations in Darling’s time were
the discovery of the river Darling by Captain Charles
Sturt in 1828, and of the Darling Downs in 1827
by Allan Cunningham. In 1829 Captain Sturt
and George Macleay explored the Murrumbidgee,


and Murray as far as Lake Alexandrina. They
suffered extreme hardship on their return, which
might have proved fatal but for the kindness of the
natives. Military outposts were established at
Western Port (Victoria), King George’s Sound and
Swan River (W.A.), to avert threatened occupation
by the French in any part of Australia.
The political reforms effected were an increase in
the members of the Legislative Council from seven
to fifteen, and the “ Bushranging Act,” which had the
effect of speedily suppressing crime and restoring
order. The Governor was recalled in 1831, much to
the satisfaction of his opponents.
Governor Sir Richard Bourke (1831-1837)
succeeded Darling. Liked from the start, his popu-
larity never waned during his reign, which bore the
character of justice, enlightenment, and liberality. He
allowed the emancipists to sit as jurymen in 1833.
He regulated the assignment of convicts in 1834. He
esttled the land question by stopping free grants of
land, and ordering that all land should be sold by
public auction. He established religious equality by
the Church Act of 1836.
Early in 1832 the Catholics held a public meeting
in Sydney, at which a memorial was adopted on the
motion of Mr. (afterwards Sir) Roger Therry, praying
the Governor to grant aid for the education and
religious instruction of the Catholic youth on lines
similar to the liberal provision made for the youth of
the Established Church, and to restore the Rev. John
Joseph Therry to the position of Catholic Chaplain.
Sir Richard gave the deputation which presented the
memorial a very gracious reception, said that he was
most anxious to secure for Catholics a suitable pro-
vision for their education and religious instruction,
and that he would lay before the Secretary of State
the matter of the re-instatement of Rev. J. J. Therry.
v


The Church and School Corporation, which was
worked in the interests of the Church of England,
having been dissolved, the Church Act became law on
the 29th July, 1836. This Act put an end to all the
schemes and designs for establishing a State Church
in the colony. It provided aid for three denomina-
tions—the English Church, the Catholic, and Scottish
Church—in proportion to the numbers of each
denomination. The year before it was passed, the
English Church received from the Treasury, for
chaplains and schools, £19,071, the Catholic Church
£BOO, and the Church of Scotland £6OO. It will be
seen from this statement where the lion’s share for
religion and education went.
Acquisition to the Catholic Body.— ln 1832
the Catholics were filled with hope and rejoicing over
the arrival of Rev. John McEncroe as Catholic
Chaplain, J ohn Hubert Plunkett as Solicitor-
Ceneral, and the Very Rev. Dr. Ullathorne as Yicar-
General. These gentlemen enriched the colony by
their wisdom and many Christian virtues, and were
truly pillars of the Church.
First Catholic Bishop. —Dr. John Bede Folding,
the first Catholic Bishop of Australia, arrived in
1835 in the Oriental. He had with him Revs. J.
Corcoran, A. Cotham, J. B. Sumner, J. Spencer,
H. Gregory, all of the Order of St. Benedict ;
and Messrs. Harding and John Kenny, ecclesiastical
students. The Rev. Mr. Fisher died during the
voyage, and was buried at sea. Favourable winds
and fine weather attended the voyage. The ship
called in at Hobart, where the Bishop was cordially
received. He left the Rev. A. Cotham to act as assist-
ant to Father Conolly, who had been there for many
years, while John Kenny (afterwards Dean), was placed
in charge of the Catholic school just established. The


Oriental arrived in Sydney 13th September, 1835;
and on the 20th of the same month the Bishop was
installed in St. Mary’s Cathedral, in the presence of a
crowded congregation, many of whom were non-
Catholics. The Catholic population, according to the
census taken one year after the Bishop’s arrival, was
21,898 in New South Wales, and 7000 in Tasmania.
The Catholics of the colony were spread over 800
miles of coast —from Cape Howe in the south to
Brisbane in the north, and from Sydney to Bathurst
in the west. Tasmania, too, was included in his
jurisdiction. From this it will be seen what a vast
diocese the Bishop had to attend to. In all his
labours for the good of his flock he was unwearied.
He took his turn like a simple priest in the con-
fessional, in preaching, in visiting the hospitals and
prisons, consoling the afflicted sinner, exhorting to
good works, inspiring and encouraging all. The
great moral improvement that was evident among the
prisoners, the decrease of crime and of executions—
all “ beneficial results,” as the Governor observed—
were the fruits of his labours, and the exercises
introduced for the instruction of the prisoners before
their assignment.
On St. Patrick’s Hay, 1836, the Bishop blessed
and laid the foundation-stone of St. Patrick’s Church,
Parramatta. There was a large assemblage, aitd all
the Catholic clergy of the colony were present. In
the address of Hr. Holding on the occasion he
entreated his people “to show forth the power and
purity of their faith in the propriety of their conduct;
to shun all excess and drunkenness, as most offensive
to Almighty God, derogatory *to the memory of a
saint distinguished for his abstemiousness, and de-
grading to the descendants of those whose lives
obtained for Ireland the title of the £ Island of
Saints.’ ”


Exploration, —In Governor Bourke’s time Major
(afterwards Sir) Thomas Mitchell discovered the
rivers Gwydir, Hamoi, and Peel, in the west ; ex-
plored the rich land of Victoria, which he named
Australia Felix, and surveyed the Darling for a con-
siderable distance below Bourke.
♦On the sth December, 1837, “ Good old Governor
Bourke,” as he was affectionately called by the
people, left the colony. At a public meeting, con-
vened in Sydney, it was resolved, on the motion of
W. C. Wentworth, to present him an address,
and erect to his memory a statue, which now adorns
the Inner Domain, Sydney. The Catholic Bishop and
clergy also presented an address to him, expressive of
their admiration and gratitude for the advantages
derived by the colony from the wise and impartial
administration of that great and just Irish Governor.
Governor Gipps (1838-1846) arrived in Feb-
ruary, 1838. He had a troubled reign. The colonists
were poor and discontented. In most cases their
sufferings were brought on by themselves through
over-speculation in land, want of thrift, and living
"beyond their means. Unreasonably, they attributed
most of their miseries to the Governor.
In 1843, the first election to the Legislature took
place. The Council, under enlarged provisions, was
increased to thirty-six members, twenty-four elected
under a limited franchise, and twelve nominees of the
Crown.
Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt, a German botanist, in 1844,
started on his first journey and explored the coastal
country between Moreton Bay and Port Essington.
On the route he discovered some splendid country,
well grassed and heavily timbered, and watered by
numerous rivers, among which are the Fitzroy, Daw-
son, Mackenzie, Burdekin, Mitchell, Gilbert, Roper,
and Alligator. In 1846 he made a second journey to


Northern Queensland, which was not successful. In
1847 he left Moreton Bay on his third expedition to
cross the continent from east to west. He reached
the Cogoon River, a tributary of the Condaroine, five
months after starting, and judging by the terms of
a communication dated from there, and received from
him in Sydney in April, 1848, he was hopeful of
success. But that was the last heard of him, except
some baseless stories about his wandering with blacks
in the interior. Expeditions sent in search of him
were fruitless in their main object, although they
indirectly made known the character of much of the
interior of the continent.
St. Mary’s Seminary. —ln. January, 1838, the
first High School for Catholics was opened in St.
Mary’s Seminary. It was conducted by the Rev.
Charles Lovat, of Stonyhurst College in England,
who came well equipped for the discharge of his
important duties. A scholar of no ordinary abilities,
a sound theologian, well versed besides in physical
science and the higher mathematics, he brought with
him a set of physical and chemical apparatus (the
first, perhaps, introduced into the colony for teach-
ing) to illustrate his lectures on Physical. Science and
Natural Philosophy. He was assisted by John
Kenny (afterwards Dean), and a few others.
In the same ship which brought out the Governor
were two priests—the Rev. John Brady and the Rev.
James Goold, the latter of whom afterwards became
Archbishop of Melbourne and the former Bishop
of Perth. They were the first fruits of Dr. Ulla-
thorne’s journey to Europe for more missionaries
for Australia. In a few months after (15th
July, 1838) there followed the Rev. Erancis
Murphy (afterwards Bishop of Adelaide), the Revs.
M. O’Reilly, John Fitzpatrick, E. Mahony, John
Lynch, John Rigney, Michael Brennan, Thomas
Slattery, and Murphy. With the third party of


priests secured by him, Dr. Ullathorne returned to
the colony on 31st December, 1838. The priests were
Devs. P. B. Geoghegan, Richard Marum, and Thomas
Butler; ecclesiastical students, Messrs J. Dumphy,
P. Maginnis, and J. Grant. He also on that occasion
introduced the first Sisters of Charity to New
South Wales. These were—Sisters Cahill, O’Brian,
Callen, De Lacy, and Williams. These “ministering
angels ” devoted themselves at once to the task of
reforming the female convicts in the factory at Parra-
matta, advising, instructing, and consoling them daily.
Their refining influence was soon felt in the better
order and management of the establishment. In
addition they opened a Magdalen Asylum, which, at
a later period, was transferred to the control of the
Good Samaritan Community, founded in Sydney in
1857. They visited the gaols also, and brought hope
and consolation to many condemned prisoners.
Dr. Ullathorne, while in England, published a
pamphlet on “ The Catholic Mission in Australasia.”
It excited much comment and criticism at the time; and
the spiritual wants of the mission so earnestly put be-
fore the public doubtless induced many of the excellent
young priests who then came out to volunteer for the
mission. He pointed out the defects of the system of
transportation. Of these the principal in his opinion
was the unwise exclusion of the influences of religion
as the chief factor in the reformation of the convicts.
He also wrote, in 1840, a very able pamphlet in
reply to Judge Burton’s attacks on the Catholics
of the colony, in his book, “The State of Religion and
Education in New South Wales.” One quotation
will show the Doctor’s vigorous vindication of his
co-religionists : “We Catholics have been wronged,
grievously wronged, and by one whose appointed duty
it is to protect us in our rights. That name and
character of a British judge, which were given you by


the hand of power for our use, have been turned
against us to our abuse. You have
* Struck us with your tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.’
You have for years industriously picked up the stories
told against us, gleaned gross falsehoods from time-
serving newspapers, which your length of public life
should have taught you how to value; you have
carried them in your bosom; you’ have embalmed
them in your dislikes ; you have gone to England,
and you have scattered the devices of our enemies
over the high places of influence and power, endorsed
them with your name, and with the seal of your
judicial character have stamped the falsehoods true.”
Progress of the Church.— After the passing of
the Church Act, during Sir Richard Bourke’s term of
office, the Catholic Church in Australia advanced
rapidly. The Right Rev. Dr. Folding, aided by his
active vicar-general and faithful clergy, eagerly took
advantage of the provisions of the Act, and established
churches and schools in the most populous parts of the
colony. In rapid succession the good bishop laid the
foundation stones of churches at McDonald River,
Lower Hawkesbury, Wollombi, Campbell’s Hill, West
Maitland, and Wollongong ; of a school at Campbell-
town, a church at Liverpool, and St. Patrick s,
Sydney (1840), the site of which was given by Mr.
Davis.
In 1840 Bishop Folding, accompanied by Dr.
Ullathorne and the Rev. Father Gregory, left on a
visit to Europe in the interests of the Church.
Addresses were presented, and presentations made
to all of them prior to their departure, the tribute of
the meeting to the bishop alone being a Treasury
Bill for £4OO.
On 10th April, 1842, His Holiness was pleased to
appoint Dr. Folding Archbishop of Sydney, a Count


of the Holy Homan Empire, and Bishop-Assistant to
the Papal Throne. His Grace returned to Sydney
early in 1843, bringing with him two Benedictine
priests, four Passionist Fathers, two Secular priests,
and three members of the Irish Christian Brothers for
his schools, all of whom were received with the greatest
joy on landing. Dr. Broughton, the Bishop of the
Church of England, protested publicly against the
title of His Grace the Archbishop of Sydney conferred
on Dr. Folding. He wanted to raise the ghost of a
State Church, and invoked “ hatred, bigotry, and
jealousy,” all to no purpose. His protest was treated
as a dead letter. The Church Act of Governor
Bourke giving perfect religious freedom to all denomi
nations was in force. The people had accepted it,
and they esteemed Dr. Folding too highly to take
sides against him.
CHAPTER IY.
NEW SOUTH WALES UNDER RESPONSIBLE
GOVERNMENT.
Governor Fitzroy (1846-1855) was successor
to Sir George Gipps, in 1846, and though he troubled
himself very little about the affairs of the colony, his
term of office was remarkable for important events.
These were:—The abolition of transportation, 1846 ;
the explorations of Leichhardt and Kennedy in 1848 ;
the separation of Port Phillip in 1851; and the
discovery of gold in 1851.
Discovery Of Gold. —The existence of gold in the
colony had been known many years before Edward
Hargraves discovered the precious metal at Summer
Hill Creek, in the Bathurst district, on 12 th February,


1851. Convicts found some when making the Bathurst
road, in 1814, bub kept the knowledge to themselves.
Count Strzelecki and the Rev. W. B. Clarke, eminent
geologists, indicated several localities where gold would
probably be found. But, for all practical purposes,
Hargraves deserves the honour of being the first
discoverer of gold in payable quantities. The dis-
covery of gold turned the heads of the entire com-
munity. Everybody who could go rushed off to the
west in search of fortune, which few found, while a
great many met with nothing but disappointment.
Hew diggings were soon discovered on the Turon
River, at Ophir, Araluen, and other places. From
these fields large quantities of gold were sent to Sydney,
whence it was shipped to London, sometimes two tons
weight at a time. The discovery of rich goldfields
also in Victoria in 1851 made Australia as famous as
California was in 1849, and attracted adventurers
from all nations to its shores.
Responsible Government, or Home Rule—that
is, government by ministers answerable to the people
for the conduct of the internal affairs of the colony—
was first provided for in a Bill introduced into the
Legislative Council in 1851. It provided for the
abolition of the almost absolute power previously
possessed by the Governor. The present Constitution
Act, which was an Imperial measure and under which
the change at length took place, was prepared by
William Charles Wentworth and Edward Heas-
Thomson, who were afterwards sent to England to
watch over and expedite the passing of the Bill in
the Home Parliament. It became law, and in 1856
the first Parliament under its provisions was elected.
In 1858, manhood suffrage, or the privilege of voting
for the election of members of the Assembly, was
given to every male person over twenty-one years of
age who had not been less than six months a resident
of the colony.


Governor Denison (1855-1861) succeeded
Fitzroy. He built Fort Denison on an islet (formerly
called Pinchgut), in the middle of Port Jackson, and
erected batteries on points along the shore, to protect
Sydney from any possible invasion of Russian
cruisers which might result from the Crimean War.
These petty defences have long since been replaced
by the strong and powerful fortifications at the
Heads.
The “ Dunbar.”— ln August, 1857, this vessel,
containing many well-known colonists returning from a
trip to Europe, was wrecked at The Gap, off
Watson’s Bay. The disaster cast a gloom over
Sydney, and led to the erection of the large lights
house at South Head overlooking the ocean.
St. John’s College. —Archbishop Polding issued
a pastoral on 21st June, 1857, exhorting the Catholic
body to avail themselves of the liberal offer made by
the Government for the erection of a Catholic
college within the University. The offer comprised
a grant of the land whereon St. John’s now stands, as
well as a £ for £ contribution up to £ 20,000 towards
the cost of erecting a college. A few days after the
issue of the circular an aggregate meeting of Catholics
was held in St. Mary’s Cathedral, to take steps for
giving effect to the Government’s generous proposal.
The Archbishop presided. Mr. Justice Therry moved
the first resolution, to the effect that the Catholics
should avail themselves of the munificent provisions
made by the Government for the promotion of a high
order of education in the colony.
The result of that meeting was that in a few days
£14,000 was handed in or promised for the erection
of the proposed college; and as soon as Mr. Warded
had prepared plans the building of St. John’s was
commeneed. It cost £40,000. The Rev. Dr. Forrest
was the first rector. He was selected by the Yen.


Archdeacon McEncroe, when on a visit to Ireland in
1859.
Dr. Gregory, who had for sixteen years discharged
the arduous duties of Vicar-General, withdrew from
the Australian mission, and returned to England in
1861.
Guild. —ln June, 1845, the Catholic Guild of St.
Mary and St. Joseph, an admirable benefit society,
was established.
State Aid. —state aid was withdrawn from the
Churches of all denominations in August, 1862, by
the Legislature.
Governor Young 1 (1861-1867).— In 1861 Sir
John Young (afterwards Lord Lisgar) became Gover-
nor. The Robertson Land Act, by which a man might
select an area of land and buy it from the Crown at £1
per acre, paying one-fourth of the purchase money on
taking possession and the balance at any future time,
caused some trouble between the Governor and the
Upper House. The Ministry, finding the Upper House
opposed to their Land Bill, “ swamped ” it by the
appointment of twenty-one new members favourable
to the measure, which soon afterwards became law,
and resulted in the settlement of great numbers on
the public lands.
St. Mary’s Cathedral.— A great calamity befel
Catholics on 29th June, 1865 (feast of SS. Peter and
Paul) in the destruction by fire of St. Mary’s Cathedral.
All Sydney was sorry for it, and promptly sympathised
with the Venerable Archbishop and his flock in the
great loss they had sustained. The Catholics of St.
Mary’s lost no time in vain regrets, but having resolved
to re-build their cathedral, they at once held a
private meeting, presided over by the Ven. Archdeacon
McEncroe, at which £6OOO were subscribed. The
Mayor of Sydney convened a meeting of citizens to


give practical help towards re-building St. Mary’s, at
which liberal subscriptions were given by many non-
Catholics. A great public meeting was held on the
6th July in the Prince of Wales Theatre to raise
funds for the same purpose. His Grace the Archbishop
presided, and on the stage were the Governor, Sir
John Young, judges, and other distinguished officials.
The principal speakers were His Grace, the Governor,
the Hon. T. A. Murray, President of the Legislative
Council, and the Hon. E. Deas-Thomson, M.L.C. A
wooden building was erected to answer for a time as
a pro-cathedral, which also was unfortunately burnt
down in 1869. Plans for the new cathedral were
soon prepared, however, the foundations were laid
broad and deep and solid, and, at a cost of £13,000,
were brought to the level of the ground. On the Bth
December, 1868, the corner-stone was solemnly blessed
by the Archbishop.
Governor Belmore (1868-1872).— 1t was dur-
ing the time of Lord Belmore, in 18 68, that Prince Alfred,
the second son of the Queen, paid a visit to Sydney.
There was great rejoicing on his arrival, and a sum of
£25,000 of public money was spent on festivities in his
honour. While attending a picnic at Clontarf on 12th
March, 1868, the Prince’s life was attempted by a
madman named O’Farrell, who was afterwards
hanged for the crime. Bad men, for their own selfish
ends, turned the lamentable occurrence to account by
inventing all kinds of stories about “ Fenian plots.”
The writer of this little handbook was at that time a
member of the “ Volunteer” force in Sydney. The
corps to which he belonged mounted guard on St.
Patrick’s night, 1868, at Hyde Park Barracks. Other
companies of volunteers were told off to protect Go-
vernment House and Darlinghurst Gaol from “ the
terrible Fenians.” Sydney and suburbs were almost
mad with excitement and fear. It was a veritable
reign of terror for Catholics. A portion of the Press


and the political Titus Oateses of the day professed to
believe in the rumoured plots. But, as it was after-
wards proved by the evidence given before a Select
Committee of the Legislative Assembly, there were
not the slightest grounds for such belief. “ The evil
that men do lives after them. 57 The bad passions
fomented on that occasion for purely party purposes
did immense harm to numbers of honest, industrious
Irish colonists for nearly a generation.
Marlst Brothers. —The four pioneer brothers of
this teaching order arrived in 1872, in the Star of
Peace , and opened their first school in St. Patrick’s
parish, Sydney. It was at the request of Archdeacon
McEncroe, made some years previously, that the
Archbishop introduced them. Soon the brothers
opened schools in other parts of the city and in the
suburbs. They also extended the field of their labours to
New Zealand, New Caledonia, Samoa, and other
islands of the Pacific. ,Their college of St. Joseph at
Hunter’s Hill has now a very large roll of students,
and the excellent character of the instruction imparted
there is proved by the high place taken by its pupils
at the University Public Examinations.
Society of Jesus. —This distinguished society,
whose religious zeal and devotion to Christian educa-
tion are of world-wide reputation, established a branch
of its order in New South Wales in 1877. The Very
Rev. Joseph Dalton and Rev. James Kennedy were
the pioneer Jesuits. A college for day students was
soon opened at St. Kilda House, in Woolloomooloo,
but soon a more commodious building—St. Aloysius’
College, in Surry Hills—took the place of St. Kilda.
The brilliant Father William Kelly, one of the pro-
fessors on its staff, made the college popular from the
start. The Jesuits’ grand college—St. Ignatius—at
Riverview, hear Sydney, has an Australasian reputa-
tion for the excellence of its teaching, and of its


general equipment. The fathers have charge of
the parish of North Sydney and of the Jesuit No-
vitiate at Greenwich, the latter overlooking the Lane
Cove and Parramatta Rivers.
Death of the Pioneer Catholic Chaplains.—*
After his return from Tasmania the Yen. Archpriest
Therry had charge of the suburb of Balmain, where
he died in 1864, mourned by all classes.
A few years afterwards, in 1868, his friend and
colleague, the Yen. Archdeacon McEncroe, passed to
his reward. The universal esteem in which he was
held was shown by the immense concourse that fol-
lowed his remains to the Devonshire-street Cemetery,
Sydney, where the body was laid side by side with
Father Therry’s. Of these two founders of the
Church in this country the Right Hon. W. B. Dailey,
soon after their decease, at a large meeting of Catholics
in Sydney, spoke of “ the privilege of having possessed
two such pure, simple, heroic confessors as the two
great priests whose memory we wish to perpetuate.
They are endeared to us by lives as blameless as they
were beautiful, and identified with everything of
interest in our ecclesiastical history.”
Dr. Bolding set out on 22nd November, 1865, on
his fourth journey to Europe in the interests of the
Church in Australia. He visited Rome, where he
was received with the highest consideration by the
Holy Father, while at the institutions of charity and
education in England and Ireland he was the recipient
of many marks of profound respect.
During his absence the Public Schools Act of 1866
was passed, which placed the control of denomina-
tional schools under the Council of Education. The
Council examined, appointed, and paid the teachers,
and directed the secular instruction, setting apart one
hour every day for the teaching of religion. This


state of affairs lasted up to the end of 1882, when all
State assistance was withdrawn from the denomina-
tional schools by the Public Instruction Act of 1880,
which is still in force.
In 1869 the Venerable Archbishop left Sydney to
attend the Vatican Council. Though his strong
spirit and ardent zeal were unabated, the heat of the
tropics was too much for his physical frame, and he
was compelled to halt at Suez. After a rest there he
returned to Sydney and resumed his active duties.
Mourned by all Sydney, he died at the Sacred Heart
Presbytery in 1877, at the age of 83, and his remains
were honoured with a public funeral.
Many years before the Archbishop’s death he
recommended to the Holy See the appointment of
the Ven. Archpriest Sheehy as his coadjutor and
successor, but the latter declined the proffered dignity.
The Most Rev. Hr. Vaughan was appointed coadjutor
in 1873. His career, though short, was brilliant
and successful. His commanding appearance and
graceful eloquence, whether in the pulpit or on the
platform, won for him golden opinions from all.
Dr. Vaughan’s reputation as a scholar and divine
had preceded him. His “ Life of St. Thomas of
Aquin ” showed what he was capable of in litera-
ture, and his work as prior of the Benedictine
Cathedral Monastery of St. Michael, near Hereford,
for ten years, produced excellent results. He was
received in Sydney in December, 1873, with every
demonstration of joy and gladness. In reply to the
address from the clergy, he said he would apply himself
especially to two works—finishing St. Mary’s Cathedral
and safeguarding Catholic education. By His Grace’s
devotion to the former £60,000 was added to the
Cathedral fund, and his “ Pastorals and Speeches on
Education ” abounded with exhortations and argu-
ments that excited much controversy.
The most widely-read of the Archbishop’s sermons


were “ The Advent Conferences;” the most successful
nation was the discourse on the i( Centenary of
O’Connelland his most celebrated lecture, “ Hidden
Springs, ” was delivered at the opening of the Guild
Hall in 1876.
During the ten years of the Archbishop’s adminis-
tration nearly £220,000 were expended in the erection
of churches and schools.
It was on April 19th, 1883, that the great
Archbishop left Sydney on a visit to Koine and
England. He was accompanied by the Kev. Dr.
Gillett, his chaplain. Four months after, the sad
news of his sudden death in England was cabled to
Sydney. All classes lamented the loss the colony had
sustained in the death of the gifted prelate.
First Cardinal.— Dr. Moran, Bishop of Ossory
in Ireland, became Archbishop of Sydney in 1884,
and was welcomed with great enthusiasm. Summoned
to Kome in July, 1885, His Holiness, Leo XIII.,
made him a Cardinal, the first prelate of the
Australian Church upon whom that dignity was
conferred. In November, 1885, the Cardinal
convened the Plenary Synod of the Bishops of
Australasia, for the discussion of matters of grave
import to the welfare of the Church throughout the
colonies. This was held in St. Mary’s Cathedral.
There were fifteen bishops and fifty-two theologians
present, and their deliberations extended over a
fortnight.
During the sittings of the Synod the foundation-
stone of St. Patrick’s Ecclesiastical College at Manly
was laid. It cost £65,000, and has now a large roll
of young Australians studying for the priesthood.
Other works of the Cardinal are referred to in a
speech made by the Right Hon. W. B. Dailey at a
meeting held in St. Mary’s Cathedral in May, 1887,
towards raising funds for completing the chancel and


a portion of the central tower of the Cathedral. They
are the introduction of the Vincentian Fathers of St.
Augustine at Balmain, the fathers of the Sacred
Heart at Randwick and Botany, the Irish Christian
Brothers at Balmain East, the Brothers of St.
Patrick at Redfern, the Sisters of our Lady of the
Sacred Heart at Botany, the Carmelite Nuns at
Cook’s River, the Nursing Sisters at Petersham, and
the Little Sisters of the Poor at Leichhardt. The
expenditure for religious purposes during the first
three years after the Cardinal’s arrival reached nearly
£300,000. Scarcely a week passes that His Eminence
does not preside at the founding or oj)ening of some
church, school, or other work of Christian charity,
and, in all probability, he will be known to future
generations of Australians as “the building prelate..”
It may be said with truth that His Eminence
Cardinal Moran has been making history ever since
he came to the country. In defending Catholic doctrine
and faith against the onslaughts of enemies, in dealing
with intricate questions in English and Irish history,
and in expounding with statesman-like grasp the
objects and advantages of Australian Federation,
he has no equal in Australia. The Cardinal’s great
literary work in this country is the “ History of the
Catholic Church in Australasia,” published in two
volumes in 1895. The episcopal Silver Jubilee of
His Eminence was celebrated with solemnity and
splendour in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, on 2nd
May, 1897, in the presence of most of the Catholic
Prelates of Australasia. Many addresses and gifts
were presented on the occasion to the Cardinal by
the clergy and laity, and by the friendly and other
societies of the Archdiocese.
The Right Rev. Hr. Higgins has been Auxiliary-
Bishop to the Cardinal since 1888. His Lordship is
highly esteemed throughout the Archdiocese for his
piety and learning, and he has, in addition, proved


himself a fervent and eloquent preacher as well as an
active and capable administrator.
Religious Orders.— This brief recital of the
work and progress of the Church in the Archdiocese
of Sydney would be incomplete if mention were not
made of the labours of the different religious orders
who have thus far worked with conspicuous success
in the pursuit of their holy calling. The education’
of the juvenile Catholic male population is carried on
by (i.) the Marist Brothers (founded from St. Genis
Laval, near Lyons, in France, in 1872), whose chief
educational centres are at Hunter’s Hill and St.
Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney ; (ii.) the Christian
Brothers (founded from Dublin in 1887), with
headquarters at St. Joseph’s, Lewisham, one of the
suburbs of Sydney ; and (iii.) the well-known Jesuit
Fathers previously referred to.
Numerous convent schools, well equipped and
efficiently conducted, provide for the educational
wants of the girls. The sisterhoods of the Arch-
diocese include the following ;—(i.) the Sisters of
Charity (founded from Dublin in 1838, and com-
prising nine communities) with headquarters at St.
Vincent’s, Victoria-street, Sydney ; (ii.) the Bene-
dictine Nuns of Subiaco , near Parramatta (long the
only high school for Catholic young ladies throughout
the colonies, having been founded from the congre-
gation of the Anglo-Benedictines in 1848, in which
year they accompanied Dr. Folding to Sydney) ; (iii.)
the Sisters of the Good Samaritan of the Order of St.
Benedict (founded in Sydney in 1857), with eighteen
communities ; (iv.) the Sisters of Mercy (founded from
Liverpool, England, in 1865) with seven communities,
whose chief house is the Monte San Angelo Convent,
North Sydney, well-known as a high-class educational
establishment, as well as for the Mater Misericordice
Home conducted under its auspices at Church
Hill, Sydney (as a training school and safe refuge


for female domestic servants when out of employ-
ment), and for the Foundling Hospital at Waitara,
near Hornsby (founded 1898); (v.) the Sisters of
St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart (founded from
South Australia in 1880), consisting of 25 com-
munities, with the mother house and Novitiate at
North Sydney ; (vi.) the Sisters of the Sacred Heart
of Jesus (founded from Paris in 1882) with a fine
convent school for higher education at Rose Bay,
Sydney; (vii.) the Sisters of Mercy (founded from
Callan, Ireland, in 1888) —the latest foundation of
the Sisters of Mercy in the Archdiocese—with their
parent house at Parramatta and branches at St.
Peters, Surry Hills, St. Kieran's, Golden Grove, and
St. Prigid’s Orphanage, Ryde ; (viii.) the Loretto
Nuns (a branch of the institute which was founded
at Ballarat in 1875 from the Irish parent house
at Rathfarnham, Dublin), who came to Sydney in
1892, and at present conduct a high-class boarding
school at Hornsby and a high school for day pupils
at Rand wick ; and (ix.), the Sisters of St. Brigid
(founded from Mountrath, Ireland, in 1887), who con-
duct superior and primary schools at Cooma.
In addition to the above, branch foundations of the
Dominican Nuns of Maitland conduct educational
establishments at Strathfield and Moss Vale. Besides
these distinctively teaching orders, there are (i.) the
Nursing Sisters of the Little Company of Mary (founded
from the Central House in Rome in 1885), whose
mission is to nurse the sick in their homes, have their
headquarters at Lewisham, where they have under
their care a women and children’s hospital, an asylum
for the blind, and a night refuge in the city, as also
a home at Ryde for sufferers from mental disorders ;
(ii.) the Poor Clares (Waverley); (iii.) Carmelite Nuns
(Marrickville) ; (iv.) the Little Sisters of the Poor , who
relieve at their home at Rand wick about 70 old and
infirm persons of all creeds, and (v.) the Sisters of the


Sacred Heart (founded from Issoudun, France, in
1885) who conduct at Kensington, near Sydney, an
institution where Sisters are trained for missionary
service in the South Sea Islands.
Suffragan Dioceses.
The suffragan dioceses of New South Wales are
Maitland, Goulburn, Bathurst, Armidale, Wilcannia,
and Grafton.
Maitland, situated on the Hunter, was erected
into an episcopal see in 1847, the Right Rev. Dr.
Davis, 0.5.8 , being the first bishop. He arrived in
Sydney in 1848, but through severe illness never took
possession of his diocese, and died in 1854. Since
1840 the mission at Maitland had been unde£ the
charge of Dean (afterwards Monseignor) Lynch.
The Right Rev. James Murray was appointed
Bishop of Maitland in 1866. He, with the Bishop of
Bathurst, nine priests, and sixteen nuns, arrived in
Sydney by the Empress on 22nd October of that
year. The bishops and their religious companions
were heartily welcomed by the Catholics of Sydney.
Archdeacon McEncroe accompanied Dr. Murray
to Maitland, and the Very Rev. Dr. Sheehy, Y.G.,
accompanied the Bishop of Bathurst to his diocese.
The founding of the Sacred Heart College, one of the
leading high-class educational institutions of the colony,
the introduction of the Redemptorist Fathers, securing
different communities of nuns for the higher and
primary schools, the founding of the Deaf and Dumb
Institution at Waratah, all testify to the great works
of the bishop for the greater glory of God. Dr. Patrick
Vincent Dwyer, the first Australian-born bishop, was
appointed in 1897, coadjutor, with right of succession,
to the aged prelate Dr. Murray. He was consecrated
in June of that year, and since his appointment he
has been a most energetic administrator. One of the
most important and far-seeing innovations intro-


duced since by his Lordship is the introduction of
the Marist Brothers to take charge of the boys’
schools at Newcastle and Maitland.
The religious orders belonging to the Diocese of
Maitland comprise the Dominican Nuns , the Sisters of
Mercy , and the Sisters of St. Joseph. The Dominican
Nuns (founded from Kingstown, Ireland, in 1867)
consist of six communities, and have their priory
at West Maitland, with branches at Newcastle,
Waratah, Tam worth, Moss Yale, and Strathfield.
At Waratah they have charge of a deaf and
dumb institution, where the poor and afflicted are
well cared for and instructed in the way of salvation.
The character of the West Maitland Dominican
Convent as a high-class educational establishment is
recognised throughout the colony.
The Sisters of Mercy (founded from Ennis, County
Clare, Ireland, in 1875) consist of ten communities,
with Singleton as headquarters, and branches at the
chief centres of population from Hamilton to Scone.
In addition, they have established flourishing com
vents at Gunnedah, Narrabri, Inverell, and Broken
Hill, as well as at Reefton and Dunedin, in New
Zealand. In addition to numerous well-conducted
primary and high schools, the Sisters of Mercy have
under their care a well-appointed orphanage at
Singleton. The great zeal and self-denial of the
Sisters of Mercy are highly appreciated by the
Catholic community of the Maitland diocese.
The Sisters of St. Joseph (founded from Bathurst
in 1883), began with a community of four, and now
their number is nearly 60, distributed throughout 10
communities, whose parent house is at Lochinvar. As
the Venerable Dr. Murray says: “God only knows
the immense good they are effecting in the remote
districts by their lives of self-sacrifice and by the
excellent education—both secular and religious—
which they are giving to the children.”


Diocese Of Goulburn. —Goulburn is situated on
the Wollondilly, on the Southern Tableland, and
besides being one of the leading sanatorium s in the
colony, is the chief town on the Great Southern
Railway. Fathers Fitzpatrick and Brennan were the
first resident priests in this now populous district.
First Bishop. —The Right Rev. Dr. Lanigan had
been many years pastor at Berrima before being
appointed Bishop of Goulburn. He was consecrated
in the Cathedral at Goulburn in 1867, the ceremony
being performed by the Bishops of Brisbane, Bathurst,
and Maitland, in the absence of Archbishop Bolding
in Europe. As bishop, Dr. Lanigan has pursued the
same active life that distinguished him as missionary
priest. Churches, convents, schools, presbyteries,
grew up as if by magic under his watchful care. The
inculcation of practices of piety to the Sacred Heart
and of temperance among his flock, both old and
young, were ever in his mind. His clergy faithfully
co-operated with him, the best known of whom were
Very Rev. Dr. McAlroy and Rev. Dr. Bermingham.
The silver jubilee of the bishop’s consecration was
celebrated in 1891, when priests and people testified
their affection and loyalty to him in many ways. The
Right Rev. Dr. Gallagher is now (1898) coadjutor to
the Venerable Prelate. The educational work of the
diocese is in the able hands of (i.) the Sisters oj Mercy
(two separate foundations), whose headquarters are
at Goulburn and Yass respectively, with branches in
the chief population centres; (ii.) the Presentation
Nuns at Wagga; (hi.) the Sisters of St Joseph (with
seven branches), founded from Bathurst in 1882;
while (iv.) the Brothers of St. Patrick (founded from
Mountrath, Ireland, in 1884) conduct the boys’
schools at Goulburn, Wagga, and Albury; and (v.)
the Irish Christian Brothers have lately (1898) taken
charge of the Diocesan College at Goulburn.


Diocese of Bathurst. —Bathurst, for a long time
known as the “ Western Metropolis ” and the u City
of the Plains,” is situated on the Macquarie. The first
place of worship was a bark hut, which soon gave way
to the church of SS. Michael and John, blessed by
Archbishop Folding in 1857, and which cost <£17,000.
The Very Rev. Dean Grant was at that time pastor
of the district.
First Bishop. —The Right Rev. Dr. Matthew
Quinn was first bishop, and came to the colony, as has
been stated, with the Bishop of Maitland in 1866. The
young priests who accompanied him were Rev. J. P.
Byrne (now his successor), Rev. P. Ryan, Rev. T. J.
Walsh, Rev. W. Nugent, and Rev. D. E. McGrath.
There were also some Sisters of Mercy, novices, and
postulants. During the nineteen years of Dr. Quinn’s
episcopate, the large sum of £200,000 was con-
tributed towards the various works of religion and
education in his diocese. St. Stanislaus College
(where a high-class education is provided by the Vin-
centian Fathers) and numerous convents, schools,
churches, and orphanages are works which will hand
down his name to posterity. He died, as he lived, in
the odour of sanctity, and was deeply niourned by all
classes throughout his extensive diocese.
The Right Rev. Dr. Byrne was consecrated Bishop
of Bathurst in 1885. Like his predecessor, he has been
unwearied and self-sacrificing in carrying on works of
education and religion. Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St.
Brigid , and Sisters of St. Joseph conduct superior and
primary schools throughout the diocese, while the pri-
mary schools for boys at Bathurst and Orange are under
the able management of the Brothers of St. Patrick.
Diocese of Armidale, —Armidale is situated on
the New England Tableland, and is the chief centre
of population on the Great Northern Line, beyond
Maitland. Father (afterwards Dean) McCarthy was


one of the first priests appointed to the district, and
the Very Rev. Dean Lynch had charge up to 1870.
First Bishop.— The Right Rev. Dr. O’Mahony,
the first bishop, arrived in 1871. He devoted himself
at once to the erection of a cathedral, providing
schools, and building a residence for himself. He,
resigned the see in 1878, owing to some base but
altogether groundless calumnies spread about him, and
was appointed coadjutor to the Archbishop of Toronto,
where he died in 1895.
The Right Rev. Dr. Torreggiani was appointed
successor in 1879. He spent his first year in a
visitation through his extensive diocese to ascertain
the spiritual wants of every district in it. In 1887 he
gave an account of the various works carried out by
him, which include numerous churches, convents,
schools, and presbyteries. The religious orders
engaged in the education of the youth of the diocese
comprise the TJrsuline and Dominican Nuns, the
Sisters of Mercy (two foundations), and the Sisters of
St. Joseph (founded from Adelaide and Sydney).
Diocese Of Wilcannia.— Wilcannia is situated
on the Darling, and embraces a wide region devoted
to sheep-grazing and opal-mining.
First Bishop. —The Right Rev. John Dunne, for
many years in charge of the Albury parish in the
Goulburn diocese, was appointed its bishop in 1887.
Religion has made great progress in the diocese.
There are now over 120 nuns teaching in the schools,
and 16 priests, all co-operating heartily with their
zealous bishop. There are 25 schools throughout the
diocese, under the charge of the Sisters of Mercy and
the Presentation Nuns , with an enrolment of 2500
pupils, over 500 of whom are Protestants.
Diocese of Grafton.— Grafton is situated on the
Clarence, but the Bishop resides at Lismore, on the
Richmond.


First Bishop. —The Right Rev. Dr. Doyle was
appointed Bishop in 1887, being consecrated in
St. Mary’s, Sydney, by His Eminence Cardinal
Moran. He had been connected with the Diocese
of Armidale, which included his own diocese
until it was made a separate see. As an earnest of
the piety and attachment of his flock to their religion,
it need but be mentioned that on the laying of the
foundation-stone of the Cathedral of St. Carthage at
Lismore by the Cardinal-Archbishop in 1892, the
magnificent sum of £4050 was contributed. Through-
out this rich diocese the educational wants of the
rising generation are well provided for by the Presen-
tation Nuns and the Sisters of Mercy. The former
have convents at Lismore, Ballina, Kempsey and
other places, while the latter conduct primary and
high schools at Grafton, Casino and Maclean.
Recent Civil Events.
Exhibition. —In the International Exhibition held
in Sydney in 1879, for the products of all nations,
the resources of the colony were shown to great
advantage, and did not suffer much by comparison
with the best exhibits from other countries.
Soudan Contingent. —The Hon. William Bede
Dailey, P.C., Acting-Premier, in 1885 despatched,
with the consent of the Home Government, a regiment
of soldiers, nearly 1000 strong, to aid the British troops
in the Soudan. The news of the death of the brave
General Gordon by the treachery of the Soundanese
kindled the fiercest rage against them in Australia,
and our volunteers promptly offered their services in
the spirit of brotherhood. The war was over before
the Australians reached Africa, but the despatch of
the contingent made it plain to the world that, if ever
the mother country should be involved in serious
difficulties through foreign aggression, the armed
volunteers of her colonies would be found fighting


shoulder to shoulder with the Imperial forces in
defence of British interests.
Federation—the object of which is the creation
of a separate legislature (in addition to the local
parliaments which at present meet in Sydney,
Melbourne, and the other capitals) for the purpose of
dealing with matters, such as defence, &c., which
directly concern Australia as a whole—has been talked
of for many years, but beyond the formation in 1886
of a Federal Council—a body possessing neither
revenue nor executive authority—nothing practical
was done for the union of the colonies till 1890. In
that year a conference of delegates from each of the
seven colonies was held in Melbourne, and resolutions
expressive of the desirableness of union were passed.
In 1891 the National Convention to decide upon a
basis for the federation of the Australasian colonies
was held in Sydney under the presidency of the
late Sir Henry Parkes. The Convention agreed to a
draft constitution by which the future commonwealth
was to be governed.
Owing to fiscal strife federation was lost sight of
for some years. The interest in it, however, was
revived by a conference of the Premiers held in
Hobart in 1895, and by the People’s Convention held
in Bathurst in 1896, when Cardinal Moran delivered
a statesmanlike address in favour of federation, which
evoked praise from all parties.
In 1897 the question took practical shape. The
colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, South
Australia, West Australia, and Tasmania elected each
ten representatives to draw up a federal constitution
for submission to the whole of the electors of these
colonies.
These delegates met in Adelaide in April, 1897, and
afterwards in Sydney and Melbourne. A constitution
was adopted for submission to the electors in the


colonies named for either approval or disapproval.
As yet the question has not been definitely settled.
Upon Mr. E. Barton, Q.C., of Sydney, the most
popular and most distinguished of the delegates, and
the Hon. R. E. O’Connor, Q.C., a gifted Hew South
Wales Catholic statesman, devolved the greater part
of the work of drafting the constitution as submitted
to the Convention.
CHAPTER Y.
TASMANIA.
Abel Jan Tasman discovered Tasmania in 1642,
and gave it the name of Van Diemen’s in
honour of his patron, Yan Diemen, at that time
Governor of the Dutch islands in the East Indian
Archipelago. Its present euphonious name was given
to the island in 1856, in honour of its discoverer.
It was visited by many English and French navi-
gators from 1772 to 1777. George Bass, in 1798,
explored the strait bearing his name, and proved
that Tasmania was an island, and not part of the
mainland, as had previously been believed. The same
year, in company with Matthew Flinders, he sailed
round the island, the latter making accurate charts
of the coasts. The settlement of Tasmania goes
nearly as far back as that of Hew South Wales.
The worst convicts were sent thither from Sydney in
the time of Governor King and for many years after-
wards. Lieutenant Bowen formed the first convict
settlement at Risdon, on the Derwent, in 1803, and
a detachment of the Hew South Wales Corps was
sent from Sydney with the expedition in the Lady
Nelson. This subsidiary settlement was formed for


the purpose of forestalling occupation by the French
exploring expedition under Commodore Baudin, who
was believed to be casting anxious eyes upon the
island. In 1804 Colonel David Collins (who had
come out to Sydney in the first fleet as Judge-Advocate),
formed a settlement at Hobart—then called Hobart
Town, after Lord Hobart, at that time Secretary of
State for the Colonies. Collins’s expedition was des-
patched from England for Port Phillip. Collins,
however, considered Port Phillip unsuitable for
settlement, and transferred the convicts to Hobart.
Colonel Paterson, in 1804, established a settlement on
the north coast at Port Dalrymple. It consisted of a
few convicts and a number of soldiers. After a few
years, Launceston, on the Tamar, was chosen as a more
suitable site for the new settlement.
For many years Tasmania was the theatre of strife,
bloodshed, and unexampled cruelty ; and immorality
stalked abroad in the land. The blacks were trouble-
some for 30 years dating from the first settlement.
The first encounter with them in 1804 resulted in 50
being killed. Some of the worst of the convicts be-
came bushrangers, and often attacked the settlers with
savage ferocity. Distress, too, added to the hardships
of the inhabitants, whose food supply often ran short.
In 1807 famine prices prevailed for the barest necessi-
ties of life. Flour was sold at the rate of £2OO per
ton.
Governor Collins died in 1810, and for the next
three years Lieutenant Lord, Captain Murray and
Lieutenant-Colonel Cells were successively the acting
commandants of the colony. During the administra-
tion of Captain Murray, Governor Macquarie went
down from Sydney and laid out in part the present city
of Hobart. Cells was succeeded by Governor
Davey, who ruled from 1813 to 1817. At this
period the prospects of the colony began to brighten.
Farmers produced not only sufficient wheat for home


consumption, but had a surplus which found a ready
market at payable prices in New South Wales.
Whaling in the Derwent and off the coast also greatly
stimulated commerce. In 1816 Macquarie Harbour
and Port Davey were discovered by Captain Kelly.
The coarse, but good-natured, Governor Davey re-
linquished his office in 1817, and engaged in farming
in the colony for a few years, but finally returned to
England.
Governor Sorrell succeeded Davey in 1817.
Bushranging was the principal difficulty he had to
contend with during his administration. Large re-
wards were offered for the capture of these marauders,
but few were taken.
Merino sheep were introduced from Macarthur’s
hocks in New South Wales in 1820, and soon after-
wards several manufacturing industries sprang into
existence. The principal Christian denominations
erected places of Divine worship, and courts of justice
were established during Sorrell’s regime.
In 1824 Governor Arthur assumed the govern-
ment of the colony. His administration was
characterised by ability, energy, and order in all
departments. The aborigines, however, gave con-
siderable trouble. Arthur at length determined to
put an end to the difficulty, and for that purpose
organised a corps of settlers and soldiers, 2000 strong,
to form a line across the island, and, advancing from
north to south, drive the blacks like kangaroos to the
extreme south of Tasman Peninsula. This aboriginal
hunt lasted two months, and cost the Government
£30,000, but the sole result of the whole sorry
business was the capture of one blackfellow and a
boy. The trouble with the blacks was at length got
rid of by getting them to agree to be transported to
Flinders Island in Bass Strait, where, after a few
years, they nearly all died out. Arthur overcame the


bushranging difficulty by offering free passages to
England to all who gave themselves up. So many
embraced the offer that in a short time Brady, the
leader of the gang, was left almost alone, and when
wandering in a secluded valley was surprised and
captured by John Batman, who afterwards took part
in the early settlement of Victoria.
In 1825, on the petition of its colonists to the
Home Government, Tasmania became independent
of Hew South Wales. Four years later a nominee
legislative body was appointed to aid the Governor in
framing laws.
In 1827 the Van Diemen’s Land Company received
a grant of 350,000 acres, and, much of this being
afterwards sold by auction, permanent settlement on
the land was greatly increased.
In 1829 Mr. J. P. Fawkner, the founder of Mel-
bourne, started the Launceston Advertiser. On the
expiration of Governor Arthur’s term of office in 1836,
the colonists testified their appreciation of his rule by
a gift of <£lsoo.
In 1837 Sir John Franklin (afterwards lost
while exploring in the Arctic regions) assumed office.
The colony progressed under the new Governor, who,
36 years before, had served as a midshipman under
Flinders during the survey of the Australian coast in
the Investigator. Lady Franklin, his wife, warmly
seconded his efforts in all movements for the
good of the people. She spent much of her
private fortune in acts of benevolence. A few holding
high positions, whose soaring ambition the Governor
felt bound to check, lost no opportunity of thwarting
him. One of them was dismissed for insubordination,
and appealed to Lord Stanley, who, in ignorance of
the facts of the case, sided with him. The Governor
was superseded by Sir E. Wilmot, and left the colony
amidst the regrets of the vast bulk of the people.


Sir Eardley Wilmot was Governor for three years
(1843 to 1846). It is said he died of a broken heart
in 1847 from the calumnies heaped upon him during his
brief administration—his chief measures having given
great offence to the majority of the inhabitants.
In 1847 Sir William Thomas Denison assumed
the governorship of the colony. The great event
during his rule vas the cessation of transporta-
tion (1853).
From 1840 to 1853 the island was flooded with
convicts, transportation to New South Wales having
ceased in the former year, and there being no other
penal settlement available. Convict labour came into
competition with that of the free settlers, hence an
agitation against transportation was started which,
after many years’ delay, was crowned with success,
in 1853.
The discovery of gold in Australia in 1851 had a
bad effect on Tasmania. People left the colony in
great numbers to seek their fortunes on the goldfields,
and for nearly 20 years the progress of Tasmania
suffered from this cause.
In 1855 Sir Henry Young* came to the colony as
Governor-in-Chief. During his term of office Re-
sponsible Government was introduced, muni-
cipal government established, and communication by
railway and telegraph initiated. The succeeding
Governors were Colonel Brown, Sir Charles
Ducane, Sir F. A. Weld, General Sir J. H.
Lefroy, Sir G C. Strahan, Sir C. R. Hamilton,
and Lord Gormanston.
First Priest. —The Rev. Philip Conolly, who
arrived in Hobart from Sydney in 1821, was the first
Catholic chaplain. Father Flynn, when coming
out to New South Wales in 1817, was on shore in
Hobart for a few days, and was received in a friendly
manner by Governor Sorrell. Father Flynn admin-


istered the sacraments to the Catholic convicts. Dean
Kenny, who had been six months a teacher under
Father Conolly, says that he was a “ man of no small
ability and attainments, very witty, and full of dry
humour.’ 7
The Rev. Samuel Coote landed in 1824. With
Father Coote came out Mr. Roderick O’Connor, his
family, and some free settlers to enter upon farming
in the colony. Mr. O’Connor was then a Protestant,
but became a Catholic later in life, and made a gift of
£lO,OOO towards the erection of St. Mary’s Cathedral,
Hobart.
Dr. Ullathorne, on his voyage to Sydney in 1833,
remained a few weeks in Tasmania. He found
“ religious matters in a very unsatisfactory condition.”
The Right Rev. Dr. Folding, on his appointment as
Bishop of Hew Holland and its islands, stopped in
Tasmania for a few weeks before coming on to Sydney.
During his stay he collected £lOOO for the erection of
a church at Richmond (14 miles from Hobart). He
left Father Cotham to assist Father Conolly, and
Mr. John Kenny (afterwards Dean) in charge of a
Catholic school then established.
Shortly after the arrival of Dr. Folding in Sydney,
Father Therry was sent as Vicar-General to Tasmania,
where he controlled Church affairs until the arrival
of the first bishop. In Tasmania, as in New South
Wales, Father Therry was the courageous champion
of his faith. Zeal and earnestness for religion and
education he showed without ceasing, and he fought
the Government inch by inch to secure the right of
Catholic orphans to be brought up in their own faith.
First Catholic Bishop of Tasmania.—The
Right Rev. Dr. Willson, first Catholic Bishop of the
colony, arrived at Hobart in 1844. He had come
from Nottingham, England, where he was very
popular with non-Catholics and revered by his own


flock. His right to style himself “ Catholic Bishop
of Hobart Town ” was questioned by Hr. Nixon, the
Protestant Bishop, in an offensive letter. Hr. Willson
replied “that he thought the vice and crime abroad
in the colony called for different labour than quarrelling
about titles.” The Launceston Examiner , referring to
the conduct of the Protestant Bishop, said : —“ Every
Protestant here feels scorn and indignation at seeing
religion reduced to a sort of cockfight.”
Next to the moral welfare of the convicts, reform
and improvement in the discipline under which they
suffered engaged the attention of the Bishop. He
found them locked up at night in wooden huts, each
containing 20 or 50 men, herded together like China-
men. In many of the gangs of convicts he found men
carrying chains when at work weighing from 20 to 36
lbs. The treatment of the convicts and the “ terrible
punishments ” they underwent, horrified him. He
brought this state of things under the notice of Sir
Wm. Henison, the Governor of Tasmania, in a letter,
in which he says :—“ Gloom, sullen despondency,
despair of leaving the island seemed to be the general
condition of the men’s minds.” It was through his
representations, made to the Imperial Government,
and supported by Governor Henison, that convicts
were removed from Norfolk Island, where they were
treated worse even than in Tasmania, and that the
former island was abandoned as a penal settlement.
Hr. Willson’s heart also went out to all who were
suffering from mental disease. He had gained in
England and on the continent of Europe much
experience in the treatment of the insane, and he gave
the benefit of it to the Governments of Tasmania,
Victoria, and New South Wales for the cure of
mental maladies.
Bishop Willson was singularly free from national
prejudice, as was shown in 1859, when he petitioned
the Holy See to appoint the Very Bev. Hean Butler,


an Irish priest, of Launceston, as his coadjutor.
44 The Church in Hobart,” he said, 44 was almost
entirely Irish, 4 and it would he an act of folly to
appoint other than Irish bishops for priests and
people who were Irish.’ ”
The Most Rev. Daniel Murphy became coadjutor
and afterwards successor to Dr. Willson, who returned
stricken with paralysis to his old flock at Nottingham,
where he died in 1866.
Dr. Murphy had been Bishop of Hyderabad, in
India. He arrived in Hobart in 1866, and an
enthusiastic welcome was extended to him. At
the close of the same year several nuns of the
Presentation Order arrived, under the charge of the
Rev. Mother P. X. Murphy, the Bishop’s sister. They
opened schools at Richmond, until their convent
adjoining St. Mary’s Cathedral was built, and in 1873
they sent a branch to Launceston. The Sisters of
St. Joseph in 1887 opened schools in other districts
of the island, and in 1893 the Sisters of Mercy took
possession of a new convent atLatrobe. In 1893 the
Convent and Magdalene Home, under the care of the
Sisters of the Good Shepherd, was solemnly opened
by His Eminence Cardinal Moran.
The Golden Jubilee of the Right Rev. Dr. Murphy’s
priesthood was celebrated in June, 1888, amidst great
rejoicing. His Holiness Pope Leo the XIII., to
mark his appreciation, made him Archbishop of
Hobart, and His Eminence Cardinal Moran in May,
1889, conferred the Pallium upon His Grace. In
June, 1896, the Golden Jubilee of His Grace’s
episcopate was celebrated, in the presence of the
Cardinal, most of the hierarchy of Australia and the
Catholic Governor of Tasmania, Lord Gormanston,
who took a warm, generous and prominent part in
connection with the proceedings. The Right Rev.
Dr. Delany, a ripe scholar and zealous administrator,
has for many years acted as Coadjutor to His Grace.


CHAPTER VI
VICTORIA.
Victoria (previously known as the Port Phillip
district of Hew South Wales) became a separate
colony in 1851. In 1770 Captain Cook, from his ship
the Endeavour , saw a small portion of its coast and
named one of its headlands Point Hicks (now Cape
Everard), situated between Cape Plowe and the mouth
of the Snowy River. Mr. Clarke, the supercargo of
the Sydney Cove , which had been wrecked on the
Furneaux Islands in 1797, while endeavouring along
with some of his crew to reach Sydney, passed through
a small portion of the south-eastern coastal district of
Victoria, and are believed to be the first Europeans
who ever trod Victorian soil.
In 1798 Hr. George Bass set out from Sydney in
an open whaleboat, cruised along portion of the
south coast of Victoria, and proved that Tasmania
was not connected with the mainland, as had pre-
viously been the opinion. In 1800 Lieutenant James
Grant, who sailed from England in the Lady Nelson
for the purpose of making a survey of the southern
shores of Hew Holland, was the first to pass through
Bass Strait from the west. After a short stay in
Port Jackson, Grant surveyed the coast of Victoria
from Western Port to Wilson’s Promontory. Matthew
Flinders, in the Investigator , sailed into Port Phillip
in 1801 and explored its shores in an open boat, while
Lieutenant Murray, who, had succeeded Lieutenant
Grant in the command of the Lady Nelson , in a cruise
through Bass Strait in 1802 also explored Port Phillip.


In 1803, in the Cumberland , Charles Grimes (then
Surveyor-General of New South Wales) explored the
coast of Port Phillip and ascended the Yarra for
several miles. One of the party, in his report of this
expedition, says that u the most eligible place for a
settlement that 1 have seen is on the Freshwater
River ” ( i.e ., the Yarra). Grimes and his party on
one occasion breakfasted on the site of the present
Spencer-street Railway Station, and have, therefore,
the honour of being the first white men to set foot
on the site of the city of Melbourne. The Cumber-
land, in which Grimes sailed, was under the command
of Lieut. Robbins, a naval officer, who had despatches
warning off the French expedition under Commodore
Baudin, who was believed to be contemplating the
annexation of the south coast of New Holland on
behalf of the French Government.
Early Settlement. —Lieut.-Colonel David Collins,
formerly judge advocate in Sydney, was sent out from
England in 1803 to found a convict settlement in
Port Phillip. The expedition was fitted out in haste
in England on account of the anticipated designs of
Baudin, the French commodore. It consisted of a
storeship, the Ocean , and the Calcutta , -with 400 persons
aboard, 300 of whom were convicts. A landing was
made near the present town of Sorrento, and the
country about there explored. This was found un-
suitable for settlement. The land was sandy and
barren, the water brackish, and there was no timber.
The result was that Collins, who had heard glowing
accounts of the beauty and fertility of the northern
shores of Yan Dieman’s Land, removed the settle-
ment to the banks of the Derwent, stating at the
same time in a despatch to Lord Hobart that “ when
all the disadvantages attending this bay (Port Phillip)
are publicly known, it cannot be supposed that com-
mercial people will be very desirous of visiting Port
Phillip.” During Collins’s sojourn, William Buckley,


one of the convicts, deserted, and, having made
friends with the natives, lived with them for 32 years.
For 20 years after Collins’s short visit Port Phillip
district was neglected, until in 1824 Hamilton Hume
and William Hovell, in search of new pastures,
travelled overland from Goulburn, in Hew South
Wales, via Yass Plains and the Murray, Ovens, and
Goulburn Rivers, and having explored the country as
far as the present site of Geelong, reported favourably
of its soil and pastoral capabilities.
Soon after the return of Hume and Hovell to
Sydney rumours were again afloat that a French
expedition was about to make a settlement on the
south coast of the continent, and to prevent this the
authorities in Sydney determined to despatch an
expedition thither. Western Port was selected as
its destination. A small party of prisoners, with
soldiers to guard them, was landed there in 1826,
under the command of Captain Wright, with
whom went Hovell as guide. It was found, however,
after a year's occupation, that the surrounding dis-
trict was unsuitable for permanent occupation, and,
at the instance of Governor Darling, the settlement
was abandoned.
Permanent Settlement.— ln 1834 two brothers,
Edward and Francis Henty, who were carrying on an
extensive whaling industry in Tasmania, crossed over
to Victoria and established a branch station at Port-
land Bay. This undertaking proved successful, and
to it they soon added sheep and cattle farming. The
Hentys were thus the first real settlers of the colony,
and they were soon followed by other stockowners
from Tasmania. In the following year (1835) an
association was formed in Tasmania to colonise Port
Phillip. It consisted of fifteen persons, and John
Batman was sent over with a party to report upon
the grazing capabilities of the surrounding district.


After exploring much of the new country he had an
interview near the present site of Northcote with
several native chiefs, with whom he contracted for
the purchase of 600,000 acres of land on the shores
of Port Phillip and on the hanks of the Yarra in
return for a number of knives, tomahawks, blankets,
looking-glasses, and other articles. Governor Bourke
afterwards disallowed the bargain, but granted <£7ooo
to the Batman Association as compensation in regard
to the transaction.
Fawkner. —JohnPascoe Fawkner, with five others,
settled on the shores of Port Phillip in 1835. The
country was not unknown to him, having been there
as a boy in 1803 with his father in the convict
expedition of Governor Collins. Messrs. Henty,
Batman, and Fawkner were settlers from Tasmania,
who were attracted to Victoria by the glowing reports
of the country given by Hume and Hovell.
Australia Felix. —In 1836 Major (afterwards
Sir) Thomas Mitchell explored the country from the
Murray to the ocean, and by reason of its fertility
bestowed upon it the name of Australia Felix. From
his description of its beauty, fertility, and suitable-
ness for pastoral pursuits, many squatters from New
South Wales and Tasmania rented large areas for
grazing. At that time, too, immigrants began to
arrive in great numbers from the United Kingdom.
Melbourne, the future capital of the colony, was
named after Lord Melbourne, the British Premier of
the period, by Sir Richard Bourke, when on a visit
to the southern colony in 1837.
Latrobe. —In 1839 Charles J. Latrobe became
superintendent of Port Phillip district, which, three
years later became entitled to send six out of the
twenty-four elected members of the newly-formed
Legislative Council at Sydney. For some years after,


owing to over-speculation in land, property of all
kinds suffered in value, and general stagnation of
business prevailed. From about the year 1840 the
people of Port Phillip became dissatisfied with the
mode in which the settlement was governed. The
agitation for local self-government was kept up until in
1851 it became an independent colony, under
the name of Victoria. Latrobe was then sworn
in as Lieutenant-Governor, and the first parliament,
consisting of ten nominated and twenty elected
members, was opened at Melbourne, November, 1851.
Discovery of Gold. —James Esmond, a Californian
digger, received £IOOO as a reward from the Victorian
Government for the discovery of the first payable
goldfield in Victoria in 1851, a few months after the
great gold discoveries in New South Wales. Ballarat,
Bendigo and Mount Alexander soon became famous
goldfields, and attracted fortune-seekers in a short time
from the other colonies, and from Europe, America
and Asia, to the number of 100,000. Many of these
were successful and made fortunes, but the great
majority found considerable difficulty in making even
a bare living. The gold-diggers had many grievances.
They had to pay an excessively high license fee,
amounting to thirty shillings a month, for the mere
right to search for gold, and this was imposed upon
all alike. They were also denied the franchise, and
prevented from cultivating even the smallest portion
of land around their encampments for the support of
themselves and their families. Receiving no redress
of their grievances, the Ballarat diggers revolted in
1854. They formed an entrenchment called the
Eureka Stockade , which, after a short struggle, was
carried by the soldiers and police, who had been
brought in large numbers from Melbourne to quell the
insurrection. Both sides suffered heavy losses, and 120
miners were taken prisoners, and although thirteen
were put on their trial the Crown failed to get a con-


viction in any of the cases. The late Sir Peter
Lalor, for many years Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly in Victoria, was one of the ringleaders of
the revolt. Many reforms and concessions to the
miners resulted from the outbreak. For ten years,
from 1851 to 1861, the value of the gold yield from
Victorian mines averaged £10,000,000 a year.
Burke and Wills. —“A Melbourne merchant”
(who was no other than Mr. Ambrose Kyte, a patriotic
and modest Irishman) offered, in 1860, the sum of
£IOOO towards the fitting out of an expedition to
cross the continent from Victoria to the Gulf of
Carpentaria. Private contributions to the extent
of £3OOO, and a Parliamentary grant of £6OOO,
besides 26 camels, valued at £3OOO, were freely given
to help on the praiseworthy undertaking. The
leadership was given to Robert O’Hara Burke (an
Irishman from the County of Galway), with whom
was associated W. J. Wills as surveyor and astro-
nomical observer. There were thirteen other persons
in the party, which started from Melbourne in
August, 1860, under the happiest and most
favourable auspices. Arrived at Cooper’s Creek
on 11th November, Burke formed a depot, with
instructions to those in charge to remain there for
three months. Burke then, with three companions—
Wills, King, and Gray—plunged into the unknown
country, and made a rapid journey to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, where they arrived on 4th February,
1861. Spent and worn, they retraced their steps to
Cooper’s Creek, to find the depot, alas, abandoned,
Brahe, who had been left in charge, having left
some hours before their arrival. Brahe, before leaving,
took the precaution of burying some provisions at the
foot of a tree, on which he cut the word “ Dig.”
Food, of which they were so much in need, was now
available, and they decided to rest and recruit them-
selves—a fatal mistake, for had they but pushed on


only for a few hours they would have reached Brahe
and his party, who travelled only a few miles the first
day. Weak and disappointed, they turned towards
South Australia in the hope of reaching some outlying
squatter’s station. Disaster befel them on the way \
all perished but King, whose life was saved by the
kindness of the blacks. The death of these heroic
men was lamented over all the continent. A public
funeral was accorded to their remains in Melbourne,
where a splendid monument now stands to hand
down to future generations the story of their success-
ful exploration and its harrowing ending.
Catholic.—ln 1839 the Bev. Father B. Geoghegan,
of the Order of St. Francis, and a native of Dublin, was
the first Catholic missionary to the infant settlement
of Yictoria. For a few months before going to Vic-
toria he had charge of St. Benedict’s district, Sydney,
where his zeal and piety were marked and productive
of the happiest results. Like all pioneer priests, he
had to endure many hardships—having no place for
some time to sleep in but the bar of a public-house.
His first Mass in Yictoria was offered up in the open
air. A short time after a little wooden chapel was
built at the corner of Lonsdale and Elizabeth streets,
where now stands the beautiful and popular church
of St. Francis of Assisi. Father Richard Walshe
(ordained in Sydney by Dr. Folding) was sent,
towards the end of 1839, to assist in the mission.
Father Geoghegan, with Mr. (afterwards Sir) John
O’Shannassy, were treasurers of the “ Port Phillip
Irish Relief Fund ”in 1846 and 1847. Both gentle-
men exerted themselves to the utmost in raising
money for the relief of their fellow-countrymen during
the terrible times of the famine in Ireland in those
years. The Rev. Dean Coffee was amongst the
zealous priests who helped to build up the Church in
Yictoria. He remained there until it was erected
into a bishopric, whereupon he returned to Sydney.


He was afterwards in charge of Parramatta parish,
where he died in 1882, much regretted.
First Bishop. —Father J. A. Goold was the first
Bishop of Victoria. In 1848 he was consecrated in
St. Mary’s, Sydney, by Dr. Folding. For ten years
previously he had laboured in various parts of Flew
South Wales. The young bishop made the journey
from Sydney to Melbourne (overland) in nineteen
days—no small feat in those days of bad roads.
His diocese extended from the Murray to the ocean.
Zealous, active, and shrewd, Dr. Goold began at once
to organise the Church for the great future he saw
before her in the colony. He opened Catholic
schools throughout the country, and introduced during
his administration teaching and religious orders—the
Jesuit Fathers, the Carmelite Order, the Christian
Brothers, the Sisters of Mercy, the Nuns of the Good
Shepherd, the Presentation Order, the Faithful Com-
panions of Jesus, and the Little Sisters of the Poor.
He was created Archbishop in 1874, and died in
1886, after governing the diocese for 38 years, leaving
behind him a memory loved by his own people and
honoured by all.
The Most Bev. Thomas Joseph Carr became suc-
cessor to Dr. Goold in 1887. He had been Bishop of
Galway, and it was at the Plenary Synod of Australasia,
held in 1885, that the Holy See was requested to ap-
point him Archbishop of Melbourne. His Grace’s works
speak for themselves. With voice and pen he has edified
and instructed Catholics, and confounded the enemies
of the Church. He has formed many new missions,
added the Religious of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters
of Charity, the Loretto Sisters, and the Sisters of St.
Joseph to the religious and teaching orders, estab-
lished additional superior and parochial schools, and
21 new churches, and the number of priests (increased
largely by the introduction of the Vincentian Fathers
in 1892) has been nearly doubled; while last, but not


least, the noble Cathedral of St. Patrick has been
completed by him. It was thirty-five years in building,
and cost £200,000. The ceremony of its consecration
took place on 31st October, 1897, and was the most
magnificent religious function ever witnessed in Aus-
tralia. The Archdiocese of Melbourne, it must not be
forgotten, enjoys a high reputation for the number and
completeness of its educational and charitable institu-
tions. The former include the fine college of St.
Francis Xavier at Kew, St. Patrick’s Colleges at
Melbourne and East Melbourne, St. Patrick’s at
Kilmore, as well as numerous popular and flourishing
superior schools for girls ; while among the many
noble monuments of Christian charity may be men-
tioned St. Vincent’s Orphanages at Melbourne, Our
Lady’s Orphanage at Geelong, the Industrial School
and Penitent Asylum at Abbotsford, the Magdalene
Asylum at South Melbourne, Home for Aged and
Infirm Poor at Northcote, Home for Neglected
Children at Surrey Hills, St. Joseph’s Providence at
Collingwood, and St. Vincent’s Hospital at Fitzroy.
Diocese Of Ballarat. —The city of Ballarat is
situated about seventy miles from Melbourne, at a
height above sea-level of 1500 feet. The Right Rev.
Hr. O’Connor was its first bishop, and was installed
by Hr. Goold in Hecember, 1874. The good bishop
devoted himself to the establishment of Catholic
schools throughout the diocese, which were in charge
of trained and efficient teachers—the Christian
Brothers and Sisters of the Loretto Community.
Numerous churches were also built, and an episcopal
residence was erected at a cost of £IO,OOO. Hr.
O’Connor made a visit to Rome and Ireland in 1881.
His flock presented him on his departure with £IOBO
as a mark of their reverence and esteem. A few
months after his return in 1882 he was attacked with
inflammation of the lungs, which caused his death on


14th February, 1883. He was mourned by all
classes as a loving, tender, charitable churchman.
The Right Rev. James Moore, Yicar-General under
the late bishop, succeeded him in 1884. He was
consecrated by Dr. Goold in St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Ballarat. Under Dr. Moore, £85,500 were expended
on schools, convents, churches, and presbyteries in the
city of Ballarat alone, in ten years, a fact which
shows the marvellous growth of the Church during
that period ; there and throughout the diocese the
expansion has been in proportion. At the end of
1897 the diocese contained 110 churches, numerous
superior and primary schools, in addition to the
splendid College of St. Patrick at Ballarat, conducted
by the Christian Brothers. Among the high schools
for Catholic young ladies, the Loretto Abbey at Mary’s
Mount, and the Loretto Convents at Dawson-street
and Portland, enjoy great popularity, and in connec-
tion with the former a flourishing training college for
teachers is carried on. The Brigidine Sisters conduct
a large boarding school at Ararat, and the Poor Sisters
of Nazareth labour zealously in the management of
Nazareth House, at Hill-street, Ballarat, into which
orphans, neglected children, and the aged poor of both
sexes, without distinction of creed, are received and
cared for.
Diocese Of Sandhurst.— Sandhurst, formerly
the celebrated goldfield called Bendigo, is 100 miles
from Melbourne. The Rev. Dr. Backhaus was the first
priest who followed the miners to Bendigo.
The Right Rev. Martin Crane, of the Order of
St. Augustine, was its first bishop appointed in 1874.
He was accorded a hearty welcome in Melbourne and
Sandhurst, on his arrival in May, 1875. His flock
still continue to look to him as a loving father. He
paid his required visit to Rome in 1882, and received
the thanks of the Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII., for


his zealous labours. When passing through London
he underwent an operation for cataract in the eyes,
which, unfortunately, resulted in total blindness. In
1886 he returned to the diocese, and was received
with marked respect.
The Eight Eev. Stephen Eeville, 0.5. A., adminis-
trator of the diocese during the absence of Dr. Crane,
was appointed his coadjutor in 1885, and has since
discharged all the active duties of the see. The
diocese contains 102 churches and nearly 40 priests,
while its educational wants are supplied by the
Hermits of Augustine, the Marist Brothers, the
Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St. Brigid, and the
Sisters of St. Joseph.
Diocese Of Sale.—Sale, the capital of Gippsland,
has for its first bishop the Eight Eev. James
F. Corbett, a native of Limerick, who held for
several years the office of Secretary to Archbishop
Goold, and was also pastor of St. Kilda. He was
consecrated by the Most Eev. Dr. Carr, Archbishop
of Melbourne, on 25th August, 1887. He had but
one priest on taking charge of his diocese. There are
now twelve priests, twelve nuns (of the Hotre Dame
de Sion order) 30 churches, and the Catholic popula-
tion is about 12,000.


CHAPTER VII.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Part of the coast of South Australia is said to have
been discovered by Peter Nuyts in 1627.
In 1802 Matthew Flinders, during his survey of
the Australian coast in the Investigator , explored the
southern shores from Fowler’s Bay to Encounter Bay,
giving names to the chief bays and capes as he passed.
The report furnished by Captain Sturt, in 1829,
of the capabilities of the Lower Murray basin,
as a promising agricultural region, attracted the
attention of many people in England. Among
these was Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who pro-
posed to found a colony in South Australia on
somewhat Utopian lines. He published a pamphlet in
London in which he drew an attractive picture of how a
new colony might be founded and worked. A high price
was to be set on the land, so as to exclude the poorer
settlers, who were too prone, it was said, to purchase
land and become their own masters as soon as possible.
It was to be a colony for the middle and upper
classes. Poor men coming to the colony would find
it impossible to purchase land, and would therefore
be forced to work for years for their employers. It
was persistently stated by the advocates of this
scheme that money invested in the proposed colony
would return fully five times as much as a like
amount invested in England. Many, therefore,
believed in Wakefield’s theories, and took shares in
the proposed colonisation company. The promoters
wanted an immense area of country for nothing, but


the British Government would not listen to such a
request, and, in consequence of this refusal, the
company was dissolved.
Another company, however, viz., The South
Australian Association, was formed in 1833,
and a charter granted to it three years later,
provided, among other things, that the colony
should be self-supporting. This meant, of course,
that no convicts were to be sent out to aid by
their labour in developing the lands of the settle-
ment. In 1836 the first immigrants arrived and
landed at Kangaroo Island. That being found un-
suitable for a city, Colonel Light, who had been sent
out by the Association as Surveyor-General, decided
on another site, midway between St. Vincent’s Gulf
and the foot of Mount Lofty Range, on the banks
of the Torrens. The capital was called Adelaide, in
honour of the wife of the reigning king, William IV.
Later on in the year Governor Hindmarsh
(1836-1838), who had been sent out by the Home
Government to rule the new settlement, arrived, and
soon quarrelled with Colonel Light over the site
chosen for the infant capital. Being a sailor, the
idea of building a city several miles from the sea
appeared absurd, so he tried to induce Colonel Light
and those acting with him to remove the settlement
to Encounter Bay, but all to no purpose. After much
wrangling on that matter, Hindmarsh was recalled
by the British Government, and his adversaries were
in turn cashiered by the Association.
Governor Gawler (1838-1841) succeeded Hind-
marsh. He found things looking very bad. The
young capital was little better than a rude camp ;
its inhabitants without hope or energy. There was
plenty of land, but nobody to till it. The rich settlers
who had first arrived soon became disgusted with
bush life, and did little else but speculate in town


lots at Adelaide. Poor immigrants were arriving
from time to time, but there was no work for them,
as none could pay them, and to make matters worse,
the high price fixed upon for land made it impossible
for them to acquire holdings on their own account.
Want and poverty became general. To relieve
the widespread distress the Governor started a
number of public works, improved the city, built
wharves, and erected a Custom House at 'Port
Adelaide. In this w&j he spent his private
fortune, but even that was not enough to meet the
claims for wages. He appealed to the Home Govern-
ment for help, and drew on them to pay for goods
sent out to the country. A few of the earlier drafts
only were paid ; the others were dishonoured. The
authorities in England reminded the Governor that, by
the terms of the charter of the colony, it was to be
self-supporting. The debts incurred amounted to
£400,000, which made the colony practically insolvent,
as no one was willing to pay this sum. Everyone was
anxious to quit the colony. Owners of land were
willing to sell it for sufficient to pay their passage to
England. The British Government censured Governor
Gawler, and he had to give place to Captain (after-
wards Sir) George Grey. The debts of the colony were
at length paid by the Imperial Government, but all
political power was taken away from the South
Australian Association, the Home authorities taking
the control of the colony into their own hands.
Governor Grey (1841-1845) found the great
majority of the workmen in the colony dependent on
relief works or Government wages, and without enter-
prise enough to engage in any undertaking on their
own account. The former he at once abolished, and
at the same time reduced the wages for all Govern-
ment work to almost starvation rates, thus forcing
the workmen to seek employment on the farms and
stations of the interior, and generally to trust rather


to their own efforts than to Government assist-
ance. He encouraged settlement on the land, recom-
mended habits of thrift and industry, and brought
the expenditure of the colony down to its income.
Good fortune as well as good management charac-
terised Grey’s period of administration, for in 1841
galena was found in Mount Lofty Ranges, and in
the following year copper was discovered at Kapunda
Station and also at Burra Burra, 90 miles from
Adelaide. These discoveries helped greatly in making
the colony prosperous. During the first three years of
Governor Grey’s regime South Australia was lifted out
of her financial difficulties, and instead of having to
pay ruinous prices for imported wheat and flour, was
able to export wheat to the other colonies. In
addition, sheep-farming had been commenced, and the
industry was assuming large proportions. During
the four years of Grey’s rule settlement on the Crown
lands had greatly extended, and this circumstance,
added to the growing fame of her copper mines,
caused population to stream into the colony from the
eastern settlements. Thus the dangers that threatened
the very existence of the colony were removed.
In 1844 Captain Charles Sturt, the discoverer
of the Darling and the first explorer of the lower
Murray, led an expedition from Adelaide to the centre
of the continent. It was well fitted out, and in-
cluded Messrs. Poole (surveyor), Browne (surgeon),
and J. McDouall Stuart (draughtsman). Sturt
discovered and named the Stanley and Grey
Ranges in Hew South Wales. The former is
now known as the Barrier Range, whose silver deposits
are some of the richest in the world. A thriving and
populous city now stands in the midst of the dreary
plain passed over by the explorers. At a place which
they named Rocky Glen, where there appeared to be
plenty of water, the party formed a depdt. The
summer heat of 1844 was intense, and soon dried up


most of the creeks in the neighbourhood. Their
terrible sufferings then commenced, and for six
months they were imprisoned in a furnace-like desert.
They could not live above ground. They excavated
an underground chamber to live in so as to escape the
burning blasts that threatened to wither them up.
Sturt made several attempts to find a means of
escape for himself and his party. He found
the region to the north barren and sandy, and
called it Stony Desert. Short of provisions and
without water, he determined to return. After
encountering blinding sand billows and other hard-
ships, he reached Adelaide blind and dispirited, be-
lieving that the centre of Australia was a desert.
This opinion has been shown by later explorations to
be quite erroneous.
Governor Robe succeeded Sir George Grey, who
was appointed Governor of Hew Zealand—at that
time in grave financial difficulties. Robe having proved
unsuccessful as a governor, was recalled at the end of
three years, and was succeeded by Sir Henry Young’,
during whose rule Captain Cadell, in the Lady
Augusta, ascended the Murray a distance of 300 miles,
thereby securing for her owners the bonus of <£4ooo
offered for the successful navigation of the river.
In 1851 the steady progress of the colony was
checked for a time by the rush to the goldfields of
Victoria. Industries were at a standstill for want
of workmen. The Governor established an escort
between Adelaide and Dendigo. Many of the
diggers sent their gold by that route instead of
sending it to Melbourne, and the advantage which
the Governor desired of turning part of the stream of
Victorian gold towards South Australia was secured.
After a time many of those who had been stricken
with the gold fever returned to their former pursuits
and occupations, finding them more satisfactory and
profitable than the uncertainty of gold-digging.


In 1856 the Imperial Parliament conceded to the
colony the full measure of Responsible Govern-
ment which she now enjoys. Progressive legislation
has in' an especial manner been a marked feature of
the colony’s later history. Possibly one of the most
useful statutes ever passed by any legislature was Sir
Robert Torrens’s Real Property Act , which simplified
and cheapened the transfer of real estate. This
measure was passed by the S.A. Parliament in 1858,
and its provisions have since been adopted throughout
the whole of the Australian colonies.
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.
In 1824 the first British settlement in this region
was established on Melville Island. In 1831 Port
Essington was chosen as a military post and harbour
of refuge, but was abandoned in 1850. In 1864 the
Northern Territory, which lies within the tropics,
was added to South Australia, the original northern
boundary of which was the parallel of 26° S.
In 1862 Mr. John McDouall Stuart explored the
interior of the continent from Adelaide to Adam Bay,
in Yan Diemen’s Gulf. He gave so favourable an
account of the country which he passed over that
the South Australian Government petitioned the
Home Government for a grant of the whole Northern
Territory, which was ceded to them, as already
stated, in 1864. The Port Darwin Settlement was
made the same year, and it has prospered. Tropical
fruits and grain grow well there, and the surrounding
country abounds in minerals.
Overland Telegraph. —This important national
work was undertaken, in 1869, by the Government of
South Australia and completed in three years. The
line followed the route taken by Stuart in his
journey across the continent in 1862. The distance


was 2000 miles, more than half of which was
through desert country. Sir Charles Todd supervised
this great national work, and it was owing to his
skill and courage under many difficulties that it
was brought to a successful issue. The Eastern
Telegraph Company laid a submarine cable from
Banjowangie, in Java, to connect with the overland
line at Port Darwin. Congratulatory messages
passed between the Mayor of London and the Mayor
of Adelaide in October, 1872. Since then, all Aus-
tralia has shared in the advantages of international
communication through the great enterprise.
# Catholic. —Dr. Uliathorne was the first priest to
visit Adelaide. On his arrival in 1840 he found
about fifty Catholics there. The Government refused
him the use of a common building for celebrating
Mass. A Protestant, Mr. John Benthon Neals, was
more liberal. He gave the use of his shop twice a
week, where the Doctor said Mass, preached, and
otherwise instructed his flock.
Mr. Leigh, of Woodchester (England), a convert,
endowed a Catholic Bishopric at Adelaide, by giving
four acres of land in North Adelaide, and 600°acres
at Little Para, as well as a cash donation of .£2OOO.
Father Benson was the first priest stationed on the
mission (towards the end of 1841). He was simple
in character, and so poor were his little flock, that
he had to work at carpentering to earn a livelihood
for himself. He returned to England in 1845 s and
was engaged in the missions in Wales.
First Bishop.— The Right Rev. Francis Murphy
was first Bishop of Adelaide. He was consecrated by
Archbishop Folding, in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney,
in 1844 He had laboured in Sydney since 1839,
with the greatest zeal and devotion. On the 9th
October, 1844, he arrived in Adelaide—then a
desolate mission, without even one priest. Father


Edward Mahony, of Maitland (X.S.W.), had been
sent down to prepare the people to receive the Bishop.
Father Michael Ryan, of Penrith, accompanied his
Lordship to Adelaide, and was for many years his
faithful and zealous Yicar-General. Amidst trials
and hardships, Dr. Murphy laboured for 14 years
and accomplished much. There were twenty-one
Catholic churches and thirteen priests in the colony
when he died. His death, like his life, was edifying
and holy.
The Right Rev. P. B. Geoghegan succeeded Dr.
Murphy. His early missionary life in Victoria is
referred to in Chapter VI. He was consecrated
Bishop of Adelaide in 1859. and during his episcopate
efforts were made to complete the Cathedral of St.
Francis Xavier. He died in Dublin in 1864.
The Right Rev. Lawrence B. Shiel was third
Bishop of Adelaide. He was consecrated by Dr.
Goold, in St. Francis Church, Melbourne, in 1866.
In 1867 he visited Rome and Ireland, and brought
back with him from Ireland some priests and a
community of Dominican nuns. He assisted at the
Vatican Council in 1869. During his absence, the
Rev. Dr. Smith, the V icar-General of the diocese,
died. Loved and revered by all classes, his death
was regarded as a public loss.
In 1868 the Sisters of St. Joseph were established
in Adelaide, chiefly through the zeal of the accom-
plished geologist, the late Rev. J. E. Tenison-Woods.
Branches of this Australian sisterhood have since
spread over the other colonies, while the Dominican
Runs (founded from Cabra, Dublin, in the same year),
the Sisters of Mercy (founded from Buenos Ayres in
1881), and the Christian and Marist Brothers are
engaged in the holy work of training the youth of the
Adelaide Archdiocese in religious and secular know-
ledge. The Christian Brothers’ College in Wakefield
street, Adelaide, is held in high esteem throughout


the whole colony. Dr. Shiel took part, in 1871, in
the dedication of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Ballarat,
after which he returned to his diocese, and resumed
his sacred duties. But his health was failing. He
went to Willungra to recruit, but he was past recovery,
and passed away there on Ist March, 1872.
The Bight Bev. Christopher Augustine Beynolds
was next Bishop of Adelaide. The progress of re-
ligion after 1873, when he became bishop, was very
marked. In 1885 he was made Archbishop of Ade-
laide, and in the administration of his diocese His
Grace was ably assisted by the Venerable Arch-
deacon Bussell and the Very Bev. Dr. Byrne up
to the time of his death, which occurred on the 12 th
June, 1893.
The Bight Bev. Dr. O’Beily, Bishop of Port
Augusta, was appointed by Papal Brief dated sth
January, 1895, to fill the vacant See. (Since his
appointment His Grace has continued to display the
same zeal and untiring energy in promoting the
interests of religion that marked his administration
of Port Augusta.
Diocese of Port Augusta.— -The Bight Bev.
John O’Beily was appointed first bishop in 1888.
His Lordship found his diocese heavily in debt, and
at once devoted his best energies to reducing it,
while the growing demands for new churches, con-
vents, and schools were not overlooked. The death
of the Archbishop of Adelaide led to His Lordship’s
translation to that See, and the vacancy thus caused
was happily filled by the Bight Bev. James Maher,
who had been Vicar-General and Administrator of the
diocese, and who was consecrated at Adelaide on 26th
April, 1896. The religious sisterhoods of the diocese
comprise the Sisters of St. Joseph and the Sisters of
the Good Samaritan, who conduct schools in the
chief centres of population. At the end of 1897 the
diocese contained 35 churches, and a Catholic popu-


lation of about 12,000, whose spiritual wants are
attended to by 16 priests.
Diocese of Port Victoria and Palmerston.—
The attempts to establish a mission in the capital of
the Northern Territory met with many difficulties.
The Right Rev. Dr. Serra, 0.5.8., who was appointed,
in 1846, first bishop of the diocese, was transferred
to Perth, in Western Australia, before he took
possession of the former see. In 1847, the Rev. R.
Salvado, 0.5.8., was consecrated bishop to succeed
him in the see of Port Victoria. The place was
abandoned before his arrival, and he took charge of
the monastery of New Norcia, in Western Australia.
The Rev. Duncan McNab, who had for years laboured
hard among the Queensland blacks, interested himself,
while at Rome, in 1881, in the movement for estab-
lishing a mission in the Northern Territory, whither
in 1883 three Jesuit Fathers, with one lay brother,
left Adelaide for the purpose of civilising and con-
verting the aborigines. They established a station at
Rapid Creek on an aboriginal reserve, about seven
miles north-east from Palmerston. In 1886 a second
mission was established on a Government grant on
the Daly River, about 200 miles distant from the
former, and three years later a third mission was
begun, about 18 miles away, on the same reserve.
In 1891 these three stations were abandoned—the
first, because of its being too close to the Chinese and
white settlements; the two on the Daly River in
favour of a better site on another part of the same
stream, where, through the kindness of the South
Australian Government, better land was secured. The
mission at present (1898) numbers three fathers and
five lay brothers, and great success has attended their
devoted labours.


CHAPTER VIII.
QUEENSLAND.
A.s stated in Chapter 1., the northern part of this
colony was among one of the first places on the
continent on which Europeans landed. The east coast
visited, it is believed, by Dutch and Portuguese
navigators early in the seventeenth century. Captain
Cook, in his voyage northwards in 1770, named
Moreton Bay after the Earl of Moreton, President
of the Royal Society. He also gave names to the
inlets and headlands on the coast as far as Cape
York, and at Possession Island he took possession of
the eastern coast in the name of King George 111.
Matthew Flinders, in 1799, surveyed Moreton
and Hervey Bays in the Norfolk , a cutter of 24 tons,
supplied by Governor Hunter. In 1801 the English
Admiralty sent him out in the Investigator to survey
the entire coast of Australia. Leaving Spithead in
July, he began his work at Cape Leeuwin, and made
charts of the southern coast. Stopping a month in
Sydney for supplies and repairs, he proceeded north-
wards as far as Cape York, carefully mapping out the
coast, and making a correct chart of the Great Barrier
Reef. He next made a chart of Torres Strait, and
of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Finding his vessel in need
of overhauling, he went to Timor for repairs and
supplies. He then surveyed the west coast, after which
he returned to Sydney, being the first to sail round
Australia. Lieutenant Philip King, in the Mermaid
made a chart of all the eastern shores of Queensland
in 1817.


John Oxley, in 1823, discovered the Brisbane
River, and made a hurried survey of it for fifty miles,
besides discovering and naming the Bremer, one of its
tributaries. The existence of the Brisbane River was
known some time before, to two runaway convicts,
named Finnegan and Pamphlett, who had been
wrecked on the coast. These men Oxley found living
among the blacks at the time of his visit, and it is
said that Pamphlett guided Oxley up the Brisbane
River. He was much struck with the fertility of the
country, and on his return to Sydney recommended it
as suitable for a convict station. One was formed at
Eagle Farm, near Brisbane, in 1824, under Captain
Miller, of the 40th Regiment, and he was succeeded
next year by Captain Bishop. Captain Logan was
commandant of the settlement for the next five years,
and his rule was marked by savage cruelty. He was
murdered near Ipswich by the blacks in 1830, and
some writers have expressed the opinion that some of
the convicts were implicated in the murder. In 1839
the convict settlement at Brisbane was broken up.
Allan Cunningham, a botanist, discovered the
Darling Downs in 1827. These fine pasture lands were
soon taken up by squatters, and from that time to the
present they have been noted as some of the finest
grazing districts of Australia. In 1840, owing to the
discovery of a practicable route across the Dividing
Range, below Toowoomba, the Darling Downs
residents secured a ready outlet for their produce,
while, for the same reason, the commercial importance
of the settlement at Moreton Bay was also greatly
increased.
The city of Brisbane was laid out by Governor
Gipps in 1841. Two years later the Moreton Bay
district became entitled to send elected representatives
to the Legislative Council in Sydney, and Captain
Wickham was appointed Government Resident in


1853. He held that position till 1859, when the
district was separated from New South Wales, and
erected into an independent colony, under the
name of Queensland. The success of the separation
movement was in a great measure due to the exertions
of the late Dr. Lang. The first Governor of Queens-
land was Sir George Bowen.
With the progress of settlement came deadly
encounters between the pioneer settlers and the
blacks. The story is a sorrowful one, and goes to
prove that the Christian white man is sometimes as
savage as the heathen black. Stealing sheep and
other property was the principal crime of the blacks.
They were driven to this, perhaps, by hunger. How
were they punished? Like dogs—shot or poisoned.
Native troopers, who took joy in slaughtering their
countrymen, pursued them without mercy. On one
occasion a tribe, suspected of the murder of a white
man, was fired upon while holding a corroboree at
night. Those who were not shot were clubbed to
death. On another occasion twenty-two were shot by
a party of squatters. Again, it was not uncommon
to poison the aborigines wholesale when it was
desired to rid a run of their presence. Flour mixed
with arsenic was once given as a present to the blacks
of an out station. All who ate of it died after
suffering frightful agonies. It was against such in-
human acts that the Hon. John Hubert Plunkett
courageously set the law in motion, and, in spite of
much opposition on the part of the friends of the
murderers, seven of the latter were hanged.
Explorations.—Ludwig Leichhardt and Ken-
nedy are probably the greatest heroes of Queensland
exploration. The former’s expeditions from Moreton
Bay to Port Essington have already been described.
Edmund Kennedy, in 1848, was sent to explore
Cape York Peninsula. The party left Sydney in
April, and reached Rockingham Bay without mishap.


They found the country most difficult to penetrate—
a dense, tall scrub, matted together with lawyer
vines, which blocked them at every step, proving a
galling scourge to the explorers. Through this they
had to cut their way with saws and hatchets. Pro-
visions running short, eight of his men were left at
Weymouth Bay. Kennedy then pushed on with
three men and Jacky Jacky , an aboriginal belonging
to the Patrick’s Plains tribe, on the Hunter River.
Owing to a gun accident one of the men was left
behind at Shelburne Bay, in charge of the other two
white men. Kennedy and Jacky started for Cape
York to get assistance from a schooner which had been
sent thither to await the arrival of the explorers.
On the way they were attacked by the blacks.
The intrepid leader fell from a spear wound.
The faithful Jacky mournfully buried his master,
secured the journals, and made the best of his
way to Cape York, which he reached in a most
forlorn state after thirteen days of unheard-of hard-
ships. After attending to the wants of poor Jacky,
the captain of the schooner proceeded in all haste to
the rescue of the men left at Shelburne Bay, and to
the aid of those left at Weymouth Bay. Ko trace of
the former could be found, and only two out of the
eight of the latter were living.
Mr. A. C. Gregory, in 1856, started from
Cambridge Gulf to explore the centre of Australia.
Well-watered, good country was first met with, but this
was followed by sand ridges, which stopped his advance
southwards. He traced the Kicholson and Albert Rivers,
and reached within about 150 miles of the tropic of
Capricorn. Two years later he went in search of the
lost explorer, Leichhardt, but found no certain traces
of him. Messrs. Landsborough, Dalrymple,
Favenc, Crawford, Lindsay, and the Rev. J. E.
Tenison-Woods have also done good service in the
exploration of Central Queensland.


Discovery Of Gold, —Gold was discovered on the
banks of the Fitzroy in 1858. The new field attracted
thousands of diggers, but the precious metal being
confined to a small area, the majority of the gold-
seekers were disappointed. Having spent their all to
reach the field, they had no money to buy provisions
or to pay their passage home. There was so much
distress that at length the Governments of Hew South
Wales and Victoria sent vessels to convey the unfortu-
nate men back to their homes in the southern colonies.
A few remained and settled on the flats of the river,
where the town of Rockhampton afterwards sprang up.
The Gympie goldfield, 130 miles from Brisbane,
was discovered in 1867 by a man named Hash, who
was paid the £lOOO Government reward. The Palmer
River field, far to the north, attracted gold diggers
from all parts of Australia.
Mount Morgan mine, near Rockhampton, has
eclipsed all the goldfields of Australia in richness.
It originally formed part of a selection 640 acres in
extent, belonging to a man named Gordon, who dis-
posed of it to the Morgans (two brothers) for £1 per
acre. Soon after this transaction, mining operations
were set on foot. It has paid nearly £3,000,000 in
dividends, and, as the deposit is of unknown depth,
and yields the richest native gold yet found, it is
impossible to estimate the value of the mine.
Cotton and Sugar. —The cultivation of the
cotton plant was commenced in 1861, but for many
years the pursuit was not profitable, owing to
the high price of labour. The planters at length
determined to employ Polynesian labourers (kanakas
or South Sea Islanders) who were imported, and
worked for a mere pittance. Soon the industry became
more profitable, but abuses, such as kidnapping, grew
rife with the island traffic in labour, until it was regu-
lated by Acts of Parliament. Then the scandals in


connection with it were to a great extent done away
with. The islanders were satisfied, and often voluntarily
re-engaged after having served the first term. Sugar-
growing is also a thriving industry in Queensland,
and coloured labour principally is employed in its
production. The value of the cane grown in 1894 was
£611,415.
Catholic. —Father Therry was the first priest who
visited Moreton Bay district (1838). Archbishop
Bolding and the Rev. Dr. Gregory landed in Brisbane
in 1843, and celebrated Mass to 130 Catholics.
Darling Downs and other districts were visited. The
special purpose of His Grace's visit was to found a
settlement for the aborigines in the Moreton Bay
district. In 1858, the Archbishop, with Archdeacon
Rigney, made a tour of seven weeks through the
inland districts of the colony, ministering to the few
Catholics that were scattered thirty or forty miles
apart.
Dean Hanly and Father McGinnety were sent
from Sydney, in 1843, to minister to the spiritual
wants of Queensland. The former was in charge of
Brisbane, the latter of Ipswich. Dean Hanly was
the Father Therry of the north. His name is still
fondly remembered throughout the district. Many
were the difficulties he met with in attending to the
duties of his sacred calling. On one occasion he had to
swim the river Brisbane, on a sick call. Afterwards,
with the aid of a few settlers, he made a plank bridge
across it. With similar help he built a weatherboard
dwelling for a poor widow who had lost her husband
while clearing their little selection.
First Bishop. The Rev. James O’Quinn, D.D.,
was the first Bishop of Queensland. Dr. O’Quinn had
previously filled many high positions. As President
of the St. Lawrence O’Toole Seminary, Dublin, he had
secured for that institution great success.


The bishop, with five priests and six Sisters of
Mercy, arrived in Brisbane in 1861. There was little
or no accommodation for them, and all had to suffer
for a time many trials and inconveniences. Hard
work in long and laborious visitations, sick calls,
preaching, &c., was the portion of the bishop the
greater part of his life. His first visitation included
Maryborough, the Burnett and Condamine districts,
returning to Brisbane via Dalby, Toowoomba, and
Ipswich—more than 1000 miles on horseback. In his
visits to the various goldfields, he had often to live on
damper and sardines.
Hr. O’Quinn’s immigration scheme to Queensland
was very successful, and has proved a lasting benefit
to the colony. After the famine of of 1847, the Irish
were fleeing from their country year by year. His
Lordship determined to divert a portion of the stream
of emigration from Ireland to Queensland. “ The
Queensland Immigration Society” received favourably
his proposal to assist industrious and respectable
emigrants from Ireland. The first ship, the Erin-
go-Bragh (christened Erin-go-Slow by the passen-
gers before the end of their five months’ voyage),
contained 400 Irish passengers, selected by the Bev.
Patrick Hunne (now Vicar-General at Albury, New
South Wales). After leaving the Cape of Good
Hope, where they put in for water and fresh pro-
visions, the ship was in danger of foundering, through
the action of some wicked person boring an auger
hole in her bottom. It was believed to be the work
of a bigoted anti-Catholic, because the Orangemen of
Liverpool were heard to say that she would never
reach the shores of Australia. In three years the
brave Father Hunne made six voyages between
Queensland and Ireland. He suffered many privations
during those voyages, shipwreck on one occasion, but
they were borne cheerfully for faith and fatherland.
Six thousand Irish came out under his protection.


Dr. O’Quinn attended the Vatican Council in
1869, and took an active part in its proceedings,
being appointed on two special committees. On his
return, in 1871, he was accompanied by Archdeacon
Bigney, two priests, and ten Sisters of Mercy for
his own diocese.
On two remarkable occasions His Lordship’s coolness
and courage were displayed in Brisbane. When the
navvies of the Ipswich railway rose and marched to
Government House demanding bread or work, he
calmed them by a short speech, which induced them
to try other means than overawing the authorities
for obtaining redress of their grievances. The other
occasion was when he became an Orangeman for the
time being. On the 9th November, 1874, the Orange-
men assembled at Oxley Pocket, near Brisbane,
breathing fire and thunder against “ the Pope and
Popery.” Dr. O’Quinn joined them, to their great
surprise. Mounting a cart, he spoke to them so
kindly, charitably, and with such tact that the hisses
with which he was at first received were soon turned
to cheers.
In 1874 Dr. Vaughan, Coadjutor Archbishop of
Sydney, with the Bishops of Bathurst, Maitland,
Goulburn, and Armidale, visited Brisbane, to take
part in the dedication of St. Stephen’s Cathedral.
They were received in a princely manner, and non-
Catholics —from the Governor downwards—showed
them every mark of respect.
Dr. O’Quinn, like most of the bishops and priests
of Australia, had always an eye to the future in the
selection of sites for churches and for other church
property. In no other colony, perhaps, has there
been so much valuable church property accumulated
as in Queensland. The good Bishop spent every
pound he could spare in acquiring it, and by his will
he left all to his successor. The Prime Minister of
Queensland, a Protestant, gave expression to the


general feeling of colonists on the death of the great
Bishop, in 1881, when he said:—“The Bishop’s death
is not only a Roman Catholic loss, but a grievous loss
to the whole colony ; there was not in this or any
of the colonies a more enlightened or cultured scholar
or a more perfect gentleman.”
The Right Rev. Robert Dunne, who had been
stationed at Toowoomba for many years, was con-
secrated by Archbishop Yaughan in St. Stephen’s
Cathedral in 1882, and was made Archbishop of
Brisbane in 1887. He is a worthy successor of Dr.
O’Quinn, and has done much since his appointment
in advancing religion and education. The Catholic
population of the Archdiocese is fully 60,000, whose
spiritual wants are attended to by a staff of zealous
priests to the number of 50, while 25 Christian
Brothers and 186 Sisters of Mercy provide superior
and primary education for the Catholic youth. In
regard to charitable institutions, Brisbane occupies a
prominent place among the Australian capitals.
Among these the chief are (i.) St. Vincent's Orphanage ,
Nudgee, erected at a cost of £22,000. (The site of
this noble institution was the gift of the late Bishop
Dr. O’Quinn, and is under the management of the
Sisters of Mercy, who, to the number of 22 are con-
stantly employed in superintending, teaching, and
otherwise caring for their 500 little charges); (n.) the
Magdalen Asylum , conducted by the Sisters of Mercy
at Lutwyche, about three miles from Brisbane ; (m.)
the Home of Mercy , where young girls are received
and trained for domestic service; (iv.) the Night
Refuge or Servants' Home , where young women,
temporarily out of employment, may find a safe
retreat; and (v.) St. Francis de Sales Printing Office ,
where boys from the St. Vincent’s Orphanage are
taught the printing trade. (Several of the largest
printing firms in Queensland are now employing lads
who served their apprenticeship at this establishment).


Diocese of Rockhampton.— The Rev. John
Cani, an Italian, was consecrated first Bishop of
Rockhampton in 1882. This worthy prelate, after
about 16 years’ service in the north, succumbed to an
attack of dengue fever in March, 1898. He built a
large orphanage at Neerkol, which is a model institu-
tion, where 200 children are trained to various
industries. The convents at Rockhampton, Towns-
ville, and Charters Towers are other monuments
of the good bishop’s forethought. Sixteen priests
labour at present on the mission, and 63 Sisters of
Mercy conduct superior and primary schools, attended
by 3000 children in the chief centres of population.
The Right Rev. Dr. Hutchinson was for about ten
years Bishop of North Queensland diocese, which
has Cooktown for its centre. He was consecrated in
Sydney by the Cardinal Archbishop in 1887.
His death, which took place about the end of
1897, was deeply mourned. Thirteen fathers
were labouring with him. At the time of his
death churches and schools had been erected in
all the centres of population, and there were
convents of the Sisters of Mercy, with well-filled
schools, in Cooktown and Cairns. Dr. Murray was
chosen by the Holy See to succeed the Right Rev.
Dr. Hutchinson. His Lordship is a native of
Meath, and was educated at Navan, in Ireland.
Some years ago he came to Australia and officiated
at Cooktown and Echuca (in Victoria). He was
prior of St. Mary’s Monastery at the latter place
when chosen for the Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown,
and his consecration took place at Bendigo in July,
1898.


CHAPTER IX.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The early discoveries on the coasts of Western
Australia are given in Chapter I.
In 1825 it was rumoured at Sydney that the
French threatened to occupy some part of the western
coast of Australia. To prevent this and thereby avoid
possible complications in the future, Major Lockyer,
with a gang of soldiers and prisoners from Sydney,,
was sent in 1826 to forestall them. He landed his
company of 75 at Albany, on King George’s Sound.
Here they engaged in whaling, until five years later
the settlement was transferred to Rockingham Bay,,
14 miles south of Fremantle.
In 1828, Captain Stirling, an English commander
was sent in the Success to examine the western coast.
He spoke so favourably of it, that the Home Govern-
ment decided to found a colony there. The new settle-
ment was to be conducted without assistance from the
Government except in the matter of grants of land.
In 1829 Captain Fremantle, who was despatched in
the Challenger with a few men to do the pioneering
work, hoisted the British flag near the mouth of the
Swan River, at a spot where the town of Fremantle,
called after him, now stands. The same year the
colonising expedition arrived from England, and
Western Australia was proclaimed a British colony,,
Captain Stirling* being first governor. Captain
Fremantle had made a careful examination of the
district near the mouth of the Swan River and found
it altogether unfit for the permanent site of the new
settlement. But the settlers, under the control of:


Captain Stirling, having arrived immediately after-
wards, a landing was made on Garden Island, where
many hardships endured for several months,
until the present site of the capital, Perth, was at
last chosen further up the river.
The Governor and all the chief officials received, in
lieu of their salary, grants of land. Every settler
who arrived obtained from the Government 40 acres
of land for every £,3 worth of goods brought him
into the colony. As a result, costly and unsuitable
articles ( eg ., valuable jewellery and costly furniture,
carriages, pianos, <kc.), were brought to the settlement,
and were left, in many cases, on the sea shore to rot
owing to the great difficulty experienced in getting
goods conveyed to the town. All the settlers became
owners of land, but made little use of it. A Mr. Peel
was an exception. He spent £50,000 in farming and
sheepbreeding, but unfortunately his praiseworthy
enterprise was not successful, owing to the inferior
character of most of the land, and he was reduced to
the position of a small settler. Many others fared
worse ; they had nothing. The outlook of the little
colony was gloomy. Those who could raise sufficient
money to pay their passage to Europe did so ; others
left for the eastern settlements. Among the latter
were the Hentys, who engaged in whaling at
Portland Bay. Immigration was stopped, and it was
rumoured that the place was to be abandoned; but
instead of taking that extreme step Western Australia
w'as, at the urgent request of the inhabitants, turned
into a penal settlement by the British Govern-
ment, and as such it continued from 1849 to 1868.
The money spent in maintaining the convicts gave
some stimulus to the commerce of the settlement, the
farming industry especially being benefited thereby.
On the cessation of transportation—which was put
a stop to much against the wishes of a large section
of the people—depression and discontent again pre-


vailed, but Governor Weld at length roused
the colonists to action and energy by inducing them
to depend more upon themselves. Shortly after his
arrival, in 1869, he travelled through the settled
districts of the and made himself personally
acquainted with the requirements of the people. He
also entrusted them with a large share in the manage-
ment of matters of purely local concern, and in this
way prepared the colonists for responsible govern-
ment, extended to them in 1890. During his rule
much knowledge of the physical character of the
interior and its resources was acquired.
Explorations. —Thegeographical knowledge of the
interior was extended by the labours of Colonel War-
burton, and Messrs. Gosse, Giles, and Ross, who are
honourably mentioned in the despatches of Governor
Weld. Sir (then Captain) George Grey, afterwards
Governor of New Zealand, explored the country on the
north-west (1837 to 1840). He discovered the Glenelg,
flowing into Collier Bay, and Gascoigne, flowing into
Shark Bay. In 1840, Edward John Eyre completed
a trying journey from Eowler Bay to King George’s
Sound, along the Great Australian Bight, and in 1858
Frank Gregory discovered valuable pastoral country
in the Gascoigne and Murchison districts.
Mr. (now Sir) John Forrest was sent out to
look for some traces of the lost Leichhardt.
The search was fruitless. In 1870 he led an
expedition from Shark Bay to Adelaide, which he
succeeded in reaching in five months after start-
ing. None of the difficulties experienced by Eyre,
in his memorable journey to King George’s Sound,
along the Australian Bight, thirty years previously,
were met with. The party kept more inland than
Eyre, and thus avoided his desolate and barren route.
They crossed many grassy plains, found water at long
distances and in small quantities. Their description


of the country traversed, was far more hopeful than
that given by Eyre of his journey.
In 1871 Mr. Alexander Forrest discovered a con
siderable tract of good country eastward of Perth,
which was soon taken up for grazing.
The brothers Forrest, in 1874, led an expedition to
the north-eastern part of the colony, and explored the
Murchison and Gascoigne, which flow into the Indian
Ocean. They found the country from Champion Bay
to the head of the Murchison well suited for pastoral
purposes. Peake, on the overland telegraph line,
was reached in less than seven months after leaving
Perth.
The transportation of convicts to Western
Australia ceased in 1878, and responsible
government was introduced in 1890, while Sir
W. C. F. Robinson was Governor.
The rich goldfields of Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie,
and other places worked since 1894, have turned
the eyes of the world on Western Australia, and her
prosperity since has advanced by leaps and bounds.
Railway communication is being extended into the
heart of the colony, and other public works are
receiving the attention of the Government. From
present appearances the colony bids fair to take the
first place in mineral wealth, and at no distant date
to equal any of the other colonies in trade and
commerce.
Catholic. —The Rev. John Brady was appointed
to the charge of the mission in Western Australia in
1843, by Archbishop Folding, with the title of Yicar-
General. The Rev. J ohn J oostens and an
Irish catechist named Patrick O’Rielly accompanied
him to Perth. There the missionaries were cordially
welcomed by Governor Hutt, who granted them three
allotments of land whereon to erect a church, school,
and presbytery. The erection of a church, capable


of accommodating 150 persons, was at once com-
menced. A school was opened which Father Brady
himself taught for some time. In 1844 he visited
Rome in the interests of his mission. He wanted
more priests. He gave a hopeful account of the
prospects of the place, and suggested that Dr. Ullathorne
should be appointed bishop, and that there should be
a separate mission for the aborigines, whom he de-
scribed as far superior to those of New South Wales.
Dr. Ullathorne having declined the dignity offered
to him of Bishop of Perth, Father Brady was
consecrated Bishop on 18th May, 1845, in the
Collegiate Church of the Propaganda. The new
Bishop visited France and Ireland for missionaries,
and succeeded in securing several priests, cate-
chists, and nuns, who arrived in January, 1846, and
were welcomed by all classes. Father Powell
was the only English-speaking priest among the
new arrivals, and he was placed in charge of the
cathedral, where his sermons and instructions were
very popular. Illness soon compelled him to leave
Western Australia, and he became the pioneer priest of
North Sydney in 1855. He died in Belgium in 1872.
The central mission to the aborigines, called New
Norcia, was entrusted to the Spanish Fathers, Dom
Serra as superior and Dom Salvado as his assistant.
They had much up-hill work in the mission for many
years. They got into debt. Dom Serra went to
Europe to collect funds for the carrying on of the
great work, and was very successful. While there
he was consecrated Bishop of Port Victoria, Northern
Territory. It was feared that the sums collected
by him for Western Australia might now be applied
to the new diocese. Dr. Brady became alarmed
as to how the debts on the diocese, amounting
to £IO,OOO, were to be paid. After mature
consideration, he commissioned Dom Salvado to
proceed to Europe to collect funds to pay them.


In the meantime the monetary troubles which
beset him were too much for the Bishop. His health
gave way. He petitioned the Holy See for a co-
adjutor. Dr. Serra was translated from Port Vic-
toria to Perth ; and Dom Salvado was consecrated
Bishop of Port Victoria in 1849. Dr. Serra con-
tinued bishop until 1859, when he quitted the colony,
leaving the Bev. Martin Driver as administrator.
The latter was appointed Bishop of Perth in 1869,
Bishop Serra having withdrawn to his native land,
Spain, where he died in 1886,
Dr. Driver’s character, sketched by one familiar
with his daily life, is described as “ patient, pious,
and inspired with a most ardent zeal.” In 1881,
when he visited Home, there were 8500 Oatholics in
his diocese and 1300 children in the Datholic schools,
three convents with twenty-five nuns, and two
orphanages with 100 children. In New Norcia there
were 100 aborigines “ settled in their own homes and
buildings, cultivating the land and taking part with
the lay brothers in all the details of farm work.”
The saintly Bishop died in 1886.
Dr. Matthew Dibney, who had as a priest in
Victoria displayed singular bravery during a notorious
bushranging disturbance and capture, succeeded Dr.
Driver as Bishop of Perth. Under this heroic bishop
the building of churches, convents, and schools has
been pushed on with great zeal and energy. In 1889
the Bishop, with two Vincentian Fathers, gave a
mission throughout every part of the diocese, which
occupied ten months, and was attended with the
happiest results. In 1890 he established a new native
settlement at Beagle Bay under the care of the
Trappist Fathers.
Owing to the marvellous growth of the colony’s
population consequent upon the gold discoveries, a
new episcopal see was established in 1898 at Deraldton.
This extensive diocese which embraces the Murchison


goldfields has been placed under the charge of the
Right Rev. W. B. Kelly, who for many years was an
active priest at the Cathedral church at Perth. Dr.
Kelly is the second Australian-born priest raised to
the Episcopate and the first appointed to any
Australian See.
CHAPTER X.
NEW ZEALAND.
Xew Zealand, as stated in Chapter 1., was dis-
covered and named by Tasman in 1642. He anchored
in what he then named Massacre Bay (now known as
Golden Bay), where three of his crew were killed by
the Maoris in a most treacherous manner. The
latter then attempted to attack the ship, but a
discharge of cannon frightened them, and they re-
turned to the shore. After this collision with the
natives, Tasman coasted along the western shores of
the Xorth Island, giving to some of the more promin-
ent headlands the names they still bear.
Captain Cook surveyed the islands in 1770, and
sailed through the strait bearing his name, which
Tasman believed to be a bay. He also displayed the
British colours and took formal possession of the
islands at Mercury Bay in the Xorth Island, and at
Queen Charlotte Sound in the South Island for his
Majesty George 111. Cook first landed at Poverty
Bay, where unfortunately he came into conflict with
the natives. They took the ship to be a gigantic bird,,
the sails as its wings and the small boats as its un-
fledged little ones. Cook had more than one conflict
with the Maoris, forced upon him by their murderous
attacks upon his men at different times during his


stay on the coast. All his efforts to gain their
friendship were without avail. To the last, they
were aggressive and bloodthirsty. Some European
domestic animals were let loose in the bush by Cook.
These multiplied largely, especially the pig. Many
vegetable and root seeds were also left with some of
the tribes, by whom they were carefully cultivated for
a time, but at length allowed to degenerate.
French Expedition.— ln December 1769 soon
after Cook’s visit, the French navigator De Surville
in his ship St. Jean Baptiste , anchored at Monganui
in the North Island, and held friendly relations with
the natives till on their stealing a boat he burnt one
of their villages and carried off one of the chiefs. In
1772, two French ships, under the command of Captain
Du Fresne, sailed along the coast of the North Island,
and anchored in the Bay of Islands. He made friends
with the Maoris, and the most kindly feelings were
maintained for a month between the visitors and the
natives. On one occasion the captain and sixteen of his
officers went on a fishing excursion with the Maoris,
but they were never seen afterwards. The boat’s crew
sent ashore to look for them were all massacred but
one. Captain Crozet, the second in command, landed
a force to attack the natives, numbers of whom were
killed. He also burnt two Maori villages.
Cook’s visits to New Zealand in 1773 and 1774
were marked by more bloodshed between his men
and the Maoris, who were surprised on one occasion
feasting upon some of the sailors they had killed. The
great navigator visited New Zealand in 1777 during
his third voyage, which had for its object the finding
of a passage around the north of the American con-
tinent. On the whole Cook spent 327 days on the
New Zealand coasts.
Whaling*, Sealing*, and Native Rising’s.— After
the settlement of Port Jackson, in 1788, whaling and


sealing by American and English vessels became es-
tablished industries on the coast of New Zealand.
Friendly Maoris bartered pork and potatoes for knives
and blankets, tobacco, rum, and other articles. This
mutual trade begot better and more friendly relations
between the natives and their visitors for many years.
But this good understanding was not of long duration.
Hostilities were soon renewed, and kept up till 1871.
(Summarised, these were—The Boyd Massacre in 1809,
when about seventy men, women, and children were
put to death in revenge for flogging a Maori sailor;
the tribal wars of 1820; the Wairu Massacres of
1843, caused by Colonel Wakefield (brother of Edward
Gr. Wakefield), of South Australian settlement
notoriety, “ jumping ” the land of Rauparaka ; the
rising of Honi Heki in 1844, through a quarrel
with a whaler; the Taranaki War in 1859, arising
out of land taken from the Maoris; the Maori Wars
■of 1860 to 1863; the outbreak of Hau Hau in 1865,
inspired by fanaticism ; Te Kooti in 1868 to 1870.]
First Mission. —The Rev. Samuel Marsden, a
Church of England clergyman, of Sydney, formed a
mission in 1814 in the northern part of the North
Island. He was accompanied by three other clergy-
men—Messrs. Kendall, King, and Hall—their wives
and children, and some mechanics. For 12 axes they
bought 200 acres of land on the shore of the Bay of
Islands, where they set up a “ white flag with a cross
and dove.” Adjacent thereto they purchased 13,000
acres for 48 axes, and in a few years they w~ere in
possesion of 27 square miles of land at Hokianga and
the Bay of Isles. The Rev. Dr. Lang, writing of the
mission, describes it as “the most morally worthless”
on record.
In 1817, mainly through the representations of
Mr. Marsden, four magistrates (one Englishman and
three Maori chiefs) were appointed by Governor
Macquarie to exercise authority over British subjects


in New Zealand, but in connection with this matter
the Home Authorities were careful not to allow these
magistrates to interfere with the native inhabitants
or their territory.
In 1833 Mr. Busby was appointed British Resident
at Russell, in the Bay of Islands, where a settlement
had grown up from the visits of whaling vessels, and
where disturbances had been of frequent occurrence.
In 1839 the New Zealand Land Company, formed
in England by Edward Gibbon Wakefield (the origi-
nator of the South Australian colonising experiment),
sent out an expedition under his brother, Colonel
William Wakefield, to purchase land from the Maoris
and establish a settlement in New Zealand. A site
was chosen at Port Nicholson, and here the British
colours were hoisted only two days before Baron de
Therry, a Frenchman, arrived for the purpose of
taking possession of the land for France. In con-
nection with his land purchases, Colonel Wakefield
•got into trouble with the Maoris. Captain Hobson
.arrived from Sydney in 1840 with a proclamation
declaring New Zealand a dependency of New South
Wales and a commission appointing him Lieutenant-
Governor of the. islands. In this capacity he con-
cluded with the Maori chiefs the Treaty of Waitangl
(February 6th, 1840), whereby the whole territory
was transferred to the British Crown. Without delay
Hobson put a stop to all traffic in land with the natives,
and the New Zealand Land Company found themselves
in a dilemma. Thousands of people were arriving as fast
as ships could bring them to take up the land which
they had paid a pound an acre for in England to the
company But the company had no lawful title to any
land. The difficulty was referred by Governor Hobson
to Governor Gipps, in Sydney, who declared the
transaction of Wakefield with the Maoris irregular, but
said that if the latter were properly compensated for
their land, and twenty acres reserved for government


purposes, he would allow the company to occupy the
land they purchased at Port Nicholson. This offer
was gratefully accepted.
In 1841 New Zealand was established a separate
Colony quite apart from New South Wales, and
Hobson now became Governor of the territory (in-
stead of Lieutenant-Governor as heretofore). Tinder
Governors Fitzroy and Sir George Grey the colony
advanced. The latter employed numbers of Maoris,
at fair wages, in making roads into the interior, and
otherwise dealt fairly with the natives generally.
He paid them for their lands, opened schools for the-
education of their children, and supplied them with
farming implements to cultivate the land. He did
more. He hanged the white men who murdered them
wantonly.
In 1849 Wakefield established settlements in
Dunedin, in connection with the Free Church of
Scotland, and in 1857 he formed a settlement in
Canterbury, under the auspices of the Church of
England.
In 1853 a first instalment of constitutional govern-
ment was conferred on New Zealand, and in 185fi
full responsible government was introduced and
Wellington was established as the capital of the
islands in 1865.
Catholic. —Mr. Thomas Poynton, an Irishman,
was the first Catholic settler in New Zealand. He
arrived in Sydney in 1822, and went to Hokianga
in 1828. His wife made two voyages to Sydney, to
have her two children baptised by Father Therry.
In 1835 Mr. Poynton himself made a voyage to*
Sydney, in the hope of securing a priest for New
Zealand ; Dr. Polding had too few clergy in Sydney
to spare one. The good bishop gave Poynton some
books of instruction and devotion, to be distributed
amongst the Catholics, with a letter exhorting them


to be steadfast in the faith. Poynton made a
second voyage for the same purpose, but had to
return without the wished-for clergyman. On a third
visit he was cheered by the news told him by Dr.
Polding, that missionaries were on their way, and
might soon be with him.
First Bishop. —Dr. Pompallier, the first Catholic
Bishop, arrived at Hokianga in 1838. He had
letters from Dr. Polding and Archdeacon McEncroe
to the principal Catholic settlers there. The Wesleyan
and Church of England missionaries spared no pains
to destroy the Catholic mission. They excited the
natives by calumnies and misrepresentations, taken
from Fox’s u Book of Martyrs,” to rise against the
bishop. The missionaries told the natives that, if the
bishop remained, he would take their land from
them. A chief, with a number of Maoris in war
paint, came up to the Bishop’s house one morning.
They demanded of Mr. Poynton to deliver him up to
them ; otherwise there would be a general massacre.
Poynton pointed out to them that they were the
dupes of bad men, who were afraid or ashamed to
come themselves. After much parleying, the Maori
chief withdrew, on condition that Poynton would
accompany him to the headquarters of the Wesleyan
missionaries. He did so, and time was gained. The
bishop, by his kindness and manly bearing, won over
to his side the unfriendly Maoris. The Right Rev. Dr.
Polding, with Dr. Gregory, paid a short visit to the
mission at Kararika, in the Bay of Islands, in 1840.
They were received with joy by the Fathers of the
Marist congregation. They mixed freely with the
natives in order to show them that the calumny that
the Catholic religion was not the religion of Englishmen,
was unfounded. Up to 1850, when the Marist
Fathers left the diocese of Auckland, ten Maori
stations and missions had been established, having
over 5000 converts.


# I n 1848 New Zealand was divided into two-
dioceses—Auckland and Wellington. Bishop Pom-
pallier remained in charge of Auckland and Bishop*
Yiard of Wellington, which became the political
capital of New Zealand in 1865.
In 1850, on his return from a visit to Europe*
Bishop Pompallier brought with him from the
Convent of Mercy, Carlow, Mother Cecilia Maher
and seven sisters of that order. They were received
with great Joy in Auckland, where their teaching vras.
highly appreciated. In the first year the attendance
at their schools increased from 60 to 240 children.
The wars in which the Maoris were engaged in
1860 and for some years after brought ruin to their
missions about Auckland, which was a great blow to
the aged Bishop. The burden of governing the
diocese he at length felt was too much for him. In
1868 he sailed for Prance, and shortly after resigned.
He died in 1870.
The Bight Bev. Thomas William Croke suc-
ceeded Dr. Pompallier in 1870. During the four
years of his episcopate he freed the church from,
debt, infused new life and courage into the faithful,
added zealous priests to the ranks of the clergy, and
opened new schools for the nuns. He resigned the
see of Auckland in 1874, and was appointed Arch-
bishop of Cashel on his arrival in Ireland.
In 18/9 the Most Bev. Dr. Steins, of the Society
of Jesus, with four Benedictine fathers and one
Jesuit lay-brother arrived in Auckland. Coming
from Calcutta he was delighted with the climate of
Auckland, pleased with the flourishing condition of
religion and education, and edified by the devoted-
ness of the Irish missionary, thfe Yery Bev. Father
McDonald, who had given the best part of his life to*
the conversion of the Maoris. In 1881 Dr. Stein’s
health gave way from over-exertion. He resigned
the see and sailed for Sydney, where he was received


NEW ZEALAND
by the Jesuit Fathers with the utmost kindness. He
died 9th September that year, and was buried at
North Sydney, where a suitable monument has been
built over his grave.
The Right Rev. John Edmund Luck arrived
in Auckland in 1882 as successor to Dr. Steins.
Amongst other works to which he has strenuously
devoted himself, the enlargement and completion of
St. Patrick’s Cathedral is one of much importance.
Archdiocese of Wellington. —Dr. Yiard was
first Bishop of Wellington, and coadjutor of Auck-
land till 1860. He was a man of prayer all his life-
lifetime ; but he was a man of action also. In 1866
the good prelate had the joy of dedicating St. Mary’s
Cathedral (then completed), which is situated on a
hill overlooking the city. In 1868 Bishop Yiard
visited Rome, and was present at the Yatican Council.
He returned to Wellington in 1871, but it was
observed that he did not enjoy his usual health. In
May, 1872, he was stricken with dropsy of the heart,
and he passed away early in the following month. The
“general deep sorrow that hung over the people,” as
the Wellington Independent said, betokened real grief.
In 1874 the Most Rev. Francis Redwood was
appointed to the see of Wellington, which in 1885
was raised to an archbishopric. The special works
of His Grace in Wellington have been the building
of St. Patrick’s College, for the higher education of
young men, and of St. Mary’s Convent of Mercy, while
his fame as a preacher has spread over the whole of
Australasia.
Diocese of Christchurch. —The Right Rev.
John J. Grimes, of the Society of Mary, was the first
bishop of the new diocese, which embraces Westland,
and Canterbury, and has a population of about
25,000 Catholics.
Diocese of Dunedin. —In 1840 Bishop Pompallier


celebrated Mass in Otago, and remained ten days
instructing the natives. The Right Rev. Patrick Moran
was appointed first Bishop of Dunedin in 1871.
Accompanying him were ten nuns of the Dominican
Order, and the Rev. William Coleman. The Bishop
was much discouraged on finding the “ diocese almost
destitute of the necessaries of divine worship, such g£s
altars, vestments, chalice, and other suitable altar
ornaments, &c.” Dr. Moran at once issued a
pastoral letter, appealing to the people to raise monev
for three objects, viz. :— cc Ist, to establish a nuns’
school in Dunedin; 2nd, to pay the travelling
expenses from Europe of a sufficient number of
missionaries; 3rd, to provide decent and suitable
requisites for the due celebration of the adorable
sacrifice of the Mass.” The people promptly responded
to this appeal, and provided the necessary funds for the
needs of the diocese. In the course of sixteen years
the Cathedral of St. Joseph was finished, twenty-five
new churches erected, seventeen schools established,
one college founded, besides which residences were
provided for the clergy and for the religious of four
convents, and the number of priests was increased
ninefold. The amount expended in these works was
over £BO,OOO.
The Rev. Monsignor Coleman, who had been Vicar-
General of the diocese for a long time, and “the
bishop’s stay and faithful counsellor for many years,”
died in 1890. Many tributes were paid to his
memory by Dr. Moran and the press of Dunedin.
The Right Rev. Dr. Moran died in June, 1895.
During his career in Dunedin he wrought a great
change in the spiritual life of the diocese, which was
realised by his own flock and admitted by the public
generally. The Right Rev. Dr. Verdon was chosen
by the Holy See as second Bishop of Dunedin, and
was consecrated in his own beautiful cathedral by the
Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney, in May, 1896.


Since then his Lordship has taken up the adminis-
tration of the diocese with an earnestness that gives
promise of the happiest results as far as religion is
concerned.
The Catholic population of New Zealand in 1891
was 87,272.
THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES.
Like the indigenous lower animals and vegetable
productions of Australia, the native man is fast dis-
appearing. The aboriginal population of New South
Wales at the time of its settlement in 1788 was about
one million. In the census of 1871 it was 503,981 —a
decrease of about 51 per cent. In 1891 the numbers
had fallen to 8280, an enormous decrease. The black
population of the continent in 1848 was estimated at
3.000. Official statistics set it down in 1891 at
200.000. At this rate of decrease it is only a question
of time when the aborigines of the mainland of
Australia will become extinct like those of Tasmania.
Whence Australia was first peopled and by what
race of mankind is still matter for doubt or con-
jecture. Ethnologists are divided in opinion as to
whether the aborigines of Australia belong to the
Negrito or Papuan family. The evidence in support of
their Negrito origin, however, appears to be the
stronger.
The blacks of Australia have been underrated,
according to Mr. Gideon S. Lang and others wffiose
ample opportunities for studying their character qualify
them to speak, and add weight to their opinions.
Governors Phillip and Hunter formed a high opinion
of them, which was shared by many explorers, from
Eyre to Burke, who have often borne testimony to
their many good qualities of head and heart. To


rank them little better than brutes, and somewhat
above the gorilla, as some writers and travellers have
done, savours of ignorance or prejudice. They are a
conquered race, despised and disparaged—contemned
and calumniated by those who wished to justify or
palliate the inhumanity shown in the early days towards
them. They possess intelligence and other qualities
which go to show that they are not so low in the scale
of humanity as they are represented. Fifty or sixty
years ago numbers of them were employed in the
whaling and sealing vessels sent out from Sydney,
and they proved themselves good sailors. Many
gentlemen about that time manned their yachts
with blacks—and capital hands they were. They
are good troopers, and in hunting criminals they
are unequalled. “No one,” says Mr. Lang, “ seeing
the natives merely as idle, wandering vagabonds
among the white men can judge as to what they are
in their natural state. In their subtlety as diplo-
matists, and their skill and activity in war and in the
chase, I consider them quite equal to the American
Indians. The great weir for catching fish on the
Upper Darling, and another described by Morrill,
the shipwrecked mariner, who passed so many years
amongst them, prove that they are capable of con-
structing works upon a large scale and requiring
combined action. Everything they have to do they
do in the very best manner, and for every contingency
that arises they devise a simple remedy.”
They have the same laws throughout the whole
continent, and the government is administered by
elderly men. Every tribe is confined to its own
district, the boundary of which must not be crossed
except at the risk of death.
Some who have written on the subject of their
religion are of opinion that the aborigines know
nothing of God—indeed, that they are atheists.
Others declare that they are strongly impressed with


the idea of a Maker and Ruler of the world, who
made the sun, the trees, and the kangaroo. Bishop
Salvado, the Rev. W. Ridley, Canon Gunther, and
other clergymen, as well as Count Strzlecki, all assert
that the blacks believe in two religious principles—
the author of good and the author of evil. There is
no doubt of their belief in imaginary beings, to some
of whom they attribute good, and to an evil spirit
called “ Wondon” they attribute all their misfortunes,
as well as storms, floods, lightning, whirlwinds, and
hail. They believe in the transmigration of souls, and
that white people are their dead ancestors returned
to life.
What has been done to compensate the aborigines
for the loss of their country, for the deprivation of
their hunting field and fishing grounds ] Alas, very
little. A few camps dedicated to them, and an
annual dole of clothing. Under the convenient but
pharasaical plea of the “ rights of conquest,” the
wrong-doing is attempted to be condoned, and the
atrocities inflicted sought to be justified. The laws
of morality and religion demanded more Christian
treatment in their behalf. Governor Phillip was as
kind to them as circumstances permitted, but there
was no organisation to succour them when their
means of procuring a livelihood were taken from
them, or to protect them against the violence of the
whites. Governor Macquarie established a settlement
at Blacktown (near Richmond, N.S.W.) for those living
in that district, and a branch settlement was estab-
lished at Castle Hill, near Parramatta. Both were
under Messrs. Tyerman and Bennett, of the London
Missionary Society. After the departure of the
Governor, the institutions were closed. Lord John
Russell, when Secretary for the Colonies, in 1841,
urged upon Governor Gipps to set apart fifteen per
cent, of the “ land fund ” for the civilisation and
protection of the aborigines. The reply given to the


despatch was, that it would be vain to attempt to
change the habits and customs of those savages.
Governor Gipps was further urged by Lord Stanley,
in 1845, by a despatch, to enlist co-operation amongst
the colonists for the civil and religious advancement
of the aborigines. A society was formed in Sydney
to consider Lord Stanley’s despatch. The members
of it came to the conclusion “ that no plans, no
systems, availed to ameliorate the condition of the
Australians.”
The Churches, including the Catholic, Church of
England, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan, made many
efforts in the different colonies to instruct and civilise
the blacks. Archdeacon Broughton, afterwards
Bishop of Sydney, established a mission at Wellington,
which was for a time successful. The London
Missionary Society formed missions at Lake Mac-
quarie, near Newcastle. The settlements at Blacktown
and Castle Hill, already referred to, were in charge of
members of the same society.
In 1843 Archbishop Folding, on his return from
Europe, brought with him four priests of the Passionist
Order, who established a mission for the blacks at
Stradbroke Island, Moreton Bay, where they laboured
for three years.
In 1866 a community of Benedictine Monks, under
the Right Rev. Dr. Salvado, 0.5.8., founded a settle-
ment for the aborigines in New Norcia, Western
Australia, where some of the men are taught to
cultivate the soil, and others instructed in various
trades. The females are taught to knit and cook.
Miss Nightingale, of Crimean fame, after her voyage
to Australia, said of the institution : —“ In no part
of this world have they succeeded in educating and
civilising the savage races except in the Benedictine
Monastery of New Norcia ,” while Sir F. Napier
Broome, Governor of Western Australia, expressed
himself as “ filled with admiration at the good work of


the mission among the Aborigines collected on the
station, and at the industry and success displayed on
the extensive farms. 55 The members of the Society
of Jesus, under Father A. Strele, began a mission in
1882 at the wish of His Holiness Leo XIII. to the
blacks of the Northern Territory. The settlement is
on the Daly Hiver, where a large grant of land was
given by the Government of South Australia for the
missions. Father Strele speaks hopefully of the
missionary established by him, and says
“ that the blacks in the northern parts of Australia
are well suited for learning agriculture and the
various mechanical arts. 55
The Rev. Dr. MeNab instructed and baptised
many of the blacks in Port Mackay, in Queensland.
The Rurragorang Mission, founded by the
Father Dillon, formerly of Balmain (N.S.W.), is still
fulfilling all the objects of its founder.
Dr. Lang established missions at Moreton Bay,
which were dissolved after some years.
The Wesleyan Church established a mission in the
Port Phillip district (now Victoria) which had well-
devised plans for its success, yet failed.
In 1890 His Lordship Dr. Gibney secured a large
tract of land from the Government at Beagle Bay,
Western Australia, for a native settlement It is under
the Order of La Trappe, whose self-denying labours
are producing the happiest results among the abori-
gines. The Mission is now (1898) in a flourishing
condition, and Father Ambroso, the Abbott, says they
are beginning to reap in joy what they sowed in tears.
