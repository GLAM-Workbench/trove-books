HYMN 11.
O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone.
The peace, the joy I sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me,
There’s love, and life, and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.
I sighed for rest and happiness,
I yearned for them, not Thee ;
But while I passed my Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.
Now none but Christ, &c.,
I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But ah ! the waters failed !
E’en as I stooped to drink they’d fled,
And mock’d me as I wailed.
Now none but Christ, &c.,
The pleasures lost I sadly mourn’d,
But never wept for Thee,
Till grace the sightless eyes received,
Thy loveliness to see.
Now none but Christ, &c.

HYMN 111.
{By the Choir.)
What is like a living germ,
Garnered from a sacred mine,
Token of a Father’s pity,
Guide to His eternal city P
It is love, it is love, it is love, love divine.
Choeus—
Love divine, so pure and free,
Gift from God above :
Star of glory, beaming o’er me,
’Tis the Saviour’s love.
Star of glory, beaming o’er me,
'Tis the Saviour’s lore.
What is that which ever lives
To redeem this soul of mine ;
Speaks of life that is immortal.
Just beyond the silent portal ?
It is love, &c.
What will bring me home at last,
In my Father’s courts to shine ;
Since my soul its grace receiving,
Looks on high, in faith believing P
It is love, Ac.

HYMN IY.
{By the Choir.)
’Twill not be long—our journey here :
Each broken sigb and falling tear
Will soon be gone ; and all will be
A cloudless sky, a waveless sea.
Eefeain —Soil on, dark stream ! we dread not tby foam ;
The Pilgrim is longing for Home, sweet Home.
’Twill not be long ! the yearning heart
May feel its ev’ry hope depart,
And grief be mingled with its song ;
We’ll meet again,—’twill not be long !
Eefbain.
Tho’ sad we mark the closing eye
Of those we loved in days gone by,
Yet sweet in death their latest song ;
“ Well meet again,—’twill not be long !”
Eefbain.
These chequer’d wilds, with thorns o’erspread,
Thro’ which our way so soft is led—
This march of time, if faith be strong,
Will end in bliss : ’twill not be long !
Eefbain.
ADDRESS.
HYMN Y.
{By the Choir.)
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight thro’ darkness and shadow is breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fulness of glory,
To receive from the world “ His own.”
Chobus — O, Lord Jesus, how long ?
How long ere we shout the glad song P
Christ returneth, Halelujah-' halelujah!
Amen, Halelujah! Amen.
It may be at mid-day, it may be at twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives “ His own.”
Chorus.
While hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,
With glorified saints and the angels attending,
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,
Will Jesus receive “ His own.”
Chorus.
Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go without dying ;
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying ;
Caught up thro’ the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives “ His own.”
Chorus.
ADDRESS.


HYMN YI,
(B y the Choir.)
When peace, like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows, like sea billows, roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught mo to know,
“ It is well, it is well with my soul.”
Chobxts —It is well, it is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
Tho’ Satan should buffet, tho’ trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.
Chorus.
My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—
My sin—not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His cross ; and I bear it no more :
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
Ch orus.
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to lire !
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
Chorus,
But Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming, we wait;
The sky, not the grave, is our goal :
Oh, trump of the Angel! oh, voice of the Lord P
Blessed hope ! blessed rest of my soul!
Chorus.
ADDRESS.
HYMN VII.
(By the Congregation.)
Praise ye Jehovah, praise the Lord most holy,
Who cheers the contrite, girds with strength the weak ;
Praise him who will with glory crown the lowly,
And with salvation beautify the meek.
Praise ye the Lord, for all His loving kindness,
And all the tender mercy He hath shown ;
Praise Him who prrdons all our sins and blindness,
And calls us sons, and takes us for His own.
Praise ye Jehovah! source of every blessing,—
Before His gifts earth’s richest boons are dim ;
Besting in him, His peace and joy possessing,
All things are ours, for we have all in Him.
Praise ye the Father ! God the Lord who gave us,
With full and perfect love, His only Son ;
Praise ye the Son who died Himself to save us !
Praise ye the Spirit ! praise the Three in one
