INTRODUCING BILLY BEAR
I AM sure that Billy Bear needs no introduction to the
many thousands of Victorian school children who have
enjoyed following him month by month in The School
Paper as he travelled round the world. All will be glad
to have in one book the three journeys of this friendly
globe-trotter, and it is hoped that through this book
children in other States will also get to know him and to
love him.
As you turn these pages you will find that colour and
clothes and houses and food of people change very much as
Billy passes from one country to another. But everywhere
Billy meets kindly smiling faces, and as you go with him
you will learn that people are really very much the same
the world over.
You can notice a strong family resemblance between
Billy and our lovable little bears, the koalas. The artist
who drew Billy and the authors who wrote his jingles
heard that the schools of Victoria were planning to grow
young gum-trees, just the sort that the koalas love to
eat, and to send them to Phillip Island, where there are not
enough food trees for the bears. So they have offered to
give their share of the book, one penny a copy, to the
Education Department of Victoria to help to pay the
cost of sending the trees to the Island. Billy hopes that
in this way he will make a lot of money to help his
family. We all hope he does.

Director of Education,
Melbourne.

Map of Billy’s Third Journey 39


I. GOOD-BYE TO AUSTRALIA
1. “Good-bye, my friends,” <
trip). “I want to see the whole
Billy Bear (he’s going to take a
i world. I’ll see you at the ship.”
says J
; wide
2. “A pleasant journey, Billy,”
say the shorn and woolly sheep.
“The children over-seas beneath
our woolly blankets sleep.”
3. Bill visits next his farmer-
friend, and rides upon the reaper.
This wheat feeds folk in other
lands and helps to make bread
cheaper.
4. All Billy’s friends, to see him off, have gathered on the pier.
They throw him streamers while they shout, “Good-bye, until next
year!”


11. WE CALL AT NEW GUINEA
1. These natives paddle Billy up a river in a boat. And Billy
thinks he should have worn a thinner summer coat.
2. This chief lives in a village
that Bill comes upon by chance.
He wears this “hat” of feathers
when he’s dressed up for a dance.
3. To get some coconuts to eat
the native boys climb trees. Bill
thought he could climb quickly;
but he’s left behind, he sees.
4. Far inland then goes Billy,
carried by an airman bold. He
sees a dredge below him, on a
river, getting gold.
5. Bill meets the birds of para-
dise that every colour wear. But
soon he sails for China; you can
see him going there.
summer coat.


! 1 ‘ Wj
j \ f «<*N
111. IN CHINA
1. Upon this river Billy sees small boats known as sampans. The
larger ones are Chinese junks; their sails are spread like fans.
2. Bill helps his farmer-friend
in flooded fields to plant the rice.
Though Bill is slow his friend
can set the plants out in a trice.
3. Bill’s friends use chop-
sticks, and their meal of rice is
quickly done. Bill can’t get on at
all, poor chap! He’s simply get-
ting none.
4. “Two thousand years ago,”
says Bill, “this Chinese Wall was
made. It s just as long as is the
fine from Perth to Adelaide.”
5. Bill takes a ricksha ride
along this busy Chinese street.
Shop signs hang out, and porters
hurry by on slippered feet.


IV. IN JAPAN
1. Japan has many factory towns, like those found in the West;
but Bill likes Eastern temples and tall Fujiyama best.
2. In cherry-blossom time the
people hold the Feast of Flowers.
Beside this dainty lake Bill whiles
away the sunny hours.
3. Bill watches while this artist
paints a picture, and it seems
as though a few strokes of the
brush make mountains, trees, and
streams.
4. A little friend asks Billy to
her house to take some tea.
“Your tea,” says Bill, “is beauti-
ful. You’re very good to me.”
5. The Feast of Dolls is held
each year, and then, so Bill is
told, the family dolls are all
brought out. Some dolls are very
old.


I
V. IN CANADA
1. For salmon going up the
stream the waterfall is steep. “It
doesn’t stop this chap,” thinks
Bill; “he takes it in one leap.”
2. An Indian chief lets Billy
try these plumes upon his head.
Each feather stands for one brave
deed—that’s what the chieftain
said.
3. Across these Lakes from Canada lies the United States. One
wheat-ship loads beside a silo while another waits.
4. The sugary maple sap is
caught in cans. Don’t think Bill
silly because he’s taken down one
can, and now fills up a Billy.
5. The lumbermen were float-
ing logs down-stream towards the
mill, when all at once they piled
and stuck. Don’t worry; here
comes Bill!


VI. AMONG THE ESKIMOS
1. In Greenland Billy finds it
cold; he hopes his fur will grow.
The little sealskin boat is paddled
by an Eskimo.
2. A little friend shows Billy
Bear how fast his dogs can go.
The dogs are harnessed to a
sledge and dash across the snow.
3. Some Eskimos build huts of snow; they call these homes igloos
Bill’s friend is trying hard to teach him how to use snow-shoes.
4. A seal is coming up to
breathe. Bill’s hunter - friend
wants meat. The seal will give
him clothes and oil, as well as
food to eat.
5. Like fiery curtains in the
sky Bill sees the Northern Lights,
which gleam upon the ice in
Greenland’s long, long winter
nights.

VII. THE UNITED STATES
1. Billy Bear in New
York town finds all the
people busy. The build-
ings towering to the sky
make little Billy dizzy.
4. In Hollywood he meets two friends
—do you know who they are? Our Billy
thinks it would be fun to be a movie star.


VIII. MEXICO, CENTRAL
AMERICA.
AND THE WEST INDIES
1. See Billy with a Mexican
(he’s called a caballero). Bill also
learns the cactus plant grows in
those parts —oh, dear, oh!
2. From Pacific to Atlantic
shore, past lakes and streams and
rocks, his ship sails on the great
canal and passes through the
locks.
3. In Jamaica’s sugar fields
the negroes cut the crop; and
Billy thinks each piece of cane’s
a lovely lolly shop.
4. In Barbados, where trade
winds blow, these whirling mills
are found. They squeeze the
sweet juice from the cane as they
go round and round.
5. Then to the isle of Trini-
dad we find our Billy going. He
helps the negroes gather pods on
cocoa bushes growing.
6. He watches while they dry
the beans and take them to the
boat; then thinks, “This place is
far too hot for me and my fur
coat.”


IX. BRAZIL AND THE ARGENTINE
1. Along the mighty Amazon, Bill sees these stilt-like huts; and
while the natives spear some fish, he tastes Brazilian nuts.
2. Brazil’s a land of coffee-
beans—two in each berry grow.
The pickers pull them from the
trees and dry them in a row.
3. The rubber tree, with milk-
white sap, was in Brazil first
found. The natives make a rub-
ber ball on sticks twirled round
and round.
4. Then south Bill goes to
cooler climes, the Argentine’s
cattle plains. Good-bye to jungle,
good-bye to heat, good-bye to
daily rains.
5. While some keep watch
upon the herd the cowboys’
camp-fires burn. Bill joins them
in their songs, and then as watch-
man takes his turn.


A __
X. SOUTH AMERICA,
NAURU.
AND HOME AGAIN
1. Here’s Billy with some
Gaucho riders—clever horsemen
they, who whirl the bolas round
and round and hurl them at the
prey.
2. Un Titicaca in the Andes,
high up in mountain dales, the
boats are made of woven reeds,
with matting for the sails.
3. Bill watches while an In-
dian friend spins wool on sum-
mer days. The wool comes from
alpacas, which on mountain pas-
tures graze.
4. Next Billy loads the llamas;
each carries two bags full of
quinoa seeds, potatoes, and warm
alpaca wool.
5. Then west to Nauru isle he
sails —it’s perched on the equator.
He sees how ships load phosphate
rock, and hopes to come back
later.
6. “Back home for Christ-
mas !’’ Billy says. Once more in
gum-tree rocking, he hopes that
dear old Santa Claus won’t fail
to see his stocking.

Follow the Journey made by
Billy
He thinks of the little friends he has made
in other lands.
Can you name the lands these
children belong to?
MAP OF BILLY'S FIRST JOURNEY


I. THROUGH
INLAND AUSTRALIA
1. A teamster talks to Billy
by his 40 horse-power truck. He’d
rather have his donkeys, for they
never get him stuck.
2. The cattle-men see little
rain, but if deep down they sink
a bore the water gushes up, and
then their beasts may drink.
3. From lonely cattle stations
where there’s someone very sick,
these nurses get a wireless call,
“Please send the doctor quick.”
4. The doctor flies an aero-
plane. (This time Bill goes
along.) They take the man to
hospital, and soon he’s well and
strong.
5. Beside a northern river
Billy warns this buffalo, “The
crocodile will get you if you don’t
make haste and go.”
6. A native shows Bill how to
fish by using his long spear. And
now Bill’s in this aeroplane—he’ll
be away a year.


11. IN JAVA
1. Quite near a big volcano, and among the fruitful trees, is a little
Javan village, where Bill meets two Javanese.
2. Then to the terraced rice-
fields Billy climbs above the plain.
Some fields are being planted
while the rest are yielding grain.
3. And close beside a flooded
field here’s Billy sitting now. “I’d
rather drive a boat,” he thinks,
“than buffalo and plough.”
4. To send this ferry o’er the
stream, the men pull on the
ropes. The bamboo raft is strong
enough to bear them all, Bill
hopes.
5. You don’t see much of
Billy now—a paw, some fur, a
smile. He’ll soon be buried if
they tip more kapok on the


Ml. IN BURMA
1. A lovely Buddhist temple
is the first thing Billy spies. The
Burmese worship Buddha, who
was very kind and wise.
2. These fashions back in Mel-
bourne, Billy thinks, would cause
a stir; but round his neck he’d
rather wear some good Australian
fur.
3. To get the good rice from
the husks the natives grind and
grind, then toss it up so that the
wind leaves only grain behind.
4. Men, carts, and oxen carry
rice (Bill carries lots inside).
And now he sees it borne in boats
on Irrawaddy’s tide.
5. The logs of teak from Bur-
ma’s woods are heavy, stout, and
long. “This elephant can stack
them up,” gasps Bill. “He must
be strong!”
6. When Burmese want some
fun they love to see a puppet
show. The puppets work on
strings; you see them hanging in
a row.


IV. IN INDIA
1. Beneath Himalayas’ snowy
peaks the tea plantations lie. Bill
sees the young leaves being picked
before they’re spread to dry.
2. Two oxen draw this cotton
load upon the hot Deccan. Bill
finds it cooler up above than
walking with the man.
3. An Indian prince’s palace is
the next thing Billy sees. The
royal elephants are huge; Bill
reaches to their knees.
3. “Oh, what a difference!’’
Billy says, as down the street he
struts. “Yes,” says his friend,
“the poorer folk have only these
mud huts.”
5. “Oh, snakes alive!” says
Billy, and he turns a little pale.
The charmer pipes; the cobra
almost stands upon its tail.
6. In jars the women carry
home the water that they drink.
Bill’s thirsty, but the open well
has made him stop and think.


V. IN TIBET
1. A fortress guards this mountain pass which leads to high Tibet.
The sturdy yaks with burdens were the first things Billy met. The
owners had been buying food upon the Indian plain, because Tibet is
lar too cold to grow sufficient grain.
2. In honour of Tibetan gods
the monks sometimes hold feasts.
The dancers wearing “devil”
masks are lamas—that is, priests.
3. Bill’s friends wear sheep-
skin clothing, for they live
amongst the snow. Bill looks
upon their village in a valley far
below.
4. This woman weaves her
cloth from thread that’s made of
strong yak hair. “It’s good, per-
haps, for tents,” thinks Bill, “but
rather rough to wear.”
5. Bill likes the wanner
weather, when they live in tents,
the best. The herdsman’s queer
old gun is fitted with a two-
pronged rest.


=7*'*—->
VI. IN IRAN
1. Here’s Billy near a small town in the country called Iran. (He
thinks the little donkey should be carried by the man!) Above the
town there rises up a mosque’s big rounded dome. The woman
walking wears a veil when she’s away from home.
2. These men are weaving
carpets that are prized in every
land. They sit upon a stage and
do the weaving all by hand.
3. “I’ve seen men smoke
cigars,” thinks Bill, “and even
pipes of clay. But this man draws
his smoke through water in a
narghile.”
4. These women making but-
ter take some goat’s cream, Billy
learns; and then they swish it
back and forth in swinging goat-
skin churns.
5. Beneath the ground in
warm Iran, rich oil deposits lie.
To find the oil with boring plants
the hopeful searchers try.


L ]
&isS* '" '
r>
VII. IN PALESTINE
1. These little flat - roofed
houses from their lofty hill look
down. With jars upon their
heads, the women walk from well
to town.
2. Though many farmers own
machines and look on this with
scorn, the poorer country-folk
still use the ox to tread the corn.
3. The grape juice from this
ancient press will soon be turned
to wine. The heat has parched
poor Billy’s throat; he thinks the
fresh grapes fine.
4. The farmers pack their
oranges, for Europe gets the best.
Bill gurgles, through his orange
juice, “Here’s one that won’t go
west!”
5. The potter at his old-time
wheel is making jars of clay.
“Two thousand years ago,” thinks
Bill, “they used this self-same
way.”
6. This place for summer holi-
days is by an inland sea. Bill
takes a “header” from the board;
the children shout with glee.

IX. IN NORTHERN AFRICA
1. Among the dreary sand-hills and the desert’s barren spaces.
Bill travels in this camel train to visit an oasis. Two Arab robbers
have their camp upon this dune (or hill). One aims at Billy’s
caravan; we hope he won’t shoot Bill.
2. The lady leaves her shelter
now because the trip is done. Bill
wears an Arab head-cloth to pro-
tect him from the sun.
3. He drinks some water
thirstily, then lounges in the
shade. The water’s more to Billy
than the best of lemonade.
4. To climb the palm and
reach the dates, this Arab needs
a rope. Says Bill: “My claws
are good enough to get me some,
I hope.”
5. Through hot Algiers, by
winding streets, Bill goes up steps
and down. A Negro and an Arab
friend are showing him the town.


jjj
X. IN WESTERN AFRICA
1. First to the Gold Coast
Billy comes, where cocoa-trees
are grown. The pods are opened
and the beans spread in the sun,
as shown.
2. Bill sends a message by this
boy so busy at his drumming. It
tells the natives farther south to
watch for Billy’s coming.
3. Two natives take Bill down
a stream in their dug-out canoe.
The swinging bridge is made of
woven grass and creepers too.
4. Bill watches closely while
he’s showm how ivory carving’s
done. The woman w’ears a wide-
brimmed hat to save her from the
sun.
5. This native man is netting
fish; Bill watches how he fares.
“Fish may be food for men,”
thinks Bill; “they’re not much
good for bears.”
6. Deep in the Congo forest
Billy finds the Pygmy folk. They
show him how to use a bow.
Bill’s guide enjoys the joke.


“'S — — —

BILLY’S SECOND JOURNEY
XI. IN
SOUTH
AFRICA
1. Through Durban streets
Bill’s ricksha flies, while Bill
enjoys the ride. The “horse,” a
Zulu runner, now is fairly in his
stride.
2. Then Billy sees a mine,
with buildings towering up on
high. To get the rich gold under-
ground the native workers try.
3. South to a fruit farm Billy
goes, and likes it very' much. The
owner proudly tells Bill that his
house is “early Dutch.”
4. Bill has some Kaffir friends,
and journeys to their kraal to
stay. The children drive the
cattle in each night and out each
day.
5. Bill and his little white
friend run their “Cup” at flying
pace. The ostrich with the longer
neck no doubt will win the race.
6. Now Billy’s trip is ended;
off he goes by aeroplane. He
hopes some day to see Cape Town
and Table Mount again.

I. IN
GREECE
1. The guide and Bill have
climbed the hill from Athens,
down below, to see this temple
built by Greeks two thousand
years ago.
2. This man took Billy fishing
in his gaily painted boat. Bill
shows his biggest “catch” when
once again in port they float.
3. These country women bake
their bread in ovens out of doors.
If Billy goes much closer he’ll
get cinders in his paws.
4. The farmer and his family
have a hard day’s work to do.
They’ve been so kind to Billy that
he’s going to help them, too.
5. The wives of farmers spin
and weave the clothes their
children wear. This woman
spinning doesn’t mind Bill’s
interested stare.
6. Among the Spartan moun-
tains Billy stands upon this rock.
The herdsman is surrounded by
the goats that form his flock.


11. IN ITALY
1. The Colosseum built in
Rome two thousand years ago is
now in ruins. Billy views the
great walls from below.
2. In sunny southern vine-
yards grapes are picked for
making wine. Bill takes a bunch
and tastes a grape; he thinks the
flavour fine.
3. A sturdy helper, Billy,
when it comes to climbing trees!
He picks the olives with his paws,
and holds on with his knees.
4. A noisy market in the
street fills Billy with surprise,
and, at the sight of so much fruit,
wide open pop his eyes.
5. “A merchant here must
also be,” says Bill, “a gondolier.
The streets of Venice are canals.”
Bill finds it nice—but queer.
6. “This place —Sorrento did
you say?” asks Bill. “I see.
Thank you. We have one in
Victoria —it’s at the sea-side, too.”


-.max
y f w — ~
111. IN SPAIN
1. It’s very thirsty weather in
this village on the hill. The milk-
maid stops her goat and fills a
cup with milk for Bill.
2. Beside the stream that
ripples through the valley down
below, Bill sees the village
women make their washing white
as snow.
3. Beneath his house this
farmer keeps his beasts and tools
and carts. One cart amuses Billy,
and he looks at all its parts.
4. Now Billy’s in the kitchen
talking with the farmer’s
daughter. The big black jars, our
Billy sees, are used for storing
water.
5. In vain our Billy tries to
watch the dancer’s flying feet.
They go too fast. He finds the
dance and music quite a treat.
6. This lovely castle on its
rock towers high above the plain.
It was the Moors who built it,
when they ruled in ancient Spain.


IV. IN FRANCE
1. The silkworms feed on mul-
berry leaves till their cocoons are
spun; and then an oven kills the
grubs after the spinning’s done.
2. Bill whistles as he walks
along, and farm carts past him
jog. The cart in front is drawn
behind a donkey and a dog.
3. Bill sees these girls with
wide hats in a city in Alsace. The
tall church spires look down upon
the crowded market-place.
4. An old, old castle stands
outside a field of sugar-beet. Bill
tastes some grapes fresh from the
vines and finds them very sweet.
5. Bill helps to feed the fowls,
and also ducks upon the pond.
The farmer’s wife is washing in
a stone trough just beyond.
6. In Paris streets the people
find these chairs and tables set.
Bill has to meet two friends for
lunch; he hasn’t got there yet.


V. IN SWITZERLAND
1. It’s summer on this high
Swiss alp when Billy gets there
first. He blows the horn to call
the cows; his cheeks look fit to
burst.
2. In alpine huts the herdsmen
make their big flat rounds of
cheese, then take them to their
farms below, before the winter
“freeze.”
3. Some Swiss friends then
take Billy climbing on a steep
rock slope. The guide goes first,
the others follow, tied upon a
rope.
4. In winter-time some herds-
men work at making wooden
toys; and visitors will buy them
for their little girls and boys.
5. One day when Billy’s
friends have gone among the
peaks to climb, he visits two
watch-makers; they have lots and
lots of time.
6. At last, one day, Bill tells
his friends that he would like to
take a trip to see the Nations’
Palace by Geneva’s lake.


VI. IN ENGLAND AND WALES
1. At Liverpool Bill sees some
ships unloading at the docks.
They carry wool and frozen
mutton from Australian flocks.
2. These girls of Lancashire
wear clogs. Bill saw them when
he paid a visit to a factory where
cotton goods are made.
3. While walking south Bill
takes a seat, and rests his weary
feet. He finds it very restful in
this little village street.
4. In Kent the hop-vines, tall
and green, are trained on poles
to climb; and people come for
miles to pick the hops at harvest-
time.
5. When visiting a town upon
the east coast Billy meets a fisher-
man. One day he goes out with
the fishing fleets.
6. Then westward into Wales
Bill goes, and spends some
wondrous hours. He sees the
old-time dresses and Harlech
Castle’s towers.


VII. IN
SCOTLAND
AND IRELAND
1. In Scotland Billy goes to
see the shipyards of the Clyde.
There mighty ships are being
built along the riverside.
2. He also sees the Scottish
Games at Braemar in the High-
lands. The dancers come from
every part of Scotland and its
islands.
3. Among the hills Bill meets
this shepherd wearing kilt and
plaid. The sheep dog is a friendly
chap; Bill finds his name is Lad.
4. In Ireland Billy finds these
men are busy digging peat. The
peat is dried, then used for fires.
It gives a lovely heat.
5. Then Billy sees a farm
where flax for making linen
grows. They soak the flax in
ponds by placing stones on it in
rows.
6. Through Ireland’s lovely
countryside Bill travels far and
wide. You see him in a jaunting
car. The seats are at the side.


VIII. IN HOLLAND
1. “Your little homes,” says
Billy, “seem much lower than
the sea.” The girl says, “Yes,
but then the sea-walls keep us
safe, you see.”
2. In spring-time Billy travels
to a farm where tulips grow. The
farmer shows him fields where
bulbs are blooming row on row.
3. This farmer in the open
field to milk his cows sits down.
Bill pats the dog that pulls the
little milk-cart to the town.
4. Bill thinks he sees a lot of
balls, and picks up one to play.
He finds it is a round Dutch
cheese, for sale on market day.
5. Bill looks across the flat
Dutch fields. He can’t see any
hills. But on the banks of this
canal are many pumping mills.
6. In icy winter this canal is
busy as a street. Bill hopes it
won’t take long to learn to skate
upon his feet.


IX. IN GERMANY
1. Through Germany Bill
wanders, with his pack upon his
back. He sees this mountain
castle when he stops beside the
track.
2. One holiday he meets these
children walking through a
wood. He tries to sing their
marching songs and finds the
music good.
3. Bill finds himself among
these vines above the River
Rhine. The people here are
picking grapes to make them into
wine.
4. These girls are working on
a farm where flax for linen
grows. The flax is tied in bundles,
and the bundles stand in rows.
5. Before these high-roofed
houses oxen pull a load of hay.
Bill sees them in Bavaria one
lovely summer’s day.
6. Bill thinks this mountain
winter is the best time of the year.
But will he think so if a snow-
ball hits him on the ear?


X. IN
NORWAY
AND SWEDEN
1. The logs upon the ice will
float in summer down the waters.
Skate-sailing is a winter sport
with Sweden’s sons and
daughters.
2. These Lapps begin their
summer home on Sweden’s
northern edge. The reindeer
gives them meat and milk and
clothes, and pulls the sledge.
3. Beside this fiord in Norway
Billy sees a little farm. In stormy
times the mountain walls will
keep it safe from harm.
4. In summer-time the salmon
come into the narrow fiord. A
large supply of fish is caught in
nets and, later, stored.
5. In summer to this saeter
Billy goes to stay with friends.
They bring the cows down to the
farm as soon as summer ends.
6. The hay is cut for winter
feed upon the mountain slopes.
They’ll safely reach the valley
with the bundle, Billy hopes.
