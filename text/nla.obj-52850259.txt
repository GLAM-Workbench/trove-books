them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining; that
they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
TITUS 2.9-10.
2. Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward. i peter 2.18.
3. Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh;
not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart,
fearing God. COLOSSIANS 3.22.
4. As the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men.
EPHESIANS 6.6, 7.
5. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance; for ye serve the Lord Christ. COLOSSIANS 3.23, 24.
6. Christ Jesus...took upon him the form of a servant.
PHILIPPIANS 2.7.
Children.
1. Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.
ECCLESIASTES 12.1.
2. Prom a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able
to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus. 2 TIMOTHY 3.15.
3. My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
PROVEEBS 23.26.
4. 1 love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.

6. Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour
thy father and mother. EPHESIANS 6.1-2.
7. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility;
for God resisteth the proud, and giveth graee to the humble.
1 PETER 5.5.


Husbands.
7. Should have but one wife. GENESIS 2.24; l TIMOTHY 3.2, 12.
8. Dwell with, honour and pray with them.
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to know-
ledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel,
and as being heirs together of the grace .of life; that your prayers
be not hindered. i petbe 5.7.
9. Be faithful to them.
The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
cause? And .he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read,
that he which made them at the beginning, made them male and
female, and said. For this cause shall a man leave father and
mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
flesh ? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
therefore God hath joined together, let no man pnt asunder...
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adul-
tery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
adultery. Matthew 19.3-9.
And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let
not the wife depart from her husband; But and if she depart, let
her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let.
not the husband put away his wife...
If any brother hath, a wife that believeth not. and she be pleased
to dwell with him, let aim not put her away. And the woman
which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased
to dwell with her, let her not leave him...
But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases. 1 CORINTHIANS 7.10-15.
10. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
COLOSSI ANS 3.19; EPHESIANS 6.25-31,

12. Remain with them for life.
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to
her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she
is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her
husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called
an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that
law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another
man. ROMANS 7.2-?

but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to
whom she will; only in the Lord. 1 COEINTHIANS 7.39.

word of God be not blasphemed. TITUS 2.4-5.

is his reward. PSALM 127.3.
15. The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.

will not depart from it. PROVERBS 22.6.

for his crying. PEOVEEBS 19,18; 22.15; 23,13, 14; 13.24.
19. These words, which I command thee...shall he in thy heart. And

for of such is the kingdom of 6od...And he took them up in his
arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.

good report of them which are without, lest he fall into reproach
and the snare of the devil. i TIMOTHY 3.2-7.
6. For a bishop (elder) must be blameless, as the steward of God;
not self-willed, not soon angry...sober, just, holy, temperate; Hold-
ing fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may
be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the
gainsayers. TITUS 1.7, 8, 9.
7. We exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the

13. Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father, i timothy 5.1.

ACTS 2.42.
2. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed
took bread:
3. And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:
this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance
of me.
4. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
the Lord’s death till he come. 1 CORINTHIANS 11.23-26.
5. And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is

Drink ye all of it;
7. For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
for the remission of sins. MATTHEW 26.26-28.
See MARK 14,22-24 and LUKE 22.19-20.
8. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the
blood of Christ ? The bread which we break, is it not the com-
munion of the body of Christ?
9. For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all
partakers of that one bread. 1 CORINTHIAN'S 10.16-17.
10. So wc, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another. ROMANS 12.5.

all one in Christ Jesus. GALATIANS 3.26, 28.

the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; 2 COBINTHIANS 6.17.

unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
17. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
and drink of that cup.
18. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
19. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep.
20. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
21. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
should not be condemned with the world, l COBINTHIANS 11.27-32.

forgavest the iniquity of my sin. PSALM 32.5.

OUR GREAT HIGH PRIEST.
1. ...Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
Jesus. HEBREWS 3.1.
2. ...He that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also Christ glorified
not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him,
Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. HEBREWS 5.4, 5,
3. And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death. But this man, because he eon-
tinueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he
is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
HEBREWS 7.23-25.
4. For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens.
HEBREWS 7.26.
5. Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices,
first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did
once, when he offered up himself. HEBREWS 7.27.
6. But Christ...by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place,
having obtained eternal redemption for us. HEBREWS 9AI, 12.
7. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now
to appear in the presence of God for us. HEBREWS 9.24.
8. ...Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows. HEBREWS 1.9.
9. For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. JOHN 3.34.
BELIEVERS AS PRIESTS.
1. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in Ms own
blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God...

3. ...Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
Which is your reasonable service. ROMANS 12.1.

Why God give His holy law:

The law cannot make man good:

measures timber, and shews him he
come short;

2. He think he can hide sin from God, but
God’s Word say, “Be sure your sin

first. Only one thing needed, he must
run into it quick.
Outside —death. “The soul that sinneth,

Inside —life, food, everything he need.


76. Euth and Naomi. Jer. 2,19.

1. Because God love her He take away her
husband, but this not bring her back; 3.
2. Then He take away her two sons, and

How a backslider blocks God’s work:
1. She block her two sons- —they marry
heathen wives; v. 4.

go to Elisha; v. 6. Elisha picture of
Christ.
2. He go as high man to Elisha, v. y, but

2 Kings 5.20-27.
1. He hold Elisha’s staff, picture of
| power, but he not have that power;
2 Kings 4.27.
2. He covet money, calico, and gardens;
“Beware of coveteousness. ”
3. He think his master foolish because he
not do God’s work for money, but God

teaching, see his life and miracles;
■ We must give account to God for every
I chance He give us; Bom. 14.1.

steal, and spoil his life;
He is a warning to us like Lot.

■ not take money for doing God’s work;
| v. 16.
: He want Naaman to look to God;
■3. He rebuke Gehazi and say, “Is it a
time to think about money, and big
gardens, and calico?”; v. 26.
Now is the day of service;
1 Thess. 1.9, 10.
: 79. The Tongue. Psalm 141.3.
James 3.3-6, 8, 11.
Our tongue is like three small things
with great power for blessing or trouble:
Like a bit to guide horse; v. 3.
Like a helm (steer) to guide ship; v. 4.
Like a lire, starts small, grows very big;
Bo a small tongue can turn men to
Satan or to God; can bring blessing
or trouble.
, Unruly tongue spoils the whole body with
I dirty talk and swearing; full of poison.
| Man have power over beasts and ser-
ipents, but the tongue can no man tame;
v. 7, s.
Unkind tongue like firewood; Prov. 26.20.
Makes trouble speaking against others;
like feathers, go all about, and wo cannot
pick them up again.
Spring not have two kinds water; v. 11.

Four things to remember:

our tongue;

please God; 2 Pet. 3.18.

tempted; Heb. 4.15.
In the temple:
1. It was the law for boys to go to Jeru-
salem for the Passover at 12 years
old, so Jesus did this; v. 42.
2. Because He love God’s Word, He stop
in the temple to hear and ask ques-
tions; He could answer very well.
God wants children to learn the Bible
like this.
3. Ho never forget the verses he learn by
heart; when He come to be a man, He
use them against Satan; Matt. 4.
4. He was only a child when He said, I
must be doing My Father’s work; v. 49.
Work God give Him to do time He young:

God live in Tabernacle in the wilderness; i

Now the Church is God’s temple; Acts 7.48: I
1. Every believer is a house for God to
live in; 1 Cor 3.16. i
2. Temple should be clean; place for praise;
and worship. j
3. But Christ come and find the temple |
dirty, people spoil His Father’s house; j
4. They use it for market and things of i
this world. The Jews before fill it j
with rubbish and idols; 2 Chron. 29.16, j
How the temple was cleansed: 33.15.1
1. Christ cast out everything not fit that
temple, and rebuke them; v. 15, 16. :
Let Him be Master, and He will oast
out everything that spoil us; I
2. Then the glory of the Lord will fill the
house, and He will make our hearts j
a place of worship, praise and bless-
ing; 2 Chron. 7.1. !
5. Ask Him to keep anything unclean from '
coming in again; 2 Chron. 23.19. !
82. Woman of Samaria. John 4.13,14.
John 4.4, 6,7, 13-16, 24-29.

7. She full of joy; she leave her water
pot, she run to tell her people about
her Saviour, v. 28, 29, and many saved
through her testimony; v. 39.
8. The Lord Jesus teach us how to be
wise; He talk with this sinful woman
at mid-day.
83. The Sower. Luke 8.11.
Lute 8.5-8, 11-15.
Seed—Word of God; all good; v. 5, 11.
Ground —Heart of man: four kinds;
Sower —One who teaches Word of God; 5.
1. Wayside—Man outside; v. 5, 12.
Hear God’s Word, take no notice, so

Born again, got root, but weak, with
very little fruit. No room for seed
to grow strong —grass cover up seed;
Picture of cares, riches, pleasures,

Strong root, and plenty fruit;
Love God’s Word, and obey it;

84. Walking on the Sea. Matt. 14.27. j
Matthew 14.22-32. 1
After Christ feed 5000 He constrained ;
(made) His disciples go away by boat; 22.
1. He love them, yet He send them from
quiet place into rough sea; v. 22. ;
2. He not come to them till close up j
morning; He want to make that storm I
a blessing to them; v. 24.
3. Jesus come to them and say, “It is I
be not afraid’’; v. 27. With Him
they not afraid of the storm any more.
4. Jesus says tribulation must come; this
means trouble, sickness, hard time,
temptation; but they teach us to trust
Him, and find out His power;
5. He not promise to always take away
storms, but He promise to keep our
hearts quiet while we trust Him, like
a compass quiet and steady in a roll- 1
ing ship; Is. 26.3.
Peter walking on rough sea;
1. Time Peter look to Jesus he walk; v. 29.
Time he look at rough sea he sink; 30.
Time we trust we win;
Time we doubt we fall.
2. If we fear and sink, Jesus will hear our
cry, and lift us up again; v. 30, 31.
3. Storms cannot hurt the trust'ug Chris-
tian.
85. Jairus ’ Daughter. Luke 8.50.
Luke 8.41, 42, 49-55.
1. Trouble make this high master Jairus
pray, and come to the feet of Jesus; 41.
2. Sometimes God have to put His hand
on what we love, to bring us to Him-
self, so trouble turn to blessing;
3. Jesus say, "Fear not, only believe”; 50.
When men trust Jesus ’ power, they
make a way for Him to do great
things;
4. Only Jesus can give life; v. 54. 55.
When men get life, then Jesus tells
us to feed them with His Word; v. 55.
Death:
1. Man has no power against death; it
takes young and old, for all have
sinned; Bom. 5.12.
2. We only read of Jesus raising three
dead people; He came from heaven to
do a greater work, to give life to
people dead in sins; Eph. 2.1.
3. John 5.24 says: The dead (in sins) shall
hear His voice and live.
4. John 5.28 tells us that by and by Jesus
will raise dead bodies. He will de-
stroy death for ever; 1 Cor. 15.26,
Rev. 21.4.
86. The Transfiguration. Mark 9.7.
Mark 8.31, 34, 38; 9.1-8.
1. Our Master willing to go to Calvary;
He say: I must suffer, I must be killed;
But He have this joy in front of Him:
He want us in heaven with Him:
Heb. 12.2.
2. If any one follow the Lord true,
He must deny himself,
He must take up his cross daily,'
He must not bo ashamed of Jesus;
Suffering comes before glory.
3. The Lord Jesus shew three disciples who
keep more close to Him, a little bit of
glory to comfort them;
4. As He pray His face shine; Luke 9.29.
Much prayer makes us a little bit
like Him now; 2 Cor. 3.18.
5. Our bodies will shine with glory when
the Lord Jesus comes; 1 John 3.2.
6. Peter want to make two men high with
Jesus; some false teachers want to
put, Mary and holy men high with the
Lord Jesus; this is sin,
7. God »sy, “This is My beloved Son,
hear Him. ’' God the Father put His
Son high above every name in heaven
or in earth; Phil. 2.9-11.
8. Suffering that comes to Christians now,
because they true for Christ, is more
small; the glory by and by will be
more great; Eom. 8.18.
87. Demoniac Boy. Mark 9.23.
Mark 9.17-29.
In this lesson we see power of Satan to
spoil man, and power of Christ to deliver;
John 10.10.
1. Tearing, foaming, easting into fire shews
how Satan likes to hurt and spoil, and
kill those in his power; Matt. 13.42.
2. The Lord say, “Bring him to Me”;
v. 19. The Saviour came to destroy
the works of the devil; 1 John 3.8.

hard for Me; v. 23.
He answer, “Lord, I believe”; v. 24.
4 Jesus say, “Como out and enter no more
into him”; v. 25, 27.
Why disciples have no power:
1. Because of unbelief; v. 19, Matt. 17.20.
Nc matter power of Satan strong,
faith ir Christ will give victory. “Be
not faithless, but believing.”
2. Because of little p-ayer; v. 29.
Much power only come ■ after much
prayer.


88. Seventy sent forth. Luke 10.2.
Luke 10.1-3, 17-19.
1. The Lord sent out two and two into i
every village; they not heap up in:
one place: v. 1.
2. He send them first, and He come after;
He send us first, then He will come; 1.
3. God’s garden very big, not enough men;
Time we laze, many soulj perish; v. 2.
4. God first say “Pray,” so Ho send ouf |
men for His work; then He say
“Go”; v. 3.
5. We not go because wo like, or because;
men send us, but because the Lord I
says, ‘ ‘ Behold I send you ”; v. 3. I
6. I send you forth as lambs (young ones).:
He wants young Chxistians too, to go ;
out with the Gospel, or teach; v. 3.
7. He not promise them easy time; He say,
I send you as lambs among wolves; 3.
Lambs quiet, not fight, not able to care
for themselves;
Wolves wild, want to kill lambs.
Sometimes we find enemies, but the Gospel
has power to change wolves into lambs;
8. They come back with joy to tell the

are saved; Acts 10.47.

foundation of Peter; God say, only one
foundation—Jesus Christ; 1 Cor. 3.11.

they worship it; but this is only a

every time they take the Lord’s
Supper; but God say, Christ offered one
sacrifice for sins for ever; Heb. 10.12.

to place called “Purgatoria,” make
their sins burn up before they go io
heaven; hut Christ took our punish-
ment on the cross, ant. He sav, “It is
finished”; John 19, 30. When Chris-
tians die, they go one time to be with
the Lord; Phil. 1.23.
The repentant thief was a big sinner, he
; not baptized;
I He pray to Christ, not to Mary;
:He trust Christ, and he saved same day;
|He not go to “Purgatoria,” he go to
Paradise that same day;
| The Lord Jesus say to him, To-day shalt
thou be with me in Paradise.

children to come unto Me”; (20).
4. Take care not to stumble them bv bad
example; (16).
5. Be example to them in life, talk, Jove,
like Abraham. Never do anything
you not want them to copy.
Parents must train them for God; (l rr ):

When they old enough to understand,
pray with, them;

and speak one way to train their chil-
dren, so they not row before the child;

to come back. They stop work pull
up gardens, and when He not come
they make excuse; Matt, 24.46
2. They not want people to eat meat, pig,
fish; but God give us this food y o eat;
1 Tim. 4.3; Acts 10.14, 15.
3. They say, Satan bear away our sins;
but Christ “hare our sins in His own
body on the tree”; He cry, “It is
finished.” God say our s’ns are
blotted out, forgotten, Satan cannot
carry them; they are gonj for ever;
1 Pet. 2.24; Is. 14.82; Heb. 10.1?.
5. They say: Keeping Sunday, First Day,
is the mark of the beast, and if we
not keep seventh day we shall be cast
into the lake of fire.
But God say all Christians go to
heaven; and after that, Satan put His
mark on sinners on the earth;
Eev. 13.16.
6. These people hide their crooked teaching
and so deceive people who not know
God’s Word very well.
Seventh. Day, Saturday, Tne Sabbath:
1. God rested on the seventh day from all
His work at the Creation, and He set
apart one day in seven to be holy, and
for ifest for man;
2. When He brought Israel out of Egypt,
He made this iiy a sign (mark) for
His people, so they remember how He
deliver them; Deut. 12.15.
The First Day, Sunday, the Lord’s Day:
1. Christ rose again on Sunday, the First
Day, so this day speaks to us about
His finished work on the cross;
2. We not read about Him meeting Hia
disciples on any Sabbath day after
His resurrection;
3. But He appeared to them on the First
Day many times; Mark 16, Luke 24.
4. On the First Day the Holy Spirit de-
scended;
The first Christians meet and break
bread;
They giv t gifts to God;
God give revelation to John; Eev. 1.10.
5. As God give the Sabbath to Israel, so
God give Christians this First Day,
Sunday, so we remember how He
deliver us from sin and death;
We should keep it holy for Him;
Worship Him, and serve Him;
Not use it for ourselves;
“Not forsaking the assembling of our-
selves together”; Heb. 10.25.
Haul preach to Jews on the Sabbath,
because they only meet on that day,
like we preach to heathen at market;
But God’s Word never say Christians
must keep the Jewish Sabbath (Satur-
day); God say, we not let any one
trouble us about it; Col. 2.16.
The Law:
1. They say mon must keep the Law to be
saved. Jews say same thing before
to Gentile Christians; but Paul speak
strong against this teaching;
Acts 15.5, 6, 10, 11.
2. The Law shows man his sin; Eom. 3.20.
We are justified without the works of
the Law. “By grace are ye saved
through faith”; Eom. 3.28, Eph. 2.8.
3. The New I.a .' called the New Covenant,
the Holy Spirit writes upon our hearts;
This is more high, it is a better
covenant”; 2 Cor. 3.3; Heb. 8.6, 10
4. Nine of the Ten Commandments are in
Christ’s new laws for us in the Epistle,
but not the law to keep the Jewish
Sabbath, Saturday.

Text Book page 16.
Jesus Christ our perfect example. The
Son of God 'became a servant and learned
obedience; (6).
1. Servants should obey and please their
masters in all things; not only kind
masters, but cross ones too; (1, 2).
2. Not talk back, so they not bring shame
on their Saviour’s name, but shine for
Him; (1).
3. Work faithfully, not with eye-serviee;
This means work well when master
not look, to please the Lord; (3, 4).
4. Work heartily (strong), (5); and be
ready for any kind work; lazy men
cannot please God or men;
5. Be patient when they blame (row) you
for what you not do; 1 Pet. 2.20.
6. Take good care of master’s things; not
let them spoil or get lost;

us in the New Testament:
1. Eating blood; Acts 15.29.
2. Spotting the body, which is God’s temple;
1 Cor. 6.19, 20.
3. Witchcraft: Gal. 5.20, 21. This means
finding out things with hot stones,
making a swear, listening to evil
spirits sent by Satan, and many things
like that;
We are not to trust spirits to keep us
from sickness or trouble, to make
gardens grow, to help catch fish, or
any other thing; Ps. 104.14, 15, 25.
4. Observing times means taking notice of
signs when we going to do anything,
and changing the day for fear of evil
spirits; Ps. 118.24.
5. God hates every kind of witchcraft; He
destroyed the Canaanites for this
thing, and punished Israel with death;
God says: Come out and be separate.
1. Balaam, King of Moab, promise him big
reward if he curse God’s people;
2. Balaam try many times to do it, but
God not let him, he had no power
over them;
3. When God bless His people, witchcraft
cannot change it; Numb. 23.20. ]
122. Heathen Medicine. Ex. 15.26.
2 Kings 1.2-4; 2 Chron. 16.12.
Ahaziah, King of Israel, when he was
sick turned to the god of Ekron, and God
punished him with death.
God say to Elijah not to be afraid of
the King, but speak out against this thing;
v. 15, 16.
No matter people not want to hear, we
must speak out too; Is. 30.9, 10.
Asa, King of Judah, not turn to the
Lord in his sickness, but to the doctors,
and he died.
1. God not stop medicine from us;
Medicine is good; Prov. 17.22. Isaiah
gave medicine to Hezekiah for his
boils, and he was healed; 2 Kings 20.7.
2. We should use the medicine God gives,
and pray to Him for healing, so we
give God the praise and glory when
we better; Ps. 102.2, 3.
3. But Christians should not get medicine
from witchdoctor like Ahaziah, or look
to man in time of sickness and not to
God, like Asa.
Man who use heathen medicine:
1. Brings shame on God’s name; 2 Kings 1.3.
2. He lose power and blessing;
3. He sometimes goes back to the heathen.
123. Meat Offered to Idols.
1 Cor. 10.31.
Dan. 1.5, 8-17; 1 Cor. 10.19-21, 31.
1. Daniel true for God in heathen country.
God is able to keep from falling;
Jude 24.
2. Daniel say “No,” and hold fast to it,
when they tempt him to eat meat
offered to idols; v. 8, 1 Cor. 15.58
3. Because he feared God, he not afraid
to disobey the wicked king; v. 10, 11;
Acts 5.29.
4. Ho deny himself —he willing to leave
good food, eat only pulse, drink only
water for three years; v. 12.
5. Because Daniel not mix up, he help his
three friend's to be straight for God
too;
6. Because they true to God, He reward
them; He make their body strong, and
make them very wise; v. 17.
1 Oor. 10:
1. Idol is nothing, but when men sacrifice
to idols, they sacrifice to evil spirits;
2. Christians cannot eat at the table of
the Lord and the table of devils;
3. We shonld eat and drink, and do all
things for the glory of God.


124. Guidance. (1)
Text Book page 15.
Guidance means shewing which way to
go;
God has promised to guide us; (1, 3).
If we want God to guide us we must do
three things:
1. We must trust in the Lord with all our
heart, and not trust our elm sense; (3).
2. We must be ready to let go our own
way, and be ready to do God’s will; (2).
3. Ask God to teach us His way, and lead
ns in a plain path; (4, 5,6).
God guides us in three ways:
1. By His Word—God will never lead ns
to do anything not fit His Word; (8).
2. By His Holy Spirit —Time we pray, He
will bring to our heart what He want
us to do; Acts 16.6, 7, 10.
3. By things He sends to us which open
the way, or block the way;
When these three fit together,
God’s Word, His Spirit,
Open way or block way.
Then we know God’s will for us.
Jonah see way open and he follow it,
but He make big mistake, because that
way not fit God’s Word; Jonah 1.1, 3.
125. Suffering of Believers.
Heb. 12.6.
Rom. 14.10: Heb. 12.5, 6, Hi Job 1.7-11, 21.
Why do Christians suffer ?
1. Sometimes for our own sin, our Father
chastens His children to make us
straight; John 5.14, Hob. 12.5.
2. Sometimes God lets sins of others hurt
us, but turns it to our good after like
Joseph; Gen. 50.20.
3. To make us more holy like Himself;
Ps. 66.10 (silver).
4. To keep us humble like Paul; 2 Cor. 12.7-9.
5. Sometimes for no sin, but for God’s
glory; John 9.2, 3; Ch. 11.4.
Like Job 1.7-12.
So we must not judge our sick brother
and say, “You sick because you sin”;
Eom. 14.10, 13.
When trouble or sickness comes:
1. Let a man examine himself and be exer-
cised; this means, go to God about it;
Heb. 12.11.
2. Be patient Like Job, not cross; Job 2.6,
7, 10; Oh. 13; v. 5 (grindstone).
3. Not get downhearted; (seabirds).
4. Trust God’s love to carry you through
to fruit and blessing after; (bluestone).
“If you trust, you not trouble,
If you trouble, you not trust.”
1 126. The Church, the Body of Christ.
Verse 12.
1 Cor. 12.1-4, 11-22, 25, 26.
The Holy Spirit shews in this lesson
Christians are members of one body, obey-
ing Christ the Head.
1. Some of ns have big work, some small
work, but all need one another; eye
cannot hear, ear cannot talk; v. 6, 16.
2. We not choose our work, the Holy Spirit
give it; so we not proud if we have
big work, or downhearted if we have
small 'work.
3. If we not use the gift God gives us, He
will take it away; Matt. 25.28.
4. Members must all care for one another
and help each other; v. 25.
5. They must not despise weak members,
or talk against them; v. 21, 22.
6. If one member suffer, all suffer; v. 86.
This* means if trouble or sickness
comes, or temptation win him, we must
suffer with him, beoause we are all
joined together;
7. If God use another Christian, we not
jealous, we must be glad;
8. If every member do that work the Holy
Spirit put for him, then one work not
please God more than another.
127. Gifts to the Church. Eph. 4.12.
1 Cor. 12.28 s Eph. 4.11-14.
God gave to the Church, apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers,
helps, governments.
1. For building up the saints, so they grow
into strong men of God;
2. So they no more children shaken about
by false teaching;
3. So they all joined and fit together.
1. Apostles not needed in the Church to-
day; they laid the foundations, we gu
on building the house.
2. Prophets: Those who speak to men to
build' up, and exhort, and comfort
them; Acts 15.32; 1 Cor. 14.3, 31.
3. Evangelists go out with the Gospel like
fishermen to bring souls to Christ;
4. Pastors care for God’s children, watch
over each one, help them by love and
prayer, and try to bring back
wanderers;
5. Teachers search the Word of God, give
out what they find; give lesson to fit
every need; Jer. 3.15; John 21.15.
6. Helps ready to do any good work; teach
reading, clean the village and Church,
care for the sick; all can be helps;
7. Governments wise men, able to make
troubles straight among the Christians,,
and lead the weak ones.

Christians must not go to law with
Christians: ;
So we must not summons a man to get'
back ground or money or things like that.
Why Christians must not go to law:
1. Because it brings shame on God’s name, j
if wo shew out our rows before un-
believers; v. 6.
2. God says: Take troubles and rows be-
tween Christians to wise men in the
Church; Matt. 18.15-17.
3. If no Christians can straighten that
trouble, it is better to suffer loss, to
lose money or anything, than to go to
law and lose God’s blessing;
Blessed are the peacemakers.

The lessons in this book have been prepared by Miss V. Sullivan and Miss K.
Deck for the native teachers in the training school at One Pusu. Each lesson is
given with the help of pictures and illustrations, and the same lesson is repeated
until every pupil can himself give it out to others.
The lessons are not intended to be exhaustive, or even in every case to cover
the main teaching contained in a passage, but the points emphasised are those
which are simple enough for our people to grasp, and which fit their lives. More
or less pidgin English has been used for the same reason.
