FOR THE BENEFIT OF
Mr B. BEMBL
On FRIDAY Evening, March 27 th, 1829,
Will be presented (for the first time here) a Domestic Drama, founded on one of Mrs Opie's popular tales, entitled The
Lear of Private Life
(DIB* WAWMm AMD 0)
Who has not wept over Mrs Opie's popular and pathetic story upon which this Piece is founded. It has been
translated into almost every modern language, and dramatized at various foreign Theatres, and has ever proved
a fruitful source of interest and tears. Ten months are supposed to have elapsed between the first and second
Acts. No material deviations have been made from the original story, but such as were absolutely necessary for
unity of action and dramatic effect. The author of the piece, while he has scorned to become a servile and slavish
imitator, has endeavoured to do justice to the conceptions of a writer who, if we could convert the tears of pity
into pearls, would deserve the richest coronet that ever was bestowed by the hand of sympathy to grace the
brows of genius.
