MOTHER,
Oh, well I can remember sow.
When but a little boy,
The fond caresses I received
I was my mother's joy:
As I grew up in after years.
It caused me many a sigh,
-I broke the laws, and soon it caused
My mother dear to cry. '
CHORUS.
Oh, my mother, don't you cry for me,
For soon I may return again my mother deer
to see.
Within this ancient city
How happy days did pass.
And in the summer evenings
When sitting on the grass.
The tale of love I often told
When my dear girl was nigh |
Alas! lam transported now.
But, mother, don't you cry.
And never shall I once forget
The sorrows of that day,
When from the prison on the coach
They hastened me away ;
It grieved me to bid adieu
To those of bye-gone years;
It grieved me much worse to see
My aged mother burst in tears.
O, tell all my companions,
Now I'm in a foreign land.
Our Governor is cruel,
And we're chained hand to banc*
When on my bed I lay me down,
1 get but little sleep,
I dream of being home again.
And waken but to weep.
I'll send a letter to my girl.
The one that I adore,
For who can tell that I may
Ever see her more :
A kiss she gave unto me,
On the morn that did part,
But if I had her near to me,
I'd press her to my heart.
One night when I had laid me down,
I thought my heart would break.
My sufferings were dreadful,
And I was afraid to speak s
Then in the morning I arose,
What joyful news to hear,
The sound of liberty
My beast with Joy wae burretfug,
When the news I did reiceive ;
Until ( asked the Governor,
I scarcely could believe..
I found the Queen had pairdoacd <UÂ£
And now I'm on the foami.
For to embrace you, mother, dear.
Your child is coining hotue.
THE LOVELY
Ml Fit;
OR.
I dont mean to tell yon
her name
To my Tillage fair 110 lass can compare
For innocence and native grace,
She boasts not of wealth, though the pure bloom
of health
Shews forth in her beautiful face:
Such a form ne'er was seen, as she tripp'd o'er
? the green,
And her heart free from guile and from
She lives near the mill at the top of the hill.
But I don't mean to tell you her name.
Her luxuriant hair, so bewitchingly fair
As it sportively plays in the wind;
Her bright beaming eye, like the blue of the sky,
Is an emblem so pure of her mind.
The sound of her voice makes my fond heart re*
joice,
My love, O what mortal can blame ?
She fives near the mill at the top of the hill
But I don't mean to tell you her name.
The lord and the squire, altho' they rank higher,
Endeavour her favour to gain;
Let them try how they may, she still will say nay,
And they'll find all their labour in vain.
It was but last night, as we walk'd by moonlight.
She owned she for me felt love's flame:
She lives near the mill at the top of the hill,
But I don t mean to tell you her name.
How happy I'll be when united I see
Myself with this beautiful fair;
#h en to me she'll impart both her hand and her
heart,
No bliss with my joys can compare .
When in wedlock we join, our hearts will com-
bine,
And Cupid our love will intlame,
While we sport round the hill, and she lives near
the mill,
AnAthafr day I will her name.
