Advent
My God! How Wonderful
Thou Art.
My God! how wonderful Thou art,
Thy Majesty how bright,
How beautiful Thy mercy-seat
In depths of burning light!
How dread are Thine eternal years,
O everlasting Lord!
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!
How beautiful, how beautiful
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless
power,
And awful purity!
Oh, how I fear, Thee, Living God!
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling
hope,
And penitential tears.
Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord!
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of
me
The love of my poor heart.
Oh, then, this worse than worth-
less heart
In pity deign to take,
And make it love Thee, for Thyself
And for Thy glory’s sake.
No earthly Father loves like Thee,
No mother half so mild
Bears and forbears, as Thou hast
done,
With me, Thy sinful child.
Only to sit and think of God,
Oh, what a joy it is!
To think the thought, to breathe
the Name,
Earth has no higher bliss!
Father of Jesus, love’s Reward!
What rapture will it be,
Prostrate before Thy Throne to lie,
And gaze and gaze on Thee!

Come, All Ye Faithful.
Come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
Oh hasten, O hasten to Bethlehem;
See in a manger
The monarch of angels.
O Come and let us worship
Christ the Lord.


God of God Eternal,
Light from light proceeding,
He deigns in the Virgin’s womb
to lie;
Very God of very God,
Begotten, not created.
O come, &c.
Sing alleluia,
All ye choirs of angels;
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven
above,
Glory to God
In the highest.
O come, &c.
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning;
To Thee, O Jesus, be glory given;
True word of the Father,
In our flesh appearing.
O come, &c.
Angels We Have Heard On
High.
Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o’er our plains,
And the mountains in reply,
Echo back their joyous strains.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Shepherds, why this Jubilee?
Why your rapturous strain pro-
long?
What may the gladsome tidings be,
Which inspire your heavenly
song.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Come to Bethlehem, and see
Him whose birth the angels
sing:
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the new-born
King.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels
praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we
raise.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
O King of Heaven! From
Starry Throne Descending.
0 King of Heaven! from starry
throne descending,
Thou takest refuge in that
wretched cave;
God of bliss! I see Thee cold and
trembling:
What pain it cost Thee fallen
man to save!
Sweet Infant Jesus,
Infant divine,
Make me, oh make me,
For ever be Thine!
Thou of a thousand worlds the
great Creator
Dost now the pain of cold and
want endure;
Thy poverty but makes Thee more
endearing,
For well I know ’tis love has
made Thee poor.
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.
1 see Thee leave Thy heavenly
Father’s bosom;
But whither has Thy love trans-
ported Thee?
Upon a little straw I see Thee
lying;
Why suffer thus? 'Tis all for
the love of me.
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.
If it is Thy will for me to suffer,
And by these sufferings my
heart to move,
Wherefore, my Jesus, do I see
Thee weeping?
’Tis not for pain Thou weepest,
but for love.
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.


Thou weepest thus to see me so
ungrateful;
My sins have pierced Thee to
the very core;
I once despised Thy love, but now
I love Thee,
I love but Thee; then Jesus weep
no more.
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.
Thou sleepest, Lord, but Thy heart
ever watches,
No slumber can a heart so lov-
ing take:
But tell me, darling Babe, of what
Thou thinkest;
“I think,” He says, “of dying for
thy sake.”
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.
Is it for me that Thou dost think
of dying ?
What, then, O Jesus, can I love
taut Thee?
Mary, my hope! if I love Him too
little,
Be not indignant; love Him thou
for me.
Sweet Infant Jesus, &c.
See, Amid The Winter’s Snow.
See, amid the winter’s snow,
Born for us on earth below;
See, the tender Lamb appears,
Promised from eternal years!
Chorus:
Hall, thou ever-blessed morn,
Hail, Redemption’s happy dawn!
Sing through all Jerusalem,
Christ is born in Bethlehem!
Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the starry skies;
He, who throned in height sublime,
Sits amid the Cherubim!
Sacred Infant all divine,
What a tender love was Thine;
Thus to come from highest bliss,
Down to such a world as this!
Teach, oh teach us, holy Child,
By Thy face so meek and mild;
Teach us to resemble Thee
In Thy sweet humility.
Virgin Mother, Mary blest,
By the joys that fill thy breast,
Pray for us that we may prove
Worthy of the Saviour’s love.
Silent Night.
Silent night, Hallowed night,
Earth is hushed, Heaven alight,
Angels throng the starlit air,
Whispering round the child so fair,
Sleep my Baby King,
Sleep they softly sing.
Silent night, Sacred night,
Bethlehem sleeps, yet what light
Floats around the holy Pair,
Songs of angels fill the air.
Strains of Heavenly Peace.
Strains of Heavenly Peace.
All is still, Jesus sleeps,
Holy watch, Joseph keeps.
Mary bends, His face to see,
Whispering low her lullaby,
Sleep, my Babe divine;
Sleep, God’s Son and Mine.
O Leave Your Sheep.
O leave your sheep,
Your lambs that follow after,
O leave the brook, the pasture and
the crook.
No longer weep,
Turn weeping into laughter,
O Shepherds seek your goal.
Your Lord, Your Lord,
Who cometh to console,
Your Lord, Your Lord,
Who cometh to console.


You’ll find Him laid within a
simple stable.
A babe new born in poverty for-
lorn.
In love arrayed, a love so deep,
’Tis able to search the night for
you;
’Tis He, 'Tis He,
’Tis He the shepherd true.
’Tis He, ’Tis He,
’Tis He the shepherd true.
The Snow Lay on the Ground.
The snow lay on the ground,
The stars shone bright,
When Christ our Lord was born,
On Christmas night.
’Twas Mary, daughter pure
Of holy Anne,
That brought into this world
The God-made man.
She laid Him in a stall
At Bethlehem;
The assi and oxen shared
The roof with them.
St. Joseph, too, was by,
To tend the Child;
To guard Him, and protect
His Mother mild.
The angels hover’d round,
And sang this song—
“Venite Adoremus Dominum.”
Dear Little One.
Dear Little One, how sweet Thou
art,
Thine eyes how bright they
shine;
So bright, they almost seem to
speak
When Mary’s look meets Thine.
How faint and feeble is Thy cry,
Like plaint of harmless dove,
When Thou dost murmur in Thy
sleep
Of sorrow and of Love.
Dear Little One, how sweet Thou
art,
Thine eyes how bright they
shine;
So bright, they almost seem to
speak
When Mary’s look meets Thine.
When Mary bids Thee sleep Thou
sleepest,
Thou wakest when she calls,
Thou art content upon her lap
Or in the rugged stall.
Simplest of babes, with what a
grace
Thou dost Thy Mother’s will,
Thine Infant fashions well betray
The Godhead’s hidden skill.
Come To The Manger.
Come, come, come to the manger,
Children come to the children’s
King.
Sing, sing, chorus of angels,
Stars of morning, o’er Bethle-
hem sing.
He lies ’midst the beasts of the
stall.
Who is Maker and Lord of us all,
The wintry wind blows cold and
dreary,
See, he weeps, the world is weary.
Lord have pity and mercy on me.
He leaves all his glory behind,
To be born and die for mankind,
With grateful beasts, His cradle
chooses,
Thankless man his love refuses.
Lord have pity and mercy on me.


Away In The Manger.
Away in the manger no crib for a
babe,
The little Lord Jesus lay down His
sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky,
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the
hay.
The cattle are lowing, the Baby
wakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying
he makes,
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down
from the sky,
And stay by my side until morn-
ing is nigh.
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask
Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me
I pray.
And love me I pray.
Bless all the dear children in Thy
tender care,
And fit us for heaven to live with
Thee there.
Hymn To The Holy Child.
Heart of the Holy Child,
Hide me in Thee;
Purest and undefiled,
Purify me;
Joy of my infant life,
Far from evil passions rife,
Troubling this world of strife,
Keep me with Thee.
Sweet Child of Bethlehem,
Open Thine Heart;
Lessons from Nazareth
Deign to impart;
Mary and Joseph dear,
Let us be to Jesus near;
With you, we shall not fear
From Him to part.
Hymn To The Child Jesus.
Little King, so fair and sweet,
See us gathered round Thy feet,
Be Thou Monarch of our School,
It shall prosper ’neath Thy rule.
We will be Thy subjects true.
Brave to suffer, brave to do.
All our hearts to Thee we taring
Take them, keep them, little King.
Raise Thy little Hand to bless
All our childhood’s happiness;
Bless our sorrow and our pain,
That each cross may be our gain.
By Thine own sweet childhood.
Lord,
Sanctify each thought and word.
Set Thy seal on everything
Which we do, O little King.
Sleep Holy Babe.
Sleep, holy babe,
Upon thy mother’s breast,
The Lord of sea and earth and sky,
How sweet it is to see Thee lie
In such a place of rest.
Sleep, holy babe! Sleep, holy babe!
Sleep, holy babe,
Thine angels watch around,
All bending low with folded wings,
Before the Incarnate King of
Kings,
In reverent awe profound,
Sleep, holy babe! Sleep, holy babe!
The Holy Name
Jesus, The Very Thought Of
Thee.
Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With rapture fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.
No voice can sing, no heart can
frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest
Name,
O Saviour of mankind!


O hope of every contrite heart,
O joy of all the meek,
To those who fall how kind Thou
art,
How good to those who seek.
But what of those who find? Ah!
this
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus what it is
None but His loved ones know.
Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our hope wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.
O King of love, Thy blessed fire
Does such sweet flames excite
That first it raises the desire,
Then fills it with delight.
O Jesus, Jesus, Dearest Lord.
0 Jesus, Jesus! dearest Lord!
Forgive me if I say
For very love Thy Sacred Name
A thousand times a day.
1 love Thee so, I know not how
My transports to control;
Thy love is like a burning fire
Within my very soul.
O wonderful; that Thou shouldst
let
So vile a heart as mine
Love Thee with such a love as this,
And make so free with Thine.
For Thou to me art all in all,
My honour and my wealth,
My heart’s desire, my body’s
strength,
My soul’s eternal health.
What limit is there to Thee, love?
Thy flight where wilt Thou stay ?
On! on! our Lord is sweeter far
To-day than yesterday.
Oh love of Jesus! Blessed love!
So will it ever be;
Time cannot hold Thy wondrous
growth,
No, nor eternity!
Lent
God Of Mercy And
Compassion.
God of mercy and compassion,
Look with pity upon me;
Father, let me call Thee Father,
’Tis Thy child returns to Thee.
Chorus:
Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy,
Let me not implore in vain;
All my sins I now detest them,
Never will I sin again.
By my sins I have deserved
Death and endless misery,
Hell with all its pains and tor-
ments,
And for all eternity.
By my sins I have abandon’d
Right and claim to Heav’n above,
Where the Saints rejoice for ever
In a boundless sea of love.
See our Saviour, bleeding, dying,
On the cross of Calvary;
To that cross my sins have nail’d
Him,
Yet He bleeds and dies for me.
Hymn Of Repentance.
Jesus, my God, behold at length
the time,
When I resolve to turn away from
crime;
0 pardon me, Jesus,
Thy mercy I implore;
1 will never more offend Thee:
No, never more.
Since my poor soul Thy Precious
Blood hath cost,
Suffer me not for ever to be lost!
0 pardon me, Jesus,
Thy mercy I implore;
1 will never more offend Thee:
No, never more.


Kneeling, in tears, behold me at
Thy feet,
Like Magdalen, forgiveness I en-
treat,
0 pardon me, Jesus,
Thy mercy I implore;
1 will never more offend Thee:
No, never more.
Litany Of The Passion Of
Jesus.
By the Blood that flowed from
Thee,
In Thy hitter agony,
By the scourge so meekly borne,
By Thy purple robe of scorn —
Chorus:
Jesus, Saviour, hear our cry,
Thou wert suffering once as
we,
Hear the loving Litany
We, Thy children, sing to
Thee.
By the thorns that crowned Thy
head,
By Thy sceptre of a reed,
By Thy footsteps faint and slow,
Weighed beneath Thy cross of woe.
The Precious Blood.
Glory be to Jesus!
Who in bitter pains
Poured for me the lifeblood
From His sacred veins.
Chorus:
Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood,
Louder still, and louder,
Praise the precious blood.
Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Bless’d be His compassion,
Infinitely kind!
Bless'd through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torment
Doth the world redeem.
I See My Jesus Crucified.
I see my Jesus crucified,
His wounded hands, and feet, and
side,
His sacred flesh all rent and torn,
His cruel crown of sharpest thorn.
Those pointed nails I drove them
in
Each time I pierced Him with my
sin;
That crown of thorns ’twas I who
wove
When I despised His gracious love.
Then to those feet I’ll venture near,
And wash them with a contrite
tear,
And every bleeding wound I see
I’ll think He bore them all for me.
Deep graven on my sinful heart,
Oh, never may that form depart,
That with me always may abide
The thought of Jesus Crucified.
Hymn To The Sacred Face.
Tears on Thy Sacred Face, my
God!
Long sorrow, told by tears.
A wreath of torture crowns at last
The agony of years.
Thy glory dimmed, Thy beauty
fled,
Thy tender, touching grace
Beams on us now no longer here,
O Sacred, Suffering Face!
Unclose Thy weary eyes, my God.
Bow down Thy weary Head,
Over the souls that prostrate lie
Thy Precious Blood be shed.
O royal flood, O golden flood
Of faith, of hope, of grace,
Bless Thou the hearts and eyes
that seek
Thy Sacred, Suffering Face.


To Our Lady of Sprrows.
O Mother most afflicted,
Standing beneath that tree,
Where Jesus hangs rejected
On the hill of Calvary.
0 Mary, sweetest Mother,
We love and pity thee.
Oh! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.
Thy heart is well-nigh breaking
Thy Jesus thus to see,
Derided, wounded, dying,
In the greatest agony.
His livid form is bleeding,
His soul with sorrow wrung,
Whilst thou, His Mother, sharest
The torments of thy Son.
To Jesus Crucified.
Oh! come and mourn with me
awhile;
See, Mary calls us to her side;
Oh! let us come and mourn with
her;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified.
Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews
deride ?
Ah, look how patiently He hangs!
Jesus, our Love, is crucified.
Seven times He spoke, seven words
of love,
And all three hours His silence
cried
For mercy on the souls of men.
Jesus, our Love, is crucified.
To The Holy Face.
Adown Thy cheeks, O Face Divine,
Are bitter tears that flow;
They grieve me, for earth’s sins
and mine.
Caused all Thy bitter v/oe.
1 forced Thy cruel crown of thorns
To hide those eyes with blood,
By thoughts of sin and all that
scorns
Thy Will, my only good.
Thy lips so sweet are curved with
pain,
’Twas I that caused it all;
Thy sad, sweet Face I strike again,
Each time I sinning fall.
O patient, sweet and loving kind,
Teach me all ill to flee,
My falls with grief Thy Face has
lined;
Dear Jesus, pity me.
Easter Sunday.
By the first bright Easter day
When the stone was rolled away
By the glory round Thee shed,
At Thy rising from the dead.
Chorus:
King of Glory, hear our cry,
Make us soon Thy joy to see,
Where enthroned in Majesty
Countless angels sing to Thee.
By Thy mother’s fond embrace,
By her joy to see Thy face,
When all bright in radiant bloom
Thee she welcomed from the tomb.
By the joy of Magdalen,
When she saw Thee once again.
And enhanced with rapture sweet
Knelt to kiss Thy sacred feet.
By their joy who greeted Thee
’Mid the hills of Galilee;
By Thy keys of might divine,
Vested in St. Peter’s line.
Regina Coeli.

Passion Tide
Vexilla Regis.
Vexilla Regis prodeunt
Fulget Crucis mysterium,
Qua vita mortem pertulit,
Et morte vitam protulit.
Quae vulnerata lancae
Mucrone diro criminum
Ut nos lavaret sordibus:
Hanavit unda et sanguine.
Impleta sunt quae concinit
David fideli carmine.
Dicendo nationibus:
Regnavit a ligno Deus.
Arbor decora et fulgida,
Ornata Regis purpura,
Electra digno stipite
Tam sancta membra tangere.
Beata cujus brachiis
Pretium pependit saeculi,
Statera facta corporis,
Tulltque praedam tartari.
O Crux, ave, spes unica,
Hoc Passionis tempore
Piis adauge gratiam,
Reisque dele crimina.
Te, fons salutis Trinitas,
Collaudet omnis spiritus:
Quibus Crucis victoriam
Largiris, adde praemium. Amen.
V. Eripe me, Domine, ab homine
malo.
R. A viro iniquo eripe me.
O Come And Mourn With Me
Awhile.
O, Come and mourn with me
awhile;
See, Mary calls us to her side;
O come and let us mourn with her:
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and Jews de-
ride ?
Ah, look how patiently He hangs;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
What was Thy crime, my dearest
Lord?
By earth, by heaven, Thou hast
been tried,
And guilty found of too much love:
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
O break, O break, hard heart of
mine!
Thy weak self-love and guilty pride
His Pilate and Judas were;
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
Come, take thy stand beneath the
Cross,
And let the Blood from out that
side
Fall gently on thee drop by drop:
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!
O Love of God, O sin of man!
In this dread act your strength is
tried;
And victory remains with love,
For He, our Love, is crucified!
Friday in Passion Week,
Feast of our Lady of
Dolours
Stabat Mater.
Stabat mater dolorosa
Juxta crucem lacrymosa
Dum pendebat Filius.
Cujus animam gementem
Contristatam et doientem,
Pertransivit gladius.
O quam tristis, et afflicta,
Fuit ilia benedicta
Mater Unigeniti!


Quae moerebat, et dolebat,
Pia Mater, dum videbat
Nati Poenas inclyti.
Quis est homo, qui non fleret,
Matrem Christi si videret
In tanto supplicio ?
Quis non posset contristari,
Christi matrem contemplari,
Dolentem cum Filio?
Pro peccatis suae gentis,
Vidit Jesum in tormentis
Et flagellis subditum.
Vidit suum dulcem natum
Moriendo desolatum,
Dum emisit spiritum.
Eja, Mater, tons amoris,
Me sentire vim doloris
Fac, ut tecum lageam.
Fac ut ardeat cor meum
In amando Christum Deum,
Ut sibi complaceam.
Sancta Mater, istud agas
Crucifixi fige plagas
Cordi meo valide.
Tui nati vulnerati,
Tam dignati pro me pati,
Poenas, mecum divide.
Fac me tecum pie flere,
Crucifix© condolere,
Donee ego vixero.
Juxta crucem tecum stare,
Et me tibi sociare
In planctu desidero.
Virgo vlrginum praeclara,
Mihi jam non sis amara;
Fac me tecum plangere.
Fac ut portem Christi mortem,
Passionis fac consortem,
Et plagas recolere.
Fac me plagis vulnerari,
Fac me cruce inebriari,
Et cruore Filii.
Flammis ne urar succensus,
Per te, Virgo, sim defensus
In die judicii.
Christe, cum sit hinc exire,
Da per Matrem me venire
Ad palman victoriae.
Quando corpus morietur,
Fac ut animae donetur
Paradisi gloria. Amen.
At The Cross Her Station
Keeping.
At the cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful mother weep-
ing,
Close to Jesus to the last.
Through her heart, His sorrow
sharing,
And His bitter anguish bearing,
Now at length the sword has
pass'd.
Oh! how sad and sore distress’d
Was that mother, highly blest,
Of the sole-begotten one!
Christ above in torment hangs;
She beneath beholds the pangs
Of her dying glorious Son.
Is there one who would not weep,
'Whelmed in miseries so deep,
Christ’s dear Mother to behold?
Can the human heart refrain
From partaking in her pain,
In that Mother’s pain untold?
Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,
She beheld her tender child,
All with bloody scourges rent;
For the sins of His own nation,
Saw Him hang in desolation,
Till His spirit forth He sent.


O thou Mother! fount of love!
Touch my spirit from above,
Make my heart with thine
accord:
Make me feel as thou hast felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt
With the love of Christ my Lord.
Holy Mother: pierce me through;
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Saviour crucified.
Let me share with thee His pain
Who for all my sins was slain,
Who for me in torments died.
Let our tears in one same tide
Flow for Jesus crucified,
Long as life shall warm my
breast.
By the Cross to take my station,
Share thy tender lamentation,
This is my most fond request.
Brightest of the Virgin train,
Do not thou my suit disdain,
Come and share thy grief with
me.
Let me trace His sufferings o’er,
Bear the very death He bore,
When they nailed Him to the
tree.
Feel the wounds He felt for us,
Drink the Chalice of His Cross,
All for love of thy dear Son.
Screened by thee from flames
divine,
Mary, guard this soul of mine
When the judgment day comes
on.
Christ, when these my days are
done,
Let Thy Mother lead me on
To the palm of victory.
Yea, when this trial flesh hath
died,
Let my soul be glorified
Safe with Thee in Paradise.
Amen.
Easter
Christ The Lord Is Risen
To-day.
Christ the Lord is risen to-day:
Christians, haste your vows to pay;
Offer ye your praises meet
At the Paschal Victim’s feet;
For the sheep the Lamb hath bled,
Sinless in the sinner’s stead.
Christ the Lord is ris’n on high!
Now he lives no more to die.
Christ the Victim undefil’d,
Man to God hath reconcil’d;
When in strange and awful strife
Met together death and life;
Christians, on this happy day
Haste with joy your vows to pay.
Christ the Lord is ris’n on high;
Now he lives, no more to die.
Say, O wond’ring Mary, say,
What thou sawest on thy way,
“I beheld, where Christ had lain,
Empty tomb and angels twain;
I beheld the glory bright
Of the rising Lord of light:
Christ my hope is ris’n again;
Now he lives, and lives to reign.”
Christ, Who once for sinners bled,
Now the first-born from the dead,
Thron’d in endless might and
power,
Lives and reigns for evermore.
Hail, eternal hope on high!
Hail, thou King of victory!
Hail, thou Prince of life ador’d!
Help and save us, gracious Lord.
Ascension
Why Is Thy Face So Lit With
Smiles.
Why is thy face so lit with smiles,
Mother of Jesus! Why
And wherefore is thy beaming look
So fixed upon the sky?


From out thine overflowing eyes
Bright lights of gladness part,
As though some gushing fount of
joy
Had broken in thy heart.
Mother! how canst thou smile to-
day?
How can thine eyes be bright,
When He, thy Life, thy Love,
thine All,
Hath vanished from thy sight?
His rising form on Olivet
A summer’s shadow cast;
The branches of the hoary trees
Drooped as the shadow passed.
And as He rose with all His train,
Of righteous souls around,
His blessing fell into thine heart,
Like dew into the ground.
Yes! He hath left thee, Mother
dear;
His throne is far above;
How canst thou be so full of joy,
When thou hast lost thy Love?
Why do not thy sweet hands detain
His feet upon their way?
O, why doth not the Mother speak
And bid her Son to stay?
Ah no! thy love is rightful love,
From all self-seeking free;
The change that is such gain to
Him
Can be no loss to thee!
Pentecost
Come, O Creator, Spirit
Blest.
Come, O Creator, Spirit blest!
And in our souls take up Thy rest;
Come with Thy grace and heaven-
ly aid
To fill the hearts which Thou hast
made.
Great Paraclete, to Thee we cry;
O highest gift of God most high;
O fount of life, O fire of love,
And sweet Anointing from above!
Thou in Thy sevenfold gifts are
known,
Thee, Finger of God’s hand we
own;
The promise of the Father Thou,
Who dost the tongue with power
endow.
Our senses kindle from above,
And make our hearts o’erflow with
love;
With patience firm and virtue high
The weakness of our flesh supply.
Drive far from us the foe we
dread,
And grant us Thy true peace in-
stead;
So shall we not, with Thee for
guide,
Turn from the path of life aside.
Oh, may Thy grace on us bestow
The Father and the Son to know,
And Thee through endless times
confessed
Of both the Eternal Spirit blest.
All glory, while the ages run,
Be to the Father and the Son,
Who rose from death, the same to
Thee,
O Holy Ghost, eternally.
Veni Creator.
Veni, Creator Spiritus,
Mentes tuorum visita,
Imple supema gratia,
Quae' tu creasti pectora.
Qui diceris Paraclitus,
Altissimi donum Dei,
Fons vivus, ignis, caritas,
Et spiritalis unctio.


Tu septiformis munere,
Digitus paternae dexterae
Tu rite promissum Patris,
Sermone ditans guttura.
Accende lumen sensibus:
Infunde amorem cordibus:
Inflrma nostri corporis
Virtute firmans perpeti.
Hostem repellas longius,
Pacemque dones protinus
Ductore sic te praevio,
Vitemus omne noxium.
Per te sciamus da Patrem,
Noscamus atque Filium,
Teque utriusque Spiritum,
Credamus omni tempore.
Deo Patri sit gloria,

Come, Holy Ghost, Creator
Come.
Come, Holy Ghost, Creator come
From Thy bright heav’nly
throne,
Come, take possession of our souls,
And make them all Thy own.
Thou Who art called the Paraclete,
Best gift of God above,
The living spring, the living fire,
Sweet unction and true love.
Thou Who art sev’nfold in Thy
grace,
Finger of God’s right hand;
His promise teaching little ones
To speak and understand;
O, guide our minds with Thy
biess’d light,
And with love our hearts in-
flame;
And with Thy strength, which
ne’er decays,
Confirm our mortal frame.
Far from us drive our deadly foe;
True peace unto us bring;
And through all perils lead us safe
Beneath Thy sacred wing.
Through Thee may we the Father
know,
Through Thee th’ eternal Son,
And Thee, the Spirit of them both,
Thrice blessed Three in One.
All glory to the Father be,
With His co-equal Son;
The same to Thee, great Paraclete,
While endless ages run.
Come, Holy Ghost, Send Down
Those Beams.
Come Holy Ghost, send down those
beams
Which sweetly flow in silent
streams
From Thy bright throne above;
O come, Thou Father of the poor;
O come, Thou source of all our
store;
Come, fill our hearts with love.
O Thou, of comforters the best:
O Thou, the soul’s delightful guest,
The pilgrim’s sweet relief;
Thou art true rest in toil and
sweat,
Refreshment in th’ excess of heat,
And solace in our grief.
Thrice-blessed Light, shoot home
Thy darts,
And pierce the centres of those
hearts
Whose faith aspires to Thee.
Without Thy Godhead nothing can
Have any price or worth in man,
Nothing can harmless be.


Lord, wash our sinful stains away,
Water from heaven our barren
clay,
Our wounds and bruises heal;
To Thy sweet yoke our stiff necks
bow,
Warm with Thy fire our hearts of
snow,
Our wand’ring feet repeal.
Grant to Thy faithful, dearest
Lord,
Whose only hope is Thy sure word,
The seven gifts of the Spirit;
Grant us in life Thy helping grace,
Grant us at death to see Thy face,
And endless joy inherit.
Have Mercy On Us, God Most
High.
Have mercy on us, God Most High!
Who lift our hearts to Thee;
Have mercy on us worms of earth,
Most holy Trinity!
Most ancient of all mysteries!
Before Thy throne we lie!
Have mercy now, most merciful,
Most holy Trinity!
When heaven and earth were yet
unmade,
When time was yet unknown,
Thou in Thy bliss and majesty
Didst live and love alone!
Thou wert not born; there was no
fount
From which Thy Being flowered;
There is no end which Thou canst
reach:
But Thou art simply God.
How wonderful creation is,
The work that Thou didst bless;
And, oh! what then must Thou be
like,
Eternal Loveliness ?

Jesus, My Lord, My God,
My All.
Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all!
How can I love Thee as I ought ?
And how revere this wondrous gift
So far surpassing hope or
thought ?
Sweet Sacrament! we Thee
adore!
O, make us love Thee more
and more!
Had I but Mary’s sinless heart
To love Thee with, my dearest
King,
O, with what bursts of fervent
praise
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I
sing!
Sweet Sacrament! etc.
0 see, within a creature’s hand
The vast Creator deigns to be,
Reposing, infant-like, as though
On Joseph’s arm, or Mary’s
knee.
Sweet Sacrament! etc.
Thy Body, Soul, and Godhead, all!
O mystery of love divine!
1 cannot compass all I have,
For all Thou hast and art are
mine!
Sweet Sacrament! etc.
Sound, sound His praises higher
still,
And come, ye angels, to our aid,
’Tis God, ’tis God! the very God,
Whose power both man and an-
gels made!
Sweet Sacrament! etc.
Soul Of My Saviour.
Soul of my Saviour, sanctify my
breast!
Body of Christ, be Thou my sav-
ing guest!
Blood of my Saviour, bathe me in
Thy tide!
Wash me, ye waters, gushing from
His side!
Strength and protection may His
passion be:
O blessed Jesus, hear and answer
me!
Deep in Thy wounds, Lord, hide
and shelter me;
So shall I never, never part from
Thee.
Guard and defend me from the foe
malign;
In death’s drear moments make
me only Thine;
Call me, and bid me come to Thee
on high,
When I may praise Thee with Thy
saints for aye.
The Blessed Sarrament
O Sacrament Most Holy.
O Sacrament Most Holy,
O Sacrament Divine;
All Praise and all thanksgiving
Be every moment Thine.
(Repeat 3 times).
In Blessed Silence Kneel.
In breathless silence kneel —
With trembling rapture feel—
The hour of grace is nigh.
Watch for the signal given;
As for a voice from heaven;
The Lord is standing by.
Chorus:
Hush! hush! break not the spell,
Jesus is here, our hearts know it
well;
Kneel! kneel! in love and fear,
Jesus is God, and Jesus is here.
Hark to the sound of the sanc-
tuary bell,
Telling of love burning for ever,
for ever, for ever!
Telling of love burning for ever,
for ever, for ever!


Stir not the silent air,
E’en by the words of prayer;
Breathe not too loud a sigh;
In your heart’s deep recess
Your fears, your hopes express,
Send up a speechless cry.
Mute be the organ’s strain;
Mans’ voice of praise is vain
When God is all in all.
Speak not, let words alone;
Be still, His presence own,
Before Him prostrate fall.
This is no common hour,
This is no human power,
God is among you now;
And each full heart may share
In Peter’s raptured prayer
On the lone mountain’s brow.
Jesus, Gentlest Saviour.
Jesus, gentlest Saviour!
God of might and power!
Thou Thyself are dwelling
In us at this hour.
Nature cannot hold Thee,
Heaven is all too straight
For Thine endless glory
And Thy royal state.
Out beyond the shining
Of the furthest star;
Thou art ever stretching
Infinitely far.
Yet the hearts of children
Hold what worlds cannot,
And the God of wonders
Loves the lowly spot.
As men to their gardens
Go to seek sweet flowers,
In our hearts dear Jesus
Seeks them at all hours.
Jesus, gentlest Saviour!
Thou art in us now;
Fill us full of goodness
Till our hearts o’erflow.
Pray the prayer within us
That to heaven shall rise;
Sing the song that angels
Sing above the skies.
Multiply our graces,
Chiefly love and fear,
Ah, dear Lord! the chiefest —
Grace to persevere.
Oh! how can we thank Thee
For a gift like this?
Gift that truly maketh
Heaven eternal bliss.
Ah, when wilt Thou always
Make our hearts Thy home?
We must wait for Heaven,
Then the day will come.
Now at least we’ll keep Thee
AJI the time we may—
But Thy grace and blessing
We will keep alway.
When our hearts Thou leavest,
Worthless though they be,
Give them to Thy Mother
To be kept for Thee.
Sweet Sacrament Divine.
Sweet Sacrament divine!
Hid in Thine earthly home,
Lo! round Thy lowly shrine,
With suppliant hearts we come,
Jesus, to Thee our voice we raise,
In songs of love and heartfelt
praise,
Sweet Sacrament divine!
Sweet Sacrament of Peace!
Dear home for every heart,
Where restless yearnings cease,
And sorrows all depart.
There in Thine ear, all trustfully
We tell our tale of misery,
Sweet Sacrament of Peace!
Sweet Sacrament of Rest!
Ark from the ocean’s roar,
Within Thy shelter blest,
Soon may we reach the shore.
Save us, for still the tempest
raves;
Save, lest we sink beneath the
waves;
Sweet Sacrament of Rest!


Sweet Sacrament divine!
Earth’s Light and Jubilee,
In Thy far depths doth shine
Thy Godhead’s Majesty.
Sweet Light, so shine on us, we
pray,
That earthly joys may fade away,
Sweet Sacrament divine.

(Chorus.)
O Bread of Heaven.
O Bread of Heaven beneath this
veil,
Thou dost my very God conceal;
My Jesus, dearest treasure hail
I love Thee and adoring kneel,
Each loving soul by Thee is fed
With Thy own self in form of
bread.
My dearest God who dost so bind
My heart with countless chains
to Thee;
O Sweetest love, my soul shall find
In Thy dear bonds, true liberty.
Thyself Thou hast bestowed on me;
Thine, Thine forever I will be.
Veni Jesu Domine.
Come, oh! come, my Jesus, come,
Make my poor cold heart Thy
home;
Come, but ere Thou come, prepare
For Thyself a dwelling theme.
Come, dear Lord, do not delay;

Make my heart a holy place,
Rich in faith and prayer and love,
Pure as happy Saints above;

How my soul doth yearn for Thee;
Come and place Thyself as seal,
On whate’er I do or feel;
Come to me, and with me stay;
Mane mecum Domine!

Altar,
Thou hast descended
O most loving Lord!
Caed Mile Failte, Caed Mile Failte,
Failte,
Caed Mile Failte,
My Lord and my God!
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus.
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, and in-
cense softly steals,
Each soul communing with its God
In lowly worship kneels.
He cometh forth with open hands
His treasures to impart,
Robed in the Eucharistic veil
That hides His Sacred, Sacred
Heart.
That hides His Sacred, Sacred
Heart.
O leave me not until Thou Bless
The loved for whom X pray,
And let this glimpse of Heaven’s
own joy
Around my spirit stay.
Come with me, Lord, to bear the
strife
That earthly shadows cast,
And let me see Thy unveiled face
Dear Lord, Dear Lord, in hea-
ven at last.


Jesus, Jesus, Come To Me.
Jesus, Jesus, come to me,
0 how much I sigh for Thee.
Come Thou, of all friends the best.
Take possession of my breast.
Chorus;
Comfort my poor soul dis-
tress’d,
Come and dwell within my
breast;
O! how oft I sigh for Thee.
Jesus, Jesus, come to me.
Empty is all worldy joy,
Ever mixed with some alloy;
Give me, my true Sovereign Good,
Jesus, Thy own Flesh and Blood
On the Cross three hours for me,
Thou didst hang in agony;
1 my heart to Thee resign,
O what rapture to be Thine!
Soul Of Jesus.
Soul of Jesus, make me holy,
Make me contrite, meek and lowly,
Blood of Jesus, Stream of life,
Sacred Stream with blessing rife.
Soul most stainless, Soul divine,
Cleanse this feeble soul of mine,
From Thy broken body shed
On that cross, that altar, dread.
Hallow this unholy soul,
Purify it, make it whole.
Blood most precious, Fount divine,
Fill my heart and make it Thine.
Soul of Jesus, hallow me,
Miserere Domine.
Blood of Christ my cleansing be,
Miserere Domine.
May Jesus Christ Be Praised.
When morning g'lds the skies,
My heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
Alike at work and prayer,
To Jesus I repair.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
The Sacred minster bell
It peals o’er hill and dale.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
Oh‘ hark to what it sings
As joyously it rings,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
When sleep her balm denies,
My silent spirit sighs,
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
When evil thoughts molest,
With this I shield my breast.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
May Jesus Christ be praised.
Christ The King.

Before Communion
Adoration and Faith.
Jesus! Thou art coming,
Holy as Thou art,
Thou, the God who made me,
To my sinful heart,
Jesus! I believe it,
On Thy only word!
Kneeling I adore Thee
As my King and Lord.
Humility and Sorrow.
Who am I, my Jesus,
That Thou com’st to me?
I have sinned against Thee,
Ofter, grievously.
I am very so'rry
I have caused Thee pain,
I will never, never
Wound Thy Heart again.
Love And Desire.
Dearest Lord, I love Thee,
With my whole, whole heart;
Not for what Thou givest,
But for what Thou art.

Come to me, and stay,
For I want Thee, Jesus,
More than I can say.
Offering And Petition.
Ah! what gift or present
Jesus, can X bring?
I have nothing worthy
Of my God and King.
But Thou art my good Shepherd
X, Thy little lamb;
Take myself, dear Jesus,
All, I have and am.
Trust.
Put Thy kind arms round me,
Feeble as I am,
Thou art my Good Shepherd,
I Thy little lamb.
Since Thou comest, Jesus,
Now to be my Guest,
I can trust you always,
Lord, for all the rest.
Suffer the Little Children.
Suffer the little children to come
unto me,
Forbid them, forbid them not,
For of such is the kingdom,
The kingdom of heaven.
Dearest Lord, across the ages
Thy sweet words to-day we hear,
And we gather round Thy Altar,
Undeterred by thought of fear.
We are children, sweetest Jesus,
And our hearts to Thee we give.
Keep us always pure and childlike,
All the years that we may live.
Suffer, etc.
Yes, dear Jesus, Thou art coming,
Coming to our hearts to-day.
And in reverence bowed before
Thee,
Keep us purs and good we pray.
Jesus dear, we know you love us,
Weak and feeble though we
may be,
And we pray our hearts may ever,
Overflow with love of Thee.
Suffer, etc.


The Eucharistic Heart of
Jesus.
Close veiled in that sweet Sacra-
ment,
Our Jesus’ Heart, our treasure
lies;
Love’s priceless, dearest testament
Is shrouded in that mystic guise.
Our Jesus left His realms of light
On wings of love to earth He’s
flown,
To dwell with us ’tis His delight,
He makes our heart His dearest
throne.
O Sacred Heart, how sweet
’twould be,
If we could die for love of
Thee.
Jesus In Thy Dear Sacrament.
Jesus in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy Face I never see,
But that sweet Face is pleading
In Thy Sacrament with me.
Jesus in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy Heart I never see,
But all Thy love is burning there
In Thy Sacrament with me.
Jesus in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy wounds I never see,
But those dear wounds are beam-
ing there,
That on Calvary bled for me.
Jesus in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy Cross I never see;
Thou crucified art offered there.
As Thou wert slain for me.
Jesus in Thy dear Sacrament
Thy Godhead none may see;
But Thou art present God and man
In Thy Sacrament with me.
The Blessed Sacrament.
Christ has descended, angels on
high,
Softly breathe o’er us, “Jesus is
nigh”;
The cherub, the seraph, in awe
lowly bend,
While Jesus the King of the Hea-
vens descends.
Jesus, Sweet Jesus, Mary’s own
Son,
We love and adore Thee, Thou
beautiful One.
Jesus, my Jesus, so priceless in
worth,
Joy of the angels, and hope of the
earth.
Strong are the links and the bonds
which confine
My heart and my soul to Thee
Jesus, all mine.
Jesus, Sweet Jesus, Mary’s own
Son,
We love and adore* Thee, Thou
beautiful One.
Come, My Jesus, I Am
Waiting.
Come, my Jesus, I am waiting,
Waiting for Thee here,
Full of love and ardent longing,
Banishing all fear.
Come to-day and come to-morrow,
Come each dawning day,
While the flood of life is flowing
Till it ebbs away.
Not an angel nor Thy mother
Could content me now.
None can satisfy my craving,
Jesus, only Thou.
Till my heart be still forever,
Till my voice be dumb,
Then with open arms to meet me,
Come, Lord Jesus, come.


O Jesus, God Of Light.
O Jesus, God of Light,
How in the darkest night
Bidest Thou here alone,
Not one before Thy throne
O could our cold, cold hearts,
Feel all Thy fiery darts,
Then would a night with Thee
Seem bright as day.
Love Tells the reason why,
Thou, Lord, art always nigh;
Come we to stay a while,
Angels can see Thy smile.
O may our hearts remain,
Singing their soft refrain,
And may Thy heart Divine
Warm our with love.
Nearer, Still Nearer.
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy
heart,
Draw me, my Saviour, so precious
Thou art.
Fold me, oh! fold me, close to Thy
breast,
Shelter me safe in that haven of
rest.
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I
bring,
Naught as an offering to Jesus my
King,
Only my sinful, now contrite heart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood
doth impart.
Nearer, still nearer, Lord to be
Thine,
Sin with its follies I gladly resign.
All of its pleasures, pomps, and its
pride,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord
crucified.
After Communion.
The Lord of Glory
(O wondrous story!)
Hath made His home within my
breast;
Bowed down before Him,
My soul adore Him,
Who ’neath thy roof vouchsafes to
rest.
Good angels aid me,
The God who made me,
Who died to save me, is now my
Guest;
Ah! softly sing Him
Sweet songs, and bring Him
Your burning love, your worship
blest.
Mass for Children
When The Priest Comes Out.
My dear Jesus, may I do all
For the love of you!
When The Priest Begins Mass.
In the Name of the Father, and
of the Sou, and of the Holy Ghost.
—Amen.
Now Jesus Christ’s true Flesh and
Blood,
Will be our Sacrifice Divine.
The same in Mass as on the Cross,
Though under form of bread and
wine.
We offer then the Holy Mass,
Thee our Creator to adore;
To thank Thee for Thy gracious
gifts,
And praise Thy name for ever-
more.
We pray for pardon, and for grace,
To change the lives that we have
led;
And beg Thee, for Thy Son’s dear
sake,
To bless the living and the dead.


At The Gloria In Excelsis.
Glory be to God on high!
Christ is born! the angels sing;
Christ the Lord, who came to die,
Peace unto the world to bring.
Thee, O God, we praise and bless;
Thee we thank, we Thee adore,
Jesus, Lord, we Thee confess,
King of Glory evermore.
Examination of Conscience.
Let us think of sins committed
In our actions, words and thoughts.
Act Of Contrition.
O my God, I am very sorry—
that I have sinned against Thee, —
because Thou art so good,—and I
will not sin again.
For The Conversion of
Sinners.
Let us pray for all poor sinners
That they may repent this day.
Hail Mary, —full of grace,—the
Lord is with thee, —blessed art
thou among women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus —
Holy Mary, mother of God, —pray
for us sinners, now—and at the
hour of our death. —Amen.
At The Gospel.
Let us with the Cross of Jesus
Sign our foreheads, lips, and
hearts.
Thy Gospel, Jesus, we believe,
And for Thy help we humbly
pray,
That we in thought and word, and
deed,
Thy Holy Gospel may obey.
When The Priest Says The
Creed.
I believe in God, the Father Al-
mighty, Creator of heaven and
earth; —and in Jesus Christ, His
only Son Our Lord —who was con-
ceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary;—suffered under
Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead,
and buried; —He descended into
hell; the third day He rose again
from the dead, —He ascended into
Heaven; sitteth at the right hand
of God the Father Almighty; from
thence He shall come to judge the
living and the dead. —I believe in
the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic
Church; the communion of
saints; the forgiveness of sins; —
the resurrection of the body;—and
life everlasting.—Amen.
At The Offering Of The Bread.
Father Almighty! Lord! receive
This Host, the Priest now offers
Thee;
And from our sins and countless
faults,
We humbly pray Thee, set us
free.
Though yet it is but earthly bread,
Christ’s living Flesh it will be
made.
At The Offering of the Wine.
The saving Chalice now is raised
Upon Thy mercy, Lord, we call,
Imploring for Sweet Jesus’ sake,
Grace and salvation upon all.
The mighty words of Christ this
wine
Will change into His Blood
Divine.


At The Washing Of The
Fingers.
Wash more and more, O Lord, our
souls
With water from Thy pierced
side;
And tears of sorrow from our
hearts,
Shall mingle with that sacred
tide.
At The Preface.
Lift up your hearts! Yes, let us
raise
Both heart and voice in grateful
praise,
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord, to
Thee,
Our God, most Blessed Trinity.
At The Sanctus.
With Angels and Archangels
bright,
Our voices humbly we unite;
And Holy, Holy, Holy, cry,
Thy glory fills the earth and sky,
Hosanna to the Lord Most High!
The Canon Of The Mass.
O God, be ever with Thy Church,
The Pope and all its Pastors
bless;
Bless every day our parents dear,
Give them eternal happiness.
We pray for all who want our
prayers,
To all poor sinners mercy show;
Ah! why should Jesus die in vain,
To save them from eternal woe ?
We praise Thy Saints, may they
for us
With Jesus kindly intercede;
May Mary pray her sweetest
prayer,
To help her children in their
need.
O God, 'tis now the solemn hour,
When bread and wine are truly
made
The flesh and blood of Jesus
Christ,
By words of Consecration said.
After The Elevation.
O Heavens, Earth; this wonder
hear,
What was but earthly bread and
wine,
By God Almighty’s wond’rous
power,
Is now Christ’s Flesh and Blood
Divine;
So God has said, so we believe,
The Word of God cannot deceive.
O Jesus, God, Creator, Judge,
Thee present, humbly we adore,
To Thee, in this great Sacrament,
Be praise and glory evermore.
May every tongue to Thee Confess,
May every heart Thy presence
bless.
Behold, O God, the precious Blood
Of Jesus on the altar lies;
O Father, hear, how Jesus’ Blood
For grace and mercy loudly
cries:
To thee it speaketh to forgive,
Forgive us then that we may live.
The holy Sacrifice of Mass
Assists the souls in Purgatory.
Through this most holy Sacrifice,
O God of Mercy, hear their cry.
May they receive eternal rest,
And with the light of heaven be
blest.
At the Pater Noster.
Our Father, Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy Name; —Thy
Kingdom come; —Thy Will be done


on earth as it is in Heaven. —Give
us this day our daily bread; —and
forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them that trespass against
us; —and lead us not into tempta-
tion; —hut deliver us from evil. —
Amen.
At The Agnus Dei.
Jesus Christ! true Lamb of God,
Who by Thy Blood doth take
away
The sins of all this guilty world,
Have mercy on us now, we pray.
O Jesus Christ! true Lamb of God,
Whose Blood upon the Cross did
flow
To purchase peace for sinful men,
Thy peace upon us now bestow.
At The Domine Non Sum
Dignus.
O Lord, I am not worthy
That Thou should’st come to me;
Speak but one word of comfort,
My spirit healed shall be.
At The Communion.
In this Sacrament, sweet Jesus,
Thou dost give Thy flesh and
blood,
With Thy soul and Godhead also
As our own most precious food.
Yes, dear Jesus, I believe it,
And Thy presence I adore;
And with all my heart I love Thee,
May I love Thee more and more!
Come, sweet Jesus, in Thy mercy,
Give Thy flesh and blood to me;
Come to me, O dearest Jesus,
Come, my soul’s true life to be.
Come, that I may live for ever
Thou in me and I in Thee,
Living thus, I shalj not perish,
But shall live eternally.
Blessed be the love of Jesus,
Giving us His flesh and blood;
Blessed be His Mother Mary,
Mother ever kind and good.
Blessed be the Great St. Joseph,
Sing them with devotion true:
Dearest Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
Heart and soul I give to you.
At The Last Gospel.

ij( hearts. ■
Thanksgiving.
Great God, we thank Thee for the
grace,
Of hearing Holy Mass this day,
On Sundays may we always come
To hear the Holy Mass and pray.
Then may the grace of Holy Mass
Be with us still in all our need,
And keep us from the stain of sin
In every thought, and word, and
deed.
In the name of the Father, —
and of the Son, —and of the Holy
Ghost. —Amen.

The Holy Heart of Jesus
Sweet Heart of Jesus, Fount
of Love.
Sweet Heart of Jesus, fount of
love and mercy,
To-day we come Thy blessing to
implore;
Oh, touch our hearts, so cold and
so ungrateful,
And make them, Lord, Thine
own for evermore.
Chorus;
Sweet Heart of Jesus, we im-
plore,
Oh, make us love Thee more
and more.
Sweet Heart of Jesus, make us
know and love Thee,
Unfold to us the treasures of
Thy grace,
That so our hearts, from things
of earth uplifted,
Hay long alone to gaze upon
Thy Face.
Sweet Heart of Jesus! make us
pure and gentle,
And teach us how to do Thy
blessed will;
To follow close the print of Thy
dear footsteps,
And when we fall —Sweet Heart,
oh, love us still.
Sweet Heart of Jesus! bless all
hearts that love Thee,
And may Thine own Heart ever
blessed be,
Bless us, dear Lord, and bless the
friends we cherish,
And keep us true to Mary and
to Thee.
To Jesus’ Heart All Burning.
To Jesus’ Heart all burning,
With fervent love for men,
My heart with fondest yearning,
Shall raise the joyful strain.


Chorus:
While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus,
By every heart and tongue.
0 Heart for me on fire,
With love no man can speak,
My yet untold desire
God gives me for Thy sake.
Too true I have forsaken
Thy flock by wilful sin;
Yet now let me be taken
Back to Thy fold again
As Thou art meek and lowly
And ever pure of Heart,
So may my heart be wholly
Of Thine the counterpart.
1 Need Thee, Precious Jesus.
I need Thee, Heart of Jesus,
I need a friend like Thee;
A friend to soothe and pity,
A friend to care for me.
I need Thy Heart, sweet Jesus,
To feel each anxious care;
I long to tell my every want,
And all my sorrows share.
I need Thy Blood, sweet Jesus,
To wash each sinful stain;
To cleanse this sinful soul of mine,
And make it pure again.
I need Thy Wounds, sweet Jesus,
To fly from perils near,
To shelter in these hallowed clefts,
From every doubt and fear.
I need Thee, sweetest Jesus,
In Thy sacrament of Love;
To nourish this poor soul of mine,
With the treasures of Thy Love.
I’ll need Thee, sweetest Jesus,
When death’s dread hour draws
nigh,
To hide me in Thy Sacred Heart,
Till wafted safe on high.
I Rise From Dreams of Time.
I rise from dreams of time
And an angel guides my feet
To the Sacred Altar Throne
Where Jesus’ Heart doth beat,
To the Sacred Altar Throne
Where Jesus’ Heart doth beat.
The lone Lamp softly burns
And wondrous silence reigns
Only with a low still voice
The Holy One complains,
Only with a low still voice
The Holy One complains.
Ever pleading day and night,
Thou can’st not from us part,
O veil’d and wondrous Son,
O love of the Sacred Heart,
O veil’d and wondrous Son,
O love of the Sacred Heart.
Heart of Jesus, Sacred Heart.
Heart of Jesus, Sacred Heart,
Praise to Thee for all Thou art!
Spring of grace, the Godhead’s
shrine,
Throne of Glory, Heart Divin’e,
Heart, whom angel hosts adore,
Would that men would praise Thee
more!
Chorus:
Heart of our Saviour! Heart of
our Friend!
Heart that hast loved Thine own
to the end!
Heart of our King! Heart of
our Lord!
Be Thou for ever, loved and
adored!
Heart of Jesus, Human Heart,
Thanks to Thee for all Thou art!
Where should we have been, or be,
Fount of Goodness, but for Thee?
Heart so full of love for us,
Would that we could love Thee
thus!


Heart so holy, Heart so pure,
Heart so patient to endure,
Heart that all our sins hast borne,
Bruised, humbled, crushed, forlorn,
Heart which we have wrung with
pain,
Be Thou never wronged again.
Heart still beating in the Host,
Where, alas! we wrong Thee most!
Heart so noble, Heart so true,
Pierced by all, consoled by few,
Lonely Heart, so loving men,
Would that Thou wert loved again!
Heart so pitiful to heal,
Tender Heart so quick to feel,
Heart so ready to forgive,
Heart so grateful to receive
Sea of love without a shore,
Be Thou loved and trusted more!
Heart of Jesus, broken Heart,
Praise and thanks for all Thou art!
Shelter in the noonday heat,
Covert when the rain doth beat.
Home where all find peace and
rest,
Be Thou known and loved and
blest!
Nearer, My God, To Thee.
Nearer my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
E’en tho’ it be a cross
That raiseth me.
Still all my prayer shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
Deep in Thy Sacred Heart
Let me abide,
Thou that hast bled for me,
Sorrowed and died;
Sweet shall my weeping be,
Grief surely leading me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
Friends may depart from me,
Night may come down,
Clouds of adversity
Darken and frown;
Still through my tears I’ll see
Hope gently leading me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
And when the goal is won,
How like a dream,
In the dim retrospect,
Sorrow will seem.
Sweet will my transports be,
Jesus, Thy face to see,
When I have come at last,
Nearer to Thee.
O Jesus Open Wide Thy
Heart.
0 Jesus, open wide Thy Heart,
And let me rest therein;
For weary is my stricken soul
Of sorrow and of sin.
I’ve sought for rest, but found it
not,
In things of earthly mould;
1 pine to love and be beloved
By that Heart that grows not
cold.
Jesus, dear Lord,
There is no Heart like Thine.
O changeless Heart, meek, patient,
mild,
My soul to Thee I turn;
Thou wilt not crush the bruised
reed,
The sorrowing spirit spurn.
O Mary, by that priceless love,
Which Jesus’ Heart bore thee;
Pray that my home in life and
death
That loving Heart may be.
Jesus, dear Lord,
There is no Heart like Thine.


O Sacred Heart, All Blissful
Light of Heaven.
O Sacred Heart! all blissful light
of Heaven,
Rapture of Angels, beaming
ever bright—
Ravishing joys, in rich and radiant
splendour,
Flow from Thy glory in torrents
of delight.
O Sacred Heart! O hope of sin-
ner’s sorrow,
Rest of the weary, careworn,
and depressed;
Sweetly lead home earth’s lone es-
tranged exiles,
Where ’neath Thy love we may
lie down and rest.
O Sacred Heart! Thy light is soft-
ly rising
O’er the dark night of England’s
cheerless gloom;
Bright dawns the day of Faith’s
undying glory,
Sweetly Thou seekest a loved
but long-lost home.
O Sacred Heart! as strain of soft-
est rapture,
Sweet falls the music of that
voice so blest:
“Come unto Me, all ye who mourn
and labour,
Come, heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.”
O Sacred Heart; when shades of
death are falling,
Gather Thy children ’neath the
wings of love;
Hush us to rest in Thine own
gentle mercy,
Bear troubled spirits to brighter
realms above.
| O Sacred Heart! what bliss, what
thrilling rapture,
E’er to rest near Thee on Thine
own bright shore;
Ever to gaze upon Thy beaming
splendour,
Never to part to weep, to
mourn no more.
O Sacred Heart, What Shall I
Render Thee.
O Sacred Heart! what shall I ren-
der Thee
For all the gifts Thou hast be-
stowed on me ?
O Heart of God! Thou seem’st but
to implore
That I should love Thee daily
more and more.
Chorus:
Then I will love Thee, then I
will love Thee,
Then X will love Thee daily
more and more.
O Heart of Jesus! come and live
in me,
That with Thy love my heart con-
sumed may be;
O Sacred Heart of Jesus! I implore
That I may love Thee daily more
and more.
O Sacred Heart! be this our life’s
one aim
To labour for the glory of Thy
Name;
O dearest Heart! this grace we
Thee implore
That all the world may know and
love Thee more.
Dear Sacred Heart! in life’s last
awful hour
Oh, let us feel Thy love’s almighty
power;
Oh, then o’er all this grace we
Thee implore
That we may love and trust Thee
more and more.


O Sacred Heart! the sunshine of
our days,
Be Thine the songs of everlasting
praise,
Whose strains shall break on the
Eternal Shore,
Where we shall love and praise
Thee evermore.
Oh, Take Me To Thy Sacred
Heart.
Oh, take me to Thy Sacred Heart
And seal the entrance o’er,
That from that home this weary
heart
May never wander more.
Chorus:
Yes! Jesus take me to Thyself,
I’m weary waiting here,
I long to lean upon Thy breast,
To see, to feel Thee near.
O Jesus, open wide Thy Heart
And let me rest therein,
For weary is my stricken soul
Of sorrow and of sin.
0 Jesus’ Heart, meek, patient,
kind,
My soul to Thee doth turn.
Thou would’st not crush the
bruised reed,
The sorrowing spirit spurn.
I’ve sought for rest and found it
not
In things of earthly mould;
1 pine to love and to be loved
By that Heart that grows not
cold.
Oh, Mary, by the priceless love
Which Jesus' Heart bore thee,
Pray that my home in life and
death
That loving Heart may be.
O Sacred Heart, Our Hope
Lies Deep In Thee.
O Sacred Heart!
Our Hope lies deep in thee,
On earth'thou art an exile’s rest,
In heaven the glory of the blest,
O Sacred Heart.
O Sacred Heart!
Thou fount of contrite tears,
Where’er those living waters
flow,
New life to sinners they bestow,
O Sacred Heart.
O Sacred Heart!
Our trust is all in thee;
For tho’ earth’s night be dark
and drear,
Thou breathest rest when thou
art near,
O Sacred Heart.
O Sacred Heart!
When shades of death shall fall,
Receive us ’neath thy gentle
care,
And save us from the tempter’s
snare,
O Sacred Heart.
O Sacred Heart!
Lead exiled children home,
Where we may ever rest near
Thee
In peace and joy eternally,
O Sacred Heart.
Hymn To The Sacred Heart.
A message from the Sacred Heart!
What may its message be?
My child, My child, give Me thy
heart,
My Heart had bled for thee.
This is the message Jesus sends
To my poor heart to-day,
And eager from His Throne He
bends
To hear what I shall say.


A message to the Sacred Heart!
Oh, bear it back with speed,
Come, Jesus, reign within my
heart,
Thy Heart is all I need.
Thus, Lord, I’ll pray until I share
That home whose joy Thou art.
No message, dearest Jesus, there —
For heart will speak to heart.
Invocations.
Heart of Jesus, Heart of Jesus,
Burning with love for me,
Inflame my heart, infllame my
heart
With love, with love for Thee.
Hymn To The Sacred Heart.
O Sacred Heart of Jesus,
I place my trust in Thee,
Whatever may befall me, Lord,
Though dark the hour may be;
In all my joys, in all my woes,
Though naught but grief I see,
O Sacred Heart of Jesus,
I place my trust in Thee.
When those I love have passed
away,
And I am sore distressed,
O Sacred Heart of Jesus,
I cry to Thee for rest;
In all my trials, great and small,
My confidence shall be
Unshaken as I cry, dear Lord,
I place my trust in Thee.
This is my own sweet prayer, dear
Lord,
My faith, my trust, my love,
But most of all, in that last hour,
When death points up above.
Ah! then, Sweet Saviour, may Thy
face
Smile on my soul set free,
Oh! may I cry with rapturous
love:
“I place my trust in Thee!”
Sacred Heart In Accents
Burning.
Sacred Heart in accents burning
Pour we forth our love for Thee;
Here our hopes and here our
yearning
Meet and mingle tenderly.
Heart of Mercy ever eager
All our woes and wounds to heal,
Heart most patient, Heart most
pure,
To our souls our depths reveal,
Sacred Heart of our Redeemer,
Pierced with love on Calvary,
Heart of Jesus, ever loving,
Make us bum with love of Thee.
Praise to thee, Sacred Heart.
All For Thee, O Heart Of
Jesus.
All for Thee, O Heart of Jesus,
All for Thee eternally;
Nought for me, O Heart of Jesus,
Save to be beloved by Thee.
Thou hast taught me in my sor-
row,
Where alone the heart finds rest.
I have learned ’tis sweet to suffer,
Pillowed on Thy Sacred
Breast —
Pillowed on Thy Sacred
Breast.
Take from me, O Heart of Jesus,
All that holds me back from
Thee,
Was the prayer I long since whis-
pered;
Well, full well, Thou’st answered
me.
Every hope once fondly cherished
One by one I’ve seen depart,
Then earth had for me no sun-
shine
Save alone Thy Sacred
Heart—
Save alone Thy Sacred
Heart,


All for Thee, O Heart of Jesus,
All for Thee, in life and death;
All for Thee, dear Heart of Jesus,
Till my latest dying breath.
All for Thee in joy or sorrow,
Be my soul’s unceasing song;
All for Thee my song unending
As eternity rolls on —
As eternity rolls on.
O Sacred Heart! O Love
Divine.
O Sacred Heart! O Love Divine
Do keep us near to Thee,
And make our Hearts so like to
Thine
That we may holy be.
Chorus;
Heart of Jesus hear!
O Heart of Love Divine.
Listen to our Prayer,
Make us always Thine.
0 wounded Heart, O Font of tears!
O Throne of grief and pam!
Whereon for the eternal years,
Thy love for man does reign.
Ungrateful hearts, forgetful hearts,
The hearts of men have;been,
To wound Thy side with cruel
darts
Which they have made by sin.
Thou Art My Hope, Dear
Sacred Heart.
Thou art my hope, dear Sacred
Heart, in all my lonely
hours,
When dead and scentless on my
path are life’s most precious
flowers.
Then Heart of Jesus, full of love, I
hear thee beating near.
1 hear Thee whisper, “Weary soul
thy sweetest hope is here.”
Dear Sacred Heart.
Thou art my shield, O Sacred
Heart, for in temptation’s
hour,
I feel my soul grow faint and
weak before an evil power.
But, calling on Thy Blessed Name,
my soul grows strong again.
I cling to Thee, sweet Sacred
Heart, and Satan’s powers
are vain.
Dear Sacred Heart.
What Voice Doth Say.
What voice doth say, “Behold this
heart,”
In tender, pleading tone?
This Heart which loveth men so
much
And beats for them alone.
What dost Thou ask, my dearest
Lord,
What seekest Thou from me?
What have I Thou wouldst deign
to take,
What can I offer Thee?
Now sweetly falls that voice
Divine,
That thrills with fiery dart,
And pierces through my very soul
“My child give Me thy heart.”
Oh! Heart by angels’ hosts adored,
Our lives were made for Thee.
Oh! take them now and keep them,
Lord,
For all eternity.
Our Blessed Lady
Ave Maria, O Maiden, O
Mother.

Fondly thy children are calling

Daily Daily, Sing To Mary.
Daily, daily, sing to Mary,
Sing, my soul, her praises due,
All her feasts, her actions worship,
With the heart’s devotion true.
Lost in wond’ring contemplation,
Be her majesty confess’d;
Call her mother, call her virgin.
Happy mother, Virgin blest.
She is mighty to deliver,
Call her, trust her lovingly;
When the tempest rages round
thee,
She will calm the troubled sea.
Gifts of heaven she has given,
Noble lady, to our race;
She the Queen, who decks her
subjects
With the light of God’s own
grace.
Sing my tongue, the Virgin’s
trophies,
Who for us the Maker bore,
For the curse of old inflicted,
Peace and blessing to restore.
Sing in songs of praise unending,
Sing the world’s majestic queen,
Weary not, nor faint in telling,
AH the gifts she gives to man.
All my senses, heart, affections,
Strive to show her glory forth;
Spread abroad the sweet memorials
Of the Virgin’s priceless worth.
Where the voice of music thrilling,
Where the tongue of eloquence,
That can utter hymns beseeming
All her matchless excellence ?
All our joys do flow from Mary,
All then join her praise to sing;
Trembling sing the Virgin Mother,
Mother of our Lord and King.
While we sing her awful glory,
Far above our fancy’s reach,
Let our hearts be quick to offer
Love alone the heart can teach.
Hail, Heavenly Queen.
Hail, heavenly Queen! Hail, foamy
ocean star!
O be our guide, diffuse thy beams
afar;
Hail, Mother of God! above all
virgins blest,
Hail happy gate of hev’n’s eter-
nal rest.


Chorus:
Hail, foamy ocean star! Hail,
heav’nly Queen!
O be our guide to endless joys
unseen.
“Hail, full of grace,’’ with Gabriel
we repeat:
Thee, Queen of heav’n from him
we learn to greet;
Then give us peace which heav’n
alone can give,
And dead thro’ Eve, thro’ Mary
let us live.
O break our chains, our captive
souls release;
O give us light, and let our dark-
ness cease;
Let ev’ry ill that preys upon our
hearts,
Fly at thy voice which every good
imparts.
Our lives unstain’d, in purity pre-
serve;
Nor e’er permit our ways from
truth to swerve,
That when our time has rolled its
rapid round,
We may with Christ, in heav’nly
bliss be crown’d.
Hail, Queen Of Heaven.
Hail, Queen of heav’n the ocean
Star,
Guide of the wanderer here be-
low!
Thrown on life’s surge we claim
thy care,
Save us from peril and from woe.
Mother of Christ, Star of the sea,
Pray for the wanderer, pray for
me!
O gentle, chaste and spotless Maid,
We sinners make our prayers
thro’ thee;
Remind thy Son that He has paid
The price of our iniquity.
Virgin most pure, Star of the sea,
Pray for the sinner, O pray for
me!
Sojourners in this vale of tears,
To thee, blest Advocate, we cry,
Pity our sorrows, calm our fears,
And soothe with hope our
misery.
Refuge in grief, Star of the sea,
Pray for the mourner, O pray
for me!
And while to Him who reigns
above,
In God-head One, in persons
Three,
The source of life, of grace, of
love,
Homage we pay on bended
knee —•
Do thou, bright queen, Star of the
sea,
Pray for thy children, pray for
me!
Holy Mary, Mother Mild.
Holy Mary, Mother mild,
O sweetest Mother!
Hear, O hear thy feeble child,
O sweetest Mother!
Chorus:
Praise her, O ye Cherubim!
Love her, O ye Seraphim!
Praise her, love her! . .
Oh! praise our spotless Mother,
Toss’d upon life’s stormy sea,
O dearest Mother!
Cast thy tender eyes on me,
O dearest Mother!
Brightest in the courts above,
O fairest Mother!
Joy of Angels, Queen of love,
O fairest Mother!
Maiden Mother, hear our prayer,
O purest Mother!
Prove to us thy loving care,
O purest Mother!
When the sands of life are run,
O loving Mother!
Show to us thy Blessed Son,
O loving Mother!


I’ll Sing A Hymn To Mary.
I’ll sing a hymn to Mary,
The Mother of my God,
The Virgin of all virgins,
Of David’s Royal blood;
O teach me, holy Mary,
A loving song to frame,
When wicked men blaspheme thee,
To love and bless thy name.
O Lily of the Valley,
O mystic Rose, what tree
Or flower e’en the fairest,
Is half so fair as thee?
O let me, tho’ so lowly,
Recite my Mother’s fame;
When wicked men blaspheme thee,
I’ll love and bless thy name.
O noble tower of David,
Of gold and ivory,
The ark of God’s own promise,
The gate of heaven to me.
To live and not to love thee
Would fill my soul with shame,
When wicked men blaspheme thee.
I’ll love and bless thy name.
When troubles dark afflict me,
In sorrow and in care,
Thy light doth ever guide me,
O bounteous morning star.
So I’ll be ever ready,
Thy goodly help to claim,
When wicked men blaspheme thee,
To love and bless thy name.
The saints are high in glory,
With golden crowns so bright;
But brighter far is Mary
Upon her throne of light.
Oh that which God did give thee.
Let mortal ne’er disclaim;
When wicked men blaspheme thee,
I’ll love and bless thy name.
But in the crown of Mary
There lies a wondrous gem,
As Queen of all the Angels,
Which Mary shares with them.
“No sin hath e’er defiled thee,”
So doth our faith proclaim;
When wicked men blaspheme thee,
I’ll love and bless thy name.
And now, O Virgin Mary,
My Mother and my Queen,
I’ve sung thy praise—so bless me,
And keep my heart from sin.
When others jeer and mock thee,
I’ll often think how I,
To shield my Mother Mary,
Would lay me down and die.
Look Down, O Mother Mary.
Look down, O Mother Mary,
From thy bright throne above,
Cast down upon thy children
One only glance of love.
And if a heart so tender,
With pity flows not o’er,
Then turn away, O Mother,
And look on us no more.
See how ingrate and guilty,
We stand before thy Son;
His loving heart reproaches
The evil we have done.
But if thou wilt appease Him,
Speak for us but one word;
Thou only canst obtain us
The pardon of our Lord.
O Mary, dearest Mother,
If thou wouldst have us live,
Say we are thy children,
And then He will forgive.
Our sins make us unworthy
That title still to bear;
But thou art still our Mother,
Then show a Mother’s care.
Open to us thy mantle,
There stay we without fear;
What evil can befall us,
If, Mother, thou art near?
Oh, sweetest, dearest Mother,
Thy sinful children save;
Look down on us with pity,
Who thy protection crave.


Mary, Dearest Mother.
Mary! dearest Mother!
From thy heavenly height
Look on us, thy children,
Lost in earth’s dark night.
Mary! purest creature!
Keep us all from sin;
Help us, erring mortals,
Peace in Heaven to win.
Mary! Queen and Mother!
Get us still more grace,
With still greater fervour
Now to run our race.
Daughter of the Father!
Lady kind and sweet!
Lead us to our Father,
Leave us at His feet.
Mother of our Saviour,
Joy of God above!
Jesus bade thee keep us
In His fear and love.
Mary! Spouse and servant
Of the Holy Ghost!
Keep for Him His creatures
Who would else be lost.
Holy Queen of angels!
Bid thine angels come
To escort us safely
To our heavenly home.
Bid the saints in Heaven
Pray for us their prayers,
They are thine, dear Mother!
That thou mayest be theirs.
Mary, How Sweetly Falls
That Word.
Mary! how sweetly falls that word,
On my enraptured ear;
Oft do I breathe in accents low,
That sound when none are near.
Chorus:
Sing, O my lips and loudly pro-
claim,
O Mary, how sweet is thy name.
Sweet as the warbling of a bird,
Sweet as a mother’s voice,
So sweet to me is that dear name,
It makes my soul rejoice.
Bright as the glittering stars ap-
pear,
Bright as the moonbeams shine,
So bright in my mind’s eye is seen
Thy loveliness divine!
Through thee I offer my requests;
And when my prayer is done,
In ecstasy sublime I see
Thee seated near thy Son.
Mother Dearest, Mother
Fairest.
Mother dearest, Mother fairest,
Help of all who call on thee,
Virgin purest, brightest, rarest,
Help us, help, we cry to thee.
Chorus:
Mary help us, help we pray,
Help us in all care and sorrow;
Hary help us, help we pray.
Lady, help in pain and sorrow,
Soothe those rack’d on bed of
pain;
May the golden light of morrow
Bring them health and joy again.
Help our priests, our virgins holy,
Help our Pope, long may he
reign,
Pray that we who sing thy praises,
May in heav’n all meet again.
Mother of Christ.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I ask of Thee?
I do not sigh for the wealth of
earth,
For the joys that fade and flee;
But, Mother of Christ, Mother of
Christ,
This do I long to see,
The Bliss untold which Thine arms
enfold
The Treasure upon Thy knee.


Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
He was All-in-all to Thee —
In the Winter’s Cave, in Naza-
reth’s Home
In the hamlets of Galilee.
So, Mother of Christ, Mother of
Christ,
He will not say nay to Thee;
When He lifts His face to Thy
sweet embrace,
Speak to Him, Mother, of me.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
The world will bid Him flee—
Too busy to heed His gentle voice,
Too blind His charms to see—
Then Mother of Christ, Mother of
Christ,
Come with Thy Babe to me,
Tho’ the world be cold, my heart
shall hold
A shelter for Him and Thee.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I do for Thee?
I will love Thy Son with the whole
of my strength,
My only King shall He be.
Yes, Mother of Christ, Mother of
Christ,
This will I do for Thee,
Of all that are dear or cherished
here,
None shall be dear as He.
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
I toss on a stormy sea,
O lift Thy Child as a Beacon-light
To the Port where I fain would
be,
And Mother of Christ, Mother of
Christ,
This do I ask of Thee,
When the voyage is o’er, O stand
on the shore,
And show Him at last to me.
Mother, Mary, At Thine Altar.
Mother Mary, at thine altar
We thy loving children kneel;
With a faith that cannot falter
To thy goodness we appeal.
We are seeking for a Mother
O’er the earth so vast and wide;
And from off the Cross our Bro-
ther
Points to Mary by His side.
Thou wilt love us, thou wilt guide
us
With a mother’s fondest care;
And our Father, God above us,
Bids us fly for refuge there.
Life’s temptations are before us,
We must mingle in the strife;
If thy fondness watch not o’er us
All unsafe will be our life.
So we take thee for our Mother,
And we claim the right to be,
By the gift of our dear Brother,
Loving children unto thee;
And our humble consecration
Thou wilt surely not despise,
From thy high and lofty station
Close to Jesus in the skies.
Mother Mary, to thy keeping
We ourselves to thee confide,
Toiling, resting, waking, sleeping,
To be ever by thy side,
Cares that vex us, joys that please
us,
Life and death we trust to thee;
Thou wilt make them all for Jesus,
And for all eternity.
Mother Of Mercy, Day By
Day.
Mother of mercy, day by day,
My love of thee grows more and
more,
Thy gifts are strewn upon my
way,
Like sands upon the great sea-
shore.


Thy love for me, I know its worth,
Oh, it is all in all to me;
For what did Jesus love on earth
One half so tenderly as thee.
Get me the grace to love thee
more,
Jesus will give if thou will
plead;
And Mother, when life’s cares are
o’er,
Oh, I shall love thee then indeed.
Jesus when His three hours were
run,
Bequeathed thee from the Cross
to me,
And oh, how can I love thy Son,
Sweet Mother, if I love not thee ?
O Flower Of Grace.
O Flower of Grace! divinest Flow-
er!
God’s light thy light, God’s love
thy dower!
That all alone with virgin ray
Dost make in Heaven eternal May,
Sweet falls the peerless dignity
Of God’s eternal choice on thee.
Chorus;
Mother dearest! Mother fairest!
Maiden purest! Maiden rarest!
Help of earth and joy of heaven!
Love and praise to thee be given,
Blissful Mother! Blissful Maiden!
Choice Flower! that bloomest on
the breast
Of Jesus which is now thy rest,
As thine was once the chosen bed
Of His dear Heart, and sacred
Head,
O Mary! sweet it is to see
Thy Son’s creation graced by thee!
O queenly Flower, enthroned
above,
A trophy of Almighty love!
Ah me! how He hath hung thee
round
With all love-tokens that abound
With God’s own light—Beyond the
reach
Of Angel song, or mortal speech!
O Flower of God! divinest Flower!
Elected for His inmost bower!
Where angels come not, there art
thou,
A crown of glory on thy brow;
While far below, all bright and
brave,
Their gleamy palms, the ransomed
wave.
Yet thou didst bloom on earth at
first,
In meekness proved, in sorrow
nursed;
And heaven must own its debt to
earth,
Sweet Flower, for thy surpassing
worth;
And angels for their Queen’s dear
sake,
Our road to thee more smooth
shall make.
O help of Christians! mercy laden!
O blissful Mother! blissful Maiden!
O sinless! were it not for thee,
There were in faith no liberty,
To hold that God could stoop so
low,
Or love bis sinful creatures so.
O Mary, when we think of thee,
Our hearts grow light as light can
be!
For thou hast felt as we have felt,
And thou hast knelt as we have
knelt—
And so it is that utterly,
Mother of God, we trust in thee!


O Mary, My Mother.
0 Mary, my Mother, most loving,
most mild,
Look down upon me, your poor
weak lowly child:
From the land of my exile I call
upon thee;
Then Mary, my Mother, look kind-
ly on me.
Chorus:
O Mary, in pity look down upon
me;
’Tis the voice of thy child that
is calling on thee.
If thou shouldst forsake me, ah!
where shall I go?
My comfort and hope in this val-
ley of woe!
When the world and its dangers
with terror I see,
Sweet hopes come to cheer me in
pointing to thee.
In sorrow, in darkness be still at
my side,
My light and my refuge, my guard
and my guide;
Though snares should surround
me, yet why should I fear?
1 know I am weak, but my Mother
is near.
O Mother Blest.
O Mother blest, whom God bestows
On sinners and on just,
What joy, what hope thou givest
those
Who in thy mercy trust!
Chorus;
Thou art clement, thou art
chaste,
Mary, thou art fair;
Of all mothers sweetest, best;
None with thee compare.
O heavenly Mother, Mistress
sweet!
It never yet was told
That suppliant sinner left thy
feet
Unpitied, unconsoled.
O Mother, pitiful and mild,
Cease not to pray for me;
For I do love thee as a child,
And sigh for love of thee.
Most powerful Mother, all men
know
Thy Son denies thee nought;
Thou askest, wishest it, and lo!
His power thy will has wrought.
O Mother blest, for me obtain,
Ungrateful though I be,
To love that God who first could
deign
To show such love for me.
O Turn To Jesus.
O turn to Jesus, Mother! turn,
And call Him by His tenderest
names;
Pray for the Holy Souls that burn
This hour amid the cleansing
flames.
Ah! they have fought a gallant
fight:
In death’s cold arms they per-
severed ;
And after life’s uncheery night,
The harbour of their rest is
neared.
In pains beyond all earthly pains,
Favourites of Jesus! there they
lie
Letting the fire wear out their
stains
And worshipping God’s purity.
Spouses of Christ they are, for He
Was wedded to them by His
Blood;
And angels o’er their destiny
In wondering adoration brood.


They are the children of thy tears;
Then hasten, Mother, to their
aid;
In pity think each hour appears
An age while glory is delayed.
Ah me! the love of Jesus yearns
O’er the abyss of sacred pain,
And, as He looks, His bosom burns
With Calvary’s dear thirst again.
O Mary, let thy Son no more
His lingering Spouses thus ex-
pect;
God’s children to their God restore,
And to the Spirit His elect.
Immaculate.
O Mother! I could weep for mirth,
Joy fills my heart so fast;
My soul to-day is heaven on earth,
Oh, could the transport last.
Chorus:
I think of thee, and what thou
art,
Thy majesty, thy state,
And I keep singing in my heart,
Immaculate! Immaculate!
When Jesus looks upon thy face
His heart with rapture glows,
And in the Church, by His sweet
grace,
Thy blessed worship grows.
The angels answer with their
songs,
Bright choirs in gleaming rows;
And saints flock round thy feet in
throngs
And heaven with bliss o’erflows;
O, I would rather, Mother dear,
Thou should’st be what thou art,
Than sit where thou dost, oh, so
near,
Unto the Sacred Heart.
Oh, I would forfeit all for thee,
Rather than thou should miss
One jewel from thy majesty,
One glory from thy bliss.
Ah! I could die with such a sense,
It were but loss to live,
If I could die in dear defence
Of this prerogative.
Conceived, conceived Immaculate!
Oh, what a joy for thee!
Conceived, conceived Immaculate!
Oh, greater joy for me.
Immaculate Conception! far
Above all graces blest!
Thou shinest like a royal star
On God’s eternal breast!
God prosper thee, my Mother dear,
God prosper thee, my Queen!
God prosper His own glory here,
As it has ever been!
O Purest Of Creatures.
O purest of creatures! Sweet Mo-
ther! Sweet Maid!
The one spotless womb wherein
Jesus was laid!
Dark night hath come down on us,
Mother! and we
Look out for thy shining, sweet
Star of the Sea!
Deep night hath come down on
this rough-spoken world,
And the banners of darkness are
boldly unfurled;
And the tempest-tossed Church—
all her eyes are on thee,
They look to thy shining, sweet
Star of the Sea.
The Church does what God had
first taught us to do;
He looked o’er the world to find
hearts that were true;
Through ages He looked, but He
found none but thee;
And He loved thy dear shining,
sweet Star of the Sea.


He gazed on thy soul, it was spot-
less and fair;
For the empire of sin, it had never
been there,
None had e’er owned thee, dear
Mother! but He —
And he blest thy clear shining,
sweet Star of the Sea.
Earth gave Him one lodging, ’twas
deep in thy breast;
And God found a home where the
sinner finds rest;
His home and His hiding-place
both were in thee;
He was won by thy shining, sweet
Star of the Sea.
O blissful and calm was the won-
derful rest
That thou gavest thy God in thy
virginal breast;
For the Heaven He left, He found
Heaven in thee;
And He shone in thy shining, sweet
Star of the Sea.
O shine on us brighter than ever,
then shine;
For the primest of honors, dear
Mother! is thine;
“Conceived without sin,” thy new
title shall be,
Clear light from thy birth spring,
sweet Star of the Sea.
Rose Of The Cross.
Rose of the Cross! thou Mystic
Flower
I lift my heart to thee;
In every melancholy hour,
Mary, remember me!
Let me but stand where thou hast
stood
Beside the crimson tree;
And by the Water and the Blood.
Mary, remember me!
There let me wash my sinful soul
And be from sin set free;
Drawn by thy love, by grace made
whole,
Mary, remember me!
Rose of the Cross! thou thornless
flower,
May I thy follower be;
And when temptation wields its
power,
Mary, remember me!
Lead me for ever to adore
The glorious One in Thee;
And while I tremble more and
more,
Mary, remember me!
And when I’ve gone life’s weary
way,
And earth’s no more for me;
Oh! then, sweet Mother, by me
stay!
Mary, remember me!
Sing, Sing, Ye Angel Bands.
Sing, sing, ye Angel Bands,
All beautiful and bright;
For higher still, and higher,
Through fields of starry light,
Mary, your Queen ascends,
Like the sweet moon at night.
A fairer flower than she
On earth hath never been;
And save the throne of God,
Your heavens have never seen
A wonder half so bright
As your ascending Queen.
O happy angels! look
How" beautiful she is;
See! Jesus bears her up,
Her hand is locked in His:
Oh, who can tell the height
Of that fair Mother’s bliss?


And shall I lose thee, then,
Lose my sweet right to thee?
Ah, no! the Angel’s Queen
Man’s Mother still will be;
And thou upon thy throne
Wilt keep thy love for me.
On then, dear pageant, on,
Sweet music breathes around;
And love, like dew, distils
On hearts in rapture bound;
The Queen of Heaven goes up,
To be proclaimed and crowned!
The Eternal Father calls.
His daughter to be blessed;
The Son His Maiden-Mother
Woos unto His breast;
The Holy Ghost His spouse
Beckons into her rest.
See! See the Eternal Hands
Put on her radiant crown,
And the sweet Majesty
Of Mercy sitteth down.
For ever and for ever,
On her predestined throne.
This Is The Image Of Our
Queen.
This is the image of our Queen
Who reigns in bliss above,
Of her who is the hope of men,
Whom men and angels love.
Chorus:
Most holy Mary, at thy feet,
I bend a suppliant knee.
In this thine own sweet month
of May
Pray thou to God for me.
The sacred homage that we pay
To Mary’s image here;
To Mary’s self and then to God,
Ascends the starry sphere.
Sweet are the flowers we have
culled,
This image to adorn;
But sweeter far is Mary’s self,
That rose without a thorn.
O Lady, by the stars that make
A glory round thy head,
And by the pure uplifted hands
That for thy children plead.
Welcome Month of Mary.
Welcome to this world of woe,
To each pilgrim here below,
Nature’s voice o’er hill and dale,
Bids you Month of Mary, hail;
Come, ye children of the Spring,
Fair and fragrant flow’rets bring;
Welcome Month of Mary!
Chorus:
Welcome Month of Mary,
Welcome Month of Mary.
Come, that from your treasures
sweet
We may twine a chaplet meet,
To be offered at the shrine
Of the Mother-Maid Divine!
Bring the rose, for in its hue,
Mary’s ardent love we view.
Mystic Rose! that precious name,
Mary from the Church doth claim;
In the lily’s silver bells,
The purity of Mary dwells.
In the myrtle’s fadeless green
Mary’s constancy is seen.
Month of bright and radiant skies!
Tribute flowers to greet you rise;
Come, for we are weary here,
Till your music greets the ear;
Till your rosy fingers fair,
Scatter perfumes on the air.
We do love you month most fair,
For the precious name you bear;
And we hail you with delight;
Mary’s name sheds lustre bright;
Every flow’ret seems to say
Mary’s is the Month of May.


Ave Sanctissima.
Ave Sanctissima,
We lift our souls to thee;
Ora pro nobis,
’Tis nightfall on the sea.
Watch us while shadows lie
Far o’er the waters spread,
Hear the heart’s lonely sigh—
Thine, too, hath bled.
Thou who hast look’d on death
Aid us when death is near.
Whisper of Heav’n to faith,
Sweet Mother, Sweet Mother,
hear.
O Mother, Welcome Is The
Feast.
O Mother, welcome is the feast
Which gladdens us to-day,
And sheds o’er earth’s lone wilder-
ness
A bright celestial ray.
Our trust, our joy shall be in thee,
For hope shines from thy purity.
Bright Star Immaculate.

The universal praise;
Let every son of earth to God
A grateful tribute raise.
For one fair flower still doth
bloom,
Untouched by Eden’s hopeless
doom.
Bright Star Immaculate.

O Queen of the Holy Rosary!
Oh! bless us as we pray,
And offer Thee our roses
In garlands, day by day;
While from our Father’s Garden,
With loving hearts, and bold,
We gather to Thine honour,
Buds white, and red, and gold.
O Queen of the Holy Rosary!
Each mystery blends with Thine,
The sacred life of Jesus
In every step divine.
Thy soul was His fair garden,
Thy Virgin-breast His Throne.
Thy thoughts His faithful mirror,
Reflecting Him alone.
Sweet Lady of the Rosary,
White roses let us bring,
And lay them round Thy footstool,
Before our Infant King.
For nestling in Thy bosom
God’s Son was fain to be,
The Child of Thy obedience
And spotless purity.

Far above, enthroned in Glory,
Sweetest Queen of Heaven’s
court,
See thy children kneel before thee,
Turn on us a Mother’s thought.
Sancta Mater hear our pleading,
Faith and hope and Holy Love,
Sweetest Mother of our Jesus
Sent to us from heaven above.
Holy Mother, we thy children,
Far and near, o’er land and sea,
’Mid the world and in the cloister
Fondly turn with love to thee.
Sancta Mater, sooth the mourner,
Shield the weary, tempted soul,
Sweetest Mother, guide thy child-
ren
To the bright and happy goal.
Immaculate Mary.
Immaculate Mary! Our hearts are
on fire,
That title so wondrous fills all our
desire.
Chorus:
Ave, Ave, Ave, Maria!
Ave, Ave, Maria!


We pray for God’s glory, may His
kingdom come;
We pray for His Vicar, our Father
in Rome.
We pray for our Mother, the
Church upon earth;
And bless, sweetest Lady, the land
of our birth.
Our Lady Help Of Christians.
Mary, Mother, bless thy children,
From thy glorious throne above.
Fill our hearts with purest glad-
ness
While we tell thee of our love.
Thou art helper of all Christians,
But we have a special claim
To thy favour, our sweet patron,
Lovingly we praise thy name.
Chorus:
Queen of Australia, guard our
dear land,
Bless and protect it with thy
loving hand.
Queen of Australia, guard our
dear land,
Bless and protect it with thy
loving hand.
Guide our steps while on we jour-
ney,
Help us when our path is steep,
Comfort us in every trial,
In thy heart our treasure keep.
Make us ever loyal children,
True to God and true to Thee;
Strengthen us in every danger,
Guide us till thy face we see.
Immaculata.
O Mary dear, Thy children here
Thy lovely shrine surround,
When day’s calm hour, like folded
flowers,
In fragrant dews are drowned.
Chorus:
O Virgin pure, O Mary blest,
We’ll murmur thro’ our peace-
ful rest
Immaculata, Immaculata, Im-
maculata,
Our Virgin Queen.
And while we sing, to thee we
bring
Our gifts when day is done;
Oh! may they be enhanced by thee,
Meet tribute to thy Son.
Oh, when life’s rays doth fade
away,
As sinks the sun to rest.
Then be thou near, to soothe and
cheer,
With visions of the blest.
Then wondrous thought with
transport fraught
In Heaven’s untold repose,
We’ll bless alway the earthly day
That brought so sweet a close.
The Angelas.
The Angelus sweetly rings Ave
Maria,
Morn, noon and even singeth Ave
Maria,
’Tis long, long ago since the Word
spoke in Heaven
By a great archangel to Mary was
given,
But each ever since singeth Ave
Maria.
Morn, noon and even singeth Ave
Maria,
O blest is the dawn that the
Angelus tells,
And blest is the true light that
our darkness dispels;
Morn, noon and even singeth Ave
Maria,
O blest is the dawn that the
Angelus tells.


Our Queen Immaculate.
Oh, fairest of all visions,
With meekly folded hands,
Adoring eyes uplifted,
Before her God she stands.
Chorus:
Mother pure, Virgin fair,
Spotless Dove, Peerless Maid,
Crowned Queen of God’s Crea-
tion,
Our Queen Immaculate.
Oh, fairest of all visions,
That met the eager gaze
Of Patriach and Prophet,
In far primeval days.
ANNUNCIATION (March 25)
How Pure, How Frail.
How pure, how frail and white,
The snowdrops shine;
Gather a garland bright
For Mary’s shrine.
Chorus:
Hail, Mary! Hail, Mary,
Queen of Heaven, let us repeat,
And place our snowdrop wreath
Here at her feet.
For on this blessed day
She knelt at pray’r,
Where, lo before her shone
An angel fair.
On This Day, O Beautiful
Mother.
On this day, O beautiful Mother,
On this day we give thee our
love.
Near thee, Madonna, fondly we
hover,
Trusting thy gentle care to
prove.
Chorus:
On this day we ask to share,
Dearest Mother, thy sweet care;
Aid us ere our feet astray
Wander from thy guiding- way.
Queen of angels, deign to hear
Lisping children’s humble pray’r;
Young hearts gain, O Virgin pure,
Sweetly to thyself allure.
Our Lady Della Strada
Mother, Mother, I am coming
Home to Jesus and to thee,
But my country’s hills are distant,
And their light I cannot see;
Mother, harken, as I pray,
Meet me on my homeward way,
Meet me, Mother mine, to-day.
Meet me on my homeward way.
Oftentimes my skies are clouded,
I can see no sun nor star,
And the road is rough and narrow,
And the end seems very far;
Lest perchance my feet should
stray,
Meet me, Mother, on my way,
Meet me, Mother mine, to-day.
Meet me on my homeward way.
I must cross the burning desert,
I shall thirst, O Mother mine.
Fill thy vessel at the fountain
Of thy Son’s sweet Heart Divine;
Lest I faint upon the way,
Tender Mother, stoop, X pray:
Give my soul to drink to-day.
Meet me on my homeward way.
Hail Bright Star Of Ocean.
Hail Bright Star of Ocean,
God’s own Mother blest,
Ever —sinless Virgin,
Gate of heavenly rest.


Taking that sweet Ave,
Which from Gabriel came,
Peace confirm within us,
Changing Eva’s name.
Show thyself a Mother,
May the word Divine,
Born for us thine Infant,
Hear our prayers through thine.
May Hymn.
The sun is shining brightly,
The trees are clothed with green;
The beauteous bloom of flowers
On every side is seen.
The trees are gold and emerald,
And all the world is gay,
For ’tis the Month of Mary,
The lovely Month of May.
Chorus:
Mary, dear Mother,
We sing a hymn to thee,
Thou art the Queen of Heaven,
Thou, too, our Queen shalt be,
Oh! rule us and guide us into
Eternity.
There’s music in the heavens,
The birds are singing there,
And nature’s songs and praises
Are sounding through the air.
But we with hearts rejoicing
With joy we sing to-day,
For ’tis the Month of Mary,
The lovely Month of May.
To Our Blessed Lady.
Mother dear, oh pray for me,
Tossed on life’s stormy sea;
O lend thine aid and steer my
barque,
Safe o’er its waters dark.
Chorus:
Star of Hope, by thy sweet ray,
Cheer me on my way,
Till I reach my home and thee,
O Mother, pray for me.
Mother dear, O pray for me,
E’er keep me near to thee,
Lest pleasure tempt thy child to
stray
From virtue’s path away.
Mother, when in sorrow’s hour,
I claim thy help and power.
On me a pitying glance bestow,
Thyself a Mother show.
Aspiration To Our Lady.
0 Most Pure and Loving Heart,
Of my Mother and my Queen,
Grant that I may love Thee,
Love Thee daily more and more.
Grant that I may love Thee,
Love Thee daily more and more.
The First Communion Hymn.
Oh, Mary, Mother, sweetest, best,
From Heaven’s immortal bowers,
Do gather for a little child
A bouquet of sweet flowers.
1 wish my little heart to be
A cradle fair and gay,
Where my blessed Jesus may
repose,
On my first Communion Day.
My little child, I can obtain
So bright a wreath for thee,
That Jesus will delight to come
Within Thy heart to be;
I’ll give thee lovely charity,
More warm than roses’ glow;
I’ll give thee heavenly purity,
More white than lily snow.
The violet of humility
Shall yield a sweet perfume,
And Jesus shall delight to be
Within thy little room.
But then, remember, dearest child,
The blossoms that I give
Require the wat’ring of a prayer.
Or they will cease to live.


Ora Pro Me.
Ave Maria, bright and pure,
Hear, O hear me when I pray;
Pains and pleasures try the pilgrim
On his long and weary way;
Fears and perils are around me.
Chorus:
Ave Maria, bright and pure;
Ora pro me, Ora pro me.
Ave Maria, Queen of Heaven,
Teach, O! teach me to obey;
Lead me on thro’ fierce tempta-
tions.
Stand and meet me in the way,
When I fail and faint, my Mother.
When my eyes are slowly closing,
And I fade from earth away,
And when death, the stern des-
troyer,
Claims my body as its prey,
Claim my soul, and then, sweet
Mary.
Our Lady Of Perpetual
Succour.
(Sancta Mater).
Mother of Perpetual Succour,
Show to us a Mother’s care;
Look upon Thy loving children,
Let us all Thy succour share.
Chorus;
From our exile, Queen of Heaven,
We thy children seek thine aid,
Never once wert thou unheeding,
When with faith and love we
prayed.
Foes surround us, Dearest Mother,
Keep us always true to thee,
Teach us when temptation rages,
To thy loving arms to flee.
Mother, thou art ever ready,
To thy children help to give,
Make us truthful, pure and holy,
’Neath thy mantle let us live.

Hail, Glorious St. Patrick.
Hail, glorious Saint Patrick, dear
Saint of our isle,
On us thy poor children bestow a
sweet smile:
And now thou art high in the
mansions above,
On Erin’s green valleys look down
in thy love.


Hail, glorious St. Patrick! thy
words were once strong
Against Satan’s wiles and a heretic
throng;
Not less is thy might where in
Heaven thou art;
Oh, come to our aid, in our battle
take part.
In the war against sin, in the
fight for the faith,
Dear Saint, may thy children resist
unto death;
May their strength be in meek-
ness, in penance, in prayer,
Their banner the Cross which they
glory to bear.
Thy people now exiles on many a
shore,
Shall love and revere thee till time
be no more;
And the fire thou hast kindled
shall ever burn bright,
Its warmth undiminished, undying
its light.
Ever bless and defend the sweet
land of our birth,
Where the shamrock still blooms
as when thou wert on earth,
And our hearts shall yet burn,
wheresoever we roam,
For God and St. Patrick, and our
native home.
Faith Of Our Fathers.
Faith of our Fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire, and
sword;
Oh, how our hearts beat high with
joy
Whene’er we hear that glorious
word.
Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
Our Fathers, chained in prisons
dark.
Were still in heart and con-
science free:
How sweet would he their child-
ren’s fate,
If they, like them, could die for
thee!
Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
Faith of our Fathers! Mary’s
prayers
Shall win our country back to
thee;
And through the truth that comes
from God
England shall then indeed be free.
Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
Faith of our Fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our
strife:
And preach thee too, as love
knows how
By kindly words and virtuous
life:
Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
Holy God, We Praise Thy
Name.
Holy God! we praise Thy name!
Lord of all, we bow before Thee:
All on earth Thy sceptre own,
All in heaven above adore Thee.
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.
Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising!
Cherubim and Seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising,
Fill the heavens with sweet accord
Holy! Holy! Holy Lord!


Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name
Thee,
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.
Spare Thy people, Lord, we pray,
By a thousand snares surround-
ed;
Keep us without sin to-day;
Never let us be confounded.
Lo! I put my trust in Thee,
Never, Lord, abandon me.
O Paradise.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy
land,
Where they that loved are blest ?
Chorus:
Where loyal hearts, and true,
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through
In God’s most holy sight?
O Paradise! O Paradise!
The world is growing old;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
Wherefore doth death delay,
Bright death, that is the welcome
dawn
Of our eternal day;
0 Paradise! O Paradise!
’Tis weary waiting here;
1 long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near.
0 Paradise! O Paradise!
I want to sin no more;
1 want to be as pure on earth
As on thy spotless shore.
O Paradise! O Paradise!
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest Lord
Is destining for me.
0 Paradise! O Paradise!
I feel ’twill not be long,
Patience! I almost think I hear
Faint fragments of thy song.
1 Am A Little Catholic.
1 am a little Catholic,
I love my Holy Faith,
I will be true to Holy Church,
And steadfast until death.
I shun the haunts of those who seek
To ensnare poor Catholic youth;
No Church I own, no schools I
know,
But those that teach the Truth.
If base it is to yield before
The persecutor’s rod;
Then baser far to side with those
Who insult the Church of God.
Oh, far from me such wickedness!
One treasure I hold dear,
My holy Faith. I fear not men,
’Tis God alone I fear.
I love His Altar, where I kneel,
My Jesus to adore;
I love my Mother, Mary dear,
Oh! may I love them more.
I love the Saints of olden time,
The places where they dwelt;
I love to pray where Saints have
prayed,
And kneel where they have
knelt.
I love my Cross, I love my Beads,
Each emblem of my Faith;
Let foolish men rail as they will,
I’ll love them until death.


0 Angel Dear, I Know Full
Well.
O Angel dear, I know full well
Thy tender care and love for me;
Oh! guard and guide me till I dwell
For ever safe in heaven with
thee.
Dear Angel—guide my feet —I
come
Each moment closer to the brink;
It may be X am nearer home
To-day, dear Angel, than I think.
Dear Angel, when my heart is
glad,
Lift up my thoughts to higher
bliss;
And help me when my soul is sad
The Cross with faith, and love to
kiss.
Dear Angel, in temptation’s hour
Oh! whisper softly in mine ear —
Be brave, nor fear the tempter’s
power,
Thy guardian Angel standeth
near.
Dear Angel, if my feet should
stray
Along the paths that lead to sin,
Forsake me not, but strive and
pray
For Mary’s sake my soul to win.
Dear Angel, Ever At My Side.
Dear Angel! ever at my side,
How loving must thou be,
To leave thy home in Heaven to
guard
A sinful child like me.
Thy beautiful and shining face
1 see not. though so near
The sweetness of thy soft low voice
I am too deaf to hear.
But I have felt thee in my thoughts
Fighting with sin for me;
And when my heart loves God, I
know
The sweetness is from thee.
And when, dear Spirit! I kneel
down
Morning and night to prayer,
Something there is within my
heart
Which tells me thou art there.
Yes! when I pray thou prayest too,
Thy prayer is all for me;
But when I sleep, thou sleepest
not,
But watchest patiently.
Then, for thy sake, dear Angel!
now
More humble will I be;
But I am weak, and when X fall,
O weary not of me:
O weary not, but love me still,
For Mary’s sake, thy Queen;
She never tired of me, though I
Her worst of sons have been.
Then love me, love me, Angel
dear!
And I will love thee more;
And help me when my soul is cast
Upon the eternal shore.
Dear St. Joseph, Pure and
Gentle.
Dear St. Joseph, pure and gentle.
Guardian of the Saviour child,
Treading with the virgin Mother
Egypt’s deserts rough and wild.
Chorus:
Hail St. Joseph, spouse of Mary,
Blest above all saints on high,
When the death-shades round us
gather,
Teach, oh, teach us how to die.


Dear St. Joseph, kind and loving,
Stretch to us a helping hand;
Guide us through life’s toils and
sorrows,
Safely to the distant land.
Saint Therese.
Hidden little flower of Jesus,
In His cloister garden grown,
Smile upon Thy pleading children,
Our petitions make thine own.
Thou whose trust in God’s dear
mercy
Make thee bloom so pure and
fair.
Beg for us this Holy virtue,
St. Therese, hear our prayer.
Love’s own victim, little flower,
Teach us Thy love’s gentle art;
And let fall Thy shower of Roses,
Little spouse of Jesus’ heart.
St. Joseph.
Remember, dear St. Joseph,
It never has been known
That those were left unheeded
Who to thine aid have flown.
Seraphic St. Teresa,
So pledged her word for thee
Friend of the Heart of Jesus
I pray thee pity me.
Chorus:
O dearest Saint remember
The exile’s weary pain,
For no one ever sought thee
Or asked thine aid in vain.
Oh, thou thro’ all her trials
Wert Mary’s guide and stay,
In every visitation
Companion of her way.
Thy gentle heart gave echo,
Responsive to her pain,
Which was for us, St. Joseph,
Let it not be in vain.
Act Of Love.
(St. Francis Xavier.)
My God, I love Thee, not because
I hope for Heaven thereby,
Nor yet that they who love Thee
not
Must burn eternally.
Thou, O my Jesus, Thou didst me
Upon the Cross embrace;
For me didst bear the nails and
spear
And manifold disgrace.
And griefs and torments number-
less,
And sweat of agony;
E’en death itself —and all for one,
Who was thine enemy.
Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ!
Should I not love Thee well?
Not for the sake of winning
Heaven,
Nor of escaping Hell.
Not with hope of gaining aught,
Not seeking a reward;
But, as Thyself hast loved me,
O ever-loving Lord!
E'en so I love Thee, and will love,
And in Thy praise will sing;
Solely because Thou art my God,
And my eternal King.
(St. Aloysius, June 21st.)
Dear Saint, who on thy natal day
To Mary’s tender care wast
given;
And didst beneath her gentle sway
Almost unsinning pass to heaven
Sweet flower which lov’d to bloom
unknown,
A saint ’mid worldly pomp and
pride,
Who at the footstep of a throne,
Knew naught but Jesus crucified.


Holy Ghost, Come Down Upon
Thy Children.
Holy Ghost, come down upon Thy
children.
Give us grace and make us thine;
Thy tender fires within us kindle,
Blessed Spirit! Love Divine!
For all within us good and holy
Is from Thee, Thy precious gift;
In all our joys, in all our sorrows,
Wistful hearts to Thee we lift.
For Thou to us art more than
father,
More than sister in Thy love,
So gentle, patient, and forbearing.
Holy Spirit! Heavenly Dove.
Oh, we have grieved Thee, graci-
ous Spirit!
Wayward, wanton, cold are we;
And still our sins, new every
morning,
Never yet have wearied Thee.
The Blessed Trinity.
Have mercy on us, God Most High,
Who lifts our hearts to Thee;
Have mercy on us worms of earth,
Most Holy Trinity.
Most ancient of all mysteries,
Before Thy throne we lie;
Have mercy now. most Merciful,
Most Holy Trinity.
When heaven and earth were yet
unmade,
When time w T as yet unknown,
Thou, in Thy bliss and majesty.
Didst live and love alone.
Thou wert not born, there was no
fount
From which Thy being flowed;
There is no end which Thou canst
reach;
But Thou art simply God.
Beautiful Angel.
Guardain Angel,
From heav'en so bright,
Watching beside me,
To lead me aright,
Fold thy wings round me,
Oh, guard me with love,
Softly sing songs to me,
Of heav’n above.
Chorus:
Beautiful Angel,
My Guardian so mild,
Tenderly guide me,
For X am thy child.
Angel so holy!
Whom God sends to me.
Sinful and lowly,
My guardian to be —
Wilt thou not cherish
The child of thy care?
Let me not perish—
My trust is thy prayer.
Oh may I never
Forget thou art near;
But keep me ever
In love and in fear.
Waking and sleeping,
In labour and rest,
In thy sweet keeping
My life shall be blest.
God Bless The Pope.
Full in the panting heart of Rome,
Beneath th’ Apostle’s crowning
dome,
From pilgrim’s lips that kiss the
ground,
Breathes in all tongues one only
sound —
God bless our Pope, the great,
the good!
The golden roof, the marble walls,
The Vatican’s majestic halls,
The note redoubles, till it fills
With echoes sweet the Seven Hills
God bless our Pope, the great,
the good!


From torrid South to frozen North
The wave harmonious stretches
forth,
Yet strikes no chord more true to
Rome’s
Than rings within our hearts and
homes;
God bless our Pope, the great,
the good!
Sweet Holy Child.
Jesus, teach me how to pray,
Suffer not my thoughts to stray,
Send distractions far away,
Sweet holy Child.
Let me not he rude or wild,
Make me humble, meek and mild,
Pure as angels undefiled,
Sweet holy Child.
When I work or when I play,
Be Thou with me through the day
Teach me what to do or say,
Sweet holy Child.
Make me love Thy Mother blest,
Safe beneath her care to rest,
As a bird within its nest,
Sweet holy Child.
When the hour of death is nigh,
Then may Mary standing by
Take me in her arms to die,
Sweet holy Child.
Ancient Of Days.
Ancient of Days, Thy servants meet
To bow before Thy mercy seat,
Thou Father, Son and Paraclete,
Miserere, Domine.
Have mercy, Lord, on all who wait
In place forlorn and lonely state,
Outside Thy peaceful Palace-gate,
Miserere, Domine.
These were the work of Thine own
hands,
Thy promise sure forever stands;
Release them, Lord, from pains
and bands.
Miserere, Domine.
Enter may they through Heaven’s
door
To walk in white on yonder shore
For ever, Lord, for evermore.
Miserere, Domine.
Ye Souls Of The Faithful.
Ye souls of the Faithful, who sleep
in the Lord
But as yet are shut out from your
final reward,
Oh, would I could lend you assist-
ance to fly
From your prison below to your
palace on high.
O tender Redeemer, their misery
see,
Deliver the souls that were ran-
somed by Thee.
Behold how they loved Thee in
spite of their pain;
Restore them, restore them to
favour again.
O mother of Mercy, dear soother
of grief,
Lend thou to their torments a
balmy relief;
Oh, temper the rigour of justice
severe,
And soften their flames with a
pitying tear.


The Waiting Souls.
They are waiting for our petitions,
Silent and calm.
Their lips no prayer can utter,
No suppliant psalm;
We have made them all too weary
With long delay.
For the Souls in their still agony,
Good Christian, pray.
Requiescant in Pace.
For the soul thou boldest dearest
Let prayers arise.
The voice of love is mighty
And will pierce the skies;
Waste not in selfish weeping
One precious day,
But speeding thy love to Heaven,
Good Christian, pray.
Requiescant in Pace
