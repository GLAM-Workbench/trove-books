LECTURE ON GOLD,
c(~c. dc.
The title to the present Lecture, viz. ?On the Australian Gold
Fields and the best Means of discriminating Gold from all other
Metals and Minerals,? reduces my subject to a strictly utilitarian
discourse. No time or space, therefore, can be devoted to an intro-
duction, although the matter before us might admit of the most
eloquent language, demonstrating the supposed injury, or benefit,
which England is likely to receive from these wonderful discoveries
of gold. The orator might indeed enlarge on that apparent decree
of Providence, which has deferred the actual finding of the treasure
till the present moment, in spite of the previous tenantship of many
of the gold-bearing districts by the aborigines and parties of convicts
with their officers. Considering that the Peruvians decorated
themselves with the gold found in their country, and thus excited
the cupidity of the cruel Spaniards, it is remarkable that no gold
ornaments should yet have been alluded to by travellers, as worn
by the' aborigines of the Australian colonies. I have had the
pleasure of conversing with an officer, lately in charge of convicts,
who resided some time ago near the places where the gold is now
discovered, but he states that nothing of the kind was heard or
talked of during his sojourn there; thus exemplifying the revered
saying, that ? there is a time for all things.? Surely, with our
over-grown population, the good time (i. e. work and pay for all)
has come at last. The inference is plain: let the industrious poor
emigrate, and reap the just reward of their labour.


I shall presume that everybody has read some, if not all the
various letters sent home by emigrants from the Australian colonies,
which are about 16,000 miles away from the sound of Bow hells.
I shall suppose that all intelligent persons are aware that gold
has been found in New South Wales, and the independent province
of Victoria, but not in Southern or Western Australia; as demon-
strated by the Government Blue Book, and also in Mr. Wyld?s
excellent map.
The emigrant, arrived at his destination, will desire to know
gold when he sees it; and, unlike the multitude who passed by the
real sovereigns on London Bridge, offered for sale, he will not wish
to lose the chance of improving his fortune; neither will he desire
to injure himself like the clever trader at one of our sea-ports, and
buy brass filings or yellow mica for pure gold.
To guide the unscientific emigrant, I shall proceed to answer
practically the following queries :
First. What is the nature and peculiar characteristic of the
rocks likely to afford the golden treasure ?
Secondly. Having procured a stone or mineral, which looks like
gold, how are we to be sure it is, or is not, the precious metal ?
For the ability to answer the first, we take our information from
nature ; because, at greater or less depths, we perceive that the crust
of the globe is not mere loose earth, but is formed of various layers,
or what geologists call strata (from the Latin stratum, a bed).
These layers, strata, or beds, whether hard or soft, are termed
collectively rocks, which admit of a very simple division, into
stratified and unstratified rocks.
The stratified have all been deposited from water. Hence they
are sometimes called aqueous rocks.
The unstratified have been once melted by some fervent heat,
they have been molten and liquefied like glass in the furnace.
Their other name is consequently igneous ( ignis being the Latin
for fire).
The stratified consists chiefly of three kinds of earthy matter,
viz. sand, clay, and lime. If good examples be wanting of a
stratified rock, we may point to the Marble Arch, at one of the
entrances of Hyde Park, or the chalk cliffs of Brighton.


Whilst other familiar illustrations could be given of unstratified
rocks by reference to Waterloo Bridge, composed of granite, or
to the magnificent vases of Swedish porphyry exhibited in the
Crystal Palace, or the basalt columns of the Giant?s Causeway.
The first, viz. the stratified, are deposited in regular order,
like the stones of a mason who erects a column: as the pillar must
have a beginning with the foundation, so with the strata. Common
sense will perceive that the lowest are the first laid down, then a
second, followed by a third. Thus we have the grand division of
stratified rocks into primary, secondary, tertiary, or, in plainer
language, into first, seconds, and thirds, which are again divided
into systems and formations.
These simple facts in geology would not have been men-
tioned, except to answer a question likely to arise in the uneducated,
but still naturally clever mind; ? How can geologists say which are
the oldest rocks ? or. What do they mean by primaries, secondaries,
and palaeozoics ? &c. &c. &c.
The simple classification, already mentioned, established in the
mind, it is easy to comprehend that, if Nature be true to herself, she
cannot invert or turn in a contrary direction this arrangement of
the stratified rocks. The primary being first deposited, cannot
be found above the secondary, or the tertiary under the secondary.
Pictures in a book help to instruct both young and old: an imitation
of nature, by way of experiment, however rirde, may enlighten
my audience. I have, therefore, placed in this jar three layers
of seeds?at the bottom, rice, then black horse-beans, lastly
haricot beans. Here we have primary, secondary, tertiary.
Beneath and outside the jar is a bit of red calico: let us
call that the igneous rocks. Here is our mechanical illustration
of the previous facts stated; but how are we to know (in nature)
primary from secondary, or the latter from tertiary ??By the
remains of animals, fishes, plants, and shells, called fossils, deposited
by nature with the strata, like the bottle holding the coins placed
under the foundation stone of many ? a goodly pile ? in the present
generation.
Fossils are well termed ? the medals of creationand the
emigrant would not experience much difficulty in appreciating the


fossil remains of a peculiar fish, now extinct, of the lobster tribe,
called, in scientific language, crustaceous, and known to naturalists
as the Trilobite, having a jointed body, ploughed with two long
furrows, and thus divided in the length into three parts (hence the
derivation of trilobite from the Greek, treis, three; lohos, a lobe.)
Now, this very marked fossil, belonging to the
older Palaeozoic rocks, has been stated to be a
neighbour to the precious metal; and as ? a man
is known by the company he keeps,? so remem-
ber that gold has natural companions, which enable
the geologist to pronounce with almost perfect cer-
tainty that it may or may not be found in certain
localities.
The simple and inquiring mind will again ask other pertinent
questions Had not gold a beginning? or, How is it supposed to
have been formed in the bowels of the earth ?
Here I shall allude again to my illustration of the jar and
the seeds, in explanation of the facts, the more particularly as Mr.
Stuchbery, in his Government Report, states ? that most of the hills
west of the principal gold diggings are capped with basalt,? and
basalt is an igneous or unstratified rock. Again he says: ? I
find by observation that the trappean rocks, such as basalt and
porphyry, have arisen to the surface, projecting themselves through
the schistose rocks, and by overflowing and after degradation, they
give origin to most of the round-topped hills.? Here, again, we
find igneous rocks in the neighbourhood of gold; and Mr. Stuch-
bery also observes that quartz must be regarded as the chief matrix
or womb of gold. These observations we may endeavour to
exemplify by one illustration.
If igneous rocks were below the unstratified originally, why
do they cap hills at the present time ? Here speculation must assist
us. It has been assumed, that after the stratified rocks were
deposited, certain convulsions of nature (which occur even at the
present time in the shape of earthquakes and fiery volcanoes, like
those of Etna or Mount Vesuvius) took place, by which the melted
rocks were actually protruded upwards ; just as I pull this piece
of white calico from the bottom of the seeds in the jar, causing


the strata to bend upwards. Let this rude imitation represent the
melted rock, such as granite or basalt, pushed through the other
strata. During this grand operation of nature, the surrounding
strata must crack and leave fissures. Into these places, the
melted rock might continue to run; then another interval of
time would elapse the rocks previously in a state of fusion
cool and contract, leaving other cracks and fissures. Into these
places or hollows the metals* and minerals are supposed to have
been deposited, perhaps by the same electrical agency through
which we obtain a perfect copy of any medal or cast, by the process
of electro typing. Natural currents of electricity may have gradually
produced the veins of minerals, and thus originated gold in common
with other native metals, found generally associated with quartz,
which latter appears to have been more plentifully deposited than
any other mineral substance. Quartz is only another form of sand,
and is an oxide of silicium. Let me, then, pull up a piece of blue
calico from the bottom of the seeds, by the side of the white, to
represent quartz, and also another strip dyed yellow, to represent
the gold; and I have done practically all that can be effected to
give you a mechanical notion of the origin of gold. We have finally
to imagine the top of the seeds, through which the different coloured
calicoes are protruding, and which we have called igneous rock,
quartz, and gold, to be washed by water, and carried off miles away
from the original source. Thus it is supposed that the rocks con-
taining gold have been subjected to the action of breakers and
waves, as our sea-coasts at the present time. These waves, gradually
receding or advancing, have carried off large lumps of the rocks,
and, by rubbing, reduced them to smaller particles. Hence we read
of gold in the dry diggings being found in drift, which is nothing
more than particles of rocks transported from their original
position. In unison with these observations, let me again quote Mr.
Stuchbery:
? Nor is it at all surprising that gold should be so rarely found in
its original guangue or matrix, as compared with the large quantity
found in the limited areas of the earth?s surface* if the mind is only
prepared to grasp the immense amount of disintegration (i. e. sepa-
ration into smaller parts) and consequent denudation (washing away


so as to lay bare the inferior strata), together with the lapse of count-
less ages which may have taken place since the removal of the first
atom to the present time. ?As a proof of the transporting forces I
may mention, that in the bed of the Summerhill Creek I found
rounded blocks of fossiliferous limestone, which I am convinced must
have come from the mountain range between Summer Hill and
Emu Swamp, thus traversing the tortuous course of the creeks,
passing over precipitous falls through deeply-hollowed water-holes,
and other impediments; and yet large portions of this limestone still
remain as evidence of the power of these periodical mountain tor-
rents. This single instance is sufficient to explain the abraded, bat-
tered, and w r ater-worn character of the gold, and the general absence
of any particle of its original investing but more fragile matrix.?
We have spoken of strata, but not yet afforded the precise clue
which is to guide the emigrant in his geological opinion of the pro-
bable existence of gold in any range of country under examination;
neither do I think it possible to do so.
I propose, however, the following plan to guide the emigrant,
founded on a statement made by Professor Forbes, that ?it is use-
less to waste time in searching for gold in the older tertiaries, or in
secondary rocks; though none of the latter appearing to be as yet
discovered in Australia, you are not likely to go wrong through them.
The older palaeozoic, the metamorphic rocks that lie beneath them,
and the newest tertiaries, all taken in connexion with mountain chains,
are our best guides in this matter.?
I propose that every emigrant should purchase a small c.ollection,
specially and chiefly arranged (from my recommendation) by Mr.
Tennant, the eminent mineralogist of the Strand, to guide and fore-
warn persons ignorant of geology.
The collection to consist of two small deal trays, one containing
fossils of the most decided and ordinary character, belonging to the
older tertiaries and secondary rocks, which are not associated with
gold.
The other contains specimens of the older palasozoic fossils meta-
morphic rocks, newest tertiary fossils, with a specimen or two of
an igneous rock all of which are said to be characteristic of the
presence of gold.


With these specimens to look at on the voyage, and a month?s
practical geologising at the Diggings (i. e. familiarising the eye with
the earthy companions of gold), the intelligent though ignorant
emigrant may hid defiance to hard geological names, and lead the
way, perhaps, to fresh diggings, thus reaping the first and best har-
vest of gold in a new district: as it is evident he does not require a
knowledge of geology to guide him in digging a hole close by the
side of others who are actually finding the precious metal.
Geology will be of value to that man who will venture to lead
a party away from the multitude and search for gold in unexplored
districts.
PART 11.
In the second division of my subject, the most important question
remains to be answered: ? Having obtained a substance which looks
like gold, how are we to be sure that it is or is not the precious
metal ? ?
Before treating of the chemistry connected with this part of the
subject, allow me to premise, that the explorations conducted in the
general drift are termed ? Dry Diggings.?
The search after gold in the bed of a river is called a ?Wet
Digging.?
Whilst the operations conducted by the assistance of machinery
in which the quartz containing the gold is crushed, washed, and
amalgamated with quicksilver, may be distinguished from the others
as quartz-crushing and mining.
The latter is not very likely to come under the notice of the
general digger, as it requires expensive machinery, a number of
hands, and, of course, large capital; and is a process to be worked
only by a company or association of monied men. Quartz-crushing
must not, however, be wholly condemned as unprofitable, because a
friend of mine, just returned from Sydney, informed me, that he
knew a party of six speculators who had a large tract of ground
assigned by a creek in Australia, where they had erected a 12-horse


power steam-engine, with proper machinery for crushing quartz and
the amalgamation process. This speculation yielded at first 2400/.
worth of gold per week, but it has since diminished. They employed
thirty men, and gave wages from 51. to 30s. per week, besides the
necessary rations.
The Dry Diggings are the most generally worked, because Na-
ture has done the work of the steam-engine by crushing and break-
ing up the original matrix, and spreading the gold over a large range
of country; I cannot, therefore, fail to notice machines mentioned in
nearly all letters from emigrants, called ? Cradles,? used extensively
to rake or wake up the gold, in contradistinction to the usual
office of this when it contains a living occupant, who is
supposed to be sent to sleep with greater facility by its use.
I am enabled, by the kindness of
Messrs. Richards, of Bishopsgate Street,
? Yardon, of 3 Gracechurch Street,
to show you specimens of the proposed cradles, the construction of
which is very simple, as shown in the drawings at the end of the
Lecture.
A little experience only is required to work them properly. Thus
the earth is thrown into the upper sieve with plenty of water; here
the large stones are retained, which are carefully looked over for
gold; then the cradle is kept continually rocked, the motion being
graduated, and not too violent; the continual shaking and flowing of
the water washes away the earthy matter, whilst the gold, which is
more than seven times heavier than anything likely to be associated
with it, sinks to the bottom, being retained by the elects or ribs
of wood put across the lower part of the machine.
No doubt the original idea of cradles was taken from Nature, as
a hollow-tree, cut down and divided in halves, with a few rude parti-
tions, or ribs, at the bottom, would answer the purpose of the gold-
washer.
Amongst the more complicated machines offered for the same
purpose, I have to mention and show you two gold-washing ma-
chines?one manufactured by J. Symonds and Co., and sent here
by Messrs. Yardon, of 3 Gracechurch Street, City; and another by
Frederick Barnes, of 3 Union Row, Tower Hill.


The former consists of a stout cylindrical vessel of galvanised iron;
in the centre is placed a strong shaft, with iron arms attached, the
whole being worked by a set of cogs and power-wheel. The earth is
thrown into the top (where the large stones are retained by a sieve),
with plenty of water; the iron arms are worked round and round,
just as yon see in a brick-field the clay and other materials worked
up in a tub with horse-power. At regular intervals from the top are
placed little doors with screws, and as the washing proceeds, the
person engaged in using it opens first the top one, permitting a little
of the earth and water to flow into a pan, which he carefully exa-
mines for gold spangles or dust; if no glittering particles are appa-
rent (and a large magnifying-glass would greatly facilitate the
examination), he passes to the second hole, from that to the third,
thus tracing the gradual descent of the gold, until he arrives at the
bottom of the vessel; here a plate or slide is withdrawn, and the
gold-dust, with some earthy matters, falls into the pan. After two or
three iron buckets of the earth, rich in gold, have been collected, the
contents are washed over again in the machine; and lam told that
by this apparatus one ton of earth, whether sand, clay, or gravel, can
be washed per diem by the assistance of two boys of twelve years of
age, or one able-bodied man. The latter, with another of Messrs.
Mills?, Cowper Street, City Road, will be found at the end of the
Lecture.
Here, then, we take leave of gold-washing machines; and let me
now say a few words respecting another point of importance to the
intending emigrant; and that is, house-shelter for himself and family.
Mrs. Chisholm (well known to all by her philanthropic exer-
tions) recommends parties of emigrants or families to take out
their own house or tent; and we can understand the value of this
hint when I observe that my friend stated, ? When he left Sydney,
a single room, of very moderate dimensions, was letting at the rate of
51. per week.?
I am now enabled to show you one of these tents, as manufactured
by Mr. Richardson, of the corner of Judd Street, New Road; it is
made of the most substantial materials; the canvass of the best un-
bleached long flax, and is sold for 4/. 10s. The hammock and sus-
pender, 10s.; the tripod and kettle, 125.; seats, Is. 6d. each.


The tripod may be used for two purposes, as, after being employed
to hold the kettle, it can be put over the hole where the digger is
working; and, having a single block pulley attached, would enable a
small party to get through more work, with less fatigue, than if the
buckets of earth were pulled up by main force.
We now pass to the strictly chemical part of the subject, ? The
Discrimination of Gold from other Metals and Minerals.?
I have before me a tray of specimens, many of which are
glittering, and look like gold, suggesting, however, the old caution,
that ? all is not gold that glitters.?
Here are five trays, containing only iron pyrites or sulphuret of
iron.
There is another set of five, containing copper pyrites or sul-
phuret of copper.
All these have a shining aspect, and are frequently mistaken for
gold. But in the other trays you perceive sundry modest-looking
specimens; these have come from California, and contain gold,
although you might consider them, by mere inspection, to be worth-
less ; here again are unmistakeable nuggets of gold, associated with
quartz, from Australia, kindly sent by Messrs. Hunt and Roskill
of Bond Street, the eminent jewellers and goldsmiths.
In the absence of specimens for comparison, the emigrant having
none, let me point out the most simple modes of ascertaining the
difference between iron or copper pyrites and gold.
Our only apparatus required is a common anvil and hammer,
and a red-hot shovel. I take this piece of gold, and treat it most
roughly with the hammer on the anvil: you will perceive I am
beating the metal out, extending it, and thus demonstrating that
it has the property of malleability, which gold enjoys in the very
highest degree, as this metal may be beaten out into leaves the one
282-thousandth of an inch in thickness ; i.e. it would take 282,000 to
make a pile of gold leaves one inch high. One grain also can be
made to cover 56| square inches. We cannot, then, beat the gold
to fragments. But now observe the pyrites : directly I strike with the
hammer, sparks of fire are apparent (hence its name from the
Greek, pur, fire, as it was employed formerly for striking a light);
at the same moment you observe I have broken the mineral to


pieces; it is very brittle, and by continuing tbe hammering is now
reduced to powder.
My assistant lias brought me a red-hot iron; I sprinkle the
powder upon it, and you observe immediately the blue flame of
sulphur; and asking the loan of all noses in front of the lecture-table,
it may be perceived, by your appreciation of the suffocating odour of
the burning sulphur, that you perfectly comprehend its existence in
this mineral. Gold, I need not add, is incapable of producing any
odour or fumes when thrown upon a red-hot iron.
Here, then, are the simplest tests to distinguish these minerals
from gold, and we shall speak of the mode of testing yellow mica in
another place: indeed it may be observed, that there is little danger
of the emigrant being deceived by Nature; her ways are so un-
varying, plain, and simple. The emigrant has most to fear from the
chicanery of his fellow-man, as I am sorry to inform you that already
some perfect imitations of gold nuggets have made their appearance
in several of our sea-ports, manufactured in the toy-shop of the
world; regular ? Brummagem ? wares, so well got up as regards
weight and outward appearance (for they are electro-gilt), that many
have been sold as specimens, and of course their chief destination
will be the Diggings,?at least we may suppose so, ?because already
some parties sending brass filings from Sydney, under Government
escort, and paying duty, have been detected, and their precious
wares confiscated, whilst their names have been most liberally treated
(I am informed) by Government in the Sydney papers ; in fact, they
have been deservedly exposed, and have lost nearly all their trade in
consequence.
How, then, can we tell brass filings or nugget from the real
article ?
Let me now recommend every person intending to trade in this
gold to take out three pint bottles of acids ; viz. one pint of nitric
acid, commonly called aqua fortis; one pint of hydrochloric, or
muriatic acid; one pint of oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid: these acids
will not cost more than eight shillings, bottles and all, and may be
purchased of Mr. Thomas, chemist, Pall Mall, London, or of Messrs.
Newman, Regent Street, London.
Their great value will soon be apparent. In this glass you ob-


serve some glittering particles. I take the bottle containing the
aqua fortis, and add some; in a few seconds a violent commotion is
visible: orange-red fumes are escaping; they are very disagreeable
to my lungs; they produce coughing, and we will send the glass out
of the room, that you may not he inconvenienced: here we have
proof that the glass contained copper or brass filings; indeed, I can
assure you, that such was the case. Now observe the perfect
tranquillity of the gold under similar circumstances:?l pour aqua
fortis on some gold leaf; the acid being pure, the gold might remain
in contact with it for a century, and most probably no action or
solution of the metal would occur.
We perform a similar experiment on some muriatic acid and gold
leaf in another glass; no solution takes place: the same remark may
be repeated, the gold will not dissolve; but when we mix the con-
tents of the two glasses, ie. the gold leaf and the two acids, the
aqua fortis and the muriatic acid, we have made aqua regia, the
liquid which dissolves the royal metal, gold. Now the gold is
disappearing; in a few seconds it will be gone. Being placed on
one side, the chlorine of the aqua regia will attack and take the
gold into solution, rendering it for the time perfectly invisible.
Founded on this principle, that gold is only soluble in aqua
regia, or other liquids in which chlorine is set free, let me recom-
mend a simple mode of testing rocks which the emigrant may find
in his searchings; rocks in which gold may not be visible, but still
sufficiently present to pay handsomely, if worked by a proper process.
Certainly, the very name of ? chemical testing? is sufficient
to alarm the intending digger; for he will justly say, ? How can I
take out a laboratory? and if so, what do I know of its use??
No fear on this score need be apprehended.
I shall now give you a method of testing as a mere recipe, like
one from a cookery-book : you are not asked to burden your minds
with a chemical explanation of the changes effected, you are only
asked to remember it as a simple recipe. Take, then, your apparatus,
viz. a common saucepan, a few ? doctors? phials,? a bit of tinfoil, a
few nails; the three acids already named, viz. the aqua fortis, the
muriatic acid, the sulphuric acid, and your laboratory is complete for
the purpose, with the assistance of any ordinary fire.


Having powdered the rock under examination on the anvil, place
it, as I do now the three specimens before us, into a common phial.
In this experiment we have three kinds of rocks, in three two-ounce
wide-mouthed phials; to each of these I now add two measures of
muriatic, and one measure of aqua fortis, for the purpose of ascertain-
ing which contains the precious metal. They are now ready to be
heated; before doing so, I will put into another similar phial a bit of
tinfoil and some muriatic acid; into another I place a few iron nails,
some water, and a small quantity of oil of vitriol.
Here, then, we have three phials, containing the rocks and aqua
regia; also two phials, containing the tests by which we are to dis-
tinguish the presence of gold. I move the five phials into this
saucepan, which has a fold of paper or a bit of cotton rag at the
bottom, to prevent the heat being conducted too quickly to the glass
from the metal. I surround them with cold water, and place the
saucepan and its contents over this gas-burner, as you might do
likewise with an ordinary fire. We shall now leave our piece of
cookery to stew or digest; as the water warms gradually, it commu-
nicates heat to the bottles : in fact, they are now placed in what the
chemist would call the ? balneum maris,? or water-bath, and we may
return to them presently, when the digestion is completed.
In the mean time we will turn our attention to another mode of
testing a rock, containing gold or some glittering particles in such a
fine state of division that the hammer-and-anvil experiment for
pyrites camiot be well applied. This mode is a mere repetition of
an old alchemical experiment, which is thus rendered in the books
on ? The Philosopher?s Stone.? ? Hide and couple in a trans-
parent detine the eagle and the lyon, shut the doore close, so that
their breath go not "out, and strange ayre enter not in. The eagle
at their meeting will tear in pieces and devoure the lyon, and then he
taken with a long sleepeT Such mysterious language appears, no
doubt, very unintelligible?quite worthy, it might be thought, of the
gipsy at Norwood; but still the language, as a whole, is very ap-
propriate, and admits of an easy interpretation. Thus, we are told
to hide the lyon and the eagle in a transparent denne. The alche-
mist does not say put them into a glass, for how could you get such
animals into any ordinary vessel? the appropriate word ? denne? is.


therefore, used, meaning, of course, a glass receptacle; but what is
the lyon ? It means gold, the king of metals, whilst the eagle is the
name for quicksilver, or mercury. I put, then, some gold leaf into
this glass, and now add mercury, which immediately unites, amal-
gamates with, or tears and devours the lion gold. We have now
formed a thick amalgam, the quicksilver no longer runs about so
quickly on a flat surface, but is pasty and sluggish ; hence we com-
plete the alchemists? process, by observing that it is, in their poetical
language, ? taken with a long sleepe.?
The mode of using this plan in practical testing is very simple.
Powder say a quarter of a pound of the rock supposed to contain
gold on the anvil, place this in a wine-bottle, with a quarter of an
ounce of quicksilver, continually shake all together with a little water
for several hours, and when a leisure moment is found separate the
quicksilver from the earthy matter, observing if it looks pasty. Place
this on a shovel and heat red hot, taking care to avoid the fumes,
which are very poisonous, and would soon produce salivation if in-
haled. If any gold has been taken up by the quicksilver it will be
left behind on the shovel, and may be scraped off and weighed; a
calculation being soon made to determine, by rule of proportion, the
percentage of gold in the rock.
Should the emigrant wish to economise his quicksilver, he must
squeeze the amalgam through a piece of wash-leather before heating
on the shovel: the fluid matter that passes through is the mercury,
which will do again ; the pasty matter, if any be left in the leather,
is the gold amalgam, which can be heated as already directed.
There yet remains, however, another mode of treating or roughly
analysing certain natural specimens, such as I now show you, in
which it will be observed that the gold dust is disseminated through
a quantity of black shining-looking sand, which, I believe, is mag-
netic iron-sand. This specimen was brought me by a friend from
the coast of California, where, he stated, that cart-loads could be
picked up; he would not, however, name the locality. His surprise
was great when 1 weighed out 100 grains of the specimen, placed it
on paper, and took out instantly, by a good magnet, about 78 per
cent of ferruginous magnetic sand; the remaining particles, washed
carefully in a mortar with water and dried, yielded 13 per cent of


gold dust. If the story of the cart-loads to be found is correct, an
enormous sum would be realised by the use of a large magnet, and a
common pail for subsequently washing the earthy matter away
from the gold. And I may remark that my friend stated it was
his intention to make use of this plan.
The time has now arrived when we may finish the saucepan
experiment already detailed. Here are the five bottles, all sound;
three afford the orange-red fumes usually apparent on using aqua
regia; the other two still effervesce, but are ready for use?they are
the tests. I pour the contents of the three phials into three separate
glasses of distilled water, and now add to each the solution of tinfoil.
Observe, two of the glasses give no indication of a solid precipitate, or
matter thrown down; because one was yellow mica, the other a
mixture of quartz and iron and copper pyrites. But now, observe the
third; directly the solution of tinfoil is added, a purplish precipitate,
darkening the whole fluid, is perceptible, the perfection of the purple
being chance-work, as we are operating so roughly; hut in the hands
of the skilled, a solution of tin yields a magnificent purple compound,
called ? purple of cassius,? used for imparting the ruby colour to
glass. We cannot hope to attain perfection in this respect, but
enough is perceptible to distinguish the rock which contains the
gold from the other two. Presuming the ?examiner ? ?we must
not say ? chemist ? ?wishes a corroborative testimony before he
makes his mind up to pronounce on the existence of gold in the
rock, he would take the remainder of the third solution and pour it
into a fourth glass of distilled water, to which the solution of the
iron nails in water and sulphuric acid must be added. Here a
marked precipitate, or dark matter, thrown down or produced, is
visible. Let this settle during the night; the next morning pour off
the fluid, a dark brown mud is perceptible; earthy as it looks, this
humble mud is metallic gold, the standard of excellence, par excellence
the sinews of war?the handmaid of peace! Collect this mud by
pouring it on to a piece of paper, place by the fire or in the sun,
and let it dry. Then rub the dark particles with a bit of iron or steel
(a key for instance); immediately the mud changes its poverty-
struck appearance (as by the magician?s touch) to the gay and
brilliant shining yellow, all-commanding gold. Your proofs are


complete; ? the purple of cassius ? is corroborated by the mud
raised to brilliant gold, as already explained.
My lecture has expanded beyond the limits allotted in this
Institution. Guided, however, by your polite attention, I shall
bring forward one more plan of estimating gold; and our popular
discourse is finished.
Our final experiment, by way of ? testing for gold,? requires no
chemical liquid tests or re-agents ?it is called the test of specific
gravity (from species , a particular sort or kind; gravis , heavy or
weight), the particular weight of every substance compared with a
fixed standard of water. We are so constantly in the habit of
referring to a standard of perfection in music and the arts in general,
that the merest tyro in chemistry will see the office of water in
specific gravity. It is the philosopher?s unit or starting-point, for the
estimation of the relative weights of solids and fluids. Thus, the
cube of wood I hold in my hands, if represented by water, would
weigh about 1000 ounces at a temperature of 60� Fahrenheit; but
changed to gold, I could no longer hold it, the cube would weigh
more than half a ton, and would be equal to 19,300 ounces, value
per ounce 51. 9s. 9| or 106,109/. 15s. the cube. Such a mode of
taking the specific gravity of different substances, viz. by the weight
of equal bulks, whether cubic feet or inches, could not be employed,
in consequence of mechanical difficulties; we are, therefore, obliged
to adopt the method first devised by Archimedes, 600 b.c., when he
discovered the admixture of another metal with the gold of King
Hiero?s crown.
This amusing story, ending in the discovery of a philosophical
truth, may be thus described:?King Hiero gave out from the
Royal Treasury a certain quantity of gold, which he required to be
fashioned into a crown; when, however, the emblem of power was
produced by the goldsmith, it was not found deficient in weight,
but had that appearance which indicated to the monarch that a
surreptitious addition of some other metal must have been made.
It may be assumed that King Hiero consulted his friend and
philosopher Archimedes, and he might have said, ? Tell me,
Archimedes, without pulling my crown to pieces, if it has been
adulterated with any other metal.? The philosopher asked time to

solve the problem; and going to take his accustomed hath, observed
then specially what he had never particularly remarked before, that
as he entered the vessel of water, the liquid rose on each side of
him; that he, in fact, displaced a certain quantity of liquid. Thus,
supposing the bath to have been full of water, directly Archimedes
stepped in, it would overflow. Let it be assumed that the water
displaced was collected, and weighed 90 lbs., whilst the philosopher?s
body weighed 200 lbs. Now the train of reasoning in his mind might
be of this kind:?? My body displaces 90 lbs. of water; if I had an
exact cast of it in lead, the same weight of liquid would overflow; but
the original weight of the body was ?say 200 lbs.?the cast in lead
1000 lbs.; these two sums, divided by 90, would give very different
results; they would be the specific gravities, because the rule is
thus rendered: ? c Divide the gross weight by the loss of weight in
water, the water displaced and the quotient gives the specific
gravity.? ?
We will now put this rule in practice with our model crown.
Here is an ordinary pair of scales; to one pan is attached a
hook, and upon this I will hang the crown by a silk thread; the
weight amounts to 13 ounces ; we shall now place the crown in this
vessel of water, without touching the weights in the other pan,
immediately a loss of gravity is apparent; we must remove at least
two ounces before we can adjust the balance. The crown suspended
in water weighs only 11 ounces, and the rule' may now be worked
out: ? Divide the gross weight by the loss of weight in water, and
the quotient will give the specific gravity.?

The quotient, 6h, demonstrates that our crown is manufactured
of zinc, because it would have been about 19|, if made of pure gold.

This simple rule may be applied to all metals of any size or
weight, always taking the precaution to clear away with a feather
the air hubbies which attach themselves to the different substances.
When, however, the gold is associated with quartz, another rule
must be made use of, being a modification of the first, which I
can recommend, having verified it in practice with some nuggets
kindly lent by Messrs. Hunt and Roskill.

To make use of the above formulae or rules, the reader need
know nothing whatever of Algebra. He has only to be acquainted
with the management of Vulgar Fractions; and he must notice
that (?) is the sign of subtraction; (x) is the sign of multiplica-
tion; and S. G. stands for specific gravity. For instance.
Ex. I. Suppose we have a nugget weighing 1000 grains, and
its specific gravity is found to be 8. Suppose also the specific

rules.

18?8 2 10 2
18?2 x ~s x 1000 = T x 8 x 1000 = grains of quartz in ditto.
Ex. 11. Suppose an Australian nugget is brought to us, weighing
10 oz. Troy, and we find its specific gravity to be B*s. Suppose
also we take the specific gravity of gold at 19*0 and that of quartz
at 2 '5. Then, as above.
It may be presumed that this practical mode of estimating the
value of gold nuggets is clear and brief, and as short a rule as
it is possible to conceive. Moreover, it is grasped by the eye all at
once?you see the whole: besides which it is cast in a perfect
mathematical mould, and must therefore be absolutely and uni-
versally true; also capable of instant application to every con-
ceivable example. I can calculate by this rule at the rate of about
one example in two minutes; and I think any emigrant accustomed
to figures, such as fractions and decimals, could work as fast by this
rule.
By giving the two formulas, one for the gold and the other for
the quartz, we give the reader the readiest possible mode of 'proving
his own work; thus having (Ex. I.) found the gold in nugget to
be 8431 grains, he deducts this from the whole weight, and gets
grains of quartz for a remainder. He therefore now works
by the second formula to obtain the weight of quartz; and finding
it to come (by the independent rule) exactly 1564 grains, he has
reason to conclude that his work is altogether right.
My only aim has been simplicity, and I hope that the subject
matter has been perfectly comprehended by all who have favoured
me with their attendance; and I trust the information sought to be
conveyed will prove of real utility to all those who intend to
emigrate to the Australian colonies.

Various Problems, including that of King Hierd?s Crown, with their
Solutions, illustrating Specific Gravities.
No. 1.
Accobding to Vitruvius, Hiero?s crown weighed 20 lbs., and lost lb.
(nearly) in water.
Suppose it consisted of gold and silver only, and that 19-64 lbs. gold
lose 1 lb. in water, and that 10 - 5 lbs. silver lose in like manner 1 lb.: find
the quantity of gold and silver in the crown.
Answer. x = the lbs. of gold in the crown
. ?. 20 x = the lbs. of silver in the crown.
Hence we immediately have
� .20 x ii ii

And solving this equation, we have
a; = 14 77 lbs. of gold in crownj Answer
and 20 ?x 5?22 lbs. of silver in do. J


No. 2.
A given mass, which weighs p lbs. loses a lbs. in water. This mass,
however, is composed of two materials, which we will call A and B. Of
these we only know that p lbs. of A lose h lbs. in water, and p lbs. of B
lose c lbs.
How much does the given mass contain of each material ?
Answer. x = the lbs. of material A
p x the lbs. of ditto B
Hence, as before,
-x 4- - ip x) a lbs.
P P '
And solving this equation, we have
x -- p lbs. of A 1
c ~ b r Answer,
and p? x -?i p lbs. of B J
� C? ? 0 X
No. 3.
The specific gravity of gold is 19-26, and that of quartz 2-6.
An Australian nugget, weighing 550 grains (and assumed to contain
nothing but gold and quartz), was found to have the specific gravity 9-77.
Required the quantity of gold and quartz respectively in the nugget ?
Let x = grains of gold
550 x = grains of quartz.
Then, since gold loses ? of its weight in water
and quartz loses ditto . ditto
and also nugget ditto ditto
xl j, x 550 x 550
therefore 19-26 Teo 9-77
And solving this equation, we have
x = 466-6256 grains of gold in nugget! Angwer>
and 550 ?x = 83-3744 grains of quartz in ditto/


Table of Weights.
480 Grains Troy = 1 oz. Troy
437?5 ditto = 1 oz. Avoirdupois
7000 ditto = 1 lb. Avoirdupois
5760 ditto = lib. Troy.
The Troy pound is less than the Avoirdupois in the proportion of 14
to 17 nearly.
The Troy ounce is greater than the Avoirdupois in the proportion of
79 to 72 nearly.
Troy Weight.
24 Grains = 1 Pennyweight = 24 Grains
20 Pennyweights = 1 Ounce = 480 Grains
12 Ounces = 1 Pound = 5760 Grains.
The carat used for weighing diamonds is grains. The term,
however, when used to express the fineness of gold, has a relative meaning
only.
Every mass of alloyed gold is supposed to be divided into 24 equal
parts ; thus, the standard for coin is 22 carats fine: that is, it consists of
22 parts of pure gold and 2 parts alloy. What is called the New Standard,
used for watch-cases, &c., is 18 carats fine.
