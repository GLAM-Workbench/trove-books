JUBILEE
OF
ALL SOULS’ CHURCH
ST. PETERS
1883 - 1933


THE LORD BISHOP OF ADELAIDE


FOREWORD.
CJ 'HE first Confirmation I held in South Australia was
in the old Church of All Souls, more than 27 years
ago, when our present Dean, Dean Jose, was Rector.
Since then you have built a beautiful new Church, and
the Parish has advanced in many ways. This booklet
is a record of its growth, both spiritual and material,
during the past 50 years. Facts and events that are
both interesting and illuminating are easily forgotten,
and it is wise to record them, that they may be handed
down as history. lam glad to commend this record
to its readers, and I hope that the progress of this
Parish may be as great and happy in the years to come
as in the years that are past.
A. NUTTER ADELAIDE.

Historical Review.
“Call to remembrance the former days."—Heb. X., 32.
Bishop Lightfoot, of Durham, used to say that “History is a good
cordial for drooping spirits.”
In reading through the records of All Souls' Church during the
last 50 years one cannot but feel the tonic effect.
It is the story of faithful men and women facing and overcoming
difficulties, and leaving a splendid heritage to those who come after.
We are thankful that there are still with us some who for the
■greater part of that time have been identified with All Souls' Church.
In 1883 what had been three or four farms began to grow into the
town of St. Peters.
The East Adelaide Land and Investment Company generously
offered a site (ISO ft.xlSO ft.) for a church, on condition that the build-
ing should be immediately erected.
The Rev. Canon Dendy, having in mind the spiritual requirements
of this rapidly increasing town, accepted this offer and took upon
himself the responsibility, not only of erecting and furnishing the church
but of voluntarily providing its services, for a time at least after its
completion.
Prior to this, and during the building of the church, services were
held in the house on the north east corner of St. Peters Street and
Sixth Avenue.
The Bank of Australasia undertook to advance the funds beyond
what had already been collected by Canon Dendy.
“The white wooden church on the side of the hill” was completely
finished and furnished, and was opened for divine service by Bishop
Kcnnion on All Souls’ Day, November 2nd, 1883.
From that time until the end of 1884, services were regularly con-
ducted by Canon Dendy, assisted by the Rev. Tom Ward, whom he
had appointed as Assistant Curate.
On the appointment of the Rev. Tom Ward, to a Mission Incum-
bency in the South East, Canon Dendy expressed to the Bishop his
willingness to resign the Cure, and suggested to his Lordship the name
of the Rev, Rowland Hayward as the future Incumbent.
After due consideration the Bishop decided that it would be advis-
able to connect the Church of All Souls’ with that of S. Aidan’s,
Marden, in one Parish, and, acting on Canon Dendy’s suggestion, the
charge was offered to and accepted by Rev. R. Hayward.


The property was then vested in trustees, Messrs. J. W. Downer,
M.P., Rowland Rees, M.P., T. H. Rowe, M.P., G. W. Hawkes, and
A. Sturcke, who mortgaged the property for £5OO at 6\ r /<, and paid off
the overdraft at the Bank of Australasia.
The Rev. R. Hayward resigned on September 19th, 1886, and was
succeeded by Rev. Robert Kenny, M.A., wdio began a faithful ministry
of 12 years on May Ist, 1887, and remained until July 16th, 1899.
The next Incumbent was Rev. F. G. Masters, M.A., who began his
ministry at All Souls’ on March 3rd, 1900, and remained until October
31st, 1904.
During this time a Rectory was purchased in Fourth Avenue, £B5O
being paid for the house in 1901.
At the 1902 Vestry meeting a committee was appointed to make
enquiries re land for a more substantial church in a more central
position.
The next year the committee purchased a block of land in Third
Avenue, between Walkerville Road and St. Peters Street, for £lB7
10/-, of which £l5O remained on mortgage for three years.
Rev. G. H. Jose, M.A., was Rector during 1905 and 1906. He kept
before the parish the ideal of “a central stone church worthy of the
honour due to God, a wdtness to the world and the home of our devo-
tions.’ A New Church Fund was also begun.
The Rev. W. G. M. Murphy, then Rector of Yankalilla, was the
next Incumbent. During his 20 years the Church made great progress,
and the present All Souls’ was built and paid for.
He began his ministry here February Ist, 1907. In August of the
same year a committee meeting was held at the Rectory and considered
three sites for a new church, and appointed a sub-committee to
negotiate.
In September, 1907, the purchase of the land known! as ’’Perry’s,"
"’as completed, and a transfer taken out in the names of Messrs. Chap-
man, Wendt and Hyett, on behalf of the Church.
The total price of the land was £570, and tho committee took steps
to dispose of the other block of land in Third Avenue.
The New Church Fund was continued, and through direct giving
andUhe efforts of the Guild of Perseverance, by May, 1915, the sum of
£1,754 was in hand, and the Vestry decided to at once build the New
Church.
The tender of Messrs. Emmett and Sons for £3,482 was accepted
and Mr. Alfred Wells w r as the architect.
A mortgage of £2,000 with the Manchester Unity Society of Odd-
fellows was arranged at 5J per cent., the mortgage being in "the names
of the trustees of the land, Messrs. F. A. Chapman and H. K. Wendt,
wmo were responsible for this amount and the interest.
The Foundation Stone was laid September 11th, 1915.
His Excellency the Governor, Sir Henry Galway, w-as to lav this
stone, but owing to illness his place was taken by the Lord Bishop of
Adelaide, who w ? as commissioned by the Governor to perform the
ceremony on his behalf.


The Building Committee comprised the following members :—The
Rector (Rev. W. G. M. Murphy-), Captain Hutton, and Messrs. F. A.
Chapman, H, K. Wendt, H. E. L. Taylor, F. K. Haddrick, R. Lewis and
J. E. Jeffreys.
The Church, which is built on Byzantine lines, accommodates 400
people, and is one of the most beautiful in Adelaide. It stands as an
abiding memorial to the devoted service given by the Rev. Canon
Murphy.
This fine edifice was dedicated by the Bishop of Adelaide on May
31st, 1916, the text for an impressive sermon being the Sursum Corda—
“Lift up your hearts; we lift them up unto the Lord.”
The furniture of the Church, which is all of Queensland maple, is
in keeping with the beautiful Church. A fairly complete list will be
found elsewhere in this booklet.
Systematic efforts made to pay off the debt of £2,000 were success-
ful, and the Church was consecrated by the Bishop in the presence of
a large congregation on December 12th, 1926.
In 1922, as the old Rectory was in disrepair, it was decided to pur-
chase another property nearer the Church.
The present Rectory was then bought for a sum of £2,000, of which,
after the sale of the old Rectory, £1,250 remained on mortgage.
Canon Murphy, wdro had completed 20 years as Rector and been
the moving spirit in the building of the new Church, resigned the in-
cumbency on April 30th, 1927, and Rev. H. H. Coles, M.A., was ap-
pointed to the Charge. The Induction Service was conducted by the
Dean of Adelaide, the preacher being Rev. J. Welsh, June 1, 1927.
In 1927, by a legacy of £lOO, bequeathed by the late Mr. G. M.
May, the debt on the Rectory was reduced to £1,050, at which amount
it remained until this our Jubilee r ear, when, to mark the occasion,
a determined effort was made to clear the indebtedness. Through
the generosity of one, who has been a pillar of the Church here for
many years, in subsidising pound for pound up to £3OO, we have at the
time of writing raised £630 towards it. The fund remains open until
our Jubilee Festival, November Sth, 1933.
This is but a brief survey of all that has happened during s|) years,
and that, chiefly of material things : but the spiritual progress, who
can tell? For fifty 3-ears the Church has called people to the worship
of God, has invited them to lift their eyes from the broken surface of
life, and gaze into the Unseen, to catch glimpses at least of the tilings
God has prepared for them that love Him. We have, indeed, much
for which to “thank God and take courage" for "The Lord hath done-
great things for us already whereof we rejoice.”


Consecration of Church.
Extract from a sermon preached in All Souls’ Church, St. Peters,
by Canon Murphy, on the morning of its Consecration. The text was :
“Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where
thine honour dwclleth.” —Ps. 26, v. 8.
“This splendid Church marks the completion of what we have had
in our minds for many years. A great objective has been accom-
plished, a great work which bound together many souls in harmonious
enterprise is now ended. To-day we remember in loving gratitude
many who faithfully worked by our sides, but are now living in other
suburbs or cities, and others like Mr. F'. Chapman and Col. L. Dyke,
who did not live to see this great day. We also remember some
keen and earnest souls who were deeply interested in the new Church,
yet were called upon to lay down their lives in distant lands during
the Great War, namely, Lieut. K. Wendt, Private Bassett, Gunner
Gordon, Private H. Maclaren, Trooper Duncan Maclareu, Private
Bagot, and others.
To-day we again thank the members of the Guild of Perseverance,
who, under the leadership of Mrs. Vermeil and Miss Kay, brought in
a great contribution to the funds.
There were benefactors, too, like Mr. and Mrs. H. K. Wendt. Sir
Edwin Smith, Dr. T. K. Hamilton, Mrs. Evans' father, Mr. J. AL Ale-
Bride, whose monetary gifts were most gratefully received. Yearly
every article of furniture from the costly bell, presented by Mr. and
Airs. R. Lewis, and the solid silver altar vessels, given by Air. and Airs.
C. S. Alunro, the Choir Stalls, the two reading desks, the fine Altar
itself, the pulpit, the London-made banner, the Lectern Bible, right
down to a small gift were donated in a spirit of affection, or of affec-
tionate remembrance.
All these things proclaimed in dumb show that many people con-
nected directly or indirectly with All Souls' Church loved the habitation
of Thine house and the place where Thine honour dwelleth."

During the last 25 years there have been 434 burials; few records

MEMBERS OF THE CHOIR


Organ and Choir
The organ in the Church in Sixth Avenue w'as dedicated by Bishop
Reunion, August Ist, 1894. The present organ was built by J. E.
Dodd and in size, range and voicing is admirably suited to the building.
This organ was dedicated by the Bishop August 2nd, 1916, when the
Cathedral Choir was present and the Cathedral Organist (Mr. J. M.
Dunn) officiated at the organ.
The organ bears a plate inscribed : "Presented by F. A. Chapman,
H. K. Wendt, J. M, Mcßride and others, 1916.”
The cost of the instrument was J 550, and it contains 668 pipes.
Officiating organists have been:—lBB3-6, Mr. 1C W. Wilkinson;
Mr. E. Fullarton, 1887-1906; Miss Sheppard; 1906 (July to
December) ; Mr. George Gardner, 1907 (February) to March; 1909,
Mr. Weber; 1909 (April) to 1910 (March), Mr. R. Mellish; with Mr, J.
Jeffreys assistant organist 1910 (April) to 1914 (September), Mr. j.
Jeffreys, with Mr. Jeffreys, senior, choirmaster); November, 1914, to
April, 1918, Miss Jeffreys; May to December, 1918, Mr. W. B. Page;
January to March, 1919, Miss D’Vorak; April to June, 1919, Mr. Myles
Shearer; from July, 1919, Mr. H. R. Hansen.
A large number of Choristers have passed through All Souls’
Choir, and the standard of Church music has been consistently high.
Windows
The stained glass windows are all Morris glass, and beautifully
designed.
The glorious three-light window in the Memorial Chapel was the
gift of Mr. and Mrs. H. K. Wendt, Major A. K. Wendt, and Miss Lois
Wendt, in memory of Lieut. K. K. Wendt. The design is that of a
young soldier, in khaki uniform, being received into Paradise by our
Saviour. Behind Jesus are Angels, one with a symbol of purity, one
with a book (of records), and another with a symbol of victory. In
the tracery are Angels wdth scrolls and musical instruments; in the
centre is the badge of the School (S.P.S.C.) and the Tenth Battalion
colours. The side lights symbolise the highest traits of a soldier,
valour and generosity.
Another beautiful window is in memory of Private Charles Ernest
Bagot, who fell at Gallipoli, 1915, and is the gift of his mother, sister
and brother. The subject of the window is “Jonathan,” w'ho is repre-
sented in full armour and with the long swmrd of a chieftain in his
hand.
Next to this is a memorial window in memory of Private F. F.
Bassett, w r ho died on Active Service, March 10th, 1917, and Private J.
V. Gordon, killed in action at Messines, June 24th, 1917. This window
was the gift of the Sunday School, assisted by gifts from members of
the Church and choir. The design depicts the Archangel Michael
with a balance (the heraldic sign of All Souls’), weighing the souls of
men.
The other fine window is in memory of Martin Suckling, and was
Se gift of his widow and children. The design depicts S. Paul wth
e Sacred Law in one hand and grasping with the other the hilt of the
executioner’s sword.


Organisations
It is impossible, in the space available, to record more than a frac-
tion of what has been done towards building up the spiritual lives of
the people of this town. During its 50 years of existence All Souls’
has never lacked unselfish service from those who have loved to help
in the work of the Church and its many organizations.
F'rom the beginning there has been a Sunday School with faithful
Superintendents and Teachers. “Just as the twig is bent, the tree's
inclined." Since F'ebruary, 1927, there has been an All Souls' Day
School.
In December, 1927, a branch of the Church of England Boys’
Society was started here, “How beautiful is youth I How bright its
gleams, with its illusions, aspirations, dreams."
The Church of England Men’s Society has a long and honourable
record of service here, and has an unbroken history since 1911.
All Souls' Branch of the Girls’ Friendly Society was among the
first begun in this Diocese, and has stood for purity of life and bearing
one another’s burdens since 1897. Miss Sheppard has been the inde-
fatigable secretary since 1915.
The Mothers’ Union, with its objective of raising the standard of
family life, has been an influence for good for many years.
In Missionary matters this Parish has for years ranked high and
large contributions have been made to the extension work of the
Church both at home and in the mission fields.
The Sanctuary Guild docs a splendid work, and by its care of the
Altars and Sanctuary makes it more easy to “Worship the Lord in the
beauty of holiness.”
Sports Clubs. —We have a gymnasium, a cricket, and a tennis club
for young people.
Roll of Honour
These men gave their lives in the Great War 1914 —1919.

The Church
I love the rites- of England's Church
I love to hear and see
The priest and people reading slow
The solemn Litany ;
I love to hear the glorious swell
Of chanted psalm and prayer,
And the deep organ’s bursting heart
Throb through the shivering air.
Chants that a thousand years have heard
I love to hear again,
For visions of the olden time
Are wakened by the strain,
With gorgeous views the window glass
Seems suddenly to glow;
And rich and red the streams of light
Down through the chancel flow.
And then I murmer, "Surely God
Delighteth here to dwell;
This is the Temple of His Son
Whom He cloth love so well.”
James Russell Lowell.
