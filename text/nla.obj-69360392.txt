It appears that our Institution was founded at Knarshorough
Castle, in England, on the 29th October, 1745, under the title
of Royal Foresters, by which name it continued until, at
a Grand Convention of Delegates, held at Rochdale, in August,
1834, it was changed, and is now known as the Ancient Order
oe Foresters. Our Institution was founded for the purpose of
assisting each other at times when, but for the helping hand of
our Brethren, woe might sojourn for a much longer period in our
dwellings. For this and other ends we associate, and are bound
by a solemn tie to act towards, and alleviate the sufferings of,
each other as Brethren. To cheer and protect the unfortunate, to
sympathise with and aid those whom accident or disease may
overtake, and to dry the cheeks of the mourner, are among the
leading objects of Forestry. To provide against the calamities
just adverted to, is, though great, not the only benefit resulting
from our associated Brotherhood. Besides uniting to render less
trying the vicissitudes of human existence, we assemble to pro-
mote the social happiness of our Brethren, and relieve our minds
from the pressure of care by temperate conviviality.
A good Forester is a man who, jealous of his rights as a citizen,
maintains them in a temperate, manly, and decorous manner.
Knowing his duties, he performs them well, and pays a ready and
willing obedience to his country?s laws?neither cringing or servile
on the one hand, nor wild and factious on the other. In his
private character as a father, son, or husband, he fulfils all claims
with scrupulous fidelity.
Benevolence and friendship are our objects?justice and
morality our characteristics,


FORESTRY AND ITS PRINCIPLES.
That ? Unity is Strength? is by all men confessed ;
We in this Order should be so impress?d,
Being bound by ties, from which, if borne in mind.
Many an aching heart will comfort find !
To sympathize?to aid a brother?s cause?
Is one of Forestry?s great moral laws;
Brothers in need our sympathy require.
Or, being sick, our kindlier thoughts inspire?
To cheer the couch, to ease each pressing care
From wife and child, which on them oft-times bear;
"When by disease a brother is bow?d down,
Or grim death knocks, and straightway claims his own !
The husband dead!?the wife of help bereft!
Perchance some nurseling in her charge is left
To grow in years, without a father?s care.
With widow?d mother the world?s frowns to share ;
?Tis then a Forester his duty knows?
To help alleviate the mourners? woes.
If by misfortune Brothers be oppress?d.
Our duty?s still to help our own distressed!
In doing this ?our duty?bear in mind.
To give is right, if with it we be kind;
Simply to give from an o?erflowing store
Is charity indeed, but nothing more j
With rich or poor, to help without pretence.
In all exemplifies Benevolence !
Unity, Sympathy, Benevolence, combined.
Another sentiment will call to mind?
One that at all times in our midst should dwell.
And every unkind feeling there dispel.
We each propose?our own ideas suggest?
Our own ideas are not always the best;
With patience hear, then, each their thoughts unfold,
Nor form your judgment till each tale is told ?
Bear and forbear will realise the word
That peace to us will give and bring Concord :
These sentiments at heart, let each resort
Oft to his own or any other Court,
To learn, to teach, that no one may deny
W?e do to all as we would be done by.
These sentiments of our noble Institution are addressed to
the Brothers of the U.M.D.
theirs, very truly in the bonds of the Order,
F. LEPLASTRIER,
March 23ri)? 1862, District Secretary.


GENERAL LAWS
OF THJE
UNITED MELBOURNE DISTRICT OF THE ANCIENT
ORDER OF FORESTERS? FRIENDLY SOCIETY.
Amended and adopted at District Meetings, held on the sth, 6th,
7 th, 9th, 10 th, and llf/t October, 1865 ;
January IDA, 1867, and January 14 th and 15th, 1870.
All governments and societies of men do, in the process of long time,
gather an irregularity, and wear away much of their primitive institu-
tion. And, therefore, the true wisdom of all ages hath been to review,
at fit periods, those errors, defects, or excesses that have insensibly
crept into the public administration ; to brush the dust off the wheels,
and to oil them again : or, if it be found advisable, to choose a set of
new ones. And this reformation is the most easily, and with the least
disturbance, to be effected by the society itself, no single man being
forbidden by any magistrate to mend his own manners, and much more,
all societies having the liberty to bring themselves within compass.?
Andrew Marvel.
He that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger ; and he
that is chief, as he that doth serve.? Luke xxii. 26.
