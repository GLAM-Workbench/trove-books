PSAT.M
God is our refuge and our strength,
in straits a present aid ;
Therefore, although the earth remove,
we will not be afraid :
Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be; yea, though the hills
by swelling seas do shake.
A river is, whose streams do glad
the city of our God;
The holy place, wherein the Lord
most high hath his abode,
God in the midst of her doth dwell;
nothing shall her remove;
The Lord to her an helper will,
and that right early, prove.

Scripture, 0.T., psaem 90

Hymn
Now the labourer’s task is o’er,
Now the battle-day is past;
Now upon the further shore
Lands the voyager at last.
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leant we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the tears of earth are dried;
There its hidden things are clear;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here.
There the penitents who turn
To the cross their dying eyes
All the love of Jesus learn
At His feet in Paradise.
There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace ;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well,
He who died for their release.
‘Earth to earth, and dust to dust,’
Calmly now the words we say;
Left behind, we wait in trust
For the resurrection day. Amen.
Scripture, N.T., I Cor. 15, 20-26, 51-58.

For ever with the Lord !
Amen, so let it be :
Life from the dead is in that word,
’T is immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.
My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times, to faith’s foreseeing eye,
Thy golden gates appear !
Ah ! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.
For ever with the Lord !
Father, if ’t is Thy will,
The promise of that faithful word
Even here to me fulfil.
Be Thou at my right hand,
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand ;
Fight, and I must prevail.
So, when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death.
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,
And oft repeat before the throne,
‘ For ever with the Lord !’ Amen.

pumse Hymn 477-
Oiiß God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone.
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood.
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home. Amen.
benediction.
