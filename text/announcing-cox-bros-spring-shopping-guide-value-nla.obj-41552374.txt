Description of Figure (as below)
SPECIAL EEMAEKS:—
1. When coats or coats and vests only are ordered, kindly give seat measurements
of trousers —it enables us to give the necessary fullness in the skirt of coat.
2. Give exactly measure for seat of trousers. Allowance for ease is made when
cutting.
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURE:
FIGURE. —In all orders (even for trousers) kindly describe your figure: For this
purpose, instead of quoting ‘ ‘flat chest,’ ’ ‘ ‘Head forward, 5 ’ etc., we would prefer your
referring to the special plate of figures below, and quote the letter under the figure
to which your build is similar. For variations, quote, say, “Figure F, but less corpu-
lent, 5 ’ or ‘ ‘Figure H, but head forward like Figure M,’ ’ etc., etc.
P J K M
Place a cross (X) under the figure nearest your build.
In instances where these figures can be utilised they convey immediately to the
cutter your particular build, and will be of more service than any verbal description,
but in special cases where the figures as illustrated do not apply, the verbal description
should be as full as possible.
Please make special mention if prominent or full in front at waist and hollovr-
waisted at back.
For SHOULDERS also refer to ' ‘Slopes of Shoulders” as illustrated, and quote
accordingly.
Place a cross (X ) under the figure nearest your build.
HEIGHT.— It is essential that you give your height. This is a most important
factor to us, for if given correctly, it enables us to judge if the length measures sent,
namely, length of coat, vest, sleeves and legs, are right, as we are enabled by means
of height measure to correct errors in measurements, and thus give correct fit.
VERY ONE
NORMAL SQUARE SLOPING SLOPING SHOULDER LOW HIGH
Place a cross (X) under the figure nearest your build
AGE. —An order may reach us showing a chest measure of 35i indies. This may
be either for a man of advanced years who has developed a stoop, and whose chest
has become smaller; or it may be for a man of middle age who has attained his full
size; or perhaps a youth with a big frame, and who may later on be over 40 chest.
Although the chest measurements may be the same, it is of great importance to give
the approximate age with every order if you have no objection.
