RENEWAL OE IMMIGRATION.
MR. RANDALL IN CAIRNS
From the ?CAIRNS ARGUS? Saturday, December 12, 1896.
State Immigration.
Mr George Randall, whose name is
historical in connection with immigra-
tion to Queensland, is again in harness
after a spell of between two and three
years. Mr Randall?s retirement for the
space in question was born of the re-
construction and retrenchment tactics
deemed necessary by the Queensland
Government some three years ago;
his ability in this department was
never questioned, he was out of com-
mission for a time, and that was all.
When a public servant disappears from
public gaze for a time, long or short
frequently makes very little difference,
that particular individual is apt to be
forgotten, both by the Government
and the public. In this case it is not
so, and the Government again call on
an old and well-tried servant, now
that the time is deemed expedient for
another attack on the shores of Great
Britain. And the attack this time
will be in a friendly spirit, as it was
before. Nothing of the old-time paint-
ing now lingers about immigration to
Australia, we allude to the days when
a popular song had something to the
effect ?That be it understood, he left
his country for his country?s good.?
That Mr Randall is the right man
in the right place cannot be doubted,
in connection with this new mission
with the object of capturing an in-
fusion of new blood. The faults and
failures which undoubtedly attended
Queensland?s first attempts with re-
gard to ?assisted immigration? can-
not fairly be laid at his door. His
duties were laid down on fast and hard
lines, and he faithfully carried them
out. Queensland, on the other hand,
signally shirked its duty. The colony
bragged of its varied resources, pas-
toral, agricultural and mineral; but
the flag waved most persistently bore
the inscription ?Go on the land,
young man.? And then when the
young men arrived there, they couldn?t
find the land, and, if they happened
to find it, there was no market, and if
there was a market there was no rail-
way to carry their produce, if they
produced any. And, generally, after a
short trial the would-be tiller of the
soil came to the conclusion that the
agricultural immigrant?s life in
Queensland was not a happy one;
then he would naturally drift back
again to the port at which he landed,
or some other port. Then again he
might become a miner or a dozen
other things, and very good things too,
but not quite in accord with the
avowel immigration policy of the
Government of settling people on the
land. In this respect the policy of
the Government in the past has ad-
mittedly been a failure, the conditions
under which the immigration scheme
was worked being distinctly unfavor-
able with regard to many most im-
portant factors, for instance Land
Acts, railways, markets and so on.
YYe regret that with the limited space
at our disposal, in connection with
this article, we cannot dilate on the
business,
That was Mr Randall?s position be-
fore. His position is now a matter of
a new consideration. Instead of going
home to invite, or in order to invite, a
few or many ignorant agricultural
laborers to Queensland, he has now
something else to do. The Govern-
ment of Queensland, recognising the
old laws as silly and feeble, are going
in for something sensible. Mr Randall,
under the new auspices, will start on
a new line. His appeal will be to
people with a Itttle capital, and he will
be able to quote the new regulations of
the Queensland Government, which,
under the merry clauses of the Sugar
Works Guarantee Act, apparently
offers great attractions. Mr Randall
will go home with blessings of this
sort in his pocket, and more besides.
Apart from the Sugar Industry, with
a smiling assistance from the Govern-
ment, it has already been hinted that
it is the policy of Queensland to give
the same assistance with regard to
rice, wheat and other mills and indus-
tries, so that our immigration agent
will not only no home with a lot of
attractions in his pocket, but with a
lot of trump cards up his sleeve. To
put the matter briefly, it can be said
that Mr Randall, on his first expedi-
tion. went home with merely visionary
attractions, and on the present
occasion he goes to the dear old
country with something tangible.
It is satisfactory to note that Mr
Randall is at present in the district.
He can learn in the first place, and
teach in the second place, the fact that
thousands upon thousands of acres of
land in the district, hitherto un-
touched, have merely to be tickled in
order to smile a harvest. Sugar, corn,
coffee, or any other tropical product.
He has seen played out lands in
places further South, and can properly
estimate the capabilities of the virgin
soil abounding in the district, from
Freshwater Creek to the Russell.
Cairns has been described by ex-
perts as the natural home for coffee.
Mr Randall has been advised of this,
and after interviewing Mr Lewis, of
the Mount Graham plantation, Rus-
sell River, and Mr Alfred Street, of
Kuranda, and Mr G. R. Mayers, of
Myola, he will doubtless agitate the
business in the old country. Tempta-
tions exist in the direction of coffee.
It is on record that planters in
Southern India were in the habit of
making quick fortunes out of the
industry. And, it may be remarked,
coffee retains its price, and on the
commercial horizon there is as yet no
sign that the production will overtake
the demand. There are fortunes yet,
in all probability, sticking out in
Queensland for adventurers in the
coffee-growing industry.
From this very much disjointed
article it can doubtless be gathered
that we are of the opinion that Mr
Randall has, at the moment, an easy
task before him. In touching England
this time he can quote some of the
most liberal, social and co-operative
Acts ever passed. In passing them
Queensland has probably set an
example, one which will probably be
copied by the civilized world. We
wish Mr Randall every scccess.
Revival of Immigration-
ADVERTISING THE COLONY.
MR RANDALL INTERVIEWED
IN CAIRNS.
Mr George Randall, the well-known
Queensland Government immigration
lecturer, arrived in Cairns by the
Palmer on Thursday morning, having
previouslv visited Rockhampton,
Mackay, Bowen, the Burdekin Delta,
Townsville, and the Herbert River.
He purposes spending a few days in
our district so as to see for himself
what is being done in connection with
our sugar industry, and by coming in
contact with representative men, to
get in touch with our surroundings
and prospects. From Cairns Mr
Randall goes back to Brisbane, and
after a tour on Darling Downs, with
a view to seeing some of the re-pur-
chased lands, and what is being
done in wheat-growing, dairy produc-
ing, etc., hopes to leave for London
early in February. Appointed to this
position for the fourth time, and
having an experience in immigration
promotion that is probably unequalled,
we sought an interview with this
veteran immigration advocate, to learn
something as to the lines on which he
proposed to carry on his work in the
mother country on the present
occasion.
Asked by our representative ivhat
prospects there were of getting small
capitalists, Mr Randall replied:?
Well, it all depends on the way we
set about the business. It must be
remembered that although we hear
and read a great deal about the stream
of small capitalists going to Canada
and other countries, this is to a great
extent misleading. As a matter of
fact only a. comparatively small pro-
portion of immigrants to the countries
mentioned, are men of any capital,
and for the few of this class who
make up their minds to emigrate,
and annually leave Great Britain,
there is keen competition?the States,
Canada, the Cape, New Zealand, land
companies in Texas and California,
all advertising most extensively and
attractively, with a view to capture
them. Taking our own Australian
colonies again?quite apart from the
attractiveness of West Australia, for
?the moment, with its gold discoveries
they are all better known, and possess
better facilities for reaching than our
own. Their being better known comes
through their having more frequent
and more rapid direct communication.
This alone gives them a tremendous
advantage over us, as all these com-
panies advertise extensively through-
out the country, and the Australian-
inclined emigrant naturally books
to the place most familiar to him, and
in this way the Southern colonies get,
and have always got, the lion?s share
of full-paying passengers. This is a
matter of great importance to the
whole of our colony, but to your
Northern ports especially, ports north
of Mackay cannot hope to get many
of such people if they have to filter
round by the other Australian
capitals.
And how do you propose to counter-
act this, Mr Randall ? Well, I know
what is wanted ; it remains to be seen
whether it will be carried out. I
should like to see a fortnightly and a
more rapid service via Torres Straits,
and the owners of the line do some-
thing approaching what is done by
most of the companies running to the
South, to make known and popularise
this route to Queensland, in Great
Britain. No colony needs advertising
and making known as much as we do,
because we get no help in this direc-
tion from shipping companies. My
present mission is to remedy this as
far as possible, and I have suggested
as the first step towards it, the desir-
ability of having a third-class passage
rate at a pound or so lower than that
ruling to the other colonies. This the
Government are at present arrang-
ing, and I hope a fixture will be
made of a ï¿½l2 rate. This will be the
first great point gained. This pound
or so less to reach us than any other
part of Australia would often decide a
man in ourfavour, particularly a family
man. For young men of the middle
classes and such as would be likely to
be attracted to come out and go into
sugar planting, coffee growing and
the like it would be verv
desirable if a slightly reduced second-
class passage could be arranged, and
in your interests, a differential rate
to, say Townsville, and all ports north
of it. The next important feature in
my suggestions is the granting of a
small money bonus to shipping and
emigration agents, so as to secure
their interest and advocacy on our
behalf When it is known that there
are upwards of 4,000 of these agents
in Great Britain, that they come in
contact either personally or by letter
with the bulk of those emigrating,
and that the final choice and destina-
tion of the majority of them is in the
handsoftheagent,it will be seen that by
securing their interests we shall spread
a network of interested agency all
over Great Britain. I do not say
tnese agents will rouse people to go,
but they come in contact with those
who have made up their minds to go
somewhere, and in this way we stand a
good chance of having their attention
drawn to us, and a proportion
diverted to ours hores. I say
we must not be content to send
these agents an official circular
letter informing them of our offer and
intention, but some one having a know-
ledge of the colony should be told off
by the Agent-General to visit them
as rapidly in succession as possible
A few minutes interviewby such a man
is worth a dozen letters, andafter that,
the agent should be kept posted as to
the latest phases of all that is taking
place in the colony, by a small leaflet
I propose reviving and getting the
Agent-General to have issued once a
month. It may interest you to be
told that I have made a calculation ?
based on actual experience and trial?
that with all the splendid and
unequalled railway and other facilities
for travel and getting about in
England, it would take one man
three years to get round and give
these agents a single call, and by that
time he might well and wisely be
started to go the round again. Many
of these agents know nothing whatever
of Queensland, or of the existence of a
direct line of steamers to the colony,
and speaking as the result of all my
experience, I know of no work likely
to do the colony more good, or bring
about practical results of the
kind w'e want, than this same
calling on, interviewing, informing
and interesting the thousand and one
local agents all over Great Britain.
In addition to all this I regard it as a
necessity that the whole work should
be aided, helped, and pushed forward
by the Government undertaking the
best known means and methods to
effectively and extensively advertise
the colony and its resources.
I have been out of the service of
the Government now for nearly three
years, but during the latter part of my
last term I attended a number of the
best and largest agricultural shows
with samples of sugar, maize, rice,
wheat, flour, coffee, arrowroot, and so
on, with maps, plans and photographs,
and specially prepared literature,
among the latter was 75,000 copies of
Miss Shaws famous limes letter on
the sugar industry, and I had two
half millions of a pamphlet on wheat
growing. The Agricultural Depart-
ment are at present engaged in getting
together a much better collection of
samples and it is my intention to
again make an onslaught on the
British public through the medium of
her great agricultural shows. This
will be during the summer months.
In the winter I propose calling on
agents right and left as rapidly as I
can, though as I have shown, this alone
is one mans work. Needless to say
there are many other means of adver-
tising which suggest themselves from
time to time to any active mind en-
gaged in the work, and which I am
hoping, and have every reason to be-
lieve the Government will be willing
to carry out, and on their doing so or
otherwise, and 'their continuing the
present effort long enough, will depend
entirely the answer to the question
you put to me ?? What prospects are
there of getting small capitalists
emigrants?? Of course all our
previous systems have brought us
mainly the laboring and artizan class,
shall we get any of these under your
present proposals, Mr Randall?
We shall get no farm labourers
certainly, unless it is just an odd one
from the very best paid English
counties and from Scotland?-but
broadly?farm labourers were they
wanted ever so badly cannot be got
unless we offer them an absolutely
free passage, and then it would be ï¿½
work of intense difficulty. The same
applies to single women. There need
be no mistake about that. As to the
artizan class, well if things recover in
the colony and we were to advertise
and publish rates of wages ruling for
such (of which there is no intention)
we might succeed in attracting a few,
but the bulk of those who come, be
they what they may as to occupation
in the old country, will be at-
tracted under the present effort
to come to us by what they read or
hear as to the openings and opportuni-
ties the colony offers for settlement
on the land. But under all circum-
stances, if the Government do all I
have suggested and much more, we
need not look for immediate results,
and however determined and wide-
spread the assault we may be able to
make, my only fear is of our getting
too few, instead of the slightest fear
of getting too many.
Can we do anything locally to assist
you Mr Randall ? Yes, do as the
Mackay people talk of doing, sending
an agent and lecturer to the
south, and I suggdsted to them,
then send him over to help
me. In addition to what is done by
the Dominion Government for Canada,
each province sends its own special
representative, a sort of Agent-
General, your man would represent
the Cairns district only, he might
work side by side with me and we
should help each other. If not pre-
pared to act on this at the present
moment get up a special pamph-
let about your own resources,
and send it over to me by the tens of
thousands and I will see to its distri-
bution in the proper channels ? This
and much more we gleaned from Mr
Randall who is brimful of his subject,
and as enthusiastic as ever on behalf
of the colony and the favourable
claims it is entitled to make on the
British public if only the means are
placed at his disposal to do it justice.
