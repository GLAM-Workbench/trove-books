THE
ANGLER’S POCKET GUIDE,
BY
W. H. KINGSBURY,-
(Late Travelling Inspector of Fisheries),
VICTORIA.
iB»r.
HT|JHE success of' every Angler will mainly
depend on the nature of the Rod, Line,
Reel, Hooks, &c. he employs for the
capture of the particular fish he is in quest of.
fio to a good shop for fishing tackle. Cheap
tackle generally ends in disaster, loss of fish and
loss of temper.


Bods, Taclele, &c.
Rod.—For preference give me Hardy Bros.’
Octagon Steel Centre Cane Rod, or Greenheart,
Arabian Lancewood, West India Cane or Steel-
wood, which is said to be lighter, tougher and
stronger than Greenheart.
Reel or Winch. —A Nottingham, Ebonite, or
Brass Reel, with a spring or alarm in a ratchet
wheel, light and strong are the best. Slater’s
Combination Reel preferred.
Lines. —Green Waterproof Silk-plaited lines
are the best, as they do not kink and can be
obtained any substance.
Silkworm Gut. —Select gut that is evenly round
like wire, which can be obtained a Bluish, or
Sky-colour, by steeping it in Stephen’s Blue
Black Ink; a Green tinge, by using Crawshaw’s
Crystal Green Dye; or a Brown, or Peat colour,
by the use of Coffee lees or grounds.
Hooks. —Turned down Needle Eye Hooks o.f
all sizes, made by Bartleet & Son, or Alleock,
are the best for all kinds of Fish. For Worm-
fishing, a fairly long shank hook, perfectly round
in the bend; and for Gentles, Shrimps, Paste,
&c., short shank and sneck-bent hooks are
preferred. Test your hooks before using; if


they bend easily, they are but little good, being
too soft; if again they snap suddenly, they are
too hard, therefore choose the happy medium.
Floats. —A Turkey Quill, or a long taper Cork
Float, is considered the best; but a Slider
Float is indispensable if fishing in deep water, as
by its use, if your Rod is only 12 feet long, you
will find no difficulty in fishing in 20 feet of
water, or more if necessary.
Baits for Sea Fishing.
For Travalla (Neptonemus Travale). —
Crayfish cooked or uncooked, Shark, Sandworms,
Rabbit uncooked, Landworms, (scoured), and
Mutton. Cse a gut bottom from sto 6 feet
long, lightly leaded from 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 feet from
the Hook. Generally fish from 14 to 17 feet
deep. Use either Allcock’s 7 or 8 Limerick
Hooks, Bartleet,s 9 or 10 Limerick Turn-down
eyes, or Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes
10 or 11.
For Silver Fish (Caranx Georgianus).—
Cookies, Crayfish, Sandworms and Shark. Fish
similar to Travalla. Use same class and sizes
of Hooks.
For Whiting (Si'lago Punctata).—Cockles,


Squid, Mussels, or Boiled Crayfish. Your bait
should not be more than 1J to 2§ inches from
the bottom. Use plenty of” ground-bait,
consisting of Mussels, Cockle, or Oyster shells
broken up and strewed about where you intend
fishing. Moor your boat, bow and stern, to
prevent her swaying about. Fish on clear
ground, near the edge of a patch of weeds or
grass. In order that you may know you are
fishing on clear ground, use a Norwegian Water
Telescope, by which means you are enabled to
see the bottom to a depth of from 20 to 80 feet,
if the water is clear. Use Nos. 5,6 or 7
Allcook’s Limerick Hooks, Bartleefs 8, 9 or 10,
or Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes, 8,9 or 10.
One length of Gut is all that is necessary,
attached to your line.
For Mullet (Dajaus Diemenses). —Sand-
worms, Boiled Crayfish, Small Mussels (boiled),
Gentles, Corned-beef Fat, The fat intestine of a
fish, Cabbage boiled in broth, or anything
decomposing is also used with great success.
Fish with a Paternoster Bottom, that is, the
bottom is made of from 4 to 5 feet of strong gut
or fine gimp; at the end attach a bullet of from
3to 1 oz. in weight. About 9 inches above the
bullet, make a loop, and at intervals of 12
inches, make three more loops, to each of which


your hooks on put should be attached. Use as
an attraction to .he fish, a small round meshed
net (about as large as a good size cabbage),
filled with tainted, or -putrid meat, obtained
from any butcher’s boiling down works, Pink it
to the bottom, attached to a strong cord, which
will enable you to draw it up at any time you
may wish to shift to some other place. The
odour from the contents of your net will draw
the fish to you, and they will keep around for
hours. Use Nos. fi, 7 or 8 Allcock's Limerick
Hooks, Bnrtleet’s 9, 10 or 11 Turn-down eyes, or
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes, 9, 10 or 11.
For Schsapper (Pagrus Unicolor). —Pilchards
Whitebait, Squid, Small Mullet, or Salmon
Trout, or the liesh and skin of the Silver Fish,
or the Australian Chimera. Moor your boat
bow and stern, as near to the edge of a reef as
possible. If using s Rod (for medium size
Schnapper 11 to 5 lbs. weight', have your bait
about 2 feet below your leul bullet, which
should be running. If fishing with a handline
for large Schnapper you require a much
heavier lead, from 2 to 3 ounces, (sometimes
more). Your Hooks should be attached from
loops on your line, the first about 15 or 18 inches
from the lead, which should be on the bottom, the
second about the same distance above the first.


Ground-bait, with Mussel, Cockles, or Oyster
Shells, smashed up and strewed about where
Ashing. Use Nos. 2, 3 and 4 extra quality
Kirby Sea H»oks Bartleet’sfor Large Schnapper,
or Nos. 6 and 7 for small Schnapper; or
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes No. 2,0 3;0
4/0 or 5/0.
For Small Salmon Trout (ArripisTruttaceus)
—Small Pilchards, Whitebait, Sandworms,
Spoon-bait, Flashes, or Spinners. When in or
amongst a shoal of salmon trout, it is best to let
your Boat drift. Fish with a Paternoster
bottom and light lead, sufficient to keep it 3or
4 feet under water, similar to that described for
Mullet. For the large Australian Salmon, one
large Spinner, Flash, or Spoon-bait is quite
sufficient, as these fish are exceedingly strong
in the water, and require both patience and
skill to land them. Use Nos. 5, Cor 7 Allcock’s
Limerick Hooks, Bartleet’s Nos. 8, 9 or 10,
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes, 8, 9 or 10.
For the Large Salmon, Nos. 2/6 8/0 4/0 or 5/0
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes.
For Garfish (Hemiramphus Melanochir).—
Sandworms, Small Mussels (boiled), Gentles and
Boiled Crayfish. Fish with a Paternoster
Bottom, similar to that described for Mullet an 1
Small Salmon-Trout, having a small shot at


each loop, sufficient to sink it a foot or two
under water, because Garfish is a surface fish,
and they are seldom caught below 4 or 5 feet in
depth. They are taken both when drifting and
at anchor. Use 7, Bor 9 Allcock Limerick
Hooks, Bartlcet’s Nos. 12, IS or 14 Limerick
Turn-down eyes, or Pennell Limerick Turn-down
eyes No. 11,12 or IS.
Fon Fi.athkad (Platycephalus Icevigatus).—
Squid, Mussels, Shark, Whitebait or Raw Beef.
Fish drifting, with a handline, similar to that
mentioned for Schnapper. .Use No. 7 or 8
Bartleet’s Limerick Hooks Turn-down eyes, or
3, 4 or 5 Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes.
For Lisa (Genypterus Australis). —Squid,
Shark, Rabbit, Reef or Mutton. These fish are
generally caught on what is termed set-lines;
that is, the length of the lines used would be
from 500 to 1,000 yards long, with hooks attached
therefrom about every 3 feet. The drop line
with weight attached at each end, allows the
hooks to trail on the bottom, there is also a
buoy at the top of the drop lino to indicate
where they are set. 11 se hooks Nos. 0, 1 and 2
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes.
For Rock Cod (Pseudoplycis Barbatus). —
Same as for Ling in every respect.


For Pike (Sphyrxna Novoe Hollandia).—
Squid, Whitebait. Pilchard, Small Mullet or
Salmon-trout. Fish drifting under sail. In
strong, windy weather your lino should be not
less than 12 fathoms long, having from 50 to CO
barrel or taper leads, varying in distance from
6 inches apart, from the first or nearest lead to
the hook, up to 15 inches at the finish. There
should be about a fathom of finer line (clear)
from the hook to the first lead. The hooks are
looped through each other, and the bait is
attached by passing the barbs of each hook
through. • lu light or calm weather your line
should he 15 fathom's in length, having from 20
to 25 leads. The first about 10 inches from the
ne ct, an 1 gradually increase th ; distance between
them up to 10 inches at the finish. Both line and
le ids are finer, and there should be from 4 to 5
fathoms clear line from the hooks. I 'se Pennell
Ijirnerick Turn-down eyes Nos. 5/0,4/0-or 3/0.
For Barracoota (Thyrsites Atun Kuph).—
Red Cloth tied round the Hook, Spoon-bait, one
side painted Red, a piece of Cedar, in fact
anything painted Red. Fish sailing as for Pike.
Use Bartleet’s extra quality Kirby Sea Hooks
Nos. 1 and 2.
For BrjSAM 'Chrysophrys Australis).—Shrimps
Whitebait, Vabbies, Mussel", Crabs, Fandwonm


Garfish, River Minnows, Red Worms and
Rullocks or Sheep’s River. There are two
methods of catching Bream, viz., Float and
Bottom fishing. For the former, use ft Slider
Float, and lead your Gut Bottom with Swan
Shot; remember it is better to have a.number
of shot on at different distances of a few inches,
and let your bait touch or trail on the bottom
If the latter, your Gut or line Sydney line
bottom should be at least one yard in length,
with a small running bullet or barrel lead.
Bream frequent deep, still waters, where weeds
abound. 1 am a great believer in ground
baiting the place or swim where you intend
fishing, over night, with Mussels, or Cockles,
crushed up, Boiled Potatoes. Bread and pellets
of bran kneaded together, Boiled wheat, grains,
rice &o. Use Pennell’s Needle-eye Hooks Turn-
down Nos. 1, 2 or 3, or Rartleet’s Nos. 1, 2 or 8
or Allcock’s Rimerick 2, 3 or 4.
Rudrrick (Crendiens Simplex)'—Bait and
fish same as for Bream. Use Nos. 8, 4 and 5
Hooks.
For English Brown Spotted Trout (Salmo
fario).—Unlike other freshwater fish, they spawn
during the winter months, making their way
into shallow water, and stirring up the gravel to
cover their ova. In most rivers they are slow in


their growth. This, I think, as far as Victoria
is concerned, is owing to the temperature of ths
water. In New Zealand and Tasmania, where
the temperature is so much cooler, they thrive
to a remarkable extent. Fly Fishing, i.e.,
whipping the stream with an artificial fly, is the
most artistic and enjoyable way of fishing for
trout. It is very difficult to mention any special
kind of artificial Hies, but those which do the
greatest execution in New Zealand rivers are the
Coachman, Governor, Hardy’s Favourite, Blue
Dun, Rod Palmer, Black Gnat, Alexandra,
March Brown, and Hardy’s Fly Minnow.
For Trolling. —Use Transparent Amber Devons.
Hardy’s Improved Halcyon Spinner, The Maori
Inanga or New Zealand Minnow, Soleskin or
Whitebait Phantom’s Nos. 0 to 2 are the best.
The belly silvered, all the rest a parchment
colour, with no paint on, the colour of parch-
ment when wet. Artificial Phantom Minnows
Brown Backs Gold Belly, Nos. 2, 3 and 4, and
Devons' either Gold, Silver, or Silver Brown No.
2. For Live hait. —Grasshoppers, Beetles,
Minnows, Crickets, Yabbies, Scoured Worms,
Shrimps, Mud Eyes and Gentles. These baits
are all suitable for Victorian Waters. Use a
dark fly for dork waters, and a bright fly for
bright waters, is the rule laid down by the best
fly fishers in England, New Zealand and


Tasmania. Two flies are enough to use, the
stretcher” or tail fly, and a ‘*|drop’’ or bob fly.
It has been found to be an excellent plan to cast
your tail fly on a stone in the river, and by
tightening your line your drop-fly will act as a
searcher at the back. The best time for fly
fishing, is, as a rule, from day-break till about
9 o’clock, and from 4 o’clock till dark. In
Spinning, the Summer months are the best, and
a trout if at' all inclined to feed, can seldom
resist an artificial minnow, if properly offered to
him. When practicable wade if you can, and
when you cannot, crouch, stoop and crawl, as
best you can, hide yourself behind bushes, trees,
&c., for the simple reason that trout are the
most quick-sighted of fish, and you should not
allow them to see you more than you can help.
Trout as a rule lie with their heads up jtream,
therefore fish up stream rather than down.
Use a shortish line, which can be, thrown to a
desired spot with much greater accuracy than a
long one. There is undoubted authority to
prove that a good angler working up stream will
kill nearly two fish, to every one taken down.
When you reach a stream, mark the most
likely spots for trout to lie, as most of their
time is spent close to the bank under rocks and
undergrowth. Worm Fishing for Trout is
another deadly method. When the water is


discoloured, and the run of a river is specially
adapted for this work, the ordinary angler cun
let the stream wash his worm into likely places,
and he is almost certain tcuget llsh. When the
water is low and clear, lie must tish up stream,
use the finest tackle consistent with strength,
and he particular to use a well-scoured Marsh
or Lob worm. Use Nos. C, 7or 8 Allcoek’s
Liimerick Hooks, Hartlect’s !), 10 or 11, or
Pennell Limerick Turn-down eyes 9, 10 or 11.
Some anglers prefer the Snook bent same sizes.
The Grayling (Salmo Thymallusl. Fresh-
water Herring, sometimes called the “ Cucumber
Fish,” rise freely at natural and artificial flies,
red-worms, grasshopper, Gentles, &c. The flies
that kill trout, kill grayling, (but smaller in size
and a finer gut bottom I. The same rules an* to
observed in both branches of Fly fishing. They
are bottom feeders to a much greater extent
than trout, but, unlike the trout, will come up
through many feet of water to take a tty. The
tail of deep pools are the best spots for large
grayling. In winter, or frosty weather, Grayling
will take very freely a well scoured Ked-worra.
fishing with a float, so that it swims down the
stream a foot from the bottom. The grayling
may also be taken by “dapping,” by what is
termed the “ Grasshopper practice," which is
now the most popular, because the most


efficacious for taking the largest fish. The
artificial bait called the “ Grasshopper" is more
like a caterpillar. It is simply a wndge of
various coloured wool, about J inch in length,
bound round the shank of a hook and made to
taper towards the tail. At the tail, that is, on
the bend of the hook, thread on as many
gentles as you can, till the bend and barb of the
hook is almost entirely covered. Use a
moderately stout gut bottom, and a small quill
fleat. The “ Grasshopper" you work on what is
called “ the sinking and drawing principle;"
that is, you let it down till it touches the bottom,
then keep raising it a foot or so. and letting it
sink again. The stream must not be too rapid,
gently carrying your bait a little further on
each time. The bait thus “hops,” and is
considered to be the most slaughtering tackle
used for grayling. Use No. sor 6 Hooks, either
Allcock’s Limerick, or Pennell’s or Bartleet’s
Limerick turn-down eyes.
English Pekch (Perea flulviatilis). — For
ordinary Bait fishing use Minnows, small Gold
Fish, small Carp, Yabbies, Frogs, Brandling
Worms, Shrimps and Mud-eyes Fish with a
PUternoster Bottom and 2 hooks (same as
described for Mullet, Page 4). Use Allcoek’s
Limerick Hooks Nos. 5, 6 or 7, or Bartleet’s


Limerick Turned down eyes 7 or 8, or Pennell’s
Turn down eyes, 7, 8 or 9. For Spuming or
Trolling use Live Minnow, Transparent Amber
Devons, Whitebait Phantoms, Halcyon Spinner,
Maori Inanga, or Flashes.
English Tench (Tinea Vulgaris).—Sweet
honey and brown bread made into a paste is
perhaps the best general bait; Lob worms,
gentles, garden slugs, mud eyes. Balsam of
Tolu, Saffron, Oil of Aniseed, and Bhodinm and
Asafoetida mixed with paste is said to have a
peculiar attractiveness to tench. Do not hold
your rod when fishing for tench, but only taka it
up when your float is moving off. You must
fish both close to, and on the bottom according
to circumstances, and suit your ground-bait to
the nature of the soil. If a gravelly bottom,
ground bait with clay, gentles, bullock’s blood
and chopped worms. On a muddy or clayey
bottom, gentles, garden slugs, bread and clay
thrown in the night before. The angler will
assuredly have good sport in the morning.
Tench feed morning and evening, and all day in
warm, showery weather. Use a quill float, gut
bottom 6 to 6 feet long, stained a light green.
They are wary, and do not gorge the bait
quickly, but require time. When the float lies
flat, it shows they are rising with the bait, and


the proper time to strike is when the fish begins
to moTH oIT, which is shown by the float gliding
away. Use No. 6,7 or 8 Hooks, either Allcock’s,
Bartleet’s, or Hardy’s.
English Roach (Cyprinus Rutilus)—Red
Worms, gentles, sweet paste, made with a little
honey, gin and new bread, with a little essence
of Anchovies added, has a killing effect when
all other means have failed. Your line must he
be fine, a gut bottom from 6 to 8 feet long,
stained to the colour of the water, a light quill
float, so weighted that the tip only appears above
the surface of the water. Plumb the depth, and
ground-bait the night before, with paste,
oatmeal and treacle made into small balls.
Your shot should be fixed about a foot to 15
inches above your bait, which should be from
two to three inches off the bottom. Use
Bartleet’s or Pennell Uimerick turn-down Eye
Hooks, Nos. 10 or 11, short shanks.
English Cakp (Cyprinus Carpio).—The
difficulty in capturing these fish has caused a
variety of baits to be used, such as scented
pastes, green peas, gentles, brandling worms,
grasshoppers, Bluebottle fly and boiled wheat.
The best, however, is a sweet paste made with
honey and balsam of Tolu. They will not bite
in cold or windy weather, and in sunny weather


they leave their muddy haunts, which they love,
for the shallows. If possible have the sun in
front of you, and not behind you; above all keep
quiet. In weedy waters fish a foot from the
bottom, with a light float and gut bottom. Pome
celebrated anglers in the old country agree in
recommending that the bait should lie on the
ground some 6 inches, and that the angler should
not strike till ho sees his float well carried off.
Ground-bait with pellets of paste, chopped
worms, a few grains of rice, boiled potatoes, or
small pieces of whatever bait you are using.
Use the same size hooks that you would for
Roach.
Blackfish (Gadopsis Marmoratus). —Worms,
Grubs, Gentles, Shrimps, Mud-eyes, Entrails of
Birds and Sheep’s melt. Fish with a Paternoster
Bottom of Gimp with 2 hooks as described for
Perch. The haunts of the Blackfish are around
and under fallen The best time for
fishing is from early morn till about 9 a.m., and
from 4 p.m. till after dark. The native blacks
affirm that when the wattle trees are in bloom,
the blackfish are in best condition. Groundbait
with boiled potatoes, pellets of bran, and chopped
worms. Use 4, 5 and 6 Hooks, either Allcock’s
Limerick, or Pennell’s, or Bartleet’s Limerick
Turn down eyes.


Qippsland Perch (Latris Colonorum). —
Shrimps, Whitebait, Yabbies, Mussels, Crabs,
Sandworms and Cockles. Fish same as for
Bream and Luderick. There is also another
method, viz:—let your bottom hook be about 18
inches to 2 feet below the lead, laying on the
ground, the second hook about a foot from the
bottom. Ground-bait as for Bream. When the
waters are coming off the flat-laying lands, there
is splendid sport to be obtained with these fish
by fishing from a boat in mid-stream, casting an
Artificial Fly on to the edge of the bank and
allowing it to sink down under water. At this
season of the year, viz., about the latter end of
October or November, the Perch are feeding on
the insects, which are being washed off the
low-laying lands, and they lake the Fly greedily.
The Artificial Flies are Nos. 1 and 2 Red and
Black and Yellow and Black made expressly for
the Gippsland Perch.
“Recipes for Preserving Bait.”
As the angler very often finds a difficulty in
keeping his baitfresh and sweet in hot weather,
I will give a few simple recipes which I have


proved to be very successful in preserving bait
during the hottest weather for weeks, as follows,
viz:—
To preserve Shrimps.
Fill a 2 lbs. Salt or Preserve Jar (those having
a screw lid or cap are the best) with shrimps.
Care must be taken to cull out any pieces of
seaweed that may be among them. Heap in a
couple or three handsful of common salt; pour
water on to dissolve the salt; drain off the
liquor each day, adding more salt until there is
no more to drain; secure the jar tightly by
hermetically sealing it, in order to exclude the
air. Shrimps preserved in this manner last for
months during the summer season, keep their
colour, are tougher, which is a great advantage,
and have been used with great success.
To preserve Whitebait.
Sprinkle freely common salt over the White-
bait ; spread them on cloth, or coarse bag, in
order to drain, and when firm, lay them in
layers on blotting paper to absorb all moisture.
Put them in a box, close the lid tight to exclude
the air, and they will keep fresh for two or
three weeks.


To preserve Garfish.
Gut them first, and treat them in the same
manner,
To preserve Mussels.
When opening the Mussels select those that
are white in the flesh. After detaching them
from the shell put them in a colander or
perforated tin, sprinkle common salt over them
freely; handle them daily by turning them
over, still sprinkling salt over them, until all the
liquor possible is drained from them. Cork
tightly in a jar to exclude the air. By this
means they become tough, keep their color,
and will remain fresh for months.
To keep Minnows,
River Minnows can be kept alive in an
hermetically sealed jar, three parts full of river
water, for several days.
To preserve Worms.
Worms may be preserved and scoured in
several ways. The first is to keep them in moss
in a large unglazed earthenware flower pot.


The moss must be clean-picked, damped, and
the worms placed at the top and a little cream
or milk sprinkled on them, and the pot then set
aside in a cool place. If the worms are not for
immediate use, some well-rotted dung and rich
mould may be placed at the bottom of the pot,
and the moss kept damp. Worms treated in
this way quickly scour, are lively and long-lived
in the water. Every day or two they should be
looked over, and the bruised and sickly ones
thrown away.
Another plan is to soak a clean coarse
hempen or liuen sloth in water in which some
mutton suet has been boiled. When cold, put it
into a tub with the worms, and some fresh
mould, and tie over the top a linen cloth to
admit air. Keep ihe whole in a cool situation
and the worms will keep lively and fit for use
for many months.
To scour Worms for immediate use.
To a Gallon of Water, add a teaspoonful of
common salt. Wash the worms in the water for
a few minutes, then in clean water; put them
in damp moss into a bait box or canvas bag;
add a little “ Bole Armenian finely powdered,
which greatly improves both their color and
appearance.


To scour Worms for Trout.
The best worm for a Trout is the “Marsh"
worm,” or a well scoured “Lob-worm.” The
Marsh and Lob worms if, scoured in moss and
fed with a teaspoonful of milk, will become
lively, tough and clean; and if scoured also with
fennell and fed with milk, emit a fragrant
aroma, much liked by the trout.
“ To scour Maggots or Gentles.”
Perhaps the best for angling purposes that
can be procured, are those obtained from a
sheep’s head, bullock’s liver, or from a crayfish.
When it is fully blown, place it in a tub half full
of bran or sand, for the maggots to scour and
clean themselves. They are scoured and made
tough by keeping them for three or four days in
sand or bran. In warm weather they must be
kept in a vessel filled with damp sand, in any
cool and shady place; in the winter they should
be kept in a large earthenware jar, in a cellar,
and protected from frost. Use the best golden
sand, as silver sand is too hard and gritty.
If gentles are wanted in winter the same
process must be followed, and when the piece of
meat or game is well blown, it is laid in a long
box, half-filled with dry pulverised cow-dung


and sifted mould moistened. The same
compost is sifted over the carcass and gradually
pressed down. The box may be then buried in
the earth, or placed in a cool situation. The
gentles can be taken from one end of the box
without disturbing the others.
Balts and Ground Balt.
Common or Bluehead Worm, scours readily
and lives long in the water. It is an excellent
bait. Trout bite at it readily, and few river fish
will pass it by. They are to be found in rich
garden mould, round the roots of plants, and
under old heaps of decaying vegetable matter.
Brandlings are capital bait, and are found in
old dunghills.
Red Worms are a good tough bait and are
found in old tan heaps, and are also one of the
best general baits for all fish.
Meal Worm is a sort of grub common in old
flour mills. It is much liked by trout and other
fish. Requires no scouring and may be kept in
meal.
A favourite bait is paste made from arrowroot


busouit.
Trout and other fish bite well at cockroach
The best greaves are those made by lard
renderers and refiners. To prepare it for use, it
is broken up and scalded. Tne whitish portions
are chosen for the hook.
Boiled Malt, Barley, or Wheat is a famous
bait for roach. Wheat should be steeped all
night in plenty of luke-warm water, and then
placed in a warm oven for several hours,”' until
the skin cracks and shows the white farina.
Malt is prepared in a similar way.
To make a capital paste bait, take some of the
inside of a loaf of white or brown bread, put it
into a rag, dip it into water once, then screw the
rag round the lump, and knead it between the
fingers by pressing the lump in the rag. Add a
little lint, or cotton wool, and some Vermillion
to give it a pink colour.
Sweet Paste is made by adding honey to
bread crumbs, adding a small quantity of Gin,
and then work it to a proper consistence.
Cheese Paste is made of new cheese and
stale bread.
Adhesive Pastes are made of size obtained
by boiling parchment or white leather cuttings


in water. These are useful in rapid waters.
Ground Baits are nearly as varied as th
baits. A swim should be ground-baited from 15
to ‘2O hours before Ashed.
Meal Ground-bait consists of bread, bran, or
oatmeal, well kneaded with water into tough
balls.
Boiled rice, raw rice, and white sago, is a good
ground-bait for Whiting, Mullet, Bream, Roach,
Trout or Perch.
In deep water, one of the best ground-baits is
bran, clay, gentles or worms, kneaded together,
with a small stone in the middle; as the worms
or gentles crawl out, it attracts the Ash to your
bait.
To make a clean pleasant ground-bait soak
the crusts of a loaf in warm water till quite soft,
drain off the water, add bran and mashed
potatoes worked into a sort of dough.
In any instance use ground-bait sparingly.o
Without the use of ground-bait, for many Ash,
the chance of success to an angler is small.


Hints to Anglers.
The best winds for fishing are a South,
South West, West, or North West.
East— or North East winds—are the worst
of all winds.
With a South or West Wind, (no matter how
cold), English Trout will be on the feed, more
or less, throughout the day.
Keep still, and as much under cover as you
can, and fish up stream when possible.
A gentle, or even a small strip of White Kid
glove, put on the bend of your fly-hook, will
often induce English Trout to rise when nothing
else will.
In Worm-fishing, cast up stream and allow it
to float down for the following reasons:—
Ist—Trout lie head up stream, and therefore
do not see the angler.
2nd—The bait floats gently down without
injury.
3rd—ln striking the fish, the hook is much
more likely to hold in this way, than if struck in
the line of the axis of bis-body.


4th—The water is not disturbed, till it has
already been fished.
When you feel a bite wait a moment or two,
until he has done nibbling, and the moment he
is running oil with it, strike smartly but tenderly
Do not use a multiplying Reel, as they are apt
to get out of order, by your line getting jammed,
in consequence of the rapidity of its action.
Never use White gut, but stain it either
Sky-blue, Brown, or Green.
Keep the point of your Rod well up while
playing your fish. It you lower the point of
your Rod so that the strain comes straight on to
your Reel, you will lose your fish to a certainty.
In Perch fishing “ give them time” for
remember Perch has a tender mouth, and
therefore should not be struck too sharply, or
played too roughly.
Hot weather is the best for Tench fishing, but
not when the sun is shining. The best time is
early morn and late in the evening.
Bream are sensitive to the vibration of sound,
such as that produced by the feet on the floor of
a boat or punt. Anglers may therefore lay it
down as a rule that quietness is a. sine-qui-non


for successful Ashing.
There is one great essential item, both in
Aoat and bottom Ashing, viz., both line and gut
bottom should be either a green or dark colour.
Electrical disturbances affect all Ash more or
less. Carp are more sensitive than any other
Ash. The Arst Aash of lightning, whatever time
it may be, give up and go home.
Worms are best kept in a Aannel bag, which
may be attached to the coat by a loop. When
baiting rub the ends of your forefinger and
thumb of both hands in sand, bran, or dry
earth to prevent the worm slipping.
In dry weather there is great difficulty in
obtaining worms, but if the ground is well
soaked with a strong solution of salt and water,
or water in which walnut shells have been
boiled, it will bring them speedily to the
surface.
Baits should, if possible, be kept alive until
about to be used, but when dead they are best
kept in bran, and a damp cloth over them
preserves their freshness.
Strong Gin or Spirits of Wine will also
preserve them, if they can be nicely laid Aat in
a box and the air kept from them.


A piece of Bed Feather fastened on the end of
the tripod hooks of Flashes, Spinners, or Spoon
baits, adds greatly to their killing powers. It is
much better than red wool, as it dries quicker,
and is not so liable to rust the hooks.
In Fly-fishing, oil both hackle and wings by
means of a small camel’s hair brush, with a drop
or two of paraffin oil, which causes the fly to
i float, and not become sodden and sink.
Soak your gut casts in water before com-
mencing to fish.
In baiting with a live Minnow, pass the hook,
(which should be a sneck or square bent, short
shank), through both lips, the upper one first,
as this allows them to breathe. Minnows live
longer when hooked through both jaw and lip,
than the upper lip only.
Bream seize a Minnow or Whitebait by the
head, Perch by the middle, and Trout by the
tail.
One of the best artificial “ Spinning Baits” are
11 Jardme’s India Bubber Convolutes,” or the
“ Serpentanio.”
Norwegian Water Telescope.
Norwegian Fishermen use a Water Telescope


to ascertain the position of Herring Shoals. It
consists of a Brass or Zinc tube, funnel shape,
from 3 to 3£ feet long, and from 6 to 9 inches in
diameter at the bottom, with lead, in the form
of a ring, to weight the tube at the bottom.
Painted a dull black inside, with a clear thick
piece of glass at the bottom. Objects can be
seen at the bottom of the sea, or river, many
fathoms deep. It is useful, and almost
indispensable for Whiting or Bream fishing
from a boat, and enables the angler to see the
sort of bottom he is fishing on.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
The Australasian, Ado 21st, 1897.
Mr. W. H. Kingsbury, at one time travelling
inspector of flsherias for the Victorian Govern-
ment, has sent me a proof copy of a little
booklet, entitled “ The Angler’s Pocket Guide,”
and, to use a hackneyed phrase, it should supply
a long-felt want It contains all the necessary
information that an angler is most in need of.
It tells you how to choose an outfit, the bait
required for all sporting fish, recipes for
preserving baits, places worth visiting for sport
(coast or bay fishing, with accommodation at
them), and how to reach them ; and even a cure
for sea-sickness. As it is being published at a
moderate price, it should have a ready sale

A VALUABLE WORK FOR ANGLERS.
Publication by Mr. W. H. Kingsbury.
For a long time past Victorian anglers have been


sadly in need of a handy guide by a recognised
authority as to the best fishing grounds in the
colony, the species of fish obtainable at different
places, and the best manner of hooking them,
&c. Mr. W. H. Kingsbury, the popular late
travelling inspector of fisheries, has now taken
the matter in hand, and bis unequalled know-
ledge of angling as it obtains in Victoria, has
enabled him to produce a little pocket volume
which admirably fulfils its purpose, and has
strong claims for consideration as the “Walton”
of the colony, The amount of valuable informa-
tion which the author of “The Angler’s Pocket
6uide”'has compressed into 50 miniture pages is
simply astonishing. There is the advice of a tho-
rough expert as to the choosing of rods, reels lines,
gut, hooks, and floats; a complete list of the best
baits for catching every description of fish
known to exist in Australian seas and inland
lakes and rivers ; simply and cleverly imparted
information as to the best possible means of
filling a basket: recipes for preserving and
scouring all kinds of baits in all weathers;
invaluable hints to anglers, including even a
defence against mosquitoes, sandflies, Ac., and
a cure for seasickness; a complete list of all the
coastal and inland fishing grounds, with infor-
mation as to how to reach them and where to
stay while holiday-making, as well as a list of
the species of fish which abound at different
places; the schedule of weights of fish pro-
claimed under the Fisheries Act, the close


seasons for various kinds of fish at different
places and many other matters of equal interest
to anglers. The work is a thorough epitome
of information required to guide anglers in
fishing successfully from one end of the colony
to the other. Its production will probably lead
to the enjoyment by the reader of many days
capital sport, and while its circulation must swell
the numbers of those who follow the delightful
sport of angling, it will in many cases prevent
the loss of time and temper attendant upon
unsuccessful outings. Mr Kingsbury’s commend-
able energy in preparing the work has not been
unrewarded. Copies were ordered from all
parts of the colony; those who recognise
the author’s special knowledge forwarded
orders for the book immediately it was known
that Mr. Kingsbury had decided to take
it in hand. The guide, which will be bound
in a neat and very durable way, is to be
published at a low price of a shilling.
Ballarat Courier, Auo. 14th, 1897.
Mr. W. H. Kingsbury, one of the most suc-
cessful and best informed anglers in Victoria,
and who was lately travelling inspector of
fisheries, has prepared for the information and
convenience of anglers generally a very neat
little book entitled “The Angler’s Pocket Guide.”


It is the size which can be placed in waistcoat
pocket, and while so small in volume it is replete
with the most useful information for all who
take an interest in the Waltonian art. Among
the matters Mr. Kingsbury deals with are the
initiatory proceedings of choosing a rod, reel,
and fishing tackle generally, and by a very proper
gradation he then goes on to describe the best
bait for various kinds of fish, the enumeration
of the fish themselves being almost educated in
matters piscatorial in this colony. Then follows
useful information for preserving and preparing
bait The tackle and the bait having been
procured we are then led to various waters,
methods of angling and not the least interesting
item is a cure for sea-sickness. Mr. Kingsbury
in the pursuit of his favourite sport, has been in
every part of the colony where there is water to
be fished in, and he details, for the information
of all and sundry, the places worth visiting for
sport, for coast or bay fishing, places of
accommodation and means for reaching each
one of them, not even excepting such information
as to the fares by railway and coach. That the
anglers may not make any grievous blunders by
their urgent pursuit of fishing the little book
contains particulars as to the restriction placed
upon fishing, minimum weights of the various
fish, close seasons, and the different places, and
instructions as to what appliances for catching
fish are prohibited in Victoria. The matter in
the book is compressed, and in view of the value


of it, the price at which it is issued—l s, is very
low.
Geelong Advertiser, Aug. 16th, 1897.
“The Anglers’ Pocket Guide” is the title of a
remarkable handy little, but conprehensive,
volume written by Mr. W. H. Kingsbury, of
Ballarat, and formerly of Geelong, who is known
as a most successful and well-informed angler.
The Guide is issued in a form which will com-
mend itself to all rod and line men, for the
immense amount of useful information contain-
ed in the book can be evidently carried in a
waist-coat pocket for reference. It deals in
an interesting manner with the question of
choosing a rod, reel and fishing tackle, the
different kinds of baits to be used in luring the
various descriptions of fish to the hooks, the
methods of preserving baits, places worth
visiting for sport (including coast, bay fishing
and accomodation), and the means of reaching
them, a schedule weights of fish, the close
seasons, and a variety of bther information of
great value to anglers. The guide is issued at one
shilling, so that it is within the reach of every
angler, and the anglers “kit” will not be complete
without a copy of the book of directions.

AN ANGLER’S COMPANION.
A very handy and useful little work, entitled
the “The Angler’s Pocket Guide,’, has just been
published, and it should, now that the season for
anglingissocloseathand,flnd alarge circulation
among the many followers of the gentle pastime in
the colony, for almost every locality likely to pro-
vide sport for the angler is fully described, and all
information given as to the different varieties of
of fish likely to be met with. The compiler (Mr.
W. H, Kingsbury) is without doubt the greatest
authority upon angling in the colony; he has
been all his life-time an enthusiastic disciple of
Izaak Walton; and in addition, occupied for
many years the position of travelling inspector
of fisheries in Victoria. In the little work under
notice, and which, by the way, is got up in such
a handy form that it may be carried without the
slightest inconvenience in a vest pocket, he
supplies a marvellous amount of useful
information concisely given. This includes the
selection of tackle; complete*directions as to
the most suitable baits for trevalla, silverflsh,
whiting, mullet, sohnapper, salmon trout,
garfish, flathead, ling, rook cod, pike, barracoota,
bream, luderiok, English trout, grayling, English
perch, tench roach, carp, blackflsh, Gippsland
perch; recipes for preserving, all varieties of
baits, and a host of advice and hints that would
prove of benefit to the angler. “The Angler’s
Pocket Guide” is offered at Is.per copy,and we


should imagine, from a glance through the book,
that the purchaser need never be at a loss as to
the best methods of angling in any of the
Victorian waters.
