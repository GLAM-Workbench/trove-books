The Centre-flowers, which we manufacture in embossed steel, give an
exceptional opportunity for effective ceiling decoration at a very
moderate cost. They are bold and crisply stamped, and we supply
them already primed on both surfaces with a coat of the best oil
paint. They are made in sizes that will work in economically with
our ceiling materials.
No. 832. 1ft. 6in. x 1ft. 6in.
These steel panels have been specially designed
to take circular centre-flowers. We perforate
each panel so as to allow sufficient ventilation.
The zinc Centre-flowers are supplied either
separate or fixed in panels complete. We
advise the use of these panels in all cases,
as by their employment the awkward cutting
of the ceiling pattern is avoided.
