THE DAY WE CELEBRATE
OCTOBER 20, 1914.
DEPARTURE OF THE BATTALION FROM THE OUTER
HARBOR, OCTOBER 20, 1914.
TWENTY years ago the Tenth Battalion embarked on the transport “Asca-
nius” at the Outer Harbor, and sailed for a destination unknown. Formed
in August, 1914, the first Infantry Unit raised in South Australia for service
in the Great War, its members included representatives from every part of the
State, and from Broken Hill, and of nearly every profession, trade, and calling.
Like every other battalion of the A.1.F., the Tenth saw its fair share of fight-
ing. From the landing at Anzac, when it played an honored part as one of
the covering battalions, until the Armistice, the “Purple and Blue Rectangle"
was prominent in nearly every major “stunt” in which the Australian Infantry
was engaged. This is a record. A thousand officers and men made the
supreme sacrifice, while two thousand five hundred officers and men were
wounded. Tjwto hundred and sixty decorations were gained by members of
the Battalion. The predominant emotion of this, our Annual Reunion, is
Pride—Pride in the old Battalion and in its glorious traditions; but it is
pride tinged with sorrow, for when we grip the hand of a cobber and raise our
glasses to drink to “The Day We Celebrate,” memories of the mate who lies
on rugged Gallipoli or in far-off France come back.

Many were the adventures of the men of the Tenth during their sojourn
in Egypt. Camped in the shadow of the Pyramids, they explored the mysteries
of the land of the Pharaohs when leave permitted; but it was mostly training

—eight hours a day, with packs up, under a hot sun, and on the loose desert
sand. They grew very sick of the sand; but some were loath to leave the
“Gypo” and his donkey and the winding streets of Cairo.
GALLIPOLI.
February 28, 1915, saw the striking of the camp at Mena, and the next
day the 10th Battalion embarked on the “lonian,” still bound for “a destina-
tion unknown.” Two months were spent in Mudros Harbor practising landing
operations, and on the afternoon of April 24 the Battalion, under the command
of Colonel Weir, was allotted to its various duties. Battalion Headquarters and
“B” and “C” Companies, under Major Oldham and Captain Jacob, transferred
from the “lonian” to H.M.S. “Prince of Wales,” and later “A” and D” Com-
panies, under Major Beevor and Captain Herbert, moved over to the destroyers
"Foxhound” and “Scourge.”
Headquarters and “B” and “C” Companies, together with the Headquarters
and two Companies of the Ninth Battalion, were the first to move towards the
shore, and were towed in ships’ boats by naval pinnaces in “line abreast.”
Absolute silence prevailed; but as the boats neared the shore the alarm was
given, and they came under heavy rifle, machine-gun, and shrapnel fire. The
men leapt into the sea and waded ashore. Many were killed in the boats,
others in the water; but the rest pushed forward with fixed bayonets, and
here, on the rugged heights of Gallipoli, Australia first became a nation. For
four’ days the Battalion withstood repeated and determined counter-attacks,
being relieved on April 28 by th R.M.L. Infantry. The Battalion then pro-
ceeded to “Shell Green” for a well-earned and much-needed rest. After a short
spell the Battalion were again in action, and on May 19 an attack by the
Turks in great numbers was launched, but the enemy wer e mown down before
the first line was reached. On May 24 an armistice was granted from 7.30
a.m. until 4.30 p.m., when it was estimated that over 3,000 bodies of Turkish
soldiers were buried on the heights of Gallipoli. A period of trench warfare
followed, with its monotonous digging and fatigues, and although the casualty
lists were small, disease made its appearance, and decimated <he ranks of the
Battalion.
Soon after the battles of early August, Colonel Weir, who had commanded
the Battalion since its formation, was invalided to England, and Major Shaw
assumed command. There was not much fighting during the last months of
the campaign, but the men of Anzac were on the defensive, and under a con-
tinual strain, as they waited night and day for the expected onslaught of the
Turkish Army. On November 21 the Battalion was relieved, and sent to
Lemnos to reorganise. Gallipoli was evacuated in December, and the end of
the year found the Australians back in Egypt, and encamped at Tel-el-Kebir.
FRANCE, 1916-18.
Who will forget the first happy days of the Battalion’s training in France?
After the heavy marching on the sandy plains of Egypt, to be transported to
the then sunny France was paradise. It was at Strazeele that the Battalion
was first billeted, and we have still pleasant memories of trips to madame’s
for those plates of fried eggs and chips, and the cheerful “Bonjour” of Marie
as she wended her way to the adjacent fields to carry on the work left for her
by those who were dear, now fighting for their country.
On June 6, 1916, the Battalion took over the line for the first time in
France. At times the artillery fire was heavy on both sides, but this sector
was exceedingly quiet, and the casualties of the Battalion were only slight.
This could not last, however. The Australians had won a world-wide fame as
fighting men, and they were now to be placed on the offensive against their
most formidable enemy—the Hun. Armed with every modern weapon, these
destroyers of homes and slayers of children, trained from their youth as

soldiers, were to have the opportunity of showing their skill against the men
of Australia. On Saturday night, July 22, the Battalion left Sausage Gul y,
and proceeded to support the 9th Battalion at Pozieres. Here they met with
strong opposition. “A” Company, under Captain McCann, was sent to the
assistance of the 9th Battalion, but was held up by heavy machine-gun hre,
and Captain McCann was wounded. “D” Company, under Major Giles, was
then despatched to the assistance of “A” Company, while during the night
“C” and “B” Companies, under Major Shaw and Captain Hooper, dug a new
defensive line, securing the flank of our position. Detailed with a party to
clear a trench, Lieut. Blackburn broke down a barricade, and single-handed,
bombed back the enemy. It was in this encounter that Lieut. Blackburn won
his V.C., and Sergeant Inwood, who had done magnificent work, was killed.
For two days the enemy shelling was severe, and our casualties, which were
very heavy, included Captain Hooper, O.C. “B” Company, among the killed.
Moquet Farm, the next attack launched by the 10th Battalion, was even
more costly. The artillery fire from the enemy was intense. The shattered
bodies of the dead lav along the trench, and the wounded, unable to move,
died where they fell. So mixed was the affair that our own men found them-
selves fighting one another, and this was not realised until many casualties
had been inflicted.
On August 23 the Battalion was relieved, and entrained at Doullens for
Belgium. Shortly afterwards, after a brief spell, the Battalion could be found
working hard at night carrying aminol to the Canadian Company, who wer
then tunnelling towards the German trenches. After the Battalion had take
over the front line on this sector the enemy made an attempt to destroy om
lines by blowing a mine. This proved unsuccessful, however, for mth a tempt
to destroy our line he destroyed portion of his own. This w«« due to.the
blowing back of the mine. Those who were under Sergeant P. Doddridge i
this event will long remember the shower of sandbags which they received
from the German trench. The casualties in this sector were slight, and
amounted to only one officer and 29 other ranks.
The Battalion next received orders to proceed to the at £ er £

battalion that, late in the evening, crawled into those vermin-infested dugouts
in Bernefray Wood. Mud was everywhere! On fatigues and carrying parties
the men became covered in mud, and slept and woke in mud. But even
through all this they carried that cheerful smile, and oft in the evening, after
their day of strenuous toil, could be heard the sound of voices singing some
of their old Australian ditties. Of these men we can sincerely quote: “In
the mud and slush of things someone always, always sings.”
The Battalion took over the line near Guidecourt on November 10, 1916.
The trenches, so-called, were just a mass of mud-filled shell-holes connected
by a mud trench. It was here that the Battalion underwent its hardest phy-
sical endurance. Numbers of men were carried out with trench feet, and those
who managed to survive had some of the most trying experiences that it was
possible for man to undergo. After about a week the Battalion was relieved,
and proceeded to Cardonette for reorganisation. After a short spell of training
and recreation, the Battalion again moved forward to the same area, and
Christmas of 1916 found them working on fatigues in the forward area of the
Somme.

Early in the following year it became known that the enemy was about
to evacuate his position, and retire to the Hindenburg Line. On February 25
the Battalion attacked the enemy positions at Leßarque which were cap
tured after very little resistance. During the month of March the Batta.

The Battalion was relieved by the 7th Battalion on the evening of April
16-17. The enemy had now retired to the Hmdenburg Line, where he w

make another stand. On May 4 the Battalion moved forward to the support
of Bullecourt. Owing to the intense bombardment, many casualties were in-
flicted. The 12th, who were in the front line, were being hard pressed when
“C” Company was sent to their assistance. After a violent bombardment, the
enemy attacked this position in large numbers, using liquid fire shells and
“flamewerfers,” driving the front line troops to the support lines. After being
reinforced by the remainder of the Battalion and portion of the 11th Battalion,
the front line system was again recaptured. On the night of May 8-9 the
Battalion was relieved by the 53rd Battalion, after having added to its history
one of the most formidable battles in the Great War.
During the months of May, June, and July the Battalion found rest and
recreation in the village of Ribemont, where the Brigade sports were held,
the battalion attaining the position of Champions of the Brigade. Colonel
Jacobs having been transferred to England, Colonel Nelligan assumed com-
mand of the Battalion. On July 26 the Battalion entrained at Albert, and

proceeded north, detraining at Steenbecque, and marching to Staple. It was
here that two raiding parties were formed—“X” Company, under the com-
mand of Captain Hurcombe, and “Y” Company, under the command of Cap-
tain Campbell. The Companies, under excellent conditions and commanders,
attained to a perfect fitness as a war machine, ready for operations in che
Urni Earl\ P in it became known that the Battalion was again to
move forward, this time to the Ypres Sector, and on the ISth it started on
is iournev towards this objective. On the night of September 19-20 the Bat-
talion left Chateau Segard, and proceeded to take up its position as a unit
in the Third Battle of Ypres—one of the most terrific battles ever known.
Following a heavy barrage, the 3rd Brigade attacked the enemy positions,
the firsthand second objectives being allotted to the Hth and 12th Battalions,
and the third objective to the 10th Battalion, “X” and Y Companies attack-
ing the remainder of the Battalion acting as carrying parties, etc. After the
capture of the second objective a heavy barrage was thrown on the third
objective, which was then captured by the attacking forces of the 10th
Battalion. It was here that Private R. Inwood gained his \ .C. Alone,
left the front line trench, and proceeded to an enemy outpost, killing the gun
crew, and capturing a prisoner, then returning with the gun.


After a short spell in the Steenvoodt Area, the Battalion took over the
line in the Zonnebecke Area. On October 10 a raiding party attacked the
•enemy position in Celtic Wood. At 5.30 a.m., after practically no bombard-
ment, the party moved forward to the centre of Celtic Wood, with the object
of drawing enemy fire from the 2nd Division, which was attacking a position
•on the left. This proved successful, the raiding party receiving a terrific fire
from the enemy position. At a given signal the party was to have returned
to its own trenches: but owing to the death of the O.C. (Lieut. Scott) and
Sergeant Cole, who was to fire the flare, the raiders were left without signals.
■Only a few managed to return, and these were relieved the same evening by
a C'ompany of the 32nd Battalion.
On December 16 the Battalion moved into the line in the Messines Sector.
Always expecting this great attack of the Germans to be launched, the Bat-
talion was constantly on fatigues, carrying ammunition and supplies to the
front line. But the enemy made no attempt during the Battalion’s period in
the forward area. On Christmas morning, December 25, the Battalion was
relieved by the 12th.
A month in the trenches and in support was followed by a month in
reserve at Aldershot Camp, Neuve Eglise, and then, on March 2, 1918, the
Battalion, under Major Shaw, took over the line in the Hollebecke Sector.
During the relief of the 13th Battalion the enemy raided the position occupied
by “D” Company. The attack was driven off, but not before it had reached
Company Headquarters, where Major Henwood, the 0.C., refusing to surrender,
was killed.
The enemy began his offensive on the Somme, and in April the First
Division was hurried to the assistance of the other Australian Divisions.
Within a week of the time it had left the north, however, the First Divi-
sion was back north again, for the Hun had broken through on the Ypres
Sector, and was making a bid for the Channel ports.
Detraining at Hondeghem late at night, the 10th marched to protect
Hazebrouck. On the night of April 24-25 the Battalion, in conjunction with
the 9th, attempted to capture the village of Meteren, but, unsupported by
artillery fire, this attack failed, and our casualties were heavy. During the
next three months the Battalions occupied the lines in the vicinity of Strazeeie,
and by constantly attacking the enemy positions, considerably changed his
plans. During an attack near Merris, Cpl. Philip Davey won our third V.C.
During a minor operation, Cpl. Davey moved forward alone in the face of
heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, silenced the gun, and placed the gun crew
out of action. During the encounter he was severely wounded. During a tour
in the front line, “A” Company was unsuccessfully raided on two occasions,
once on the night of June 30-31, and the other on the night of July 4, by
the Hun. Both raids were successfully overcome, with much loss to the
enemy, both in guns and men. One of the most successful of all the attacks
launched by the Battalion was the capture of Merirs. “A” and “B” Com-
panies surrounded the village, and “C” Company and Headquarters, after little
resistance, “mopped up’’ the village. One hundred and eight-seven prisoners
were captured in this attack, with only thirty casualties to the Battalion.
On July 6 the Battalion entrained at Wizemes for the south, to join the
Australian Corps, from which the Ist Division had been absent for some
months. Detraining at Pont Remy at about 5.30 a.m. on the 7th, and pro-
ceeding by route march and bus, the Battalion worked its way forward,
arriving at the Village of Fires (Poulainville) early in the morning of the Bth.
Rumor began to get abroad about great attacks, and before the village
was left that day large batches of enemv prisoners passed through. It was
the famous Bth of August battle. The British Armies, including the Austra-
lian Corps, had attacked that morning early on a wide front, and by evening
had advanced many miles.
The Battalion spent the two days (Bth and 9th) trying to keep up with
the advancing troops, passing Conbie, Wanfusie, Abancourt, Bayonvillers,
Guillacicourt. On the evening of the 9th the Battalion, having settled down
several times previously, only to receive orders to move on and occupy a fresh
position, spent the night in hastily dug shelters just south of Harbonierres.


At 6.30 a.m. on the 10th the advance started again in artillery formation, the
Battalion supporting the 9th Battalion.
Opposition was met near “Crepy Wood,” and the 9th Battalion, having
swung out of true direction, “A” Company, under Captain McCann, was sent
to clear it up. Under a heavy fire, and losing many men, the wood was
cleared, and four posts were established on the northern outskirts of the
Wood. ’ The 9th Battalion took up its position on the eastern side of Wood.
At four o’clock in the afternoon a heavy bombardment, during which two
out oi “A” Company’s four posts were completely blown out, and the 9th
Battalion were blown out of their posts, the enemy delivered a strong counter-
attack against the remnants of “A” Company; but the Wood was not to be
theirs With one officer and seven other ranks, Captain McCann, putting up
a magnificent fight, held back the enemy, and when, at the end of an hour,
they retired they left 90 of their dead behind. The whole of the Wood was
re-captured by “A” Company, and for this Captain McCann, recommended for
the highest decoration, received his D.S.O. The next morning two companies
of the 10th, in conjunction with the 12th, captured and held the village of
Lihons.
On August 26 the Battalion moved through the village of Gappy, and
meeting with little resistance, advanced the line over 6,000 yards, and captured
many prisoners.
Less than a month later the Battalion, on September 18, left Jeancourt,
and passing through the 12th Battalion, established themselves after an
advance of 5 000 yards, on a 1,000-yard front. This was the last fight that the
Battalion was to undertake. The Germans were now seeking peace, well
knowing that ere many days the Allies, with their victorious armies, would
march through the German cities, perhaps to devastate her towns as the bar-
barous Hun had destroyed the once beautiful cities of France and Belgium.
On November 11 the Armistice was signed; the final scene in the great
drama was ended—Germany was beaten! The battle of might versus rig
had been fought and won by the Allies for the freedom of the world, Australia
had proved to the world that, as one of the youngest of Britain s Dominions,
she was prepared to assist the Motherland in her time of need.

H.M.S. PRINCE OF WALES.
OUR TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OCTOBER, 1934.
In ten days’ time falls the twentieth anniversary of the embarkation for
service overseas of the Battalion, and in an endeavor suitably to commemo-
rate the event, your Committee have secured the messages of greeting printed
below from many of your former commanding officers, notably General Sir
lan Hamilton, Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood, Lieut.-Gen. Sir H. B.
Walker, Major-Gen. E. G. Sinclair MacLagan, and Brig.-Gen. S. Price Weir.
The objects of your Club are twofold—to foster the spirit of comradeship
which contributed so much towards the Battalion’s achievements overseas,
of which you are justly proud, and to ensure that the inevitable passing from
time to time of our comrades should be fittingly recognised. To carry out
these objects successfully it is essential that all who can should be members
of the Battalion Club. In their own interests, and in the interests of all, those
who are not already members are urged to join up at once.
On this special occasion your Committee and I wish to convey to you all
our best wishes for a prosperous and happy future.
G. C. CAMPBELL,
President, 10th Bn. A.I.F. Club.


From GENERAL SIR lAN HAMILTON, G.C.8., G.C.M.G., D. 5.0., Comman-
der-in-Chicf, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.
The famous 10th Battalion of the A.I.F. invites its old Commanoer-in-Chief
to send its members a handshake from the other side of the world. Needless
to say, he does so not only, as in conventional phrase, “with much pleasure,”
but with an intense thrill of pride at making contact again with troops who
hold so fine a record. For just as well as I can remember Adelaide in Decem-
ber, 1913, as being the most perfectly planned and symmetrical city that I,
after holding the travelling post of Inspector-General of Overseas Forces, had
seen the whole of the British Empire, so equally well do I remember that,
on the 25th April, 1915. the men of the 10th Battalion, from Adelaide, were
about the first, if not tho very first, of the whole of the Mediterranean Ex-
peditionary Force to spring out of their boats and half swim, half wade on to
the unknown and necessarily unreconnoitred wilderness afterwards to be
known as Anzac. Of their conduct during the three days and nights of des-
perate fighting in those desolate mountains which ensued I need not speak.
They have become part of the Anzac tradition. Long live the gallant 10th
Battalion of the A.1.F., and may I live to drink their health on October 10th
in a glass of South Australian Burgundy.
From FIELD MARSHAL SIR WILLIAM/ BIRDWOOD, Bt, G.C.8., G.C.S.L,
G.C.M.G., C.1.E., D. 5.0., Commander of the A.I.F.
1 am very glad to hear that our old 10th Battalion of the A.I.F. is to
issue a souvenir booklet to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its birth,
and I need hardly say how willing 1 am to send a message of greeting to-
all my old comrades of the 10th.
It hardly seems possible that close on twenty years have passed since I
had the very great honor of taking over the command of the Australian and
New Zealand Army Corps in Egypt in December, 1914 And how much has
haooened since then! Events which we could none of us have then antici-
pated Naturally, I will not attempt here to talk of the very many great
actions in which the 10th took part between the landing on Anzac night up
to the Armistice in November, 1918—those are all described fully in the regi-
menal hiSory But I think perhaps the fact that the 10th formed part of
our SvaSSeguard-the very s?ear point of the AI.F-at the original landing
at Anzac at dawn on April 25, 1915, will probably be the great outstanding
event in the history of the regiment. We all of us know well and can never
forget the magnificent bravery, dash, and endurance shown by the 10th on
that occasion, and I need only add that that great spirit of determination and
loyalty was maintained by the Battalion throughout the who.e war. Now that
we have reached times of peace I know that all my old comrades are proving
themselves every bit as good citizens of Australia and the British Empire a.
th^pr^edTo the world what good, brave, and staunch sold.ers they were
in times of war.
To one and all of those old comrades of mine I now wish to send my
miost heartv and sincere greetings, with the hope and wish that prosperity,
happiness Ld good health may be before all for many long years to come.

From LIEUT-GENERAL SIR H. B. WALKER, K.C.8., K.C.M.G., D.S.O. r
Commander of the First Division.
It affords me the deepest gratification to have been given an opportunity
to send my greetings to you on this anniversary of your annual reunion, and
to realise that after all these years I have not been entirely forgotten as having
been so closely associated with you on Gallipoli and in France and not only
with your Battalion, but also the 3rd Brigade, in which you served.
As one of the covering battalions under Colonel Price Weir at the landing
at Anzac, you shared the brunt, with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, in that epic
attack of’ the Australian Forces.
The deeds of your battalion in the earlier days in France are imprinted
in mv memory by your gallantry in the Pozieres first attack, in co-operation
with 'the 9th Battalion, when Blackburn got the V.C., McCann was wounded,
and Hooper, a friend of mine, was killed. In the deadly and ill-conceived
second Pozieres attack on Mouquet Farm your battalion, after only some ten
days’ rest, again took part, with heavy losses.
1 find many references in my diaries to your work in the trenches in the
Flers-Guedecourt area, and names remind me of the many sturdy officers and
men whose faces I can still remember—Jacob, Shaw, Giles, Rumball, Campbell,
and Appleyard—and I remember General Gordon Bennett taking command
of your Brigade.
In the commencement of open warfare in the advance on Bapaume my
diaries remind me of the important part your battalion played. I read in Y
diary: “The Third Brigade has done awfully well. And again, in the attack
on Hermies, Bourscies, and Demicourt, two of your companies under e
Courcev Ireland, and McCann, by their gallantry, largely contributed to the
capture ’of Hermies by a battalion of the Ist Brigade, under Milligan—Hermies
being the key of the whole position.
In the heavy German attack on our Divisional front of 14,000 yards, Lagni
courb-Hermies, your battalion again largely contributed to saving a serious
situation created by such an extended and exposed front.
In the second Battle of Buliecourt your Brigade was thrown in to rein-
force the 2nd Division at a time when you should have been going into rest
bidets and it was your battalion’s gallantry that helped to restore a very
critical situation in a battle for our objective which exhausted some twenty
battalions of the Australian forces.
In the third Battle of Ypres your battalion, now commanded by the
eallant Wilder-Nelligan, played a conspicuous part, and gained another V.C.—
that of Pte. R. Inwood—in capturing the third objective allotted to your
Brigade.
Early in 1918, when your battalion was holding the J renche s £ the Holle-
becke area, and had taken o&er an advanced post in a pillbox, I lost * *n e nd,
Henwood, who was killed in a German attack. Later, in front of Hazebrou r

you were continuously in the line, suffering heavily in the hastily planned and
ill-supported attack on Meteren, and again in the capture of Mont-de-Merris,
and lastly, just after my leaving the Ist Division, the brilliant capture of
Merris itself by a plan so skilfully conceived, the result of which I was not
to witness.
My last records of my association with your battalion, and the recollec-
tions I took with me as I left your lines for the last time, are those of Wilder-
Nelligan’s Headquarters in a fortified farm, with its significant notice board:
“We live here, you don’t.”
During this later period your battalion gained another V.C.—that of
Corporal P. Davey—though I was not to know of its having been granted
until after my departure. In Italy I received accounts of the doings of the
Ist Division when in the Fourth Army, and again the records of your battalion
and its successes filled me with pleasure, and regrets that I was no longer
with you.
But I hope you will realise when, and if, my greetings here recorded reach
you, how much I appreciated the lengthy period I served with you. The best
of luck to the 10th Battalion and its survivors.
From MAJOR-GENERAL E. G. SINCLAIR-McLAGAN, C. 8., C.M.G., D. 5.0.,
Commander 3rd Brigade, August, 1914-December, 1916.
To my old “boys” of the 10th Battalion A.I.F. Club, and to all old members
of the 10th and 50th Battalions, A.1.F., my very warm and heartfelt greetinqgs
and remembrance.
The 3rd Infantry Brigade, A.1.F., which I had the proud privilege of com-
manding for over two years of the Great War, was a magnificent command,
and earned imperishable renown for Australia and the A.I.F.
The 10th Battalion held its own with the other battalions of the Brigade,


both in training and in the stresses of war; their deeds of “derring-do” are
chronicled in Dr. Bean’s admirable “Official History of Australia in the Great
War.”
The discipline of all units of the Brigade was highly tried on many occa-
sions, but was always—in action—of the best. I will admit that more than
once when “out of the line” you boys caused your poor Brigadier much tribu-
lation of mind, and caused him to think “more than a bit,” and I am afraid
I had to “put it across’’ a few individuals! But that, after all, was
my job, and I hope that no one can remember against me any act of “in-
justice.”
1 was intensely proud of you and of my Brigade, and when you were
selected by General Bridges to be the covering force for the Gallipoli landing,
I was most grateful to you for earning that honor—a very high one—though
I doubted my own capacity to lead you as you should be led.
You did all that was possible there and in the Gallipoli campaign, and in
the following campaign, consummated the apparently impossible on more than
one occasion,
I more especially remember your wonderful work in the Merris Sector
in early 1918, under the command of that splendid officer, Lieut.-Col. Wilder-
Nelligan. You won great praise for your many feats of arms.
It is good to know that you keep up that fine wartime camaraderie by
means of the R.S.S. Imperial League of Australia, and your reunions, and 1
am sure many of you find it a great help in the strenuous and difficult times
you have had of late years. I hope these hard times are now past, and that
the future may bring you prosperity and happiness.

I include the 50th Battalion, whom I also had under my command in
the 13th Infantry Brigade, A.1.F., as a unit of the 4th Australian Division,
and who worthily upheld the traditions of their “mother”—the 10th Battalion
—and many of whom served in that battalion.
I will (D.V.) remember the date of your Reunion (October 10, 1934), and
will be with you “in spirit”— both ways—and drink your health with wishes
for your good health, good fortune, and much happiness.
From BRIGADIER GENERAL S. PRICE-WEIR, D. 5.0., V.D., Original
Colonel o£ the Battalion.
I
It affords me great pleasure, as the first C.O. of the 10th Battalion, A.1.F.,
to convey to the men of the 10th Battalion a hearty cheerio.
I can scarcely realise that it is now twenty years ago since the first en-
rolment took place at Morphettville on August 19, 1914. What a splendid lot
■of fellows they were—the pick of the manhood of South Australia.
I feel that I was particularly fortunate in having under my command
such a fine contingent of men, who proved their soldierly qualities when, just
before daylight on Sunday morning, April 25, 1915, they received their baptism
of fire in the Agean Sea off Gallipoli.
Their conduct on that eventful day gained for them the right to be classed
as amongst “the bravest things God ever m!ade.”
The Battalion never “looked back,” but maintained its reputation as “The
Fighting Tenth” right up to the Armistice and the Declaration of Peace.

From COLONEL SIR HENRY GALWAY, K.C.M.G., D. 5.0., Governor of
South Australia during the War.
I greatly appreciate the kind thought which prompted Captain Gordon
Campbell and his committee to remember me after all these years. In fact, I
take it as a compliment. Needless to say, I heartily reciprocate the battalion’s
greetings. I note with keen interest that the gallant 10th intend commemo-
rating the 20th anniversary of their embarkation for the seat of war. I can
well imagine the memories that will fill your hearts on that day. Well, there
is one feeling you all will have enshrined in your hearts for all time, and that
is pride in the splendid battle record of the battalion, and lasting gratitude to
your brave comrades who laid down their lives for the cause.
I am not likely ever to forget the day when I bade good-bye and God-
speed to the battalion at the Outer Harbor on October 20, 1914. Twenty years
ago, and yet it seems like yesterday. I remember so well, as I stood on the
deck of the s.s. “Ascanius,” trying to convey to the battalion, in halting
phrases, how truly my heart went with them on their great adventure. They
were as fine a body of soldiers as ever I saw. I knew they would do well,
and so they did—magnificently, and without any fuss. The buildling of Em-
pire is a costly business where good lives are concerned. The losses of the 10th


Battalion in the several seats of war is a sad reminder of that melancholy
fact. Every year since I left South Australia, twenty years ago now, I have
cabled my greetings on Anzac Day to “the gallant survivors of the landing.”
In sending that message I have always had chiefly at heart the memory of
the 10th Battalion and the 9th Light Horse, the latter commanded by the
gallant Colonel Miell, who fell at Gallipoli. 'Not forgetting, too, the gallant
27th Battalion, of which I am Honorary Colonel. My particular interest in
the 10th Battalion and the 9th Light Horse was due to them being the first
two regiments composed entirely of South Australians to embark on active
service. Lady Galway’s and my memories often go back to those busy and
eventful days, proud in the knowledge of the splendid services rendered by
the men we had the privilege of meeting, but sad in the thought of the many
gallant men who had paid the cost.
Both I and Lady Galway very much appreciate you kind mention of the
services she rendered whilst in South Australia. Anything either of us was
able to do was a pleasure. We are able to look back on our sojourn in your
beautiful State with nothing but the happiest memories.
On the occasion of your 20th anniversary will you ask Captain Gordon
Campbell to convey to Colonel Price-Weir and to the officers and men of the
battalion the warmest of greetings from an "Old Contemptible,” with the
assurances of my continued interest in the welfare of all those gallant sur-
vivors, and my lasting pride at having been in some way connected with them
during those memorable days in 1914—18. May the memory of the honor and
glory won by the battalion never fade; and when those who gained that
great record have passed away, may the memory of it remain green in the
hearts of even generations yet unborn. Lady Galway associates herself with
my greetings.
Wishing the greatest of success to your gathering on “the day,” and with
my kind regards, and Lady Galway’s, to you all.

HYMN 2.
(Tune —“Sing Me to Sleep.’’)
Lord, I am lousy.
Chats in galore ;
All the time scratching
Till we are sore;
When it comes night time
They start to roam,
It starts us thinking
There’s no place like home.
HYMN 3.
(Tune —“Tennessee.”)
In Nineteen Thirty-four.
Just try to picture me—
In Aussie o’er the sea,
That’s where I’d like to be;
All I can think of to-night
Are the fields of snowy white,
Freezing, snowing,
Machine-guns going,
Berlin out of sight; •
The Fritzies in the trench.
Behind them leave a stench ;
I’d like to see my wench—
Not the on who parleys French ;
She’ll be right there to greet me.
When I get back, when I get back.
In the year 1-9-3-4.
HYMN 4.
(Tune —“Blighty.”)
Take me back to dear old Aussie,
Put me on a boat for Woolloomooloo;
Take me over there, drop me anywhere,
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, for I don’t care;
I just want to see my best girl,
Cuddling up again we soon will be;
Oh, Blighty is a failure, take me to Australia,
Aussie is the place for me.

HYMN 5.
I want to go home, I want to go home,
I don’t want to go to the trenches no more,
Where the Minnies and Whizz-bangs they whistle and loar,
Take me over the sea,
Where the Germans can’t snipe at me,
Oh, my, I’m too young to die,
I want to go home.
HYMN 6.
(Tune— “Another Little Drink Wouldn’t Do Us Any Harm.”)
Oh. there v/as a little hen, and she had a wooden leg.
The best little hen that ever laid an egg.
And she laid more eggs than any hen on the tarni.
And another little drink wouldn t do us any harm.
CHORUS:
Another little drink, another little drink.
Another little drink wouldn’t do us any harm.
Another little drink, another little drink.
Another little drink wouldn’t do us any harm.
W'e had a little duck and a lot of green peas,
A quart of ginger beer and some Stilton cheese:
Then we felt such a pain in the shade of the palm.
And another little drink wouldn’t do us any harm,
CHORUS:
Another little drink, .another little drink.
Another little drink wouldn’t do us any harm.
Another little drink, another little drink.
Another little drink wouldn’t do us any harm.

If the sergeant drinks your rum, never

If the sergeant drinks your rum, never
He’ titled to a tot. but he drinks the

If the sergeant drinks your rum, never

HYMN 8.
The Brigadier, he gets turkey.
The Colonel has his duck,
The Officers have poultry—
They always were in luck ;
The Sergeants they get bread and cheese.
And mop up all they can,
But all the poor old Privates get
Is bread and Tinkler’s jam.
HYMN 9.
(Tune—“ Hold Your Hand Out, Naughty Boy.”)
Keep your head down, Allemand;
Keep your head down, Allemand;
Late last night, in the pale moonlight,
I saw you, I saw you ;
You were mending your broken wire.
When our machine-guns opened fire ;
If you want to see your home down in Germany,
Keep your head down, Allemand;

THE POZIERES CROSS.
THE BATTLE OF POZIERES.
The Battle of Pozieres, on July 23,
1916, was the first offensive operation in
which the 10th Battalion took part in
France, and it was during it that Cap-
tain A. S. Blackburn won our unit’s and
South Australia’s first Victoria Cross in
the war. Many of the men of the bat-
talion who were killed in the heavy
fighting in the trenches known as the
O.G. lines were buried in a common
grave, which was marked at the time
by a rough wooden cross made from an
ammunition box. About a year later,
in June, 1917, when the battalion was
resting out of the line at Ribemont,
steps were taken to mark with a per-
manent cross all the known graves of
members of the unit on the Somme
battlefield, and the cross in question
was erected over the large grave at
Pozieres.
This cross was sent to Melbourne by
the Australian War Memorial authori-
ties, and offered by them to the 10th
Battalion, A.M.F. The officers of that
unit, however, offered it to the club of
the 10th Battalion, A.1.F., who accept-
ed it, and will hold it in trust as a
racred relic of their comrades who lost
their lives in the war.
“THERE IS NO DEATH.”
I tell you they have not died,
They live and breathe with you,
They walk now here at your side,
They tell you things are true.
Why dream of poppied sod
When you can feel their breath,
When flow’r and soul and God
Know there is no death!
I tell you they have not died,
Their hands clasp yours and mine,
They are now but glorified,
They have become divine.
They live! they know! they see!
They shout with ev’ry breath;
“All is Eternal Life!
There is no death ! ’’
Gordon Johnstone.

Young Bill is obviously the world s worst caddy . . •
and proud of it. too . . . here he has handed Col Cayenne-
pepper the Niblick, and then cooly sat himself down in a
bunker to read. . . .
Young Bill is no fool in many ways. We might tell
you confidently, while the Colonel is digging himself
Bill KNOWS the Colonel’s excavating tendencies,
knows all about JOHN MARTIN’S SPORTS DEPART'
ment . That’s what is on Bill’s tender mind. Bill is
thinking (seriously, too) of taking up Tennis this very
summer, and he never lets an opportunity go by without
studying the “BIG STORE’S” amazing sports goods
values.
FOLLOW BILL’S advice —straight from the bunker! j
