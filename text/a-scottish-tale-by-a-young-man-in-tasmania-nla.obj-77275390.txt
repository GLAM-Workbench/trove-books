PREFACE.
The following Poem is the production of a young man in
his twenty-first year.
In publishing it, he feels a certain amount of anxiety,
for fear he may be thought too presumptuous, in bringing
before the public at that early age, anything of a literary
character. To any who may so think, he can only say
(and that with all humility,) that upon the following lines
he has bestowed much study, and that throughout them he
has ever striven to attain as high a point of excellence in
composition as his feeble powers would allow him. He
therefore trusts that whatever their faults, they will not be
too severely censured.
With this (amidst many doubts and fears), he leaves
them to their fate, only hoping that at some future time he
may be able to bring forth something more worthy of the
light.
THE AUTHOR.
P.S. ?The fore part of the Poem was composed a consi-
derable time before the remainder was began, therefore,
when the Author was much younger.

INTRODUCTION.
Once on a time, when naught was heard,
Except the singing of the bird,
When naught beside the nightingale,
Was heard to warble in the vale.
When not a bard as yet had sung,
And ere sweet poetry had rung,
Ere yet its charms had spread around,
Ere yet its numbers had been found,
Ere yet its force and power were known,
Ere yet it had to childhood grown,
When it still lived up in the sky,*
There with its azure wings to fly,
To fly about ?mongst moons and stars,
And planets (Jupiter and Mars),
When it did with the angels stay,
roaming far away ;
Till luckily it by chance one day,
While rambling straggled far astray
It came too near unto the ground,
And while ?twas resting there was found,
When it would fain have flown away,
But it could not, ?twas forced to stay.
And hef who found it held it tight,
Which he had needs with all his might?
For it did struggle, pull, and haul.
And gave him many a cruel fall,
Which he withstood, and bravely took.
While many would have it forsook;
And now when it was tired outright
He tied a string unto it tight,
And now a stake he quickly drove
Poetry is supposed to be of heavenly origin,
The earliest of the Scottish bards.


Into the ground, that could not move,
And then the string he tied unto it,
So that no mortal could undo it,
But left he rope enough for it
To fly a space when it thought fit;
And there it stays unto this day,
Flying oft a little way,
Sometimes up high as a cloud,
Sometimes higher, ?tis allowed;
Sometimes only to a hill,
Where it doth roam about at will;
Sometimes it flies not at all,
But grieving mourns o?er its great fall.
On such a time occurred the tale,
That now I fain would sing aloud ;
As high as my voice weak and frail,
Is at this first attempt allowed ;
For at the time wherein it past,
There was no one to sing it o er,
So it was to oblivion cast,
To he remembered of no more ;
And when bards did begin to sing,
None knew of it, so that to me
It hath been left this while to bring
It back to the world?s memory.


A SCOTTISH TALE.
On Scotia?s fair and lovely land?
Where beauty blooms on every hand,
Where breezes soft and heavenly blow,
Where all is smiles where?er you go?
Thereylived two Earls of power and fame,
Two Earls that were of ancient name,
Who both had fought on many a field
With armour, trusty sword, and shield,
And each other from many a blow,
That might have caused their overthrow ;
Who both had led their followers
To where none but the bandit stirs.
And there have made the robbers fly,
Or hewed them down dead or to die ;
When none before could thus prevail,
When all had fought without avail,
When all had tried, and all had failed,
When every knight had them assailed,
Then have they gone, and in an hour
ijave cut them off like as a flower.
The first was called the Earl of Arran,
The other Huntly, titles old
That even in history are not barren
Of noble deeds done brave and bold ;
Who loved each other dearly too,
Fondly, fervently, like few,
Firmly, faithfully, and in truth,
For thus they had loved in their youth;
And when the pure heart doth love young,
?Tis seldom it is from it wrung,
But as it doth the older grow,
So doth its stream the warmer flow.


They both had married in their day,
But death had borne their dames away,
For whom they long did mourn and sigh,
For 0, they loved them tenderly ;
Ah yes, and for full many a year,
Did they their memories revere,
For many a long and weary day,
Did they grieve o?er them now away ;
For many a dull and heavy night,
When sleep had still forsook them quite,
Did they in tears and silence mourn
That death had thus their ladies torn.
The first lord had a daughter fair,
Who was her father?s only care,
Wh,om he did kindly gently love,
As if she were some tender dove,
But whom he loved more than before,
Since his fair lady was no more ;
For she wore her fair mother?s face,
(Though younger, and more full of grace),
And there her features could be seen,
As plainly as her?s once had been ;
And when he looked on her he thought
He saw her that had passed to naught;
He thought he saw her winning smile,
That could his passions so beguile,
He thought he saw her pleasing eye,
That used to banish every sigh,
And thus he loved her that she wore
The features that her mother bore.
The other noble had a son,
Who was his first and only one,
And he, he dearly loved, for he
Was all he had on earth or sea ;
For all his race and kin were dead,
Through bloody contests, that had shed
Their pure red blood upon the plain,
While fighting for their honour?s gain.
His name was Oswold, and although
His father?s form did with him grow,


Yet be bad not tbe power of mind
And nobleness, that, both combined,
Made that great noble loved by those
Who were his friends, and feared by foes ;
Nor had he that brave martial gaze
That doth the common eye amaze,
Nor that high wide, and massive brow,
That tells where wisdom most doth grow;
Yet he was fair, and not devoid
Of wisdom, though it was alloyed;
Like metal base, ill-mixed with gold,
The worser kind we do behold,
We see where?er the pure should be,
And how the twain doth disagree ;
And think how nobler t?would appear,
Were it unmingled, pure and clear.
Now on one bright, and sunny day,
As both the earls went forth to stray,
While talking o?er the bloody wars,
That they had fought and won with scars,
While telling of the bare escapes,
And dreadful dangers and mishaps,
That they had met with in their day,
When they were warriors young and gay,
They brought about their offsprings weal,
Which in their discourse round did steal;
When suddenly, as if a thought
Had tried to pass, but had been caught,
The Earl of Huntly said unto
His comrade Arran,brave, and true ?
My lord, if it with thee agree,
As happily as it doth with me,
Your daughter and my son will be
But only one, as we twain art,
And ever have been at our heart,
And thus our houses both may be
United in sweet unity.
Good friend, cried Arran, loved and dear,
Thou hast indeed forestalled me here ;
Thou must have seen into my brain,
For there like thoughts have some time lain;


Yet happy am I now to find,
That we have both been of one mind
. That you have wished as I have done,
That our two houses should be one;
You cannot tell what joy ?twould give
To me, to see our houses live
United, and engrossed in one?
To see our blood together run.
O Huntly, dear will be the day,
When I behold what now you say,
When my sole daughter and your son,
Huntly and Arran are but one.
0 Arran, cries the other lord,
Your words doth joy to me afford,
Tor we are now both growing old,
And falling fast back to the mould,
And having each an only heir,
A youthful son and daughter fair,
How pleasing to us would it be
To see them married happily,
And who should they more proper wed
Than they themselves, as you have said,
For then our titles both would fall
On them who should be lord of all,
And in them would we twain behold
Rebuilders of our houses old,
Which would the surer firmer last,
feince they would be together cast.
Yes, answered Arran, and may they
And theirs raise at some future day,
Our name of Huntly and of Arran,
Till it hath soared o*er every Baron?
Till it shall have flown up so high,
That it shall reach unto the sky, .
And when descending down may it
Light on the throne and thereon sit.
Then back they to the castle hied,
Where many a vassel did reside,
And there they signed the contract both,
And swore to it with solemn oath,
With such an oath that neither one


Would have broke for all ?neath the sun;
Then filled they up their, glasses high,
With wine that sparkled to the eye,
And with a toast each of them drained
Their bowls until no drop remained,
In honour of the youthful pair,
Whose union they just now did swear.
But it so happened that the maid,
When not much older than a child,
Had known a youth of lower graae,
Than that which her high rank was styled,
Whom she had learnt to love the same
As if he had some lordly name,
Or as if he was of some line
Where wealth and honour did entwine,
In which heroic deeds were done,
And fame and glory had been won ;
And yet her love was not like this,
For love like this doth not endup,
But only lasts while all looks bliss,
And will not at the test prove pure ;
But her?s was bright as is the sun,
And deep as is the dark blue sea
When its depth can be found by none,
And lasting as eternity.
And he too loved her with a flame
As hot as that which filled her breast,
Although his age was but the same
As hers?but fourteen years at best.
And they used oft together go,
And ramble ?mongst the groves and trees,
Where each would strive (as best they know,)
The other one the most to please.
And thus it fell upon a day,
While roaming as they often had,
Young Harold mournfully did say
To Olimpia, with a voice full sad?
-0 fairest, dearest maid, though now
We are allowed to rove alone.
Yet soon thy sire will not allow
Us thus, but will keep thee at home ;


And I will never see thy face,
Or look on thee I love so well,
For thou wilt mix with thy own race,
While I will but with plebians dwell.
And soon fair maid, alas ! will you
Forget me who loves thee so true,
And learn to love another one,
hen I am from thee ever gone j
And I will live, alack the day,
To see some lord bear thee away,
And pine for ever to my death,
Lamenting at my gasping breath,
That I once gave thee my true heart.
For thee to play such cruel part.
0 Harold, cried the maiden, No !
1 swear my love shall never go,
Shall never leave thee, no, by heaven,
My love is yours and to thee given,
And though my kindred all say nay,
Yet I, weak woman, will say aye,
Who will love none but whom I choose.
Though all say aye or all refuse.
Ah, but said Harold, ere a year,
These resolutions will I fear,
Vanish away from out thy mind,
And no thought of them be behind ;
Like as a mother who hath lost
Her child, it for a while doth cost
Her many a tear, but in a time,
When she has lived more in her prime,
And hath borne many children more,
Her grief is much less than before,
And soon it grows less, and less still,
Till glad it died when Grod did will; ?
So you fair maiden for a while,
May grieve a little and not smile,
But when gay lovers round thee pour,
Thou wilt think of me little more,
And soon, when thou hast chose thee one,
I will be to oblivion gone.
But lady, lady, should you still
Love me as you say you will,


Then heaven I hardly care for thee,
Since thou wilt be a heaven to me;
But if you should forget me, then
I*ll be the wretched?st of men,
I will be plunged into hell,
And while on earth will but there dwell;
So lady do not sink me down,
But buoy me up, and my bliss crown.
0 Harold, do not doubt me so,
My love is yours, which thou dost know,
And that it ever shall be true,
1 swear by heaven and the earth too,
By all that is unto me dear,
By all my kindred that are near,
By everything that I do prize,
By all on earth and in the skies.
Thus said Olimpia, and soon she
Was hindered of his company,
And now no more could stray alone
To hear the nightingale?s sweet tone ;
Nft more could she now see her love.
Or speak to him or with him rove,
But was restrained, restricted to
The castle battlements and view.
* * * *
And thus she passed six years away,
And still her love did not decay,
But was as sound as at the hour
When she did her sincere love pour.
* * * * *
Now was the time arrived, when had
Been signed the bond that made so glad
Earl Arran and the other lord,
When they had sealed it with their word;
When soon Lord Arran sought the maid.
And told her of the bond he?d made,
How she and Oswold, Huntly?s son
Would in short time be joined in one.
0 helpless maiden, woman weak,
She could not answer now, or speak,
For her thoughts rushed and twirled so round
That they near threw her to the ground,


And some short time had travelled by
Ere she had strength thus to reply :
0 father why was this deed done ?
For I can never love the youth,
For I already do love one,
And only can that one in truth ;
And though he but a peasant is,
1 love him deeply and as well,
As if a kingly crown were is?
As if I were a peasant belle.
0 do not try to make me wed
One that I shall learn to abhor,
If I am forced to share his bed,
Or live with him for evermore ;
0 do not, do not make my life
Unhappy, wretched as ?twill be,
If I perforce must be his wife,
If I must wed to misery.
Thus said Olimpia to her sire,
When falling down upon her knees,
For she beheld his rising ire.
She sought his anger to appease.
But his broad brow became o?ercast,
And blackened as the angry sky
When ill winds blow, or surly blast
Sweep o?er it in its fury by.
And who is this that thou dost love,
Then asked he, 0, he is a youth
Whom thou knowest well, for he did rove
With me for many a year in sooth,
When 1 was young ; he too is fair,
But what his lineage are or were
1 do not know nor would he tell,
When we used to stray in the dell;
But that he is of high descent
Must be he is so nobly bent.
For even when he was so young,
He used to wish to be among
The hardy knights, to hear them tell
Of battles that he loved so well;
And when he would hear them relate
How some poor knights had met their fate,


How when, as one was going to
Save his companion, and run through
The deadly foe, another one
Behind would his sword through him run.
How then would his blood mount his head,
To hear how the poor knight had bled,
Wishing that he had but been by
To slay that foe or with him die.
0 foolish maid, cried Arran, he
Is but one of the peasantry,
Who hath fair face and flattering tongue,
That pleaseth all he moves among ;
He is one of the vulgar kind,
Debased in birth as well as mind;
0 think not on that peasant more.
But of him whom I said before.
0 my good lord, it cannot be,
1 love the youth too tenderly,
Beside when we were young I Swore,
That I would love him evermore,
And thou would?st not have me to break
My oath, and put my soul at stake.
And have I not sworn maiden too,
And must I break mine oath so true ?
Yours was sworn when thou wert too young
To know what did escape your tongue,
But mine was sworn when I well knew
It?s power, and it must be kept too;
Beside had it not been so sworn,
Thinkest thou maid I could allow
Thee to wed one so lowly born
As him to whom thou?st given thy vow ?
No no, by heaven, I?d sooner see
Thee buried down deep in the ground,
And myself drowned in the dark sea,
Where I would nevermore be found,
Than I would see thee thus disgrace
Thyself and me, and all thy race.
Ah but my lord, how can I stain
Our honor, if I true remain ?
It is but when I am untrue,
That I can stain its spotless hue,


And if I do not wed this youth,
Then will I stain it by untruth,
But if I wed him neither will,
Because my oath was sworn ere thine,
Which did make yours impossible,
And therefore ?twas directly nil.
0 perverse maid, thou?st heard me say,
And that thou must, thou shalt obey;
Three months are given thee to prepare,
When Huntly?s son thouTt wed, I swear ;
And what I swear on oath must be,
Unless Heaven other doth decree.
0 then, that Heaven may otherwise
Direct my destiny from the skies,
That there my fate may have been traced
In words that cannot be effaced.
That I shall wed my own true love
With the concurrence of above,
And that when it hath taken place,
My sire may welcome back my face,
And love me deeper and the more
For loving from my true heart?s core.
But her vexed sire had gone away,
And heard not what she now did say,
And she poor maid, was left alone,
With a perturbed mind to bemoan,
For 0, she loved her Harold dear,
And she was sore afraid for fear
She might not yet be able to
Wed him, as she had sworn to do.
And now how shall the poor maid turn,
Which road will she choose for the best,
For either will cause her to mourn,
And she cannot sit down to rest.
On must she go (nor can she stay),
On one or else the other way;
On one, she will her father please,
Because in it her gain he sees.
But on that rough road she will miss
The pleasure, peace and happiness,
That on the other she will find,
Which way doth most attract her mind ;


Therefore the maid at once decides
To take the path her nature guides,
Which is toward the sunny way,
For there all looks so bright and gay;
But how will see behold her love,
For she is not allowed to rove?
O she will hasten and watch through
The castle battlements, whereto
Harold may come, when he will hear
The news that soon must reach his ear.
So she doth hie, and ere long time
-Has passed, she spies him coming near,
But now he?s grown, and in his prime,
Yet seems to her more fair and dear.
Now doth she beckon with her hand,
To him to come unto the wall,
Now he hath reached it and doth stand,
And very soon lets these words fall:
O maid, I have sped quickly here,
To free thee from the bond you swore
When you and I were young and dear,
In days, in happy days of yore.
Fool that I was, that then did think,
That ever thought till now that you,
Would love me still and thyself link
With me to share my fortunes through;
Yet still I may be happy yet,
If I but see thee happy too.
But it will be mixed with regret,
When thinking of thee so untrue ;
But now farewell, Olimpia thou
Hast chosen a lover as I said,
May peace rest softly on thy brow,
For I forgive thee all fair maid.
He was about to haste away,
But Olimpia called him back again,
When she with tearful eyes did say,
To him in soft and tender strain :
O Harold, what thou hast been told,
Is only untrue, and not I,
For I love thee dear as of old,
And ever haye in memory ;


My father, and Lord Huntly swore,
In bond that I should wed his son,
But I did swear an oath before
To you, and I will keep that one,
And here I?ve came to watch for you,
To make arrangements for our flight,
For that we shall be forced to do,
And in the covering of the night.
O heavenly maiden can it be,
That thou dost love me still the same.
As thou once did?st, 0 it is me,
Who heard awrong, that is to blame;
Then when the moon is seven days past.
The full extension of her size,
On that night shall our flight be cast,
For then she will not till late rise;
Then will I come, and we shall hie,
Together to the rocky shore,
When we will in a swift boat fly,
Across the ocean?s angry roar;
But I must flee for fear some one,
May see me lingering here with thee,
But though Olimpia I am gone,
Yet thou art ever near to me.
The night has came, the time is by,
Although it did not quickly fly,
And it is dark, for yet the moon
Has not appeared, it is too soon,
Naught can be seen, naught can be heard,
Except a thing that softly stirred,
Is stealing up the river side,
By six true followers gently plied,
Up slowly are they coming, near
The bank, with cautiousness and fear,
And now one who is in the stern.
Gives to the boat a hasty turn,
And she is quickly out of sight,
Hidden by both land and night.
And Harold now, where can he be ?
Oh he is standing by the wall,


Waiting with anxiety,
For there must his love gently fall;
Now is the time when she must drop,
From out her chamber to the ground,
When she must hasten, and not stop,
Till she hath reached the wall around ;
Then by a ladder must she climb
The high and lofty battlement,
And then descend down in short time,
To haste to where the boat has went.
Still Harold waits, but cannot hear,
Aught of his lady coming near,
Yet all is still, and not a sound,
Or ruffle can be heard around,
So still that had a pin but fell,
He could have heard the noise quite well;
Each moment doth he gaze up to
The wall, but nothing can he view,
Yet he doubts not, nor doth despair,
He knows his lady will be there,
But why she is not there by now,
Makes him for her uneasy grow.
And where is fair Olimpia now ?
Oh she is at her window sill,
With a throbbing heart and brow,
Agitated and unstill;
She looks out in the open air,
She listens, everything is still,
Down beneath, no sound is there,
Or round about where?er she will;
The night is dark, naught can she see,
Nothing therefore will see her,
Now?s the time when she will flee,
For nothing seems to be astir ;
Outside the window she hath got,
Now the rope is in her hand,
Which has been tied in a knot,
Firm to something that may stand ;
Now she doth begin to slide,
Slowly gently doth she glide,
Now she holds and looks below,


But the darkness seems to grow, .
No less than what it was before,
And yet there is not much rope more ;
Again she glides, and now is near,
The rope?s end, how she quakes with fear;
Again she holds, and looks beneath,
But all is black, as black as heath,
Which tells her that she is not near
The ground, for then ?twould be more clear
Once more she slowly doth descend,
But now the rope hath reached its end,
And still she cannot feel the ground,
With her feet or see aught around,
She trembles, for she doth not know,
How far the ground may be below,
And she is ?fraid to drop for fear.
The noise may reach some vassel?s ear ;
And now she cannot mount again,
To try to would be only vain.
O poor maid why did?st thou not make
The rope too long for safety?s sake,
Thou did?st care too much for its strength,
And cared too little for its length,
When had?st thou made it twice too long,
Or more, it could not have been wrong.
At length she doth decide to fall,
Down to the ground, however small,
Or great the distance yet may be,
For it doth seem her destiny;
Then lets she go from out her hand
The rope, and quickly she doth land,
Upon the ground, but from such height,
That it did give to her a fright,
That made her yield a low shrill cry,
That sounded, and pierced through the sky.
Which though reached not to Harold?s ear,
For he was not to her so near,
Yet it was caught by some around,
Who rushed to where they heard the sound
But Olimpia soon freed of her fright,
Hurries away with all her might,
Toward the wall, but soon are near


Her father?s followers like deer,
Hushing for what they cannot tell,
Though they can hear her footsteps well,
But cannot see, it is so dark,
But now they halt and once more hark.
And now again rush forward to,
Where they think her footsteps have flew;
They think it is some foeman sent,
By enemies on evil bent,
And therefore wish to catch the spy,
That he may for his purpose die;
On, on, she flies with all her speed,
Taking of the noise no heed,
But now she has reached to the wall,
And soon at her feet rope-steps fall,
For Harold on the other side,
Hears the coming of his bride,
And quickly throws a ladder o?er,
That reaches to them both and more;
But now the hunters can be heard,
Now they see the flying bird,
Up the steps the maid doth hie,
Soon the huntsmen her espy.
Quick they come with all their might,
That they may prevent her flight;
But the maiden now is near
The top, and is of danger clear ;
But ah, alas ! that it should be,
Just when the maid is of them free,
And is rejoicing o?er the ?scape,
That she so happily did make,
She takes a false step and doth slip,
And strains her arm, and looses grip.
And backward falls upon the ground,
Though softly with much noise and sound ;
Her followers now arc still more near,
And she indeed has cause to fear,
Up she hastes, though with some pain,
And quickly tries to mount again ;
Now she?s from the ground a yard,
And they arc coming quick and hard,
One is but six feet away,


Ready to seize on his prey,
With one arm outstretched at length,
Running with all speed and strength
To the castle?s wall, now he
Tries to seize hold of her, but she
Is just a hair?s breadth thickness past
His reach, and is ascending fast;
Soon the top she gains when she,
Descends again as rapidly,
But ere she reaches to the ground,
She is claspt by her lover round,
And kissed by him so often o?er,
That it would take an hour or more,
To count them o?er, so joyed w r as he,
That she escaped thus luckily.
Anon they hasten to the shore,
When their sweet welcomings are o?er,
And soon they reach their little bark,
That has been waiting in the dark,
But ere they have sat down therein,
They hear behind a rushing din,
It is the hunters on the scent,
Appearing to be firmly bent
On catching their escaping prey,
Whom they can hear hast?ning away :
Quick the oarsmen man the oars,
Quick the boat the water bores,
But another one is manned,
By the foe pursuing band,
Coming with all might and main,
Making every muscle strain,
Making every oar to bend,
And each straining stroke to send,
Their boat along at such a pace,
That she might with the eagle?s race;
They are gaining on them now,
And upon each sweating brow,
Drops are falling like the rain,
While every one in each boat strain
Their utmost, till exhausted quite,
Their strokes become both slow and light;


The hunters now no longer gain,
But hardly can their own maintain,
Harold stirs his valiant crew,
By his voice and muscle too,
Pull he cries, and pull they do,
Until 'twas like as if they flew,
Harder still, still Harold cries,
And now she through the water flies ;
But still they do not gain a yard.
The others seem to pull as hard ;
Now the blood mounts to his face,
Anger in his mind takes place,
Curse those cursed foes he cries,
When the lightning in his eyes,
Flashes forth like sparks of fire,
As if his thoughts were blazed with ire ;
0 that my bride were on yon land,
He cries, and safe from danger?s hand,
Then would I scorn to flee away,
But here, even here, would stand and stay,
And fight those villains all, or die
Ere I would from them wish to fly;
Then seizing hold upon an oar,
0 pull he cries, O pull once more,
And let us either tear away
Our limbs from out of where they stay,
Or leave those villains far behind,
As are the mountains by the wind ;
Then gathering up his strength he bends
His back, and through the water sends
The boat along as lightning flies,
When it is flashing through the skies ;
Quick as furious winds do blow,
Does she swiftly onward go,
With a speed that ne?er before,
Has been seen on earth or shore,
Through the sea she tears away,
Dashing to each side the spray,
Leaving far behind the foe,
Who still further distant grow ;
Yet they do not slack their pace,
But as swiftly onward race,


And thus do they quickly hie,
Till the distant shore they nigh,
To where the boat is straightly steered,
Until it is closer neared,
When a secret cave is seen,
That the huge rocks partly screen ;
The which is dwelt, in by a grave
Old hermit who lives in the cave,
Alone away from this world vile,
That sometimes doth the pure beguile |
To this they do direct their course,
Pulling now with much less force,
For they are far ahead of those.
Who lately were their dangerous foes,
And they are also hid from sight,
By the foggy cloud of night;
Within the cave they have got now,
And soon on the land the bow
Of their stout little bark is driven,
By one pull together given ;
Now Olimpia lands on shore,
And Harold also, but no more,
For here he doth intend to stay,
And means to send the rest away ;
But ere he does to them he says,
My friends and followers firm and true,
Whom I have ever, and always,
Found staunch in all the trials through
Which though and I at times have been,
Through all the dangers we have seen,
Accept from me my gratitude,
And more especially for this one,
When we so lately were pursued,
But which we did so overcome ;
Farewell, and come not back again,
Until my lady?s noble sire,
Repents, and seeks for her in vain,
And weeps o?er his uncalled for ire.
Away they speed and soon are gone,
When Harold leads his bride away,
And seeks the hermit who alone,
Is found where he is wont to stay ;


Here doth he wed the happy pair,
And here they stay with him a while,
Throwing aside all thought and care,
Happy in each other?s smile.
But soon the Earl hears of the flight,
Of his fair daughter, when his rage
Is like the storm on some dark night,
When do the winds and sea engage j
Black and dark his brow doth grow.
While wild thoughts across it blow.
Now black clouds do o?er it sweep,
While the lightning flashes peep,
From his eyes, and thunders roar,
From out his mouth, betraying sore
Conflicting troubles his mind fill.
As do the powers when all?s unstill;
Where is my daughter doth he cry�
0 she my lord has fled away ?-�?
Then may hell seize her ere she die,
Who thus would her sire disobey ;
And may I never see her face.
Or hear one word of her again,
For heaping on me such disgrace,
And on herself so great a stain;
And may she be forced back to me,
By poverty and grief and woe,
That I may taunt her misery,
And vex her worse for acting so �
And may her lover meet some end,
As foul as the infernal powers
Can in their deep fury send
To him in his most joyful hours.
Thus raged he on until the storm,
Had passed o?er, and went away,
When his mind took a calmer form,
As does the sky on summer?s day j
Then hied he to the noble Earl
Of Huntly, and told him how Tie,
Had been bereft of his fair girl,
In this affair of gallantry ;
But he least hasty of the two,


Consoled him to the loss be bore,
But he could not compose him to,
The breaking of the oath he swore ;
That sunk down deep into his soul,
And troubled him more than the rest,
For all else could he soon make whole,
But this could no way be redressed.
*****
Three years rolled on and silently,
Yet everything remained the same,
Until Lord Os wold suddenly,
To his decease untimely came ;
For him his father grieved full sore.
For deeply did he love his son,
For with him his great race was o?er,
As if it never had begun ;
No one was there now to succeed.
To all his fortune and his name,
No one to battle and to lead,
His followers to renown and fame ;
But when he dies his race must be,
Extinguished and forgot on earth,
With all their deeds of chivalry,
And all their glory and their worth.
"What shall he do then ? he will hie
To his brave comrade, and will try
To reconcile him to the maid,
Who 'gainst his wishes so much strayed
And then if Harold he?ll allow,
To wear his title when he dies,
His own he will place on his brow,
That they may twain together rise ;
For as the houses both have been,
United oft by marrying,
His sons would represent his line,
Were he, his with theirs to entwine.
To this the other doth agree,
For now the oath he swore is free,
For Huntly's son is dead and gone,
And now? the bond's no longer one ;
But where are they gone doth he say,


For since the night they fled away,
1 never once have for them sought,
Or hardly cast on them a thought;
They may be dead or may have been,
Drowned on the night they fled away,
When they were by my vassels seen,
And followed through the dashing spray :
And now the father?s love returns,
Remorse and sorrow fills his mind,
His soul for his lost daughter yearns,
Who was to him so good and kind;
He thinks of her but only now,
As the fair maid that once he knew,
Who used to kiss his throbbing brow,
When storms and tempests o?er it blew :
Where is my daughter doth he cry,
Where is my poor lost daughter gone,
He sobs, while tears flow from each eye,
Unchecked by him as they flow on ;
Here, here, thou slothful sluggard knight,
Here haste, go take my followers all,
And come not back unto my sight,
Or something ill shalt thee befall,
Until thou bring?st back to me,
My daughter who has crossed the sea.
But weeks have passed and yet no one,
Have found the place where they have gone,
And Arran?s grief grows more, and more,
And deeper than it was before ;
At length he issues a decree,
That whosoe?er shall find them tw*ain,
Will be made knights of high degree,
In his great and martial train.
Then away that sturdy crew,
Harold?s followers, firm and true,
Hasten to that distant shore,
Where they once had rown before;
And here they tell their master all,
That since his flight did befall.
Then away once more they flew,
Did that strong and faithful crew,
Pulling again with all their might,


Each one merry with delight,
Because he was to be a knight r
And because their lord would be
Harold of great and high degree ;
Still they row as if their pace,
Was to win some struggling race,
, , . OO O 7
But it is through joy they pull,
For their hearts with it are full;
Soon they reach Lord Arran?s shore.
When they land where they before,
Quitted with such haste and speed.
When pursued, as they had need ;
Harold now ?Jong with his bride,
Leaves the boat and water-side,
And hastens to the castle where.
He must present his lady fair.
But it so happened that this day,
Lord Huntly had called there to pay
A visit to his comrade dear,
To comfort him, and his mind cheer ;
And as they sat conversing on,
Olimpia, who had from him gone,
And of her dangers, whether she,
Had been drowned or had crossed the sea ;
The door was opened, and behold !
There stood the maid before their sight,
The image of her mother?s mould, ?
Lord Arran trembled, and turned white,
And rose, but all the while still gazed,
Grew paler, and still more amazed ;
Then seizing Huntly by the arm.
He held him with an iron grip,
As if afraid of some dread harm,
But not a word escaped his lip ;
Then raising up his other hand.
He points toward the open door,
Then losing of himself command,
He straightway sinks upon the floor;
He thought it was his lady?s ghost,
Come to rebuke him for his ire,
That caused Olimpia to be lost,


When flying from her angered sire;
O fatal shock, and deadly sight,
More strong than was tho strongest knight,
-More powerful than the sharpest sword,
How cruelly hast thou slain this lord.
.No sooner had Lord Arran fell,
Than Huntly who loved him so well.
Who loved him deep and true as none,
Have ever loved another one,
Raised him, and gazed upon his face,
To see if there be yet could trace,
A little life, a move, a sign.
Or tremour of a single line,
Or something that would to him say,
Life is not yet all gone away,
Rut nothing could the poor knight see,
When gazing on him wistfully,
Absorbed in deep and silent thought.
As if his eyes were fixed on naught,
He kissed his features three times o'er,
Fell backward, and then was no more.
Olimpia still stood at the door,
For the poor maid could do no more,
But when Lord Arran also fell,
She was released from her spell,
And rushing to her lifeless sire,
She poured forth lamentations dire.
But soon comes Harold to her side.
And comforts his bewailing bride,
But still even he cannot refrain
From tears, when he beholds the twain ;
O noble knights, he doth outcry,
The noblest of thy noble race,
O why did?st thou so quickly die,
Till I had seen thy living face,
To ask thy pardon, for to me,
Lies all the blame of what I see.
*****
A year has passed?a mourning year,
In which full many a bitter tear,
Was shed by Harold and his bride,


For those who now lay side by side,
For in one vault the two Earls lay.
As they had wished for many a day.
Harold now doth his bride tell,
Of what in youth to him befell;
How his great father in his land,
Had been a prince of high command,
But through a tyrant?s envious heart,
He w r as slain by a poisoned dart?
How he was then to Scotland brought,
For fear he also might be caught
And slain?how he was left alone,
?Long with a peasant all unknown,
Until he grew to man?s estate,
"When burning to avenge the late,
Of his lost father, he crossed o?er
The ocean to his native shore.
The same king still was on the throne,
(He was a kinsman of his own),
And still a bloody tyrant to
Those ?round him, and his subjects too ;
How he then sought him all alone,
And in a fierce menacing tone,
Charged him with words, and looks of ire,
With the foul murder of his sire ;
How then the king drew out his sword,
Ere he had spoken the last word,
And made a plunge, but missed his aim,
How Harold also did the same,
And that with force and aim so true,
That it pierced his base heart right through ;
How he then hurried from that shore,
And came to Scotia?s land once more.
But he and his fair lady now,^
Have two fair coronets on their brow,
And they are happy as the day,
When shines the sun in bright array;
Iso cloud now dims their happiness,
No griefs now make their pleasures less,
But each fills with sweet joy the other,
And thus they comfort one another;
But soon their joy is increased more,


For now a son and heir is bore,
And in another joyful year,
Another doth to them appear;
But after him no more are borne,
Nor happily are these from them torn,
But luckily live, and grow apace,
In strength and stature, mind and grace
The eldest one will be the heir,
Of Arran?s wealth and castle fair.
The other when his father dies,
Will Lord of Huntly next day rise,
And each shall be sire to a line,
That will make it with honour shine,
And shall do such deeds for its name,
As will give to it lasting fame;
And they will have kin on the throne,
Till it shall almost be their own,
And noble and brave will they be,
Well worthy of their ancestry ;
And they in time shall Scotland fill,
With hardy sons, and daughters till
No country will be peopled so,
With noble hearts as theirs shall grow,
Or shall each other love so well,;
As they, when they in peace do dwell;
And all through that love pure, and true,
That fondly in those two hearts grew.
THE END.
