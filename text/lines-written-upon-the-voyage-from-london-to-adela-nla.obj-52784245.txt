L IN ES.
Let those who may these lines .peruse,
Review with moderation
The efforts of a humble muse '
'To furnish information;
To give at length in 'verse, to all
An interesting message;
Concerning what did us befall,
W hile on our lengthy passage.
Before we left our native land,
To cross the briny ocean,
We read the public papers, and
They set our thoughts in motion.
They told us of a lady kind,
The best in all the nation;
The efforts of whose noble mind
Were aiding emigration.
We were .so thick upon the ground,
In our own favour'd nation ;
That honest labour seldom found
A fair remuneration.
So when we found this lady fair
Had made a good proposal,
If certain sums of money were
Then placed at her disposal:
That having these at her command,
She’d lend us half the money;
Until we earn’d it in a land
That flow’d with milk and honey :
And farther, when they said she would
Group us in social parties ;
Each said ’tis good, she’s noble blood,
So come along my hearties.


The time appointed drawing near,
■We soon prepar’d for starting ;
And when we left our kindred dear,
Oh ! hitter was the parting.
The third of May we came on board
A ship, that’s call’d the Blundell;
Where many useful things were stow’d,
In many a heavy bundle.
And such a scene we never saw,
Of bustle and confusion ;
No common sense, no rule, no law :
’Twas vexing and amusing
To see the boxes, hags, and all
Into the hold were tumbled ;
All cramm’d and jam’d, both great and small.
While many stood and grumbled.
But when wo to our Cabins hied,
And saw their small dimensions;
We were not long before We spied
Our lady’s kind intentions.
The space allowed for man and wife
Was 1 small enough, to smother ;
But being less lor four or live,
They tumbled o’er each other.
We went into the steerage then,
And oh 1 we blush to mention,
That with regard to single men,
She promis’d due attention.
Yet wore their berths so roughly made,
So closely she confined them ;
’Twas very well, wo since have said,
That she was left behind them.
At last they so fill’d every deck,
With living and dead lumber ;
Wo were not happy when awake,
Nor could wo sweetly slumber.
The first and part the second day,
She kept each person fasting ;
And when the ship at (Jravesend lay,
We busy were repasting.


And then our crowded barque
Was eramm’d to suffocation;
For heaps ol' boxes made it dark,
And stopped the ventilation.
A people then in such a case,
Must need ft good protector;
And very soon we had to face
A Government Inspector.
Anil surely from his jolly looks.
He must have lived in clover ;
And when at night he brought his books,
We wished him safe at Dover. .
Why did he moping come at night,
To make examination ?
Why choose the dark, why shun the light ?
We make interrogation.
As well might any bat or owl,
Go groping forth in daylight ;
Whose nature is at night to prowl,
If he would catch his prey right.
He sanction’d all he blindly saw,
Then left us to our sorrow ;
So, unprotected by the law,
We left Gravesend the morrow.
Yet still our lady simply thought,
We all lov’d ami rever’d her ;
So coming near ua in a boat,
Some blind ones faintly cheer'd her.
We soon sail’d clown Old Father Thames,
Betwixt Old England’s borders ;
When Mallett call’d on all the names,
For embarkation orders.
At night we anchor'd off the More,
With darkness hov’ring round us ;
And when the light return'd once more.
It swiftly sailing found us.
A fair wind blew, the'white foam flew,
The ship was gently rooking;
And oh ! when sickness seized a few,
The scene was truly shocking.


Tin' pent-up uir we breath’d below.
Was almost pestilential;
And that it should more freely flow,
Was truly most essential.
A child a dive disease had brought,
, Well known to be infectious ;
Whilst almost every hotly thought
That all conspired to vex uh.
Our Surgeon .whom we did bemoan,
Declin’d in health, and grew sick ;
Wliile loud complaints, and many a groan,
Made no delightful music.
t hi that same day, the eighth of May,
Wtt reach’d the Downs in daylight;
And there we were obliged to stay,
Or not pursue our way right.
We anchor’d there a day or more,
The town of Deal was near us,
So forty of us went on shore
To get something to cheer uh.
From Deal, at evening, we beheld
The signal out for sailing ;
So coming all on board, we sail'd
At midnight, without, failing.
We then were found to Plymouth hound,
Not as we Hist intended j
But we relinked a Surgeon Hound,
For (tlliumi was not mended.
W ith wind and tide we then did vide,
The numbers sick increasing ;
Whilst discontent on every side,
Drew louder and unceasing.
To crown our woch, we had too small
A cooking apparatus;
And onr good cook knew not at all
How to prepare potatoes.
They told us ait hook pots to bring,
Our dainties for to boil in.
But near the lire they would not swing,
We only found litem spoiling.


To cook a store for thirteen score,
Our cook lie was no sloven ;
And yet he could not bake our Hour,
Without a larger oven.
So on the poop'at eventide,
In consultation sitting;
Sought our Committee to provide,
' The measures most befitting.
Then from below they summon'd all,
And publicly projected,
That when we did at Plymouth call,
We should be re-inspected. u
But MallHt being still on hoard,
fie set his wits a working,
To get the boxes hotter stowed,.
The re-inspecting shirking.
And on the thirteenth day of May,
Ere nature was reposing,
We anchor’d safe in Plymouth Bay,
Just as the day was closing.,
But there we nothing heard or saw,
Qf being re-inspected;
For there was no appeal to law,
Or aught that was projected.
But .truly it did grieve us sore,
"When for our safe protection,
A family was sent on shore
For to avoid infection.
A female next was sent alone,
In England she has tarried,
For her state best befitted one
Who lawfully was married.
Our second mate the ship did quit
One night, without permission;
4nd coming back when he thought fit,
Was ikmished with dismission.
But then we got another soon,
Of whom we’ve 1 no complaining;
Old Neptune's son, right roughly hewn,
And no ways spoil’d in training.


Two bakers went on shore for yeast.
Good leaven’d bread for making;
And promis'd us a constant feast,
If we would pay for baking.
That feast at first was very small,
A favour’d few paid dearly
To get a taste ; die smell was all
That was proportioned fairly.
A Surgeon drunk at break of day,
Came staggering and swearing,
But being quickly sent away,
Me soon was out of hearing.
A third and last one came at length,
And he was found stout-hearted ;
So Gibson stayed to gather strength.
And with three cheers wc parted.
When Mattelt , left we cheer’d him too.
His absence not deploring;
Tiro inconvenience he well knew
For ns lie had been storing.
On May the eighteenth, we were found
From Plymouth harbour sailing ;
And once more for Australia bound,
'Gainst wind and tide prevailing.
Next day the wind blow hard ahead.
Our ship was then denoting,
As nearly all wore sick in bed,
A hospital a floating.
For several days our apx>otitos
Experienced no renewal ;
And cook to set us all to rights,
Made arrowroot and gruel.
But soon the sickness wore away,
And soon a fair wind set in,
Which Wow us safe o’er Biscay’s Bay,
Thus onward wo were getting.
We soon were off tire Spanish coast,
With cold and stronger breezes;
Our Surgeon then a plan proposed,
For to prevent diseases :


It was a rule to this effect,
That, weekly six men married.
Three times a day should clean the decks,
While in the ship we tarried.
Seven days from shore the Surgeon read.
Prayers on Sabbath morning ;
At night a few sung hymns on deck,
'Midst taunting jeers and scorning.
Next morn at ten, two islands small,
On the horizon verging, ,
Were dimly seen by nearly all,
’Mid distant clouds emerging ;
■And in the afternoon at four,
Madeira’s land, so healthy ;
Where many sick from Britain tour,
For health among the wealthy.
The twenty-ninth, at break of day,
We were informed on rising,
That the Canary Islands lay,
in beauty most surprising.
We saw.as though luxuriant crops
The people there were fearing;
And trees upon the mountain tops,
Above the clouds appearing.
The morrow found our noble barque
Within the Tropics sailing ;
And hitherto our baker’s work,
Had proved quite .unavailing.
So on the last of May begun
Fresh baking operations ;
For he who had our baking done,
Exhausted all our patience.
His mate, who little did or,said,
Now set die oven driving;
He bought his yeast, and got his trade,
And set it all a thriving.
The Sabbath, June the first, was spent
Just like the one preceding j
The following week there were events,
To joy and sorrow leading.


A single woman, June the third,
By solar rays was stricken,
When near the Island Cape de Verde,
If rightly we did reckon.
When sore from thirst, by heat produc’d,
Our water fresh was stinking ;
Our Surgeon issued lemon juice,
To make it tit for drinking.
When we had passed the Wednesday night,
Quite early on the morrow
A child was born, and all was right,
Which left no room for sorrow.
On the eventful sixth of June,
A man was hurt by falling
With water, in the afternoon,'
Which scalded him appalling.
“ In midst of life we are in death”
That evening taught us truly,
When one was call’d to yield her breath
To Him who gave it, duly:
From health an aged widow, she
In sickness soon was hurried ;
Then launched into Eternity,
And in the ocean buried.
On Saturday a shark was caught,
Which underwent dissection;
And in his belly there was naught
That did avoid inspection.
A ship we spoke at ten at night,
To Rotterdam was sailing;
And to report the Blundell right,
She promis’d without failing.
The Sabbath, on the eighth of June,
Was spent as usual; only
Another child was horn at noon,
And we wore not so lonely.
The ninth we saw two ■waterspouts,
And on the tenth another;
Great shark was caught, to banish doubt,
They-servod him like his brother.


When from the heat’s intensity,
In perspiration steeping ;
The. poop, ’neath Heaven's broad canopy,
We then preferr’d for sleeping.
The Sabbath, June the fifteenth, found
In us a host of fretters;
We spoke a French ship homeward bound,
But could not, send our letters.
The sixteenth, quite cool’d every deck,
By rain in torrents falling ;
Our baker’s health now proved a wreck,
And he resign’d his calling.
The nineteenth day of June we found
Our numbers still increasing;
Another birth was whisper’d round,
And may it prove a blessing. -
For three weeks, more or less, detain’d
By calms, with little tossing;
The twenty-first, one point we gain'd,
When we the line were crossing.
Our noble crew, a civil band,
All ocean dangers braving;
May all remember when we land, ,
They pjay’d no tricks by shaving.
The twenty-fourth distinguished by
Our baker recommencing;
And passing when the wind was high,
An Island call’d Ascension,
The twenty-eighth unseen we pass’d,
The Isle of Saint Helena;
Where Buonaparte was sent at last,
From France, and war’s arena.
The second of July, we hail’d
A ship by signalizing;
The Briton True , which faslly sail’d
To India enterprising.
r fhe third, our boiler, sprung a leak,
Which happily was mended;
We clear’d the Tropics that same week.
And wish’d our voyage ended.


And then at night our- helmsman slept,
And left tlxe- ship unguided';
But better watch another kept,
Who quickly had her righted.
.Inly the sixth, on Sabbath-day,
Wo signall’d HolikH
To India she was on her way,
May each get salt! to harbour ;
The sendee held, and all was well;
But on the morrow after,
A man from oil' the long boat fell,
Which prov’d a sad disaster.
The tenth, they caught a long and round
A large and weighty porpoise ;
For oil they boil'd his blubber down,
And feasted on his corpus.
The twelfth, the ('apu we were abreast,
Our ( loud Hopes onward pressing,
To Ibid a belter earthly rest,
The promis'd laud posse,suing.
Next Suhkith morn was spent anew,
The morning prayers repeating ;
And in the evening by a few
Holding a prayer meeting.
And on the lifteemlu all the crow
Struck work for good provisions ;
‘ I’was nought hut right, mtr Captain knew,
To yield to their conditions.
And on the sixteenth day, onr cook
Was wounded and disabled ;
A passenger hisoflieo took,
Till he should he enabled.
The seventeenth onr baker stopp'd.
From his own undertaking ;
His yeast was spread, and he was popp'd,
For nearly all went baking.
Then overboard his tub he threw,
( hoiec is no obligation j
The leaven old wim Himn made new,
By simple operation.


The twenty-third a lesson (old ;
Another of our number,
A child one year and nine months old,
In death did sweetly slumber.
The twenty-fifth, ere night had fled,
■ The wind around was howling ;
Which toss’d ns to and fro in hod,
And kegs and cans were rolling.
The thunder, lightning, rain and hail,
Were truly most appalling ;
And closely haul’d was every sail,
The men aloft were bawling.
From off the shelves with many wrecks,
Things fell in wild profusion,
Both fore and aft, the ships 'tween decks,
The scene was all confusion.
The decks were swamp’d, the helmsman lush’d,
The flying jib went flying ;
O’er mountain waves the Blundell dash’d,
Down on her beam ends lying.
Wc oft from side to side were hurl’d,
By force of gravitation ;
Ere night approach’ll, the sails unfurl’d
Proclaim'd the storm's assuasiou.
The twenty-eighth, Scotch Bouilli soup
The Surgeon then inspected :
The best was bad, by ev’ry group
The stinking was rejected.
Next eve a false alarm of fire.
Produc’d a consternation;
.(The cook was putting out his fire,)
’Twas quite without foundation.
Attempts at verse about this time,
Were made upon the meases ;
By one who from his public rhyme,
More noise than charms possesses.
Unmeasur’d rhymes satirical,
Full of personalities ;
They surely are no miracle,
Whatever he their 'qualities.


Another flaming poet then,
Noth fore anil aft diffusing,
With pencil wrote instead of pen,
The matter most amusing.
The Blundell , officers, and crow,
Our shipmates and committee,
The broken mast, the galley too,
In his new style so witty.
The ninth of August, with delight
Saint Paul’s, an island, viewing ;
And had we pass’d it in the night,
It might have prov’d our nun.
And on the sixteenth, blew a blast,
Which quickly broke asunder
With force our main-top-gallant mast,
Hut hurt no person under.
The twenty-second, beef was weighed,
liefore and after cooking ;
We found that nearly half had strayed,
And was not that provoking ?
The twenty-fourth, at early morn,
Before the hour for rising,
Another child on hoard was horn,
Quite sudden and surprising.
That day, at ton, on deck we met,
Our grievances lamenting;
Then got them all in order set,
Just ready for prosen ting.
That efforts made for public good,
From practice being corrected ;
Our friends who follow after would,
Then better he protected.
For seven successive Sabbaths past,
The prayers on deck omitting ;
Wc on each evening to the last,
Did hold a prayer meeting.
And on the thirtieth, land a head,.
At midnight thou wo sighted,
And many who had gone to bed,
Soon rose again delighted.


The promis’d land we saw next day,
The day for rest intended;
That night our ship at anchor lay,
Our voyage then was ended.
That morn another child was horn,
But did not see the morrow ;
Her mother then from earth Was torn,
Which turned our joy to sorrow.
Now let us thank kind Providence,
For health and preservation ;
That we have safely journey’d hence,
And reach’d our destination.
