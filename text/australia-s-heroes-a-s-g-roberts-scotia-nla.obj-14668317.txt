OUR SOLDIERS' GOOD-BYE.
Austral's bonny Sunlit glades,
I must leave awhile,
But I'll come back to you again,
Though 'twere ten thousand mile.
Yes, we'll go and meet the foe,
Be this our brave endeavour,
To lay the proud agressor low,
And crush his power for ever.
Foremost comes our "Light Brigade,"
Australia's lads they number,
May they glorious deeds achieve,
To make the "World" wonder.
Bold, brave sons of "Scots wha hae,"
They are coming forward,
And soon to Bagpipe's cheery strain,
Will be marching onward.
Tullabardine's Marquis may,
Again in Scotia's Land,
Meet Austral Lads he led so brave,
On Afric's Sunny Strand.
Now a cheer for all so dear;
A cheer, long, loud and hearty,
God bless our Bright Australian Land,
Our Soldiers and the Khaki.
Back to Austral's sunny glades,
Victorious, honoured men,
We'll sing the "Harry Lauder" song,
For "We're all richt ye ken."
" Scotia."

THE MARCH OF AUSTRALIA'S
BRAVE MEN.
AIR: The March of the Cameron Men.
Thousands of men in Australia's Fair Land,
Are leaving their loved homes to-day,
In response to the call of "Old England" to
stand
Side by side in "Fierce Battle Array."
Brave Men and Lads together will go,
With hearts united and true,
Determined to Conquer the "Iron Heel" foe,
And keep flying "The Red, White and
Blue."
I hear the Bagpipes cheery sounding,
Tho' far from its own native glen,
Hark! strong measured footsteps are coming'
this way, ■
'Tis the march of Australia's Brave Men.
How nobly they tread! each Austral man
knows,
He may see his loved country no more,
Yet eagerly on to "Old England" he goes,
Where his Ancestors fought long before.
Success to "Our Troops" and* a "Speedy
Return,"
Is voiced by "Ten thousand times ten,"
Happy that day when "All" eyes will turn,
To the coming of Austral's Brave Men.
Long live our King, Long may he reign,"
May Britannia long, long Rule the Waves,
Lnder "Old England's Flag" we will ever
remain,
For we're Britons, and ne'er shall be
slaves.
" Scotia."

AUSTRALIA'S HEROES.
A Message came from Britain,
To Australia's sunny land,
And cheerily Our Soldiers sailed,
For a distant foreign strand.
Why all this hurried mustering,
Why leave their home so dear,
Where_ all was happiness and peace,
With friends both far and near?
Their glorious Liberty at stake,
That was the Magic Chord,
Which sent a thrill through every heart,
And made them draw the Sword.
Again! Again! Again! they charged,
Death to those Turkish knaves,
Oh! Nobly was that Victory won,
By Australia's brave Brigades.
Then flashed this note from Britain,
Across the Ocean wave,
" Australia! we proclaim you,
The Bravest of the Brave."
Your Fame has spread from shore to shore,
Sons of our British Born,
Long may your flag of Freedom
Withstand the Battle's Storm.
Widows—Orphans—Mothers—All,
Our hearts are with your Slain,
Whose Lives went out, Ah! all too soon,
Near Egypt's desert plain.
History's future pages will
Their daring Valour tell,
Flow for their "King and Country"
They like True Soldiers fell,
" Scotia."


OUR SOLDIERS' RETURN.
AIR: Will Ye No come Back Again?
()ur Soldier Lads have sailed away,
Far across the stormy main,
Glad we'll be to greet the day,
When they will come back again.
Britain's call to Austral Land,
Roused in them the "John Bull" Strain,
Soon with Britain's Lads they'll'stand,
To "Strike! Strike hard!! and Strike again!!
Sweet the Magpie's cheery note,
Sweet Boronia's wee brown flower,
And sweet our bonny Wattle bloom,
That sheds abroad its golden shower.
But sweeter far than all of these,
To us will be that happy day,
When "See the Conquering Hero Comes,"
Floats sweetly over Hobson's Bay.
We'll think of them at gloamin' hour,
As well.as in the morning grey;
May Heaven her blessings on them shower,
And guard them till that happy day
Sailing cheerily back o'er the main,
Our Lads will sing gaily, the sweet old
refrain:
AIR: Home, Sweet Home.
"Wherever we Wander, wherever we roam,
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like
Home."
" Scotia."
