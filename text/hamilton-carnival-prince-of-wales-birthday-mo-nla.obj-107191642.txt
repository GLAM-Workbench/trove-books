THE GRAND PROCESSION
(Headed by the Hamilton Brass Sana; will start from the Town Hall punctually
at Ten o’Clock. The last Procession was a GREAT FRAUD, but the ConuuittM
obtained valuable experience on that occasion, and this time they intend to give thft
Public the benefit of the same. The result will so surprise the people as to cause
—as the American poet pensively expresses it— u their eyes to bung out.” Owing
to limited space the Committee cannot illustrate the Procession at length, but they
have obtained a small sketch from their special artist (in his sober moments) of the
beginning and end of the Cavalcade. It is here shown, to give subscribers an idea
of the
