CHAPTER I
ELSIE FINDS A POST-BOY
AD, can we have the horse this after
noon ? ?
? What for, my girl ? ?
?To drive into Boollambi for the
mails. The English mail will be in
to-day, and I want it most particularly.?
To-morrow will do for that well enough,
Elsie ; no need to send two days running.?
? Oh, father, just this once.?
Mr. Cameron, hearing the sound of tears in his
daughter?s voice, looked up to see unmistakable
signs of them in her pretty brown eyes, and was
inclined to relent.
? What does ?we ? mean, Elsie ??you and
Nora ? ?
? I can?t go,? said a younger girl from the other
side of the dinner-table. ? I unpicked the hem
of my only tidy skirt to let it down this morning,
and it will take two or three hours to finish it.?
Elsie glanced at the tired-looking mother who
sat at the head of the table, dispensing second


helpings of pudding to two hungry boys. Mrs.
Cameron shook her head.
? Not to-day, dear,? she said gently.
? Couldn?t I have Jess and ride in, daddy dear ?
I won?t be gone long.?
?No,? he said decisively. ?The road is not
safe for a lonely girl, with hawkers and tramps
about ; you must wait till to-morrow.?
Mrs. Cameron saw Elsie?s lip quiver.
? The dish is empty, Clem, so you can?t have
any more,? she said hastily. ? Off with you,
boys.?
Elsie disappeared too, leaving her mother and
Nora to clear the table. She tied on her big
shady hat and walked slowly across the paddock
in front of the farm. Below lay another field,
brilliant in purple and green, for the lucerne was
in flower; then a line of trees, wonderfully green
for Australia, whose freshness told of the river
they hid from view.
Elsie had not gone far when her ear caught a
distant sound, and she quickly retraced her steps ;
not into the house, but round to the other side,
through the cow-yard and a paddock to the
Boollambi road. She leaned on a slip-rail and
watched a bend in the road where the dried-up
gum-trees, well away from the river these, hid
the track beyond.
In a minute or two a young man rode round
the corner. He pulled up his horse and took off
his brown felt hat as he caught sight of Elsie.
? Oh, Stan,? she cried, ? are you going to
Boollambi ? ?
He dismounted and led his horse to the rail.
? Anything I can do for you, Miss Elsie ? ?


? Indeed, yes, if you are going into town. I
want my letters, and father won?t let me go to-day
to get them. He says the road is not too safe;
and I do want them so badly, but if you are going
that will be all right.?
If he had not meant to go to Boollambi that
afternoon, Stanley Wilton did not say so. He
watched the girl?s flushed eager face as she spoke,
and was quite ready to gratify her wish, however
inconvenient it might be to him.
? You shall have them before tea, Miss Elsie.
Mr. Cameron is quite right about the road.?
?Oh, thank you, Stan ; you are good. If you
only knew how much I want them ! ?
? Mayn?t I know ? ?
? It is the English mail day, and I want Aunt
Sarah?s letter.?
The young man smiled ; he had no objection to
Aunt Sarah?s letters.
? You see,? Elsie went on, ?it is nearly six
weeks since my twenty-first birthday. Aunt
Sarah always writes to us on our birthdays, so
it is just time for my letter to get here from
London, and the reason I want it is that she told
mother in her last letter that there was a great
surprise in store for me on my twenty-first birth-
day, and I believe, I do really believe, she means
to send for me to go to England. Oh?h! ?
Elsie drew a long breath expressive of delight
at the prospect. She looked happy enough now,
and did not notice the shadow on her companion?s
face.
? You want to leave us, Miss Elsie ? ?
? I want to go to England ; it is the wish of my
life. Hurry, oh, hurry, Stan, and bring me my


letter. I know it will be that, and I can?t wait
until to-morrow,?
She waved her hand to him as he rode off, and
ran back to the house so gaily that her mother
smiled.
?So you found a post-boy, Elsie ? That?s
right ; now come along and help with the dishes.?
But Elsie was too much excited to be of use.
She gave Mrs. Cameron a hug, and danced about
the kitchen in high glee, brandishing her tea-cloth.
? I want Aunt Sarah?s letter,? she cried. ? Oh,
mummy, I do want to go to England, and surely
she means to send for me this time.?
? English ladies don?t behave like that,? said
Nora. 1,4 I don?t know what Aunt Sarah will say
when she finds a wild Bush girl on her hands.?
Elsie stopped in front of her sister and dropped
a low curtsey.
? Will that do, Miss Know-all ? ?
? Curtseys are out of fashion.?
? Not at Court. There, see how I can manage
my train.?
She pulled off her apron and pinned it to the
hem of her skirt, and swept about the kitchen.
? The wild Bush girl is presented to the Queen !
M hat letters I shall write to you, and how you
will envy me! Oh, I wish Stan would hurry.
Don?t try to lift that pan, mummy, I?ll do it.
Quince-jam ? How good it smells, and what a
lot ! why, Stan will be back before it is all
bottled.?


CHAPTER II
THE ENGLISH MAIL COMES IN
IFE is just made up of cooking and
eating and washing up, and then
begin all over again.?
Elsie whipped up the pastry-board
from behind the kitchen-door as
she spoke, and began to roll out a lump of dough
with an old glass bottle.
? Nora, you are the most annoying girl ; why
won?t you agree with me ? I can?t get one good
grumble out of you in these days, and by rights
you ought to grumble more than I do.?
? That is a funny sort of ? ought,? ? said Nora.
? When I have succeeded in making a hole in this
kerosene-tin and the hammering stops, you must
tell me why it is my duty to grumble.?
Elsie took the iron shelf out of the oven,
dusted it with her apron, and arranged her scones
carefully so as to fit them all in at once.
? There,? she said, shutting the oven door.
? Those are for you, Stan, because you have gone
for my letters. The others would only have had
last week?s bread if it hadn?t been for you. Why
should you grumble more than I, Nora ? You
don?t like cooking and I do, though of course I
hate the tidying up afterwards, and you are so fond
of books and things that it must be much harder
for you to be always pottering about in here than
for me, yet you do twice as much as I,? she added
remorsefully, ? and I don?t believe mother will
miss me a bit when I go home.?


? Home ? meant England, still means England,
to the fourth generation of native-born Australians.
Nora left her work and came round and kissed
Elsie as she sat on the corner of the table. Her
dark curls touched Elsie?s fair fluffy hair, and the
younger girl?s voice had quite a motherly tone.
? Why, you are the light of the house, Elsie,
as father says sometimes, but, dear, don?t make
too sure that Aunt Sarah will send for you. It
might mean disappointment too hard to bear with-
out grumbling, and I am afraid grumbling is not
a duty for you or me or any one.?
? She must have meant that, Nora ; what else
could the great surprise be ? It will come in this
letter with a cheque, a big, big cheque to buy
clothes and pay my passage, and Oh, the
scones are burning.?
? Tea?oh ! ? called Clem from the verandah
outside, ? Dad?s washing his hands, and Chris
is ready too, and Clem is mighty hungry. Scones,
Elsie ; give me one.?
? No, no, Clem. Well, just one, that one with
the burnt comer. You shall have another with
honey if you will just run to the corner and see if
Stan is coming along the road ; two if he is.?
Clem raced across the paddock and was back
before the scone was ready.
? Not a sign of him, Elsie ; was he coming to
tea ? There aren?t any bushrangers now to stop
him. It must have been fine fun to live in those
days,? added Clem, his mouth full of hot scone
and honey. ? They?d have found Stan a pretty
tough fellow to interfere with. If only there
were some here I?d go out and catch them, and
wouldn?t I just ?


But how Master Clem would have behaved
had he met a desperate man with a gun remained
untold, as Mr. Cameron called for his tea, and
they all sat down again to table. Half-way
through tea a quiet voice at the door said ?
? May I come in, Mrs. Cameron ? ? and Stanley
Wilton came in and shook hands with her.
Mr. Cameron nodded to him and went on
steadily with his scones-and-honey. Elsie gave a
little cry of delight and jumped up.
? Stan, where are my letters ? ?
? Let him have his tea first,? said Mr. Cameron
kindly. ? You must be thirsty, Wilton, after
your long ride.?
? Pretty well,? he said. ? But the letters are
here, Miss Elsie ; three for your father, one for
Miss Nora, one for Mrs. Cameron, and a packet
for yourself.?
Elsie took them one by one, and looked at her
own little paper packet with doubtful eyes.
? It?s the surprise from Aunt Sarah for your
birthday,? Chris said. ? Open it, Elsie, and let
us see.?
It was a surprise indeed. Elsie?s hopes fell.
Her fingers trembled too much to untie the
string, and Clem pulled out his penknife and
cut it for her. The wrappings at last were
made to disclose a small jeweller?s box, and in
it lay an old-fashioned gold and enamelled
watch set with pearls, and a slip of paper.
?To Elsie on her 21st birthday. Her grand-
mother?s watch.?
It was a pretty enough gaud, and just the thing
to take Elsie?s fancy, but she had so persuaded
herself that the long-wished-for invitation was


to come by that mail, that it was all she could
do to keep back the tears of disappointment
gathering fast in her eyes.
? It is my mother?s watch, Elsie,? said Mr.
Cameron. ? Bring it here, my girl. I remember
it so well; it was one of the good old wear-for-ever
sort. Why, she used to hold it to our ears when
we were young enough to ? listen to the tick-
tick.? ?
?Was that the pretty grandmother whose
picture you have in your room, daddy ? ? asked
Nora, coming round to his side to look more
closely at the watch.
? That was she, Nora. You were named
after her, you know. It is a Scottish custom to
call a girl after her grandmother, and as your
mother chose Elsie?s name, I called you Nora.
My mother was the prettiest girl in Edinburgh at
one time ?
Mr. Cameron comfortably launched on re-
miniscences of the Scotland of his boyhood, and
earlier, drew off all attention from Elsie, and
she slipped out of the room unobserved save
by Stanley Wilton. Mrs. Cameron was busy
reading her letter, and Nora started to clear
away the tea-things with Ciena?s help.
? Is that a letter from Phil, mother ? ? Chris
asked. ? What does he say about the cricket-
match ? ?
? Only that he took three wickets, he does not
say how, and hopes to be included in the eleven
to play in Queensland. The chief piece of news
is that he is coming home next week, and bringing
Gilmore Wickham with him.?
? We?ll be jolly glad to have Phil, mother, but


I don?t know about the other chap. He must
be a bit of a muff, I think.?
? I don?t know why you say that, Chris,? said
Nora hotly. ? Phil always says he is a splendid
fellow, and I can?t see why a man should be a
muff just because he is going to be a clergyman.?
? Oh, of course you will like him, Nora ; you
always were rather goody-goody, but you can?t
expect us fellows to enjoy milk-and-water. Come,
Clem,? and Chris walked out of the kitchen before
Nora could reply.
Outside, under the brilliant Australian moon-
light, Elsie was leaning against a slip-rail with
Stanley Wilton by her side.
The gum-tree stumps in the paddock beyond
had a bogey look about them, the shadows were
so very clear, and ? Tom Bolt,? the nearest ap-
proach to a cuckoo that Australia can produce,
was calling his own name from the trees by the
river.
Stanley watched his companion for some time
in silence.
? I am so sorry you were disappointed, Miss
Elsie,? he said at last.
? Oh, don?t talk about it, Stan. It is too
sickening to think lam not to go. What business
had that tiresome old woman to raise hopes that
she would send for me if she did not mean to do
so ? ?
Stanley was silent. He was an excellent
confidant, and chatterbox Elsie went on?
? Nora says it doesn?t do to think too much
about things you?re not sure of ; I suppose she
is right, but I can?t help making plans. I think
and think and arrange how everything is going to


happen, and it is just horrid when people spoil
it all as Aunt Sarah has spoilt this one ?the
loveliest plan of my life, too. Don?t you ever
make plans, Stan ? ?
? There is one plan I make,? he said slowly,
after a moment?s pause. ? Sometimes it grows
into a beautiful castle in the air, but it depends
on another person, like?like?your plan and
Aunt Sarah, you know, and my poor castle blows
away quicker than I can build it up.?
? What is your plan,Stan? Going to England? ?
? No,? he answered. ?It sometimes ends
with that after years of work and earning money,
but that isn?t in the real plan. There is a dairy
farm up the river a bit, and a nice little house,
and ?and ?and my Aunt Sarah to make it home
for herself and for me.?
? What a dull, dull plan ; just a dairy farm
and a house ! ?anyway it will be easy enough to
make that come true.?
?But I want a mistress for the house, Elsie ?
She did not realize all that was ready to come
if she would but listen, but the sudden change
in his tone roused the instinct of flight, and she
interrupted him hastily.
? There?s mother calling. Come along, Stan,
and we?ll have a game of euchre before you go.?


CHAPTER 111
MUFFS AND MISSIONARIES
O you know,? said Chris confidentially,
? I thought you were going to be
an awful muff.?
?No, really ? What made you
think that ? ?
Gilmore Wickham lay at the bottom of the
clumsy old punt in which the Camerons paddled
about the river. He looked at Chris for a moment,
and then his eye travelled lazily back to the most
exquisite scene he had known.
The river, winding up above Niddry, the
Camerons? farm, towards the mountains ; green
banks, shelving here, steep and shady there ;
here a hollow shimmering with delicate fronds of
maidenhair fern, there a flat with cattle drinking
greedily ; big dragon-flies enjoying the heat, and
now and then a fish leaping and splashing back
into the water. Tussocks of coarse grass growing
out of the deep water, and looking, with their
reflection in the slowly-moving river, like great
sheaves of corn tied in the middle ; and up in the
distance rugged mountains, blue, with shades of
brown, melting further back into a more vivid
blue against the still bluer sky.
At one end of the punt sat Chris with a fishing-
rod ; at the other, behind Gilmore Wickham,
Nora paddling an oar. Gilmore was one of those
rare people who know how to be lazy when the
right time comes, and he was enjoying himself.
? What made you think that ? ?


? A little nearer the bank, Nora, please ; hook
into that tree ; that?s right.?
Chris made his cast and waited.
? Well, Christopher ? ?
I don t know exactly,? the boy said slowly.
1 suppose it was because you are going to be a
parson. You see, there was a fellow up here who
tried to be a parson, and they wouldn?t have him
He was a muff if you like.?
Gilmore?s face looked stern for a moment, but
his eyes twinkled at the end of Chris?s speech
?�� y� u thmk the y will have me ?? he asked.
they d be muffs if they didn?t.?
\\ hat does muff mean exactly in vour
vocabulary, Chris ? ? J
Oh, a stupid sort of johnny; can?t play
games or take chaff; got no pluck and that sort
of thing.?
And pray how many parsons have you met
who answered that description ? ?
? Now 1 come to think of it,? said Chris, ? it
will sound a bit funny to you, I expect : I have
never known one at all. They don?t trouble us
here.
Gilmore half sat up in the punt and then lav
down again. J
Phil told me you were a long way from a
church, he said, ? But I did not know it was
as bad as that.?
So you see, ? Chris went on, ? Jimmy Dance
is the nearest approach to a parson I know, and I
thought perhaps they all had to be a bit like
that.?
?Did you ever hear of Bishop Patteson ? ?
Gilmore asked.


? No ; what sort of chap was he ? ?
? He was a parson, and he went to teach the
people in the Islands to be Christians. He used
to draw the children round him, and get the
parents to lend them to him to be taught. He
took them to New Zealand, and then to Norfolk
Island, and taught them and took them back to
their parents every year. They are a wild sort
of people in those Islands, and his life was often
in danger, but he went on and on going to see
them and telling them about Jesus Christ till
they killed him.?
? What did they do that for ? ?
? Some traders had been to one of the islands
a few days before the Bishop and stolen some
natives for slaves, killing five of them, so they
revenged themselves on the first white man they
saw, though he would have given his life rather
than have injured one of them.?
?Why ? They were only blackfellows, weren?t
they ? ?
? Blackfellows have souls, Chris, and Patteson
loved them and called them his children.?
? Funny sort of children to kill him ; all the
same, Mr. Wickham, it was those traders who
ought to have been shot. But parsons aren?t
all like Bishop Patteson, are they ? ?
?No, but a great many are just as brave,
though we don?t hear about them. Men are
risking their lives in New Guinea and China and
ever so many places every day in order to teach
people about Christ.?
? There was a chap here last week who said
the New Guinea missionaries were a measly lot,
and cheated and did a lot of harm. Nora pitched


into him like anything, and said she couldn't
contradict his stories word for word, but how was
it when any cannibalism broke out there, it didn t
happen near the missionary stations ? ?
Gilmore had almost forgotten the girl behind
him ; now he raised himself and turned towards
her.
? What did he say to that, Miss Nora ? ?
? Oh, he only laughed and said it was chance.
I did wish I knew better how to answer him.
It?s so mean of people to run down missionaries,
who have more difficulties to face than they
dream of.?
? It is indeed,? said Wickham gravely, ? and
they do incalculable harm. Would you like to
know why the New Guinea missionaries are run
down, Chris ? ?
? Yes, please.?
? There are a lot more traders like those men
who caused Bishop Patteson?s death. They are
a mean and cruel set of men whose only desire
is to get money, and because the missionaries
have interfered with their plans and protected
the poor natives, they get angry and circulate
these stories. It is the easiest thing in the world
to make fun of parsons and missionaries, Chris,
and help people to despise them. I wouldn?t do it
if I were you.?
? I won?t,? said Chris. ? Tell me some more
stories, please.?
Gilmore looked at Nora.
? Please do,? she said emphatically.
So the story of Bishop Hannington was told,
then Livingstone and Mackenzie, then black
Bishop Crowther, till a bugle-note sounded from


the farm, and Nora turned the punt and they
paddled home to dinner.
Chris stayed to make the punt fast and collect
his fishing-tackle, while Gilmore and Nora walked
through the wood and purple lucerne field up to
the house.
? 11 was brave of you to defend the mission-
aries, Miss Nora,? he said. ? I know how hard
it is.?
? I hate meanness,? said Nora. ? Besides ?
She glanced up at him from under her shady hat
? Yes ? ? J
Do you know, Mr. Wickham, you are the kind
of person one can tell things to. I never felt
as if I could tell it before.?
? w hat is it you want to tell ? ?
?I want to be a missionary,? she said quietly.
? I have wanted it all my life.?
CHAPTER IV
CLEM AS COOK
Nora, why don?t you hurry,
jr [gvK and where is that tiresome Chris ? ?
A dishevelled and excited Elsie,
with a broomstick in one hand, ran
round the house as Gilmore and
Nora approached.
? What is the matter, Elsie; isn?t dinner
ready ? ? asked Nora, running to meet her sister.


? Dinner ! ? said Elsie. ? No, of course it isn?t
dinner-time. Anyway, dinner isn?t ready. Such
a chase I?ve had. Oh ? and Elsie and the
broomstick disappeared.
? What can be the matter, Miss Nora ? ?
? I expect it is the calf,? said Nora. ? Let
us go and see,? and she led the way into the yard
at the back of the house.
A big bull calf was rushing up and down and
absolutely refusing to be driven out of the yard
into his own paddock. On a line across the yard
hung a torn white garment. Elsie, almost in
tears, threw down her broomstick and gave up
the chase as she saw the others.
? It?s my best white skirt, Nora. I?ll never be
able to wear it again. That horrid calf has eaten
a hole right through the front breadth.?
? How did he get in ? ?
? Broke the rail there in the comer. ?Oh, Mr.
Wickham, take care ! He will knock you down
if you go at him like that ; dodge, quick! ? and
Elsie joined in the fray again.
Nora guarded one comer of the yard, Chris
came running up to help, and between them they
managed to drive the refractory calf over the
fence again, and to fasten up the broken rail.
? Where are all the others, Elsie ? ? asked Chris.
? Mother drove into Boollambi with father and
Phil ; she heard that Mrs. Smith was ill, and
thought she might be able to help. I don?t know
where Clem is; he is never here when he is
wanted.?
? Clem has been busy watching the fun all the
time,? said a voice from the roof of the stable,
? and Clem wants his dinner.?


? You little horror ! If I wasn?t so tired I
declare I would send you after the calf. You
just shan?t have any dinner.?
? Nobody will get much,? said Nora, who had
been into the house. ? The kitchen fire is out;
I am afraid your cakes will be spoilt, Elsie.?
? I am too hot and tired to care,? said Elsie,
throwing herself down on a seat on the verandah.
? You all look pretty warm,? said Clem. ?If
only you would be sensible and take things
quietly like your little brother, Elsie ! Look
here, you all sit down and rest and I will get the
dinner. There?s plenty of meat and bread, and
I?ll light the Primus stove and make tea. No,
thank you, Nora, I don?t want any help, and you
shall have it in no time.?
Nora brought out some oranges, and the four
sat on the verandah eating the fruit, while Elsie
fought her battle o?er again, and consulted Nora
as to the possibility of a darn in the white skirt.
? How would a band of insertion do, Elsie ?
There is that Madeira work of mother?s,? Nora
was saying, when a cry from within interrupted
her, and Clem came running out, his hands before
his eyes and a bluish flame running up one sleeve
and the breast of his coat.
? Clem ! what is the matter ? ? Elsie cried,
while Chris caught up an empty sugar-bag lying
by the door.
? Don?t mind me,? the boy said. ? Kitchen?s
on fire.?
He was making for the tub of water in which
Elsie had done her washing, but Gilmore Wickham
caught him, half-blinded as he was, before he had
time to plunge his face and hands into the soapy


water to seek relief for his pain. He gave a feeble
struggle and then fainted in Gilmore?s arms.
Gilmore laid him down on the verandah,
covered the poor burnt face with his handkerchief,
and ran to the kitchen-window to find that Chris
and the girls had easily conquered the fire.
? It was only methylated spirit,? said Chris,
? It is all right, Mr. Wickham ; no harm done.?
? Only the fate of my poor white skirt decided,?
said Elsie. ? Chris dipped it in a bucket and threw
it on the fire.?
? Clem?s face is badly burnt, and he has had
a shock,? Gilmore said gravely. ? Bring some
oil quickly, please, Miss Cameron, and bandaging
if you have it. Chris, can you find some brandy ? ?
But Clem regained consciousness without the
brandy, to find Gilmore bandaging his face, and
the girls and Chris bending over him.
? Is the house burnt down ? ? he asked con-
fusedly.
? No, old chap, it?s all right,? said Chris, ? and
you will be all right too, directly.?
? How far is it to the doctor ? ? Gilmore asked,
calling Elsie aside.
? Twenty-five miles to Port Weston,? said
Elsie. ?We couldn?t take him there to-day
because Jess is the only horse available just now,
and they have taken her in to Boollambi. But
Clem will be all right now you have bandaged
him, w r on?t he, Mr. Wickham ? It does not seem
to be a very bad burn.?
? It would be better for the doctor to see him.
I don?t think you need be anxious, Miss Cameron,
but you see the bums are on his face, and proper
treatment may save him from a lasting scar.?


? I don?t know what to do,? said Elsie. ? I
wish mother was here. She has not been away
from the farm for months till to-day, and now
this happens. Stanley Wilton would lend us a
horse, but it is four miles tq his place, and he is
sure to be out till evening.?
? How about the nurse at Greenwood ? ? said
Nora, coming up to join her sister, and leaving
Chris to look after Clem. ? She would have the
proper things, and the doctor will be there to-
morrow. Saturday is his Greenwood day.?
? Where is Greenwood ? ? asked Wickham.
? Three miles up the river on the opposite side,?
said Elsie, ? but it is a seven-mile drive over the
crossing, and Clem isn?t fit to walk even if we
rowed him across the river.?
? We could pull three miles up the river,? said
Wickham. ? I am at your service, Miss Cameron.?
? Thank you,? said Elsie. ? I don?t know
what we should have done without you, Mr.
Wickham. Let us get rugs and things, Nora,
for we must start at once to be back before dark,
and mother will be so anxious when she comes
back.?
It was arranged that Chris should stay at home
and take care of the house. Elsie and Nora
helped Clem down to the boat, and Gilmore
walked behind, laden with rugs and pillows.
They made a comfortable couch for the boy at
the bottom of the roomy old punt, and rowed
steadily up the river, Gilmore taking two oars
and the girls each one.
Clem dozed for half-an-hour, and then his head
seemed clearer and he told them what had hap-
pened. How he had lighted the methylated


spirit in the little cup of the Primus stove, how
he thought there was not enough to draw up the
gas, and so added from the bottle to the burning
spirit, and how it exploded, burnt his face, and
threw burning spirit over the room and on to his
clothes.
? But I?ll soon be right again, though it does
hurt a bit,? he finished bravely. Then he dozed
again, till at last the boat ran on to the low bank
at Greenwood, and Wickham took the tired boy
on to his back and carried him up the slope to
Nurse Jones?s cottage.
CHAPTER V
nora?s mission
was too tired after his second
\ rv pUG 3 ) bandaging to be taken home that
evening, so Elsie stayed with him,
an( j Gilmore and Nora went back to
Niddry.
It was a beautiful evening, cool and fresh after
the hot day, the sun low, the shadows shimmering
on the water, and the fish, lazy no longer, kept
up a chorus of splashes round the boat.
? That is because we have no rod,? said Nora,
and then there was silence for a time.
Gilmore lay on Clem?s cushions, and the boat
drifted down the stream, just guided by Nora?s
oar.


? What made you think of missionary work,
Miss Nora ? ? asked Gilmore presently.
? I was at school in Sydney when I was quite
a child,? said Nora. ? Times were better then ;
it was before the long drought, and Elsie and I
were away together. It was a sermon in St.
James?s Church that set me thinking. It was
about the missions in the Islands, and how badly
help was wanted. I had a missionary-box after
that, and Elsie and I thought a good deal about
going to church and saying our prayers, and then,
only a week after we had been confirmed, father
had to take us away from school because there
was only enough money for Phil to be educated.
We went to the little public school here when we
came back, but of course there was no religious
teaching, and it was hard to keep up being
good.?
?Who is in charge of this district ??what clergy-
man, I mean ? ?
? Mr. Morgan at Port Weston, but he doesn?t
do much. He has never been to Niddry, but then
you see the parish is forty miles long and almost
as broad in places, and there are ever so many
parts more important than ours.?
? Do you never have service ? ?
? Once in three months at Boollambi. The
last time it rained and we could not get in, so
it is nearly five months since any of us were at
church.?
? How about the public school you went to;
are there many children ? ?
? I think there are about forty on the books ;
there are ten from one family I know. Clem
goes over sometimes still, but the school is across


the river, and they don?t often send the inspector
to us, so Clem rather shirks his work.?
? Forty children, and no service ever held
there !?and no Sunday-school, I suppose ? ?
? Oh, no.?
? Miss Nora,? said Gilmore after a little pause,
? I think you are very fortunate.?
Nora opened her eyes wide in surprise.
? What do you mean, Mr. Wickham ? ?
? I have known several people who wanted
to be missionaries, men and women ; and all,
especially the women, have had great difficulties
to overcome before the way was clear for them to
begin.?
? I am sure it won?t be easy for me. Father
wouldn?t hear of my going to be a missionary.
It is only a very distant hope.?
Gilmore was silent again. They were nearing
Niddry, and through a break in the gum-trees
the little group of houses on the opposite bank
of the river was visible in the fading light. He
would not say, ? There is your mission ! ? She
must find that out for herself when the right time
came.
The boat caught in a snag and swung round
towards the bank. Gilmore took the oar and
pushed off again towards the landing-place. They
tied up the boat and then walked through the
little wood and the lucerne field up towards the
house for the second time that day.
? It feels like six months since this morning,?
Nora said. ?So much has happened to-day, but
I still can?t see how I am very fortunate, Mr.
Wickham.?
Nora spent a longer time than usual over her


prayers that night. Chatterbox Elsie was away,
and her talk with Gilmore had set her thinking.
She made the daily petitions more earnestly than
usual, and then turned over the leaves of her
Prayer Book, as if seeking some word of counsel.
Perhaps the hymn for foreign missions might
help, but ? Greenland?s icy mountains ? did not
seem to apply to her, and she was closing the book
when a verse at the top of the same page caught
her eye ?
? O, use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when and where,
Until Thy Blessed Face I see :
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.?
She turned back and read through the beautiful
hymn for lay helpers once, twice, thrice, and the
third time it was transformed into a prayer.
When Nora rose in the freshness of early morning
the answer had come.
? I am not fit to be a real missionary,? the girl
murmured, looking out across the river. ? But
perhaps I could start a Sunday-school at George-
town. Mrs. Williams would lend me a room.
Why did I never think of it before ? ?
A week later the mail brought orders for Gil-
more Wickham to return to Sydney and be in
readiness to sail for New Guinea and begin his
work.
?It has come at last,? he said to Nora. ? And
now I am sorry not to have a few more weeks to
help you with your ? mission,? but you are sure
to get on well, don?t be afraid.?
? You will have to drive in to Port Weston,
Wickham,? said Phil, coming up. ? The drogher


left Boollambi yesterday to take cargo to Port for
the Sydney boat, so you can?t go in her. The
boat leaves about eight o?clock. I will drive you
in and stay the night.?
? May I come too, Phil ? ? Nora asked. ? I
want to see Mr. Morgan about the Sunday-school,
and it will be such a good opportunity. I can
stay with the Dillons ; they will put you up too.?
So Gilmore Wickham bade farewell to the
Camerons after dinner, and drove off in the sulky
between Nora and Phil. There is always room
for a third in a sulky, the driver?s seat not being
raised, as in an English dog-cart.
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, Elsie, and Chris came
out to bid him good-bye, Elsie giving Nora com-
missions for the store in Port Weston ?a com-
paratively fashionable place where ties and ribbons
could be procured. Tapes and buttons and faded
prints were the utmost to be found at the drapery
counter at the Boollambi general store.
Mrs. Cameron went back to the kitchen, and
was busy washing up with Elsie?s help, when a
voice called out to them from the river-side of
the house.
? Mother, mother, where are you ? ?
? It?s Clem,? said Elsie, running to meet him.
? Oh, poor Clem, still in your bandages ? ?
? Was it quite safe to come, dear ? ? his mother
asked. ?I am glad you called out, or I should
have had a great fright seeing you like that.?
? The doctor said I was all right, and I sha?n?t
be a bit scarred, mother. Only he said I ought
to wear these things,? touching his bandages,
? for a few days. I don?t mind them, but I
suppose they do make me look a bit funny.?


? Hullo, Clem ! ? said Chris, looking in at the
window. ? You do look a guy. Face all right,
old chap ? Look here, I?m just going out to
shoot paddymelons. Come along, and you shall
have my gun.?
To lend his gun was a piece of real generosity
on Christopher?s part, and Clem readily assented,
laughing at his mother?s anxious entreaties that
he would rest and be careful.
The small kangaroos called paddymelons did
endless harm to the com in the district. Three-
pence was paid for each pair of ears delivered
up at the Boollambi post-office, and Chris had
earned precisely one-and-ninepence since he had
possessed the gun. To follow his elder brother?s
example was the wish of Clem?s life, and great
was his happiness at being allowed to try.
The easiest way to shoot the paddymelons was
for one boy to drive them across the road, and
another to shoot while they were in the open. In
spite of several shots, Clem?s chance of earning
threepence seemed small, and, feeling rather
tired, he sat down on a log at the side of the road
and cooee-ed to Chris. Chris answered, and they
decided to go home.
Mrs. Cameron was watching anxiously for them
at the slip-rail by the road.
? That?s right,? she said, with a sigh of relief.
? I had such a fright. Hawking Bill came running
in half-an-hour ago without his pack, and said
that a fierce-looking man with a mask on his face,
and carrying a gun, demanded his pack, and he
threw it down and ran here for shelter. I wish
your father would come in, but it is something to
have you two safe.?


?Is Billy still here ? ? asked Chris. ? I'll go
and ask him some more about this. Come, Clem.?
? No,? said Clem; ?lam a bit tired and I?m
going to get Elsie to read to me. Come and tell
us about Billy when he has told you everything.
I wish we had met the man. Now I come to
think of it, Nurse told me only last night that a
kiddy at Greenwood had run home in a great
fright, with a story of a man with a mask on, near
the river. They did not seem to believe the story,
but perhaps it was the same man.?
? I can?t think why he should come to Niddry,?
said Elsie. ? There is no good place to hide, if
that is what he wants, and nothing to steal; he
won?t stay long. Mother, shall I make some
poofties for tea and give Billy the bread ; there
isn?t very much ? ?
Chris came in as she spoke and was beginning
to say something when he thought better of it,
and told them further particulars of Hawking
Bill?s adventures. The masked ruffian grew more
terrible with each relation of the story.
? Billy will never dare to go away again,? said
Elsie, turning her poofties in the pan. ? I will
get his tea now before ours, mother, if you will
watch my poofties.?
?? You needn?t worry, Elsie,? said Chris, calmly.
? King from Noroar rode past just now, and
Hawking Bill has gone back to Boollambi under
his protection. I would have said so before, only
it seemed a pity to stop you and disappoint poor
Clem by giving him only stale bread for his tea,
so I waited till the poofties were fizzling in the
pan.?
? Poor Clem indeed ! You?re a greedy, greedy


boy, and if it wasn?t for the fact that poofties
don?t keep nice, you shouldn?t have one for your
tea, but they are made now, so it can?t be helped.'?
CHAPTER VI
LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS
|S�RA was always glad that she was
r Phil and Wickham that day, for
F duringthe long drive Phil?s sympathies
were enlisted in ? Nora?s Mission,?
as Gilmore called it. Phil had shown
a disposition at first to call it Nora?s Folly, but
as his sister and his friend discussed possible
difficulties and ultimate success, he became inter-
ested, and made some good suggestions about the
choice of a room.
Half-way between Boollambi and Port Weston
they rested the horse for an hour. Phil built a
fire, and in a very few minutes water was boiling
in the billy-can Nora had thoughtfully provided,
and they had some tea.
They reached Port Weston before five o?clock?
a sleepy old town, very old for Australia, with
its convict-built church and parsonage, and here
and there a deserted tumble-down cottage of
English brick amongst the newer weatherboard
houses.
There are few towns in Australia where any
marks of the old convict days have been allowed


to remain. Here, even the gaol stood yet on
the crest of the hill above the sea, and Phil
suggested that they might look over it, as there
was still more than an hour of daylight. They
found the old police-sergeant, and asked him to
let them in.
It was a dreary, eerie building, full of cobwebs
and dust inside, and all the yards and open spaces
grown over with tall weeds. The sergeant knew
little of the convict days, and hurried them through
the cells without much comment, waving a branch
of hemlock before him to clear the cobwebs from
the doorways.
? What ancient history it seems ! ? said Phil,
? though only such a short time ago in reality.
All the gaol records have been destroyed, you
know, Wickham ; no one will ever be able to rake
up the old disgraceful stories.?
As they passed the last and dreariest corner
by the whipping-post, Gilmore touched Nora?s
arm. She followed his glance, and saw rising
out of a mass of dull green weed an exquisite
virgin lily, just one stem with bells of purest
white.
? Isn?t that typical of the new young Australia
rising out of a dark past ? ?he said. ? See, there
are five bells, one for each State.?
? Light in the darkness,? Nora said. ? I am
so glad I saw it; this dreadful place was making
me feel creepy,?
? Light in the darkness,? he repeated. ? That
is what your mission is to be, Miss Nora.?
? And yours too,? she said. ? Let us take it
as an omen of our work.?
She left them outside the gaol and went to the


parsonage, screwing up her courage to ask per-
mission to start the Georgetown school.
Mr. Morgan seemed very much surprised that
any one in the district should show any interest in
Church work, and was not sanguine as to her
success, but she might try, of course, if she wanted
to. He gave her an old mark-book half full of
names already, some hymn-books, and a few torn
pictures out of his own Sunday-school, and Nora,
her ardour rather damped, rejoined her brother
and Wickham.
? Never mind,? the latter said cheerfully.
? You will get on, and before you know where
you are there will be a church at Georgetown,
and Phil here acting as lay-reader. Now I must
go.? He held her hand, and looked at her earn-
estly. ? Miss Nora, I called this piece of work
your ? Mission,? and I think it is just now, but
when that is well started don?t forget the old
true missionary call. I will take care that you
don?t forget New Guinea,? he added with a smile.
? Good-bye.?
Nora longed to thank him for his help and
friendship, but something kept the words back.
She could only call out a laughing good wish for
the passage to Sydney as the little steamer left
the jetty.
Would they ever meet again ?
Phil and Nora stopped on their way through
Boollambi next day to see if there were any letters
for Niddry. The postmaster came out with two
or three papers in his hand, and looking very
important.
?You will surely not drive your sister home this
evening, young Cameron ? ? he said.


? Why not ? ? asked Phil. ? Has anything
happened ? ?
? What is it, Mr. Crampton ? ? cried Nora,
rather alarmed.
? Haven?t you heard at Niddry yet ? I told
young Wilton he ought to warn your father at
once.?
? We have just come in from Port,? Phil said.
? Why was my father to be warned ? ?
? A masked man with a gun was seen yesterday
between Niddry and Wilton?s place ; a desperate
fellow by all accounts, and the road is certainly
not fit for a lady.?
? Did Stanley see him ? ? asked Nora.
?No, Miss Cameron. Stanley Wilton had not
seen anything himself when he was in yesterday ;
he may have seen too much by now,? said the
little postmaster, shaking his head. ? I was
expecting him in to-day, and he has not
come.?
?Is anything known about this masked
ruffian ? ? Phil asked incredulously. ? I don?t
understand it. He can?t have risen up suddenly
at Niddry, and there has been nothing in the
papers. Who saw him ? ?
Mr. Crampton looked rather offended.
? Several people saw him, pointing his gun and
firing it too. You will be very rash, young man,
if you risk your sister?s life along the road to-day,?
and the postmaster retired into his office.
? It sounds like one of old Crampy?s scares,?
said Phil disrespectfully. ?You are not afraid,
are you, Nora ? ?
? Not a bit with you, Phil. And look, here is
Stan coming in ; he may be able to explain it.?


? What is this about a masked ruffian on the
King?s highway ? ? called out Phil.
? Well, I really don?t know,? said Stanley,
lifting his hat to Nora, and checking his horse.
? There was a great scare yesterday evening about
a masked man with a gun on the road near Niddry.
Billy the Hawker saw him yesterday, and was so
frightened he threw down his pack and took to his
heels. The postman says he saw something too.
He describes it as a figure with a gleaming white
face peering through the bush. He did not see
the gun, but heard shots a few minutes later.?
? Do you think there is anything in it ? ? asked
Phil.
? No,? said Stanley, ? not much. It must have
been something unusual to make Hawking Billy
run like that, but his pack was not touched.
Edwards brought it in this morning, having found
it as Billy left it on the road. Of course the story
has grown till no one thinks the road quite safe ;
they are sending a special constable from Port
Weston to make inquiries, I believe. The post-
man expects to be murdered at every turn of the
road, but I saw nothing either yesterday or to-
day.?
? Get your letters and come home with us, Stan,
if you have time,? said Nora.
? Thank you. Clem is back,? he added, riding
after them down the road a minute later. ?As
right as rain, they say. I saw your father yester-
day. Clem was out himself ; Mrs. Cameron is
delighted to find how little he is scarred. The
doctor said it was the good bandaging at first.?
? Yes,? said Nora. ? That was Mr. Wickham?s
work. We have just seen him off at Port Weston.?


? You must look out, Stan,? called out Phil,
flicking away the flies with his whip. ? Nora?s
going to start a Sunday-school, and she will be
running you in as a teacher before you know where
you are.?
? I should be more fit for a learner,? said
Stanley. ? You will find us ignorant enough, Miss
Nora, if you start teaching.?
? Oh, I am not going to teach you, Stan, only
the little children at Georgetown.?
? I don?t think it shows a good missionary
spirit to refuse a scholar,? said Phil gravely.
?Now Wickham has gone, I must keep you in
order.?
? Very well, Stan,? Nora said. ?If Phil says
I must have you, you shall come and sit at the
bottom of my class. Only, mind, I insist on
regular attendance.?
?You need not be afraid if Elsie is there!?
laughed Phil. ? Don?t blush, old fellow.?
?Is Miss Elsie going to help you ? ? Stanley
said presently to Nora.
?Oh, yes, but she says she will only teach
the girls, so it will have to be my class, you
see.?
Elsie was at the slip-rail watching for them
as they drove round the corner of the road.
? The boys came home to dinner to-day with
such horrible tales that mother and I began to feel
anxious. It isn?t true that Hawking Billy has
been murdered, is it ? ?
? No, Miss Elsie,? Stanley said, walking by
her side, and leading his horse. ? Nobody has
been hurt, and I think it is only a scare myself.
Of course the stories have grown as stories always


do, but I have been four times along the road now,
and have seen nothing.?
? Take care of yourself, Stan,? said Elsie
softly, ? or ?or ?whatever would Aunt Sarah
do ? ?
She ran into the house laughing, and teased
him all the rest of the evening, pretending that
he was afraid of the ? masked ruffian,? as they
all called the unknown apparition, but all her fun
could not blot out that soft ? take care of your-
self,? and Stanley went home that night feeling
very thankful that the real Aunt Sarah had not
sent for her niece.
CHAPTER VII
THE MASKED RUFFIAN
woke early the next morning.
A He U P looked at Chris, still
sound asleep by his side, and then at
gun hanging on the wall of their
little room.
He did want to have another try at those paddy-
melons. Chris would not like the gun to be taken
without leave, and his mother had said he was
not to go out shooting alone ; but that was some
time ago ; he had had practice now, and was to
be trusted.
He crept out of bed, dressed himself, took down
the gun, and slipped out of the room.


There was no one in the kitchen. Mrs. Cameron
had lighted the fire and gone over to the dairy
at the other side of the yard. Clem ran across
the yard, then through the paddock, and reached
the Boollambi road unobserved. He was in luck?s
way, for almost at once a small paddymelon
bounded across the road. Clem raised the gun
and shot it dead.
It was the boy?s first successful shot, and he
danced about in great delight. He hid the poor
furry body where he could find it again, and then
went further along the road, popping away with
the gun till all his ammunition was used up.
Then, remembering that there was such a thing
as breakfast, he started homewards.
It was dull work just walking along the road, so
he began to play ? Injun Warrior,? creeping along
for a bit in the open, then hiding behind a bush
and swooping suddenly across the road. In one
of these swoops he tripped over a stump and
dropped the gun. Before he recovered himself
a voice rang out sharply?
?lf you touch that gun, I fire ! ?
Clem looked up astounded. He had expressed
a wish to meet the masked ruffian when safe at
home with his mother and sisters, now he rather
wished he hadn?t. But the strange man, standing
a few yards away and covering Clem with a
revolver, was not masked. It was an altogether
unexpected development of Injun Warrior?a real
man and a real revolver. If only Chris were
there !
? Don?t touch that gun.?
? All right,? said Clem, ? I won?t touch the
gun.?


? Stand away from it, then.?
? All right,? said Clem, again moving back-
wards ; ? but you won?t take it away, will you ?
It doesn?t belong to me.?
The stranger possessed himself of the gun, saw
that it was not loaded, and slipped the revolver
into his pocket.
? What?s your name ? ? he said to Clem
? Clement Cameron.?
? Where do you come from ? ?
? I live at Niddry, my father?s place,? said
Clem, pointing down the road.
The stranger came closer, and before Clem
could move had slipped a pair of handcuffs on to
his wrists.
? That?s a fine story,? he said scornfully.
? You come along.?
? It?s quite true,? said Clem indignantly.
? Who else should I be ??and I can?t come with
you, for I want to go home to breakfast.?
? Want your breakfast, do you ? You?re a
cool customer !?so do I want my breakfast,? and
he started down the road to Boollambi, Clem
perforce following.
? Where are you taking me ? ? said Clem.
? You?ve no right to drag me along like this. I
haven?t done any harm.?
?No harm ? Well, perhaps you haven?t done
much, but you have frightened honest men with
that mask and gun of yours, and if your name
is really Cameron you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.?
? I haven?t got a mask on,? said Clem indig-
nantly. Then he put up his hand to his face
and remembered his bandages. ? Oh, you mean


these. I burnt my face, and the doctor put them
on ; and as to my gun, I was only shooting
paddymelons.?
The man stared at him, and then burst into a
loud guffaw.
?My word !? he said. ?My word ! but this is
red-hot. It would be just like those Bush-fellows
to be taken in like that ? (he forgot his own alarm
a few minutes before), ? Look here, young man,
have you been shooting much along here lately??
? Just yesterday and the day before. I was
at Greenwood having my burnt face looked after
before that.?
? Greenwood ? They said a child saw the
masked man there. This is a rare case ! Have
you seen anything of a masked man with a gun
round here ? ?
?No,? said Clem. ? I thought you must be
him, only you have no mask on. I?ve heard
plenty about him. Billy the Hawker has seen
him, and the postman, but Chris and I never
did.?
? Who is Chris ? ?
?My brother. That?s his gun.?
? How old are you ? ?
? Twelve.?
? And not big for your age either. My word ! ?
He took off the handcuffs, but kept hold of
Clem?s coat-sleeve.
? Look here, youngster, will you come with
me ? ?
? Where to ? ?
?To Boollambi; I?ll get you some breakfast
there, and these Bushies shall see their masked
ruffian. My word ! ?


He roared again with laughter, and Clem
plucked up courage to ask his name.
? Constable Smith from Port Weston ; they
sent me over to inquire into this mask business.
I?ll give you a ride, young Cameron, if you will
come along.?
? Is that your horse ? ? asked Clem, pointing
to one tied up a little way down the road.
? Yes ; I left it there when I was stalking the
masked robber that has been the terror of the
neighbourhood for days. My word ! ?
All of a sudden Clem comprehended the joke,
and burst out laughing too.
? You don?t mean it?s me they?ve been afraid
of,? he said. ? That is a good joke. Oh, do let
me go home and tell Chris,?
? Come with me first,? said the constable. ? I
want to show you to these cowards at Boollambi.
?Running away from a boy of twelve. My
word ! ?
Clem climbed up in front of the constable, and
in a short time they rode into Boollambi. The
report that the masked man had been captured
rapidly spread, and as Smith dismounted before
the hotel in the middle of the little township, a
crowd quickly gathered. Clem sat still on the
horse.
? There?s your masked robber, there?s the
murderous bushranger,? said Constable Smith
in great enjoyment. ? There?s the dangerous
fellow who routed William the Conqueror, I beg
his pardon, William the Hawker, in single combat.
Allow me to present to you, ladies and gents, Mr.
Clement Cameron of Niddry, a little boy of twelve,
who wears a bit of rag on his face to cover a burn,


and never shot so much as a wallaby in his
life.?
? I did,? cried Clem indignantly. ? I shot a
paddymelon this very morning.?
But his voice was drowned in a cheer, in which
all but Hawking Billy and the post officials joined.
In fact, Mr. Crampton, having some fine piece of
sarcasm to aim at the credulity of his assistant,
called him into the little office.
The hotel-keeper took Clem and the policeman
in to breakfast, and they were feasting on a very
tough beefsteak, when Clem saw his father ride
up to the door.
Clem had been missed at Niddry, and the gun
had also been missed, and Mrs. Cameron was in
great distress. Phil and Chris had gone off to
look for him, and the father rode into Boollambi.
Mr. Cameron heard the story of his son?s capture
on the road with a quiet smile, but Clem had a
severe lecture on going out with the gun.
He was really sorry when he saw his mother?s
anxious face.
? But I did shoot a paddymelon at last, mother,?
he said, pride getting the better of penitence, and,
her anxiety relieved, Mrs, Cameron forgave him.


CHAPTER VIII
NORA?S SUNDAY-SCHOOL
Sunday-school started well.
r She had promises from the parents
p hfteen children that the little ones
should be sent, quite enough to sit
comfortably in Mrs. Williams? little
front room at Georgetown, but when the day
came, no less than thirty turned up, coming in
from the farms near partly in curiosity to see
what was going on, and she had to migrate to a
bam outside, where the children sat on empty
corn-cobs, while Elsie and Nora did their best to
teach.
The class was critical; but those who could
read enjoyed the hymn-singing, and the little ones
were pleased with the pictures, which had been
carefully pasted on to newspaper to make them
a little more presentable.
Nora was proud and pleased. She planned out
the bam when the children had gone?how they
would roll big logs in for seats, and arrange the
classes, and, as they could not have Mrs. Williams?
piano, she would ask one of the girls at George-
town to bring her fiddle and play the hymns.
She was full of plans when she reached home,
and cared nothing for her brothers? chaff. If
she had failed, Chris had nobly determined to say
nothing, but a successful Nora was a fair target
for chaff to be aimed at.
? As easy as falling off a log,? he quoted, when
Nora described her scheme for providing seats.


? That must have been said of a Sunday-school
class, I shall come and peep through a chink in
the wall and watch the whole row of kiddies
go over.?
? If you come at all, Chris, you shall come right
in and keep the log steady.?
? Keep the log rolling ! Do you allow dancing,
Nora ? Nellie Gordon?s fiddle is sure to set me
going.?
? It didn?t at their dance then,? said Elsie.
? You were the stupidest lump in the room,
Chris.?
? I think you ought to begin at home, Nora,?
said Chris, sitting on the edge of the table with
folded hands, and looking very good. ?Itis a
disgrace that your poor little brother should be
so ignorant.?
?If I thought you would learn ? began
Nora.
? O-o-o ! ? screamed Chris, tumbling backwards
on the table. ? I beg your pardon, Teacher, but
it is so easy to fall off a log.?
Nora caught him by the collar, and made a
great pretence of pulling his hair.
? You impertinent boy, you shall be expelled,?
and she turned him out of the kitchen and shut
the door.
Next Sunday, rain, most welcome rain for the
tanks and farm, came down in torrents, and Mr.
Cameron forbade Nora to cross the river. The
following week only five scholars appeared, but
the next Sunday there were twelve, and after
that came a steady increase, and the children
seemed interested in their lessons.
A letter from Gilmore Wickham had brought


her encouragement, as well as news of his own
work. ? I shall not let you forget New Guinea,?
he had said. Nora?s pleasure at receiving a letter
from him was very great, and she wrote him a
glowing account of her ? Mission.?
The sixth Sunday brought Nora another
helper.
All Saturday Chris was quiet and moody, look-
ing at Nora sometimes, and half beginning to say
something, then stopping himself. On Sunday
morning he was decidedly uneasy, and hid himself
till dinner-time. Dinner came, and with it some
discussion about the numbers at the school that
afternoon.
Mr. Cameron told stories of the old days in
Edinburgh, when they had such quiet, dull Sun-
days ; long, long prayers ; long, long sermons, and
the Shorter Catechism to learn in the afternoon.
Chris fidgeted on his chair till at last an imploring
glance at his mother produced the required per-
mission to leave the table. Mr. Cameron might
have forgotten much of his religious training, but
he kept up some of the old Scotch discipline, and
his boys were not so unruly as the average
Australian youth.
Chris rushed out, and through the window they
saw him running across the paddock towards the
road.
? Chris is in a hurry,? said Elsie. ? I wonder
where he is off to ? ?do you know, Clem ? ?
? He hasn?t said a word to me all day,? said
Clem disconsolately. ? It?s so dull without him
that I believe I?ll come with you, Elsie.?
? Polite little boy,? said his sister. ? You
won?t find it very lively if you do come.?


But, as a matter of fact, Sunday-school promised
to be unpleasantly lively that afternoon.
When the two girls had crossed the river and
climbed the bank up to the bam where school
was held, they saw half-a-dozen lads of the larrikin
type, about fourteen to sixteen years of age,
lounging round the door, and smoking. Nora?s
heart sank. She knew perfectly well that if
these lads chose they could make things so un-
pleasant for Elsie and herself that the ?Mission ?
would have to be given up.
Elsie hesitated a moment.
? What are they going to do, Nora ? ? she said.
? Had we better go back ? ?
? No,? said Nora decidedly. ? The children
are there, and we must go on.?
She and Elsie walked into the bam and began
distributing hymn-books to the children gathered
there, a larger number than before. They sang
a hymn, Nora said prayers, and was reading the
roll-call when the lads outside lounged in.
? Got any room for us ? ? the biggest asked
mdely. ?We mean to come regularly, Miss
Nora Cameron, as long as you kepp this here
piety shop going.?
? And that won?t be long, I guess,? said another
boy in an audible aside.
Nora?s face was white, but she controlled her
voice, and it did not tremble as she said quietly
but very clearly?
? There is plenty of room. Throw away those
cigarettes outside, take off your hats, and come
and sit down there.?
? Suppose we won?t be told what to do, like
kids ? ?


? Then you must go away.?
? S?pose we won?t go away ? You can?t make
n- 55
No ; Nora could not make them go. She was
angry, very angry and disappointed and helpless ;
the children were beginning to whisper and giggle,
which made her angrier; the whole thing would be
a failure, and it took more effort than she had
ever known to send up a little wordless prayer for
help.
The answer came promptly.
Stanley Wilton, very red and hot, and rather
breathless, walked quietly in.
? You promised me a place in your class, Miss
Nora,? he said, taking off his hat. ? Where shall
I sit ? ?
? There, please,? said Nora, ? with this class
of big boys. Now, boys, throw away those cigar-
ettes, take off your hats, and sit down.?
The ringleader and another boy disappeared.
Four of the lads came back hatless and empty-
mouthed and sat down by Stanley. Elsie flashed
a grateful glance at their deliverer. Nora felt
a strong inclination to sit down and relieve her
feelings with a good cry, but the lesson had to be
given?no easy task with six feet two inches of
Stanley Wilton in front of her, and four big lads
besides.
She gathered the younger boys closer, and as
they settled themselves, tried to think of some-
thing suitable to say.
The lesson she had prepared, some hymn-verses
and a little story, was unsuitable now. What
could she do ? Gilmore Wickham would have
told them a story, he was a great believer in word-


pictures, and there flashed into her mind how
he had spoken of Bishop Patteson that morning
on the river. So she asked if they had heard of
Bishop Patteson, and the small boys promptly
answering ? No,? she told them very simply,
almost in Wickham?s words, of the Bishop?s work
and martyrdom.
It occurred to Elsie, listening over the heads of
the little girls repeating the Catechism, that her
sister was speaking very well. Stanley was listen-
ing intently, with an astonished feeling that he
had come to protect the girls, and after all he
was learning like a child.
Nora finished the story, they sang another
hymn, Stanley?s fine voice proving a great help,
and then the children went out.
One of the big boys stopped behind.
? Was that true, Miss Cameron ? ? he said.
? Quite true.?
?It did really happen ? I don't mean true
like you call the Bible stories, that nobody knows
whether they happened or not.?
? It is quite true about Bishop Patteson,? Nora
said. ?Just as true that he was killed thirty
years ago in Nukapu, as that Jesus Christ was
killed at Jerusalem nearly nineteen hundred years
ago. No truer, because nothing can be truer
than that.?
She gathered up her books and followed Elsie
out of the bam.
? Stan,? she said, ? get me a glass of water, I
f ee l so ? and Elsie had to steady her sister,
and help her to sit down outside till the water
came.
? You were good, Stan,? Nora said presently,


as the colour came back into her lips. ? How
did you know ? ?
? Chris fetched me,? he said, ? and I am coming
every Sunday, if I may, Miss Nora. I like your
stories.?
Chris told Nora all about it that night in the
dark with his arm round her neck.
He had joked about the Sunday-school with
the other boys, and Dave Kibble had said he was
going to put a stop to all that rot about prayer-
meetings and keeping Sunday, and he forced Chris
to promise not to tell his sisters, and it had weighed
on his mind all Saturday and Sunday morning, and
how it suddenly occurred to him to fetch Stan.
? I won?t laugh at you any more, Nora,? he
said. ? You are plucky.?
? A little laughing is good for me, you know,
Chris,? said Nora, as she kissed him good-night,
? and it 1 have any pluck it is Phil and you who
have taught it me.?
CHAPTER IX
THE BISHOP COMES TO CALL
IS-S WONDER which of these girls is my
new Church-worker. They both
seem ener getic and full of life.
Ah, if half the women in Australia
would put a little of the energy
into the spiritual side of the Church work, it would
spread by leaps and bounds.?


The Bishop laid his hand on the slip-rail above
the Niddry paddock and turned his gaze from
Elsie playing Purple Monkey in the yard with
Chris, to Nora galloping round and round the
paddock on the bare back of an unbroken colt.
It was winter-time at Niddry, which meant
cool sunny days, nights almost cold, and early
mornings only just escaping a frost ; the time to
enjoy a wild ride round the paddocks, or a game
of Purple Monkey at the pole in the yard, or
? iakki ? on one of the glorious moonlight nights.
No more lounging in the punt in the shade, for
after the great summer heat, Australians are
sensitive to the least winter cold, and Elsie was
even complaining of chilblains.
? Come and play Purple Monkey then,? Chris
had said. ? That will warm you. Do come,
Elsie. Nora?s having a ride on Timothy, and I
can?t find Clem.?
? He went to school this morning, as there
was nothing much to do,? said Elsie. ?\es,
I?ll come, Chris, if you will just help me put away
these bottles.?
The bottles full of fragrant marmalade were
safely stored on a shelf, and in a few minutes Elsie
and 'Chris were energetically beating a ball at-
tached by a long string to the Purple Monkey pole,
each trying to wind the string round the post, and
prevent the other from doing so.
With two well-matched players this is hard
work, and neither Elsie nor Chris, nor Nora who
was riding for the third time round the big pad-
dock, noticed the stranger watching them till
he put back the rail and walked down towards
the yard.


? There?s somebody coming,? called Chris, and
Elsie turning to look lost a stroke and the game,
and Chris triumphantly twirled round the ball
his way until it touched the post.
Elsie wondered who the funny-looking little man
with gaitered legs and big sun-helmet could be, and
then as he advanced towards them and spoke, she
came under the spell of eyes that seemed to look
through her, and a voice that brought back the
memory of the notes of the big organ in Sydney
years and she forgot his quaint appearance.
Miss Cameron ? ? he said, holding out his
hand. ? Miss Nora Cameron ? ?
?No,? said Elsie. ? Nora?s over there.?
Nora had also caught sight of the visitor, slipped
off Timothy?s back, and was trying to fasten up
? her curly hair with the aid of one pin, the others
being scattered over the field. She came forward
rather shyly at Elsie?s call, and the Bishop
introduced himself.
Mr. Morgan told me about your Sunday-
school work,? he said. ?He drove me here this
morning, and has gone on to baptize a child
further up the river. I am visiting all the
parishes m my diocese, and from what he told
me of Greenwood and Georgetown, I thought a
talk with you would be fruitful of good Will
you talk to me??
Just for a moment Nora wished herself and the
Sunday-schoo l at the bottom of the river, but as
the Bishop went on speaking, she was reassured,
it was only those who had done wrong who did
not care t� be looked at by those eyes?as Nora
told Elsie afterwards, they made her feel as if
she was m church.


She led the Bishop to a seat on the verandah,
while Elsie ran in to tell her mother, and mix
some scones for the eleven o clock lunch. It
seemed as if he knew all about the troubles and
difficulties at Georgetown, though no one had told
him before. Soon he knew all Nora s hopes and
longings, heard of Gilmore Wickham and his work,
of the scene when Stanley \\ dton had saved the
school, and Nora?s dream of a little wooden church
with Sunday services.
Anything seemed possible with that calm and
hopeful face beside her. He looks as though
he were saying his prayers,? Nora thought, and
indeed he was, for, as she afterwards learned, it
was a way he had to send up a prayer to God
before uttering a word of advice.
? I have sometimes thought my eldest brother
might read the service here when he is at home
from the University ; should I ask him ?
? Better tell him and others what is wanted,
my child, then pray to God about it and wait for
an offer to come. Work freely offered is worth
double what is asked for.?
Then he advised her about collecting money,
and promised help for the church-building, if such
became possible. He could not spare a Sunday
to come and preach to them yet, but if he could
get across the river he would address the public
school children that afternoon.
Then came Elsie with tea and scones, but the
Bishop insisted on going into the kitchen and
talking to Mrs. Cameron, and then exchanging
reminiscences of Edinburgh with Mr. Cameron,
whom Chris fetched in from the field. Stanley
Wilton came in while they were all having their


morning tea, and offered to take the Bishop across
the river and up to the Georgetown school, and
as Clem said when he came home that he would
? give up arithmetic class any day in the week to
listen to that old johnny with the gaiters,? the
class probably appreciated the Bishop?s visit.
CHAPTER X
elsie?s mystery
was some tremendous mystery
going on, known only to Elsie and
Stanley Wilton.
He came over more frequently than
ever, and they would go out together
in the punt, or walk up the hill where a big
Moreton Bay fig-tree marked the place where the
finest view in the neighbourhood was to be found.
They always had a book with them, which the
boys found hard to understand, for Elsie was
anything but studious as a rule, and Clem averred
that Stan read aloud all the time, and that they
hardly talked at all.
As a result of the Bishop?s visit, Mr. Morgan
came and held service one Sunday in Nora?s barn,
and the collection then made was to go towards
a new building, where the Sunday-school should
meet and services be held. Nora started her
school-children collecting, and a sum, small at
first, grew as the weeks went by.


Several people came forward to help now that
a real start was made. Phil borrowed a magic-
lantern, and showed it off at Greenwood and Bool-
lambi, as well as at Georgetown, giving the six-
pences charged for admission to Nora?s fund.
He only laughed when Nora asked him to read
the Church Service on the Sundays when he was
at home, and she gave up all hope of having more
frequent services than once in three months.
? Cheer up, Nora,? Elsie would say. ? Phil isn?t
the only man in Australia.?
? He is the only one I can think of to be our
lay-reader,? Nora said. ? I wish you and I could
do it, Elsie; it would be much easier than
teaching.?
? Thank you,? said Elsie. ? I would rather
not. The little ones in school are quite enough
for me, and I haven?t your talent for preaching.
Besides, a man is sure to turn up ; you just wait
and see,? and Elsie caught her sister round the
waist and waltzed about the room.
Nora had not forgotten the Bishop?s advice
when she asked Phil to ? turn preacher,? as he
expressed it ; she remembered it sufficiently to
pray for her ? Mission,? and help came from an
unexpected quarter.
Stanley Wilton came to the Sunday-school regu-
larly after his first eventful visit, but he would
not tackle a class.
? I don?t know enough, for one thing, Miss
Nora,? he said, ? and if I did I couldn?t pass it on
to those kiddies, but I will come and keep order
for you.?
Nora wanted him to be superintendent, but
for a long time he refused to open and close the


school. When at last he consented, Nora was
surprised to find how well he could read aloud,
and gladly gave up to him the weekly prayers.
Once, when she had a sore throat, he read a story
to the whole school.
? After this, Stan,? Elsie said, when the children
had gone, and Nora was gathering up hymn-books,
? I won?t have any more waiting. You read a
great deal better than Mr. Morgan already, and
you are just to tell Nora your plan.?
The big fellow blushed, and looked from puzzled
Nora to her sister.
? You tell it for me, Miss Elsie, please.?
? What is it ? ? asked Nora. Any sort of con-
fession sounded like announcing their engage-
ment, which Nora and her mother had been ex-
pecting for the past month, but they would hardly
begin like this. ?Do tell me, Stan.?
? Miss Elsie says,? he began slowly, ? that lay-
readers need not do anything except read plainly ;
they don?t have to preach or anything, just read
some one else?s sermon, and they don?t have to
be clergymen afterwards, so she thought???
? Now, Stan, you know you suggested it.?
? Well, then, I thought that ?
? That you would be one,? Nora cried. ? Oh,
Stan ! we shall be able to have service every
Sunday at last ! ?
? I don?t know if any one will come to hear me,?
Stanley said. ? But if it is any good I?ll just
do my best, Miss Nora, till some one else is ready
to take my place.?
? And you knew about it all the time, Elsie,?
Nora said, ? and never said a word, when it would
have been such a comfort.?


? I told you Phil was not the only man in
Australia,? Elsie said. ? I promised Stan not to
say anything about it until he was able to read
aloud well enough.?
? So that?s what the book was for that you took
out with you, and I never guessed. We shall
soon have our little church, Stan, and Elsie and
I will make you a surplice.?
Stanley Wilton came in to tea, and they talked
of nothing but the coming Church services and the
new lay-reader, mystifying Mr. and Mrs, Cameron
for a long time as to his identity.
Elsie strolled out into the paddock after tea,
and perhaps was not altogether surprised when
Stanley Wilton followed her. He did not speak
for a long time, and even Elsie was silent.
? Are you still longing for that English visit,
Miss Elsie ? ? he said at last.
?Oh,? said Elsie, ?of course it would be nice,
but I have not been thinking so much about it
lately.?
? Do you think the aunt really means to send
for you ? ?
Elsie shook her head.
?She might, but it is not very likely. You
see, she has two daughters of her own, and though
she used to talk of one of us going to be educated
with them, she never sent the money, and father
could not afford to send us home.?
Silence for a little while, until Stanley?s hand
moved slowly along the slip-rail by which they
stood, and covered Elsie?s.
? I love you,? he said simply. ? There is so
little to offer you, only a dairy-farm and a life
of work ! ?but I love you so, that, as Aunt Sarah


and England seem out of the question, I must
tell you. Elsie, will you marry me??
Only a dairy-farm and a life of work ! but Elsie
had been learning a good deal since her twenty-
first birthday, and she knew that with the little
farm and all the hard work would come a love
that any woman might be proud to gain. It was
a softened, sobered Elsie that said in a meek little
voice?
? I ?l don?t mind work, Stan.?
? That is one way of answering, dear,? he said
gladly, slipping his arm round her and drawing
her close. ? But it is not all I wanted. Please,
Elsie.?
? I love you,? very softly.
? And you will be my wife ? ?
? Yes, Stan.?
It was a very happy pair of lovers that Clem?s
call disturbed an hour later. Stanley had to ride
off at once with a promise to come the following
night, and happy Elsie went to bed.
Nora was asleep when Elsie reached the little
room the sisters shared.
? Wouldn?t you just wake up if you knew what
I had to tell ? ? Elsie whispered. ? Now you won?t
know till to-morrow ?to-morrow ! when Stan will
come again and every one will know. I wonder,
I wonder when we shall be married, and what
sort of engagement-ring I shall have. Oh,
there are so many things to wonder about ! Nora,
it was stupid of you to go to sleep on this night
of nights.?
She let down her pretty fluffy hair and moved
the lamp so that the light fell on her face and its
reflection in the glass.


? Stan says you are beautiful,? she said, nodding
at the looking-glass face. ? I wonder if you are
really, or is it only his flattery ? ?not that he
would say it if he did not mean it, he is far too
good and true. Oh, Elsie, you are a very lucky
girl.?
She bent forward and kissed the looking-glass
lips, and then, though Elsie had never read As
You Like It, and thought Shakespeare ? a dull
book,? she knelt down before the little dressing-
table and thanked Heaven for a good man?s love.
CHAPTER XI
aunt sarah?s letter
was up long before Elsie that
Monda y morning, and by the time
klra&r the latter ca me down, the clothes,
which had been soaking since Satur-
day, were ready to hang out on the
lines in the yard.
In answer to a call from her mother, Elsie
began to get ready for breakfast, putting on the
porridge to boil, and setting the table. There
was no time for confidences, and Mrs. Cameron
and Nora were too busy to notice the dimples
about Elsie?s mouth, which were quite irrepressible
this morning.
Mr. Cameron and the boys came in at Elsie?s
call to wash their hands and slip on their coats
before coming to the table.


? Hullo,? said Chris, ? I must have forgotten
these,? and he pulled two or three letters out of
his pocket. ? Ridgway gave them to me on
Saturday morning, and they have just stayed
here snug and warm since then.?
? You careless boy !?hand them over.?
? There isn?t anything for you, only for dad
and mother. An English letter for you, mum ;
mail just in ! ?
Mrs. Cameron laid the letter by her plate while
she poured out the tea, and did not open it till
the porridge-plates were emptied and chunks
of bread-and-honey rapidly disappearing. She
read a few words and then looked up.
? Why, Elsie,? she said ; ?it has come at
last !?just when you had given up hope. Listen
to Aunt Sarah?s letter.
? * My dear Elizabeth,
? If you can spare me one of your girls
for twelve months or so I shall be very glad to
have her, and show her what English life is
like with my own daughters. As Robert has
hinted that your finances are not in a satis-
factory state, I enclose a cheque for �75 to pay
Elsie?s (for I suppose it will be Elsie) fare second-
class in the mail-steamer, and to allow a small
sum towards suitable clothing.?
? How good of Aunt Sarah, Elsie ! It has often
worried me to think that you would not have nice
things like her girls if you went home, and this
will make it all right. You will be able to buy
a travelling-trunk in Sydney?? and practical
Mrs. Cameron began to plan out the spending of
the seventy-five pounds.


? You must go to Edinburgh,? said Mr. Came-
ron, ? and see your grandfather?s portrait in the
Parliament House, Elsie ; I hope the boys will
go too, some day.?
? This boy would like to ! You are lucky,
Elsie,? said Chris. ? Mother, may I go now ?
Ridgway is bringing his new gun to shoot paddy-
melons, and I was to meet him on the road.
Don?t start for England before I come back,
Elsie.?
? I say,? said Clem, ? we?ll miss you a lot,
Elsie. Won?t we, Nora ? ?
? You will see all those lovely places on the way,
Elsie. You must go by the Orient Line, and
then you will see Naples. Oh, it will be just
lovely?only?Elsie ? then Nora stopped.
She was going to say, ? How about Stanley
Wilton ? ? And Elsie, who a few months ago
would have been wild with excitement at the
prospect of her much-longed-for visit to England,
sat silent with a troubled look in her eyes, her
colour coming and going.
Nora came round the table and kissed her
sister.
? We shall miss you sadly, as Clem says, but
after all you won?t be gone very long.?
? Come along, Nora, and finish the clothes,?
called the mother as she went back to the laundry.
Mr. Cameron and Clem went out to work too,
and Elsie was left alone. She sat still at the table
for a moment thinking.
? I won?t say anything till Stan comes,? she
said to herself at last ; her face softened and
glowed as she thought of her lover. ?He will
be here to-night, and then ?then they shall know


that I?m not going to England. I?m going to
marry Stan. ? Mrs. Stanley Wilton ? ? ?with a
rosy blush. ? Oh, Elsie, he is worth far more
than all the sights of England.?
She cleared away the breakfast-things with a
dancing step, and then put down the irons ready
for the snowy clothes Nora was taking down from
the line. She only laughed while her mother and
Nora made plans for her journey, for the under-
linen that must be made, and how many dresses
Elsie ought to have.
? What would you like, Nora, if you were
going ? ? Elsie asked. ? Plain things, I suppose,
and you always look so nice in them. After all,
why shouldn?t you go ? ?you are only a year
younger than I.?
Nora only laughed and shook her head.
? Why, Elsie, of course it must be you to go, and
you must be good and write us real long letters.?
? That is another thing you can do better than
I, Nora ; it really must be you to go.?
Chris and young Ridgway made their way
westward with the new gun, and happening near
Stanley Wilton?s little farm near mid-day, were
glad to go in and share his billy-tea, meat, and
damper.
Stanley was in great spirits, and gave them
some cartridges for the new gun. He also got
out a tin of jam to give a flavour to the damper,
and they had quite a merry feast, Stan telling
tales of his early shooting experiences.
? I shall be over at Niddry this evening,? he
called out to Chris as the boys went away.
Chris came back and leant on the fence as
Stanley cut some lucerne for the cows.


? By the way, Stan,? he called out, ? you know
how keen Elsie always was about going home,
and how we chaffed her about it ? Well, she
is really to go now. The letter came from Aunt
Sally this morning, with money for her passage,
so it is all fixed up. Good-bye.?
Stanley Wilton stood upright and leaned on his
scythe. Elsie going to England ! The wish of
her life to be fulfilled at last. How about last
night, their talk, and her promise ? He would not
hold her to it, of course. She was so young and
full of life ; this visit home would mean more to
her than to most girls ; he could not wonder at
her deciding to go when the invitation came.
But to lose her just when she had promised to be
his?oh, it was hard !
He started mowing again, until, with an ex-
clamation at his own folly, he found that he had
cut four times as much as was wanted. He
gathered up an armful of the lucerne, threw it
over the rail, and then stood watching the awk-
ward plunging and jumping of the cattle in their
delight at the sight of the fresh green feed.
There was a feeling in Stanley?s heart that he
could not analyze ; as though something had died
within him ; as if this life, this dairy-farming
life, were over and done with, and that he must
make a new start. Thoughts of Elsie were so
closely interwoven with his plans for the future,
that to put her out of them necessitated a new
outlook altogether.
That she might go to England and come back
never occurred to him, and through the dull
aching of his heart he thought first how he could
spare her pain and difficulty. He would go awa}^


himself; that would be best. His mind began
to work quickly, and he evolved a plan.
He went into the cottage and looked up the
last number of the Sydney Herald. Yes, there
was the notice he wanted, and this day, Monday,
was the last for volunteers to send in their applica-
tion for service in South Africa. He would ride
into Boollambi at once and telegraph his name
and qualifications, and if his application was ac-
cepted he would go to Sydney for further tests.
Jack Ridgway, the elder brother of Chris?s friend,
would look after things for a day or two, or per-
haps take the farm off his hands if he went away.
There would be no time to say good-bye to
the Camerons, as the contingent was leaving
almost at once. Elsie would be saved the trouble
of taking back her promise. She would under-
stand.
He saw to the wants of his stock, and then rode
off towards Boollambi; not past Niddry, the
shorter way, but round by the Ridgways? to see
if Jack was in.
Mrs. Ridgway brought him a cup of tea as he
sat on his horse by the gate talking to Jack.
? I have often wondered that you did not go
before,? she said, as Jack told her of Stanley?s
plans. ? Being all alone without ties, it seems
natural, and it will do Jack a world of good to
have some responsible work for a bit.?
? They may not accept me,? Stanley said.
? Perhaps they won?t, Mr. Wilton,? said Mrs.
Ridgway, smiling, ? if they find a taller man who
can ride and shoot as well as you do. Good luck
to you.?


CHAPTER XII
ELSIE WAITS FOR HER LOVER
should keep your pretty things
now till you go home,? Mrs. Came-
r>p3 ron sa id> as Elsie came in to tea
j n a pretty blue muslin blouse that
was usually kept for fine Sundays.
? This is my home,? said Elsie decidedly. ? Be-
sides, mum dear, I put this on to celebrate the
occasion,? though Elsie did not mean the arrival
of the English letter.
Tea began, and tea continued amid a chorus
of queries and suppositions about Elsie?s coming
journey, but no Stanley Wilton bowed his head
beneath the low doorway. Seven o?clock, eight
o?clock, nine o?clock, ten ?still no Stanley Wilton
came, and Elsie was obliged to go to bed at last,
tired and dispirited, to cry herself to sleep.
Nora did not wake, weary as she always was
on Monday night after the family washing was
done. She had been puzzled by Elsie?s reception
of the news from England, and she was still more
puzzled by the traces of tears on the face at her
side when she woke in the morning, and once more
she dressed herself quietly without disturbing her
sister, and slipped out of the room to take up a
double share of the daily work.
When Elsie appeared at last she was cross and
irritable, poor child, and snapped Chris up so
sharply that he said he would be very glad when
she had gone away, whereat poor Elsie began to
cry, and ran away to her room again.


? The poor lassie is a bit over-excited,? Mr.
Cameron said. ?Be gentle with her, my boy ;
you are not always free from tantrums yourself.?
Nora had to be out that afternoon attending
the first committee meeting about the building
of a church at Georgetown, which began at last to
look possible.
Nora hoped to see Stanley Wilton there, and be
able to bring him back to tea with her. She could
not help suspecting that it was somehow the
thought of leaving him that was depressing Elsie.
But no Stanley came to the meeting, and Nora
forgot to be disappointed in her delight at finding
the farmers, mostly represented by their wives,
in a comparatively generous frame of mind, and
it seemed likely that the building might begin
in the following year.
It would be just a small plain weather-board
church with a corrugated iron roof, but it would
serve the purpose well. It was decided to have
concerts with shilling and sixpenny tickets, to have
a little sale of work, and if possible to get up a
dance at one of the houses, on the understanding
that the hat would be sent round for the church
in the middle of the evening when refreshments
were served.
Nora, who was acting as secretary to the com-
mittee, was commissioned to write to Mr. Morgan
the decision that had been made, and she made
up a letter to the good Bishop too, as she waited
by the river-side for Clem, who would row her
over.
She had to tell him about the new lay-reader
too. How pleased he would be to find their
prospects so bright!


Elsie was busy making scones when Nora came
home with the history of the successful meeting.
It was a great relief to have something to discuss
that was not her visit to England, though of course
that topic of conversation came up everywhere.
? if they do begin at once, you see, Elsie,
Nora said, ? we might have the sale before you
go away ; we shall want you to be there then,
and at the concerts too. It will be very hard
to spare you, dear,? she added, stroking the fair
fluffy hair. . ~ . . .
? Don?t, Nora, oh, don?t!? Elsie said in a choky
voice. ? I have been horrid to-day, but please
don?t take any notice.?
? Here come the boys,? said Nora. ? Tea
oh ! Stan was not at the meeting, Elsie ; I
was so disappointed. He must have been too
busy to come. Perhaps he will be here this
evening,? she added, as Elsie made no answer.
They were all sitting at tea when a step sounded
on the verandah outside, and Elsie s heart leaped
with a thrill of joy. But it was only Jack Ridg-
way who appeared in the doorway, and came in
at Mrs. Cameron?s invitation.
?No, I don?t want tea, thank you, Mrs.
Cameron. I have had mine already?well, just
a cup ; that never comes amiss. I wanted to
see you, Mr. Cameron, about one of Wilton s
cows. Could you possibly ride over and have a
look at her before night ? She seems to be very
ill, and it fairly puzzles me what to do with her.
I shouldn?t like to lose one while he is away.?
? Wilton away ? Why, where?s he gone ? ?
? Rode into Port Weston this morning to catch
the Sydney boat. He has volunteered for South


Africa, and has gone to Sydney to have his riding
and shooting tested, before they accept him. I
thought you would have known, seeing how often
he is over here.?
There were exclamations of surprise from all
the Camerons except Elsie, who sat still and quiet
playing with a piece of bread. Like Stan himself?
she felt that something died within her as Ridv-
way s news came out. Mrs. Cameron glanced
at her. Had Elsie anything to do with this
sudden resolution ? she wondered. Perhaps she
ad refused to marry the boy on Sunday night
and as the English invitation had come, it was
best. Before Elsie?s embarrassment could b-
noticed, she rose from the table.
Well, if you won?t take any more tea, Mr
Ridgway, we will clear the table, and you and
vij lll f 6 ' Can talk thln g s ov er outside. Elsie

a forlorn little figure sobbing her heart out on the
hand 6 -nth d �T be l? de her sister and laid a
< gently on her shoulder, not speaking for
a few minutes, and then somehow the position
kneeling by the bed, made her think of her prayers?
and she offered a little petition for poo? ElsS


The sobs quieted, and Elsie turned round and
pulled the sister?s hand against her hot cheek.
? He asked me to marry him on Sunday night,
Nora, and I said I would. I meant to tell you
then, but you were asleep, and now he has gone
away without a word. , , ,
? poor old girl! ? Nora said softly. I thought
there was something wrong. There must be some
reason for Stan to do that,? she added presently.
? What could it have been ? ?
? I don?t know. He was to come on Monday
night to tell father, and I thought how surprised
you would all be, and then he never came
? There must have been some reason, Could
he have heard about your letter from Aunt Sarah,
and wanted to leave you free to go ? ?
?Nora, he must have arranged with Jac�
Ridgway the very morning after he asked me to
be his wife. He could not have heard before then,
and besides, it was so cruel to go without saying
one word.? .
? I wonder, I wonder ; stay here a minute,
Elsie, I?ll come back.?
7 _ _ ?�
? Don?t tell any one.?
? Of course not.?
Elsie lay back again quietly now ; telling Nora
had comforted her a little. Nora had a capable
way of taking things in hand when they went
wrong that made one hopeful. _
The two boys were coming in after feeding
the calves, and talking of Stanley.
? i wish I had been old enough to go, Chris
said. ? Wouldn?t I like to get a good old shot
at those Boers ! ? ,
?It was funny going off like that, said Clem.


? Why, he was here on Sunday, and never said
a word.?
? And I saw him on Monday morning,? said
Chris. ?He was cutting lucerne, and gave Ridg-
way and me some lunch.?
The boys had reached Nora now, and she heard
Chris?s last remark.
? Are you sure he said nothing about going,
Chris ? What were you talking about ? ?
? Oh, all sorts of things. Guns chiefly?he
gave us some cartridges?and Elsie?s going to
England. I remember going back to tell him
that.?
? You told him she was going ? ?
? Yes. What?s the matter, Nora ? ?
? Oh, nothing, except that I should like to box
your ears, Chris,? and Nora walked away.
This from his peaceable sister was rather a sur-
prise for Chris, but Nora took no notice of his call
after her. She went back to Elsie and shut the
door.
? I knew there must have been a reason, dear,
and there is. Chris saw Stan on Monday morning,
and told him that you were going to England,?
Elsie sat up and put back her hair.
? Do you really think so, Nora ? ?
? It seems the only way to explain.?
? Then he went off without saying a word, after
?after Sunday night. I said I would marry him,
Nora. Did he think I would break my word ?
If that was the way he loved me, I don?t care if
he has gone. No, Nora, don?t try to make
excuses for him ; it was shameful?unkind.?
The tears came again, but Elsie checked them
resolutely.


? Are my eyes very red, Nora ? I wish I had
not cried ; it is much easier to be angry than
sorry. Let us go back to the sitting-room.?
? I believe Stan will write and explain,? Nora
began, but Elsie was gone before she could finish
the sentence.
Mrs. Cameron was sewing by the table. Elsie
took up some of the boys? socks and began
darning them diligently.
?You must write to-morrow for patterns from
Sydney,? the mother said. ?It will be much
better to send for everything than go to Port
Weston. And when you go away, Elsie, I have
been thinking Nora had better go with you to
Sydney, and then you two can stay there for a few
days, getting all you want for the voyage, and
Nora come back alone.?
? Mother,? said Elsie.
? Yes, dear ? ?
? Don?t you think it would be much better for
Nora to go instead of me ? ?
? Nora go ! ?why, what are you thinking of,
child ? You are the elder and have first choice.?
? Yes, I know I could go, but, mummy, though
it would be nice in a way for me, it would be ten
times better for Nora. She will know all about
the old places, and she has read such a lot; and
though I grumble sometimes, mum dear, I do
love my home, and ?and I don?t want to go
away. Nora ought to be the one.?
Mrs. Cameron put down her work and drew the
girl close up to her.
? What is it, dear ? ? then, as no answer came,
? Is it anything to do with Stanley Wilton ? ?
? Mother, if some one did a thing you think he


ought not to have done, would it make things
better if you went and did it too ? ?
Mrs. Cameron thought over this rather enig-
matic question for a moment, and then gave it up.
?You must do what is right, Elsie. Never
mind about other people and their doings.?
? Then Nora will go to England,? Elsie said.
CHAPTER XIII
ELSIE HAS HER OWN WAY
UT I can?t go, you know I can?t,
Elsie ; it is all nonsense.?
The task of persuading Nora to
fall in with her plan was no easy one,
but Elsie had a fund of obstinacy
at the back of her nature, and it was now called
into use.
? Well, I am not going.?
? But, Elsie ?
?It is no use, Nora. I have quite made up
my mind. Oh, I know it would be easier in a
way now that Stan has gone, but he ought not to
have gone, so I shall stay, and you must be the
one to accept Aunt Sarah?s invitation.?
? But there is all the work and the school and
the church.?
? Well, I can?t preach for you, and I can?t
teach like you, Nora, but the Smiths and the
Milsoms will take up the Sunday-school now, and
perhaps some one will turn up to be lay-reader.?


? If I do go,? Nora said at last, ? it can?t be just
yet, Elsie. I want to see the church started,
and ?oh, I can?t go.?
Elsie slipped her arm round her sister?s neck.
? Don?t make things harder for me, Nora.
Please say you will go.?
?It seems so selfish, Elsie. What can I say to
Aunt Sarah when she asks me why I came and not
you ? She knows how you have always been look-
ing forward to your English visit.?
? Well, I don?t quite know,? said Elsie, with
a little smile, ?but they always say one has nothing
to do on board ship, so you will have plenty of
time between, say Fremantle and Colombo, to
think out a suitable reply. Any way you will
be there, you see, and that will be the best answer,
the unanswerable argument. Or you can say,
? Elsie is rather a stupid little thing, Aunt Sarah,
and did not think she would appreciate your
society.? Why, Nora, there are fifty thousand
things to be said.?
The task of convincing her mother and sister
took Elsie several days, and one mail without a
letter acknowledging the letter and cheque. Next
week, however, Mrs. Cameron wrote a grateful
acceptance for Nora, not for Elsie, adding in
explanation that between themselves she thought
a quite suitable and desirable attachment was
the reason of Elsie?s refusal, but would Aunt
Sarah avoid mentioning the matter to Nora or
her own girls, as it was always better not to
discuss such affairs before they became public.
Stanley Wilton?s name appeared that week in
the Sydney Herald , amongst those who were leav-
ing for South Africa, and Elsie tried to harden her


heart against him. He would come back, she
said to herself, and would find her there waiting
for an explanation of his extraordinary conduct,
which he certainly could not justify. She would
be very calm and distant, and perhaps he would
then suffer a little of the pain she was feeling now.
Arguments like this kept her up fairly well
until she saw the cable mentioning the landing
of Stanley Wilton?s regiment at Port Elizabeth,
and its immediate despatch for the front. One
could not think in a dignified way of a wounded
Stan, or a Stan shot through the heart, and
lying with upturned face on the veldt. It was
well for Elsie that she had the bustle of prepara-
tion for Nora?s departure to occupy her mind to
some extent.
She clung very closely to her sister in those
last few days, and was pathetically anxious to
part with every scrap of ribbon or lace, every
trinket treasured in ? the old days,? as she called
them to herself.
Nora was very reluctant to spend money on
herself, and Mrs. Cameron had to insist on sending
for patterns and cutting out new garments of
every kind, which Elsie made up in the sewing-
machine, while Nora devoted herself to mending
up the boys? clothes, energetically cleaning the
house, and doing her utmost to leave things
comfortable at home when she went away.
Elsie was to go with Nora to Sydney to make
the final purchases, and to see her sister off. No
one was very happy on the parting day.
? I know now,? Clem said, ? why Stan did not
come to say good-bye. Good-byes are just horrid.
Though you will be back soon, won?t you, Nora ? ?


?As soon as I can, Clem,? she said. ? Take
care of mother.?
Then with one last hug, the mother let her chick
leave the nest ?the first to go ; and Nora climbed
up between Elsie and her father in the buggy.
It was possible to join the steamer at 800 -
Iambi, but going down the river gathering cargo
here and there was a tedious affair, and Mr.
Cameron had decided to drive the girls all the
way to Port Weston. The boat left almost
directly after they reached the town, so there
was little time for final good-byes.
Nora thought of her last visit to the jetty when
Gilmore Wickham went away. What a crowd
of events had come into her life since then ! She
would write and tell him of her visit to England;
he had begged for letters when he last wrote,
though warning her that answers might not be
forthcoming, as he was going on rather a dangerous
mission inland.
Nora?s day-dream was interrupted by a rather
unsteady voice at her side.
? Nora, I?m not at all happy, and I?m very glad
you are going to cross the sea instead of me ! ?
It was rather rough all the way to Sydney, and
the little steamer bobbed up and down to a very
trying extent. Poor Elsie was very ill, but Nora,
always a good sailor, enjoyed the cool rush of air
and the spray in her face.
They had two days in Sydney to make their
purchases before the Oroya sailed, and Elsie?s
spirits went up a little with the unusual excite-
ment of having some money to spend in the shops,
not only the milder joy of feasting her eyes on the
beauties of feminine adornment in the windows.


Phil took them to the theatre one evening. His
college dance was to be in the following week,
and the friends the girls were staying with gladly
keeping Elsie for a long visit if she would stay,
Nora spent the money that was to buy her an
extra pair of boots, on muslin and ribbon for
Elsie?s ball dress, leaving the parcel as a surprise
for her sister to find after the ship had sailed.
She bought presents, too, for the boys, and
the good mother who was now doing all the work
at home, so there was not much left of Aunt
Sarah?s cheque by noon on Saturday when the
? All on shore ? bell sounded, and Elsie gave her
sister one long hug, and then fled down the gang-
way without one backward look.
? Take care of her, Phil, and give her a good
time,? Nora said.
? All right,? he said, giving Nora a brotherly
kiss. ? I can?t understand why she did not go,
though. Lucky for you, Nora. Good-bye.?
CHAPTER XIV
BAD NEWS
were pleasant people on board
Oroya, travelling in the second-
class saloon with Nora, and she
thoroughly enjoyed the first ten
days, writing home from Melbourne,
Adelaide and Fremantle to tell her experiences
to those left behind.


The sunsets in the western sea were a revelation
of colour and glory to the imaginative girl, and
all the world seemed very bright and beautiful
and full of kindness. She was sitting in her deck
chair watching the sunset just after the Oroya
steamed away from Fremantle, when an oldish
man, with whom she had often exchanged greet-
ings, gave her a copy of the Perth Herald.
Nora did not want a newspaper just then,
it seemed rather to spoil the romance of the
evening, but just to please Mr. Norman she
glanced down the cable news.
There was the War, of course, in the most
prominent place ; not much fresh news. Ah, but
what was this in the Second Edition column ?
? Trooper Stanley Wilton, slightly wounded in
the left arm after showing conspicuous bravery.?
Nora gave a little exclamation.
? I am glad to have seen this, Mr. Norman,?
she said. ? Stanley Wilton owns the farm next
to my father?s, and of course we know him well.
Slightly wounded in the left arm does not sound
very bad.?
? His sweetheart will be proud of him,? said
Mr. Norman, in rather a joking way. ? No, thank
you, Miss Cameron, I don?t want the paper again.
You may find some more news.?
He moved away, and Nora, after another look
at the sky, now pink and peaceful, the brighter
gold fading fast, glanced down again at the news-
paper.
?NEW GUINEA MURDERS.
?There are rumours of disturbances in New
Guinea.


? Later.
? G. Wickham, a missionary, has been murdered.
? (Mr. Wickham was educated at the King s
School, Parramatta, and at Sydney University.
He only joined the New Guinea mission last year. )
The paper dropped out of Nora?s hand, and
she looked up at the sky again. Where was the
beautiful light ? All the sky was grey, and a
black bank of cloud threatened ram on the
morrow. , . , ,
Dreary and dark, and oh ! how lonely !
It was Nora?s first great trouble, and she sat
there stunned. Gilmore dead murdered mar-
tyred t?she could not realize it. Reading about
people being killed long ago or even m the w ar
seemed so different, but Gilmore, whose hand
she had touched, whose penetrating look was so
fixed in her memory ! Where was that firm touch
that wonderful look ? The eyes and hand
might be buried, or worse ?Nora shuddered
but the look and touch
? Aren?t you feeling well, Miss Cameron ? You
have been so good a sailor surely you
are not thinking of missing a meal ? ?
It was one of her fellow-passengers, and Nora
started up. , . ,
?Oh no, Mr. Phillips,? she said. That would
not do at all, would it ? Is it nearly tea-time ?
? The bell went just now. I was going down
when I noticed that you did not move. Sure
you are all right, Miss Cameron ? as they came
into the light and he saw her white face.
? Oh, yes,? said Nora. ? I was watching the
sunset.?
Her voice sounded strangely to herself, and


her companion looked at her curiously again, but
she took her place at the table as usual, and
managed to get through the meal without attract-
ing any more attention.
One of the passengers noticed how pale she
was, and commented on the fact to her neigh-
bour, Mr. Norman, who, although he had noticed
nothing, was always ready for a bit of gossip.
? No doubt, no doubt, poor girl,? he said.
? Is anything wrong ? ? Mrs. Ormerod asked.
? Sh e has had bad news, I am afraid,? he said,
shaking his head.
? Poor child! ? with a pitying look at Nora,
who was trying to respond with a smile to one
of the fourth officer?s little jokes. ?What was
it ? ?
? Lover wounded in the war,? Mr. Norman
said. ? Only one of many suffering the same
anxiety, of course.?
Rather pleased at having a piece of news to
retail, Mr. Norman took care that every one in
the second saloon soon knew that Nora was griev-
ing over a lover wounded in South Africa. Some,
indeed, had heard on good authority that he had
been shot dead, so her white face and heavy eyes
were accounted for, and she was treated with
especial consideration and left alone when she
did not want to join in the sports and games going
on amongst the passengers.
Mrs. Ormerod had much of her time taken up
in attending on an irritable invalid husband, and
it was not until the Oroya was nearing Colombo
that she had an opportunity of offering sympathy.
Nora had liked her face from the first, and was
pleased when the older woman sat down beside


her one evening and began to talk of the beauty
of Ceylon and other places she had seen.
? x have never travelled before,? Nora told her.
? Only just to Sydney and back to my home on
the Weston River, so you can think what a treat
it will be to see one of those lovely places you were
Sp t?You �Uve on the Weston River ? ? Mrs.
Ormerod asked. ? I have not been so far north
in New South Wales myself, but my husband has
so I know it well through his description. Tell
me about your home.?
And Nora told. Somehow it was easy to speak
of home, even of little things that it would have
seemed silly to mention to any one else, and soon
Mrs Ormerod knew all about Niddry and the boys,
and a good deal about the Sunday-school and
Church work. It was almost as easy to talk to
her as to the Bishop. ..
? Forgive my asking,? Mrs. Ormerod said
presently, ? but some one told me that you had
heard bad news from South Africa just before
you started. Have you a brother there ?
? No,? said Nora. ? I have a friend who hves
on the very next farm to Niddry there now, but
good news rather than bad came about him. He
was slightly wounded, it is true, but such nice
things were said about his conduct that I felt
quite proud of him. ?
? He can?t be her lover,? thought Mrs. Ormerod,
? or she would not speak of him like that.
? x am very glad to hear that,? she said aloud.
? Sometimes'l have thought you were in trouble,
and have longed to help and comfort you there
was such a pitiful look in those great dark eyes


of yours. Forgive me for seeming to interfere,
but I had a daughter once,? she paused a moment,
? and it made me want to help you.?
? I was rather sad,? Nora said in a low voice,
? I heard of the death of a friend when we were
at Fremantle, and?and ?
? I see,? said Mrs. Ormerod quietly.
She did not look at Nora, but away over the
sea to the sky-line?or beyond.
? Of course one knows all the Bible helps and
comforts,? Nora went on, ? but it seems so
different when it is one?s own friend, and one?s
own trouble.?
? I know,? said Mrs. Ormerod, the least shadow
of a smile in her face rather than on her lips.
? But it takes a long life, and death, and perhaps
some time in the Land of After Death too, to
know all the Bible helps and comforts. ? The
Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God,? ? she said
after a moment?s pause, in a voice so full of awe
and conviction that Nora was startled.
One of the stewards came up at that moment
and spoke to Mrs. Ormerod, and she at once went
below.
? The Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God.?
Nora stood up and took a deep breath. She
felt as if she had been suddenly lifted into another
atmosphere thrilling with hope and freedom. It
had been a relief to tell her trouble, even a little
of it, but she had not expected this sort of comfort.
She remembered when a school-fellow died in
Sydney, one who always knew her lessons and
was never late or untidy, one of the mistresses
had said, ? There is hope in such a death,? and
how she had rebelled against the tone and ex-


pression. She remembered how a neighbour had
said, when one of the farm-men was drowned in
flood-time, ? No doubt it was all for the best.?
She remembered how it was said to be a ? judg-
ment ? on that Boollambi man who broke his
neck riding back after drinking too heavily at
the Annual Show.
She had an idea that expressions like those
were the usual ? comforts ? offered by religious
people, and had therefore connected them with
the Bible. It sounded like Gilmore himself to
call the Gospel ?glorious,? she thought.
He lived for the glorious Gospel; he died
for the glorious Gospel, and perhaps helped it
on more by his death as the martyrs used to do,
or God wouldn?t have let him be killed. And I
am to be a better woman because I knew him,
and live my life for the ? glorious Gospel of the
Blessed God ? too.?
It was a turning-point in Nora?s life as she
stood there watching the light fade and the stars
come out. Perhaps some of the light of joyous
unthinking girlhood was fading too, but there were
other lights to take its place?more and more?
as Nora faced the future.
I ought to thank God for having let me know
Gilmore, instead of grieving so because he is gone.
Perhaps going home to England will open a way
for me to be a missionary too. I shall want that
more than ever now. There must be some way
of getting trained in England.?
The colour came into her face and a light into
her eyes as she planned out her career as a mis-
sionary ; picturing, girl-like, how she too might
e martyred some day, ? though I suppose they


don?t let women go to the dangerous places,? she
reflected regretfully.
Nora joined in some of the amusements with
the other passengers for the first time that e\ ening,
and Mrs. Ormerod, catching sight of her bright
interested face in some guessing competition,
smiled with approval at her new friend.
? I was so glad to see you playing with the
others,? she said, when Nora came to bid her
good-night, ? Somebody said, ?Be happy
and make others as happy as you can,? but I
think the order might be reversed. ? Make others
as happy as you can,? and then, why of course one
must be happy oneself in doing that, and also
happy to do it well.?
? I wanted to ask who said that about the
? glorious Gospel,? Mrs. Ormerod, Nora said
rather shyly. ? You said it as if it was a Bible
comfort, but it isn?t in the Bible, is it ? ?
? Yes, it is in the Bible. lam afraid I can?t
give you chapter and verse, but the words are
St. Paul?s to Timothy.? u
? I will look it up to-night,? Nora said. i
suppose I must have read the words often care-
lessly without thinking of them.?
? I don?t think you were necessarily careless,
said Mrs. Ormerod. ? There is always something
new to be found in the Bible, however often we
have read it. One finds that with poetry, or
indeed with any book worth reading more than
once, but especially with the Book. Good-night,
Miss Cameron ; wake up to-morrow to make others
as happy, and be as happy, as you can.


CHAPTER XV
THE ENGLISH COUSINS
WONDER what she will be like,?
wiT Eora Wakeman said. ?Get out that
gsh old photograph-book of mother?s,
Georgie, and see if she is there.?
? There isn?t a late one,? Georgie
said, opening the inlaid cabinet at the end of
the pretty morning-room in which the girls were
sitting. ? Because when mother asked Aunt
Lizzie for one, she wrote that the girls had not
been taken since they were at school.?
? Here is the relations? part ? said Dora, turn-
ing over the pages of portraits ; ? this must be
it. I suppose this is Nora, as she is dark. She
does not look a bad sort of child, but what funny
clothes ! ?aren?t they, Georgie ? just look at the
cut of this sleeve ! I hope she won?t be dressed
like that now.?
? Mother sent some money to buy her a decent
dress and hat for her to arrive in,? Georgie said.
? But I don?t know whether you can get proper
things out there.?
Dora laughed.
? You are as bad as old Mrs. Williams, Georgie,
who said she ? didn?t like they black folk herself,?
when I told her an Australian cousin was coming
to stay with us. Of course there are proper shops
in Sydney. It is quite a big place.?
? It?s all very well to laugh, Dora, but even
you don?t know much about this girl. She may
not be presentable.?
? She is mother?s niece.?


? Oh yes, but think of the rough life she has had
up country, as they call it. She may be horribly
vulgar and noisy.?
? She may be startlingly beautiful and ac-
complished like the Colonial Cousin in a book,
Dora said. ?She will be stealing away your
lovers, Georgie, and then marrying a duke and
patronizing us poor relations ever after. But it
is my private opinion that she is just an ordinary
country girl.?
? Oh, well, we shall see what she is like before
we take her up to town. Why, there is the
carriage already ! lam going out to meet the
new cousin.?
Georgie opened the door and went out into
the hall as Mrs. Wakeman got out of the carriage,
followed by a slim girl in a neat coat and skirt
of navy blue alpaca, a sailor hat and gauze veil.
They came up the flight of stone steps leading
up to the front-door rather slowly, as Mrs. Wake-
man was stout and felt the spring sunshine in her
handsome sealskin coat.
? It is really hot,? she said, panting a little.
Nora laughed.
? It is delicious to feel the sun again, Aunt
Sarah ; I have been so cold this last fortnight.
What a big house this is, and?oh, there is one
of the girls ! ?
? Yes, this is Georgie, and here comes Dora.
Here is your cousin, girls. Take her to her room
and let her have a rest after the long journey.?.
? I have been doing nothing but rest all through
the long journey,? Nora said. ? I don?t want
any more, Aunt Sarah. I should like to help
you with some of the work.?


Dora and her mother exchanged glances.
? You take Nora up,? Dora said. ? I will
come later.?
So Nora followed her cousin up the broad stair-
case. She stumbled once or twice, and laughed
at her own awkwardness.
? I am not used to stairs, you see,? she said.
? We have no up-stairs at home, and it is only
once or twice in Sydney that I have been in a stair-
case house.?
? How funny!? said Georgie. ? You won?t like
our rooms in town then. Dora and I sleep up
three flights of stairs, and I think you will have to
go up one higher than that.?
? Oh, I shall soon get used to them, I dare
say,? Nora said. ? Oh, what a lovely view ! ?just
look at the trees.?
They had traversed a long corridor now, and
were in the pretty guest-room that was to be
Nora?s during her visit, and from the window
she could see right over Oakfield Park with its
elms and oaks, chestnuts and beeches, trees that
Nora had never seen before.
?I wish Elsie were here, she would enjoy it! What
a lot of birds singing !?do you keep canaries ? ?
? Canaries ! no ; those are blackbirds and
thrushes, and that piping sound is a bullfinch?s
note, I think ; I don?t know much about birds.
There is a better view from mother?s room ; it is
not much from this window.?
? Perhaps not, if you have seen better ones,?
Nora said. ? But those trees ! In Australia you
hardly ever see anything but gum-trees, and gum-
trees, and more gum-trees, except just by the
river ; it is pretty there.?


? Is it a big river ? ? asked Georgie.
? Very big in flood-time ; in the summer it is
almost dry, sometimes only just a tiny stream
in the middle that Elsie and I can jump over.?
? What is Elsie like, and why didn?t she come
instead of you ? ?she is the eldest.?
?Yes, she is older than I. I think she is very
pretty ; fair with fluffy hair and blue eyes, and
she is always bright and merry. They would
have missed her dreadfully at home.?
? Was that why she did not come ? ?what a
funny girl ! I know Dora wouldn?t give up any-
thing like that for me or for mother.?
? It was not just that,? began truthful Nora,
but a knock at the door interrupted her.
? Come in,? said Georgie. ? I expect it is
your luggage, Nora ; what a lot you must have
needed for your long voyage ! ?
But only a modest trunk and bag and strapped
rug appeared, followed by a dignified personage
in a black lace cap,
? Mistress sent me to help Miss Cameron,? she
said. ?If you will give me your keys, miss, I
will unpack your boxes.?
? There is only one,? said Nora, ? and that won?t
take me long. Thank you very much, but I think
I would rather do it myself.?
? It was mistress?s orders,? said the lady?s-
maid stiffly.
? Don?t worry, Mercer,? said Georgie. ? I will
help Miss Cameron.?
? Mistress desired me to say that she wished
you to come down-stairs, Miss Georgina.?
? Oh, very well. Have a good rest, Nora,? and
Georgie went away.


Mercer stood her ground, eyeing the black cabin-
trunk with disapprobation.
? I can really manage quite well,? said Nora.
? I won?t bother you, and I dare say you are extra
busy to-day, as this is washing-day ; at least I
suppose Monday is washing-day here as well as
at home.?
Mercer sniffed.
? The laundress calls on Monday mornings; we
don?t wash at home, miss. If I can?t help you,
miss, I will return to my duties.?
Nora quickly unpacked after Mercer had gone,
and arranged her few possessions in the pretty
room. Then she looked longingly out of the
window.
? I don?t want to rest,? she thought. ? Fancy
resting in the morning !It will be resting-time
at home now ; they must be all in bed.?
She watched the trees for some time, then
opened her door, but no one was about. At last
she summoned up courage to venture out down
the corridor and big staircase, down the stone
steps, and, with a delicious sense of freedom,
out into the garden. She crossed a lawn ;it was
joy just to walk on such beautiful smooth turf !
passed flower-beds, and then through a shrubbery
to a small gate leading out into the road, and there,
just at the turning of the road, standing in a
beautiful garden of gravestones and flowers, was
a grey stone building that must of course be the
church.
Nora walked towards it to get a better view
of the tower and the graceful arched windows.
She found the gate open and the heavy old oak
door also, and, wondering, went inside.


?It is like a cathedral,? she thought. ? What
beautiful windows, and oh ! what carving ! ?
The exquisite embroidery on the altar, the stone
reredos, the font?it was all a marvel to the girl.
?? Fancy leaving the door open for any one to
go in with all these lovely things about,? she said
to herself.
She knelt down for a moment and then sat up
again, for she heard voices. Two old gentlemen
came into the church, and walked up to a rather
dark comer, and one, kneeling down, began to
talk. 5
? I want to take a rubbing of this brass to
compare with one at Rimble, Hawley.?
Can you see ? ? asked the other, who seemed
to be a clergyman.
Yes, thank you ; that shaft of light is iust
what I need.?
The clergyman moved away, and passed Nora
on his way to the vestry. He came out again in
a few minutes, and seeing the girl still sitting
there, stopped to speak to her.
? Can I do anything for you ? ?
Oh no, said Nora. ? Lnless, if you are not
busy, you would tell me something about this
wonderful church. I have never seen anything
so old before.?
? There are many older churches in the neigh-
bourhood. You are a stranger ? ?
?I only arrived from Australia this morning,?
Nora said, ? and everything is very new and
wonderful.?
Old things the newest, I suppose,? he said
with a smile. ? Come with me.?
His church was Mr. Hawley?s hobby, and Nora


spent a very happy half-hour listening to his
stories about all the treasures around her, and
incidentally learning a good deal of Church
history.
? There is a rare old brass in that corner,? Mr.
Hawley said. ? But we will not disturb Mr.
Wakeman ; he is an enthusiastic rubber.?
? Mr. Wakeman,? said Nora. ?Is he here ? ?
? That is he in the corner ; do you know him ? ?
? No,? said Nora. ? Not exactly, but he is my
uncle.?
? Then you are the young lady who was coming
to stay at Oakfield, and you have not seen your
uncle yet. Come, and I will introduce you. Here,
Wakeman,? he said, going up to the kneeling figure,
? is a promising pupil for the rubbing, a most
intelligent young lady, to whom it is a pleasure
to display our treasures, and your niece.?
Mr. Wakeman stood up, puzzled for a moment.
?Oh yes, to be sure, one of the Camerons from
New South Wales, I recollect. I hope you had
a pleasant voyage, my dear. That is complete,
Hawley.?
The two men went out of the church, Nora
following.
?You are coming to-morrow, Wakeman ? ?
? I have half-promised Phillips to do so.?
? Are the girls coming ? ?
Mr. Wakeman shook his head.
? They don?t care for archaeology.?
? Then you must bring my new friend, Miss?
Cameron, did you say ? She will appreciate it,
and Mrs. Hawley will look after her.?
The Rector bade them good-bye, and Nora and
her uncle crossed the road to the small gate.


? I shall be very glad to help you rub the
brasses, uncle,? said Nora, ? and I hope I could
make them brighter than you did ! ? she thought
to herself.
? W ell,? he said, ?we might try. A younger
pair of knees than mine would be useful.?
There are such a lot in the church, it must take
a long time. Do you do them all yourself, uncle ?
That eagle where the Bible is must be real hard
work, he is so beautifully rubbed up.?
Mr. W akeman looked round at his niece in
surprise, and then his eyes twinkled.
Rubbing brasses is not quite the same thing
as rubbing them up, my dear,? he said gravely.
I suppose that the latter process is all that
Australian brasses are likely to call for. In this
country interesting old brasses are rubbed in order
to get an exact impression of the surface. I will
show you the process to-morrow, if you like to
come for this excursion, as Mr. Hawley suggested.?
Nora laughed right out, and then laughed again.
That was a mistake ! I thought it was rather
funny somehow for you to be cleaning things in
the church, but there are such a lot of things and
ways I have never heard of, uncle, you must make
excuses, and please always tell me when I am
wrong.?
Mr. Wakeman liked the girl?s frank way of
speaking, and by the time they reached the house
they were firm friends. Mrs. Wakeman had just
despatched Mercer up-stairs to summon Nora to
luncheon after her ? rest.?
lam afraid the girl has rather decided opinions,
and it will be hard to teach her to hold her tongue.
However, we must make the best of her, and


keep her away from your father ; she would be
sure to get on his nerves,? she was saying, when
Georgie, who was standing by the window,
giggled.
? Nora has already made a conquest of the dad,
mother, so you need not worry. They are walk-
ing up the drive together, looking as pleased with
each other as they can be.?
CHAPTER XVI
NORA FINDS AN OCCUPATION
ORA, don?t English girls ever do any-
thing ? ? Nora inquired. ? I think
you must get so tired of reading
stories, and paying calls, and having
people to dinner.?
? Why should I be tired ? If you do all the
things you tell us of at home, you must be tired,
one would think.?
? It is a different sort of tiredness,? Nora said,
? and much, much nicer.?
? I suppose ordinary ways of living do seem
rather strange to you after working like a servant,?
Dora said patronizingly. ?You will never like
Australian life again when you go back.?
It was the day after the archaeological excursion,
which had been pleasure from beginning to end.
Mr. Wakeman had been very kind, and so had the


Rector and his wife, and indeed every member
of the party.
They had first visited the neighbouring cath-
edral town to see a stone lately discovered in the
cathedral crypt, and the huge old building had
been a revelation to Nora.
? It seems too good to be true,? she said breath-
lessly, as they looked up the long nave towards
the glorious carved wooden screen, and the stone
reredos with sculptured figures of the finest
modem work. She sat quietly taking it in
gradually, while the enthusiastic archaeologists
went down into the crypt; and then she knelt
in worship for a while.
She had no words to use, she had only to lift
up her heart, and the cathedral seemed to be
praying for her.
? The builders must have believed in a ? glorious
Gospel,? ? Nora thought, and she felt a pang of
sorrow that Gilmore Wickham should have died
without seeing such wonderful beauty. ? Though,
of course, heaven will be much more beautiful
and wonderful even than this.?
That was yesterday, and now she was spending
a quiet day with her aunt and cousins. She had
been quite prepared to cook the dinner or help
with the house-work, till Aunt Sarah explained
to her that ? English ladies did not do work
themselves,? and she was feeling rather lost with-
out even a supply of sewing on hand. She was
afraid it might be rude to go out and leave them,
and her relief was great when the footman came
in and held out on a silver salver a couple of
Australian letters.
It was almost disappointing only to have one


week?s news from home, there was so little to
tell. Elsie?s Sydney letter was full of her visit,
only just at the end she wrote, ? The cable said
Stan was slightly wounded, I wonder if he will
come back;? and in the postscript, ? Did you see
about Mr. Wickham ? ?
Yes, Nora had seen ; and then a wave of loneli-
ness came over her. If only he were alive, and
she had his friendship still! She wished she had
not come to England ; the girls and her aunt
did not want her, the inaction was very weari-
some, life at Oakfield seemed so trivial and useless,
and then she remembered the quiet beauty of
the cathedral, and that only five minutes off was
the church with its open door speaking a welcome ;
could she slip away ?
But deliverance came from another quarter.
Mr. Wakeman opened the door and called Georgie
to come and help him find a book in the library ;
Georgie demurred.
? You go, Nora,? she said. ? I?m in such an
exciting part of my book, and if you can?t find
it, I?ll come and help you presently.?
So Nora went.
? No wonder you can?t find the book, uncle,?
she said. ? I never saw half so many shelves
full in my life.?
? Yes, it is a fine library, but it is almost useless
without a catalogue. If you will look for The
Monumental Brasses of Norfolk, my dear, I can
go on with my writing.?
Several minutes elapsed before Nora found the
required book, and brought it to the writing-table.
? May I stay here with you, uncle?? she asked.
? I will be very quiet.?


? Certainly, my dear.?
She wandered round the room and read many
of the titles on the books, until coming to one
called English Cathedrals Illustrated, she took it
down and settled herself in the window-seat to
look at the pictures. Presently Mr. Wakeman
began fidgeting about the room looking for an-
other book.
?I should certainly save a great deal of time
if I made a catalogue of every shelf,? he said,
as he took down the volume required.
? Let me make one for you, uncle,? Nora said.
You here still, child ? Why, what do you
know about catalogues ??you would be putting
Boutell on Brasses next to Kitchiner on Cookery ,?
and he patted Nora?s cheek with a little laugh at
his own joke. \\ hat is that you have found to
read ? ?
Nora told him, and then, leaving his own occu-
pation, he took her round the long room, showing
her his treasures?some old illuminated volumes,
and some fine engravings. The announcement
o uncheon came all too soon, but with it a
welcome invitation.
Come in here whenever you like, my dear.
You have the makings of a real book-lover.?
Nora?s friendship with her uncle solved the
difficulty of her visit from everybody?s point of
view. The girls did not feel bound to entertain
her, and Nora herself was more free to come and
go as she liked, and was excused the afternoon
drives and calls to be paid.
She did persuade her uncle at last to let her
make a catalogue of the books, and had nearly
completed a re-arrangement of the shelves under


his supervision, when the time came for the visit
to London. Nora almost wished that she could
stay behind with her uncle, but she also longed
to see the wonders of London, so there was a thrill
of pleasurable excitement as they started.
CHAPTER XVII
ADVENTURES IN LONDON, AND A DINNER-PARTY
ear old Mother,
? I wonder if I can make you
see what London is like, even to get
the least bit of an idea ! I expected
a bigger sort of Sydney without the
sunshine, and London isn?t that at all. The sun
has shone gloriously every day since we came, and,
well, though I am a New South Welshwoman,
Sydney isn?t in it !
? It was evening when we arrived at the station,
and while we were waiting for the luggage there
were hundreds and hundreds of men in black
coats hurrying up the platform and getting into
trains. As fast as one train moved off quite full
up, another came in, and all the time we were
there the stream of black coats and top-hats
never ceased. I asked Georgie where they were
going, and she said, ? Home after the day?s work,?
and that there were many more to be seen at
the other big stations.
? Outside the station were rows and rows of


omnibuses, some with such big strong horses.
There did not seem to be any trams, only these
?buses and cabs ?such a lot of them, and carriages
with the loveliest horses. We were not long
driving to Wormall Street. It was getting dark,
so I could not see much, only wonderful twinkling
lights down a long street called Piccadilly, out of
which our street runs.
?Next morning Georgie and Mercer took me
out sightseeing. I did not want Mercer, but Aunt
Sarah thought she ought to come. I wish uncle
were here, but he is not coming up just yet.
Georgie did not know anything about anything,
and there were so many questions I wanted to
ask.
? We went first to the National Gallery, and
I wanted to spend the whole morning there, only
Georgie hurried me away, so I only really remem-
ber three pictures?no, four. A big one, painted
by the artist Filippino, of the Virgin and Child
and some saints, one holding a lily. The Virgin
reminded me of you, mother dear, not that she
looked like you, but I had a feeling that I wanted
to hide my face in her blue robe and say my
prayers, as we used to do years ago.
? Then in the next room was the Virgin again,
? weeping over the dead body of Christ,? it said
below, only she wasn?t weeping then ; she had
done, and her eyes were red and sad, and looked
at me?oh ! Quite near to this was another of
the Virgin and Child, painted by the same man,
Francia ; but the beautiful part of this was Mary?s
mother, St. Anne, sitting by the side, playing
with the Child. Somehow I had never pictured
the Baby Jesus with a grandmother. She had


such a lovely face with a great deal in it?some
of the younger women?s faces were empty.
? Then Georgie said we must go, but just before
we got to the stairs again I caught sight of a little
picture of two heads in a corner. ? Heads of
Apostles,? it was called ; I should like to have it
near the place I say my prayers in, the faces and
bent heads are so full of reverence and love.
? We walked a little way and saw the Houses
of Parliament with the big Clock Tower ; you
should have heard Big Ben strike ! Westminster
Abbey is just close by. I don?t know what it
made me feel like to be in there really, to see
and touch. Goodness ought to be easy where
the churches are so beautiful ; but, mother, it
gave me such a strong feeling that Westminster
Abbey and the other cathedrals belong to us in
Australia too, though we can?t see and use them.
? Then off we hurried ; we had to see St. Paul?s
and the Tower, Georgie said, but when we got
outside I found that my head was aching rather
badly, so we went back to Wormall Street, and
that was the end to my first day in London.
? Later.
? The mail closes to-day, so I must send this
to the post. There is no time to write now, for
uncle has come, and I am having the loveliest
time. He takes me out every morning, and
knows all the things I want to know, and stops
in the streets to tell me stories of the houses. We
were walking this morning through such a crowded
street, noisy with cabs, carriages, omnibuses,
motor-cars, carts, and such a stream of people
going to and fro. Suddenly uncle said, ? This


way,? and we went through an archway into a
little courtyard, looking as if it had been asleep
for centuries, and the din outside seemed quite far
away.
? Aunt Sarah and the girls drive in the Park
every day ; you would think everybody in London
was driving too, if you saw the carriages and the
lovely, lovely horses. The Park is beautiful with
flowers, and most enormously big. In LWde Park
and Kensington Gardens you can walk for miles
literally without seeing a house?we did yester-
day.?
Nora?s happiness in London depended largely
on the presence of Mr. Wakeman. When he was
away she had rather a dreary time of shopping
or driving with Aunt Sarah, or walking out with
one of the girls, or more often Mercer, when Dora
and Georgie were too tired after one party or
resting as a preliminary for another.
Nora felt very dull and lonely when they were
out in the evening. Mrs. Wakeman had explained
to her niece that it was not possible to take three
girls out at once, and she was sure that Nora
would not wish to spoil the pleasure of one of her
cousins. So Nora stayed behind and wrote home,
or to her uncle, read till bed-time, and longed
for a freer life.
She thought often of Gilmore Wickham on
those lonely evenings, and wondered if her dream
of being a missionary herself would ever come true.
She had hoped that the visit to England would
bring it nearer, and now she seemed further away
than ever before from the fulfilment of her wish.
Mrs. Wakeman entertained her friends by giving


small dinner-parties ; rather stupid, Nora thought
them, unless she happened to have an interesting
partner.
On the night of a rather more ambitious dinner
than usual, Nora?s companion was by no means
interesting, and she gave up in despair trying to
talk to him, and listened to the conversation
going on about her. That was not very interest-
ing, either, and she was just about to try again
with her next-door neighbour, when she heard the
drawling voice of a young man opposite to her,
addressing the girl next to him.
? You must not believe all you hear these
men say, Miss Carlile, when they talk about hard-
ships, and sufferings, and danger, and all that rot.
These missionaries have an easy time, as a matter
of fact. They are usually men who have failed
in other business, and are now living rent free in
some island, putting by the sum of money collected
for them by credulous people at home, and making
a good thing out of trading with the natives.?
? How do you know that, please ? Where do
such missionaries live ? ?
The authority on foreign missions looked across
the table in some astonishment, and saw the
flushed face and shining eyes of the pretty dark
girl he had noticed going in to dinner ?evidently
ready to do battle with him. He shrugged his
shoulders.
? Such knowledge is common property.?
? I thought so,? said Nora. ? Nobody who
had ever known a missionary would have spoken
as you did. Oh, you don?t know them, you can?t
know them,? ?her voice softened and her eyes
filled with tears; ? men who just give themselves


up to save the poor blacks from their horrible
lives, and teach them about Christ. In New
Guinea and the Pacific Islands ?those are the
places I know most about ?it means great danger,
certain fever, and possibly a dreadful death, and
yet they go and work and work and live there
in loneliness with no comforts, and then people
thousands of miles away can sit in a pretty room,
eating delicate food, and condemn the missionaries
and try to stop their supplies ?oh ! ?
Nora?s voice was indignant again, but she ended
with an appeal.
?You won?t again, will you ? ?
The hum of talk round the table had stopped,
and every one was watching Nora ; most of the
guests with an amused smile and an obvious
relish of her victim?s discomfiture, and Mrs. Wake-
man?s look of horrified disgust.
?You won?t again, will you ? ?
? I won?t, anyway,? said the man on Nora?s
right. ? I?m afraid I don?t know much about
missionaries, but I should like to learn. They
can?t have much fun in New Guinea, I should
think. Have you been there yourself ? ?
Nora, unconscious of the sensation she had
produced, turned to talk to this man with the
pleasant face and voice, and nothing else of note
happened during dinner, or in the drawing-room
afterwards, except that people asked to be
introduced to Nora, and were unusually kind,
so that she enjoyed her evening more than
usual.
Mrs. Wakeman did not appear at breakfast in
the morning, and when the meal was over, Mercer
came into the dining-room with a request that


Miss Cameron should come and see her mistress.
Nora found her aunt sitting up in bed, reading
her letters.
? How are you this morning, Aunt Sarah ?
tired after the party ? ?
? The party would not have tired me,? said
Mrs. Wakeman in an ominous voice. ? But to
lose my reputation of bringing pleasant people
together, to have one of my guests insulted at
my own table, has, I must own, produced intense
fatigue.?
? But I thought it all went off so well!? said
innocent Nora.
? You thought ! Want of thought is your only
excuse for such ill-behaviour and ingratitude as
you displayed last night. I have excused a great
deal because of your ignorance, but to make a
scene at a dinner-party is more than I can
bear. No, I won?t hear any excuse. Missionaries
indeed ! as if all the missionaries in the world
mattered in comparison with the comfort of my
guests.?
Poor Nora had never felt so uncomfortable in
her life. She felt she had been right in speaking
the truth, but perhaps she had spoken it in a
wrong way ; she had not meant to insult one of
Aunt Sarah?s guests.
? Shouting across the table like that,? Aunt
Sarah was going on. (? I did not shout,? thought
Nora.) ? You have done nothing to make your-
self agreeable ever since you came, and I think
the sooner you ?
Aunt Sarah?s speech was interrupted by a
knock at the door, and the entrance of Mercer.
? If you please, ma?am, Williams says the


Bishop of Weston River is waiting to see Miss
Cameron.?
?My Bishop!? Nora cried. ?I had no idea
he was in England. Oh, please, Aunt Sarah, I
am very sorry to have vexed you, but may I go
at once ? ?
CHAPTER XVIII
NORA FINDS NEW FRIENDS
REAKFAST in Onslow Gardens, where
the Bishop of Weston River was
staying with his sister, Mrs. North,
was an earlier and brighter affair
than the meal in Wormall Street.
The Bishop was telling his nieces about the
voyage?a couple of nephews had left for the
city, when the eldest strolled in with an apology
to his mother for being late.
? Well, what was the dinner-party like last
night, Jack?? she asked; ?the usual thing, I
suppose ? ?
? The usual thing,? he said, ? with an un-
expected interlude.?
? It is the unexpected that always happens,?
said one of the sisters, ? but I thought the Wake-
mans were an exception to the rule. Please tell
us about it, Jack.?
? You know Tatwell, rather the conceited prig
type of youth ? He was giving his views on


foreign missions to Miss Carlile on the opposite
side of the table, when the girl on my left leant
forward and told him he was a liar and a coward.
She did not use those words, of course, but that
was the gist of it. Every one stopped talking.
Tatwell hadn?t a word to say for himself; Mrs.
Wakeman looked daggers at the girl ?
? And what did you do ? **
? Began talking to the girl myself, and found
her a real good sort.?
? From what you say, John, we should like a
few more young women like that in London
society,? said the Bishop.
? Who is she ? ? asked Mrs. North.
? A niece of Mrs. Wakeman?s, I believe?Miss
Cameron ; she comes from Australia.?
?Cameron ?Cameron ?it cannot be my Church
worker surely?yes, she was to be in England on
a visit. What was she like, John ? ?
? Dark curly hair, dark eyes, and very much
in earnest.?
? Then it is Nora Cameron.?
?Is she staying with them, Jack ? lam afraid
Mrs. Wakeman will give her rather a bad quarter
of an hour after that,? said Mrs. North. ? I must
try to make her acquaintance,?
The Bishop said his grace and rose,
? I am going now to see Miss Cameron, Mary ;
shall I bring her to you ? ?
?By all means. Ask her to come and spend
the day with us if her aunt can spare her ; we
will send her back.?
So that was why the Bishop sat in Mrs. Wake-
man?s drawing-room half-an-hour later, waiting
for Nora to come in.


It was just as easy as ever to talk to him, Nora
found, and she soon told him all about her stay at
Oakfield and in London, all her longing for mission-
ary work, her difficulty now whether to go home
or to stay.
? Is there no place where I could go to get some
training in mission work ? ? she asked.
? You are very young,? the Bishop said. ? And
we could hardly do anything without consulting
your father and mother. Besides, you are feeling
lonely just now, and it is not ? feelings ? that must
lead you to take any important step.?
? It is so dull doing nothing,? Nora said, ? and
yet I don?t want to go home before the time.?
The Bishop considered for a few moments.
? A course of training in nursing would be very
useful to you, whatever your vocation. If you
are prepared to undertake about six months of
that, I could arrange it for you with your aunt?s
permission. No, we will not decide now. I
have an invitation for you from my sister, Mrs.
North, to spend the day with her daughters.
\ ou can think over the nursing plan afterwards.?
Five minutes sufficed to make Nora at home in
the North family, and she was sorry when the
evening came, and Mr. John, her friend of the
night before, took her back to Wormall Street.
She broached the subject of the nursing next
morning, and it was received by Mrs. Wakeman
with a sigh of relief. She became quite gracious.
? I think you are very wise, Nora ; a know-
ledge of nursing, however slight, will be invaluable
to you in your life in the Colonies. I will do all
I can to make things easy and comfortable for
you.?


So it was arranged that Nora should go for six
months to a small children?s hospital in the
country. Mrs. North?s eldest daughter was
Matron, and took an interest in the Australian
girl. The work was congenial, for Nora loved
little children ; new interests filled her life, and
the time which had hung so heavily at Oakfield,
flew by at Quainly, and the half-year was soon
past.
Nora tore herself away from her beloved sick
babies, and went to spend the last part of her
holidays in London with the Norths. She was
to go back to Australia at the time originally fixed.
Elsie?s letters were full of longing for her sister?s
return, and her father and mother were anxious
to have her back.
? Are you still as keen about missions as ever,
Nora ? ? asked Marion North one morning after
Nora?s arrival. ?Or have the babies at Quainly
banished that for ever ? ?
? Oh, it comes back now and then,? said Nora,
laughing. ? Why, Marion ? ?
? There is a drawing-room meeting about New
Guinea at Lady Boulger?s this afternoon. Mother
is going, and I shall have to go too unless you will
be charitable and take my place. I want to get
on with my new picture, and at the best of times
drawing-room meetings are deadly dull.?
? They have no excuse for making anything
about Foreign Missions dull.?
That?s right, Nora, You tell them so in that
tone of voice. Address the meeting yourself;
it will remind you of your introduction to us.?
Nora shook her head and laughed again.
? Poor Aunt Sarah ! lam very glad I did it,


though I suppose I should not speak like that
over a dinner-table now.?
Lady Boulger?s drawing-room was fairly well
filled when Mrs. North and Nora came in. Speeches
began at once ; they were rather dull, and the
chairman spoke so indistinctly that Nora could
not catch the speakers? names. Two talked at
some length, then a third name was mumbled,
and a young man came forward and began to
speak in a low, clear voice. For a moment Nora
thought she was going to faint. She had not felt
so since the day when Stanley Wilton saved the
Sunday-school at Georgetown. The heads of the
people in front swam before her eyes, and only
the sound of the speaker?s voice seemed to keep
her conscious.
For it was Gilmore?Gilmore Wickham, come
back from the dead. Gilmore Wickham telling
stories of his life in New Guinea, telling of the
progress of the work, of the new life and hope
brought to savages by the Christian missionaries,
and at last pleading for generous support from
wealthy London.
Then some one else spoke, and Nora came back
to earth again. A hymn was sung, a collection
made, and then people began to move about and
talk to one another while tea was brought in.
Gilmore Wickham came down into the room
and was introduced to several people, including
Mrs. North. She turned to Nora to include her
in the introduction, when Gilmore uttered an
exclamation of delighted surprise.
? Miss Cameron !?can it really be you ? How
did you come here ? ?
? How did you come, Mr. Wickham ? ? Nora


said. ? You are surprised to see me, but think
how surprised I was to see you, when the last I
heard of you was that you had been murdered in
New Guinea.?
? That report reached you ? ?and did you not
see the contradiction a few weeks later ? ?
? No,? said Nora. ? I was on board the Oroya,
just leaving Fremantle, when I saw the first cable,
and the second never reached me.?
? And you never inquired from your people ?
They must have seen it.?
? No,? said Nora simply. ? I was so grieved
to lose my friend that I could not bear to write
about it even to Elsie.?
? Did you never receive my letters ? I wrote
twice.?
? No,? said Nora, ? never a word.?
? I thought you had forgotten me,? Gilmore said.
? Oh, no.?
Lady Boulger came and carried him off then,
and he had only time to ask Nora where she was
staying.
? Well, was the meeting very exciting ? ? asked
Marion North, when she came home and found
Nora dressing for dinner.
? Fairly,? Nora replied. ? A friend of my
brother Phil?s, who was murdered in New Guinea,
was the speaker of the afternoon.?
? What do you mean, Nora ? ?
? The papers said he was killed, and I heard
nothing to the contrary, so it was a little startling
to meet him in a London drawing-room.?
Marion turned Nora?s face towards her and
kissed her.
?Sohe is a friend of brother Phil, is he ? Do


you think brother Phil?s eyes shone like stars
when he heard the good news, and did brother
Phil blush so very charmingly ? ?
? Don?t talk nonsense, Marion,? Nora said ;
but she was not very angry, and her eyes shone
very brightly when Gilmore Wickham came to call
after dinner, and was introduced to the North
family.
He told them all the story of his escape in New
Guinea. He was carried off alive by some blacks,
who had attacked the teachers? houses and killed
some native Christians, and his friends had given
him up for lost. Preparations were being made
to kill him, when an inland tribe came down to
revenge themselves for some wrong committed
by his captors. They unbound Wickham, and
after keeping him prisoner for a while, released
him, and he returned to the coast.
? I had a bad attack of fever after that,? he
said, ? and was obliged to take a holiday, so as
some one was needed to come here and beg for
money and help, I was sent. I don?t like this
begging business, but people won?t give unless
the matter is constantly put before them.?


CHAPTER XIX
ON THE WAY HOME
WICKHAM joined the Norths
a next day in an excursion to Hampton
Court, which Nora had not yet seen.
It was wonderfully fine and warm
for a November day ; the autumn
colours were still beautiful, and the flower-borders
still gay with single dahlias untouched by the
frost. Two of the party at any rate enjoyed
themselves very much walking through the
gardens, answering each other?s thoughts, and
coming to a very perfect understanding.
Wickham had to speak at a meeting in town
in the evening, so he left them at Waterloo Station
with a half promise to come to Onslow Gardens
on the following day. He spoke unusually well
that evening, and yet went back to his hotel in
aby no means easy state of mind ; for Nora?s face
was before his eyes, and Nora?s voice ringing in
his ears, and forcing himself to look squarely at
the facts of the case, he acknowledged that he
loved her. But in his plan of life love was to
have no place.
A hard struggle was gone through that night
in Wickham?s room, while Nora fell asleep with
a light heart and a very happy smile. The result
of the struggle was that W ickham went out in
the morning and booked his berth in the Ormuz,
leaving for Sydney in January. He could not
get away before, but that should give him time to
fulfil all his engagements and carry out his work.


He did not call at the Norths? for several days,
and then Nora happened to be out ; another time
she was away at Oakfield, and Wickham con-
gratulated himself that his sacrifice had been made
easy, though his heart ached to see Nora again.
Nora was sadly disappointed when no Gilmore
came while she was in town, but as she was to stay
in Onslow Gardens again for a few days before
she sailed, she hoped to see him then.
For a final treat her uncle took her to Edinburgh
to see her father?s old home, and the portraits in
the Parliament House. It was a treat indeed to
see the beautiful city, and it was in Edinburgh
that Nora bought the presents to take to the home
folks.
She was longing to be back with them. Since
she had found Gilmore Wickham and lost him
again, her home-sickness returned as badly as in
the early days of her visit, and she felt that it
would be good to be at home, working with her
mother and Elsie again.
The cold weather at Christmas tried her a
little, and a prospect of Australian sunshine was
cheering ; even the hot westerly winds seemed
kind compared with the bitter north-easter that
drove frozen sleet into her face that last day in
Edinburgh.
She had a Christmas-card from Gilmore Wick-
ham, and sent him one. He often sat down to
write to her ; but words were hard to find, and
he decided to put it off till he was on board ship,
and post at Marseilles or Naples.
Nora bade farewell to Oakfield soon after Christ-
mas, and went to London to the Norths?, staying
with them till the day came when Marion and


John took her on board the steamer and bade her
good-bye. It was cold and damp, and Marion,
who had a cough, was hurried off by her brother,
and Nora went below. She found her cabin, and
began to unpack some of her things, feeling very
lonely without a friend to be with her until the
last minute.
The stewardess came and spoke to her, prophesy-
ing a tossing in the ? Bay,? and to Nora?s surprise
she found that her cabin-companion was to be a
former fellow-passenger who had also been home
for nearly a year to visit friends. They dis-
cussed their various adventures till the tea-bell
sounded.
? Wait for me a moment, Miss Cameron,? the
other girl said. ? I have not unpacked yet, and
I must tidy my hair for tea.?
So by the time Nora went into the saloon,
nearly all the passengers were seated. One of
the stewards asked her name, and took her to her
seat between one of the officers and a clergyman.
No, it could not be true ! Nora?s heart gave a
great jump as she recognized her neighbour. He
was talking to the lady on the other side, and did
not notice that the place to his right had been
filled up, and Nora had time to collect herself
again after the surprise of recognition.
She felt most unaccountably happy, and it was
with difficulty that she kept the corners of her
mouth in order as she said quietly?
? May I pass you the salt, Mr. Wickham ? ?
Gilmore?s feelings when he saw the girl from
whose presence he had run away, sitting at his
side and offering him the salt-cellar, may be
better imagined than described.


?It is not really you ? ? he said incredu-
lously.
? Well,? said Nora, ? it feels like me ; would
you like to shake hands and make sure ? ?
? But I thought you were in Hertfordshire.?
? I thought you were in London, yet here you
are. Are you in the habit of making sudden
and unexpected appearances and startling your
friends, Mr. Wickham ? ?
? You did not look startled this time.?
? I was pleased,? Nora said softly.
Was it luck or fate, or had she been sent for
some good reason ? He had honestly tried to
give her up, to put the thought of her out of his
life, he had prayed very earnestly for guidance?
and here she was to be his constant companion for
six weeks. He must at least be polite to her ;
so not only at meal-times, but almost all day
were the old pleasant, friendly relations set up
between them.
They read the service together that first Sunday
when no public sendee was held on board, and
the doing of that simple act of prayer and praise
drew them so closely together that the thought
came to Gilmore with overwhelming force that
there was no need for him to run away. He
remembered Nora on that sunny morning at
Niddry turning to him and saying so quietly,
? I want to be a missionary, I have wanted it all
my life.? Why should she not be one ? Why
should she not come and help him if she would ?
?not at once, not for two or three years perhaps;
but by that time would not the work of an English
lady in one of the healthier settlements be in-
valuable amongst the girls and women ? She


was not like other girls?and then she came up on
deck looking so bright and fresh that he had no
doubt of her superiority.
It was not till the evening before they reached
Sydney that Nora heard of all his hopes, and knew
at last the reason why he had not come more often
to see her in London, If there had been any
lingering doubt in Gilmore?s mind as to the right
or wrong of asking Nora to mary him, it vanished
away when she looked full into his eyes and said
gravely?
? But, Mr, Wickham, what about your work ?
We must think first of that.?
It might be a very long engagement ; that they
agreed, and yet they were both very happy as
the Ormuz sailed into Sydney harbour. The
knowledge of her love would carry him through
any danger and difficulty, and she would settle
down to the home life at Niddry all the better
for his love for her, preparing herself for the work
in store.
CHAPTER XX
AN AUSTRALIAN CHRISTMAS
SHRISTMAS Eve at Niddry was one
of the hottest days Elsie could re-
member. Bush-fires were raging a
few miles to the west; fortunately
for the Camerons, they were on the
other side of the river. The hot westerly wind


blew unceasingly all day, drying up every bit of
green, and bringing with it hot smoke and even
ashes from the burning bush to bury the shri\ elled
flowers. . ?
Inside the house, which was closed against the
wind as far as possible, every one felt cross and
tired, and dismally prophesied that Christmas Da\
would be just as bad, if not worse.
? The westerly wind began yesterday,? said
Chris, ? and it nearly always blows for three days
without a break.?
? I remember one year it blew for three weeks,
didn?t it, mother ? ? said Elsie.
? Try to remember something a little more
cheerful than that, child,? said Mrs. Cameron.
? Let?s all think hard of Nora being frozen in
England, and covered with chilblains, suggested
Clem, ? then perhaps we?ll feel cooler.?
? If that makes you cooler, Clem,? Elsie said,
? I wish you would go and talk about Nora and
the ice to the butter, or there will be nothing
but a little warm oil for tea.?
? The bread will be dreadfully dry, Elsie,?
Chris said. ? Don?t you think scones would be
nice ? ?
? i?ll mix them if you will bake them,? Elsie
said.
? Done,? said Chris. ? Or, better still, we 11
set Clem to watch them. You can think about
Nora making a snow-man and breaking the ice
in her bath, Clem, when you open the oven-door.
? I don?t care,? said Clem. ? It?s not much
hotter in the kitchen. I believe they would bake
if we put them outside on the stones in the sun.?
Elsie slipped off to her room presently, and lay


down on the bed, though it was hotter than ever
under the sloping roof. The atmosphere was de-
pressing, and she found it hard to be patient with
the boys.
? I wish Nora was back,? she said to herself,
? but it won?t be long now. lam so tired of this
dreary, dreary 7 life. These have been weary
months ! ?
Poor Elsie ! ?the time since Nora went away
had dragged rather heavily. No word for her
had come from Stanley Wilton. He had written
to Mr. Cameron and sent messages to her mother
and Nora and the boys ; only in one letter had
he said he hoped Miss Elsie was enjoying herself.
As this message came immediately after the calf
of the period had pulled down the clothes-prop,
and landed in the dust of the yard the line of
snowy clothes Elsie had just hung out to dry, his
kindly wish did not meet with a cheerful response.
? Enjoying myself, indeed ! ? she thought in-
dignantly. ? I suppose he thinks I am in Eng-
land, but I?m not, and I never shall be now ;
Aunt Sarah will never ask me again.?
The long months without Nora had drawn
Elsie and her mother very closely together, and
the girl had improved in many ways. She was
more gentle, if a little less bright and happy,
though it was only now and then that an attack
of blues came and had to be fought against.
She did not stay in her room long ; there was
tea to get and the animals to be fed, and her father
to be cheered up after his long day in the heat
outside on the farm. After tea the wind dropped,
but the heat only became more oppressive.
?No hope of a cool breeze to-night,? Mr.


Cameron said. ?It hardly ever comes after the
wind has fallen.?
They all went outside, but the air was stifling
with the smoke, and now the sun was down, they
could see the line of fire out towards the west.
The mosquitoes were troublesome, and Elsie soon
went in to toss on the bed in her little room till
morning.
? We shan?t feel very merry this Christmas,?
she thought, ? if the morning is as bad as this.?
It was as bad. Up came the wind again with
a still more scorching heat. Mrs. Cameron and
Elsie tried to get as much of the work as possible
done before the sun was high, and the pudding,
without which no British Christmas is complete
even with the thermometer nB� in the shade,
was put on to boil.
When breakfast was over, Elsie began to pluck
the turkey Chris had brought in for dinner. She
chose a sheltered corner of the verandah facing
south out of the sun and wind, and worked away,
humming a Christmas hymn.
? One can?t help feeling Christmassy,? she
thought, ? though it is so hot. Perhaps good is
going to happen, or perhaps it is because some-
thing so very good did happen on Christmas Day.?
She had pulled out the last quill and begun
to stow away the feathers in a bag, when in a
moment they were flying all over the verandah,
together with a cloud of dust from the yard, and
then the air was clear and fresh ! Elsie lifted
her head and threw out her arms to meet the
strong cold wind with a cry of delight. Then
she ran into the house to open all the windows to
let in the cool southerly breeze.


?Mother, mother,? she called, ?it will be a merry
Christmas after all; just feel this lovely cool
Outside Chris was singing ? God save the King,
the only tune he knew, and Clem was dancing
with the yard-dog, every living thing rejoicing
in the change. As Elsie finished stuffing the
turkey and prepared to put it in the oven, a
footstep sounded outside on the \ erandah.
?Is that you, Chris ? ? she said. ? Come and
open the oven-door for me ; this big, big bird
is so heavy.?
Chris did not come, so the turkey was put down
on the stove for a moment while Elsie opened
the oven-door and shut it in; then she turned and
saw Stanley Wilton standing in the doorway.
She could not speak for a moment, and then her
voice sounded hard and unnatural.
? How do you do, Mr. Wilton ? I am sorry I
can?t shake hands ; mine are all over stuffing.?
? Elsie ! when did you come back ?
? Come back ? ? she said, with affected surprise.
? I have not been away, so how could I come
back ? ?
? But the invitation came; you went to
England.? ...
?An invitation came certainly,? said Elsie
quietly. ? But I did not consider myself free
to go away.?
? Elsie, Elsie, you did not go ? ?then it has all
been a horrible mistake. Oh, Elsie, my darling, can
you ever forgive me ? I thought ?I meant
For answer Elsie stepped back to the inner door.
? Mother,? she called, ? here is Stanley Wil-
ton come back looking so strong and well; come
and wish him a Merry Christmas.?


CHAPTER XXI
CHRISTMAS PEACE
SHRIS and Clem were wild with delight
when they found Stanley Wilton sit-
ting on the kitchen-table, talking to
Mrs. Cameron.
?We had planned such a dull
Christmas, too,? Chris said. ? And now it is
going to be a real good merry one.?
?Where?s your medal, Stan? ?and, oh, did you
really kill a Boer ? ?
?Of course he did, you silly. Show us where
you were wounded, Stan. Weren?t you a little
tiny bit sorry when Peace was proclaimed ? ?
? Suppose we have one question at a time,?
Stanley answered, laughing. ? Let me think
what came first. Where?s my medal ??I have
not got it yet. Did I kill a Boer ??Well, I
suppose I did, but that is the part of war that
one would rather not think about afterwards; and
I was very, very thankful when we heard about
Peace, for every one was more than full up with
the war by then.?
? And your wound, Stan ? ?
? My wound?it was only a scratch,? and he
turned back his sleeve and showed them a long
scar on wrist and arm where the Boer bullet had
grazed him. The boys looked at him with awe.
? I wish they had given you the V.C., Stan ;
why didn?t they ? ?
?Why ??because I did not earn it, of course.?
?You were brave enough.?


? I hope so, Chris, if the chance had come ; I
don?t know ; but the chance did not come to do
any very special brave thing to deserve that.?
? Stanley Wilton ! I am pleased to see you
again.? Mr. Cameron came in and shook the
young soldier warmly by both hands. ? It?s not
too soon, either. Your place wants its master
back to look after things, for I suppose you will
settle down now ; no thought of going back, eh ?
? It is a fine country to settle in, no doubt,?
said Stan. ? I don?t know what I may do, but
I would rather be here, on the whole. There will
be a tremendous rush of all sorts of fellows into
South Africa within the next few months. Where
is Nora, Mrs. Cameron ? ?
? Nora is in England still. She won?t be home
till March.?
? Nora in England ? How was that ? and what
about the Sunday-school ? ?
?Mrs. Wakeman?Aunt Sarah, you know?sent
an invitation for Elsie, and she would have Nora
go instead, so Nora went; fancy you not hearing
that ! ?
Stanley looked across at Elsie polishing glasses
by the dresser, but Elsie would not look at him.
He felt his love for her deepening the more he
heard and knew of her. Either she had refused
to go to England for his sake, or in order to give
Nora the treat ; whichever way was noble and
unselfish. Often while he was away he had
doubted his own wisdom in leaving without a
word. He had meant to leave her free ; but was
it fair to her, after she had given her promise ?
That she would not go when she heard of his
volunteering for South Africa had never crossed


his mind, and yet here she was, sweeter and
prettier, if quieter than before.
He answered Mrs. Cameron?s questions and
the boys? demands for tales of adventures me-
chanically, thinking all the while of the girl who
was busy over the dinner-table. If she never for-
gave him he had only himself to thank. Why
had he not trusted her ? There might be some one
else by now ; he racked his brains to think who
the some one might be, as he described to Mrs.
Cameron the chase after De Wet from a trooper?s
point of view.
Elsie, when she saw Stan the centre of attention,
her father and the boys listening to all he said,
her mother stopping now and then to put in a
question, found it easy to think hard thoughts
of him. If he had been lonely and friendless she
might have forgiven him, but she vaguely felt
that he had no right to be enjoying himself. She
would not join in the listening group, so she felt
left out and angry.
Poor Elsie ! She was almost rude to Stan
when he came round to her side and asked how
the Sunday-school was getting on.
? Ask Chris,? she said. ? I?m busy.?
The dinner was a merry one in spite of the
fact that two of the party were feeling decidedly
uncomfortable. Every one laughed when Mr.
Cameron found the thimble in his slice of pudding.
The sixpence did not appear, but the ring was
in the visitor?s slice, and Clem inquired if the
bride was to be an African with woolly hair.
? Afrikanders haven?t got woolly hair,? said
Chris. ? I expect it?s one of them. What?s her
name, Stan ? You must hurry and get your new


house built, as the wedding is to be before next
Christmas.?
They took their tea down to the river in the
afternoon and picnicked in the old punt. It was
really rather hard to be dignified in a punt with
a billy of hot tea, two boys, and a big sun-burned
lover who looked at Elsie with pleading eyes and
told such interesting tales about his camping on
the veldt, and afterwards when they all met in
the sitting-room at Niddry, and Mr. Cameron
read the Christmas story, and Elsie played the
familiar hymn-tunes on the old harmonium,
which had only a few notes missing !
It was so good to hear Stan?s voice singing
away, so hard to remember the long weary
months without him now that he was here.
So when the singing was over, she spoke more
gently?
? Will you come to the school on Sunday,
Stan ? ?
? I shall be very glad to come if I may,? he
said. ? How is it getting on ? ?
? Let us all go outside,? said Mrs. Cameron.
It is such a nice cool night,?
Perhaps she saw that something was wrong,
and wanted it put right.
? The Sunday-school is getting on pretty well,
but we want Nora badly. Did you hear what
a lot of money we have towards our little church,
Stan ? ?
? No,? he said. ?Do tell me.?
? There was a sale of work, and we had a concert
at Boollambi, and we have saved the children?s
pennies, and the collection-money when we had
service in the barn (we borrowed chairs, you


know), and with the help the Bishop promised
we ought to begin building soon.?
? I suppose'we could do a good bit of the work
ourselves,? Stanley said. ? Clearing the ground,
and painting, and so forth.?
? Oh, do suggest that, Stan. If you can get
some of the younger men to help you, we can
get our church in no time. It would be rather
fun to start before Nora comes home ; it would
be such a lovely surprise for her.?
? Well, we have two clear months before she
comes ; we might try, Elsie ; why did Nora go
to England instead of you ? ?
There was no answer, and he went on.
? You always longed so to go ; it was the wish
of your life. I see now, dear,? his voice was very
low and earnest, ? I see now that it was very wrong
of me to go away as I did. I can hardly under-
stand now how I came to do it. I was so utterly
happy that morning thinking of you. Thinking
?thinking ?of you in the evening here, of you as
my wife, of you as my helper all through our lives,
and then Chris came and said you were going to
England.?
? And you believed him ! Oh, Stan, how could
you, when I had promised to be ? She stopped.
? I was unhappy enough,? he said. ? Then I
saw the announcement in the Herald of the last
possible time for volunteers for South Africa to
apply, and I went.?
? Without one word.?
?Yes. I don?t know? if you will ever forgive
me, Elsie. I was miserable enough. I thought
if I went away it would be easier for you to go to
England, and I used to picture you there, perhaps


married to some one else. How you must have
hated me, Elsie ! ?and you let Nora go.?
? I made Nora go ; she did not want to. I was
very, very angry with you, Stan, and I felt if I
went to England it would justify what you did ;
not really, but in a way, so I would not go. And
I did want Nora to go,? she added. ? She is so
clever and knows about all the places, and would
enjoy it all ever so much more than I.?
? She is a good girl,? said Stan, ? but not half
so good as you, Elsie. I used to think she was
better, though I always loved you, and now that
I find you are not only the sweetest and prettiest
and dearest girl in the world, but also the most
unselfish, Elsie, think how I love you ! Do you
think, dear, that some day, when the church is
built perhaps, when I have done something just
for you ?not now, I could not expect it now?
that you could forgive me and love me a little
again ? ?
There was silence for a moment, and then
Stanley felt two hands trying to reach up to his
neck.
? Oh, you Stan, silly old Stan, do you think
if I had not forgiven you I would be here now ?
I did try hard to hate you, and I almost succeeded
this morning, but it is so much nicer to be happy
than angry, and I could not go on being cross
after the Christmas hymns.?


CHAPTER XXII
ST. GEORGE?S DAY
HAT night came welcome rain, which
iOl P u * out bush-fires and gave
Stanle y Wilton a good start with
his farming. He had much to do, but
managed to spare some time for the
new church. He was something of a hero after
his South African experiences, and the young men
of the neighbourhood were willing enough to join
in the work when he showed them the way.
The result was, that when Nora landed at Port
Weston in March, and her father drove to meet
her, he had to be made to promise solemnly that
not one word would he say about the new building.
Nora was glad of the long drive along the
familiar road. Somehow, being far away for a while
had made her understand her father better, and
she found it quite easy to tell him about Gilmore
Wickham.
? Well, well,? he said, ? it seems that neither
of you are to be old maids.?
? What do you mean, father ? ?has Elsie?is
Stan back ? ?
? Came home on Christmas Day, and he and
Elsie made it up in the evening, so you will see
a good deal of him, Nora, when he is not ?
Mr. Cameron stopped, remembering his promise,
but they were in sight of Niddry now, and Nora
stood up in the buggy.
? There?s the dear old home,? she cried. ? Oh,
father, it is good to be back again. There?s


mother and there?s Elsie, oh ! and Chris on the
roof, and Clem flying to open the gates for us. Oh,
mother, mother ! I am glad to be home.?
They could not keep secrets long at Niddry, so
Nora was taken across in the punt next day and
shown the wooden walls of a small building, and
the iron ready to roof it. She could hardly believe
her eyes or Elsie?s story.
? It is all Stan?s doing from beginning to end,?
she said. ? Elsie, you ought to be proud of your
lover.?
? I am,? said Elsie, and then she added practi-
cally, ? and I have the stuff for his surplice, Nora ;
you must help me to cut it out.?
? Then he is to be our lay-reader ? ?
? Yes,? said Elsie. ? The Bishop came to see
us, Nora, and said he had seen you in London.
Of course we knew that from your letters, but it
was nice of him to come, and if only we can open
the church without any debt, he will come and
consecrate it, and, anyway, he will come for the
first service here.?
?It is very wonderful, Elsie. I do feel so
thankful. When I saw the lovely churches and
cathedrals at home I used to long so for our church
here to be built. It won?t be beautiful as they
are, but there is beauty in hard work and love of
Him that God will see, won?t He ? ?
? Yes,? said Elsie. ? And, Nora, we must
think of a saint to call the church after.?
? We will look in the Calendar,? Nora said.
? St. Paul is my favourite saint, but the church in
Port Weston is his, so we must find another saint.?
They talked of nothing but the new church
for the next five weeks, and the opening service


was fixed for April the 23rd. When they had
the Bishop?s letter saying he could come on that
day, the difficulty about the dedication was cleared
away. Of course it must be St. George ; it was
his day, and in Georgetown it seemed right to
have the church St. George?s,
But greatly to their disappointment the build-
ing could not be consecrated because there was
a debt of �2O. The seats had proved more ex-
pensive than they thought, and yet it did not seem
possible to start without them. It was a pity, but
it could not be helped, and they hoped for the
consecration at a later time.
In Nora s and Elsie?s little room was only limited
space for putting away dresses and other treasures,
so Nora?s cabin-trunk now formed part of the
furniture. She was arranging her books one day,
and took out with a smile a copy of Boutell on
Monumental Brasses that her uncle had sent her
as a parting gift, and showed it to Elsie with a
laughing story of her mistake about the ? rubbing
?lam afraid I shan?t read it much here,? she
said, ? but it may as well go on the shelf.?
Something dropped out,? said Elsie, picking
up an envelope from the floor.
Nora took it from her, and they saw written
outside, ?For my niece Nora to buy fal-lals,?
and inside was a Bank of England note for �25.
Elsie gave a little gasp.
? Twenty-five pounds ! oh !?Nora ! ?
? How good of uncle ! ? said Nora, ? and just
like him to give it like this and talk about 4 fal-
lals ? as if he belonged to the century before last.
He is such a dear, Elsie.?


? I can quite believe it, Nora. What will you
do with the money ? ?
?Well,? said Nora, ?I have not quite made
up my mind about the five, but the twenty will
mean that St. George?s church will be consecrated
on St. George?s Day.?
And so it was.
The little wooden building was full of people
on that April Sunday, and the Bishop dedicated
it to the Glory of God for ever. It was a very
solemn service, and not the least impressive part
was the time when Mr. Morgan presented Stanley
Wilton to be admitted as a lay-reader.
The Bishop laid his hands on the new lay-reader?s
head, and blessed him and his work, charging him
to read the service faithfully, and then they sang
the hymn which Nora always connected with her
? Mission ? at Georgetown.
?Use me, O Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when and where,?'
she sang, and Gilmore Wickham at her side, hear-
ing her clear voice in the hymn, thanked God for
such a helpmeet.
He had come specially to be at the dedication
of the church, and for Elsie?s wedding, which
took place the next day. They had hurried the
wedding a little, so that the Bishop could marry
them, and Gilmore Wickham be present, so it
was on the Monday morning early. The George-
town girls decked the church afresh with roses, and
there surely was never a prettier, sweeter bride
than Elsie in her simple white muslin gown.
Nora wondered when her own turn would come
to make those solemn promises as she stood behind


her sister, and in Gilmore?s mind was the same
thought, for as they came out he touched her hand
and said in a low voice?
? I hope it will not be long.?
Nora turned to him with a smile.
? ? Jast as Thou wilt, and when and where,? ?
she quoted. ? That is my favourite hymn, Gil-
more.?
? Yes,? he said, ? I thought it must be by the
way you sang it ; and I thought of you when I
saw the words at the top.?
? What are they ? I never noticed.?
? My helper in Jesus Christ,?
