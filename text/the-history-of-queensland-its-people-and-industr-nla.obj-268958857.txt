Preface.
The history of Queensland is the history of Progress, and it is the function of this booh, the
second volume in a series of three, to provide an adequate and reliable record of that 'progress. The events
of three quarters of a century—crucial years in the history of the Colony—are shown in perspective in the
following chapters. Backward along the path of achievement, beaten firm with the tread of the pioneers,
the reader may glance at his leisure, not only noting each outstanding phase of political and industrial
development, but also ascertaining its relative influence on the life of the people. A survey such as this
enables one to appreciate adequately the value to a young country of hardy colonists, men who blazed the
track in the early days, and, despite incalculable difficulties, won in the struggle for existence. An attempt
has been made to visualise for the reader the most important aspects of the growth of the Colony since the
li village days” of Brisbane. Many interesting sidelights have been thrown upon the lives of the men who
took a prominent share in advancing the interests of the new settlement. It is to he hoped that, in casting
his vision backward, the reader not only may derive intellectual enjoyment, but may also be inspired with
confidence to look boldly into the future. Many photographs and documents of historical value have been
reproduced, and the publishers desire to express their thanks to Mr. H. A. Mobsby, the Government
Photographer, the Commissioner for Railways, and Sir Robert Scott for their courtesy in lending valuable
photographs for publication. Mr. Andrew Grant succeeded the late Ernest Sands Emerson as Editor and
has contributed many of the articles appearing in the Editorial section.

CHAPTER XIII.
FIRST YEARS OF FREE SETTLEMENT.
THOUGH the Moreton Bay convict station was
broken up on May 21, 1839, not until May 4,
1842, was the district declared a free settlement.
During the intervening three years a few free
settlers were allowed, under special permit, to take up
their abode in the embryo town of Brisbane. The first
and treacherous character of the surrounding blacks.
The latter fact had been brought prominently before
public attention by the murder of Captain Logan.
Moreover, the prohibition against free men approaching
closer than fifty miles from the settlement had
helped to veil in obscurity all knowledge of the locality
MARYBOROUGH, ON THE MARY RIVER, IS ONE OF THE OLDEST TOWNS IN QUEENSLAND. FOUNDED IN 1848.
of these, who arrived in 1840, were John Williams, Thos.
Dowse, G. Edmondstone, G. S. Le Breton, David Bow,
John Richardson, Win. Holman Berry, R. Little, P.
Phelan, and M. Moriarty.
Up to the time of throwing open the region little
attention had been devoted to the wild and little-known
land at the back of Moreton Bay. As a matter of
fact, the Moreton Bay district was chiefly notorious on
account of the desperate nature of the convicts which
the authorities had been sending there and the war-like
B
except that which came through official channels. Indeed
the officials regarded the place solely as a penitentiary
for the reception of the worst class of criminals.
When free settlement began, Brisbane consisted
merely of an abandoned convict station, with
necessary officers’ quarters and other buildings needed
in such a place. Certainly nothing had been accom-
plished with the view of laying the foundations of a
town. Indeed, the site of the settlement, from the
view-point of the earlier pioneers desiring to use it, had


been chosen on the wrong side of the river. The first
occupation of pastoral country had been on the Darling
Downs, and on country between there and Moreton Bay,
so that the settlers desiring to get to the capital of the
district found themselves, at last, cut off from their
destination by the quarter-mile width of the river.
Ferries were resorted to, but long and tedious delays
often occurred in having drays and draught stock
brought across the stream. The result was that a second
township sprang up on the site of what now is South
Brisbane, a place which in the early days consisted of low
marshy ground much liable to inundation. A third
straggling village sprang into being at Kangaroo
Point, the reason being partly due to the lower price
at which land was obtainable on the peninsula which
the winding of the river forms at that spot. Under
the law then operating <£loo per acre was charged by
the Crown for township land, whilst that at Kangaroo
Point was classed as country land. This difference
tempted the enterprise of Sir Evan Mackenzie, and he
bought up the area, which he subdivided and sold at a
profit, but at a much lower figure than was demanded
on the opposite side of the river. This splitting of the
town into three small villages made for anything but
efficiency of control, and probably the plan of the streets
in the metropolis to-day would have been more satis-
factory had more concentration of settlement been
arrived at in earlier years.
Thus free settlement began in a town which, in the
ordinary sense of the word, was hardly a town at all.
No streets had been constructed, and the various
convict buildings had been dumped on whatever sites
respectively appeared most convenient, without any
thought of fitting the general plan in with an effort
utlimately to survey a town. The following are a few of
the conversions which took place, sooner or later, after
the termination of the penal era. The convict hospital,
which had been erected in 1827, was turned into police
barracks, and was afterwards removed to make room for
the law courts. The chaplain’s residence, built in
1828, became the Colonial Secretary’s office. The
prisoners’ barracks, constructed in 1828, became the
Supreme Court, and the military barracks, set up in
1828, were converted into Treasury Buildings. The
windmill, erected in 1829, and still one of the most con-
spicuous landmarks about Brisbane, was turned into an
observatory. The female factory, erected in 1830, was
converted into a police court. The quarters of the
Superintendent of Convicts, built in 1829, ultimately
became the railway engineer’s office. The quarters of
the official surgeon, put up in 1831, came to be occupied
by the Inspector of Police for the Moreton Bay district;
and the military hospital, dating from 1832, was turned
into the Public Works office. The quarters of the Com-
mandant fronted the river, close to what now is William
Street. At the rear were several minor buildings,
used by officials and servants attached to the Com-
mandant. These lay near what now are George
Street and Telegraph Lane. Some little distance further
up the river lay the commissariat quarters, which were
afterwards used by the Colonial Secretary s staff. The
quarters of the clerk of works lay between Fortitude
Valley and Breakfast Creek.
The early efforts of the New South V ales Govern-
ment to survey and found a town on the site of Brisbane
were associated with procrastination and bungling.
Instead of taking immediate steps, with the abolition
of the convict settlement, to lay out a town, the authori-
ties despatched Messrs. Dixon, Stapleton, and Warner
to survey the environs of the bay. This expedition
began work in July, 1840, by searching for a route
to Richmond River. Not only was this task fraught
with practically unsurmountable difficulty, arising from
the rugged and densely-forested nature of the country
to be traversed, but the advantages to accrue from its
success are by no means apparent. However, while the
few free settlers permitted to Brisbane were unable to
obtain any security of tenure, because of the absence
of survey, the three surveyors went off on the enter-
prise which was doomed to a tragic ending. The party
split, Messrs. Dixon and Warner beginning work at
Moreton Bay, while Stapleton started off overland for
the Richmond, which he was to run down to a point at
which it was agreed he was to meet his colleagues.
When near Mount Lindsay, close to what is now the
border of New South Wales, Stapleton and his whole
party fell victims to one of those surprise attacks which
formed the favourite method of assault among the blacks
in timbered country. All but one man fell mortally
wounded, and the sole survivor was left by the savages
for dead lying on the embers of the fire which had been
used for consuming the remains of his late comrades.
Fortunately the man was found soon afterwards by his
countrymen, and he completely recovered both from
wounds and burns. This particular surveying effort was
then abandoned, and attention devoted to a trigono*-
metrical survey near Ipswich. Finally a work of a
similar kind was attempted near Brisbane. Of all this
work the plans and records were sent to Sydney, and
they were never heard of again by residents of the
Moreton Bay district. Neither did any good result from
them. Mr. Dixon at this time was recalled to Sydney,
and a Mr. Wade sent out to fill the vacancy.
On the Moreton Bay district being proclaimed a
free settlement, plans for the town of Brisbane were
submitted to Sir George Gipps, who at that time was
Governor of New South Wales. In those days con-
siderable doubt existed as to the best site for what
was to be the principal town of the territory. As late
as 1860, Cleveland had its supporters to the claim of
2

possessing the most suitable site for the commercial
centre and outlet of the district. Ipswich (or Lime-
stone, as it was then called) and the junction of the
Bremer and Brisbane Rivers, as well as other spots,
were favoured. It appears, however, that Sir George
Gipps, who visited Brisbane, considered that the town
must be laid out either on the present site or at Ipswich.
Accordingly, on leaving from his visit to Moreton Bay,
the Governor left a minute, of which the following is an
extract:
"An accurate survey should first be made of*all the
country on the right bank of the Bremer for about a
mile above and two or three miles below Mr. Thorn’s
house, and for about three miles along the high road in
each direction; that is to say, towards Brisbane on the
one side and towards Darl-
ing Downs on the other.
. . . The broken nature
of the ground is the only
difficulty which opposes it-
self to the selection of the
site for the town. The
plateau on which the
shearing shed stands seems
to be the best, and this
must be adopted, unless
Mr. Wade should find
one lower down the river,
to which a decided pre-
ference should be given.”
Commenting on the
survey, the late Mr. Wil-
liam Coote wrote: “Special
directions are given in the
same (above) minute that
the main road leading to
Brisbane and the Darling
Downs should be properly
laid out, and the errors
in their then direction
rectified. Unfortunately
these instructions met with the usual fate of even
gubernatorial wishes when the central authority is
remote. The district surveyor did not look for a site
lower down the river and did not lay out the roads ;
but local personal interests and influences were allowed
by him to supersede the essential considerations sug-
gested by the Governor’s minute, and the present
inferior site for the town was retained. It has been
the fashion to lay the blame of all the deficiencies
in the plans of both Brisbane and Ipswich upon
the shoulders of Governor Gipps, but the most authentic
information I could obtain leads me to quite different
conclusions. A careful enquiry into the facts would
rather tend to the belief that the stereotyped routine of
b 2

MARKS OF BRISBANE.
the New South Wales Survey Office in such matters,
and the influences to which its subordinates were sub-
ject were too powerful even for a Governor—a belief
strengthened by fact, that in nineteen out of twenty
of the towns laid out since Gipps’ time—and even since
separation—the very course whose adoption led to the
defects alleged to exist in Brisbane and Ipswich have
been continued, and their evils multiplied and per-
petuated.”
The objections to Brisbane being chosen for the
capital mostly arose from its distance up the river,
though, of course, such an argument would apply with
even greater force as against the selection of Ipswich
for a similar jmrpose. The bar across the mouth of the
stream at that time carried but 8 feet of water. Though
dredging had been sug-
gested as a means for
overcoming this handicap,
the method was regarded
suspiciously as being likely
to involve a continuous
expense. It has to be
remembered that the ship-
ping in those days was of
the most meagre possible
description. In August of
1837, the “James Watt”
was the first steamer to
enter Moreton Bay; whilst
not till 1840 did a vessel
begin trading regularly
between the young settle-
ment and Sydney, and
then the ship was only a
small schooner called the
“John,” of sixty tons bur-
then. Certainly it did not
appear that the commerce
of the place could, for
many years to come, stand
the expense of any con-
tinuous dredging operations. Moreover, the route up
Moreton Bay, through innumerable shoals, was regarded
as tedious enough without a further extension of seven-
teen miles of the river. A further objection to the
site of the present capital lay in the small extent of
level ground available for building on. Yet the selection
fell on Brisbane. Probably this was because no one
at that time contemplated the settlement becoming the
commercial, and ultimately the political, centre of an
immense territory. Certainly no provision was made
for the development of the infant village into a busy
city. Sir George Gipps favoured the survey dividing
the land into quarter-acre blocks, with roads 66 feet in
width. Ultimately, however, Queen Street was increased


to a width of about 80 feet, by the simple process of
slicing the extra laud from the area of the allotments
which were to be offered for sale. Near where the
Customs House now stands river frontage was reserved
for a public quay. The freehold of the frontage from
there to Breakfast Creek was to be held by the Crown,
so that the quay might be extended as the demand
increased. A space in the centre of the town, where the
female factory had stood, was retained as a public
reserve. Unfortunately, neither of these reservations
was maintained. The Government in Sydney sold the
river frontage, and the first Queensland Ministry sold
the open space, which rightly might be termed the lungs
of the embryo city. The general planning of the town
appears to have been aimed at securing the maximum
financial return from the sale of land rather than
at meeting the probable needs of posterity.
The first sale of Moreton Bay land was held in
Sydney on December 7, 1842 ; whilst the first land sale
held in Brisbane took place on August 9, 1843.
As is usual with transactions of this kind in new places,
something of a boom set in. Only twelve months before
New South Wales had suffered from an acute financial
depression; but this did not prevent the Sydney specu-
lators giving for blocks they had never seen prices quite
unjustified by the population, industry, or immediate
prospects of the place. The high values created by
buyers to some extent were based on the absurdly glow-
ing official reports published by the Government of the
blocks to be disposed of and of the natural resources at
the back of them. The spirit of romance of a new town
in a remote and little-known country fired the imagina-
tion of bidders, and there was everything present to
appeal to the gambling instinct of those who could afford
to risk money. Most of the buyers had no serious inten-
tion of ever casting eyes on their holdings; but all were
inspired with desire for an early and substantial
unearned increment. To sell land was then the Govern-
ment’s favourite way of raising revenue; to buy land
was the most attractive speculation open to lawyers,
merchants, and city dwellers generally. Yet as late
as 1846 the white population of the whole Moreton Bay
district consisted of but 2,257 people.
During the early forties the chief means of com-
munication between Brisbane and Ipswich was by boat
and punt, and this means of transport held a practical
monopoly till a Darling Downs squatter, named
Pearce, purchased a steamer, “The Experiment,”
which traded for a while up and down the
river, but ultimately foundered. Coal had been dis-
covered on the banks of the Bremer and the Brisbane
as early as 1837, but in 1843 a plentiful supply was
found at Redbank, and a seam was opened there.
With the abolition of the convict settlement, the
office of Commandant for Moreton Bay became
superfluous, and was abolished. During the sixteen years
of the penal era there had been eight Commandants,
their names and dates of office being as follows:
Capt. Miller—lß24.
Capt. Bishop—lß24 to 1825.
Capt. Logan—lß2s to 1830.
Capt. Clunie —1830 to 1835.
Capt. Fyans —1835 to 1837.
Major Cotton —1837 to 1839.
Lieut. Gravett —May, 1839, to July, 1839.
Lieut. Gorman —1839 to 1840.
Among official heads appointed during that most
gloomy period of the colony’s life should be mentioned
the name of Andrew Petrie, who became foreman of
works in the Royal Engineers’ Department in 1837.
The last-named official was sent out, with Mr. H.
S. Russell, in a small brig, to explore the northern
rivers. On May 17, 1842, they entered the Mary.
Partly as a result of this expedition, Mr. James Charles
Burnett was dispatched six years later to examine
further the Wide Bay district. Included in his report
the following passage occurs: —“Although Wide Bay
had an excellent harbour for coasters, and would in
time become a place of great importance, it would never
be able to compete with Moreton Bay for harbourage
of ships of large tonnage.” The first town, Mary-
borough, was formed in this region in 1848. The River
Burnett received its name by direction of Queen Vic-
toria, as a mark of recognition of the value of the
services rendered by the surveyor-explorer. Burnett-
died in the year 1854, when only thirty-six years of
age, from the results of exposure while on duty in an
open boat for twenty-three days. The young man had
a remarkably brilliant career, having risen rapidly in
the Surveyor-General’s Department, until at an early
age he was in charge of the departmental work in the
area now forming the State of Queensland. During
exploration work on the Mary River two escaped con-
victs were discovered living among the blacks. One of
these had regained his liberty while young, and was
found by Messrs. Andrew 7 Petrie and H. Stuart Russell,
Hon. Mr. Wriotherley, and Mr. Jallath, in 1837. The
runaway had forgotten almost how to speak his own
language. The other escaped convict had lived with
the tribe on two occasions—once for seven years, and, at
the time of his rescue, for eighteen months. That these
men should have been kindly treated by the savages
stands in striking contrast to the state of continuous
warfare which at a somewhat later date characterized
the relationship existing between the races. In 1859 it
was estimated that no fewer than 300 white people had
been murdered on the Burnett by the aborigines. Years
before then a strong force of native police, gathered
up from the various distant tribes had been stationed
in the neighbourhood, and were paid for by the local


squatters. The force was selected from the natives of
many localities, as by that means danger of mutiny
was reduced to a minimum. Conflicts in the Burnett
district were numerous, and, as an origin of the
hostilities, it can hardly be denied that the crimes
of certain low-grade white men formed an important
factor.
The hostility of the blacks certainly formed one of
the most serious difficulties with which the early settlers
of the Moreton Bay and Darling Downs districts had
to contend. Rarely has it happened that invading
civilization has met savage native tribes without blood-
shed. Very much of the fault lay with the newcomers,
who frequently attacked the natives as a result of fear,
and who, for offences committed, sought reprisals not
necessarily against the actual culprits, but against whole
were massacred by savages at “Cullinlaaringo” Station
in Queensland. In 1839, fifteen shepherds and stock-
men were killed on Liverpool Plains.
From the days of the earliest settlement of Port
Jackson the white men had learned to distrust the
aborigines. The distrust led to aggression and to fur-
ther retaliation on the part of the blacks. Right back
in 1788 six convicts and two soldiers were murdered at
Port Jackson, in retaliation for having ill-treated five
native women at Rushcutter’s Bay. The men were
cutting rushes when attacked, and from the incident
the bay obtained the name it to-day possesses. A
horrible massacre took place on the Dawson River in
1857, when a Mr. Fraser, his wife, children, and
governess were all butchered. The natives paid the
penalty of this by sixty of their number being shot.

tribes. Sometimes the real offenders escaped quite free,
whilst numbers of their countrymen, as well as women
and children, were shot down. Once the warfare had
begun, the news of the enmity of the whites spread
over the country more rapidly than did the expansion
of settlement, and assaults, which were sometimes only
too successful, were frequently launched by the original
holders of the country against numerically powerful
bodies of Britons. For instance, in 1838, in southern
New South Wales, a party of eighteen men travelling
with sheep to Port Phillip was attacked, with the
result that seven men were killed and one wounded.
In the same year twenty-eight men, women, and
children were murdered on Mr. Henry Dangar’s station
on Myall Creek. As late as 1861 H. S. Wills, his over-
seer Baker, the latter’s two sons, and eleven other people
In revenge for the murder of Wills and his party, the
police and others slaughtered about 170 natives in the
Medway Ranges, Queensland. This retaliation may
have been the only means of protection left to the
settlers on the outposts of civilization; but it took the
nature of general warfare rather than of any effort to
apply justice to individuals.
Before Moreton Bay was declared a free settlement
the murders of white people, both individually and in
groups, had been of such frequent occurrence that the
early settlers were in a state of nerves, so far as the
blacks were concerned, and they frequently viewed any
contact between the races as an opportunity for deliver-
ing the first blow. The murders of Captain Logan and
of the exploring party near Mount Lindsay provided
cases in point.


The free settlers of Moreton Bay did not have long
to wait before a concerted attack was made upon a
large party of whites. In the year 1843 seventeen
men, with ten loaded drays, were journeying westward,
and at the spot which is now known as Helidon they were
attacked by a numerous body of savages. The white
men ran away, leaving a large quantity of booty to the
aggressors. No doubt this unfortunate result of the
conflict tended to give boldness to future efforts of a
like kind. The natives gained contempt for the power
of their enemies to resist them, and they had obtained
a rich reward from an effort at massacre. Had a deter-
mined resistance been made, more good would have
resulted than could possibly accrue from any punitive
expedition, which, in inflicting reprisals, probably 0 n
the wrong people, could serve only to inflame the
passions of the aborigines over a large area, and so
extend the feeling of hate. The spot chosen for the
attack was certainly suitable to the savages, and the
authorities, at the request of the settlers, afterwards
stationed there a detachment of soldiers from the 28th,
58th, and 99th Regiments. This was maintained in the
locality for three years afterwards, and at the end of
that time it was withdrawn, the need of its continuance
apparently having disappeared. As a result of the
capture of the drays, a kind of drive of the blacks was
organized by the local settlers. A large body of the
natives was driven to the top of Hay’s Peak, which is
liberally strewn with basalt boulders. The pursued men
impeded the attack by rolling huge stones down the hill-
side upon the attackers. However, many of the natives
were shot.
In 1848 an official estimate put the black population
of Australia down at 3,000,000, whilst in 1788 Governor
Phillip calculated that 1,000,000 savages inhabited the
wilds of New South Wales. The district of Moreton
Bay was calculated to hold 4,000 savages, and the
Darling Downs 500. Even Fraser Island was known to
be populated by about 2,000 natives. The tribes pos-
sessed means of rapid communication, and held con-
siderable powers of mobility. For an intended massacre
they could concentrate large numbers, and the character
of the bush naturally favoured an attacking party,
which might readily ambush, or unseen in the night
draw a steadily narrowing circle about a camp fire or
homestead hut. In some cases the blacks had obtained
possession of firearms. The general result of all this
was for some of the settlers to think little more
of shooting a black man when they saw him than they
would have thought of dispatching a wild dog. But
the worst offence against the original inhabitants of the
country took the form of deliberate and wholesale poison-
ing. If any extenuating circumstance can be urged to
lessen the blackness of such a crime, it must be found
in the settler’s knowledge that he often had to leave his
wife and children with inadequate protection, and his
firm and not unreasonable belief that the savages would
attack and massacre his loved ones if they saw a chance.
It mattered not to him how the enmity between blacks
and whites had begun. Protection of self and family
is a first law of Nature. He was alone in a wilderness,
and far alike from the protecting and restraining hand
of the law.
The first recorded case of the wholesale poisoning
of blacks is claimed to have taken place at Kilcoy
Station, on the Brisbane River. Arsenic was mixed
with food which was given to members of the tribe, and
wholesale fatality resulted. This occurred in 1842.
The incident was followed by greatly increased hostility
on the part of the savages, though both murders and
massacres had taken place at a prior date at Moreton
Bay as well as in other parts of New South Wales.
Controversy has centred round whether the report
of this case is true or not; but its accuracy was cer-
tainly believed in a few years afterwards by Dr. Lang,
who then published his work “Cooksland.” Mr. C.
Hodgkinson, of the New South Wales Survey Office, also
published a book on the northern districts of the colony,
and refers to the “ridiculous improbability” of the
story, but does not appear to have made any satisfac-
tory analysis of the evidence. At almost the same time,
a case of the poisoning of blacks on a large scale was
reported from the Clarence River. On this occasion
more than seventy of the unfortunate savages are
claimed to have perished in agony as a result of eating
arsenic mixed with cakes which white men had given
to them. A person suspected of perpetrating the crime
was arrested and taken in custody to Sydney, where he
was ultimately discharged through lack of legal evidence
against him. The testimony of a native could not be
accepted by a court of law. That the authorities recog-
nized the occurrence of crimes against aborigines, and
also the great difficulty of sheeting home charges on the
evidence of white men, was demonstrated in 1839, when
the local Council passed an Act to permit of aboriginal
natives being treated as competent witnesses in criminal
cases. The measure was negatived by the Imperial
Government, and with its defeat vanished all reasonable
chance of sheeting home to the culprits crimes against
the aborigines. That poisoning did occur in the
Moreton Bay district is to-day as certain as that it took
place in Port Phillip Bay district and in other parts of
the continent when blacks and whites were in deadly
conflict. In regard to the latter statement, the testi-
mony of Mr. Robinson, Protector of Aborigines at Port
Phillip, may be quoted. In 1845, in his official capacity,
that gentleman declared there was “reason to fear that
the aborigines have been poisoned, and the ends of
justice defeated for want of legal evidence.” A Select
Committee of the Queensland Legislative Assembly took


evidence on the subject of poisoning in 1861, when a
magistrate was asked:—“You have stated that it is
through fear that many of the cruelties are perpetrated
upon the blacks, which appears to me rather inconsistent.
Will you explain your meaning more clearly ?” The
witness replied: —“I have known in former times on
the Macintyre, where two or three men might be living
on a station together, who would employ the blacks and
give them rations and tobacco. Well, these men would
be frightened out of their lives by the blacks, and not
being strong enough to go out and fight them, and being
always in a state of fear, they would pop a gun through
the slabs of the hut and fire upon them, and perhaps
kill a blackfellow; at other times they would put poison
in a damper and give it to the blacks. It was never
the case when the stations were strongly manned, and
therefore, as I said before, fear of the blacks was
the chief cause of these
murders.”
Before the same Select
Committee evidence was also
given by one of the men
who had been on Kilcoy Sta-
tion at the time of the
alleged poisoning there. This
witness said that the blacks
had been troublesome while
he was on the holding, and
two of the hands had been
murdered by them. The sta-
tion belonged to Sir Evan
Mackenzie. The follow-
ing questions and answers
passed:
“During your residence
were there any of the blacks
poisoned or reported to be
poisoned ? I heard some-
thing of that, but not until after we left. I first heard
of it from Mr. Merewether. I travelled with him in
the same steamer with Sir George Gipps. Mr. Merewether
began talking with me about the blacks, and gave me
some particulars. I had not the slightest idea before
that such a thing had occurred at all, but it must have
happened while I was there.
“Do you remember hearing anything of the sort
while you were at the station ?—I remember the overseer
saying to me one day, ‘Don’t you think it would be a
good thing to give those fellows a dose V Of course, I
expressed my abhorrence at the suggestion, and no more
was said about it. I never heard anything further on
the subject.”
Further evidence on the same point was gathered
by Mr. Andrew Petrie and his companions on their
expedition into the Wide Bay district. The two run-
away convicts whom, as already mentioned, the explorers
found living among the blacks, their names being Davis
and Bracefield, told Mr. Petrie that if he journeyed
further to the northward the natives would attack him
out of revenge for their countrymen to the south having
been poisoned by white men. This was corroborated by
the blacks among whom the fugitives had been living.
Somewhat analagous testimony came to light through
the experience of the Rev. Mr. Schmidt, who was at
the head of the German Mission Station which Dr.
Lang had been instrumental in having established. Mr
Schmidt had set out for the Bunya Bunya country to
see if the removal of the mission would be practicable.
While traversing the territory regarded among the
aborigines as belonging to the tribe among whom the
mission was established, all went well; but as soon
as he entered the domain of another tribe, the dark
companions whom he had
taken with him refused to
advance. The reason given
by them was that a number
of the tribe through whose
territory the route lay had
been poisoned at a local
station, and that either
black or white stranger
entering upon the region
was henceforth liable to
be murdered in retaliation.
In his official report to
Dr. Lang, Mr. Schmidt
describes the incident in
the following terms;
“There was also another
reason wdiich influenced
greatly our natives against
going any further, viz.,
a large number of natives
(about fifty or sixty) having been poisoned at
one of the squatters’ stations. The neighbouring tribes
are going, we are told, to attack and kill the whites
whenever they meet any.” Ultimately the missionary
made his way through the country of the hostile tribe
by enlisting the sympathies and aid of some of them-
selves. Dr. Lang declares that the story of the poisoning
was not news to Mr. Schmidt. Similar information had
been gathered from other tribes and carried to the
mission station by the lay brethren, and Mr. Schmidt
himself had heard the poisoning talked of in Brisbane.
On the other hand, it had been suggested by Mr.
Hodgkinson that “according to the account of the
squatters it would appear that some sheep, diseased and
scabby, had been dressed as usual with arsenic, which,
with corrosive sublimate, is the ordinary remedy for
scab. These sheep had been rushed by the blacks, and
ABORIGINE THROWING A SPEAR.
7

a number of them carried off, and it is supposed that
the arsenic caused the death of some of the thieves.”
This explanation, however, was too thin to carry any
weight. For any number of men to be poisoned in this
way they would have had to eat the sheep with
skin and wool on, which the blacks certainly would not
have done. On every occasion on which the deaths
were referred to by the natives in conversation with
white men the whole point of their story was based on
the poisoning occurring after the eating of food volun-
tarily given to them. The poison used was new to
them, and the death it produced quite novel in form to
their experiences. Even were it likely for members of a
number of separate tribes at different times to concoct
the same tale, how could they imagine just such
a kind of death as results
from taking arsenic? The
plain fact is that the wilds
of the bush hid many
pathetic tragedies where
whole tribes writhed in the
agonies of a long-drawn and
horrible death. There was
little wonder that the
blacks, with their means of
ready communication, soon
became determined, as a
body, to spear the sheep
and cattle of the new-
comers and to assail their
persons whenever oppor-
tunity arose.
Some of the early squat-
ters brought discredit upon
themselves from among con-
temporary and later-day
critics by their opposition to
any public enquiry into the
allegations which were made.
People naturally wanted
to know what the settlers had to hide, and if indi-
viduals had themselves done nothing to be ashamed of,
did they sympathize with the crimes of others, which
they apparently were trying to cloak with a veil of
obscurity? The late Mr. Coote, in his “History of
Queensland,” believes that the employers prohibited the
poisoning of blacks, but that their employes were
responsible for the evil deeds. He wrote:—“l do not
suppose that Sir Evan Mackenzie was at the time per-
sonally cognizant of the atrocity of his men, or that
he would not have always forbidden its practice. But
what every right-minded man must regret is the deter-
mined opposition to any real enquiry by which every
charge of the kind was met, the palliations offered on
behalf of the accused, and the half-defiant and slighting
manner in which the accusations were put by. From
this sort of procedure the actual murderers derived
encouragement. They concluded that while their
employers prohibited the crime, they had little anxiety
to secure its detection, and less scruple in profiting by
its commission. Had the squatters of Moreton Bay
in 1842 been wise in their generation they would have
insisted on an investigation, which would have rendered
impossible the suspicions which were not frequently and
ungenerously directed against them from hostile
quarters. It might have been troublesome; but the
convenient is one thing, the prudent and far-seeing
another.”
With the declaration of Moreton Bay as a free
settlement Lieutenant Gorman, who was the last of
the penal commandants, left
for Sydney. This was in
March of 1842. The highest
authority in the district
then passed into the hands
of Dr. Simpson, who had
previously occupied the
position of Crown Lands
Commissioner for the same
region. In the following
November, Captain J. C.
Wickham was appointed
Police Magistrate to the
little community, among
whom there was little of
such conflict as finds its
way into a court of law.
On June 23, 1843, the
settlers of Moreton recorded
their first vote to the Parlia-
ment of New South Wales.
But the electorate also in-
cluded Port Macquarie and
the Upper Hunter, so that
the voice of the people
of Brisbane and the Darling Downs proved a very
slender influence in moulding the evolution of public
affairs. Nor, indeed, were the pioneering settlers keenly
desirous for playing any active part in political affairs.
Ihe selection of the electorate fell upon Mr. Alexander
Macleay, who for many years had filled the Speaker’s
chair in the old nominee Council, which up till that
date filled the place-of a legislative body in New South
Wales.
The election of 1843 was of historical interest to the
whole of the colony, as well as to the infant settlement
of Moreton Bay. In an earlier chapter the evolution of
the constitution has been traced. It will be recollected
that on January 1, 1843, an Imperial Act arrived in
Sydney constituting a Legislative Council of fifty-four
ALLAN CUNNINGHAM, THE DISCOVERER OF CUNNINGHAM GAP.
8
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


members, of whom thirty-six were to be elected and
eighteen to be nominated by the Crown. The eighteen
were to include the Colonial Treasurer, the Auditor-
General, the Attorney-General, the Collector of Customs,
and the Commander of the Forces. This was the first
achievement in the establishment of representative
government in New South Wales. But the step had
not gone very far. The qualification for an elector was
that he must own freehold to the value of £2OO, or
must occupy property assessed at not less than £2O per
annum. No person could become a member of the
Council unless owning freehold worth £2,000 or being
in receipt of an income derivable from property of at
least £IOO per annum. Even with these conservative
political storms of the time. Moreover, news reached
them so slowly and so irregularly that events were
mostly over and done with before these pioneers heard
of the discussions centring round them.
The Leslies, James Leith Hay, and Arthur Hodg-
son, the first settlers on the Darling Downs, were soon
followed by others who had been attracted by stories
of the wonderful fertility of that rich district, and
during the early forties the drays from these pioneers
kept visiting Brisbane in increasing numbers. After
the first vehicles had negotiated Cunningham Gap in
1840 it was considered more desirable by the squatters
to make the difficult but short journey to Moreton Bay
rather than the long-drawn and tedious expedition to
CUNNINGHAM GAP, THE DISCOVERY OF WHICH PROVIDED A DIRECT ROAD FROM THE DARLING DOWNS TO BRISBANE.
safeguards the Council was not entrusted with the
power of the purse, which was reserved to Imperial
authority. All money Bills were to originate with the
Governor, whilst a Civil list of £BI,OOO per annum and
the control of Crown lands, a chief source of revenue,
were kept outside the ambit of the Council’s powers. A
rather bitter controversy arose in Sydney and other
centres of population at the character of the constitution
given to the community. The majority of the people
wanted wider powers for controlling their own affairs,
and particularly in the management of the Crown
lands, the occupation of which was so vital a factor in
the development of the colony. But settlers in Moreton
Bay were too few and too scattered to take part in the
Sydney. A factor in conducing to this decision lay in
the reduced risk of attacks from blacks in a short, as
compared with the long, journey. When traversing the
territory inhabited by hostile tribes, no condition could
be more dangerous than that of slow procedure, and
laden vehicles could never cover the ground rapidly.
Sir Thomas Mitchell, the most consistently successful
of all Australian explorers, laid it down as an axiom
that rapidity of movement was the best way to avoid
attack. With a mobile party he could be gone from a
district before the local savages could plan or concentrate
an assault. But a tribe could follow travelling stock or
laden drays. Keeping out of sight, the blacks might be
but a mile or so behind and closer by night, perhaps

Brisbane began to benefit at an early date from the
slowly increasing trade coming from over the Main
Range, whilst stations began to be formed between
the highlands and the sea. On July 20, 1846, Moreton
Bay was declared a warehousing port. But for the
whole of the forties the trade from Brisbane went to
Sydney by means of such small vessels as were trading
between the two ports; and not until February, 1851,
was the first direct shipment of wool made to England.
The first Government emigrant ship, the “Artimesia,”
arrived on December 13, 1848, and the first exile ship,
the “Mount Stuart Elphinstone,” on October 13, 1849,
CHAPTER XIV.
TIME OF TRANSITION.
The period in the history of settlement following
the removal of convicts from Brisbane may be termed
the time of transition. It was the pause of the athlete
before he dashes forward. Yet, although there was no
sudden leap into prosperity nor the rapid advance
destined to follow the granting of a constitution and
self-government to the vast territory named Moreton
Bay, facts show that the colonists were busy, while
industry and enterprise were alike present. It is only
by comparison with later periods that progress during
the forties seems to have been slow. In truth, what was
done demonstrates the lack of foresight on the part of
the Home Government, or rather of some members of
the Ministry, in striving to force semi-transportation on
the settlement, as on New South Wales, against the
wishes of the majority of the people.
That energy and enterprise were at work may be
seen by a glance at the statistics of export from Brisbane
to Sydney for the year ending July 31, 1844, the third
year of the existence of Moreton Bay as a free settle-
ment. The exports were 150 tierces of beef, 440 hides,
1,998|- bales of wool, 296 casks of tallow, 2,458 sheep
skins, and 3,418 pine boards. In the main the products
of the new settlement were despatched by steamer, but
the fact that two schooners were also employed for the
shipment shows that the days of small things had not
passed. Dr. Lang, who published these returns in his
work, “Cooksland,” calculated the exportation of wool
two years later on the basis of an annual increase of one-
third, at 3,500 bales. As the bales weighed on an
average 300 lbs., at Is. 6d. per lb. the value of the wool
from the Brisbane River for the year ending July 31,
1846, would represent a value of £78,750. Against this
satisfactory evidence of sound progress in production
made by the infant free settlement we can place for
comparison the fact that the overseers in the preceding
penal days had difficulty in finding work for the con-
victs, and hence, perhaps, the reason for the denudation
in regard to cedar which took place on the alluvial flats
of rivers accessible to convict labour.
Again, we obtain a glimpse of sound progress in
a perusal of a return of livestock in the settlement on
January 1, 1846. It was as follows:
During the year 1846-7 the exports from Brisbane
exceeded £IOO,OOO. The partnership between man and
Nature had been ratified, and the free settlement in
unmistakable terms had given a reason for its existence.
The return of wool at this period has more than a
passing interest for us, in view of the fact that there
was at the time great doubt in the minds of pastoralists
in the South as to whether wool would not seriously
deteriorate in the subtropical climate of the northern
district. Perchance, this doubt proved in the ultimate
an advantage, for it assuredly had the tendency to
eliminate from the ranks of prospective settlers all
who were not prepared to bid boldly for fortune and
determined to win through. Many of the squatters of
the early days may have been somewhat shortsighted
in their desire to prolong the stay among them of
quasi convicts, but for the manner in which all went
forth into the wilds, struggling to secure that of which
Ave are the heirs, there can be nothing but heartfelt
admiration.
In the forties it is interesting to note that the
stations, eastward of the Main Range, were stocked with
both sheep and cattle, while on the Downs for the most
part sheep were reared. The sheep on the stations on
the further side of the Dividing Range were divided into
flocks of 2,000 or 2,500, this course being pursued by
reason of the open nature of the country, while in the
case of forest land, even if lightly timbered, the flocks
were of necessity reduced to 800. Labour was a very


important factor to the squatter in the planning of his
pastoral enterprise, and in the lesser cost of shepherding
on the Downs we have another practical reason for the
pushing of enterprise into the less known and less safe
districts. Spoils are to the victors in the conquest of
Nature as in the field of war. The area of land com-
prising a station was usually 120 square miles, and, as
in later days, the pioneers chose their homes so that a
creek flowed through their country.
It was, indeed, no wonder that the pastoral
industry attracted so many adventurous spirits, for
nowhere, perhaps, had Nature so much to offer to the
hardy pioneer. Mr. Kent, Commissary-General of
Moreton Bay in its penal days, found no fewer than
seventeen different species of grasses in seed simul-
taneously, while the fertility of the land was another
incentive to development.
In the days of which we
write it was calculated that
10 acres would graze three
sheep, while Mr. Kent, we
are told, depastured 6,000
sheep during a period of
eighteen months on 5,000
acres of land situated on
the Logan River, a part of
the settlement which has
well fulfilled the promise of
early days.
The returns of products
shipped to Sydney, and
which we referred to, have
a noteworthy link with a
very important new de-
parture which did so much
to safeguard and foster
the pastoral industry in
Australia. It is, indeed,
very probable that if
Mr. H. O'Brien, of Yass,
New South Wales, had not devised a means of
disposing of surplus stock by boiling down the carcases,
the history of Australia—and with it that of Queens-
land—might have been very different. From the
statistics given, setting forth the despatch to Port
Jackson of tierces of beef and casks of tallow, it is
obvious that what may be termed the export of meat
had begun, while boiling-down was in operation among
the pastoralists of Moreton Bay and its hinterland.
We learn, indeed, that there was a boiling-down estab-
lishment at Kangaroo Point, venerable mother of the
Queensland pastoral products export trade. For the
increase in flocks and herds, with the absence of a
developing market, save for wool, hides, and tallow —
all that could bear the long sea voyage—threatened
depression through over-production. The happy thought
of adapting means to an end by boiling down carcases
was thus a gift of genius to Australia, for it bridged
the period of critical infancy and carried the settle-
ments successfully on to the discovery of gold, when
so great an advance was to take place. Mr. H. O’Brien,
of Yass, builded better than he knew, and it may be
said that the boiling-down process was as essential in
those days to the development of the pastoral industry
as is the refrigerating chamber to-day.
The forties also saw attention devoted to another
very important industry, and Mr. Andrew Petrie did
admirable service in investigating the great resources
of wealth which the northern settlement had in its
native woods. It is interesting to recall that Mr. Petrie
informed Dr. Lang that the Moreton Bay pine, grow-
ing to a height of 100 and
even 150 feet, would be
more valuable than the
Canadian timber, and ex-
perience has shown that he
was not wrong in his judg-
ment. Of the bunya bunya,
the Araucaria Bidwilli, Mr.
Petrie said, "I was the first
person to risk my life with
others in procuring the first
plants of this tree, and Mr.
Bid well, after whom it was
named, was some years after
me." The cutting of red
cedar under the convict
system, to which we have
alluded, was the forerunner
of another and much greater
industry, that of sugar-cane
cultivation, for as boiling
down was the embryo whence
grew the frozen meat trade,
so cedar-getting was the
avant - coureur of sugar - growing on the Brisbane
River, the Logan to the south, the waterways to
the north, and, indeed, in the whole of the
tropical and subtropical littoral. Mr. Petrie
proved how logically sound was his opinion as to the
value to be attached to ironbark and blue gum trees.
He refers to boxwood, and rose (or violet) wood, noting
in passing that the aborigines, who used the latter for
spears, knew the art of straightening it. Silky oak,
or silk oak, as Mr. Petrie termed it, would, he con-
sidered, be found of value in sheathing vessels and for
many other purposes. It was not given to those who
then wrote to picture silky oak as one of the most valued
of woods for artistic work in furniture. Forest oak,
known as beefwood, was used principally for firewood,
MR. ANDREW PETRIE.


although tool handles and bullock yokes were made of
it. The tulip wood is also mentioned as being valuable
for cabinet work and turning.
A glimpse at the home surroundings of settlers in
those days shows that the rough conditions which one
naturally pictures were often modified and amelior-
ated. Dr. Lang helps us to realize things as they could
be. Speaking of Captain Griffin’s station on North Pine
River, the Doctor said; “In the garden I observe
banana, pineapple, and orange trees growing luxuriously,
along with the common English potatoes, the sweet
potatoes, cabbages, Cape gooseberries, strawberries,
melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, and French beans.”
The beginnings of the wheat-growing industry in
the early years of free settlement are well worthy of
recalling, although Dr. Lang was hardly correct in
expressing his conviction that the seaboard of the
Stanley district was admirably adapted to the growth
of wheat. On a station, however, belonging to Mr.
Donald Ross, twenty-three miles from Ipswich, on the
road to the Gap, a quantity of wheat was grown, as
Dr. Lang tells us, the average produce of which was
30 bushels per acre. And the Doctor added ; “I learned
from an intelligent squatter on the Darling Downs that
the produce in that district is at least equally great.”
It is not difficult to realize that at the time of writing
maize was a never-failing crop at Moreton Bay, the
return on alluvial land being at the rate of 80 bushels
per acre : while with a small variety, named Cobbet’s
corn, three successive crops had been grown in the
same ground in a year. One ponders whether one of
the reasons given why maize up to that time had been
very little used still pertains : for it was the custom to
give it in the form of meal as a ration to the convicts
in New South Wales. Of arrowroot, the mulberry tree
for sericulture, tobacco, indigo, and cotton, those who
did yeoman service with their pen in advancing the
country speak with enthusiasm. Indigo planting was
overtaken and outdistanced by the discoveries in aniline
dyes, and it cannot be said to have materialized in
Australia to any practical extent, while Dr. Lang’s
blazoning of cotton as the future staple industry of
the northern settlement has not been realized. The
chequered career of the cotton industry requires special
examination. Meanwhile, even a hurried glance at
life as it was in the part of Australia which was to
evolve into Queensland cannot be complete without
the knowledge of what those who worked so strenuously
for progress thought and longed for. In his optimism
concerning sugar-growing, Dr. Lang did not belie his
sagacity, but he was before the times when he attempted
in 1849 to form a company with a capital of £IO,OOO,
in a thousand shares to inaugurate sugar-growing. He
suffered the fate of those who anticipate the future.
Something has been said to show that enterprise
and fortitude were doing much in aid of progress
through pioneering work, and we can best grasp how
matters were by learning a little of the heart of things.
In Stanley (all the country east of the Dividing Range)
there were at the time of which we write (1846) 41
houses of brick and 214 of wood. In North Brisbane
the citizens numbered 483, and in South Brisbane 346,
The population of Ipswich was 143, while scattered
among the stations were 452 persons. In addition 185
men were employed in the civil and military services.
Of the total population of Stanley in 1859 477 were
women. Judged by modern thought, the educational
standard was not high, for 538 persons could not read,
while 857 could read and write. Of the fourteen clergy-
men who find place in the statistics only two appear to-
have pursued their sacred calling, one belonging to the
Anglican communion and the other to that of the
Roman Church. Law had six representatives, and
medicine a similar number. There were thirteen “other
educated persons,” the standard by which the latter
were measured being obviously a university status.
Very significant in comparing then and now is the
statement that only twenty-three persons in the county
of Stanley were engaged in agriculture. There were in
all 658 settlers on the Darling Downs, of whom 107
were females. Of those, as a whole, 147 could neither
read nor write. There was only one doctor in the
Darling Downs district. A ray of light on circumstances
as they were in Brisbane is given in the fact that the
one clergyman of the Church of England found his
territory so vast that he could only occasionally come
into town on Saturday night for service on Sunday
morning, his duties in the bush being either resumed
later in the day, or on Monday morning. This seems
quite like the record of church work in some tiny
township in the backblocks of to-day, and nothing,
perhaps, could so readily give us the right focus in
looking at life in old Brisbane as the figures and facts-
we have mentioned. That was the time of small things,
but the men—the pioneers—were not small in their
work. “There were giants in those days.”
Yet another aid in visualizing things as they were
may be obtained from the scale of wages, and small as
they seem to our modern ideas we must remember that
they were much higher than the rates paid in Great
Britain contemporaneously. The ruling waves were
as follow:—For married couples, with rations, per
annum, £3O; single men, £2O with rations; domestics,
£l4. Shearers were paid £3 3s. per week. Even then
the shearer made his presence and importance felt.
The necessity for systematizing control and adminis-
tration in conformity with the progress already attained
is shown forth by the constitution of pastoral districts


in November, 1848. Those divisions for pastoral pur-
poses comprised Moreton, Darling Downs, Gwydir,
Wide Bay, Burnett, and Maranoa. Yet another sign-
post in regard to progress was the establishment of a
post office at the place which was not long afterwards
to be the “Old Township” of Maryborough.
In 1846 there was given a great impetus to progress
in the establishment of The Moreton Bay Courier, and
from that time onward there existed a journalistic
medium for expressing public opinion. It is not
too much to say that the relation of Moreton Bay
to Sydney and the overshadowing influence that
resulted from it, began first to be beneficially
modified to a marked extent by the advent of
the Press. The beginning of Queensland journalism
was represented by a sheet of four small pages
which first saw the light under the eaves of
a building at the intersection of Queen and Albert
Streets. To the co-operation of Mr. A. S.
Lyon, a man
well qualified by
•energy and educa-
tion for the work,
and Mr. J ames
Swan, a printer
who came from
Sydney to aid the
direction of the
undertaking, The
Courier owed its
existence.
The power of
the Press was ex-
ercised in a very
utilitarian manner
within a short
time of its first appearance, for it was urged that
banking facilities should be extended to Moreton
Bay. Again there had been an exhibition of lack
of care and consideration for those who, being
remote, received for that reason scant attention,
which distance in some minds and some enter-
prises seems to justify. For the system adopted
by the Sydney banking institutions of placing the
minimum amount of a cheque at £2, gave much
umbrage, and so much feeling, indeed, was aroused
that the minimum was reduced to £l. As the result of
the need of meeting difficulties, which must have arisen
daily, devices were adopted, one of them being the
extensive use of "calabashes,” or orders, for payment
by the drawer. In this system, often applied to veiy
small sums, there was obviously a serious danger of loss,
while that in turn led to high charges for discounting.

advance the country of which he was so proud, and

whose unfinished work on Queensland is like a
symmetrical broken column in memorial, says in that
book: “I recollect that so late as 1860 I received in
change at one hotel in Toowoomba an order for 13s. 6d.
drawn upon a Sydney firm by a late Colonial Treasurer,
which order was then three years old, and in the
multitude of its endorsements looked like a collection
of autographs, not of the most intelligent style.” The
journalistic appeal for the institution of a bank was
timely, yet delay clogged the wheels of progress for
four years.
In another sphere, that of sport, The Courier
played its part, and perchance it may be deemed
significant that an influential factor in the social life
of the coming community should find its place in
the first issue of the journal, for the initial
number of the first newspaper in North-eastern Aus-
tralia contained a report of the Moreton Bay
annual races. Developments in yet another direction
also took place, for
during the same
annual period a
regatta was success-
fully held. Quite a
modern toucli is
given to the far-
ofT event in horse
racing in the com-
plaints that Ips-
wich and the back
countries held
aloof.
It is worthy of
record that eleven
years (1857) after-
wards the control of
The Courier passed to Mr. Charles Lilley, who with
Mr. Belbridge, a printer, rented it. Mr. Lilley
subsequently became Chief Justice of Queensland,
being known to a future generation as Sir Charles
Lilley. Mr. Lyon in 1849 established another
journal, The Moreton Bay Free Press, which
became under its editor’s guidance the advocate for
exile labour. In 1859 Mr. Lyon entered on a new
journalistic venture, The Darling Downs Gazette, the
first issue of which appeared in Drayton in June of
that year. Ipswich, not to be outdone by other centres
of influence in the Settlement, called to its aid The
Ipswich Herald. This year was also noteworthy in
the annals of literature for the first issue of "Pugh’s
Almanac” in Brisbane, which has grown with the
passage of years and the progress of the country,
maintaining a high reputation for faithfulness in its
records and general utility as a compendium of
information.


It is worthy of note, in the obstruction offered by
departmentalism, that Lord John Russell outlined a
very practical and comprehensive scheme for the Aus-
tralian Colonies, and further that Lord Grey,
realizing the coming of separation, anticipated it
so clearly that he provided for the event in pro-
posals for a loan for immigration when dealing with
the allotment of the burden of the indebtedness. It
is also just to recognize that Lord Grey foresaw the
trend of administration towards decentralization, for
though his suggestion—that councils in the several
districts should be the constituents of the legislators—
was democracy inverted, there was manifestly a groping
after that control which subsequently took the form of
local government, of which town councils were for long
the sole examples, but which broadened in Queensland
to divisional boards and, later, shire councils.
With the expansion of trade between the Brisbane
River and southern ports came the necessity for control
and regulation, and, incidentally, taxation. The last-
named object did not result immediately from the
appointment of a Collector of Customs in Brisbane
with the staff required, for the expenses of the office
during the first year outran the revenue. The Customs
Department was inaugurated on June 13, 1846.
To a small community a disaster comes always with
more stunning force than in the case of a people to
whom an extended citizenship and complex interests
bring the lightening of trial in the circumscription of
direct injury. This thought will enable us to compre-
hend the gloom which fell upon the country through
the wreck of the "Sovereign,” a steamship of the
Hunter River Company’s fleet, which sank on the bar
of the southern passage, Moreton Bay, while outward
bound to Sydney in March, 1847. Investigation
never seems to have revealed the cause of the
disaster. The important point is that the settle-
ment suffered a severe loss, for in all forty-four
persons were drowned, ten only of the total number on
board being saved, while of these latter three were
severely injured. So engrossed, however, were the
Central Authorities in Sydney with their own
immediate interests that a deaf ear was turned to the
appeal from Brisbane for the survey of the dangerous
passage. The refusal to accede to what was very
necessary was obviously dictated by niggardliness.
This was shown by the assent given to Captain
Wickham’s suggestion that he should be permitted to
superintend the survey of the channel. Yet another
neglect, due to the evil of control at a distance,
was found in the refusal of the New South Wales
Government to establish a Supreme Court judge in
Moreton Bay settlement or extend a circuit court there.
It is not difficult to understand how seriously the
administration of justice was hampered and great
inconvenience inflicted by the transference of all higher
judicial business to Sydney.
In the meantime action providing for the admin-
istration of justice in the lower courts was taken, and
the year 1847 witnessed the establishment of courts of
petty sessions at Brisbane, Ipswich, Cambooya (near
Toowoomba), Canning Downs (near Warwick), and
also at "Cressbrook,” Messrs. McConnel’s station. The
court at the last-named place was discontinued before
long.
The successful explorations by Burnett had given
a stimulus to settlement in the country watered by the
river which now bears his name, and also in that exten-
sive district through which the Mary flows. Capt. M. C.
O’Connell, who subsequently became President of the
Queensland Legislative Council, occupied the position
of Commissioner for the Burnett. Not yet did Mary-
borough take form, although stations continued to be
established and settlement was pushed further afield,
as is evidenced by the construction of a road from the
head of the Mary River to a station seventy miles
inland from the point of departure. This development
took place in 1847, and in the same year a similar
boon was granted to settlers in the south-west through
the opening of a new road across the main range and
southward of Cunningham Gap.
In Brisbane advancement went on quietly but
steadily. The hospital, which the Government at
Sydney, with a touch of cynical humour, had closed
when transportation ceased, was replaced by a building
erected on that land between George Street and North
Quay where the Supreme Court was subsequently built.
Worship in the churches was provided for by
the commencement of an edifice in George Street, which
subsequently became St. John’s Cathedral, on the site
now occupied by the Queen’s Gardens, beside the impos-
ing Executive Buildings. A Roman Catholic Church of
attractive design, as in the case of the Anglican
Communion, has given place to a cathedral more in
consonance with advanced times, but the old buildings
of either denomination will be associated in the minds
of veteran citizens with great devotion and duty on the
part of self-denying clergymen, whose services in thinly
scattered districts were always attended with great
discomfort and often by actual danger. Loyally but
resolutely the clergymen of those days pursued their
work, only knowing it was good.
As it was with Brisbane so it was beginning to be
with Drayton and Warwick, while Maryborough after-
somewhat of a pause also took form. Nothing can give
us so clear a glimpse of the unimportance of Moreton
Bay in the eyes of the older settlements in the south
as the baldly recorded fact that during the election for


representation in the Legislative Council, the only
parliamentary body in 1848, the candidates did not
consider it necessary to visit the electors whose suffrages
they sought. In all there were three counties in the
electorate, Gloucester, Stanley, and Macquarie. The
voting roll consisted of 301 persons, 81 of whom were
in Brisbane and 21 in Ipswich. All that, however, was
changed by the introduction of the bicameral system of
parliamentary government, one result of which was the
speeding-up of the movement for separation.
With the arrival of the first shipment of free
immigrants from Britain to Moreton Bay a new departure
had been taken; a milestone on the road to progress
had been passed. The subject of immigration in the
just, for the drrst of the arena no longer disturbs our
vision, and, indeed, mingles with that other dust
where small things are forgotten. Of Dr. Lang it must
be said in justice that even his mistakes, his rashness
in bearding officialdom in its den, his practical neg-
lect of authority, and we may add his forgetfulness
of the rudiments of business while engaged in carrying
out work of great moment —all these, which might have
weighed against his immigration schemes, really did
much in benefiting the country whose advancement he
had so much at heart from the time he visited Moreton
Bay in 1845. As with his successes —and he did score
successes —so was it with the criticism he aroused: the
judgment in condemnation, so often passed on him, all

settlement cannot be scanned without reference to Dr.
Lang and his work. An enthusiast, energetic and
resourceful, he seemed to find that his duties as a
minister of the Presbyterian Church did not afford
sufficient outlet for his welling-up desires to benefit
humanity and assist the advancement of Australia. No
man, however, can serve two masters, and the partner-
ship between clerical duties and political work, which
so often has been attempted and so often has failed,
found another victim in Dr. Lang. For a long time a
right perspective in regard to the man and what he did
seemed impossible, just because political object-glasses
were used. In these days, however, we can be more
made for a greater interest in that which was to become
Queensland. He was the best advertising agent that
any new country ever had, and behind his failures and
his errors there is found the incontrovertible fact that
in all that he did the intention was good. Peace to his
ashes! There was no one more willing to spend and
be spent in the service of that territory he fondly
termed Northern Australia, or Cooksland, by turns, a
country of which he was veritably enamoured. Dr.
Lang was not of those content to give his services
through his pen alone, although he did much through
his books to make known the capabilities of the settle-
ment and the lavish generosity with which Nature


had endowed it. He went home to London, and there
the per fervor Scotorum, with which he was so largely
endowed, stood him in good stead, for he would not be
denied, and Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries
were roused from somnolent content and bidden face
facts in providing for the needs of another great land
under the Southern Cross. We can picture the breezy
visitor from Australia causing dismay in the depart-
mental dovecots as he tore red tape to shreds and
concentrated all questions into three words, “Need for
men,” destined to be so fateful seventy years later.
He lectured, and voiced his views in the Press while he
was waiting the decision of headquarters, and in short
entered on an extensive emigration campaign. In all
this he was adopting just the course which has been
found in later years most effectual for directing attention
to a little-known country overseas. He had during
his visit to Moreton Bay become imbued with the
potentialities of cotton-growing, and he had been given
in the settlement facts and figures which convinced him
he was wise in inaugurating a “Cooksland Colonizing
Company” and seeking the aid of the Government for
free passages for 100 emigrants, to be selected by him-
self, to engage in cotton-planting under the company
in Moreton Bay. One of the systems in use for sending
out emigrants to Australia at that time was the right
to nominate persons for free passages on Government
vessels at the rate of one adult or two children for
every £2O placed in the hands of the Land and Immigra-
tion Commissioners in London, who administered all
such business, the money deposited being for the
purpose of purchasing land in the settlement. So far,
Lang was only acting according to one of the procedures
adopted. In basing his request to the Home Govern-
ment upon the successful formation of a company,
which was not then floated, nor in truth was ever
formed, he, however, left the region of the practical,
and his request was “turned down.” Proposals to lease
land on behalf of the company were promptly rejected,
nor can we wonder at this result in view of the facts.
Company, or no company, the emigrants were required,
in Dr. Lang’s opinion, and therefore they should go.
And so after casting to the wind all existing methods
in chartering the “Fortitude,” Dr. Lang thought he
had an assurance from Mr. Howes, Under-Secretary
for the Colonies, that the local Government would allot
to the emigrants sent out an amount of land on the basis
adopted by the Land and Immigration Commissioners,
to which we have alluded. As the Under-Secretary did
not recollect making any statement on the subject,
judgment concerning Dr. Lang’s futile action is at fault.
All that can be said is that he did think he had a
pledge in the direction indicated. It may, of course,
be conjectured that he intended to force the Govern-
ment’s hand, but if that was his design, it failed. Yet
he and the adventurers of the ‘‘Fortitude” are of special
interest to Queenslanders of to-day in view of the fact
that a very important division of the metropolis is
named after the ship, while the questions raised and
the course taken throw a great deal of light on two
important facts. One was the determination of the
Imperial Government not to listen to any proposal, or
accept any aid in furthering the advancement of a
dependency overseas, that did not come through the
official channels of routine, and we are safe in adding,
the strong presumption that officialism and vested
interests in the colony and its settlement in Moreton
Bay had effectually gained the ear of the British Govern-
ment. The other point has a somewhat melancholy
interest, for it shows beyond question that a man
possessed of high and lofty ideals, animated by the
single-minded idea of assisting the advancement of a
worthy cause, must be prepared to suffer loss in acting
up to the best and most unselfish he has in him, for
as a result of despatching six ships with emigrants to
Port Philip and Moreton Bay Dr. Lang lost, and paid,
between £3,000 and £4,000 for which he had become
responsible.
Returning to the “Fortitude,” we learn that the
Doctor, breaking through ordered methods, gave the
emigrants land orders to the value of £l6 for every £2O
received from them. To make matters worse, we are
told, that “in not a. few cases” only a portion of the
passage money (half or even less) was paid by the
emigrants to Dr. Lang or his agent, resulting in a loss
to the Doctor of £1,300, the greater part of the
indebtedness being liquidated before Dr. Lang left
London. It is acknowledged that the passengers were
well selected and the accommodation on this private
emigration ship was superior to that on the Government
vessels, while a crucial test of things being well arranged
for the emigrants on the voyage lies in the fact that
at its conclusion there were no complaints forthcoming
from anyone. Trouble, however, did not vanish from
the ship with the setting of the foretopsail at London,
for on arrival at Moreton Bay it was found that Dr.
Lang’s preference for the theoretical side of things, as
against necessary details in business, had prepared a
veritable hornet’s nest of trouble and misadventures.
The very important question of ajopointing an agent
to receive the ship and her passengers had not been
considered practically, for the gentleman to whom the
vessel was consigned declined to have anything to do
with it, while another person, to whom the Doctor
looked to take charge of the business in the settlement,
had received no advice on the subject, and had indeed
left the colony. Again, the officials in Brisbane had not
been notified of the impending arrival of the ship.
Such were the troubles into which the good ship “Forti-
tude” sailed with her 248 emigrants after a voyage


of 123 days. In addition, quarantine added its
inconvenience and delay, for two cases of fever having
occurred on board within a month of the arrival of the
ship at port, all on board were detained until pratique
was granted. And that the circumstances were not
deemed serious may be gauged by the fact that the
police magistrate ordered the ship’s people out of
quarantine after a week’s isolation. There were eight
deaths during the voyage, three adults and five children
being the victims, and in only one case was the fatal
illness fever. Under the circumstances Lord Grey was
hardly justified in stating that “they” [the emigrants]
“arrived with fever prevailing on their ship, and that
there had been several
deaths on board. I cannot
but fear,” the Secretary of
State went on to say, “that
this has arisen from the im-
perfect arrangements which
had been made for the
health and comfort of the
passengers, as such an occur-
rence is so exceedingly rare
in Australian immigration
when properly conducted
under the superintendency
of the Commissioners.”
Such was the con-
demnation of the voyage
of the “Fortitude.” We
leave our readers to judge
whether it was just in
view of the facts we
have stated. No surprise
will be excited when we
say that the Govern-
ment of New South Wales
did not favour Dr. Lang’s
land orders. All the immi-
grants, who had considered
that the circumstances jus-
tified them in settling on
unoccupied Crown land, were promptly ejected there-
from by official order. But the new arrivals suffered no
real loss or inconvenience. They had been selected by
a man well able to choose the best settlers for the
new country, and all were speedily absorbed in the
community, doubtless to their own content. The
approval expressed by the officers of the settlement
and the appreciation voiced may be left to meet the
undignified exhibition of official anger on the part of the
Secretary for the Colonies, and the no less unworthy
display of animus against Dr. Lang, of which the
despatch of Sir Charles Fitzroy gave evidence, for in
that document the fact that the “Fortitude’s” people
were quarantined is stated for the use of the Colonial
Office, while the other fact that the quarantine only
lasted a week was withheld.
It may be well to refer to later events at this stage
in order to show that Dr. Lang’s advocacy of immigra-
tion was as steadfast and lasting as it was sincere, for
in 1855, when he was a member of the Legislative
Council, he introduced a Bill for the incorporation of
the Moreton Bay Land and Immigration Company, and
the measure became law. At that time, however, a
heavy trial came to Dr. Lang, for as the result of the
discovery of a theft of ,£lO,OOO from the Bank of New
South Wales at Ballarat, Victoria, his son (who was
manager of the branch) and
another officer were arrested,
tried, found guilty, and
wrongfully condemned to
imprisonment with hard
labour. Young Lang’s
father, who was eager in
championing his son, was
dragged into the maelstrom
of suffering, for as the
result of his remarks on
the case he was sued for libel
by Mr. Stewart, the man-
ager of the bank in Sydney,
and was sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment. And
that trial had followed
another in which it was
sought to prove him guilty
of contempt of court. In
the latter case the Doctor
was acquitted. Despite the
strong feeling of sympathy
with Dr. Lang and the
host of signatures appended
to a petition for the remis-
sion of the penalty, the
Governor, Sir William
Denison, stood firm.
Another indication of public opinion in regard to
the treatment meted out to Dr. Lang may be found in
the fact that though he offered to resign his seat in the
Legislative Council, his constituents would not accept
it, and he continued to be one of the Members for
Sydney while in prison. Circumstances, however, were
destined to remove all stigma from Dr. Lang and his
family, for evidence later on was produced which sheeted
home the guilt of the bank robbery to a man named
Burchell, who had at various times been left in charge,
and whom the police through some unaccountable over-
sight did not include in the arrests made on suspicion
of the crime. Young Lang and his companion in
DR. J. DUNMORE LANG.


misfortune were released from imprisonment. Resum-
ing his efforts in regard to immigration, Dr. Lang
continued to be a veritable stormy petrel in politics,
and forty or fifty years ago in Queensland the mention
of his name inevitably gave rise to political discordance,
those who knew him in the home circle of the house on
Church Hill, Sydney, or “sat under him” in the old
Scots Church near by, had difficulty in believing that
that gentle old man and earnest preacher was he who
had played so great a part in the politics, not only of
the Mother Colony, but of all the northern settlements
which were afterwards to become Queensland. Judgment
without bias cannot refuse him a prominent place among
those who founded well the freedom and prosperity of
Australia and in a special manner provided for the
interests of Queensland.
It is very necessary in picturing correctly the
evolution of the Moreton Bay settlement towards self-
government under the Empire that due insight should
be given to opposing desires for free immigration as
against that of exiles or reformees, as we have styled
them, for even when transportation, as commonly under-
stood, had ceased, there was effort after effort made by
a very influential class to obtain the services of cheap
labour, although that form of settler comprised for the
most part criminals to whom it was desired to “give
another chance.” This labour question so far entered into
the aspirations of a not unimportant section of the
community in the Moreton Bay settlement, that there
was a proposal that after separation the immigrants to
the new colony sought for should be those whose presence
in England was considered undesirable. In 1851 a
meeting of stockholders and others was held in Brisbane
and a resolution passed in favour of “separation with
exiles.” An object of the meeting was to constitute a
“Moreton Bay and Northern Districts Separation
Association,” the reason for the step being “the high
price and scarcity of labour.” A resolution was passed
to petition the Queen in favour of the system sought.
This action, in time, led to a step taken by those
in opposition, who protested solemnly against the pro-
ject, and concluded their protest with a petition to the
Queen, directly opposing the aims of the rival party.
This incident is of great importance, for it demonstrates
that while there was a consensus of opinion in regard to
the advisableness of cutting the settlement free of the
swaddling bands, which inclusion in the bounds of the
Mother Colony inferred, there was most convinced
disagreement concerning the details and subsequent course
to be pursued. If this standpoint be fully realized
the delay in the attainment of separation for some eight
years will cause little surprise, retarded as worthy
efforts were to constitute a colony north of New South
Wales by the wishes of the important commercial and
other vested interests in the Mother Colony who desired
to retain as long as possible the benefit resulting from
the centralization of trade. Gradually, however, the
trend towards democracy became more pronounced,* for
by the Constitution Act of 1850 the franchise had been
lowered from £2O to £lO. At the same time votes were
given to squatters for leases. And it is interesting to
read that Lord John Russell described the squatters as
“a wealthy and most respectable class.” Yet further
testimony in regard to the lack of unanimity concerning
separation is given in the fact that the Constitution Act
to which we refer gave a community north of the parallel
30 of latitude a right to separate on petition of the
t erritory i nte reste d.
In one respect good came of evil —the evil of forcing
exiles upon Australia. For in a desire to give reformees
“of the better class” escape from “the contamination to
which the present state of Van Diemen Land exposes
them,” the British authorities decided on the constitu-
tion of a settlement for exiles north of Moreton Bay.
And so came the first step towards the founding of Glad-
stone in 1846. The conditions regarding the settlement
were that those “who had reached the most advanced —■
that was the lightest stage of penal discipline—should go
to that colony; there they would be furnished with
provisions for a limited period and also a portion of
land. They would also be permitted, if thought proper,
after a certain interval to migrate to the adjoining
colonies and become the servants of the free population
of these colonies.” So ran the speech of Lord Stanley
in the House of Lords, when addressing the Chamber
in furtherance of legislation on the subject. The settlers,
it was further stated, “would be in the position of
having received a conditional pardon.” In addition
the new settlement was to include “all pardoned convicts
in Van Diemen Land unable to earn an independent
existence.” Such was the proposal which had a
beginning, but only a beginning, in the expedition
under the command of Colonel Barney, of the Royal
Engineers, who was appointed superintendent of the
new settlement. Colonel Barney’s name is enshrined in
a picturesque headland jutting into the sunlit waters,
studded with islands, which form the magnificent
harbour of Port Curtis, but beyond lending his name to
a scene of beauty near Gladstone, Colonel Barney did
but little. The project failed, for the “Lord Auckland,”
with the first consignment of proposed settlers and its
superintendent or governor, got into difficulties on the
sandbank of an island, where the crew and passengers
were landed, being subsequently transferred to the
mainland. The site of the settlement was chosen, and
then after weary uncertainty the recall was sounded,
for orders came that the establishment must be broken
up, as the letters patent for the constitution of the new
colony had been revoked. From that time, however,
Port Curtis attracted attention, and eventually became


one of the most important pastoral districts of the
settlement, with a harbour only second to Port Jackson
on the eastern coast and a tradition of having been
visited by the Spanish vikings of the seventeenth century.
In Brisbane two important additions to the dignity
and utility of the settlement took place in 1850. The
citizens realized their wishes in regard to the administra-
tion of justice, for a circuit court was opened on May 13
by Mr. Justice Therry. All the cases set down for
hearing were under the criminal jurisdiction, and we
are told that as a result of the stride onward in progress
there were two hangings in the town. Those who were
prone to think, perhaps not without reason, that the
expresses the opinion that the trial was of practical
good, and had much to do with the institution of a
bank, and this indeed is very probable, for a branch of
the Bank of New South Wales was opened in Brisbane
on November 14.
With the coming of the half century there were
yet other touches of the wand of progress, for the
old Custom House was built on the site where stands
the present edifice with its somewhat quaint architec-
ture. Land sales took place at Ipswich, Drayton, and
Warwick, while Cleveland assumed the dignity of a
township. It is helpful in understanding how develop-
ments come about to consider the relations and interaction

aborigine of the early days received scant justice, will
note with pleasure that as a result of shots fired by
soldiers at natives, due to the spearing of cattle near
the town, one of the men on trial was sentenced to six
months’ imprisonment. The validity of the money
orders, “calabashes,” which were largely in use through
the dearth of coins in circulation, came up for decision,
arising from a case before the court concerning the
theft of two orders. The case was taken to the Full
Court, and the final outcome was the verdict that the
“calabashes” were valueless, although the court declined
to state that the issue of such orders was criminal.

between pastoral settlement and exploration and how
the one stimulated the other. Exploration of necessity
waited on pastoral occupation, while the latter called
again for further work from the explorer.
It was a knowledge of all this which roused in so
many stalwart breasts the desire to plunge into the
wilds and lay bare the mysteries of the island continent.
Beyond that, thought began to look into the future,
and in addition to the relation to flocks and herds there
were seen other important factors in progress. Thus in
1842 we find there was a strong movement for the dis-
covery of an overland route to Port Essington, the
pastoral question being linked to a lofty ambition to


expand commercial relations by establishing trade
with the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, India,
and even China. Sir Thomas Mitchell gave all
the weight of his influence to obtain from the Govern-
ment the grant of £I,OOO in aid of an exploring
expedition, and supported a route from Port Burke,
600 miles north-west of Sydney; the alternative pro-
posal having Moreton Bay as the starting point, and
a course via the Darling Downs and the coast range to
the Gulf of Carpentaria, thence eastward along the
Gulf. Governor Sir George Gipps declined to take the
responsibility of making the grant, but was willing to
refer the request to London. Then Dr. Leichhardt,
who had not long before arrived in Australia, eager to
win fame in scientific research, stepped into the breach,
and not only undertook to form a private expedition
but did it, starting in 1844 with the intention of
travelling to Port Essington by way of the Darling
Downs and the Coast Range to “the Gulf.” The
experiences of the explorers are related in the chapters
in this work dealing with explorations.
Not seldom, we may believe, was exploration
accomplished by those who, fending for themselves in
the interests of their flocks and herds, travelled far
afield. Their work was of exceptional value, but the
names of those who did it have passed, for the most part,
unrecorded and unknown!. One is moved to recognize
all this when one reads in Dr. Lang’s “Cooksland,”
published in 1847, how a squatter of the Darling Downs
(John Campbell) told the author that he knew of a
large extent of country north-west beyond the Darling
Downs. Into that part of the district he had penetrated
further than anyone, but owing to the scarcity of water
he had great difficulty in winning his way back to his
home. How often, also, must hasty conclusions, due
to accidents of a drought or flood in abnormal seasons,
have delayed the advance of settlement. For all that,
we can only wonder that the conclusions of explorers
and enterprising settlers were often so justly and wisely
drawn.
In forming a picture of life as it was on the stations
far in the interior we must be careful to weigh all the
facts if we would do justice to the pioneers. And,
frankly speaking, the only way in which conflicts with
the blacks could have been avoided was to have aban-
doned all attempts to utilize the magnificent heritage,
of which the settlers in the northern settlement, as
well as those in the outlying districts of New South
Wales, perhaps alone knew the value. An enemy who
could marshal 500 fighting men in one locality and
could wreak damage to the extent of £250 by their
plunder-attacks, could not be persuaded to peace by
soft words. In such thoughts was found the reasoning
for the establishment of the native police, a system of
protection which was adopted because there was no
other way. The remedy was evil, says the philan-
thropist. Perchance he errs, because he lives in a
different age and in very dissimilar environment from
that of those who had to guard the lives not only
of the men they employed but also of their own wives
and children and the families of their workers, who
from the circumstances of the case were perforce very
often left alone. Thus came the black police, and we
can judge that there was no other way from the constant
demands upon their services in the outlying districts.
In many cases outrages were committed in the Burnett
and Wide Bay districts, and the services of the black
troopers as a consequence were in constant requisition.
They did their work effectually, and in time mastered
the evil. The skill of the Queensland black tracker has
been noised all over Australia, and we can concur in
the opinion of one of the white officers by whom the
aboriginal police were commanded when he asserted that
the men when trained were fully equal as fighting
material to the native soldiers of India. Many years
later the warlike natives of Fraser Island and their
pitched battles, and the no less fierce tribesmen on
Magnetic Island, gave those of a succeeding generation
some idea of what the settlers in the early days had
to face in the course of their life in the wilds. The
application of modern methods in the training of
aborigines to useful avocations was manifestly impos-
sible as the circumstances of bush life were then. Had
there been no black police it is very probable that there
would have been no pastoral industry.
It cannot be doubted that to the black police and the
very wholesome respect they aroused in their fellows
of the wilds was due the success of Mr. G. Francis—
and his safety—in penetrating ninety miles northward
of the Burnett, and his discovery of the Fitzroy River.
Mr. Francis was a visitor from Port Phillip, and must
have been animated by either great curiosity or great
daring. Lie won through, thanks to the black troopers
and their methods. And the necessity for the black
police was not obviated by the fact that Messrs.
Strathdene at their station employed to good purpose
black boys as shepherds, and experience proved that
while they did so their sheep were never speared. One
swallow does not make a summer. The annual appro-
priation of some £9,000 was not made needlessly.
Turning to small things, which are, however, as
indicative of the progress of the settlement as greater
questions, we find that towards the end of 1850 there
was a movement for the appointment of a letter carrier
in Brisbane. The agitation had certainly some reason,
for it seems that the salary (£35) had been voted,
although no one had been appointed. It is evident that
here, as in other respects, a strong argument against
centralization could be drawn from the relation of
Sydney to Brisbane.


CHAPTER XV.
DISCOVERY OF GOLD AND DEVELOPMENTS.
As the dawn heralds the day, so were there signs
of a marked increase in progress before the discovery
of gold in 1851. A new Electoral Act passed by the
Legislative Council was a step towards reform. An
increase in the number of elective members in the
House, which still comprised one Chamber, took place,
and of the thirty-six so appointed Moreton Bay secured
one, and for the first time in its history the towns were
specifically represented, for the constituency consisted
of the three Brisbane districts, the north and south
towns, with Kangaroo Point and Ipswich. Again, as
on many a previous occa-
sion, tire crucial question
before the electors was
really that of cheap
labour. Meetings were held
in support of a separa-
tion movement linked with
the importation of exiles.
Again did the hope of
the Cheap - labour Party
rest upon the British
Government, but in vain,
although Earl Grey sug-
gested that through an
application for separation
residents could get the
exile labour they desired.
It seems strange, reading
facts in the light of later
events, that an argument
against the granting of
representation to the
boroughs should be found
in the fear that the in-
fluence of the squatters
should predominate. The
fear proved groundless,
for although representa-
tives in favour of the
desires of those who sought the introduction of exiles
were returned for the constituencies of Darling Downs
and Wide Bay, Mr. H. Jones and Mr. John Richardson
(the latter a merchant of Brisbane) were elected
respectively as members for Stanley Boroughs and
County, and both were opposed to transportation in
any form. The Legislature to which the gentle-
men were elected pronounced emphatically against
transportation in any from, and as if the British Govern-
ment had already sensed the trend of public opinion,
the revival of the system was revoked. Not quite dead
yet were all hopes, however, for the Secretary of State
for the Colonies suggested later that if the New South
Wales Council should reconsider its resolutions, there
was no reason why convicts should not again be sent
to the Moreton Bay settlement. It may be of moment
to state here that the Honourable Lewis Hope, uncle
to Lord Hopetoun, who afterwards became the Marquis
of Linlithgow, and who subsequently played an import-
ant part in the introduction of sugar-growing in
Queensland, was one of two representatives of the
Northern Districts Association sent home to London to
express their wishes for exile labour, the other delegate
being Mr. Colin Mackenzie.
The discovery of gold
by Hargreaves near Bathurst
changed at once—and it
may be said for all time—
the object - view of the
majority of settlers in
Australia. The gold rush
and the gold fever
made transportation in any
form absolutely impossible.
Had Hargreaves never
lighted on his historical
find political influences in
Australia, joining hands
with those of like opinion
in Britain, might have
won their point. That
was not to be. Strange
as it may appear, the
scales of democracy were
weighted with gold. There
was great excitement in
Moreton Bay. Men de-
serted their employment,
and owners of flocks were
left to shear their own
flocks, while the prices
of flour and bread rose.
The fever in the south spread to the north, and
not only were there large shipments of people to the
southern goldfield, but also energetic search for the
precious mineral in the ranges of the settlement, the
argument being used that the mountain range of the
north was similar to that at Bathurst. Gold was dis-
covered near Brisbane in a gully off Taylor Range,
at Canning Downs, Mount Brisbane, and Widgee, also
at Thane Creek. The time of the settlement in regard
to gold discoveries had not yet come. But impetus was
given through the gold finds in the south, where new
discoveries took place.
HON, LEWIS HOPE.
21
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Another mining industry, less captivating than that
of gold-seeking, was established during 1851 and 1852,
for coal, of which there had been rumours, was now
mined. The first colliery was some four miles from
Wolston, on the southern side of the Brisbane. It was
worked by Mr. J. Williams, but a flood in the river
put a stop to the operations after some four years.
Thereafter mines at Moggil, and on the Bremer, near
Ipswich, the former worked by Williams and the latter
by Reed and Boyland, were the precursors of the
important coal-mining industry at Ipswich and else-
where .
At this time, also, another effort was made to
promote cotton cultivation, in regard to which there
was enthusiastic hope. Satisfactory results had
attended the despatch of a consignment to London
of raw cotton, and it was valued at from 9d. to Is.
per lb., a firm in England offering to purchase up to
£I,OOO worth of the article, if equal in quality to that
received. The Government of New South Wales offered
a bonus of £SO for the best 50 lbs. produced, and £25
as a second prize. This was the first step in the
direction of the bonus system in regard to cotton culti-
vation, and it is perhaps interesting to recall the fact
that through the bonus system did the cotton industry
expand and prosper greatly in later days, while through
the withdrawal of the bonus it faded away. Yet
another cultural industry took form at this time, arrow-
root being grown by Mr. Child, of Breakfast Creek, who
raised half a ton of good quality. Both cotton and
arrowroot belong to the number of products in Queens-
land which should be very important staples, but are
not, although no one seems to be aware why, for in
regard to both all the circumstances seem to be very
favourable.
Meanwhile, the advancement of Brisbane went on
and care for the intellectual wants of the community
was displayed, always strong evidence that a stage
had been reached, in the struggle for betterment, when
a breathing space was deemed advisable and time could
be spared to consider intellectual developments. For
we find that the Brisbane School of Arts was opened
in completed form, while a similar institution was
established at Ipswich. Religious denominations became
more extensively represented, and new places of wor-
ship were opened by various Methodist denominations
and also by the Presbyterians at South Brisbane.
In truth there was need that the intellectual side of
things should receive attention, for, according to the
census which was taken in 1851, not more than half
of the population could read, while the rest were un-
educated in the full sense of the word. Yet
another token that the pressure of pioneering life was
abating is to be found in the fact that the need for
relaxation at seaside resorts was experienced, and
Sandgate began to be patronized. In tbe Wide Bay
district the promise of a town was fulfilled, for Mary-
borough was proclaimed, and hopes concerning the
future took form in the inevitable speculation in town
allotments.
Meanwhile another satisfactory sign that things
were advancing is to be found in the necessity that
was realized for improving the riverine approach to
Brisbane. We find, accordingly, that in 1852 a project
was afoot for improving the channel, the services of
Mr. Debenham, C.E., being obtained. The proposals,
however, were financially impossible, and suggestions
by Mr. Petrie for a temporary deepening of the channel
were adopted. The work thus done comprised the
deepening of the passage across the bar by the use of
simple cutting appliances, together with the placing of
beacons. The question was not easy of settlement, as
was shown by the efforts subsequently made for enabling
liners of 10,000 tons burden to berth at the town reach.
On February 8, 1852, there arrived a shipload of
immigrants in the “Duchess of Cumberland" (227 in all),
professing practically a desire to settle in Moreton Bay—a
desire which was subsequently somewhat discredited by
the migration of a large number of the passengers to
the south, where the auriferous discoveries proved a
magnet few could resist. This question of one settle-
ment arranging for immigrants and another deriving
the benefit from them was to arouse great dissatis-
faction in future days, when the using of one colony to
reach another developed into a fine art. It may be
interesting to note that about this time a consignment
of Chinese coolies had proved the reverse of satisfac-
tory, and the undesirable experience was taken as a
lesson.
We have said that a census was taken of
the settlement, as a part of the mother territory in
the south, in this year (1852), and a study of the
statistics is instructive in comparison with the figures
as to population we have already given. The area of
the districts, exclusive of Clarence River, was as far
as was then proclaimed, 58,860 square miles in all,
while the total number of settlers was 8,575, there being
6,012 males and 2,563 females. Of the total those who
had come free into the settlement, or were born in it,
numbered 3,895 males and 3,656 females. Males to the
number of 1,469 had become free, as had 105 females.
There were 407 persons holding tickets-of-leave, of whom
2 were females. Those who could read and write
totalled 3,678 males and 1,251 females, while 1,322
could read. The nationalities represented were various
and were as follows:—Born in the colony, 1,847; 3,075
came from England; 793 were of Scottish extraction; the
Irish numbered 1,939 and the Welsh 38; the other


British possessions contributed 145 ; while the residue was
composed of natives of foreign countries, and, for the
greater part, males. A glance at the various avocations
pursued by the settlers gives an interesting insight into
the relations of the industries to advancement, as it was
then interpreted. We find that 1,846 were shepherds
and sheep managers, 369 were stockmen and cattle
managers; there were 869 labourers and 560 mechanics
and artisans, while 165 devoted themselves to agricul-
ture, and 50 were horticulturists. Commerce, trade,
and manufactures claimed the attention of 455. There
were 263 males and 371 females engaged in domestic
service. The ministers of religion numbered 15, and
was as follows;—Brisbane and suburbs, 2,543; Ipswich,
932; Maryborough, 299; Warwick, 267; Drayton, 200;
and Gayndah, 92.
A settlement cannot escape from its environment
any more than an individual, and so it came about that
the northern districts of the colony responded to the
wild excitement which had been aroused by the tidings
that further deposits of gold had been discovered in the
neighbourhood of Bathurst. Continued efforts were
made to prospect for gold in the northern settlement,
and later on a sum of £2,800 was promised in sub-
scription to the person fortunate enough to locate the
precious metal. Not only that, but the Government
IMMIGRATION DEPOT, KANGAROO POINT, BRISBANE.
8 lawyers with 24 medical men represented other
learned professions. Again we encounter the ambiguous
phrase, “other educated persons,” it being stated that
of the class there were 72. The compiler of the statistics
must have been imbued with a love of poetical allitera-
tion, for there seems no other reason for including in
the same class “pensioners and paupers,” who, we are
told, numbered 9. There were 170 of other occupa-
tions, and the unclassified residue of settlers is placed
at 2,249. The total number of houses in the northern
settlement was 1,021, of which 718 were in the County
of Stanley, 111 being built of stone and brick. Town
life then, as now, had its attractions, for the population
met the wishes of the settlers by sending Hargreaves
to the Moreton Bay districts, with a view to full
investigation. Nothing practical, however, resulted,
although Hargreaves visited Wide Bay, where there was
afterwards to be so great an unearthing of Nature’s
hidden treasures. It is impossible to realize things as
they were then without grasping the fact that gold
affected all questions and modified the outlook on every
industry. We can see that it had a direct effect in
giving a great impulse to immigration. In the year of
which we speak (1852) four ships arrived with settlers
in the Brisbane River—the “Maria Somes,” “Argylle,”
“Meridian,” and the “Rajah of Gapoul.” This


represented an increase to the population of 1,119 souls.
In the case of the “Rajah of Gapoul” much indignation
was aroused because typhus fever was not reported and
necessary precautions taken to prevent the dangerously
infectious malady from spreading to the residents of the
settlement, and it is on record that the master of the
ship had to pay heavy penalties. It had not been
the first occasion on which a ship from overseas was
the means of disseminating disease.
Inhabitants were what the settlement required
above all, and it may be of use in enabling the reader
to understand motives as well as needs as they were
then in the colony, that just as the settlement seemed
to be obtaining relief from its labour troubles, a course
calculated above all to make trouble was adopted, for a
Select Committee of the Legislative Council recom-
mended that the passengers who had been brought out
free should repay the Government the sum of £l3
incurred in bringing them to Australia. Later on we
shall see that another and even more pronounced effort
was made to transform the system of free passes, which
the colony, and with it the northern settlements,
granted for its own purpose, into a means for binding the
immigrants, and in short enforcing on them obligations
as to remaining with a given employer until the obli-
gation had been fulfilled. We have here, it cannot be
doubted, a reason why there was so persistent a demand
again and again for exiles and reformees as settlers.
Two petitions had been sent from Moreton Bay,
for presentation to the Queen, one seeking separation
and exile labour, the other also praying for separation,
but under free conditions solely. This gave the Minister
for the Colonies the opportunity he desired for a
strategic retreat from a position no longer tenable,
and so we find Lord Grey pointing out that it was
inexpedient that Her Majesty, by favouring either one
or the other of the petitions, should place parties in
opposition in the northern districts.
In the meantime the popular voice had not been
without a powerful influence in affecting those who saw
the necessity for separation, for we find Messrs. Hodgson,
St. George Gore, and Munro Smith, together with Dr.
Cannan and Mr. R. Cribb, in unison for separation,
irrespective of the labour question, which henceforth
was eliminated from the all-important question of the
removal of the swaddling clothes of dependency on
New South Wales. It had been realized that without
unanimity no progress was attainable. The wisdom of
burying the hatchet in regard to lesser questions was
seen ere long. Sydney, and New South Wales gener-
ally, had determined that the northern districts must
be retained, and the Council even went so far as to
take action, ultra vires, in proposing that, if separation
was to be, the southern boundary of the new colony
should be a line midway between the site of Gympie and
Maryborough. Had those who were grasping at so
much that was valuable, and which was to become still
more important in the future, attained their end, the
future of that which was to be Queensland would have
been very different. The blunder into which they
had been plunged was, however, recognized, and the
colony, like the Colonial Office, retired with all the
grace it could muster from the untenable position. The
fact that Mr. Wentworth based his arguments against
separation on the fact that the new colony, if formed,
would be filled with transportees proved how wise were
the leaders of the separation movement in unifying their
efforts.
In the year 1852 Mr. Jones, the member for Stanley
Boroughs, died. He had done good service in opposing
transportation, but his death, although widely regretted,
did not weaken the unity of the separation movement,
as Mr. Stuart Russell was in line with the only attitude
on the subject which promised any success. The power
of centralization was still very great, however, and
as an evidence of this it may be stated that a Bill for
the appointment of a resident judge was rejected in the
Legislative Council, this action being all the more sig-
nificant in view of the very heavy calendar of cases set
down for hearing at the sitting of the Circuit Court
held a short time previously. The central authorities,
however, seemed to realize that it would not be wise
to proceed to extremities, for while they withheld with
one hand they gave with the other. Captain Wickham
was appointed Government Resident of Brisbane, while
there was a new appointment in the gazettal of a
Police Magistrate to Ipswich. This was a declaration
of the superior importance of the town nearer the sea,
which Ipswich was anything but ready to acknowledge,
for the question of the capital was by no means settled.
Ipswich urged her claims to pre-eminence with great
persistency, if less logic; while Cleveland still had hopes,
and residents of Sandgate considered that the advan-
tages of the waters off the township as an anchorage
for deep-sea shipping might lend it still greater dignity.
That Sandgate had warm champions as a port may
enable us to realize that there was much that was lack-
ing in regard to the Brisbane as a waterway. A
glimpse into conditions which have passed never to
return is given in the argument advanced on behalf of
Sandgate that the harbourage accommodation there
would be an attraction as a port of call, as compared
with Sandridge, Port Phillip, which at that time had
an evil reputation with captains and shipowners, as
their vessels were frequently left without crews, owing
to the lure of the diggings.
Turning to Brisbane, we find traffic by road between
the town and settlement towards Ipswich and the


country beyond could not have been very great at this
time, for we are told by the records that the ferry, at
that point which is now North Quay, was sold, as to its
rights, for £ll3, while the annual rent of the ferry
at Kangaroo Point was placed at £l9. It will be
remembered that the Brisbane people were compelled
to look to themselves in regard to the hospital facilities
they required after the removal of the penal settlement,
and they seemed to have managed things admirably,
for it is stated that the benefits of the institution were
widely appreciated, for then, as later, it was prac-
tically the base hospital for the territory.
There is an impression, not altogether well founded,
that agriculture had not at that early stage of settle-
ment made any material advance; but this impression,
due to the overshadowing importance of grazing, is not
in the settlement, for we are prone to consider
the industry as wholly of modern date, forgetful that
among the relics of Sir John Franklin’s last voyage
were tins of preserved meat. Perchance the intention
was father in thought to that enterprise which first
among the efforts to prepare meat for export took form
near Maryborough. The scheme at Brisbane seemed to
have subsided, like many a project, into the ordinary
ruts whence it sprang.
Yet another proposal which seemed winged with
success in this year of 1852 was the formation of a
steamship company to trade between Brisbane and
Sydney. As “The Moreton Bay Steam Navigation
Company” the new venture seemed to find favour, but
whether it was that the pastoralists were feeling the
effect of times which were unsettled if hopeful, it proved
CLEVELAND, A SEASIDE RESORT, WHICH IN THE EARLY DAYS WAS SUGGESTED AS THE FUTURE CAPITAL OF QUEENSLAND.
correct. The records show that in the earliest times
the cultural capabilities of the settlement were well
tested by a number of men whose spirit and enterprise
caused them to look beyond what was the scope of their
duties. The testing went on, and success attended the
growing of wheat at more than one point, the result at
Bulimba being satisfactory, as was also that at Moggill
Creek. Coffee was also grown to advantage, the experi-
ence of former efforts being supplemented to good pur-
pose. Yet another new departure, and one of great
significance, was the establishment of a sawmill by Mr.
Pettigrew, which was the pioneering effort in a very
important industry.
Like reflex-thought action from another age come
the tidings that the Lords of the Admiralty favoured
a company being formed to engage in meat-preserving
impossible to redeem the pledges of support. A capital
of £15,000 was sought, the shares being £lO in value,
but although a steamer suitable for the trade could
have been purchased, the project, when apparently
nearing success, was abandoned.
The exports appeared to justify the development of
the coastal trade through local enterprise, for in the
year they totalled £185,183, while those from the
Clarence River amounted to £23,850, and the Mary
River trade showed in exports the sum of £10,586.
A notable evidence that either very little interest
was taken in political questions at that time, or that
the feeling against administration from New South
Wales was so strong as to crush politics as being futile
under the circumstances, is to be found in the fact that
at the election for Wide Bay, Maranoa, and Burnett,


due to the resignation of Mr. Biggs, there were only-
three electors present, the returning officer and the
candidates being the sole other participants in the
business. Mr. R. J. Smith was elected; Mr. Foster,
of Wide Bay, was nominated by Mr. W. B. Tooth,
but there was nobody to vote for him. Further, we are
told that only two of the five members would be able
to attend the opening of Parliament.
In order that the true position in regard to separ-
ation should be understood the fact must be realized
that it was necessary that an important change should
first take place in the colony of New South Wales,
where already the trend towards a bicameral legisla-
ture was becoming manifest. The proposed and widely
desired change may be best understood when it is
pointed out that the Legislative Council, at the time
of which we speak, simply gave a control similar to
that enjoyed by a Crown colony. There was the elective
principle, it is true, but it did not extend far enough,
and above all there was felt a strong need for a
Constitution on the lines of that which had evolved in
the Mother Country.
A despatch from Sir John Pakington, who at that
time administered the Colonial Office, is significant of
the extent to which the Government in London was
compelled to take its knowledge of affairs from its
representatives, for the Secretary of State frankly
stated that he “did not see the need for separation.”
Yet we cannot say that Downing Street remained
unaffected by popular opinion or was obstinately against
concessions. Indeed, the consciousness of ignorance, if
it caused the Minister for the Colonies to pay overmuch
heed to the advice of those in charge of affairs over-
seas, had also another effect, for it made the Colonial
Office chary of withstanding public opinion when it
became clamant. A very pronounced step in demo-
cratic control for Australia was the handing over of the
administration of all business and revenue in connection
with waste lands to the Legislative Council. This was
conceded, the Colonial Office cautioned, “not as a
right,” but because it was expedient. Those who saw
the urgent need for the step would not be disposed to
criticize too sharply the obvious effort of the Depart-
ment to hedge safely its dignity. Practically, however,
all the reform sought was given when Sir John
Pakington admitted that the time had come for the
constitution of a nominee Legislative Council and an
elective Legislative Assembly. Here, again, the Secre-
tary safeguarded his retreat by asserting that it "was
expedient.” It is strange that the able politicians who
fought strenuously for constitutional government, how-
ever foolish some of them may have been in their desire
to reproduce in toto the system in Britain, did not realize
that all they succeeded in doing in that direction was
but bringing nearer the separation they feared. The
popular voice had been heard in England, and
although Sir John Pakington went out of office and
was succeeded by the Duke of Newcastle, the latter
Minister expressed himself in concord with the views
of his predecessor.
It is satisfactory to know that the urgency of
private affairs permitted the Moreton Bay members to
take their seats in the Council in time to deal with
the constitutional question. In addition to the point
of boundary, north of that latitude where Gympie was
to spring into being, three clauses in the Bill consti-
tuting the bicameral system are worthy of attention.
They were the fourth, fifth, and sixth clauses, and
though they were not retained in the measure they
give us quite an interesting insight into the political
standpoint of an important section in New South
Wales; for Mr. Wentworth, when he included them in
his legislative proposals, might have done so with the
object of popularizing himself, a motive not unknown
among political leaders. The clauses provided for
“power to vest in Her Majesty of appointing Legisla
tive Council, provided that no minister of religion or
judge of the Supreme Court shall be eligible: Heredit-
ary titles may have a seat awarded them for life in
the Legislative Council: When the holders of such
hereditary titles amount in number to fifty, or upwards,
the present Legislative Council to cease, and a Council
composed of patentees for life and of a certain number
of elected persons holding such titles to be thenceforward
the Legislative Council.”
In looking back at this proposal can Australians
consistently sneer at the love of titles which is evinced
in the American Republic, as well as in the political
life of Great Britain, where, in truth, the power of
recommending persons for such honours is a valued
privilege in the hands of the Cabinet. In the rounded
periods of Mr. Wentworth, the proposed system “would
lay the foundation of an aristocracy of birth, fortune,
leisure, and superior education.” The framer of the
scheme had gone to the House of Lords for his system,
and found in the method of electing Scottish and Irish
peers to the Upper House something worthy of imitation.
In view of the present political movement in Australia
it is beyond comprehension how such a proposal pro-
viding for a species of pinchbeck nobility should then
have been mooted. Yet it was strongly advocated, for
Mr. Wentworth urged:—“lt is not the least of the
advantages which would arise from the creation of a
titled order that it would necessarily form one of the
strongest inducements not only to respectable families
to remain in the colony, but to the upper classes of the
United Kingdom and other countries, who are desirous
to emigrate, to choose it for their future home.”


Very few men are able to anticipate the thought
of a coming age, and never was this more exemplified
than in the assertion of Mr. Wentworth, that “the
result of the miserable policy of separation would be
the creation of a Federal Government and would inevit-
ably end in the overthrow of the British Throne.”
Again, his statement “that if the people of Moreton Bay
had a surplus revenue now, how long had they been a
drag on the Sydney Government,” was merely a jibe,
and had, of course, nothing to do with the facts and
arguments in favour of separation.
In New South Wales, as also in the northern
settlements, feeling against a nominee Upper House
was very pronounced, while
the undignified animus
Mr. Wentworth displayed
against the wishes of the
people of the Moreton Bay
districts resulted in another
petition to the Queen on
the subject. That petition
has interest for us, apart
from its political import,
for it set forth that the
revenue of the northern
districts was not less
than £70,000 per annum,
while the market value
of the stock was nearly
£2,000,000, and the free-
hold interest valued at
£700,000. It was fur-
ther stated that there was
an extensively distributed
wealth of minerals. Only
population was required
in order to promote deve-
lopment.
Meanwhile the Consti-
tution Bill had passed its
second reading, the voting
being twenty - five against
eight, and hope for democracy in New South Wales, as
well as the future of the northern settlement, rested
on the thread of better counsels prevailing in the com-
mittal stage. The thread, however, held, and the
result of debate in committee was the excision of the
clause providing for titles and also that changing the
northern boundary of the colony as wholly ultra vires,
as those boundaries were fixed by the Imperial Act,
under which the Legislative Council had its being and
exercised its powers. The clause stating that ministers
of religion were not eligible for seats was retained in
the measure, which was finally validated by the British
Parliament in July, 1855.
The Act, which marked one of the great steps
forward of democratic rule in Australia, substituted two
Chambers for that of one, the Legislative Council; the
members of the Upper House being nominated by the
Crown, while the Legislative Assembly was elective, the
constituencies being set forth. The qualification of an
elector was a freehold valued at £lOO or a household of
an annual value of £lO, or a leasehold of like annual
value, or a grazing licence, or a salary of £lOO per
annum, or the payment of £4O per annum for board
and lodging, or of £lO per annum for lodging only. The
payment of rates and taxes, or licence fees, relating to
the property qualification, was made a condition that
must be fulfilled previous
to the vote being exercised.
The members of the first
Legislative Council were to
hold their seats for five
years from the date of
appointment, but thereafter
members were to be ap-
pointed for life. All electors
qualified to vote for a
member of the Legislative
Assembly were to be eligible
for membership in that
Chamber. It was provided
that the President of the
Council should be appointed
by the Crown, while the
Speaker of the Assembly
should be elected. No one
holding an office of profit
under the Crown, save
the five responsible Min-
isters provided for in the
Act, or of such members,
not exceeding five, which
the Governor -in - Council
might declare qualified,
could sit in the Assembly.
The term of the Assembly
was to be for five years, subject to prorogation or dis-
solution by the Governor. The Council was to consist
of twenty-one members, one-third to form a quorum,
while the Assembly was to comprise fifty-four members,
twenty to form a quorum. Power was given to the
Legislature to alter or reconstruct itself upon the vote
of a majority of the Council and two-thirds of the
Assembly. Authority was given to either Chamber to
frame its own standing orders. A very important
feature of the Act was the vesting of all Crown lands,
their control and revenue, in the Legislature. It was
provided that all duties and revenues should form a
consolidated revenue, from which should be drawn the
HON. W. C. WENTWORTH.


expenditure of the colony, a civil list of £64,300, of
which £28,000 was to be devoted to public worship,
being reserved. The Act further set forth that the
Assembly was to originate all taxation on message from
the Governor, while all payments on public account
were to be made by the Governor’s warrant to the
Treasurer of the colony for the time being. It was pro-
vided that one month after receiving the Royal assent
the Act should come into force, the calling of the first
Parliament to take place within six months of the
proclamation of the Act as law. Unlike the course
hitherto adopted, when land revenues had been reserved
for immigration purposes, the income and receipts from
that source were to pass into the general revenue.
Turning from the constitutional question, as it
affected the colony as a whole, we find that in the
Moreton Bay settlement advancement was going on
steadily, as was shown by the devices for obtaining
sufficient labour, despite the fact that six ships had in
all added some 2,000 souls to the population of the
southern districts. It was even suggested that settlers
should be obtained from Victoria, where the ebb from
the goldfields, anything but inconsiderable, might, it
was thought, provide Moreton Bay with the additional
labour which was the crying need of those years. In
the meantime the Legislative Council, while waiting on
changes, so material to its own powers, had passed in
this year (1853-4) a statute dealing with immigration.
Again was the tendency evinced to hark back to the
time which in the minds of not a few were regretfully
sighed for as “the good old days,” when service could
be controlled. It was not convict labour or that of exiles
or reformees, which was so longed for, but the reliability
and the control which the system of transportation in
its various forms gave. It was provided in the Act
that the passage money of assisted or free immigrants,
£l3 for each individual, must be repaid after fourteen
days subsequent to the arrival of the passengers. In
the case of inability to comply with this provision or
unwillingness to do so, the Act gave power for the
indenting of defaulters for a period of two years’ service,
and this was to be done irrespective of the wishes of
the new arrivals. The emjfioyer under this arrange-
ment was to pay one-half of the passage money at the
date of hiring and the remainder at the termination of
twelve months’ service. The Statute provided that
employes so engaged had no power to cancel their
engagement until a year had elapsed from the time of
hiring, and then only could freedom be obtained by
payment of the full amount due for passage.
That which had been striven for so earnestly in
the southern part of the colony—self-government through
a constitution—while representing a vast stride forward
meant an advance in another direction than that which
those who battled for Sydney interests desired. With-
out knowing it, all that had been sought and accom-
plished in the sphere of Parliamentary Government was
destined to strengthen the movement, which southern
interests were most strenuously opposing, for the pros-
perity which constitutional reform induced largely and
the liberalizing of the Legislature inevitably hastened
separation. Arguments were being placed in the hands
of northern settlers which were hard to gainsay. During
the year 1853-4 the exports from the rivers of the
northern districts totalled £416,221, those from the
Brisbane being £265,494 in value and the Mary £50,796.
The export from the Clarence, Richmond, and Tweed
Rivers, which were included in the statistical return,
represented £99,913 of the total amount ; so that an
excellent proof of growing commercial and industrial
importance is afforded, no matter whether we include or
exclude the northern districts of New South Wales as
apart from the territory which afterwards became Queens-
land. The increase from Brisbane in export trade as com-
pared with the preceding year was £BO,OOO, which was for
the most pastoral produce, the amount of wool shipped
being 7,968 bales. The returns from Wide Bay demon-
strate that in that district as well as in the Burnett
prosperity was extending, and in regard to Port Curtis
there were strong signs of a more favourable judgment
than had been given in the past.
A report obtained concerning the capabilities of
Gladstone’s hinterland was encouraging, and that it
varied from the opinion previously expressed is only
one more evidence of the mischievous results which may
attend a cursory and imperfect investigation on the one
hand or one that was modified, probably unconsciously,
by a belief that nothing very favourable was to be
expected.
It seems, however, strange to us that a district like
that of Port Curtis, where agricultural capabilities have
developed in so marked a degree, should not have
been approved with any degree of accuracy, although
it must be remembered that in the days of which we
write the value of scrub land had not been realized, at
least in the northern districts. That phase of farming
was to come later, and was brought about by timber-
getters in their work, and a vast impetus given to
agriculture, through the coming of the sugar industry.
Cotton, in the opinion of those who planned and worked
for the agricultural developments of the Moreton Bay
settlement, was still the staple crop that was to be.
Gradually, however, Wide Bay, Burnett, and Port
Curtis were coming into their own, although the
blacks and their ravages were factors in preventing
those who were not robust and boldly resolute from
adventuring into the districts. And while the outposts
on the coast of the settlement were making headway, it


is interesting to note that the great facilities of Port
Curtis as a harbour were becoming widely known
and appreciated. The attempt of Colonel Barney, though
it failed in its direct purpose of founding a colony in
which convicts would figure as settlers —though the
Gladstone colony was blocked, yet the result of the
effort was all for good. The centralizing tendency of
Sydney was demonstrated very fully and unmistakably
at this time in regard to Port Curtis, for an appeal that
the land sales in connection with that district should be
held in Brisbane was promptly refused.
As we turn to the records of Brisbane we note that
the year 1853-4, in attention to smaller interests, gave
many evidences of satisfactory progress. A horticul-
tural society was founded, and this fact alone marks
a step onward. A soap factory was established, and
Brisbane. It was not so many years previously that
the request that a bank should be instituted in the
city was not complied with. Times had changed. In
another sphere this was also shown, for it is on record
that the Legislative Council agreed to a vote of
=£25,000 for improvements in the northern settlement.
Among the objects of the expenditure was a lighthouse
at Cape Moreton. During the year a sensation was
caused by the tidings that a gang of convicts had made
their escape from Norfolk Island, and had landed in
Moreton Bay, where the depredations they committed
aroused the apprehension of the community. Fortu-
nately the career of rapine and plunder was speedily
cut short by the arrest and trial of the escapees,
culminating in sentences commensurate with the
crimes.

also one for making candles, while the initiation of a
fellmongery was also a signpost in advancement. It
is of value in realizing conditions as they were at this
time to learn that “Cressbrook” Station passed from
the possession of Mr. Hughes to that of Mr. J. D.
McLean, the purchase price being £15,000, or at the
rate of 15s. per sheep. And it gives one an excellent
idea of the importance of stockraising in the settle-
ment when we learn that the sum of £50,000 was
offered and refused for “Canning Downs” Station. A
land sale on one occasion totalled £15,000, and in view
of the progress attending industries it will excite no
surprise to hear that branches of the Joint Stock Bank
(now the Australian Bank of Commerce), the Union
Bank, and the Bank of Australasia were established in
Circumstances were indeed bearing witness to the
potentialities of the northern settlement. And in
addition to the noteworthy increase in the exports there
was also another sign afforded in the recognition by
the central authorities at Sydney that if Cape Moreton
was to be retained there must be concessions, though in
truth these were as meagre as was possible. Settlement
in the Downs was ever extending and becoming more
important, and Dalby was growing up as the centre of
a wealth-winning group of pastoral properties. Sandgate
was also making way, although at the time of which
we write the evil reputation of Cabbagetree Creek as a
haunt of wild blacks was assuredly against development.
A settler there (Thomas Dowse) was wounded by
aborigines, and the attack is proof that the capital


was very near indeed to the wild life of the bush
and all its dangers. North of Port Curtis the
advancing tide of pastoral enterprise was sweeping,
and had reached the country of the Fitzroy, reports
of which were very encouraging. Gayndah, as a
point of distribution and attraction for the squatting
interests in the hinterland of Maryborough, was
beginning to make an impression. All things indeed
were preparing for another bound forward in the path
of progress.
CHAPTER XVI.
LAST YEARS OF THE SETTLEMENT DAYS.
Even as late as 1853-4 there was much disputing
as to the rival claims of Brisbane and Cleveland for
metropolitan honours. It would seem that Ipswich had
abandoned her pretensions to be the chief city of the
settlement in regard to which she undoubtedly at one
time had high hope, for the Ipswich people strongly
supported Cleveland as the town which should be the
capital. Ipswich, indeed, had for long occupied a posi-
tion of almost equal importance to Brisbane, as is
evidenced by the necessity which was acknowledged for
clearing the channel of the Bremer as well as that of the
Brisbane. The fact that Ipswich was the terminal
point of the landward carriage of wool and other
pastoral products, as well as the starting place for the
homeward journey of the bullock drays laden with
supplies, gave that town a prominence which we can
hardly realize in these days. Ambition in the case
of Ipswich, as in that of many another colonial centre,
was its undoing, and when the railway to the west was
demanded it was little thought that with the iron horse
would pass much that had ministered to the growth of
the town. Brisbane held her place against all comers,
despite the fact that the navigation of the river left much
to be desired. We have said that a temporary system of
removing the obstructions to shipping had been adopted,
but palliatives are not cures, and the truism was
exemplified in the demand for deepening the water-
ways linking Brisbane and Ipswich with the sea. The
request was considered favourably by the New South
Wales Government.
Another rival of Brisbane had appeared, and it is
of interest to know that the districts north of Stanley
were thinking and acting, for we find that a public
meeting was convened at Gayndah, in which the sub-
stitution of Gladstone for Brisbane as the capital city
was strongly urged, a petition to the Queen being
drawn up, according to the time-honoured custom of
those days, when that course seemed to afford great
relief. That Brisbane was able to stand unmoved
against the really formidable claims of Port Curtis is
evidence of the difficulty in changing the capital of a
territory. The signatories to the petition in favour of
Gladstone were wise in taking action betimes, for with
the passing of the direct influence of the Crown through
the Colonial Office, and the coming of the constitution
which was even now under review, their opportunity
for attaining their desires would be lost. Brisbane s
rights of possession, being able to withstand the move-
ment in favour of Port Curtis, were not to be disputed
by weaker rivals. That was shown by the fading away
of the aspirations of Cleveland, which seems to have
experienced reverses of business owing to the removal
of commerce elsewhere. In the beginning the river
undoubtedly made Brisbane, and it only remained for
the town to show that she could make the river.
As we look back on events we can see that in the
years intervening between the convict settlement and
the founding of the colony of Queensland there were
two questions of paramount interest —separation and
labour, and those two were in a sense one. The demand
for population was indeed insatiable, strained as were
the resources of the territory as to labour by the
drawing power of gold in the south. And so we find
that despite the fact that three ships, the “Monsoon,”
“Genghis Khan,” and “General Hewitt,” arrived with
1,199 immigrants in all, the demand for workers was still
most urgent, land remaining undeveloped. The building
of houses was arrested, while rents as a natural conse-
quence were high. Added to all this there was that
tendency to which we have referred, the desire to
control labour when engaged and which was exemplified
in the immigration system reviving practically forced
engagements on the immigrants who were unable to
defray the whole cost of their passage. Unpopularity
in Britain in regard to methods adopted affected the flow
of population to so great an extent that the Governor
of the colony considered recourse would be necessary to
the old system.
Dr. Lang realized the difficulty that threatened
to bar progress, and also saw a remedy, for with his
wonted energy he proposed, in co-operation with those
interested in Britain, to form a Moreton Bay Land and
Immigration Company, with a capital of £250,000, the
object being to purchase Crown lands in Moreton
Bay, and through the money paid for them defray the
cost of passage for the immigrants. The profits of the
company were to be derived from the rise in value of
the land bought. The scheme found favour in Brisbane,


where a provisional committee was formed. The
necessary legislative validation of the project barred
the way, however; and though the proposal seemed to
have all the elements of a sound business scheme, it was
defeated, perchance because of hostility to its author and
also, we may not doubt, through a growing jealousy of
the northern districts. The measure was rejected in
the Legislative Council by two votes, and it is note-
worthy that among the supporters of the Bill were Sir
James Martin, Sir C. Cowper, and Sir Henry Parkes.
Those in opposition were for the most part members
of the Government and nominees of the Crown.
Determined to exercise influence in legislature
while it was competent for him to do so —as the new
without delay—was defeated by twenty-three votes to
seven. Mr. Stewart Russell, another representative of
the northern districts, seconded the defeated resolution.
The problem of sufficient labour was as far from solution
as ever.
This year with which we are now dealing (1854)
might be, perhaps, deemed historically important from
a visit which the Governor (Sir Charles Fitzroy) paid
to the northern settlement, whither he voyaged in
H.M.S. “Calliope.” When in Brisbane he was the
guest of Captain Wickham, the Government Resident,
at his house, “Newstead,” and it is on record that the
first public dinner in Brisbane was tendered to the
vice-regal visitor. The visitation does not seem to have

constitution excluded ministers of religion from Par-
liament—Dr. Lang sought election for the County of
Stanley, and after adventures and misfortunes insepar-
able from all his schemes, outside his Church work, he
was returned as a member. There were two elections,
as his opponent (Mr. A. Plodgson), who gained the
majority of the votes at the first poll, was unseated on
a petition from the other candidate. In the Legislative
Council Dr. Lang at once began to move for separation,
but he failed, for his motion—for an address from the
Council to the Queen, praying that the separation of
Moreton Bay from New South Wales should be granted
been very fruitful, as far as the granting of requests
went, and on the subject of separation the Governor
displayed a masterly evasiveness. Yet the observation
which the visitor was enabled to make, not only in
Brisbane but during a trip on horseback to the Downs,
and thereafter to Wide Bay, must have affected very
materially his viewpoint on not a few important subjects.
We can picture how keen must have been the
longing for the discovery of gold in the territory, in
view of the knowledge that a payable goldfield would
more speedily than any other factor attract the popu-
lation so necessary and yet so difficult to obtain. At
31

this time, therefore, great interest must have attended
the investigations of the Rev. W. B. Clarke on the
mining resources of the Darling Downs. The reputa-
tion of the reverend gentleman as a geologist entitled
his report to respect, and in truth, subsequent years
have done nothing to disprove the conclusions at which
he arrived that there might be gold in the lower regions
of the Downs. He, however, laid emphasis on the
deposits in many places of gems and tin, and in regard to
the latter he said : “Respecting the tin I may state that
I found it in almost every mass of drift in every
portion of the country I have explored for gold, and
that it is frequently abundant where gold is wanting.
It existed in all the western streams from the Peel to
the Condamine, and it was equally common in the
southern districts.” The town of Stanthorpe bears
witness to the correctness of Mr. Clarke’s report, and
many a pure gem unearthed in the country flashes out
the truth of his conclusions.
Land booms, which in later days became so familiar
incidents in the business of the country, and not always
with beneficial results on individual investors, were by
no means unknown in the fifties, and we learn that
the sale of lands at Port Curtis was fruitful in demon-
strating the keen interest taken in that district. The
financial result of the sale, which lasted two days,
totalled £12,865. Many lots in the town of Gladstone
brought £2OO each, while the highest price given for an
area of little more than 33 perches was £450. In
Brisbane, town and suburban lots, including some at
Sandgate, sold in all for £5,136. It is of interest to
learn that land at Bulimba, which it was intended to
sell on the occasion, was withdrawn on the advice of
Mr. Stutchbury, Government Geologist, who reported
that there was coal there. Some dissatisfaction appears
to have been expressed at the time of which we write
in regard to the emoluments of officers in charge of the
Crown lands, as it was found that indirect remunera-
tion from land sales, in the form of commission,
amounted to a large sum. Thus Captain Wickham (the
Government Resident), whose salary was £SOO per
annum, drew an additional sum of £473 in commission
on land sales. Other cases in which there was an
unjustified increase of income from indirect sources,
under the system adopted by the Government, aroused
animadversion. The result of the complaints, which
were loudly voiced, was that the official commissions on
all sales of Government land were reduced to 5 per
cent, on all transactions under £5,000 in one year and
to per cent, on the receipts when they exceeded that
amount. Indirect sources of income in the case of
public servants were later on cut off altogether, the
direct pay being increased so as to meet the altered
circumstances, and this was in every respect a
more equitable method of dealing with the position.
We must picture Brisbane as an Arcadia of a sort
at this time. Money was plentiful and easily won, and
what was perhaps better in the eyes of some, there
were very few channels for spending income. Indeed,
it is stated that investment in land represented the
only means of dispersing spare cash. For there were
no theatres, no entertainments, only a few hotels, and
not a cab in the town. “There was,” as Coote says,
with almost a tinge of pathos, “no extravagance.” No
wonder the town made rapid strides toward prosperity
in the midst of all this SjDartan simplicity. The days
of picture shows were not yet! A graphic pen-stroke
in delineation of the times is given in the statement
that the roads were sadly in need of attention, and a
step in the right direction was taken in the appoint-
ment of Mr. Vigors as Surveyor of Roads. The year 1854
is also to be remembered for the institution of a
Government Savings Bank. Those to whose enterprise
the community was indebted for the time-honoured
aid and incentive to economy would be astounded now
were they to revisit these sublunary spheres and note
the huge development which has resulted from the
small beginnings of their enterprise and wisdom.
Greater consideration, as we have hinted, was being
paid by the central Colonial Government to the require-
ments of the northern districts, and this was shown
in the increase of expenditure in the Estimates,
which rose from £25,000 to £33,000. The dark
shadow of danger from attacks by blacks lingered in
the outer bounds of settlements, and a sum of
£16,000 was set apart for the maintenance of
the black police, whose patrol extended from the
Clarence River to Port Curtis. It was also recommended
by the Governor in a message to the Council that the
sum of £IO,OOO should be expended in clearing a
passage in the Brisbane River, and that £5,000 be
devoted to the purchase of a dredge for further work
in improving the navigation. As a preliminary to
deepening the waterway to the town, it was suggested
by the Government Resident that £I,OOO be devoted to
surveying the river. Ominous was the result of a
Parliamentary Committee’s investigations into the
requirements of Cleveland, and the resulting recommen-
dation was really the death-knell to the ambitions of
that town. In regard to a proposed jetty there, it was
found that £I,OOO had already been voted for the
work, but that a further sura of £5,197 would be
required. The conclusion the Committee arrived at
was probably based on a business consideration of all
the facts, and so not to be disputed. It was that the
undertaking should be suspended “until it had been
ascertained that the jetty woud afford to the public
advantages commensurate with its large cost.”


It is pleasing to know that Earl Grey’s conception
of the land question in Australia was so excellent that
a Committee of the Legislative Council appointed to
report on the subject found that it could not do better
than adopt the views expressed by that Minister in
1846, when he realized at once all the difficulties that
would arise if vast tracts were alienated instead of
leased to tenants of the Crown. He saw that the
property of the Crown in large areas of grazing land
must be protected, “that as they are wanted for
settlement they may be sold at a price, which while it
is too high to admit of large tracts being obtained
possession of by grasping speculators, is yet sufficiently
optimism of its promoters. In another direction there
were energetic efforts to develop the coal-mining
industry, and a company was proposed, to work the
carboniferous deposits in Moreton Bay, with a capital
of £25,000. The promoters seem to have been content
to generalize the proposition, which probably for that
reason failed to materialize. Again, there was talk of
exploiting the mines worked by Mr. Williams between
Brisbane and Ipswich, and also of proving the coal-
bearing tract at Bulimba, to which a report of the
Government Geologist had directed attention, but
nothing beyond discussion seems to have occurred.
Turning to another vital factor in progress we find

moderate to throw no difficulty in the way of the indus-
trious settler who desires to purchase and improve a
farm of moderate extent.” The position taken up by
Lord Grey is not altered by the questions of perpetual
leasehold or freehold in regard to agricultural selections,
and altogether his summing up on a complicated ques-
tion may be taken as applicable to all time.
In two directions during the year 1854 there were
events which were of great moment to the country,
one having relation to horticulture, in aid of which a
successful show was held; the other was the foundation
of a Pastoral and Agricultural Association, the scope
of which was destined to enlarge beyond the wildest
D
that the year 1854 brought the consecration of the
Anglican Church in George Street, which was to become
St. John’s Pro-Cathedral. The service of consecration
was performed by the Bishop of Newcastle. In that
year also there arrived at the Congregational Church
at Ipswich one whose name, through his son, was to
become known not only in Australia but also throughout
the Empire as one of the founders of Federated Aus-
tralia, for the Rev. E. Griffith, who took charge of
the church, was the father of the late Sir Samuel Griffith,
Premier and subsequently Chief Justice of Queensland,
and still later President of the High Court of Australia.
Steps were taken at this time to establish a Baptist

Church. Members of the Roman Communion were
arranging to build a new church at Ipswich.
Meanwhile important changes were on foot in the
south; Sir Charles Fitzroy had been recalled from his
vice-regality. The Governor had not been one of the
successes in the representation of Royalty in these lands.
The popular voice when judgment is based on the known
is seldom wrong, and the fact that the Governor left
Sydney with no one to bid him God-speed is more
condemnatory of the administration of his office than
the bitterest invective. In passing from Australia he
passed from official life, for he was not again given
work under the Crown.
During the year the exports from the northern
districts, inclusive of the Clarence and Richmond, were
calculated at £1,500,000; those of Brisbane during the
first quarter of 1854 being given as £64,621, while
those from the Mary River during the same period were
£14,429, being greater by more than £5,000 than the
exports from the Clarence and Richmond. Ipswich as
a port was weakening, for the exports from the Bremer
totalled £477. Included in the return concerning
Brisbane’s export trade were two ships, the combined
cargoes of which were valued at £50,000. Very worthy
of note were the statistics as to livestock in the year
with which we are dealing. Returns are available for
seven districts which afterwards became portions of the
new colony. An eighth district, Leichhardt, had been
formed through pastoral enterprise, but there were as
yet no returns of stock. The returns from the seven
districts showed that the total number of sheep was
2,207,219, that of cattle 182,108, and of horses 9,779.
The statistics from the several districts were as
follow :
It is well, we think, to give the returns of the
Clarence district separately, for although they were
included in 1854 in those of the divisions which after-
wards became Queensland the Clarence was retained
by the southern colony. The statistics, indeed, afford
a very excellent reason why Sydney influences, despite
climatic, geographical, and trade affinity for the new
northern colony, should have fought so strenuously to
retain the district, the stock returns of which were
as follow:—Horses, 2,304; cattle, 115,812; sheep,
100,533. Inclusive of the Clarence, the sheep in the
northern districts were slightly more than one-fourth
of the total sheep in the colony.
The Estimates of the Legislative Council included
£3,000 for a bridge across Lockyer Creek and £BOO for
securing a water supply for Gladstone. The Estimates
also included the sum of £20,000 to be devoted to
the building of a penal establishment at Brisbane. The
age was one that had not yet risen to the altruism set
forth in a motto above a gaol in Rome, “Reform, not
punishment.” The hangings were frequent and ghastly
as to their details, for we are told that the condemned
were pushed up the ladder, and so into the unknown,
by the executioner. And yet, perhaps, it does not
savour of justice for one age to judge another harshly.
The enemy, in the form of savage and murderous
aborigines, was literally at the gate, and the black
police seem to have been required more than when
they were first organized. The blacks were treacherous
in the extreme. During a coasting trip to the north to
obtain specimens of natural history a party of five white
men and a Moreton Island aborigine landed on one of
the Percy Islands, south of the point which is now the
town of Mackay. Only one white man (Mr. Walter
Hill, who subsequently became superintendent of the
Botanic Gardens, Brisbane) returned. The black,
who had also escaped, informed Mr. Hill on his
return from a land cruise through the island that all
the others had been murdered by wild blacks. No
light was ever thrown on the tragedy. No wonder that
the ketch was sailed south to Brisbane with all speed.
Again, at the Circuit Court held in November, 1854,
two black miscreants were condemned to the scaffold.
One had terrorized localities not far from Brisbane for
years, and was proved to have murdered at least three
white persons, one of them a woman, in addition to
committing mny depdredations. The other aborigine,
who had been found guilty of killing a settler, suffered
death at the same time. Under the circumstances we
cannot wonder that stern methods were in use to safe-
guard the settlement against a danger which those of
a later generation who live in safety can hardly realize.
The name of Mr. Walter Hill and his marvellous
escape from death recall the eminent services he
rendered to the public while in charge of the Brisbane
Botanic Gardens, which at this time, as a result of the
visit of Sir Charles Fitzroy to Brisbane, assumed their
present form as one of the beauty spots of Australia.
It is also interesting to learn that the School of Arts
in its expansion gave excellent promise of the career
of usefulness to which future years bore witness.
To an extent which those who live in days of greater
literary privileges and conveniences can hardly under-
stand, the School of Arts ministered a refining and
enlightening influence. It was the centre of the mental
life of the community, and those who realize how much
book-friends can do to smooth asperities inseparable
from early days at the edge of the Empire will be
pleased and proud to hear that away back in 1854 the
library was at once well chosen and widely used. Yet


another token of progress along lines of practical
effort is to be found in the successful institution and
operation of building societies, where the instinct for
co-operation made for itself a worthy objective.
Sir William Denison, the new Governor, in many
respects was a person of high principles, but his
memory of opposition and proneness to resent it
militated against his usefulness. He had ideas,
although perchance he had also the vice of forcing them
nolens volens on other people. His belief that the
betterment of administration could be best attained by
municipal control was certainly on the best line of
thought, as it made for local government. Yet even
was seen that the attainment of the objects so ardently
desired and so long sought in the northern districts
would be only a matter of time.
It must afford the cynic much enjoyment to note
that in the passing of events at the period of which w©
write the all-important factor of unanimity in the
advocacy of separation was recognized and obeyed.
No sooner, however, was it seen that without doubt
separation was coming than local jealousies and a
struggle for first place arose again, and did much to
retard progress. Each district was sufficient for itself,
the local was all in all, and combination fell into the
background. Nothing more advantageous to strong

here he was fated to contribute to the wrong side of
weakness could be imagined. And it was just devotion
government was that the system was shrewdly adopted
by the opponents of separation, who saw in the proposal
a sop which might satisfy those who were clamouring
for the institution of a northern colony. The sugges-
tion, however, if it could have had weight at any time
in turning aside the current of popular opinion had
come too late. In Britain, facts were being recognized,
with the result that the Gordian knot was suddenly cut
by Lord John Russell, then at the Colonial Office, who
instructed the Governor (Sir William Denison) to
report fully on separation proposals. Thenceforth it

influences eagerly scanning the whole field for possible
weakness could be imagined. And it was just devotion
to the local and individual interests and the ignoring
of the good of the whole which probably delayed the
advent of autonomy in the northern settlement.
It is worthy of mention that the districts of
Clarence and Darling Downs at this time formed but
one electorate, and this fact perhaps more than any
other enables one to realize how easy it must have been
to overlook subjects of importance in such a large
constituency. Mr. Leslie, who represented the elec-
torate in the Legislative Council, had resigned his
seat, and in the ensuing contest there were four


candidates, Mr. Hood of Talgai, Mr. G. San deman, and
Messrs. T. He Lacy Moffatt and Holt of Sydney. The
two latter gentlemen, however, retired before the poll
was taken. Mr. Hood was elected by a majorty of
fifty-six. The records of the election show that Mr.
John Douglas nominated the successful candidate, and
thus inaugurated his own career in politics, in which he
was destined to come to the front.
Sir William Denison soon gave proof of capacity
for formulating new projects with a practical touch,
for in 1855 he urged the construction of light railways
“giving an average speed of ten ox twelve miles an
hour by employing the material which Nature has placed
at our disposal.” He saw a vast benefit to be derived
from the scheme, and we who know the boon light
agricultural lines have been to farming districts cannot
aver that he would have been disappointed had he seen
his objects attained. Whether the Governor’s ideas in
regard to the advantages derivable from cheap railway
lines gave the cue to Mr. Hood, the new member for
Clarence and Darling Downs, we know not, but be that
as it might, the representative in question moved that
there be a survey and estimate for the construction of
a tram-road from the head of navigation of the river
at Ipswich to the Darling Downs and thence by way of
Warwick to Tenterfield and New England. The grant
sought for the work was ,£3,000, but centralization,
impersonated in the Legislature, fought strongly to the
last gasp, and the motion was withdrawn.
Shrewd thinkers in Sydney had ere this accepted
the inevitable as to separation, and apart from the adjust-
ment of the debt the main point in the burning question
was that the south should make a strategic retreat and
carry as much away from the political field as could be
secured. That success was attained is proved by the
fact that the Clarence district was south and not north
of the dividing line between the old colony and
the new.
In the course of the year immigration went on
apace, and in all 2,500 persons arrived from the United
Kingdom, seven vessels being used to bring them to
More ton Bay. Considerable activity occurred as the
result of Mr. Lord’s efforts in Germany, and in all there
were 1,000 natives of that country added to the popula-
tion of the northern districts in 1855. It cannot be
questioned that the old points of fixity and cheapness
of labour were moving influences in seeking German
settlers, for the latter worked for less wages than would
British people, and beyond that were willing to bind
themselves by an engagement for a term after they
landed and while they gained “colonial experience.”
Such facts are very interesting, for they go to show
the trend of thought at that time. The tendency to divert
action from the interests of the community as a whole
to that of a class was never perhaps more clearly set
forth than in the remarks of Mr. Hodgson at a dinner
tendered to him before he left Australia on a visit to
England. For the guest of the evening, speaking in
advocacy of the grazing interests on the Downs, asked,
“Who would be mad enough to attempt cultivation on
that immense tract of country known as the Darling
Downs, which feeds nearly one million of sheep, exclusive
of cattle and horses ? If it were practicable,” the
speaker added, “do you think that we would not one
and all grow wheat for our own consumption ?” Sub-
sequent facts in arable farming on the Downs have very
rudely contradicted Mr. Hodgson’s statement. The
same tendency was also made clear in the contention
advanced by Mr. Hodgson and those who thought with
him that the act of leasing gave a prescriptive right as
to permanent holding. The statement that times
change and we change with them seems to be dis-
proved by the sympathy evinced in Australia generally
by the appeal in a letter from the Queen for aid in
relieving the distress of the widows and orphans of
soldiers who had fallen in the Crimean War, for in
truth both the necessity and the sympathy it evoked
are alike similar to the happenings during the Great
War. Meetings in furtherance of the good object were
held, and in the districts immediately linked with
Moreton Bay and Wide Bay the sum of £2,570,144 was
subscribed. As the year 1855 was fading to its close
the tidings of the fall of Sebastopol were received with
great enthusiasm.
At this time the menace of murderous attacks by
the aborigines became intensified, until it almost seemed
that a state of war might result as a necessity in protec-
tion. Again was the evil of control from a distance
exemplified, for just at the time when police protection
appeared to have been required most a sergeant and
six black troopers who had been stationed in Brisbane
were withdrawn. How bold and daring the tribesmen
had become may be gauged by the fact that in the
Burnett a camp of native police was attacked, two of
the troopers being killed and three wounded; while in
the Wide Bay districts two settlers were killed and
two seriously wounded. Stations were robbed and
houses were pillaged.
Although the central Colonial Government in the
south seemed to be oblivious of the dangers due to the
depredations of bloodthirsty blacks, they could be
keenly alive to expenditure in any of the northern
districts, and thus it came that a Committee of the
Legislative Council criticized sharply the action of the
late Governor (Sir Charles Fitzroy) in appointing a
Government Resident at Port Curtis. It was considered
that several thousand pounds had been spent without
commensurate advantage, and it was suggested that the
appointment of a police magistrate would fully provide
for all interests both of the port and the district, the
36

land sales of which totalled £16,729, the expenditure
from first to last having been £22,534. And the Com-
mittee somewhat despondently concludes with the
statement that “there seemed little prospect of a
further increase of population.”
The traffic by road to Ipswich and onward over the
range had shown a marked increase, as was evidenced
by the reservation of village land at Gatton and another
point on the journey and also by the marked increase
in the prices paid for the rights of ferries at Brisbane,
which had reached a sum of £3OO per annum. So
hopeful were the developments in this direction that a
bridge was advocated, and there was recourse to the
time-honoured expedient of
floating a company to pro-
vide the necessary capital,
which was calculated at
£lO,OOO, a roseate-tinged
estimate placing the receipts
at £l,OOO per annum. Un-
fortunately for the pro-
moters, the Governor, who
was consulted, had ideas
on the subject and favoured
a steam ferry. The time
for the bridge was not
yet. In another direction
there was movement for
required improvement, and
a report on the channel
of the Brisbane River was
obtained. Again nothing
materialized. Circumstances
for some action were, how-
ever, favourable, for the
daring master of a ship
homeward bound crossed
the bar without the assist-
ance of a steamer, and
the possibility of traffic with
London being established
at Brisbane, instead of
the roadstead, moved even Sydney to action; all too
imperfect, however, for there was no placing of lights
which were urgently required, while the appointment
of a pilot was rather curiously arranged, a master
mariner who had no knowledge of the river being chosen.
It is manifest that a person with local knowledge was
not required, as the notice to possible applicants for the
post only arrived at Brisbane on the day the appoint-
ment was made. The growing desire for self-
government seemed destined to be strengthened by
incidents on every side, for owing to the delay in the
steamer starting from Sydney to Brisbane the Circuit
Court judge, prosecutor, and other members of the Bar
did not arrive until four days after the date appointed
for the opening of the sittings, and in the meantime
litigants, jury, and witnesses had assembled in readiness
for the opening of the court. The outcry against the
expense incurred and the inconvenience suffered may
easily be imagined, and the indigation was all he more
acute as the legislative powers at Sydney had but
recently shelved the appointment of a resident judge
for the northern districts. The establishment of a rifle
corps at this time is worthy of chronicle, all the more
as it represented a strengthening of action against the
marauders of the bush. And turning to quite another
subject the action of the committee appointed to control
the Botanic Gardens in keep-
ing the gates fast locked on
Sundays certainly savoured
of Sabbatarianism in high
places that gave great um-
brage in other quarters.
A very satisfactory re-
venue was that from Crown
land sales at that time.
During the fifteen months
ending June 30, 1855, the
returns from this source
were £25,347 at Brisbane
and £14,355 18s. at
Ipswich. It has been stated
that the indirect payments
to officials for doing this
work had been much in
excess of just remunera-
tion, and that strong com-
ment had been excited,
with the result that a
system of commission on the
receipts was substiuted.
This, if an improvement,
obviously left much to be
desired, for the commission
for eleven months preceding
the date already mentioned
totalled in the case of the Government Resident £1,156
Bs. Id., while the Police Magistrate at Ipswich drew
£B5l 15s. 7d. for the performance of similar duties.
What was the first loss in Brisbane through the
destruction by fire of an industrial estabishment took
place during July, 1855, when Mr. Pettigrew’s sawmill
was burnt. Much sympathy for the proprietor was
evinced and found practical outcome in a public sub-
scription in aid of the loss. During the year a sawmill
was built by Mr. Fleming at Ipswich, initiating an
important industry there.
The export trade during 1855 gave encouraging
evidence of the satisfactory advancement of the northern

districts. Owing to the fact that there was an inter-
mission in the preparation of returns, only figures for
the last quarter of the annual period are available, but
they suffice to prove that the exports from Brisbane for
the quarter in question were not far short of those for
the northern districts as a whole during 1849. The
returns were:
Brisbane ... £94,970
Wide Bay ... 23,066
Port Curtis ... ... ... 1,032
£119,068
Included in the above return were the following
statistics for districts to the south of the territory which
afterwards became Queensland, raising the total exports
to the sum of £145,135 ;
Clarence £14,689
Richmond ... ... ... 10,353
Tweed River ... ... 1,025
£26,067
The bulk of the trade as in previous years comprised
products from grazing stations. The inward tonnage
at Moreton Bay totalled £9,237.
During the year important work in exploration was
begun, and extended into 1856, for on August 12 an
expedition which had left Sydney the previous month
in charge of Mr. A. C. Gregory sailed for Victoria River
on the northern coast in two vessels, the “Monarch”
and ‘Tom Tough,’ The objects of the journey were
to ascertain the possibility of linking communication
between the settlements of South Australia and
Western Australia with the northern coast of the
eastern colony. The geographical features of the north-
west were to be noted with the characteristics of the
country and its inhabitants. Search was to be made
for a navigable river on the north-western coast and its
utility for trade was to be reported. Full particulars
of the work of the expedition are given in the chapters
in this book dealing with explorers.
Early in the year 1856 had come the elections for
the Legislative Assembly in Sydney constituted under
the bicameral system of Government, which had become
law. The northern districts were allotted five members,
the total number of members in the Chamber being
fifty-four. Mr. Holt and Mr. Richardson were elected
for Stanley Boroughs, the unsuccessful candidates being
Messrs. F. A. Forbes and A. Macalister. Mr. H. Buckley
defeated Mr. W. M. Dorsey for Stanley County, while
the electors of Burnett, Wide Bay, and Maranoa
returned unopposed Mr. Gordon Sandeman, the request
that he would contest the seat being thus justified. Mr.
Clarke Irvine became member for the Clarence and Hew
England districts, the defeated candidate being Mr.
John Mackenzie. It is worthy of noting that among
the nominees to the Upper House were the three judges
of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice becoming the
President. The Ministry under the new Constitution
comprised five members, Mr. S. A. Donaldson being
Premier; Mr. MacArthur, Colonial Treasurer; Mr. W.
M. Manning, Attorney-General; Mr. Darvall, Solicitor-
General; and Mr. Nicholls, Auditor-General. Parlia-
ment was opened on May 22, Mr. Cooper having been
elected Speaker at a sitting held on the previous day.
Later Mr. Holt became Colonial Treasurer, Mr.
MacArthur having resigned.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE COMING OF AGE OF A COLONY.
The lists were now set and all things in readiness
for the contest in regard to separation. There were very
few in the south who had fought strenuously a popular
system of Government who realized that the change was
but the prelude to another and greater one, or perchance
the Crown colony rule might have been undisturbed,
for the elective chamber was but the ante-room of a
Legislature for the northern districts. Parliament could
not have been a very happy family, for there were no
fewer than three Ministries in four months. The Cabinet
which assumed office on September 24 was as follows :
—Mr. Parker, Premier; Mr. Donaldson, Colonial
Treasurer; Mr. Hay, Attorney-General; Mr. Murray,
Auditor-General; and Mr. Darvall, Solicitor-General.
In view of future events it is well to bear in mind that
the Cabinet thus formed was wholly opposed to separa-
tion. The subject, in truth, oscillated now to one side
and again to the other, hopes and fears by turn swaying
the minds of the opposing parties. That interests were
conflicting may be realized by the member for Clarence
and Darling Downs (Mr. Irvine) urging the need for
the Clarence and Richmond districts maintaining their
political and commercial relations with Sydney.
Meanwhile the Governor (Sir William Denison)
had performed the duty placed in his hands by the
Colonial Office and reported upon the separation pro-
posals, which he opposed. The Governor seemed to see
but one subject in the question—the welfare and the
interest of the mother-settlement. He saw in the lease-
hold system in use for pastoral holdings the denial of


prosperity and, indeed, all the elements of decay. He
argued from the one fact that in the northern districts
there were only 420 squatters, who had held 2,500,000
acres of land at a rental of £13,608 per annum. He
dwelt on the small expenditure on permanent improve-
ments, forgetful that the latter factor was ruled by the
necessities of the industry as it was then, and he was
oblivious of the fact that the system must be evolved
and changed through the very permanence he denied.
He omitted to remember when he wrote his report that
station properties had a marketable value based mainly
on factors other than the improvements he emphasized.
And that is the most regrettable aspect of the Gover-
nor’s report to the Colonial Office. Astounding—no
other word can be used—was his statement that a desire
to return to the days of convict transportation animated
So came finality to the question as a whole, although
important points remained to be settled. The first in
the Minister’s opinion was that of a boundary line,
which he opined would run not far south of 30° S.
latitude, the line to run so as to suit the natural features
of the country. The second subject for consideration
was the future government of the separated portion.
The third question was the allotment of the debt of the
province. It may readily be imagined that the question
of the boundary line between the mother colony and
her aspiring daughter aroused antagonism as keen and
rancour as bitter as the main subject of separation. It
did more. It tried men out and tested their faithfulness
to principle and duty. We have already seen that it
did so in the case of Mr. Clarke Irvine, and later it
acted in moving to another plane of action the member
TWEED HEADS, THE STARTING POINT OF THE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN QUEENSLAND AND NEW SOUTH WALES.
all those who petitioned for separation, save the trading
population of the towns of Brisbane and Ipswich, whose
inducement “was the prospect of a large local expendi-
ture.” It is needless to refer to the warfare to which
such a report gave rise. “The knights are dust
and their swords are rust.” The energetic effort
to block separation was in the end useless. Mr.
Labouchere, who was then Minister for the Colonies,
had other sources of information and used them, and
the fallacy of Sir William Denison’s report was
emphasized with crushing severity in a despatch, for the
Secretary of State coldly stated, “I have now to inform
you” (the Governor) “that Her Majesty’s Government
has determined that the time has arrived when this
separation would be desirable.”
for Stanley Boroughs, Mr. Holt, who having obtained
a seat in the Cabinet, becoming Colonial Treasurer, did
as the Cabinet did. The electors had no illusions left
to them on the subject when Mr. Holt voted for a motion
introduced into the Assembly by Mr. Hargreaves,
member for Macleay, to the effect that the settlement
of the boundary line between New South Wales should
be postponed until the opinion of the inhabitants of
the Clarence and Richmond districts had been ascer-
tained. The motion was also significant for its censure
of the British Government in granting separation. That
motion was carried by thiry-four votes to four.
Significant of consistency was also the attitude
of Mr. Deas Thomson in the Legislative Council when
Mr. Hargreave’s resolution reached that Chamber, for


that honourable member when supporting the motion
took the opportunity of making a public recantation,
expressing regret that when in London he had advised
Mr. Labouchere of the necessity that existed for includ-
ing the Clarence and Richmond in the new colony. And
one cannot but realize that the jealousy of district for
district and town for town had much to do with the
defeat of the northern settlement in a most important
question, the handling of which has still power to arouse
indignation. And of course Mr. Hargreaves’ motion,
approved of by both Chambers of the Colonial Parlia-
ment, implied delay in action. It is a pleasure to turn
from the paltry and weak to joy at attaining an object
long sought and most worthy of seeking. Never, it is
stated, was there so much flag-waving in Brisbane as
took place when the decision of the British Government
became known. Joy overflowed into a public meeting,
at which gratitude to the Queen was expressed in an
address and thanks to those who had aided the move-
ment voiced in resolution. In the long last Dr. Lang
found appreciation, for he was the special recipient of
thanks “for his great and long-continued efforts to
secure to the district the desired boon of separation.”
Turning to local questions in Brisbane the records
show that immigration during 1856 totalled 1,258
persons. Again, the seamy side of administration was
shown in the transference of some of the newcomers to
the south, a step as much against the wish of the
residents as it was contrary to justice; and a similar
course was pursued in regard to some 350 Germans. A
well-devised step was taken by stockholders in safely
guarding their interests, for during the year the
Northern District Mutual Protection Society was
Instituted. Preliminary action for the establishment of
a branch of the Supreme Court was provided in a grant
of £4,864, but the resident judge (Mr. Justice Milford)
did not open the court until April, 1857. Justice
Milford, however, was soon transferred to Sydney,
Justice Lutchwyche taking his place. Mr. Ratcliffe
Pring, who afterwards became a judge of the Supreme
Court in Queensland was appointed Crown Prosecutor;
Mr. W. A. Brown, Sheriff; and Mr. Pickering, Official
Assignee in Insolvency and Curator of Intestate
Estates. Strangely enough the judge held the position
of Commissioner of Insolvency, and thus on the Bench
heard appeals from himself as Commissioner.
During the nine months ending September 30 the
exports from Brisbane bore emphatic witness to very
material advancement, totalling £301,392 in value,
despite the fact that drought conditions with their
depression and anxiety had been experienced.
While the people of the northern districts were
waiting expectantly, and the completion of separation was
delayed owing to preliminaries protracted through
changes in the British Cabinet, it will be well to turn
to legislation in the Parliament of New South Wales
for the last time of direct interest to the north. In
September, 1857, a new Ministry took office in Sydney r
of which Mr. C. Cowper was Premier. Changes later
occurred that need only be mentioned as causing Mr.
John Robertson (subsequently Sir John Robertson) to
assume the portfolio of Lands.
A measure introduced by the new Government gave
tardy recognition to the fact that the representation of
the northern districts had been unjustly inadequate, for
the Electoral Act passed gave nine members, and an
election took place. Separation, however, robbed the
contest of much of its wonted interest.
It will be necessary to refer to the land policy
introduced by Mr. Robertson, who won for himself the
sobriquet of 'Tree-selection Jack,” for its influence on
land administration in the north was great. The new
measure in truth was entitled to be termed a reform. It
provided for a reduction in the price of Crown lands
sold by auction to ss. per acre. It gave the right of
free selection over all the Crown lands, surveyed or
unsurveyed, the selling price being £1 per acre, one half
of the payment to be due when selection took place the
other at subsequent periods. The minimum area that
could be acquired was 80 acres and the maximum
302 acres. Events then in the future have given a
humorous touch to Mr. A. Macalister’s heated assertion
in the course of a speech in the north that “the Land
Bill if passed would ruin the country.” Predictions
always involve a risk. Another subject of legislation
which may also be deemed to have been of the nature
of reform was to be found in assessment. The Act
dealing with that question aroused bitter opposi-
tion, as may be realized when we think of the interests
it affected. It certainly provided for drastic changes.
In the past the assessment on sheep had been Id. per
head or 21s. Bd. per 1,000, while the rate for cattle was
Hd. and for horses 3d. per head respectively on the
run, or for which the run was estimated to afford
grazing. The new Act raised the payments to £7 10s.
per 1,000 sheep, and a proportionate increase took place
in the case of cattle and horses. There was also an
alteration in the method- of fixing rents on new and also
renewed leases. Previously the value had been at the
rate of £lO for the first 4,000 sheep and £2 10s. for
every 1,000 over that number. Under the Act new
leases were to be assessed at the rate of £1 per square
mile, while the rate payable on renewed leases was £2
per square mile. So great was the antagonism aroused
among the pastoral lessees that legal opinion was sought
as to the legality of the Act, and when efforts in that
direction failed there was a scheme proposed to defy
the law. Wise counsels, however, prevailed. Mr. W.


Coote in dealing with the subject sums it up in the
words which probably set forth the case. He says:
‘ The impression it derives from a careful consideration
of all the facts is that the runs were known to be
generally assessed at a carrying power much below their
real capacity and that the Act w T as designed to meet a
contingency which could not otherwise be easily if at
all provided for.”
Meanwhile the search for gold in the northern
districts, which was persevered in although perhaps
intermittently, found some reason for its action, for
intense excitement was aroused in tidings from Glad-
stone that gold had been
discovered at Canoona, seven
miles from the Fitzroy
River. Captain O’Connell,
who had become Commis-
sioner for Lands when a
police magistrate was sub-
stituted for a Resident at
Gladstone, reported fav-
ourably. Gladstone was
deserted, and there were
soon eighty men on the
field, where it was stated
an ounce of gold per day
was being won by individual
miners. It was not long
before steamers and sailing
vessels were busy trans-
porting men to the new
El Dorado, and it is stated
that there were at one
time 10,000 on the field.
Then came the reaction and
disappointment, for the
gold “petered out,” and
as a result anger on the
part of those who found
themselves stranded through
the lure of golden dreams.
The authorities had made
preparation for a mining-
field on an extensive scale,
but the officials appointed were not required, for ere
long Canoona district was deserted. It is instructive,
however, to note that from the gold-rush the town of
Rockhampton was born, taking form at a point of the
Fitzroy thirty miles from Canoona. A land sale of
town lots in due course was held, and resulted in half-
allotments on the bank of the river being sold for an
average price of £7O, while other areas were disposed
of for £l7 each. While in itself a failure, Canoona was
in its effect a momentous discovery, for it linked up the
northern districts with the colonies in the south as
auriferous-bearing country. Thenceforward men hoped,
and the gold-digger, perhaps the most sanguine of
mortals, toiled, sustained by the thought that the big
field must come—as indeed it did in many a district.
Sir William Denison strongly favoured the extension
of local government, and so far he was in line with
the trend of liberal thought in a more liberal age,
but it is questionable whether his belief that local
government should form the school where could be
trained legislators for Parliament is to be accepted as
a sound argument, although it must be conceded that
to a certain extent facts and experience verify his
reasoning. Be that as it
may, however, it cannot
be doubted that to the
ideas of the Governor on
the subject Australia owes
the speeding-up of muni-
cipal administration, which
but for the energy with
which he advocated the
system must have been con-
siderably delayed. “The
Municipalities Act,” 22 Vic-
toria, No. 13, New South
Wales, became law on Octo-
ber 27, 1858, and it was
not long before the people
of the northern districts
began to consider the ad-
visableness of adopting the
system. To Ipswich belongs
the honour of initiating
action for constituting a
municipal council, for in
January, 1859, there was
a proposal that the town
should be divided into three
wards. For some reason
somewhat difficult to under-
stand, opinion seemed to
view the nomenclature of
mayor and aldermen either
as savouring too much of
Conservatism, or perchance it was modesty that moved
the leaders in the movement to prefer the terms
president and councillors. Again, however, there was
experienced that fatal lack of unanimity which has since
in many a district and many a town given the central
Government the opportunity to refuse or postpone a
request. So local disagreements seemed to have acted in
municipal control, for when the forces could be moved
to stand sufficiently in line the reply came from Sydney
that the matter would be left to the new Colonial
Authorities to deal with.
SIR MAURICE O'CONNELL.


First in the field, it was not until March, 1860,
that municipal goverment was granted to Ipswich. It
is often very difficult to understand how facts affect
certain mentalities, and thus it certainly does perplex
one that action for securing municipal government for
Brisbane having been urged it should be opposed on the
ground that separation being near the subject could be
well adjourned, which seems much like saying that
because we shall have dinner to-morrow there is no need
for dinner to-day. And again there was recourse to
petition and counter-petition; in truth, political thought
of that day seems to have circled in an orbit, the centre
of which was a petition to someone or other. The
seamy side of progress by this means was turned to the
light in the municipal question, for it is stated that the
bona fides of the signatures was hotly disputed. It is
interesting to note that in those far-off events human
nature was just the same as it is to-day, for the expense
of carrying on the town council was calculated at £550,
of which it was proposed to devote £2OO to a salary for
the mayor. This gave detractors the opportunity of
asserting that the cost of administration would absorb
all the rates.
Circumstances, however, were kind, and there arose
an important subject which acted like oil on the troubled
waters of local jealousies, for when money was sought
from the Government wherewith to repair the water
reservoir, the Brisbane people were not unreasonably
informed that the work came under the jurisdiction of
a municipal council, and if the stage had not been
reached when that system could be wisely introduced,
then the stage had not been attained when a reservoir
was required. There was here what may be termed a
brutal frankness in stating facts that seemed to have
acted as a tonic on the community, and the signatures in
the offending counter-petition having been condemned,
Brisbane was duly proclaimed a municipality on Sep-
tember 7, 1859. The election for members of the
council took place on October 12, the declaration of the
poll being made on the following day. Thus came local
government to the northern settlement, the chief town,
despite all cavilling to the contrary, very rightly giving
a lead to all the other centres of population. It was
fitting that municipal decentralization should proceed
and act as the harbinger of that larger form of self-
rule which was nearing consummation.
The personnel of the first town council comprised
Messrs. John Petrie, Patrick Mayne, T. B. Stephens,
Joshua Jeays, A. J. Hockings, G. Edmonstone, R.
Cribb, George Warren, and W. S. Sutton. The aldermen
on assembling chose Mr. John Petrie as their chairman,
and the devotion to the best interests of the community
which the first mayor had shown during a long term of
years since the days of small things amply justified the
choice of his fellow-aldermen. Judging by statements
concerning the streets of "Brisbane Town at that
period it lay for the first town council to win credit, as
did an English general in policing the Highlands after
the “Forty-five” rebellion, and of whom it was said,
“Had you seen these roads before they were made, you
would hold up your hands and bless General Wade,
for we are told that there were practically no roads
outside the town, while the term “street” was in the
main honorary, and interchangeable with another term,
“vacant allotment.”
In other phases the community developed during
the year, which saw the Anglican Church of St. Paul s
at Ipswich opened, while Brisbane was constituted a
diocese of the Roman Communion, Bishop Quinn being
consecrated. Efforts were made to inrprove the naviga-
tion of the river as far as Ipswich, logs and other
obstructions being removed. We have a clear indication
that during the time of which we write the three towns,
in addition to the capital, which were of most importance
were Ipswich, Drayton, and Maryborough, for in them
circuit courts were established. And yet there were
signs that things were not altogether balanced justly in
the apportionment of emoluments to officials in the
service of the Government, for while, as we have noticed,
the remuneration of the officers in whose hands was
the sale of Crown lands was unduly large, it was found
necessary to increase the salaries of the Crown Prosecutor
and the Sheriff of the Supreme Court from £2OO to £SOO
and from £l5O to £450 per annum respectively. In the
Customs Department there were changes at this time, Mr.
Duncan, who had held the position of collector, being
transferred on promotion to Sydney, and Mr. Thornton,
who controlled affairs for many years subsequently,
taking his place.
During the year there was another successful effort
to extend knowledge concerning the little-known terri-
tory in the north, and George Elphinstone Dalrymple
in an exploration journey discovered excellent country
fit for occupation for grazing purposes in the neighbour-
hood of the Burdekin.
Meanwhile all eyes, both in the northern settlement
and New South Wales, were intent on observing things
political in the districts of Clarence, Richmond, and
New England, where it was known the burning question
of boundary between the Mother Colony and her aspiring
daughter would be decided. Work through petitions
was going on vigorously, but there -was the usual outcry
of fraudulent signatures, and as an evidence of the
injustice with which partisanship in the south ruled,
we are told that a petition from the residents of the
Clarence River district, who desired to throw in their
lot with the new colony, was treated as though it had
not been. Conflicting political opinions were again in
evidence, for there was a petition from Brisbane, in


which the signatories desired that the settlement of the
question as to boundary should be postponed until
the population of the Clarence, Richmond, and New
England districts had increased to 10,000 souls. There
was against this argument a counter-petition deprecating
further delay in the decision of the question, while yet
another section asked for a reconsideration of the whole
subject of boundaries. The warring elements of discord
were destined not to wreck, or even protract any longer,
the all-important point of autonomy, for in the
month of May came the tidings that the Colonial Office
had decided that the separated territory should comprise
all the country east of the South Australian border
In the following month there was a further Order-in-
Council, empowering the Governor to make laws and
provide for the administration of justice in the new
colony.
Thus came the accomplishment of the desires of a
community the members of which realized the enormous
potentialities of the territory, of which they knew they
were only the pioneers. To the Mother Colony were
given the districts of Clarence, Richmond, and New
England, but perchance as a counterpoise, the hopes
entertained that New South Wales might claim and
secure land northward of the Moreton Bay districts were
crushed by the boundaries fixed by the Minister for the
CHURCH OF ST. MARY, IPSWICH.
north of a line running west from Point Danger. The
question of the apportionment of the public debt was
to be settled by commissioners to be appointed by north
and south, with appeal to a. referee, and a curious
incident in the winning of separation is that disputes
on this point, or in action, led to the shelving of the
whole question. It was settled. Thereafter the wheels
of departmental procedure in Britain revolved with
unwonted speed, for a Bill providing for separation was
introduced into the House of Commons, and was
followed by an Order-in-Council on May 13, by which
the Colony of Queensland was constituted and Sir
George Ferguson Bowen appointed the first Governor.
Colonies, who was then the Duke of Newcastle. The
rough-and-ready system adopted in regard to the line
of demarcation between the old and the new colony gave
rise to much discontent, owing obviously to the absence
of local knowledge in fixing the bounds, for there was
loud complaint regarding the waste of time, and con-
cerning the general forgetfuless of important interests
in carrying the line through individual holdings, thus
dividing them, so that one part was in Queensland and
the other in New South Wales. When all the disabilities
are weighed, however, it is seen that the system adopted,
if inconvenient in some cases, was the best under the
circumstances, if we acknowledge the argument that in

all cases the object must be the greatest good for the
greatest number, for undoubtedly a prolonged survey
of all the country with special attention to the interests
of those immediately concerned could only have had
one result—the postponement of the whole question of
separation.
The argument used in Brisbane in regard to what
are now the northern districts of New South Wales
applied equally to the settlement of the boundary line.
It was well to seize the occasion as it came and be
thankful. Sydney influences had taught the north that
every pretext would be used to prolong the decision, and
always to the injury of the separating districts. We
have already traced with some fullness the bi-cameral
system of Government granted to New South Wales, and
need only say here that with the one exception of the
franchise question it was adopted as the Constitution of
Queensland. In all the important details arising from
the creation of the new autonomous colony there was
provision for prompt action, for the Governor of New
South Wales was instructed to summon to the Legisla-
tive Council of the new dominion members not exceeding
five in number, and who would hold office for a term
of four years; while to the Governor of Queensland was
given authority to add to that number as he thought
fit, the term of those so appointed being for life. To
Sir William Denison, the Governor of New South Wales,
was allotted the work of dividing the new colony into
electorates for the Legislative Assembly and the distri-
bution of representation, and in the same hands was
placed the arrangement for the first election for the
Lower House. The suffrage was based on that set forth
in the New South Wales Constitution Act, and was not
so broad as the system provided for in the Electoral
Act passed by the Mother Colony in 1858, and which
gave practically manhood suffrage, all males over the
age of twenty-one years being entitled to vote. The
Constitution Act applied to Queensland, on the other
hand, had for minimum of franchise qualification the
payment by lodgers of TIO in annual rental for a term
of six months previous to registration. In obedience to
his instructions, Sir William Denison on December 20,
1859, proclaimed sixteen constituencies, with, in all,
twenty-six members for the Legislative Assembly.
The representation may be usefully divided into
three sections, and was as follows:
Sever© strictures have been made against Sir
William Denison for the manner in which he allotted
membership to the various constituencies, and he has
been accused of favouring the squatters, men whom
he had but a short time previously, in the report made
to the Colonial Office on separation, stated were unstable
and not firmly founded in their tenure or their property.
The allegation, however, hardly seems to be just, for,
as will be seen by the statement concerning the elec-
torates we have given, the allotment appears to have
been made on a group-po|3ulation basis. The point on
which the Governor seems fairly open to criticism is
that he did not individualize electorally the towns other
than. North and South Brisbane, Fortitude Valley,
Ipswich, Drayton, Toowoomba, and Warwick. One
looks in vain for the representation of Maryborough,
and there were other centres of population which should
have been included in order to balance urban against
rural, that is pastoral, interests. In scanning the popula-
tion of the Western Downs, as compared with the
Burnett (residents of which were almost four times as
numerous), it seems very extraordinary that the thinly-
settled constituency should be allotted the same number
of members (two) as that near the coast. It is
unfortunate that Sir William Denison should have laid
himself open to charges of rancour and partiality in the
most important duty it was his lot to perform.
We have said that the Governor of New South
Wales was given the duty of appointing the first
members of the Queensland Legislative Council, and in
his action here he seemed to have been more happy in
his choice and just in his judgment, for the men chosen
were assuredly representative citizens and well worthy
of the honour conferred on them. They were Sir
Charles Nicholson, Sir Maurice O’Connell, Messrs.
John Balfour, Francis Edward Bigge, Alfred Edward
Compeigne, George Fullaerton, John James Gallaway,
James Laidley, John Frederick Macdougall, Robert
George Massie, and William Henry Yaldwyn.
Perhaps no country unassisted by the not always
stable prosperity due to gold-finding ever advanced with


more promising rapidity than did the districts which
had now become Queensland. At the end of 1859 the
population was calculated to be 25,000. The return of
residents in the districts in the year 1856 was stated to
have been 8,575, and in one year after that the numbers
had risen to 17,082. In like manner there had been an
extraordinary enlargement in the area available for
occupation, which was 174,600 square miles in 1857, as
compared with 58,860 square miles in the previous year.
Turning to the pastoral industry at the founding
of the new colony, we find that a calculation gave
2,000,000 sheep, 300,000 cattle, and 20,000 horses. It
will be interesting to those who find pleasure in com-
paring then and now to learn that very little attention
of that cereal in the colony, and all had been grown in
the Brisbane district. If a larger area had ever been
cultivated, the facts show that the results had not been
satisfactory. There is no mention of cotton at this
time, and none of tobacco, though there is reason to
believe that there were small patches (garden areas) on
some of the stations. It is alleged that there was a
tendency on the part of the pastoralist to decry agri-
culture, but it would probably be more in accordance
with the truth were we to attribute the disparagement
of arable farming by the squatters as being due to
self-centred belief that the only industry worthy of atten-
tion was that which they pursued. A few years were to
pass before the selector was to be recognized as a possible
BEATTIE’S WHARF, PETRIE BIGHT, IN THE EARLY DAYS, SHOWING MR, PETRIE'S HOUSE ON THE LEFT,
was paid to arable farming in those early days. This is
proved by placing the stock return we have given against
the fact that some 2,000 acres only were under cultiva-
tion, although 80,000 acres had been alienated when
separation came, and the cultivated area had enlarged in
1861 to 3,351 acres. For the most part maize was grown,
as were also fodder crops and potatoes. Even then fruit-
growing claimed attention and the banana was coming
into prominence. Of all the pretty pictures of
possibilities painted in Dr. Lang’s first book on the
settlement scarcely anything had been realized, and
any argument as to habitat of wheat seemed quite
beside the mark, for there were in 1860 but 18 acres
rival to the pastoralist—one who has practically modified
by his interaction the whole outlook of the grazier.
What agriculture, mining, and other industrial pro-
cesses represented at this time may be gauged by the
value of the land cultivated on the one hand and the
works and property utilized in industries on the other,
both being appraised at £IOO,OOO. The weath of the com-
munity at separation has been placed at £4,250,000.
Comparing the exports of 1849 with those in 1859, we
find a leap forward during the ten years from £120,000
to half a million. Nascent industries were indicated in
the value of coal exported to the East Indies, £331, and
timber £430, during the first month of the colony’s


life under Sir George Bowen. How absolutely pre-
eminent wool-growing was is seen from the fact that
during the same monthly period the export of wool
totalled in value £48,410.
Of the four banking institutions in operation the
Bank of Australasia held first place in the estimation of
business people, the Australian Joint Stock Bank
coming second, while the Bank of New South Wales and
the Union Bank followed in the order given. It is
stated that the value of the coin in circulation was
£50,000 and that of notes £30,000; the deposits are
calculated to have been £IBO,OOO, while the liabilities
are placed at £357,000 with the notes, bills and debts
due at £390,000. Also of interest is it to remember
that in the days of which we speak Ipswich as a banking
centre asserted its rivalry with the capital, and perhaps
in the eyes of some made good the assertion by the
superiority of the banking buildings in the up-river town.
It is noteworthy that in those early days there
was a dugong fishery, and that industry, like that of
cotton cultivation, causes one to wonder why advance-
ment has not been commensurate with potentialities.
Soap was produced, there being one factory, and candles
were manufactured and salt made. We have already
referred to the two coal mines in East Moreton, and it
is satisfactory to find that the output had amounted to
5,000 tons, valued at £3,500. Of the four steam
sawmills we must always speak with deepest interest.
They meant so much to development then, they have
meant so much to development since, for the timber-
getter has been a pioneer hardly valued according to his
deserts.
The coming of autonomous Government, the Con-
stitution of the colony, and what it meant, render
necessary a glance at various phases of life as they were
when separation took place. Administration had been
carried on by Captain Wickham, resident in Brisbane,
and Captain (afterwards Sir Maurice) O’Connell, who
practically occupied a similar position at Gladstone,
although he held the post of Commissioner of Lands
subsequently to the appointment of a police magistrate
at Port Curtis. There w r ere two police magistrates and
twelve clerks of petty sessions, while the duty of making
enquiry into deaths attended by suspicious circum-
stances, now performed by the district police magistrate,
was then in the hands of a coroner. Even in those days
the honorary judiciary seems to have been as valued a
means of social delimitation as it was doubtless an aid
in the dispensation of justice, for there were no fewer
than 150 Justices of the Peace. The apex of the
administration of law was found in the Supreme Court,
the judge of which had under him twelve officials.
Turning to the provision for dealing with Crown lands
and land business generally, we find that the staff com-
prised five commissioners, eight land agents, with seven
surveyors, a clerk, and draughtsman. It is perhaps well
to include in this list two sheep inspectors, who probably
worked under the Lands Administration, as there was
not then a Department of Agriculture and Stock. Two
officers performed the duties pertaining to public works,
while the Steam Navigation Board had a staff of six,
and immigration business was dealt with by a board
of three officials. The Customs staff, always a test of
marine trade, was represented by a sub-collector and
four officers. Again the modest scale on which postal
business was carried out lifts the curtain on the day of
small things. The staff comprised four departmental
officers, twelve postmasters, and two letter-carriers. It
is calculated that the Police Force at that time did not
exceed thirty members, including eleven chief constables.
At the gaol there were twelve officials in all, and of these
seven were warders. Two chaplains were also among the
staff. A very important factor in maintaining law and
order was the Black Police, the chief officer being
commandant and having a secretary with him. Local
sections of the corps were in charge of subaltern officers,
as follows: Moreton Bay, a second-lieutenant; Port
Curtis and Leichhardt, a first-lieutenant and six second-
lieutenants ; Wide Bay and Burnett, a first- and second-
lieutenant; Maranoa and Oondamine, a first- and two
second-lieutenants. The cost of administration in the
days preceding the proclamation of the new colony
cannot be deemed excessive, for it is calculated to have
been a trifle under £II,OOO per annum. The needs of
the sick and suffering were ministered to by three or
four medical practitioners in Brisbane. There were two
in Ipswich, while two or three were in practice west of
the Main Range, and one resided at Maryborough.
There were but two hospitals, one in Brisbane and the
other at Maryborough. The average number of patients
in the former institution was twenty-four and in the
latter four. An indication of the robust physique of the
early settlers, as well as the magnificent climatic con-
ditions of the territory, is to be found in the fact that
treatment in hospital was in the main due to accidents.
The hospitals, then as now, were maintained by
voluntary donations and Government grants. It is
interesting in looking back to find the beginning of
Queensland’s share in the Australian Imperial Forces, for
a Mounted Volunteer Corps was in existence, and gave
outlet to the martial ardour of otherwise peace-loving
citizens. Things literary outside of Brisbane found
stimulus in schools of arts at Ipswich and Toowoomba
respectively, but truth to say, the work-a-day life of
what was practically a pioneering community left but
little time to be devoted to books. As dis-
tributing centres the importance of Brisbane, for long
linked in this regard with Ipswich, as was Maryborough
with Gladstone, to the districts in the interior, can
hardly be grasped by those whose thought-pictures of


communication include ramifying railway lines in every
direction. The true circumstances may be brought
home to those who have traced the old coach road down
the Range at Toowoomba, and who strive to picture it
as it was then, a track, the use of which was at the
ordering of the elements. For months, it is said, teams
outward bound across the Downs, or coastward to
Ipswich, were delayed by rains. In truth, the journey
to Toowoomba or Drayton must always have been
problematical, added to which the blacks, as is evidenced
by the strength of the Native Police Corps, must have
added an element of danger. The carrier with his
bullock dray does not figure prominently in the romance
of those days, but that is because history so often does
also for residences for the clergymen officiating, the
grant in each case being equal to the sum contributed
by the members of the denomination, and in like manner
grants towards the stipend of the ministers up to £2OO
per annum were made on a similar basis of subscription
by the congregation, while if £SOO were subscribed the
Government made an annual grant of £3OO. There is
a breadth of view in the position taken up that makes
us wonder if in such matters we have made progress. In
all there were sixteen clergymen officiating, while the
churches numbered eighteen. As in later days, when
no church building was available, there was recourse to
the court-house or the school. The denominations
represented at that time were as follows (in alphabetical

injustice. In truth, however, his must have been a life
full of adventure. What he did, he and his mates,
may be seen as we look around us. The carrier in the
days of which we speak was a veritable stalwart.
Public worship when separation came was linked
with the State, just as hospitals are now, that is, the
churches could take advantage of what was termed the
“General Churches Act” of New South Wales, intro-
duced through the influence of Sir Richard Bourke,
Governor of the Mother Colony, and which was passed
in 1836-7. Under the provision of the statute contri-
butions from the State could be obtained, up to £I,OOO,
in aid of building edifices devoted to public worship, and
order) : —Baptists, Church of England, Congrega-
tional, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, and
Wesleyan. Turning to the question of education, we
find that the system in use was that adopted in New
South Wales, and controlled by the board of the
colony. The teachers do not seem to have enjoyed large
remunerations, though their salaries were defrayed by
the school fees, assisted by Government grants. The
curriculum was similar to that which pertained in
national schools, and seems indeed to have been miser-
ably inadequate when compared with that of which
the present generation are the beneficiaries. As in our
present State-school system there was provision made


for religious instruction to be given by visiting clergy-
men. That the system did not find any favour, and was
considered to be very ineffective, is proved by the fact
that there were six Church of England schools and four
established by the Roman Catholic Church, together
with no fewer than thirty private schools. Nothing more
condemnatory of the national school system as it then
was could be said. It is worthy of notice, in view of
the change that has taken place in public opinion on
the subject, that in those days denominational schools
were assisted by the Government, the Churches by whom
they were established being left in practically full
control as long as the required standard of education
was maintained.
With the creation of the colony of Queensland there
came the constitution of an Anglican diocese, of which
the Right Rev. E. W. Tuffnell, Prebendary of Salis-
bury, was consecrated bishop. The work of the Church
of England in Moreton Bay may be said to have been
inaugurated in 1842, when the Rev. John Gregor took
up his duties, which must have been very onerous, as
they entailed long and weary journeys through the bush.
In 1846 Mr. Gregor was accidentally drowned, and was
succeeded by the Rev. B. Glennie, subsequently well
known throughout Queensland as Archdeacon Glennie.
Mr. Glennie left Brisbane some four years later, taking
up church work in the Darling Downs. At the time of
separation the Rev. John Moseley was in charge of the
Brisbane district, his duties including services in
Fortitude Valley and South Brisbane. The Rev. L. H.
Rumsey was rector of St. Paul’s Church, Ipswich, and
the neighbouring districts, while to Mr. Glennie was
allotted a huge parish, comprising all the Darling
Downs, and including Drayton and Toowoomba, Dalby,
Deyburn, and Warwick, an area of some 8,000 square
miles. Those who remember Archdeacon Glennie, as
he moved about, a venerable figure, will find it almost
difficult to realize the unceasing labours which he per-
formed so well in the early days, when he was not only
priest, but librarian, or rather, bringer of books, for
the widely-scattered and lonely residents of the district.
His self-denying service deserves the kindliest and the
most cordial recognition. The Glennie Memorial
School in Toowoomba keeps green the memory of the
aged clergyman. Another Anglican priest, the Rev. R.
Creyke, somewhat delicate in health, did occasional
clerical work. The Queensland diocese comprised all
the bishopric of Newcastle within the boundary of the
colony, for the Newcastle see had for its bound on the
north the 21st degree of latitude, while it was limited
on the west by the 141st degree of longitude. All the
country to the north and north-west, not included in
the original demarcations, by a strange anomaly came
under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Sydney. Thus
did it come about in the ecclesiastical sphere, what the
people of the south ardently desired to see accomplished
in the political region, when they realized that separa-
tion could not be withstood, for it will be remembered
that had it not been for firm action on the part of the
British Government in carrying the boundaries of
Queensland up to the northern seaboard, a strong effort
would have been made to institute a settlement of New
South Wales north of the new colony. The wrong
action was safeguarded in the one case, but not in the
other. At the time of separation the Roman Catholic
Church also took action, and a see was constituted, the
Rev. James O’Quinn being consecrated bishop. The
clergymen of the Roman Communion at the founding
of the new colony comprised two, the Very Rev. Dean
Rigney, resident in Brisbane, and the Rev. Father
McGindy, who had for his parish Ipswich and country
to the westward. In the Presbyterian Church there was
felt the effect of ecclesiastical polity which had aroused
so much controversy in Scotland at what was termed
the Disruption, and which resulted in a large number
of the ministers of the Established Church leaving that
body and constituting the Free Church, of Scotland. In
Australia, where one would imagine there should be
no room for Old Country disputes, the rift made itself
felt for a time, until the absurdity of the attitude
became apparent to the Scotch Presbyterians; for at
the time of which we write there were no fewer than three
synods: that of Australia, linked with the Church of
Scotland (the Established Church) ; while another was
termed the Synod of Eastern Australia, affiliated with
the Free Church of Scotland; and yet a third owed its
existence to the irrepressible Dr. Lang, who obviously
could not have approved of either of the other sections.
Dr. Lang’s followers in the ecclesiastical sphere assumed
the name of the Synod of New South AVales. The dis-
turbing elements, however, do not seem to have seriously
affected Presbyterian Church life in the early days of
Queensland. The Rev. AV. L. Nelson, D.D., at the
time of separation was minister of St. Stephen’s Church,
Ipswich; he subsequently held charge of the church in
Toowoomba. His figure, as one of the church fathers
of settlement in the colony, was familiar to much later
generations, for he officiated in a Toowoomba church in
the eighties. Dr. Nelson, it may be noted, was the
father of Sir Hugh Nelson, subsequently Premier
of Queensland. The Free Church Synod of Eastern
Australia found representation in the Rev. C. Ogg, for
long a respected minister in Brisbane, and whose church
in Ann Street links up the past and the present. The
Synod offspring of Dr. Lang’s views on ecclesiastical
polity seems to have lived more from the energy of its
founder than from any vigour in its own life, although
the Synod of New South AVales had in 1859 two
ministers at work in the northern settlement, Mr. J.
Kingsford at AVarwick, and Mr. AVagner, who travelled

from point to point as the needs of the people seemed
to require. The Wesleyan Church was sti'ong, and was
destined to become stronger, as four years previously (in
1855) there had been a linking up of the churches in
Australia, New Zealand, and the South Seas, in a
Conference associated with that of the homeland. There
were in 1859 three ministers officiating in Wesleyan
Churches in the north—the Rev. F. Wilkinson (Bris-
bane), the Rev. W. Curnow (at Ipswich), and the Rev.
W. Fallon (at Warwick). The Baptist Church had a
representative in the Rev. D. G. Wilson, who minis-
tered to a congregation in a church in Wharf Street.
The Rev. George Wight (at Brisbane) and the Rev.
J. J. Warracker (at Ipswich) did good service in paving
excellent in comparison with rates ruling elsewhere,
and living was cheap, marvellously cheap in all the
essentials. Under the circumstances things made for
contentment and, it may be added, an almost uncon-
scious advancement towards settlement and prosperity,
among all who took thought for the future. Away in
the outposts of the pastoral industry there were
adventures and dangers sufficient to satisfy the most
reckless, but the pioneers found prizes as the reward of
their venturing into the unknown, and daring spirits
to continue the work were never wanting. The vast
spaces and scanty population bred kindly feeling

the way for the extension of the Congregational Church,
and with reference to them this briefest of outlines of
the church life as it was at separation must conclude.
The country had come of age, and the irresponsible
days of national childhood had passed, never to return.
We can see from the records that many things which
we of these days consider indispensable must have
been lacking. However, if there were no social excite-
ments, then as a counterpoise there seemed to
have been but few pitfalls, and such as did exist
were not camouflaged—all could see them and avoid
them, if they would. Money was easily acquired, for

the rising values in station property. Wages were

grand type of man, narrow-minded, perhaps, where his
own interests were concerned, but filled with fine ideals
of beauty as simple as they were excellent. And it was
the country that affected the town, for the bushman
when he came in brought with him the air of a free
world that must have swept aside the growing artifici-
alities of urban life. Nowadays the town sets the pace
to the country, but it was the other way about in the
good old days. Kindliness, happiness, hospitality,
generosity—such were the gifts of the bush to the
pioneers, and those are just the factors in the life of
the young colony on which one loves to dwell.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE SHIP OF STATE IN COMMISSION.
With the coming of Sir George Bowen, the
Governor of Queensland, who arrived in Brisbane on
December 10, 1859, the constitutional ship of State was
put into commission. The rejoicings on the occasion
were worthy of the great event, and as in all momentous
events, littleness and personal aims were for the time
submerged beneath the consciousness that a new colony
in the Empire had come of age, and was recognized as
capable of ordering its own affairs and guarding its
destiny to a future of prosperity.
One of the first acts of the new Governor was to
direct the attention of the Executive Council to the
necessity for organizing the administration of public
offices, and His Excellency to that end framed a minute
in relation to "Her Majesty’s Civil Service in the Colony
of Queensland.” It was a time when thought and
public opinion had begun to see clearly that the evils
of patronage must pass away, and that systematic efforts
should be made to secure the best service for the public,
who paid for that service. The days of competitive
examinations had come, and the age had passed when
political services or influence, either in the House of
Peers or the House of Commons, were deemed a suffi-
cient reason for placing relatives or friends in positions
of trust, irrespective of mental qualifications or special
endowments for a post under the Government. As it
was in Great Britain so was it in Queensland, and Sir
George Bowen was in touch with the times when he
suggested that appointments for third-class clerkships
in the Civil Service should be obtained by competition
in examination, and that a board to control the work
and draw up a syllabus of subjects should be constituted.
The proposal extended to all the departments of the
Service, and advised that the following system should
be adopted : —Chief clerks, >£4oo, increasing by a yearly
sum of £2O to £SOO per annum; first-class clerks, £3OO,
with yearly increases of £2O until a maximum of £4OO
was obtained; second-class clerk, £2OO, with a yearly
increase of £2O, the maximum being £3OO per annum :
third-class clerks, £IOO, with annual increases of £lO
until the class maximum of £2OO per annum was
attained. The vice-regal minute also sought to provide for
superannuation allowances and classification following on
a favourable report from the chief of the department
in each instance. The minute was approved by the
Executive, and action taken to give effect to it. The
result was excellent, demonstrating that the board of
examiners must have done the work admirably and
in the best interests of the public.
The arrival of the Governor implied the departure
of the Resident of Brisbane, Captain Wickham, R.N.
In administration the greater does not always find room
for the lesser. It is gratifying to know that the services
of Captain Wickham during a long term of years were
recognized, for it is on record that on January 30, 1860,
a deputation of representative citizens waited on the
departing Resident and presented him with an address,
signed by 120 residents of Brisbane. The deputation
comprised Messrs. G. Raff, R. R. MacKenzie, R. Little,
J. Gibbon, W. Brooks, S. Smith, R. Cribb, and J. F.
Macdonald. The address, which voiced regret at the
departure of Captain Wickham, Mrs. Wickham, and
their family, with wishes for their future happiness, and
hope that they might return to the colony, also referred
to the difficulty that had hedged the administration of
the Resident’s duties, in the necessity for carrying out
the wishes as to economy of the Government of New
South Wales, and at the same time studying the desires
of the people of Moreton Bay. That the office held was
no sinecure may be realized by the reply of Captain
Wickham. In expressing his thanks for the recognition
of his services, the recipient of the address said,
“The difficulties which perpetually attended the advance-
ment of these districts whilst forming a portion of New
South Wales, and which, though a constant regret to
me, were beyond my control, are now happily removed.”
Captain Wickham, whom urgent private business called
to England, did not return to the colony, as his many
friends desired and he himself appeared to wish. The
old order had passed away, and the departure of the
Resident at Moreton Bay was the cutting of the painter
attaching Queensland to the old days.
Meanwhile Sir William Denison, the Governor of
New South Wales, had been carrying out the work
placed in his hands in providing for the constitution of
a Legislative Assembly for Queensland. It is not too
much to say that in that duty he aroused as virulent
criticism as was launched at his head in the matter of
fixing the southern boundary of the new colony, in
regard to which Dr. Lang, with extreme plain speech,
subsequently said, “Sir William Denison, the late
Governor-General of New South Wales, who having two
brothers holding nearly a quarter of a million acres of
land as squatters on the northern boundary of that
colony, at the merely nominal rental of a twentieth of
a penny per acre, could scarcely be supposed to be a
disinterested referee in such a case, fixed the boundary
for the present, when the question was, very improperly,
I conceive, referred to him for his decision, by Mr,
Labouchere, late Secretary of State for the Colonies,
at the twenty-eighth parallel on the coast and the twenty-
ninth in the interior.” We have shown that in elections


under the regime of the Mother Colony no interest to
any practical extent had been taken, but the object-
view was quite changed when self-government was
granted. Undoubtedly the rancour of disappointment
could be justifiably accused of influencing Sir William
Denison and those who followed his advice in refusing
manhood suffrage to the new colony. For, as was
pointed out, there was not a shred of defence for the
action in harking back to the Constitution Act of New
South Wales for a model of the franchise under which
the elections were to take place, as the Electoral Act
passed in New South Wales in 1858 was manifestly in
operation when the new colony was proclaimed, and
known in Britain to be in operation. Apparently sub-
surface motives held sway
in adopting a system of
suffrage very much more
restricted than was in use
in New South Wales, and
influences were at work in
taking advantage of “a
legal tortuosity,” as it was
termed, and which it is
stated “could only have
been suggested by a spirit
inimical to the interests of
the infant State.” Assur-
edly there is good ground
for the allegation that
self-seeking on the part
of that portion of the
community in New South
Wales interested commerci-
ally in Queensland, aided,
perchance, by those in the
new colony bound by busi-
ness ties with Sydney, was
reponsible, both for the
definition of the boundary
which aroused Dr. Lang’s
diatribe and also the
restriction of the franchise privileges. The political
mole as an agent was not unknown in the Con-
servative camp. Those whose memories go back
to a decade after separation are aware that to many
of the older settlers then it seemed almost a matter
of regret that Brisbane had supplanted Sydney as a
centre of social life, for to the city in the south their
thoughts, and indeed their footsteps, often gravitated.
Probably much of all this was sentiment, and it may
be that the matter of Government autonomy found
firm support from those of whom we speak. But
despite of that, sentiment is a straw that shows
plainly how the wind blows. For many years after
separation became un fait accompli, the headquarters of
e 2
the pastora] industry in Queensland were undoubtedly
at Sydney rather than Brisbane.
On April 4 the writs for the general election were
issued, and thereafter came the nomination of candi-
idates. The elections were completed on May 7, and
thus the Legislative Assembly of Queensland took form.

The addresses of the various candidates are of great
value, and perhaps their chief interest lies in the fact
that in the trend of politics as it was then we find the
HON. T. B. STEPHENS.


nucleus not only of subsequent action many years later,
but more than that, we meet in many cases prudent
efforts to generalize on matters of moment and to cloak
partisanship under a wide philanthropy. Party politics
then differed but little from the views held now, save in
one respect. There was at that time no champion of
Labour, although the advent of the party was predicted
in the Press. And the democracy of those days was far
different from that of our own time; where it appeared
it emerged as peaks jutting out from the ocean of the
commonplace. The tide of Conservatism had not ebbed far
enough to show the common basis of democratic thought.
Mr. T. L. Murray-Prior, candidate for East Moreton,
said he felt it was the duty of men of independent means
to sacrifice their leisure for the common good. There is
a lofty note struck there, but to most of us in these
days it sounds false, perhaps because as the world grows
older it becomes more cynical. And the candidate
proceeded to define his sacrifice by stating that he
favoured land legislation safeguarding the interests of
the true squatters, who were the first occupants of the
ground, and to whom justice should be done. Land
laws should be sufficiently liberal to induce immigation,
through the leasing of Crown land for agricultural
purposes, with pre-emptive purchase rights. Turning to
another candidate, Mr. Henry Jordan, who was chosen
for parliamentary honours, though Mr. Murray-Prior
was not, we find that he desired the reservation of a
mile on either side of the branch railway to be dedicated
for the purpose of agricultural settlement. And again
Mr. Jordan urged that land on the Darling Downs
should be thrown open to agricultural selection in farms,
varying in size from 40 acres to 320 acres, at ss. per
acre, conditionally on improvements being effected.
One of the candidates, Mr. W. F. Kennedy, who did
not secure a seat in Parliament, seemed to have had
very practical ideas in regard to land settlement, for
he urged that the best agricultural land near towns
should be reserved in blocks of 30,000 acres for selec-
tion in farms varying in size from 30 to 500 acres. The
tone of public opinion in regard to agricultural farming
as opposed to squatting interests solely may be gauged
by the fact that in no instance did the candidates, where
their views are on record, oppose selection, although
many do not appear to have realized the importance of
the question or the need for providing for the future,
as did Mr. Jordan and Mr. Kennedy. Again the rela-
tion of immigration and land settlement one to the
other, or the linking of railways to both, does not seem
to have been clear to many of those who from their
candidature aspired to guide political thought. On the
subject of railway construction there was indeed an
extraordinary divergence of thought, some of the candi-
dates having difficulty in realizing the importance of
the iron trail. Others again were seized by the need
for constructing railways or tram lines ‘‘into the
interior,” as the generally ran in those days,
while there was anything but unanimity as to the
system to be adopted. For not a few the land grant
system offered many advantages, and in view of the
State ownership of railways, which was subsequently
accepted without demur, it is extraordinary to see that
the Old Country system of running railways by the
enterprise of private companies found warm advocates.
Again, the land grant system of railway extension,
which the electors of Queensland definitely and unmis-
takably condemned in later years, was proposed as being
far more preferable than the securing of capital through
public loans for railway building. Nothing perhaps
more than this shows that political thought may remain
in a state of flux for long until the coming of the
element which gives it stability, for Mr. C. Lilley, who
successfully won the favour of the electors of Fortitude
Valley, and who certainly believed that he was a
Liberal, urged that system of railway construction.
Again, there were others who asserted that it was not
the province of the State to incur debt for the purpose
of railway construction.
On the question of education there was also a
marked divergence of opinion, for to some the national
system was not the best, while others favoured a limited
denominationalism in regard to schools. And yet
others considered that both systems should be set aside
in favour of a new nationalism, which can hardly be
criticized, as it was not defined. Here, perchance, we
have the first wave of the advancing tide which has
secured for us a scholastic system of which we have no
reason to feel ashamed. That this was indeed so is
proved by the fact that some of the candidates were
able to see that the duty of a State is to educate all
her children. As it was with scholastic affairs, so the
political addresses of accepted and rejected alike, show
that there were strong opposing views in regard to
State aid to Churches. Some candidates considered
that religious denominations should receive State aid
on the basis of their numerical strength, while others
asserted that the support of his Church was a duty
private to the citizen and with which the Government
had nothing to do. Yet others assented to the latter
view in regard to districts where settlement was close,
as in towns, but pleaded for the widely-scattered popula-
tion of the pastoral country and the need for affording
that benefit in religious ministrations, which the people
could not obtain for themselves.
One point which has formed so noteworthy a feature
in the political programmes of later generations was in
verity a negligible quantity in 1860, for of all the
candidates only one, Mr. Arnold Wienholt, of Maryvale,
who had aspirations concerning the Warwick seat,
referred to local requirements. Certainly Mr. Wienholt


struck an original line of thought when he included it)
his address the necessity of securing a road through
Cunningham Gap, and also the need for a bridge across
the Condamine. We have said that the addresses of
candidates proved that company control in railway
construction found favour, but it remained for Mr.
Kent, who sought the suffrages of the electors of West
Moreton, to propose that to companies should be
relegated the duty—to be paid for the grants of land
—of erecting public buildings, constructing roads and
bridges, together with other public works.
On yet another point it is instructive that away
back in the early sixties politicians had ideas concerning
what Anthony Trollope liked to term “ the system of
King, Lords, and Com-
mons,” adopted in the
colonies, and we find Mr.
Edmonstone, who became
a member of Parliament,
advocating the introduction
of the elective principle in
regard to the Upper House
as a preparatory step to
abolishing it altogether.
Mr. Forbes, who was elected
one of the members for
Ipswich, however, went a
stage further, for he boldly
asserted that the Legis-
lative Council should be
dispensed with on the
ground of economy. More
than one candidate laid
emphasis on the necessity
that existed for making
the Upper House elective.
For the most part there
was an agreement in re-
gard to the need for har-
bour improvements, while
the disagreement in regard
both to State aid to Churches and the system of educa-
tion which should be adopted was very marked. It is
also noticeable that the term “national” in regard to
education was very indefinite to some of the candidates,
who wished to supersede it by another form of national
teaching, which was not more clearly specified, but
probably implied a school curriculum for all, very
similar to that now known as State education. It is
noteworthy that among those with advanced ideas as
to education for all classes was Mr. R. G. W. Herbert,
who became member for Leichhardt, and subsequently
was very widely known as a leading authority on colonial
affairs when he became Sir Robert Herbert, Under-
secretary for the Colonies. Mr. Herbert favoured free
grammar schools. Pie was the Colonial Secretary in the
first Parliament.
It is significant that in two instances there were
signs that on the question of Brisbane being the capital
candidates had not made final decision, and that in
turn teaches us that opinion among the electors they
addressed had not finally crystallized to the form it
ultimately assumed. Mr. Herbert safeguarded his
standpoint in regard to metropolitan honours by
asserting that final decision on the subject should
depend on future trade developments, while pointing
out that Brisbane was in a sense in possession. Mr.
Gilbert Elliott, who was elected for Wide Bay, did not
exhibit so much caution in expressing his views, for he
averred that Brisbane was
not the most suitable site for
the capital. Mr. Herbert’s
thoughts as to land legisla-
tion may be briefly summed
up in his desire that long
terms in leases should be
given to squatters, his belief
being that so the pastoral
lessees would be encouraged
to make improvements. He
was also in favour of period-
ical valuations to adjust the
rents, and further marched
with the times in the sup-
port he gave to “all bona
fide settlement.” The defin-
ition deemed necessary shows
that “dummying” was a
vice not then unknown. Mr.
Herbert took up the position
that State aid to Churches
was advisable.
Some of the candidates
were very plain of speech in
regard to New South Wales
influences, and one who
contested West Moreton referred to the system of land
sales introduced during the regime of Sir George Gipps
as “a petty chandler’s shop practice,” which had
impeded settlement “in the attempt to concentrate
population." Mr. N. Bartley, for many years a well-
known figure in Brisbane, and who contributed to the
literary memories of the country, was not successful
in his candidature for the Western Downs, but he
certainly touched a question which called for reform
urgently when he drew attenion to the loss the territory
sustained in granting free passages to emigrants who
used shipment to Moreton Bay as a means of reaching
Sydney. Very necessary legislation to prevent a
glaringly dishonest practice was subsequently passed.
HON. R. G. W. HERBERT.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


The political line of thought taken by Mr. George
Raff, one of the representatives in Parliament, elected
for North Brisbane, is of interest. Mr. Raff approved
of neither national education as it then was, nor of a
denominational system, but of something wider than
both. He opposed in his address State aid to the
Churches. He supported the restoration of their elec-
toral privileges to the many persons who had been
disfranchised by the system of suffrage adopted, and
approved of the vote by ballot. He expressed himself
in opposition to railway construction by means of State
loans, and he did not favour the locking up of land
barring settlement. He urged the fostering of the pastoral
industry, the construction of roads into the interior, and
that improvements should be carried out at the port of
Brisbane. With the exception of his views in regard
to railway construction, which neither experience nor
time have verified, Mr. Raff’s standpoint may be con-
sidered at once shrewd and cautious, the outlook of a
practical man of affairs. The political creed of one of
his colleagues in the Brisbane constituency may be dealt
with here. Mr. Henry Jordan, while as shrewd as Mr.
Raff in his outlook on the political world, took his
fellows more into his confidence, and thus perhaps laid
himself open in a greater degree to criticism. No
opinion, however, could be more sound than Mr.
Jordan’s statement that immigration was necessary if
settlement were to expand. He did not approve of
deferred payment in regard to land, considering that
thereby a host of debtors to the Government would arise.
The alienations of jrastoral land did not find favour with
him, but he considered a suitable rent should be charged
for the leases. His land policy was the reverse of vague,
for he considered that unsettled land should be leased
at a merely nominal rent, and that there should be no
assessment for three years, with valuation at the end
of that term and a reletting. He held that intermediate
land, including all leased for fourteen years, and
termed intermediate, should be let on five-year leases.
In regard to land in the settled areas, he stated that
it should be let, under the system then existing, from
year to year. He supported the national system of
education, but opposed State aid to Churches. He was
not enthusiastic concerning the success that would
attend railway construction, but would support a line
to bring wheat from Warwick and Drayton if it did
not cost more than £6,000 per mile. Mr. Jordan
supported manhood suffrage and the vote by ballot, and
he expressed the opinion that the Clarence and Rich-
mond districts should have been included in the colony
of Queensland. He opposed the introduction of coolies,
but favoured a land-grant system of immigration. Such
were the views of a man who exerted very considerable
influence on the development of the country.
Yet another man of the time whom his fellows sent
to represent them in Parliament was Mr. Charles Lilley,
who certainly looked far but hardly in the direction
which was subsequently taken by the colony. For the
representative of Fortitude Valley, who afterwards
"took ermine" and became Sir Charles Lilley when
Chief Justice of Queensland, favoured the imposition
of direct law to check monopoly, and he was of the
belief that so free trade could gradually and naturally
be introduced as indirect taxation through the Customs
became unnecessary. It is also of considerable interest
to know that Mr. Lilley believed that those who sent
members to Parliament should be able to withdraw from
Parliament those who became ineffective. Mr. Lilley
evidently did not believe in the compelling influence of
self-respect moving a Member of Parliament to resign
his seat when his services ceased to satisfy his
constituents. It is perhaps noteworthy at the present
juncture to recall the fact that Mr. Lilley was strong
in the conviction that a Government should not embark
on commercial enterprises.
Mr. R. R. Mackenzie, candidate for the Burnett,
and who was elected, was not so outspoken in his views
as were some of his fellow-members, and thus it is of
interest to know from his political address that he
opposed free selection in an extended form. Probably
it was that principle which recommended him for
election, combined with his expressed desire that there
should be a liberal adjustment of the land laws, which
phrase, however, conveys little meaning. Those who
supported Mr. Mackenzie had, no doubt, the key to
the riddle. There was nothing of the sphinx about Mr.
Mackenzie’s views on railway construction. He opposed
a national debt and railways built by the Government.
How strange do many of the principles avowed by the
parliamentary candidates seem to us in these days. And
it is somewhat difficult to see how the visions of some
of the candidates could have materialized, for their
proposals are at times mutually destructive. Thus Mr.
R. Strathdee, who canvassed the Burnett, had as two
of his aspirations the encouragement of the squatter
and the attraction of a large population to Queensland.
It will be seen that if Conservatism was a strong
factor in the political opinions of candidates, successful
and unsuccessful, it did not obtrude, and no stronger
evidence of the growing power of democracy could be
afforded, for consciously or unconsciously, aspirants for
Parliamentary honours in their addresses to electors
give the key to what they themselves believe to be the
trend of political opinion at the time. No candidate,
unless he be imprudent and unwise to a degree incon-
ceivable in a practical man, whose object is to win the
support of his fellows, would avow himself to be ruled
by principles of action repugnant to the electors or that


portion of them he seeks to lead. And if we acknowledge
that this view is correct, we must see that democracy,
if not approved by all, was so far realized to be a power
as to compel respect. Another feature of the elections is
to be found in the fact that the most advanced, the
most radical section as it was termed in later days, did
not win the goal for which it aimed. Success for the
most part attended those who were content to pursue
the happy mean, making themselves conspicuous neither
by championing the cause of the pastoralists nor by
venturing into the depths of very advanced democracy.
Even in regard to so important a point as railway
construction there was as yet nothing definite attained
as to the course to be pur-
sued, although it certainly
affords food for thought,
and perchance a sardonic
smile, as we realize that the
system of company-owned
railway lines was not the
principle which was ulti-
mately adopted. The differ-
ences in regard to the rela-
tion of the State to
Churches on the one hand,
or education on the other,
have vanished, and if there
be a wish to return to the
discarded system in the
scholastic sphere, it is so
greatly overweighted by
popular opinion that even
for its supporters it must
mean hoping against hope.
In regard to the Churches
and their relation to the
State, the movement against
aid of any description has
been so marked in the wider
sphere of the Homeland,
as well as in Australia,
that it is obvious that the
question has practically passed out of politics. It is
thus a matter of deep interest to realize that it had
not done so in 1860, but on the contrary, was a very
vital question.
Another point that strikes the observer is the lack
of focus in regard to immigration. The bickerings
during the previous decade or more practically centred
in the question of the need for labour and the very
insufficient supply that was available, and yet in the
addresses of those who aspired to enter Parliament the
subject of immigration was not the burning question
we should have imagined it would be, remembering, as
nil readers of past controversies must realize, that want
of labour and dearth of population were the grounds
upon which the supporters of quasi-convict settlers could
advance their desires. In the main the references to
immigration were for the most part generalities. The
subject was not handled in detail, as was that of land
legislation, and as we imagine it ought to have been
dealt with, for population and the best system for the
advancement of the country under which immigrants
could be introduced were obviously the chief needs of
the time.
It will be noticed that among the names of those
elected for West Moreton appears the name of Dr. W. L.
Nelson, who well may be termed one of the fathers of
the Presbyterian Church
in Queensland. It is
worthy, perhaps, of more
than passing attention to
note that, like his minis-
terial colleague in Sydney,
Dr. Lang, Dr. Nelson
should have ventured into
the political arena. There
are those for whom the
adoption of any duties save
those of the Church seem
unfitting for a clergyman.
Be that as it may, the
question was raised in the
case of Dr. Nelson, who
answered the charge that
his sacred calling disquali-
fied him from sitting in
Parliament by announcing
that he had resigned his
pastorate.
We have given the
personnel of the Legisla-
tive Council, as far as the
Governor of New South
Wales was empowered to
take action. It will be
remembered, however, that
while Sir Wiliam Denison’s duties ceased with
the first appointments to the new Upper House,
those of Her Majesty’s representative in Queensland
began when he assumed office in the colony. It was thus
within the province of Sir George Bowen to appoint not
fewer than five Legislative Councillors, and the duty was
fulfilled by the calling of the following citizens to the
Upper House: Stephen Simpson, of Wolston; Henry
Bates Fitz, of Pilton; George Harris, of Brisbane;
Daniel Foley Roberts, of Shafston. The lion. Maurice
Charles O’Connell, formerly Government Resident at
Port Curtis, was appointed a member of the Executive
Council.
SIR FRANCIS FORBES.


In pursuance of a proclamation issued by the
Governor, Parliament assembled at the Court House
Buildings, Queen Street, Brisbane, on May 22, 1860,
being opened by the Commissioners, who were Messrs.
Herbert, Mackenzie, and Pring. Sir Charles Nicholson,
Bart., was appointed the President of the Legislative
Council, while Mr. Gilbert Elliott was elected Speaker
of the Legislative Assembly. Both gentlemen had been
members of the Parliament of New South Wales, where
Sir Charles Nicholson had held the high office of Speaker.
To Mr. L. A. Bernays were given the duties of Clerk
of the Legislative Assembly, and the dignity and
the efficiency with which the work was carried out will
be in the memory of all whose acquaintance with par-
liamentary life dates from a much later period. Mr.
Bernays had also experience of parliamentary work in
the Mother Colony, having occupied a junior position
on the staff of the Legislature. He was created a
Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George
in 1894, a worthy recognition of services to the State
w T ell performed.
On May 29, to which date the two Houses of
Parliament had been adjourned, all the ceremonials in
connection with the presence of the Governor and the
reading of His Excellency's speech were carried out,
and Brisbane as was due kept high holiday. After many
disappointments the citizens of the capital realized that
the goal for which there had been much striving was
at length attained, and though some objected to the
pomp and pageantry of the vice-regal escort, there can
be no doubt that the imposing ceremonials brought home
to many in a way nothing else could have done that the
old days of government from Sydney were gone for ever.
His Excellency’s address differed little from many
a speech subsequently delivered by the Representative
of the Throne, save that it dealt at length with
the happy circumstances under which Governor and
Members of Parliament had met for the first time. A
reason for the delay in summoning Parliament was
found in necessary attention to the electoral rolls. The
inconveniences of the quorum in a House of twenty-six
members being fixed at twenty was recognized by the
intimation that legislation to amend the Constitution
Act would be introduced, and thereafter there was deft
reference to the question on which so much divergence
of opinion existed —State aid to Churches; members
being requested—how far successfully we know not —
not to deal with the subject by alluding to abstract
theories, but by a careful consideration of the peculiar
circumstances and wants of the country. Prominence
was given to the subject of primary education, and also
the institution of the grammar-school system. The
allotment of financial liabilities between the new colony
and New South Wales was referred to, as was also
communication between Brisbane and the other capital
cities of Australia, and there was a foreshadowing of
practical steps to link the colony by means of a cable
with Singapore. A steamship line to foster trade with
the Indies and China via Torres Straits was mentioned.
Land legislation with a view to promoting settlement
was promised, as was a liberal immigration policy. And
the speech was not lacking in care for the inland port,
for attention, it was stated, would be paid to the
removal of the obstructions to navigation as far as-
Ipswich.
After due debate the Address-in-Reply was adopted.
Further additions were made in regard to official
appointments in the two chambers, Mr. D. F. Roberts
becoming Chairman of Committees in the Upper House,
while Mr. A. Macalister was elected to a similar position
in the Legislative Assembly. It was decided that the
Council should meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and
Thursdays at 4.30 p.m., while the Assembly should sit
on the same days, with the addition of Fridays, when
legislative business began at 10 a.m., continuing until
3 p.m. There is in this attention to the week-end
relaxation from business more than a hint of the influ-
ence wielded—though unacknowledged —of the Ipswich
political coterie. It is of moment to recall that in those
days there were members eager to assert their right to
diverge from accustomed paths, for that perhaps is the
best motive to attribute to Mr. C. Lilley and Mr. P.
O’Sullivan in finding themselves in a minority of two
when voting against the reading of prayers in the
House. One of Mr. Lilley’s arguments that the system
would be unjust to a Chinese, were a native of the
Celestial Empire to find himself a member of the
Chamber has not yet been validated; while Mr. O’Sul-
livan’s inability to recognize that the use of the pronoun
“which” in the Lord’s Prayer was archaic, and thus
not ungrammatical, together with his objection to
prayers in Parliament on the ground that he claimed
the right of praying whenever and wherever he thought
proper, hardly appeals to one as sound reasoning.
Captain O’Connell moved the resolution for the reading
of prayers in the Upper House, while Mr. Jordan per-
formed a similar duty in the Lower House. Early in
the next month (June) Estimates were presented,
probable ways and means totalling £160,000, while the
expenditure was calculated at £149,000. A surplus of
£II,OOO thus gave quite couleur-de-rose tint to the
financial prospects of the Government. It is interesting
to know that among the special appropriations was the
sum of £IO,OOO for a steam dredge. Prospect of a
surplus always suggests to some minds the immediate
necessity for increasing expenditure. Some men base
their personal action on the principle, while others, more
wisely perchance, carry their optimism into public
affairs. Mr. St. George Gore moved that the Governor’s
salary of £2,500 should be augmented by a permanent


annual appropriation of £1,500. It is pleasant to know
that Sir George Bowen had Mr. St. George Gore’s
sympathy, and very truly did the member say of the
Governor, "He should be able to look his butcher and
baker boldly in the face.” Mr. St. George Gore’s
reasoning must have been deemed more weighty then
than it does now, for only Mr. Lilley was found in
opposition to the increase. Mr. Herbert in his speech
on the ministerial policy found in land legislation and
the education question the chief factors of the parlia-
mentary future, although, perchance, the reference to
the administration of justice and the reorganization of
the Supreme Court should find place among matters of
moment to be dealt with. A loyal address to the
Queen “was an appropriately pleasing feature of the
inauguration of constitutional Government in Queens-
land.” The stage was set for the great drama of
national evolution.
CHAPTER XIX.
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DEVELOPMENT.
Despite the clash of party arms, which re-echoes
clearly down the years from those days of small
beginnings, we cannot but acknowledge as we scan the
work accomplished that there was in the community a
region of conscious effort, in which there must have
been a unison of grand accord. So much the results
tell us, and so much must we always remember, when
we are disposed to sit in harsh judgments on the
littleness of personal aims, selfish ambitions, and class
animosities. They were just as we are, the leaders of
political thought, the masters of industry, the seekers
after new fields of conquest away back in the early
sixties, but as we ponder what we are to-day through
them and their labour we may very readily question
whether we, with all the advantages of broader outlook
and a vastly wider knowledge, with immeasurably
better equipment for the task, would have done so well
had we been where they were facing the difficulties which
met them, amid the creaking and the jarring of the new
machinery of self-government. The wonder is, not that
they did so little, but that they did so much and did it so
well. In proof of what we say, one instance in evidence
is to be found in the realization that the transplantation,
without any attempt to acclimatize the constitution-
tree, with its ancient limbs of “lords and commons,” was
out of touch with the times. Thinkers grasp in these
our days that there is something in the system which
requires amending, some are convinced that it is from the
Upper House that the danger threatens, but the old
question arises now, just as it did then, “Is it safe to
top and hew the branch, lest in its fall it injure
irreparably?” In those days of the first Queensland
Parliament the anomalous claim of the nominee Chamber
that it had equal right to be consulted with the elective
House in regard to money credit raised a vast question
for discussion, when it was found that the Constitution
Act gave the Upper House equal powers in regard to
money legislation, save that money bills must originate
in the elective Chamber. It was claimed that the Legis-
lative Council could alter an Appropriation Bill, send
an address to the Governor on a money question, or
receive a message from the Government in regard to
supply. Practice, through the necessity of the case,
had grown up in the Mother Colony, owing to the need
for obtaining money, and the practical problem had
been solved by notes of credit passed by the Assembly
and validated either by an Appropriation Bill or by a
Bill of Indemnity. Here came the opportunity for the
Upper House to assert itself, and it did so, claiming
right equal to that of the Lower House to be consulted
as to credits. The question at issue had its roots far
deeper than the ostensible cause of difference. It was
the age-long conflict of class rule against democracy,
and the very logical point arises: If nomineeism can
control the elective House, is not the power of the
people but the shadow, thrown on the screen of politics,
to divert attention from that which is behind the screen ?
That was the argument then, as it is now, against the
nominee House, and its logical force can hardly be
denied. Neither can it be denied that the remedy was
at hand then had it been taken, but the time was not
ripe, and those in power perchance had no liking for
drastic changes, perchance no liking for the remedy
itself, for Mr. Yaldwyn, in the Legislative Council,
moved resolutions in condemnation of the nominee
system and in advocacy of an elective Upper Chamber,
with periodical retirement and election or re-election,
but with no dissolution, the system to be similar to that
in use in Victoria. The member of the Chamber
criticized did more even than that, for he moved that
a Bill should be prepared and transmitted to the
Legislative Assembly. Here was indeed a mighty factor
in development had it been utilized, but it was not.
A Ministry never is a unity, and that is really why
constitutional Government, in its historical sequence,
is bub a vast procession of Administrations, for the lack
of unity always causes the undoing of a Ministry sooner
or later. Mr. Herbert, like any other shrewd leader,
had measured the strength of his team, and finding it
would not stand the strain of so drastic an ordering of


the political household, and himself averse from any-
thing antagonistic to the system which in the discus-
sion had been styled a “mock House of Lords," allowed
the opportunity for reform to slip. In another direction,
however, the Colonial Secretary was not unmindful of
his powers or reluctant to use them, for he introduced
a Parliamentary Privileges Bill, which caused a fever
of antagonism, as it was pointed out that the pains and
penalties were more severe than in the similar measure
in the House of Commons. A storm of indignation was
aroused, the Press championing the popular rights.
When a Bill can with any show of reason be accused of
invalidating the Bill of Rights and Habeas Corpus Act,
and further of an attempt to coerce the Supreme Court,
we may be sure that Britons will have none of it, and
so we learn that the measure, though it passed, was in
the passing shorn of its obnoxious elements.
The principles confessed by aspirants for parliament-
ary honours demonstrated that opinion was anything
but unified on the subject of education, and the
Education Act, which took form in September, 1860,
bears witness to the divergence of views, for the two
systems adopted faced opposite ways. The object of
the measure was to provide education in a course of
study to which parents, no matter to what religious
denomination they might belong, could take no excep-
tion. The control of educational affairs was vested in
a Board of General Education, composed of five
members, a Minister of the Crown acting as chairman.
The system adopted in the main was the national
educational course as it then was in Ireland. The
duties of the board included the formation, superin-
tendence, and management of primary schools; the
appointment of teachers also rested with the board.
The schools were either vested or non-vested. In
regard to grants for school buildings, etc., the Act
provided that an amount equal to that contributed
locally should be given. The proportion was later
increased to a sum equal to two-thirds of that raised
locally, and subsequently the State aid was placed at
double the amount contributed by the residents of the
locality interested. The teaching staff was paid by the
board, the salaries being supplemented by school fees,
which varied from 6d. to Is. 6d. per week, according
to the grade of the class. Later, in 1870, school fees
were abolished.
Salaries of classified teachers were as follow:
Masters, exclusive of house rent and school fees, from
£2OO a year for A grade in class 1., to £IOO for B grade
in class 111. ; mistresses, exclusive of school fees, but
including house rent, from £l7O for A grade in class I.
to £B9 for B grade in class 111. First-class assistant
teachers were paid —Males, £l5O per annum; females,
£IOO per annum. Second-class assistant teachers
received —Males, £llO per annum; and females, £BO
per annum. Third-class assistant teachers Males, £IOO
per annum; females £6O per annum. The salaries of
unclassified junior assistants were as follows: Males,
£BS per annum; females, £6O per annum. Ihe payment
of pupil teachers was: First year—Males, £3O per
annum; females, £2O per annum. Second year —Males,
£35 per annum; females, £24 per annum. Third year
—Males, £45 per annum; females, £3O per annum.
Fourth year —Males, £6O per annum; females, £4O
per annum.
In compensation for the abolition of school fees,
when that step was taken, an allowance of £1 for each
pupil in average attendance up to 70 was paid. At
schools where the average attendance was between 70
and 140 the head teachers received half of the foregoing
rate, the other half being paid to the next in command.
When the average attendance exceeded 140 the
head master received one-third of the allowance, the
remainder being allotted to the assistant teachers.
Female teachers received two-thirds of the allowance in
question, while teachers of infant schools were paid
one-half. In 1873, owing to the scarcity of applicants
for the position of male pupil teachers, it was found
necessary to raise the payment to £4O per annum for
the first year, the increases per annum being £5, £lO,
and £ls respectively. There being no difficulty in
obtaining female pupil teachers, no increases were given.
Evidently the authorities administered their duties in
obedience to the business principle of supply and
demand. Those were not the days of association for
mutual protection. Another point on which one would
seek enlightenment is the relation of values between the
work of male and female teachers. If there is not a
marked difference between the value of work done in
the one case as compared with the other, why should
there be so marked a difference in the remuneration ?
The other system of instruction, styled non-vested,
had relation to schools at that time under the care of
the Anglican or Roman Catholic Churches, who respec-
tively provided the necessary buildings and appointed
teachers. It was set forth in the Act that the curriculum
should be similar to that in use in the vested schools,
but beyond that the non-vested or denominational
system provided for religious instruction to be given
either by the teaching staff or a minister of religion.
And it was further specified that the teaching must be
imparted in non-scholastic hours, either before the
time when school work commenced or after it had
terminated for the day. Those stipulations being
complied with, the board became responsible for the
salaries of the teachers in non-vested schools, and also
supplied books. The board, it may be stated, retained
the power of veto in regard to the appointment of
teachers, and non-vested schools were under the same
system of inspection as vested institutions. It was


further provided that in the denominational schools
the attendance of pupils must be thirty in order to
qualify for Government aid. The non-vested system
continued until the year 1880.
In 1860 there were four national schools in the
new colony, with an aggregate attendance of 493
scholars and ten teachers, under the supervision of the
board. In 1875, when the system was superseded by the
State Education Act, there were 230 schools, with
an aggregate attendance of 33,643 pupils, while the
teaching staff numbered 595, the expenditure totalling
£83,219 per annum.
The wishes of the community, as well as the
necessities of the case, moved the Government to devote
granted for recreation purposes to grammar schools.
The affairs of the institution, it was specified, should be
administered by trustees, four of whom, it was provided,
should be appointed by the Government and three
elected by the subscribers.
It is of moment to remember that Ipswich was in
the forefront in regard to grammar-school education,
giving an example that has been well followed, for in
truth the higher education of the State, hampered as
it was for long by the neglect to place the apex to the
system —a University, is worthy of the pride it arouses
in the minds of all who know its results. A healthy
rivalry has been established among the chief districts
of the State, and those who are keenest in criticism

special attention to provision for grammar or high
schools, and the question was referred to in the oratorical
heralding of legislative business. Place for the advanced
system was found in the Education Act, where it was
provided that when £I,OOO for a grammar school was
subscribed locally the State would give an amount not
exceeding twice that sum, to be devoted to the erection
of a school building and teacher’s residence. A further
condition was the guarantee by approved citizens that
the fees would not fall below a sum of £SOO per annum
during the first three years of a school’s institution. In
1864 the Education Act was amended so as to provide
that areas of land not exceeding £2,000 in value be
against the alleged confining of the benefits of grammar
schools to a class will be the first to acknowledge that
no matter what name such institutions bear, no matter
under whose administration good work is done, there
can be no gap in the path of the clever child onward
bound to the University. A plain road all can see, and
all mentally eligible can travel, must exist from the
infants’ class in the primary school to the lecture-rooms
of the University. But in truth, whatever were the
circumstances attendant on grammar schools in the
sixties, and we take it that they did not differ from
the spirit of the age, there can be no objection to
grammar-school education as it is in the essentials. The


critic of Conservatism and class partisanship in the
mid-Victorian era, as we had it in Queensland, will
find room for thought in the provision of the Education
Act of 1860 for examinations at primary schools for
education at grammar schools.
One of the most important measures passed in the
first session of Parliament was the Alienation of Crown
Lands Act, which became law on September 17, 1860.
The days of free selection, according to the outward
reading of the Act, had come. The measure provided
for the acquiring of farms at a minimum price of £1
per acre, and in areas varying from 40 acres to 320
acres. The selections were to be acquired after survey,
and were to be sold by public auction after due notifica-
tion in the “Government Gazette.” The principle of
ready money transactions ruled, for a deposit of one-
tenth of the purchase sum was requisite, and it was
necessary that the balance should be paid within a
month, on pain of forfeiting the land. The land was
divided into three categories—town, suburban, and
country. A feature of the Act was the importance paid
to agricultural reserves, and power was given to the
Governor and the Executive Council to set apart for
agricultural occupation areas of not less than 100,000
acres on the shores of the navigable waters in Moreton
Bay, Wide Bay, Port Curtis, and Keppel Bay. There
was also a provision for agricultural reserves, each of
10,000 acres, to be surveyed and proclaimed within a
5-mile radius of all towns of 500 inhabitants. Such
areas were not to be sold by auction, but were to be
acquired at a fixed price of £1 per acre, and it was
stipulated that there should never be less than 5,000
acres open for selection in each reserve. While the
land was to be paid for, as we have said, on purchase,
the title deeds could not be acquired until after six
months’ occupation and when improvements had been
effected and cultivation entered on. If the conditions
were not complied with the purchase money was
returned, less 10 per cent., and the farm was available
for the next applicant. Provision was made for acquir-
ing on lease land adjoining the farm purchased at a
rental of 6d. per acre for five years, the maximum area
which could be held being 320 acres, and that area was
to include the farm held. Purchase of the land leased
was permissible in cases where it had been fenced. It
was specifically provided that no agents were to be
recognized in the transactions. The Government dealt
with lona fide settlers personally and directly. All the
time, however, there was many a device successful in
circumventing the careful legislation evinced to prevent
land speculation and “dummying.” The Act promoted
immigration apart from its personal relation to the
selector in Queensland, which became the queen colony
in the eyes of all in Britain who turned' thoughts
to settlement somewhere in the vast spaces and freer
fields of action in the colonies overseas. The popularity
Queensland enjoyed with intending emigrants was due
in a very large measure to the Land Act which became
law during the first year of the colony’s life. Canada
had not as yet her trans-continental railway; she was
not yet a dominion, nor had she wedded her immigra-
tion system to facts in the manner so successful in later
years; while Argentina laboured under the disability
of a foreign flag and a Government suffering from
instability. Natal had all the disadvantages of a
limited field and the pronounced rivalry of a black
population, essentially servile, with all the tendencies
that system drew in its train; and although New
Zealand held her own in the race to secure the best of
Britain’s overflow population, the descendants of the old
adventurers, the Queensland land legislation seemed to
offer so many advantages that there was very wide
response and great interest shown in the colony. The
Act was a loud-speaking advertising agent. It did its
work, however, as we shall see, too well. It formed the
chief argument always of those who strove to attract
settlement to the country.
A noteworthy feature, indeed, of the Lands Act
was the provision to encourage immigration. Under
the system soldiers and sailors of seven years’ service
attained land grants to the value of £SO, while every
immigrant who defrayed the cost of his or her passage
to the colony was entitled to receive a land order of the
value of £lB, supplemented after two years’ residence
in Queensland by a second land order valued at £l2.
The land-order system was also adapted in the colony
to the encouragement of cotton-growing, for there was
a provision under which a land order valued at £lO was
given for every bale of cleaned cotton of the Sea
Island variety, the bonus to be payable to the year
1863. During the two years subsequent to that period
orders of half the value for the same amount of cotton
were to be payable. Production of the ordinary varieties
of cotton was encouraged by bonuses at half the fore-
going rates. It cannot be said the system in any form
found in the cotton industry a strong argument for the
practical advantages of the bonuses, for whether due
to the rapid recuperation of the Southern States of the
American Union after the Civil War, or to the entrance
of India into the field of cotton production, the industry
languished. Later it was smilingly asserted that in
many instances the industry was pursued for the sake
of the bonuses, and when that stage was reached the
Government, realizing probably the futility of butt-
ressing an enterprise not sturdy enough to stand alone,
withdrew the bonuses, and since that time cotton
cultivation, while known to be most suitable to the
climate and soil conditions of large areas of the country,
has languished. Even the institution of a cotton mill
failed to galvanize the industry into life. To this dav there

are those in the Agricultural Department, whose opinion
is entitled to the utmost respect, who assert that for a
a man on the land with limited means, and with a
family of children able to assist in cotton-picking,
the industry offers substantial inducements. But the
response has not been spirited, nor has the effort been
long continued. Even the announcement that a prac-
tically effective mechanical cotton-picker had been
invented has not aroused very great interest in the
crop. Cotton-growing seems to be one of those ventures
of which everyone speaks well but few embark on. It
may be that the question of labour, always a difficulty,
militated against the industry, which never failed
Queensland, for it was on the Clarence River that cane
was first grown. Mr. Adam, experienced in cane
cultivation from his residence in Mauritius and Bourbon,
acquired a farm of 350 acres, and entertained high
hopes of large finaticial returns. Whether these were
realized history tells us not. It may be that frost, the
bugbear of the sugar-grower in sub-tropical belts, was
too much in evidence, but the Clarence can claim the
honour of initiating the sugar industry in Australia.
It is not improbable that Captain the Hon. L. Hope,
of Kilcoy Station, heard of the venture on the northern
river of New South Wales, but whether that be so or
not, he entered bravely in the industry, and about the
BRISBANE IN THE SIXITES, SHOWING THE FIRST TEMPORARY BRIDGE AND THE HOSPITAL BUILDINGS.
completely, but simply had no vitality. Or, again, it
was perhaps unfortunate that another agricultural
venture, sugar-growing, had more attractions because
of larger financial returns. Be that as it may, cotton-
growing in Queensland flourishes far more extensively
in the books of lovers of the country, like Dr. Lang,
than it has ever done in the soil.
Meanwhile an industry that was destined to drive
the plough into the alluvial flats of rivers in the north,
then practically unknown, was taking form in small
beginnings. It is erroneous to say that sugar-growing
on the eastern littoral of Australia originated in
year 1862 cultivated cane near Cleveland. It is inter-
esting to learn that the pessimist, who is always with
us, found in the failure of Captain Hope to produce
sugar grounds for the surprising statement that
though Queensland could grow cane there was some
quality in the soil or climate which forbade the forma-
tion of saccharine element in the juice. It is more
than probable that the failure of the juice to crystallize
was due to wrong methods either on the part of the
sugar-boiler or in the machinery, for subsequently
excellent results were attained at the plantation, and
not only was sugar manufactured, but rum was also


distilled. On the Caboolture River, some 30 miles
north of Brisbane, the important question of saccharine
quality in the cane was settled by Captain Whish, who
with his partner, Trevelyan, had embarked in sugar-
planting. Captain Whish made an excellent quality
of sugar. So came the great industry. It was undoubt-
edly to Captain Hope that credit as pioneer in the
enterprise was due, and the Government recognized this
by making him a grant of 2,000 acres for the work he
did at “Ormiston” Plantation. It was not long before
the lead given by Captains Hope, Whish, and Trevelyan
was followed, and Raff & Company and many other
sugar-growers proved the possibilities of the industry on
the Albert and Logan Rivers, Mooloolah, and Maroochy,
and later the Brisbane and Mary, where the chimneys
of the sugar factories became familiar objects to way-
farers on the rivers.
It is in relation to immigration on the one hand
and coloured labour on the other that we desire at this
time to deal with sugar-growing. The employment of
Polynesians was only a passing phase in the life of the
colony, inevitable from the ignorance of youth in the
young colony, but none the less potent with after-
consequences in affecting social and political opinions.
In all this South Sea Island labour bore the strongest
resemblance to that question, of so much interest in the
early days of Moreton Bay, when there was, as we have
seen, a very strong section of the community, powerful
through influence if not by numbers, who strove vigor-
ously to retain convict labour, and when that object
was not to be attained, worked as earnestly for the next
best thing, the immigration of exiles or reformees, that
is, “respectable criminals,” if we may be permitted to
employ the phrase. In the one case as in the other
the cause was twofold. Cheap labour was sought, but
beyond that there was great anxiety to obtain fixity of
labour. This last factor was highly potent in moving
influences to secure indented immigrants through the
binding of those who had been given assisted passages
to the settlement to work under an agreement until the
balance owing had to be repaid. So it came that as soon
as it was realized that sugar-growing had great poten-
tialities there arose the old movement for fixity of tenure
in regard to labour with wages low, so as to secure the
largest possible profits. It may be difficult to reconcile
all this with what we have stated was the position of
the young colony in the estimation of prospective
emigrants in the United Kingdom. But it must be
conceded that it does not infer that the very best and
most suitable colonists were available for Queensland
because the vast majority of those who desired to make
their homes abroad desired to settle in the new colony.
It is possible that special circumstances might arise with
power to divert not the best but the worst settlers to
north-eastern Australia. Further, it is also very possible
that wrong methods were employed in choosing, or
rather accepting emigrants. As far as can be seen both
factors were at work in the early days, and both acted
injuriously, affecting the interests of the young colony
very materially and not for good. It may be boldly
asserted that if there had been the same care in selecting
agricultural colonists as has subsequently been displayed,
and had there also been a vigilance exercised in barring
all those who were unsuited for the conditions of life
as they were then in the new colony, the arguments for
coloured labour would have been so far shorn of their
strength as to be proved to be based on selfishness. The
factors which seemed to give an impetus to cottoxi-
growing in Queensland —the Civil War in America and
the consequent devastation of the plantations in the
Southern States and the non-production of the staple
cultural product, cotton —had far-reaching results, for
what was termed the “cotton famine” in England
ensued, many thousands of operatives in the cotton mills
being rendered penniless and starving through the
stoppage of all cotton supplies. Thousands of that class
arrived in Queensland, perhaps the most ineffective
immigrants a new colony could get. In December, 1862,
the population of Queensland was 45,077, and two years
subsequently it had risen to 74,077, an increase of
some 65 per cent., and it is not difficult to see that if
the immigrants were not of the right class, trouble
must ensue. Embarrassment did follow, could not
but follow, when thousands of men whose chief
knowledge of work centred in the whirring machinery
in the cotton factories, and wdio also were
wholly unacquainted with agriculture, were landed
among a small community whose outlook in progress
was agricultural. Beyond all that, it is stated that of
the immigrants other than factory operatives, the
greater portion comprised mechanics and tradespeople.
It is impossible to avoid blaming those with whom
rested the selection of immigrants. In truth, Mr.
Jordan, who had exchanged politics in Brisbane for the
Agent-Generalship for Queensland in London, gave
ample grounds for the keenest criticism, for in his
addresses to those who contemplated emigration he
seems to have emphasized the different conditions of
farming in the colony as compared with agriculture as
it was in England, drawing the lamentably false deduc-
tion that therefore knowledge of farming as it was in
Britain was not required. Indeed, he went further, for
he asserted that the new settler would do better had
he no preconceived ideas in regard to farming. It is
difficult to detect the atom of truth around which was
piled huge falsities of argument. Farmers may be
conservative in their methods, but above all that they
are farmers, and so might be expected to be capable of
adaptation to their new environment. The operatives had
no environment at all corresponding to any in Queensland


at that time. It was, as we may infer, the old trouble
in regard to immigration which had reappeared so often,
and from which only the best agents have been free,
the mistake of basing success on the number of people
sent, apart from all question of suitability. The diffi-
culty presented by the influx of unsuitable immigrants
was intensified by the fact that in Queensland at that
time the employers of agricultural labour were not
oversure of their own knowledge. Both in cotton and
sugar the work was largely experimental, and thus
“confusion became worse confounded.” And the high
hopes of the new arrivals were not at all lessened by
their ignorance of agricultural work, and high wages
Beyond all question, as fast as canes could grow the
suitability of the colony for sugar production was
proved. It is true that on the banks of the southern
rivers frost was found to interfere with the cane, but
that disability was never so marked as to avert the
development of the industry. It had its natural con-
sequence in the opening up to agricultural settlement
of river lands nearer the equator. The cry was “To the
north.” It is only important to remember one point
of crucial importance in sugar cultivation, the necessity
for a great increase in the number of employes during
the crushing season, which is the cane-cutting season.
When we marshal facts as we have them in regard to

were demanded, wages which the farmers who had
expended the bulk of their capital on purchasing
land could not pay. Added to this there was the old
question of uncertainty of tenure as to labour. The
busy season came, and as it did the employes often
went, for the colony was vast, and distant hills are
ever the greenest.
We have dwelt fully on the phases of the question
at that time because there is so much that is analogous
to the circumstances which moved so many twenty years
previously to intrigue for indented labour and reformees.
And then, as if to complicate the whole question beyond
all possibility of solution, there came the sugar industry.
the immigration system and the unsuitable class of
men sent out, together with the difficulty, or rather
impossibility, of securing any permanence in regard to
the services of the employes, and when we further realize
that at harvesting time increased labour, and labour
which could be depended on for the season, was
urgently needed, above all, when we add to all the
factors in moulding opinion on the subject the know-
ledge that sugar-growing would pay, pay even better
than cattle-raising or wool-growing, it is not difficult to
understand that there was soon a strong movement for
securing fixity of labour conditions and also cheap
labour, for indentured labour is always and must


be cheaper than that absolutely untrammelled and
unbound. No one at this day seeks to defend Kanaka
labour. That is not the point we desire to deal with
now. What we wish to do is to show that there arose
a movement to secure indentured labour. And the
sugar-grower who draws his supply of extra labour in
skilled and deft cane-cutting gangs who come to Queens-
land from the south season after season in plenty—save
when strikes darken the question—is hardly in a
position to sit in judgment and condemn the sugar-
grower of the sixties, who looking to the future saw
fortune in his waving canes, heard money in the rustle
of their leaves, but knew that between the cane in the
field and the sugar in the factory there was a gap which
only assurance as to labour for the season could bridge.
And look where he might in the colony there seemed no
labour available. If we would be just we must recognize
that was the way the sugar-planter viewed things. And
yet if we would also be just to the other side we muse
understand that the sugar-grower, very obviously and
very strenuously sought to obtain his labour at a rate
cheaper than the market price then ruling in the
colony, cheaper, much cheaper, than subsequent circum-
stances have proved the industry can afford to pay.
Thus we think the question of Kanaka labour must be
judged in that larger subject, on which there is now no
difference of opinion—the determination of the citizens
of the island continent to secure and maintain “White
Australia.”
It is useless to speculate what might have happened
in the forties had those who urged the retention of
indentured white labour succeeded in their efforts as
fully and successfully as did those who worked for the
introduction of indentured coloured labour from the
South Sea Islands. Progress, as we term it, would
undoubtedly have been delayed, although we must
believe that it would have been, as it was with Poly-
nesians in Queensland, an episode better for the country
if it had never been. It is not saying too much that
the contact with the inferior race, temporary though it
was, did not do the country good ; it lowered the moral
standard of the white, and assuredly it did not elevate
the moral outlook of the Kanaka indentees. Exceptions
there were to the rule, but they proved it. And it
cannot be denied that the oftener an Islander came to
Queensland the more deteriorated he showed himself to
be, the declension always being from the virtues of a
savage to the vices of a mean white, attended with a
growing hatred of the whites. The actions of the
indentees on their return to their island homes prove
how chimerical was the belief that service on Queensland
plantations had a “civilizing” effect —unless, indeed,
civilization consisted of a facility for adopting white
men’s ways, in the smuggling of Winchester rifles when
homeward bound.
To Mr. Robert Towns the country owes the first
systematic importation of Kanakas. That gentleman, a
resident of Sydney and a South Sea trader, had been
accustomed to employ Polynesians on his vessel, and
having a cotton plantation on the Logan River, intro-
duced a shipload of Islanders for work there. The
innovation was carried out unostentatiously, for the
brown men did not pass through the town, but the new
departure could not be hidden, and aroused much
comment. Then came the proved success of sugar-
planting, with that supposed gap in the outlook due to
the need for security in harvesting the crop. A solution
of the difficulty seemed to lie in the hands of the planters,
and those who realized that it would be good business
to become planters. Some of the prospective planters
had sufficient influence with the Government to bring
about a regulation of the traffic, on the lines of the
Coolie Act, but as it was deemed that the system had
come to stay, something proper to the business was
required, and so there came in time the Polynesian
Labourers Act of 1868. It was felt, as has been said,
by the employes themselves, as well as the general
public, that some protection of the Islanders, a pre-
ventive against slavery, was required. The Act was
framed and became law in order to label the traffic with
statutory respectability. But in truth the “blackbird”
trade never did become respectable. It was never
anything but an unctuous twin brother of the Chilian
slave trade among the islands. Captains and owners of
schooners employed in the work were bound by bonds
of £SOO to carry out the Act. There were provisions for
licences and Government inspection, and a Government
agent sailed on every vessel to see that the indentees
were recruited fairly. No doubt those officials did their
duty, and some died doing their duty—tomahawked or
transfixed with a poisoned spear. But allegations of
abuses and specific charges of wrongdoing, and even
murder, were made again and again against recruiters,
while the many attacks of the Islanders on the recruiting
vessels were the strongest evidence that wrongdoing had
been done by previous recruiters, for the habit of the
Polynesian was to wreak vengeance on the next white
voyagers to the island where cruelty, injustice, or
swindling had been perpetrated. And manifestly the
Polynesian tribesmen were in no position to differentiate
between an unlawful trader from a South American
Republic, Hawaii, or Fiji—at that time a species of
piebald Island Alsatia under no civilized control—and
a duly licensed recruiting vessel from Queensland. From
first to last the honest carrying on of the traffic was
hedged with difficulties, which reduced to absurdity the
assertion that the indentees in all cases were free-will
partners to the recruiting transactions. Business was
perforce carried on by recruiters and interpreters, whose
interests were “to get boys.” That the work was


dangerous was shown by the fact that while one whale-
boat was beached for recruiting business another was
used as a covering boat, standing off shore, and prepared
for all eventualities, both boats’ crews being armed.
The Government agent was there to see that nothing
illegal was done. How could he perform his duty to the
full? The position on the beach was often perilous in
the extreme, and tact and bravery were alike essentials
in the work. There was little liking for delay in the
business. Apart from all that, some one of the tribes-
men must manifestly be the party to the business on
behalf of the Islanders. That representative was natur-
ally the chief, and freewill simply vanished from the
enlistment if the chief willed
a man or a woman should
go to Queensland. The plant-
ation might mean dreadful
things, but there was fatal
certainty of what would
follow disobedience of the
chief. It is all this which
really made Government
supervision a mockery.
When treachery did take a
hand and massacre eventu-
ated, a ‘‘return boy” who
had seen three years’ service
in the colony was generally
at hand to fan the flames.
Unquestionably the labour
was cheap. The employer
paid for the passages of his
indentees and their return
trip home. For three years
he had the service of the
Islanders, each of whom
received £6 per annum,
together with clothing,
rations, and tobacco. But
the food was cheap, both
meat and vegetables being
for the most part raised by
the sugar-grower. And even if the indentee cost the
sugar-grower £26 per annum all told, that rate of wages
was cheap compared with £52 per annum, together with
rations, the wages of a white man. And the Polynesian
was a certainty right through the crushing season. lie
worked well for the most part, and that this was so is
shown by his gradual ejectment from the mill, his
exclusion from the care of horses and drays, which the
white workers in time had influence to bring about.
Ugly outrages, savage clubbings to death, punctuated
the service of Polynesians in the colony, and it is very
significant that during the last years of their term, that
period of twenty years which sugar-growers were given
F
to translate themselves from Kanaka labour to white
workers, the Islanders became very troublesome both at
Bundaberg and Mackay, tribal battles occurring as well
as attacks on whites. It is pleasing to look back on the
early days of sugar-planting in the sixties and to note
that there were some who stoutly contended that it was
quite possible to grow sugar by means of white labour.
Of those whose opinion carried weight was Mr. Angus
Mackay, agricultural editor of The Queenslander, who
did so much to assist the farming interests of the colony.
He said in 1870: “It may with some confidence be
asserted that the small plantations are the most success-
ful, and the presence of coloured or any particular
species of labour is not a
necessity in sugar cultiva-
tion here.”
Did the episode, as we
have termed it, of Kanakas
in sugar cultivation give
spurs to the coming of Lab-
our in politics, as we have
the party, consolidated and
more powerful probably than
in any other of the States ?
The question is an interest-
ing one. Further, it cannot
be doubted that alien col-
oured labourers, as they were
on the plantations, were a
means of concentrating the
political power of the party
who desired to get rid of
them, and after many years
of persistent shuffling did
succeed in securing their re-
patriation. Did the steady
focussing of attention on one
subject discipline to power
the ‘‘White Australia’’ Party
long before it adopted that
or any battle - cry ? The
point is of interest, and
facts as we have them in the early days of sugar-growing
seem to give evidence that it was so. It is noteworthy
that Mr. Angus Mackay should have had so clear a
vision as to predict that which twenty years subsequently
was adopted as the ruling principle in cane cultivation.
For the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, by providing for
advances from the State for co-operative central mills,
inaugurated very successfully the one system through
which the man with small capital and white labour could
compete with the old capitalistic planters. Mr. Mackay
says: “With an average of about six men (white),
cultivating from thirty to forty acres of cane, with a
complete manufacturing plant, costing from £2OO to
HON. ROBT. TOWNS.


£SOO, from to 3 tons of sugar to the acre, and -worth
£3O per ton, has been made.” Facts have proved that
Mr. Mackay was right in regard to white labour,
although it must also be said that experience and the
trend of experimental stages in the industry do not bear
out his contention in favour of small crushing and boiling
plants. A co-operative central mill, fully equipped and
capable of manufacturing all grades of raw sugar,
seems to be the last word in regard to sugar-making.
Turning to another product of Queensland, which
like the cotton industry may be placed in the category
of enterprises which have been and will again be, it is
instructive to observe that in the exports from Moreton
Bay during the year 1859, there appeared the item of
200 gallons of dugong oil, valued at £4OO. At one time
there was a likelihood of the dugong fishery becoming
not only very extensive but also very profitable. Dr.
Hobbes, M.L.C., from observation of the therapeutic
qualities of the oil in the case of aborigines, adopted
it in his private practice, where the results were so
surprisingly satisfactory that he decided, in conjunction
with Mr. T. Warry, to manufacture the oil on a fairly
extensive scale. The article was sent home, and was
valued, as the trade returns show, at £2 per gallon.
Lack of supervision on the part of the principals,
inevitable from other business demands on their time,
led to the work being carried on irregularly as to supply
and without care in manufacture, with the result that
the industry, which had promised so well, faded away,
even though the oil was approved by receiving a silver
medal at one of the Paris Expositions. The culminating
blow was dealt by unscrupulous oil suppliers, who to
save themselves trouble in fulfilling large orders which
had come from Europe, adulterated the dugong oil
with shark oil. The deception was detected; it could
not hope to pass unnoticed in an article used as a
recuperative agent by medical men. The fraud was
fatal. It is unfortunate that swindling took place,
for the fishery held great promise of important
industrial result, and it may be that even yet in the
hands of the enterprising there may be renewed efforts
to carry on the work on a scale commensurate with
the potentialities of the fishery. The supply of dugong
on the Queensland coast, and as far north as Papua, is
practically inexhaustible, and the feeding grounds are
co-extensive with the north-eastern and northern coasts
of Australia. It is stated that in days past, in a channel
in Hervey Bay through which the tide ran off the flats,
a continuous stream of dugong passed out, the 'mob
being so numerous as to be likened to the rush of cattle
out of a stockyard; indeed, the comparison is used by
an observer. Apart from the curative properties of the
oil, the flesh of the dugong is not only very nourishing
but also extremely palatable. When eaten fresh it
resembles tender beef or veal, and cured it cannot
be distinguished from bacon, while the skin can be
converted into the most durable leather. There seems
to be no difficulty in capturing the animals, and two
modes of fishing are effectual, one the use of the harpoon,
the other, capture by net placed in the channel through
which the fish pass to their submarine grazing
grounds. Some five or six gallons of oil are stated to be
an average return from a dugong’s carcass, and in
addition there are 100 to 200 lbs. of lean meat.
The Queensland littoral, with Papua, is the only
dominion in the Empire where the dugong is found.
CHAPTER XX.
BLAZING THE TRACK FOR PASTORAL SETTLEMENT.
The movement onward to self-government, which
was so fruitful of advancement and attended by so great
strides towards prosperity in the new colony, seemed to
stimulate development, through exploration, not only
in Queensland, but in all the colonies, and as the
unknown lay to the north, mysterious yet attractive, it
was to the latest addition to Greater Britain that the
benefits came. Stuart, who may be deemed fortunate
above his compeers in his venturing into the wilds, had
achieved magnificent results in his journey to the north-
west of South Australia in 1858, and flushed with
success, renewed his conquests in the terra incognita.
He had won for the southern colony an extensive tract
of country, discovered lakes and streams, with territory
for pastoral occupation containing millions of acres, and
now he was ambitious of crossing Australia. We can
hardly realize what explorations accomplished in those
days until we turn to a map of the time and note the
great spaces uncharted and unknown. In 1860 Stuart
surpassed himself and his previous efforts, for he
discovered Central Mount Stuart, and with an insignifi-
cant party, comprising but two in addition to himself,
he succeeded in making his way to within 70 miles of
the Gulf of Carpentaria, where he found the natives
so hostile that it was impossible with the meagre force
at his command to penetrate further. If he did not
reach the goal for which he strove, he was so near that
there are not a few who think him worthy of sharing
the honours with Burke and Wills of being the first
transcontinental travellers. Stuart, though forced to
return, possessed an indomitable spirit, and in 1861
he renewed his efforts, and made his way 100 miles


beyond the farthest point of his previous journey.
Again he was stopped, scrub and forest barring his
progress. Not disheartened, he returned, and in his
third attempt he succeeded in reaching the Indian
Ocean, his aim being to discover a practicable track
from South Australia to the Victoria River. The belt
of forest and scrub which on his previous journey had
forbidden progress was avoided by making a detour of
30 miles, and having turned the flank of the dense
enemy of his wishes, he and his companions, like those
other adventurers “on the Peak of Darien,” were cheered
by the sight of the ocean. Stuart’s stalwart perseverance
in face of every difficulty must arouse the warmest
being privately subscribed. The Burke and Wills
expedition had result, at once so glad and glorious, and
yet so sad. It was perchance that enthusiasm outran
prudence, for the outcome proved that the expedition
was too complete, the personnel over-numerous, while
attention to detail showed that theorists had been at
work. Thought was taken for everything except the
chief factor, human nature. There were devices for
converting one of the waggons into a navigable punt
when wide rivers crossed the track of the party, and
even the camels, which were a great feature of the plans
for the journey, were cared for in possible difficulties,
being provided with what may be termed swimming

admiration. He deserved the success he attained. The
exploration was fruitful in vastly extending geographical
knowledge, while science benefited largely through the
discoveries of Mr. Waterhouse, who went with the
party as naturalist.
Meanwhile Victoria, emulous of the laurels won
in the field of exploration, had been preparing to
contest the honours of pride of place, and a large
expedition, under the auspices of the Exploration Com-
mittee of the Royal Society of Melbourne, was arranged.
The public and the Government alike were enthusiastic,
and a sum of £57,000 was secured, a large portion

collars, an inflatable apparatus to sustain the heads of
the animals when crossing streams. The camels, indeed,
played a prominent part in the thought of the Govern-
ment, and the support it gave to the expedition,
which offered an admirable opportunity for testing the
usefulness of the beast of burden, the “ship of the
desert,” for travel in Australia. In that point great
success was obtained, as was shown in later days in
Western Australia. The full story of the expedition is
related in the chapters in this book on “Explorations.”
In 1861 an expedition, which though having two
starting points and two leaders was in fact one, as it


had but one objective—the discovery of traces of the
Burke and Wills party —did important exploratioti work
in the north. One division of the expedition, under
the leadership of Landsborough, started from Melbourne,
-and after calling at Brisbane sailed for the Albert
River, which was duly reached, despite a misadventure
at Hardy Island, where their vessel, the “Firefly,” a
brig of 200 tons, grounded. A depot was formed 20
miles up the Albert, and from that point on October 17
a party, which comprised Landsborough, two whites,
and two blacks, started for Central Mount Stuart,
following the Albert to its source, and thence striking
west. No water, however, was found in the creeks of
the country reached, which Landsborough named
Barkly Tableland. Thereafter a course was taken south
of the Llerbert River. Here, however, the hostility of
the aboriginals rendered it impracticable for the small
party to proceed further, and it was decided to return
to the depot, which point was reached on January 19,
1862. There Landsborough found the other division
of the expedititon, which under Walker had taken
Rockhampton as its last point of departure for the
Gulf. Walker on meeting Landsborough reported that
tracks of Burke and Wills had been seen near the
Flinders, which the ill-fated expedition had mistaken
for the Albert. These tidings caused Landsborough,
who was now in charge of both wings of the exploration,
to change his plans, for he entered on a transcontinental
traverse on February 10, travelling south by the Flinders
River for a distance of 280 miles. Heavy rains, however,
had there fallen subsequently to Walker’s discovery of
the tracks, and they were obliterated. Landsborough
then journeyed to the head-waters of Thomson River, in
the hope that he might find one of the pioneer pastoral
stations, and following the course of the Thomson he
travelled to the upper waters of the Barcoo, and so to
the Warrego. An attempt to reach Cooper Creek failed,
and civilization at its outposts was welcomed at the
station of Messrs. Williams on the Darling River. There,
on June 1, 1862, Landsborough heard of the fate of
those whom he bad adventured forth to seek and to
rescue. Melbourne, the original starting point of the
expedition, was reached in August. Landsborough and
Walker added much to the geographical and geological
knowledge concerning Australia, while no one perhaps
stimulated more fully the movement northward of the
owners of flocks and herds.
The travels of McKinlay have a keen interest for
Queenslanders, and their scientific results were import-
ant. McKinlay started from Adelaide on August 16,
1861. Beyond the fringe of South Australian settle-
ment, which then extended 400 miles northward of
Adelaide, he sought for tracks of the Burke and Wills
party. Making for Cooper Creek, he encountered
blacks who proved threatening and dangerous, but
circumventing the hostile tribesmen, he reached the
Leichhardt 100 miles from its mouth, the river at that
point being 20 to 30 yards wide. Later he found it was
between 500 and 600 yards wide when 30 miles from
the sea, the tides indeed extending so far. Maintaining
his northerly course, he went on until when some 4 or
5 miles from the sea mangrove swamps arrested his
progress. McKinlay’s farthest point north was reached
on May 10, and two days later he started on his return
to the south and civilization, travelling by way of Messrs.
Harvey and Somers’ station, and later halting at
“Strathmore,” a station belonging to Messrs. Sellheim
and Touissant, and so to Bowen, where the joarty took
ship for the south.
The vice-regal nomenclature of the town tells us
that port must then have been a veritable infant among
the centres of population in the colony. It is interesting
to know that Bowen was founded in August, 1861, and
about the time that McKinlay and his hardy pioneers
reached blue water the settlement at Port Denison
possessed the factors of prosperity and advancement,
having comfortable dwelling-houses, together with stores,
the population a few months previously numbering 120.
Bowen, it must be remembered, was then the last word
in northern settlement. It was the jumping-off place
for adventures into the unknown. Yet, young as it was,
visitors had for the Bowen of those days the same warm
words of appreciation of its fine natural surroundings
that it elicits to-day. The harbour had been discovered
during a search for the mouth of the Burdekin. That
Bowen stood just on the edge of the wilds is shown by
the fact that knives and revolvers formed part of the
equipment of pastoral visitors to the township. And
the district, with its magnificent potentialities in regard
to stock-raising was advancing daily more into favour.
Its agricultural possibilities had not been dreamt of.
Some seven months after McKinlay and his com-
panions arrived in Bowen, weary with their adventuring
in the unknown, there occurred an incident which showed
how tragic the northern coast could be to white men,
yes, and women, too, for at that time there was brought
into the tiny township James Murrells, whose story is
but one more illustration of the proverb that truth is
stranger than fiction; for Murrells, as he himself said,
was neither white nor black. How could it be other
than that after sojourning among the aborigines of
the coast for no fewer than seventeen years ? The wildest
writer of romance never penned a series of more
calamitous events than those that led Murrells into the
tribe of blacks, whose hunting-ground was near Cape
Cleveland. According to his narrative James Murrells,
at the age of twenty-two, found himself in the year
1846 on board the barque “Peruvian,” en route from
Australia to China, He had shipped from England as
a sailor on a troopship despatched with a military force


to quell a rising among the Maoris. When the barque
was fourteen days out from port very heavy weather was
encountered, and she went ashore on the Horseshoe
Shoal. Efforts were made to launch the boats, but only
resulted in the boats filling, those in them being drowned.
Then as the storm abated somewhat the survivors decided
to build a raft and await events alongside the stranded
vessel, the ultimate aim being to build a boat. There
were in all twenty-one souls on the raft, of whom three
were ladies, two children, and two male passengers. The
captain and six of the crew, of whom Murrells was one,
survived, and the captain’s wife was one of the ladies.
Fortunately the scanty supply of food they had been
Although birds were shot and sharks caught for their
flesh, the sufferings of the human beings must have
been terrible, and their number lessened rapidly. We
can picture the hard straits to which they were reduced
when we learn that on one occasion the shark hook was
bated with the portion of a leg of a sailor who had died.
Ultimately the Barrier Reef was reached, and later the
raft was beached at the southern end of Cape Cleveland.
Of the twenty-one who had left the ship there remained
but seven —the captain and his wife, Murrells, two
other sailors, and two boys. Of these two died of
exhaustion shortly after reaching the shore, and a third,
finding a canoe, started off southward. He, too, must

able to snatch had been placed on board the raft, for
the rope holding their frail ark alongside the barque
parted in the stress of weather, and they found them-
selves at the mercy of the waves. Judgment and
discipline characterized the wild drive along the coast,
for the captain did everything to apportion the scanty
supply of water and preserved meat in equal share. It
is interesting to learn that four fills of the neck of a
bottle was the daily allowance of each person, the
portion of solid food being a tablespoonful of preserved
meat. For twenty-two days they were carried by
wind and current, sometimes making 40 miles a day.
have succumbed to exhaustion, for his body was sub-
sequently found in the beached canoe a little way down
the coast. Of the four survivors one was a boy. Was
it fortunate that a tribe of blackfellows found the
perishing creatures ? But for the sake of Murrells’ life
one would say “No.” Kind and humane the tribesmen
seemed to be, for roots were given in food to the ocean
waifs, who were deemed a veritable treasure by the wild
men. But the adoption of the whites into the tribe—
or rather tribes, for the division of the captives nearly
brought about war among rival camps—entailed horrors,
and two years after the landing the captain died of a


broken heart at the degradation to which his wife was
subjected. lour days afterwards the wife followed her
husband. The boy had predeceased them. Alone with
the blacks Murrells was left, and it is noteworthy that
the tribe with whom he then lived was camped on the
site of Bowen, as it subsequently took form. After he
had lost his companions in misfortune the sole survivor
of the wreck of the “Peruvian” joined the tribesmen
who had first met the whites, and we are told that
Murrells had great difficulty in persuading those blacks
that he was not responsible for the deaths of his
companions. I hereafter the exile seems to have become
in measure reconciled to his fate, or rather hopeless of
regaining civilization. The last shred of his clothing
vanished and he went as did the blacks. He had proved
himself an adept in snaring birds and obtaining roots,
and subsequent happenings long afterwards proved that
between him and his sable hosts the relation was not
that of captor and captive but was friendly to affection.
Years passed hunting and fishing and snaring wild
things, now on the coast, and then at Mount Elliott,
60 miles inland. Seasons came and went. Years were,
however, doing something for him—they were bringing
the advancing tide of pastoral settlement nearer.
Tidings spread from tribe to tribe of white men with
guns, who sometimes shot the blacks, and still more
definite, there was further proof that the reign of a
superior race was at hand, for the tracks of cattle were
discovered. Murrells had indeed more than once missed
the opportunity of being rescued, for on returning from
a hunting trip inland he was told that during his absence
a boat from a ship, probably a man-of-war, had landed
and given gifts to the blacks. Then a white man was
seen on horseback, attended by an aborigine, and using
a long whip, obviously a stockman. All this raised the
white man in Murrells, and caused him to take command
of the primeval being he had been for so long. Talk
with the blacks led them to believe that if Murrells were
able to make his way to the whites, the shooting, of
which there had been much heard, might cease.
Murrells had dwelt on this point. So it came that
hearing the whites were near a point they had reached
in a hunting expedition, and learning from the old
gins despatched to spy out the land that there was every
appearance that a home had been formed, for there
were houses, fences, and blankets on the fences, hearing
of all this, Murrells decided to take the risk of being
shot, and ventured up to the pioneer homestead. He
was very nearly shot, for he had perched himself on a
fence, “clothed in sunshine,” and as he was subsequently
told, he appeared to be neither white nor black.
Fortunately the faintly-remembered words of his own
language stood him in good stead, and he reached the
white men, whom he saw at the house. The greeting,
“What cheer, mates ?” must have sounded passing
strange in the mouth of a naked savage! Alert against
surprise, and “a red or yellow man standing on the
rails of the fence naked,” the white man shouted to his
mate to ' bring a gun.” It would surely have been hard
had Murrells paid the price of keen vigilance against
the blacks, but his words, “Do not shoot me. I am a
British subject, a British sailor,” halted action. And
here the tragedy of the “Peruvian” may rest —with the
confusion of subject and object to which Murrells pleads
guilty in his narrative. A word is due and a thought to
the tribesmen with whom the white man had lived, not
unhappily, for seventeen years. They wept when the
parting came, and so did he, all the more honour to
him, and he had to console them with the promise that
“he would return in three or four moons.” Ultimately
he was guided, after being clothed and fed according
to white men’s usage, to Bowen. He found a town where
he had many years before pitched the gunyah he had
shared. In Bowen he died two years afterwards, but
not before he had won the right of mention among
explorers, for though given a post in the Customs Office
in Bowen, he also performed good service as interpreter
in regard to the blacks in an expedition undertaken up
the coast by the Government. “So ends this strange,
eventful history.”
There is another aspect of development that calls
for attention, for it has relation to the pastoral indus-
try, and deals, not with the venturing of individuals
into the unknown, by which vast areas of country were
made available for the flocks and herds of the pioneer,
but with influences in the mass as they could be used,
and as they were used, for the advancement not of the
community as a whole but on behalf of the interests of
a class. It is the reverse side of the shield, and it has
concern with the squatting section on the Downs, for
their aims and movement for progress in relation to
themselves. We have said that the land legislation
introduced after separation made for settlement, that
provisions were introduced encouraging selection, that
100,000 acres were set apart for the uses of the farmers,
who were attracted to Queensland by the inducement
which the Land Act of 1860 offered. Blocks of land
were to be set apart in certain given districts as agricul-
tural reserves, and also in the vicinity of towns of 500
inhabitants, and to that, as we have seen, there was
added a system of land orders, framed, as it appeared,
in furtherance of the great object which should be the
aim of a capable and sincere Administration, the
development of the agricultural potentialities of a new
country. The Act seemed to do all that was necessary
in that direction, and would have done it had it not
been wrested from its proper uses. The Act as it stood
on the Statute Book, and as it was scanned by intending
emigrants at Home, seemed liberal in the extreme, but
that was one side of the question. There was another


not so pleasant. It has often been said that immigration
and railways are the two great factors in promoting
agricultural settlement, and thus in consonance with land
legislation to promote agriculture there came a movement
for a railway. The movement succeeded, for in 1862-3 the
construction of a line westward of Ipswich to Toowoomba,
and ultimately as far as Dalby, was approved. Seemingly
the step taken, which implied the expenditure of
.£2,000,000, was a logical adjunct to the immigration
and land settlement policies of the Government, but in
reality, as results showed, it was not so, for in the
main and all the time the benefits conferred were enjoyed
by the squatters. The settlement question was but a
there has been extension to another centre of trade.
The inevitable continuation of the line to Brisbane and
its results had no significance. The lesson was to come
later. The support of the western districts, Maranoa
and Warrego, was not difficult to obtain, for the
arguments which appealed to the squatters of those
districts were the same as those which were causing the
pastoralists of the Downs to work indefatigably for the
line. The interests of the Downs men were to be
furthered wholly and at once by cheaper carriage of
goods to the stations and no less cheaper transport of
products to the port of shipment, while in the case of
the western squatters those benefits were partial, though

lay figure garbed in gaudy robes for the occasion. The
Railway Bill did not pass through Parliament without
trouble. There was indeed much energy, and certainly
great scheming on the part of the pastoral interest, dis-
played in securing support for their object, and Ipswich
joined hands with the parliamentary representatives of
the Downs in furtherance of the scheme. The interests of
Ipswich, it was asserted, would be furthered by the
line—enlarged scope in employment, increased business
for the town, and a centralizing of trade there. Such
was the song of the political syrens, and behind the
syrens were the squatters. Nothing was said of the
unenviable lot of the one-time railway terminus when
very substantial, and if the railway came but half-way
to them, they were promised that in time the extension
into their own country would take place. The influence
of squatters, even if the writing on the wall had appeared
in 1870, was at that period enormous, as a writer on
the subject truly said, “The amount of land in the
hands of agriculturists is but a mere bagatelle compared
with the enormous territory held by the squatters.” A
combination among the members of this class had to be
reckoned with ; it could not but be very powerful. The
interests of Toowoomba, Drayton, and Warwick were
told that the railway would open up splendid agricultural
land for settlement, and, in truth, it would have done


so had the men who held a brief for the line not worked
so as to prevent that desirable consummation. To the
Biisbane citizens and East Moreton settlers the pastoral
interests spoke just as hopefully, and the promised
transfer of the centre of industrial gravity from the
squatters to the farmers could not but mean a largely
enhanced importance to Brisbane as the port of ship-
ment, and beyond that it was averred the line would
attract thousands of agricultural settlers. It did, but
the pastoral lobbyists gave them no opportunities to
settle. The members for Brisbane and East Moreton
were blind to pretty pictures of the squatting advocates,
and opposed the railway in the initiative, although
later they fell into line with the other parliamentary
(representatives of the southern constituencies. It is
indeed difficult to see why there should have been any
opposition at all in the capital to the railway, for
assuredly if there were any benefits accruing from the
line in the form of increased trade, Brisbane as the port
would share them. Probably the ancient antagonism
between the seat of Government and Ipswich, which
had aspired to be the capital, was responsible for the
clouding of the issues. It is noteworthy that the railway
legislation was passed on the casting vote of the
Speaker, who was member for Wide Bay, and whose
constituents certainly opposed the line. The subter-
ranean influences at work may be gauged, and perchance
the weakness of the case of the advocates of the line
may be measured, by the concessions given to the north
and the central district, for there eventuated a railway
30 miles in length from Rockhampton to Westwood,
which for long aroused a smile, for in truth the sole
justification of the line was that it was a sop. Bowen
also received a jetty into deep water. “’Tis an ill wind
that blows nobody good.” In all that we have said it
must not be construed that there is any criticism of
the principle common sense must approve, that agricul-
tural settlement and immigration necessitate railways,
while the latter react in expanding settlement. The
line can alone be criticized, because agricultural settle-
ment did not follow the construction of the railway—
was prevented from following it.
Mr. Jordan’s work as Agent-General in London
was done too well, and the only fault that can be found
with his enthusiasm is that he argued from affairs as he
ardently desired them to be, but not from matters as they
were. As some have said very truly, agriculture in
Queensland in the first days of separation was confined
almost wholly to market-gardens and orchards. Land
was to be available for agricultural settlement, and the
inference the Agent-General drew was that the agri-
cultural reserves were to comprise the most fertile land
in the colony, the best land. Mr. Jordan was justified
in his inference from the statements made in Parlia-
ment during the passage of the Land Act, and the
assertions, that the promotion of agricultural settlement
was not the object of the measure and that the railway
was not built to encourage farmers, are proved by the
fact that the immigrant with his land order in his
pocket when he travelled in the railway saw plenty of
fine agricultural land, but found it was all locked up
in the possession of the squatters. And means were
available which had the power of transferring the
pastoral lessee into the permanent holder of his station.
The system of “dummying” was in use, and friends and
employes were requisitioned to do that which the law
forbade the squatters doing individually. No man
could hold more than a given area of land, but a coach
and four were driven through a clause of the statute
by the simple expedient of a power of attorney from
the friend of the squatter to the squatter. Again there
was the time-honoured expedient graphically described
as picking out the eyes of a run.” The squatter was
under no necessity to buy all the grazing land he leased.
None knew better than he those portions of the lease,
owing to water conditions, excellence of soil, or proximity
to roads, which if secured made all the rest valueless.
It was here “dummying” came in, and it was only by
drastic legal proceedings on the part of a Government
that realized its duty to all sections of the community
that the acquisition of large estates in freehold was
stopped. The mischief had in a great part been done
when preventive measures were taken. And the further
proof that the early squatters had acquired all the best
agricultural land was found in the passage of an Act
many years afterwards, when farmers clamoured for
land, and which provided for compulsory sale of big
estates to the Government, with the object of surveying
the land and selling it to farmers in suitable blocks.
Further, many of the holders of big estates adopted a
similar course on their own initiative, and very largely
to their benefit, when the land was adjacent to towns.
It may be said that all this concerns “dummying” and
its evils, and could have taken place had there been no
widely-advertised system of immigration, based on
facilities for agricultural settlers. “Dummying,” how-
ever, was only one phase of the squatters’ scientific
evasion of land legislation. For strange as it may
appear, the clauses of the Land Act, which on the
sui face offered so great an incentive to agricultural
settlement, were really adapted through chicanery and
sub-rosn methods to safeguarding the squatter from
intrusion on the part of the selector. It is useless to
appeal in charity to the methods of coincidence, when it
was found that with the exception of agricultural land
neai some of the coastal towns and on the navigable
rivers of the colony the reserves comprised poor land.
As the immigrant with his land order in his pocket
turned away from the only land available the oppor-
tunity of the squatter came; for the land orders were


transferrable and saleable, in truth, they were nego-
tiable to an extent that reminds one of the bygone
systems of “calabashes” in the early days of Cape
Moreton. The acquisition of land orders became a
trade, and the squatter found it a ready means of
acquiring land on his lease at far below the statutory
price. Nominally worth £lB, the immigrant, dis-
appointed in his hope of securing the fertile land he
found was unavailable, willingly sold his order at a
rate varying from £ls to £9. Again friendship played
its part in favour of the squatter, and the power of
attorney came into action, bringing him ostensibly
within the law. The land-order system indeed made
a fashion. We have said that the introduction of men
for railway construction work injured the immigrants
already in the colony, but how could it be otherwise ?
It was a direct act of injustice to them. It may be said
that ostensibly the immigrants were prospective settlers,
but in reality they found themselves from circumstances,
as we have stated them, in the position of those who,
finding their hopes foiled in regard to settlement on the
land, must obtain employment or leave the colony.
Then came in the law of supply and demand. For a
time the new arrivals refused to recognize stern facts,
and claimed the ruling wages, with the result that
inexperience and ignorance told against them, the
GROUP OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS, 1864.
“dummying” on the old lines unnecessary, for it was
itself “dummying” made easy. In yet another direction
did the Land Act and railway construction benefit the
squatter, while injuring the thousands of immigrants
who flocked into the colony, for the contractors for the
various sections of the railway obtained the “navvies”
they required from Britain, and paying their passages,
received their land orders. Here was another method
by which the squatter exercising his pre-emptive rights,
to an extent certainly not provided for in the surface
reading of the law, could acquire large tracts of his
lease. Never, perhaps, was the law evaded in so simple
result being constant changes, satisfactory neither to
employer nor employe. When the land and immigration
systems came into use labour was scarce and wages high,
as they then ruled, a shepherd being paid £1 per week
and rations, while bullock-drivers, shearers, sawyers,
bush carpenters, and artisans received large wages. The
thousands, however, who were willing to work, and for
whom work was a necessity from the facts of the case,
brought the inevitable change, for wages fell as low
as £2O per annum, ranging from that sum to £35. The
supply exceeded the demand. Was this the object of
the land legislation, with its agricultural reserves and


its inducements to farmers, the immigration system, with
its land orders and gaudily-painted pictures of indepen-
dence on the land 1 All that one can say without
accusing the Government directly of injustice against the
best interests of the country is to acknowledge that facts
bear out that conclusion. For the first time in the
history of settlement since the days of convict labour
the squatters had attained their desire.
The squatters had almost done their work too well,
and it came to them that in the future difficulties might
arise. The future carried danger to the well-being of
the colony, which they certainly had at heart, although
they fell into the error of believing that in their industry
alone, in pastoral expansion, was the one path to progress
and stable wealth. They could see that when the
railway was built a very large number of men would be
workless, and the only remedy for that was perhaps the
adoption of the course they opposed strenuously, as
against their own interests, the promotion of free
selection. In justice to men like Jordan, who had great
faith in the country, although their enthusiasm had
outrun their discretion in advocating the wide extension
of agriculture before the industry had the foundation
laid in the best land being available, it must be said
that the large influx of immigrants worked well for the
colony in one direction, as did even the consequent
lowering of wages, for as a result men went far afield,
and the northern districts were populated, towns spring-
ing up, as it was said, as if by magic. The squatting
party, however, seeing that they had overshot the
mark, began to apply the brake. The first step in the
effort to stem the tide of immigration was the restric-
tion of the land-order system to persons who came out
directly to the colony, arriving in the overseas ship at
a Queensland port. It is difficult to see in what way
the country was injured by passengers travelling to the
colony by way of Sydney as long as they reached
Queensland, but so it was decided. Parochial influences,
through one colony’s jealousy of another, justified the
step perhaps, but nothing surely justified the practical
monopoly assented to in the restriction of the land-
order system to immigrants who travelled in the ships
of one special line. Yet another restriction was intro-
duced, bearing witness to the desire to turn off the supply
of immigration, for one form of land orders was
annulled. Under the statute assisted immigrants had
been brought in large numbers to the colony, that is,
the Government became responsible for the balance of
the passage money, if the immigrants paid a part —£8
in the case of males and £4 in the case of females. For
this class land orders were available, not immediately
on landing, but each immigrant could claim an order
for £l2 after having resided two years in the colony.
This concession was wholly withdrawn. Obviously the
land-order system was becoming unmanageable, or
perhaps we may attribute the action taken to another
reason. Perchance the land orders had fulfilled their
purpose, or the traffic in them had become a scandal,
and their scope was circumscribed. Something else was
circumscribed also, and bore startling witness to the
belief that the loud trumpeting of Queensland’s poten-
tialities in regard to agricultural settlement had motives
beyond those concerned with the expansion of settlement.
A further insight into things is to be found in
the fact that the Government did not honour the
promises of its Agent-General in London (Mr. Jordan).
As a consequence the Agent-General resigned, and as
we have said, proved his belief in the capabilities of
Queensland for agricultural enterprise by devoting
himself to sugar cultivation. The resignation of Mr.
Jordan was the object desired, for the withdrawal of
the land-order system, as applied to assisted passengers,
simply stopped immigration.
It may be interesting to summarize the benefits
which the Land Act, the immigration system, and
railway construction conferred on the pastoralists.
There were three:—(l) Wages were lowered; (2)
a railway, with possible sidings, was practically
taken to the doors of the Downs squatters,
thus minimizing expenses; (3) land orders, through
being marketable, enabled land to be purchased for
much less than the legal rate, while the squatters were
favoured by their pre-emptive privileges. The goal of
endeavours had been obtained. Does it not seem so
when we learn that after Mr. Jordan’s resignation no
successor was appointed for some considerable time ?
Mr. Wheeler, chief clerk, was placed in charge of the
London office, where it may be presumed his office was
a sinecure, as an immigrant vessel was only despatched
to the colony at long intervals. The number of men
out of employment was very large, and, in truth,
conditions became serious. The period up to 1868
may well be termed the lean years of Queensland, for
while the country was struggling against unemployment,
and the determination of the influential political party
to block free selection, there came a blow that well nigh
laid the colony prostrate, for in 1866 the failure of the
Agra and Masterman’s Bank caused the Bank of
Queensland to stop payment, with the result that the
Government of Queensland suffered financial paralysis.
Immigration, which had fallen off, as we have stated,
perforce ceased, and yet there were vast spaces near
the railway line waiting for the plough. The gloom
deepened, and yet had the colonists but known, one
factor was already in action—sugar-planting, which was
to aid those in search of employment, while it proved
beyond all doubt the grand possibilities of the country
in regard to agriculture; and in the immediate future,
two years subsequently, the trumpet-call to further
progress. Nash found his nuggets; gold was discovered.


CHAPTER XXI.
THE DARK HOUR BEFORE THE DAWN.
It will be well to refer to matters of moment which
occurred in 1866, as they not only influenced political
affairs to a very marked degree, but beyond that had
a far-reaching effect on the colony, casting over it a
gloom which perhaps nothing could have lightened save
that which came about two years later in the discovery
of gold at Gympie and the assurance that in no respect
did Queensland fall short of the southern colonies’
auriferous deposits, for the wealth of the colony indeed
proved commensurate with the vastness of her territory.
The Government of which Mr. Macalister was Premier
had found it necessary to introduce a measure dealing
with the leasing of pastoral land, and providing for
resumption by the Government, in order that the
agricultural settlement of which the country—and
England—had heard so much might take place, opposed
as it was by certain interests on the Darling Downs. The
course taken was the simple application of common
sense to a problem that self-interest strove to render
difficult of accomplishment, but at the time the opposing
parties were marshalling their forces the tidings came
of a financial crisis, which could not but increase the
difficulties due to a persistent pursuit of class interests.
The Agra and Masterman’s Bank had failed, and the
colony was deeply affected, for Government cheques had
been dishonoured through the shutting of the bank doors,
and further, there was inability to meet payments to
contractors for public works. It was decided to appoint
a Select Parliamentary Committee to report on the
subject, the gravity of which can best be gauged by
the finding of the Committee, which advised as the best
means of relieving the colony from its temporary financial
embarrassment: That there was a pressing and immedi-
ate necessity for £IOO,OOO, and further for £400,000
for public works; that the failure of the Agra and
Masterman’s Bank had deprived the Government of the
stipulated advance of £IOO,OOO in the current month and
£50,000 in each succeeding month, to be provided by
the institution on a security of debentures, deposited
with their manager for sale, and immediate steps were
imperative for raising funds within the colonies for
present requirements, pending other arrangements for
loans authorized by Parliament. It was further advised
that legal tender notes should be issued, as being the
only means of affording relief. The Committee reported
against the acceptance of the offer of limited assistance
from the Brisbane Bank managers, conditionally on
public works being stopped and the imposition of
additional taxation at the rate of £200,000 per annum.
The Committee recommended (1) That the Govern-
ment be empowered by Parliament to issue treasury legal
notes to an amount not exceeding £200,000, the
estimated present note circulation of ttie colony; (2)
that in anticipation of the sale of debentures, repre-
senting the loan of 1866, steps should be taken to
empower the Government to issue short-dated bills,
secured upon the consolidated revenue of the colony to
the extent of £250,000, at a rate of interest not exceed-
ing 10 per cent, per annum, the interest payable in
Australia and New Zealand; (3) that while taxation for
public works was not expedient, it was advised steps
should be taken for augmenting the public revenues to
a limited extent.
At this time when the need for concord was very
apparent, it seems inexplicable that the Governor should
have strained relations with the Ministry. He considered
that he should be the adviser of the Government, and
not the Government the responsible advisers of the
Governor, as representative of the Grown. The Governor
thought that there was no necessity for legal tender
notes, and that Treasury bonds were sufficient. The
Ministry resigned twice. The Governor refused to
accept the resignation the first time, but as he wrote
the Premier (Mr. Macalister) a letter scolding the
Ministry for mismanaging the financial affairs of the
colony, the Ministry again resigned, and this time the
Governor accepted the resignation. Mr. Herbert and
Mr. Raff were sent for, but neither was prepared to take
office, although each undertook to make the financial
arrangements, previous to forming a Ministry. This
attitude aroused keen criticism from Mr. Macalister,
who contended that the members in question had no
right to enter the House until they had sought re-election
from their constituents. Conditionally on Mr. Herbert’s
new Ministry being gazetted, Mr. Macalister said he
would support the passing of a Bill for the issue of
Treasury bonds, but would not be party to the passage
of the taxation measure. Thereon Mr. Macalister left
the House, stating he would not enter it again until the
Ministry was gazetted, and the following members
followed him: Messrs. Mackenzie, Bell, Lilley,
Challinor, R. Cribb, Forbes, Pugh, Stevens, Brooks, and
Edmonstone. The measure for the issue of £300,000
in Treasury bonds was passed by the Lower and Upper
Houses, but the Herbert Ministry did not materialize.
We are told that public opinion, not only in Brisbane,
but throughout the country, strongly condemned Mr.
Herbert, who was practically mobbed in a street in
Brisbane, being forced to seek refuge in a cab. Facts
as they then were seem to show that the public had
formed a fairly good estimate of the party to whom they
were in the main indebted for the financial straits and


difficulties to which Queensland was for a time reduced.
The attempted blocking of railway communication from
Ipswich to Brisbane had not added to the popularity
of the squatter’s friends, nor was the unpopularity
lessened by the tidings that yet another blow had fallen
on the country, for the Bank of Queensland had sus-
pended payment, complicating the financial question yet
further.
The point of appeal to the electors in the case when
a member took office seems to have been a fruitful
cause of parliamentary discussion in those days, and the
step taken to render re-election unnecessary was proved
to be very wise, although it is undeniable that the old
system was useful on occasion. In 1867 the position of
Mr. John Douglas, who through the resignation of Mr.
Watts (Minister for Works), in order to visit England
had exchanged his portfolio of Colonial Treasurer for
the Works Department was challenged, the question
being brought to a test by a supporter of the Government,
Mr. Pugh, who moved that the seat of Mr. Douglas be
declared vacant. The Government went to a division
on the motion, with the result that nineteen votes were
cast for it and five against. Mr. Macalister took
umbrage at the vote, stating it had placed the Ministry
in a position he had not anticipated and which he was
not disposed to occupy. As a result of advice to the
Governor Parliament was prorogued, and an election
followed, the burning question being land legislation.
Mr. Mackenzie, who had supported Mr. Macalister,
became Premier. The third Parliament assembled on
August 4, 1868, taking possession of the present Par-
liament House, which was then ready for occupation.
Rather an unusual feature of the first day’s deliberations
was a motion of want of confidence. The supporters of
the Government who represented distant electorates
were not in their places, and the Ministry, having tried
all other means to avert a division, was forced to leave
the chamber, saving itself from defeat by securing
a count-out.
The troublous times in Parliament in 1866 were
but the reflection of the crisis which the colony as a
whole was experiencing. A prolonged drought had
added to the difficulties brought about by determination
to place class interests in the foreground, to which must
be added the lack of wisdom displayed in bringing vast
numbers of settlers to the country, while as yet there
was no consensus of opinion in regard to the important
question of agricultural development. Unemployment
called for attention, and so pressing was the need of
providing work that relief camps were established at
various points by the Government, men being employed
on the roads. That they were willing to work for 6s.
a week and rations shows that the times were hard
indeed ! Again, the state in which the few farmers in
the country found themselves bears yet further witness
to the calamitous circumstances from which all suffered,
for the storekeepers in many instances were unable to
pay cash for the maize, potatoes, and oaten hay brought
in for sale. It was in truth the darkest hour before the
dawn, but as there was no sign of the coming day, all
who could do so, especially, we may believe, those who
had found it impossible to realize the high hopes which
they had brought to Queensland, made their way to
the southern colonies, doubtless with many an anathema
on those who had painted the country as an agricultural
paradise. “Jordan’s lambs,” as the immigrants were
often termed, were anything but sheeplike in their
outlook on their new home.
And then came Gympie. The hope that somewhere,
sometime, the expectations roused by Canoona would
be fulfilled still lingered among those who had good
reason to believe they knew, for of the prospectors who
doggedly pursued their search for gold in the colony,
many had gained experience on the goldfields of Victoria.
And indeed there were those who in other callings
retained the memory of their gold-digging days in the
south. Of such was Denman, a timber-getter, seeking
cedar on the banks of the Upper Mary. To him there
came one day a prospector, James Nash, weary of
working at Nanango, where gold-seeking did not pay.
At a hint from Denman, Nash went in search of a gully
which had seemed promising to the cedar-getter, and
which he said he himself should have prospected had not
his cedar logs demanded all his attention. Nash found
the gully and he found the gold, the report reaching the
public on October 20, 1867. There was a reward of
£I,OOO for the man who discovered a payable goldfield,
and in addition an area equal to twenty men’s ground
as a prospecting claim. Beyond that the Government
had offered a reward of £3,000 to the person who dis-
covered a goldfield “not nearer than 20 miles to an
existing goldfield and capable of supporting 3,000 people
for six months.” James Nash, as those who knew him
are aware, was a quiet, simple-minded man, whose
thoughts, if they did not flow quickly, were ruled by
prudence and foresight. No one could have acted more
wisely and judiciously than he did, for though the
gold he found was sold at Brisbane, thereby raising
expectation on tiptoe, he averred that it was obtained
at Morinish, a northern field of no value. Meanwhile
Nash communicated with his brother in Sydney, and
a mate, Malcolm. The problem Nash strove to solve,
and which he did solve, was to obtain as much gold as
possible before the inevitable rush came, and yet not
endanger the winning for himself of the reward. The
first lot of gold he sold in Brisbane totalled 75 ounces.
He camped in a secluded hollow off the Brisbane-
Maryborough track, for a road it was not, and there he
and his mates washed out dirt to good purpose, securing
200 or 300 ounces in a few days. For a considerable


time Nash worked quietly and successfully, the curiosity
ot his sole visitors, stockmen from the neighbouring
stations, being allayed by the confession that he was
digging gold, but that luck had not come. The
simple-minded, truthful man when he determines to lie
generally does it well. The stockmen went away well
satisfied, not dreaming that they were literally walking
on gold. Then came an alarm. A stranger passing
along the track aroused the watchfulness of the dog at
the camp, which gave tongue before it could be silenced.
Again Nash gave token of his prudence. He did not
know what the stranger thought, but he took no risks;
and so he made his way into Maryborough, carrying
vith him gold the value of which was estimated at
■\aiious sums as high as <£l,ooo. The reward was
claimed, and Nash got his prospecting claim. And here
where he was deservedly popular. To Nash and
Denman it was given to lighten the gloom which over-
cast the colony. Gympie did more, however, than all
that was accomplished in the vast wealth that it poured
into the lap of Queensland, for with the work of Nash
and Denman came the firm conviction that there must
be other large auriferous deposits in the colony. Had
there been no Gympie there might never have been a
Charters Towers, a Palmer, or a Mount Morgan.
It is not difficult to picture the wild excitement
caused by the discovery of gold at Gympie. Within a
week there were 500 people on the field, and it was
not with them, as it was with the men at Canoona, to
go home in disppointment, for in three months
the population of the field had increased to some 16,000.
Large nuggets rewarded the industry of the miners, one

it may be mentioned he had promised to secure a claim
for Denman, to whose good offices it is stated he owed
the lucky find. In addition to the reward, he is said
to have won some £7,000 from the gold. lie did not
receive the larger reward of £3,000, to which he was
entitled, if not at that time, then certainly later.
Perchance the acceptance of the one reward was sup-
posed to have cancelled the other. Nash and his brother
married and took a trip to England, where doubtless
they aroused much interest as lucky diggers. On
returning to the colony, with a goodly portion of their
fortune diminished, the Nashes became hosts of the hotel
at Saltwater Creek, some 6 miles from Maryborough, and
on the road to what was then termed '‘The Bay,” for
Pialba had not taken form. Denman subsequently
became landlord of the Royal PTotel in Maryborough,
of 8,040 ozs. being found at a point near where the post
office was built. Meanwhile the keen search for alluvial
gold had told the experienced miner that there was
good prospect that the quartz deposits at a lower depth
would yield a golden harvest. Enterprise was rewarded,
for the Lady Mary reef was discovered in November,
1867, and this find was followed by the Caledonia and
other reefs, giving assurance that the field was not
solely alluvial. The rich results of quartz-mining may
be realized from the fact that from 10 tons of stone
taken from the Caledonia 998 ozs. of gold were extracted,
while later from the same mine Dodd won 11,000 ozs.
from 10 tons of stone. No fewer than 367 ozs. of gold
were extracted from 3 cwt. of stone mined in the
California. In all three crushings from the Caledonia,
aggregating 3,164 tons of stone, gave a yield of no less


than 75,936 ozs. of gold. It is no wonder that Brisbane,
Maryborough, and indeed all the towns of the colony,
were depleted of their male population, while diggers
flocked in from the southern colonies as fast as steamers
could bring them.
It is needless to enlarge on the effect of the gold-
finding at Gympie. Trade in all places was stimulated.
One direct and immediate result, apart from the calling
into existence of a new town, which sprang up like a
fairy city at the waving of a magician’s wand, was that
Maryborough escaped the calamitous pressure of hard
times, in which all the other centres of population were
involved. In one very important direction also the
farming industry of the colony received an impetus,
many of the men who won gold in mining—and kept
it—turning their attention to agriculture. It was not
long before the needs of the gold-diggers found response
from those who were in search of land to cultivate, and
apart from the work done by the Chinese gardeners in
that direction, farms were formed on the flats and in
scrubs in the neighbourhood of Gympie, for there was
on the Upper Mary and its tributaries extensive tracts
of land, which though subject to floods were very
fertile. There maize, green fodder, potatoes, and
other crops were speedily cultivated.
We have spoken of the relation of the explorer to
the pastoralist, and as it was with the squatter, so it
was with the agriculturist, for the latter found his path
cleared by the timber-getter. Along the banks of the
rivers there were discovered many varieties of timber,
which found ready sale after passing through the
sawmills, and it is noteworthy that this was the only
manufactured industry at that time which found outlet
in export, for sugar-growers had not yet overtaken the
requirements of the colony in regard to their product.
Work in the alluvial scrubs naturally assumed two
stages for the most part, cedar being first sought, while
thereafter came the search for pine beach, blue and red
gum, ironbark, and cypress pine. It will be remembered
that in the days of transportation the convicts were
employed in cutting cedar, and since that period up to
the time of which we speak, a quarter of a century or
more, the timber-getter had been steadily working, push-
ing his way northward, and always as he went bringing
tidings of new areas fit for the hand of the farmer. There
were about the year 1870 two sawmills in Brisbane, the
supplies of timber being drawn from points distant from
the capital, for the trees at Coomera and Nerang to the
south, and northward at Maroochy and Mooloolah,
were laid under contribution. A large number of men
beyond the actual getters of the timber were employed,
work being found for numerous puntmen and raftmen,
while steamers and sailing craft were further engaged
in the industry. As it was with Brisbane, so was it
also with the rivers to the north, and there was one
sawmill at Noosa, while three were at Maryborough.
Yet another was at the new town of Gympie. Supplies
of timber for the Maryborough mills had been drawn from
the scrubs on the banks of the Mary in the year of which
we write, and further afield from the rich wood lands
of Mount Bauple, a few miles from the small township
of Tiaro. The wooded banks of the Susan and Gregory,
with Tin Can Bay and Fraser Island were also laid
under contribution.
It is of interest to remember that the centre of
gravity in regard to the sugar industry has more
than once shifted. In the beginning the rivers
immediately to the south and north of Brisbane
attracted all attention, and cane fields rapidly spread
along the banks of the Logan and Albert, the Cabool-
ture and the Brisbane. Then later, when the crop found
favour in the Mary River, that district speedily asserted
its claim to be the centre of the industry. In truth, in
1870 the banks of the Mary were with scanty exception
one vast sugar plantation from a point but two miles
above the town to beyond Antigua, where the railway
bridge crosses the river. On either side was waving
cane, with mills, emphasizing the importance of sugar,
factories were hardly in any instance farther than a
mile or two apart. At a distance of 10 miles from the
town by road there stood Yengarie, on the creek from
which the works took their name. There Messrs. Tooth
and Cran established the largest sugar factory in the
colony at that time, capable also of carrying on the
process of manufacturing sugar into the last stage of
refining. In conjunction with the enterprise of sugar-
growing and manufacture of which Yengarie was the
busy scene in the sugar-crushing season, the proprietors
of the extensive works turned their attention in the
“off” season to the manufacture of extract of meat,
Yengarie being an avant coureur of the Queensland
preserved meat industry. The picture of the Mary, as
it was in those days, is incomplete if we omit that on
almost every sugar farm, as the small steamer churned
its way up stream, could be seen gangs of Polynesians,
indentees waving their hoes in greeting and with shouts
that sometimes reminded the spectator of the man-
eaters’ ovens in the New Hebrides or the Solomon
Islands, for many of the Islanders rejoiced in blackened
and sharpened teeth, while not a few wore necklaces of
other men’s teeth. Sugar was supreme on the Mary in
those days. Later the centre of the industry shifted
northwards to Mackay, and although other rivers still
farther within the tropics than the Pioneer have
disputed pride of place with Mackay, that district,
expanding far beyond the most extravagant hopes of
its early cane-growers, still claims precedence among
the sugar producers of Queensland.
In 1868 Mackay, or as it was then termed, Port
Mackay, had begun to assert itself in regard to


sugar-growing, and, in truth, there never was a halt in
the advance of the town, which was named after the late
Captain Mackay, for many years Port Master at
Brisbane, and who in one of his trips to the north lighted
on the Pioneer River. The normal evolution from
pastoral to agricultural intei'ests was experienced in the
Mackay district, for both cattle and sheep had been
successfully raised in the hinterland. The success of
sugar-cultivation in the south had drawn attention to
the capabilities of the district, or rather that part of
it comprising the rich plain stretching 10 or 12 miles
inland from the town. And with the occasion there
came the men in Messrs. Davidson and Fitzgerald, the
former being well versed in sugar-growing in the West
Beyond that, all the available land was eagerly taken
np, those astute enough to see that a land boom was
coming making large fortunes. In truth, there was no
difficulty in the land-buyer securing a phenomenal
return for his outlay, for it was not long before land,
bought at the Government upset price of £1 per acre,
was sold for £2O to £3O per acre. In view of large
areas further afield in the district which were subse-
quently devoted to sugar-growing, it is extraordinary
that the Government did not encourage settlers by
throwing open some of the splendid agricultural land
now converted into waving cane fields, but probably the
question of transport for cane and sugar alike prevented
that action, which would undoubtedly have accelerated

Indies, while the latter was a surveyor, whose know-
ledge of the land in the district was extensive. The
combination of knowledge and experience in one field
as in the other was a happy augury of success. The
outcome of the partnership was the sugar industry.
Never, perhaps, save in the case of a goldfield, did
settlement and prosperity follow more swiftly on
enterprise and energy. In the year of which we speak
Messrs. Davidson & Co. had at Alexandra Plantation
260 acres planted with cane, having in addition a well-
equipped mill, with the best appliances for crushing
cane and boiling juice. There was also an area ot
150 acres planted with cane at two other plantations.
greatly the progress of the district, surprising as it was,
when tied and bound by land speculation. Be that as
it may, money for investment poured into Mackay in
the last years of the sixties and the first years of the
seventies. Despite, however, the high price paid for
sugar land, there were sound business principles under-
lying the system of settlement in what well may be
termed Mackay’s palmy days, for the country being plain
land could be prepared for cultivation at far less cost
than the very heavily-timbered scrubs on the Mary
River. And again there was hardly any fear of frost,
that bugbear of the sugar-farmers on the southern
river lands. Mackay in those days was boldly in favour


of Kanaka labour, and not only were Polynesian
indentees employed in field work, but they were also
trained as house servants. Mackay was indeed a very
good replica of a West Indian colony. An effort had
been made about this time to embark in sugar culti-
vation at Bellenden Plains, south of the site of Cairns,
Mr. Davidson and other gentlemen interested in the
industry initiating a plantation there under the man-
agement of Mr. Armstrong, who had gained experience
of the industry in Demerara. The aborigines were,
however, very troublesome, and the venture was aban-
doned either for that reason or because of the difficulty
of carrying on an undertaking beyond even the outposts
of the industry at the Herbert River. It is noteworthy,
however, to remember that the enterprise which found
at Bellenden Plains the best facilities for cane culti-
vation has been amply justified in its judgment by the
large areas devoted to sugar-growing many years
afterwards in the Cairns and Port Douglas districts. In
1870 there were 800 residents in Mackay, all supported
by sugar, while a weekly steamship service linked the
district with the south. In 1869 the output on the
plantations amounted to 393 tons of sugar, with 9,900
gallons of rum, and in the following years the products
of the cane fields had increased to 819 tons of sugar and
23,985 gallons of rum. In all there were 830 acres of
land planted with cane, of which 538 acres were crushed.
The average yield of sugar in that year was 1 ton 10 cwt.
1 qr. 16 lbs. per acre, and as the price of sugar then
averaged £3O per ton, going as high £4O, it is not
difficult to see that the industry was so remunerative
as to put in the shade the successes of the pastoralists.
There were sugar kings as well as cattle kings.
Turning to mining, it is interesting to note that
while Gympie grew and expanded there was another
pause in the industry, proving again the apophthegm
that Nature never gives with two hands. The batteries
increased their output as they increased in number, the
gold escort, as it swung down the Gympie road and
across the ferry punt, where the Lamington Bridge now
stands at Maryborough, was always an object of interest
with its heavily-armed guard of mounted police, but
there was no sign yet of a rival to Gympie, eager as
prospectors were in many a district to win fame and
fortune. In truth, Gympie overshadowed all the other
goldfields of the colony. And yet the latter are worthy
of recognition as the link between hope and realization.
The small goldfields were always the promise of that
which might be. In May, 1868, the Kilkivan rush came,
and the pretty vale, hedged in by hills on every side,
attracted a large number of miners. The gold deposits,
as far as they were unearthed, were not rich, however,
but the mining was not difficult, the work being not
far from the surface and the gold obtained easily in
the vicinity of an open creek. Kilkivan was a poor
man’s goldfield. Some 6 miles away other diggings
opened at Black Snake, but in neither case were high
hopes realized, although mining plant, obtained at
Kilkivan, but not used for very long, bore witness that
there had been the hope of big things. Jimna Creek
diggings, south-west of Gympie, and in hilly country,
was another poor man’s diggings, but yet at one time
there were, it is stated, 2,000 men at work there.
Another field which also for a time attracted a lai’ge
number of diggers was termed Sunday Creek, from the
day on which payable gold was discovered. As claims
could not be pegged out on Sunday, one can picture
the excitement of the expectant miners, eagerly awaiting
Monday morning, and in many instances, as we are
told, making sure of possessing their claims by camping
on the ground. Imbil, some 20 miles south of Gympie,
was the scene of another rush; it maintained a small
population for a time. It may be mentioned that at
the Black Snake and Cooree rich copper lodes were
discovered and to some extent worked. In addition to
Canoona, whose golden dream caused Rockhampton to
spring into being, there were other small diggings in
the State, among which were the Crocodile, Morinish,
Cawarral, New Zealand Gully, and Rosewood. There
is not one of the goldfields, however insignificant now,
which did not contribute largely to the advancement
of the goldmining industry of Queensland as a whole,
and indeed, wherever digging is still pursued at those
small fields, there will be found sanguine residents as
full of hope regarding the future as they are ready
with theories concerning the cause of failure in the
past, and assured success to come. At Clermont also,
at the time of which we write, gold-digging was engaged
in, although the rival mining industry at Copperfield,
a town 2 miles distant, attracted interest for the most
part. It may be interesting in view of the recent flood,
attended by many fatalities, to note that in 1869 flood-
waters swept down and nearly engulfed Clermont. The
mistake of choosing as the site of the town the bed of
Wolffang Creek was recognized, and aroused comment.
Subsequent events, however, have hardly borne out the
statement of a writer in the days of which we speak,
who said, “Taught by bitter experience, the people of
Clermont are gradually rebuilding their town on the
ridge beyond, where they will be free from all danger
of floods.”
It will be of interest to glance at some of the
important statistical returns up to the year 1867, as
Gympie at the end of that year made in a real sense
a new departure for the colony in progress towards
prosperity. In regard to agriculture, we find that the
total area under wheat was 2,657 acres, grown for the
most part in the districts of Warwick and Drayton and
Toowoomba. In all 10,598 acres were devoted to maize,
each of the following districts having more than 1,000


acres under that crop—Warwick, Ipswich, Drayton,
Toowoomba, Woogaroo, Logan, and Brisbane. The
land under cultivation for potatoes totalled 1,912 acres,
Drayton and Toowoomba being the largest contributors
with 620 acres. Cotton figures largely in the returns
for the year, and the importance of the industry, under
stimulation of the bonus system, may be gauged by the
fact that in four districts there were inspectors at work
supervising the industry, and presumably the distri-
bution of the bonus. The total area under cotton was
8,149 acres, of which 4,529 acres were cultivated in the
Ipswich district, and 1,009 at the Logan. The land
devoted to sugarcane comprised nearly 2,000 acres, the
areas in the several districts being as follows;
Maryborough, 456 acres; Logan, 416 acres; Cleveland,
308 acres; Mackay, 267 acres; Warraba, 239 acres;
Brisbane, 124 acres; Townsville, 65 acres.
Turning to the pastoral industry, we find that the
wool produced in 1867 was 21,554,557 lbs., valued at
£1,462,209, compared with the figures for the year
1860, which were 5,007,167 lbs., of the value of £44,188.
The return of stock for the year with which we are now
dealing (1867) was as follows:—Horses 53,146, com-
pared with 52,301 in 1868, an increase of 845; cattle
940,354, compared with 919,414 in the preceding year,
an increase of 20,940. In 1867 the total number of
sheep in the colony was 8,665,756, an increase of
1,386,968, compared with the figures for the preceding
year, which ■were 7,278,788, In 1867 the number of
pigs in the colony totalled 18,142, as compared with
13,961 in 1866, an increase of 4,181.
The sale of land is an excellent index of the growing
prosperity, and it does more, for it gives good proof of
the influences at work in regard to settlement and
immigrrtion to which we have referred. In 1861 the
land sales totalled 51,815 acres, as compared with
23,587 acres in the preceding year, the value of the land
sold being £88,722, compared with £37,830 in 1860.
During that period the sale of land in the Port Curtis
district advanced from 2,079 acres, valued at ,£4,817,
to 6,906 acres, valued at £15,059. In 1865 the land
sales had risen to a total of 138,855 acres, valued at
£217,459, the district showing the greatest advance
being Moreton Bay, where the figures were 23,435
acres, of a value of £72,468. That was the high-water
mark. In 1868 the sales had decreased to 104,265 acres,
of a value of £132,049, Moreton Bay again standing
first, with 20,787 acres, valued at £29,337. In the
following year there was a still more serious slump in
the business, for the figures of 1867 were 41,765 acres,
representing the total land sales, the value in all being
£49,837. The district showing the largest sales was the
Darling Downs, where the area sold was 25,265 acres,
valued at £26,495.
The factors which governed the acquisition of land
in the main are proved by the returns to have affected
purchases from the Government under the pre-emptive
right system. In 1860 the total area so alienated was
4,337 acres, while in 1865 the sales had increased to
101,865 acres. In the following year there was a
decrease, the land purchased under the pre-emptive
right in 1866 being 62,548 acres, while in 1867 there
came a great diminution, only 640 acres being sold.
The colony in its early days must have been law-
abiding in the extreme, for the returns show that in
1859 the number of persons brought up for trial for
various crimes and offences totalled 57, of whom 35 were
convicted and 22 acquitted. In 1867 there were only
55 persons put on trial at the various courts, the
convictions being 36 and the acquittals 19. As the
population, which was estimated at 25,020 in 1859, had
increased in 1868 to 96,890, more than threefold, it
is very obvious that the community at the latter date
must have been extraordinarily free from crime.
During the year 1867 the insolvencies totalled 158,
the liabilities in all being £411,092, while the aggregate
assets were £329,510. The dividends paid amounted to
£7,000.
CHAPTER XXII.
THE CLASH OF POLITICAL ARMS.
Political questions of great importance occupied
the attention of Parliament in the first year of the new
decade. In 1871 the squatting members were strong,
and had no hesitation in showing their strength,
the confidence they displayed eventually proving
their undoing, and being indeed a source of weak-
ness. The Ministry was strong, but it sought
still further influence —and was checked. In Novem-
ber, 1871, Mr. Palmer, who was then Premier,
G
introduced a Bill to increase the number of Members of
Parliament. In doing so he was in full touch with
popular opinion, for it had become manifest that a House
of thirty-two members including the Speaker, was
numerically inefficient—had been proved inefficient by
the prominence given to sectional interests and the
power of a few members acting in unison to block legis-
lative business and control the affairs of the country. It
was not the proposal to increase the membership of the


Legislative Assembly, which aroused strong antagonism
from the Opposition, but rather that which was beneath
the policy, and was shown forth in the methods which
the Government proposed to use in attaining its object.
The scheme, as interpreted by the Opposition, not only
provided for eleven additional members in the Lower
House, but contemplated the constitution of new elec-
torates, to be formed at the expense of Opposition
constituencies, while the electorates which had returned
to Parliament supporters of the Ministry were not to be
interfered with. The Premier floated with the tide of
advanced Liberalism, while he theorized concerning the
principle of adult male suffrage; but there was no claim
on the part of the Ministry that the additional seats
and redistribution of constituencies were to be allotted
on the basis of population. It was asserted by the
Liberals that the only interests considered were those
of the squatters, and that still greater dominance on
the part of that influential section was the sole object
of the new proposal. Obviously the Ministers could have
cleared themselves of all charges of selfishness levelled
against them by accepting the suggestion of the
Opposition that the election of new members should
precede the question of subdivision or redistribution of
constituencies. The Government, however, would not
accept the advice tendered, and when the debate on the
second reading of the Electoral Districts Bill had
terminated the Ministry proposed to go into Committee
of Supply. The Opposition was determined, with the
result that the sitting was protracted until 3 p.m. on
the following day, when general business fell to be dealt
with. The Ministerial Party met the tactics of the
Opposition by vacating the chamber, and the Opposition
adopted a similar course when it suited its purpose, one
count-out following another during five weeks. At the
end of that time (the second week in December) the
Treasurer announced that it was necessary that a Money
Bill, providing Treasury Bills to the value of .£IOO,OOO,
should be passed in all stages through the House in one
day, as the sum specified was required to meet the
financial engagements of the ‘Government. It was
explained that the legislative measure must be approved,
as the honour of the colony was at stake. To that
argument the Opposition made rejoinder that the
Ministry must accept the result of its attitude in not
taking the House into its confidence. There was no sign
of yielding.
Feeling ran very high in the Legislative Assembly,
where relations became very strained, the most startling
incident being an order by the Speaker that the sergeant-
at-arms should arrest Mr. Pring; the Speaker’s action
being due to that member laying hands on Mr. Clark,
who had called attention to Mr. Pring interrupting
speakers. The recalcitrant member evaded the officer
of the House, and left the chamber, but was subsequently
arrested on a Speaker’s warrant at Ipswich, although
he had attempted to escape from Parliamentary
jurisdiction by resigning his seat. Brought from Ipswich,
whither he had gone to attend the sitting of a law
court, it was found that Parliament had been prorogued,
and no further action appears to have been taken by
the Speaker. Mr. Pring subsequently contested the
Brisbane seat, the other candidates being Messrs. Handy
and Pugh. Mr. Handy secured the favour of the
electors.
The tactics adopted by both parties in Parliament
practically caused the cessation of business from the end
of November until January 10, 1872, when the leader
of the Opposition, Mr. Lilley, who had convinced the
Government that he had a strong force behind him,
made a proposal to the Ministry in order to bring what
was a deadlock to an end. He suggested that as the
Government was determined to proceed with an electoral
measure it would be well to withdraw the Bill, as it
then was, and introduce a new one, providing for
a redistribution of electoral boundaries throughout the
colony as a whole. The suggestion was adopted, on the
understanding that the most urgent legislation should
be dealt with, the electoral measure to be considered in
April, when the new House reassembled. The Ministry
then obtained supply, and reform in the procedure of
carrying out elections was agreed to. Among the
features of the latter was a provision for extending the
franchise, and also the abolition of the system by which
the candidates were nominated at the hustings. The
question of railway extension, owing to the influence
of sub-parties, or “bunches” as they came to be termed,
had been delayed time and again, and an effort was
made to cut the Gordian knot by appointing a Com-
mission to report on the linking of Peak Downs with
the Rockhampton railway system, together with the
continuation of the southern and western railway
system from Ipswich to Brisbane. The difficulty
experienced in the House, due to the cause we have
stated, arose from the fact that the northern members
placed all their weight on one point solely, the securing
of further railway facilities for the electorates in which
they were interested, while the members for Ipswich and
West Moreton, representing a solid phalanx of six-vote
power, insisted that there should be no extension of the
southern lines to Brisbane. To this sub-party, measures
for the welfare of the country as a whole were of no
importance, Administration might come and go, but
for them there was only one bond of unity, one cause
of opposition, one reason for support, the determination
that Ipswich should continue to be the terminus of the
southern railway. Such a policy is almost inconceivable
when we remember the delay, the inconvenience, the
increased cost to the community as a whole, which
perforce resulted from the practical boycott of the


metropolitan port of the colony. As it was with
the northern members and the Ipswich sub-party, so
was it with the representatives of the most thickly
populated constituencies in the south, who also were
prepared to throw their weight into the scales; for the
position taken up, with more show of reason, as voicing
the will of the majority, was that they would not support
the northern extension unless under promise that the
line to Brisbane would be simultaneously approved.
If hypocrisy be an unconscious recognition of good-
ness, what are we to say of a Liberal political programme
emanating from a Conservative Ministry ? That question
calls irresistibly for answer when we hear the programme
of a party essentially under Conservative influence hailed
as Liberal. In the speech of the Governor, setting forth
the views of his constitutional advisers at the opening of
Parliament in April, 1872, there is a significant reference
to the question of immigration and the working of
the Act dealing with
the subject, which it
was stated “would
require earnest at-
tention, experience
having shown that
the Act had not
served all the pur-
poses for which it
was framed.” Bills
for appointing new
members and the
redistribution of
electorates were pro-
mised, and reference
was made to the
forthcoming report
of the Commission
on railway exten-
sions. It is instruc-
tive to note how careful of tender susceptibilities
was the wording of the speech, for in regard to the
southern line, members were told that the Commission
would deal with the extension of the railway “to such
a point on the river near Brisbane as may seem most
advisable.” One can almost hear the political cat purr !
And again equity and justice reigned supreme in the
statement that in the event of a loan for the railway
extensions being required, the Government will feel
it its duty to include in it certain sums in proportion
to the revenue derived from districts which will not be
benefited by a railway extension, to be spent in local
improvements to those districts.” Further, there was
an anxious solicitude for all interests, in words which
only a cynic can appreciate fully, for in asking favourable
consideration for the railway legislation the Government
averred it would “neither over-tax the community nor
g 2

over-excite the labour market.” The “necessity for pro-
viding land for settlement and cultivation and for
immigrants with land orders” had a place in the Minis-
terial policy, and it was announced that “the authority
of Parliament would be asked to resume leased land in
the settled districts, and for a measure to be introduced
to set apart for homestead purposes and immigrants’
selection only, portions of land so resumed, as well as
some of the lands now available for selection.” Plere,
indeed, were all the principles of equity at work. With
so large a sowing it is strange that the harvest was so
small. A searchlight was also thrown on the relation
of the party in power to Kanaka labour. Further, there
was reference in the Governor’s speech to cable com-
munication with Java, in the intimation that the
permission of Parliament would be sought to enter into
negotiations with a company for the laying of a cable
from Batavia to Norman Mouth, in view of the delay
on the part of the
South Australian
Government in
carrying out the
work. There was
also mention of the
construction of a
telegraph line to
Normanton. Care
for the development
of the north was
shown in a proposed
exploration of the
northern rivers,
where it was hoped
rich agricultural
land would be dis-
covered with a view
to settlement. The
importance of sugar-
growing had manifestly been grasped, and all that the
industry might mean to the colony realized. In another
direction did the Ministerial programme refer to sugar-
growing, for it was announced that in view of the
allegations of ill-treatment of Polynesians by those
engaged in the recruiting trade, and of wrong-doing in
securing workers for the plantation, the Imperial Govern-
ment had offered “to send out a Commission to investigate
and report on the traffic as a whole, conditionally on
the cost of the enquiry being borne by the Queensland
Government.” The speech stated that as the question
was an Imperial as well as a colonial one, the
Ministry hesitated to commit the colony to an unknown
expenditure, but would assist in any enquiries on
the subject.
It is very interesting to ponder what might have
resulted had the Ministry agreed to the suggestion of


the Home Authorities, which arose from the indignation
aroused by facts which transpired at the hearing of the
“Jason” case, as it was termed, when certain persons of
the “Jason,” a recruiting ship from Maryborough, were
brought to trial. If an Imperial Commission, as the
result of investigations in the colony, and at the various
island groups whence supplies of labour were obtained,
had reported against the traffic and advised that it
should cease, would that finding, if obeyed by the
Colonial Government, have reacted injuriously on the
sugar industry, arresting progress and circumscribing
developments ?
Action would still have been possible in two direc-
tions, the cultivation of sugar by white labour or by means
of coolies from India. And while it is true that not a few
persons at that time were convinced that sugar could
be produced profitably, then as now, by means of white
labour, it is no less true that those who held that opinion
were for the most part not engaged in the industry or
financially interested in it. Under all the circumstances
it is very probable that the Government would have been
placed between the horns of a dilemma, being forced
to the approval of coloured labour from India, with the
alternative of shouldering a responsibility very great
indeed, the accusation that they were killing an industry
already seen to be of very great importance to the
colony. We do think that the Government, no
matter what politicians held office, would have faced
unpopularity from a very important section of the
community. The pastoralists would undoubtedly have
stood alongside of the sugar interests, and as the
outcome there would have been the inevitable com-
promises, and the coolie would have come to Queensland.
It is not altogether fruitless to follow this line of
thought, as it naturally leads one to consider what
might have eventuated in regard to democracy in
Australia had the Queensland Ministry taken other
action than occurred in regard to the Kanaka labour
enquiry.
Despite the Liberal tendency of its policy, of which
the Governor’s speech gave evidence, the Ministry
showed no sign of a weakening in the principles it
held, and which Mr. Palmer reavowed on being twitted
with a change of political viewpoint. And the Premier
forthwith proved that he had full confidence in the
strength of his party, for he gave the signal for onset
when he announced that as soon as the Bill for the
Redistribution of Electorates had been introduced he
would insist on the House granting Supply for nine
months. The challenge to battle was accepted, and
after the Redistribution Bill had been read for the first
time, Supply was sought on the lines stated. The
Opposition expressed willingness to grant Supply for
two months, but the Premier held to his point. No
progress was made, the Opposition showing a determined
front. Then intervened business in the seeking of power
by the Government to lay a cable between the Norman
River and Java, together with the establishment of a
postal service to England via Torres Straits, and to
neither proposal was there any exception taken. But
feeling still ran as high as ever, for on the question of
Supply being resumed there ensued a political ‘no
thoroughfare,” the Premier asserting that the principle
of majority rule must be obeyed. The Premier's phrase,
“majority rule,” however, had different aspects, for it
was pointed out that in addition to the numerical insuffi-
ciency of membership in the House, the majority of the
members had been during the past six or seven years
elected by a small minority of electors of the colony,
the disproportion increasing instead of decreasing. It
was further contended that those districts which were
over-represented had made little if any progress, while
in the constituencies which had not been granted
representation according to their inhabitants, wealth
and importance had vastly increased.
The squatters, it was contended, had been the
most influential class when separation took place, and
had continued to hold power since that time. It was
further asserted that in view of the necessity for a
redistribution of the boundaries of electorates every
advantage would be taken by the Opposition of the
forms of the House to refuse Supply until the reform
sought was granted. The gravity of the situation may
be gauged by the announcement that the Supply for
three months previously granted had been exhausted,
and there were no funds to pay the salaries of public
servants, with the exception of the police force, whose
pay could be met by revenue from the Customs, while
the members of the railway service had only been paid
up to date. Such is a brief outline of the argument
voiced in arraignment of the Government by the
Brisbane Courier of the day, and the Ministry and the
class it represented are certainly stripped of all claims
to the support of those whose political ideal was the
advancement of the community as a whole. It is a heavy
indictment against a section to assert that its members
claimed to have a vested right in regard to best Crown
lands of the colony, which they individually leased, and
it is a very serious charge against settlers in a new
colony of vast spaces that they saw interlopers in all
newcomers, and opposed the opening of land for settle-
ment which might interfere with their pastoral runs.
Circumstances show that both parties in the House
were thoroughly tired of the political situation, the
distaste at the blocking of necessary business, responding
probably to stronger feeling aroused in the constituencies.
Be that as it may, the Governor gave considerable
umbrage to the Opposition by his expression of opinion
that they were contumacious in opposing a granting of
Supply to the Ministry, although it must be confessed


that members opposed to the party in office gave His
Excellency the opportunity of reproving them by
addressing him in regard to the strained relations. The
memorial to the Governor, if at first it led to action
which was resented, in the end was the means of
terminating the difficulty, a compromise being effected
by the Government agreeing that the two vexed questions
of Supply and the electoral districts’ boundaries should
be taken in such wise together that neither could be
carried without the other.
A glance at political events in 1872 would be
incomplete were there no mention of the entrance into
Parliamentary life of Mr. S. W. Griffith, then a young
barrister, and who afterwards as Sir Samuel Griffith
became widely known and greatly popular as the leader
of the Liberal Party, and who in future years won place
and power through his gifts as a statesman, becoming
and the mills has been and is done by white men can
have no conception how widely spread was the belief
to the contrary. One would almost imagine that by
reiteration of the statement the advocates of alien
labour had convinced themselves, for it must have been
known to very many of those who held a brief for
Polynesians or coolies, that farmers who grew cane could
work, and did work oftentimes in the cane fields, even
though they might be the employers of Kanakas. In the
main, however, the employment of Polynesians was more
popular than that of indentees from India, owing,
doubtless, to the fact that it seemed less difficult to
regulate the supply, and further, among all save those
directly interested, there was the belief that the use of
Islanders in the industry could be more easily stopped,
should that step ever be deemed necessary, than in the
case of the Queen’s subjects in Hindustan, who were

known not only throughout Australia, but in the wider
field of the Empire, his influence being recognized and
his advice on national subjects sought long after he left
the arena of politics for the bench of the High Court
of Australia. Mr. Griffith was elected for East Moreton
on April 3, 1872, defeating his opponent, Mr. Robert
Cribb, by a majority of 198 votes.
It has been stated that in the event of Kanaka
recruiting being tabooed, it is more than probable that
pressure would have been brought on the Government
to take action to secure coolies from India, and, indeed,
at the time of which we write opinion was divided among
those who asserted their conviction time and again that
the sugar industry could not be carried on in the
tropical and sub-tropical coast-lands without coloured
labour. Those who know how all the work in the fields
always closely cared for by the Indian Government.
The Kanaka labour trade was indeed from first to last
never so firmly founded as its supporters could have
desired, and the reports of kidnapping on the one hand,
or murders by the savage tribesmen on the other, were
ever shaking the system to its base. There was doubtless
an impression in the sub-consciousness of very many in
the colony that Polynesian labour could never be a per-
manent institution of the country; probably this caused
Mr. Fitzgerald in 1874 to table a motion in Parliament
to provide for immigration of coolies from British India,
and the salary of an immigration agent in India. It
was desired, in short, to put again in force an Act on
the subject, passed in 1862, but never brought into
operation, because steps had not been taken to comply
with the regulations of the Indian Government in regard
85
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


to the immigration of coolies. Mr. Fitzgerald, in
supporting his motion in Parliament, voiced the old
arguments in favour of cheap labour, averring, in addi-
tion, the points that coloured labour of one variety or
another was necessary, and that the white residents in
districts where sugar was the chief industry did not oppose
black labour, realizing that the employment of cheap
aliens opened up new fields of employment. To a certain
extent this may have been true, doubtless was true, but
it cannot be questioned that in the large centres of
population the antagonism to coloured labour, whether
Polynesians or Indian indentees, was very strong, and
was growing stronger as the years went on. Mr. Fitz-
gerald, in truth, did not find the House sympathetic;
he did not even find the Government favourable to his
proposal. Mr. Macalister opposed the motion strongly,
on the ground that it would be practically impossible to
confine the coolies to the districts where their services
were required for sugar-growing, and he further argued
that if coolies were introduced their presence in the
country might deter intending white emigrants from
coming to Queensland. We may be permitted to doubt
whether the Government would have taken that stand
had not the Polynesians been available. As things were,
the planters were in possession of cheap coloured labour,
and it was probably considered by the Ministry that
until Kanaka labour failed there was no necessity to
pile Pelion on Ossa in donatives to the planters. One
form of black labour at a time was perhaps considered
as much as the public conscience in Queensland would
permit. The fact that Messrs. Ilodgkinson and
Macrossan, who had both signed the manifesto issued in
favour of a motion, saw fit to wheel in line with the
other side, may be taken to support the contention that
under ordinary circumstances the outlook of the Govern-
ment might not have been just what it was in the
debate. Mr. Palmer expressed his sympathy with the
planters, but found a path which led him to his
political friends without trespassing on the peculiar
field of the sugar industry, for that experienced political
warrior, with great ingenuity, attempted to divert atten-
tion from the attitude of his party to the main point
in the question by criticizing the system under which it
was proposed to appoint the Agent of Queensland in
India. An amendment by Mr. Palmer that the planters
should deposit the salary of the immigration agent with
the Treasury before the amount was placed on the
Estimates did not display flattering confidence in the
northern men, who, to do them justice, were doubtless
quite prepared to deposit the agent’s salary thrice-told
did they but obtain their coolies. But the time was unpro-
pitious, and Mr. Palmer’s amendment in the ultimate,
having been accepted by Mr, Fitzgerald and embodied in
the motion, the latter was defeated by eighteen votes
to twelve.
In 1874 the Palmer Ministry gave place to the
Administration under the leadership of Mr. Macalister,
of which Mr. Griffith and Mr. Mclllwraith were
both members, the former being Attorney-General.
Men well known in the political history of the
country had seats in the Cabinet. Among them
were Mr. J. R. Dickson, Mr. George Thorn, and
Mr. E. O’D. MacDevitt, who jireceded Mr. Griffith as
Attorney-General. The Ministry held office for two
years, and very important subjects were dealt with
during that period. One, education, may be said to
have been settled definitely, for the Queensland
scholastic system then assumed in great measure the
form it bears to-day. Another question, that of
land administration, a much-vexed subject, was dealt
with by compromise, the authors of the measure being
compelled to content themselves with far less than they
desired to obtain.
In 1870 the system of free education had been
adopted. There was provision for scholarships at
grammar schools, although competitive examinations
were not systematically instituted until 1873, the
scholarships, of which there were seven for boys, being
tenable for one year, and the value being equal to the
fees for tuition during that period. In 1874 the term
of the scholarships was extended to three years, a sum
of £SO being given to assist the pupil in defraying the
cost of living, that amount being inclusive of the
payment of the school fees. In 1870 a measure had
been passed to promote classical and scientific education,
provision being made for conducting examinations for
matriculation, and another to obtain degrees in Arts
and Science, in connection with any University in the
United Kingdom. The facilities for obtaining the
degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws at the
University of London were largely availed of, but the
coping-stone to the educational structure, a University
for Queensland, was realized to be very necessary as the
jmars passed.
The stride forward represented by the institution
of free education did something more than confer a
great gift on the children of the colony, for it proved
that the old system of administration under a board
was wholly inadequate. Mr. Griffith’s name deserves
always to be remembered in connection with the educa-
tional system of Queensland, and he saw very clearly,
as he told his constituents on one occasion, that a
necessary preliminary to dealing with the subject was
the settlement of the much-argued question of secular
and denominational teaching in combination. The
Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches were firm in
their determination to retain the system then in use,
which enabled them to impart religious teaching in their
own schools, while benefiting by State aid in payment
of their teaching staffs. There will always be a


difference of opinion in regard to the question, and in the
Ministry there were divided counsels. In one aspect
the citizen as a taxpayer might claim the right of
religious training for his child. On the other hand,
was it possible for a department administered by a
member of the Cabinet to have under his control
schools which by the facts of the case must be
under a different jurisdiction. The necessity for
system seemed to compel the adoption of secular
education, especially
as in it there was
provision for religious
teaching before or
after the regular school
hours. The primary
question, therefore, as
Mr. Griffith held, was
the abolition of non-
vested schools. The
Assembly passed a
Bill providing for one
system —secular, free,
and compulsory —but
the Upper House re-
jected it. Subse-
quently, however, a
measure became law
in 1875, instituting
the system of educa-
tion as we have it
now, action resulting
from the report of a
Commission appointed
by the Government.
It will be interesting
to many to learn that
the members of the
Commission comprised
Messrs. Douglas, Grif-
fith, A. J. Hockings,
C. S. Mein, W. H.
Walsh, and Mr. Har-
lin (headmaster of the
Brisbane Grammar
School), together with
Dr. O’Doherty, Dr.
Prentice, and Mr.
Justice Lilley, who had relinquished politics for the
ermine of the Supreme Court.
Legislation in regard to land, as the question went
to the foundation of party aims and objects, always had
power to arouse bitter controversy It was stated at
the time when Mr. Macalister assumed office that he had
taken as the best weapon in his armoury the question of
reform in regard to land-holding, and he certainly made
THE LATE SIR SAMUEL GRIFFITH, WHO BEGAN HIS LONG POLITICAL CAREER
IN 1872, WHEN HE WAS ELECTED AS MEMBER FOR EAST MORETON,
a dash for popularity when he succeeded in passing
through the Assembly a measure which gave the
Government power to deal with all the pastoral leases
in the settled districts. The Legislative Council,
however, refused to pass the measure, on the
ground that the squatters having covenanted for
leases of ten years could not be asked to surrender
their runs when only six and a half years of the
lease had expired, unless the lessees were given com-
pensation. Under all
the circumstances it is
impossible to believe
other than that Mr.
Macalister “rode for a
fall.” The Ministry
declined to give com-
pensation, and finding
the Upper House ob-
stinate, took another
path to reach the point
it sought. The Land
Act then in force pro-
vided that by the votes
of both Houses of Par-
liament any quantity
of land could be re-
sumed from existing
leases, and under that
section the Govern-
ment sought permis-
sion from Parliament
to resume from the
runs in the settled
districts areas aggre-
gating more than three
and a quarter millions
of acres. The resolu-
tion, though stoutly
opposed in the Lower
House, was finally
carried, but was re-
jected when it was
sent up to the Council.
It may be mentioned
that while the Bill,
which the Assembly
passed and the Council
rejected, provided for resumption of land under
the unexpired portion of ten-year leases, it reduced
the maximum areas of land to be selected by any
one person to one-eighth of the amount permitted
under the Land Act of 1868. Efforts were made
to root out the evil of “dummying,” while, with
the exception of the right to sell to the selector land
leased for pastoral purposes, the leasing rights of the
HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Grown tenants were safeguarded. In view of the
opposition of the Legislative Council the Government
had recourse to powers vested in the Ministry by the
Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1860 and the Home-
stead Areas Act of 1872. The fact that the statutes
in question enabled the Ministry to attain in some
measure its desire seems to show that the Upper House
was distinctly reactionary in its attitude to settlement.
But did not Mr. Macalister have good ground for
knowing the Council would decline to pass the measure ?
With the advent of Mr. Griffith there came a power
into Liberalism in a wide and non-party sense, and that
notwithstanding the fact that he was a leader of a
party, for beyond his party-politics and through his
brilliant career democracy came into its own and arose
in conscious power, despite Conservatism in party or
Socialism through party. Mr. Griffith’s thoughts in
regard to Crown lands may be fittingly summed up in
his words to the electors of Oxley when he took office.
On that occasion he said, “He must tell them that he
was not prepared to state distinctly the details of the
policy of the Government on the question of the future,
but he could assure them that it was its desire to open
the lands of the colony for settlement as rapidly as
possible, and to resume from unlawful occupation all
those lands which had been acquired by fraud. This
latter question was one which he had especially brought
before the House during the last session. Although he
was not in a position to say at present what was or what
was not ‘dummied’ land, as that was a subject which
would come before him in his position of Attorney-
General, and regarding which it would be necessary to
take what action he considered right and proper, still,
he could assure them of this, that however powerful and
influential the individuals, steps would be taken to
resume all lands that could not be proved to have been
honestly acquired. That was a sine qua non. This was
a question on which he had expressed the most decided
opinions, and one of the strongest reasons which had
led to his acceptance of office was that as Attorney-
General it would be within his province to deal with
these matters. With regard to the land question
proper, he could only say that it was the wish of the
whole Ministry to open land for settlement as speedily
as might be, and the modes in which it wished to
effect settlement, he thought, on the whole were of
comparatively trifling importance.” The last words of
the quotation display a masterly breadth of view in the
outlook on settling people on the land, and it would be
well were later generations to adopt the standpoint of
the great statesman. The man of narrow views is ever
enmeshed in details; the man of wide outlook rises
above them.
The strife in Parliament, the opposing forces of
Liberalism pitted against Conservatism in the years of
which we write, points to something more than personal
ambition, conscious of articulation, for even party
struggles bear witness to something worthy of winning,
and indeed at that time the swiftly-growing forces of
production were a grand promise that Queensland would
take her place as one of the greatest of the Austral
territories. The dark days had passed away. The golden
harvest at Gympie had been reaped, but the prosperity
was not, as in some gold-producing countries, ephemeral,
and it was in that way that Queensland differed
from most other lands. The gold-find on the Upper
Mary marked a new departure, it stimulated to energetic
effort, but the resources of the colony were so manifold
that gold-production became but one of many factors in
advancing progress and national wealth. The colony
stood, then as now, second to none in its potentiality for
pastoral development, but there had arisen a great
agricultural industry in sugar-growing, which gave
assurance even then of that which has since come to
pass, inducements to investors superior probably to any
other in all the world, with a reacting stimulus on many
an industry. And the same could be said of other
phases of farming. Nowhere could workers, thrifty and
industrious, be so sure of founding a full and free pros-
perity on the land as in the colony of those days. And
all this is no word-painting; it is a statement of a fact,
to which the author of “Progress of the Colony,” in
Pugh’s Almanac for 1875 bears witness when he says : “It
is quite certain that at no period of her existence as a
colony (not excepting the good times, times of feverish
excitement and speculation) has Queensland ever shown
such signs of well-being as at the present time.” Were
further proof required it may be found in the fact that
in 1873 the revenue exceeded the expenditure to the
extent of ,£189,170, being £1,120,030. It is noteworthy
that never was labour better paid—according to the
standard of those days—or more difficult to procure.
How could it be otherwise, when large areas of land were
continually taken up by workers. The dearth of labour
aroused complaint during the year 1874, when 7,000
immigrants landed in the colony. The population, which
totalled 120,076 on September 1, 1871, had increased to
163,517 at the end of 1874.
All spheres of industry responded to the lifting
power of prosperity. As a vigorous physique throws off
disease and passes unhurt, where one of delicate consti-
tution would be struck down, so did the colony emerge
from the financial crisis and hard times of eight or
nine years previously. Proof of the inspiring vigour of
Queensland in those days was to be found in the large
amount of money for investment which flowed in freely
from the capitalists of the southern colonies. As a
tribute of belief in the stability of the industrial enter-
prises of the country nothing could be more satisfatorv
than the coming in of money from other parts of


Australia, all the more as this financial movement was
contemporaneous with the transmission of large sums
from the Mother Country for investment. In other
spheres the march onward was conspicuous and note-
worthy. In most of the towns excellent schools of arts
and libraries were to be found, and whether the fact be
deemed an unmixed blessing or not, there were thirty-
three newspapers published at that time in the
colony. It cannot be disputed that the standard
of political life was high, in witness thereof may
be mentioned the self-denial displayed by the
Upper Chamber in declining the proposal for "the
remuneration of the members of the Legislative
Assembly,” when a Bill to that end was sent to the
Councillors for approval. And yet there was a crumpled
rose leaf in the couch of Content, for we find a writer
in those days warmly urging that steps should be taken
to bring about the
institution of a
“colonial nobility.”
In those days
many "new chums"
trod the streets of
Brisbane, all with
high hopes concern-
ing the future,
some of them hardly
realizing that upon
their own exertion
and their own
energy was to de-
pend that future
which was as bright
to them as the
clear skies and the
glowing sun overhead. There is, we think, no other
country in the world where new arrivals were treated
quite in the same way as were the expectant settlers on
first landing in Australia from the "cabined, cribbed,
confined” monotony of a three months’ voyage on a
sailing-ship. For, in truth, the new chum was
made to feel that for him there must be an appren-
ticeship in colonial experience before he could assert his
right to that intangible citizenship outside of all laws
and provisions. So did the colonies of Australia assert
their superiority to all other countries, a claim which
the descendants of those of the old days have striven
to make good in fields other than the social one. For
the most part the immigrants assumed their proper place
quite meekly, doubtless full of hope that the position
of inferiority in the knowledge of all things useful in
the country was only temporary. The main thorough-
fare of the capital would have been of a width more
fitting for its dignity had it not been for the interference
of Sir George Gipps, whom colonial legend credits with
expressing horror at the waste of land inferred in giving
a width of one and a half chains to the streets of any
of the towns in Moreton Bay settlement. And a chain
wide did the streets become. Governors were not an
unmixed good in the old days.
Beautiful as the Botanic Gardens are now,
winning the admiration of all visitors to the city, it is
but justice to the authorities of those days to say that
they were then the delight of all who loved Nature in
her most bounteous mood, for all that could be done
under the circumstances and with the means at his
command, was accomplished by the curator (Mr. Hill).
It has been well
said that no "ex-
penditure was ever
made by the colonial
Legislature which
has returned better
interest than the
very modest grants
which have been
made for the main-
tenance of these
gardens." And it
may be noted in
passing that “in
many instances,” as
Mr. Hill stated in
one of his reports,
"private enterprise
has proved successful, the first experiment having been
made from seeds or plants procured from the gardens.
This especially applies to the articles cotton and sugar.
In some of the districts some thousands of plants of
coffee have been distributed in response to applications.”
Wine-producing grape vines, from cuttings obtained
from South Australia and America, were also extensively
distributed, while for cuttings from the thirty-six
varieties of sugar cane then in the gardens there
was an immense demand. That energy and enterprise
must have been notable characteristics of the settlers
in Queensland at that time is shown by the fact
that in all in one year no fewer than 60,980 plants,
cuttings, and packages of seeds were distributed among
530 persons.

Explorers and Explorations.
CHAPTER I.
FIRST DISCOVERIES.
Stories of tragic death and mysterious disappear-
ance alike are interwoven with the history of Australian
exploration, both by land and sea. Leichhardt’s
expedition plunged into the interior wilderness of the
little-known continent to meet tragic experiences, from
which no survivor was spared to tell the tale. At sea
the fleet of three French ships, commanded by La
Perouse, sailed from Port Jackson, at the time
when Governor Phillips was founding the settlement
there, never again to be seen. The crew of the
“Endeavour,” while Captain Cook was cruising along
the Queensland coast on the most important of
all voyages of discovery to Australian waters, by the
intervention of Providence or the caprice of chance, by
a hair’s breadth escaped destruction in regions from
which the story of their ending probably never would
have reached the ears of civilized men.
While skill and daring necessarily formed con-
spicuous elements in the make-up of the earlier naviga-
tors examining the coast-line of the island continent,
it is those who faced the inhospitable wilds of the
arid interior whom we must credit with a degree of
courage greater even than the bravery of men risking
their lives in the initial investigations of lands which,
though presenting dangers of their own, at least were
reasonably free from the horrors of long weeks of a
lingering death from thirst and lack of nutrition, such
as slowly sapped away the strength of members of
the Burke and Wills expedition, and made hideous the
end of others who gave their live® in the interests of
colonial progress. Thirst and hunger always have pre-
sented the principal obstacles in the way of Australian
land exploration, and whilst Captain Logan was mur-
dered, it is thought, by blacks, though possibly by
escaped convicts, when exploring in the Moreton Bay
district, and other investigators have died violent
deaths, the loss of life that has occurred in pursuit
of Australian geographical research has mostly
resulted from lack of water and food. Of all the
States, the death-roll has been heaviest probably in
Queensland.
The earlier explorers of the Australian coast
mostly confined their investigations to the north-
western side of the continent. On account of the
uninviting character of the land in that region the
further examination of the little-known southern land
undoubtedly was discouraged and postponed, thereby
profoundly altering the history of its future and prob-
ably preserving its possession for the British Empire.
The turning-point in the destiny of the continent came
with the voyage in 1770 of Captain Cook in the
“Endeavour” along the east coast, from a point where
the boundary between New South Wales and Victoria
now reaches the Pacific Ocean to the extreme northern
extremity of the mainland. The establishment of the
penal settlement at Port Jackson followed as an imme-
diate result of the glowing account brought to England
by that famous navigator of the forest-clothed, fertile,
and well-watered 2,000 miles of coast which he had
sailed along, frequently landed upon, and closely
examined, first at Botany Bay and then at several
points to the north of Moreton Bay, which he also
entered. To Captain Cook, more than to any other
single individual, do the people of Australia owe their
present unchallenged possession of a whole continent.
How remarkably rapid was the subsequent growth to
prosperity and wealth of the settlement is matter of
common knowledge. But worthy of quotation is the
first impression made by Sydney on the observing mind
of Charles Darwin, perhaps the greatest of the mighty
19th century scientists, on January 12, 1836, when he
first beheld the town on Port Jackson. “At last,” he
wrote, “we anchored within Sydney Cove. We found
the little basin occupied by many large ships and sur-
rounded by warehouses. In the evening I walked
through the town and returned full of admiration at
the whole scene. It is a most magnificent testimony to
the power of the British nation. Here, in a less-
promising country, scores of years have effected many
times more than the same number of centuries have
done in South America. My first feeling was to con-
gratulate myself that I was an Englishman.”
A lengthy account of Cook’s explorations in Aus-
tralian waters, together with an outline of what is
known about the discoverers of the continent, appears
in the early section of the History of Queensland in
the first volume of this work. The best testimony of
the thoroughness with which the commander of the
“Navigator” carried out his task, and of the complete
confidence reposed in his judgment by the British
Government was displayed in the action of the authori-
ties who decided, on data rendered available by his


expedition and practically uncorroborated by the testi-
mony of anyone not included in the company of that
vessel, to send out a penal settlement to take up its
permanent settlement upon the shores of Botany Bay.
Almost a century and a half have elapsed now since
the return of the “Endeavour” to home waters, and our
wonder is naturally aroused at the Government having
despatched to the antipodes a whole colony of men,
ships, and equipment without first sending out some
kind of an expedition to verify, add to, or modify the
facts obtained and views formed by Captain Cook and
those with him. the time intervening between then and
the piesent certainly has brought to light nothing to dim
the brilliant reputation of the gallant explorer, either
as a man of hon-
our whose veracity
might be accepted
unquestionably, or
as an explorer of
keen judgment and
exceptionally pains-
taking and indus-
trious character;
but the time which
would have been
occupied in further
investigating the
ability of Botany
Bay for purposes of
settlement, especi-
ally seeing that
Cook himself did
not examine or re-
port upon the
place with that
end in view, cer-
tainly appears to
offer a weak reason
for committing the
living freights of
an over - crowded
fleet of ships to a part of the world so far removed from
civilization that nearly a year must pass before a ship
sent to Europe for succour could return. That grave
risk actually was taken subsequent facts amply demon-
strated, whilst a general bungle, out of which might have
arisen a tragic termination to the whole enterprise,
was avoided by the operation of pure chance. Cook
had sailed past Sydney Heads without suspecting the
existence of Port Jackson, and the discovery of that
port after Governor Phillips had found Botany Bay
totally unfitted for the purpose the authorities had
intended it should fill, came as a happy revelation,
saving the fate of the settlement from failure, if not
far worse, but not counted on in the arrangements

ENGLAND TO AUSTRALIA.
upon which the undertaking had been planned. Prob-
ably, when at a later stage the population of the infant
settlement was in dire straits through food not having
been sent at the proper time, the blunder would not
have been fallen into had more been understood in
England about the productive possibilities of the land
in the immediate neighbourhood of the embryo town.
Yet the fact remains that the authorities committed
themselves to important steps on the strength of the
testimony of Cook to an extent never equalled before
or since in the case of any uncorroborated explorer.
When Cook made his voyage, and when he and his
scientific and other companions were collecting the data

Eighteen years after the departure of Cook from
Botany Bay, Phillips arrived with his fleet of vessels
laden with a human freight and supplies needed for
settling. During the intervening period the keel of
no ship had cleaved the silent waters of that port, and
no white man had cast eyes upon any part of the coast
from that point to Cape York, in the far north.
With the exception of two flying visits to Tasmania
—which was believed until the beginning of the next
century to form part of the mainland—Australian
exploration had been brought to a complete standstill
by momentous international conflicts on the opposite

side of the globe. But with the founding of Sydney
information as to the character of the eastern side of the
continent came thick and fast. It is from then that
the story begins of the investigation of that vast stretch
of country to be constituted afterwards into the colony,
and then the State, of Queensland.
CHAPTER II.
EARLY VOYAGES OF FLINDERS.
After the discoveries of Cook, the next compre-
hensive examination of the east coast of Australia, to
the north of Port Jackson, was carried out by Matthew
Flinders. This daring navigator, whose name stands
so intimately linked with the exploration of the sea-
board of the southern continent, was born at Doning-
ton, in Lincolnshire, in 1777. He was a descendant of
Flemish ancestors introduced into England by Henry
VII., who had demonstrated to British farmers what
might be done in the way of intense culture on what
originally were poor swamp lands. Young Flinders
began a seafaring life at eighteen years of age, when
he volunteered for service on the “Sapio,” under
Captain Pasley, afterwards becoming midshipman on
board the “Providence,” commissioned to carry bread-
fruit from Tahiti to the West Indies under the com-
mand of Captain Bligh. When the latter voyage had
been completed, Flinders was transferred to a 74-gun
ship named the “Bellerophon” and acted as aide-de-
camp to Lord Howe, which position he occupied at the
time of the victory of June, 1794. Later the future
explorer joined the “Reliance,” arriving at Sydney in
1795 as a midshipman attached to that ship, which was
commanded by Captain Hunter.
A few months after his arrival at the infant
settlement the young naval officer began his career as an
explorer. The earlier voyages upon which he embarked
were aimed at investigations along what now is the
coast of New South Wales and to the south. Though
they do not directly concern the subsequent settlement
and development of the north-eastern corner of the
continent, they cast a vivid light on the natural courage
and determination of the young sailor who was to
accomplish so much in adding to the knowledge col-
lected by Cook. The first of these enterprises was
made in the company of Bass, the subsequent discoverer
of the straits separating Tasmania from the mainland,
and with a boy. In a tiny craft, only eight feet long,
appropriately named “The Tom Thumb,” the little
party sailed from Port Jackson to Botany Bay and
examined George River, to a point twenty miles beyond
where the previous survey had been carried. The result
of this expedition was that the Governor shortly after-
wards himself examined the locality and a new branch
of the colony, under the name of Banks Town, was
established there.
After taking a voyage to Norfolk Island under
more orthodox circumstances, Flinders and Bass, in
March, 1796, set forth upon another enterprise in “The
Tom Thumb.” Their object this time was the explora-
tion of a large river “said to fall into the sea some
miles to the south of Botany Bay, and of which there
was no indication on Captain Cook’s chart.” This
attempt was less successful than the first. The party
ran short of water and unfavourable weather prevented
a landing. Bass swam ashore with a cask and
tried to swim back with it partly filled. While the
attempt was being made a large breaker rolled the boat
into the surf and capsized her there. Soon afterwards
the three Englishmen were in difficulties with the
blacks, a tribe of whom they fell in with, and who
kept crowding round in constantly increasing numbers.
But with a ready resourcefulness which rarely failed
him in times of emergency, Flinders kept the savages
amused by cutting their hair and shaving their chins
while the gunpowder was dried. Ultimately the navi-
gators got away without a conflict taking place. The
boat was righted, water was procured, and the voyage
towards home was continued. But on the night of
March 29 only by a hair’s breadth were the lives saved
of the two young men destined to accomplish such big
feats in the completion of the map of the continent.
At ten o’clock an inky blackness enveloped the sea,
and was rendered all the more blinding by occasional
flashes of lightning as thunderstorms broke over the
hissing face of the sea. The periodical illumination
of the towering cliffs overhead and the booming of the
surf provided the only indications for shaping the course
of the boat. As the tiny cockleshell of a craft leaped
through the foaming waves, Bass sat in the stern hold-
ing the sheet of the sail in his hand, whilst Flinders
steered with an oar, and the boy was kept busy bailing
out the water which kept tumbling on board and
threatening to send them all to the bottom. Every
minute looked like their last. After running nearly an
hour with the waves breaking all round them, the
bewildered sailors were able to distinguish a line of
high breakers ahead. “It was necessary,” wrote
Flinders afterwards, “to determine on the instant what
was to be done, for our bark could not live ten minutes
longer. On coming to what appeared to be the
extiemity of the breakers, the boat’s head was brought


to the wind in a favourable moment, the mast and sail
taken down, and the oars got out. Pulling then
towards the reef, during the intervals of the heaviest
seas we found it to terminate in a point, and in three
minutes were in smooth water under its lee. A white
appearance further back kept us a short time in sus-
pense, but a nearer approach showed it to be the beach
of a well-sheltered cove, in which we anchored for the
rest of the night. So sudden a change from extreme
danger to comparatively perfect safety excited reflec-
tions which kept us some time awake. We thought
Providential Cove a well-adapted name for this place,
but by the natives, as we afterwards learned, it is
called ‘Watta-Mowlee.’ ” Some four miles to the
northward the party dis-
covered and named Port
Hacking. Three days later
the little craft was safe again
in Port Jackson.
Flinders set out on his
first voyage to the coast of
what now is Queensland on
July 8, 1799. Together with
Bass he had already achieved
conspicuous success as an ex-
plorer, the two having dis-
covered that Van Diemen
Land (Tasmania) was separ-
ated from the mainland by a
passage, which Governor
Hunter, at Flinders’ request,
named after Bass. Fli ders
embarked on his northern
expedition in the “Norfolk,”
a colonial sloop. Bass, having
returned to England, was un-
able to accompany him. The
enterprise had been instigated
by Flinders himself. He writes,
“His Excellency accepted a pro-
position to explore Glasshouse
and Hervey Bays, two large openings to the northward,
of which the entrances only were known. I had some
hope of finding a considerable river discharging itself
at one of these openings, and of being able by its means
to penetrate further into the interior of the country
than had hitherto been effected.” After a voyage of
eight days, during which Shoal Bay was discovered, the
“Norfolk” was brought to anchor in Moreton Bay. At
the southern point of Bribie Island the ship’s crew came
into contact with a party of blacks. The aborigines were
given presents, but they afterwards attacked the white
strangers, who, in self-defence, were compelled to fire,
which resulted in one of the assailants being wounded.
Flinders then sailed for some miles along the passage
between Bribie Island and the mainland, mistaking the
channel for the mouth of a river. On account of the
quantities of pumice-stone found the waterway was
called Pumice-stone River. Trouble had been experi-
enced from a leak the sloop had sprung, and when this
was temporarily repaired the vessel was headed further
up the bay, the anchor being cast at Redcliffe Point,
which then received its name. Owing to adverse winds
further investigation of the head of the bay was soon
abandoned, and the chance of discovering the Brisbane
River was thus lost. Flinders was anxious to per-
manently stop the leak in the ship, and after examining
six of the islands of Moreton Bay he again entered
“Pumice-stone River.” The
work being completed on a
sandy beach about seven
miles from the southernmost
point of Bribie River, the
“Norfolk,” on July 25, pro-
ceeded about two miles further
up the “river.” Next morn-
ing Flinders landed, and,
accompanied by a native
named Bongaree and two
sailors, he set off in the
direction of Glasshouse Moun-
tains. The nearest of these
peaks was reached on July 27,
after a laborious walk over
stony ground and through
swamps, but the hill had been
approached on an almost
perpendicular side, which
baffled all efforts at ascent,
and the party returned to the
sloop the same evening. The
ship was then turned in a
northerly direction. Further
communication was established
with the natives, who were
found to be friendly, and were described as being
evidently of the same race as those at Port Jackson
though speaking a different language which Bongaree
could not understand. They caught fish almost wholly
with cast and setting nets, they lived in much better
dwellings than did those of the south, and they congre-
gated more into society, altogether being of a superior
type. Their spears were of solid wood, but they were
hurled without the throwing-stick, which natives else-
where were in the habit of using. Several bark canoes
were seen. Flinders judged from the number of black
swans seen and from the fact that eighteen of the birds
were caught by the party in one small boat, that the

blacks were not dexterous in the management of either
spears or canoes.
The six weeks allowed to Flinders by the authorities
for his cruise were now threatening to draw to their close
before the work set out upon had been completed. On the
last day of the month he left Moreton (then called Glass-
house) Bay. The entrance is described in his journal
as containing so many shoals that a ship would have
much difficulty in finding a passage. “The long slip
[of land] on the east side [of the bay]/’ he writes,
“I have called Moreton Island, supposing it had
received that name from Captain Cook.” He did
not know of its insularity, it being little else than a
ridge of rocky hills with a sandy surface; but the
peninsula further south had some appearance of fer-
tility. We then find some inconsistency between the
two narratives written by Flinders of the voyage. In
his journal, written when the impressions he formed
of what he saw were fresh upon his mind, he appears
to have left the locality with a fairly open mind as to
what further investigations of the locality might bring
forth. But fifteen years afterwards, when writing of
this expedition to Moreton and Hervey Bays, he said:
—“I must acknowledge myself to have been disap-
pointed in not being able to penetrate into the interior
of New South Wales by either of the openings examined
on this expedition; but however mortifying the convic-
tion might be, it was then an ascertained fact that no
river of importance intersected the east coast between
the 24th and 39th degrees of South latitude.” Else-
where in the later volume he says:—“l judged favour-
ably of the country on the borders of what seemed to
be a river falling into the head of the bay, both from
its thick covering of wood and from the good soil of
the sixth island [probably St. Helena] which lies at
the entrance.” No doubt the discrepancy between the
points of view formed at the different times was due
to fallibility of memory; but it is somewhat remarkable
that an observer usually so accurate, as well as so care-
ful in the judgment he formed, should have fallen into
so sweeping a generalization on data so slender as then
was available as the quoted expression of opinion con-
tains. Fifteen days had been spent in Moreton Bay. The
incomplete nature of the information obtained was due
to the handicaps under which the explorer was labour-
ing. His ship was small and leaky and was possessed
of a crew of only eight men, whilst the whole voyage
had been limited to a duration of a month and a half,
a full week of which had to be occupied in removing
the cargo from the vessel, beaching her, and patching
her timbers. Moreover, the winds had proved un-
favourable to the expedition. Had a little more enter-
prise been displayed by the authorities at Sydney
probably the Brisbane River would have been dis-
covered, for so far as the poor means at his disposal
would allow him Flinders spared no pains in investigat-
ing the port of the future Queensland capital.
On August 16 the “Norfolk” entered Hervey Bay.
The examination of the inlet necessarily was hurried.
“The wind being off the land,” wrote Flinders in his
journal, “we followed the line of the coast upwards as
close as the shoals would allow, and before noon entered
an opening formed by the western shore on one side
and an island of moderate height, three or four miles
long, on the other. The opening was not more than
two miles wide, and was still further contracted by a
low islet in the middle, surrounded with shallow
banks.” He describes the place as rocky and sandy
and found it much frequented by aquatic birds, from
which fact the name of Curlew Islet was bestowed.
The discovery of a small shield and three wooden spears
yielded evidence of the spot being sometimes visited by
men. The “Norfolk” reached Port Jackson again on
August 20.
The warship “Reliance,” which Governor Hunter
had brought with him to New South Wales, was
ordered to return to England shortly after the voyage
of Flinders to Moreton Bay. On the arrival of the
“Reliance” in home waters charts of the new dis-
coveries were published, and the Imperial Government
sanctioned a plan for a further voyage of exploration,
with Flinders in command.
Although carried out at the command of the
British Government, the equipment of the expedition
by which Flinders was to “complete the investigation
of the coasts of Terra Australis,” left very much to be
desired. An ancient and unsound sloop, the “Xeno-
phon,” was refitted and renamed “The Investigator.”
Flinders says the best he can of her in the following
words: —“The ‘lnvestigator'’ was a north-country
built ship of 334 tons, and in form nearly resembled
the description of the vessel recommended by Captain
Cook as best calculated for voyages of discovery. She
had been purchased some years before into His
Majesty’s service, and having been newly coppered and
repaired was considered to be the best vessel which
could at that time be spared for the projected voyage
to Terra Australis.” In reality the ship was so un-
sound as to be quite unsuitable for the purpose. Nor
was the “Lady Nelson,” which was then lying at
Sydney and was to be placed under the command of
Flinders as tender to the “Investigator,” any better
than the larger ship. By the direction and under the
personal supervision of Flinders, who was then pro-
moted to the rank of commander, the “Investigator”
was refitted before leaving England. A special crew
was selected. Those already attached to the ship who
were aged or did not volunteer for the special duty
on hand were discharged, and their places were filled
with able young men selected from about 250 belonging

to the warship “Zealand” who offered their services for
the Australian enterprise. Several scientific men were
engaged to accompany the party, and the East India
Company voted £6OO as an allowance to the scientists
and officers, with the promise of a similar payment on
completion of the voyage. The company of the “In-
vestigator” totalled eighty-eight, including an astrono-
mer, a natural history painter, a landscape painter, a
gardener, and a miner.
On July 18,
1801, the “Investi-
gator” sailed from
Spithead. She was
off Cape Leeuwin
on December 7, and
from that point
Flinders surveyed
the coast on his way
to Port Jackson,
which he reached
on May 9, 1802.
The “Lady Nelson”
was lying at Syd-
ney, and was used
by Flinders during
part of the remain-
der of his voyage.
Some alterations
were mad© in the
crew of the “In-
vestigator.” The
crew of the “Lady
Nelson” was made
up mostly of con-
victs. Flinders had
taken with him
from England
enough salt beef to
last for eighteen
months, “knowing
how little reliance
could be placed on
the colony of New
South Wales for
that article.” He
also left an appli-
cation with the
Admiralty for twelve months’ supply to be sent after
him and lodged in the storehouses at Port Jackson for
the use of the expedition. These precautions appear
to have been justified by subsequent experiences. When
faced with the task of revictualling the party consider-
able difficulty was met with. The commander writes:
—“The price of fresh meat at Port Jackson was so
exorbitant, it was impossible to think of purchasing
REDUCED FAC-SIMILE OF SIR JOSEPH BANKS’ DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST LANDING
AT BOTANY.
it on the public account. I obtained one quarter of
beef for the ship’s company in exchange for salt meat,
and the Governor furnished us with some baskets of
vegetables from his garden. ... In purchasing a
sea stock for the cabin I paid £3 a head for sheep
weighing from 30 lb. to 40 lb. each when dressed.
Pigs were bought at 9d. per lb., weighed alive; geese
at 10s. each and fowls at 35.; and Indian corn for the
stock cost ss. a bushel. . . . From two American
vessels which arrived
I purchased 1,483
gallons of rum at
6s. 6d. per gallon,
which, with what
remained of our
former stock, was
a proportion for
twelve months.”
Additions were re-
quired to the crew
of the “Investiga-
tor.” Eight officers
and men had been
lost in an accident
with a boat at the
entrance of Spencer
Gulf during the
voyage from Eng-
land; a man bitten
by a seal at Kan-
garoo Island had
to be discharged,
whilst a marine was
invalided. There
had been a pre-
vious deficiency of
four in the comple-
ment, so that four-
teen men were
required to make
up the requisite
number. Six free
men were obtained,
but as no others
could be procured
the Governor was
requested to supply
eight convicts. The request was willingly complied with,
and the picked prisoners taken on board by Flinders were
promised complete or conditional pardons on the ter-
mination of the voyage, according to the recommenda-
tions of the commander. The native Bongaree, who
had previously accompanied Flinders, was taken with
the “Investigator.” Another black, named Nanbaree,
was also included in the expedition.


After having spent two and a half months at Port
Jackson, Flinders set sail for the north on July 22,
1802. Fie appointed Hervey Bay as a rendezvous for
the "Lady Nelson.” Moreton Bay and Port Curtis
were passed without any further investigations being
attempted at either of those places, but a landing was
made at Sandy Cape. By means of the aid of Bongaree
Flinders here entered into communication with a tribe
of blacks, though Bongaree was unable to understand
the use of their language nor they of his. Presents
were exchanged, and Flinders describes the natives as
closely resembling those of Port Jackson, though being
more fleshy, which he ascribes to their being able to
obtain a better supply of food with scoop nets. The
ship left Hervey Bay on August 1, and three days later
passed Mount Larcom, which was named in honour of
Captain Larcom, of the Navy, The discovery of Port
Curtis then fell to the lot of Flinders, the opening to
this inlet having been overlooked by Captain Cook
when he passed in the “Endeavour.” Three days were
occupied in examining the locality. In describing the
land Flinders wrote;—“The country round Port Curtis
is overspread with grass, and produces the eucalyptus
and other trees common to this coast; yet the soil is
either sandy or covered with loose stones and generally
incapable of cultivation. Much of the shores of the
low islands are overspread with mangroves of three
different species, but that which sends down roots, or,
rather, supporters, from the branches and interweaves
so closely as to be almost impenetrable, was the most
common. This species, the Rhizophora Mango of
Linnaeus, is also the most abundant in the West and
East Indies, but it is not found at Port Jackson nor
upon the southern coast of this country. Granite, stroked
red and black and cracked in all directions, appeared
to be the common stone in the upper parts of the port,
but a stratified argillaceous stone was not infrequent,
and upon the larger island, lying off the point of Hill
View, there was a softish white earth, which I took to
be calcareous until it was tried with acids and did not
produce any effervescence. Traces of the inhabitants
were found upon all the shores where we landed, but
the natives kept out of sight after the little skirmish
on the first day of our arrival; they subsist partly on
turtle, and possess bark canoes and scoop nets. We
saw three turtles lying on the water, but were not so
fortunate as to procure any. Fish seemed to be plenti-
ful, and some were speared by Bongaree, who was a
constant attendant in my boat, and yet our efforts with
the same were altogether unsuccessful. The shores
abound with oysters, among which, in the upper parts
of the port, was the kind producing pearls, but being
smaller and discoloured they were of no value. The
attempts made near the ship with the dredge to procure
large oysters from the deep water were without success.
I saw no quadrupeds in the woods, and almost no birds;
but there were some pelicans, gulls, and curlews about
the shores of the northern entrance; and at the point of
Hill View I met with some water in holes ; but that which
best merits the attention of a ship is the rill found by
Mr. Murray at the back of the small beach within
Gatcombe Head.” On getting under sail it was found
that an arm had broken off the anchor “in consequence
of a flaw extending two-thirds through the iron.”
Flinders remarks that under other circumstances the
fault might have resulted in the loss of the ship and
her company. But this illustration of negligence was
only the beginning of a long series of similarly dis-
comforting revelations.
The voyage had continued northward for but a
short distance when a stop was made at Keppel Bay.
The object of delaying here was to explore two openings
marked by Cook, and one of which was considered as
possibly being the mouth of a river leading into the
interior of the continent. A party landed, and from the
top of an eminence which they called Sea Hill the men
were able to command a fine view of the surrounding
country and some distance of coastline. In four places
the water was found to penetrate the land for a short
distance; but on the western side of the bay, where there
were two islands, the expanse of land-locked water was
more extensive, whilst the hills in that locality were
seen to be of sufficient elevation to afford a comprehen-
sive view of the neighbourhood for miles around. This
induced Flinders to set out with the “Lady Nelson”
and the whaleboat to examine the western arm, whilst
the botanists remained with the “Investigator” to
make their investigations within her neighbourhood.
Other portions of the bay were explored also, and
during one night a party, including Flinders, slept on
shore. The latter experiment was not repeated, Flin-
ders’ description of the result giving an obviously mild
account of the discomfort suffered. “A little further
on we landed for the night,” he wrote, “cutting a path
through the mangroves to a higher part of the northern
shore, but the swmrms of mosquitoes and sand flies made
sleeping impossible to all except one of the boat’s crew,
who was so enviably constituted that these insects either
did not attack him or could not penetrate his skin.”
The land exploration was greatly impeded by the
density of vegetation. Attempts to climb to the top
of South Hill, which is anything but a lofty eminence,
proved fruitless because of the sides being so thickly
clothed with trees and shrubs, bound together and
intertwisted with strong creepers. Flinders remarks
that it would have been perhaps easier to have climbed
up the trees and scrambled from one to another along
the vines than to have penetrated through the intricate
network in the darkness underneath. In the swamps
about South Hill the party came across quantities of a


small fish, which leaped about on land upon two strong
breast fins. These fish were first seen by Captain Cook on
the shores of Thirsty Sound. Another creature to
excite attention was the small red crab, having one claw
nearly as large as the body, which it keeps erect and
open so long as there is any expectation of danger.
An encounter with natives, attended by results of
a nature hardly to have been expected, took place on
Sunday, August 16. Part of the ship’s company
was allowed to go ashore abreast of the ship, as no
natives had been seen there. Towards evening, how-
ever, about twenty of the blacks were observed in
company with the sailors. They had been fallen in
with near Cape Keppel, and although at first brandish-
ing their spears they had become quite friendly upon
finding that their warlike demonstrations were not
reciprocated. At sundown a master’s mate and a
Presents were liberally bestowed upon the natives and
a friendly interview followed, after which the aborigines
plunged again into their native jungle and the boat put
back to the ship. Flinders describes the natives as
being stout, muscular men, who seemed to understand
bartering better than most or perhaps any of the people
the ship’s company had hitherto come into contact with
in Australia. He mentions a hard tumour upon the
outer bone of the wrist of members of the tribe. The
same growth had been noticed in the case of the natives
at Hervey Bay. It was considered to have been caused
by the manner of throwing the fishing nets, which prob-
ably formed the principal method of obtaining food.
Flinders sailed out of Keppel Bay on August 17.
On the resumption of the voyage northward the
explorers, during the succeeding few days, passed
numerous small islands, but none of them was of

seaman were found to* be missing, no sign of them being
obtained until morning. Later on the next day they
reappeared, having been lost in a muddy swamp among
mangroves several miles away. In this exceedingly
unenviable position, preyed on by clouds of mosquitoes,
they were forced to spend all the hours of darkness,
and next morning on extricating themselves they fell
in with a tribe of natives, who surrounded them and
carried them off to where a fire was kept continuously
burning. The intentions of the savages proved to be
far from hostile. A couple of ducks were cooked and
the white men were well fed, after which they were
required to undergo a close personal inspection. Then
they were carefully escorted back to the ship. The
party on board the “Investigator” saw the tribe
approaching the shore with the lost sailors in their
midst, and a boat was put off to meet the wanderers.
H
attractive appearance. “At the back of the islands,”
wrote Flinders, “the main coast is low and sandy, with
the exception of two or three rocky heads; but a few
miles inland there is a chain of hills, moderately
elevated and not ill-clothed with wocd. These hills
are a continuation of the same which I had ascended
on the west side of Keppel Bay, and extend as far as
the two peaks behind Cape Manifold.” In point of
fact, the worst features of the land were seen by the
explorers. When landings had been effected solid
ground was reached only after wading waist deep in
slush and then hewing a way through dense mangroves,
which almost everywhere bordered the water in the inlets.
Only short distances would be penetrated inland, and
they rarely departed far from the neighbourhood of the
shore. Thus the most sandy and inferior parts of the
land were investigated and the better descriptions not


reached. The landscape, as viewed from the ship when
sailing northward, contained most of the unpromising
aspects, whilst the real potentialities of the continent
were hidden from sight.
On passing Cape Manifold Flinders observed trees
resembling the pines of Norfolk Island on Hervey Isles.
Similar pines, which afterwards turned out not to be
identical with the species alluded to, were found on
adjacent islands also. On August 21 Port Bowen and
Cape Clinton were discovered. The former was named
by Flinders after Captain James Bowen, commander of
the Naval forces at Madeira, and the latter after
Colonel Clinton, who commanded the land forces at the
same place. Advantage was here taken of the oppor-
tunity afforded for patching up the “Lady Nelson,”
which had met with an accident by striking the bottom
earlier in the voyage. A boat was sent to the north
side of the bay with the scientific members of the party.
Another was despatched to haul the fishing net at a
small beach in front of a gully between two hills. “A
third boat,” wrote Flinders, “was sent to Entrance
Island with the carpenter to cut pine logs for various
purposes, but principally to make a main sliding keel
for the ‘Lady Nelson.’ Our little consort sailed indif-
ferently at the best, but since the main keel had been
carried away at Facing Island it was unsafe to trust her
on a lee shore, even in moderate weather.” Such was
the vessel deemed adequate by the British Government
to accompany the half-rotten “Investigator,” with the
part object of rendering aid, should it be needed, to
that vessel in unknown regions far from the courses of
ships and remote from possibilities of outside assistance.
The fishing enterprise proved successful, and abund-
ance of fresh water was discovered, with the result that
Flinders decided to thoroughly examine the port. The
pines cut for use were considered by the carpenter
to be superior to those of Norway, both for spars and
planks; but of the country Flinders does not speak
highly. It was generally, he says, either sandy or
stony, and unfit for cultivation. But of the timber
generally he refers in terms of praise, whilst the valleys
about Cape Clinton were found to be clothed with fairly
good grass. “No inhabitants were seen,” records the
narrative, “but in every part where I [Flinders] landed
fires had been made and the woods of Cape Clinton were
then burning; the natives had also been to Entrance
Island, which implied them to have canoes, although
none were seen. There are kangaroos in the woods;
hawks and the bald-headed mocking-bird of Port
Jackson are common; and ducks, sea-pies, and gulls
frequent the shoals at low-water. Fish are more
abundant here than in any port before visited; those
taken in the seine at the watering beach were prin-
cipally mullet, but sharks and flying fish were
numerous.” Departure was taken on August 24.
Owing to lack of wind little progress was made
from the entrance of Port Bowen during the 24th and
25th. On the latter date Flinders, together with some
of the scientists, landed on one of the islets of the
neighbourhood, and observations were made of the
plants and species of animals. Towards evening the
party fell in with two natives in a canoe. By the fol-
lowing day the voyage had been continued, and a land-
ing was effected at the entrance of Shoal-water Bay,
and Leicester Island received its name. A hill was
ascended on the mainland and a commanding view
obtained of both sea and land. The eminence Flinders
named Mount Westall. The land about this spot is
described as being very stony. Pines were growing in
the gullies. The lower hills were covered with grass
and trees, as also was the low land. The soil here was
found to be shallow and sandy. The trees mostly be-
longed to the eucalyptus family. No natives and only
one kangaroo were seen at this landing. But while
Flinders was away collecting this information the
naturalist and others had taken the launch to the west
side of the bay. Here they had an interview with
sixteen blacks, who were peaceable but appeared hungry
and apparently belonged to a lower type than those of
Keppel and Hervey Bays. They used bark canoes,
better secured at the ends than were those of Port
Jackson, whilst their spears were neatly pointed with
pieces of quartz. These weapons were used for striking
turtles, which, together with shellfish and roots, seemed
to form their sole means of subsistence. The land near
the upper parts of the bay was described as being low
for two or three miles back from the shore, and then
to rise ridge over ridge until reaching a considerable
elevation. The hills were well-covered with pines and
other trees and the soil of the valleys better than at
Mount Westall, on the opposite side of the bay. While
near Pine Mount, which was ascended in order to secure
a view, which, however, was not obtained on account
of the forest cutting off the field of vision, the naturalist
and a party with him became lost in chasing a kangaroo
and were forced to spend the night on shore, though
they were rescued on the following morning. On Sep-
tember 4 the expedition left Shoal-water Bay, which
had been painstakingly surveyed. In describing the
place, Flinders wrote: —“Speaking in general terms of
Shoal-water Bay, I do not conceive it to offer any
advantages to ships which may not be had upon almost
any other part of the coast, except that the tide rises
higher and in the winter season fish are more plentiful
than further to the south. No fresh water was found
unless at a distance from the shore, and then only in
small quantities. Pine trees are plentiful, but they
grow on the stony hills at a distance from the water side
and cannot be procured with anything like the facility
offered by Port Bowen.”


At Shoal-water Bay, as elsewhere within the
tropics, Flinders kept a sharp look-out for any traces
which might exist of the fate of the last expedition of
La Perouse, who with his little fleet of ships had sailed
out of Port Jackson a few weeks after the arrival of
Governor Phillips with the first Australian settlement
in 1788, and had never afterwards been seen or authen-
tically heard of by civilized men. “At every port or
bay we entered,” wrote Flinders, “more especially after
passing Cape Capricorn, my first object on landing was
to examine the refuse thrown up by the sea. The
French navigator, La Perouse, whose unfortunate exist-
ence—if in existence—was always present to my mind,
had been wrecked, as it was thought, somewhere in the
neighbourhood of New Caledonia, and if so remnants
of his ships were likely to be brought up on this coast
by the trade winds, and might indicate the situation
same purpose. The latter navigator had noticed un-
usual variations in the needle of the compass, which he
ascribed to the presence of iron ore in the hills of the
locality. Flinders found differences, but not so great
as those which had puzzled his predecessor. Pie says,
“There are here no difficulties equal to those
found by Cook, but it is to be observed that he used a
ship’s azimuth compass, probably not raised further
from the ground than to be placed on a stone, whereas
my theodolite stood upon legs more than four feet
high.” He formed the deduction that the attraction
was rather dispersed throughout the mass of stone com-
posing Pier Head than that any mine of iron ore
existed in it. On September 8 the “Investigator” and
the “Lady Nelson” quitted Thirsty Sound and dropped
anchor in Broad Sound on the same day.
The first noteworthy discovery at Broad Sound was
ABBOTT STREET. CAIRNS.
of the reef or island which had proved fatal to him.
With such an indication I was led to believe in the
possibility of finding the place, and although the hope
of restoring La Perouse or any of his companions to
their country and friends could not after so many years
rationally be entertained, yet to gain some certain
knowledge of their fate would do away with the pain
of suspense, and it might not be too late to retrieve
some documents of their discoveries.”
The day after leaving Shoal-water Bay the expedi-
tion reached Thirsty Sound. Here the botanists landed
on the mainland, whilst the launch was despatched in
another direction with a large fishing net. Flinders
himself ascended Pier Plead, and from there he took
bearings of portion of the Northumberland Islands, as
well as of hills and points of the coast of the mainland.
Captain Cook had been at the top of Pier Head for the
h 2
that the tide rose 32 feet. This was destined to bear
more than passing interest, as the water being shallow
the “Lady Nelson” became caught by the falling waters
with her main sliding keel down and without sufficient
depth to float her. The crazy little craft had been
fitted with these sliding keels because they were sup-
posed to add to her sailing value. On previously strik-
ing the bottom, as already mentioned, a new sliding
keel had been made at Port Bowen. At Broad Sound
the “Lady Nelson” first snapped off part of the after
keel. Later in the day, when it was decided to anchor
for the night and the tide was running out, the new
main keel was found to have so swollen from the action
of the water as to have become immovable. With the
ebb of the tide the ship was perched upon this unsub-
stantial piece of timber, like a vessel on a stilt. For a
considerable time she plunged violently backwards and


forwards, whilst dragging both anchors. Eventually,
to the great relief of all on board the “Lady Nelson,”
the sliding keel broke off short and the ship settled
easily in the mud, where she lay till the rising tide
floated her off. Nor was this the end of the trouble.
At low tide some of the crew went out upon the dry
flat and found one of the cables parted and the anchor
so far buried in the quicksand that it could not be
raised. The tide came rushing in six to eight inches
perpendicular and with a roaring noise. When the
water was deep enough Flinders, taking with him
Messrs. Brown and Lacy, set off in the whaleboat to
follow up a small channel in the eastern shore.
After proceeding up this channel for about six
miles the party found a place suitable for landing. So
great were the difficulties of reaching solid land that
this was regarded as an unusually fortunate circum-
stance. Three or four miles to the south were some
hills, which it was hoped might command a view of
the stream to its termination. As the day was still early
when the party had left the boat, a start was made the
same day for these points of vantage. Within the
immediate vicinity the country was a stiff clayey flat,
covered with grass, and apparently liable to be flooded
by spring tides, though at the time of the visit high-
water did not reach to within five feet of it. The grass
of the plain was interspersed with a sensitive plant, the
leaves of which curled up about the footsteps of the
travellers so that for some time afterwards their tracks
were distinguishable. A useful view of the neighbour-
hood was obtained from the hills, and by sundown the
party had reached its landing-place, where a tent
was pitched. But the night brought most disagreeable
experiences of mosquitoes, sand flies, and ants. Some
surprise can hardly be withheld from the daring way
in which members of the party were prepared to spend
hours of darkness in the midst of clouds of insects of
the tropical climate. At four o’clock in the morning
the tide had risen and an effort was made to return
to the ship, but owing to the shallow nature of the
channel the effort proved abortive. The men waited for
the following tide, but not without fears of being left
until the spring tides came on. However, in the after-
noon, after some trouble in negotiating the shoals, the
“Lady Nelson” was reached.
On returning to the ship Flinders found that a
party had decided to take a complete set of lunar obser-
vations in order to correct the longitude before continu-
ing the voyage to Cape York, and had permitted the
chronometers to run down. This involved a loss of
calculations which it would require a week to pick up
again, and in consequence Flinders set out for Thirsty
Sound with the object of utilizing the intervening time
in correcting some points in Cook’s chart. But on his
second return the chronometers had again been allowed
to run down. The repetition of so serious an oversight
as this might well have been expected to rouse the ire
of a commander himself so accurate and particular in
attending to every detail of the day’s work. Yet
Flinders tells of the omission in the following mild
words:—“On landing at the tents I found, to my no
less surprise than regret, that the timekeeper had again
been let down, and no more than one day’s rates had
since been obtained. Twenty-five sets of distances of
sun and moon had been taken to correspond with an
equal number on the opposite side, and it appeared that
Lieutenant Flinders, being intent upon these, had for-
gotten to wind up the timekeepers on the 22nd at
noon.’’
Whilst Flinders was on his investigations of the
neighbouring country, the “Lady Nelson” was laid on
shore for repairs. Two sheets of copper had been lost
from her, and the trunks of the sliding keels required
repairing. These sliding keels had caused endless
trouble. At that time, among sailors and shipbuilders,
they had come in for a good measure of popularity
by reason of the superior sailing qualities they were
believed to bestow; but they undoubtedly imposed a
source of danger to a ship carrying out such work as
that upon which the “Lady Nelson” was engaged.
Striking downwards from the bottom of the ship, almost
like inverted masts, they certainly could be drawn up
before water known to be too shallow to allow of their
use, but when sailing along a strange and unexplored
coastline, where the water was apt to suddenly shoal,
they introduced an element of danger any vessel would
have been better without. The repairs were left to the
care of Lieutenant Murray, who also was instructed to
procure sufficient wood to last during the remainder of
the voyage to Torres Strait.
Broad Sound was left on September 27. An
embarrassing position had arisen on account of the
clocks having been allowed to run down, but Flinders
was forced to select what he conceived to be the lesser
of two evils. “To go away to Torres Straits and the
Gulf of Carpentaria without good rates,” he wrote,
“was to cripple the accuracy of all our longitudes, and
on the other hand the expected approach of the con-
trary monsoon on the north coast admitted of no longer
delay in Broad Sound. On comparing the last day’s
rates with those of the four days previously obtained
the letting down did not appear to have produced any
material alteration, and I therefore determined to com-
bine the whole together and to sail immediately.”
Sunday, September 26, was occupied in completing
the filling of the holds with wood, taking on board the
shore establishment, and in making ready generally for
the continuation of the voyage.
On quitting Broad Sound Flinders steered for the
north-easternmost of the Northumberland Islands,


which had been marked by Captain Cook as a single
piece of land seen indistinctly, but which the com-
mander of the “Investigator” had already seen from
Mount ’VVestall to be a cluster of separate islands, and
Pier Head. The portion of the group to the north-
east, as it forms a distinct archipelago, Flinders named
Percy Isles. A landing was made on some of the
islands and fresh water obtained. The vegetation was
found to be thick and pine timber plentiful. The
scenery is spoken of in terms of praise. The largest of
the Percy Isles is described as being about thirteen miles
in circumference, and in its greatest elevation perhaps a
thousand feet above sea-level. Pines, fresh water, and
the orderless chaos of reefs running in various directions
and hidden by varying depths of water. Writing of
the Great Barrier at this first spot where he saw it,
Flinders says: —“The reefs were not dry in any part,
with the exception of some small black lumps, which at
a distance resembled the round heads of negroes; the
sea broke upon the edges, but within the water was
smooth and of a light-green colour.” Elsewhere he
writes:—“Different corals in a dead state concentrated
into a solid mass of a dull-white colour, composed the
stone of the reef. The negro heads were lumps which
stood higher than the rest, and being generally dry
were blackened by the weather; but even in these the
RUSSELL RIVER, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
fish, said Flinders, would offer some inducement to visit
the group, as might also the hump-backed whales, of
which a considerable number were seen in the locality.
Early on the morning of October 4 both vessels
got under weigh to resume the voyage to Torres
Strait. The expedition here found difficulties arising
from the Great Barrier Reef, which, before being pro-
perly charted, could hardly fail to bring perplexity to
any navigator who attempted either to find a channel
by means of which he could sail through the obstruc-
tion, or sought to spend some time in cruising within
the vicinity of the treacherous coral walls. The diffi-
culties and dangers of the locality were intensified by
forms of the different corals and some shells were dis-
tinguishable. The edges of the reef, but particularly on
the outside where the sea broke, were the highest parts;
within there were pools and holes containing live corals,
sponges, and sea eggs and cucumbers, and many enor-
mous cockles were scattered upon different parts of the
reef. At low-water this cockle seems most commonly
to lie half open, but frequently closes with much noise,
and the water within the shell then spouts up in a
stream, three or four feet high. It was from this noise
and the spouting of the water that we discovered them,
for in other respects they were scarcely to be distin-
guished from the coral rock.” And the beauties the


strange formations presented are described: —“A new
creation, but imitative of the old, was presented to our
view. We had wheat sheaves, mushrooms, staghorns,
cabbage leaves, and a variety of other forms glowing
under the water, with vivid tints of every shade, betwixt
green, purple, brown, and white, equalling in beauty
and excelling in grandeur the most favourite pasture
of the curious florist. There were different species of
coral and fungus growing, as it were, out of the solid
rock, and each had its peculiar shade of colouring. But
whilst contemplating the richness of the scene we could
not long forget with what destruction it was pregnant.”
Of the huge cockles Flinders refers to, several
were taken on board and stewed in coppers. But they
proved too rank to make agreeable food. One of them
weighed lb., whilst the fish inside, detached from
the shell, turned the scale at 3 lb. 2 oz. Flinders re-
marks that this size was much inferior to that found
by Cook and Bligh upon the reef further northward
and to several specimens in the British Museum.
Flinders himself also had seen them “more than four
times the weight of the above shell and fish taken
together.”
The first plan of Flinders was to cross through the
Barrier Reef and complete the voyage to Cape York in
open water. But to penetrate through the mass of
coral rock which runs for a thousand miles parallel to
the coast was a much more formidable undertaking than
the navigator calculated upon when beginning the
attempt. As Cook discovered, very nearly at the cost
of his ship and all the lives on board her, the channel
between the Barrier and the land is traversed by reefs
and shallows, varying in width from thirty to a hundred
miles. This waterway, though protected from very
much of the rough weather and heavy seas from the east-
ward, was perhaps one of the most dangerous spots to
be found for an explorer to sail upon, strange currents,
hidden rocks, abruptly-rising reefs, and violent hurri-
canes all combining to menace the ship of the navigator
who preceded the making of a chart.
After sighting the first of the reefs of the Barrier
system, Flinders bore away northwards, hoping to find
a passage through which he might reach the deep water
beyond. At times it looked as though this object might
be accomplished. The reefs were cut with many gullies,
and that some of these were large enough for a ship
to pass through had been established by the experiences
of Captain Cook. However, no sufficiently large open-
ing presented itself, whilst the network of coral rock
threatened to develop into a labyrinth from which it
might be impossible to disentangle the ships if pene-
trating too far among the broken walls of rock. Navi-
gation appeared to grow more difficult with each
succeeding day. Reef succeeded reef, and they passed
through channels often of the most forbidding aspect,
frequently being carried away from destruction, which
otherwise could not have been avoided, only by the
tidal currents racing through the openings like mill-
streams. “There were various small channels amongst
the reefs,” relates the narrative dealing with the time
of the first efforts to reach the open ocean, “some of
which led to the outer breakers, and through these the
tide was rushing in when we returned to the ship after
an excursion of discovery in a boat; but I could not
anywhere see an opening sufficiently wide for the
vessels. ... It was too late in the day to begin
following the line of the high breakers to the north-west-
ward; but we lifted the anchor to remove further from
the eastern reef, which was dry within a mile of the
ship. The wind was light at south-east, and in steering
westward, with a boat sounding ahead, we got into one
of the narrow streams of tide, which carried us rapidly
to the south-west, nor could the boat assist us across
so much was it twisted about by the whirlpools.” And
so for days the sensational experiences continued. Fre-
quently the violent currents threatened the ships with
quick destruction, so great being their force that cables
were snapped by their power and anchors lost, whilst
on one occasion “the tide was indeed running past the
brig at a fearful rate, and I [Flinders] feared it would
pass over our bows.” Eventually the loss of anchors,
coupled with a series of narrow escapes from shipwreck,
caused the commander of the expedition to abandon
the effort to reach the ocean by means of a narrow
channel. “My anxious desire to get out to sea,” he
wrote, “and reach the north coast before the unfavour-
able monsoon should set in had led me to persevere
amongst these intricate passages beyond what prudence
could approve, for had the wind come to blow strong no
anchors in such deep water and upon loose sand could
have held the ship; a rocky bottom cut the cables, and
to have been under sail in the night was certain destruc-
tion.”
A number of new islands of the Cumberland group
were discovered by Flinders on October 16, when the
total of them was made up to fifteen. The greater
number of these had not been seen by Cook. A landing
was made, and though no inhabitants were then on the
islands, evidences were numerous of the place having
been visited by blacks a few months earlier.
Up to this point the “Lady Nelson” had proved a
source of annoyance and anxiety. She sailed so
badly, and “became so leewardly since the loss of the
main and part of the after keel,” that she caused con-
tinued delay and ran grave risk of meeting with
destruction. “Instead of saving the crew of the ‘ln-
vestigator,’ in case of accident, which was one of the
principal objects of her attendance,” wrote the worried
commander, “it was too probable we might be called
upon to render her that assistance. A good vessel of


the same size I should have considered the greatest
acquisition in Torres Strait and the Gulf or Carpen-
taria; but circumstanced as was the ‘Lady Nelson,’
and in want of anchors and cables which could not be
spared without endangering our own safety, she was
become, and would be more so every day, a burthen
rather than an assistant to me.” The “Lady Nelson”
was consequently sent back to Port Jackson, and the
“Investigator” continued northward to pursue her dis-
coveries unaided by any other craft. A few days later
the trials of Flinders were still further added to by
the "Investigator” making water at the rate of about
five inches per hour.
On the evening of October 20 the “Investigator”
at last cleared the reefs, and before morning was riding
on the open ocean of unfathomable depth and with no
rocks in sight. This was in latitude a few miles south
whilst others would deliver their articles of exchange
without any distrust. Nor was the suspicion confined
to one side. Flinders had not forgotten that blacks
from the same islands had made an attack upon Provi-
dence and Assistant in 1792, nor that some of Bramp-
ton’s party had been cut off at Darnley Island, a few
miles away, in 1793. The marines consequently were
kept prepared for action and the big guns kept ready,
whilst an officer was detailed to watch closely the move-
ments of each canoe and those on board her whilst the
latter were in proximity to the “Investigator.”
Nothing in the nature of hostility took place, although
the men in the canoes were fully armed with bows and
arrows. As they left the ship it was noticed that the
craft of the blacks could be rowed considerably more
rapidly ihan could any of the boats of the white men.
One of the three canoes was moved by a narrow upright
GORDONVALE, ON THE CAIRNS RAILWAY, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
of where Innisfail now stands. The last reefs were out
of sight on the evening of the 21st, and the run to
Torres Strait was continued in comparative safety. On
October 29 the anchor was cast off Murray Islands.
On approaching the group the crew had its curiosity
aroused by a series of poles sticking out of the sea
between the islands. At first it was thought these
might be the masts of a fleet of canoes collected there,
but closer inspection showed that the poles had been
driven into a reef, apparently to serve some purpose
connected with fishing. No sooner had the “Investiga-
tor” come to a stop than between forty and fifty natives
in three outrigger canoes came from the shore. The
canoes did not approach close to the ship, but the crews,
by means of signs, showed they were anxious for barter.
A trade was soon commenced, though some of the blacks
obviously feared attack from the unexpected visitors,
sail set between two masts in the forepart. Next day-
seven canoes came from the land, and about twenty
natives boarded the “Investigator,” where harmonious
relations were soon established and remained uninter-
rupted until the departure of the ship a few hour's later.
The largest island of the group is described by Flinders
as only about two miles long and one broad, whilst the
two smaller isles seemed to be but single hills. The
population he estimated at about seven hundred, of
which nearly the whole belonged to the larger island.
The next day the ship reached the Cornwallis
Islands, half-way through Torres Strait, and on one
of which Flinders landed, though he found it little more
than a bank of sand upon a coral base. Yet it was
covered with shrubs and trees so thickly as in many
places to be impenetrable. The explorer found evi-
dences of blacks having occasionally visited the spot.


There being no water on the island the savages had
devised a remarkable expedient for obtaining it. Long
slips of bark were tied round the smooth stems of the
pandanus trees, and the loose ends were led into huge
cockle shells placed underneath. By these slips the rain
which ran down the branches and stem of the tree was con-
ducted into the shells and filled them at every consider-
able shower. As each shell would hold two or three
pints, forty or fifty of them placed in this way under
different trees would accumulate sufficient water to
serve the temporary needs of a substantial number of
men. A pair of these cockle shells, bleached in the
sun, was found to weigh 101 lb. Yet the shells were much
inferior in size to others seen afterwards by Flinders.
The island on which this interesting discovery was
made Flinders named Halfway Island. Its length was
not more than a mile, but it appeared to be growing
and its elevation to be increasing. The latter change
~ O
might be due to movement in the floor of the sea, or it
might have resulted from the constant working up by
the sea of debris, as well as the piling up by the waves
of broken pieces of coral. Charles Darwin and others
have pointed out that, as birds deposit seeds on a coral
island, trees take root and, afterwards falling, decay on
the ground and thus form soil suitable for supporting
other vegetation. Thus from a reef covered with water
at every high tide a luxuriantly-clothed island literally
grows and becomes beautiful in the variety of its tropi-
cal forest and rich in bird and other animal life, which
have reached the ocean-encircled dot in devious ways,
from being blown by gales over hundreds of miles of
water till ultimately dropping exhausted upon the first
solid foothold offering, to clinging upon wave-tossed logs
during a stormy passage from the flooded mouth of some
mountain torrent of the glittering beach of coral regions.
The “Investigator” was anchored near the Prince
of Wales Islands on October 31. A landing was made
here, and what had been mistaken for the dwellings of
natives were found to be anthills—an error made several
times previously by other explorers of the Australian
coast. The voyage was continued southward past
Wallis Island, but owing to shallow water the course
had to be turned in more of a westerly direction, and
the ship was steered into the waters of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. The coast was sighted on November 4,
the land at that point being so low and sandy that it
could be seen from a few miles only. The ship could
not be brought to nearer than three miles from the
shore. This difficulty proved very disappointing. The
chart of the Gulf was incomplete and unreliable. No
part of the work Flinders had set out to accomplish
was more important than was that of filling the gaps
in existing knowledge of that part of the coast. The
opening into the Gulf was known, but what lay within
was shrouded in a mystery not made much clearer by
the later discoveries of Tasman. Flinders, in contra-
diction of the testimony of Dutch charts, inclined
to the belief that the mouth of the Gulf was the open-
ing to a long strip of water, which would lead him far
into the heart of the continent. Of the character of
the land which might be met with, even should the
inland sea be relatively small in dimensions, nothing
whatever was known definitely. Everything lay for
Flinders to explore. Little grounds are there for
wondering at the impatience of that enterprising navi-
gator at the irritating delays the Great Barrier Reef
had raised against his northerly progress.
A party landed on the mainland on November 7,
and even the whaleboat could be brought to the shore
only with difficulty. On the north side of an inlet
which the boat entered a gathering of natives was
sighted. Bongaree, naked and unarmed, attempted to
go among them, but although provided with spears they
did not reciprocate his advances. All efforts to bring
about a friendly interview failed, and Flinders did not
consider it would be safe for the botanists to begin col-
lecting in the vicinity of savages so suspicious, so in
consequence the crew rowed about a mile higher up,
where a landing was made at about noon on a green-
looking point on the same side. “In the upper parts of
the port” [inlet], wrote Flinders, “the country was
well-covered with wood, mostly eucalyptus; but near the
entrance it was little better than bare sand, with some
scattered trees of the casuarina and pandanus. A stone
of imperfectly concreted coral, sand, and shells formed
the basis. Footmarks of kangaroos were imprinted on
the sand and a dog was seen. Drupes of pandanus,
which had been sucked, lay in every direction and small
cockle shells were scattered on the beaches.” Other
efforts were made in this locality to establish relations
with the natives, but no success was achieved. “These
people were all naked,” says the narrative, “and in
colour, as in everything else, seemed to have a perfect
resemblance to the inhabitants of the east and south
coasts of Terra Australis. In Torres Strait bows and
arrows are the offensive weapons, but here we saw
spears only; each man has several in his hand, and
something which was supposed to be a throwing-stick.”
On November 8 Flinders passed a point which he
named the “Duyphen,” after the Dutch ship which had
passed there in 1606, but which had missed sighting
that particular landmark. Two days later the “Inves-
tigator” was opposite Cape Kurweer, where the
“Duyphen” had turned back. After this point had been
passed, the land was even more uninteresting and
flat than it had been before. At the point where the
Dutch charts showed the Vereenigde River, Flinders
could find no opening, and he says that stream certainly
had no existence. The subsequent discovery of creeks
in the neighbourhood, however, has cast doubt upon the


accuracy of some of the rather hasty deductions of the
British navigator. On November 13 the water was so
shallow that Flinders was obliged to keep so far out
that the tops of the trees were all that was visible of
the land, even from the masthead. And yet the sound-
ings showed only from three to four fathoms of water.
This difficulty continued, in a more or less marked
extent, to handicap the observations of the coast.
Flinders comments on the Dutch for having inserted in
their charts streams which did not exist. The truth of
the matter was that they could not possibly be seen
from the deck or even from the masthead of the
Investigator.” Moreover, a habit of keen observation
of features of the shore did not rank among the strong
points of the commander of the “Investigator.” This
was shown by the number of rivers on the east coast of
the continent that he jessed without observing.
portion he named Inspection Hill. Arrangements were
made here to look for a suitable spot for filling up the
ship’s hold and to caulk her.
Setting out on November 19 to explore the sur-
rounding coastline, Flinders discovered and named
Bentinck Island, in honour of Lord William Bentinck,
who was Governor of Madras. Other smaller islands
were also discovered in the immediate neighbourhood.
Among these was Allen Isle, Flinders tried to sail
round the latter in the whaleboat, but was prevented
from doing so by an impassable reef. While the
botanists were pursuing investigations on Allen Isle,
Flinders went eastward to a smaller island, two miles
off, where several blacks were seen. The water was too
shallow to permit of the boat approaching near to the
savages, but Flinders and his companions walked after
three blacks who were dragging six small rafts towards
VIEW ON THE CAIRNS-BABINDA RAILWAY, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
A change was found to occur in the direction of the
coastline on November 14, a bend to the westward then
taking place. This provided evidence in support of the
accuracy of the old Dutch charts, against believing in
which Flinders appears to have been biassed, and it also
discounted the theory of the Gulf being the beginning
of a strip of water running far into the interior of the
continent. Three days later an island was discovered,
with the outline standing against the horizon in pleasing
contrast to the monotonous flatness of more than 500
miles of land. At first the elevation was mistaken for
a mainland hill, so near was it to the shore. The same
error had been committed by the Dutch two centuries
earlier, when they named the narrow passage between
the eminence and the shore Maatsuyker River. On
discovering that the so-called river was not a stream,
Flinders called the island Sweers, whilst the raised
the extreme northern rocks, where other aborigines were
sitting. The men would not abandon their rafts, and
an interview thus becoming unavoidable they left the
water for the shore, and with their spears ready for
use they awaited the approach of their strange white
visitors. One of the latter then advanced unarmed,
and signs were made that the blacks should lay down
their spears. The signals they interpreted as a request
that they should sit down, and they acted on the sup-
posed suggestion. By degrees a friendly intercourse
was established. The natives accepted some presents,
and in return they gave the white men “two very rude
spears and a womerah, or throwing-stick, of neaxdy the
same form as those used by the natives of Port Jackson.”
“The rafts,’’ explains Flinders, “consisted of several
straight branches of mangrove, very much dried, and
lashed together in two places, with the largest ends one


way, so as to form a broad part and the smaller ends
closing to a point. Near the broad end was a bunch of
grass, where the man sits to paddle ; but the raft, with her
weight alone, must swim very deep, and indeed I should
scarcely have supposed it could float a man at all. Upon
one of these rafts was a short net, which, from the size
of the meshes, was probably intended to catch turtle;
upon another was a young shark. These, with their
paddles and spears, seemed to constitute the whole of
their -worldly riches. Two of the three men were
advanced in years, and from the resemblance of features
■were probably brothers. With the exception of two
chiefs at Tahiti, these were the tallest Indians I have
ever seen. They were not remarkable for being either
stout or slender, though like most of the Australians
their legs did not bear the European proportion to the
size of their heads and bodies. The third native was
not so tall as the other two, and he was, according to
our notions, better proportioned. Their features did
not differ much from those of their countrymen of the
south and east coasts, but they had each of them lost
two front teeth from the upper jaw. Their hair was
short, though not curly, and a fillet of network, which
the youngest man had wrapped round his head, was the
sole ornament or clothing seen amongst them. The two
old men appeared, to my surprise, to have undergone
circumcision.”
After they had been about five minutes together
the old men proposed that the visitors should go to the
latters’ boat, and on this being agreed to the blacks
escorted the white men thither hand in hand. This
apparently was a design to get the strangers at a further
distance from three black women sitting on some rocks.
Flinders complied with the desires of the savages, not
wishing to annoy them. The island is described as
between one and two miles long, and it received the
name of Horse-shoe Island, from its shape. No huts
could be found on the place, but dried grass spread
around fireplaces indicated where the savages were in
the habit of sleeping. Near these camping-places were
several large spiral shells, probably used for carrying
water from the mainland. The same evening Flinders,
on returning to the ship, resolved to return to between
Bentinck and Sweers Islands and there remain until
the necessary caulking should be completed. On
November 23 the “Investigator” anchored within two
cable lengths of the west side of the latter island, and
the work was commenced. An abundant supply of
fresh water had already been discovered near at hand.
No sooner was the task of caulking the ship com-
menced than the discovery of rotten places in the hull
began. ‘‘The carpenters proceeded in their work of
caulking,” wrote Flinders, ‘‘but as they advanced
report after report was brought to me of rotten places
found in different parts of the ship—in the planks,
bends, timbers, tree-nails, etc., until it became quite
alarming. I therefore directed the master and carpen-
ter to make a regular examination into all such essential
parts as could be done without delaying the service,
and to give me an official report thereon, with answers
to certain queries put to them.” Two days were spent
on the examination, which practically found the vessel
rotten from stem to stern. After reporting on numer-
ous details, in which the verdict was nearly always the
same, the master and carpenter gave the following
answers to four specific question's put to them by
Flinders—•
“(1) The ship having before made ten inches of
water an hour in a common fresh breeze, we judge from
that, and what we have now seen, that a little labouring
would employ two pumps, and that in a strong gale,
with much sea running, the ship would hardly escape
foundering; so that we think she is totally unfit to
encounter much bad weather.
“(2) We have no doubt but that if the ship should
get on a shore under any unfavourable circumstances
she would immediately go to pieces; but with a soft
bottom and smooth water she might touch for a short
time without any worse consequences than to another
ship, if she did not heel much; but, altogether, we
judge it to be much more dangerous for her to get
aground in her present state than if she were sound.
“(3) It is our opinion that the ship could not bear
heaving down on any account, and that laying her on
shore might so far strain her as to start the copper and
butt ends, which would make her unable to swim with-
out vast repair.
“(4) Mr. Aken [the master of the “Investigator”]
has known several ships of the same kind and built at
the same place as the ‘lnvestigator,’ and has always
found that when they begin to rot they went on very
fast. From the state to which the ship seems now to
be advanced it is our joint opinion that in twelve
months there will scarcely be a sound timber in her;
but that if she remain in fine weather and happen no
accident she may run six months longer without much
risk.”
The effect on the commander of this astounding
revelation to some degree may be imagined. “I cannot
express the surprise and sorrow which this statment
gave me,” he wrote. He was forced to admit a return
to Port Jackson to be almost immediately necessary to
secure the journals and charts of the examinations
already made, as well as to preserve the lives of the
ship’s company. Yet this course meant the abandon-
ment of a project on which Flinders for months had
concentrated his whole being, hoping “to make so accur-
ate an investigation of the shores of Terra Australis
that no future voyage to this country should be neces-
sary.” It had been his intention to sail so near the


coast as always to keep the surf in view, so that no
opening or other important feature could be passed
unobserved. Only when shallowness of water or direc-
tion of wind made such a plan too dangerous to follow
had he temporarily departed from it. ‘‘But when
circumstances were favourable such was the plan I pur-
sued, and, with the blessing of God, nothing of import-
ance should have been left for future discovei ■ers upon
any part of these extensive coasts; but with a ship
incapable of encountering bad weather; which could not
be repaired if sustaining injury from any of the numer-
ous shoals or rocks upon the coast; which, if constant
fine weather could be ensured and all accidents avoided,
winter’s passage along the south coast, and if not to
make for the nearest port in the East Indies. Flinders,
in the account of his voyage, does not give way to
criticism of the Admiralty for sending an exploring
party to spend perhaps years in fighting unknown
dangers in a vessel fitted only to soon become little better
than a floating coffin. But the published facts are more
eloquent than criticism could be made. On November
29 the ship was so far patched up that anchor was
weighed and the voyage resumed.
The discovery on these islands to excite most interest
amongst Flinders and his companions lay in relics of
civilization, too new to have been left by the Dutch

could not run more than six months—with such a ship
I knew not how to accomplish the task.”
But to return by any route to Port Jackson in so
crazy a craft presented no ordinary difficulties. To sail
round the east coast entailed passing through Torres
Strait, where stormy weather was to be expected at that
time of the year, besides which the route was beset with
other dangers from reefs. These considerations fortified
the strong desire Flinders still nourished to proceed by
the west, as hitherto planned, and to continue the survey
of the Gulf d uring the continuance of the north-west
monsoon, afterwards sailing by the west to Port Jackson,
if the ship should jmove capable of accomplishing a
explorers who had visited the place and yet obviously
having come from shipwrecked or visiting mariners.
Among a quantity of human skulls and other bones was
a piece of teak wood, which clearly had belonged to
a ship. Elsewhere were the stumps of trees which had
been felled with axes or other sharp metal instruments.
The fragments of a broken earthenware jar were also
found. Flinders at first thought that some ship from
the East Indies must have been wrecked in the Gulf
a few years before his visit. Some days elapsed before
the party discovered the real origin of these remains,
and by that time they had passed the 139th degree of
longitude, which now marks the division between


Queensland and the Northern Territory. Not only were
other traces found of axes having been used in felling
trees, but in chasms in the rocks of an island of the Gulf
were a number of rude drawings made with charcoal
and something like red paint. The figures represented
porpoises, turtles, kangaroos, and a human hand. Else-
where the natives gave unmistakable evidence of having
seen firearms used. At the time of the completion of
the examination of the Gulf the mystery was partly
cleared up. On leaving the narrow passage between
Cape Wilberforce and Bromby Islands, the “Investi-
gator” sighted a craft which was first taken for a
Chinese vessel, and which certainly was full of men.
Nearer approach revealed the stranger to be not alone.
The sight of six strange Asiatic ships, all of them prob-
ably pirates, and thousands of miles from civilization,
did not promise any reduction of the dangers besetting
Flinders. With much caution, and prepared for attack,
the “Investigator” drew nearer to the strangers. The
whaleboat, under the command of Lieutenant Flinders,
and with all hands fully armed, was sent to the
foreigners to open up an interview. The aliens proved
to be Malays from Macassar, and shortly afterwards the
six captains came on board the British ship. The cook
of the latter fortunately happened to be a Malay, and
through this interpreter a conversation was held. The
chief of the six was an elderly man named Pobasso. He
said there were on the Australian coast sixty vessels
similar to those just seen. The object of the visits,
which it was the custom to periodically repeat, was to
obtain supplies of a marine creature named trepang,
which was sold to the Chinese. Pobasso said he had
made six or seven voyages to the north coast of Australia
within the preceding twenty years, having been one of
the first to come. Never before had he encountered any
ship there. The great quantities of trepang then to
be found on the shore certainly indicated that the fishery
could not have been worked very long.
Bountiful Island was so named because of the large
quantity of turtles and turtle eggs obtained. This was
one of the Wellesley Islands. A bird about the size of
the ordinary domestic fowl was very common on the
island, living on young turtles, which it devoured as
soon as the latter emerged from the egg and before being
able to reach the water. The sea was infested with
sharks, which also owed their numbers to the plentiful
turtle supply. About a week was spent by Flinders in
examining these islands, and he sailed away from them
on December 7, carrying off forty-six turtles, varying
in weight from 260 lb. to 300 lb. each. The “Investi-
gator” then passed outside the waters of what since has
become Queensland.
Up to this point Flinders had found the natives
timid and harmless. Of bows and arrows they had none,
and the spears they used were so heavy and clumsy as to
be of value only as defensive and not as offensive weapons.
But later he had reason to change his opinion of the
blacks of the northern regions, sudden and ferocious
attacks having been made on landing parties, as a result
of which it became necessary to shoot some of the savages
in self-defence.
Flinders reluctantly determined on March 6 to post-
pone the completion of his voyage of discovery, and to
return to have his ship made seaworthy or to obtain
another vessel. The south-east monsoon had then com-
menced, and it had become evident that the “Investi-
gator” could not remain afloat very much longer, even
if fine weather continued. Moreover, the crew was
suffering badly from scurvy. The Dutch Island of
Timor was reached on March 31, a stock of fresh provi-
sions being obtained there. These, however, did not
last long, and the lives of a number of the crew were
lost before Port Jackson was reached on June 9.
Flinders did not again proceed to sea in the
“Investigator,” but left Port Jackson for Torres Strait
on August 10, 1803, in the “Porpoise,” accompanied
by the “Bridgewater” and the “Cato.” The “Bridge-
water” was a large ship of 750 tons, belonging to the
East India Company. Disaster overtook the expedition
before reaching its destination, the “Porpoise” and
the “Cato” being totally lost on the Wreck Reef off
the east coast. The crews of the two ships managed to
reach the rocks at a point where they stood above high-
water mark; but for some unexplained reason Captain
E. H. Palmer, in the “Bridgewater,” sailed away,
leaving the unfortunate people to their fate. But little
did his cowardice avail him. After reaching Calcutta,
where he gave a false account of what had happened,
no doubt imagining that there would be no survivors
from his consorts and that the truth would never be
revealed, he sailed for England and his vessel was never
heard of again.
After the luckless crews had landed what provisions
they could procure, Flinders, together with thirteen
men, set out for Sydney in a cutter. Three sailors had
been drowned. The others were temporarily safe, for
sufficient stores had been secured to last for some months.
The wreck had occurred on August 17, and Flinders
left on the 26th. Four days later he landed at Moreton
Island to secure a fresh supply of water, and on Septem-
ber 8 the cutter entered Port Jackson. Application
was immediately made to Governor King to render
available what aid should be necessary to rescue the
marooned party. The request was complied with at
once, and the small schooners “Rolla,” “Cumberland,”
and “Francis” were placed at the disposal of Flinders,
who started on the return voyage thirteen days after
his arrival. On October 1, just forty-five days after he
had left, Flinders reached the reef, where the eighty
survivors were found safe. During their wait the party


on the rocks, having secured a quantity of tools and
timber from the wrecks, had constructed a cutter, which
they named the “Resource.”
Flinders did not return to Port Jackson from Wreck
Reef, but sailed for England in the “Cumberland,” ten
officers and men accompanying him. Of the rest of the
party, some returned to Port Jackson in the “Francis”
and the “Resource,” whilst others went to China in
the “Rolla.” The “Rolla” and the “Cumberland”
sailed in company until October 11, when the latter
turned toward Torres Strait and the ' Rolla” continued
on her way to Eastern Asia. On November 10 the
Cumberland reached the Island of Timor. From
Able to endure the hardship of strenuous adventure
without murmur, unflinching in danger, and cheerfully
facing years of the hardest work and continual personal
discomfort, the deadening result of enforced idleness
and cramped environment on a nature to whom strenu-
ous activity and ever-changing scene were as life, was
sufficient to break his heart and undermine his constitu-
tion. Rut even after his belated liberation his troubles
were not ended, though the adventures through which
he had to pass before reaching his native land were less
likely permanently to harm his physical health than was
imprisonment. He was two years in making his way
to England. By then the ambition on which he had set

there Flinders sailed for Mauritius, and on December
17, 1803, be entered Port Louis. Then occurred one of
the saddest incidents in the annals of Australian
explorers. The French officer in charge of the place
refused to accept the papers of Flinders as genuine. The
ship was seized and Flinders himself was thrown into
prison, where he was kept in captivity for nearly seven
years. The only excuse to be offered for this inhuman
conduct was that France and England at the time were
at war, and that possibly the Governor acted from
ignorance. He was an officer of the French Revolution.
The effect of this experience on a man of the tem-
perament of Matthew Flinders perhaps may be imagined.
his life was practically wrecked. Something like eight
years had been irretrievably wasted. He had hoped so
to explore the coast of the great southern continent that
no further voyage of discovery would have been neces-
sary. And his failure to accomplish this herculean task
was not due to any shortcoming of his. Had a Lord of
the Admiralty not been the indirect cause, through
misappropriating the funds of the Admiralty, of the
expedition being sent to sea in a vessel which proved
unseaworthy and rotten, the voyage would not have
been abandoned, temporarily as poor Flinders thought,
in March, 1803, and the survey of the coast of the
Northern Territory and of the north and west of


Western Australia certainly would have been completed
in that year. Had it not been for the misfortune on
Wreck Reef a few months later the same work would
have been carried out with a delay of less than a
year ; and if he had not been imprisoned there is little
doubt that a man of the will-power of Flinders would
have broken through whatever reluctance or apathy
might have been opposed to him in Governmental circles
in the United Kingdom, had there been any, and that
he soon would have returned to finish the project so
dear to his heart. But as matters were, Matthew
Flinders, the second greatest of navigators who
have explored the Australian coast —second greatest
certainly in work actually achieved—died in London
in 1814, on the day of the publication of the book
describing his voyages.
Although a combination of hostile circumstances
had prevented Flinders from carrying out the full plan
actuating him from the time he left England in com-
mand of the “Investigator,” what he achieved was the
more important part of the intended work. Until he
sailed there the coastline of the Gulf of Carpentaria was
veiled in mystery. It is true that the old Dutch charts
of that region were found by him to be approximately
correct in the rough outlines they gave. But before his
examination there was no certainty as to whether any
credence could be given to these documents. And along
the east coast of what is now Queensland he was able to
fill in a wealth of detail omitted by Cook. The data
collected by him, and by those he took with him, of
the flora, fauna, and the natives of the new regions
he visited were also of the highest scientific value. The
voyage of the leaky old "Investigator,” with her rotten
timbers and the prospect of foundering she held out to
all who were in her, in charge of this indomitable sailor,
continually aspiring to penetrate to where civilized man
had never been, and actuated always by a natural love
for worthily doing a worthy work, certainly marked the
beginning of a new epoch in the development of Aus-
tralian territory.
CHAPTER III.
EXPEDITION OF BURKE AND WILLS.
No story of Australian exploration has excited so
much public interest as has the record of the ill-
starred expedition which left Melbourne on August 20,
1860, to find a way northward, through the western
divisions of New South Wales and Queensland, to the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. No similar enter-
prise had started on its journey under circumstances
apparently auguring so well for success; certainly none
before had been so well equipped. For months before
the first day of its journey the attention of the southern
colony had concentrated upon the undertaking, and
on the day of departure from Royal Park, where a
stone memorial now marks the spot of the gathering,
many of the population of the metropolis assembled to
see the novel cavalcade file out upon the Sydney road
opposite the present site of the University and troop away
to the north. For the first time camels were being used
for purposes of Australian exploration. Neither money
nor trouble had been spared in providing for every
conceivable requirement. The staff included, beside
Burke (the leader), a doctor who was a botanist, a sur-
veyor and astronomical observer, and an artist who was
also a naturalist and a geologist. The total expenditure
to date had been £12,400, whilst more was absorbed at
later dates. Friendly competition between the colonies
in the inauguration of exploring expeditions had played
no small part in spurring on the Parliament and people
of Victoria in fitting out the party. Hitherto
Victoria, owing partly to the narrow confines of her
own territory, had done relatively little in emulat-
ing her sister colonies in collecting knowledge of the
continent’s arid interior. The lavishness with which
preparations had been made for the success of the
Burke and Wills enterprise, it was hoped, would
remove from the reputation of the most densely-peopled
colony the stigma of apathy towards the scientific
investigation of Australia’s secrets.
If providing far less geographical information than
had been hoped for, the expedition was unique in the
complete record it furnished of the long and tragic
struggle of the misguided but brave leaders against a
lingering and painful death. When, in various parts
of the world, exploring parties have met with a fate
similar to that overtaking three of the four who
attempted the dash from Cooper Creek to the Gulf and
back again, it usually has happened that no more than
the barest traces have been left to indicate the nature
and locality of the final tragedy; whilst in instances
such as those of Leichhardt onlythe most slender and most
doubtful evidence ever throws a vestige of light upon
the darkness with which the unfortunate explorers have
been enveloped. But the sufferings of Burke, Wills,
and Gray were described in a diary written by them-
selves each day for so long as sufficient strength stayed
with them to permit the enfeebled fingers to hold pencil
and paper, whilst the full story of their adventures was


told by their companion, King. Of the doings of the
complete party, so ill-advisedly divided, before the
hazardous portion of the work was begun, and so in-
judiciously led from the outset, every detail has been
preserved, down to the last words of Burke, scrawled as
farewell to all mankind while he lay dying alone in the
heart of the desert;—“King has behaved nobly. He
has stayed with me to the last, and placed the pistol in
my hand, leaving me lying on the surface, as I wished.
R. O’H. Burke, Cooper Creek, June the 28th.” The
unhappy explorer may have displayed faults of judg-
ment; of heart he showed none. Staring into the jaws
of death, the paramount thought of his fevered brain
and clearer thinking, become abundantly apparent.
Love for adventure and unusual courage were
strong in the blood of Robert O’Hara Burke. His
father, James Hardimen Burke, had held a commission
in the army, and was present with the 7th Royal
Fusiliers at the capture of the islands of Martinique and
Guadaloupe. The explorer’s eldest brother won dis-
tinction and promotion in the Crimean War, and saw
active service elsewhere, whilst another brother was the
first British officer killed by the Russians at the conflict
just referred to. So conspicuous was the gallantry of
the latter that the circumstance is worthy of quotation
here as evidence of the kind of stuff inborn in the
SURPRISE CREEK, NORTHERN QUEENSLAND.
was to leave words exonerating his companion, should
any vagary of fortune twist the latter’s absence from
his leader, during the last sad hours of the latter, into
evidence of disloyalty. What the diary and notes of
those who perished have failed to reveal was easily filled
in by King, whose survival appears to have been due
to his capacity for digesting the seeds upon which the
blacks were able to subsist, but which proved fatal to
the other three white men. From the narrative thus
afforded, the safety and ease with which the journey
to the Gulf and back could have been accomplished,
with the facilities available to Burke and his fol-
lowers, had the plans been based on wider experience
make-up of him who was destined to lose his life in the
interest of Australian geographical research. The fol-
lowing is from Russell’s “History of the Crimean
War”:—“When he first leaped on shore from the
boat, six soldiers charged him. Two he shot with his
revolver, one he cut down with his sword, and the
rest turned and fled. While he was encouraednsr the
o o
Turks who were in the stream to row quietly to the
land, and forming them in a line as they disembarked,
conspicuous as he was in full uniform and by his white
cap cover, a number of riflemen advanced from behind
a ditch and took deliberate aim at him. He charged them
with headlong gallantry, and as he got near was struck


by a ball, which broke his jawbone; but he rushed on,
shot three men dead at close quarters, and cleft two
others through helmet and all into the brain with his
sword. He was then surrounded, and while engaged
in cutting his way with heroic courage through the
ranks of the enemy a sabre cut from behind nearly
severed his head from his body, and he fell dead, covered
with wounds, of which thirty-three, consisting of sabre
gashes, lance and bayonet thrusts, blows from the
butts of muskets, and bullet holes, were afterwards
found on his body.” Such was the stock from which
Robert O’Hara Burke had sprung. He was the
youngest of three brothers.
Young Burke was born in 1821, and he commenced
his career as a cadet of the Woolwich Academy; but
the latter he left in order to pursue a higher course of
studies in Belgium. Later he entered the Austrian
Army as cadet in the 7th Reuss Regiment of Hungarian
Hussars, soon afterwards obtaining his lieutenancy. After
quitting that service he secured an appointment in the
Irish Constabulary, where he was so beloved by the men
that when he emigrated to Australia several of them
followed him to the antipodes. Nor were these the
only people drawn to Australia by the attraction and
charm of young Burke’s personality. His old nurse,
when sixty-five years of age, spent the accumulated
savings of her life in sailing across the world in order that,
before she died, she might see the man she had tended
in his childhood. When she arrived the object of her
affections had gone forth upon the expedition from
which he was not to return alive, and the longed-for
meeting never took place. But the case appealed to
the public sympathy and the Government of Victoria
made adequate provision for the comfortable support
of the old lady during her remaining years. Burke
came to Australia in 1853, and was just forty years old
when setting out upon his last undertaking.
Burke was certainly the wrong man to be selected
for the post. Not only did he lack the requisite tech-
nical knowledge of the class of enterprise on hand, but
by temperament he was net cut out for leadership.
Under direction, his inherent courage and self-sacrificing
devotion to duty would have proved invaluable to any
party about to fight physical difficulties and face danger;
but his judgment was hasty and he was unable to
estimate the nature of obstacles ahead. He was easily
imposed on by unscrupulous men, and his military
training had intensified a natural tendency to act
entirely from' his own initiative, whereas the lives of
himself and others would have been saved had he sought
more of the counsel of those in positions subordinate to
his own, but richer in specialized knowledge. He was
not seasoned in constitution to the hardships of bush
life, nor was he versed in that instinctive familiarity of
the bush derived only from years of experience, and
indispensable to the traveller across any of the conti-
nent’s unknown wilds. Also he was without that
administrative ability manifesting itself in a painstaking
solicitation of detail and never-relaxing supervision over
others. G. J. Landells, who was appointed to take
charge of the camels and to be second in command to
Burke, ultimately did not accompany the expedition,
and the responsibility of his office fell upon the
shoulders of young William John Wills.
Mr. Wills, who was twenty-six years old when the
party started from Melbourne, had originally been
placed third in command, his selection being mainly due
to his scientific attainments, astronomy and meteorology
having specially attracted his attention, whilst he had
distinguished himself at chemistry when studying
medicine at St. Bartholomew’s, his father being a
medical practitioner. Wills possessed most of those
mental qualities so sadly lacking in the case of poor
Burke. Being possessed of a mind scientific both by
training and nature, he reached conclusions by care-
ful reasoning, where his leader would take them at
jumps. He was slow and collected, where Burke was
quick and impulsive. The tragedy of the contrast
between the two men lay in that, had it been less sharp,
the peculiarities of the one would have balanced those
of the other. Burke was over-confident in his own
opinions, whilst Wills, with the caution and scepticism
characteristic of the mind soaked in science, proved
strangely reticent in offering counsel to his leader.
Difference in age provided no adequate reason for Wills
not more freely offering to the service of his superior
officer, towards whom he stood on the best of personal
terms, a judgment so obviously needed by the latter.
The key to the relationship between the two men, in the
direction of the expedition, must be found in the remark
of Mr. Wills, sen., to Burke, when they parted in
Melbourne. The elder man then said:—“lf it were in
my power, I would even now prevent his (Mr. Wills,
jun.) going. If he knew what I am about to say, he
would not, I think, be well pleased; but if you ever
happen to want my son’s advice or opinion, you must
ask for it, for he will never offer it unasked. No
matter what course you may adopt, he will follow
without remonstrance or murmur.” Young Wills was
deficient in ordinary egoism. But had the positions held
by the two men been reversed there can be little doubt
a happier ending would have been achieved.
The initiation of the expedition originated from
an offer of £I,OOO by Mr. Ambrose Kyte. The object
was the crossing of the continent from south to north.
Burke and Wills achieved this end in five months, three
weeks, and one day, though they died before they could
reach aid on the return journey. By private subscrip-
tions obtained through a committee of the Royal Society
of Victoria, a further sum of £2,400 was obtained. The

Government spent £3,000 in purchasing camels from
India for the purposes of the enterprise, whilst Parlia-
ment granted a further £6,000. Thus was raised an
initial total of £12,400.
To organize the expedition, the original committee
of the Royal Society was augmented by another com-
mittee termed the Exploration Fund Committee. A
joint board was formed from the two, with the Chief
Justice (Sir M illiam Stawell) as chairman. The expe-
ditionary staff, as set out in the memorandum of agree-
ment between those gentlemen and the exploration
committee, and dated August 18, 1860, was as fol-
lows :
Robert O’Hara Burke, leader.
George James Landells, in charge of the camels,
second in command.
When selecting the leader, the committee did not
first approach Burke. Mr. Augustus Gregory, Sur-
veyor-General of Queensland, who had won fame as an
explorer in Western Australia, after declining the posi-
tion himself, recommended Major Warburton, well
known as a successful explorer in South Australia, and
head of the police in that colony. But the committee
did not fall in with this suggestion, a good deal of
jealousy existing between the colonies, and South Aus-
tralia being suspected of desiring the exploration of the
desert country within its own borders before that of the
sister colonies. A great many volunteers offered their
services as leader of the expedition, and Burke received
his appointment through being selected from among these.
G. J. Landells was appointed second in command
and manager of the camels, partly on account of his know-

members of the party were unfamiliar. He had brought
twenty-four camels from Peshawar for the purposes of
the enterprise. These comprised animals of both the
fast and the heavy varieties. Altogether Burke took
with him twenty-six camels and twenty-eight horses.
William John Wills held undoubted claims for
being included. His scientific attainments promised to
prove of the utmost service in adding to the value of the
discoveries which might be made.
The ceremony of despatching the expedition from
Melbourne on the fateful August 20 was unique in the
history of that city. Never before or since has so
strange and motley a procession wended its way through
the trim suburban streets and past the conventional
villas of the outskirts. So dense was the crowd at
Royal Park that but a small proportion of the crowd


could hear the farewell speech of the Mayor, or the brief
but well-chosen reply of Burke. The start was made
from near the present entrance to the Zoological
Gardens. Hundreds of citizens on horseback and in
vehicles accompanied the cavalcade as it trooped through
Brunswick and Coburg to the open plains of Campbell-
field. Great excitement prevailed among the people
who were appealed to by the romance of the under-
taking, coupled with the strange spectacular effect of
the oriental-like equipment, with the men fitted out to
withstand a tropical heat, the camels laden with stores
enough for months, and Burke astride of his prancing
grey at the head—all of which went to give the appear-
ance of some caravan about to cross an Asiatic or
African desert. To outward show, the expedition
seemed constructed with sufficient foresight to be able
to march across Australia and back without haste,
anxiety, or distress to anyone. So far as the expendi-
ture of money and material went, that impression would
have been true. But a vital ingredient was absent—
competent leadership.
Across Victoria and for some distance on the north
side of the Murray the progress was slow but pleasant
and harmonious. The equipment was so elaborate that
hasty travelling was not practicable; but speed was un-
essential. Balranald was reached on September 17.
Then began the long series of misunderstandings, quar-
rellings, and blundering which was not to cease, in one
form or another, until the leaders should have breathed
their last in the interior desert. At Balranald Burke
was obliged to dismiss Ferguson for insubordination.
Then trouble arose between Burke and Landells. The
latter expressed discontent at the interference of Burke
in the management of the camels. The culminating
point was reached when Burke ordered that rum, which
Landells had brought for the use of the camels, should
be left behind. This decision directly arose from a
complaint made by a squatter named McPherson, at
whose homestead they stayed, and who said the liquor
had caused his shearers to become drunk. Rum was
stated to be a common remedy for certain diseases to
which camels were prone in India. Other disputes arose,
and both men appeared to have completely lost com-
mand of their tempers, the result being that Landells
resigned. The latter was not without sympathizers, and
his resignation was followed by that of Dr. Becker, who
openly protested at the treatment accorded to the second
in command, and declared that the party was not safe
without the technical skill in managing the camels which
Landells alone possessed. This rupture was most unfor-
tunate, robbing the party of so much specialized know-
ledge of the kind most particularly required by men
engaged in such an enterprise. On his return to Mel-
bourne, Landells certainly did not spare his words in
criticizing the man with whom he had fallen out, freely
expressing the conviction that under his leadership the
expedition would be attended by the most disastrous
results, and even going so far as to accuse Burke of
being a violent man, with whom he (Landells) did not
consider himself safe in a tent at night.
Burke promoted Wills to fill the post rendered
vacant by the resignation of Landells. Harmony always
prevailed between the two now filling the most
important posts. Apparently this arose from the
natural loyalty of Wills to whoever he was called upon
to serve in a subordinate position, and to his own tact.
Then Burke fell into a hideous bungle, which was more
directly the cause than was any other single factor, in
bringing about the tragedy which cost his own and other
lives. At a station called “Kinchica” he encountered
a man named Wright, who was the manager. Wright
appears to have worked upon the warm, impulsive
sympathies of Burke, and when he applied for the
appointment of third in command of the expedition he
was appointed. This man was without knowledge, and
allegations have been made to the effect that he
desired to join the party in order to serve his own ends
in spying out land suitable for pastoral purposes, so
that he might benefit certain squatters with whom he
was co-operating. At a public meeting held in Mel-
bourne on January 21, 1863, Dr. Macadam said;
“Wright has employed his time in serving the interests
of the squatters by going in search of land, instead of
doing his duty to the man whose life was in his hands.”
This and similar statements were left unchallenged by
Wright or by the squatters referred to. The “Mel-
bourne Committee of Inquiry” found in its report that
“to the misconduct of Wright is mainly attributable
the whole of the disasters of the expedition, with the
exception of the death of Gray.” This was the man
whom, on his appointment, before having opportunity
to learn more of his capacity, Burke left in charge of
eight men, ten camels, thirteen horses, and the main part
of the stores, with instructions to follow the rest of the
expedition, which pushed on ahead under Burke himself.
Cooper Creek was reached on November 11. Wills,
who provided the best account of the country between
the Darling and there, thought but poorly of the inter-
vening territory. The region was mostly quite flat, and
the few trees found showed signs, by the shapes into
which they were bent, of having been subjected
periodically to hurricanes of great violence. The district
he believed to be auriferous. Permanent water was
very scarce, but it was found on the Wonominta Ranges,
which were from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea-level.
Fine and temperate weather accompanied the party
during this portion of the journey. At Cooper Creek
they established what came to be known as “Camp 63,”
and they remained there until December 5, when they
were driven out by a plague of rats. A move was then


made to “Camp 65,” where a permanent depot was
formed. The natural pastures about the latter were
such that as soon as they began to feel the benefit of
the rest the horses and camels started to gain in con-
dition; but flies, mosquitoes, and rats combined in
making the locality anything but pleasant for men to
spend the hot summer weather in.
While at camps 63 and 65 several excursions were
made to the surrounding country, and considerable diffi-
culty was experienced in finding water to the northward.
On one of these expeditions, Wills and McDonough had
the misfortune to lose three camels, which they had
taken with them. The two men had penetrated ninety
miles from the depot, and were almost without water,
their bags having leaked. The camels were much done
up with travelling, and they were let loose at nightfall
without being hobbled. The animals very quickly dis-
appeared into the darkness, and becoming alarmed the
two men set out in search of them. Though they con-
tinued walking until midnight the camels were not seen
again. Thus were Wills and his companion stranded in
the midst of an unknown desert, nearly a hundred miles
from human aid, and with no knowledge of water lying
along the route. They were afraid even to light a
fire, because of the possibility of attracting the atten-
tions of hostile blacks. At dawn they walked fifteen
miles to a rise, from which they had hoped to see some-
thing of the missing camels; but the search proved
fruitless and served only to use up some of the reserves
of the men’s strength. McDonogh wrote of the experi-
ence in the following terms:—“We walked back
to our camp. We had a little bread and water. We
did not like to light a fire for fear of the blacks, so
we made up our swag. I had a large Colt’s revolver
and thirty-five pints of water in a goat-skin bag. Mr.
Wills had three or four Johnny cakes, a Trench’s
revolver, and a pocket compass. We proceeded towards
Cooper Creek, and in about seven or eight miles found
a large pool of stagnant water, from which we drank a
great deal and filled the goat-skin bag. We then pro-
ceeded, walking eight hours and resting four, until we
reached the creek. The last night we camped we had
no water, as the bag leaked, and Mr. Wills and myself
were very much done up in consequence of carrying it.”
Wills was obliged to afterwards return in company with
King to the spot from which the camels had been lost,
in order to recover the saddles and other equipment
that had been left there.
CHAPTER IV.
THE FATAL DASH.
During the early part of December Burke decided
to make a dash to the northward so as to reach the
shores of Carpentaria, and in a despatch dated the
13th of that month he announced this decision to the
committee which had organized the expedition. The
plan was for Burke himself, accompanied by Wills,
King, and Gray, to form an advance exploring party.
They were to take six camels and one horse with them.
Brahe was to remain in charge at Cooper Creek, and
not to leave until Burke’s party returned or provisions
ran short. With Brahe were Baton, McDonogh,
Dost Mahommed, twelve horses, and six camels.
Wright had been left at Menindie two months before.
His instructions had been to follow, and he was daily
expected to arrive at Cooper Creek. With him were
eight men, ten camels, thirteen horses, and the greater
part of the stores. The advance exploring party, which
was to make its dash for the northern coast, took the
“jerked” flesh of two horses. One of the animals had
been killed for the purpose. The other had broken a
leg later, and the creature thus being rendered useless
had been shot and the carcase turned to food.
In his despatch Burke stated that from what they
had already ascertained he was satisfied no practical
i 2
route to the north lay between Gregory’s and Sturt’s
tracks, except in the rainy season, or possibly by sinking
wells. The natives had evidently recently abandoned
that region because of lack of water. He thought it
would be very desirable to establish the route to Cooper
Creek, and from Cooper Creek to the north, further to
the westward, as the eastern or upper part of the creek
ran through earthy plains which even at that time
were arid in fine weather and were very difficult to
travel on, whilst in times of rain they would be quite
impassable for horses or cattle. Referring to the
locality where Brahe’s party was left, Burke wrote:-
“The feed upon this creek is good, and the horses and
camels have greatly improved in condition.” The
leader left instructions for the officers in charge of the
party (Wright’s), which he says he expected would
shortly arrive there, to endeavour, during the absence
of the advance expedition, to find a better and
a shorter route between the depot (camp 65) and
Wright Creek, or between the depot and the Darling.
Writing on December 13, he says:—“l proceed on to-
morrow with the party to Eyre Creek, and from thence
I shall endeavour to explore the country to the north of
it in the direction of Carpentaria, and it is my intention


to return here within the next three months at latest.”
Again, referring to the depot where Brahe was to re-
main, he says: —“The feed is very good. There is no
danger to be apprehended from the natives if they are
properly managed, and there is, therefore, nothing to
prevent the party remaining here until our return, or
until the provisions run short.” A few days later
Burke, having fallen into the initial blunder of unneces-
sarily dividing his expedition into two parts at
Menindie, again divided it at Cooper Creek, he himself,
accompanied by three others, plunging into the dark
wilds of Central Australia—ill-equipped and relying on
a base at Cooper Creek, which itself relied on the
arrival of Wright, who seems to have ignored both the
specific instructions given to him and consideration of
the lives of the men dependent on him for the aid they
were justified in supposing he would have rendered
available. That Burke erred badly in not bringing on
the whole party from Menindie there can be no gain-
saying, but that fatal results would in all human prob-
ability have been avoided if Wright had properly dis-
charged his duties is equally clear.
The error of Burke at Menindie had not ended with
the mere division of forces. To make matters worse
he took Wright with him for 150 miles of the way to
Cooper Creek. Therefore the rear party could not move
until its leader had traversed a distance of 300 miles.
Simultaneously with the return to Menindie of Wright
and - two natives who had accompanied him, a
trooper named Lyons appeared with a despatch from
the Exploration Committee giving information of the
interior of the continent obtained by Mr. Stuart, who
had just reached to nearly 18 degrees latitude south.
Lyons refused to hand the document over to anyone but
Burke himself. This was eight days after the depar-
ture of the advance party. Instead of hurrying the
whole of the forces under his control after Burke,
Wright chose McPherson, a saddler and horse-shoer,
who had been engaged after the expedition had left
Melbourne, and a native named Dick to accompany
Lyons in a race after the leader. This trio proved
utterly unfit for the task on hand. They not only lost
all traces of those ahead of them, but also of their own
way. Their horses became knocked up, and three of
the animals died from exhastion. The lives of the men
themselves were saved by a search party sent out to look
for them under the command of Dr. Beckler.
Burke had left Cooper Creek for the Gulf of Car-
pentaria on December 16, feeling fully confident that
Wright would appear at Brahe’s depot within the next
week or so at the latest. But so far from the mind of
Wright was the idea of bestirring himself that three
days after his leader had left Cooper Creek he was
despatching Mr. Hodgkinson to Melbourne to obtain
funds for the purchase of ten horses and 150 sheep.
This entailed a journey of nearly 500 miles each way.
Mr. Hodgkinson succeeded in reaching the capital of
Victoria in eleven days, and lest no time in procuring
a sum of £4OO, arriving back at Menindie on January
9, 1861. Yet, after having received this assistance,
Wright remained where he was until January 24,
though he did not attempt to buy any sheep, giving as
a reason that at that time of the year the grass was all
burned up and they consequently would not be able to
travel over the arid interior of the continent. The
party lost its way and never reached Cooper Creek,
from which, four months after he had taken up his
quarters there, Brahe was forced to retire on account of
provisions running short. Burke has been blamed for
not having blazed a track when passing over stony
ground upon which other marks of his having traversed
would not be left easily. But had Wright been an even
moderately competent bushman there is little doubt
that he could have reached his destination.
Burke’s dash to the Gulf formed but another of the
series of ghastly blunders by which that leader finally
lost the lives of himself and some of his gallant fol-
lowers. The four men (Burke, Wills, Gray, and King)
took with them six camels, a horse, and provisions for
twelve weeks. The distance to be covered was 600 miles
each way, making a total of 1,200 miles through an
unknown wilderness, which might be utterly water-
less and without feed for the horse and camels.
For such an exjiedition the equipment was quite
inadequate. Mr. William Howitt, in his book, “Dis-
coverv in Australia,” says it is probable from something
Burke said on the journey, that the latter was endeav-
ouring to emulate the explorer Stuart, who had covered
very long stretches of unknown country with small
parties. But Stuart always carried large supplies of
provisions, whereas Burke had with him a stock which
would meet the requirements only in the event of the
journey being rapid and impeded with no unexpected
difficulties, an expectation which was certainly not
justified in view of the circumstances. As to the
trip, Mr. Llowitt, whose son was sent out in charge of
a relief party, says:—“The transit was made, the great
enterprise accomplished, as by a splendid piece of
insanity. But though the crossing of the continent was
accomplished, no scientific objects were effected.” Dr.
Beckler, writing of the departure of the leader, states
that he kept back with him many of the scientific
instruments entrusted to his charge, alleging that
Burke, who was both unscientific and impatient of the
time lost in making and registering observations,
threatened to throw them into the next creek.
Necessarily the journey of Burke and his com-
panions to the north was foredoomed to be barren of
valuable scientific results. The provisions carried were
so small in quantity that the excursion could be no


other than a race with death, dixring which no time
would be available for observations to be takeix. Indeed,
though only equipped for three months, Burke some-
times spoke of the chance of not being able to return
under four months. He would acquire, should he sur-
vive, a superficial knowledge of the character of the
country through which he passed. Beyond that he
would be able to learn nothing.
The party started off hopefully enough. King
attended to the camels. The horse was led by Gray.
The latter soon became ill, and found it necessary to
ride the animal. Burke and Wills walked ahead,
guiding the expedition by aid of a pocket compass and
neighbourhood was well covered with grass and other
plants. Up to that point the region passed through had
impressed the travellers as being of the finest description
for pastoral purposes. The grass and saltbush were
everywhere abundant and water was plentiful, with
every appearance of permanence. The following two
days were spent in crossing Sturt’s Stony Desert, which
presented no difficulties and which Wills described as
being better grassed than many sheep runs. Christmas
Eve was occupied in resting at Gray Creek, which
appeared to the four men as a delightful oasis in the
wilderness. The place possessed the somewhat rare advan-
tage of being free from the many insect pests which had

selecting the camping-places for the nights. On the
first day the travellers fell in with a considerable tribe
of blacks, who pestered the white men to attend a dance
at the native camping-place. Ultimately it was neces-
sary to threaten to shoot them to keep them away.
Wills, in his diary, says: —“They are undoubtedly a
finer and better-looking race of men than the blacks on
the Murray and the Darling, and more peaceful, but
in other respects I believe they do not compare favour-
ably with them; they appear to be mean-spirited and
contemptible in every respect.” On the night of the
21st they camped beside what Wills called “a
splendid water-hole.” The country in the immediate
made life so uxxpleasant at other well-watered stopping-
places. On Christmas Day the journey was resuixxed
in the direction of Eyre Creek, and after about nine
miles had been traversed several small creeks were met
with, and ultimately a large creek, which was followed
up till December 30. This had been named Burke
Creek. The surrounding country consisted of sand
ridges and grassy plains. The watercourse being found
to trend too much to the east, the party, on the last-
named date, struck off to the north, where it found
ample grass and several creeks. After passing the
tropic the flora was found to increase in quantity and
variety. Wills writes of this region in the following


glowing terms:—“As we proceeded the country im-
proved at every step. Flocks of pigeons rose and flew
to the eastward, and fresh plants met our view at every
rise; everything was green and luxuriant. The horse
licked his lips and tried all he could to break his nose
strings to get at the feed, which was equal in quantity
and superior in variety to any that I have seen in
Australia, excepting, perhaps, in soils of volcanic
origin.”
Paton Creek was reached and crossed on January
11. For the next eight days travelling proved easy,
the flats being well grassed and water sufficiently plenti-
ful. Mounts Standish, Murray, and Forbes were
named, as also were Foster, Green, and Turner Creeks.
The men also came upon Cloncurry Creek. Sixteen days
later the party was on the banks either of the Cloncurry
or the Flinders River. It was here that one camel,
having been knocked up badly, had to be left behind.
Trouble was now being experienced with the stock.
Writing early in February, Wills describes the trials
of that period:—“Finding the ground in such a state
from the heavy falls of rain that the camels could
scarcely be got along, it was decided to leave them at
Camp 119 and for Mr. Burke and I to proceed towards
the sea on foot. After breakfast we accordingly
started, taking with us the horse and three days’ pro-
visions. Our first difficulty was in crossing Billy Creek,
which we had to do where it enters the river, a few
hundred yards below the camp. In getting the horse
in here he got bogged in a quicksand bank so deeply as
to be unable to stir, and we only succeeded in extricat-
ing him by undermining him on the creek side and then
lunging him into the water. Having got all the things
in safety we continued down the river bank, which
bent about from east to west, but kept a general north
course. A great deal of the land was so soft and rotten
that the horse, with only a saddle and about twenty-
five pounds on his back, could scarcely walk over it.
At a distance of about five miles we again had him
bogged in crossing a small creek, after which he seemed
so weak that we had great doubts about getting him
on.”
At that time of the year thunderstorms and heavy
rain were frequent in those tropical regions. But,
undaunted by every difficulty, and determined, when
so near the coast, to complete the task of crossing the
continent from south to north, the two men floundered
on through marshes, bogs, and forests until at last they
arrived at salt water. Then they knew they were on
the edge of the sea. But the sight of the blue water
was denied them. Everywhere creeks at that time of
year had opened out into mangrove swamps before
emptying into the Gulf. The c oast was so homo-
geneously flat that no eminence offered a view
of the surrounding landscape. Indeed, Burke and
Wills had reached so far north to where marsh merges
into open sea only by taking advantage of every little
ridge, which being a few feet higher than the surround-
ing country, offered something in the way of a firm
foothold for the men and their weakened horse. The
latter it was found impossible to take all the way, and
he was left at a camping-place to be picked up again on
the return journey.
About this part of the unfortunate enterprise the
notes are meagre, every other consideration having been
sacrificed to regard for speed. Provisions for twelve
weeks had been taken, and seven weeks had elapsed
already. The return became a race with starvation.
After having rejoined King and Gray, who had retained
the camels, the march homeward was commenced from
Camp 119 on February 13. The rain was then fre-
quently falling, and so heavy was the country for
travelling over that for a considerable period the party
was not able to cover more than four to five miles
per day. Almost as soon as a start had been made
it was found necessary to reduce the daily allowance
of food. What had been brought from Cooper Creek
was supplemented by native plants, which the blacks
partly subsisted on. In a short while it was found
necessary to kill three of the five remaining camels and
the horse, as they had all knocked up so completely as
to be unable to travel. The flesh of the animals was
preserved for the party to eat.
The first serious illness fell to the lot of Burke, and
was ascribed to his having eaten part of the flesh of a
large snake which the party had killed. From this
sickness, however, the leader recovered. On the 20th,
so great had become the need for increased speed, that
sixty pounds’ weight of things was left behind. Time
was being lost because the torrents of rain which by
this time were falling forced the party to think, not
always of which was the most direct route to its
destination, but which was the way offering the best
foothold, if leading only approximately in the required
direction. Gray was the first to complain of the effects
of the terrible ordeal. On the 25th Wills found him
hiding behind a tree eating flour which he had stolen
from the provisions. Wills sent Gray to report himself
to Burke. It was recollected that other supplies had
run short in an unexplained manner, and Burke gave
the man a thrashing, the latter protesting that he was
suffering from dysentery. This statement was not be-
lieved by the others, who thought the culprit was
malingering. That Gray was really ill became very
apparent at a later date. On April 8 a halt had to be
called in order to send back for him. He said he could
not walk, but again was not believed. Just nine days
later the poor fellow died. It is only fair to the other
three men to recollect that the miserable plight they
were in themselves must be taken as in a large measure


excusing what, under normal circumstances, would
amount to rather cruel treatment. The diary of
the expedition states that the deceased man had not
spoken a word distinctly since his first attack.
On April 21 the three survivors arrived at the
depot on Cooper Creek to find that Brahe had left a
few hours before. Only too apparent was the futility
of setting out in pursuit, for the party led by Brahe
would be well rested and would travel comparatively
fast, whilst Burke and his two companions could barely
walk at all. Writing that day, Wills says: —“Arrived
at the depot this evening, just in time to find it
deserted. A note left in the plant by Brahe communi-
cates the pleasing information that they have started
to-day for the Darling, their camels and horses all well
and in good condition. We and our camels, being just
done up and scarcely able to reach the depot, have very
one unfit for anything. Poor Gray must have suffered
very much many times when we thought him shamming.
It is most fortunate for us that these symptoms, which
early affected him, did not come on us until we were
reduced to an exclusively animal diet of such an inferior
description as a worn-out and exhausted horse. We
were not long in getting out the grub that Brahe had
left, and we made a good supper off some oatmeal
porridge and sugar. This, together with the excite-
ment of finding ourselves in such a peculiar and almost
unexpected position, had a wonderful effect in removing
the stiffness from our legs. Whether it is possible that
the vegetables have so affected me, I know not, but
both Mr. B. and I remarked a most decided relief and
a strength in the legs greater than we had had for
several days. lam inclined to think that but for the
abundance of portulaca that we obtained on our journey

little chance of overtaking them. Brahe has fortu-
nately left us ample provisions to take us to the bounds
of civilization—namely, flour, 50 lb.; rice, 20 lb.;
oatmeal, 60 lb.; sugar, 60 lb.; and dried meat, 15 lb.
These provisions, together with a few house-nails and
some castaway odds and ends, constitute all the articles
left, and place us in a very awkward position in regard
to clothing. Our disappointment at finding the depot
deserted may be easily imagined —returning in an
exhausted state, after four months of the severest
travelling and privation, our legs almost paralysed, so
that each of us found it a most trying task only to
walk a few yards. Such a leg-bound feeling I never
before experienced, and hope I never shall again. The
exertion to get up a slight piece of rising ground, even
without any load, induces an indescribable sensation of
pain and helplessness, and the general lassitude makes
we should scarcely have returned to Cooper Creek at
all.”
Under wise guidance the plight of the party would
have been far from hopeless. Had the men remained
where they were, a return party would have discovered
their plight before the stocks of provisions ran out. But,
of course, Burke, Wills, and King were not to know that
fact. On the other hand, they could have rested quietly
while they and their camels gathered strength, and then
have pushed on slowly to Menindie. But yet again did
Burke fall into error. Instead of taking the obviously
sane course of following the route they knew, and along
which they would be likely to meet some other detachment
of their own original party, or of some search party sent
out after them, the leader decided to break right away
from all probable travellers and to endeavour to reach a
station in South Australia by means of Mount Hopeless.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Even Wills, who usually followed the directions of his
leader without any comment, protested at this mad
decision. But ultimately the younger man yielded.
Nor was a substantial halt called to enable strength to
be regained before setting out to cross the sun-baked
aridity of the frightful desert they were about to enter.
They had arrived at the depot on Sunday, April 21,
and they set out again on Tuesday, April 23.
Before leaving, Burke left in the cache from which
the provisions had been taken the following memoran-
dum ;
“Depot No. 2, Cooper Creek, Camp 65.
“The return party from Carpentaria, consisting of
myself, Wills, and King (Gray dead), arrived here last
night, and found that the depot party had only started
on the same day. We proceed on to-morrow slowly
down the creek towards Adelaide, by Mount Hopeless,
and shall endeavour to follow Gregory’s track; but we
are very weak. The two camels are done up, and we
shall not be able to travel faster than four or five
miles a day. Gray died on the road from exhaustion
and fatigue. The provisions left here will, I think,
restore our strength. We have discovered a practical
route to Carpentaria, the chief position of which lies
along the 140° of E. long. There is some good country
between this and the Stony Desert. From thence to the
tropic the land is dry and stony. Between the tropic
and Carpentaria a considerable portion is rangy, but
is well-watered and richly grassed.
“We reached the shores of Carpentaria on the 11th
of February, 1861. Greatly disappointed at finding the
party here gone.
“R. O’Hara Burke, Leader.
“22nd April, 1861.
“P.S. —The camels cannot travel and we cannot
walk well, or we should follow the other party. We
shall move very slowly down the creek.”
For the first few days the travellers made their way
along the banks of the creek, and they seemed to im-
prove in strength. The natives proved very friendly,
often supplying the white men with fish. Burke
appears to have fallen into the blunder of thinking that
Mount Hopeless was only about 150 miles away. Not
long elapsed before the beginning of a long series of
disasters overtook the party. On the 28th one of the
camels became so badly bogged that in the animal’s
weak state all efforts to extricate it proved futile. The
beast was consequently shot, and as much of the flesh
as could be procured was dried. This entailed a delay
until May 1, when the remaining camel was loaded with
the most necessary and useful articles and another start
made.
But the solitary animal proved of little further use
to the forlorn travellers. The next day he showed signs of
knocking up. His load was therefore further lightened
to only a few pounds weight, the sugar, ginger, tea,
cocoa, and some tin plates being thrown away. But
these sacrifices were doomed to futility. After covering
the country in very short stages for six more days, the
beast one morning proved unable to rise to his legs,
even when no load was upon his back. Burke and
Wills then struck out on foot to reconnoitre. After
walking for eleven miles they fell in with some blacks,
who were fishing. The natives presented the white men
with half a dozen fish each for their luncheon, and
promised more if the latter would visit the camp. They
also presented the wanderers with stuff they called
bedgery, or pedgery, which Wills describes in his diary
as being highly intoxicating in its effect when chewed.
The plant from which this substance is procured is dealt
with in the article on “The Flora of Queensland”
appearing in this work. Three days later found Burke
and King employed jerking the flesh of the last camel,
which by that time had been shot, every effort at
reviving him having failed. Wills was away searching
for nardoo seed, which proved so important a factor in
providing subsistence for the natives, and with which
the white men had been supplementing their slender
and fast-disappearing stock of provisions. Wills was
not successful, but he found a large bean, which the
blacks called padlu. He describes it as boiling easily
and being very sweet when shelled.
On the following day Burke and King started down
the creek in search of the blacks, from whom it was
hoped to ascertain all particulars about the nardoo seed;
whilst Wills remained at the camp and continued the
meat-jerking process. Wills says he “must devise some
means for trapping the birds and rats, which is a
pleasant prospect after our dashing trip to Carpentaria,
having to hang about Cooper Creek living like the
blacks.” On the following day Burke and King re-
turned without having succeeded in locating the natives,
who had moved away from their old camp. Other
searches were made for the blacks, but with similarly
unsuccessful results. On May 16 the three explorers
planted the major portion of their things and started
up creek to where they knew there was a black’s camp
about eight miles away. But even the light loads they
carried proved too burdensome for men in so weakened
a condition, and a second plant had to be made, when
the camp was reached and found deserted. The men
were now determined to walk to Mount Hopeless.
But the next day a change was made in the plans.
While following a blacks’ path King caught sight of a
flat fairly covered with nardoo, and the three soon found
themselves in the midst of an abundant supply of this
seed. Wills wrote:—“This discovery caused somewhat
a revolution in our feelings, for we considered, with the
knowledge of this plant, we were in a position to sup-
port ourselves, even if we were destined to remain on


the creek and wait for assistance from town.” A week
later finds Wills complaining of the slowness and trouble
entailed in collecting the seed. About this time Burke
asked M ills to proceed up the creek as far as the depot,
and to place a note in the plant there, stating that the
three of them were living on the creek and were not
journeying towards Adelaide, as had been announced
in the former note deposited in the same place. He
was also to bury the field books of the trip to Carpen-
taria. While Wills was away King occupied his time
in gathering and pounding nardoo seed, as it was de-
sired to lay in a stock in case rain should fall and cut
off further supplies.
Wills started on his solitary journey on May 27.
On the same day he was overtaken by about twenty
blacks, who insisted on taking him to their camp and
feeding him on nardoo and fish. The depot was reached
arrival. “Having rested awhile,” says the diary, “and
eaten a few fish bones, I moved down the creek, hoping
by a late march to be able to reach our own camp,
but I soon found, from my extreme weakness, that that
would be out of the question.” The next day he fell
in with the blacks and was well fed with fish. On the
following day he had determined “to test the practic-
ability of living with them (the blacks), and to see what
I (Wills) could learn as to their ways and manners.”
But two days later found him back at the camp where
he had left his companions, whom he found had been
well supplied by the natives with fish. On June 8 the
three struggled to a camp the blacks had near the
nardoo supplies; but the inhabitants had disappeared,
much to the sorrow of the travellers, who then occupied
the best mia mia. Two days later found Burke and
King collecting nardoo, but Wills too weak to leave
POTATOES AT HERMITAGE, KILLARNEY LINE.
after a walk of three days. Here poor Wills wrote a
pathetic letter. It read as follows :
“Depot Camp, May 30.
“We have been unable to leave the creek. Both
camels are dead and our provisions are done. Mr.
Burke and King are down the lower part of the creek.
I am about to return to them, when we shall probably
come up this way. We are trying to live the best way
we can, like the blacks, but find it hard work. Our
clothes are going to pieces fast. Send provisions and
clothes as soon as possible.— W. J. Wills.”
“The depot party having left, contrary to instruc-
tions, has put us in a fix. I have deposited some of my
journals here for fear of accidents.”
On the following day Wills began his return jour-
ney. Two days later he reached the blacks’ camp, where
he hoped to be fed, but the place was deserted on his
the camp. He was unable to digest the nardoo seed.
On the 10th Wills, while admitting to feeling even
weaker than before, declared that he thinks he is
digesting the seed better. The other two spent most
of their days gathering the seed. Three days later
Wills wrote:—“King out for nardoo; brought in a fine
supply. Mr. Burke and I pounding and cleaning. He
finds himself getting very weak, and I am not a bit
stronger. I have determined on beginning to chew
tobacco and eat less nardoo, in hopes that it may induce
some change in the system.” Next day they finished
the remains of the camels’ flesh, but “King was for-
tunate enough to shoot a crow.” On the 20th Wills
wrote: —“I am completely reduced by the effects of the
cold and starvation. King gone out for nardoo. Mr.
Burke at home pounding seed. He finds himself get-
ting very weak in the legs. King holds out. by far the


best; the food seems to agree with him pretty well.
I cannot understand the nardoo at all; it
certainly will not agree with me in any form. We are
now reduced to it alone, and we manage to get from
four to five pounds per day between us.”
A bitter complaint is made in the diary on the
succeeding day. ‘‘lt is a great consolation,” writes the
narrator, “at least, in this position of ours, to know
that we have done all we could, and that our deaths
will be rather the result of the mismanagement of others
than of any rash acts of our own. Had we come to
grief elsewhere, we could only have blamed ourselves;
but here we are, returned to Cooper Creek, where we
had every reason to look for provisions and clothing,
and yet we have to die of starvation, in spite of the
explicit instructions given by Mr. Burke that the depot
party should await our return, and the strong recom-
mendation of the committee that we should be followed
up by a party from Menindie.” Next days he writes:
-—-“Mr. Burke and King out for nardoo. The former re-
turned much fatigued. I am so weak to-day as to be
unable to get on my feet.” And on the day following:
-—“I am so weak as to be incapable of crawling out of
the mia mia.” The next day was Sunday, June 23.
Wills writes again:—“King holds out well, but Mr.
Burke finds himself weaker every day.” And on Mon-
day: —“King went out for nardoo, in spit© of the wind
(elsewhere described as intensely severe and cold), and
cam© in with a good load, but he himself terribly cut
up. He says that he can no longer keep up the work,
and as he and Mr. Burke are both getting rapidly
weaker we have but a slight chance of anything but
starvation, unless we can get hold of some blacks.”
Burke was also now in a state of such extreme
weakness that he could render no assistance in collecting
food and very little in preparing it. But on the 26th
Burke was steeling himself for a final effort. He and
King were to go up the creek in search of the blacks,
leaving Wills in the mia mia, out of which he was not
able to drag himself. The two others were loath to
leave the unfortunate sufferer alone; but he urged them
to take what he regarded as the sole chance of any of
the party ever surviving. Two days later Wills made
the last entry in his diary. The tragic curcumstances
under which it was written render the document worthy
of quotation. It reads as follows:
“Friday, June 28.—Clear, cold night; slight breeze
from the E.; day beautifully warm and pleasant. Mr.
Burke suffers greatly from the cold, and is getting
extremely weak. He and King start to-morrow up the
creek to look for the blacks; it is the only chance we
have of being saved from starvation. I am weaker than
ever, although I have a good appetite and relish the
nardoo much; but it seems to give us no nutriment, and
the birds here are so shy as not to be got at. Even if
we could get a good supply of fish I doubt whether we
could do much work on them and nardoo alone.
Nothing now but the greatest good luck can save any
of us; and as for myself, I may live four or five days
if the weather continues warm. My pulse is at forty-
eight and very weak, and my legs and arms are nearly
skin and bone. I can only look out, like Mr. Micawber,
‘for something to turn up.’ Starvation on nardoo is by
no means very unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels
and the utter inability to move oneself; for as far as
appetite is concerned it gives me the greatest satisfac-
tion. Certainly fat and sugar would be more to one’s
taste; in fact, those seem to me to be the great stand-by
for one in this extraordinary continent; not that I
mean to depreciate the farinaceous food, but the want
of sugar and fat in all substances obtainable here is so
great that they become almost valueless to us as articles
of food without the addition of something else.—W. J.
Wills.”
Four days later King found Wills dead in the mia
mia. King buried the body in the sand.
It was on June 29 that the two men left Wills.
Burke complained all that day of great weakness; but
he was able to cover a fair distance. Next morning he
said he felt better, but after walking about two miles
he collapsed and could go no further for some time.
But King, with an almost superhuman patience and
devotion to his leader, alternately rested the unfortunate
man and encouraged him on by short stages. At last
they were obliged to camp. Burke literally had walked
until he dropped. Clearly he was dying. His watch
and pocket-book he handed to his companion, with a
request that they should be given to Sir William
Stawell, chairman of the Exploration Committee.
Addressing King, be said:—“l hope you will remain
with me here until I am quite dead. It is a comfort
to know that someone is by; but when I am dying it
is my wish that you should place the pistol in my right
hand, and that you leave me unburied as I lie.” Con-
sideration of King’s need for conserving his own
strength probably prompted the final request. The pistol
had been presented to Burke by the inhabitants of
Beechworth, Victoria, on his leaving that town to take
charge of the expedition. A few hours after addressing
King in the terms quoted Burke managed to pencil some
lines to his sister, and shortly afterwards he died.
It is necessary now to return to the bungling of
those who had failed to carry out the orders of their
leader, though the lives of the four men pushing to
Carpentaria and back depended on them doing so. As
already related, Brahe withdrew from the Cooper Creek
depot just seven hours before Burke, Wills, and King
reached it. At Bulloo he fell in with Wright, who had
halted there in a belated journey to the spot where h©
should have taken up his quarters months before.


Brahe placed himself under the orders of Wright, and
the two parties were merged into one. But this party
did not return to Cooper Creek to see if anything could
be ascertained of the unfortunate men left behind. On
the contrary, they made for the Darling. This is what
M right says about the matter in a despatch to the
committee dated June 20, 1861;
“With two of the party of eight dead and a third
dying, further advance or a longer stay at Bulloo amid
unfriendly natives were alike impracticable, and had
our cattle been molested by the natives our fate would
have been sealed. Dr. Beckler and Mr. Hodgkinson,
with myself, were the only healthy members of the
party, and I decided upon an immediate retreat to
Torowoto, at which place I hope to recruit the sick and
obtain fresh stores from the Darling. . .
Wright also states, in referring to the departure of
might as well have stayed where they were, though had
they accomplished their task with even moderate effi-
ciency the double tragedy of the desert undoubtedly
would have been prevented. After travelling five days
they reached the depot, but “found no sign of Mr.
Burke having visited the creek or the natives having
disturbed the stores/’ Yet Burke had not only dis-
turbed the stores, but had actually taken them away,
and in their place had left written matter in a bottle,
telling those next visiting the spot where to find him
and the remains of his party. Before a Royal Com-
mission ultimately held, Wright had to admit that he
had stayed only a quarter of an hour at the depot and
then had retraced his steps towards the Darling. For
not having opened the ground where the stores had
been placed Wright made the excuse that the spot, to
all appearances, had not been disturbed, and that to
QUEENSLAND AGRICULTURAL COOLEGE, GATTON.
Brahe from Cooper Creek:—“Mr. Brahe had received
instructions to remain at Cooper Creek for three or four
months, but had extended that period to eighteen weeks,
and only left when his rations ran short.” On the day
when the two parties joined, Beckler died. Writing on
May 1, Wright says: —“Dr. Beckler, Mr. Hodgkinson,
Mr. Brahe, Botan, and myself were the only healthy
members of the party, and I did not see the utility of
pushing on to the depot at Cooper Creek for the purpose
of remaining there the few weeks our stores would last.”
But if he bad pushed on “for only a few weeks” the
lives of Wills and Burke would have been saved. How-
ever, on May 3, Wright, accompanied by Brahe, set
off for the Cooper Creek depot, to make sure that Burke
had not returned. This was the obviously proper course
to take; but the undertaking was carried out in so
bungling and slipshod a fashion that the two men
have again opened it would have been perhaps to indi-
cate to natives that something was buried there. He
told the Commission that they had seen smoke the
night before, and were not sure that they were not
being watched whilst examining the depot. It is some-
what strange that Burke should not have cut something
on the tree where the word “dig” had been hewn by
Brahe before leaving. Had this course been taken the
lives of the leader and his second in command probably
would have been saved. Just twenty-two days later
poor Wills paid a final visit to the depot.
Wright and Brahe lost no time in rejoining the
remainder of the party, and the Darling was reached
on June 18, 1861. Three days later Brahe left for
Melbourne, taking with him papers Burke had left,
addressed to the committee, before departing on his dash
to Carpentaria. Brahe also wrote an account of his


own and Wright’s movements after Burke had left
them. Brahe reached his destination on June 30,
which happened to be the day preceding the death
of Burke.
The day that Brahe set foot in Melbourne a special
meeting of the committee was called. This was on a
Sunday afternoon. The Chief Justice (Sir William
Stawell) presided. The result was the organization of
a party under the leadership of Mr. Howitt, who was
instructed to set out in search of the missing explorers.
The details of this expedition will be dealt with in a
subsequent chapter. But it was not until this body of
men returned that the narrative of King could be
obtained. They had found the lonely survivor (who,
alone among the trio, had been able to digest the nardoo
seed) in a pitiable plight.
King related that, finding his stock of nardoo seed
running short, he tracked up the blacks, whom he
found. The natives displayed great compassion for him
on learning that he was alone, and they fed him well.
After King had been four days with the tribe they
apparently tired of him and made to shift their camp,
at the same time giving signs to the white man that
he was not to follow them. These he ignored, and,
as he was able shortly afterwards to shoot some crows,
he was made much of. The shooting of birds was
repeated, and King shortly came to be regarded by his
dusky comrades as one of themselves. On one occasion
King took the blacks, at their request, to view the
remains of Burke. On seeing the body the whole party
wept bitterly and covered it with bushes. Afterwards
they became even kinder to the white man than they
had been before. King finishes his narrative as fol-
lows:—“From this time to when the relief party
arrived—a period of about a month—they (the blacks)
treated me with uniform kindness and looked upon me
as one of themselves. The day on which I was released
one of the tribe who had been fishing came and told me
that the white fellows were coming, and the whole of
the tribe who were then in camp sallied out in every
direction to meet the party, while the man who had
brought me the news took me across the creek, where
I shortly saw the party coming down.’’
The Royal Commission appointed by the Victorian
Government to investigate the tragedy consisted of
Messrs. T, S. Pratt, Mathew Hervey, E. P. S. Sturt,
Francis Murphy, and J. F. Sullivan. The report of these
gentlemen very fairly allots the blame for the loss of
life upon the right shoulders. The document reads as
follows:
“The expedition, having been provided and
equipped in the most ample and liberal manner, and
having reached Menindie, on the Darling, without ex-
periencing any difficulties, was most injudiciously
divided at that point by Mr. Burke.
“It was an error of judgment on the part of Mr.
Burke to appoint Mr. Wright to an important command
in the expedition, without a previous personal know-
ledge of him, although, doubtless, a pressing urgency
had arisen for the appointment from the sudden resig-
nations of Mr. Landells and Dr. Becker.
“Mr. Burke evinced a far greater amount of zeal
than prudence in finally departing from Cooper Creek
before the depot party had arrived from Menindie, and
without having secured communication with the settled
districts, as he had been instructed to do; and in under-
taking so extended a journey with insufficient supply
of provisions, Mr. Burke was forced into the necessity
of overtaxing the powers of his party, whose continuous
and unremitting exertions resulted in the destruction of
his animals and the prostration of himself and his com-
panions from fatigue and severe privation.
“The conduct of Mr. Wright appears to have been
reprehensible in the highest degree. It is clear that
Mr. Burke, on parting with him at Torowoto, relied on
receiving his immediate and zealous support; and it
seems extremely improbable that Mr. Wright could have
misunderstood the intentions of his leader so far as to
suppose that he ever calculated for a moment on his
remaining for any length of time on the Darling. Mr.
Wright has failed to give any satisfactory explanation
of the causes of his delay, and to that delay are mainly
attributable the whole of the disasters of the expedition,
with the exception of the death of Gray. The grave
responsibility of not having left a larger supply of pro-
visions, together with some clothing, in the cache at
Cooper Creek rests with Mr. Wright. Even had he
been unable to convey stores to Cooper Creek, he might
have left them elsewhere, leaving notice at the depot of
his having done so.
“The Exploration Committee, in overlooking the
importance of the contents of Mr. Burke’s despatch
from Torowoto, and in not urging Mr. Wright’s depar-
ture from the Darling, committed errors of a serious
nature. A means of knowledge of the delay of the
party at Menindie was in the possession of the committee
—not, indeed, by direct communication to that effect,
but through the receipt of letters from Drs. Becker and
Beckler at various dates up to the end of November,
without however awakening the committee to a sense
of the vital importance of Mr. Burke’s request in that
despatch that he should ‘be soon followed up,’ or to a
conclusion of the disastrous consequences which would
be likely to result, and did unfortunately result, from
the fatal inactivity and idling of Mr. Wright and his
party on the Darling.
“The conduct of Mr. Brahe in retiring from his
position at the depot before he was rejoined by his com-
mander or relieved from the Darling, may be deserving
of considerable censure; but we are of opinion that a


responsibility far beyond his expectations devolved upon
him, and it must be borne in mind that, with the assur-
ance of his leader, and his own convictions, that he
might each day expect to be relieved by Mr. Wright,
he still held his post for four months and five days, and
that only when pressed by the appeals of a comrade
sickening even to death, as was subsequently proved,
his power of endurance gave way, and he retired from
the position which alone could afford succour to the
weary explorers should they return by that route. His
decision was most unfortunate, but we believe he acted
from a conscientious desire to discharge his duty, and
we are confident that the painful reflection that twenty-
four hours’ further perseverance would have made him
the rescuer of the explorers and gained for himself the
praise and approbation of all, must be of itself an
agonizing thought, without the addition of censure he
might feel himself undeserving of.
O O
“It does not appear that Mr. Burke kept any
regular journal, or that he gave written instructions to
his officers. Had he performed these essential portions
of the duties of a leader many of the calamities of the
expedition might have been averted, and little or no
room would have been left for doubt in judging of the
conduct of those subordinates who pleaded unsatisfac-
tory and contradictory verbal orders and statements.
“We cannot too deeply deplore the lamentable
result of an expedition undertaken at so great a cost to
the colony; but while we regret the absence of a
systematic plan of operations on the part of the leader,
we desire to express our admiration of his gallantry
and daring, as well as of the fidelity of his brave coad-
jutor, Mr. Wills, and their more fortunate and endur-
ing associate, Mr. King; and we would record our feelings
of deep sympathy with the deplorable sufferings and
untimely deaths of Mr. Burke and his fallen comrades.”
CHAPTER V.
DESPATCH OF RELIEF PARTIES.
Before the arrival of Mr. Brahe in Melbourne the
committee had determined on despatching a relief party
in search of the missing explorers. The unaccountable
feature of the situation was that this course had not
been decided on earlier. It was Dr. Wills, the father
of Burke’s second in command, who brought matters
to a head. Arriving in Melbourne in the middle of
June, he succeeded in convincing the members of the
committee of the seriousness of the position, and a
meeting of that body was held on the 18th of the month.
A resolution in favour of sending out an expedition
w T as unanimously agreed upon, and Alfred William
Howitt, a skilled bushman and successful explorer, was
chosen as leader. Twelve days later Mr. Brahe arrived
in Melbourne, and in consequence of the tidings he
brought to hand the sending away of the party was still
further hurried on.
Other expeditions were sent out with a similar end
in view. A party was sent from Rockhampton to pene-
trate to the westward. A steam sloop, the “Victoria,”
sailed for the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria to look
out for the missing men there, and to bring them back
if they were found. A steam yacht was sent to the
same coast by Mr. Orkney to render aid. The Queens-
land Government co-operated with the Victorian
authorities in despatching a party under Mr. Lands-
borough, the well-known explorer, in the “Firefly,”
to proceed to the Albert River, which empties
into the Gulf. At the same time South Australia
organized a party under the command of Mr. McKinlay,
to which reference will be made later.
Mr. Howitt took five men with him. They were
Dr. W. F. Wheeler, Messrs. H. M. Simpson, W. H.
Calcott, W. Phillips, and Brahe. The equipment was
substantial. Seven camels and thirty-seven horses were
to be used. Among these would be some which had
returned with Brahe and Wright, and were in suffi-
ciently good condition for the work on hand. Five
months’ rations were to be taken from Menindie. Mr.
Howitt was given a very free hand in organizing the
details of the enterprise entrusted to his control.
Roughly, the party was to follow up the track of Burke
to the depot at Cooper Creek, and from there was to
begin the search for the unfortunate explorers.
The party left Melbourne on July 4, 1861. On
August 13 they were on the Darling, which they left
next day. Plentiful rain had fallen, the pastures were
in an excellent state, and conditions generally favoured
travelling. Poria Creek was reached on September 1.
On the Bth they first saw Cooper Creek, and on the 13th
they arrived at the depot, where Brahe and Wright had
failed to find the messages left by Burke and Wills.
Hardly any water was obtained between Poria and
Cooper Creeks. On reaching the depot Howitt’s first
task was to do what Brahe and Wright had neglected.
They opened the ground where the stores had been
buried, and of course they found that the stores had
been removed, and in their place were bottles containing
the information—first, that Burke, Wills, and King had
set out for Adelaide, and then that they had abandoned
the effort and were living within the region of the
Creek. Howitt now realized that he must be close to


the whereabouts, dead or alive, of the missing men.
The experiences of the next few days are best described
in the words of Mr. Howitt himself. His diary con-
tains the following account:
“The next morning I went with Sandy to try and
pick up Burke’s track. At the lower end of a large
water-hole I found where one or two horses had been
feeding for some months. The tracks ran in all direc-
tions to and from the water, and were as recent as a
week. At the same place I found the handle of a clasp
knife. From here I struck out south for a short dis-
tance from the creek, and found a distinct camel’s
track and droppings on a native path; the footprint
was about four months old and going east. I then
set the black boy to follow the creek, and struck across
some sandy country in a bend on the north side. No
traces there; and coming on a native path leading my
way I followed it as the most likely place to see any
signs. In about four miles this led me to the lower end
of a large reach of water, and on the opposite side were
numbers of native wurleys. I crossed at a neck of sand
and at a little distance, and again came on the track
of a camel going up the creek. At the same time I
found a native, who began to gesticulate in a very
excited manner and to point down the creek, bawling
out ‘Gow, Gow!’ as loud as he could. When I went
towards him he ran away, and I found it impossible to
get him to come to me. I therefore turned back to
follow the camel track and to look after my party, as
I had not seen any of them for some miles. The track
was visible in sandy places, and was evidently the same
I had seen for the last two days. I also found horse
tracks in places, but very old. Crossing the creek, I
cut our track and rode after the party. In doing so
I came upon three pounds of tobacco, which had lain
where I saw it for some time. This, together with the
knife handle, the fresh horse tracks, and the camel track
going eastward, puzzled me exceedingly and led me into
a hundred conjectures. At the lower end of the large
reach of water before mentioned, I met Frank and
Sandy looking for me, with the intelligence that King,
the only survivor of Burke’s party, had been found.
A little further on I came on the party halted, and
immediately went across to the blacks’ wurleys, where
I found King sitting in a hut which the natives had
made for him. He presented a melancholy appearance,
wasted as a shadow and hardly to be distinguished as
a civilized being but by the remnants of clothing upon
him. He seemed exceedingly weak, and I found it
occasionally difficult to follow what he said. The
natives were all gathered round, seated on the ground,
looking with a most gratified and delighted expression.
I camped where the party had halted, on a high bank
close to the water, and shall probably remain here ten
days to recruit King before returning.”
The diary of September 18 and 21 gives a pathetic
account of the burial of the two dead explorers. The
bodies were afterwards disinterred and reburied in Mel-
bourne. .Referring to the former date, Howitt wrote:
“Left camp this morning with Messrs. Welch,
Wheeler, and King to perform a melancholy duty,
which had weighed on my mind ever since we have
camped here, and which I only put off until King
should be well enough to accompany us. We proceeded
down the creek for seven miles, crossing a branch run-
ning to the southward, and followed a native track
leading to that part of the creek where Mr. Burke, Mr.
Wills, and King camped after their unsuccessful
attempt to reach Mount Hopeless and the northern
settlements of South Australia, and where poor Wills
died. We found the two gunyahs pretty much as King
had described them, situated on a sandbank between
two waterholes, and about a mile from the flat where
they procured the nardoo seed on which they managed
to exist so long. Poor Wills’ remains were found lying
in the wurley in which he died, and where King, after
his return from seeking the natives, had buried him
with sand and rushes. We carefully collected the
remains and interred them where they lay, and not
having a prayer book I read chapter xv. of I. Corin-
thians, that we might at least feel a melancholy satis-
faction in having shown the last respect to his remains.
We heaped sand over the grave and laid branches upon
it that the natives might understand by their own
tokens not to disturb the last repose of a fellow-being.”
Howitt then cut an inscription on an adjacent
stone, showing exactly where the body lay. King was
too done up with the journey for Howitt to locate the
last resting-place of Burke, but on the 21st a party set
out to search for the spot.
Mr. Howitt’s account of the experience is as fol-
lows :
“Finding it would not be prudent for King to
go out for two or three days, I could no longer defer
making a search for the spot where Mr. Burke died,
and with such directions as King could give I went up
the creek this morning with Messrs. Welsh, Wheeler,
and Aitkin. We searched the creek upwards for eight
miles, and at length, strange to say, found the remains
of Mr. Burke lying among tall plants under a clump of
box trees, within 200 yards of our last camp, and not
thirty paces from our track. It was still more extra-
ordinary that three or four of the party and the two
black boys had been close to the spot without noticing
it. The bones were entire, with the exception of the
hands and feet, and the body had been removed from
the spot where it first lay and where the natives had
placed branches over it, to about five paces. I found
the revolver which Mr. Burke held in his hand when he
expired, partly covered with leaves and earth and


corroded with rust. It was loaded and capped. We
dug a grave close to the spot and interred the remains,
wrapped in a Union Jack—the most fitting covering in
which the bones of a brave but unfortunate man could
take their last rest. An inscription was carved on the
trunk of a box tree near by.”
Before starting for home on September 25 the
party liberated four homing pigeons with the news of
the result of the expedition. These birds had been
brought from Melbourne in a specially-constructed
padded cage, which was hoped to hold them without
their tail feathers suffering from friction. But very
little of their tails were left when Cooper Creek
had been reached. An ingenious device was tried by
obtaining feathers from wild pigeons and splicing these
on to the stumps in the tails of the homing birds with
wax. A trial flight inside a tent was found successful,
he brought the blacks together and distributed
presents among them. These comprised knives, looking
glasses, tomahawks, and such articles as would please
the savage mind. The utmost delight and thanks were
expressed by the tribe, and a corroboree was held in
celebration of the event.
Mr. Howitt greatly regretted that the nature of his
instructions were such that they compelled him to
return immediately he had found or ascertained the fate
of the missing explorers. The leader of the relief party
felt sure that he could easily have made the passage to
the Gulf and back. This, however, was not to be,
though a great deal of useful exploring work was accom-
plished by other parties which had set out for the pur-
pose of finding Burke and his companions, but were
unsuccessful in that effort. Howitt reached Melbourne
in safety with his staff and with King. He afterwards

and the little creatures were then liberated. But dis-
appointment met the effort. One bird was immediately
pounced on and killed by a hawk. Another got no
further than a neighbouring tree. The remainder
circled round for some time, and then struck away in
a definite direction. But it was apparent to Mr.
Howitt that they would never be able to run the
gauntlet of hawks to be met on the way from Central
Australia to the Victorian capital.
Howitt, in his diary says: —"I feel confident that
we have left the best impression behind us, and that
the ‘white-fellows,’ as they have already learned to call
us, will be looked on henceforth as friends, and that
in case of emergency anyone will receive the kindest
treatment at their hands.”
Howitt himself took care that this state of things
should be established. Before leaving the neighbourhood
returned to Cooper Creek for the purpose of bringing
away the remains of Burke and Wills for burial in a
cemetery.
The successful expedition led by Howitt in search
of the missing explorers formed but one of several
parties equipped and sent out for a similar purpose. Of
these, three succeeded in crossing the continent.
McKinlay, having set out from Adelaide, reached the
mouth of the Albert River, on the north coast, on May
18, 1862. Landsborough, starting in an opposite direc-
tion, reached the Darling from the Gulf of Carpentaria
on June 1 of the same year; whilst the north coast, near
the River Adelaide, was reached by Stuart on the 24th
of the following month.
McKinlay ranks next to Burke, in order of time,
among leaders of parties to reach from coast to coast.
The expedition under his command had been fitted out


at the expense of the people of South Australia, by
vote of the Parliament of that Province. The leadership
was offered to him while he was in Melbourne, and he
immediately accepted the responsible position, losing no
time in returning to Adelaide. Public anxiety about
the fate of the missing expedition was keen, and a strong
public desire was expressing itself to atone for the errors
and misconduct of those upon whom Burke had depended
for support, but who had so dismally failed him.
The authorities recognized that relief should have been
sent earlier. The fault clearly lay in Victoria; but as
the committee and the Government there had both
delayed so long, the other States thought only of the
tragic circumstances which must by that time surround
the little band of white men in the arid heart of
Australia, if indeed they might remain alive. Pre-
parations were thus rapidly pushed forward in Adelaide,
and these were expedited by McKinlay, on his arrival,
to such an extent that within three weeks of his having
received the telegram in Melbourne, offering him the
appointment, the whole party was already fifty miles
north of the capital city and making good progress on
its long march. But speed had not been attained at
the cost of efficiency. The livestock consisted of four
camels, twenty-four horses, twelve bullocks, and a
hundred sheep. These were accompanied by ten men,
with Mr. Hcdgkinson as second in command. Provi-
sions were taken in such quantity as would permit of
the expedition, without undue hardship, reaching the
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. If they found it
necessary to penetrate so far, they were to be met there
by the steamer “Victoria,” which had been despatched
by the Government of the colony of the same name. In
all respects the enterprise had been skilfully planned,
and in no detail more than in the selection of a com-
mander. McKinlay was an expert bushman of long
experience. His judgment was sound and firm, whilst
he appears to have possessed the necessary traits of
character for successfully holding authority over men
among whom he was to spend many long weeks, more
in the relation of a comrade than as a superior officer.
Critics have blamed him for not taking more accurate
observations to determine his exact whereabouts as he
proceeded northward; whilst his naming of natural
geographical features appears to have been somewhat
slipshod and to have been characterized with a habit of
repetition. But it has to be recollected that the first
task of McKinlay’s expedition was to find Burke’s
party, whilst the business of exploration was a secondary
function. In endeavouring to accomplish the main pur-
pose he showed no lack of energy or of capacity, whilst
those under his control had every reason to feel grateful
for the consideration displayed by the leader for the
welfare of his men. The start was made from Adelaide
on August 16, 1861.
The first news McKinlay appears to have heard of
Burke’s party was when making north from Lake
Blanche. Here natives told him of white men having
died at Cooper Creek. McKinlay decided to push
rapidly forward with a small portion of his party.
From here onward the movements of this leader more
directly concern the history of Queensland. With
Hodvkinson, another white man named Middleton, and
O 7
a native known as Bulingani, four camels, and provi-
sions, McKinlay set out in the hope of finding and
being able to render aid to some of his countrymen.
After travelling for two days, during which they passed
country well grassed and watered, they fell in with
about 150 natives, among whom was distributed a
quantity of clothing which must have belonged to white
men. These blacks confirmed the impression that whites
had been in the neighbourhood, and added that the
latter had been murdered by another tribe. Next day
McKinlay found a grave which, from its appearance,
led him to believe must contain the body of a white
man. On exhuming the corpse they found it to consist
of a skeleton, from which apparently the flesh had been
cut. The bones were wrapped in a shirt. The head
was cut from the trunk, and the forehead contained two
cuts over the left eye. On a tree near by was marked
“M.K., October 21, 1861.” These were the remains of
poor Gray. The body had been dug up by the blacks,
who had eaten the flesh and reburied the bones. But
this truth was unknown to McKinlay and his com-
panions. Unfortunately they gave credence to a
romance told them by Bulingani of a fight between
blacks and whites, which had resulted in the death of
him whose body they had found. Other natives after-
wards paid dearly for their countryman’s lack of
veracity. Nor was the story lacking in corroboration.
The original grave was also found. Though, of course,
the latter contained no body; it evidently had been dug
with a spade or shovel, whilst the surrounding ground
contained pieces of paper, an exploded cartridge, and
other articles clearly brought there by Europeans. A
native of the locality was captured, and he said the
bodies of white men had been eaten. The latter cir-
cumstance convinced McKinlay that the aboriginals of
the locality were dangerous and that they had murdered
at least a portion of Burke’s party. This conviction
was by no means removed next morning, when some
forty of the blacks were seen approaching with imple-
ments of warfare, which they waved as they chanted.
This bore all the appearance of an organized attack.
The white men feared an immediate attempt to massacre
them, thinking that the natives had been made aggres-
sive and bold by having succeeded in a similar assault
on Burke and his companions. McKinlay could hardly
have been blamed had he ordered his men immediately
to shoot into what appeared to be an enemy force. But


he did not act rashly. He told Bulingani to inform
the tribe that if they continued advancing they would
be fired upon. As the warning produced no effect a
number of rounds of ammunition was used in carrying
the warning into execution. The blacks immediately
fled in dismay. They were the unfortunate creatures
who had treated Burke, Wills, and particularly King,
with such kindness, and who were advancing, expecting
from the newcomers the same gratitude as they already
had received from Howitt. McKinlay did not learn the
real facts until hearing from the main party, which he
had left behind when pushing on in his endeavour to
rescue any of the survivors of Burke’s expedition.
McKinlay spent some weeks exploring the country
round about Cooper Creek and to the south of there.
Grass, creeks, and lakes appeared to be plentiful, but
there was an absence of other surface water, and rain
of loose sand and among shallow lakes. So severe was
the temperature that one of the bullocks died from the
heat within the first few miles. As day succeeded day
the rays of the sun appeared to gather in strength.
The horses would be covered with perspiration before
leaving camp in the morning, whilst the men were tired
and jaded as soon as attempting the slightest exertion.
However, water and feed for the stock proved to be
plentiful, and native game was to be shot on the lakes.
Lack of shelter, either by day or night, accentuated the
hardships which had to be put up with. Under these
disabilities McKinlay pushed up to the edge of Sturt’s
Stony Desert, through which it was impossible for him
to pass until rain should fall. The party was destined
to spend several months under these wearisome circum-
stances. Returning to Lake Blanch, in South Aus-
tralia, the whole party, having been joined together.
IRRIGATING AND PLANTING TOBACCO AT TEXAS.
apparently had not fallen for months. During this
time he had sent Hodgkinson and others, who had
joined since the advance detachment had pushed for-
ward, to the main party to obtain further provisions.
Several traces of Burke and Wills were come across,
and McKinlay also saw the cobby horses, afterwards
captured by Howitt’s party, which had been left in the
locality by Sturt seventeen years before.
On December 17, having learned the full facts of
the fate of Burke and his companions, and particulars
of expeditions sent out in relief of them, McKinlay
turned his face to the north-east. It was his intention
to reach as far as he then could towards the northern
coast by traversing western Queensland. The heat at
that time of year proved very intense, whilst the earlier
stages of the journey were exceedingly difficult of
negotiation. At first the course lay over hot hillocks
j
was again forced to spend a disagreeable term of wait-
ing. On February 8 the long-looked-for rain came.
Preparations for moving occupied two days, and a start
northwards was made on the 10th. The ground was
now too soft to permit of easy travelling. The cart had
to be left behind and the stores packed on the backs
of the camels. Flies became an intolerable pest.
Some of the bullocks died from fatigue. Although no
grass yet was growing, the party was quickly surrounded
with water and anxiety of being swept away by the
floods soon began to press upon the minds of all of them.
On March 30 the party ascended and named the Hamil-
ton Range, from which it was able to command a
comprehensive view of the surrounding country. The
experience of crossing the Stony Desert was quite con-
trary to what might have been expected from the
description given of that area by Sturt. The latter


explorer, in 1844-5, had found the region arid and
barren, though there were traces of rain having caused
floods there. McKinlay, describing the part of the
desert over which he had passed to a spot he named
“Escape Camp,” writes;—“A great portion of the flat
is covered by water. Beyond the creek there is nothing
visible but lines of trees, marking the course of lesser
channels, and stone hills; all else is perfect sea. We
were very fortunate to be caught in it where we were, or
to a certainty all would have been washed away, or
perched up on a small island of sand, with nothing but
starvation staring us in the face, as there is no vegeta-
tion on the sand-rises down the creek.” Members of the
party, with these facts on their minds, evolved the
theory that such floods in this locality might have
accounted for the fate of Leichhardt’s expedition.
As the party travelled northward the conditions
improved, so far as facilities for covering the ground
were concerned. On the hills the grass was growing
plentifully, and the surface of the ground became some-
what easier to make headway over. The explorers were
still in the Stony Desert, but towards the end of March
they emerged on to a different class of country. Here there
were well-grassed plains, bright with wildflowers, whilst
creeks, ranges, and swamps were alternately crossed.
The weather became more endurable; the nights, after
the extreme heat recently experienced, seemed almost
cold to the travellers. On April 6 the Daly Ranges
were reached. As the men advanced northwards
emus and birds became plentiful. On the 9th they were
near the present site of Longamundi, north-east of Clon-
curry. Soon the party plunged into tropical vegeta-
tion, the character of the flora showing a marked change.
Palms and new species of trees became common, and
the grass was so long and rank that in many places
progress could be made through it only with difficulty.
Copper was found in one of the creeks, but the dis-
coverers did not realize how close they were to a field
destined to yield returns so rich as those of the since
famous Cloncurry. Other minerals were discovered in
the neighbourhood, and traces of gold were apparent.
Several times progress was delayed through stock being
lost. On one occasion the advance was hung up for
six days because one of the men, who had been sent out
in charge of the sheep, lost his bearings. Later the
horses strayed away. The altitude was considerable,
which accounted, together with the advance of autumn,
for the more pleasant weather now enjoyed. On the
27th Williams Creek was crossed and named, the
astonishment of the party being aroused at huge logs
having been deposited by past floods forty feet up in the
branches of standing trees. Good evidence pointed to
the deluges here having been of a truly sensational
character. Early in May the explorers crossed the track
of Burke, and on the 9th they reached the Leichhardt.
The following description of the stream as seen
by the explorers is from the pen of McKinlay; —“Its
bed vast sheets of stone-rocks and small stones on the
opposite side lower down; the water in its bed is about
or upwards of 150 yards wide. At two miles, bearing
of about 110°, struck the river at a stony and rocky
fall, and went westward half a mile to avoid the bend;
struck river again at three miles on same course as
above; then, at four and a half miles struck the x'iver,
the water in its full width now upwards of 250 yards,
a splendid-looking place and lined on its banks with
splendid trees of various kinds, with a variety of palms,
etc.; then to the southward of south-west for between
six and eight miles. But the rugged banks are so
intricate that it was impossible to calculate the distances
correctly. In many places, half a mile from the river
banks, the plains drop off precipitately from three to
ten feet, and slope off in undetermined, deep earthy
creeks, finishing at last in deep reedy creeks close to the
river. Water in nearly all the side creeks com-
pelled us to keep out, but sometimes we were caught
in them, thinking the timber we were advancing to was
a lagoon or belt of timber, and then we were
to go round it; then cross a very fine creek running
into the river, the same, I believe, we crossed yesterday
about six miles from camp on our outward course.
From this to our camp I make about thirteen miles,
on a bearing of about 200°.”
The climate here was all that might be desired.
The lateness of the season had given a mildness to the
days, whilst the nights were chilly. Birds were plenti-
ful and grass was everywhere. The latter was described
by the travellers as being up to a man’s neck. The
latter circumstance, in more ways than one, proved to
be no unmixed blessing. At one of the camps McKinlay
ordered his men to burn the pasturage in the immediate
neighbourhood in order to achieve safety. A result was
the ignition of the baggage. The fire is thus
described by one of the party, named Davis:—“We
had finished, and the fire was all out and secure,
the wind at the same time being very still, hardly
a breath, when all of a sudden we were perfectly
astounded. Bang ! bang ! bang ! Fiz ! fiz ! We ran
down as fast as our legs could carry us, and found to
onr dismay that some fire that had been smouldering
had been fanned into a flame and communicated with
the pack raddles in which was our ammunition, to say
nothing of fireworks, so that rockets and blue lights
were vieing with one another in their praiseworthy
endeavour to celebrate our arrival at the Falls. It
might have been worse had we been farther afield, as
the packs would have been inevitably destroyed. As it
is, every rocket is ‘absent without leave,’ which is a
great pity in case we should want to signalize the ‘Vic-
toria’ should she be in the Gulf.” In Stokes’ Plains


of Promise the camels strayed, and three days were lost
in recovering them.
The tidal reaches of the Albert River were reached
on May 18. “After getting amongst a number of
swamps and large lagoons,” writes McKinlay, referring
to this point in his travels, “we struck a fine large
mangrove creek, a very pretty spot like an orange grove.
Bearing of for two miles; then bearing of 35°,
crossed the sea running in through mangrove creeks
into the flats like a sluice, and camped at a lagoon and
couple of fresh-water holes, close to the river. We are
now perfectly surrounded by salt water—the river on
one side and the mangrove creeks and salt flats on the
other. I question much whether we shall be able to
get to tiie beach with horses. Since noon wind changed

natives; it was dry enough as it was, without the
additional use of

19. Camp 60.
Started out this
morning with the
intention of going to the beach, taking with me
Middleton, Poole, Wylde, and Kirby; but was quite
unsuccessful, being hindered by the deep and broad
mangrove creeks and boggy flats, over which our horses
could not travel. I consider we are now about four or
five miles from the coast. There is a rise in the river
here of six and two-thirds feet to-day, but yesterday it
was a foot higher. Killed our three remaining sheep,
and will retrace our steps on the 21st.
“Tuesday, May 20. Camp 60. Sent Hodgkinson
and Poole to the salt flats to collect what will be suffi-
cient for our homeward ramble, or rather to the Queens-
land settled districts, where we hope to arrive in due
time. The state of the clothing of the party, and want
of various things—the principal thing, food—has pre-
vented my directing the steps of the party to the settled
districts of South Australia. A few of the natives came
j 2
to the opposite side of the river this morning during the
flood tide and got up in the trees, and I was a long
time in getting any of them persuaded to cross. At
length, two of them, and another middle-aged man,
ventured, on my displaying a tomahawk to them. They
were of the ordinary stamp, and, strange to say, were
neither circumcised nor had any of their front teeth out,
but were marked down the upper part of the arms and
on the breast and back. After making them a few
presents they recrossed; no information from them, but
perhaps we may see something more of them on a future
day. Hodgkinson and Poole returned with from forty
to fifty pounds of good salt, sufficient for our purpose,
and we start in the morning to proceed as far as the
Falls and cross the river there, in the event of not
finding a crossing earlier, which I don’t expect. The
camels, I am sorry to say, are getting lame by the burnt
stumps of reeds and
strong coarse grass
entering tire soles of
their feet. I hope
they will soon re-
cover. If the bar

erally for sheep.
“Wednesday, May 21. Camp 60. Commenced
our journey for Port Denison.”
The return to civilization was commenced under
anything but auspicious circumstances. All the sheep
had been used and only two of the bullocks were left.
Supplies of flour, tea, and sugar had been finished.
The camels became sore-footed and lame, so that the
travellers were compelled to make them boots of leather.
One by one the horses began to die, and some of the
camels had to be killed for food. Whilst these hard-
ships were being endured the country became progres-
sively more difficult to traverse, rising in places to an
altitude of 3,000 feet, besides being rugged and bold.
Yet McKinlay complained very little of the difficulties
besetting his path.
The homeward track was bent more to the east
than had been the route when advancing from south to

north. The Flinders River was crossed on June 7. A
short distance further on the Norman River was met
with and named. “I ascended the hills,” wrote
McKinlay, referring to the experiences of June 15,
“and never beheld such a fearfully grand country in
my life—nothing but towers and pinnacles of sandstone
conglomerate, fit for nothing but wallaby and emu;
and for a thousand years hence it can be used by
nothing but them and the natives. It is a terrible
country.”
The Burdekin was reached on July 5, but a strong
current was running and the water was a hundred yards
wide. Ultimately, however, the party was able to
cross by means of rafts, and the journey to the east
coast was continued. On July 24, while still ninety
miles from Port Denison, only one camel and two pack
horses were left, the rest of the livestock having either
been killed for food or else left behind on account of
fatigue rendering them unable to keep up with the
travellers. Six days later the homestead of Messrs.
Harvey and Somers was reached. Here, strangely
enough, McKinlay fell in with Brahe, and was able to
learn by word of mouth the fate which had overtaken
Burke and the circumstances surrounding the discovery
of King. Brahe had engaged in Queensland pastoral
pursuits. At Port Denison McKinlay embarked for
Adelaide, where on arrival he received much credit for
the work achieved by the expedition.
CHAPTER VI.
LANDSBOROUGH IN SEARCH OF BURKE.
The expedition led by William Landsborough, the
third in point of time to crdss the continent, was
organized at the joint expense of Victoria and Queens-
land for the object of discovering the whereabouts of
Burke and Wills. The Government of the older colony
voted £2,000 for the purpose in hand, whilst that of
Queensland donated £5OO, though responsibility for the
fate of the ill-fated party certainly rested with the
colony which had undertaken to send it out. Lands-
borough took with him seven men, mostly blacks, and
thirty horses. The party was to be brought from Bris-
bane, where the equipment had been prepared and the
arrangements made, to the shore of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria by the steamer “Victoria,” under the control
of Captain Norman, who was made commander-in-chief.
Under his authority an expedition was also to be led
from Rockhampton by Frederick Walker. Both parties
were to be paid for from the common fund contributed
to by the two colonies.
To accompany the “Victoria” was the tender
“Firefly,” of 200 tons. Landsborough, with his men
and horses, were taken on the latter craft. The “Fire-
fly” was blown ashore on the eastern coast of Cape Yorke
Peninsula, after having lost sight of the “Victoria.”
However, little damage was suffered, and on arrival of the
“Victoria” successful repairs were made to the stranded
ship. The Albert River was to be the destination of
the two vessels. Walker having been duly landed, the
“Firefly” was able to proceed about twenty-six miles up
the stream to its junction with the Barkly. This was
in the November of 1861, and on the 14th of that month
Landsborough set out overland. The Albert was traced
up to its junction with the Gregory, with which it is
interlocked in a way peculiar to country of marked
flatness. Landsborough followed the Gregory in its
south-westerly course until reaching its tributary, the
O’Shanassy. He then proceeded along the latter
stream. This portion of the journey represented about
120 miles, and the country passed through, though in
places without undulation, elsewhere was hilly—the
Premier Hills, Table Hill, the Barren Ranges, and
Mounts Kay and Heales, as well as other elevations,
being met with and named. Some distance further
south, having left the river, the party was faced with
a shortage of water, and in consequence a return was
made to the Albert River, the depot there being reached
after sixty-nine days of travel.
Landsborough was not favourably impressed with
the pastoral possibilities of the country through which
he had passed, the outstanding feature, according to his
view, being susceptibility to periods of intense drought.
However, he gives an interesting description of the land
in the immediate neighbourhood of the Gregory. “The
bed of the river,” he writes, “we had found perfectly
dry for some distance back. It is badly watered along
the course we have come to-day. Above our camp it is
quite of a different character. There are now only gum
trees in the bed of it, when lower down it was crowded
with green trees, consisting chiefly of figs, Leichhardt,
drooping teatree, cabbage palm, pandanus, etc. All
the country above the camp, on the banks of the river,
is composed of barren, rocky, basaltic ridges, which are
slightly timbered with stunted bloodwood trees, and are
overrun with desert grass, with the exception of narrow
strips of flooded country on each side of the river, on
the lower parts of which there is coarse grass, and on
the highest parts tufts of the best description of
grasses.”


Walker, having travelled from Rockhampton
north-west, had reached the Albert River depot on
December 7, before Landsborough got there, and having
laid in a fresh stock of provisions from the ships had
set out from there in a southerly direction, in the hope
of being able to follow the tracks of Burke, and in
that way clear up the whereabouts of that unfortunate
leader, if he should remain alive. This, of course,
lessened the quantities of supplies available for Lands-
borough, should the latter have persisted in the original
intention that he also should penetrate to the heart of
the continent in search of the missing party. Captain
Norman was distinctly opposed to the latter course
being adopted, pointing out that the risks incidental to
such an enterprise had been rendered unnecessary by
Walker having engaged in the task of following up
Burke. As, however, the dangers would be incurred
by Landsborough himself, and the latter would be
directly responsible for any untoward event overtaking
the men under his charge, the commander left the final
decision in the hands of his subordinate. The latter
was keen on making the journey, and it has been held
by critics that not so much did desire to find and relieve
the Burke party, or wish to fulfil the letter of his
original mission, influence him as the motive of dis-
covering valuable pastoral land. If this view were right,
twice will the land hunger of the times have cropped up
in connection with the Burke and Wills enterprise, the
first occasion being the delay of Wright to push on to
Cooper Creek. Landsborough’s stated reasons for desiring
to reach the south by proceeding overland certainly lend
colour to these strictures. As one cause for the deter-
mination arrived at he advanced the probable failure of
Walker, on account of the tracks of Burke being too
old to be successfully followed. On the face of it, this
seems no reason at all, for the tracks were older at the
earliest date on which Landsborough could set out upon
them than when Walker had started some two months
earlier. On the other hand, it is possible Lands-
borough meant that if the tracks could not be followed
by either party Burke would stand more chance of being
found by tv/o expeditions looking for him than by one.
Firmly resolved to make the journey, Landsborough
started from the Albert on February 10. At first he
deflected his southerly course somewhat to the east, as
Walker had come across some of Burke’s tracks at a
spot on the Flinders River; but to reach the latter point
it was necessary to follow the tracks of Walker, and on
the second day of travelling these had become so faint
as to be almost unrecognizable. Two days later all
efforts to trace Walker were abandoned and the Leich-
hardt River was reached.
On February 19 the party reached the Flinders.
Here Landsborough writes:—“At 9.30, having come
over the plains on our old course for five miles from the
isolated hills, we reached the Flinders River. The
river, we were glad to find, had been recently flooded;
in crossing we ascertained it had four channels, one of
which was running. As this was the river on the banks
of which Mr. Walker said he had found the track of
Burke’s party, I thought it would be a good plan
to follow it up, and resolved to do so.” The only other
reference made by Landsborough in his journal to the
search for Burke’s tracks having occupied his mind was
under the date of April 10. Shortly after reaching the
Flinders the party crossed the course of Burke, but were
not conscious of that important fact. For some distance
they travelled along a line parallel with that taken by
Burke. But in justice to Landsborough it should be
recollected that the climatic conditions of the locality
were such that they would quickly obliterate the foot-
prints either of horses or camels.
Making east as far as longitude 144°, the party
reached the source of the Thomson, and that stream
was followed down to latitude 25°. Then, bearing
west, Landsborough fell in with the Barcoo. Later
Mr. Williams’ station was reached, and from there a
course was struck to the Darling.
Practically nothing had been accomplished by
Landsborough in ascertaining the history of Burke,
though the fate of that unfortunate leader had already
been cleared up by Howitt. But most useful informa-
tion had been gathered of the character of much new
country. Data had been recorded which could hardly
fail to stimulate the development of pastoral industry
and lead to its expansion over what had previously
ranked as an unknown region. Moreover, the passage
from the settled parts of Queensland to the Gulf of
Carpentaria was rendered more accessible by Lands-
borough’s efforts than it had ever been before. This
aspect of the result of the expedition was well put for-
ward in The Argus, of Melbourne, shortly after its
completion. That journal wrote as follows;—“Great
credit must be given to Mr. Landsborough for the
celerity with which he has accomplished the expedition.
At the same time its object seems to have been lost sight
of at a very early stage of the journey, as there was
not the remotest possibility of striking Burke’s track
after quitting the Flinders River and taking a S.S.E.
course for the remainder of the way. In fact, from
that moment all mention ceases to be made of the
ostensible purpose for which the party was organized
until Mr. Landsborough reached the Warrego and
received intelligence of Burke and Wills having perished,
at which great surprise was expressed. But supposing
these gallant men to have been still living, and
anxiously awaiting succour at some one of the ninety
camping-places at which they halted on their arduous
journey between the depot and the Gulf, what excuse
could Mr. Landsborough have offered for giving so wide

a berth to the probable route of the explorers and for
omitting to endeavour to strike their track, traces of
which had been reported on the Flinders by Mr.
Walker? We may be reminded ‘that all’s well that
ends well,’ that the lamented explorers were beyond
the reach of human assistance, and that Mr. Lands-
borough has achieved a most valuable result in follow-
ing the course he did. But we cannot help remark-
ing that in so doing he seems to have been more intent
upon serving the cause of pastoral settlement than upon
ascertaining if it were possible to afford relief to the
missing men. The impression produced by the perusal
of the despatch which we published on Saturday last is
that the writer was commissioned to open up a practical
route from the Warrego to the Flinders, and not that he
was the leader of a party which had been organized and
despatched ‘for the purpose of rendering relief, if pos-
sible, to the missing explorers under the command of
Mr. Burke.’ We do not wish to detract one iota from
the credit due to Mr. Landsborough for what he had
actually effected, but we must not lose sight of the
‘mission of humanity’ in which he was professedly
engaged, nor the fact that this mission was replaced
by one of a totally different character, strengthening as
the circumstance does the conviction, which is gaining
ground in the public mind, that we have been deluded
in expending large sums of money in sending out relief
expeditions which were chiefly employed in exploring
available country for the benefit of the Government and
people of Queensland. The cost and the empty honour
have been ours, but theirs has been the substantial
gain.”
CHAPTER VII.
FREDERICK WALKER’S EXPEDITION.
The story of Walker’s expedition in search of the
Burke and Wills party is packed with interest to the
student of the story of Queensland’s development.
This enterprise was undertaken in conjunction with that
led by Landsborough. Between them a fund of fresh
information regarding hitherto unknown portions of the
great north-eastern portion of the continent was ren-
dered available. While Walker proceeded from Rock-
hampton overland to the steamer “Victoria,” Lands-
borough was landed from that craft and made in a
southerly direction, so as to be the first traveller to
cross the continent completely from north to south. As
already indicated, it was probably on account of depend-
ing upon what Walker already had done and was doing
in the way of discovering the missing party that caused
Landsborough to feel more at liberty to search for
pastoral country, or, at any rate, to devote so much of
his attention to the character of the land through which
he was passing.
A letter written by Governor Bowen of Queensland
to Governor Barkly of Victoria on July 19, 1861, states
that the Victorian Government had, through Captain
Mayne, of Sydney, arranged with Frederick Walker to
undertake the task which that gentleman carried out
with so much credit to himself and satisfaction to those
responsible for his appointment. The early administra-
tors of the Australian colonies were not always fortunate
in their selection of leaders to take parties into the
interior of the continent to clear up mysteries held in
those arid wilds, but the choice of Mr. Walker illus-
trated the exercise both of care and excellent judgment.
The gentleman was an experienced bushman, already
widely known by reason of his successful explorations
in the interior of Queensland, and of the tact with which
it was his custom to handle the natives. The intention
was that he was to take with him a party of mounted
aborigines, with whom he was to scour the country
intervening between Rockhampton and the Gulf. The
“Victoria,” having taken Landsborough’s party to that
point, was to remain at the mouth of the Albert River,
there providing a depot for both expeditions. No time
was to be lost by anyone on this enterprise. Had those
on whom Burke knowingly depended for relief in the
earlier stages of his undertaking displayed a small frac-
tion of the promptitude afterwards put forward by the
would-be rescuers of that unhappy leader, the tragic
story of impetuous error and shameful blundering would
never have been written.
Practically contemporaneously with the appoint-
ment of Walker, instructions were sent to Mr. Jardine,
of Rockhampton, to purchase twenty-seven horses, which
were to be kept in readiness till the remainder of the
plans for the start had been completed. Large supplies
of stores were purchased in Sydney and were sent north
as soon as a steamer could be secured to convey them to
the required destination. The speed with which pre-
liminary arrangements were completed is illustrated by
the journal of Walker himself. He writes:—“l re-
ceived Captain Mayne’s letter on August 6. I returned
that day forty miles to Bauhinia Downs; stopped her©
the next day to arrange matters with my friend, Mr.
Chas. B. Dutton; sent Patrick to collect my men, and
gave directions to Jack Horsfeldt to cure the meat for
the expedition. I then started for Rockhampton, but
when I reached the Dawson I could not get the horses
within twenty yards of the banks. Patrick cut a canoe


and I crossed. Meeting Mr. Govan at Rio, I exchanged
horses with him. I rode his to Rockhampton, and he
mine to the station. I hastened to get everything in
readiness, but found that only twelve horses had been
purchased. With the assistance of my friends, Mr.
Hutchinson and Captain Hunter, I made up my lot in
a few days, and started my whole party on Saturday,
August 25.”
The real start of the journey was made on Septem-
ber 7 —that is, a month and a day after Walker had
received his appointment. A westerly course was taken.
After travelling for nine days the party reached the
Nogoa, which was crossed three days later. The Barcoo
was reached on the 27th, the course of that stream being
followed for the subsequent three days. Here the
course was bending somewhat to the south. On October
5 an interesting discovery was made in the form of a
tree marked by Gregory, “XX11.,” and a few miles
away one marked with the letter “L,” apparently by
Leichhardt. This was in latitude 24° 34' and longitude
146° I'. Some miles further along the Barcoo was
another tree, which had been cut by Leichhardt. At
this point, which was about thirty miles south of lati-
tude 24° and on the 146th parallel of longitude, they
left the Barcoo and proceeded in a north-westerly direc-
tion towards the Alice. The grass in this region was
of such a nature that the horses gained considerably in
condition. A number of creeks were crossed, and the
country improved as the journey was continued. Near
the Alice, which was sighted on October 13, near
latitude 23°, very old tracks of horses were met with.
These were believed to have been left by Leichhardt’s
party, which at the time they were made apparently was
going down the Patrick Plains, lying between the Alice
and the Thomson. The latter was crossed on the 14th,
and a tributary of it was named the Coreena. Within
the next few days traces of Leichhardt’s expeditions
grew thicker. By October 16 mountainous country had
been reached, Mount Macalister and Mount Horsefall
both being named by Walker. The blacks in this region
were equipped with iron tomahawks, and a broad axe
was seen amongst them. It was evident that these
implements had come from Europeans. Other horse
tracks were also seen. Tracks had been discovered on
the banks of the Thomson.
The country continued to grow in interest, whilst
the pastoral possibilities appeared of a promising charac-
ter. Walker continued his north-westerly course, and
the country remained hilly. The headwaters of the
Barkly were met with at about latitude 21°. Mount
Gilbee, Mount Castor, and Mount Pollux were dis-
covered and named. This upper region of the Barkly
country was so well grassed that Walker believed that
the pastures he saw, coupled with the latitude of the
land, would provide a district as good for sheep-breeding
as any in Australia. From a point somewhat to the
north of latitude 21° and on longitude 144° a more
northerly course was struck. On November 10 they
came upon what they thought was the Flinders, but
which was but a tributary to that river. The beds of
numerous streams were passed over in this region, but
some were without water. The blacks were plentiful,
and were armed with long spears. On one occasion
they became particularly numerous and were deemed
by Walker to be so menacing in their demeanour that
he ordered his men to fire upon them. The result of
this unf-rtunate encounter was that twelve of the
aborigines were reported as having been killed and
many wounded. At this time the bed of the stream
was destitute of water, which, however, was obtained by
sinking in the sand.
Walker was now as far north as latitude 19°, and
the river he was following, and had mistaken for the
Flinders, was the Norman, which he named. Water
became so scarce that the lack of it presented a serious
difficulty, a few of the horses having to be abandoned.
The beds of several tributaries passed on the way proved
as destitute of water as was the Norman itself. On
November 6 another encounter took place with the
blacks, and again the conflict was marked with loss of
native lives. The aboriginal troopers, useful as they
had proved in other respects, certainly did not help to
establish harmonious relations with the inhabitants of
the country, being in need of continuous restraint when
coming into contact with their countrymen, to prevent
them firing upon the latter. As the coast was
approached, and the altitude of the country decreased,
the heat grew intense. Dry weather had rendered the
ground hard and easier to travel over than it would
have proved at other times of year, and in that respect
the conditions were favourable to rapidity of movement;
but feed was very scarce, and as the horses sweated pro-
fusely the difficulty of providing them with drink proved
a continuous source of anxiety to the leader. The
season being well into November the sun shone with
almost midsummer power, and the shade temperature
varied from 103° to 108° during the hot hours of the
days.
The bed of the Norman increased in size as the
party followed it down to where it joins the Flinders,
near the mouth of the latter. Several waterholes were
met with, and as these increased in frequency the main
difficulty which had troubled the travellers during the
immediate past began to vanish. On the 20th friendly
natives informed Walker that water would now be
found at short stages during the remainder of the jour-
ney to the coast. The soil was sandy and covered with
spinifex. Walker now believed the Norman to be a
tributary of the Gilbert. Certainly he was following
its course in a northerly direction, and had that course


been continued without deflection to the west the Gil-
bert would have been fallen in with. But the Flinders
reaches the Gulf at the extreme south-easterly corner
of that inland sea, whilst the Norman, at what now is
the town of Normanton, bends towards the low, man-
grove-clothed shore. Walker was not able to make the
natural features of the country about him agree with
the descriptions of Gregory, who had been on the Gil-
bert. Neither did the party fall in with the remains
of any of the camps of the earlier explorer, though
perhaps surprise could not be felt at the latter circum-
stance, seeing that sixteen years had elapsed since he
had passed that way. However, on the 23rd Walker
came upon a lagoon which in some way tallied with
Gregory’s description of where he had halted on Sep-
tember 11, 1845. Walker took this sheet of water for
the Bynoe, but in point of fact Gregory was never on
the Bynoe, which empties itself into the Gulf at a
point to the westward of the mouth of the Flinders.
He would have had to cross the latter stream to reach
it from the Gilbert. Two days later the party came
across the real junction of the Norman with the Flin-
ders, where it found a magnificent sheet of water
lying between high banks.
November 25 proved a momentous date for
Walker’s expedition. Besides the geographical discovery
brought forth on that date, the long-looked-for trail of
Burke and Wills was found. “At this camp,’’ wrote
Walker, referring to the day just mentioned, “latitude
18° 7', was found by Jingle the well-defined trail of
three or four camels and one horse. They had come
down the Flinders. This evening we supposed Burke
had gone down on Leichhardt’s track, intending prob-
ably to follow Gregory up the Gilbert. This night we
had a tremendous thunderstorm, the first heavy rain we
have had since starting from Bauhinia Downs, Mr.
Dutton’s station. Tuesday, November 26. —This morn-
ing Jemmy Cargara, in collecting the horses, found
Burke’s trail running across the plain and going S.S.E.
He has, therefore, I conclude, made back after having
seen the Gulf of Carpentaria towards the south again.
It is to be hoped Mr. Howitt has pushed far enough to
meet him with supplies. I hope to get rations from
Captain Norman to enable me to run his trail now
that I have found it. I shall be dreadfully disappointed
if the steamer has left, for I have barely enough to
carry me back, and it would be madness to follow Burke
south without an ample supply. Grateful Creek, and
the three large creeks crossed upon leaving it, are
evidently the heads of the Flinders, but the same
southerly bend which the main one took caused me to
cross it. The tableland is therefore the dividing range.
I suppose that Burke followed up the Barkly and
Stawell, and then cut across to the Flinders, not more
than twenty or thirty miles.’’
During the following day further evidence of Burke
having passed that way was discovered. This was in
the shape of two leaves discarded from his pocket-book.
The next day the party crossed a line of hills and
emerged upon plains stretching to the south and west
for as far as the eye could reach.
On the 29th Walker reached Morning Inlet and
twenty-eight hours later he was on the Leichhardt
River, to the west of longitude 140° and nearly a
degree and a half west of the junction of the Norman
and Flinders Rivers. Here another unfortunate brush
occurred with the natives. There appears little doubt
that tie liability to these taking place was accentuated
by the suspicious character of the black troopers. On
the last-mentioned occasion the exploring party found
itself riding into what appeared in the nature of an
ambush. In accordance with what was regarded as a
well-known hostile plan for receiving strangers, the
aborigines had formed themselves into half a moon-like
figure, so that the newcomers would approach its centre.
The intention seemed to be to partially surround an
unsuspecting and advancing enemy and concentrate an
attack with spears, so that every weapon might be used
with the maximum of effect. Owing to its similarity
with certain practices used in mustering cattle, the
squatters had come to habitually term this formation on
the part of the blacks as “stock-yarding.’’ There can be
no doubt that the discovery of the location and pre-
paredness of the natives created genuine alarm among
Walker’s party. Probably the retaliatory steps imme-
diately taken were well justified by the intentions of
the blacks. These were not men of the kindly tribes
of Central Australia which had succoured King and
helped poor Burke and Wills in their dying days. On
the north coast the natives were certainly more warlike
in their reception of strangers than was the case in
the south and in the interior. Nevertheless, seeing
how much more superior were the arms carried by his
men, in comparison with the rude implements of battle
used by their apparent foes, it is to be regretted that
Walker did not at least attempt to warn the aborigines
before launching an attack. Even were the most blood-
thirsty intentions entertained by the natives, the atti-
tude of those ignorant people, who were just as ignorant
of the feeling of the white men towards them as the
white men were of theirs, probably could have been
completely altered by efforts at mediation.
That Walker should have won the reputation he
had for tact and moderation in dealing with the blacks
tends to show a deplorable lack of humane consideration
and common sense on the part of others, rather than
any absolute proportion of those attributes in his own
composition. Doubtless where error of this kind was
committed under his command false information had
been given by the native troopers, Walker himself


being a man of kindly instincts and of courage. But
the fact remains that the hostile relations afterwards
existing between blacks and whites, and ultimately
resulting in the deaths of so many of the former, were
generated in the first place by the slaughter of the
ignorant savages before they were given any opportunity
of knowing that the strangers would not kill were they
not themselves menaced.
In the conflict of December 1 Walker’s men fell
upon the left wing of the half-moon-like formation into
which the natives had drawn themselves, and such was
the force of the attack that “the circular line doubled
up, the blacks turned and fled, but their centre and
left wing suffered heavy loss.”
The blacks about this neighbourhood were numer-
ous, and on the 2nd others were found. Among the
latter were further evidences of white men having been
lay over plains, but in other places it stretched across
flooded box flats, where necessarily the pace had to be
irritatingly slow. Six horses knocked up while attempt-
ing to cross this trying stage, and they had to be aban-
doned. Ultimately camp was laid at the same spot as
Gregory had once used for a like purpose.
Next day a start was made down the river. Not
many miles had been traversed before the statement
made by the natives was corroborated by independent
evidence. This took the shape of lettering cut with a
steel instrument on the trunk of a tree. The writing
read, “Victoria, Dep., 8 miles.” Four miles further
on the letter “V” was discovered to have been cut upon
another tree. Shortly after this fresh cause for
alarm of attack by blacks arose. On this occasion the
circumstances proved a good deal more terrifying than
they had been before, when Walker’s party was together

in the locality, though not of the Burke expedition. A
sailor’s coat and a cognac bottle were discovered at one
of their camps, and the natives told of a party of
civilized people being in considerable numbers on the
Albert River. This information served to brighten the
spirits of Walker and his followers, for doubtless the
strangers were of the steamer “Victoria,” and as they
had been recently in the district the chance of them
still waiting at the depot was increased. It was deter-
mined to lose no time in pushing on to where the ship
was likely to be found. The certainty that she had
actually reached her destination intensified the desire
to come upon her crew before they began the return
voyage to civilization.
The next day twenty-two miles were covered and
the Albert River reached. Nor was the country par-
ticularly suitable to fast travelling. Part of the route
and fully armed, so as to have been safe from any
serious injury. Walker and the native (Jingle) were
separated from the others, and the latter had only
two cartridges with him. An effort on the part of hostile
aborigines to cut them off was observed, and when an
attempt was made to escape Jingle’s horse knocked up.
Ultimately the camp was reached in safety, but the
escape had been narrow, and could not have been
effected but for the fortunate protection afforded in the
shape of a screen to the men’s movements by a belt of
timber.
Other signs of the passage of white men were now
found, nor were they confined to signals left for the
purposes of guidance by the short expeditions made
into the interior by parties from the "Victoria.” One
tree had been marked by Gregory. On another the
word “Dig” had been cut under the direction of Captain


Norman. Removal of the soil at this place revealed a
bottle containing a paper, on which were directions of
the camp depot’s locality, which was only twelve miles
away. The most favourable news of all was contained
in the date of the note, which was November 29, or a
week before its discovery. Next day the two parties
joined, three months and twelve days having been occu-
pied in the march from Rockhampton.
Thus was completed a most successful journey
across unknown country, during which the rapidity of
the pace maintained throughout had not interfered
with most careful observations being made and records
being kept of the various features of interest met with
along the route. The primary object of the enterprise,
which was to discover the tracks of Burke and his
party, had been accomplished, whilst immense public
interest attached to the data collected of the nature of
the territory in a most promising portion of the con-
tinent which had not previously been crossed by civilized
man. Walker’s next task lay in following up the tracks
he had discovered. As pronouncedly as delay had
characterized the management of some others in respon-
sible positions concerned in the Burke enterprise, so did
promptness of decision and alacrity of movement stamp
the practice of Walker. After remaining thirteen days
at the depot—a period necessary to resting his party,
as well as to prepare for the formidable undertaking of
attempting to follow Burke’s tracks, wherever they
should lead—the expedition returned to the Flinders
on December 20. But in so far as they bore upon the
discovery of the band of lost explorers, Walker’s subse-
quent efforts were doomed to disappointment. The
months elapsing since Burke reached the waters of the
Gulf were sufficient to involve the obliteration of marks
made on the surface of the ground by the passing
travellers. That country was not like the arid interior,
where years might pass without alteration to the surface
of the soil. In the far north regularly recurring seasons
brought heavy tropical rains, and very much of the
country was subject to inundation. These visitations
were followed by a growth of vegetation more rank and
luxuriant than anything to be found in any part of the
southern division of the continent. No one with know-
ledge of the coastal portion of the Gulf climate would
expect any tracks to survive the rainy season in that
territory with sufficient distinctness to enable them to
be followed with any degree of certainty. Yet Walker
was wonderfully successful in being able to trace the
lost leader as far as he did. Picking up the traces
where he had last seen them at the junction of the
Flinders and the Norman Rivers, he was able to trace
the route Burke had taken until reaching some distance
south of latitude 19°.
The country passed over here was composed mostly
of sandstone hills of small altitude, interspersed with
creeks and salt swamps. This type of country stretched
to the Leichhardt River, to the westward of the 140th
degree of longitude. Farther southward than the point
indicated the country consists of open, well-grassed
plains, subject to frequent flooding. All traces of
Burke were completely lost here, nor could any efforts
of the blacks pick them up again. Walker was con-
vinced, however, that Burke had turned eastward, more
to the centre of Queensland. The search for further
signs of the route of the vanished explorers was conse-
quently bent in that direction.
Late in January Walker was upon the route he
had followed on the outward journey. On the 26th
he came to a tree on which he had marked the date
November 16. Three days later he found a horse
abandoned on the journey to the Gulf, and next day
two more were picked up. The search for Burke’s
tracks was being continued unavailingly, but on Feb-
ruary 1 it was abandoned as hopeless. A course was
then taken 33° east of north. For the next five days
good country was met with—hilly, but intersected with
numerous valleys and running streams. On the sth
the following bearings were taken: —“A very high
tableland, the northern end of which bore compass by
15° E. of N., called Mount Barry, after Sir Redmund
Barry, of Victoria. Two remarkable peaks, one bear-
ing 52° E. of N., Mount Orestes; the other bearing
55° E. of N., Mount Pylades. A queer-looking range,
which we accordingly named Mount Queer, bore 65°
E. of N. A range in the middle of the valley, 35°
E. of N., and a remarkable peak in the distance, Mount
Picken, after an old friend, Captain Picken.” Heavy
rain fell at this time, and the party was detained here
for some days. The straying of the horses also rendered
delay necessary. But five days later they were near
Mount Orestes, and ascending to some very high coun-
try they came upon what was judged to be an excellent
pastoral region. A very fine view of the surrounding
district was obtained from here. The party was now
travelling rapidly, and but few observations of latitude
and longitude were made, so that Walker himself
frequently did not know just where he was, or whether
hills and streams he came across were those bearing
certain names given them by other explorers or not.
Precisely where he was at certain stages of the journey
can now only be guessed at.
Owing partly to the rough nature of the ground
traversed, and the heavy work involved in the long
stages covered between resting-places, the journey was
telling sorely upon the horses, a number of which had
become lame. On February 17 ten of them had to be
abandoned. To make matters worse, the boots of the
party had given out. Walker himself was equipped
only with an old pair given to him by Captain Norman.
Observations taken on the 20th showed them to be in


latitude 18° 57'. They were now in the high country
about what is marked on modern maps as the Gregory
Range, and as they approached the valley of the
Burdekin they came across a tributary to the Copper-
field, to which Walker gave the name of the Quartz,
because of the abnormal quantity of reefs of that rock
to be seen in the neighbourhood. The leader, however,
describes the country lying to the northward to be of
basaltic formation, and he says that, should the climate
prove not unsuitable, the conditions generally should
favour sheep farming. Considerable hardship was
being suffered by the party, meat being so badly needed
that three wild ducks and two opossums which were
procured were referred to as luxuries. But a supply
of dried apples appeared to ward off attacks of scurvy
in all except one man, named Maoalister, and except for
fatigue the men remained in good health. Heavy rain
added considerably
to the disabilities
being fought by
the expedition, and
the route lay over
a series of ridges,
which greatly im-
peded progress.
The 24th found
the party still
struggling through
torrents of rain,
shoeless, and with
only a few lame
horses to help
with the baggage.
On this day the
river called the
Yananoa by the
natives was fallen
in with. From
here, till the Burdekin was reached on March 8,
the expedition scrambled over stony hills and floundered
through water-logged gullies, on the way passing the
Clarke, an important tributary to the Burdekin. The
Clarke is a continuation of the Gregory River. Re-
ferring to this portion of the journey, Walker, after
describing some good plains found further to the east-
ward, writes: —“But on the Burdekin I noticed a very
bad description of grass wherever the slate is. It reached
a height of from six to nine feet, and is surmounted by
the worst grass seed I have ever seen. The pain caused
by a wound from this grass seed is exactly like that
from the bite of a soldier-ant.” Soon after leaving the
Burdekin River two other streams were crossed, the
first of these being of formidable size and presenting no
small difficulty in crossing, the bed being filled with
basaltic rocks, over which the weakened horses stumbled
as they floundered in the water. The next river was
smaller, and was chiefly notable for the quantity of
slatestone lying in its bed. The name of Slate River
consequently was bestowed upon the stream.
The party now travelled down the Burdekin, the
country proving extremely rough and difficult to cross.
The few remaining horses had become almost useless,
whilst provisions had been nearly entirely exhausted,
all that was left being a few dried apples, a little sugar,
and some polluted flour. Such fare as these commodi-
ties provided was supplemented by a diet of native
cucumbers, of which the supply was plentiful. Mac-
alister’s scurvy had grown worse, and the whole party
was walking on feet almost bare. Fortunately the
river was plentifully stocked with fish, and an emu was
obtained. The party was comparatively close to the east
coast and had nearly reached civilization, but the men’s
plight was fairly
desperate. As a
means to shorten-
ing their troubles,
if not escaping a
fate which might
be even more seri-
ous, Walker split
his party in two,
sending ahead Mac-
alister and some
others with the
seven horses best
able to travel. The
leader remained
behind with the
main body. On the
24th he crossed
what he took to be
the Fanning River,
which j oins the
Burdekin on the 20th degree of longitude. On the 4th
of the following month he overtook Macalister, who
was only four miles from Wood and Robinson’s station,
“Strathalbyn.” Here a hearty welcome was extended
to the sorely-tried explorers, who had just completed so
difficult and so successful an expedition in so brilliant
a way. Walker hurried on to what is now Bowen for
such supplies as would enable him to send back for the
horses he had abandoned, as these had amounted, by
the time a settlement was reached, to twenty head.
When these had been gathered up a start was made for
Rockhampton, which was reached on June 5.
Thus ended one of the most creditably-managed
expeditions undertaken during the days of Australian
exploration. Perhaps the signal success with which
Mr. Walker accomplished his purpose, as well as throw-
ing a flood of valuable light upon the nature of the
CUTTING SUGER CANE AT BLI BLI, NAMBOUR.


interior of Queensland, was due to Iris strict adhesion
to instructions. He had been sent out to search for
traces of Burke, and the primary object of the task in
hand was never once permitted to take a secondary
place. Much information of another character was
made available for public service, but its collection had
been incidental only to the main purpose on hand. The
party had travelled quickly, because if Burke were still
in a position to benefit from assistance then aid must
be rendered without delay if not to prove too late. And
the route chosen had been that which the lost Irishman
appeared as most likely to have followed. But it so
happened that Walker’s course was such as to afford
considerable industrial result of a beneficial character to
the community, and the business-like efficiency with
which all the arrangements connected with the under-
taking were carried out enabled the enterprise to be
accomplished without loss of life or needless expense.
CHAPTER VIII.
JOHN KING HONOURED.
Of til© many demonstrations of public sentiment
regarding the fate of Burke and Wills, tire most
typical and illuminating was provided at the ordinary
meeting of the Royal Society of Victoria, held
on August 18, 1862. This was numerously attended,
and the Governor (Sir Henry Barkly), who was presi-
dent, occupied the chair. The following account is
taken from the Melbourne daily Press.
The first business was the presentation to John
King, the survivor, of the gold watch awarded him by
the Royal Geographical Society. The secretary, at the
request of the president, read the following extract from
a private letter from Sir Roderick Murchison, the pre-
sident of the Royal Geographical Society, dated May 20,
1862: —“I told you in my last that I thought it
probable we should grant one of our gold medals to the
family of Burke, and I am happy to announce to you
that at the last meeting of the council the award was
made as I anticipated, on my own proposition, strength-
ened as it was by your favourable opinion. We also
give to the good and intrepid King a gold watch, with
an inscription. The Duke of Newcastle has promised
to attend and receive these donations on the 26th.
P.S. (June 23). —The watch sent to King cost much
more than the gold medal, and I hope the good soldier
will like it.” The secretary next read the following
despatch from His Grace the Duke of Newcastle to
Governor Sir Henry Barkly:—“Downing Street, May
26, 1862, Sir—l have to acquaint you that this morn-
ing I attended the annual meeting of the Royal
Geographical Society, and that at the request of the
president (Lord Ashburton) I undertook to forward to
you the accompanying gold watch, which the president
and council had determined to present to John King,
in testimony of his meritorious conduct during the late
Victorian exploring expedition, in which Messrs. Burke
and Wills unfortunately lost their lives. I have, there-
fore, to request that you will accordingly, on behalf of
the president and council, place this watch in the hands
of John King, and that you will at the same time
express to him the satisfaction it has been to me to be
the channel of making known to him that his conduct
has been appreciated as it deserves.—l have the honour
to be, etc., Newcastle.”
His Excellency, addressing John King, spoke as
follows:-—I feel, Mr. King, that it would be almost
superfluous on my part to add much to the encomiums
passed upon you by such high authorities, and to one
so modest as I know you are I dare say it would be
even painful if I were to enter at any length upon a
recital of the claims which I consider you possess upon
the gratitude and admiration of your fellow-colonists.
(Hear, hear.) Gratifying as it must be to you—after
the liberal honours and rewards which the Legislature
and people of Victoria have bestowed upon you—to
receive this crowning mark of recognition of your ser-
vices from your fellow-countrymen at home, I can
quite conceive that it would be more congenial to your
own feelings if I had delivered it to you in my own
private room. Still, I felt it to be a matter of duty, on
an occasion of this kind, to make the ceremony as public
as possible, not only in justice to yourself, but for the
sake of the example which your conduct has afforded to
all who may be placed in similarly trying circumstances.
I feel sure that, even if you entertained any idea of
surviving, nothing was further from your thoughts than
any considerations of glory or honour when you knelt
by the side of the dying Burke to receive his last injunc-
tions, or when you turned back to perform the last sad
offices for your departed comrade, Wills. You did your
duty, I am sure, simply because you felt it was your
duty. A Christian, you knew it was a privilege to
minister to suffering humanity; a soldier, you never
dreamt of swerving from the unalterable fidelity which
you knew you owed your leader. (Applause.) In such
a trying position as that in which you were placed,
with the bands of discipline relaxed, the instincts of self-
preservation have often led men to act selfishly. Others


in your position might have thought that, being stronger
than the rest of the party—able, perhaps, to pursue the
game, catch fish, or pound nardoo—it would have been
consistent with duty to escape to the nearest settlement
perhaps with the vague idea of sending back assistance
to your comrades. I feel satisfied that any thought of
deserting never crossed your mind; that you abandoned
all desire to serve yourself alone, and that you were
determined to share the fate of your companions. The
result has proved that you acted rightly and properly.
Your example may serve to teach us that “the path of
duty,” generally, under Providence, is “the path of
safety.” And what is about to take place to-night will
also teach us another lesson, “That duty never did yet
want its meed.” (Applause.) I may just refer to the
fortunate circumstances that our meeting should be
graced by the presence of a gentleman who, partly from
motives of humanity and partly with a view to share in
the glory of the enterprise, volunteered to lead one of
the subsidiary expeditions sent in search of the missing
expedition of which you formed a member. Those sub-
sidiary expeditions, it is well known, have led to a great
increase in our geographical knowledge of the interior
of the continent, and, I believe, among the most bril-
liant exploits which grace the history of Australian
exploration, there is not one more brilliant to be found
than the passage made by the party under our friend,
Mr. Landsborough, from the shores of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria to the Darling River. (Applause.) I hope
Mr. Landsborough will be kind enough to-night to give
us some information as to his route on that occasion.
We all know, without waiting for that explanation,
that his journey has conferred a most substantial benefit
on all these colonies. It has, there can be no doubt,
very much accelerated the formation of a great settle-
ment in North Australia, which may be expected to
become some day a separate and independent colony.
In fact, it has formed a fitting addition to the noble
efforts which have been made by this colony in the
cause of Australian exploration. Those efforts, as we
all know, are not about to terminate. Instructions
have been despatched to Mr. Howitt to return as
speedily as possible, and when he brings back the
remains of the lamented explorers, Burke and Wills,
we shall approach the closing scene of the great drama—
or tragedy, as I believe I may call it. I trust on that
occasion the public funeral promised to those brave men
will be carried out with the enthusiasm which was
manifested a year ago, and that active exertions will
be used by all concerned to raise an appropriate monu-
ment to their memory. (Hear, hear.) I have now
great pleasure in handing King, on the part of the
Royal Geographical Society of London, this watch,
which bears within, as he will find, an inscription set-
ting forth that it was “Presented by the President and
Council of the Royal Geographical Society of London
to John King, for his meritorious conduct in the expe-
dition under the lamented Burke and Wills.” (Great
applause.)
John King, who seemed overpowered with emotion,
replied in the following terms: —May it please your
Excellency, it affords me much grateful satisfaction to
receive this watch which the Royal Geographical Society
of London has been pleased to present to me in recog-
nition of my services during the late Victorian exploring
expedition, and particularly to the lamented Mr. Burke
in his last moments. In these particulars, your Excel-
lency, I consider that I simply did my duty—a duty
that I would perform over again if I were similarly
placed. (Applause.) Still, it is a source of grateful
satisfaction to me to know that our achievement has
been properly appreciated by the British Government
and the great scientific bodies, and also that my humble
services have been appreciated by the Royal Geogra-
phical Society, and by His Grace the Duke of Newcastle.
I beg, through your Excellency, most respectfully to
thank his Grace and the Royal Geographical Society for
their recognition of my services. Such recognition will
always convince me that no man under this or any
Government will do his duty without meeting his
reward. (Great applause.)
His Excellency then introduced Mr. Landsborough
to the meeting, and intimated that that gentleman
would give a narrative of his expedition. His Excel-
lency also introduced two aborigines who had accom-
panied Mr. Landsborough from Carpentaria.
Mr. Landsborough said that he had much pleaseure
in meeting the Royal Society, and he was much gratified
with the reception that had been accorded to him. His
expedition had been the second to cross the continent
of Australia from Carpentaria, and he had been for-
tunate in finding a good road. Through the liberality
of the Royal Society he had a first-rate outfit at Bris-
bane. Unfortunately, the transport “Firefly,” which
conveyed himself and party from Brisbane, was wrecked
on Hardy Island. However, a few later they were
relieved by Captain Norman, of the “Victoria.”
Through the exertions of Captain Norman, his officers,
and crew, the “Firefly” was towed off the reef, and
the horses were reshipped and taken on to Carpentaria.
It had been supposed hitherto that the Albert River was
not a good place for landing horses, but the “Firefly,”
a vessel of 200 tons, went twenty miles up that river
and the horses were landed without difficulty. In fact,
they walked ashore. He was delighted to find so fine
a country. He had had twenty years’ experience of
Australia, and he had never seen better country for
stock than he found on the shores of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria. His mission was to search for Burke and
his companions, but he could not shut his eyes to the


fact that there was a fine country before them, and
that country lying idle—a country which, through the
exertions of Burke and his companions, had been opened
to the world. (Hear, hear.) The pastoral interest was
a great interest still in Australia, and he held it to be a
great pity that the stock of the country should be
boiled down for tallow when Australia was the finest
country in the world for growing wool. He hoped that
the discoveries made through the instrumentality of the
Royal Society would tend to prevent this. He would
now point out the route which he took in the search for
Burke and his party. In his first expedition he pro-
ceeded in the direction of Central Mount Stuart, with
the view of trying to discover whether Burke had gone
on Stuart’s route. He succeeded in travelling about
210 miles, the first 100 of which he followed up a rim-
ing stream, but after leaving its source he lost much
time from the scarcity of water. For this reason, and
the precious loss of time caused by the wreck of the
“Firefly,” he deemed it prudent to return to the depot.
This course was adopted with much regret, as the wet
season had commenced, a continuance of which for two
or three weeks would probably have enabled him to
have pursued the route originally intended in search of
the traces of Burke. His first impression regarding the
stream referred to was that it was created by rain, but
as it was evident that no rain had fallen for months
be concluded that his idea was incorrect. He afterwards
discovered that it owed its source to springs of a kind
which he had never before met with, the stream from
which, near its source in the valley of the Gregory
River, was sufficiently powerful to turn a large mill
wheel. On his route back to the depot he found that
this stream, at a point distant from Carpentaria about
eighty miles, divided into two branches, one of which
flowed into the Nicholson River and the other into the
Albert. As an evidence of the superior quality of the
country through which he passed on his expedition to
the south-west, he might mention that the horses tra-
velled as well as if they had been stable-fed. He had
travelled in Queensland and New South Wales, and had
never found horses stand work as well as those horses
did at Carpentaria. On returning to the depot, he and
his party rested for three weeks, and again started to
find the tracks of Burke and his companions. They had
heard that tracks had been seen by Mr. Walker on tne
Flinders River. They tried to follow Walker’s tracks
to the Flinders River, but although he had preceded
them only by about two months his traces could not be
followed, owing to the rain which had fallen. They
proceeded to the Flinders, but they could find no signs
of Burke. They followed up the river for about 280
miles through a magnificent country. When they
reached this point they left the Flinders, and in less
than twenty miles further got to the watershed of the
Thomson, one of the main heads of the Cooper River.
When they had proceeded about 100 miles down the
valley of the Thomson they found a tree which had
been marked by a companion of Landsborough’s in a
former expedition several years before, which he was
glad to be able to show as a proof of his knowledge of
the country to the members of his party, who knew
nothing of him till about a week or ten days befoie
he started on the expedition. They followed down
the valley of the Thomson, through fine country, from
the tree referred to, to a point within 270 miles from
Burke’s depot at Cooper River, and they were most
desirous to go to that place, but their supplies were very
limited and the blacks had repeatedly told them through
Jemmy, one of the party, who understood their lan-
guage, that they had not seen any exploring parties with
camels. They, therefore, deemed it the better plan to
strike across about fifty miles to the Barcoo, the main
head of the Cooper River. This they accordingly did,
and then proceeded to the Warrego, which they followed
down till they struck the Darling. On reaching settled
country they were sorry to hear of the melancholy fate
of Burke, Wills, and Gray. They were hospitably
received by the settlers; but the season was dry, and
their horses fared much worse on the Darling.
In reply to questions, Mr. Landsborough said he
thought the Flinders River was about 500 miles long.
The most elevated land on that stream appeared to be
about 1,000 to 1,500 feet high. The climate of Car-
pentaria be believed to be very dry, excepting in the
months of January, February, March, and April. The
bed of the Flinders, when he left it, was 120 yards wide,
with a shallow stream flowing along its surface. His
party came through the country at a very favourable
season of the year. Thunderstorms and rainy weather
might be expected until the end of April, and some-
times as late as May. On the heads of the Gregory
River the country was of a basaltic character, and on
the Flinders there was abundance of quartz and iron-
bark country. He saw about fifty miles of the latter
description of country, and believed from his previous
knowledge that it extended to the coast. The range
dividing the Flinders from the Cooper River country
he estimated to be from 1,000 to 1,500 feet high, while
that which he crossed on his expedition to the south-
west, though about the same height, was of quite a
different character, being composed of a basalt different
from any he had seen before. The slopes of the table-
land were grassed with spinifex, which was almost
worthless. All basaltic country he had seen previously
in other parts of Australia was exceedingly well grassed.
He had no doubt that the rivers on the north side of
Barkly Tableland were supplied by springs. Barkly
Tableland divided the northern from the southern
waters. He had crossed it on his first expedition. He


had never been to the west of the Thomson. Imme-
diately after leaving the watershed of the Flinders he
got on to that of the Thomson. On returning to the
Albert from his expedition to the south-west he came
to a river which he named O’Shanassy, which had long
and deep reaches of water. In the waterholes on the
southern side of Barkly Tableland, which he followed
down for seventy miles, he found plenty of fish, and his
impression was that these fish came up from the rivers
further to the south-west. It was the dry season when
he was there, but he could see traces of water where
it had spread for several miles across the country in the
wet season. He had no doubt that if he had been able
to go fuither down he should have got to a large river.
Ur. Mueller observed that this seemed to augur well
for any expeditions that might be undertaken from the
south of the Gulf of Carpentaria to the south-west. He
begged to ask whet-
her, in following
down the tributaries
of the Thomson,
Mr. Landsborough
met with any traces
of Dr. Leichhardt ?
It would appear,
from the informa-
tion supplied by
Mr. Walker, that
Leichhardt took
the tributaries of
the Thomson in
order to be able
to skirt the desert
of Captain Sturt.
Mr. Landsbor-
ough said he had
gone from near
Port Denison to
the heads of the Thomson River some years before,
and the probability was, he thought, that Mr.
Walker saw his tracks or those of Cornish and
Buchanan, who had also gone from Rockhampton to
the heads of the Thomson. The party of Mr. Peter
McDonald, a Victorian, also had gone from Rockhamp-
ton to the southern side of the range several years
before. In his (Mr. Landsborough’s) first expedition
he endeavoured to find Leichhardt’s tracks on the heads
of the Thomson, but unsuccessfully.
Dr. Ilfia asked whether Mr. Landsborough, in the
course of his brilliant journey across the country had
met with many tribes of natives, and whether they
evinced a friendly or hostile disposition 1
Mr. Landsborough did not admit that it was a
brilliant journey. (Laughter.) He saw very few
blacks. The largest number he saw at a time was about
thirty. He saw no tracks of blacks, and he could not
imagine that they were numerous. He always avoided
having much intercourse with them. He seldom had
any trouble with them until this expedition. On the
Barcoo River a number of blacks, who had previously
appeared most friendly, approached the camp in the
middle of the night, and but for the watchfulness of
Jemmy might have knocked them on the head. They
were driven away, but the next morning they appeared
disposed to attack the party. Under those circum-
stances he was obliged to fire upon them. One volley
and a few shots, however, were sufficient to get rid of
them. He came upon the Flinders above the navigable
point. The range which he crossed to the south-west
of Carpentaria was a tableland. That between the
Flinders and the Thomson consisted of a series of
hills and mountains, with passes between them, as
Mr. Walker had
described in his
journal.
His Excellency
inquired what were
Mr. Landsborough’s
impressions and
ideas of the shores
of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, with
reference to the
settlement there of
Europeans at any
future time ?
Mr. Landsbor-
ough replied that,
although living in
the open air and not
having the best of
food, the country
agreed admirably
with him. While his party and the crew of
the “Victoria” were at Carpentaria there was very
little sickness among them, nor was there fever or
ague. The shores were very level. There was nothing
that could be called a hill for 60 or 100 miles. Although
a very dry country, there was rain for about three
months in the year, and there were, in some seasons,
large floods. He did not reach the Flinders River until
two or three months after Walker’s party, and he could
not find Burke’s tracks. He considered he could not
be expected to find them, since Mr. Walker, a gentle-
man whose great perseverance and bush experience were
well known, who was there two months before, with a
larger party than his and twice the equipment, could
not follow them up. He could not even find Walker’s
tracks. He believed it was impossible for Burke and
V ills to have come within sight of the sea, because

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


saltwater creeks spread all over the country for ten miles
from the shore. This was his opinion from what he saw
at the mouth of the Albert, and he had no doubt that
the mouth of the Finders was of the same character.
His Excellency said he was sure that they all felt
very much obliged to Mr. Landsborough for the cheerful
alacrity with which he had replied to all questions, and
the amount of information about his journey which he
had laid before the meeting.
The society then adjourned.
Another historic meeting of the citizens of Mel-
bourne was held soon after at the Exhibition Building
in honour of the leaders of the Queensland and South
Australian Contingent Exploration Expeditions and
their parties, and to testify the admiration of the
inhabitants of Victoria "at the successful and heroic
manner in which these explorers had accomplished their
mission.” The doors were advertised to be open at
seven o’clock, but it was not until about twenty minutes
past that hour that they were unlocked. In the mean-
time a vast crowd, which had commenced to assemble
as early as half-past six, had gathered in front of the
building and manifested considerable impatience to be
admitted. Within a very few minutes after the doors
were thrown open the hall was densely crowded in every
part. There were about 3,000 persons present. The
following account is based on the Press reports :
On the motion of Dr. Macadam, the Hon. Matthes
Hervey, M.L.C., was called upon to preside. He was
surrounded on the platform by several members of the
Exploration Committee and other gentlemen. Mr.
Landsborough and Mr. M’Kinlay, and some members
of their respective exploring parties, were present, as
was also Mr. King, the companion of the unfortunate
Burke and Wills, and Mr. C. Verdon, the successful
bearer of despatches from the Exploration Committee to
Mr. Howitt.
The chairman, in opening the proceedings, con-
gratulated the assembly upon having met together to
pay a mark of respect to their distinguished fellow-
countrymen, Messrs. Landsborough and M’Kinlay.
(Applause.) They were doubtless aware of the circum-
stances under which those gentlemen had become con-
spicuous amongst the Australian community. Imme-
diately upon the discovery of any danger attending the
Victorian explorers, Messrs. Burke and Wills—upon
discovering that there was a possibility of their being
unable to surmount the difficulties which surrounded
them in the desert—it was thought desirable to start
contingent expeditions from the neighbouring colonies,
as well as from Victoria, in search of them. The people
of Melbourne had assembled that evening to congratu-
late those distinguished gentlemen, Messrs. Lands-
borough and M’Kinlay, upon their safe return from
their expeditions. They had most cheerfuly volunteered
their services to the respective Governments under
which they lived to proceed in search of Burke and
Wills, and everyone was aware to some extent of the
result of their labours. They had been most successful
explorers. They had proceeded in cheerfulness to en-
counter the dangers of the desert, such as in the eye of
every individual unaccustomed to bush travelling seemed
insurmountable. (Hear, hear.) They had all heard
something of Mr. Landsborough’s expedition from the
statement which he had made before the Royal Society,
and they knew something also of the expedition under-
taken by Mr. M’Kinlay. The immense difficulties which
each had experienced placed both gentlemen side by
side as great and successful explorers. (Cheers.)
Having briefly directed attention to the circumstances
under which the meeting had assembled, he would detain
them very little longer. He was sure that they had
done their duty as inhabitants of Victoria in meeting
to welcome back again to the colony the gentlemen who
had been sent out in search of those who first crossed
the continent of Australia, and brought into conspicu-
ous notice the great enterprise, which was first initiated
in Victoria, of exploring the whole of this vast conti-
nent. (Applause.)
The Rev. Dr. Cairns, who was called upon to move
the first resolution, remarked that this was a magnificent
meeting, and that he had seldom been more delighted in
the course of his long life. (Applause.) When Mr.
M’Kinlay was received by the Royal Society, he (Dr.
Cairns) made the very natural remark that he supposed
he would receive a welcome from the public of Mel-
bourne—(hear, hear) —that, cordial might be
the welcome extended to him and to Mr. Landsborough
by private committees or private societies, the commu-
nity at large had a right to express their feelings. A
very ill-natured notice of his opinion and conduct in
the matter appeared in The Argus of that morning, but
for what purpose it had been written he was unable to
say. He rejoiced in the present meeting, however, as the
best of all possible characteristic signs of the present age
was the very great progress of discovery in opening up
regions of the earth which had hitherto been hermetic-
ally sealed even to the eye of intelligence. It was a
very suggestive fact, to his mind, that the successful
exploration of Central Africa and the great Australian
continent had been reserved for the present day—that
until now these immense dominions had been unknown
lands to the civilized world, and that not until the
latter half of the nineteenth century had the honour
been conferred on the enterprising sons of that wonder-
ful little island far away in the North Sea, peopled by
Christian Britons, of penetrating the mystery and find-
ing out that, instead of stony deserts and inhospitable
wilds, those countries contained luxuriant fields, abun-
dant waters, and balmy woods—inviting homes for


millions and millions of human beings, or, rather, let
him say, for flourishing nations. (Applause.) The
present marked a great era in the history of this hemi-
sphere. A benignant Providence had lifted the cloud
of their ignorance, and they heard a kindly voice calling
upon them to arise, to go forth, to possess, to subdue, to
people this goodly land. (Hear, hear.) The friends
whose success they had met to celebrate that evening
would henceforth have their names enrolled with those
of Mitchell, Leichhardt, Sturt, Gregory, and Burke
and Wills, who had sacrificed their lives to their zeal.
(Hear, hear.) To the last named explorers belonged the
praise—which time would never obscure or diminish—
of having been first to solve the practicability of travers-
ing this great continent from south to north. The
names which he mentioned constituted a brilliant cata-
logue, and he ventured to think that no inferior
Landsborough and M’Kinlay. They had undertaken
and accomplished great things. Without deliberation
they undertook the arduous task assigned to them, and
faced its hazards. They had to contemplate hard priva-
tions, and, it might be, disease, accident, or even a
lingering and lonely death. These were the terms —the
necessary terms—on which they engaged in their uncer-
tain and perilous speculation. They went forth not
knowing whither they went; but their Heavenly Father
watched over them and protected them from dangers,
seen and unseen. He was especially struck with the
providence of God in the case of M’Kinlay. The flood
of waters which troubled him might have been a deluge
to sweep him away, but by the gracious over-ruling
providence of God his life was preserved and he was
now in their midst. Both Landsborough and M’Kinlay
had returned none the worse for wear, but fresh and

splendour would henceforth illustrate the names —now
familiar as household words —of Stuart, Landsborough,
and M’Kinlay. (Cheers, and loud cries of “King.”)
The name of King ought almost assuredly to be
included. (Cheers.) They were a noble band, and he
wished they had all been present that night. He re-
joiced to have the opportunity of seeing those explorers
who were present, of looking on their faces, speaking
to them, shaking hands with them, and calling them
friends. (Applause.) He was proud of these men, and
all whom he was addressing must be proud of them also.
They were worthy of esteem, they were entitled to
applause; and mean, base, ineffably shabby—stupidly
mean and base —was the soul, if such a soul there were,
that questioned their merit or grudged them a meet
reward. (Applause.) He was delighted to have the
opportunity of looking upon the two great heroes,
K
blooming, he would say, for the tan which they got
from the sun seemed to him to be the richest of blooms.
(Laughter.) They were the very models of fine, stal-
wart men. He thanked God for it, who was the author
of all their talents and all their gifts. Their wonderful
success, under God, was attributable to their foresight,
prudence, and, for want of a better word, he would say
their bush experience. From the energy, sagacity, and
unwearied patience which they had exercised the public
had learnt some new things. From Mr. M’Kinlay they
had learnt that it was possible to drive a flock of silly
sheep all the way to Carpentaria, and eat them up, one
by one, at leisure. (Laughter.) They had further
learnt that old horse was very palatable beef to a hungry
man, and that boiled camel was a savoury morsel in a
weary wilderness. (Renewed laughter.) From Mr.
Landsborough they had learnt the important lesson that


it was most wise to rest and refresh both man and beast
upon that seventh day which had been ordained as a
universal blessing. (Hear, hear.) lie quite enjoyed
hearing of Mr. Landsborough and his men luxuriating
on a breakfast of meat and pig-weed, followed, after a
due interval, by an epicurean dinner of cold rice and
jam. (Laughter.) The result of their explorations
had been immense, for they had probably tripled, or
even quadrupled, the extent of territory in Australia
available for settlement, and added greatly to the
resources of the country. The advantages thus secured
for pastoral purposes were beyond all calculation, though
they could not now be appreciated as they would be
hereafter. They deserved well of their country. In
all ages such services as they had rendered had been
regarded as national benefactions. The principle of the
State rewarding such services had been recognized in
the colony, and had been reduced to practice. Recom-
pense was decreed by Parliament to the discoveries of
new goldfields, and the admirable constitution of the
colony had provided a most soothing consolation, in the
shape of £I,BOO per annum, to requite the devotion of
those self-sacrificing spirits who consented to bow their
studious heads and delicate shoulders to the responsi-
bilities of Government for the weary space of two whole
years. (Laughter.) If such were the case, what was
the debt which the country owed to those great national
benefactors—the explorers ? Their discoveries had
opened the eyes of the people of Australia to the fact
that God had given them a most wealthy inheritance,
which might be compared to the whole world in minia-
ture. It had the best of every clime under the sun,
and the gifts of Nature were scattered with great pro-
fusion. As to the precious metals, it might turn out
that what had been found was only an earnest of what
was to follow; but there could be no doubt that Austra-
lia was to be the wool-grower of the whole world, and
that it would grow cotton to feed all the mills of England.
Dr. Cairns concluded by moving the following resolu-
tion :
“That this meeting begs, in the most cordial
manner, to welcome the explorers, Messrs.
Landsborough and M’Kinlay, on their safe
return, and to express admiration of the
many excellent qualities displayed by them
in the prosecution of their arduous enter-
prise, and considers that it is a duty to
acknowledge the hand of Divine Providence
in preserving them in the midst of danger.”
Mr. King, who was received with great acclamation,
said it afforded him much pleasure to be present on
that occasion and join with so many of his fellow-
colonists in congratulating Mr. Landsborough and Mr.
M’Kinlay on their safe arrival in Melbourne. (Ap-
plause.) He was the more glad to offer his
congratulations because he knew the arduous nature of
the journey which Messrs. Landsborough and M Kinlay
had accomplished. He was little accustomed to appear or
to speak in public, but he should have been sorry to
miss this opportunity of expressing his thanks to Mr.
Landsborough and Mr. M’Kinlay for the manner in
which they had endeavoured to come to the relief of the
party of which Burke and Wills were at the head.
However successful they might have been in that expe-
dition, they could have been of very little service to
Burke and Wills, for it would have been impossible
to reach them in time to save their lives. He had much
pleasure in seconding the resolution and in congratulat-
ing Messrs. Landsborough and M’Kinlay upon their
safe arrival in Victoria. (Cheers.)
The resolution was put and unanimously adopted
amidst cheers, as were also other resolutions subsequently
proposed.
The chairman explained that Mr. Landsborough,
having been out of town, had not yet arrived at the
meeting, but was expected shortly. In the meantime
he called upon Mr. M’Kinlay to respond to the compli-
ment which had just been paid to himself and his
brother explorer. He also requested the meeting to
excuse Mr. M’Kinlay from making any statement with
respect to his journey, as he felt bound, in the first
place, to communicate the particulars to the Govern-
ment by whom he had been sent out.
Mr. M’Kinlay, who was received with hearty and
prolonged cheering, briefly returned thanks for the
kindness which had been shown him. His journey had
certainly been accomplished successfully, but it had
been undertaken under very favourable circumstances,
and had such not been the case probably the result
might have been very different. He felt himself com-
pelled to refrain from stating many particulars which
the public would be glad to learn, but they would, no
doubt, be known in due course. At present he could
merely express his sincere thanks for the great kindness
with which he had been received that evening. (Cheers.)
Mr. Wyld, Mr. Poole, Mr. Kirby, and Mr. Davis,
fellow-travellers with Mr. M’Kinlay, were severally
introduced to the meeting by the chairman, and each
received a cordial welcome, which they duly ack-
nowledged.
Mr. Landsborough, who had in the meantime
arrived, then came forward to address the meeting,
and was greeted with cordial and enthusiastic cheering.
He was much gratified, he said, at the warm reception
which he received, and he had little expected that his
humble services would have been acknowledged in such
a public way by such an assemblage as he saw around
him. He had been rather hurriedly called upon, as he
was not aware that the meeting was to be held that
evening until his arrival from Geelong, an hour or so


before. (Hear, hear.) “My friend and brother ex-
plorer,” continued Mr. Landsborough, “has just come
in from a glorious trip from South Australia, by Car-
pentaria and by Port Denison. I consider his mode of
exploring with livestock, consisting of camels, cattle,
sheep, and horses, nearly the best. To make it com-
plete, he only wanted some aborigines as trackers. This,
I am sure, he felt on one occasion, when Mr. Kirby and
his sheep were lost for three days. Mr. M’Kinlay
deserves the greatest credit for being the first to take
sheep across the continent. The camels will yet be
found of the greatest value, for it is probable that other
explorers will not find water at such convenient dis-
tances as we have done, and as camels can go nearly
three times as far as horses without water they will be
of value for searching ahead for water, and when water
is once found it is very easy to take the party on, as it
is generally found
at distances suffi-
ciently near to be
reached by a party
like that which Mr.
M’Kinlay and I
had. By Burke,
Walker, M’Kinlay,
and myself six of
the Carpentaria
rivers have been
traced. These rivers
chiefly water coun-
try of a character
which, although
dry, is the kind
that I like best
for pastoral pur-
poses. And now that
my friend M’Kinlay
has taken sheep
across the continent, I hope flocks and herds will soon
follow, so that the fine pastures of Carpentaria, instead
of lying waste, will soon become profitable, not only to
Australia, but to the whole world.” (Applause.) In
conclusion, Mr. Landsborough intimated that he in-
tended to publish the rest of the information which he
had to communicate in the form of a pamphlet.
Mr. Bourne, the only member of Mr. Lands-
borough’s exploration party then remaining in Mel-
bourne, was introduced to the meeting, which likewise
honoured him with a round of cheers. He acknowledged
the compliment in a few pertinent remarks. He would
rather, he said, perform another journey through the
continent of Australia than make a speech in public,
and he did not seem to be singular in that opinion. On
his own behalf, and that of the rest of the party to
k 2
which he was attached, he begged to return thanks—
et cetera. (Laughter and applause.)
Mr. Aspinall, M.L.A., proposed:
“That this meeting recognizes the good services
rendered by the Governments of South Aus-
tralia and Queensland in organizing these
contingent expeditions with a view to dis-
cover and assist the missing party under the
lamented Burke and Wills.”
It would only, he remarked, be a just compliment to
the neighbouring colonies to adopt this resolution most
heartily. (Hear, hear.) Whilst the meeting recognized
these gallant men—Landsborough and M’Kinlay—men
of heroism and enterprise, men who were an honour to
their race and the colonies which they represented, they
ought also to recognize in them a manifestation on the
part of the neigh-
bouring colonies of
a hearty sympathy
in a matter concern-
ing the general wel-
fare of Australia.
(Applause.) While
doing honour to
the men them-
selves, they ought
to express their
gratefulness to the
Governments and
the people who
chose them for the
work which they
had performed.
Those Governments
were willing, in a
moment, to aid the
expedition which
the Government of Victoria had sent forth, and, as the
result proved, they had put the right men in the right
places. (Applause.) The explorers, however, must be
regarded as the representatives of the sentiment and
feeling of the colonists who had sent them forth. In
sending them forth those colonies were not influenced by
any ideas of the acquisition of territory, and, whatever
advantages they might have gained, their primary object
was to endeavour to rescue Burke and Wills, and to
assist the expedition of which those unfortunate
explorers were the leaders. While admiring the heroism
of Messrs. Landsborough and M’Kinlay, let them add
their tribute of admiration to the colonies which had
sent them to do the work which they were so admirably
fitted to do. (AjDplause.)
Mr. Gillbee heartily seconded the resolution, which
was carried unanimously.
OLIVE TREES AT WESTBROOK, DARLING DOWNS.


Dr. Macadam, M.L.A., proposed:
‘‘That this meeting is persuaded that it is incum-
bent on the various Australian Governments
to mark in some appropriate manner their
sense of the great merits of the leaders of the
contingent exploration parties and of the
important results which must flow from their
discoveries, and that a copy of this resolution
be forwarded for the consideration of the
respective Governments.”
Some difference of opinion, he said, had been manifested
in reference to the manner in which the exertions of the
respective explorers should be recognized. He himself
had only one opinion upon the subject —namely, that
they should be recognized through the Legislatures of
the respective colonies to which the explorers belonged.
Although he, and he believed the committee with which
he was connected, had been blamed for not sympathizing
materially with the subscription being raised for Mr.
Landsborough, he had already personally explained to
Mr. Landsborough his own views. It was held, as a
general principle, that when a national good was con-
ducted it was entitled to a national reward. (Hear,
hear.) He trusted that this would remove any impres-
sion which might exist as to there being any opposition
on his part, or on the part of the Exploration Com-
mittee, to the subscription which was being raised for
Mr. Landsborough; but, as he had already stated to
Mr. Landsborough and Mr. M’Kinlay, he believed
that the Legislatures of the different colonies should
recognize that which he thought was a greater benefit
than that for which any amount of money could be
spent under any other vote of the Legislature. (Ap-
plause.) He had to make one word of personal explana-
tion. He had been somewhat blamed in The Argus of
that day for having initiated, with his friend Dr.
Cairns, a meeting of that kind. The meeting had
originated in a spontaneous suggestion made on the
previous Friday by Dr. Cairns, who thought that while
it might be convenient to the Exploration Committee to
meet in the afternoon, it would be a great pleasure to
the community at large to hold an evening meeting, at
which, in addition to merely having the opportunity of
recognizing the explorers by their portraits in the Satur-
day prints, they might meet them face to face and
speak to them. (Applause.) Influenced by this suggestion,
he (Dr. Macadam) set about to make arrangements
for the meeting, and he was sorry to say that he
met with considerable opposition; but he had always
found that whenever a man threw himself upon the
public sympathy he was never mistaken. (Hear, hear.)
If the Exploration Committee had not called the
meeting they would have been blamed; and he was
quite prepared to see that they would receive a great
amount of opposition from certain quarters. Without
further remark upon this subject, he would leave the
correction of the error, if error he had committed
(“No, no!”) —to a gentleman who was present at the
Landsborough testimonial meeting, and who wrote the
paragraph in The Argus alluded to. He regretted the
absence of the Governor from the meeting, but he
would explain the reason. His Excellency instructed
him to say that he had exceedingly regretted to perceive
by the newspapers that that day had been fixed for the
grand reception, and stated his absence was caused by
a prior engagement. Some two years and a half ago
the task of exploring the continent was commenced in
Victoria, and whatever might be said derogatory to the
management of the exploration, the work had been
accomplished —the continent was now marked out, and
it only required private enterprise to establish commu-
nication between every part of it. (Applause.)
Captain Norman, being loudly called for by the
meeting, made a few remarks indicating the cordial
unanimity in which he and Mr. Landsborough had
co-operated, and mentioned that Monday was the
anniversary of their safe arrival at Carpetaria after
the wreck of the “Firefly” in Torres Straits.
Mr. Kamsay, M.L.A., in seconding the resolution,
expressed his full concurrence with the opinion which
it contained, and stated that he would do his best in
his place in Parliament to support any motion for
carrying it into practical effect. (Applause.)
The resolution was carried.
On the motion of Dr. Wilkie, seconded by Captain
Matthews, a vote of thanks was given to the chairman.
The chairman, in acknowledging the compliment,
gave an emphatic contradiction to an opinion which,
he said, he understood had been expressed in some
quarters that Landsborough and M’Kinlay had had
tracks to guide them in their exploration journeys.
The proceedings then terminated, the meeting, in
response to Dr. Macadam, giving three hearty cheers
for the explorers.

The Railways of Queensland.
Their History and Development.
Contributed by G. R. Steer, M.V.0., Secretary Queensland Railway Department.
In 1863, the Premier of the colony of Queensland
(Hon. R. G. W. Herbert) visited England, and, as a
result of his observations of the railway systems there,
the first Railway Bill for the construction of railways
in Queensland was introduced in Parliament by the
Minister for Lands and Works (Hon. A. Macalister).
Ipswich (the head of navigation) was decided upon
as the starting point for the
railway, the first objective
being Toowoomba (77 miles),
and thence to Dalby (52
miles further). The ques-
tion of railway construction
was generally supported in
the House, but opinions
differed as to what gauge
should be adopted. After
considerable debate the Rail-
way Bill was passed, but
before final acceptance a
special Committee of the
Legislative Council sum-
moned a number of
engineers, surveyors, and
contractors to the Bar of
the House for examination
with regard to the question
of gauge. Among the chief
witnesses was Mr. Abram
Fitzgibbon, C.E., who
strongly recommended the
3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and it was
mainly on his advice that
this was adopted as the
Queensland standard. Mr.
Fitzgibbon was appointed
Engineer-in-Chief for the construction of railways, and
two months later (December, 1863) he was appointed
Commissioner for Railways. By this time tenders had
been called for the construction of the first section from
Ipswich to the Little Liverpool Range at Grandchester
(then called Bigge Camp), a distance of 2H miles. It
was decided to entrust the building of this section to
the English firm of railway contractors, Messrs. Peto,
Brassey, & Betts, who had previously been engaged on
railway construction in New South Wales. On February
25, 1864, the first sod was turned at Ipswich, in the
presence of His Excellency the Governor (Sir George
Bowen), and six months later a vessel arrived with a
quantity of rolling stock and other material purchased
in England. A number of mechanics were also imported.
The first section of railway was officially opened
on July 31, 1865, and the
occasion was marked by
considerable festivities; both
Houses of Parliament ad-
journed for a fortnight to
attend the opening cere-
mony at Grandchester and
a racing carnival at Too-
woomba.
In the meantime agita-
tion showed that other parts
of the State required rail-
ways, and construction was
shortly afterwards com-
menced at Rockhampton,
but the line from Townsville
to Charters Towers was not
begun until a few years
later.
Dalby was reached on
April 20, 1868, and War-
wick on January 8, 1871;
but it was not until June
14, 1875, that the line from
Ipswich to Brisbane was
opened. Since 1865 there
has been a steady advance-
ment in the railway con-
struction of Queensland,
and scarcely a year has passed without adding to
the length of open line.
The railway was completed to Emerald in 1879,
Roma in 1880, Charters Towers in 1882, Mitchell in
1883, Hnghenden in 1887, Charleville in 1888, Long-
reach in 1892, Cunnamulla in 1898, Goondiwiudi,
Blackall, and Cloncurry in 1908, Dirranbandi in 1913,
and Quilpie in 1917. The connection with the New
South Wales line at Wallangarra was finished in 1887,

and the North Coast line was opened through to
Rockhampton in 1903.
Considerable foresight has been displayed in the
selection of routes in order to open up the greatest
possible area of country with the minimum length of
railway and in providing the shortest route to the sea-
board; in fact, every important port on the coast has
a railway extending towards the interior. Some of
these lines are of considerable length, as Dirranbandi
is 416 miles, Cunnamulla 604, Quilpie 621, Yaraka 476,
Longreach 428, Winton 368, Cloncurry 486, Dajarra
582, and Forsayth 263 miles from the coast, and all these
points are railway termini. The value of these lines
will be appreciated when
we consider that in bygone
years wool was hauled by
horses or bullocks for dis-
tances up to 500 miles, and
after being months on the
road was shipped by small
sailing vessels at Cleveland.
The old jetty was at the rear
of the Pier Hotel, and the
brick portion of that build-
ing was formerly the Cus-
toms House. On the return
journey all the requisites for
the interior were hauled by
teams up the Main Bange,
2,000 ft. above sea level.
A very large State with
a sparse population required
developing, and it could
only be done by light and
cheap railways. The wisdom
of adopting the 3 ft. 6 in.
gauge has frequently been
questioned, but the fact
remains that it has enabled
this State to attain the
unique position of having
more railways in proportion
to the volume of business and population than any other
country except Western Australia, whilst the cost of
construction has been infinitely lower than on the wider-
gauge railways. Queensland has built 5,685 miles of
railway at a cost of £42,186,985 (including rolling
stock), an average of £7,421 per mile; New South
Wales (4 ft. 8| in. gauge) has 5,015 miles, costing
£15,815 per mile; and Victoria (5 ft. 3 in. gauge)
has built 4,214 miles of railway at £13,936 per
mile. If our lines had cost the same per mile
as New South Wales we should have had only
2,669 miles, instead of 5,685, for the same capital
expenditure. It must be admitted that the wide-gauge
MR. G. R. STEER, M.V.O.,
SECRETARY QUEENSLAND RAILWAYS DEPARTMENT.
railways of New South Wales and Victoria are more
highly developed than our lines, but that is due to the
greater density of traffic. New South Wales is less
than half the size of Queensland, but has nearly
three times the population and four times the passenger
traffic and goods tonnage. Victoria is only about
one-eighth the area of Queensland, but has double the
population, nearly five times as many railway passengers,
and more than twice the goods tonnage to handle.
Some of their wide-gauge trucks are able to carry
heavier weights than ours, but I never heard of New
South Wales desiring to send any large article which
could not be carried by the Queensland rolling stock,
although hundreds of thou-
sands of tons of all classes of
goods have been handled,
and heavy ranges with sharp
curves are traversed on the
Queensland side. The most
difficult single item to trans-
port was the large German
tank captured by Australian
soldiers in France, but it
was safely conveyed to Bris-
bane last year.
The 3 ft. 6 in. gauge
has great possibilities, as we
find that in South Africa the
weight of the rolling stock
and loads generally compare
more than favourably with
the European wide-gauge
railways, and even in
Queensland our modern car-
riages are wider than most
of the coaches on British
railways, and only a few
inches narrower than on
the wide-gauge Australian
railways.
In the early days of
railway construction in
Queensland it was the practice to invite tenders and
entrust the building of railways to contractors, but
for some years past all new railways have been
constructed by the Commissioner’s own engineers
under the day-labour system. This has saved the
contractor’s profits, and has the advantage of enabling
us to commence the construction of any section of
line without waiting for the completion of the
plans for the whole. It also enables the Commis-
sioner to alter or modify the method or order of
construction to meet any unforeseen contingencies
which may arise without being involved in claims
for compensation, which invariably followed any


deviation from the original designs under the contract
system.
Railway building has made great strides during
recent years. As previously stated, we have now 5,685
miles of line. Half of this mileage was built during
the first forty years of our railway history, and an equal
length has been constructed in the last sixteen years,
during which the lines opened for traffic have averaged
172 miles per annum. At the beginning of the present
financial year railway building was proceeding at
fourteen different points, 590 miles of line being in pro-
gress, and 1,506 miles more had been authorised by
Parliament. Of this bold programme the most important
item is the extension of the north coast railway, which
will connect Brisbane with Cairns, a distance of 1,042
miles. This is practically a national undertaking, and
when completed will be a great boon to the residents
and a convenience to the Commissioner, who will be
enabled to rapidly transfer rolling stock, which may be
temporarily spare at one point, to another district where
there is a scarcity. The shipping of locomotives, car-
riages, and waggons to meet the growing requirements
of North Queensland has been a continual source of
expense. Another very important line in progress is
that from Merinda to the Bowen coalfields, a distance
of fifty miles; this mine is owned by the State, and will
supply our coal requirements on the great northern
railway, which amount to about 60,000 tons per annum,
all of which is at present sea-borne. The line from
Longreach to Winton, to connect the central and
northern systems, is also very important, and will afford
great relief in the movements of live stock. Other rail-
ways in progress and in contemplation are designed to
open up good land for closer occupation, and will greatly
assist in the settlement of soldiers and their families.
Generally speaking, Queensland is to be congratu-
lated on having such a high proportion of open lines in
comparison with its population and the volume of busi-
ness; many of the branch lines do not show payable results
at present, but the State is very fortunate in having had
these lines built when the cost of construction was low.
The general distribution of the railway system
throughout the State, whilst having many advan-
tages, has added to the difficulties and cost of
administration, and in order to avoid delays and
circumlocution the present Commissioner appointed
general managers at Brisbane, Toowoomba, Rock-
hampton, and Townsville, each managing all the staff in
his own division, and working under the direct control
of the Commissioner in Brisbane. This arrangement has
been found to work advantageously, both from the
public and departmental point of view.
Comparatively few Queenslanders realize the
magnitude of the business transacted by the Railway
Department. The Commissioner’s annual report for
1919-20 shows that during the year 28,000,000 passenger
journeys were made, and the revenue from them and
parcels traffic totalled £1,959,000. The passenger
services are good considering the sparse population, but
it must be borne in mind that Queensland has only 130
inhabitants per mile of railway, whilst New South Wales
has 400, Tasmania 354, Victoria 341, and South Aus-
tralia 96. Some people make comparisons as to what
can be done in the way of railway travelling in Great
Britain compared with Queensland, entirely overlooking
the fact that in the former country there are 1,943
inhabitants per mile of railway compared with 130 here.
The fares are moderate compared with the other
Australian States, and very cheap compared with Great
Britain. Excursion fares are granted for any distance
over twelve miles every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,
available to return until the following Monday. Specially
low fares are also charged to the seaside resorts, such as
Sandgate, Wynnum, Manly, Cleveland, Coolangatta,
Pialba, Emu Park, etc., so as to give the city folk
healthful recreation at a cheap rate.
During the year goods and live stock totalling
3.791.000 tons were carried, including 681,000 tons of
coal and coke, 487,000 tons of other mineral traffic,
232.000 tons of sugarcane, 523,000 tons of agricultural
produce, 61,000 tons of wool, 738,000 tons of timber
and firewood, 48,000 tons of flour, 605,000 tons of
general merchandise, and 416,000 tons of live stock.
The earnings from goods and live stock were £3,001,000,
and the total revenue for the year was £4,960,000.
The train service covered 10,500,000 miles.
Queensland is at a great disadvantage as regards
the tonnage of goods carried by rail, as during the last
financial year the quantity was only 673 tons per mile
of line, compared with 2,677 tons per mile in New South
Wales, 1,567 in Victoria, 1,146 in South Australia,
and 868 in Western Australia. It follows that with a
heavier traffic per mile of line the cost of handling is
proportionately lower. A factor against economical
managament is the seasonal traffic, such as cattle, sheep,
wheat, sugar, etc. The meatworks operate during only
a few months of the year, with the result that a large
portion of the 1,384 cattle and sheep trucks are idle for
many months together, yet we carried 642,000 cattle
and nearly 2,000,000 sheep. The animals are success-
fully and expeditiously carried for very long distances,
and on several occasions lots of 100,000 to 200,000 sheep
have been conveyed up to 1,100 miles practically
without loss.
The first Brisbane station was at Roma Street, and
trains to Sandgate and Caboolture ran via Normanby
and Exhibition. The extension to the present Central
station was opened in 1889, and to Brunswick Street
and Mayne Junction the following year. The accom-
modation at Central and Roma Street for passengers


and goods has become inadequate, and works of con-
siderable magnitude are in progress to afford relief. A
large area at Mayne Junction has been prepared for the
establishment of new locomotive and carriage depots.
The space now occupied for this purpose at Roma Street,
together with land resumed from Albert Park, will be
available for a commodious new goods depot, towards
which a great deal of work has been done. The removal
of the present goods shed will enable additional pas-
senger platforms to be built between the present station
and Roma Street. The scheme is comprehensive, and
will provide for considerable increase in business in the
future.
For many years all new engines have been designed
Workshops at Ipswich, and have given such satisfaction
that tenders have recently been invited for 35 more
locomotives of the same type. Thirty engines are now
under construction, and contracts have just been entered
into for 36 more, in addition to the 35 mentioned above.
The number of engines now in use is 666, and the addi-
tions mentioned above will bring the total to 767.
There are now 860 carriages in traffic, and 36 more
are being built in the Railway Workshops. The cars
imported from England in 1864 were small four-wheeled
vehicles carrying 20 persons. Now carriages are being
built 52 ft. in length and 9 ft. in width, and the vehicles
used for suburban traffic have a high-seating capacity,
carrying 80 first-class or 90 second-class passengers.

in the Chief Mechanical Engineer’s office at Ipswich
and built in Queensland, either in the Ipswich Work-
shops or by contractors at Brisbane, Maryborough, and
Toowoomba. The workmanship and present costs com-
pare favourably with engines built in other countries.
The first engines used in Queensland weighed only 37
tons, but the photograph on page 153 shows a 91-ton
engine of the “C 18” class (called Sir William Mac-
gregor), used to haul the Sydney mail train over the
Main Range and the Dalveen Range. These engines
have a tractive force of 21,735 lb., and on passenger
trains haul 240 tons up long grades of 1 in 50 at a speed
of 20 miles per hour. They were built in the Railway
These are of the side-door type, ensuring rapid ingress
and egress, and the low partitions are much appreciated
on account of the free ventilation. There is no more
comfortable carriage in Australia than the parlour
car, with its revolving armchairs, attached to the Sydney
mail train. The first-class sleeping-cars are of the
Pullman type, and accommodate 20 passengers. Queens-
land was the pioneer of second-class sleeping-cars, which
are also run on all-night journeys; they hold six
passengers in each compartment, or 30 to a car, and
the extra charge for the sleeping-berth is only 3s. 6d.
per head. For many years all new carriages have been
built at the Ipswich Workshops, and prior to that some


were obtained from Queensland contractors. Three
trains are now being built in readiness for the extension
of the main north coast line through to Townsville, and
the sleeping-cars will contain all modern improvements,
including a limited number of two- and three-berth
compartments for first- and second-class passengers
respectively.
There are 14,617 waggons in use, and thev comprise
no fewer than forty types, including different styles of
insulated cars for the carriage of butter, cheese, and
meat; ventilated cars for the carriage of fruit, vegetables,
cream, etc.; open goods waggons, covered goods waggons,
special waggons to carry motor-cars, others for traction
engines, timber, ballast, coal, coke, horses, cattle, sheep,
pigs, explosives, kerosene, gas, water, etc. Several
vehicles are fitted as breakdown waggons, and there are
also travelling cranes, appliances for poisoning weeds
and testing weighbridges, and a travelling sawmill.
From time to time contractors have assisted in building
of the workshops. The shops are equipped with modern
machinery, which is always being added to. The number
of men employed is nearly 2,000.
A new locomotive depot is in course of construction
at Toowoomba, while modern engine sheds and work-
shops have recently been provided at Rockhampton.
There are also extensive workshops at Townsville,
and owing to the isolation of the northern railways
there are smaller plants at Mackay and Cairns.
All the largest railway bridges have been built in
Queensland, and special attention has been paid to the
purchase of articles manufactured in Australia, pre-
ference being given to Queensland wherever possible.
During the last few years the whole of the rails and
fishplates for new lines have been secured from the
works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company
Limited, Newcastle (New South Wales); in fact, on
completion of the present contract this Company will
have delivered 50,000 tons of rails to various Queensland

waggons, but the bulk of them have been constructed
in the department’s workshops at Ipswich, where 378
are now in progress.
Extensive cold-storage accommodation is provided
by the Railways Department in Brisbane for butter,
cheese, etc., awaiting shipment, and here ice is manu-
factured to cool the waggons used for the carriage of
dairy products from country stations.
Owing to the continued growth of business it was
necessary in 1907 to abandon the old site of the loco-
motive workshops at North Ipswich, and extensive works
were erected upon a very suitable piece of ground a mile
distant. Here the department has one of the finest
engineering workshops in the Commonwealth, laid out
with a broad view to future expansion, and also paying
due consideration to the comfort and well-being of the
employes engaged therein. Power is provided by the
latest pattern of self-feeding boilers driving steam
turbines, which generate electric current for the whole
ports. The firm also produces pig iron and different
forms of structural steel, angles, etc., for our railways,
and from the works of the Commonwealth Steel Pro-
ducts, Limited (also at Newcastle), the Commissioner is
obtaining axles, wheels, and tyres. Steel tyres are also
being supplied from Castlemaine (Victoria) and springs
from Sydney and Melbourne. A number of cast-iron
chilled wheels for waggons have been made at Mary-
borough. Cement has been drawn from the works at
Darra.
The number of men employed at June 30 was
16,823, and the wages bill for the year amounted to
£3,270,000, exclusive of 3,100 men engaged upon the
building of new railways. There are 395 stations, 431

Speaking generally the Queensland railways system
compares favourably with that in other young
countries, notwithstanding our huge area and small
population.


The Pastoral Industry.
(Continued from Vol. I., page 150.)
EVOLUTION OF TYPES OF STOCK.
CHAPTER II.
The history of the pastoral industry in any country
necessarily, in its early stages, contains the account of
the evolution of types of stock suited by constitution
and other inherent characteristics to yield profit under
local natural conditions. The pioneering pastoralist
must first discover the variety of stock his run is best
adapted to carry; and, having satisfactorily solved that
important initial problem, he must then discover what
type and strain of blood of the selected species will best
suit the soil and climate peculiarities prevailing on his
run. Perhaps more than a generation will have passed
away before the latter of these questions is settled.
Only those gifted with the qualities of observation and
temperament essential to the successful breeding of stock
will succeed in establishing such herds and flocks as will
draw the maximum of profit from the land, except
where following the lead of others.
In the original settlement of Queensland early
errors were made in bringing sheep to districts unsuited
to their support. The mistake was natural and almost
unavoidable. Only experiment could be made to reveal
the true stock-carrying capacity of land for the first
time being put to industrial use. Thus, when in the
fifties, some of the runs were taken up in the Port
Curtis district and in other localities within coastal
territory, flocks were brought to country which experi-
ence subsequently proved to be unsuited, by reason of
a heavy rainfall and other conditions, for wool-growing
purposes. Disease threatened to wipe out the sheep, and
they w’ere successfully and profitably replaced by cattle.
In some instances in the settlement of Queensland,
country was found to be unsuited to sheep in the early
stages of its occupation, but afterwards became adapted
to wool-growing. The stocking of this country had
wrought changes in the nature of the herbage it grew,
and in other characteristics. Moreover, sheep often
proved more difficult than cattle to manage in the days
when the land was wild and the natives warlike.
Dingoes were plentiful in many regions from which
they since have been thinned, and the shepherding
which this latter and other sources of danger presented
exposed the pioneering squatter to difficulties in securing
labour, especially after the goldfields had commenced to
attract the manhood from all over the continent, as well
as from overseas. Sheep were overlanded and settled
in districts which never can be suited to their require-
ments, and in country which, in its virgin state, was
not suited, but since has become so. One of the reasons
creating a bias in favour of wool-growing was the poor
market offering for any class of stock intended for
butchering. Not till many years after that time was
the freezing process of preserving and carrying meat
established, and in the very early days not even boiling
down had been brought into operation as a means of
founding some kind of a market for surplus stock. In
the forties the price of a bullock in the south of what
is now New South Wales was 17s. 6d. After being
overlanded to Western Victoria or the Port Phillip Bay
district, as it was then called, the same beast, when
fattened, could be sold for £3 10s. That was after
boiling down was in operation, and it was in a part of
the country much more accessible than the Moreton Bay
district then was. The market for wool, on the other
hand, was remunerative to the grower and was stable.
The surplus stock of a flock, it is true, might be difficult
to dispose of, but this would apply only to the wethers,
as in those times of pastoral expansion the ewes w r ere
needed for as long as they would continue to breed,
whilst, even if the wethers had to be kept until after
an age when their production of fleece had deteriorated,
land was more plentiful than sheep, and the pastoralist
who could send a large clip to market rarely failed to
establish a substantial independence, and, in most cases,
ultimately a fortune.
In the days prior to the gold rushes of the early
fifties and for some years afterwards, the inducements
were all for grazing sheep rather than cattle, if the
country could be made to carry the former free from
disease. The establishment of boiling-down works
served to increase the remunerativeness of cattle runs,


and the ultimate discovery of the freezing process
created new vistas of profit to the cattle-breeder, lead-
ing to huge tracts of virgin country for the first time
coming into occupation. But the latter development
was an event of modern times, and could hardly have
been dreamed of by the original pioneers of the industry
in Queensland. For many years the breeders of the
Argentine Republic were in the habit of shipping their
cattle to Great Britain in a live state; but greater
distance prevented the graziers of Australia from
entering into competition in this trade. The outbreak
of bovine diseases in South America, with a consequent
prohibition against the importation into the United
Kingdom of live stock from that part of the world,
could be sold for export, or else the former could be
used, by landholders making a speciality of the business,
for breeding lambs for the overseas demand.
The wool-growing side of the pastoral industry has
been subjected to even more vicissitudes than has
cattle-breeding. Though both have suffered alike from
periods of drought, particularly in 1902 and 1915, the
more complex nature of the former has opened the door
to error and loss to a greater extent than serves to
entrap the grazier aiming to supply the needs of the
meat market. Darwin remarks in the opening of one
of his chapters in “The Origin of Species” that not
one man in a thousand has been born with the qualities
necessary to become a successful breeder of pigeons.
SHEPP SHEARING IN WESTERN QUEENSLAND.
shut off from a profitable market the producers who
had been plying a very lucrative business. But the
fitting of steamers with refrigerating machinery and
space in freezing chambers reopened the centre of con-
sumption, while it also let the Australian pastoralists
into a share of the good things going. Australia forth-
with became an active competitor with Argentina in the
meat-export trade. Besides so greatly adding to the
value of fat cattle, the evolution of the freezing trade
conferred a quite new and much-increased value upon
the surplus stock from sheep stations. Old ewes and
wethers, sold to make room for the natural increase of
young stock, forthwith, when in condition for killing,
The breeding of pigeons, as compared with breeding
other species, is a simple business, whereas the produc-
tion and modification of sheep intended for wool-grow-
ing purposes is perhaps the most difficult class of
stock-raising which the grazier can undertake. But few
men are gifted by Nature with the qualities necessary
to become a skilful judge of wool. Very many
classers and others spend long years handling fleeces
without ever acquiring sufficient expertness to be able
to guage, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the
proportion of fatty matter among the fibres, or being
able properly to estimate values of differing clips. But
to be an accurate and keen judge of wool is but the


groundwork of the knowledge needed by the skilled
judge of sheep; whilst many men may be capable judges
of sheep without possessing the traits needed to enable
them successfully to breed flocks. The progress of the
wool-growing industry, therefore, depends to no small
extent on the success with which a comparatively few
stud-masters have evolved types suited to produce
profitably fleeces under the special natural conditions
peculiar to the different climatic zones of the continent,
and on the skill with which producers, who are not
themselves stud-breeders, have selected the types of
breeding sheep respectively fitted to the environments
under which the resultant stock would be required to
live. The variety used for fleece production, almost
without exception throughout Australia, has from the
beginning of the industry been the merino. But merino
sheep may be made to differ in type to a remarkable
extent, certain animals returning no more than five
pounds’ weight of wool, while as much as forty pounds’
weight has been shorn from others as the result of
twelve months’ growth.
Merino sheep were popularized in Australia by
Captain Macarthur and by Samuel Marsden, the first
colonial chaplain to New South Wales. The original
type was very different from that which to-day yields
the clip of the Commonwealth. Not only have subse-
quent importations been made from different parts of
Europe and America, but the process of the selection
of stud stock has been made to yield changes so revo-
lutionary that the interest attaching to the original
importations is purely historical. Captain Macarthur
was sent to England in 1803 by Governor King as
punishment for his conduct in connection with a duel
he fought with a brother officer. Before leaving the
colony he had experimented in sheep-breeding, having
obtained a few pure merinos and crossed them with the
coarse-woolled sheep already in the country. Some of
the wool he took with him, having established a small
flock. On arrival he memorialized the Government,
asking leave to occupy a sufficient tract of unoccupied
lands to feed his flocks. A peculiar turn in the tide
of fortune brought luck in the way of the army officer.
At that time there happened to be a quarrel in progress
between the woollen manufacturers and their employes,
the latter objecting to the employment of anyone who
had not been apprenticed to the trade and relying on
an old prohibitory statute of the reign of Queen Eliza-
beth, the question ultimately turning on whether the raw
material was an article of purely local production. The
employers found in the specimens brought to England
by Captain Macarthur the proof they needed to show
that raw wool was not only of local production. The
whole wool-manufacturing district was immediately
lined in support of the application of the pioneer Aus-
tralian sheep-breeder, and instead of being granted a
licence to occupy he received a grant of 5,000 acres,
accompanied by a promise of an additional 5,000 acres
if lie succeeded in proving that it was possible to export
wool of fine quality from New South Wales. He was
also given some carefully selected stud sheep from the
Royal flocks, which he took back with him for the
improvement of his own sheep. In 1820 his flock had
increased to 2,000, and of that number 300 consisted
of a stud of pure merinos. At that time the total of
sheep in Eastern Australia amounted to about a
hundred thousand only.
But the honour of pioneering the Australian wool-
growing industry must be shared by Captain Macarthur
with Mr. Marsden, who visited England in 1806. His
biographer writes:—“He had discerned the wonderful
capacity of Australia for sheep farming, and having
brought home some wool and found it much approved
of by the manufacturers, he therefore ventured to peti-
tion George 111. for a couple of merino sheep from the
Royal farm at Windsor to improve the breed.” The
enterprising clergyman was presented with five stud
sheep, and on using them on his own flock he found
all the anticipated improvement to eventuate.
The merino sheep imported into Australia from the
Royal flocks by these two pioneers of the wool-growing
industry were mostly of Spanish origin, and a curious
story attaches as to how that blood came to reach
England. Some other progenitors of the Australian
merinos reached these shores from Spain in a manner
which, as well as being somewhat roundabout, probably
entailed the introduction of some impurity of blood,
merino sheep had been presented to the Dutch Republic
by the King of Spain. The Dutch Republic sent this
stock to Cape Colony. Captain Macarthur John
Macarthur obtained a few of them from the latter place
and brought them to the southern continent.
George 111. secured his merinos direct from the
pure stock. The King was a keen farmer, and was much
interested in stock breeding pursuits. A small draft
of Spanish merino ewes fell into his hands: in a remark-
able manner. A British and a Spanish fleet happened
to meet at sea, and the Spanish Admiral had a quantity
of sheep on board. Some of these he presented to the
British Admiral, not knowing their value. It was then
a crime to export merino sheep from Spain; but they
were given for eating purposes at sea. However, the
ewes were not used on board. When the ships: arrived
in England, Sir Joseph Banks saw the merinos, and,
knowing their character, he had them presented to the
King.
However, the ewes could be only of use for crossing
purposes, and King George’s ambitions aimed at some-
thing higher than that. He keenly desired to obtain
rams. The Spanish Ambassador, when approached in
the matter, declared That he could not break the law


of his own country. But it was discovered that the
Ambassador’s wife dearly coveted a pair of cream
homes which drew the Royal carriage. The lady was
approached and asked if she would care for a pair like
those of the King. To possess horses just such as drew
the monarch was more than feminine vanity could
resist. So a pair were procured for her from Hanover,
and at a cost when they were landed of some £B,OOO.
The Lady Ambassadress was then anxious to do some-
thing in return. She was told that what would please the
donors most would be a few Spanish rams. She could not
ask the Spanish Government for them; so she had to
resort to smugglers, who, probably stealing the sheep,
drove them through Spain and France, and, shipped
them at Hamburg. Such is the account of the origin of
the Royal British merino flock, as told in the very early
days by The New South Wales Magazine.
to defray the commissioners’ expenses and that of the
police under their direction, so that their occupation
might not cost the Government anything. But in the
course of time, when nearly all the available lands
within a practicable distance were occupied, great evils
were experienced from the arbitrary acts of these
functionaries, who assumed great powers in defining
the extent of runs by lessening one run to enlarge
another. They were accused of receiving bribes and
of acting very unfairly between man and man. The
occupants were powerless against the Government, as
they had only an annual licence; they could not be
otherwise than dissatisfied. They required a better
tenure to secure them against the irresponsible acts of
an arbitrary Governor and his needy subordinates.”
The fight between the pastoralists, other interests
of the community, and the Imperial Government on the
SHEEP AT WARRA, QUEENSLAND.
The success attained by these two gentlemen
—Captain Macarthur and Mr. Marsden—denotes the
commencement of the Australian squatting industry.
Other pastoralists were able to buy a limited
quantity of stud stock from the original pioneers, as
the flocks of the latter grew, and thus the wool-growing
business came to be established. The Government
encouraged the undertaking by granting annual licences
for the free occupation of land; but the squatters were
not long satisfied with a right which lasted for only a
year. Their views were put forward by their advocate,
William Campbell, M.L.C., in the following language :
—“The lands were lying waste; the Government very
wisely encouraged their occupation and licensed any
free and respectable person who wished to occupy them.
Commissioners were appointed to manage these waste
lands, and the occupants voluntarily paid an assessment
question of land tenure is recorded in another portion
of this publication. It is, however, interesting to note
that, once established, the wool-growing industry
developed with extraordinary speed. Whilst in 1819
the export of wool was less than 8,000 lb. in weight,
the weight of the clip had in 1845 increased to
17,364,734 lb. In 1847 the squatters received an
improved land tenure. Under this law the land of the
colony was divided into "settled,” "intermediate,” and
"unsettled” areas. The Moreton Bay district con-
tained no land classed as "intermediate,” whilst the
"settled” land comprised only that within the then
County of Stanley and land within three miles of the
sea "measured in a straight line.” Leases for fourteen
years were granted in relation to "unsettled” lands.
The minimum annual rent for any run was £lO per
annum, whilst the minimum carrying capacity of a run


was to be 4,000 sheep or an equivalent number of cattle.
For the carrying capacity of every extra 1,000 sheep or
equivalent number of cattle the extra rent was to be
•£2 10s. per annum. Within the period of the lease the
land was not to be sold to any person except the tenant,
and to him in areas of not less than 160 acres at
a time and at a minimum price of £1 per acre. No
block of land of this minimum area bought by the lessee
was to have a water frontage of greater proportion than
440 yards, “reckoned in a straight line.” The Govern-
ment reserved to itself the following powers of granting
or selling leased “unsettled” lands;—“Any lands
within the limits of the run, or lands comprised in such
lease, for public purposes or disposing of in such other
manner as far as the public interest may seem best,
such lands as may be required for the sites of churches,
schools, or parsonages, or for the construction of high
roads, railways, and railway stations, or other internal
communications, whether by land or water; or for the
use or benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the
country, or for public buildings, or as places for the
interment of the dead, or places for the recreation and
amusements of the inhabitants of any town or village,
or as sites of public quays or landing-places on the sea
coast or shores of navigable streams; or for the purpose
of sinking shafts and digging for coal, iron, copper,
lead, or other minerals; or for any other purpose of
public defence, safety, utility, convenience, or enjoy-
ment, or for otherwise facilitating the improvement and
settlement of the colony; but so that the quantity of
land which may be granted or sold to any railway
company shall not exceed in all the rate of 100 acres
for every mile thereof in length.” At the expiration
of a lease the tenant was given first option of purchase
at the unimproved value. If he did not exercise this
right, and some other person purchased the run, the
outgoing tenant was to be paid for the improvements
at a valuation. If not more than a fourth of the area
of the run was bought by another at the termination
of a lease, the tenant was entitled to a renewal of the
lease. In the “settled” districts the leases were granted
only from year to year, and in the “intermediate”
districts they were granted for eight years. At the
same time as this system of tenure came into force, a
rate was struck on stock depastured outside the
“settled” districts. The rate was a halfpenny for every
sheep, three halfpence for every head of cattle, and
threepence for every horse.
Queensland wool-growers over most of the pastoral
areas of the State have been handicapped down to con-
temporary times through difficulties standing in the way
of becoming their own stud-breeders. In its initial
stages sheep-breeding in any new country is necessarily
carried on under systems so large and so rough as to
render the management of a stud flock impractical.
Where very valuable rams and ewes are handled, small
fenced paddocks and a regular supply of grass are essen-
tials. Also such pests as dingoes would render a stud-
breeding enterprise hazardous. The consequence has
been that Queensland pastoralists have been compelled
in many instances to purchase their flock rams from
those pastoralists who, carrying on their industry under
the easier conditions in the South, have been able to
maintain studs, the common practice being for sires for
use on the ordinary ewes to be produced on properties
containing stud flocks. In other instances, where the
flock rams have been selected merely from among
ordinary flock rams, they often proved of inferior
quality. The task of building up a stud from ordinary
sheep, with importations of blood from other breeders,
is necessarily very slow of accomplishment. The dis-
advantages of purchasing rams from districts subjected
to natural conditions differing widely from those under
which the progeny will be required to furnish profitable
returns have during the last fifteen years become abun-
dantly apparent, as also has the trapfall of buying sires
that have been specially fed and “got up” for sale
purjmses. The pastoralists, not only of Queensland, but
of the whole of Eastern Australia, have learned a bitter
lesson regarding the use, for practical purposes, of rams,
or indeed any class of stud stock, brought from remote
distances and from alien conditions. The present ten-
dency among wool-growers is all in the direction of
securing rams which, if not produced in adjacent
districts, are at least bred under conditions as similar
as possible to those under which the progeny will be
needed for wool-growing. And the reaction against
sheep “fed-up” for sale purposes has been no less
marked. Much has occurred before these facts were
thoroughly learned, but they are not likely to be for-
gotten. The habit of purchasing sheep imported from a
long distance and a climate widely differing from that
in which the buyer was carrying on his business
culminated with the boom which set in for American
rams in the late nineties.
The merinos originally imported by Captain
Macarthur and Mr. Marsden cut light fleeces, and the
wool certainly was too open to maintain a high quality
on the dusty plains of the interior of the colony.
Subsequent importations of various types of merinos
prevailing in Europe were made from time to ti ne with
a view of improving the local sheep; among these were
the large-bodied, long-stapled Rambouillet variety
and the smaller-framed, denser-fleeced Nigretti type.

South=Western Queensland.
Going westward from Toowoomba the train
passes over Darling Downs country for the whole 50
miles to Dalby. Eighteen miles out the train passes
Oakey, a very important farming district, prolific
in the prduction of wheat, barley, potatoes, maize,
and lucerne.
The repurchase of the old squatting stations by the
Government and the resale in small areas to selectors
made an entire transformation on the Darling Downs.
We are a long way now from the days of the early
squatters who took up all that country from 1840 to
1850 and used it purely as runs for sheep and cattle.
On King and Gowrie Creeks in 1843 were found the
first of the remarkable fossils which are peculiar to the
Post Pliocene Age of the Australian past. These in-
cluded the Diptrotodon, Nototherium, the marsupial
lion, Thylacoleo, and a huge extinct alligator named
Palimuarchus folleus.
The train runs through “Jondaryan,” a large
station which originally contained 155,000 acres, mostly
splendidly-grassed open downs, carrying about 140,000
sheep and 2,000 head of cattle. In recent years the
estate has been cut up and sold to farmers and dairymen.
It is well here to remind the traveller that
ROMA.
But they had not too much luck, those brave old
pioneers, and they had to face many difficulties of which
the present settlers know nothing.
We recall now with an amused smile the positive
statement of Watts, one of the two members for
Toowoomba and Drayton in the first Queensland
Parliament, that “the Darling Downs will never grow a
cabbage!” And to-day, in an ordinary season, that
Downs country is amongst the most productive in
Southern Queensland.
In recent years, however, it has been badly affected
by droughts, and the black basalt does not stand long
dry weather, being very porous and liable to open in
large fissures.
the Darling Downs presented a very different scene
to the pioneers of the forties. Originally all that
country was covered by wild oats and other tall
grasses 5 to 6 feet in height, and difficult either
to walk or ride through. Patrick Leslie, the Scot
who took up “Toolburra” in 1840, mentioned in
one of his letters that a horseman could only in some
places see the head and shoulders of the rider in front.
The Darling Downs country stands at an elevation of
1,400 to 2,000 ft. above sea level. Annually the pre-
historic aborigines fired the grasses and the tremendous
wave of red fire swept the Downs from end to end, the
marsupials and emus either running for their lives or


taking temporary refuge in the creeks and watercourses
and patches of scrub.
Alan Cunningham, who discovered and named the
Darling Downs in 1827, had a narrow escape from such
a grass fire. He named the Downs after Governor
Darling, and the Condamine River after Darling’s
private secretary, M. De la Condamine. The huge
animals that in some remote age lived on the Downs
were there previous to the volcanic upheaval that covered
all that country with black or red basalt, as their fossil
remains are found under the basalt.
DALBY.
The next town, westward 50 miles from Too-
woomba, is Dalby, named originally from a place
of that name in the Isle of Man. The site of Dalby
is the station, taken up in 1842, called Myall Creek,
from a variety of the Myall tree, Acacia pendula, grow-
ing all over that district, and usually known as “Dalby
iron wood,” being a much harder and darker timber than
the myall of the West. Dalby, generally known as the
“City of the Plains,” is an important town, the centre of
a splendid district, and the depot for a large population
of farmers and graziers. The town stands on a dead-
level black basaltic soil, very poorly timbered, and on
the banks of Myall Creek. It was proclaimed a muni-
cipality on August 31, 1863, three years later than
Toowoomba.
Before the railway was extended westward Dalby
was the head centre and terminus for all the traffic and
trade from there to the Warrego. It was the great meet-
ing place of the western squatters, a particularly lively
town where wild bushmen, “men with strange coats and
bearded like a pard” quaffed their Moot and Chandon
in the swell hotels, while the unpretentious rouseabout
and the solemn monopathic shepherd buried their sad
remembrances of hard work and dismal solitude in
flowing bowls of the good honest old Jamacia rum of
that period. But Dalby received a severe check when the
railway was opened further westward and the old trade
and traffic joassed on to Toowoomba or direct to Bris-
bane. The present writer was in Dalby at the turning
of the first sod of the railway westward in 1876, a wet
dreary day, the scrolls with the words of “Welcome”
either washed out or fallen down, about 3 in. of water
over the main street, mud everywhere, and a generally
depressing atmosphere. The “oldest inhabitant” was
quite certain that even the sky was weeping over what
he regarded as the beginning of the downfall of Dalby.
But though Dalby made a distinctly retrograde
movement for a while after the line was opened, the
town survived until the advent of settlement in the
surrounding country. In 1903 settlers began to flow in
from all directions, including New South Wales and
Victoria. In 1906 the branch line was opened for 23
miles out to Bell through the rich lands of the
“Cumkillenbar” Station.
Then “Dalby Downs,” “Greenbank,” “Wyobie,”
and “Logic Plains” were cut up and selected, also a
large area of Crown lands, including the Moola scrub at
the back of Irvinedale, settled chiefly by Victorians, and
settlement also extended to Warra and Chinchilla. In
the Dalby district for one year alone (1907) there was
selection of Government lands to the extent of 52,000
acres monthly, apart from occupation licences. Settle-
ment also extended down the Moonie River, to which
a railway has been constructed.
Then “Jimbour” Station, 10 miles out of Dalby,
was purchased by the Government, cut up and sold to
selectors on long and easy terms. It covered an area
of 162,000 acres, and most of it has been taken up by a
very desirable class of selectors. “Jimbour” is an
interesting station. It was taken over in 1841 by
Thomas Bell, father of the late Sir Joshua Peter Bell,
and grandfather of the late J. T. Bell, who was for a
time Speaker of the House and also Minister for Lands.
From that first Thomas Bell “Jimbour” passed to the
son, Joshua Peter Bell, who became Sir Joshua, who
intended it as an ancestral seat for the Bell family, and
with that prospect he built a very fine stone house on
the ridge overlooking the Jimbour plain at a cost of
about ,£25,000. Shortly afterwards the Jimbour
estate passed out of the hands of the Bell family into
the imssession of the Queensland National Bank, which
sold it to the Government, exclusive of the house and
300 acres. Jimbour was originally written Jimba, and
in Leichhardt’s dairy it appears as “Fimba,” evidently
a mistake by the explorer or printer. Leichhardt called
there on September 30, 1844, on his first journey to
Port Essington, and he left on October 1, so he made a
short stay. In his diary he says;—“After having
repaired some harness which had been broken by our
refractory bullocks upsetting their loads, and after my
companions had completed their arrangements, in
which Mr. Bell kindly assisted, we left Jimbour and
launched, buoyant with hope, into the wilderness of
Australia.”
The Jimbour plain is the last of the Darling
Downs when going west, for after leaving Macalister
the railway passes into scrubs of myall, brigalow, oaks,
emu and lemon bush, and cypress pine (Callistris
rohustaj, no hill visible on the horizon, and the same
dead-level country with the same vegetation continues
past Warra, at 181 miles, to Chinchilla, at 203 miles from
Brisbane and 53 from Dalby. Unfortunately the
indigenous vegetation of that area has been encroached
on by the worst kind of prickly pear, which has practic-
ally taken possession of a vast area of country nmthward


and southward of the railway. It is particularly aggres-
sive in the brigalow country. This calamitous plant
extends from near Dalby to Roma, and far beyond Roma.
CHINCHILLA.
Chinchilla is a prosperous town on a stock route
for Queensland cattle passing on the way to New South
Wales, and in the middle of an important district. It
has always been famous for deposits of fossil bones,
notably those of Diprotodon, Nototherium, and Thyla-
coleo. Some of the finest fossils in the Brisbane Museum
came from there, having been collected by the late
Kendal Broadbent, the Museum ornithologist and col-
lector, who in 1882 shot 140 species of birds in the Chin-
chilla district, including the wonga, bronzewing, squatter
MILES.
The next important station is Miles, at 231 miles
from Brisbane, named after the late Hon. Wrn. Miles,
once a squatter and well-known politician and Minister
of the Crown. It is only 972 ft. above sea level, being
one of the lowest of two stations among all those between
Toowoomba and Charleville, the other being next to
Roma, and known as Bungeworgari.
From Miles on for the next 87 miles the train
passes over the same level monotonous country timbered
by brigalow, myall, emu and lemon bush, oaks, and
cypress pine, thick in places, with prickly pear painfully
evident, and stretches of open forest timbered by
bloodwood, box gums, and forest oaks. Here and there
are charming little pictures of open glades and park-like

emu, plain turkey, night plover, spurwing plover,
dotterell, white and straw-necked ibis, native companion,

Chinchilla was a name given by Leichhardt when
he took a flying run west to try to connect his surveys
with those of Mitchell, leaving the most of his party
to wait for him on the Darling Downs. It was a name
given to his own blackboy by the local blacks, who
called the cypress pine “Jinchilla.” The word is now
spelt as if it referred to the small fur squirrel of South
America.

topped dense brigalow shrubs, apparently laid out by
some artistic landscape gardener for the sake of effect,
and all the more pleasing to the eye by reason of the
conspicuous contrast with the dreary vegetation of that
country from Dalby to Roma. Between Miles and
Roma the train passes the small settlements of Drillham
at 244, Dulaoca at 258, Jackson at 265, Channing at 272,
Yeulba at 281, Wallumbilla at 294, and Blythedale at
308 miles from Brisbane. Wallumbilla and Yeulba are
quite important little towns, the former being very
prosperous with a population of about 1,300 people in
a progressive wheat-growing and dairying district.


It was one of the sites chosen for the old
Government Village Settlements, and about the only
one that succeeded. The town is 1,020 ft. above sea
level, and - the locality is the most prolific wheat- and
butter-producing area in the district of the Maranoa.
A large area of fertile land extends northward and
southward. Wallumbilla is a progressive town with a
promising future, and its buildings and general appoint-
ments indicate a thriving and industrious community.
The township of Yeulba, a name given to Leichhardt
by the blacks, is on Yeulba Creek, 281 miles westward
from Brisbane, with a population of about 600 people.
Coaches run regularly from there to Surat. It is chiefly
a district of horse and cattle breeding, but there is
also mixed farming, including wheat, maize, and grapes.
The town is included in the Bendemere Shire Council,
which controls an area of 1,720 square miles.
ROMA.
At 318 miles westward from Brisbane on level
country on the Bungil Creek, a tributary of the Balonne,
and 980 ft. above the sea, stands the town of Roma,
named in honour of Lady Bowen, wife of Queensland’s
first Governor, a Greek woman whose maiden name was
Roma Diamentina, the latter given to the Queensland
western river Diamentina.
The municipality covers an area of 25 square miles
and contained in 1919 about 3,300 people, being the
chief town of the Maranoa district. It is blessed with
a specially pure healthy atmosphere and surrounded by
a magnificent fruit- and wine-growing district, fine
country extending in all directions. In 1874 a sketch
of Roma showed a post and telegraph office, police station,
and about a dozen houses. Though it became a muni-
cipality on May 25, 1867, lapsed in 1875, and was
re-established in 1876, the locality came early on to
the page of history.
Sir Thomas Mitchell, on his great exploring expedi-
tion of 1846, discovered and named Fitzroy Downs,
after Governor Fitzroy, and also Mount Abundance,
which overlooks Fitzroy Downs, and is about 20 miles
beyond Roma. Mitchell was in raptures over the
beautiful scenery and the natural richness of the
country, and it deserved all the eulogiums he passed.
In the following year (1847) a New South Wales
man named McPherson, a grazier, got a copy of
Mitchell’s chart and went out in Mitchell’s track to
Mount Abundance and took up Fitzroy Downs. In the
next year (April, 1848) McPherson was living in a bark
hut with only a camp-keeper as companion, and that
was how Leichhardt found him when he called there
on his way west on that expedition from which he never
returned. On April 4, 1848, Leichhardt wrote in
McPherson’s hut his last recorded letter, and it was
forwarded to Sydney by McPherson.
In that letter he thus refers to Mitchell: — ‘The
Fitzroy Downs over which we travelled about 22 miles
from east to west is indeed a splendid region, and Sir
Thomas Mitchell has not exaggerated their beauty. The
soil is pebbly and round, richly grassed, and of the most
fattening quality. I came right on Mount Abundance
and passed over a gap with my whole train.”
Following the course of the Cogoon it had led
Mitchell into a beautiful pastoral district around a soli-
tary hill which he named Mount Abundance, and here
Mitchell noticed the first bottle trees he had seen on his
journey. Where McPherson built his hut is about 20
miles from the site of the present Roma, the present
“Mount Abundance” Station, being only six miles out
of town, on Bungeworgora Creek, of which the Bungil
is merely a continuation.
When McPherson first settled at the real Mount
Abundance he had serious trouble with the blacks, and
appears to have come into collision with them from the
beginning. In after years he published a pamphlet
describing his adventures and troubles with the natives,
but it is extremely rare. It is astonishing that he and
the hut-keeper ever escaped alive. At the present
Mount Abundance, on the Bungeworgora Creek, there
are some very fine bottle trees near the house. There
also was established the first vineyard in that district,
and the vigneron in charge in 1889, an Italian named
Calcino, made excellent wines, especially santerne and
claret. He informed the writer that wines matured as
much in that climate in two years as in France or Italy
in five.
The first vineyard in Roma was established by
Bassett, whose son continues the industry. The Scottish
Commissioners visited it and sampled the wines during
their visit to- Roma.
Roma itself is an attractive town, well laid out and
well kept, the 37 miles of streets being in excellent
order. There are many excellent buildings, the
majority being of wood, and the public ones are
unusually good for a town of 3,000 people. It
has a mayor and town council, and the surround-
ing country is controlled by the Bungil Shire Council,
which has authority over 4,300 square miles. The dis-
trict possesses a great number of sheep, cattle, and
horses, and produces an immense quantity of wheat,
maize, grapes, oranges, a great variety of fruits, much
honey and beeswax, and many thousand gallons of wine.
There need be no doubt that W estern Queensland will
one day be among the greatest wine-growing countries
in the world.
Roma acquired considerable fame from a some-
what eccentric bore. The town is supplied with


water from three bores whose combined flow was 294,000
gallons, one being down 1,670 ft., one 3,700 ft., and one
3,715 ft. Gas was struck in two bores, and the town was
lighted by it for a while, but it suddenly ceased. Then the
gas in the 3,715-ft. bore caught fire and burned with a
tremendous flame until extinguished with some difficulty.
These emissions of gas encouraged the belief that oil
is likely to be below the gas, and so boring, with that
expectation, has been continued intermittently ever
since. There are over seventy bores in the Maranoa
district and about 100 sub-artesian, but none of the
others have shown any signs of gas or oil. One
on “Teeswater” Station is down 4,300 ft., with a daily
supply of 35,000 gallons; while on “Homeboin,” 30
miles from Bollon, gives 3,000,000 gallons daily. If
huge serpents, fringed by graceful trees, and termin-
ating in soft green fields on which the flocks of motion-
less sheep look like a panorama of uniformly-sized
boulders; overhead the beautiful blue sky flecked by
fleecy clouds, the argent and the azure, and the white
snow of the clouds, splendid heraldic field on which the
guardian divinities of the west march forth in stately
manner to some celestial tournament. But that is all
changed in drought time, for then there is
“A sea of stagnant idleness,
Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless.”
No grass, flowers, or running streams, no flocks of fat
sheep sleeping in the grateful shade of dense foliaged
trees; only the bare plains, the barren slopes, the sombre
valleys, the half-withered or dead trees, standing in
CHARLEVILLE.
Roma is in reality in an oil basin, and a payable flow
of oil is struck, that would be a splendid thing for
Queensland and make a considerable city of Roma. The
whole of the Maranoa district has a bounteous supply of
water from bores, apart from the creeks and lagoons
and rivers.
Going westward from Roma the line traverses some
very pleasing scenery characteristic of the west on the way
to Mitchell. Blue cone-shaped hills far off on the edge
of the horizon; beautiful park-like slopes dipping into
green meadows —meadow beyond meadow—variegated by
blue, white, and yellow flowers, intervening ridges
crested by weeping myall; turrets of trees standing out-
lined against the azure; long sinuous watercourses like
l 2
herbless solitudes, white skeletons, and dead and dying
stock. Then your heart goes out to the lion-hearted
squatters of the early days who faced floods, droughts,
the spear of the aborigine, hundreds of miles from civi-
lization. All honour to those brave adventurous men
of the olden time who were the stepping-stones for the
men of the present to march over the Australian
continent.
MUCKADILLA.
Beyond Roma, 26 miles, the train arrives at
Muckadilla, a place now famous for its bore and the
remarkable curative properties of the water, which is
radio-active and has effected some amazing cures,
especially in cases of rheumatism and sciatica. The bore


at first was sunk to get a water supply for the railway,
and at 3,800 ft. obtained an average daily flow of
17,000 gallons, emerging at a temperature varying
from 114° to 124°, that at the drinking tap
ranging from 85° to 112°. This water contains silica,
sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, carbonate of
magnesia, chloride of sodium, sulphate of sodium, and
some iron. The Queensland Government Analyst
(J. B. Henderson) reports on this spa water
in very flattering terms. There is a well-appointed
hotel, liberal bathing facilities, and the bore and the
hotel are only a few yards from the railway station.
MITCHELL.
On the way to Mitchell the train, at 13 miles beyond
Muckadilla, passes the beautiful Amby Downs; and
thence on to Mitchell, 54 miles beyond Roma, are light
open forest flats, low ridges with bottle trees, myall and
apple-tree flats, box gums, ironbark, and cypress pine.
Mitchell is a small but important town very pic-
turesquely situated close to the bank of the Maranoa
River and on the border of the beautiful Mitchell
Downs, taken up and named in 1854 by the late
Edmund Morey, who was for many years in the
seventies and eighties a well-known police magistrate in
Queensland. Mitchell at the end of 1920 had a popu-
lation of over a thousand. The Booringa Shire, which
includes the town, has an area of 8,400 square miles.
The town is neatly laid out with 24 miles of streets,
which are planted with white cedar, bottle trees, and
pepperinas. Mitchell is an advanced town with fine
shops and public buildings, banks, several clubs, a news-
paper, two racing clubs, a Chamber of Commerce, and
a Pastoral Association. The water supply is obtained
from artesian and sub-artesian bores, one with a depth
of 1,405 ft. and a daily flow of over 200,000 gallons at
a temperature of 98°. One sub-artesian bore, only
75 ft., gives an unlimited supply. In a rainless season
the channel of the Maranoa is only a bed of dry sand
at Mitchell.
Grapes, oranges, many other fruits, vegetables, and
wheat grow admirably, as much of the soil is decidedly
fertile, and can only fail when there is not enough rain.
Mitchell is the centre of a splendid pastoral district
and the depot for many important stations, including
“Mitchell Downs,” 2 miles; “Tyrconnel,” 30; “Amby
Downs,” 18; “Waroonga,” 18; “Forest Vale,” 50;
“Eurella,” 20; “Bowen Downs,” 35; “Mount Lons-
dale,” 13; “Redford,” 75; and “Salamis,” 50.
The town is comparatively new, the first house being
erected about 1869 or 1870. To-day coaches run to and
from Bollon, St. George, Westgrove, and Warrenville.
It is a district rich in sheep and cattle, and grows a
large quantity of wheat.
MORVEN.
At a distance of 57 miles beyond Mitchell is the
small but important town of Morven, named from the
Morven in Aberdeenshire. This also is a new town,
the first store being only started about 1878; but to-day
Morven is a prosperous place, the depot for a rich and
splendid pastoral country and the following large
stations:—“Ularunda,” 20 miles; “Chance Downs,”
30; “Maryvale,” 7; “Brunell,” 14; “Mount Maria,”
12; “Angellala,” 30; “Burenda,” 50; “Victoria
Downs,” 6; “Ivanhoe,” 4; “Alice Downs,” and
“Armadilla,” 12.
When Morven is left the line passes lightly-timbered
open country for about 16 miles, and then enters
scrubs of brigalow, mulga, myall, sandalwood, box
gum, and curriejong, with occasional bottle trees.
Of the weeping willow ( Acacia jpendnla) Lands-
borough, the explorer, writing from the head of the
Thomson River in 1862, said, “I love these trees, for
their foliage is beautiful, and the wood when cut has a
fine aromatic smell.”
Then across the splendid Victoria Downs rolling
far away in vast undulating green waves, like some
great field floating in mid air and rising and
falling under the pressure of the spectral winds,
bordered by the blue hills on the heads of the War-
rego, Maranoa, and Angellala, solemn in the purple
gloom of sunset, dark grey in the sombre noon, or
radiant with the glory of the dawn. Then through
monotonous scrubs of mulga, myall, and brigalow, silent
and shadowy and “lone as incarnate Death.” Through
avenues of tall grey bendee, past Alice Downs, nestling in
cypress pines and graceful apple trees, and on to Charle-
ville, to which the railway from Brisbane was opened
through on March 1, 1888.
CHARLEVILLE.
Charleville was surveyed and named by Surveyor
Tully (afterwards Surveyor-General of Queensland),
and he named it from the Charleville in his native
County of Cork, in Ireland. There is also a town of the
same name in France.
Charleville is a town on the bank of the Warrego
River, 966 ft. above sea level, the site having been part
of old “Gowrie Station.” The town is the centre of a
great pastoral district, northward, southward, and west-
ward. The following are a few of the stations and their
distances: —“Arabella,” 4 miles; “Riversleigh,” 9;
“Nive Junction,” 35; “Wellwater,” 12 ; “Burrendilla”
and “Dillaba,” 40; “Mount Morris,” 70; “Oakwood,”
60; and “Yarran Vale,” 70.
From Charleville you can ride or motor or drive
vici Augathella, Tambo, and Blackall to Barcaldine,
on the Rockhampton line. The climate is very


healthy, with a light dry atmosphere. In June the ther-
mometer falls to 27°, and in December and January
occasionally rises to 116°, but that would not be so
oppressive as 100° on the coast. The climate has
decidedly beneficial effects on people with throat or
lung trouble.
The children are healthy and the general popu-
lation hardy and energetic. The town is supplied with
plenty of good vegetables by Chinese gardeners on the
banks of the Warrego, from which they irrigate their
gardens. In dry seasons the river is merely a chain
of lagoons, some of them very deep, with a plentiful
supply of very fine Murray cod.
Here the visitor can still see the good old bullock
teams side by side with many horse teams, and the old
Range which separates the sources of the Warrego and
Maranoa from the Belyando and the Nogoa and other
eastern waters.
Charleville is now, and must always remain, an
important town, commanding an extensive trade from a
large area of prosperous pastoral country. It has made
great progress since the railway was opened in 1888, but
the trade of the lower Warrego either goes direct to
Brisbane or to Cunnamulla, a town 120 miles down the
river. A town which is a railway terminus is bound
to lose a certain amount of trade when that railway
is extended into an area whose trade the affected town
previously received, but Charleville must always com-
mand enough trade to ensure a permanent prosperity,
and which cannot be taken away by any rival centres.
CUNNAMULLA.
bullock driver, shearer, stockman, and drover in
all their pristine vigour. The fruits of Roma and
Toowoomba are supplied at very reasonable prices, and
even Moreton Bay oysters at Brisbane prices. An
artesian bore gives a never-failing supply of excellent
*water for drinking, cooking, and baths. The town has
a very creditable display of shops and several excellent
hotels. The soils of the district are remarkably fertile,
and need only rain or irrigation to give surprising
results. For the ornithologist the district holds splendid
possibilities. Kendal Broadbent in 1886 collected 96
different species of birds, and wrote a most interesting
paper on “The Birds of Charleville.”
The Warrego River, discovered and named by Sir
Thomas Mitchell, rises away in the Great Dividing
CUNNAMULLA.
The railway to Cunnamulla goes all the way parallel
with the Warrego River, which is plainly visible at
several points on the journey, and runs entirely over
dead-level country, chiefly open forest of box gums,
bendee, bloodwood, and gidya, with open glades at
intervals. It is a fine dry healthy grazing country, occu-
pied along the line by important stations, among which
are “Dillalah,” “Mangalore,’ 5 “Yanna,” “Murweh,”
“Elverston,” “Claverton,” and “Coongoola,” with
stations extending west to Cooper Creek and east to
the Maranoa and Balonne. There are large artesian
bores at “Murweh” and “Claverton” Stations on the
railway, throwing so far undiminished great streams of
water.


Cunnamulla is a town on the eastern bank of the
Warrego River, where there is a long deep waterhole in
the channel of the stream. The railway has so far
been running southward from Charleville towards the
New South Wales border, but is still 80 miles away, down
the river, from Barringun or Woorooroka, small border
villages, and 280 miles from the New South Wales rail-
way at Bourke.
Between the border and Cunnamulla are several
large stations—“Weelamurra,” “Barrenbilla,” “Cun-
namulla,” “Thurrulgoona,” “Owangowan,” “Tinen-
burra,” and “Noorama”; while eastward towards the
Neebine are “Balbuna,” “Clifton,” “Bendena,”
“Charlotte Plains,” “ Widgeegoara,” “Bundaleer,”
and “Tala,” and a great number of stations east of
the Neebine. “Tinenburra” was one of the favourite
stations of the late James Tyson. Westward of the
Warrego all the country is occupied by stations away to
the boundary of South Australia.
Cunnamulla is a prosperous town which has an ex-
tensive trade entirely among stations and station people.
It also has the advantage of being a railway terminus
for all the people southward to the New South Wales
border, westward to Cooper Creek, northward half-way to
Charleville, and eastward across the Neebine towards the
Bollon, although coaches run to the Bollon from Mit-
chell, thus saving to passengers bound for the coast the
long train journey round by Charleville. Cunnamulla
is supplied with water for baths and cooking from a bore
whose water is too hot for bathing until it has cooled
several degrees. The town stands in perfectly flat
country. The land in all directions is lightly-timbered
open forest, chiefly bauhinias, bloodwood, box, gums,
ironbark, and forest oaks.
A large trade is done by the stores and hotels, as
a great number of stations get their supplies from there
and consign their wool, sheep, and cattle to Brisbane.
Very little trade is done across the border with New
South Wales—chiefly the droving of cattle going to
New South Wales or Victoria. There are two or three
of the hotels of a superior class, and the same may be
said of the stores.
It has a healthy climate with all-round tempera-
tures about the same as Charleville.
The road to the westward and Thargomindah starts
from Cunnamulla, crosses the Warrego near the town,
and goes direct to Eulo, a small settlement on the Paroo
River with a post and telegraph office, police station, a
couple of hotels, and two small stores. The Paroo can
hardly be dignified by the name of a river, as it is not
more than 20 yards wide, and in dry weather is merely a
chain of detached small waterholes. It runs out of
Queensland over the border below “Currawinya” Station
near Hungerford, and is remarkable for a series of mud
springs all along each side of its course, either close to
the river or a little distance back. Some of these mud
springs are masses of hard clay from 4 to 10 ft. in
height; others are low mounds, dangerous quagmires
where a man or a horse would go out of sight and be
smothered; and a few discharge small rivulets of pure
water which finally reaches the Paroo. There is a fine
spring of this kind near Eulo, about a quarter of a mile
from the town, bordered by a very beautiful minute
bright green aquatic plant resembling a rich moss.
Many of the springs are dead, leaving only the cone or
dome of clay that they have thrown up while active.
Eulo is dependent on a few neighbouring stations and
the traffic passing to and from Thargomindah.
THARGOMINDAH.
Thargomindah is westward of Cunnamulla, from
which it is distant 135 miles.
The way to Thargomindah is by a fairly good road
over country which is all a dead level, apart from a few
insignificant rises, and is not too well watered, there
being considerable waterless stretches in a dry season.
The town stands on high ground on the western side
of the Bulloo River, there about 30 yards in width, with
high, steep banks. Behind the town is a barren ridge
covered with stones, with a few bushes of gidya.
The situation is not attractive, especially in a dry
season. The town stands oil old “Thargomindah”
Station from which it takes its name, the local aboriginal
word for the porcupine (Echidna aculeata).
The town is supplied by a bore which discharges
water at a high temperature and under great pressure,
which has been economically used to give the town an
electric light supply, the only one in the west.
It is one of the western towns subject to occasional
duststorms, which are extremely unpleasant, but the
general health is good and there is nothing wrong with
the climate.
There is no town westward of Thargomindah in
South-western Queensland, only a post office, small
store, public-house, and half a dozen houses being at
Noccundra, 10 miles west of “Nocatunga” Station, on
the Wilson River. Thargomindah is a prosperous town
with good stores, police station, police magistrate, fairly
good public-houses, a newspaper, and an intelligent and
progressive population.
When the traveller is going from Dalby to Charle-
ville by rail he crosses a large number of creeks and three
rivers, all running southward into New South Wales,
ultimately to reach the sea by the Murray mouth, near
Adelaide. The first he crosses is the Condamine River and
Dogwood Creek at Miles, which runs into the Condamine,
and that runs into the Balonne. which finally reaches the
border as three rivers—the Culgoa, Ballandool, and


Narran. Then comes the Bungil Creek (on which Roma
stands), the Coogoon River, and Maranao, all running
into the Balonne. Between Mitchell and Morven is a
whole series of creeks, including Mungallala, Dulbydilla,
Wallum, and the Nebine Creek, all flowing south into the
Culgoa, or lower Balonne. From the railway to the
border of New South Wales is a general distance of about
180 miles, comprising a vast area of very rich and
important pastoral country, all occupied by stations,
some of which, especially on the Weir, Maclntyre,
Moonie, and Balonne, are among the oldest in
Queensland.
Some of the first occupiers were driven off their
stations by the blacks, who were uniformly hostile,
doubtless in many cases with good reason. A number
which controls an area of 5,100 square miles. It is the
centre of a rich sheep and cattle district with a little
farming, dairying, fruit growing, and market garden-
ing. There are wide streets planted with native
bauhinia trees, which have a fine effect when flowering.
It is a well-laid-out, clean, healthy town. The water
supply is pumped from the river, in which Murray cod,
bream, silver and golden perch, and fresh water dew
fish are numerous; while there is a fair amount of
game in the neighbourhood, including scrub and
plain turkeys, black duck and wood duck, and three
varieties of pigeons. The town contains all the
usual public offices and the clubs of much larger
towns, with a progress association and tennis, athletic,
and two racing clubs.
CUNNAMULLA.
of men, especially shepherds, were killed by the blacks.
A son of Weir took up old “Collandoon” Station, and
after him the Weir River is named. It runs into the
Barwon.
SURAT.
Between our western line and the border are several
towns deserving of mention, including five along the
border. The chief towns are St. George and Surat, both
on the Balonne River. The oldest is Surat, which goes
back into the fifties of last century. It is situated on
the Balonne, 47 miles very slightly south-westward from
Yeulba, on the line to Roma, 50 miles from Roma and
328 miles north-west of Brisbane, with a present popula-
tion (at the end of 1920) of over 300. It has an
elevation of 820 ft. and lies within the Warroo Shire,
A great stimulus will be given to Surat when it
becomes the terminus of the Tara railway running out
from Dalby.
Some of the settlers irrigate their fruit and veget-
ables from the river, which has abundance of water.
Surat is the centre of a district essentially pastoral,
having about 600,000 head of sheep, 24,000 head of
cattle, and over 4,000 head of horses. The height above
sea level ensures an excellent climate.
Coaches run to and fro regularly between Surat,
Yeulba, Mitchell, and Roma, and all traffic is done by
the Western Railway.
Among the neighbouring stations are “Noorindoo,”
“Combango,” “Warkon,” “Canmaroo,” “Yalebow,”
“Coogoon,” and “Wallabella.”


ST. GEORGE.
St. George is an important town about 80 miles
lower down the Balonne than Surat, and 127 miles from
Yeulba Railway Station, or 52 miles from Thallon Rail-
way Station, on the Dirranbandi line from Warwick,
so it can be approached by two railways, much the
shorter coach journey being from Thallon. When Sir
Thomas Mitchell was out on his famous exploring
expedition of 1846 he crossed the Balonne over a reef
of rocks on St. George’s Day, and he named that reef
“St. George’s Bridge.” That is where St. George is
to-day, and thence the name of the town, which has a
population of over 800 people. The streets are wide
and planted with pepperina trees, jacarandas, and white
cedar, giving a very fine effect. It stands 650 ft. above
the sea, and is admirably laid out, with a very fine
esplanade on the bank of the river which at that spot
displays a noble stretch of water. That esplanade is
called “The Terrace,” and is the chief business thor-
oughfare. There are four miles of well-kept streets, and
the town is all in squares. The water requirements are
supplied by an artesian bore with a depth of 2,708 ft.,
giving a daily flow of 338,000 gallons at a temperature
of 135°, with a pressure of 100 lb. to the square inch.
Mains are laid from this bore, and the water supplies
all needs, including the public plunge and shower
baths. St. George is the centre of a splendid pastoral
country of which the Balonne Shire Council controls
21,700 square miles.
There is a little mixed farming, dairying, and fruit
growing, but so far it is a purely sheep and cattle dis-
trict, though the time is coming fast when the
remarkable fertility of the soil and the facilities for
irrigation will establish agriculture and fruit growing
on a much more extensive scale.
St. George is a very up-to-date and progressive
town with two public halls, iceworks, picture shows,
two motor garages, clubs for football, tennis,
cricket, swimming, boating, shooting, and athletics,
polo grounds, and two racing clubs. It has a fire
brigade, dramatic, musical, and debating societies,
pastoral and agricultural society, and a bi-weekly
newspaper, with all the usual public offices and
churches, and generally a good class of buildings;
in reality one of the most prosperous western towns in
Queensland.
The district represents over a million of sheep,
26,000 head of cattle, and 8,000 horses. Pumpkins,
melons, and grapes grow to perfection and in great
quantities. The climate is uniformly healthy, as proved
by the energy of the people and their fresh appearance.
Horse coaches run regularly via Surat to and from
Yeulba or direct with Roma, and a motor coach runs
to and from Thallon Railway Station. There is good
fishing in the Balonne among the Murray cod, golden
perch, and the fresh water dew fish. It will make a
tremendous difference to St. George when it is con-
nected with the railway via Dirranbandi.
Many well-known fine stations surround this old
historic town, among them being “Boombah,” “Gulnar-
bar,” “Doondi,” “Burgurrah,” “Boolba,” the two
“Cahmeres,” “Thomby,” “Cypress Downs,” “Wagoo,”
“Warroo,” “Boah,” “Whyentah,” and “Ballandool.”
HUNGERFORD.
Away down the Paroo River, 100 miles southward of
Thargomindah and on the left bank of the river where
it crosses the border into New South Wales, is the little
township of Hungerford, which is 128 miles from the
nearest railway station at Cunnamulla. It receives
mails from Eulo, Bourke, and Wilcannia, and has a
population of about 250. There is a resident C.P.S.,
but the police magistrate from Charleville is the official
magistrate. The Customs officer in pre-Federal days
acted for both States, and each State to-day is repre-
sented by an insjsector of stock, as Hungerford is on an
important stock route.
It is a prosperous little town with two hotels, four
stores, and four churches. There are clubs for racing,
cricket, golf, and tennis. The nearest stations are
“Currawinya,” “Boorara,” “Yooleenya,” and “Curra-
canya.” The Paroo, like all the other Queensland
rivers that cross the border, finally ends in the Darling,
a tributary of the Murray.
Eastward along the border from Hungerford, 75
miles, is a small settlement called Wooroorooka, on the
Warrego River, about 50 miles by road below Cunna-
mulla. Near it are two large stations, “Thurrulgoona”
and “Bundaleer,” and just across the border in New
South Wales is another small settlement called Bar-
ringim. Eastward along the border is a small village
called Hebei, about 125 miles from Wooroorooka, on
the Bokhara River, which is merely, like the Narran
and Culgoa, one of the channels of the Balonne when
that river divides into four streams before reaching the
Darling. Hebei is now only 40 miles southward from the
Dirranbandi railway station, on the Goodiwindi line,
and is distant 100 miles from the railway town of Moree
in New South Wales. The people get mails via Goodooga
in New South Wales and Dirranbandi. It is a small
town with a hotel, two stores, police station, and two
stock inspectors, being maintained chiefly by traffic on
the stock route.
Due eastward from Hebei along the border is the
small town of Mungundi, pronounced Mung-un-dye.
TAROOM.
Northward of the railway running westward from
Brisbane to Cunnamulla are two or three small but


important towns deserving of mention. One of these is
Taroom, on the Daw r son River, a tributary of the Fitzroy,
Central Queensland water; but the business of Taroom
is done with the South and Western Railway, by road to
Juandah, and thence 43 miles by rail to Miles railway
station, which is 231 miles westward of Brisbane. Several
creeks join the Dawson near Taroom. This river was
discovered and named by Leichhardt on his first expedi-
tion to Port Essington.
The word Taroom was the blacks’ name of a native
lime which grows there, a very beautiful tree bearing
a small lime fruit about the size of the middle finger.
Taroom has a population of about 600 people, and is a
prosperous town in the midst of a very fine pastoral
district, among neighbouring stations being “Broad-
mere,” “Bungeban,” “Coorada,” “Glenhaughton,”
and the Upper Dawson will always go southward by rail
and road to Miles, and thence to Brisbane.
AUGATHELLA.
Away westward, on the Upper Warrego, 52 miles
north-eastward from Charleville, is the small township
of Augathella, with a population of about 300, in the
midst of a very important pastoral district, and with
all the usual public buildings, hotels, and stores of an
ordinary town.
Among the neighbouring stations are “Babbi-
loora,” “Burenda,” “Bayrick,” “Biddenham,” “Boga-
rella,” “Hoganthulla,” “Nive Downs,” “Oakwood,”
“Highfields,” “Dunstan,” “Chatham,” and “Byrgenna.”
Coaches, motor cars, and drays provide for all the
passenger and goods traffic to and from Charleville and
CATTLE SALE AT CHARLEVILLE.
“Ghinghinda,” “Gwambagwine,” “Hornet Bank,”
“Kinnoul,” “Lily Vale,” and “Palm Tree.” “Hornet
Bank” was the scene of the terrible massacre of the
Fraser family by the blacks in 1857, the tragedy includ-
ing Mrs. Fraser, four daughters, and three sons, a man
acting as tutor, and two men acting as shepherds, a
total of eleven persons, only one of the sons escaping, a
boy about twelve years of age.
Taroom to-day (1920) is the site of a Government
aboriginal station and is a very important centre of
trade with the stations on Dawson waters. The Dawson
junctions with the Fitzroy away north-eastward near
Duaringa, the Fitzroy having been then joined by the
Comet, Nogoa, and Mackenzie. All the trade of Taroom
the railway. Coaches run from Augathella to Tambo
and Blackall, and thence to Barcaldine.
ADAVALE.
Westward from Charleville about 116 miles is a
small town called Adavale, 600 miles westward of Bris-
bane, on the head waters of the Bulloo River, and in
the midst of important cattle and sheep country,
surrounded by very large stations, including “Thy-
lungra,” “Bulgroo,” “Milo,” “Emudilla,” “North
Comongin,” “Gumbardi,” and “Listowel Valley.”
The shire of Adavale includes a population of about
750, the Warrego district about 1,400. Practically all
business is done with Charleville by coaches and drays
and motors.


WINDORAH.
There are only two small towns due westward
from Adavale, and those are Windorah and Birds-
ville. Windorah is 256 miles westward from
Charleville, 700 westward from Brisbane, and has
a population of about 200 people. It also is
the centre of a splendid pastoral district, among
the stations being “Colwyn,” “Caralle,” “Currawilla,”
“Galway Downs,” “Hammon Downs,” “Kerongooloo,”
“Lynwood,” “Morney Plains,” “Mayfield,” “Mount
Leonard,” “Maroo,” “Tanbar,” and “Palparara.”
Windorah trades with both Charleville and Longreach.
Windorah is a very small town on the bank of
Cooper Creek, which was found and named by Sturt.
Then Mitchell found and named it the Victoria River,
but Kennedy followed and discovered it was the Cooper
Creek of Sturt and called it the Barcoo, which to-day
is the name retained by the upper waters of Cooper
Creek, the lower part still retaining the name given by
Sturt. In flood time the Cooper will spread to a width
of 20 miles, but in dry time it is only a chain of lagoons,
some far apart, a few deep enough to float a warship,
and abounding in fine fish.
These far-western towns may be small, with one or
two hotels, a couple of stores, and half a dozen trades-
men ; but they are important and useful centres away
among the far-scattered people of the western “Never-
Never.” They are all built on level country with vast
open downs or flat lightly-timbered forest country
stretching away in all directions, the timber usually
being gidya, mulga, bloodwood, bendee, boree, “yah-
punya” (a drooping eucalyptus), leopard wood, box
gums, and the large gums which border the
watercourses.
In that far-western climate the temperature may rise
to 125°, or even 130°, but it is a light, dry, rare atmos-
phere, the heat of which is more endurable than 100° on
the coast, and the western people are strong and active
and healthy, the worst evil being the too-frequent plague
of flies and occasional sand flies.
BIRDSVILLE.
About 300 miles westward of Windorah is Birdsville,
nearly a thousand miles westward by road from Brisbane
and only seven miles from the borders of South Australia,
being actually more easily accessible by way of Adelaide
and Hergott Springs than from Longreach or Charleville.
The population is not more than fifty, but there are
two hotels and two stores. The town stands on dead-
level, monotonous country, lightly-grassed stony plains,
and dreary sand ridges.
The average rainfall is only 6 inches, and the district
is subject to long droughts. The town stands near the
course of the Diamantina River, which after dividing
into various channels, billabongs, and anabranches is
finally lost in North Lake Eyre, never reaching the sea.
The Mulligan and Eyre Creek join the Diamantina
below Birdsville, and so they, too, also end in Lake Eyre.
Had the boundary line between Queensland and South
Australia been extended southward as it should have
been to the 29th parallel instead of being cut off at the
26th, Queensland would have taken in all the lower
Diamantina and Cooper Creek, and our south-western
corner would have been along the eastern border of Lake
Eyre and would have run across Lake Gregory.
An area of 200 miles square is cut off that corner of
Queensland, and Birdsville is in the centre of the top of
that square, the southern boundary of the two States
being only seven miles away, and the boundary on the
west being 100 miles away. The nearest Queensland lake
to Birdsville is Lake Machattie due north 75 miles,
Lake Yamma-Yamma lies away 125 miles to the east-
ward, or slightly south-eastward, and about 25 miles
eastward from the Queensland boundary.
Birdsville, in a direct line from Brisbane, is 900
miles, and the South Australian boundary is still 100
miles away on the 26th parallel. The actual width of
Queensland, along that parallel, from South Australia
to Double Island Point at Wide Bay is 950 miles.
Queensland is a vast country of magnificent
distances.


The late DANIEL WIENHOLT.
The Wienholt family, so well
known throughout Queensland,
trace their ancestry back to the
early years of the seventeenth

century, the original member of
whom records exist springing from
the Austrian aristocracy. About the
period referred to above this indi-
vidual went to England, of which
country he subsequently became a
naturalized subject in 1675. Settling
in the first instance in London, the
Wienholts afterwards removed to

Berkshire, and eventually estab-
lished their family seat in the south
of Wales, this being known as
“Llaugharne Castle,” Carmarthen-
shire. The Wienholt family is now
extinct on the Continent, and has
almost died out in England, though
a few of its members of the
feminine sex still reside in different
parts of the United Kingdom. The
late John Birkett Wienholt, father
of Mr. Daniel Wienholt, followed
the calling of what was known as a
“gentleman farmer,” pursuing the
avocation of a landed proprietor in
South Wales, like his progenitors
before him, his father having united
with rural interests the business of
a London merchant, in which he was
eminently successful, being one of
the well-known commercial figures of
the period. A brother of Mr. John
Birkett Wienholt, Daniel Wienholt,
is recorded as having been lost in
His Britannic Majesty’s frigate,
“Lutine” off the coast of Holland
on the night of October 9, 1799, and
to his memory is erected a tablet in
Westerland Church, in the Isle of
Sylt. Jewellery and other personal
property found on his body when
washed ashore some time afterwards
form interesting relics, indicative of
the importance of the family at that
period. Mr. John Birkett Wienholt
had seven sons, four of whom settled
in Australia, viz., Arnold, who came
to Australia in the late forties,
settling at “Maryvale” Station,
Darling Downs, and died a bachelor;
Edward, who had three sons (Ar-
nold, Edward Arthur, and William
Humphrey Merrick) and three
daughters; Arthur, who had two
sons (Daniel and Frederick Edward)
and six daughters; and Daniel who
came out in the middle fifties and
subsequently went into business at
Ipswich (Wienholt & Walker). He
died, leaving one son, John Daniel,
who now resides in retirement at
Brisbane. Mr. John Birkett Wien-
holt died at “Llaugharne” Castle in
1851, his mortal remains being
interred in the parish church.
About the period when the settle-
ment of the British colonies in the
southern seas had declared itself a
success, Mr. Arnold Wienholt, then
a mere youth, but full of the spirit
of adventure, set his face towards
that distant part of the Empire,
which was much in the nature of a
terra incognita to the great majority
of quiet dwellers in the country
districts of England and Wales. He
landed at Sydney, New South Wales,
in the late forties, and in course of
time turned his attention to the
pastoral industry. Being possessed
of some family capital, and being
able to turn to the Old Country for
further financial support when re-
quired, within a year after his
arrival in Australia, he purchased
“Maryvale,” on the Darling Downs,
one of the most historic pastoral
MR. DANIEL WIENHOLT.
holdings in Queensland. The success
of this undertaking so impressed his
brothers in England that two of
them came out to join him in 1853,
and at a subsequent date these two
younger Wienholts, Edward and
Arthur, took up Crown Lands at
“Moogera,” forming a property
MR. ARNOLD WIENHOLT.
which afterwards was incorporated
with the “Fassifern” Estate, which
was the home of the late Arthur
Wienholt for a number of years.
The elder of the two, Edward, went


to Rosalie Plains, and became asso-
ciated in partnership with the late
William Kent, of “Jondaryan,” and
about the same time Arthur joined
the late Mr. Hardy, inaugurating
MR. EDWARD WIENHOLT.
the firm of Wienholt & Hardy,
which became possessed by purchase
from William Kent, of "Fassifern,”
about the year 1860. During the
fifties the Wienholt family purchased
LT.-COL. W. H. M. WIENHOLT, D.S.O.
“Blythedale,” on the Maranoa
River, which subsequently they dis-
posed of, and their acquisition of
landed property during the succeed-
ing years included "Fassifern,”
“Rosalie Plains,” “Goomburra,”
and “Jondaryan,” on the Darling
Downs; "Degilbo,” on the Burnett;
and, when the Mitchell and western
districts were opened up in the early
seventies, they took up "Saltern
Creek,” "Katandra,” and "War-
enda,” enormous leasehold proper-
ties, upon which they spent large
sums of money in costly improve-
ments. In addition, at one time
they owned "Mount Hutton,” on
the Upper Dawson, and the agri-
cultural estates of "Rosewood” and
"Tarampa,” within 50 miles of
Brisbane. In these vast pastoral
operations Edward Wienholt was
the prominent spirit, his bouyant
sanguine spirit leading him to make
big ventures with a dash and self-
reliance which, nevertheless, was
tempered by a native shrewdness
which caused him seldom to make a
mistake. He was distinguished by
liberality in his administration of
affairs, and was always sans peur et
sans reproche in all his dealings.
Both Edward and Arnold Wienholt
became members of the Queensland
Legislature, the former retaining
his seat in the House of Assembly
as representative for the Darling
Downs district for a number of
years. It was recognized that, had
he been able to spare time for the
close application required by pol-
itical life, his shrewd judgment and
great experience of the colony would
soon have entitled him to office. He
held strong views on the subject of
fiscal reform, and was the author of
various pungent letters on the
subject, foreseeing that the colonies
must suffer in their markets by the
overweening mastery of America
and Germany. The latter 20 years
of his life he resided in England, in
the neighbourhood of the Wye, but
frequently took trips to Australia
to look after his properties (which
were confined solely to Queensland).
He married a daughter of the late
Daniel Williams, a well-known
Queensland pastoralist who, origin-
ally, was successfully engaged as a
railway contractor in this State. Of
the three sons and three daughters
of this union, the eldest son, Arnold,
a man of extraordinary character
and ability, was born at "Goom-
burra” Station, on the Darling
Downs, in November, 1877, in course
of time of time being sent to Eton
to be educated. Returning to Aus-
tralia, he obtained his early pastoral
experience on "Jondaryan” Station,
but at the outbreak of the Boer war
in South Africa he offered his
service to the Empire as a soldier
and, being accepted, straightway
proceeded to the scene of hostilities.
He served throughout the war as a

Queensland Imperial Bushmen’s
Contingent, refusing a commission
which was offered him by the
military authorities, and for his
services was awarded the Queen’s

medal with clasps. Upon his return
to the land of his birth, he took
over the management of "Widgee
Widgee” Station, one of his grand-
father’s properties, situated near


Gympie, where he continued for a
few years. In 1908 he accompanied
his cousin, Mr. Daniel Wienholt, to
England, and in that year assumed
the office of manager of the Wienholt

resigning in 1913 to test his success
with the electors of the Wide Bay
constituency, which at that period
was represented by the then Federal
Prime Minister, Mr. Andrew Fisher,
afterwards Federal High Com-
missioner for the Commonwealth
in London. In this venture, how-
ever, he suffered defeat, although a
very big poll was recorded to his
credit. In August, 1913, Mr.
Arnold Wienholt went on a trip to
South Africa, with big game shoot-
ing as his objective. Lie registered
some excellent results, but had the
misfortune to get badly mauled by
a lion he had wounded, and which
in return inflicted upon him con-
siderable injury. War between
Britain and Germany breaking out
whilst he was in South Africa, Mr.
Wienholt returned to Australia with
the object of joining the Australian
Imperial Forces, but his right arm,
which was almost useless as a result
of his encounter with the lion,
prevented the acceptance of his
services. Lie then offered to find and
equip a force to fight the enemy over
the country he knew so well, which
the Government could not see its
way clear to accept. Mr. Wienholt
thereupon returned to Africa and
served the Rhodesian Government
as intelligence scout on the German
South-west Angola border (Portu-
guese West Africa). Following the
capitulation of German South-west
Africa, Captain Wienholt took part
in the fighting against the Boer
rebels and the German Camel Corps.
His next appointment was that of
intelligence officer to the Imperial
Forces in East Africa, and he was
on active service in German East
Africa until the signing of the
armistice, in November, 1918. He
was a prisoner for six months in
German East Africa, but managed
to evade his captors one dark and
stormy night, and after 15 days
travelling through the bush reached
the English lines in safety. Captain
Wienholt was awarded the D. 5.0.,
and the Military Cross with a bar.
He was married on April 29, 1919, to
Enid Sydney, daughter of the late C.
Sydney Jones, formerly of the firm of
Rees, R., & Sydney Jones, solicitors,
Rockhampton, Queensland. Captain

1916. The late Daniel Wienholt was
born at “Blythedale,” in the
Maranoa district of Queensland, on
February 20, 1866. He received his
education at Harrow, England, and
for 17 years. On account of ill-
health, Mr. Daniel Wienholt at
length severed his connection with
the “Never-Never country,” and
settling down nearer civilization, in


1901 assumed the management of
“Fassifern” Estate. Seven years
later he accepted the post of
secretary to the Wienholt Estates
Company, Limited, which he retained
up to the time of his death on
August 22, 1919. Though a man of
retiring disposition, and disinclined
for the responsibility of public office,
he held the Commission of the
Peace, which he exercised for a
lengthy period, and was a member of
the Queensland Club, the Q.T.C.,
and of other social organizations.
In 1903 Mr. Wienholt married
Emily Joan, daughter of the late
William Moore King, a medical
practitioner, well known over the
north and west districts of Queens-
land for over 20 years, and had a
family of two sons and two
daughters.
JAMES LANG, of “Sharow,”
Jimbour, was born at Coghill Creek,
Clunes, Victoria, in the year 1861.
He is the third son of the late John
Lang, of “Pine Lodge,” Tocumwal,
New South Wales, formerly of
Argyllshire, Scotland, where the
family had followed farming occupa-
tions for generations. With three
MR. JAMES LANG.
brothers he came to Australia in
1852, landing at Port Melbourne,
Victoria. The quartette immediately
joined in the rush to the Ballarat
goldfields, and were richly rewarded
in their search for the precious metal,
it being no uncommon event for them
to collect as much as 1 lb. weight of
gold from an ordinary billycan of
washdirt. On one occasion nuggets
weighing 115 lbs. were unearthed by
the party. In the course of 12 months
the brothers had secured sufficient
gold to enable them comfortably to
settle on the land, and an area of
the fertile acres near Colac, in the
western district of Victoria, was pur-
chased outright. Mr. James Lang,
the father of our subject, however,
proceeded to Coghill Creek, Clunes,
in the vicinity of Ballarat, where he
took up a considerable block of
country, and engaged in farming and
grazing pursuits. This was in 1853,
and for the following 13 years he
successfully carried on, selling out in
1866 to purchase a property, 2,000
acres in extent, at Kyneton, in the
same State. This was also devoted to
farming and grazing, and during the
11 years in which he worked this
estate he considerably improved his
financial position. At the same time
he also worked a property near
Rochester, disposing of the last-
named and the Kyneton acres in
1877 to proceed to the Riverina dis-
trict of New South Wales. Here he
purchased an 8,000-acre block ad-
jacent to the town of Deniliquin, and
turned his attention to the raising of
sheep on a fairly large scale. Some
three years later he entered into
possession of “Mount Sturt” Station,
situated on the Queensland border,
in a northerly direction from Broken
Hill. The area of this property was
168.000 acres, capable of carrying a
flock of 30,000 sheep, besides a fair
number of cattle and horses. As with
all his previous operations on the
land, this pastoral venture was
attended by excellent results. About
1884 Mr. Lang sold his property at
Deniliquin, and settled at Tocumwal,
purchasing “Pine Lodge,” embracing
12.000 acres of first-class land, with
a valuable frontage to the Murray
River. Mr. Lang made this his
permanent home, and proceeded to
develop and beautify the estate, and
at the time of his decease in 1894 it
was regarded as one of the most
highly-improved properties of similar
size to be found in any part of New
South Wales. He married at Coghill
Creek, Victoria, in 1853, Elizabeth,
daughter of the late John Robertson,
of Glasgow, Scotland, the issue of
the union being five sons and two
daughters. His third son, James, the
subject of our notice, received his edu-
cation by private tuition at Coghill

Creek and Kyneton. At 16 years
of age he had finished his scholastic
course, and thenceforth he assisted
his father in the conduct of his
farming and grazing operations. His
subsequent training, however, was
mostly confined to the sheep industry
on “Mount Sturt,” which was under
the control of Mr. Lang and his
brothers for a period of 10 years,
during which severe hardships were
encountered and many trying times
battled through. While pioneering
on this station two of the brothers
crossed the “Great Divide,” and were
buried in the lonely country which
by their pluck and endurance they
had helped to render habitable for
generations to follow. In 1890 James
and his brother Archibald entered
into partnership, and purchased
“Mount Sturt” from their father,
working it on the original lines for
14 years. On the death of his
brother, Mr. Lang purchased his
share, and carried on on his own
account for three years, when he sold
the run at a satisfactory figure to
Messrs. Bartlett & Morrison. During
the 27 years he was at “Mount
Sturt” the property was thoroughly
improved, considerable fencing being
erected, and much attention given to
the conservation of water. Some of


the tanks excavated were of huge
proportions, and held sufficient water
to meet all requirements for a couple
of years. Large provision was neces-
sary in this direction, as in some
years the rainfall for the district
was so small as to be practically
negligible. When “Mount Sturt”
was first taken up Broken Hill was
not in existence, and there was
scarcely a track to mark the outpost
of civilization. Prolonged droughts
frequently rendered the country
impassable, and on these occasions
the supply of flour invariably ran
out, the station inhabitants being
compelled to exist on a meat diet for
days at a stretch. When Broken Hill
was discovered the news was con-
veyed to “Mount Sturt” by “bush
telegraph” (mouth to mouth), a dis-
tance of 200 miles. In 1907 Mr. Lang
settled his family in Melbourne, and
travelled about in search of suitable
properties in which to invest his
capital. He purchased “Glenmore,”
in the Cootamundra district, in 1908,
selling out after 12 months at a good
profit. The year following he visited
Hew Zealand, but finding the land
priced at too high a figure, he
returned to Australia, arriving at
Queensland in 1910. After inspect-
ing several properties, his choice fell
on “Sharow,” an estate of 8,000
acres, situated on the Dalby-Bell
railway line, besides which he owns
a further 4,000 acres in the same dis-
trict. Mr. Lang promptly proceeded
"SHAROW” HOMESTEAD.
with the work of improving the
“Sharow” area. He erected a very
fine homestead, fitted with every
modern comfort and convenience. A
perfect water service has been laid
on, each bedroom being provided
with running water, which is drawn
from a permanent spring close to the
house. The garden has been artistic-
ally laid out, and spacious lawns of

buffalo grass add to the charm of the
surroundings. The soil on “Sharow”
is principally a sandy loam, mostly
of volcanic origin, and is very pro-
ductive. The timber, chiefly box
forest, has been rung, and scrub areas
cleared off and sown with Rhodes
grass, besides which the natural
grasses and herbage put forth a
strong growth. The property is
watered by the Downfall and Bowen
Creeks, this supply being augmented
from 10 wells, fitted with windmills,
supplementary power being provided
on three of these by Fuller and
Johnston engines. Lucerne is culti-
vated on the creek flats, and has
proved of inestimable value as fodder
for the stock. An average rainfall of
30 inches, combined with the fine
qualities of the soil, has rendered
“Sharow” immune from drought.
Originally stocked with sheep, these
have given place to Hereford cattle,
and the “Sharow” herd is noted for
its quality, bulls from the famous
“Gunyan" and “Lyndley” studs
being used on first-class cows. As a
breeder Mr. Lang proceeds in a most
unobtrusive way, but his stock is well
known throughout Queensland, and
finds a ready market. Some of his
steers were recently sold at Dalby,
realizing £8 per head. These animals
were of the fine-boned, fleshy type
aimed at by Hereford breeders, and
showed every promise of developing
into large-framed bullocks of great
weight. Mr. Lang takes a great
interest in affairs of local moment,
and accords his support to all matters
affecting the public weal. He married
in 1890 Margaret, daughter of Mr.
James Andrew, of “Glen Hope,”
Kyneton, Victoria, and has three
sons and three daughters. Of the
sons, two, Douglas Robert and James

and afterwards taken prisoner by
the enemy.
WILLIAM EDWARD CLIVE
SUGDEN, “Woodsome Lees,” Jan-
dowae, is the youngest son of Mr.
G. F. Sugden, of Melbourne, Vic-
toria, a prominent pastoralist of the
Riverina country, who originally
came to Australia with his parents
in 1849, when a child only eight
years of age. Mr. G. F. Sugden’s
father, the late Joshua Sugden, was
born in Yorkshire, England, where
he was the owner of woollen mills,
and also of “Woodsome Lees” and
‘ Springfield Lodge”, in Kirkburton,
in that county. He enjoyed a con-
siderable reputation as a wool ex-
pert, and, shortly after landing in
Melbourne purchased a sheep station
near Kilmore, Victoria, later suc-
cessfully following the occupation of
sheep and wool classer. Mr. G. F.
Sugden was brought up on his


father’s station, and subsequently
became the owner of a fine estate
of 12,000 acres freehold on the Mur-
ray River, near Tocumwal, New
South Wales, which he called after
his English property, “Woodsome
Lees.” He shared in the stirring
experiences of the bushranging days,
and suffered the vexation of an
attempted attack from one of his
former employes, who had left his
service to join a gang of bushrangers.
Mr. G. F. Sugden was one of the
first to perceive the great advantage
of scouring the wool on the stations,
and inaugurated this practice at
“Naranderra,” “Corowa,” and “To-
cumwal,” on the first-named station
installing electrically-driven machin-
ery. He played a useful part as a
pioneer in the introduction of this
and other advanced methods in his
time, and now lives in retirement at
the Victorian metropolis. The
gentleman under review, Mr. W. E.
C. Sugden, was born at “Tocum-
wal,” on July 7, 1893, and received
his education at “The Grange”
School, South Yarra, subsequently
attending the Church of England
Grammar School, Melbourne, where
he concluded his scholastic career at
sixteen years of age. Choosing life
on the land as his vocation he pro-
ceeded in the capacity of jackaroo to
“Yanko” Station, New South Wales,
which was devoted by the owner, Sir
Samuel Wilson, to sheep-raising
purposes. Here he remained for
three years, during that period gain-
ing a good working knowledge of the
industry. In 1913 having decided
purchase “Woodsome Lees” was prac-
tically undeveloped, the boundary

ing almost the whole of the completed

aspect of things, however, speedily
was altered by the new owner, who,
settling down upon his newly-
acquired property, brought to bear
upon its development an energy and
zeal which could not fail to be pro-
ductive of highly satisfactory results.
The country consists of open areas,
which, originally, were fairly thickly
timbered with box and scrub, but
now, as a result of ring-barking
operations and clearing, present the
appearance of well-grassed pastures,
with good stock-carrying capacity.
The boundary fences of the estate
have been rendered secure with dog-
proof wire-netting, and sub-division
into three large paddocks has been
made, while in a favourable situation
deep verandahs encircling the whole
structure; and surrounding the
house is an attractive garden,
famous for its roses, where lawns of
buffalo grass present a cool and
pleasant appearance. The residence
is provided with a plant for the
generating of air gas, by means of
which an effective lighting service
has been secured, and water is laid
on from adjacent bores, windmills
being employed in raising it to ele-
vated tanks, from which it is
brought by gravitation to the re-
quired spot. Prior to the severe
drought of 1915 the country was
devoted to sheep, carrying an aver-
age of sheep to the acre, but,
subsequent to the serious depletion
in the flock resultant on the dry
conditions of that period, (although
the average rainfall for the district
is 27 inches), Mr. Sugden decided
to restock with shorthorn and
Hereford cattle, and has since
established a very successful breed-
ing estate. He has acquired a
considerable amount of leasehold in
the district, which has enabled him
to extend his operations; and in
addition to cattle-raising he also
gives a portion of his attention to
horse-breeding, owning the well-
known draught sire, “Premier
Scott,” imported from New Zealand.
Mr. Sugden is a great lover of
horses, and in preference to using
his Hupmobile motor car, drives a
fine pair of greys on all possible
occasions. He interests himself in
the public affairs of the district,
and is a member of the Northern

SIDNEY HARVEY TOWN-
END, ‘Zilzie,” Warra, was born at
Christchurch, New Zealand, on
May 24, 1883, and is the youngest
son of the late Dr. Joseph Henry
DR. JOSEPH HENRY TOWNEND.
Townend, who practised as a physi-
cian for many years in that city,
having been a passenger from Eng-
land on one of the first three ships
to arrive with colonists for the
Dominion. The gentleman under
review received his education at
Christ’s College, Christchurch, and
was destined by his father for the
legal profession, but as a result of
the death of Mr. Townend this idea
was abandoned, and he decided to
enter the pastoral industry. He
obtained his early experience on
“Glenmark,” a pastoral property
owned by his stepmother, and there
began the study of sheep and
cattle-raising under the well-known
with Mr. Johnston, and upon leav-
ing there in 1907 he purchased a
portion of the “Whiterock” Estate,
an old, historic New Zealand pro-
perty, and became engaged in sheep-
farming on his own account. The
“Corriedale” breed, so closely con-
nected with “Whiterock,” having
gained his full approval, he built
up his flock from this type, and met
with considerable success, not only
in the ordinary development of the
enterprise, but also with various
experiments that he made in breed-
ing. After seven years at “White-
rock,” in 1914 he disposed of that
property, and being impressed with
what he had heard of the wider pos-
sibilities of expansion in Queensland
in respect to the pastoral industry
in general, and also of the splendid
results attained by sheepfarmers
who had procured “Corriedale”
types from the leading breeders of
New’ Zealand, and had now thriv-
ing flocks on Queensland pastures,
he determined to settle in this State.
His brother-in-law (Mr. Charles H.
Ensor), and the father of that
gentleman, who were among the
founders of original flocks of “Cor-
riedales” in New Zealand, had been
concerned in the despatch of various
drafts to Queensland, and it had
become the custom, as the excel-
lence of the breed was established
across the sea, to send annual ship-
ments, all of which had prospered
after their transportation to a
more northerly latitude. Mr. Town-
end therefore entered into a part-
nership with Mr. C. H. Ensor in the
establishment of a stud in Queens-
land, to be devoted exclusively to
the propagation of “Corriedales,”
and accordingly “Dunmore Park”
and “Zilzie,” both rich though
comparatively small properties on
way of record, only losing three
sheep on the trip. Upon arrival at
his destination Mr. Townend lost
no time in getting his charges to
their new home, and forthwith he

commenced the working out of his
scheme on lines which have proved
as completely successful as were his
previous efforts on his own account
in the Dominion. Already he has
distributed the pure “Corriedale”
blood far and wide throughout
Queensland, and has proved that
the breed, producing a sheep com-
bining the dual advantages of a
wool and mutton producer, is bound
to find favour with the pastoralists
of this State. That this desired re-
sult has already been attained is
plainly evidenced by the circum-
stance that prominent judges, who
themselves are owners of large flocks,

admitted to be a “Corriedale”
specialist. Touching upon the his-
tory of the breed, we find that the
“Corriedale” was introduced in an
unobtrusive way in the early sixties
by Mr. James Little, now of
Hawarden, North Otago, New
Zealand. The cross first used in its
development was the Lincoln-
Merino, which, however, was not
productive of a sufficiently good
quality of wool to satisfy the
founder, and some few years back
English Leicester rams were substi-
tuted for the Lincoln, with the re-
sult that better fleeces began to
appear, and a coarse breech form-
erly observed was absent. The stock
by the English Leicesters also
showed better fattening quality,
without special feeding, and in this
connection it has been said that the
“Corriedale” inherits all the good
qualities of the merino as a forager
without being liable to the wander-
ing habits of the latter type. He
will make the most of spare and
difficult country, but once satisfied
does not exert himself unduly for
further provision. He is also more
robust than the merino, and can
endure the extremes of heat and
cold without undesirable results.
Thus it has come about that the
place of the merino has been taken
by a breed that has proved itself a
better sheep for the hills, besides

returning a profit of just double the
return obtained from that popular
breed, while in the coastal regions
he is an equally good doer. In
wool production he reflects the
m 2
greatest credit upon his breeders, a
stud flock returning a clip of be-
tween 14 lb. and 15 lb., while stud
rams will yield up to 23 lb. of wool
of high quality, commanding 13d.
for fleece and 12d. for pieces. There
is a good demand for the “White-
rock” “Corriedales” from all parts
of the world, but naturally at this
comparatively early period Australia
is the heaviest purchaser, and the
sheep have been tried in different
parts of Victoria, New South
AVales, estem .Australia, and Tas-
mama, and given uniform satisfac-
tion. On account of the l drought con-
ditions which obtained in Queensland
after Mr, Townend arrived with
his flock, he did not attempt
to exhibit at the local shows, but
tempted by the excellent qualities
of his flock in 1914, he sent a
“Corriedale’ ’ ram and ewe to Syd-
ney, and in keen and open competi-
tion against entries from New South
Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and
New Zealand, won the championship
TWO TYPICAL CORRIEDALES.
in this class for New Zealand-
bred ram and ewe at the Syd-
ney ram fair. In February, 1917,
having surmounted the trials of the
long drought, he decided to enter
some of his sheep at the Warwick
Royal Show, and was successful in
every entry, carrying off four pre-
mier awards on that occasion, when
his exhibits were commented upon
most favourably not only by the
judge but by prominent sheep ex-
perts present, who gave the palm of
exceptional all-round quality to the
“Corriedales” from “Zilzie.” Al-
though Mr. Townend still controls
operations on both properties, he
has acquired sole interest in “Zil-
zie,” which stud farm is conveni-
ently situated 3 miles from the
nearest railway station, Warra, on
the Darling Downs, and applies the
whole of his time and attention to
the building-up of the breed in
Queensland. He takes the keenest
interest in the working out of this
big proposition, both on his own
behalf and that of his New Zealand
partner, Mr. Ensor, and has shown
himself in every respect fitted for the
undertaking, which requires an ex-
pert knowledge, coupled with initia-
tive, and a correct apprehension of
the new conditions under which he
has been called to work. The pres-
tige of “Dunmore Park” and “Zil-
zie” as stud stations is rapidly
growing, and as the “Corriedale”
type of sheep becomes more widely
known there is little doubt that it
will attain a measure of popularity
second to no other breed in Queens-
land.


DONALD FLETCHER, owner of
“Eurella” Estate, in the Roma dis-
trict, was born in the Island of Mull,
Scotland, on March 17, 1851, and is
the second son of the late Peter
MR. P. FLETCHER, SEN.
Fletcher, the descendant of a long
line of ancestors engaged in agrarian
pursuits and in sheepfarming in the
Highlands of Scotland. A genealogi-
cal record of the Fletcher family
traces its line of ancestry back to
MR. P. FLETCHER, JUN.
1497, when Angus, the earliest of
the chiefs of the Clan Fletcher of
the Braes of Glenorchy, flourished.
The line continued in direct descent
from father to son to 1680, when
Archibald (Gillespie Na Cranaich)
was born. He resided at Baravuich,
about one mile to the north of the old
castle of Auchalladair, and acquir-
ing by purchase the estates of “Du-
nans” and “Bernice” bequeathed to
his eldest son, John, and the second,
Archibald, these respective estates,
the latter of which remained in pos-
session of the family for five genera-
tions, whilst “Dunans” is still occu-
pied by the same branch of the con-
nection. Archibald (Gillespie Na
Cranaich) married Ann McNab,
daughter of McNab, of Innishewan,
by whom he had four sons, John,
Archibald, Donald, and Angus.
He died in 1765. Donald, the third
son, who leased the farm of “Camus-
laimh,” in Glenlyon, married Grace
McNaughton, of Maghar, Glenlyon,
and had issue two sons, Archibald
and Angus. Angus, the younger,
removed to Glendarnel in Colwal,
where he married and had sons and
daughters. One of his sons, another
Angus, was a teacher in Dunmoore,
where he became widely known and
respected, and was the author of
several popular Gaelic songs. Archi-
bald, the elder son, who resided at
Auchalladair, married Ann, daugh-
ter of Peter Campbell, of Clash -
gower, and of this union there were
four sons, Donald, Patrick, Angus,
and John. Of these, Donald, the
eldest, settled at Bauan, Glenorchy,
and, marrying Janet McNaughton,
from Glenashart, had six sons, the
second of whom, Peter, was the
father of Mr. Donald Fletcher of
“Eurella,” Queensland. Among the
collateral branches of the Fletcher
family, emigration has been in
favour, most of those who have
sought Australian shores taking up
their residence in New South Wales.
Representatives of the line have also
settled in America and New Zea-
land. John Fletcher, the fourth
son of Archibald Fletcher and Ann
Campbell, who crossed the Atlantic
and made his home at Montreal,
Canada, had a son, John, who, in
1866 held the appointment of
Lieutenant-Colonel in the Canadian
Army. An extract from a Canadian
paper of that year shows the high
regard in which this officer was held
—“At a meeting which followed,
the health of the Governor, our
Commander-in-Chief, having been
disposed of, the health of Lieutenant-
Colonel Fletcher was drunk with
great enthusiasm. The gallant
lieutenant-colonel was then pre-
sented with a very valuable service

tainly the most persevering cham-
pion of Burgh Reform in Scotland.”
His eldest son, Miles Angus Flet-
cher, also an advocate of Edinburgh,

ter of Lady Augustus Clavering,
sister of a former Duke of Argyll,
and among the sons of this marriage

the Black Sea during the Crimean
War, and Angus, a sculptor and
artist. Margaret, a daughter, mar-
ried Dr. Davy, brother of Sir Hum-
phrey Davy, inventor of the safety
lamp for miners. Mr. Peter Flet-
cher, father of the gentleman under
review, came to Australia by the
sailing ship “Miltiades” in 1852,
several of his brothers having pre-
ceded him at different dates. His
first employment was taking charge
of the horses in connection with the
police gold escort at the time of the
early discovery of the yellow metal
in Victoria, and whilst engaged in
this way he gained an intimate ac-
quaintance with the romantic life of
the diggings. Subsequently, in con-
junction with his brother Miles, he
purchased the “Tulloch” Estate, in
Victoria, afterwards acquiring on
his own account a station known
as “Glengleeson,” near McArthur,
in the same State. The late
Peter Fletcher married Margaret,
daughter of Alexander Garrow, In-
spector of Roads and Bridges, Ar-
gyllshire, by whom he had two sons
(Robert, who died unmarried, and
Donald) and four daughters. Mr.
Donald Fletcher as an infant came
with his parents from Laggan, Ulva,
in the Isle of Mull, where the family
had been settled for a number of
years, arriving in Victoria in 1852.
At the close of his education, he re-
ceived his early training in the pas-
toral industry under the guidance of
his uncle, Mr. Miles Fletcher, and
later in partnership with his brother
Miles worked the “Glengleeson” Es-
fate for some little time. After the
severance of this connection in 1877,
Mr. Donald Fletcher came to
Queensland, and purchased “Dal-
mally,” a holding of 24,000 acres,
situated about twenty miles from
Roma, subsequently acquiring “Cro-
chentigh,” near Muckadilla, and
“Eurella,” his present homestead
property, to the administration of
which he has devoted his personal
attention for the past decade. The
“Eurella” Estate is situated on the
South-Western railway line, and lies
about twenty-three miles from Mit-
chell and forty miles from Roma.
Originally taken up by a Mr. Hunter
in the early days of the settlement
of Queensland, it has since passed
through the hands of various own-
ers, being at one time in possession
of Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, from
whom it was purchased by Messrs,
Menzies, Dunsmore, & Co., who sold
it to Mr. Fletcher in 1907. In area
it comprises about 80,000 acres of
country, characterized by myall
ridges and rolling downs, timbered
with brigalow and other species of
scrub growths. With the exception
of some 7,000 or 8,000 acres round
the hills, very little clearing has
been found necessary, the ringbark-
ing accomplished upon this area
representing practically the whole of
the work of this nature required on
the run. The region carries a heavy
soil, which varies from black to red
according to the locality, and among
the large number of prolific natural
grasses, blue grass, and Mitchell
grass are especially noticeable. No
permanent water supply originally
was to be depended upon, but ex-
cellent arrangements have been
made to secure an abundant provi-
sion in this respect by the sinking
of six artesian bores which vary in
depth from nearly four thousand to
about twelve thousand feet. Two of
these bores produce a copious flow,
and from the others continual sup-
plies are obtained by means of
pumping, numerous tanks with the
necessary troughing having been
placed in suitable sites. The estate is
well fenced, the boundary being pro-
tected with rabbit-proof wire-netting
and many miles of sub-division
fences, giving ample paddock
accommodation. “Eurella” is de-
voted to the raising of Merino sheep

The Honourable JAMES LALOR,
M.L.C., owner of “Gubberamunda”
Station, near Roma, was born at
HON. JAMES LALOR.
Ballybrittas, Queen’s County, Ire-
land on July 7, 1829, and is the
eldest son of the late William Lalor,
a native of Rathdowney, in the same
county. The late William Lalor ar-
rived in Sydney, New South Wales,
in the year 1840, accompanied by
his wife and family of four sons and
two daughters, the gentleman under
review being at the time about
eleven years of age. Shortly after
landing in Australia Mr. William
Lalor, who had been engaged in
farming pursuits in Ireland, ac-
cepted a position as station hand on
“Walhalla” Station, on the Liver-
pool Plains, the property of Messrs.
Jones and Uhr, and here began his
association with the pastoral in-
dustry. At that time Messrs. Jones
and IJhr were among the most
prominent of the pioneer squatters,
and the late Mr. Lalor gained much
useful experience during the twelve
months that he spent on this prop-
erty. With a view to improving his
prospects, he next secured employ-
ment at “Carroll,’' on the Namoi
River, where he remained for about
seven years, principally handling
sheep, but allowing no opportunity
to pass of augmenting his knowledge
of general station work. Casting

hundred sheep, a fair-sized herd of
cattle, and a few horses, and set out
with his family for their new home,
As was only to be expected, many
privations and much hardship were
the lot of the party who, on arrival
at the Severn River, made their first
long halt at the homestead of the
late Mr. Dines, where the stock was
depastured for about a year. In 1852
the late William Lalor purchased
from Captain Scott the leasehold of
“Bengalla,” then an unoccupied and
undeveloped area. Straightway, de-
velopmental work was put in train
by the late Mr. Lalor and his sons,
attention first being given to the
erection of living accommodation,
and when this was finished, stock-
yards were built, and other neces-
sary improvements effected, until, in
time, the station assumed the ap-
pearance of a thoroughly well-
developed property. The late Wil-
liam Lalor died at “Bengalla” in
the year 1893, his wife, whose maiden
name was Connor, having prede-
ceased him in the early fifties. The
subject of this notice, the Honour-
able James Lalor, M.L.C., received
his education primarily in Ireland.
After arrival in Australia, however,
he embraced every opportunity to
supplement his store of knowledge
by private study and reading, thus
making himself a well-informed man,
despite the lack of schools and
facilities for obtaining instruction,
which was one of the most serious
drawbacks suffered by the early set-
tiers’ children. Mr. Lalor continued

all the sheep, numbering about
5,000, from the “Bengalla” pas-

Roma district. In this way he
formed the station, which since has
become so well known as “Gubber-

chased from the firm of Messrs.
Henry Mort & Co., of Sydney,
being a block which had been taken
up for speculative purposes by New
South Wales investors before the law
was enacted by which owners were
compelled to stock their lands. Mr.
Lalor brought with him to “Gub-
beramunda” six white station hands,
a small number of natives, and two
teams of bullocks. Requiring ad-
ditional country for enlarged opera-
tions, in the late seventies he
purchased the forfeited pastoral
leasehold known as “Myall

erties made drastic remedies neces-
sary, and Mr. Lalor perceived
that the only satisfactory solution of
the problem was to substitute cattle
for sheep on the area affected.
Accordingly, as opportunity offered,
this new policy was put into force,
and for some years past both “Gub-
beramunda” and “Myall Downs”
have been worked solely as cattle
stations, Shorthorns being the breed
favoured. The country on the two
runs is varied in character, plain
and wooded stretches alternating,
and rising ground breaking the
monotony of level land. Patches of
brigalow predominate in the timber
region, where, however, a variety of
other species of trees are found. The
black soil for which the district is
famous in many places gives way to
a good red loam, and both kinds
prove favourable to the growth of
feed for stock, the greater part of
the properties being well covered
with excellent natural grasses and
herbage, among which, perhaps, the
valuable blue-grass flourishes most
abundantly. Several good-sized,
permanent creeks flow through
“Gubberamunda” and “Myall
Downs,” the Bungil and Eurumbah
Creeks alone making splendid pro-
vision in the matter of water supply.
So well watered, indeed, are these
runs that, even in the worst times
of drought ever known in the dis-
trict, they have never suffered from
lack of permanent water. The well-
known “Mount Hutton” run adjoins
Mr. Lalor’s properties on their
northern side. The rich pastoral
qualities of this block of country are
generally acknowledged, and much
credit is due to Mr. Lalor’s good
judgment in selecting the locality
where he first settled as the scene
of his enterprise in stock-raising.
The Honourable James' Lalor has
played a prominent part in the pub-
lic life of the district, obtaining his
earliest experiences in local govern-
ment as a member of the Bungil
Shire Council, with which he was
associated for upwards of 30 years,
and for many years was a member
of the Leichhardt Rabbit Board. He
was a foundation member of the
Western Pastoral and Agricultural
Association, taking a leading part in
its deliberations as a committeeman,
and for many years was president of
this organisation. For a lengthy
period he was president of the local
hospital board, and his earnest co-
operation has always' been accorded
to movements claiming as their ob-
ject the welfare of the community in
general. He was twice returned by
the Maranoa constituency as a mem-
ber of the House of Assembly of
Queensland, and sat for nine years
in this Chamber, subsequently be-
ing appointed a member of the
Legislative Council by the Mc-
Ilwraith Administration in 1888,
which position he still holds.
Mr. Lalor married in the year 1869
Helen, daughter of the late Chris-
topher Gorry, of Ipswich, one of the
pioneers of that district. Mrs. Lalor
died in 1903, leaving a family of
three sons and two daughters. De-
spite the fact that he has attained to
the advanced age of eighty-eight
years, Mr. Lalor, who resides in
Roma, continues to enjoy perfect
health and full possession of his
faculties, both mental and physical.
The eldest son, Mr. William Francis
Lalor, is a solicitor by profession,
being a partner in the firm of
Messrs. Thyne & Macartney, of
Brisbane. He married Isabel,
daughter of Mr. H. J. Gray, a
member of one of the pioneer

families of Ipswich, and well-known
as manager of the Ipswich branch of
the Queensland National Bank. Mr.
Gerald Francis Lalor, the second
son, manages the station properties
owned by his father. He married
Brenda, daughter of the late Cap-
tain O’Mahony, an early settler of
the Logan district, and a retired
officer of the Imperial Military
Forces. The youngest son, Mr.
James Gorry Lalor, who was for a
long period on service at the front
with the Australian Imperial Forces,
before enlisting was associated with
his elder brother, Mr. G. F. Lalor,
in the station management. The
elder daughter is the wife of Dr.
W. E. Harris, of Armidale, New
South Wales.


THOMAS WHEELER GILL-
HAM, of Roma, now “Tongwarry,”
Mungallala, is the eldest son of
the late Thomas Wheeler Gillham,
a native of Rutlandshire, England,
MR. T. W. GILLHAM.
whose father, the Rev. Thomas
Gillham, M.A., Trinity College,
Cambridge, was vicar of Lidding-
ton cum Caldicott for forty years.
Born in the year 1840, the late
gentleman at an early age obtained
a commission in Her Majesty
Queen Victoria’s Indian Army,
and served with the 34th Foot,
better known as the Cumberland
Regiment. He came to Australia
from India in 1862, and after two
or three years of bush experience in
partnership with the late William
Newton he purchased “Rookwood”
Station, in the Leichhardt district,
at time entirely devoted to sheep-
raising. Some years later, on the
death of his partner, he purchased
his share, and, abandoning the wool
and mutton industry, introduced
cattle and horses on to the run.
After thirty odd years of bush
life he placed “Rookwood” under
the control of his eldest son
and bought a freehold property
in the vicinity of Glen Innes, New
South Wales. Here he resided with
the younger members of his family
for nine years, at the expiration of
which time he settled in Toowoomba.
Mr. T. W. Gillham, senior, had the
misfortune to meet with a railway
accident, which resulted in his death
on December 30, 1911. The late
gentleman was an expert bushcrafts-
man, and possessed in a marked de-
gree the resourcefulness so useful in
pioneering work, being able to turn
his hand to almost anything. The
resolute courage so essential to the
pioneer was also eminently his, and
through it he exercised an authority
over the Isaacs River natives which
was very curious and interesting. In
those days the blacks were particu-
larly numerous in the Isaacs coun-
try, and, as soon as possible, Mr.
Gillham adopted the bold policy of
taking them into his employ, by this
action showing that he reposed every
confidence in their loyalty. It
was freely predicted by surrounding
REV. T. W. GILLHAM.
settlers that, sooner or later, he
would fall a victim to his mistaken
kindness, but, disregarding all warn-
ings, he persevered in his determina-
tion, and on no occasion had he
cause to regret his kindly overtures
to the original inhabitants of the
country. He married in 1872
Harriett, daughter of the late
George Hibbins, of Lincolnshire,
a member of an old English family,
and, at his death, was survived by
his widow and a family of seven sons
and four daughters. Mrs. Gillham
still resides in Toowoomba. Of the
sons, three (Francis Edmund, Robert
Fildon, and Benjamin Creswell)
responded to the call for men to serve
their country during the Great War,
while two others are engaged in the
pastoral industry, working in part-
nership the “Suttor Creek” Station,
in the Mackay district. Mr. Thomas
Wheeler Gillham, the subject of
this notice, received his education at
the Auckland Grammar School,
New Zealand, and upon the comple-
tion of his studies, became associated
with his father in the conduct of
operations on “Rookwood” Station.
In 1897 he took over the reins of
management, and continued to con-
trol affairs on the station for the
following seven years, at the ter-
mination of which period the prop-
erty passed into the hands of its new
owners. In 1906 “Marra Marra”
Station, in the Yuelba district, on
the Western line, was purchased, and
Mr. Gillham assumed charge of af-
fairs in the family interest, his con-
nection with this property extending
over a decade. “Marra Marra”
was sold to Mr. Patrick Min-
nage in 1917. Mr. Gillham has
always displayed a keen interest
in the advancement of the dis-
tricts in which he has made his
home from time to time, and whilst
residing at “Marra Marra” for some
years filled the office of councillor of
Bendemere Shire, being returned at
the head of the poll by the ratepayers
MR. THOMAS W. GILLHAM.
at the inception of the council.
He married in 1913 Ethel May,
daughter of Mr. D. Ross, one of the
early pioneers of the Roma district,
and has one daughter.


WILLIAM HENRY RAWLE,
J.P., “Moorabinda,” Cunnamulla,
is a son of the late George Augustus
Rawle, manager of a sugar planta-
tion at Savannah, Lamar, Island of
Jamaica, who originally hailed from
Bristol, England. Mr. William
Henry Rawle was born at Savannah
on July 21, 1848. Records of the
family have been in existence for
many generations, and in Bristol the
name is still well known and highly
esteemed. The late Mr. Rawle, who
started life in Jamaica as a very
young man, died there in the year
1853, when his son, the subject of
this memoir, was still a child; and,
as a consequence of this bereave-
ment, he was sent by his relatives to
Bristol, where he was brought up
and educated at Dr. Benham’s
Academy. While yet in his teem
the spirit of adventure was strong
in the boy; and this characteristic
was evidently coupled with a some-
what headstrong disposition, for,
when but a little over 14 years of age,
he ran away from school to seek life
and adventure in a new land. He
arrived in Australia in the first
emigrant ship that came direct
from England to the port of Bowen,
at which place he was successful in
securing work as an assistant in the
butchering trade. Being attracted
by the hidden possibilities of the
bush, he did not long remain in this
position, but obtained employment
at “Hinchinbrook” Station, situated
in a more northerly part of Queens-
land, which had recently been taken
up by the original Collins family,
who were then proceeding with its
encounters with the blacks, who
resented the presence of the original
white pioneers who had taken up
areas which they had been accus-
tomed to regard as their own for so

many generations. On one occasion
it was necessary to call for assistance
in dealing with this peril, and the
late Lieutenant Wheeler, of the
early Queensland Police Force,
arrived on the scene with his troopers
to curb the tempers of the truculent
and dangerous blacks. During Mr.
Rawle’s sojourn in Bowen and
district the great cyclone of 1866
occurred, when the schooner “Eva,”
drifted to New South Wales, and for
several years was employed in many
varieties of station work. Later he
took up a selection close to Moree,
but owing to the needs of a growing
family he decided that this holding
did not allow of sufficient scope for
the carrying out of his projects. He,
therefore, sold it and returned to
Queensland, believing that this State,
with its great areas of unopened
land, held larger possibilities. The
Warrego District, already known to
him through former ramblings and
which he had visited some 21 years
previously, was chosen for his new
venture; and in 1896 he purchased
from Mr. Edward Phillott (now of
the Winton District of Queensland)
a valuable little property of 12,000
acres which he devoted to the raising
of sheep, of which the place is cap-
able of carrying between 3,000 and
4,000. This property he considerably
developed, among the improvements
being an artesian bore. The home-
stead was removed to a more con-
venient position. In the meantime
he purchased, and subsequently re-
sold, other blocks of land in the
district. Since his advent in the
Warrego he has been associated with
the various local institutions; he was
for many years a councillor of the
Shire of Paroo, and for three years
was chairman of that body. All
movements of a patriotic and
charitable nature and generally for
the betterment of the district have
his cordial support. He was created
a J ustice of the Peace by the
Denham Administration in 1913.
He married in 1889, Ellen Mary,

PATRICK MINNAGE, “Walla-
bella” Station, Yeulba, was born
near H arrisville, Queensland, on
October 2, 1869, and is the youngest
son of the late Edward Minnage,
MR. P. MINNAGE.
who came from County Clare, Ire-
land, to Victoria, when settlement
in that colony was still in its earliest
stage. Mr. Minnage is descended
from very ancient Irish stock, and
records show that the family name
is one of the oldest in Connaught
and Munster, where many of those
who bore it took a prominent part in
the stirring doings of the eighteenth
century, before the population of
Ireland suffered so great a reduction
through emigration and other
causes. Many members of the Min-
nage family proceeded to America,
"WALLABEULA” HOMESTEAD.
where the name has become a
familiar sound, but so far as is
known the late Edward Minnage
was the sole representative of his
connection to cross the southern seas
for the purpose of founding a home
for himself and future generations
of his name in Australia. When he
first started his career in the land
of his adoption, the late pioneer had
no fixed plans of procedure, but soon
after his arrival, in the sixties,
availed himself of an opportunity to
start in the carrying business, in
which he continued for a few years.
Before Queensland as a separate
colony had seen ten years of exist-
ence, however, he decided to throw
in his lot with the early settlers in
that portion of the Island-Continent,
and accompanied by his family he
made his advent to the Harrisville
district, subsequently removing to
the head of the Logan River, where
he became engaged in mixed farm-
ing and grazing pursuits. During
the few years that Mr. Edward Min-
nage remained in Queensland, he
established himself successfully in
the industry, and was a well-known
figure among the graziers and
other residents of the neighbour-
hood. Ultimately he returned to
Victoria, where his death occurred.
The subject of this notice, Mr.
Patrick Minnage, received his edu-
cation at Killarney, and after leav-
ing school continued to add to his
store of learning by self-instruction,
as far as his circumstances allowed.
At the age of fourteen, he was con-
sidered sufficiently developed to start
out in life for himself, and accord-
ingly, in 1883, he bade farewell to
the home of his boyhood, and made
his first plunge into independence.
Obtaining a position in the Logan
district as stock hand, at a wage of
ten shillings a week, he applied him-
self with courage and energy to the
discharge of his duties, and growing
hardy and strong through the
healthy, outdoor life, eventually be-
gan to look about him for a more
lucrative means of livelihood. The
boom in the cedar industry gave him
the chance he was awaiting, and for
a time he did a man’s work amongst
the big timber. Whilst occupied with
this work, and before he had com-
pleted his eighteenth year, he se-
lected a block of grazing land in the
MR. J. L. MINNAGE.
Logan district, which he proceeded
to develop as opportunity permitted.
With the capital he was able to save
by cedar-cutting and other classes
of bush work of a profitable nature,
he purchased pure-bred Shorthorn
cattle from the well-known stud of
Mr. T. de M. Murray-Prior, and
started a herd on his own account,
pasturing them on his block of land
on the Logan. Finally, as the cattle
increased and the proposition at-
tained sufficient importance to war-
rant the step, he relinquished his
other pursuits and devoted his time
and attention entirely to the de-
velopment of his own interests. Mr.
Minnage continued to reside on this
property until 1903, when he sold
out to his sister, and after a brief
period on the land farther west, he
purchased in 1905 his present home-
stead block, “Wallabella,” in the
neighbourhood of Yeulba. The
new owner found plenty of scope for
his industry and ability in building
up a successful enterprise and form-
ing a new home for himself and his
family on this area. His lengthy
experience and expert knowledge of
stock made the task a comparatively
easy one, and the “Wallabella”
property soon began to be generally
regarded as a going concern. The
breeding of pure Hereford cattle
again engaged Mr. Minnage’s atten-
tion, and by careful selection of herd


bulls procured from the “Tocal”
stud, New South Wales—a station
famed for this particular breed—
and mating them with the Hereford
cows with which the holding already

was stocked, he rapidly secured ex-
cellent results, and the “Walla-
bella” cattle now hold their own
with the best in the district. In
addition to the herd—which takes
pride of place in the operations car-
ried on—the station carries a email
flock of sheep, chiefly for home con-
sumption, and Mr. Minnage, be-
sides, has made a close study and a
hobby of breeding horses of the
Arab strain. For some years he
owned the famous “Bender,” one of
the best Arab horses ever imported
to Australia, which he purchased
from Mr. Harold J. Foote, of Ips-
wich, who procured him direct from
the estate of Lady Anne Blunt, in
England, this lady being well known
as the breeder of the most famous
stud of Arab horses in the world.
“Bender”, came of the noted “Seg-
lawi Jerdran” of “Ibn ed Derri’s”
strain, his dam being “Bereyda
Grey,” g.dam “Bozra,” g.g.dam
“Basilisk,” bred by Abd el Jadir of
Deya on the Euphrates. He was
in Mr. Minnage’s possession at the
time of his death. The “Walla-
bella” property is one of the
oldest of Queensland pastoral hold-
ings, having been owned in turn by
many of the best-known personal-
ities in stock and station circles.
Originally taken up by Messrs. Kent
and Wienholt, it passed successively
through the hands of various owners,
among whom were Mr. Vaughan,
Messrs. Bracker & White, Mr. Cox
—who was the descendant of a
family well known in the Logan dis-
trict in the early days—and Mr.
J. T. M. Bell, of “Coochin-Coo-
chin,” being eventually purchased
by Mr. Minnage, from Mr. Turner,
now of the Darling Downs. In area

wood, coolibah, box, and pine, and

suffered less in proportion than

his adoption of the policy of keeping
the stock on the more heavily tim-
bered and consequently better shel-
tered portions of the run and feed-
ing them on prickly pear. In
addition to “Wallabella,” Mr. Min-
nage also owns “Marra-Marra,” a
property situated on the Tchanning
River, which he worked in conjunc-
tion with the home estate as a run
for Hereford cattle. Among the
stirring experiences of his career
have been included some of the ter-
rors incidental to the devastating
floods which from time to time
have swept over large areas of
Queensland country. He recalls as a
youth having been instrumental in
assisting his mother and sister in a
perilous situation of this kind, and
since his marriage on one occasion
he was compelled to leave his home
at dead of night, when the flood
waters threatened the original home-
stead on “Wallabella.” Mr. Min-
nage married in April, 1900, Agnes,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Kilroy, one
of the oldest pioneers of the Fassi-
fern district, where, now in the
autumn of his days, he lives in well-
earned retirement. Mrs. Minnage
has proved herself to be possessed of
all the qualities displayed by the
most heroic of the wives of the earlier
settlers, to whom their husbands

son, James Lawrence, is rapidly
taking his place as his father’s right
hand in the work of the station.

native of New South Wales, having
been born at Hay, in that State, on
December 13, 1862. He is the eldest
MR. JAMES MOORE.
son of the late James Moore, a name
well known in pastoral circles as the
manager of some of the largest prop-
erties in New South Wales. Hail-
ing from Belfast, Ireland, where
generations of his line had followed
agrarian pursuits, the late gentle-
man upon his arrival in Australia
became connected with the pastoral
industry through the agency of
Messrs. Sumner & Benn, early Vic-
torian pastoralists, by whom he was
offered the appointment of manager
of “Bugilbone” Station, on the
Namoi River, in the mother State.
This position, which he entered
upon in 1871, he held for fifteen
years, at the close of which period
he went into retirement. He died
in Sydney in 1913, a family of two
sons and two daughters surviving
him. Mr. John Charles Moore
received his education at the Tam-
worth Grammar School and under
private tuition at home, and upon
leaving his schooldays behind him,
decided in favour of pastoral pur-
suits as his calling in life. His first
position was that of overseer at
“Bugilbone,” where, under the
direction of his father, he obtained
an excellent training in the work of
a station, especially in the handling
of stock, and this post he retained
until 1886, when he succeeded the
late James Moore as manager of the
property. He continued to control
affairs on behalf of the original
owners until 1895, when the pro-
perty was purchased by the Queens-
land Pastoral Company, to which
firm he transferred his services,
remaining at “Bugilbone” for
another couple of years. In 1897
he was sent by his company to under-
take the more responsible duties of
manager of “Amby Downs” and
"Euthulla” Stations, in the Maranoa
district, Queensland, which he made
his headquarters, whilst still con-
tinuing to administer the New South
Wales run. In 1899 the Queensland
Pastoral Company was reconstructed
under the title of the “Queensland
Estates Limited,” acquiring “Fort
Constantine,” in the Cloncurry dis-
trict, and “Warrnambool Downs,”

near Winton, when Mr. Moore
accepted the appointment of general
manager of the company and all its
properties. In this capacity he made
some important purchases of station
areas, including “Authoringa,”
“Riversleigh,” and “Mangalore”
runs, near Charleville, and continued
to supervise operations until 1910,
when the Australian Pastoral Com-
pany took over the whole of the
assets of the Queensland Estates
Limited, and Mr. Moore’s connec-
tion with the firm terminated. Prior
to this date he had acquired certain
private pastoral interests in New
South Wales, in conjunction with
his younger brother, Mr. Frank
L’Estrange Moore, who is managing
the “Walma” and “Moorefield”
Estates, near Walgett, for the firm ;
and Mr. J. C. Moore now deter-
mined to launch out on his own
account in Queensland. Accordingly
he purchased his present property,
“The Peaks,” from Mr. H. H. Bar-
ton, of Roma, where he has since
resided with his family, giving his
whole attention to the furtherance
of his pastoral proposition, and
enlarging his territory from time to
time as opportunity occurred,
“Mecura Lease” and other grazing
blocks in the Maranoa district hav-
ing been added to his original hold-
ing. Mr. Moore runs both sheep
and cattle on all his Queensland
estates, and the skilled manage-
ment brought to bear upon the devel-
opment of “The Peaks” and its
auxiliary holdings has resulted in
the best returns being secured, the
wide experience of the owner en-
abling him to turn to the very best
account the various advantages pos-
sessed by the different runs. Whilst
the New South Wales stations,
under the management of his
brother (which are mostly freehold),
are devoted chiefly to sheep, an im-
portant feature of Mr. Frank
Moore’s operations is a fine Short-
horn stud herd, and these “Walma”
bulls are not only used by Mr. Moore
on his Queensland runs, but also find

a ready market in this State. Since
his advent to “Amby Downs,” Mr.
Moore has taken an active interest
in the affairs of the district, and his
services have proved so valuable to


the community that he has seldom
been allowed to suspend his activities
in the sphere of public office. He
became a member of the Boringa
Shire Council in 1898, and has

retained this seat ever since,
the ratepayers consistently dis-
playing their confidence in him
by returning him at the head of
the poll on every occasion, whilst
from his fellow-councillors he has
received the honour of repeated
election to the chair, which office he
occupies at the time of writing
(1917). He was created a Justice of
the Peace by the Philp Government
nearly two decades ago. He has been
a member of the Leichhardt Rabbit
Board for many years, and has done
much useful work as a committee-
man of the Maranoa Pastoral, Agri-
cultural, and Industrial Association,
frequently presiding over the deliber-
ations of these bodies. Mr. Moore is
a director of the well-known commer-
cial house of Sturmfels & Co., wool
and stock brokers, of Brisbane, and
has been chairman of directors of
this company. He married in 1891
Honor Colleen Copp, daughter of
the late Woodley Cole Slyman, one
of the pioneer pastoralists of the
Namoi district, New South Wales,
who was connected by marriage with
the Copp family, who occupied a
prominent place in pastoral circles
in the early days of that State. Four
sons and one daughter are the result
of this union. Of the sons the
eldest, Woodley Keith, assists his
father in the management of the
station. Following the outbreak of
war in Europe, he was desirous of
offering his services to his King and
country, but had to suffer the dis-
appointment of remaining at home
in favour of his brothers, John Benn
and Arthur Charles, both of whom
proceeded to the front with the
Bth Reinforcements, 9th Field
Artillery Brigade, Australian Im-
jDerial Forces, in 1916, and have since
been on active service in France.

special department control of all the
improvement work initiated on the
property. At a later date "Alice
Downs” Station was acquired by the
firm, and upon the departure of
Mr. William Penhallurick for the
Warrego district to enter upon the
developmental work connected with
this new enterprise the gentleman
under review took over full control
at “Tooloombilla,” Mr. John Pen-
hallurick returning to Victoria to
renew his superintendence of the
properties owned by the partnership
there. In 1900 the firm which had
existed to such good purpose for so
long a period was dissolved by
mutual consent, and in the division
of properties "Tooloombilla” fell to
Mr. Daniel Penhallurick’s share. It
was natural that this disposal of the
proposition which he had nurtured
with so much earnestness and
interest for 15 years should be
entirely to his mind, and with con-
siderable satisfaction he settled down
to continue the working out of the
various schemes of improvement
then in progress, of which he could
justly claim to be the originator.
In the period that has elapsed since
he assumed the rights of sole
proprietor steady advance has been
the rule, and the station now easily
holds its own as one of the most
up-to-date of the pioneer pastoral
properties in the western district.
With the auxiliary holdings of
"Havelock,” “Eastlands,” and "Mun-
naweena,” which gradually were
acquired by the firm, and which
have since been grouped under the
general title of “Tooloombilla,” the
station comprises an area of some
300 square miles, which has been
divided into paddocks varying in
size from 50,000 acres to 100 acres.
The system of fencing adopted has
been that of timber posts, chiefly
ironbark, threaded with two plain
wires and one barbed. The country

is alternately hilly and flat, and the
only considerable watercourse on the
property is the Appletree Creek,
which rises from the end of the main
range situated on the north-eastern
end of the run. To augment this
supply large sums of money have
been spent in water conservation,
and ample provision in this respect
has now been ensured by a policy of
extensive well sinking, dam construc-
tion, and the putting down of a
bore, by means of which good water
has been struck at a depth of 600
feet. The homestead, which is
situated on Appletree Creek, at a
distance of 58 miles from Mitchell,
the nearest railway station on the
western line, from which it is
reached by a fairly good road, was


built by the founder of the station,
the late Dr. Fullerton, in the early
seventies, since which period various
improvements have been made with-

eye of the expert soon passes on to
the horse pastures, to linger with
keen appreciation on the excellent

are the pride of the “Tooloombilla”

hallurick finds abundant scope for
all his time and energies in the con-
duct of the station, in which he is
assisted by his four elder sons, who
are following in the footsteps of
their father and grandfather in the
farming and pastoral industry. His
marriage in Victoria on May 24,
1884, to Emily, daughter of the late
Thomas Dunstan, another native of
Cornwall who for many years was a
well-known identity among the
sturdy followers of the mining indus-
try at Ballarat, provided him with a
helpmeet in the truest sense of the
word, and to the brave spirit in
which as wife and mother she met
the early hardships and disappoint-
ments inseparable from enterprises
of the kind undertaken by her hus-
band, Mr. Penhallurick owes much.
She gave birth to three daughters
and seven sons, of whom five sons
and two daughters survive. One of
the sons, the late Martin Pen-
hallurick, made the supreme sacrifice
during the Great War of 1914-18,
giving his life for the highest
ideals of the race. A strong
proof of the family affection which
is so noticeable between the members
of the clan has been the clinging
together of children and parents,
and brother with brother, exempli-
fied by the long-continued partner-
ship that existed, and by the fact
that in each instance Mr. Penhal-
lurick’s father and mother followed
their sons to the new homes carved
out by the latter, and spent the
closing years of their lives under the


shelter afforded by the filial spirit
of those who owed them a worthy
name and those qualities of honesty,
grit, and perseverance which have
ensured success to their undertakings
and commanded for them the respect
and esteem of their fellows in the
march of life; and it is only fitting

that the soil of “Tooloombilla” should
have provided the last resting-place
for the fine old couple. Mr. Daniel
Penhallurick, now in his sixty-sixth
year, can look back upon a use-
ful life, spent in developing the
resources of a young country and in
building up a home and family of
which he has every reason to be
proud. He is a lover of peace and
concord, and by placing the good-
will of his neighbours beyond all
other considerations he has won the
affection of those with whom he has
been brought into contact during the
many ups and downs of a sufficiently
eventful career.

member of the firm of Loughnan
Bros., was born in the City of Cork,
Ireland, on November 19, 1859, being
MR. HARRY CONNELL LOUGHNAN.
the second son of the late Josenh
Shee Loughnan, an officer of the
National Bank of Ireland, and
descendant of a long line of pro-
genitors whose name was associated
with banking in the Emerald Isle at
the time of the earliest establish-
ment of such institutions there. Mr.
Joseph Shee Loughnan died in
1866, and about three years later his
widow, accompanied by her mother
and three sons, left their native
land, and voyaging by the sailing
ship “Crusader” early in the follow-
ing year arrived at Williamstown,
Victoria, after an eventful trip, ex-
tending over a period of five months.
After landing the party visited
“Murray Downs” Station, where a
relative who had preceded them to
Australia was employed in pastoral
work, and subsequently they pro-
ceeded to Swan Hill, taking up their
residence at this centre. Here Airs.
Loughnan, who was possessed of the
necessary qualifications for imparting
instruction in book learning to the
rising generation, was approached by
the residents, who petitioned her to
undertake the post of schoolmistress
at that centre. To this request she
acceded, and whilst so engaged, in
conjunction with her eldest son, took
up various selections, the Loughnans
being amongst the earliest selectors
of land in this district. The son,
however, died in 1881, at the early
age of 23 years, and, following his
demise, the selections were aban-
doned. With his departure from
Ireland the gentleman under review,
Mr. Harry Connell Loughnan, left
his schooldays behind him, and upon
seeking employment in the land of
his adoption obtained the job of

per week. This work, however, was
only temporary, and later he took a
permanent position at “Mellool”
during which his wages were raised
to 12s. 6d. per week, he received an
offer of a more lucrative position at
“Murray Downs,” where he com-
pleted his first decade in the pastoral
industry, leaving in 1879 to proceed
to “Boorooma,” a cattle station in
New South Wales, where he became
in turn stockman, drover, and over-
seer. He had considerable droving
experience during this period, being
employed in overlanding stock from
“Herbert Downs,” on the Georgina
River, to the Melbourne markets, on
behalf of the owners of “Boorooma,”
Messrs. G. A. & P. Mein Bros., one
of the old historic firms in the pas-
toral industry of Victoria. Mr. J. R.
Loughnan, the other partner in the
existing firm of Loughnan Bros.,
was also employed on “Boorooma”
in the capacity of overseer, under
the then manager, Mr. Simpson, and
ultimately, about December, 1888,
the two brothers decided to make a
venture on their own account.
Resigning their respective positions,

they took up country on “Bangett”
Station, and subsequently, when a
portion of “Boorooma” was thrown
open for the selection of homestead
leases, the opportunity was readily
embraced for the acquisiti n of
further grazing blocks. In this
enterprise they were encouraged by
their former employers, who gave good
proof of the confidence they reposed
in the Loughnan Bros, by thus indi-
cating their desire to have them as
near neighbours. After successfully

working these properties as sheep
and cattle stations for a number of
years, the Messrs. Loughnan directed
their gaze towards Queensland, and
having disposed of their New South
Wales interests, on May 20, 1905,
they came to the Northern State,
shortly afterwards starting operations
on “Woolerbilla,” on the Culgoa
River, a property partly composed of
resumed areas of “Cubbie,” “Alugru-
gulla,” “Currawillinghi,” and “Wool-
erina” Stations. This they developed
principally as a sheep proposition
although at the time of writing

“Abbieglassie” was continued on
the old lines by the new owners,
who favour the Shorthorn breed, the
high standard for which the herd is
noted being maintained by the
introduction from time to time of
stud bulls secured from among the
leading studs of the Commonwealth.
Horses also receive a large share of
attention, and some excellent animals
are bred, the blood horse “Danny”
being used as sire. This beautiful
dark-bay stallion, recognized as one
of the best-bred horses in Australia,
was foaled in England in 1904, his
sire, “Prince Charlie II.," being
descended from first-class English
stock, the noted “Musket” blood run-
ning in his veins. His dam,
“Malaria,” is also of aristocratic
lineage, such well-known performers
as “Trafalgar,” “Dreadnought,”
“Windsor,” “Satchell,” and the
great champion “La Fleche,” being
of her family, in addition to others
of like merit. Such horses as “Gems-
bok,” by “Schimmel,” out of
“Angora,” and “Hobartville,” by
“Segenhoe,” out of “Jessamine,”
were at one time owned by Messrs.
Loughnan Bros., and the progeny of
these sires all proved to be of great
quality. Others worthy of mention
are “Martine,” by “Jacinth” (brother
to “Nordenfeldt,” by “Wildflower”),
and “Coronation,” by “Anthony,”
from “Devotion,” both of which
have sired some excellent performers.
Clydesdales are also bred with con-
siderable success. The firm added
to its possessions by the pur-
chasing in 1910 of “Rutland,” a
freehold of 1,660 acres, situated
about a mile from Mitchell, upon
which Mr. IT. C. Loughnan resides
with his and “Crystal
Brook,” also in the vicinity of the
last-mentioned town, of which they
became the owners in 1913. In all
they administer from eleven to
twelve hundred square miles of
country, one brother, Mr. Joseph
Rainsford Loughnan, managing
“Woolerbilla,” where he spends a
large portion of his time, though
his home is at Coogee, near Sydney,

by the gentleman under review.
Both Messrs. H. C. and J. R.
Loughnan hold His Majesty’s Com-
mission of the Peace. They are good
sportsmen, and as amateurs take a
keen interest in turf events, their
horses having won many races at
picnic meetings. Mr. LTarry Connell
Loughnan was married in 1891 to
Gertrude, daughter of Mr. Walter
Whiting, a resident of Sydney, who
came originally from Tasmania,
where his father, an Englishman, had
settled in the early days. Of the
union there are six sons and three
daughters. Of the sons, the elder

JOHN OLIVER KINCHING-
TON, “Revilo,” Mitchell, was born
at Albury, New South Wales, on
March 10, 1861, and is the second
son of the late George Kinchington,
MR. GEORGE KINCHINGTON.
who came to Australia with his
parents about the year 1834, the
voyage being made in the barque
“James.” The father of this gentle-
man (also named George), hailed
from Salisbury, England, where for
many generations the family had
been engaged in agrarian pursuits,
and on the vessel by which he sailed
there were three other families from
the same district, representing the
stalwart yeoman class of Britain,
from which Australia has derived so
many of her most worthy colonists.
These were the Streets, the Barbers,
and the Osbornes, and upon arrival
at Port Jackson at the early period
referred to, the four families pro-
ceeded overland from Sydney, and
crossed the Murray River in the
vicinity of Albury, the Kinchingtons
and the Streets, who were related,
settling about 20 miles apart, re-
spectively at “Thillingananga” and
“Baranduda,” near Yackandandah.
The late George Kinchington, sen.,
claimed to be the earliest settler to
turn a furrow on what is now known
as Kilwa, one of the most prosperous
farming districts in Australia, and
“Thillingananga,” which he devel-
oped as a pastoral run, remained in
his possession until the day of his
death, which occurred in the seventy-
second year of his age, after over a
quarter of a century spent in the
land of his adoption. The enterprise
carried on by the family in-
cluded the manufacture of butter
and cheese for the Sydney markets,
and some idea of the difficulties with
which the pioneers had to contend
may be gained from the statement
that the only means of transport
they had for their produce was by
bullock dray, and by this they sent
their cheese and butter over a dis-
tance of 350 miles to the market, at
a time when the country was in-
habited by numerous and frequently
hostile aborigines. Mr. John Oliver
Kinchington’s father, who at the
time of his arrival was a lad under
10 years of age, was one of the first
white boys to cross to the Victorian
side of the River Murray, when the
stream of civilized settlement began
to trend in that direction. He at

once became associated with the
pioneer pastoral and agricultural
operations inaugurated by the
founder of the family under the
Southern Cross, and after his father’s
death eventually he settled on part
of the old “Thillingananga” estate,
portions of which had been resumed
and thrown open for selection.
Before this period, however, he
joined in the various rushes to
the Victorian gold-diggings, being
amongst the first on the Bendigo,
Ballarat, Beech worth, and other
well-known alluvial fields, where he
met with varying results, but finally
settled down to agrarian pursuits at
“Thillingananga.” In later years
he spent some time in Queensland
with his son, John Oliver, one
of the representative men of the
Mitchell district. Subsequently he
returned to Kergunyah, where he
died on September 29, 1914, being
survived by a family of three sons
and six daughters. One of the sons
settled in Northern Queensland and
another in South Australia. The
second son, Mr. John Oliver Kin-
chington, received his education at
Yackandandah, Victoria, and at the
age of 16 years became his father’s
assistant on the home property,
where he remained until reaching his
twentieth year. With the object of
enlarging his experience and getting
a start in life, he left home and
obtained a position on a station in
the Lachlan district of New South
Wales, where he remained for two
years, gaining valuable experience,
which has proved of great assistance
to him in his subsequent career. He
next directed his steps towards
Queensland, and from 1883 onwards
carried on numerous contracts in
connection with pastoral proper-
ties, his first engagement being at
“Hoganthulla,” on the Warrego
River. He continued successfully in
this sphere of labour until 1895, in
which year the “Mitchell Downs”
Station area was resumed for closer
settlement purposes, and Mr. Kin-
chington availed himself of the
opportunity to select his present
homestead block, comprising over
2,000 acres, which he forthwith
started to improve. As his en-
deavours were crowned with success,
he made further selection of adjacent

possessions by purchase until at the
time of writing he is the owner
of over 23,000 acres of first-
class country. This he has devoted


mainly to sheep-raising, the flock
numbering about 8,000, besides
which from 100 to 150 head of cattle
are depastured. A few horses of a
as many as 400 acres have been
placed under cultivation of this

ments tending to the advancement
and welfare of the community in

of the Booringa Shire Council for
about a decade, during which period
he filled the office of chairman for
a term. He was among those chiefly
instrumental in securing the present
public hospital for the district at a
institution, and the Maranoa Pas-
toral, Agricultural, and Industrial
Association claims his attention in a
like capacity, besides which he is
president of the Mitchell Amateur
Race Club. Mr. Kinchington mar-

months, during which period he
gained considerable knowledge of the
conditions of the country. Leaving
the Downs, he proceeded westward,
and spent the following three years
in the district surrounding Mitchell,
making the most of his opportuni-
ties for observation, and acquiring
valuable pastoral experience. Hav-

runs. The “Sandford” homestead is
situated on the eastern bank of the
Maranoa River, five miles from the
town of Mitchell, the nearest rail-
way siding being “Marbango,” dis-
taut 365 miles from Brisbane. A
flower garden adds attractiveness to
the home, and close at hand are
to be seen the necessary outhouses,
well built and complete in their
varied appointments. Sheep-raising
is the principal industry carried on
by Mr. Westcott, who has been suc-
cessful in securing good results with
merinos and crossbred strains, to
Shorthorns of a good type. The
breeding of saddle hacks and draught
horses for station requirements forms
another branch of operations, the
surplus stock being sold at the local
saleyards at satisfactory prices. Mr.
Westcott, since coming to the dis-
trict, has never failed to play his
part in the building up of better
conditions for the settler “out west,”
and has grudged neither time nor
money in the endeavour to further
the welfare of the community among
the members of which he cast in his
lot over three decades ago. He has
occupied a seat on the Booringa
Shire Council for the lengthy period
of fifteen years, on four occasions
being elected to the presidential
chair. He is a committeeman and
an ex-president of the Maranoa Pas-

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


ROBERT FRANCIS DOUGLAS,
“Eversfield,” via Mungallala, was
born at “Kilmorey” Station, near
Mitchell, Queensland, on October 25,
1870, and is the eldest son of Mr.
MR. R. F. DOUGLAS.
Robert Douglas, well known as the
pioneer of “Mount Maria” Station,
near Morven. The gentleman under
review received his education under
his capacities. In this way he early
gained an intimate acquaintance with
the workings of a pastoral proposi-
tion, and by the time he concluded
his studies at the age of 16, he
already was well qualified to take his
place as his father’s right hand in
the administration of the station.
Amongst other duties he undertook
all responsibility in connection with
the important work of droving, and
brought to a successful conclusion
numerous trips of this nature. In
1898, owing to the low prices prevail-
ing for stock, he decided to open a
butchering establishment at Mitchell,
with the object of securing better
returns for a portion of the “Mount
Maria” stock. The drought which
set in about a year later, however,
necessitated a change of scheme, and
in 1903 he disposed of his butchering
interests and entered into partner-
ship with his father in “Mount
Maria.” In 1911, “Eversfield,’ his
present property, was placed on the
market by Messrs. Chandler & Co.,
and Mr. R. F. Douglas became the
purchaser, following which he started
operations on his own account at an
early date, and has since devoted the
whole of his time and attention to
the development of this station. The
property is situated on Mungallala
Creek, having a double frontage of
about 10 miles to this watercourse, in
in different localities, where conser-
vation on a large scale removes all
anxiety with regard to possible
droughty seasons. As a matter of

and mulga. The axes of the ring-
barkers, however, very soon wrought
havoc among the box and sandal-
wood belts, and at the time of
writing about 15,000 acres have
been cleared, while the work is
still being proceeded with on other
parts of the run. An excellent growth
of nutritious grasses now covers the
rung areas, and the pasturage on
“Eversfield” is excelled by few
similar properties in the Maranoa
district, or even in the whole of
Queensland. The country is undulat-
ing, with soils varying from sandy
loam to the good red soil indicative
of volcanic action in the past, and is
peculiarly suited to the requirements
of a cattle station. “Eversfield”
in normal seasons carried from
3,000 to 4,000 head of stock, but
the reduction of numbers resulting
on a calamitous period of drought
has not yet been made up, and the
present herd numbers in the vicinity
of 1,600. The type of cattle favoured
is the Hereford breed, and although
Mr. Douglas for some time has been
experimenting with the popular Red
Polls, he has decided to remain true
to his earlier choice, considering the
Hereford in every respect suited to
the conditions of the locality. Horses
are bred for station use, and a con-
siderable number find their way to
the local saleyards, where they com-
mand a ready sale. The sire in use is
“Sabre,” by “Sabretache,” whose
pedigree includes the names of such
well-known horses as “Robinson
Crusoe,” “Fireworks,” and “Night-
light,” by “Archie,” was imported
from New Zealand. The homestead,
built by Mr. Douglas in 1912, is a
modern, 10-roomed house, with wide
verandahs circling its walls, and
up-to-date appointments marking the
interior. Water is laid on from a
permanent well in the garden, and
flowers, fruit trees, and vegetables
are cultivated with success. Out-
houses and stockyards have received
due attention, and all the necessary
requirements of a first-class station
property are found on “Eversfield.”
Mr. R. S. Douglas has always given
a due share of his time and attention
to those matters calling for his co-
operation, in which the whole com-
munity could claim a stake, and from
his youth up has figured prominently
in public affairs. He was appointed a
Justice of the Peace by the Philp
Government in 1900. He is a member
of the Booringa Shire Council and
of the Leichhardt Rabbit Board, and
in the fulfilment of his duties in
connection with these bodies has long
distances to travel, attendance at the
periodical meetings involving jour-
neys to Mitchell and Roma, of 50 and
100 miles respectively. He is also a
committeeman of the Maranoa Pas-
toral, Agricultural, and Industrial
Association, and of the Mitchell
Cottage Hospital, of which institu-
tion he is one of the founders. He is
a foundation member of the Maranoa
Race Club, and has always evinced
the keenest interest in its welfare.
Mr. Douglas married in 1903 Flor-
ence Emma, daughter of the late

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


CHARLES ALEXANDER
MACFARLANE, of the firm of
Gore & Macfarlane, stock and station
agents, Mitchell, was born at “Bid-
denham” Station, near Charleville,
Queensland, on January 12, 1883.
He is a son of the late John Holds-
worth Macfarlane, who came to Aus-
tralia from Leeds, England, in 1852,
with his father, the late Dr. Mac-
farlane, who practised as a physician
in Melbourne for about a decade fol-
lowing his arrival there. The Mac-
farlane family belongs to the old
Scottish clan of that name, which
had its headquarters in the high-
lands of the Ben Lomond district.
At the outset of his career, how-
ever, Dr. Macfarlane left his native
heath, and engaged in the practice
of his profession in England until
the time of his departure for Aus-
tralian shores. Whilst still in the
prime of life he relinquished pro-
fessional work for the purpose of
launching out in the pastoral in-
dustry, and in 1862 he purchased
‘‘Bendemere,” in the Yeulba dis-
trict of Queensland. This property is
now owned by Mr. Frederick J.
Bowman, who secured the run, which
at that period carried close on
100,000 sheep, for £30,000. Dr.
Macfarlane and his family resided
at “Bendemere” until the time of
DR. MACFARLANE.
his death, in the year 1870. Of the
family of six sons and one daughter
who survived him, five of the sons
engaged in pastoral enterprise, one
of whom (Mr. H. T. Macfarlane)
later became well known in the Civil
Service as police magistrate for many
years at South Brisbane. The re-
maining son qualified for the medical
profession, and is now practising in
the New Norfolk district, Tasmania.
The only daughter married a naval
medical officer, and is now residing
in England. Mr. Charles Alexander
Macfarlane’s father was the eldest
of the sons, and when about twenty-
five years of age he started opera-
tions on his own behalf on a cattle
property on the Nogoa River, in the
Springsure district. Having disposed
of this holding in the early seven-
ties, he took up “Biddenham,” near
Charleville, which he worked as a
sheep proposition, disposing of the
holding in 1884 to purchase
MR. JOHN HOLDSWORTH MACFARLANE.
“Waroonga,” in the Mitchell district,
where he died in 1901, leaving a
worthy record behind him as a good
and useful citizen. He was survived
by a family of three sons and two
daughters. The eldest son is engaged
in sheep-raising on the Darling
Downs, the second is manager of the
St. George branch of the Queensland
National Bank, whilst the youngest
—the subject of this notice —has his
residence at Mitchell, where he
manages the branch business estab-
lished there by his firm in 1913. Mr.
C. A. Macfarlane was educated at
The King’s School, Parramatta, sub-
sequently returning to “Waroonga,”
where he assisted in the working of
the property until after the death of
his father, when he joined the staff
of the Queensland National Bank
at Toowoomba. He continued in the
service of this institution for nearly
a decade, receiving a thorough train-
ing in all branches of banking. He
MR. CHARLES ALEXANDER MACFARLANE.
filled the position of accountant at
Cunnamulla, Goombungee, and Gat-
ton successively, and for a period
was acting manager at Goombungee.
About this time he made the
acquaintance of Mr. A. C. Gore,
then carrying on business as a stock
and station agent at Cambooya, who
was successful in inducing him to
sever his connection with the Bank,
with a view to forming a partner-
ship. This was duly accomplished,
and subsequently Mr. Macfarlane
returned to the Western district,
where the good name of his family
had been sustained through two
generations, and opened a branch at
Mitchell, the new firm being known
under the title of Gore & Macfarlane.
Under the efficient control of Mr.
Macfarlane the business has gone
ahead in a most satisfactory manner,
and is now one of the foremost con-
cerns of its kind in Western
Queensland.
RICHARD TARRANT HAR-
GRAVE MACKIE, J.P., ‘Fairy
Meadow,” near Chinchilla, was born
at Condamine township in the year
1876, and is the fourth son of Mr.
Robert Clilfe Mackie, a native of
Maitland, New South Wales. The
latter gentleman was well known
as a carrier between Roma and


Dalby in the early days. Ho
opened and built an hotel in
Condamine, and subsequently took
up “Cobberina” and “Tara”—
holdings which combined an area
MR. R. T. H. MACKIE.
of 100 square miles, which he leased
from the Crown on a basis of 10s.
per square mile. At a later period
he selected 5,000 acres of country on
“Wambo,” which has developed into
the “Fairy Meadow” of to-day, and
still later purchased “Wieambilla,”
an area of 160 square miles, and
running at one time up to 5,000
head of cattle, from the Hon. H. M.
Nelson, a property which he acquired
on the basis of 18s. per square mile.
All these runs were devoted to cattle,
and were made over to the gentleman
under review by Mr. Cliffe Mackie
on his retirement to Brisbane in
1901. He was for many years a
member of the Hamilton Shire
Council and other bodies initiated
for the general welfare. Mr. Richard
T. H. Mackie was educated at
“Fairy Meadow,” and gained his
pastoral experience under his father.
The area which the latter placed
in his hands embraced 260 square
miles of leasehold, 5,000 acres
of freehold, and 3,760 acres of
grazing farm land. The young man
was handicapped at the outset by
the disastrous drought of 1901-2.
At the latter end of the year 1901
he sent 800 of his stock to New
South Wales, hoping thus to secure
their safety; but at the end of that
year the drought had claimed the
lot, besides an amount of £lOO in
cash, which he had been obliged to
forward in defrayment of expenses.
At the same time his stock were
perishing on his stations to such an
extent that in the year 1903 he was
able to muster not more than 316
head (including calves). As a result
he abandoned “Wieambilla” and
“Cobberina,” and moved the balance
of his stock to “Fairy Meadow.” As
an example of the relative values of
cattle during those years, it is worth
recording that Mr. Mackie paid
exactly £4 ss. per head for cattle
to re-stock this estate in 1903-4 in
excess of what his father had received
for cattle sold in 1901. After the
drought he took cattle and horses
on agistment at “Fairy Meadow,”
which was also used as a depot
for the surplus horses originally
purchased for the South African
war, and which it was necessary
to paddock until satisfactorily
disposed of. In the year 1905
he was able to retrieve some of
his losses through new stock of his
own breeding, and in that year he
selected leasehold land to the extent
of some 4,500 acres on the "Wambo”
estate adjoining “Fairy Meadow,”
which he holds under conditional
purchase. In 1908 he ceased breed-
ing, and devoted his land solely to
the fattening of store cattle, although
in the year 1917 he resumed the
former branch, and now carries on
the industry in both departments.
His landed interests embrace an
area of 20,000 acres (including
several blocks within the municip-
ality and a trucking depot of an
area of 600 acres), with a carrying
capacity for fattening purposes of
from 1,200 to 1,500 head. He
has spent thousands of pounds in
improvements, particularly in eradi-
cating the prickly pear, and at date
of writing has succeeded in rendering
10,000 acres of his country absolutely
free of the pest, despite the fact
that he is walled in all round with
it. “Fairy Meadow” has a seven-
mile frontage to the Condamine
River, which, supplemented by dams
built in the back country, affords
a never failing water supply. It is
well fenced and subdivided into 12
paddocks, the country being timbered
with brigalow, myall, box, ironbark,
and sandalwood. The homestead,
which was erected by the owner in
1912, is most suitably built for the
climate, the walls being 14 feet in
height, and the rooms, which receive
illumination through the installation
of Quirk’s Air Gas System, are
exceptionally large and airy. The
garden, both from a picturesque and
utilitarian standpoint, has ade-
quately repaid the care bestowed
upon it; and one of the chief
features of the grounds is a small
orchard of orange and mandarin
trees which proclaim by the
excellence of their crops the
suitability of the country for citrus-
fruit culture. Mr. Mackie takes a
prominent part in public life, being
a member of the shire council, the
marsupial board, show society, and
very many other public bodies. He
was created a Justice of the Peace
by the Philp Government. In sport
he excels as an angler and rifleman.
His reputation as a fine shot was
first gained in earlier days, when
he frequently devoted a month to
the sport of brumbie and wild-bull
shooting; and he tells some exciting
stories of these hunts. He is a
keen motorist, and drives the latest

which does splendid work in the
rough country. He married, in
1908, Catherine, daughter of the
late M. F. Connelly, of Dalby.


JOHN SMITH, “Armadilla,” via
Morven, was born at “Ironbark”
Station, in the New England dis-
trict of New South Wales, on March
1, 1849, being the fourth child
MR. JOHN SMITH.
of the late William Smith, a member
of an old Puritan family, of Suffolk,
England, who came to Australia in
the late thirties. For many genera-
tions this branch of the Smith family
had been noted for the strong views
it entertained on the ethics of
Christianity, and the originator of
the line in Australia, on account of
the pressure he put on his neigh-
bours in attempting to enforce a
standard of conduct which he con-
sidered more in accordance with the
teaching of Christ, was subjected to
much persecution in the land of his
fathers. Accordingly, he sought
refuge in a new country, and became
a pioneer of pioneers under the
Southern Cross. He lived faithfully
according to his convictions until his
death in 1866, in the 56th year of
his age. The late William Smith was
a personal friend of the founder of
the religious cult which he followed,
known as “The New Dispensation,”
under which title its adherents have
made their influence felt as instruc-
tors in the worship of God “in spirit
and in faith,” without the aid of
any outward form or ceremony. The
subject of this review, Mr. John
Smith, is in full sympathy with the
religious convictions of his father’s
family, and, being a deep thinker,
has made a thorough study of the
subject of the “New Dispensation.”
He has made it his life-work to
revise the writings of the late
Stephen Spencer, who was trained
by the founder of the great work,
the founder’s brother participating,
which will be explanatory of the
teachings of the Bible from the point
of view of the New Dispensationists
in the near future. Mr, John Smith
received his education under the
parental rooftree, opportunity for
scholastic instruction then being

extremely limited. From childhood,
he and his brothers had to put their
shoulder to the wheel in right earn-
est to assist in the maintenance of
the family. Their father originally
entered upon agrarian pursuits in

Queensland in 1859, subsequent to
which date he engaged in the pas-
toral industry, settling first at

Roma district, which was taken up
bv the family in that year. Suffer-
ing a severe setback by the drought
of 1866, they were forced to abandon
“Mount Beagle,” and settled on
“Stewart Creek,” adjoining the
former holding. From here the
younger members of the family
struck out for themselves, Mr. John
Smith starting his independent ca-
reer at twenty-three years of age.
Taking up the country now com-
prised in the “Ularunda” run, he
purchased from the well-known Bar-
ton family their interests in “Arma-
dilla” run, paying down the sum of
£2OO, which really only covered the
cost of a dam which had been con-
structed and an old bark hut which
served as a dwelling. His maternal
uncle, the late Stephen Spencer,
made himself responsible for the
financing of the scheme, in which
Mr. John Smith was joined by his
brother Stephen. Two young men
stocked the holding with their share
of the Stewart Creek cattle, and
conjointly controlled the proposition
until 1890, when a separation took
place by mutual consent, and Mr.
John Smith purchased “Tyrconnel
Downs”—a property which, since
that date, has been resumed for
purposes of closer settlement. Mr,
Smith spent six years on “Tyrconnel
Downs,” when disaster in the shape
of the severe drought of 1896 again
overtook him, and at forty-seven
years of age he found himself
practically penniless, and faced with
the problem of having to begin the
building up of his fortunes all over
again. His firm faith in Providence
and belief that all was ordained for
the best, however, sustained him,
and returning to “Armadilla,” his
present home, then occupied by his
brother, he and his family literally
worked for their living, accepting no
further remuneration than the daily
necessaries of life. Less than a year
later his opportunity to make a fresh
start occurred, and he took advan-
tage of it by arranging with his

brother and the New Zealand Loan
Company to secure 1,400 sheep, 10
horses, and 35 cattle, which he oh-
tained for the small sum of £2OO.
He shepherded his flock, carefully
choosing the best pastures and places
where water was plentiful, and
eventually settled at “Horseshoe
Lagoon,” a property owned by his
nephew, Mr. George Daniel Smith.
Here he remained until the “Beacons-
field” Estate, near Roma, came into
the market, and having purchased
this holding he removed thither,
and made his home there for about
a couple of years. In January, 1902,
he repurchased his old home, “Ar-
madilla,” from his brother; but here
again the misfortune which seems to
have been his lot in life overtook
him, the big drought of that year
reducing his stock by over 60 per
cent. However, with the assistance of
a good wife and a son and daughter,
who, although mere children, were
able to render material help, again
he was able to weather the storm,
and to overcome the difficulties
which at first appeared insurmount-
able. With the advent of better sea-
sons, the return of prosperity was
assured, and he has since carried on
successfully at “Armadilla,” which
may be looked upon as one of the
historic properties of the district.
Mr. Smith has been twice married,
his first wife being Eliza Louisa,
daughter of the late William Spen-
cer, of Ironbark, New South Wales.
This lady was survived by a son and
two daughters. The son, Herbert
Stephen, is now engaged with his
father in the administration of the
property. The present Mrs. Smith is
a daughter of the late Edward
Comer-Brand, a descendant of an
old Devonshire family, who mi-
grated to India, where he owned
indigo plantations.


ISAAC GIBBS MARSH,
"Verona,” Morven, was born on
October 7, 1877, at "Hillsborough,”
the oldest settled station on the
Maranoa River. He is the youngest
son of the late William Marsh, who
came to Queensland in 1864, settling
with his brother, Mr. Thomas Marsh,
on the last-mentioned property,
where he carried on until his death
in 1903. The gentleman under re-
view received his education under
private tuition in his own home, and
during the hours not claimed by
study took his share of the work of
the station, with which he became
familiarized at an early age. At 16
he left his schooldays behind him,
and henceforth, in conjunction with
his two elder brothers, devoted the
whole of his time to the working of
the home proposition, which, with
some aboriginal assistance was
almost entirely carried out by the
hardy young pioneers. The sheep
with which the station was founded
had in Mr. Isaac Marsh’s day given
way to cattle, and it was in connec-
tion with the latter class of stock
that he gained his earliest experi-
ence. Owing to the fact that the old
property was not considered of suffi-
cient acreage to provide a living for
three families, Mr. Isaac Marsh,
some three years subsequent to his
share of capital and some stock from
the old home property, he took up
the forfeited lease, "Dulbydilla,”

family in the sixties, and at the
time of writing in possession of Mr.
Roland Winten. This property he
stocked with the cattle brought from
he had been going ahead with the
improvement of the property, and
having increased his original herd by
about 300 per cent., he disposed of it
to the present holder in 1911. His
next step was to acquire "Lyra
Park,” in the Peak Downs district,
an unstocked property, for which
he purchased a large mob of cattle.
Disaster, however, waited upon his
endeavours. Whilst the cattle were
on their way to the new pastures they
developed the dreaded disease red-
water, from which 70 per cent, of
them succumbed. This misfortune
left him in the worst possible condi-
tion. Ruin stared him in the face;
every penny he possessed had gone,
and the outlook was indeed heart-
breaking. Nevertheless, being bred
of a hardy pioneer stock, and the
representative of a race which never
would acknowledge defeat, he refused
to give way to despair. His family
name was good, and his own known
integrity stood him in good stead at
this time of trial. Successfully secur-
ing the assistance of a financial insti-
tution, he stocked "Lyra Park” with
sheep—his first experience wdth this
class of stock —and shortly after-
wards closed with a good offer for the
property, leaving himself once again
without acres. Almost immediately,
however, he was fortunate enough to
father’s death, decided to seek fresh
fields for his energy and industry.
Accordingly, being apportioned his

results that after two years he real-
ized the need of a larger acreage, and
selling out once more, purchased his
present property, “Verona,” early in
1917. The run, comprising 40,000
acres, situated some 20 miles north

bered, well-grassed, level to undulat-
ing country, with stretches of mulga
scrub and box-covered flats. The
Angellala Creek winds its way for
about 12 miles through the run,
which is also watered by several wells
and a large tank, whilst in this
department Mr. Marsh has various

water supply abundant for the most
Mr. W. Wallace, by whom the land
was originally taken up, and who
also gave due attention to the erec-
tion of the necessary outhouses,
stockyards, etc., all of which are
equipped according to the require-
ments of the station. Only a small
flock inhabited the pastures of
“Verona” when Mr. Marsh took
possession, and stocking-up engaged
the new owner’s earliest attention.
For this purpose he purchased 6,000
merinos, and from the nucleus thus
provided he hopes in the near future
to increase the number to the full
carrying capacity of the run. Mr.
Marsh takes a lively interest in
matters of local importance, but his
private business affairs have pre-
vented him from accepting the
responsibility of public office. He is
an advocate of clean sport, and a keen
supporter of the local amateur race
club, always having a horse to carry
his colours at the picnic meetings,
which are a popular feature of
recreation in the neighbourhood. He
keeps a few good mares, and recently
acquired the sire “Rushton,” by

stringent demands likely to be made

has also made various additions and
improvements to the homestead,
which was built by his predecessor,

in 1907 Mary, daughter of Mr.
Robert Douglas, of “Mount Maria”
Station, Morven, and has a family of
one son and three daughters.

purposes of closer settlement. It
was taken up by Messrs. Metcalfe
and Manning in the late nineties,
and subsequently became the
embrace some 110,000 acres, lying in
a northerly direction from the town-
ship of Morven, the homestead being
situated about 26 miles from the
town. It is well-grassed country,
consisting largely o,f open downs
timbered lightly with box, varied by
mulga ridges. In the northern and
o o .
more valuable portion of the run
the land is undulating in character,
providing watershed for a number of
creeks, from which the property
partially derives its water supply.
Localities suitable for sinking for
sub-artesian water are found all over
the property, and as many as 10 bores
have been put down at depths vary-
ing from 250 to 750 feet. From these
a splendid provision for all stock
purposes is secured, the water being
raised chiefly by means of windmills,
and at each bore have been fitted
two 20,000-gallon storage tanks. At
one bore, where large quantities of
water are required for the herd in
minimum time, engine power is used
for pumping. The result of these
conservation measures and the large
amount of bore-sinking which has
been completed is the suspension of all
anxiety in regard to water supply, as
even in the severest seasons of
drought which have been experienced
during recent years no scarcity has
been felt. At the northern end of the

shrubs and fruit trees also find a
place in convenient proximity, pro-
viding a cool and pleasant greenery
very pleasing to the eye. “Etona” is
devoted to mixed stock, sheep, cattle,
and horses all being depastured on
the run. The flock consists of some
17,000 sheep, while 1,000 head of
cattle and a mob of about 100 horses
are usually grazed, of the latter both
draughts and saddle hacks being bred
on the estate, those not required for
home use finding a ready sale at the
local markets. The station affairs
are under the control of Mr. R. C.
Capel, second son of the proprietor.
Mr. Albert Capel was born at
“Piedmont,” New South Wales, on
March 30, 1854, and is descended
from an old English family who have
resided in Gloucestershire for many
generations. His father, the late
Daniel Capel, who was the founder
of his line in Australia, first made
his advent to the land of the South-
ern Cross in the thirties, over 80
years back. He was a younger son,
and like many another scion of the
better-class English families, left the
place of his birth to seek his fortune
in a distant part of the Empire,
which, except for the romantic tales
told by travellers, was a terra in-
cognita to the great majority of
dwellers in the British Isles. Bring-
ing with him his patrimony, this
descendant of the Capels of “Merrie
England” arrived in the Mother
Colony of the vast, unpopulated
continent of Australia, and shortly
afterwards took up a block of land
situated near Barraba, in the Tam-
worth district of New South Wales,
to which he gave the name of “Pied-
mont.” This property is still in the
family at the time of writing,
being owned by Mr. Daniel Capel, a
brother of the proprietor of “Etona,”
who resides upon the estate. Here
he inaugurated stock raising opera-
tions, breeding both sheep and cattle

Mr. Albert Capel, who was one of the
younger members of the family, re-
ceived his education at St. Leonard’s

Albert Capel forthwith took up his
residence on the newly-acquired


estate, and having fitted himself for
a position of responsibility, subse-
quently took over the management of

ing on the Queensland border which
came into the possession of the

time other properties were acquired,
amongst which was included “Derra

New South Wales, which became the
permanent home of Mr. Albert Capel
and of his children in their earlier
years. He still resides at “Derra
Derra,” and in the absence of three
of his sons, who were fighting with
the Australian Imperial Forces at
the front, personally carried on the
administration of station matters.
Mr. Capel has always taken an active
interest in such things as pertain
to the advancement of the districts
and communities with which he has
been identified, and with his brothers
is well known over a wide radius. He
served for a time as a member of the
Bingara Shire Council, and did use-
ful work in this connection. He was
married at “Piedmont” in the year
1880 to Christine Mary, daughter
of the late David Farquhar,
of Clarencetown, New South Wales,
and of the union there is a surviving
family of six sons and four daughters.
Of the sons four have obeyed the call
of their King and country to active
service on the battlefield, in the cause
of liberty and national honour. The
eldest, Sydney Vivian Capel, was act-
ing as manager for the Queensland
property “Etona,” purchased by
his father in 1909, which position

of the above-mentioned city. The
progenitors of the Douglas family
inhabited the Highlands of Scotland
for centuries, and the pages of
ancient history abound with stirring

tales of the exploits of the “Black
Douglas" who held sway over a large
portion of the country, and of the
acts of terror resorted to by him and
his fellow-chieftains when the power-
ful Douglas clan was in danger of
losing its territory. Subsequent
records show that the Douglas family
ranked among the early Scottish
aristocracy, and its Queensland re-
presentatives are blood connections
of the present Earl of Angus. The
well-known Douglas, personal friend
and adviser of the Duke of Welling-
ton, was also of the same line. The
crest of this branch of the family is
a salamander in a flame of fire,
and their motto, “Jamais arriere.”
After a lapse of hundreds of years,
descendants of the fiery old Highland
chieftains have found an outlet for
their activities in the more peaceful
work of empire-building under the
Southern Cross, and have done much
useful work in the direction of
opening up territory and bringing

under civilized conditions the unde-
veloped districts of the great island-
continent of Australia. Early in the
nineteenth century —in the year 1826
—an adventurous Scottish lad, one
Robert Douglas, ran away from
home, and shipped on board a
whaler, being then in his tenth year.
He spent three years in the whaling-
service, and subsequently transferred
to the mercantile marine, during
which period he studied the science
of navigation, with the intention of
embracing seafaring pursuits as a
profession. In 1836 he visited Aus-
tralian shores, and upon his return
to England found himself obsessed
with thoughts of the great “unknown
land" in the southern hemisphere,
which called him to break the ties
which bound him and to enter upon
the life of an Australian pioneer.
Embarking on a vessel bound for
Port Jackson, he sailed for the
country of his desire with high hopes,
despite shallow pockets and little in
them. It was soon discovered that

serious straits. A coufei'ence resulted
in Robert Douglas volunteering his
services, and having given satisfac-
tory proof of his knowledge of
navigation, he was placed in charge


as commander, while the former
captain was put in irons. Mr.
Douglas brought the ship and its
human freight safely to port, and for
his services was the recipient of a

on his own account in pastoral
enterprise. His property, “Redbank
Plains,” comprised a large area of
country in close vicinity to the town,
and adjoining a cattle station estab-
lished by the New South Wales
Government for the purpose of
supplying meat to the convicts. After
the settlement of the district had
become assured, the Government of
the day sold the station and stock to
Mr. Douglas, disposing of the cattle
at 7s. 6d. a head, with calves under
six months old thrown in. In 1855,
after carrying on this proposition
a soap factory at Kangaroo Point,
Brisbane, which also proved a profit-
able venture, and to this he devoted
his energies for nearly a decade.
After giving up the soap works he
continued to reside at Kangaroo
Point until his property there was
purchased by the Government. He
then took a trip to the Old Country,
upon his return investing his capital
in real estate in Brisbane. He died
in the year 1890, having played a
useful part in the land of his adop-
tion, and assisted in pioneer enter-
prise in its earliest stages, leaving a
worthy example to the family of
three sons and four daughters surviv-
ing him. It is interesting to note
that the late Robert Douglas for a
time filled the office of Sergeant-at-
Arms of the Queensland Parliament.
The present owner of “Mount Maria”
Station, who bears the same name as
his father and grandfather before
him, is the eldest son of the late
Robert Douglas, his mother being
a native of New South Wales,
and daughter of an old pioneer of
the Mother State named Hartley.
He was educated primarily at a
private school in Ipswich, subse-
quently attending an academy in
Brisbane, conducted by the late Mr.
Mowbray, a well-known personality
of the early days. Leaving school at
16 years of age, Mr. Douglas
proceeded westward, and having a
strong leaning towards bush life,
was fortunate in easily securing
employment. Until 1865 he followed
OLD HOMESTEAD AND IMPROVEMENTS, SHOWING HOMESTEAD OF MR HUGH ALLAN DOUGLAS NEAR BY.
1838 he travelled overland to the
northern part of New South Wales,
then known as Moreton Bay, to
which the name of Queensland sub-
sequently was given, and taking up
successfully for some 16 years, Mr.
Douglas sold out to the late William
Turner, of “Helidon,” shortly after-
wards retiring from pastoral pursuits.
His next enterprise was to establish
all manner of station avoca-
tions, filling positions on various
stations on the Dawson and Maranoa
Rivers, but giving preference to those
which involved the handling of


cattle, and becoming an expert in
regard to the management of this
particular class of stock. In 1865 he
secured the contract for the supply
of timber for the building of bridges
over the rivers referred to above, and
in this branch of industry he was
kept fully employed for about three
years. The year 1868 was the signal
for yet another change of occupa-
tion, when he started cotton-growing
at Ipswich. However, with many
others of the earnest and enthusiastic
spirits determined to make a success
of what seemed likely to prove one
of Queensland’s most promising in-
dustries, he was forced at last to
admit the impossibility of producing
a profitable crop, his efforts, as a
matter of fact, terminating in com-
plete failure. Undaunted by this
untoward experience, Mr. Douglas
returned to the pastoral industry,
and turning his former experience to
good account, undertook the manage-
ment of “Wallumbilla” Station on
behalf of his brother-in-law, Mr. Zee.
He gave much anxious consideration
to the question of launching out
on his own account, and in 1874 he
took up a property situated at the
head of the Maranoa River. This
run, now known as “Warrong,”

he decided to abandon a hopeless
task, and selling out, purchased from
a Cingalee, who had taken it up 12
months previously, the block of
country, 40 miles in extent, which
now surrounds the homestead of
“Mount Maria,” where Mr. Douglas
resides with his family. In September
ber of 1875 he settled on the run,

themselves at home in their new
quarters. As an instance of the hard-

slow degrees were the barest comforts
of life secured. The young couple
had a rough financial row to hoe, and
only by dint of patience, persever-
ance, and cheerfulness were the first


difficulties overcome and tlie tardy
rewards of their labour reaped. In
time, however, steady work began to
tell, and now, in the autumn of their
life, surrounded by comfort and
luxury, the pioneers can afford to
smile at the vicissitudes of their
early days. “Mount Maria” Station
is situated in the Warrego district,
the homestead lying about 14 miles
north-east of Morven. The country
is undulating, rising in parts to
mountainous heights, and the various
loamy soils produce for the most part
a prolific growth of natural grasses.
The native timber comprises prin-
cipally box and mulga. “Mount
Maria” is deficient in natural surface
water, but the lack has been made
good by abundant conservation, dams
and tanks of large holding capacity
having been constructed in various
places. From 3,000 to 4,000 head of
pure-bred Hereford cattle graze over
the 348 square miles of country now
comprising the “Mount Maria” run,
and Mr. Douglas has the satisfaction
of knowing that he has been able to
build up a herd, the excellence of
which is recognized all over Queens-
land. The animals remain true to
type, and representatives from the
run on numerous occasions have
figured successfully in the show rings
of the State. There are about 150
head of horses on the station, a large
number being required for the work

time of writing possesses a strain of

progeny was by a “Bill of Portland”

erable area of ground, and presents

a picturesque appearance, additions
having been judiciously made to the
original structure, which was built
with pit-sawn planks in the early
days. Facing in a northerly direc-
tion, the old home is brightened by
masses of flowers in the front garden,
while it overlooks miles of rich,
lightly-timbered flats and higher
country covered with mulga, which
has proved a splendid stand-by to the
pastoralist in dry seasons as fodder
for the stock. The well-built out-
houses are suited to all the require-
ments of the station, and spacious
cattle yards, strongly constructed
and up-to-date, show that expert
attention has been given to all
details necessary to secure success.
About a hundred yards distant from
the old homestead a more modern
residence has been reared, which is
occupied by Mr. Douglas’s second
son, and from a short distance off
the various buildings present the
appearance of a miniature village
settlement. Mr. Douglas has always
taken his share of the public work
of the district, and for a number of
years has done useful service on the
local rabbit and marsupial boards.
He received the Commission of the
Peace in 1881, having been one
of the first in the western districts
to be gazetted to this office. Mrs.
Douglas, whose maiden name was
Mary Deuchar Allan, is a daughter
of the late Hugh Allan, and niece
of Mr. John Deuchar, of “Glen-
gallan” Station, one of the most
notable and popular pioneers of the
Darling Downs. This lady, as before
hinted, has done her full share in
promoting her husband’s prosperity
by her sympathy and practical help
in the strenuous early days of their
life at “Mount Maria,” and now
en j°y s with him the reward of their
united toil. Of the union there is
issue three sons and seven daughters,
all of whom, with the exception of
one daughter, still survive. The
eldest son, Robert Francis, is owner
of “Eversfield” Station, in the
same district (described on page
204); the second, Hugh Allan, is
m partnership with his father at
Mount Maria”; and the youngest,
George Graham, owns a grazing farm
at the head of the Warrego River.
The second and third sons married
daughters of the late Thomas Jesser,
a well-known railway contractor of
South Australia, and subsequently of
Queensland.
ALFRED ERNEST COLDHAM,
J.P., “Cavendish,” Jericho, Central
Queensland, is a native of the
Western district of Victoria, his
birth having occurred in Hamilton
on November 20, 1867. He is the
fifth son of the late John Coldham,
of Grassdale,” Tehara, Victoria,
who was well known as one of the
most prominent of the early pastoral


landowners of the Garden State,
having arrived in Australia from
Norfolk, England, in the late
thirties. In the past the family was
closely identified with the ministry
MR. J. COLDHAM.
of the Established Church of Eng-
land in the Motherland, the late
gentleman’s father, the Rev. John
Coldham, having been rector of his
native village in Norfolk, in which
county the forbears of the gentleman
under review had long been estab-
lished. The village of Coldham, in
Norfolk, was named after the family.
On the maternal side of the house
the proprietor of “Cavendish” is of
Celtic descent, his mother being a
member of an ancient Irish family.
On his arrival in the land of tbe
Southern Cross, the late Mr. Cold-
ham obtained the necessary experi-
ence for his future calling as a
jackaroo on a pastoral property in
Victoria, and subsequently was well
known for a generation as one of the
pioneer pastoralists of the Western
district of the then colony, owning
“Grassdale” Station, near Hamil-
ton, for about forty years. This
historic property was sold after his
death, which occurred in the year
1882, and with him passed muck of
the romance which was intermingled
with the history of the earlier days
of the young continent. A family
of six sons survived him, all of whom
have made good not only on the land
and in the industry to which their
father had devoted his energies, but
in the wider field of public life, the
name being prominently associated
with many important movements
resulting in general benefit to the
community. The late Walter T.
Coldham, of Melbourne, the well-
known barrister, was a son of the
late pioneer, while another, the
eldest brother of the gentleman
under review, is also a pastoralist of
this State. Mr. Alfred Ernest Cold-
ham was educated at the Church of
MR. E. S. HEGARTY.
England Grammar School, Mel-
bourne, and in the year 1886, while
yet in his teens, completed his
collegiate course, shortly afterwards
entering the pastoral industry
as a jackaroo on the “Chet-
wynd” Estate, in the Western
district of Victoria. After a brief
period he relinquished this post in
order to undertake similar duties on
“Wolfang,” a Queensland property,
situated in the Clermont district, and
which was at that time in the hands
of his late father. From there he

later went to “Lanark,” a station
situated in the same locality, where
he became conversant with cattle
breeding. Subsequently he returned
to “Wolfang,” remaining on this
estate, which was then managed by
his late brother, Mr. John Coldham,
until the death of the latter in the
year 1891. In that year he assumed
the management of “Dunraven,” in
the vicinity of Barcaldine, a station

years at “Dunraven” in the capacity
of managing partner, and the high
degree of development which he


brought about on that property bears
witness to the thoroughness and
efficiency of the methods which he
instituted and carried out during
the period. Eventually he disposed

of his interests in the last-mentioned
proposition to his brother, and in the
year 1905 purchased “Arundel,” a
run situated near Ilfracombe, which
he sold to Mr. John Shannon nine
years later, having in the meantime
achieved similar results in the way
of development to those attained on
“Dunraven.” During his residence
at “Arundel” he purchased his pre-
sent property, “Cavendish,” enter-
ing into occupation in the year 1915,
and has since been engaged in the
personal conduct of this estate, which
was originally part of “Hobart-
ville.” The “Cavendish” homestead
is situated about 17 miles from
Jericho, the run embracing some
90,000 acres of pasturage of the type
generally described as “desert
country,” a misnomer which origin-
ated in the early days before the
highly desirable qualities character-
izing land of this description was
recognized by pioneers naturally
unacquainted with its exceptional
possibilities. The country is tim-
bered by ironbark and box in the
main, and patches of brigalow, the
soil being of a red loamy character,
which responds to a far lighter rain-
fall than would be productive of
growth in land more happily desig-
nated ; in fact, rainfalls which are
unproductive on the rolling downs
prove highly beneficial to the class
of country embraced in “Cavendish,”
which enjoys the reputation of being
a safe run in all seasons. The
nature of the top feed produced by
these light rainfalls is such that in
drought time there is considerable
provision for stock, and in conse-
quence of such natural advantages
and of the up-to-date system of
development carried out by the
owner, the results, in regard to the
quality of stock and wool, have
proved highly satisfactory. The
improvements include boundary and
subdivisional fencing and the con-
servation of water, the property
being amply supplied in the latter
respect by sub-artesian bores, and

by natural holes in the numerous
creeks with which it is inter-
sected. In ordinary seasons the
run is capable of carrying a
flock of 25,000 sheep, and is
chiefly devoted to the wool-growing
industry, though a small herd of
cattle is also profitably run. The
home is of modern design, having
been built on the most approved
lines with regard to the climatic
conditions of the Central West of
Queensland. It is surrounded by
wide verandahs, and contains airy
rooms furnished with many con-
veniences. Water is laid on to the
garden, wherein flourish both tender
blooms and beautiful shade and
fruit trees. Since his advent to
Queensland, Mr. Coldham has taken
a prominent part in the various
movements set afoot for the advance-
ment of the district and community
in which his lot is cast. He has
occupied a seat on the board of the
Ilfracombe Shire for about 10 years,
and since taking up his residence at
“Cavendish” has been a member of
the Jericho Shire Council, of which
body he is chairman at the time of
writing (1919). He was created a
Justice of the Peace by the Liberal
Administration in power 20 years
ago. He takes considerable interest
in pastoral matters, and has always
been to the fore in matters relating
to the welfare of the district. Mr.
Coldham is a member of the Queens-
land Club, Brisbane. He married
in 1892 Maude Evelyn, daughter of
Mr. E. S. Hegarty, a native of New
Zealand, and a descendant of an
ancient Celtic family, whose mem-
bers have made history in the isle
of saints and scholars for centuries.
The issue of the union is two
daughters.


CHARLES DENYER, grazier,
“Forest Yale,” Woolooga, is a
native of South Australia, being a
son of Mr. Charles Denyer, sen.,
now living in retirement. The elder
gentleman came to Australia in 1839
with his uncle, and eventually, after
learning the trade of a blacksmith,
took up land and turned his atten-
tion to farming pursuits in the
Central State. Young Charles Den-
yer began to earn his living at a
very early age by shepherding work
at Yankalilla, South Australia,
where he remained for about three
years. Subsequently, after a few
weeks spent in farming duties on
Yorke Peninsula and other places,
he proceeded to the Victorian mallee
country, where he became one of

the first settlers and did some useful
and jirofitable pioneer work in that
district. From there he came to
Queensland and purchased a farm at
Cowrie Little Plains, which after-
wards he sold and removed to “Vic-
toria Downs” Station, Morven, a
fine property, which is now the scene
of a thriving stud farm. Disposing
of “Victoria Downs,” he became
the owner of “Greenbank” Sta-
tion, near Dalby. Having success-
fully carried on the last-mentioned
station for some little time, he again
sold out, and, accompanied by his
wife, left on a trip to England, via
Canada and America. Whilst on
this trip he travelled through the
United Kingdom, Switzerland, and
Italy, finding much to interest him
during his year of absence. Upon
his return he took up “Dunmore,”
in the midst of the fine cattle coun-
try of the Dalby district, and he
embarked on the enterprise of breed-
ing and fattening cattle, in which
industry he is still engaged in this
place. His next venture was to join
Mr. F. W. Banks in the selection of
the country known as “Kendall,”
on the Thomson River, where the
two gentlemen inaugurated wool-
growing pursuits, and continued in
partnership for about two and a half
years. Then Mr. Denyer sold his
interest to the other member of the
firm and became the purchaser of
“Forest Yale,” of which he is sole
proprietor. This is a fine estate,
situated 12 miles from Woolooga,
and comprising about 4,000 acres,
the whole of it being very fine cattle
country, well watered by permanent
creeks and splendidly provided with
respect to shelter for the stock.
Whilst personally supervising his
cattle-breeding propositions, Mr.
Denyer for the past nine years has
resided at Toowoomba, where he has
interested himself in the public
affairs of the district, and at the
present time occupies a seat on the
Town Council at Newtown, a suburb
of that city. He has always taken a

and other prizes. Mr. Denyer also
holds a number of other awards for
various performers. Mr. Denyer
married Rose, youngest daughter of
the late Daniel Phillips, of Moonta,
Yorke Peninsula, South Australia,
and has two sons and one daughter,

"WILLIAM ARTHUR HARD-
ING, formerly owner of “Dun-

born at Wellington, South Australia,
on August 1, 1858. He is the
youngest son of the late Wil-
liam Green Harding, who, coming
originally from England, settled in
the Central State in the late forties.
This gentleman was identified with
the commercial life of the young
colony during the earlier years of
his residence there, but subse-
quently turned his attention to the
dairying industry, and during the
greater part of the quarter of a
century which he spent in the land

grazing and pastoral pursuits. He
died at Tintinara, South Australia,

The subject of this memoir, Mr. Wil-

education at the Glenelg Grammar
School, South Australia, and at the
close of his studies applied himself
to work on his father’s property.
Subsequent to the demise of the late
Mr. Harding, the family circle was
broken up, and turning his steps
far afield young Harding sought a
sphere for his energies and capa-
bilities in Western Australia. Not
successful in finding a goal suited to
his ambition in the Western State,
eventually he returned, and pro-
ceeding to New South Wales took
up a block of land in the Moree
district, which he developed on his
own account. For the following
twenty years Mr. Harding devoted
his attention to stock-raising, about

acreage upon which his operations
were carried out afforded. Accord-
ingly, selling out his interests in the
Mother State, he came to Queens-
land in the year 1907, and pur-
chasing a property near Roma known
as "Richmond Downs,” settled there,
and carried on successfully for three
years. An opportunity to sell at
a profit occurring, Mr. Harding
disposed of the holding and
shortly afterwards purchased "Dun-
gowan,” from Mr. D’arcy Win-
ten. “Dungowan” comprises about
40,000 acres, and has a carrying
capacity of about 10,000 sheep and
100 horses and cattle in average
seasons. Mr. Harding gave special
attention to the matter of water
conservation, and a copious flow of
water was obtained by the sinking
of three sub-artesian bores, situated
in different parts of the run, in
addition to which dams were ex-
cavated and a number of tanks

erected. Although Mr. Harding had
made his home in Toowoomba, he
and his eldest son, W. R. B.
Harding, spent a considerable
amount of their time in developing
the "Dungowan” property. A
homestead was built, and due
attention given to the erection of
outbuildings for the general pur-
poses of the station. In 1918 he
disposed of the property to Messrs.
Allen Bros., of “Allandale,” via
Morven. The following year, in
February, 1919, he purchased "Gib-
son Downs,” in the Leichhardt dis-
trict, a property comprising about
18,000 acres of good grazing country.
The principal industry is sheep
raising, and the flock totals about
6,000, besides which there are about
120 head of cattle and 80 horses.
The run is watered by springs and
wells, and in this department there
is an ample supply to meet all
requirements. Mr. Harding married
in 1887 Emily Alice, daughter of the
late Thomas Brown Baker, an old
and well-known personality in pas-
toral enterprise in South Australia.
Of the union there is a family of
three sons and seven daughters. The
eldest son, Mr. W. R. B. Harding,
enlisted in the Australian Imperial
Forces. He was on active service in
France, and met his death in action
at Bullecourt on May 3, 1917.


SAMUEL ERNEST YOUNG,
“Warilda,” Charleville, was born at
Germanton, Victoria, on October
22, 1878, and is the eldest son of
Mr. Samuel Young, who is now
living in retirement at Ryde,
Sydney, and whose career is referred
to in another portion of this work in
an article dealing with the life of
this worthy old pioneer’s second son,
Mr. W. H. Young, “Kahmoo,”
near Cunnamulla. The gentleman
under review received his education
by private tuition under the pat-
ernal roof tree. His knowledge of
pastoral matters was assimilated
from early childhood, and on enter-
ing his teens he began to assist in
the work connected with the old
homestead and its surrounding acres.
He remained with his father until
reaching man’s estate, when he
started work on his own responsi-
bility, by taking an extensive
droving trip, travelling with stock
from “Tilboroo” Station, South-
west Queensland, to South Australia.
His first personal venture in landed
interests occurred in the year 1899,
when, at the age of 21, he purchased
a small, highly improved property
near Pittsworth on the Darling
Downs. In 1901 he sold this pro-
position in order to take over the
management of “Waihora” Station,
for the late H. B. Coward, the
following nine years being occupied
these properties being then in the
hands of the same owner. In the
year 1910, he resigned the manage-
ment of these estates and selected
on his own behalf, a portion of

“Warilda” is situated at a distance
of about 45 miles north-west from
Charleville, and is connected with
that town by telephone. Mr. Young
has devoted considerable capital to
the development of this estate and
uses its well-grassed acres principally
for the breeding and pasturing of
sheep, although at times fair-sized
mobs of cattle are carried. The
convenience afforded by the railway,
which is within easy distance of
“Warilda,” renders great facilities
in the way of stock dealing, and in
consequence Mr. Young gives con-
siderable attention to this branch of
industry. Wool from “Warilda”
finds a ready sale and invariably
commands the highest market prices.
The property is one of the best
watered runs in the district, having
a six-mile frontage to the Langlo
River, a supply of which is largely
augmented by a copious flow from
two artesian bores. Mr. Young
takes an interest in all affairs of
importance connected with the
district, and during 1918 was
chairman of the local school board
and trustee of the North Park
bore. He is an advocate of sport
and accords his support to the
meetings held under the auspices of
the Charleville Picnic Race Club,
of which he is a member. He is also
a member of the Warrego Social
Club, Charleville. He married in
with the conduct of this estate,

four years of that period, was
administered in conjunction with

ERIC HERBERT EAST, "Max-
vale,” Charleville, was born at
Temora, New South Wales, on June
6, 1884. He is the second son of Mr.
George Thomas East, "Eastmount,”
MR. E. H. EAST.
Warwick, who hails from England,
his progenitors having followed
agrarian avocations in the Old
Land in the vicinity of the historic
town of Cambridge. The latter
gentleman was brought to Australia
by his parents at the early age of
two years, the family first settling
near Warrnambool, Victoria, in the
year 1854, later moving to the
Mount Rouse district, where the
founder of the race in Australia
followed farming pursuits. Mr.
George Thomas East, whose career is
set forth in page 360, Vol. 1., of this
work, has been identified with
various phases of industry connected
with the land, particularly those of
a pastoral character, having owned
many grazing properties. His pre-
sent areas include “Glen Vale,”
near Warwick, and “Kihee” Sta-
tion, a property comprising 204
square miles situated on the Cooper
River. The subject of our present
review, Mr. Eric Herbert East,
received the major part of his educa-
tion at Sampson’s High School,
Warwick, the academy now known
as the Warwick High School. He
completed his scholastic career at the
age of 18, and his father having
bestowed upon him a half interest in
a cattle property called “Marra-
Marra,” in the vicinity of Yeulba,
he took up his residence on the run,
p
which he administered for the fol-
lowing two years. At the termin-
ation of this period, desiring a larger
scope for his energies, and being
much disposed towards entering the
ranks of sheep-owners, he sold his
interest in “Marra-Marra,” and in
1906 purchased “Maxvale,” his pre-
sent holding. This estate is situated
about 12 miles from Charleville, on
the Ward River, to which it has a
frontage of about 9 miles. At the
time of Mr. East’s purchase “Max-
vale” was of limited acreage, but
since entering into possession he has
increased its extent by the acquire-
ment of adjoining properties, so that
it now consists of about 26,000 acres,
and is one of the most highly-
improved and snuggest little pro-
positions for its size in the district.
The improvements include two
artesian bores, which considerably
augment the natural supply afforded
by the Ward River, ample water for
the needs of the stock being pro-
vided from these sources. The estate
has a carrying capacity of about
10,000 sheep, although at the time
of writing, owing to the fact that
the district has experienced a par-
ticularly good season, the flocks
pastured at present number in the
aggregate about 14,000. In addition
to the work connected with the
sheep grazing on the home acres, Mr.
East bestows a good deal of atten-
tion to the dealing side of the
industry, the facilities afforded
through the convenient position of
“Maxvale” lending themselves to
this branch of the business. The

the owner of “Combanning,” in the
Charleville district, a sheep property
of considerable value. Mr. Eric

GORGE HERBERT LEOPOLD
TATE, “Wallal,” Charleville, was
born at Muswellbrook, New South
Wales, on August 16, 1879. He is
the eldest son of the late George
MR. G. TATE.
Tate, also a native of that State,
whose parents originally hailed
from Newcastle-on-Tyne, England,
having come to Australia soon after
the foundation of the Mother
Colony and being amongst the
earliest settlers there. The grand-
father of the gentleman under
nearly seventy years ago. “Tongy,”
“Murra-Murra, ’ ’ “Moorindoora, ’ ’
and “Yanko” Stations were owned by
them in the days when these places
were quite on the “Edge of Be-
yond,” and when most of the
ordinary comforts of civilization
were lacking. Both father and
grandfather of Mr. G. IT. L. Tate
closed their useful lives at “Murra-
Murra,” and the two graves there
serve as a humble mark of the brave
struggle in which they took so noble
a part in the making of our history
and the building of the Empire. At
the time Mr. G. H. L. Tate was
born this station was owned by the
late George Tate; and the name of
the family was largely used in all
the early Government maps of the
period—a proof of the important
part taken by them in the pioneer-
ing of the country. The subject of
our memoir pursued his scholastic
studies at the Ipswich Grammar
School subsequently taking a
special course at the Gatton College.
While at this institution he ob-
tained a thorough knowledge of
agriculture which has proved ex-
exceedingly useful in backing up
the practical handling of stock,
acquired in his early boyhood on
his father’s properties. At nineteen

the estate of his late father, and
retained the post of manager for
up and the estate divided among
the members of the family, Mr.
Tate purchased “Clifton Downs,” a
sheep and cattle property, situated
80 miles west of Bourke, New South


Wales, and for nearly five years
was engaged in the grazing industry
there. Near the termination of this
period he decided to sell this
proposition and settle in a district
which would provide greater scope
for pastoral development and at the
same time afford better opportun-
ities for the rearing and educating
of his young family. He purchased
“Wallal,” his present property, from
the Buchanan estate, in 1913, and
at once devoted himself whole-
heartedly to its improvement. He
has built an up-to-date home
possessing modern appliances and
conveniences, and in which is
combined comfort and art. Fruit,
shrub, and shade trees were planted,
and these have made rapid progress,
adding to the beauty of the home-
stead and its surroundings. The
garden is well laid out, the trellised
vines and flower beds adding a
pleasing touch to the general effect.
“Wallal” is situated about 14 miles
from Charleville, and comprises over
50,000 acres of black soil and open
mulga country, a large portion of
which is covered with the valuable
Mitchell and blue grasses. The
water from a large bore is distrib-
uted over the property through 30
miles of drains which are kept
constantly running, both summer
and winter. Tanks and dams have
also been constructed to supplement

New South Wales, this gentleman
having taken first prizes with
his red polled stock at the
Sydney Royal Show. The shorthorn
cows with which the bulls are used,
are specially picked animals, and it
is expected that good results will
attend this cross. The property
carries from about 150 to 200 head
of both Clydesdale and light
draught horses. At present Mr.
Tate is experimenting in the breed-
ing of a good type of gun horses for
the Army. He is a member of the
Farmers and Settlers’ Association,
devoting as much time as he can
spare from the duties connected
with his estate to the interests of
that society. He is a member of the
Warrego Racing Club and of the
Cunnamulla and Wyandra Picnic
Race Clubs. Mr. Tate married
in 1901, Jessie Catherine, second
daughter of the late Dr. Frank

designation, and the owner of a
property named “Samalaman,”
which was at one time famed as a
Roman Catholic College of note. By
means of existing records this gentle-
man’s descent may be traced in a
direct line to the famous Bruce, and
their name has been notable in
various eras of Scottish history, even
up to our own times. Mr. Donald
Mac Neill was educated at Ushaw
College, Durham, an academy dis-
tinguished as being one of the oldest
schools in England, and within
whose walls many of the ablest
public men in different parts of the
globe were initiated in the first step
towards their future life, and now
claim it as an honour to have been
among its students. He concluded
his collegiate studies at the age of
17, after matriculating for the
University of London; but instead
of completing his law course, as was
originally intended, he joined the
staff of the Clydesdale Bank, where
he remained for about two years.
About this time a restlessness, engen-
dered by a love of adventure, was
intensified by the fact that his uncle
—the late Donald Mac Lean —had
already settled and made good in a
new country. Therefore, following
this gentleman’s example, this scion
of an old Scottish family left the
Motherland when but little past
man’s estate, and sailed for the land
of the Southern Cross in the good
ship “Lochness” in October, 1878,

tices cheerfully shouldering their
duties until the sailors resumed work.
On arriving in Australia he immedi-

State, he was at length in a position
to attain the end for which he had
made so many sacrifices, his industry
and thrift being rewarded by the
acquirement of a grazing block on
the Flinders called "Gracedale,”
which he took up in partnership
with his brother-in-law, Mr. Thomas
Forster, in 1897. This connection
was mutually dissolved some nine
years later, Mr. Mac Neill disposing
of his interests to his partner. His
next venture was the purchase of his
present estate, "Millie,” from Mr.
G. W. Pitt, and the administration
of this area has fully occupied his
time ever since. "Millie” was origin-
ally part of the resumption of old
“Gowrie” Station, and has a frontage
of 10 miles to the Ward River. It
comprises about 40,000 acres of
loamy and red soil country, bearing
blue, Mitchell, and mulga grasses
principally, and capable of pasturing
in ordinary seasons about 14,000
sheep. The merino breed is favoured,
and Mr. Mac Neill is improving his
stock from time to time by the
introduction of rams from the
famous Wanganella stud, New South
Wales. The homestead is situated
on the Ward River, about 21 miles
from Charleville, and was built in
1911 to replace the older home,
which failed to suit the requirements
of the present owner. The new
residence is well abreast of the times,
climatic conditions and general com-
fort having been well considered at
its construction, and the result is a
bright, airy, and comfortable home.
Mr. Mac Neill is a member of the
Warrego Club, and identifies himself
with most of the public affairs of the
district, whether of a general, char-
itable, patriotic, or sporting nature.
He has been a member of the Mit-
chell Rabbit Board for some years,
and is a valued supporter of the
Charleville Picnic Race Club and
other local sporting institutions. He
married in 1892 Florence, eldest
daughter of Mr. Augustus Henry
Pegler, one of the old pioneer pas-
toralists of both Western Queensland
and South Australia, who was well
known and respected in the former
centre for many years, and is now
living in retirement in Sydney.
The last-named gentleman, who has
attained the ripe old age of 84, is
of English birth, and was brought
to South Australia by his parents
when four years of age. His family
consists of 12 children, and eight of
his sons are associated with the pas-
toral industry in Queensland and
Victoria. Mr. Pegler can look back
upon a life’s work well done, and
now in its “evening time” enjoy the
honour, esteem, and love of the
present generation. Mr. Donald
Mac Neill has a family of one son
and two daughters now living, his
eldest son, the late Lieutenant
Donald Mac Neill, having joined the
Great Majority at the age of 23. He
was a member of the Royal Flying
Corps, and gave his life in the
noblest of all causes—that of his
home and country—in the heyday
of youth at an age when life pro-
mises the brightest fulfilment. The

of New South Wales. The late
pioneer brought with him sufficient
capital to enable him to start opera-
tions in the grazing industry under
favourable auspices, and he became
the owner of several valuable proper-
ties. Later he revisited the land of
his birth, returning to the country
of his adoption, to resume his activi-
ties in connection with pastoral
enterprise. Subsequently he again
sailed for the British Isles, where he
remained for a time with the inten-
tion of spending the autumn of his
days in England, if the climate
should prove suitable to his health ;
but was seized with a sudden illness,
to which he succumbed, and his ashes
now rest with the bones of his fore-
fathers in the historic Motherland.
The gentleman under review, Mr.
John Walmsley, who was educated at
Newcastle, New South Wales, from
an early age was wont to give a
helping hand on the home property,
and, after the conclusion of his

studies, he co-operated with his
father in the building up of the pro-
position until he had passed his
majority. The late Mr. Walmsley
then presented each of his sons with
his portion to enable him to make
a start in life on his own account,
and the younger soon found his
opening by taking up some blocks of
Crown land in the Hunter district,
to the development of which he ap-
plied himself with much energy.
After working these blocks with suc-
cess for some years, he sold out at a
profit, and, removing to the Moree
district of New South Wales, estab-
lished himself on a solid basis among
the pastoralists of that portion of the
mother State. Mr. Walmsley con-
tinued there for nearly twenty years,
his property, “Melvin Park,”
embracing two adjoining estates,
known as “Broadmeadows and
“Bingerang,” which he purchased to
enlarge the original holding, as he
began to require further scope for

disposed of before taking up his resi-

was prompted to take the step of
breaking up his New South Wales
home by the consideration that in

the less settled northern country
would be found wider scope for the
family of three sons and three
daughters growing up around him.
Selling all his estate, in 1909 he
resided in retirement at Sherwood,
near Brisbane, for a time. Being still
in the prime of life, however, he was
not long content to be out of partici-
pation in pastoral enterprise, and,
attended the new venture, Mr.
Walmsley considered the prospects
sufficiently good to warrant him in an
extension of his interests, and, about
the close of 1913—unfortunately for

considerable period in the inspection
of properties then on the market,

within a short time, once more
directed his attention to the serious
matter of securing a property to suit
his purposes. The acquisition of
“Spring Valley” Station, near
Hughenden, North Queensland,
brought him again into the ranks
of active pastoralists, and, having
completed the purchase and sketched
out plans for its administration, he
placed the management in the hands
him, at the beginning of a disastrous
drought—he purchased “Maryvale”
Station, an old historic property
situated near Morven, with the ad-
joining “Boxvale” acres, comprising
in all about 180 square miles, to the
administration of which he devoted
the whole of his attention, being
assisted by his three sons. The
“Maryvale” country is generally

very satisfactory results. The stallion

much merit. “Thunderbolt” secured
several championship honours at
Taroom, Hughenden, Townsville,
and Roma, against competitors from
the best studs in Queensland, demon-
strating that —his colour being a
skewbald —the old saying that “a
good horse is never of a bad colour”
has no substance in fact. The brown
filly “Platypus,” reproduced in these
pages (by “Ladur Boy” from “Per-
sian Queen”), is an animal of con-
siderable promise, and already has
scored successes at local meetings.
The “Maryvale” property is watered
principally by dams, tanks, and sub-
artesian bores, in addition to the
natural sources of supply, consisting
of three good-sized creeks, wherein
are found several waterholes, which
only on rare occasions have been
known to run dry. It is fenced with
six wires round the boundary, which

proof netting, and subdivision has

varying dimensions, suitable to the
handling of the stock. There are two
homesteads in close proximity, and,
although one is of an earlier period
than the other, both are up-to-
date and very comfortable. The
woolshed, which lies some fifteen
miles distant from the homestead, in
a convenient situation near to the
centre of the run, has accommoda-
tion for sixteen stands, fitted with
Moffat-Virtue machines, the driving
power being derived from a Clayton
and Shuttleworth steam engine.
Water is laid on from a sub-artesian
bore, and in this connection it may
be stated that the plant includes a
boring outfit, capable of sinking
from 1,000 to 1,500 ft. Mr. Walms-
ley sold “Maryvale” in 1918 and
lived in semi-retirement at “Mal-
vern,” Sherwood, Brisbane, until
the latter part of 1919, when he pur-
chased “Arabella” Station from the
North British Australasian Com-
pany, Ltd. The property is situated
about 14 miles east of Charleville
and has an area of 1001 square miles.
The purchase included all the work-
ing plant and stock, the latter num-
bering 15,000 head of also a
number of cattle and horses. The
run is regarded as one of the best
in the district and has the advantage
of a railway siding, where com-
modious trucking yards have been
erected, the latter being owned bv

The last-named gentleman was
a French scholar and physician
of close on a century ago, who, com-
ing from Paris to Australia in the
early days of the Colony, was given
a grant of land in the Hunter dis-
trict of New South Wales, and, in
addition to his pastoral interests,
practised his profession in Sydney
for some considerable time. He had
a family of two sons and two daugh-
ters, of whom Mrs. Walmsley’s
mother was the youngest; while the
youngest son, Frank Parmeter, made
his name in early exploration under
the Southern Cross, and gave his
life to the cause, being speared by
the blacks in Northern Australia. Of
the surviving family of three sons and
three daughters born to Mr. and Mrs.
Walmsley, the former assist their
father in the administration of the
property, the eldest sen, Reginald
Frederick, and the second, John
Fenton, also owning pastoral inter-
ests on their own account in the
district. Reginald—who was edu-
cated by private tuition at his old
home in New South Wales—enlisted
for military service in August, 1916,
but, owing to illness, was compelled
to relinquish the honour of personal
service for the time being. In 1917
he again came forward, but illness
and a second operation once more
prevented him going into camp.
Early in 1918 he went into camp
and shortly afterwards left with the
A.I.F. for England, proceeding
thence to France, where he was
attached to the Australian Artillery
Brigade. The second son, John
Fenton, received his education at the
Toowoomba Grammar School. He
volunteered for active service and
passed the medical test at Charle-
ville on October 14, 1918; but the
suspension of hostilities in the fol-
lowing month prevented him from
proceeding to the scene of action.
The youngest son, James Thomas, at-
tended primarily the Brisbane
Grammar School, later becoming a
student at the Ipswich Grammar
School. On May 13, 1918, he
offered his services in defence of the
Empire and went into camp, shortly
afterwards sailing with the A.I.F.
On arrival in England he was
attached to the reinforcements of the
9th Infantry Battalion, subsequently
leaving for France. The three daugh-
ters are Miss Violet Mary Elizabeth
Walmsley, Miss Ivy Annie Walms-
ley, and Miss Clara May Walmsley.

Alexander Duncan McDonald, who,
with his father, the late Dun-
can McDonald came to Australia
in September, 1857. The latter
gentleman settled with his family in

the western district of Victoria,
having originally hailed from
Argyleshire, where from time imme-
morial this particular clan of the
McDonalds had followed grazing
avocations, though in common with
many of these families of the old
land, agrarian pursuits were carried
on to a lesser extent. The maternal
grandfather of the gentleman under
review, Kenneth Murchison, who
retired from pastoral pursuits in 1910
to Geelong, Victoria, where he now
lives, hailed from the Isle of Skye and
arrived in Australia about the same
time, settling in proximity to the
McDonald family in Victoria. The
progenitors of both these families
were noted for their war-like dis-
positions in the old days of clan rule
in Scotland; and the names and
deeds of each are perpetuated in the
histories of those primitive times.
The founders of the two families in
Australia at once became identified
with the grazing industry in
Victoria, and many of their descend-
ants are still prominent in grazing
and pastoral pursuits both in that
State and in New South Wales. The
late Alexander Duncan McDonald
was the youngest son of the head of
the family in Australia having been
bred on the land, and thus acquiring
a knowledge of pastoral matters from
early boyhood. At the age of 40 he
left Victoria and purchased a pro-
perty in the Mother State in the
vicinity of Temora. For 10 years he
was occupied with the working of
this estate, at the same time taking
an active part in many of the public
questions connected with the land.
It is worthy of mention, as an
historical incident, that he was one
of the original members of the
executive committee of the Farmers
and Settlers’ Association of New
South Wales, and was with that com-
mittee practically responsible for its
foundation. In the year 1900 he came
to Queensland with his family with
the view of purchasing land, and in
the meantime, while awaiting a suit-
able opportunity, was associated with
different industries in this State.
Later he settled on the Darling
Downs, near Pittsworth, for a brief
period, subsequently going into
retirement owing to the delicate
state of health, which eventually
caused his death on April 1, 1902.
The late Mr. McDonald was a much
respected citizen of the land of his
own and his father’s adoption, and
his family of three sons have in both
their immediate ancestors a fine
example of the sterling qualities
which characterized so many of our
country’s pioneers. The eldest son
has adopted a commercial career in
Sydney and the two younger have
followed the calling of their forbears,
the elder of these being the subject
of our memoir. Mr. Duncan Camp-
bell McDonald was educated in
Victoria, and completed his scholastic

course when just entering upon
his teens. At this time he came to
New South Wales, and going on the

in the year 1900 —a period covering
about a decade. For several years
following he was engaged in various
kinds of work, both of a commercial
and pastoral nature, coming to


Cliarleville in 1904, where he
accepted a post in the firm of Fitz-
walter & Company in their general
agency department, and carried out
his duties in this connection for
about three years. Subsequently he
turned his attention to the hotel
business, and having married about
this time this event, coupled with
the fact that his wife’s people were
associated with that trade, resulted
in his also taking a share in it, and
as a consequence he personally con-
ducted the Hotel Norman for about
seven years. During his activities
in this direction he launched out in
the purchase of a pastoral property
near Charleville called “Vera Park,”
is nevertheless a generally well-
developed property. Mr. McDonald
has built a comfortable home on the
site of the old homestead, which is
situated about 24 miles from Charle-
ville and twp miles from Wallal,
which is the nearest railway station.
“Tooloon,” which is devoted to
sheep breeding, receives its water
from an artesian bore, and the
owner is giving much attention to
additional improvements on the
estate. Since his advent to Charle-
ville Mr. McDonald has evinced an
interest in the welfare of the district,
and later, when conducting business
on his own account, held office in the
various bodies instituted for its
co-operation. He is a close student of
political economy, and was a candi-
date for the Warrego seat in the
Liberal interests, his opponent being
the present Minister for Railways,
the Hon. J. IT. Coyne. During the
Denham Administration he was
created a Justice of the Peace,
All movements having for their
object the advancement of the
community receive his cordial sup-
port, and in particular he evinces a
warm interest in shows held in the
district and in sporting matters,
being on the committee of most of
the bodies controlling these func-
tions. He married in January,
1908, Catherine, youngest daughter
in the year 1911, and supervised and
managed this place while still
occupied with his business in the
town. He disposed of the lease of
Hotel Norman on August 1, 1914,
and at the same time sold “Vera
Park,” having decided to retire from
business. However, the desire to
settle in the locality where he had
made so many friends in the past
and where his wife’s people were so
well and favourably known caused
him to make another essay into
the pastoral side of life. The
result was the purchase of “Too-
loon” in 1915, which, though not
a large place—indeed, not nearly
big enough for its purposes —

in the early part of his sojourn in
the municipality, and for the three
years of 1912-13-14 occupied the
mayoral chair. He relinquished
municipal honours on his retirement
from Charleville. At the present
time he is on the executive of the
Warrego Graziers’ Association and
also of the Queensland Grazing
Farmers and Settlers’ Association.
He has rendered invaluable service
in connection with the Charleville
Hospital, and was vice-president
of that institution for a number
of years; in fact, everything of

identity is revered for his own
sterling qualities and the good works
which he accomplished in the dis-
trict, which live as a monument to
the name of Dalton — a name that
in Ireland also is identified with
everything that is honourable and

is interesting to note that the Arm-
strong family are among the most
famous in Scottish border history,
the name occurring in many of the
records of historical events, whilst
it also appears in innumerable
legends and ballads. The late John
MacVean was one of six brothers
who came to Victoria from
Caledonia, in the year 1840 to
make a start in a new country. One
of these brothers was a doctor of
medicine, another a minister of the
Presbyterian Church at Brunswick,
near Melbourne, for close on 40
years, and the remaining four were
among the very earliest pastoralists
to take up land in Victoria. Mr.
John MacVean married a daughter
of the late John Armstrong, a
pioneer of the pioneers, whose
interests lay in the Geelong District.
With his name are associated many
of the early inventions and improve-
ments in connection with pastoral
enterprise in its initial stages
under the Southern Cross, and he is
especially remembered as the in-
ventor of the sheep-drafting gate,
which is in use on practically every
sheep station throughout the Com-
monwealth. To Mr. and Mrs.
MacVean was born a family of 12
children, of whom three sons and
two daughters survive. An elder
brother of the gentleman under
review is a prominent pastoralist of
New South Wales; another, whose
photograph is here reproduced, was
engaged in commercial pursuits in
Victoria when the Great War,
which burst upon the world in
August, 1914, involving all the
Great Powers in a deadly struggle.
The pressing need of his country
appealed to him so strongly that,
although then forty years of age,
he immediately displayed the utmost
patriotism and was among the first
of that State to volunteer for active
service. It is to such men that the
nation owes its foremost position in
the world. Pie was successful in
gaining an entrance into the Aus-
tralian Imperial Forces, and after
passing through a strenuous period
of training made himself fully fit,
and eventually, going overseas, was
at the front fighting the enemies
of his country on the soil of
France. The remaining son, Mr.
William Armstrong MacVean,
received his education at Toorak
College, Melbourne, with a finishing
course at the famous Scotch College
of that city. Concluding his scho-
lastic career when 17 years of age, he
proceeded to his father’s station,
“Mooloomoon,” near Deniliquin, New
South Wales, where he obtained an
excellent grounding in all the essen-
tials required to fit him for the posi-
tion of a pastoral manager. Subse-
quently he was associated with his
elder brother, Mr. John MacVean, in

Queensland on a special mission, his
errand being to advise the Squatting

tion of rabbits. After spending six

months on “Thurulgoona” dealing
with the rabbit pest, he returned to
New South Wales and took over
the management of “Benermbah”


Station, near Hay, on behalf of the
Bailey estate. From there he went
to “Billilla,” near Wilcannia, which
pastoral proposition he conducted
for a year for the firm of Messrs.
Chirnside & Weatherly. About the
end of 1898 he was offered and
accepted the management of “Thur-
ulgoona” in the interests of the
Squatting Investment Company, and
held this post with most excel-
lent results for 11 years. His success
in this sphere brought him under the
notice of Messrs. Ramsay Brothers,
the well-known pastoralists, who
offered him the general supervision
of their properties in Northern
Station, which until within a few
years back was owned by the mater-
nal uncles of Mr. MacVean. It has
an area of 50,000 acres of mulga,
box, and coolibah flats, with wide
stretches of gidya, and some spinifex
country, and is situated 14 miles dis-
tant from Offham Railway Station,
about halfway between the towns of
Charleville and Cunnamulla. Until
recently sheep were run on the
pastures, but Mr. MacVean has
instituted a new order of things, and
the property is now used solely for
cattle grazing, for which it has
proved highly suitable. It is rapidly
attaining to an advanced degree of
considerable time in Queensland,
where he was engaged in the pastoral
industry under the supervision of
Mr. MacVean, both in the northern
parts of the State and at“Ardgour.”
Mr. MacVean interests himself in
the well-being of the neighbourhood
where he resides, and was appointed
a Justice of the Peace by the Dickson
Cabinet in 1899. He indulges in
various forms of recreation, includ-
ing lawn tennis and shooting, being
a particularly good wing shot and a
doughty opponent on the tennis
court. He married in 1893, Florence
Mary, daughter of the late Edward
Dawes, who was one of Tasmania’s
Queensland, and in the carrying out
of the duties of this appointment he
accounted for a further three years.
Mr. MacVean in 1912 came to Bris-
bane, where he associated himself
with the commercial side of the
pastoral industry for a while,
eventually during the ensuing year
purchasing, with Mr. W. H. Carter,
“Coleraine,” a sheepstation near
Richmond, North Queensland, and
his present “Ardgour” Station, to
the administration of which he has
devoted his energies ever since,

development under the skilled
management of the present owner,
whose action in putting down an
artesian bore gave the culminating
touch to the improvement work
necessary to bring it into the front
rank of pastoral properties in this
neighbourhood. From this bore,
which has a. depth of 1,800 feet,
issues a flow of 1,200,000 gallons of
water per day, running through 20
miles of well-constructed bore drains
and serving a big tract of country
with excellent water. An interest
in the property is held by Captain
J. N. Beasley, now (1918) on active
service, who formerly spent a

Vean’s grandfather was the first
barrister to practise his profession in
Tasmania. Dawes Point, Sydney,
was named after Lieutenant Dawes,
who was her father’s uncle. Mrs.
MacVean’s grandmother was a
daughter of Lieut.-Colonel Lord, who
married a daughter of Sir John Owen,
a well-known Englishman. The other
members of the familv were either
bishops, doctors, or naval men.
Several members of the Dawes
family have held official positions
under the British Crown, dating as
far back as the inception of Govern-
merit under the Southern Cross.


EDWARD BIRDS ALL, “Nem-
unmulla,” Offliam Siding, western
railway line, is a native of Lextor,
Victoria, where he was born on April
4, 1856, his father, the late George
MR. E. S. BIRDSALL.
Birdsall, being one of the best known
of early Victorian identities. The
latter gentleman originally came
from Yorkshire, England, where as a
young man his adventurous spirit
was fired by accounts of the romantic
life of the “Colonies,” as Britain’s
overseas dependencies were generally
termed, and he determined to seek
his fortune in the land of the
Southern Cross. In this project he
ran counter to the wishes of his rela-
tives in Yorkshire, who were engaged
in a good way in commercial pur-
suits, being connected with the leather
and book-binding trade. Over-ruling
all objections, however, the late Mr.
Birdsall carried his point, and after
his arrival in Australia in 1850 he
became connected with the carrying
trade on the route between Mel-
bourne and the Bendigo gold dig-
gings, the rates charged at this
period being £lOO per ton. Subse-
quently he turned bis attention to
hotel-keeping, constructing a build-
ing and carting it 70 miles to
Lamplough, where a rush had set in.
In the character of “mine host”
George Birdsall became a familiar
figure on the various gold fields, and
there were few even of the many
“devil-may-care” spirits of the
period who had not a good word for
the genial hotelkeeper, whose open-
hearted generosity and charitableness
gained for him an enviable repu-
tation among his fellows. The gentle-
man under review, who was the only
son of the late George Birdsall,
received the rudiments of education
at Lexton and Bendigo, leaving his
school days behind him at the time
of his father’s death. Mr. Edward
Birdsall’s first business position was
in Messrs. Gibson & Stewart’s boot
warehouse in Bendigo, where he re-
mained for three years. During this
time a growing spirit of restlessness
at length prevailed evermore pruden-
tial considerations, and, eventually
abandoning commercial life, he
joined forces with a cogenial spirit,
Mr. Tom Bailes, now of Victoria,
and shouldered his swag for a tramp

over the country. Mr. Birdsall
refers with the warmest affection to
this friend of his earlier years, who
won his admiration by the generosity
and bigness of his character, and
helped him along the earlier stages
of their nomadic journey like a
brother. When, new to the hard-
ships and “roughing it” which
formed part of the experience, the
lad, so lately from his books, suffered
from sore feet, aching limbs, and
mental depression he received unfail-
ing encouragement and cheer from
“old Tom Bailes,” the memory of
which is ever-green in his mind.
Tom Bailes frequently carried his
companion’s swag as well as his
own, and in all ways in his
power smoothed down the rough
introduction to bush life which taxed
the other’s powers of endurance to
the utmost. The travellers eventually
arrived at Hay, in New South
Wales, and, accepting the offer of
a droving job, they were able to keep
together making a safe delivery
of their flock of sheep at Parkes,
whence they footed it down the
Bogan to Bourke. Here, owing to
the scarcity of work, the two mates
had to separate, and Mr. Birdsall
made one of a droving party taking
stock from Bourke to Paroo. He
first crossed the Warrego in 1875,
thus making his earliest acquaint-
ance with Queensland while yet in
his teens, and for several years
followed various kinds of station
work in the northern part of New
South Wales and on the Queensland
border. In 1878, in partnership
with Mr. J. Anderson, he opened
a store at Barringun, on the border,
which then was known under the
uninviting name of “Stinking Lag-
oons.” This business, however,
proving a failure he obtained em-
ployment in a Government survey
party, engaged in defining the boun-
dary lines between New South Wales
and Queensland, and in this connec-
tion he assisted in surveying the line
west to the South Australian border,
his knowledge of bushcraft proving

very useful, and calling forth
comments of appreciation from the
leader of the party. Upon the
completion of this work he visited
Victoria, spending a little while


among the scenes of his earlier days,
and thence going to Albury, from
which centre, in 1884, he returned
to Queensland. Rejoining his former
partner, Mr. Anderson, he opened
CATTLE ON “NEMUNMULLA.”
an hotel in Cunnamulla, on the site
now occupied by the leading hostelry
in the town, of which it was the
forerunner. This was known as the
“Club Hotel,” but again the fates
were unfavourable to the venture,
and after discharging all the just
debts of the firm the two partners
severed their connection. After a
period of vicissitudes, in 1893 Mr.
Birdsall took over the lease of
Tattersall’s Hotel, Cunnamulla, and
for nearly 18 years filled the role of
genial host, making himself “hail
fellow well met” with all and sundry
whose life and lot, like his own, were
cast in the far west, and where each
man was responsible for his own
rank among his fellows. Whilst still
engaged in hotelkeeping Mr. Birdsall
took up a block of grazing country,
about 20,000 acres in extent, on a
locality nearly half-way between
Charleville and Cunnamulla, this
being a portion of the resumed area
of old “Bando” Station. In 1912,
relinquishing business pursuits, he
devoted his attention solely to his
pastoral interests, and settling down
at “Nemunmulla” has spent the
remainder of his life in the adminis-
tration of his estate. “Nemunmulla”
has a four-mile frontage to the
Warrego River, and although not of
extended acreage is one of the
snuggest little grazing blocks on the
banks of the stream. The homestead,
built by Mr. Birdsall from timber
grown on the land, is of the most
modern type, and with its surround-
ing garden and fruit orchard leaves
little to be desired in the way of
attractiveness and general home-
liness. On the pastures graze sheep
of pure merino type, and it must be
recorded that at the 1917 shearing
the clip averaged 10 lb. 10 oz. for
grown sheep, and the wool 13s. 3|d.
per fleece, while the average for
lambs was 3 lb. 13J oz., the wool
selling at 3s. 6|d. per head. During
Mr. Birdsall’s proprietorship of
Tattersall’s Hotel at Cunnamulla,
and later, while engaged in the
administration of his estate —a per-
iod covering nearly a quarter of a
century —he has been prominently
associated with all public affairs.
For over twenty-three years he has
been a member of the Paroo Shire
Council and has occupied the chair,
is one of the founders of the South
Warrego Hospital, and a member of
the committees of the local school
of arts, and library. Besides having
been for years a member of the
committees connected with these
institutions he is an enthusiastic
promoter and supporter of all the
more recent philanthropic and pat-
riotic movements which exist locally.
On more than one occasion Mr. Bird-
sail has been approached with a view
to his acceptance of a candidature
for the Legislative Assembly, in
the Liberal interests; but though
eminently suitable for this honour,
he has hitherto declined it, as the
duties connected with the adminis-
tering of his estate and other local
matters have claimed his time and
attention to the full. As an
influential representative of the
district he has frequently been in
attendance at the local authorities
conferences at Brisbane, where the
opinions of this enterprising and
successful grazier have carried
weight. Mr. Birdsall is also a dis-
tinguished member of the Warrego
Masonic Lodge, Scottish Constitu-
tion, and has filled the office of
master to that body —a tribute to
the integrity and uprightness of his
character. Numerous trophies testify
to his success in breeding useful
blood horses and to their perform-
ances on the turf, particularly at
Cunnamulla, and the keen interest
he takes in this sport is also apparent
in the fact that he has at various
times occupied the position of
president and vice-president and
filled other offices of the South
Warrego Race Club. He married
in 1886 Elizabeth Blanche, daughter
of Mr. Charles Spencer, of Therfield,
Hertfordshire, one of a well-known
family who followed agrarian pur-
suits in the motherland. Of the
union there are living two sons and
three daughters. Mr. Birdsall is
ably assisted by the former in the
administration of “Nemunmulla,”
and honourable mention should be
here made of the fact that both sons
responded to the country’s call by

but owing to physical disabilities

born at Ballarat, Victoria, on
December 31, 1862, and is a son of
the late James Denny Rankin, who
MR. J. D. RANKIN.
came originally in 1852 from Scot-
land, where for many generations
the name has been one of note in
Argyleshire. The late Mr. Rankin,
was a highly-respected member of
the commercial community, and
a member of the firm of McCallum,
Neill, & Co., of Flinders Lane,
Melbourne, and was part-owner
of “Restdown” Station, in the
Rochester District of Victoria. He
was one of the commissioners of the
first Civil Service Commission of that
State, and also was a member of
the Melbourne Club. He married
Miss Mackay, youngest daughter of
Mr. John Mackay, Superintendent
of Police, Fort William, Scotland,
who was descended from a family
of repute in Scotland, and had
seven sons and two daughters,
of whom the. subject of this
notice is the eldest. James
Denny Rankin died at “Jerilderie,”
near Deniliquin, New South Wales,
in 1896, his removal being a distinct
loss to the country of his adoption.
Mr. W. D. Rankin received his
education principally under private
tuition, with a finishing course at
the “Hofwyl Academy,” St. Kilda,
Victoria. Upon leaving school he
took a position as jackaroo on “Goo-
nambil” Station, New South Wales,
where he remained for ten years,
during which period he obtained a
very thorough grounding in all the
details of stock-raising, the breeding
of horses, cattle, and sheep being
carried on at that station on scientific
lines. During the latter portion of
his time on “Goonambil” Mr. Rankin
fdled the post of overseer, under the
supervision of his cousin, Mr. Dun-
can Rankin, one of the best-known
administrators in the pastoral in-
dustry of that period. Subsequently
in the early nineties he joined
in partnership with Mr. William
Wilson, a son of the owner of
“Goonambil,” and took up pastoral
country on the Warrego River, com-
bining with the working of this
holding the management of “Multa-
goona” Station, a property owned by
Mr. Wilson, senior, and Mr. Murray
Jones. The country on the Warrego

setting in, and the young pastoralists
were forced to throw up their
venture. As a result, within three
years of his advent to Queensland
Mr. Rankin returned to New South
Wales and took over the control of
affairs on “Kildary” Station, on the
Merool Creek, which post he retained
for seven years. At the close of
this period he again turned his steps
towards the north, and for some
time had charge of “WAggonorah”
Station, then owned by the Austra-
lasian Mortgage and Agency Com-
pany, the management of which
he retained until the property was
sold. In 1903 Mr. Rankin purchased
his present holding, “Baroona,”
which has since been added to until
it now covers some 100,000 acres.
This country originally was taken up
by the Hon. Jas. Tyson, and was
used as an outstation of “Tinnen-
burra,” subsequently being taken up
by the Rossiters. It lies in the
vicinity of Cunnamulla, and has the
advantage of about 15 miles front-
age to the Warrego River, with its
numerous permanent waterholes.
The country is undulating in charac-
ter, consisting mostly of open gidya
stretches, with box flats, and a
considerable tract of mulga on the
back portion of the run. Mitchell
and Flinders grasses flourish abun-
dantly with other native grasses, and
these give place to a quantity of
succulent herbage as the season
comes round. A certain amount of
development work had been begun
by the previous owners, and this
has been vigorously prosecuted by
Mr. Rankin, who has erected many
miles of rabbit- and dog-proof
fencing, and has given considerable
attention to the construction of
tanks and bore drains —nearly 50
miles of the latter intersecting the
paddocks, which are served by one
of the largest bores in South-western
Queensland. In average seasons the
run has a carrying capacity of about
20,000 sheep, in addition to horses
and cattle, but since a season of
drought which occurred recently the
country has not been fully stocked
up, although the numbers are being
gradually replenished. The present

flock consists of merinos, but the
district is considered equally suitable
for sheep of the crossbred type. The
original homestead, which still serves
as a dwelling-house, was built in
the early seventies, and is a rambling


one-storied structure, of picturesque
appearance, standing on the right-
hand bank of the Warrego, some 15
miles distant from Cunnamulla.

Charles James Nantes, one of the
earliest Victorian settlers, and among
the first to introduce sheep into
that State from Tasmania. It is
recorded that on one of his trips,
LANCE-CORP. C. J. NANTES.
whilst crossing the sea with sheep
in a ketch, he was caught in a gale
and wrecked on the coast of
Kangaroo Island, the only survivors
being the captain of the craft
and himself. This disaster, however,
did not deter him from persevering
with his enterprise, and having
made a success of the sheep in-
dustry he extended the scope of
his operations, and establishing
himself in general storekeeping in a
large way became one of Geelong’s
most progressive commercial men.
He also filled the office of trustee of
the first railway venture in Victoria
under the Hobson Bay Company,
and in addition to his other
interests was a large speculator,
at the time of his death in
the late seventies being one of
the best-known men in Victoria.
The late Mr. Nantes had a family
of 12 children, two sons and eight
daughters surviving him. The elder
of the sons, another Charles James
Nantes, has settled in New Zealand,
where he is a familiar figure in
shipping circles. The subject of this
memoir received his education in
Dunedin, New Zealand, and upon
the completion of his scholastic
studies, obtained a position in the
office of the British and New
Zealand Mortgage and Agency
Company in that city, where he
acquired a good general knowledge
of the theoretical side of the land
and pastoral business. After three
years spent in this connection, he
left office work behind him, and
went as station cadet—the New
Zealand term for jackaroo—to
“Mount Pisa” Station, subsequently
transferring his services to an
adjoining property. During the five
years of his residence on these
properties Mr. Nantes became
thoroughly conversant with the
practical part of station enterprise,
and at the age of 22, returning
to the land of his birth, he took
a post on “Rainworth,” near
Springsure, Queensland, the pro-
perty of his brother-in-law, the late
F. H. B. Turner, a well-known
pastoralist and manager in Central
Queensland for the big firm of
Dalgety & Co., Ltd. Here he acted
as sheep overseer for two years, and
for the decade following this period
was engaged in general work in
connection with the management
and handling of stock. A good deal
of droving was undertaken by Mr.
Nantes, who placed his services at
the disposal of stockowners desiring
to develop new runs in the interior.
Disregarding the obstacles and
hardships attendant upon this class
of work, especially through periods
of drought, he accomplished an
immense amount in the way of
opening up fresh country, the
results of his activities being found
over half the State. During the
severe drought of 1902-3, he

founded for the Weinholt Estate the

lishing them in safety upon the new
territory. At a later date he took

over the management of “Rain-
worth” Station, which, in the
interim, had been purchased by
Dalgety & Co., Ltd., and continued
to administer affairs on this property


for seven years. At the termination
of this period, "Rainworth” again
changed hands, and Mr. Nantes
removed to “Beechall” Station, near
Wyandra, where he took over the
reins of control. At a later date he
acquired a partnership in this
station, and, in the role of man-
aging partner, continued to conduct
its operations for a further three
years. Relinquishing his interest
in "Beechall”, he consented, during
the 1914-1916 drought, to devote
his energies on behalf of Dalgety
& Co., Ltd., to directing the affairs of
several of the pastoral properties in
improvements. Fences were erected,
and subdivision into paddocks of
convenient size completed, advan-
tage being taken of the rabbit-proof
netting already in use by neigh-
bouring station-holders; and, within
a short space of time, the new
property was placed in a position to
rank equally with others of its kind
in the district. “Kynnersley,” as the
Messrs. Nantes’ holding was named,
consists of 35,000 acres of country,
with a four-mile frontage to the
Warrego River. It is timbered with
coolibah, gidya, and patches of
pines, while on the back part of the
Springsure district, Mr. Nantes has
always cordially interested himself
in affairs of local importance, and
has held prominent offices in various
organizations. In racing circles he
is well known, and has had
considerable success in this form of
sport, trophies now at “Kynners-
ley,” testifying to the merits of
performers placed by him on the
courses. In his younger days he
was very keen in athletics, and took
a prominent part in football in New
Zealand. He married in 1897 Lilian
Maude, daughter of Mr. Joseph Lun-
non Uenne, formerly of Springsure,
which the great firm was interested.
Towards the close of this time of
stress, the opportunity of a venture
on his own account once more
presented itself, and in conjunction
with his two sons, Mr. Nantes took
up some blocks of country on the
“Murweh” Station resumption area,
and immediately proceeded to
develop these on progressive lines,
Almost his earliest procedure was
to erect a good, modern homestead,

therein, the three partners set to

It has good carrying capacity, being
well-grassed with Mitchell, Flinders

numerous other varieties, besides
which it is considered one of the
best areas of herbage country on the
Warrego. The flock is pure merino,
built up from the famous “Wangan-
ella” types, and, though not yet
numerically strong, is rapidly
increasing in size. A small herd of
cattle is also grazed on the pastures.

Charles Joseph, enlisted in the Aus-
tralian Imperial Forces, and left for
Egypt in June, 1918, holding rank
as corporal in the Light Horse.
Possessing an expert knowledge of
mechanics, particularly as regards
the “Ford” motor-car, on arrival he
was transferred to the Army Service
Corps, and has since been connected

MR. SAMUEL YOUNG
South Wales, on April 25, 1882, and
is the second son of the late Samuel
Young, the then owner of the sta-
tion, who is now living in retirement
“gentlemen farmers,” and held
prestige as one of the prominent
families of County Tyrone, in which
part of the country they had been
settled for many generations. Upon
his arrival in Australia he took a
position as jackaroo on “Mahonga”
Station, the property of the late
well-known Robert Rand, a blood
relative of Mr. Young. Subse-
quently, after many years of varied
experience in the pastoral industry,
with which he has been connected
ever since his advent to Australia,
he became the possessor of a block
of land on his own account in the
Bourke District of New South Wales,
which he held for some years, even-
tually disposing of it to purchase
“Bobadeen.” The adverse conditions
under which so many Australian
pioneers had to carry on their
pastoral work, however, proved too
difficult to allow him to persevere
in his undertaking, and he was com-
pelled to part with “Bobadeen,”
following which he made his advent
to Queensland in 1891. His earliest
selection of country was on the
Tinenburra resumption area, which
holding he administered successfully
until 1908, when he retired from

writing both of the sons being
engaged in pastoral pursuits in
Queensland. The subject of this
memoir, Mr. William Henry Young,
received his education at the Bris-
bane Boys’ Grammar School, and
upon the completion of his scholastic
career he took over the administra-
tion of his father’s property under
the general supervision of the older
man, thus gaining a valuable train-
ing in the life-calling which he had
elected to follow. When upon the
retirement of Mr. Young, senior,
the two brothers came into possession
of the paternal estate, the gentleman
under review continued to hold his
share until 1911, when he disposed
of it for the purpose of purchasing
his present property, “Kahmoo,”
together with a second holding,
“Woggonora” (which has since
passed into other hands) from the
executors of the late Robert Brown.
The “Kahmoo” country consists
principally of open plains, well
covered with Mitchell and Flinders
grasses, and interspersed by belts of
edible scrub, herbage also flourish-
ing in great abundance during the
proper season. At the time of its
purchase by Mr. Young a consider-
able amount of improvement work
already had been completed, and
the combined pastures carried 24,000
sheep and 400 head of cattle. Mr.
Young, however, strongly imbued
with modern ideas, determined
forthwith to launch out on a scheme
of more intense and scientific de-
velopment, and upon his “Kahmoo”
run alone, which at the present
time comprises about 80,000 acres,
grazes a flock of some 15,000 sheep
and from 200 to 300 head of cattle.
Some 60,000 acres of the property
are enclosed with rabbit- and dog-
proof fencing, about 65 miles of this
class of fencing having been com-
pleted; whilst there are in addition
close on 60 miles of subdivisional
fences, forming 20 paddocks for
the convenience of handling the
stock. Among the most notable of
the improvements is a bore in the
vicinity of the homestead, from
which water is laid on in all direc-
tions required. Besides this bore,
with which are connected 30 miles
of drains, the station has the
advantage of utilizing the water of
another artesian flow, which has been
put down on an adjoining property
and supplies ten miles of drains on
“Kahmoo.” A fine woolshed con-
tains fourteen stands of Wolseley
machinery, the driving power for
which is provided by an 8-10 Lister
engine, whilst an up-to-date wool-
scour also testifies to Mr. Young’s
progessive methods in the pursuance
of his enterprise. The homestead—
standing somewhere about the centre
of the property on a site 12
miles distant from Cunnamulla—
was erected by the present owner,
and both the interior and all the
surroundings indicate excellent taste
on the part of those responsible for
the designing and fitting up of this
handsome station residence. Mr.
Young, who spent nearly the whole
of his life in Queensland, takes a
keen interest in the affairs of the
district, and has always displayed a
ready co-operation in all movements
tending towards its advancement.
He has been for some time a member
of the Barcoo Shire Council, is a
member of the Barcoo Marsupial
Board, and has given cordial support
to local picnic racing events. He
also contributes liberally to the
sacred cause of charity, and is well
to the fore in patriotic effort. Mr.
Young married, in 1908, Annie,

and other properties on the Warrego,
and of “Alroy Downs,” on the
Barclay Tableland, in the Northern
Territory. Of this union there is a
family of two sons and one daughter.


WILLIAM BASSETT BEEL,
“Harriman Park,” Cunnamulla, was
born at Ladock, near Truro, Corn-
wall, England, on October 12, 1860,
and is the second son of the late
MR. WILLIAM BEEL.
William Beel, a farmer and the
descendant of a race of Celts follow-
ing agrarian pursuits, who settled
in England and helped to people
Wales and Cornwall as well as Ire-
land and other parts of Britain. At
the conclusion of his education at
the village school the subject of this
memoir worked for a while with his
father on the home farm, and sub-
sequently became the first of his
family to seek his fortune abroad.
Bidding farewell to his family and
homeland he set sail in the steamer
“John Elder” from Plymouth, and
landed in Sydney at the close of the
year 1879, while still but a lad in
his teens. Full of the buoyancy and
hope of youth he still displayed even
at that early age a foresight and
self-restraint that augured well for
his future success, and, husbanding
the small capital that had been
handed to him as his patrimony
before leaving England, left the city
behind him and secured his first
employment at Killenbutte, some
25 miles out from Bathurst. His
job was one of fencing, which taxed
all his powers of endurance, on
account of the trying climate and
the, to him, unaccustomed nature
of the work; but he persevered, and
triumphing over these obstacles suc-
cessfully concluded what he had
undertaken. He then returned to
Bathurst and obtained a position
under Mr. Rutherford, a director
of Messrs. Cobb & Co., and a well-
known pastoralist of that period,
who found him more congenial
occupation on his farm and among
the stock. In 1881 he was trans-
ferred to the teams travelling on the
route between Dubbo and Bourke,
and taking supplies to the stations
generally in the northern portion of
New South Wales. After three
years, whilst still engaged in the
carrying work on behalf of Messrs.
Cobb & Co., he journeyed to
MR. W. B. BEEL.
Cunnamulla, Queensland, which was
destined to be the scene of his future
home. Four years later, finding
that his modest capital had swelled
to a sufficient amount, he decided
to launch out on his own account,
and purchasing teams he started
on the roads between Bourke
(New South Wales), Mitchell Downs
(Queensland), and Cunnamulla, which
he made his headquarters. Mr. Beel
continued his business as a carrier
for a further four years, during
which period he established himself
as one of the best known and most
reliable men on the track, and
became a universal favourite among
his patrons and confreres. He passed
through a variety of experiences,
having suffered in his day practically
all the vicissitudes attendant upon
such a calling in a period before
civilization had set its seal upon a
country only then in the making.
Among the most outstanding draw-
backs of the time was the woeful
lack of water conservation, making
the intermittent spells of drought
greatly to be dreaded. Sinking for
artesian supplies was unknown in
the district, and Mr. Beel recalls
having paid sixpence per bucket for
water which, when received, was half
mud. No vegetables were obtain-
able, flour was £5 per cwt, and bad
at that, being full of weevils, etc.,
and tinned delicacies were rare and
expensive. Under such conditions
a man’s system became impaired
and the state of his blood such that
the slightest scratch soon developed
into a serious poisoned sore. Upon
the tracks traversed by the teams
there were no regular camps, the
water stages being in some instances
35 miles apart, and frequently when
the teams were unyoked the horses
had to be driven miles to secure
feed and to quench their thirst

during the night, that they might
be ready to continue the long and
trying journey again next morning.
Made roads were non-existent, and
the trials of passing over the boggy


black soil in wet weather and across
the loose sandy beds of creeks and
rivers made the lives of the teamsters
at times well-nigh unendurable.
Nevertheless, men were found of
sufficient grit and determination to
stick to the work when once they
had taken it in hand, and Mr.
Reel, having his full share of these
qualities, was among those who “won
through” with conspicuous success.
From 1888 to 1892 he continued on
the roads, and in January of the
latter year found himself in a
of lack of water on his holding, and
his first experiment was to sink
about a dozen surface wells from
25 feet to 35 feet in depth. The
supply from these sources, however,
was of a very temporary nature, and
admitting the test a failure he was
faced with the problem of solving
the water dilemma in some other
more effective way, or of losing all
that he had already expended on
the property. Boring was just
beginning to be talked about, and it
had been demonstrated that artesian
bore averaged about 3,000,000 gal-
lons per day, causing a pressure
six inches over the casing at the
point of exit. It is interesting to
note in this connection that photo-
graphs of the bore have been exhib-
ited all over the world. Greatly
encouraged by this excellent result
of his venture, Mr. Beel proceeded
with his work of developing the
property, fencing and subdividing
and stocking with sheep and gene-

position to take up a pastoral holding
of 10,000 acres, which he proceeded
forthwith to develop on his own
account. His first act was to erect
a rough dwelling-place, which hardly
deserved the name of a homestead,
being designed simply as a shelter
from rain and heat until the promise
of some degree of prosperity should
justify the expenditure of a larger
share of the treasured capital at the
disposal of the young settler in this
particular department. At the very
outset he was faced witli the difficulty
water could be secured by deep
sinking in suitable places. Accord-
ingly Mr. Beel decided to make a
bold throw and put his all to the
test. Mortgaging everything he had
on the place-teams, stock, and even
the property itself —he took steps
to put down a bore in the vicinity
of the present homestead, and after
reaching a depth of 1,706 feet was
rewarded for his enterprise by
striking what at that time was the
biggest flow of water from any bore
in Queensland. The output of the
of country became necessary. Pur-
chasing adjacent blocks, he con-
solidated his “Harriman Park”
Estate, and in 1906-7, when the
prosperity of the enterprise was
thoroughly established, gave his
attention to the erection of a home-
stead worthy of the property. The
“Harriman Park” residence is typical
of those for which the more
modern western and other Queens-
land stations are noted. Containing
ten large, well-ventilated rooms,
with a verandah all round, it is

sheep station, and the wool scour,
which is an important part of the
plant, is one of the most up-to-date
in the district. For many years at
the proper season the woolshed
presents a very busy spectacle, many
of the surrounding stations availing
themselves of the facilities provided
by Mr. Beel for the scouring process.
The bore water has proved itself
admirably suited to this pur-
pose, being fresh and particularly
free from minerals that might act
in a deleterious manner upon the
wool. In addition to “Harriman
Park” Mr. Beel has acquired various
other properties, the latest of which,
known as “Cobbrum Blocks,” is
situated some 50 miles north-east of
his present homestead holding. This
is mainly mulga country, well
covered with native grasses, and is
admirably suited to the purposes of

holdings in the district in his


possession, the one of most importance
being “Redbank,” a view of which
appears in connection with this
article. In the aggregate Mr. Reel's
landed interests cover an area of
about 120,000 acres, which in aver-
age seasons is capable of carrying
about 15,000 sheep and from 1,200
to 1,500 head of cattle. The whole
of the area is supplied with artesian
water, “Harriman Park” having
about 30 miles of drains, whilst on
“Cobbrum Blocks” from a bore
between 1,800 and 1,900 feet in
depth an excellent flow over 40 miles

There is also a third bore at the

these three axdesian sinkings, with
the necessary plant for distributing
the water, having run into £6,000,

part in public affairs, he has always
been a liberal subscriber to worthy
causes, and has willingly devoted
his time and service in support of
Queenslanders to present a military
kitchen for the use of the boys at
the front in the Great World-war.
Mr. Beel has been twice married.
His first wife was Annie Elizabeth,

well-known identity on the Victorian
goldfields over half a century ago.
Mr, Lauder, who came to Australia

child at the time of his parents’
arrival, but he vividly recalls his
passage in the Ship "Glantana," a

boat which brought many early set-
tlers to these shores, and which on
this occasion was stopped by a pirate
vessel at one stage of her journey.
This proved to be her last trip, as
on the return voyage, she sank,
shortly after leaving port, her des-
tination being China. The late
William Wood, who was an engineer
by trade, found employment in the
management of a sawmilling plant
at Toowoomba, on behalf of the late
Mr. Ballin, who had erected the
first sawmill in that town—a posi-
tion he held for several years. De-
siring a change of occupation, and
for financial reasons, he took over
the management of the mineral
water factory and soap works, own-
ed by the late Charles Jones, a
very old Queensland identity, and,
together with his son—the subject
of this memoir—carried on that
business for a lengthy period. Sub-
sequently, he became proprietor of
the Criterion Hotel, disposing of
this hostelry when the railway line
was extended towards Dalby, in
which centre he established himself
in business which he carried on
up to the time of his death. The
late William Wood was one of
Dalby’s prominent citizens. He took
a leading part in local government,
and, on three occasions, was elected
to the mayoral office. He estab-
lished a worthy record in the land
of his adoption, and handed down
to his children traditions of honour
and integrity which may be reck-
oned as the best of heritages. The
subject of this memoir, Mr. Joseph
Wood, received his education pri-
vately under the tuition of a Mr.
Myers, one of the earliest peda-
gogues to engage in the teaching
profession on the Darling Downs.
His schooldays came to a close as
soon as he arrived at an age to
make himself useful in connection
with the business carried on by his
father, and, during the various
changes made by the latter gentle-
man in pursuit of a livelihood, he
continued to act as his right-hand

block of land adjoining the town-

name of "Ashton Grove," where
he carried on pastoral pursuits for
about a quarter of a century. Mr.
Wood sold this property about the
year 1904, to the proprietor of the
present "Noorindoo" homestead
property, with which it is now con-
solidated. Before this sale was
effected, with his son he acquired by
selection and purchase the present

an ample supply for all the require-
ments of the station. Among the
many improvements which have
been carried out by Mr. Wood and
his sons, special mention may be
made of the fencing, which, by the
addition of wire-netting on the
boundary, has been made proof
against the inroads of both rabbits
and dingoes and other pests. The
“Warroon” homestead was erected
in 1915, and is of modern design,
surrounded by garden plots,
shrubs, and fruit trees, while in the
near vicinity are the necessary out-
sons, who, for many years, have co-
operated with him in all depart-
ments of his enterprise, and have
proved themselves of invaluable as-
sistance in the administration and
practical working of the estates.
In earlier life, during the closing
years of his teens, Mr. Joseph
Wood was a well-known figure in
sporting circles, and was one of the
most successful riders of that period.
He was married in 1870 to Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late Frederick
Churchill, who, with his wife, came
from Wiltshire, England, among
the immigrants whoi arrived at
Moreton Bay, Queensland, by the
sailing ship “Parsee,” in the year
1851. Mrs. Wood was born in
Brisbane less than two years after
that date, and, consequently, may
be numbered among the earlier
native-born Queenslanders now resi-
dent in the State. In all his under-
takings, Mr. Wood has been ably
seconded by the good wife, wlm has
borne with him the burden and heat
of the day. Of the family of thirteen
children resulting from the union,
five sons and three daughters sur-
vive, and the excellent reputation
earned by the parents is shared by
the sons and daughters, who- are
known throughout the district as
upright, honourable, and indus-
trious citizens of the Empire. The
eldest of the sons, William George,
some few years since launched out
for himself in pastoral pursuits, but
had not had sufficient time to estab-
lish himself when the devastating
drought of 1915-16 brought all his
efforts to naught. Abandoning the

Six years’ experience as droving
contractor at one period of his
career, however, gave him the oppor-
tunity to prove his capacity in an-
other sphere of work, with highly
satisfactory results. The three
younger sons, Ernest, Colin, and
Norman, at the outbreak of war,
offered their services to fight for
their King and country on the bat-
tlefields of the Old World. The
former two, however, on account of

JOHN NEILL, J.P., “Frog-

Ireland, on July 8, 1869, and is
the eldest son of Mr. James Neill,

now living in partial retirement at
Newstead, in the Castlemaine dis-
trict of Victoria. The latter gen-
tleman came from the Emerald Isle
to Australia in the year 1866, with
his wife and family of three young
children, and, upon his arrival at
the land of the Southern Cross, im-
mediately he settled on the holding
where he still resides, having been
connected with agrarian pursuits
there for over half a century. Of
his family of three sons and three
daughters, two of the sons have
thrown in their lot in Queensland,
and the remaining one, who is asso-
ciated with the civil service of Vic-
toria, also holds landed interests in
the Northern State. The gentleman
under review received his education
at the village school of Strangways,
in the neighbourhood of his old
home in Victoria. At eighteen years
of age, he left school, and became
associated with that fine old pioneer,
the late William Thrupp, who was
then engaged in the pastoral indus-
try on the Yanko Plains, in the
Riverina district of New South
Wales. Eventually, Mr. Thrupp
decided to settle in Queensland,
whither he was accompanied by the
gentleman under review. Mr.
Neill’s first venture on his own ac-
count was in 1884, when he selected
a block of land on the Balonne
River, and accomplished thereon a
certain amount of development
Subsequently, he disposed of this
and another holding, acquired by
him in that vicinity, and purchased
a grazing block, situated some 12
miles distant from Surat, which he
still administers in connection with
“Frogmoor,” his present homestead
block. The latter holding, a con-
siderable portion of which is free-
hold, came into his posssession in
1898, and has since been developed
as a sheep proposition with consid-
erable success. The homestead is
situated on the Yeulba Road, about
seven miles from the town of Surat,
and, from this headquarters, Mr.
Neill is able conveniently and at
frequent intervals, to visit the vari-
ous parts of his property. During
the period that has elapsed since he
started his independent enterprise,
Mr. Neill has had to contend with
the serious set-backs occasioned by
three separate seasons of drought,
but through the darkest times never
lost faith in the future of the State
of his adoption, and has had the
satisfaction of winning through, in
spite of temporary failures. Ever
since coming to Queensland, he has
made himself very useful in the
direction of local government, and
all matters of public importance or
for the betterment of conditions for
the ratepayers, have been given his
earnest co-operation and support.
Since 1908 he has been a councillor
of the Warroo Shire, of which body
he has been chairman for three
years; and he has taken a prominent

the various patriotic movements
which have sprung into being since
the outbreak of the Great War.

exercised the Commission of the

dent of political economy, he has

the Liberal interest, and is a strong
advocate in favour of granting in-
creased powers to local and muni-
cipal authorities. On three occasions
he has represented his council at the
Local Authorities’ Conference, held
annually at Brisbane. He was mar-
ried in 1901 to Annie Mary, daugh-
ter of the late John Nason, one of
the earliest pioneers of the Surat
district, whose descendants are
numbered among the representative
families of that part of the State.
A family of four sons and two
daughters is the result of this
union.


JOHN GUNN, “North Bur-
gorah,” via Surat, was born at
“Glenlyon” Station, near Stan-
thorpe, on April 15, 1883, and is the
second son of Mr. Donald Gunn,
M.L.A., one of the first settlers on
the Barwon River, and the present
representative for Carnarvon elec-
torate in the House of Assembly.
For many years the latter gentleman
owned the well-known “Boolarwell”
Station, near Talwood, South-West
Queensland. The subject of our
memoir, Mr. John Gunn, received
his education by private tuition at
“Boolarwell,” subsequently for a
time attending the State School at
Stanthorpe, and concluding his
scholastic career at the Boys’ Gram-
mar School, Brisbane, under the
headmastership of Mr. Reginald H.
Roe, late general inspector of State
Schools. Leaving school at the age
of nineteen, he returned to “Boolar-
well,” and renewed his acquaintance
with the routine of station work,
with which all through his boyhood
years he had been familiar. Re-
maining under the parental roof for
a couple of years, he left home in
1903, to join his uncle, Mr. Thomas
Gunn,in the purchase of “Old Cash-
mere” Station, formerly in possession
of Messrs. McMicking Brothers, and
Mr. Gunn took up his present hold-
ing, situated on the Balonne River,

lific growth of natural grasses, and
timbered with wide belts of mulga
and other edible scrub, box, and
coolibah. Bight at the outset of his
independent enterprise, Mr. Gunn
found his operations affected very
seriously, but he persevered through
his time of trial, and, in due course,
by dint of industry and careful man-
agement, he achieved the success
that the exercise of these qualities
deserved. The property is still in
process of development, although a
great deal of improvement work has
already been completed, particularly
in the direction of fencing and water
supply. While its three-and-a-half
miles of frontage to the Balonne
River places the property in a fav-
ourable position in respect to the
latter department, further arrange-
ments are now in progress to make
available for “North Burgorah”

on an adjoining property. Some
thirty miles of dog- and rabbit-proof
fencing has been erected round the
boundary of the run, and a consider-
able amount of subdivision work has
been accomplished. Mr. Gunn con-
fines his operations solely to sheep,

erty in conjunction with his relative
for some years. A dissolution of
partnership then took place, and
property then acquired by Mr.
Gunn included the original home-
stead of “North Burgorah,” sur-
rounded by about 22,000 acres of
industry attributing a measure
of his success to the ready assist-
ance and advice of his neigh-
bour, Mr. Alex. Gilmour, who owns


the adjoining run, and who ie re-
puted to be one of the best judges
of sheep in Australia. He interests
himself in sporting matters and is a
keen follower of amateur racing
events, his horses having placed sev-
eral events to hie credit on the local
courses. He married in 1909 Clara
Ethel, daughter of Mr. Samuel
Winks, of “Wycombe,” one of the
oldest pioneer settlers on the Ba-
lonne River and of this union there
is issue one daughter.

son of Mr. Charles Ferris, who was
born in Cornwall, England, in
1845, and, five years later, was
MR. A. H. FERRIS.
brought to Victoria by his parents,
the family settling near Melbourne.
Mr. Charles Ferris’s father, Mr.
Henry Ferris, was a wheelwright by
trade, and became the pioneer of
his calling at Prahran—which is
now a thriving suburb of the city
of Melbourne—at a time when the
metropolis itself was only in its in-
fancy. This old Celtic founder of
his name under Austral skies sub-
sequently followed the example of
so many craftsmen who came to nly
their trade in the land of the
Southern Cross, and abandoned
wheelwrighting in favour of land
settlement, acquiring a property at
Newham, near Kyneton, Victoria,
where he resided until the time of
his death in 1862. His son,
Charles, at fifteen, became the pos-
sessor of a bullock team, and, even
at that early age, was engaged in
the carrying trade in connection
with the rushes to newly-discovered
goldfields. He became one of the
best-known identities among his
confreres of the road on the route
between Melbourne and Bendigo,
and spent about five years in this
avocation, whilst still in his teens
transferring his sphere of action to
the carrying of wool between the
Riverina district and the metropolis.
In 1873 he relinquished this means
of making a livelihood, and took up
land in the Loddon district, which
he devoted to mixed farming opera-
tions. Here he remained until
1882, conjointly with his activities
on his farm, working a threshing
plant throughout the district. In
the last-mentioned year he sold his
Victorian interests, and, accom-
panied by an old friend of over a
quarter of a century’s standing, set
out for Queensland, driving overland
to Surat, where he arrived on Janu-
ary 1, 1883. Almost immediately
he was fortunate enough to secure
the “Rockton” selection, where the
present homestead stands, and, set-
tling down on this holding, he car-
ried on until 1889, when he went
into the cedar trade, on the north
coast railway line. Mr. Charles
Ferris was very successful in his
endeavours in this line of industry,
and within a few years was able to
retire from active pursuits. Dur-
ing the closing years of a life which
has been extended over the allotted
span, cheered by the companionship
of the helpmeet of his younger days,

he resides with one of his sons on
the north coast, having done his
share in the rough pioneering work
of a great State, and fully earned
the rest which his time of
retirement has brought. Six sons and
two daughters survive of the family
born to the old pioneer and his
wife, and, of these, four of the sons
are on the land. The youngest son
MR. F. A. FERRIS
occupies the position of head ac-
countant in the Australian Mercan-
tile Land and Finance Company,
Brisbane, while the only unmarried
son served his King and coun-
try at the war front. The gentle-
man under review, Mr. Alfred
Henry Ferris, received his educa-
tion in Victoria, where he attended
various State schools until thirteen
years of age. About that date the
family removed to Queensland, and,
after spending a couple of years on
his father’s property, at sixteen
he entered upon the battle of life
on his own account. The general
avocations of the hush came most


readily to liis hand, and he applied
himself to the work of fencing, tank-
sinking, and “doing the rounds of the
sheds.” lie followed this life until

business of carrying out a definite
career began to make an appeal.
Having taken upon himself the
responsibilities of marriage, he de-
cided to strike out in a new path,
and arranged for the purchase of
his father’s “Rockton” property, to
which he brought his first draft of
sheep in the year 1894. Mr. Ferris
successfully launched his proposi-
tion, next availing himself of the
opportunity to secure various other
blocks in the vicinity of the original
holding. He owns some 17,000
acres of agricultural and grazing
farm lands, which he utilises for
the depasturage of both sheep and
cattle. The country comprised in
these holdings is typical of the dis-
trict, a river frontage of six miles to
the Balonne River, and a double
frontage of two miles to Bungil
Creek being valuable assets to the
run. Natural grasses abound, and
timber is also plentiful, the princi-
pal species being belar, box, oooli-
bah, and pine, as well as a variety
of edible scrub growths. Mr. Ferris
has displayed marked ability in the
administration of his affairs, and
has established a high reputation in
the district for energy and industry.
In addition to the duties entailed by
his private enterprise, he has also
assumed the responsibilities of pub-
lie office, and, for over fifteen years,
has served as a councillor of Warroo
Shire. He has been a member of
the local hospital committee since
its inception, and takes a full share
in all matters pertaining to the
general advancement of the dis-
trict. He has made his name in the
realm of local and general sport, and
is regarded as a reliable judge of a
good horse, being himself the
breeder of some classy stock, not-
ably “Malt Mark,” by “Malster”
—“Simper,” by “Simmer” (imp.).
“Malt Mark” was successful in
good company, and won the Strad-
broke Handicap (Ascot), Brisbane
Thousand (Albion Park), Camelia
Stakes (Rose Hill, Sydney), and the
Carrington Stakes (Randwick). He
also bought and raced “Eurodus,”
by “Eudorus,” from “Malsterette,”
who, among other good races, won the
Albion Park Five Hundred. Mr.
Ferris was married in 1893 to
Louisa, daughter of Mr. Frederick
Burow, an old pioneer of the Surat
district, and of the union there is
a family of four sons and two
daughters. The eldest son, Freder-
ick Alfred, who was bom in 1894,
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces, and fought with the allied
armies in France.

who was born at Celle, in the
Kingdom of Hanover, in 1834, and

not yet become a German State.
The two brothers were well-known

with the hour-milling industry
in an extensive way, while he also
held large interests in a tanning
business at Mount Gambier. He
married at Melbourne, in 1862,
Juilanna Pauline, daughter of the
late F. Straube, another pioneer
settler of the period, by whom he
had a family of six children. Mrs.
Wehl, senior, was born in Saxony,
in the year 1842, and lived the first
six years of her life in that country,
which as yet, like Hanover, was a
State independent of German influ-
ence. She came with her parents
to Australia, arriving in Melbourne
by the ship “Verpages,” on March
21, 1849. Much of the success
achieved by the Wehl family in
Queensland is due to the lady in
question, who, after the death of
her husband in 1874, with the ob-
ject of making a more ample pro-
vision for the future of her chil-
dren, disposed of her interests in
South Australia, and showed her-

make the sacrifices involved in start-
ing life on the land in another
colony. In a country but slightly
developed, for the sake of her fam-
ily, she faced all the terrors of the
bush, and, selecting the country
known as ‘‘Gambier Park,” took
upon herself pioneer work, enduring
the inevitable hardships of the early
settler, and accomplishing results
worthy to be classed with those
achieved on neighbouring proper-
ties. The land taken up in the first
instance was not extensive in area,
an agricultural homestead holding
comprising something over 2,000
acres being the scene of the earliest
efforts of the family in Queensland.
As the sons grew to manhood, how-
ever, the boundaries were considerably
enlarged, and when Mrs. Wehl
retired from active pursuits to spend
the autumn of her days at Too-
woomba, the property already had
been established, and could hold its

The elder sons of the family having
taken up land on their own account,

pleasant and comfortable with up-

rounded by a flower garden which,
in the season of bloom, is a bright
and attractive spot. The outhouses
in the vicinity are modern in de-
sign, and in every' way suited to
the purposes of general utility which
were kept in view at the time of
their erection. Mr. Wehl interests
himself in the general welfare of
the district in which he resides, and,
for some years, occupied a seat on
the Warroo Shire Council. He gives
ready support and encouragement
to all organised effort on behalf of
charitable and patriotic causes, and
displays a loyal and helpful spirit
in connection with every worthy
movement brought under his no-
tice. He married in 1906 Catherine
Isabel, daughter of the late Finlay
Campbell, of “Warkon” Station,
and for a lengthy period was asso-
ciated with the pastoral industry in
Queensland. The late Mr. Camp-
bell came originally from Scotland
in the year 1868. He was fol-
lowed a few years later by
his brother, Mr. Archie Campbell,
now a well-known personality on
the Darling Downs, and the above-
named station was owned in part-
nership by the two brothers for a
number of years. The Campbells
were nephews of the Hon. William
Campbell, one of the best-known
pastoralists in Victoria, and their
ancestry may be traced back to
the days of the very remote Scot-
tish clans. Mr. and Mrs. Weld have
a family of one son and four
daughters.
R
VICTOR EDWARD WEHL,
J.P., owner of the “Narridy” Estate,
Surat, was born at Mount Gam-
bier, South Australia, on May 24,
1865, and is the second son of the
late Max William Wehl, previously
referred to. He received his prim-
ary education at the Mount Gam-
bier State School, with a finishing
course at the Grammar School of
that town, and, at the conclusion of
his studies, became his father’s as-
sistant in the tannery conducted by
that worthy pioneer in the same dis-
trict. After the demise of the late
Mr. Wehl, in 1874, the family af-
fairs were controlled by his widow,
who, about 1882, having disposed of
her South Australian interests,
came to Queensland, where she took
up the country now known as
“Gambier Park.” The subject of
this memoir, who was about sixteen
years of age when he arrived in the
Northern State, at once applied his
energies to the working of the new
holding under the general direction
of his mother and elder brother,
and, upon the marriage of the lat-
ter gentleman in 1895, assumed the
duties of manager, which he carried
out until 1901. He then started
on his own account at “Linwood,”
in the Roma district, the conduct
and development of which property
he continued for about six years,
when he sold out with the object
in view of establishing himself on a
more productive area. Purchasing
his present homestead, “Narridy,”
adjoining the “Gambier Park” Es-
tate, from his father-in-law, Mr.
F. E. Haase —who had named the
place after the old home of the
Haase family in South Australia —
he gave his attention to the fur-
ther improvement of this property,
and, in 1914, acquired “Lyndoch,”
also situated in the neighbourhood
of Surat, some thirty miles distant
from his present home, which is
now in course of development. His
landed holdings together comprise
about 15,000 acres, devoted exclu-
sively to the breeding of merino
sheep, in which Mr. Wehl has met
with a satisfactory measure of
success. The homestead at “Nar-
ridy” was erected by Mr. Wehl in
1908, and presents the appearance
of a prosperous pastoral home. Of
a retiring disposition, the gentle-
man under review has never been
ambitious for public office, but ac-
cepted the Commission of the Peace
from the Philp Administration, the
duties of which office he has carried
out ever since. Mr. Wehl married
in 1901 Antonia Sophia, daughter
of Mr. Frederick Haase, of “Oak-
lands” Station, Surat, a pastoralist
who first settled in Queensland in
the early eighties, now living in
retirement at Roma, and has four
sons and two daughters. “Nar-
ridy” is noted in the Surat district
for its flower garden, Mrs. Wehl
being a floral enthusiast both in pot
plants and open flower.

of Mr. Robert Dehnert, now living

in retirement in Melbourne. This
venerable gentleman, who is (1917)
in his eighty-fifth year, has been a
colonist of Victoria for close on
seventy years. Leaving his native
land (Silesia) when sixteen years of
age, he took passage for Victoria,
where, on arrival, although brought
up to the bakery trade in his home-
land, he found himself forced to take
whatever employment offered in this
new and untried sphere. As a re-
sult, he encountered his full share
of rough experiences, and only the
courageous and independent spirit
which prompted him in the first in-
stance to endeavour to improve his
position by emigration, carried him
through the earlier years of his so-
journ in a strange country. Even-
tually the opportunity to learn the
brickmaking trade presented itself,
which he gladly embraced, thus pro-
viding himself with a means of
livelihood, and a history of the brick-
making industry in Victoria would
be incomplete without mention of
the name of this worthy pioneer.
Thus settled in a quiet but progres-
sive enterprise, he pursued his ways
of thrift and activity until the ex-
citement of the gold discoveries in
the early fifties set his adventurous
spirit aflame. Proceeding with the
rushes to Bendigo and Ballarat,
and, subsequently, to the Ovens
River, he met with a certain measure
of success in his ventures. Not fully
satisfied, however, with the results
of prospecting, he invested his sav-
ings in carrying plants and became
among the best known of the car-
riers on the roads in the old romantic
days, when the fabulous price of
£lOO per ton could be secured for
carriage of goods from the Victorian
metropolis. When competition re-
duced the profits of this business,
Mr. Dehnert started in the brick-
making trade on his own account.
This was in the middle fifties, his
small plant being located at Abbots-
ford, on the spot where he now
resides; and through the lengthy
period of the sixty years which since
have elapsed, he has worthily sus-
tained a reputation for integrity and
business acumen. He was elected to
the Collingwood City Council (Vic.)
MR. R. C. DEHNERT.
in 1877. He married Marie, daugh-
ter of the late Frederick Straube, a
native of Saxony, and a pioneer of
an even earlier period than that
which witnessed the advent of Mr.
Dehnert to Australia. With his wife
and family—his daughter Marie
then being a child of six—Frederick
Straube came to Victoria by the
ship “Vapcus,” the voyage extend-
ing over nine months. It may be
mentioned in passing that a member
of this family subsequently became
a missionary, and suffered a martyr’s
death at the hands of the cannibals
of the Fiji Islands. Mr. Dehnert
had a family of fourteen children,
of whom nine were sons, and
his descendants, with the one
exception of Mr. Reinhold Charles
Dehnert, the subject of this notice,
settled in Victoria, where the name
is well known. Mr. R. C. Dehnert
received his education primarily at
the Government Model School at
East Melbourne, continuing his
studies at Scotch College, which has
been the scholastic training ground
of so many successful men of various
callings all over Australia. Complet-
ing his education at seventeen years
of age, he became identified with the
brewing business, and, during the
six years thus spent, he became
thoroughly proficient in all branches
of the malting industry. Whilst
still residing under the paternal
rooftree, he gave considerable heed
to the remarks frequently let fall by
his father, who was apt to comment
unfavourably upon the lack of enter-
prise displayed by the youth of the
time, who were content to settle
down in comfortable, but monoton-
ous positions, never aspiring to the
honour of assisting in the develop-
ment of the wide, untouched country
which was their heritage by birth.
Possessing something of the tempera-
ment of his sire, Mr. R. C. Deh-
nert finally broke away from a con-
ventional life, and set his face
toward the north, where the possi-
bilities of the pastoral industry were
beginning to attract the attention of
enterprising residents of Australia.
Having gained sufficient experience
to make a start, he soon acquired a
block of land on his own account, in
the Surat district, which he took up
MR. W. H. THRUPP.
from the Crown, this originally hav-
ing been a portion of the old “War-
kon” Station, which had been sub-
divided for closer settlement pur-
poses. Mr. Dehnert gave to the


property the name of “Grosvenor
Downs,” and, for about twelve
years, he resided there and devoted
his attention to the development of
his acres. During this period he

availed himself of every opportunity
to augment his knowledge of stock,
and, as he gradually obtained the
practical acquaintance with the char-
acter of the Queensland climate and
other local conditions essential to
the successful carrying on of a pas-
toral proposition, he directed his
attention to the acquirement of fur-
ther holdings. Accordingly, in
1894, he added to his landed possess-
ions by the selection of his present
homestead block, on “Noorindoo”
Station (named “Broadmarsh” after
the home of his wife’s progenitors,
in Tasmania, over a hundred years
ago), and, later, embraced the op-
portunity to purchase adjoining
estates, whilst he still retained pos-
session of his original Queensland
home. ‘Broadmarsh” has a frontage
of about six miles to the Condamine
River, and is also watered by the
Wallumbilla Creek, which flows
through the property for a similar
distance. The country is typical of
the district, containing soil favour-
able to the growth of a variety of
nourishing indigenous grasses, equal-
ly suitable to the fattening of both
sheep and cattle, and well provided
with edible scrub, which is the
stand-by of the pastoralist in seasons
of drought. The estate has been
brought to a high pitch of develop-
ment by Mr. Dehnert, who uses it
as a mixed stock proposition, horses,
as well as sheep and cattle, being
raised. He was at one time still

more largely interested in pastoral
property in the district, having taken
up, in conjunction with a partner,
the “Teddington” Estate, a well-
known property now in the hands of
the Ferrier family, which was worked
by the firm for five years. Mr. Deh-
nert has taken a prominent part in
local public affairs, and every move-
ment of importance in the district
receives his wholehearted encourage-
ment and practical support. For
twelve years he filled the office of
councillor of the Warroo Shire, and
had the honour of presiding over the
council as chairman for four years.
He married in 1905 Frances Caro-
line, daughter of the late William
Henry Thrupp, one of the early
pioneers of the Surat district, and
a eon of the late Henry Thrupp, the
original founder of the family in
Australia, who came with his wife
to settle in Tasmania during the
administration of Governor Arthur,
to whom he carried letters of intro-
duction from England. Mr. W. H.
Thrupp was born at Elderslie, Broad-
marsh, Tasmania, on February 28,
1825. In 1849 he went to Cali-
fornia, at the time of the big gold
rush, and continued there for a
couple of years, returning to Aus-
tralia when the Bendigo field was
discovered in 1851. Purchasing a
team of 12 bullocks at a cost of £3OO,
he started with them on the roads.
Later, he conducted a butchering
business in Prahran, where he re-
sided until 1857, when he removed
to Ravenswood, near Bendigo, and
engaged in farming, carrying, and
stock-dealing. In 1867, in partner-
ship with the late Mr. Walcott
Thomas, Mr. Thrupp purchased
“Sutton Grange,” situated at the
foot of Mount Alexander, near
Castlemaine, Victoria, where he
successfully combined pastoral pur-
suits with milling until 1874. Sub-
sequently he owned a property at
Jerilderie, in the Riverina, New
South Wales, and, in 1882, came
to Queensland. He took up the
“BROADMARSH” HOMESTEAD.
“H Lagoon” Estate, near Surat,
where he resided up to the time of
his death, on July 30, 1906. Mr.
and Mrs. Dehnert have a family of
two sons and three daughters.


CHARLES ROWDON WIP-
PELL, J.P., “New Cashmere,” St.
George, was born at Kangaroo
Grounds, Victoria, on April 10,
1859, and is a son of the late Walter
MR. C. R. WIPPELL,
Wippell, a native of Devon, Eng-
land, who with his father came to
Australia in the early days of settle-
ment, and became engaged in farm-
ing pursuits in the Heidelberg dis-
trict of Victoria, where they did
their share of development work
among the pioneers of the district.
The gentleman under review re-
ceived his education at the Eltham
State School, and at the termination
of his studies remained under the
paternal roof tree until 19 years of
earliest stations to be formed on the
Balonne River, and as such now
regarded as a property with some
historic interest. Mr. Wippell
gained his first experience as jack-
aroo on his cousin’s station, where
he reaped the full benefit of close
association with the latter gentle-
man, an acknowledged stock ex-
pert, who had been born and bred in
the pastoral industry, his father
having been one of the leading pas-
toralists of Victoria almost from
the foundation of the Garden State.
After about three years at “Gulnar-
ber,” Mr. Wippell turned his atten-
tion to the retail meat trade in the
township of St. George, and continued
in this business for nearly 30 years.
He took up “Guee,” a grazing
farm on the old “Doondi” run,
which in the eighties was subdivided
for purposes of selection by smaller
settlers, the portion chosen by Mr.
Wippell being the first of the sub-
divisions to change hands. In 1902
he enlarged his possessions by the
acquirement of “New Cashmere,”
formerly owned by the late Robert
McMicking, and two years later still
further extended his landed interests
by the taking up of “Ingaby,” a
grazing farm occupying the site of
the original “Wagoo” Station. With
these three properties, comprising in
all over 70,000 acres, Mr. Wippell
carried on a successful sheep propo-
sition for a time, but receiving an
advantageous offer to dispose of
“Guee,” he decided to sell, and this
transaction was speedily followed by
the sale of “Ingaby,” leaving him
property a headquarters for his
pastoral operations, and for a number
of years he combined these interests
with very satisfactory results, from
time to time adding to his landed

possessions by the purchase of
various freehold properties in close
vicinity to the township. These pro-
perties aggregate some 5,000 acres,
and are worked in conjunction with
“New Cashmere,” which is situated
on the junction of the Maranoa and
Balonne Rivers, about 18 miles in
a northerly direction from St.
George. Both sheep and cattle are
grazed on the pastures of all the
age, when he decided to come to
Queensland with his cousin, the late
George M. Kirk, well known as the
owner of “Gulnarber” Station, in
the St. George district, one of the

with only “New Cashmere" on his
hands. Whilst continuing to give
his personal attention to the conduct
of the business at St. George, Mr.
Wippell made of the last-named
holdings, but preference is given by
Mr. Wippell to sheep, and accord-
ingly the flocks usually preponder-
ate, and yield excellent returns,
proving the congeniality of the


climate and conditions generally to
this class of stock. Mr. Wippell in
1912 disposed of his commercial in-
terests in St. George, but continued
to reside there until 1916, when he

firm at St. George, was bom at the
latter town in 1891. At the dose

years, while in many other ways he
served a very useful part, and took
a keen interest in all organizations

daughter of the late Reuben Tread-
well, an old Queensland settler,

mar School, he returned home, and
forthwith began his training for his
future career as a pastoralist on his
father’s properties, of which he
assumed charge in 1917. He resides
in the town of St. George, whence
he administers the affairs of the
various properties, paying frequent

ter of Mr. ,T. C. Portus, of St.
George.


CHARLES JOHN WINKS,
“South Burgorah,” St. George, wa s
born at Brisbane, Queensland, on
May 6, 1852, and is the eldest son
of the late Charles John Winks, one
of the very early settlers of the
State. This gentleman came from
England in the days when Moreton
Bay was one of the smallest and
most remote of British settlements,
and Queensland itself only an out-
post of the Empire. At that early
period—now three-quarters of a cen-
tury ago —the late Mr. Winks
established a pit-saw, which turned
out a quantity of timber for build-
ing purposes, many of the huts
erected in the pioneer days being
constructed from timber prepared at
this pit. There were no saw-mills,
and Mr. Winks’ factory was situ-
ated in the vicinity of the present
Creek Street, which was then in its
natural state of bush —only a few
houses and three or four taverns
representing the now populous city
of Brisbane. The educational facili-
ties of the day were but meagre,
and Mr. Charles John Winks, like
other sons of the early settlers, had
to take his chance of such instruc-
tion as he could obtain at Warwick,
where a few years of his childhood
MR. C. J. WINKS.
were spent. He began active life at
an early age by assisting his father
in the timber sawing and the bush
work, which was auxiliary to that
enterprise; and, at the age of
eighteen, launched out for himself,
becoming engaged in stock-droving
and horse-breaking and other kin-
dred pursuits, in which he attained
a proficiency which stood him in
good stead in later years. Among
his other engagements during this
period of his life, he was manager
in the late seventies of “Tartella”
Station, in the Surat district, and,
for about fifteen years, filled the post
of stock overseer for Mr. W. Ross
Munro. Until 1903 he contented
himself with the degree of advance-
ment which these positions carried,
availing himself of favourable oppor-
tunities for purchasing stock, which
he pastured on neighbouring runs in
the St. George district. His first
launch out in the direction of per-
sonal land ownership occurred in the

year referred to, when he acquired
his present property, “South Bur-
gorah,’’ from Mr. W. Ross Munro,
and, subsequently, he became the
proprietor of “Wycombe,” at one
period of his career administering
about 130 square miles on his own
account. The combined scourges of
drought and prickly pear, however,
ruined his chances of success, and
he found it advisable to abandon
“Wycombe,” and to concentrate his
energies on the former run, where
he still resides. “South Burgorah”
comprises about 13,000 acres, situ-
ated on the Balonne River, about
eleven miles from the town of St.
George, and is devoted exclusively
to cattle of the Shorthorn type by
Mr. Winks, who gives the whole of
liis time and attention to the carry-
ing on of his enterprise. Mr. Winks
is a man of public spirit, and, as
far as lies in his power, identifies
himself with the organizations of the

district. He lias served on the local
hospital committee, and gives cor-
dial support to all worthy charitable
objects. He is also fond of sport,
and has always been to the fore in
affairs connected with the promotion
of racing in the vicinity of St.
George. Married in 1879 to Eliza-
beth, daughter of the late John
Pickup, a one-time well-knowm pas-
toral manager of the Bogan district,
Mr. Winks has a surviving family
of five sons and five daughters. Of
these, two of the sons- —Ranald and
Natal—served at the Front in
the Great War waged by Britain
and her Allies against the
Central European nations. The
younger, Ranald, who was only
eighteen when he left Queensland
with the Australian Imperial Forces,
was wounded at Pozieres, in which
historic battle the Australian Forces
fought with great valour.
JAMES HARTLEY ROUVRAY,
J.P., of “Spring Vale,” Taroom, is
a native of Victoria, having been
born at Hawksburn, a suburb of
Melbourne, on August 18, 1885.
He is the youngest son of Mr.
Charles P. P. Rouvray, who for
nearly half a century was a promi-
nent figure in commercial centres in

that centre of the Victorian metro-
polis known to the world at large as
“The Lane.” A Lancastrian by
birth, Mr. C. P. Rouvray springs
from an old English family which
MR. J. H. ROUVRAY.
can trace its ancestry back to the
time of the Huguenots. Like his
forefathers, leaving the land of his
birth, he came to Australia in the
fifties, and after a long and honour-
able business career is now living
in retirement in Melbourne. The
subject of our review received his
education at the Toorak Grammar
School, at the age of 14 years joining
the staff of the Braybrook Implement
Company, forerunner of the
Hugh V. McKay Company, famous
as the manufacturers of the “Sun-
shine” harvester and other popular
machines and implements for farm-
ing purposes. AVhile still in his
teens he launched out in business on
his own account, but finding indoor
life not conducive to a robust state
of health, he decided to relinquish
this mode of making a livelihood
and turn his attention to the land.
In furtherance of this decision he
proceeded to Strathraerton, Victoria,
and spent two years in gaining
experience in the various branches
of mixed farming. The knowledge
thus acquired inspired him with
confidence to start an independent
enterprise, and having noted from
time to time excellent reports of the
industry in Queensland he selected
the Northern State as his venue of
operations. Arriving in 1906, he
first worked for a time on '‘Jess-
lands Station, under the late Ralph
Clifton, at a later date taking over
the management of the property.
Having made himself thoroughly
conversant with the climatic and
other conditions, ultimately he took
up a lease on the Roche River, in
the iaroom district. He soon found
however, that the area was not
sufficient for his purpose, and dis-
posed of the place. Mr. Rouvray
then purchased his present estate,
“Spring Yale,” and has since
continued the development of this
property, which at the present time
is worthy to rank with the best
holdings in the district for its size,
being included among the most
complete and excellently managed
homes on the Dawson River. “Spring
Vale” comprises some 22,000 acres
of splendid cattle country, to which
industry the run is given over, in
normal seasons as many as 1,500 of
the popular and successful Hereford
type finding adequate pasturage
over its grassy areas. The estate is
well watered by the permanent flow
of the Dawson, this supply being
augmented by several perennial
springs, and on the back portion of
the run by dams. Fencing opera-
tions have been carried on steadily,
and over 25 miles of posts and wires
keep the stock securely enclosed.
The present homestead was built by
Mr. Rouvray, while the original
dwelling-house is utilized for offices,
kitchen, and other like purposes,
The new residence is a substantial
structure of good appearance, con-
taining large and well-ventilated
rooms, an exceptionally wide veran-
dah providing a shady retreat from
the intense heat of the sun. Mr.
Rouvray takes a deep interest in all
matters bearing on the welfare and
progress of the district, and was vice-
president of the Taroom Agricul-
tural Society. He was one of the
founders of the Roche Creek Pro-
gress Association, which has taken a
prominent part in furthering the
advancement of the district, and is

and appointments of the interior,
and in the surrounding flower-beds,

a very delightful and picturesque
setting for the house. FREDERICK
WILLIAM KEMP was born at
Kempsey, on the Macleay River,
New South Wales, on March 4,
1862, and is a son of the late James
H add on Kemp, who was joint
owner with his brother of the old
historic pastoral properties, “Tor-
rumbie” and “Boononghi,” in that
district. These stations, which ad-
joined, were situated in the moun-
tainous region lying back from the

Kemp was the son of an
Irish aristocrat, whose mar-
riage associations had been
intermixed with some of the
equally old families of Kent,
England, viz., the Blaker-
stons and the Haddons, names
connected with some of the
notable events in British
history as far back as the
Wars of the Roses. A
brother of the late Major
—Colonel Kemp —served in
the Indian Mutiny, and
to-day the descendants of this
military line have done their
share in the Great World War
of 1914-18; and of the twelve
members of the Australian branch
who served at the front, two
have risen to the rank of major
and two have been awarded the
military cross. Major Kemp held
commands in India and on the Staff
in England, being commandant at
Fort Pitt and at Chatham,

subsequently taking command of
troops bound for New South Wales
nearly a century ago. Later he repre-
sented the Imperial Government as
commandant of military settlement
in New South Wales, and with his
brother-in-law, Admiral Sir Gordon
Bremmer, R.N., was closely con-
nected with the early military and
naval history of that colony. He was
highly popular, his gentlemanly
qualities and high sense of honour
commending him to his brother
officers and the original pioneers of

the land of his adoption. Eventu-
ally he retired from military duties
to devote his attention to pastoral
pursuits. The name “Kempsey”


was bestowed on the settlement
which sprang up in the vicinity of
his properties, and adjoined the
original Crown grant to his son,
Lieutenant William Kemp, of the
Royal Engineers. Major Kemp died
at “Boononghi,” and was buried
there. A family of six sons and three
daughters survived him. Four of
his sons became engaged in pas-
toral pursuits; one, Lieutenant Wil-
liam Kemp, R.E., followed the mili-
tary profession in India, where he
was recognized as a clever engineer.
Whilst on furlough, visiting his
parents at “Boononghi,” he was
drowned in flood waters while as-
sisting to make a survey of the pass
between Macleay River and New
England, which work he had under-
taken at request of the Government
of the day. Another son, the Rev.
Frederick Kemp, was clergyman of
the Church of England parish of
Port Macquarie. Mr. James Had-
don Kemp, father of the gentleman
under review, was a member of this
family, and with his brothers re-
tained his interest in the New South
Wales station properties, besides
holding other pastoral lands in that
State. He died at Armidale, New
South Wales, in the year 1900. By
his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of the
late Commander Caswell R.N., of
“Hursley,” he had issue six sons
and three daughters, all of the sons
being engaged in pastoral pursuits.
Mr. F. W. Kemp received his educa-
tion under private tuition in the
parental home, and subsequently,
having chosen the profession of
engineering surveyor, he applied
himself to the study of that profes-
sion, and having sat for examination
and fully qualified was appointed
land and mining surveyor to the
Government of New South Wales.
During the period of his engage-
ment he obtained official recognition
for the excellence of his work. He
resigned his position on the profes-
sional staff of Public Works Depart-
ment in 1904, and purchased a graz-
ing property in the Collarenebri dis-
trict, New South Wales, eventually
coming to Queensland, where he
took up “Moolabah,” his present
holding. Mr. Kemp married m
1889 Mary Margaret, daughter of
the late H. C. Robarts Smith, of
Mount Pleasant, New South Wales,
who was the son of an English gen-
tleman occupying a prominent posi-
tion in the management of the well-
known firm of Lloyds, London, ovei
a century ago, and recognized as a
power in shipping circles. Mr. H. C.
Robarts Smith came to the colony
in the sixties, and became connected
with commercial life in New Soutli
Wales, residing for nearly fifty years
in the vicinity of Albury. He mar-
ried Miss Mary Taylor, a connection
of the MacLaurin family, who were
amongst the early pioneers of that
district. Mr. and Mrs. Kemp have
a family of three sons and one
daughter. The eldest son manages
“Moolabah,” while the second,
James Haddon, joined the Aus-
tralian Field Artillery and served
in the Great War.
THOMAS ALFRED SPENCER,
J.P., grazier, and stock and station
agent, Roma, was born at Iron
Bark, New South Wales, on Decem-
ber 1, 1860, being a son of the late
Rev. Charles Spencer, 8.A., who
arrived in that State in the year
1837. He married Miss Susan Dow-
ling, daughter of Sir James Dow-
ling, then Chief Justice of the
Mother State, and subsequently in
1865 came to Queensland to join
his brother, Mr. Stephen Spencer,
MR. T. A. SPENCER.
owner of “Mount Abundance” Sta-
tion, in the Roma district. In 1867
he became rector of the parish in
which this property is situated,
where his labours in the cause of
Christianity are still remembered
with gratitude and appreciation.
The late reverend gentleman planted
the first vineyard in Roma, and
demonstrated that the soil was
adapted to the successful cultivation
of the grape. His death took place
in 1873, a family of five sons and
four daughters surviving him. Mr.
T. A. Spencer, the youngest son,
received his scholastic training at a
State School, also studying for a
time under private tuition, and at
the close of his education entered a
solicitor’s office in New South Wales.
Later he joined the staff of tlie
Queensland National Bank, after
four years resigning to strike out on
his own behalf as a stock and station
agent at Roma. His industry and
enterprise soon attracted the atten-
tion of the pastoralists of the dis-
trict, and the honourable manner in
which all his transactions were
accomplished soon gained for him
the implicit confidence of his clients.
As a result he succeeded in building
up a business which to-day ranks
second to none of its kind west of
Toowoomba. Mr. Spencer holds
considerable interests in pastoral
property, and is part-owner of
“Morocco South” Station, on the
Balonne River, devoted principally
to the raising of sheep, while in the
past he was associated with others in
the proprietorship of “Redford,”
“Dalmally,” and “Foyle View”
Stations, in West Queensland. He
has ever had at heart the welfare of
the district, and for 17 years served
as a member of the Roma Municipal
Council, occupying the mayoral office
for a couple of terms. In 1904 he
was returned to the Legislative
Assembly as representative for the
Roma constituency, which seat lie
held for three years. He was num-
bered among the adherents of the
Morgan Administration, and actively
supported all measures having for
their object the improvement of the
State in general. A member of tlie
Roma Race Club, for many years he
has taken a prominent part in the
management of its affairs, and in
addition is a strong advocate of all
clean forms of outdoor sport. He is
patron to the Western Pastoral and

the success of this institution has
been due to the advice he lias been
able to give in matters having an
important bearing on its future wel-
fare. Mr. Spencer married in 1898

THOMAS JOHN PRESHO,
“Reedy Creek” Station, Taroom,
was born in the year 1874, at
“Coorada,” another station in the
vicinity of that town. He is the
MR. J. J. PRESHO.
eldest surviving son of the late John
James Presho, from whom the above
mentioned property has descended to
the present owners, it having on his
death been floated into the company
known as Presho Bros., Ltd., under
the respective management and
secretaryship of the gentleman who
is the subject of our notice, and his
brother, Mr. Richard James Presho.
The late Mr. J. J. Presho was a
native of the north of Ireland, his
progenitors having followed agrarian
pursuits in that country, but being
attracted by the glamour surround-
ing the far-away land of the
distant fields, and thus we find his
arrival in Victoria recorded as
having taken place in 1863. His
mining ventures at this time were
fairly successful, and after pursuing
the industry for some years he came
to Queensland, speculating in var-
ious ways, for about three years,
and making his home in the mean-
time with his personal friend, the
late Mr. Scott, of “Hornet Bank’’
Station, near Taroom. In the year
1872 he married Eliza, daughter of
the late Andrew Lawson, County
Armagh, Ireland. After this event
he went to the Callide River, where
he invested in copper mines with
disastrous results. Returning to the
Dawson River country he took up
“Reedy Creek” in 1874, a venture
which was followed by the acquire-
ment of “Sandy Creek” Station in
the same year. He devoted these
properties to sheep, obtaining good
results with his wool, the prices,
which ranged to Is. 6d. per lb.,
being considered highly satisfactory,
and affording a striking contrast to
those ruling during the Franco-
German war, when wool in the
grease was sold at sd. per lb., this
figure being a source of ruin to many
pioneer pastoralists on the Dawson.
The late Mr. Presho finding the
sheep did not thrive as well as he
desired on “Reedy Creek” replaced
the flocks gradually with cattle, for
which the country has proved to be
eminently suitable. In the year 1902
the old pioneer experienced his
heaviest reverse, the great drought
of that period proving the climax to
many vicissitudes by carrying off 95
per cent, of his stock. Nothing
daunted, the sturdy sire of his race
renewed the fight, with the result
that on his death in 1909—having
then attained his 74th year—he had

dealings with this primitive race.
Of his children there are living three
sons and four daughters, all of whom
had formerly an interest in the
estate, but two of the latter —Mrs.
Barkla, “Dunmore,” near Dalby,
and Mrs. Goldsmith, “Munbank”
-—sold their shares on their
marriage to the other mem-
bers of the company, which now
consists of Mrs. Presbo and her two
unmarried daughters (who still live
at the homestead) and her four
sons, two of whom are occupied with
the duties of administering the
property. The remaining two sons,

of a jackaroo on the home property.
His many-sided duties in this
capacity included the tasks of
shepherding the flocks, and of dam-
sinking, fencing, ring-barking, etc.,
there being in those days a vast
amount of developmental work in
course of progress. As time went on
his participation in these and various
other arduous duties rendering him
entirely conversant with both the
inside and outside workings of the
pastoral industry, his father, in his
declining years, learned to lean upon
the judgment and ability of his
eldest son, so that to all intents and
purposes, young Presho was manager
at that period of the property which
he so ably administers to-day. Dur-
ing his father’s life-time he accom-
plished several long droving trips,
laaving in his charge mobs of from
400 to 500 head of cattle en route
to the Brisbane River, sometimes
being hampered by droughts and at
others by floods; but whatever the
difficulties in his way, always bring-
ing to a successful conclusion the
task entrusted to him. Mr. Richard
James Presho, secretary to the firm
and co-director with Mr. T. J.
Presho in the administration of
“Reedy Creek” and “Ruined Castle
Creek” Stations, was born at "Coor-
ada” Station on December 1, 1876.
His primary education was received
under tutors, after which he
attended the Brisbane Grammar
School. Since his return to ‘ Reedy
Creek” he has shared most fully in
the strenuous work of building up
the herd and improving the two
properties, and is chief financial
adviser to the family. He is presi-
dent of the newly-formed Taroom
District Progress Association. He
married in July, 1914, Ellen Kather-
ine, elder daughter of Mr. James
Barkla, of “Taralla,” near Chin-
chilla, and formerly of “Donald,”
Victoria, and of “Glen Echo,” near
Cowra, New South Wales. Mr. and
Mrs. R. J. Presho reside in their
own home which occupies a site in
the immediate vicinity of the old
homestead. “Reedy Creek” Station

is situated about 79 miles by road
from the nearest post and telegraph
centre—Taroom —while 45 miles
farther south is Juandah, the pres-
ent terminus of the branch i*ailway
from Miles. The run embraces 135
square miles of undulating and
mountainous country, timbered with
iron-bark and spotted and river
gums; and is subdivided into num-
erous areas by fences and natural
boundaries formed by impassable
ranges. It is watered by Reedy,
Sandy, and Surprise Creeks, a sup-
plemental supply being afforded by
dams and bores. The latter have
been sunk to a depth of 400 ft., and
are fitted with “Southern Cross”
engines. In the year 1904, the
Messrs. Presho Bros. purchased
“Ruined Castle Creek,” a station
embracing an area of 140 square
miles, from the Australian and New
Zealand Mortgage Co., the nature
of the country being identical with
that of “Reedy Creek,” and the run
similarly watered and also sub-
divided into paddocks of suitable
dimensions. This property received
its name from the rugged rocks and
crags which form part of the land-
scape, and which, when seen in the
perspective, bear a striking likeness
to the ruined castles of an older
world. An unusual feature in
connection with both these jaroperties
is that they are practically free from
that tiresome scourge, the tick,
Messrs. Presho Bros., Limited, hav-
ing as yet no occasion to use the dip
constructed on “Reedy Creek,” des-
pite the fact that the adjoining
stations on all sides find it necessary
to resort to this method of coping
with the pest. The runs are also
free from prickly pear. The Here-
ford cattle bred on “Reedy Creek”
and “Ruined Castle Creek” are some
of the finest samples of that breed
in Queensland. The estates usually
pasture some 4,000 head, and, in
addition about 100 horses of a
useful strain, these being raised
from well-bred blood animals crossed
with a good type of hack. A new
bungalow has been erected on the
property. Although the original

completion he went to “Ruined

object of gaining experience in the

pastoral industry, being then at the
age of 15. Here, under the super-
vision of Mr. Sutherland, the
manager of the property for the old
Australian Joint Stock Bank, he
learned the first principles of the
grazing and cattle-raising industry,
his duties on this station occupying
a period of 12 months. His next
move was to “Gwambagwine” Sta-
tion, owned by Mr. Collins, where
he was engaged in a similar capacity,
and on leaving there at the termin-
ation of six months he entered the
employ of Mr. Frederick Atkins at
“Coorada” Station in the year 1888.
For two years he satisfactorily
carried out the various duties
assigned to him under the gentleman
who had in the meantime become his
father-in-law, and in 1890 was pro-
moted by him to the management of
the estate, his duties during the
above period having gained for him

experience embracing both sheep and
cattle. He conducted the manage-
ment of “Coorada” for the ensuing
decade, having under his control
some 4,000 to 5,000 head of cattle,
etc. In 1901 he invested in his pre-
sent property, “Stonecroft,” which
covers an area of 15,579 acres, and
at the conclusion of the drought of
1901-2 he settled on this estate and
proceeded thenceforward with its
development, his initial effort in this
direction being the stocking of the
country with 2,000 head of sheep,
which at that time had to be guarded
by shepherds. From this nucleus his
flocks gradually increased in num-
bers, but results were far from being
satisfactory owing to excessive losses
from worms, fluke, and other
diseases. Deciding that the country
was unsuitable for sheep, Mr. Becker
purchased a mob of store Herefords
from “Coorada” for fattening pur-
poses. This was in 1908, and the

results that he finally eliminated the
flocks and devoted the property
solely to cattle. Some years later, in
1912, he secured “Punchbowl,” a

is of the bungalow type, with

Mr. Becker married in 1888 Mary
Ann, daughter of Mr. Frederick
Atkins, formerly of “Coorada”
Station, and of the union there are
ten sons and three daughters. Of the
sons four served in the cause of
honour and justice by nobly fulfilling
their part in the Great War, and
Mr. William John Becker, the fifth
son, on his rejection by the medical
authorities on account of a maimed
foot, proved the loyalty of his nature
by the contribution of a whole year’s
wages to patriotic funds. Of the
four who were successful in passing
the necessary test two made the
supreme sacrifice and two bear
wounds which testify to a part nobly
borne in a noble cause. The four
sons referred to were all born at
“Coorada,” and their names and
records are as follows: —Charles

the year 1915 at the age of 21, and

action of his sons, is imbued with
the spirit of patriotism, and has
made liberal donations to the

FREDERICK ATKINS, owner
of “Coorada” Station, Taroom, was
born in Nottingham, England, in
the year 1836, and is the son of the
late Frederick Atkins, a mechanic
Mr. F. J. Atkins.
of that city. The former gentleman
received his education, and subse-
quently his first insight into the
trade of a mechanic, at his birth-
place, and later adopted the calling
of a lacemaker in the Thornton
factory, the Meadows, in that city.
The profits accruing to this trade
having diminished to a very large
extent owing to the Russian War
then raging, he abandoned his con-
nection with it in the year 1854, and
decided to try his fortune in a new
country. In this connection it may
boy occupied with the simple duties
of his calling had he been told that
one day he would become the owner
of a vast expanse of country, equal
in size to two British counties. He
also recalls incidents relating to the
stringency of the British law during
the fifties and thereabouts, mention-
ing the case of a man charged with
stealing sheep to feed his starving
family, who, for that offence was
sentenced to 21 years’ imprisonment
and transportation to Hobart. Mr.
Frederick Atkins arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1855, landing at Brisbane,
and subsequently obtained work
tending flocks on the Mooney River
for Mr. John Crowder. For 18
months he continued in this avoca-
tion, and his reminiscences of this
period of his life include several
stories of perilous encounters with
the natives. On one occasion the
lonely hut which he occupied with
another man and his wife and child
was invaded by a score of blacks,
who assumed a threatening attitude
and demanded of the occupants all
that they possessed. Young Atkins,
divining their murderous intentions,
and acting upon the instinct of self-
preservation, seized a spade, and
with this implement filled with hot
ashes cleared the hut, this successful
manoeuvre being followed by the
clatter of a horse’s gallop which
caused the blacks to beat a hasty
retreat. The horseman’s presence
was due to a report having come to
the head station from the blacks
employed thereon of the intention
of their evilly-disposed fellows to
summarily dispose of the hut and its
occupants. Mr. Atkins’ next move
was to “Canal Creek,” near War-
wick, where he obtained work as a

in the capacity of station carpenter,
and later, in 1858, took contracts
for general bush building, the
remuneration afforded by this

occupation amounting to £1 per
week, which he considered very satis-
factory pay. In this calling, also,
his instinct of self-preservation was
occasionally called into play, as
instanced in the circumstance of his
having, in common parlance, “taken
off his coat” to impress upon a
threatening officer in charge of a
depot the fact that although he was
prepared to fully carry out the
articles of an agreement he refused
to be unjustly forced into the ful-
filment of conditions not embodied
in the document. The well-developed
muscles of the erstwhile lacemaker

his lacemaking days in Nottingham

later times, realizing how wild a

of a shearer, who, on arrival at their
destination, attempted to rob him,
but without success. Subsequently

satisfied to abide by the terms

subsequently becoming the proprie-
tor of the Leichhardt Hotel, in
partnership with the late John
Ashton, continuing in this business
for about five years, when he sold
out to the latter gentleman. In the
same year, 1869, he embarked upon
a pastoral enterprise, purchasing
“Coorada” Station for what was
then considered to be an excessive
price, namely, £3,642 15s. 2d., on
a basis of £2,000 deposit, the
balance to be paid in six months,
free of interest. The estate embraced
at that time an area of 323 square
miles (its acreage including the
property known as “Reedy Creek”
Station, which then comprised 138
square miles of country), and was
stocked with 10,490 sheep, 60 head
of cattle, and 18 horses. The number
of cattle was augmented some 20
years later by the purchase of about
500 head from “Toweran” Station,
the property of the Barton family,
and in 1898 the raising of sheep was
finally abandoned. His next invest-
ment was in a station known as
“Thomby,” which occupied 180
square miles of territory, and carried
between 2,000 and 3,000 head of
cattle and horses, and which he
acquired by purchase from the Bank
of New South Wales in 1897. Mr.
Atkins and his wife now live at
“Stonecroft,” the property of his
son-in-law, Mr. Thomas Becker.
He married in 1869, his wife being
a member of an old North of Ireland
family, and of the union a son and
five daughters survive. The former,
the late Frederick J. Atkins, who
administered “Coorada” until his
death in the year 1919, was
born in 1878, and made his first
acquaintance with the three R’s
under tutors on the last-named
station. Later he attended the
Normal School, going thence to the
Brisbane Grammar School, where he
completed his scholastic career in
1892. Returning to the parental
roof he immediately entered upon
the duties of assisting his father in
the working of the run, being at
that time about 15 years of age.
His experiences in this direction
embraced both cattle and sheep,
his particular care and pride being
the herd of 3,000 fine Herefords.
After having worked industriously
for about eight years, he had so far
profited by the opportunities thus
afforded, and so gained his father’s
confidence by his diligence and
ability, that the latter gentleman
banded over to him the complete
management of his two properties in
the year 1900, these having prev-
iously been administered by his son-
in-law, Mr. Thomas Becker, now
owner of “Stonecroft.” From the
outset of the late F. J. Atkins’ career
as manager there was initiated an
era of extensive development, which
included ring-barking, dam-sinking,
etc., and later the sinking of sub-
artesian bores. With the object of
improving the breed of cattle on the
run, which numbered over 4,000
head, Mr. Atkins obtained brills
from Tindal & Sons’ famous ‘‘Gun-
yan” stud, and others from McCon-
nel & Sons, and from Mr. Wright,

of “Fairfield,” who breeds from bulls
procured from the “Wongabinda”
stud, in New South Wales. Bulls
from Mr. Archer’s stud at “Tors-
dale” and from Mr. Reynolds’ stud
at “Tocal,” New South Wales, have
since been introduced. “Coorada”
has the distinction of having never-
sold a beast under £2, even in the
days when cattle were at a very low
figure, and to-day the “Coorada”
cattle are amongst the finest and
hence the highest-priced beefers in
the State. In 1902 the young grazier
was overtaken by the drought of that
period, and out of the herds of
between 4,000 and 5,000 and
2,000 and 3,000 head under his
control during the early part of his
administration, on “Coorada” and
“Thomby” respectively, there re-
mained at its conclusion a remnant
of 365 head on the former property
and 150 on the latter. At the
termination of the drought he
travelled to Mount Mitchell, New
South Wales, for the purpose of
buying stock, this journey resulting
in the purchase of 900 head of Here-
ford cows from Major Menzies, at
a cost of five guineas per head
delivered at "Coorada. The 209
square miles of present-day Coor-
ada” is fenced and subdivided into
several paddocks, and is watered by
Turtle and Narrowie creeks, the
supply thus provided being supple-
mented by the output of several
dams, two wells, and one subartesian
bore which has been sunk to a depth
of 663 ft., and from which an ample
supply is obtained, an average of
500 gallons per hour being main-
tained. The homestead, which is
situated 60 miles from Taroom, on
the north-west Dawson watershed,
was originally built about 30 years
ago, and is a type of the comfort-
able, deep-verandahed, cool, slab
house of the pioneer, its immediate
surroundings being beautified by a
garden in which large red and white
roses are always blooming. Citrus
fruits are also cultivated in the
vicinity of the house, and thrive
excellently, the orange trees bearing
incredibly heavy burdens, one tree,
which has grown to a height of 30
feet, producing an enormous crop.
During his lifetime he prominently
participated in matters of public
interest, having been a member of the
Progress Committee. He was a keen
patriot, and had a roll of honour
specially prepared, which occupies a
prominent place in the “Coorada
dining-room, on which are inscribed
the names of seven of his nephews,
two cousins, and a “Coorada” employe
who offered their services to the Em-
pire in its “hour of trial.” He was
created a Justice of the Peace by the
Philp Ministry. He was a fine sports-
man, and in his younger days ex-
celled as an athelete, cricket, foot-
ball and kangaroo-hunting claiming
most of his leisure. In 1908 he
married May Justine, daughter of
Mr. James Stewart Campbell, of
Victoria, and of the union there is
one son and four daughters.


ARCHIBALD KENNEDY CUE-

born at Warwick, in the year 1898,
MR. A. K. CULLEN, SEN.
and is the youngest son of the late
Archibald Kennedy Cullen, formerly
of “Undercliffe” Station, New South
Wales, who originally hailed from
Kirkcudbright, Scotland, where the
descended on the maternal side of
the house, through another ancient
Scottish line, his mother being one
of the Meston family, who trace
their lineage back to the famous
Bruce, and who have contributed
many men of note towards the
history making of Scotland, their
forbears having been landed pro-
prietors both in Kirkcudbright and
Aberdeen. The founder of the Cul-
len family in Australia landed in
Brisbane in the year 1858, and im-
mediately interested himself in the
pastoral industry, his first invest-
ment being a grazing property called
“Undercliffe,” on the Upper Clar-
ence River, New South Wales, which
he acquired in the year 1859; this
venture being shortly followed by
the purchase of an adjoining estate
named “Rivertree.” Some years
later he acquired by purchase
“Boonoo-Boonoo,” a station in the
vicinity of Tenterfield, this trans-
action eventuating in the year 1862.
These estates approximated 400
square miles of territory, and it is
noteworthy that they all three have
now been selected by grazing farm-
ers, the holdings being blocks vary-
ing from 640 to 20,000 acres. In
addition, the late Mr. Cullen has
also landed interests near Warwick,
which has done so much to pave the
way for the present and future
generations in this fair land. The

career on the land. On the conclu-
sion of his course at this establish-
ment, he returned to “Arden
Dencha,” a property which was de-
voted chiefly to the cultivation of
lucerne, and in addition, to a certain
amount of general and mixed farm-
ing; and worked the estate for about
a year. Hardly finding sufficient
scope for his enterprising nature in
this occupation, he was induced to
accept the position of overseer on
“Tooloora” Station on the Clarence
River, New South Wales, in 1900.
This place had an area of about 200
square miles and carried 10,000
head of cattle, which were practically
under the care and control of Mr.
Cullen, at that time a youth of
twenty years: a fact containing very
palpable proof of his unusual ability
and gift of administration. He car-
ried out the duties in the above
connection until 1903, when, his
natural proficiency in matters re-
lating to stock being augmented by
accrued experience, he returned to
Queensland and launched into a pas-
toral venture in conjunction with his
brother, Mr. David Cullen, the part-
ners purchasing “Eurombah” Sta-
tion, a property situated twenty-five
miles from Taroom on the Dawson
River and embracing an area of 110
square miles. “Eurombah” was
originally included in the area of
“Hornet Bank” Station, the property
s
of the Scott family, but had been
made over to the late John Young
Black in consideration for services
rendered in the education of his
sons, by the founder of that
family in Queensland. The land
is highly adaptable for cattle,
and alternates between lightly-
timbered brigalow hills and coolibah
flats. It is splendidly watered, hav-
ing an eleven-mile frontage to the
Dawson River, and is favoured by
the possession of the largest lagoon
in the Dawson watershed. The
lagoon is two miles in length with a
width of 100 yards, the average
depth being 30 ft. Eurombah Creek
also provides a fine supply, this
stream wending its way through the
estate for a distance of 12 miles. The
owners have spent considerable sums
in improvements on the property,
which has been fenced and sub-
divided into paddocks which pasture
at the time of writing about 3,000
head of shorthorn cattle. In build-
ing up the herd, due attention has
been given to the selection of a good

stock-raising, which has since stood
him in good stead. He remained for
two years on the station, resigning
to join the staff of the Bank of Aus-
tralasia, under his father, with the
object of gaining a general mercan-
tile knowledge. Feeling that his
financial training was sufficiently ad-
vanced, he determined to strike out
in another direction, and in August,
1890, turned his steps to Queens-
land, on arrival in this State taking
a position as general station hand,
on “Waroonga” Station, near Mit-
chell. In February, 1893, he was
offered the post of overseer on “Eu-
rella” Station by the late Mr. F.
Dunsmure, and, within a brief
period, was entrusted with the man-
agerial post, which he retained until
the property passed into the hands
of Mr. Fletcher, the present owner.
In 1907 Mr. McLean decided to
start operations on his own account,
and, purchasing “Gundare” in part-
nership with Messrs. W. W. Hood
and Charles McLean, he embarked
on stock-raising pursuits, with good
prospects of success. Two years later
he purchased his partner’s interests,
and has since carried on as an inde-
pendent proposition. “Gundare”
comprises some 60,000 acres of good
grazing country, and originally
formed part of “Burenda” Station.

The run has proved admirably suited
to the depasturing of sheep for both
wool and mutton, being well grassed,
and timbered with myall, brigalow,
and an abundance of edible growth,
known as “dead finish.” An excel-
lent water supply is provided by the
Yo Yo Creek, with a good number
of waterholes, and by six sub-
artesian bores, and four ground
tanks of large holding capacity. The
run is rabbit-netted on the boun-
dary, and subdivided into twenty-
four paddocks. The homestead,
which was erected before Mr.
McLean’s advent, since that date has
been added to and improved, and is
now a most comfortable and well-
appointed residence, with electric
light throughout. The adjacent out-
buildings, including the woolshed
and shearers’ quarters, are substan-
tially erected. The woolshed is fitted
with twelve stands of Moffat-Virtue
machines, steam-driven ; and a wool-
room, capable of housing 400 bales
of wool, is another feature worthy of
inspection. A small herd of about
100 cattle are depastured, with a like
number of horses. The sire in use,

of the district, and has been a coun-
cillor of Murweh Shire for the past
eight years. He is president of the
Picnic Race Club, Charleville, and
a cordial supporter of all charitable
and patriotic movements. In his
younger days Mr. McLean repre-
sented the Roma district in inter-

Rev. Richard St. John Tyrwhitt,
Vicar of St. Mary Magdalen in
Oxford, and a descendant of an old
North of England family, originally
of Norse ancestry, of which the
earliest records are to be found
the origin of the name is described
in ancient lore connected with this

the D.S.O. He is regarded as a
brilliant member of the “silent
service” of the Empire, a naval
tactician of note and one of the
prominent men of the British Navy.
He served with distinction in the
Heligoland battle during which he
commanded the famous “Arethusa, ”
and subsequently took part in the
battle off the Dogger Bank in the
same cruiser, and commanded the
aerial attack on Cuxhaven. The
gentleman under review, Mr. Hugh
St. John Tyrwhitt, received his
education at Clifton College, and on
the completion of his scholastic
career, spent a brief period at home
before finally deciding on a career
in the land of the Southern Cross.
In the year 1883, while yet in his
teens, he sailed for Australia and
after his arrival proceeded to the
Burnett district where he obtained
a position as a jackaroo on a small
grazing property. He remained at
this place for a few years, gaining
experience in the grazing industry,
and some time later, considering that
the knowledge gained of pastoral
conditions was sufficient for his
purpose, he joined forces with Mr.
Edward Manning and selected the
property since known as “Yan-
darlo,” which was originally a part
of the old “Nive Downs” holding.
Messrs. Tyrwhitt and Manning
continued in partnership in the
administration of this estate until
the year 1895, at about which time
Mr. Tyrwhitt took it over on his
own account. During the previous
eight years, “ Yandarlo ” went
through progressive stages of im-
provement, and the last-named
gentleman has continued this policy
ever since. The result is that,
although not a big place as such
properties go, it is a well-known
producer, being capable of carrying
on an average 17,000 sheep.
Wool-growing is the chief end of
Mr. Tyrwhitt’s activities on “Yan-
darlo,” though a couple of hundred
shorthorn cattle and a mob of utility
horses are also carried. The property
is something less than 40,000 acres,
composed chiefly of open downs
country, and bearing here and there
patches of edible scrub. The
principal grasses which flourish on
the run are blue and Mitchell, and
there are many other varieties of
native grasses. Among the improve-
ments are sub-artesian bores, tanks
and dams, from which the water is
conveyed to the stock by the action
of windmills and the employment
of other up-to-date methods. The
present homestead was built in the
year 1909, to replace the original
dwelling which was partially des-
troyed by fire and though of such
comparatively recent construction
it presents the of one of
old-time station homes of the west,
comfort rather than effect having
been studied in its design. The
main building is irregularly sur-
rounded by others which have been
added as time and circumstance
required, the effect produced being
one of comfort and homeliness. It
is situated in the south-eastern
corner of the property and is distant
100 miles from Charleville, about
50 miles from Augathella and 25
miles from Tambo. Augathella is
the post town, Tambo, though
nearer, being inconvenient on ac-
count of its northerly situation and
the fact that it is out of the line
of communication with the chief
business centres. Mr. Tyrwhitt has
been a member of the Mitchell
Rabbit Board for the past 17 years,
and devotes as much time as he can
conveniently spare to the interests
connected with the advancement of
the west. He is a member of the
Queensland Club, Brisbane, and
the Warrego Club, Charleville.
He married in 1898, Alice Noel,
daughter of the late Joseph Carter,
who arrived in Australia in the
(thirties, and subsequently, after
having followed pastoral pursuits in
South Australia for many years,

districts, and to whom further

PATRICK TULLY, “Ray”
Station, via Adavale, Western
Queensland, is a son of the late
Patrick Tully, who farmed his own
acres on the banks of the Shannon,
MR. P. TULLY, SEN.
in Ireland, and combined with these
interests the business of a shipwright
at Kielnamally, near Drimnaugh,
County Galway, the old home of the
Tully family. The traditions of the
Tully connection extend far back to
the days prior to the Christian era,
when Ireland had received upon her
shores the Milesians, which became
the dominant race for many years.
The more modern records of the
family show that it extends back in
an unbroken line to 1517, and prior
to that date its representatives
fought under Brian Boroihme
(Boru), the Irish chief who early in
the tenth century established his
rule over a great part of Ireland, and
made great efforts for the civilization
of the country. At all times the
Tullys have been distinguished for
their active participation in the
stirring doings of their nation, and
their name has been well known
among the leading families of the
Emerald Isle. Thus their descen-
dants enjoy a heritage of which they
may be justly proud, the valour and
tradition of their fathers having
been handed down to the present
generation, the members of which
have manifested in various directions
the same spirit of courage and love
of freedom which marked those of
an earlier era. The late Patrick
Tully married Margaret Julia
McDonough, daughter of another
old Irish family hailing from County
Galway, and of this union there was
issue a family of sons and daughters,
several of whom have made their
homes in Australia, whither they
were preceded by their father’s
brother, Mr. Jeremiah Tully. The
subject of this article, Mr. Patrick
Tully, of “Ray” Station, was born
in Drimnaugh, near “Kielnamally,
on October 20, 1830, and received
his education at a private school in
the place of his birth. Being the
eldest of the family he was at work
on the farm at a comparatively early
age, and in course of time, on
account of the agitation caused by
the vexed land question in Ireland,
the young man gave earnest heed
to the possibilities of Britain’s Over-

seas colonies, which were brought
before his attention by the letters of
his uncle, Jeremiah. As a result,
with his brother, Joseph, he took
passage for Australia, and the two
youthful sons of Erin arrived as free
citizens at Sydney in August, 1853.
Their “colonial experience” began
with a journey on foot from Sydney
to Gouiburn, carrying their swags,
in the progress of which they met
with various adventures, their status
as “new chums” making the trip one
of considerable hardship. Arriving
at the station where their uncle was
living they made a brief sojourn at
his house, and subsequently the
older man, with his two nephews,
set out to try their fortune on the
Adelong goldfields, about 140 or 150
miles distant. At Yass their horses
were stolen, and they were forced to
foot it again, at length reaching
their destination, where they worked
for eight months with fair results.
Hearing of the discovery of big
nuggets in Victoria the two younger
prospectors left a camp bearing good
gold, and did the journey overland
to Melbourne, there selling their
horses and walking to Bendigo.
Disappointment awaited their efforts
on the new field, and after failing
to gain any substantial rewards for
their labours they lent a willing ear
to reports of a new field being
opened up at that moment. This
was “Simpson’s Ranges” (now Mary-
borough, Victoria), and thither the
brothers proceeded, but again “no
luck” was the order of the day. They
spent all the money they had made,
and finally Patrick, tired of the
run of bad fortune, moved on to
“Creswick Creek,” some 40 miles
away. Here, although the yellow
metal proved as elusive as ever,
stirring adventures awaited him. The
Ballarat riots taking place about this
time, the diggers were requested to
roll up and strengthen their con-
freres in their defiance of the
Government. Mr. Patrick Tully,
obeying the summons, met the
leaders, Mr. Peter Lalor and his
lieutenants, and assisted in the

since has become so famous as the
“Eureka Stockade.” The failure of
the leaders to secure sufficient fire-
arms, and the prompt action of

where some were bayonetted and
others captured, while the victors
set fire to the tents, and soon after
retired with their prisoners. Mr.
Tully recalls the sight of the
stockade in flames, and the conse-
quent misery of those concerned in
the encounter. Owing to not being
armed, he was unable to take any
personal part in the actual fighting,
but to have been present on this
historic occasion, when the miners
struck a decisive blow for freedom,
which eventuated in the permanent
improvement of the conditions under
which the industry was carried on,
is not the least interesting event in
his career. After the riot was
quelled he returned to Creswick, and
two days later to Simpson’s Ranges,
whence he proceeded with his brother
to Bendigo, where they worked for
three months. Mr. Patrick Tully
next went to the Ovens River dig-
gings, and tried deep sinking on that
field. Some time later, his brother
joining him, they worked claims on
their own account at Eldorado and
Woolshed Creek. They continued
mining at Adelong for somje three
years on their own behalf, until
hearing of a rich find at Kiandra,
on the Snowy River, they joined the
rush, and worked there for three
months with fair success. This was
in the year 1860. Returning to
Adelong they continued until the
following year, when Mr. Patrick
Tully, having entered the wedded
state, decided to arrange for a more
settled way of living. Accordingly,
when Robertson’s Free Land Selec-
tion Act came into force he took up
a block at Hume Creek, some 25
miles from Goulburn, which he
worked for 12 years, developing it
as a mixed farming proposition.
Meeting with much success in his
operations he determined to seek a
more extended area upon which to
carry on his enterprise. The
settlement of some of Mrs. Tully’s
relatives in Queensland directed his
gaze to the north, and he determined
to test its possibilities for his own
requirements. Starting out from
Hume’s Creek he passed through
MR. F. J. TULLY.
Adelong, where he forfeited a
selection, and travelling with bul-
lock teams carrying stores, furniture,
etc., was three months on the track.
He was accompanied by his wife and
family of three children, which was
augmented by a fourth before their
destination was made, a baby being
born on the way. At length “Thy-
lungra,” the far western home of
the Durack 'family, was reached in
the month of August, 1874, and
here a halt was called. A couple of
months later Mr. Tully selected
country for himself adjoining the
Durack estate, and eventually
the name of “Ray ’ appeared on
the Government maps. There were
less than half a dozen occupied
buildings farther out in that
part of the "Never Never” land,
and the block of 50 square
miles acquired by Mr. Tully was all
virgin country. Later he took up
100 square miles on the boundaries
of his original property, and even-
tually “Mount Fittam” (50 square
miles) and “Mount Erbine” (over
70 square miles) were added to the
earlier holdings, while still more
recently Mr. Tully’s sons have taken
up other country, bringing up the
mileage to four figures. The distance
in a direct line from “Ray” to
“Congie” (one of the stations) home-
steads is over 65 miles, and between
lie “Pinkilla” and “Terachy,” also
owned by the Tullys, in addition to
which a large holding lying east of
and adjoining “Terachy” is the pro-
perty of the soldier-son. The country
is watered by natural creeks, the
supply from which has been aug-
mented by well-sinking and the
construction of dams for conservation
purposes. Excellent fences protect
the boundaries and subdivide the
big areas into numerous paddocks,
and in every respect the stations may
be said to be well improved. The
homestead, originally built by Mr.
Tully for a family residence, gave
way in 1886 to the present structure,
which is built with earthern walls
from 18 inches to two feet in thick-
ness, and contains 12 rooms and the

to as occasion has arisen, and all the
comforts and conveniences of civili-
zation find a place within its interior.
The house stands upon the edge of

direction, being a good criterion of
the condition of the stock. In the
younger days of his venture Mr.
Tully confined his attention solely
to cattle, but on two occasions, the
herd being wiped out by pleuro in
the early eighties, he decided to
experiment with sheep. Disappoint-
ment awaited him, his first shipment
of wool, on account of the prevailing
advanced, and by degrees he sur-
mounted all obstacles in the pathway
of success, until at length the days
of anxiety were safely passed, and
he could rest assured that he had
attained the goal of his ambition.
The largest number of sheep shorn
on “Ray” Station in one season
reached 22,000, but since then
severe depletion has taken place at
different periods as the result of
drought, and in 1900-1-2 only 8,000
were left of the flock, not a bag of
grass being procurable within 100
miles of “Ray.” At this time of
stress Mr. Tully’s sons had to be
taken from school and axes put into
their hands for the wholesale cutting
down of the mulga scrub, which
grows freely in this vicinity; and by
camping in the bush with the sheep
for over a year a considerable salvage
was secured. Recently large drafts
have been disposed of, and at the
time of writing (February, 1918)
there are about 10,000 sheep upon
the station. Among the hard con-
ditions which had to be met in the
early days it may be mentioned that
Mr. Tully had to travel over 500
miles to the nearest market town for
supplies per bullock team; and
during his absence it was necessary
for his wife always to keep a loaded
gun at hand on account of the
treacherous blacks. Mrs. Tully on
these occasions had only her young
children as white companions, as
her nearest neighbour was 18 miles
distant ; but, with gun in hand, the
plucky pioneer wife hid her fears

the well-known Durack family, her
father, the late Michael Durack,
having been one of the adventurous
sons of Ireland who came with their
families to Australia in the pioneer
days. He was accidentally killed in
New South Wales a few weeks after
his arrival, but through his descen-
dants the name has become one
of the most prominent in pastoral
circles throughout the Common-
wealth, ranging from the back-blocks
of Queensland to the far north of
Western Australia. Mr. and Mrs.
Tully had a family of 14 children,
of whom seven survive—two of the
sons whose portraits appear on these
pages, having done worthy work in
the pastoral industry of the West
before joining the great majority.
OREST OF THE TULLY FAMILY.
The eldest, Joseph, who conducts
his own property, “Congie,” married
into the Bergin family (of whom a
notice appears elsewhere in this
work), and has six children. The
second, James Michael (Chum)

low prices, not bringing returns

ministration of affairs until her
husband’s return. Mrs. Tully, who
has always given her husband the
most loyal moral support and
his own account until the need for
men to fight in the Great World-war
became urgent. In response to
the Empire’s call he volunteered
and became a member of the


A.I.F. in January, 1916, and
having been twice wounded was in-
valided home as unfit for further
military duty. He sailed from Aus-
tralia in August, 1916, arriving in
England in October of the same
year, spending some time in the
military camp at Larkhill, whence
he proceeded to the scene of hostili-
ties in France. During his first year
of active service he fought at Ypres,
and was through the battles which
occurred at Polygon Wood, Menin
Road, Zonnebeke, and Paschen-
daele. He was wounded in the last-
mentioned encounter on October 4,
1917, and sent to No. 11 C. C. S.
Hospital, and later to the Boulogne
Military Hospital, and on his re-
covery was returned to the front
line in December, 1917. After some
months of further service he became
a casualty for the second occasion,
having been wounded on March 12
of the year 1918 at Spoil-
bank, where the Australians were
holding a hard-pressed line. He
was attached to the 43rd Battery,
11th Brigade, 4th Division, in which
he attained the rank of bombardier.
Both his wounds were caused by
shrapnel, the last having rendered
him unfit for active service. Bom-
bardier James Michael Tully was
educated at Nudgee College, hav-
ing been distinguished during his
scholastic years as one of the
Queensland political circles, and has
four sons. All Mr. Tully’s sons,
besides making their name in
the pastoral industry, have won
a reputation as athletes, Francis
having won the first “Queens-
land Hundred” when only a
lad at Nudgee College, while all
have put up excellent records in all
forms of clean sport. It is interest-
ing to note that Mr. Patrick Tully’s
younger brother, Francis, after whom
his son is named, was one of the
prime movers in the land war

Whilst Francis, who was evicted from

ARTHUR ALLAN ELLIOT,

father, the late Mr. Gilbert Stanley
Elliot, being one of the owners of
MR. G. S. ELLIOT.
“Geraldra” Station, Billabong Creek,
near Wagga Wagga, where, on
September 29, 1871, the subject of
this memoir was born. His father’s
partner, the late Hon. William
Allan, M.L.C., will be remembered
MR. A. A. ELLIOT.
as the first president of the Pastoral
Association of Queensland. The late
Mr. Elliot was born at Stratford,
Essex, England, where his progeni-
tors have been held in honour for
many generations, the family tracing
their descent from the ancient
Scottish border family of Elliots,
whose origin dates back in the
person of one, Robert Elliot of
Redbeugh, to the year 1510. Records
relating to these matters are to be
found in the College of Heraldry,
among the annals of those parts. The
direct founder of the present line
was Gilbert Elliot, of Stobbs, whose
death is recorded as having taken
place in 1637 who married a
daughter of Mr. Wat, of Harden
and Flower, of Yarrow, and from
whom the gentleman under review is
descended. The ancestry of this line
is identical with that to which Sir
William Elliot and Lord Minto owe
their descent. The late Mr. Elliot
met his death through a driving acci-
dent on “Shenfield” Station, New
South Wales, in 1874, when Mr.
A. A. Elliot was but an infant, and
Mrs. Elliot subsequently returned
with her children to the land of their
forbears. The owner of “Victo”
Station received his education at the
historical academy known as the
Aldenham Grammar School—one of
the oldest public schools in England,
which was founded in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth—where he remained
for seven years. He matriculated in
the University of London, and was
placed in the first division in the
year 1888. On the completion of
his scholastic career —at the age of
17—he was placed in the well-known
London and County Bank, where
he gained a good commercial and
financial training. After three years
spent in this institution, a restless-
ness born of the desire to visit his
native land caused him to relinquish
his post, and in 1893 he returned to
Australia. His first insight into bush
life was obtained as a jackaroo
at “Whyenbah” Station, on the
Balonne, since owned by Mr. Ross
Munro, but at that time in the
hands of his late father’s partner,
the Lion. William Allan. He spent
about four years on this and other
stations in different capacities, when,
feeling that the experience gained
of the grazing industry was sufficient
for his purpose, he paid a short visit
to England, and returning to Aus-
tralia in 1898 purchased “Victo,” a
property of 40,000 acres, building
the present homestead thereon. In
the year 1914 he acquired and im-
proved “Wittenburra,” in the Eulo
District, and these two estates, which
cover an area of 100,000 acres, com-
prise his landed interests. The home
property, “Victo,” is situated about
eight miles from Coongoola on the
Charleville line, and is devoted to
the raising of sheep, of which its
carrying capacity is from 10,000 to

are bred on the property. The
general nature of the country is
indicated by Mitchell grass plains
and mulga, the herbage being good
and plentiful. Artesian bores have


been sunk, and these form the main
water supply of the run. The home-
stead itself lacks nothing in the way
of comfort and modern accessories,
having been improved and enlarged
from time to time to meet the
demands of a growing family; and
the result is a typically comfortable
pastoral home. In developing his
Eulo property, “Wittenburra,” Mr.
Elliot has spent considerable sums,
erecting dog-proof fences and carry-
ing out other important and up-to-
date improvements. Almost imme-
diately following the purchase of
this holding he had the misfortune
to encounter the 1914-1915 drought,
which devastated that land and
other parts of the country during
this time, and in consequence of
which he, in common with many
others, suffered considerable losses
of stock. The property is now used
exclusively for cattle, though later
it is intended for sheep. The gentle-
man under review devotes a good
deal of time and attention to public
matters of both local and general
importance, and in the former con-
nection has filled the office of chair-
man of the Paroo Shire Council for
various other bodies and associations
of the district. Among these may be

H[STORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


ALFRED LESINGHAM
GADEN, “Molangool,” Gin Gin, is
the second son of Mr. William
Henry Gaden, whose father, the
late William Hart Gaden, was a
MR. W. H. GADEN.
native of the island of Newfound-
land. The latter gentleman entered
the British army, and was engaged
in the wars with France, eventually
selling his commission and coming
with his family to New South Wales
in 1840; Mr. William Henry Gaden,
who was born in England, at the
time of arrival being seven years
of age. The family settled in
Sydney, where, after about eight
years, William Hart Gaden died, his
widow subsequently contracting a
second union with Mr. Charles
Abercrombie, of the same city. In
1848 Mr. William Henry Gaden pro-
ceeded to “Walgett” Station, then
in possession of the family, where he
remained for three years, after
which he overlanded a mob of cattle
to Adelaide. The gold rush to
Tumut attracted both him and his
brother Thomas, but the success
attending their exertions on the field
was of a very varied nature, and
after some time spent in prospecting
in this locality and at Bendigo, Mr.
Gaden relinquished the attempt and
undertook the management of
“Widgee Widgee” Station, at the
head of the Mary River, on behalf
of the owner, Mr. W. B. Booth,
for a time. Mr. W. IT. Gaden
next joined the staff of Messrs.
H. Mort & Co., stock and station
agents, etc., while his brother became
connected with the Commercial
Banking Company, working his way
up through this service until ulti-
mately he received the appointment
of manager of the Sydney office of
this institution, thus completing a
brilliant banking career. Mr. Wm.
Henry Gaden, after a very short
experience of clerical work in the
business house of Messrs. H. Mort
and Co., found indoor life so at
variance with his tastes that he re-
linquished his post, and in 1856
associated himself with Dr. Wilkin
as a member of an exploration party
which had as its objective the opening
up of the country round the upper
reaches of the Fitzroy and Isaacs
Rivers, west of Rockhampton. He
continued with the above-mentioned
gentleman in all for two years, tak-
ing part in various exploring expedi-
tions, in the course of which they
discovered the Bowen River and the
present site of Townsville. He
shared with the rest of the party in
very severe privations, heavy floods
occurring and cutting off the means
of communication with places where
supplies could be obtained, neces-
sitating the dependence of the lead-
ers and men solely on the gun for
sustenance. So heavy and continu-
ous was the rain that for three
months Mr. Gaden found it impos-
sible to dry his blankets, and suf-
fered much discomfort, in common
with the other members of the ex-
pedition. He discontinued his
connection with Dr. Wilkin with
the purpose in view of de-
voting his attention to pastoral
pursuits, and deciding in the direc-
tion of cattle-raising, in partnership
with “Long” Ramsey, he took up the
“Canoona” country, with which to
found a station. Mr. Gaden soon
became deeply absorbed in his pas-
toral enterprise, and the gold dis-
coveries in that district causing the
usual frantic rush to the locality,
failed to divert him from pursuits
which he found to be the most con-
genial which he had yet entered
upon. Eventually selling out his
interests at “Canoona,” he came to
“Molangool” to assume the role of
manager on behalf of the owner,
Dr. Robey, of the “Molangool” pro-
perty, which at that time embraced
an area of 244 square miles of coun-
try. Some three years prior to his
arrival on the station a strong, com-
modious, and comfortable homestead
had been built of trimmed ironbark,
and with a small horse paddock
represented all that had been done
by way of improvement on the prop-
erty. After acting as manager for
three different owners, in 1872 he
formed a partnership with Messrs.
D. Wentworth and Tidswell, as a
result of which “Molangool”
passed from the hands of Mort and
Co. into the possession of the new
combination. Mr. Gaden continued
on the station as managing partner,
and almost immediately develop-
ment work was begun, substantial
drafting yards and several lines of
fencing being the first jobs under-
taken. The establishment of a
Shorthorn herd was next taken in
hand, and a sound start was made
by judicious purchases of well-bred
stock from noted breeders of this
strain. Started on such excellent
lines, the cattle made splendid pro-
gress, and the “Molangool” herd has
long been noted for its purity of
breed and generally good standard.
As the years passed Messrs. Tids-
well and Wentworth dropped out of
the partnership, and Mr. Gaden re-
mained sole proprietor until the year
1913, when the whole of his interests
were purchased by his son, Mr. A.
L. Gaden. Originally “Molangool”
embraced a very large area of moun-
tainous and gently undulating coun-
try, well watered by various streams,
which naturally attracted the atten-
tion of smaller settlers in search of
grazing farms. The first encroach-
men on the estate occurred in 1891,
MR. A. L. GADEN.
when a slice of 8,000 acres was ap-
propriated by a selector, and in 1897
a further 15,000 acres was taken up
by various farmers. Since that date
other areas have been cut out of


the old run, which though now con-
siderably reduced in size can still
offer a large area for purposes of
closer settlement without being seri-
ously inconvenienced in the carrying
disastrous drought of 1902-3 lost fully
a third of its herd. These losses,
however, have long since been re-
trieved, and the station now carries

take over the control of the cattle

had married before leaving "Canam-
bula,” and, bringing his wife and
two daughters to "Gracemere,” oc-
cupied a cottage near the head sta-
tion for ten years, before removing
to "Waterstown,” the present resi-
dence of the family—so-called after
the town of that name in County
Kildare, Ireland, which was the late
Mr. Kelly’s birthplace. Elizabeth,
the third daughter of the couple,
was the first white child born in the
Rockhampton district. Mr. Edward
Kelly owned large interests at Rock-
hampton, the whole of the area now
included in Bolsover Street, extend-
ing from the Leichhardt Hotel to
the old Cornstalk hostelry, at one
time having been in his possession.
He was a well-known personality in
the town, and his portly figure, six
feet in height, and twenty-one stone
in weight, was one of the familiar
sights of the district. His death
occurred in 1879. Mr. William
Joseph Kelly was educated at Rock-
hampton, and, at the age of fifteen,
entered commercial life in a mer-
chant’s office there, where he re-
mained for about five years. In con-
junction with his brother, Mr. Mark
Kelly, he then opened a butchering
business, but in 1891 disposed of
his interest to his partner, and,
proceeding to "Westlands” Station,
obtained a useful experience in the
sheep-raising industry. After con-
tinuing there until 1897, he found
his way to Mount Morgan, where he
was employed in the gold refinery
until 1911. In that year, with his
brother Thomas, he inherited from
the late Edward Gracemere Kelly
the "Banksia” and "Waterstown”
stations, in the Rockhampton dis-
trict. By mutual agreement the
brothers decided to retain the former
property, and "Waterstown” was
disposed of to another member of
the family. Mr. W. J. Kelly has
continued to reside upon the "Bank-
sia” estate with his brother, giving
his time and attention to the ad-
ministration of the property, and,
at the same time, he has taken a
keen interest in the advancement of
the district in which he resides, hav-
ing the welfare of his fellow-residents
close to his heart. Especially was
he an ardent supporter of the old
volunteer force, and, in 1901, as-
sisted in the formation of the Mount
Morgan Light Horse, receiving his
commission as first lieutenant. At
an earlier period—about 1891—he
was a member of the Rockhampton
mounted infantry, and, during the
shearers’ strike of that year, was
ordered out with his troops to "Peak
Downs” Station, near Clermont,
where he was stationed for six
months, enforcing law and order.
Among the officers with whom he
served, and who since have won
distinction, were Colonel Ricardo,
Major Jackson, Captain (now
Major - General) Spencer Brown,
and many others. Mr. Kelly

home under the supervision of a
tutor, and at the close of his studies
assisted his brother Edward in the
working of the paternal property. In
1892 he took a position as jackaroo
on the “Westlands” and “Tocal”
Stations, on the Thomson River,
subsequently proceeding to the “Ayr-
shire Downs” run to engage in
artesian bore sinking. He next un-
dertook droving work on behalf of
Messrs. Ramsay Brothers, taking
stock from “Ulam” Station to “Har-
row,” near Cambooya, in 1896.
Great difficulty was experienced in
this journey on account of the flood
which occurred that year and foot-
rot, due to the continuous bogs,
breaking out among the cattle, con-
siderably delayed their progress, the
trip being extended over sixteen
weeks. In 1897 Mr. Kelly engaged
in the assay department of the
Mount Morgan Goldmining Com-
pany, and, after remaining there for
four years, in 1901 he took up his
residence on "Banksia Station,
then in possession of his brother,
the late Edward Gracemere Kelly,
whose partner was' controlling affairs
on that run. He took an active part
in the working of the station, and,
some two years later, when the sale
of the noted ‘ Durundur” stud herd
took place purchased 130 stud
Herefords, which formed the nucleus
of the present “Banksia” herd and
stud. In 1907, his brother’s partner
having removed to “Wooroona,

he has been continuously resident
at the station, in the further devel-
opment of which he has found abun-
dant scope for his energies. He
married in 1912 Jean, daughter of
Mr. John Reid Clarke, of “Isla”
Park, by whom he has a son and a
daughter. The “Banksia” estate
originally was taken up by Messrs.
Morse and Turle, of Newcastle, the
last-named being at the time Angli-
can Bishop of Newcastle. In the
early days of its formation, however,
Bishop Turle sold his interest to Mr.
Sandilands, and the firm became
known as Morse and Sandilands. In
1900 it came into the hands of the
late Edward Gracemere Kelly and
J. O’G. Dunne, the former being
the eldest son of the late Edward
Kelly, who was born at “Gracemere”
in 1860. This gentleman, who spent
the whole of his life in Central
Queensland, was the senior partner
of the firm of Kelly and Dunne,
well-known breeders of high-class
cattle and horses, and dealers in
stock on an extensive scale. In ad-
dition to “Banksia” they owned
freehold property at “Gracemere”
and “Ulam” Stations, and also ac-
quired “Wooroona,” in the Dua-
ringa district, some 90 miles distant
from Rockhampton. When the
partnership was dissolved in 1907,
Mr. Dunne took “Wooroona” and
the “Ulam” freehold as his share
of the estates, Mr. Kelly retaining
“Banksia” and the “Gracemere”
freehold, which remained his sole
property until his death in 1911.
The Banksia estate comprises 119
square miles of leasehold and 12,000
acres of freehold country, consisting
of plains, varied by tracts of undu-
lating country, timbered with blood-
wood, ironbark, ti-tree, and ma-
hogany. There is plenty of water
on the property, natural lagoons
yielding an excellent supply, besides
which various wells have been sunk,
and fitted with windmills for pump-
ing purposes, with the usual engines,
supply tanks, and troughs. On the
run, which now carries about 5,000
cattle and 200 horses, is to be found
couch grass, spear grass, blue grass,
kangaroo grass, etc., and in time of
drought, “Banksia” frequently pro-
vides sustenance for stock on agist-
ment, as many as an extra 4,000
head having been provided for at
such times on the pasture land. The

as the year 1853. The former gentle-
man was born near Shoalhaven, in
the Illawarra district, New South
Wales, in 1842. His father, one of
the early settlers of the Mother
State, was a native of Inniskillen,
Ireland. He there grew to manhood,
farmed a property known as “Car-
neyholm,” and marrying, became
the father of a family of four sons
and three daughters before he left
the Old Country for Australia.
Upon arrival with his wife and
children in Sydney, the late John
Little gained his first experience of
Australian conditions in the south
coast country of the parent colony.
There he obtained employment on
various farms, and made himself
acquainted with the methods pre-
vailing in the agricultural and stock-
breeding industries under the South-
ern Cross. Having attained his
object, he migrated in 1847 to the
inland tableland, and in the vicin-
ity of the present site of the town of
Yass he secured a suitable holding,
and embarked on a sheep-farming
venture. This enterprise proved suc-
cessful, and having now thoroughly
found his feet in the new country,
the pioneer stockbreeder felt em-
boldened to launch out on a more
extensive scale, and in 1850, with
this end in view, he decided to
“trek” across country with his sons
to Queensland. The party accord-
ingly left the Yass district with a
couple of bullock drays, a small mob
of cattle, and 2,000 sheep, striking
a route to the west of Bathurst.
Here a strong temptation presented
itself to the young men in the shape
of the Turon gold-diggings, which
were then at fever heat, and their
father had much ado to quell his
small following’s red-hot desire to
plunge into the vortex of adventure
and speculation which was drawing
within its currents so much of the
Colony’s population. The grand old
pioneering spirit, however, stood the
test, and the “trekking” party held
together in their determination to
strike out for the country in the
north, about which they knew so
little. They pursued their journey
through Wee Waa, to Leyburn, or
what was then known as Canal
Creek, on the Darling Downs. Here
they made a halt to shear the sheep,
and for 12 months they remained
at a place called “Ellangowan,” the
property of the late John Gamie,
one of the pioneers of the Downs,
who gave them permission to graze
the stock in that locality. After
leaving “Ellangowan,” they arrived
in 1853 at the spot now known as
“Rosedale,” and pitched their camp
on a clearing about a mile distant
from the site of the present home-
stead. The late John Little, being
favourably impressed with the class

of country he had reached, applied
for three blocks of land, each 25
square miles in extent. These were
granted under the pastoral lease
regulations some three years later.
The country was wild, virgin land,
entirely unimproved, Mr. Little
being one of the first white men to
settle north of Dawes Range. Mucn
of the run was fairly open, well
suited to the formation of a sheep
station, and plentifully grassed with
kangaroo grass, the noxious spear
grass being unknown. The blacks
were numerous, but usually confined
their depredations to sheep-stealing
and cattle-spearing. Yet as the
white settlers never knew when a
spear would whizz through the air
from the cover of the scrub, or from
behind a tree, they always carried
arms with them, and held themselves
prepared for attacks. The blacks
respected these precautions, and evi-
dently decided that discretion was
the better part of valour, though
prior to the advent of the Littles two
troopers had been speared to death

site of the “Rosedale” homestead,

Maryborough, and all supplies were
procured from there by means of
bullock teams, which in good


weather took three weeks on the
journey, and more than double that
time when rough conditions pre-
vailed. Later on, when Mr. Little
had spent three years on the station,
he chartered a small schooner, called
“The Albion,” to run between Syd-
ney and Baffle Creek. This was the
first boat to sail up that stream. By
this means the enterprising pioneer
procured supplies sufficient for 12
months and shipped his wool to the
market. In the late pastoralist’s
time, the maximum number of sheep
on the station was 10,000, but about
the year 1860 a succession of wet
seasons set in, with their attendant
ills, to which this class of stock is
particularly susceptible, thus neces-
sitating the removal of the flock to
drier country. Cattle in large num-
bers were then introduced, and tak-
ing kindly to the locality, they
rapidly increased, in course of time
monopolising the full carrying
capacity of the run. Mr. John
Little continued to develop the pro-
perty with the co-operation of his
sons until 1862, when his death
occurred as the result of an accident
caused by a falling tree. Subse-
quent to this event, the brothers
carried on the administration of
affairs conjointly in the interests of
the family, which at present consists
of the subject of our memoir (Mr.
James Little) and his three sisters,
the eldest of whom has attained to
the advanced age of 85 years. Mr.
James Little, who, as already
stated, was born after his parents’
arrival in New South Wales, re-
ceived his education under private
tuition on his father’s homestead,
and at an early age was initiated to
the many duties which frequently
fall to a lad on the home farm. He
made himself especially useful in
minding sheep while still of tender
years, and as his strength increased,
and he was able to undertake more
strenuous and responsible work, he
found plenty to occupy him in the
varied departments of industry car-
ried on at “Rosedale.” He con-
tinued to co-operate with his father
and brothers after attaining to
manhood’s estate, and gave material
assistance in the development of the
property, where improvement work
was steadily pursued in the face of
much that was discouraging, the
usual setbacks to progress being
encountered by the Little family in
common with other early settlers in
the district. In course of time Mr.
Little was left as the sole male
administrator of the estate, and
now (1917), at the age of 74 years,
with the sister of 85 already referred
to, he represents the surviving rem-
nant of the original white pioneer
population of “Rosedale.” In the
matter of water “Rosedale” Station
is very favourably situated for pas-
toral purposes. The supply has been
known to fail on but few occasions
since the late Mr. Little first decided
to make his home in that well-
favoured district. The numerous
c reeks which intersect the paddocks,
and afford convenient watering-
places for stock, at times run dry,
but when such a contingency arises
a shortage is averted by the simple
procedure of digging soakages in
the sandy bed of the streams, by
which means an abundant quantity
is secured. The district has weath-
ered its full share of droughty con-
ditions, the first serious visitation of
tions nature experienced by Mr.
Little being in 1877, when very
heavy losses in stock resulted. The
1902 drought, which brought ruin
and disaster to so many previously
thriving pastoral properties, also left
its mark upon “Rosedale” Station,
where, however, the owners were
able to hold on until better days
dawned, and the country once more
took on its accustomed aspect of
well-grassed paddocks and freshly-
running creeks. A handicap has
been imposed by the inclusion of the
property within the tick belt, but
with the improved facilities for deal-
ing with this trouble, the ravages
of the pest have been reduced to a
minimum. The homestead is a large,
rambling, old-world house, pleas-
antly situated in the vicinity of a
large lagoon, which might almost be
dignified with the name of lake,
There is a fine garden, with walks
separating beds of luxuriant bloom,
where the sweet-scented wallflowers,
roses, and stocks, with other old-
fashioned favourites, make a varied
and refreshing blaze of colour. Fine
old trees, representing several varie-
ties of citrus fruits, prove splendidly
adapted to the local conditions, and
produce prolific crops, whilst many
rows of pineapples demonstrate how
well the district is suited to the

Since the early days when the land
was first taken up by the father of
the present proprietors under the
regulations governing such transac-
tions at the period, some eight to
nine thousand acres have been con-

mainder, which totals about 16,000
acres, is held under the tenure of
“grazing farms.” Mr. James Little,
in addition to his interests in “Rose-

Mr. C. L. MacDonald, of “Tubera”

they took up “Nindooinbah,” situ-
ated on the Logan River, for sheep-
raising purposes, and continued in
this locality until 1847. At this date
they sold out to the late Mr. Com-
pigne, and came to “Booubyjan,” in
this migration from the Logan being
accompanied by several other well-
known pioneer pastoralists. Mr.

in the year before-mentioned, and
his tender was duly accepted by the
Crown in 1849, but the lease was not
finally issued until 1862, actually
thirteen years after the acceptance
of the original tender, during which
lengthy period the Lawless Brothers
were in possession of the property
without any legal documentary evi-
dence of tenure. The annual rental
value was fixed at £l5, this figure
representing the estimated carrying
capacity of the country which, on
an approximate area of 11,500 acres,
was reckoned to be capable of graz-
ing a flock of 6,000 sheep. The
vagueness of the boundary line enclos-
ing this area, as indicated in the
document when at length it was
drawn up, reveals in curious and
interesting sidelights the lack of
accurate knowledge required by the
authorities for their task. This por-
tion of the document is worded as
follows; —“Name of waters, the

a marked tree or trees on both sides
of the creek, with a scrub on eastern
bank, on the west by very broken
country, on the north to marked

the line is estimated at from six to
seven miles from north to south.”
Two other leases (“Windera”), held
in the name of the family by Paul
Lawless, and supposed to embrace
16,000 acres, with a grazing capacity
of 6,000 sheep, were also equally
vaguely described, thus: “Con-

Messrs. Lawless brought with them


from the Logan district large flocks
of sheep in the charge of some
twenty shepherds, and, according to
their testimony, the blacks, though
in some cases difficult to deal with,
could be charged with no cases of
murder, their chief misdemeanour
taking the form of depredations
among the stock. On one occasion,
indeed, they actually drove all the
sheep up the Boonara Creek, and
spearing about 300 for their feast,
indulged in a great corroboree. The
remainder of the flock was recovered
without much difficulty, and no fur-
ther serious trouble was experienced.
In 1865, on account of the unsatis-
factory state of Mr. Paul Lawless'
health, a return was made to Ire-
land, when William Burnett, then a
child of three, accompanied his
parents. Mr. Paul Lawless died in
the southern portion of his native
isle shortly after the arrival of the
family, and his widow, with her
young children, returned to Queens-
land in 1870. In 1874 Mrs. Lawless
sent her two sons to England to be
educated, and in the following year
the gentleman under review entered
a preparatory school for Rugby,
beginning his first term at the school
in 1877, and completing the course
in 1881. After leaving Rugby he
became a student at the Academy of
Brackenbury and Winn, with a view
to an army career, the Royal
Engineers being his objective.
Eventually, however, he relin-
quished his intention, and in 1881
Upon the completion of this period

zeal to the business of cattle raising,

since. Though used in the original

policy has proved in every sense sue-
cessful, and “Booubyjan,” with its

Boonara Creek and its tributaries, is

Mr. Lawless has always been an
earnest worker for the advancement
of the district, and has occupied a
seat on the local Shire Council for
many years. He married in 1898
Beatrice Muriel, daughter of Mr.
William Walker, for many years
manager of the Maryborough branch
of the Commercial Banking Company
of Sydney, Limited. This gentle-
man, who has spent forty-two years
in the service of his company at
Maryborough, was the official to
receive the first parcel of gold
brought down by Mr. James Nash,
when the Gympie goldfields were dis-
covered late in 1867.
AUBREY EDWARD JONES,
of “Euroka” Station, Eidsvold, was
born at “Boonara,” Queensland, in
the year 1870, and is the second son
of the late George Hall Jones, of
that station, and grandson of the
late David Jones, founder of the
great commercial firm of Sydney,
which is still carried on under his
name. Mr. George Hall Jones was
a native of Sydney, the year of his
birth being 1837. In 1856, at the
age of 18, he came to Queensland
for health reasons, and became a
jackaroo on “Boonara” Station, the
property of his father, and under
the management of his brother, the
late David Mander Jones. At that
early period the station embraced
some 300 square miles, and was
used for both cattle and sheep, the
latter being shepherded, while the
former roamed at will over the vast
holding, on which very little

“Boonara” he took considerable in-

bodies; and in 1888 he was requested
by the constituents of the Burnett
district to contest the Parliamentary
seat of the electorate in opposition
to the Hon. B. B. Moreton, later
being returned at the head of the
poll, and retaining the seat until
1891, when he sold his interest in
the “Boonara” run to the family of
the late David Mander Jones, and
left Australia on a trip to England.
Upon his return in 1892 he pur-
chased “Kilkivan” Station, in the
Wide Bay district, consisting of
This estate, which in 1869 was car-
rying 23,000 sheep and about 6,000
head of cattle, was regarded as very
valuable territory, being exception-
ally well watered by Wide Bay
Creek and other streams, and pos-
sessing extremely rich black soil flats,
highly suitable for lucerne-growing
and other agricultural purposes. It
was only partially improved, and
Mr. Jones continued operations by
completing the general fencing and
subdivision of the run, and by ring-
barking, which had the excellent
result of increasing the carrying
capacity by 50 per centum. He con-
tinued to work the area as pastoral
country until his death in 1899,
passing with what philosophy he
could summon to his aid through
the lean years, with their attendant
losses and disappointments, and re-
joicing in the years of plenty, when
the aspect of the undulating, grassy
pasture land could not fail to glad-
den the heart of the pioneer. During
the 34 years of his residence in
Queensland the industry had under-
gone many changes, but in no de-
partment was the development more
marked than in the prices com-
manded by stock in earlier and in
later years. Until about 1897 the
value of cattle ranged from a few
shillings to £3 per head for bul-
locks, and, as late as 1898, store bul-
locks, four years of age could be
purchased for 255. and under per
head. In the latter year a distinct
improvement became manifest, fats
bringing £4 per head on a cash basis;
but no sooner had this better con-
dition of things become established

a few years the brothers arranged a
partnership, and upon the death of
the elder in 1864, Mr. George Hall

than the tick pest made its appear-
ance on “Kilkivan,” presenting a
formidable enemy to the pastoral-
ist. Prompt attention to the matter
of inoculation, however, together


with the speedy erection of
dips, probably saved Mr. Jones from
very drastic loss, the measures taken
proving effective, and relieving the
situation in a highly satisfactory
manner. In 1902 the great drought
laid its withering hand over all the
country, and “Kilkivan” was not
fortunate enough to escape, although
the loss of 20 per cent of stock suf-
fered on this station was low com-
pared with the average experience of
other stockholders in the Burnett
district, w T ho in many cases reckoned
their losses at 90 per cent. —a prac-
tical wipe-out. After the death of
the late George Hall Jones, the
subject of this memoir continued to
manage “Kilkivan” until 1904, when
he purchased a grazing farm in the
Kingaroy district, consisting of 5,000
acres of well-improved country,
excellent for fattening purposes. He
worked this holding successfully
until 1909, when an opportunity
occurred of disposing of it at a satis-
factory figure, subsequent to which
he and a brother, Mr. D. L. Jones,
purchased “Euroka,” near Eidsvold,
where he settled down to make a
jmrmanent home for himself and his
family. The “Euroka” country
consists of about 45,000 acres of
land, undulating for the most part,
with natural timbers of several var-
ieties, including ironbark, apple-tree,
bloodwood, etc. A rather strong
point of the place is its underground
water supply, and in this connection
it is interesting to note that the
precious moisture is said to have

been located in more than one
instance in the various paddocks by
means of the mysterious divining-
rod. In one case a well had been
bottomed in blue metal, but a drive
being put in a few feet led to the
locating of an excellent spring,
which has proved sufficiently strong
to supply 400 head of cattle with
water throughout the most protracted
spells of drought. The land
is well fenced and subdivided
into numerous paddocks by fences
strongly constructed with one barbed
and three plain wires. Liberal pro-
vision has also been made in the
matter of dips and drafting yards,
which are situated in different parts
of the run, thus rendering unneces-
sary extended droving of the stock.
Mr. Aubrey Edward Jones, received
his education at the State School,
Gayndah, and at the Maryborough
Grammar School. He took a keen
interest in all outdoor games, cricket
especially finding in him an ardent
devotee, and he played for his school
club in many hard fought matches,
during the latter two years of his
school days holding the post of
captain of the club. The same
enthusiasm in later years has marked
his devotion in matters pertaining
to the advancement of the community
in which he resides. At the
beginning of 1914 he was elected a
member of the Eidsvold Shire
Council, and in his third year was
appointed chairman, which office he
still occupies. Prior to coming to
“Euroka” he was a shire councillor
of Kilkivan from 1900 to 1903,
assuming the seat on the council left
vacant by the death of his father,
who had represented that division
for some years previously. He
also served as chairman of the local
War Council, which did good
work in the cause of loyalty and
patriotism. Mr. Jones was married
in 1898 to Muriel, youngest daughter
of the late T. J. Thompson, of
Strathfield, New 7 South Wales, an
erstwhile pastoralist of the Mother
State, who relinquished stock and
station pursuits some 40 years ago,
having owned or controlled, among
other properties the “Bonnie Boon”
and “Coomooboolaroo” Estates in
Queensland, where he played a
worthy part as a pioneer at a time
when considerable hazard, on account
of the aborigines, attended the
efforts of those who essayed the
difficult task of opening up and
developing the more remote portions
of the Empire's dominions. Mr.
Thompson, after retiring from pas-
toral pursuits, became a member of
the Sydney Stock Exchange, and
is now familiarly known as the
“Father” of that influential institut-
ion. Mr, and Mrs. Aubrey Jones
have a family of three sons.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


JOHN SUTHERLAND, J.P.,
of “Kianga” Station, near Banana,
is a son of the late Hugh Sutherland,
of Sutherlandshire, Scotland, and
was born in that County in the
year 1839. He received his educa-
tion at various schools in Scotland,
and leaving school at the age of 16,
subsequently took up duties on his
father’s farm. About two years
later he decided to try his fortune
in Australia, and in 1857 set sail by
“The Champion of the Seas,” which
on this occasion made the record
trip of the time, the voyage occupy-
ing only 71 days. Mr. Sutherland
arrived in Melbourne towards the
close of 1857, and proceeded direct
to “Greenhills” Station, a sheep
property owned by Messrs. Denni-
son Brothers, where he obtained his
first experience of pastoral work in
Australia in the capacity of jack-
aroo. After 12 months on this
station he journeyed to the western
districts of Victoria, making a halt
at “Dunrobin,” another wool-grow-
ing property, which afforded him
further opportunity of enlarging his
knowledge of the industry. He spent
three years on “Dunrobin,” during
which he became thoroughly familiar
with the conditions under which the
stockowners in the southerly portion
of the continent carried on their
operations. Determined to obtain a
yet wider acquaintance with the
land of his adoption, in 1861 he
came to Queensland, and accepted
a position as overseer on “Glen-
more” Station. Upon leaving there
he undertook journeys in various
directions, enlarging his experience
in every possible way, and eventu-
ally, having got some sheep together,
he “trekked” with them in search
of new country upon which to start
a station on his own account. As a
result of this venture Mr. Suther-
land became the pioneer on the
Georgina River, then known as the
Herbert, where the “Rocklands”
homestead, built by him, still stands
on the banks of the Mary Lake.
The story of his travels, as related
by his brother (Mr. George Suther-
land) in a little work entitled
“Pioneering Days: Across the
Wilds of Queensland with Sheep to
the Northern Territory in the Early
Sixties,” makes interesting reading.
With a flock of 8,000, purchased
near Rockhampton at the latter end
of 1863, and the necessary horses,
drays, stores, and other requirements,
a start was made northwards,
across Connor Range, by Colloray
and Nebo, thence to “Suttor Creek”
Station, where a halt was made for
lambing and shearing. The journey
was resumed in the direction of
Flinders River, and continued past
Conway and Mount McConnell to
the Belyando, where it meets the
Cape River, and thence to its
junction with Amelia Creek.
Beyond Webb Lake a belt
of poison bush was encountered,
through which the sheep were
rushed, none succumbing to the
pest, though the track was white
with the skeletons of thousands of
former victims. The Flinders was
reached in the vicinity of the pre-
sent town of Prairie, and the

journey continued past Mr. Robert
Gray’s “Hughenden” run, between
which property and “Telemon” Sta-
tion the country was infested by
millions of rats, which played havoc
with saddles, boots, and rations.
After “Telemon” the next settled
country was “Marathon,” owned
by Kirk & Sutherland, whence the
sheep were taken by way of “Rich-
mond Downs” to “Lara.” No satis-
factory country upon which to settle
having been found, Mr. Sutherland
decided to push on to Barclay Table-
lands, highly commended by Lands-
borough, who had conducted an
expedition in search of Burke and
Wills some time previously. Turn-
ing off the Flinders before Donor
Hill was reached, they steered for
the Leichhardt River, over the
Plains of Promise, and crossed at the
end of a 10-mile waterhole, where
a camp was formed whilst Mr.
Sutherland with a couple of com-
panions went ahead to reconnoitre.
The exploring party returned with
favourable reports, and the next
advance was made through some 40
miles of plains, covered with rank,
coarse grass, in many places the
height of a man. Here it became
necessary to get the teams in front,
with logs slung crosswise behind the
drays to break down the grass and
make a track, along which the sheep
moved in a string, with the drovers,
all on foot, no horses being used
for the work in those days. One man
was told off to pilot the teams, and
eventually the beautiful Gregory
River, a clear, pellucid stream, its
banks fringed with tall, straight
cabbage-tree palms, was struck
where the plains and the ranges
meet. At the junction of this river
with the O’Shanassy the party
divided, the main portion continu-
ing up the latter watercourse with
the sheep, while Mr. Sutherland’s
brother, accompanied by a black-
boy, took the teams through the
rough, hilly, back country, over
four streams (the Seymour, Douglas,
and Thornton Rivers and the Harris
Creek), a junction being effected at
the fountain head of the O’Shanassy,
where a large natural bore rises in
the bed of a deep pool, the water
bubbling up in the manner of an
artesian bore. A long, dry stage had
still to be negotiated before Mary
Lake, on the Herbert—the desired
destination—could be reached. At
length, however, after a journey of
some 1,300 miles, the final halt was
made after seven months’ travelling,
and subsequently the work of ex-
ploring the country, roughly to fix
on the mileage of blocks and the
area, was commenced. The country
then taken up comprised about 300
square miles, a portion of which,
as proved by a later survey, was
situated in the Northern Territory.
Mr. Sutherland developed “Rock-
lands” as a sheep-station, suffering
all the hardships incidental to an
enterprise undertaken in so remote
a region, in the midst of pioneer
conditions, and continuing there for
about five years. After leaving this
country, he accepted in 1871 the post
of manager of “Wallumbilla” and
“Killmorey” Stations, owned by
Fanning, Griffith, & Co., of Sydney,
both of which were sold about three
years later. Mr. Sutherland next
received the appointment of pastoral

Joint Stock Bank, in which capacity
he travelled over a great part of the
State, but relinquished the work
after a few years to take over a half-
share in the “Kianga” run, with
which he has been associated ever
since. “Kianga,” which is now owned
by a limited liability company, was
first taken up in the early forties
by the late Archibald McNab, who
died a few years afterwards. Mr.
Sutherland was original part-owner
with Mrs. McNab in the “Kianga”
leasehold and 7,500 acres freehold. It
is highly improved, being fenced and
subdivided into a number of small
paddocks, and the carrying capacity
of the land has been increased by
ringbarking operations. One of the
natural advantages of the run is the
frontage to the Dawson River, in
addition to which source of supply
a copious flow of excellent water has
been obtained by the sinking of 11
wells on different parts of the pro-
perty. Though carried on partly as
a sheep run until 1916, the station
called upon to undergo. Then it is
he feels the advantage of such
natural and artificial supplies of
water that may be available. The
question must be faced and settled
daily—whether it will pay to hold
on hand-feeding for an indefinite
period or cut out the enormous cost
of fodder and accept the resultant
loss of stock. At that time he was
successful in saving 2,000 head out
of the 5,000 previously on the pas-
tures. Mr. Sutherland has done his
share of public work, serving on the
property. At the time this partner-
ship was formed the station, which
had an area of 200 square miles, was
in a backward state of development,
but possessed good grassy country,
upon which a flock of 18,000 sheep
was run. The management was
undertaken by Mr. Sutherland, and
although many reverses have been
experienced, success has crowned his
efforts, and the prosperity of the
enterprise is now established. The

is now wholly devoted to cattle, and
the “Kianga” stud of shorthorns is
already one of the best-known in
Queensland, its bulls having been
sent to all parts of the State, and
also to the Northern Territory,
where on one occasion 240 head were
disposed of in one draft. Various
droughts have been fought through
by Mr. Sutherland, that of 1902
testing the resources of the run to
the utmost. Only those who have
experienced the conditions of a
severe drought have any idea of the

three sons and three daughters.


The late HUGH LUMLEY LAW-
LESS PYNE, of “Cloyne” Station,
who came to Australia in 1866 by
the sailing vessel “Young Australia,”
was a son of the late Rev. John Paul
MR. HIGH LUMMY LAWLESS PANE.
Lawless Pyne, vicar of Inch, County
Cork, who succeeded his uncle, John
Pyne, of Cottage, and took by desire
the name and arms of Pyne, in addi-
tion to his own name of Lawless.
The Pynes came of an old Irish
family, whose genealogical line may
be traced back until it merges in the
history of Ireland itself, and which
has contributed many brilliant mem-
bers to military, naval, and eccle-
siastical circles through its successive
generations, while among its repre-
sentatives sport has also found many
devotees. Among the earliest records
of the family occurs the name of
Dean Davis, who married Elizabeth
Sheaman, of Ludlow, and died in
1630; and continuing through Row-
land Davis, of Bandon and Cork,
and his wife, Mary Scudamore, in-
cludes among its later illustrious
names that of the Rev. Rowland
Davis, the celebrated Dean of Cork,
whose wife, Eliza Stannard, was a
great - granddaughter of Richard
Bayle, Archbishop of Taum and
Lord Chancellor of Ireland; Michael
Davis, Archdeacon of Cloyne, whose
daughter, Rebecca, married John
Pyne, of Cottage, East Muskerry,
the latter being High Sheriff of Cork
in 1802. Mary, daughter of John
and Rebecca Pyne, married John
Lawless in 1805, their son being the
Rev! John Paul Lawless, grand-
father of the gentleman under re-
view, whose wife was Alicia Lindsay.
The late Hugh Lumley Lawless Pyne
was born in 1848 at “Woodview,”
County Cork, Ireland, and received
his education from private tutors.
At the age of 18, accompanied by a
brother, Clement, he left his native
land with Queensland as an objec-
tive, his ultimate destination being
“Booubyjan” Station, the property
of his two uncles, Messrs. Paul and
Clement Lawless, and situated in the
Burnett district. The young son of
Erin rapidly acquired the knowledge
necessary to fit him for the manage-
ment of a cattle station, and after
the conclusion of his jackaroo days at
“Booubyjan” be obtained the ap-
pointment of sub-manager of “Mon-
dure” Station, in the same district.
In 1873, in partnership with his
brother, he took up land at Tiaro,
to which he gave the name of
“Woodview,” after his birthplace in
Ireland, and entered upon the de-
velopment of this holding. Subse-
quently he devoted a good deal of
time to droving and cattle dealing,
in the course of which he saw bush
life in its various aspects and became
thoroughly used to the roads, while
he also considerably augmented his
knowledge of stock in his capacity as
manager of several of the leading
stations in the Burnett district. For
years he held the managerial position
of the well-known old “Wetheron”
Station, which was one of the
original stages in the Degilbo-Gayn-
dah Road, and being thus on the
coach route he came into contact
with most of the travellers in that
region. The generous hospitality of
the bush was always freely extended
at “Wetheron,” and during the days
of Mr. Pyne’s regime there was no
intermission of this rule, and al-
though that station, with many of
the other fine old properties of the
Burnett district, has now been
absorbed to meet the demand for
smaller areas, caused by the increase
of population, the long, low, strag-
gling, vine-covered homestead build-
ings, set on a steep, green slope, will
long be remembered as the scene of
happy gatherings in far-off days. In
1888 the late Mr. Lumley Lawless
Pyne took up the holding of
“Cloyne,” so called after the town-
ship of that name near the family
estate in Ireland. This property, at
the time of its acquirement, com-
prised some 5,000 acres, which have
since been augmented by several
important additions. It embraces
freehold and grazing areas, cover-
ing some 20,000 acres of beau-
tiful undulating country, which
are watered by Cloyne Creek
and sundry dams. The property is
well improved, being ring-barked,
fenced, and subdivided into suit-
able paddocks, in which are to be
found the necessary dips and other
accessories to a prosperous and pro-
gressive proposition devoted to the
handling of large mobs of cattle.
The carrying capacity of the run
averages from 2,000 to 3,000 head,
and the land has proved in every way
well suited to the requirements of
stock. Mr. Pyne devoted a consider-
able amount of attention to the pub-
lic affairs of the district in which he
resided, and for many years served
as a member of the Rawbelle Shire
Council, in which office he frequently
held the office of chairman. He
married in 1889 Annie, youngest
daughter of the late Edward Mickle-
thwait, C.E., of Barnsley, York-
shire, England, and of this union
there is issue two sons and two
daughters. He died at Brisbane on
November 29, 1906, at 58 years of
age. JOHN LINDSAY LAWLESS
PYNE is the eldest son of the late
Hugh Lumley Lawless Pyne, ot
“Cloyne,” and was born in the year
1890. He received his education at
the Maryborough Grammar School,
and after a successful scholastic
career entered the office of Messrs.

“Findowie,” Kingaroy, was born on
April 17, 1862, and is the eldest son
of Mr. Charles Brown, originally of
Hamiltonshire, Scotland, who was

residing at Glasgow in the above-
mentioned year, this historic city
being the birthplace of the gentle-
man under review. July of the year
1865 witnessed the arrival of Mr.
"FINDOWIE.” RESIDENCE OF MR. R. S. BROWN, KINGAROY.
Charles Brown from the Old Country
to Brisbane, whence he shortly
proceeded to Harrison’s Pocket,
North Pine, and engaged in dairying
pursuits. After many years of
strenuous effort here as a dairy
farmer, he found himself in the
position to start the gentleman
under review (then at the age of
eighteen) in the grazing industry.
About this time reports of the
favourable opportunities for land
selection offered in the Kilcoy dis-
trict came to his ears, and therefore
Mr. R. S. Brown travelled northward
in search of good grazing country.
Upon arrival at Kilcoy he secured
“Walkingborough, ,, in that district,
which, however, soon proved too small
for his operations. After the passing
of the Lands Act of 1884 he visited
Nanango in search of larger areas,
and secured a block of 5,000 acres,
which with development yielded such
good results that in the course of
three years his example was followed
by his father, who joined him and
took up several holdings of a
similar area, in the working of
which he was assisted by a younger
son, Mr. Thomas Brown. Within
ten years they had shaped out
of the virgin forest four fine home-
steads, to which were given the
names of “Findowie,” “Belgrove,”
“Taswell’s,” and “Ballogie,” upon
all of which operations were in full
swing. The graziers of a later era
can hardly realize the difficulties in
the way of stock-raising encountered
and overcome by the settlers of those
early days. Prices of stock, at a
rough computation, were about 25
per cent, lower than those now
ruling, and the markets were both
distant and difficult of access. The
freight on implements and the
necessaries of life was so excessive that
the cost of living was increased by
nearly 50 per cent, upon that in
more civilized centres. Several
periods of severe drought made the
MR. R. S. BROWN.
preservation of stock at times a prob-
lem requiring energetic methods of
solution, the earliest of these being
the brief, but intensely severe,
drought of 1888, which extended
over 10 months, during
which period absolutely
no rain fell, and a heavy
mortality occurred among
stock of all kinds. In
1901-1902 this experience
was repeated, and the fol-
lowing season also was a
very dry one. On the
other hand, the Brown
family proved the truth
of the saying that the
great and ever-present
handicap of the Austra-
lian on the land lies in
the fact that it is always a
feast or a famine as re-
gards moisture, and they
were sufferers by the tre-
mendous flood of 1893,
which, though admitted
to be of great benefit to
the country in the long
run, in its immediate
effects was almost as disas-
trous as the drought, causing
enormous losses in fencing,
stock, and in other direc-
tions. Eventually, however, in
the teeth of all difficulties the


several properties were brought into
working order, and as showing the
completeness with which Mr. Brown
and his brother set about these im-
provements it is worthy of mention
that they constructed a private tele-
phone line between “Findowie” and
“Belgrove” homestead (a distance of
10 miles), by means of which they
were enabled to conduct most of their
business conferences in the evenings,
and thus save valuable time for their
work amongst the stock during the
day. In 1908 Mr. Charles Brown
retired from active participation in
the enterprise, leaving the working
of the four blocks to his sons, and
four years later the subject of this
notice, after his strenuous toil in
commission agent. Bringing to bear
upon his new operations the energy
and ability which had characterized
his management of things in the
past, it was quickly made evident
that Mr. Brown was determined to
make an equal success of his agency
work, and perhaps the most sub-
stantial proof that he had carried
out his purpose in a surprisingly
short time was the erection, some
two years later, of the handsome
residence in Kingaroy, in which he
immediately took up his permanent
residence, and to which he gave the
name formerly bestowed upon his
country homestead. Mr. Brown has
evinced in a marked degree the pos-
session of public spirit, and whilst
Shire Council those of membership in
the local Chamber of Commerce, and
ever mindful of the needs of the
suffering portion of humanity has
given stanch support to the public
hospital of the district. The School
of Arts finds in him an appreciative
patron, and he is well known as a
cordial advocate of all that tends to
promote the advancement of the
place where he has thrown in his
lot. With the declaration of war
against Germany by Great Britain,
involving the loyal support of every
portion of the great Empire, a new
development in public work for the
leading citizens in all towns and dis-
tricts was inaugurated, and only a
few weeks after the fateful August
developing and building up a fine
property out of the wilderness, had
the disappointment of seeing his
most valuable block resumed by the
Government under the Closer Settle-
ment Act, the tenure on which he
held the land precluding even the
secondary satisfaction that a due
compensation might have afforded
him. As a result of this proceeding
Mr. Brown decided to relinquish
life on the land, and to turn his
energies to commercial enterprise.
Upon the resumption of the "Fin-
dowie” estate he transferred his in-
terest in the other properties to his
brother, Mr. Thomas Brown, and
opened in business in Kingaroy as a

engaged in grazing pursuits in 1897
was elected a member of the
Nanango Divisional Board, in the
proceedings of which he took an
active part, holding the office of
chairman in 1900. In 1910 Mr.
Mr. Brown received election to the
Kingaroy Shire Council, of which
he is still a member. Since coming
into residence in the town he has
continued to display the practical
interest in the general affairs of the
community which distinguishes the
right-minded citizen, and there are
few organizations or institutions in
Kingaroy with which ho has not
been connected at one period or
another of their existence. He added
to his duties as a member of the
4, 1914, a War Council was formed
in Kingaroy, with which Mr. Brown
at once associated himself, and has
since given valuable assistance in the
conspicuously useful work accom-
plished by this body. He speaks in
the highest terms of the great im-
portance of the secret or confidential
committee, formed to deal with
enemy and other aliens, to investi-
gate as to their bond fides, and to
keep a watchful eye on any doubtful
persons in the interest of the public
safety, and in every way has proved
himself possessed of the strongest
patriotic and loyal sentiments. In
1903 Mr. Brown married the eldest
daughter of Mr. William Goodger, of
Gawler River, South Australia.


FRANK FOX, “Killarney” Sta-
tion, via St. Lawrence, Queensland,
is a son of the late George Fox, a

era, who came as a child to Australia

officer, after arrival in Australia,
Isaac Fox turned his attention to
laud selection in the Mother State,
and acquired leaseholds at Gerrara
and other places, where he became
engaged in sheep-raising pursuits.
His son, George, who was educated
under private tuition, remained on
the paternal homestead until his
twenty-fourth year, when he pro-
ceeded to Sydney, and opened in
business as a commission agent. In
1867 he married Annie Milburn,
daughter of the late Robert John
Elliott, of New South Wales, and,
during the following year, made his
advent to Queensland, where he
became managing partner in a large
firm of contractors, which tendered
successfully for the carriage of ore
from the Peak Downs copper mines
to Broadsound, then the port of
shipment for the mines. In 1877 he
removed from Broadsound to Rock-
hampton, establishing himself as a
stock and station and general agent
at that centre, where he continued
for about two years. About 1879
he took up “Lotus Creek” and
“Croydon” Stations, comprising
some 400 square miles of country,
which he proceeded to develop as a
cattle-raising area. For several years
following 1884, and again in 1902,
he suffered severely from drought,
and had the misfortune to witness
the most drastic reductions in his
herds. After the earlier run of lean
years, a splendid recovery was made,
and “Lotus Creek” and “Croydon”
were carrying from fourteen to fif-
teen thousand head of cattle prior
to the record visitation in the early
years’ of the twentieth century, from
which a residue of 5,000 only were
saved. In 1899, the late George Fox
purchased “Killarney,” a property
some 53 square miles in area; and,
subsequent to his death, which oc-
curred in 1914, the whole of his
landed estate was bought over from
the trustees by his eldest son, the late
George H. St. L. Fox, who, in 1914,
disposed of “Killarney” to the pres-
ent owner. The late George Fox was

an outstanding personality in Iris
day, and made his influence strongly
felt in the different spheres of life
and industry with which he was
concerned. During the lengthy
period that he had control of the
carrying business in which he was a
partner, when he had not less than
fifty teams on the road, each trust-
worthy driver was not only offered a
team to work out on liberal conditions,

without deposit or security, but,
if necessity arose, additional horses
or bullocks were purchased by
Mr. Fox and handed over to the
men to keep their teams at full


strength. In nearly every case, the
driver paid for and became the own-
er of his team —representing about
£4OO in value—within a very few
years. Mr. Fox’s ceaseless activity
as a pioneer in mining and other
operations was a well-recognised
feature of his career. Scarcely a
mining venture was started between
Nebo and Rockhampton that did not
receive his practical support, and he
was largely instrumental in estab-
lishing meat works at St. Lawrence,
which remained in existence for a
number of years. He was one of the
oldest Justices of the Peace in
Queensland; and he took a keen in-
terest in local adnßnistraJion, oc-
cupying for many years the office of
chairman of the BroadsoundX Divi-
sional Board, and at one time being
a prominent member of the Gogango
Divisional Board. His Parliamen-
tary career, which extended over
thirty-six years, began on May 15,
1877, when he succeeded Mr. Oscar
de Satge as member for the Norman-
by constituency in the Queensland
Legislative Assembly; but, upon
this occasion, he did not long retain
his seat, and it was not until 1901
that he returned to the Assembly as
representative for his old electorate,
which he continued to represent
until the time of his death. It has
been said of him that “Mr. Fox
left his mark upon more than one
Act of Parliament. . . . He was
largely instrumental in securing the

enactment of the Agricultural Bank
Act, which has done so much to help
the struggling selector throughout
Queensland; while the establishment
of a State farm, at Warren, was in
u
a great measure the result of his
personal efforts. In politics he was
the most loved man in the House.”
The subject of this memoir, Mr.
Frank Fox, of “Killarney,” was
born in 1873, at Sydney, and re-
ceived his education from tutors in
the parental home. In 1890 he
became actively engaged in stock
and station work under the guidance
of his father, and, after continuing
for six years in this connection, he
relinquished pastoral pursuits in
favour of sugar-planting, which he
carried on for some time at Mackay.
Not succeeding financially in this
venture, in 1898 he sold out, and
undertook the management of “Lake
Learmonth” Station, on the Fitzroy
River, the property of Mr. P, F.
Macdonald, where he remained until
1914. Taking possession of “Killar-
ney’’ in that year, he proceeded
upon its development, and has since
devoted the whole of his time and

attention to the administration of
this property. “Killarney” com-
prises an area of 35 square miles,
watered by Connor River, Collaroy
Creek, Yellow Creek, and other
water-courses. It is heavily timbered
in places with spotted gum, stringy-
bark, iron-bark, and bloodwood, be-
sides ' other varieties indigenous to
the district. Cattle of mixed types
are depastured on the run, which
has a carrying capacity of from two
to three thousand. Mr. Fox married
in 1900 Isabel Margaret Irvine, a
niece of Mr. P. F. Macdonald, of
Yaamba. This lady died without
issue, in 1909.
HENRY RICHARD BAUMAN,
J.P., “Tryphinia View,” Tryphinia,
is a son of Mr. Henry Bauman, of the
same place, and was born at Taroom,
Queensland, in the year 1859. He
received his education at Rockhamp-
ton, and upon leaving school assisted
his father in the carrying trade for
five the route covered being
that between Rockhampton and
Blackall. At the period the natives
were very numerous, and the teams
established a custom of travelling in
companies of three for the sake of the
protection afforded by numbers.
Every man included in the little
cavalcade was provided with fire-
arms, and the knowledge that an
armed watch was always kept proved
sufficient in itself to ward off attacks
by the blacks. At the close of the


period referred to—about 1875—the
Bauman family settled down at
Island Camp, a small block selected
under the conditions of the Occupa-
tion Land Act of the time, from
which they administered an area of
50 square miles of country taken up
by them for stock purposes. After
about a year, however, they were
flooded out of this country, and in
1876 Mr. Bauman, sen., removed to
“Tryphinia Vale,” whither he was
accompanied by the subject of this
memoir, who continued a stock-rider
ou his father's property for about six
years. In 1882 Mr. Henry Richard
Bauman relinquished his connection
with the homestead of his parents,
and accepted the position of head
stockman on “Tooloombah” Station,
then the property of Mr. O. C.

Beardmore. He retained this post
until 1883, when he undertook the
responsible task of overlanding a mob
of 1,180 bullocks from “Tooloombah”
to “Narrobin” Station, New South
Wales, a distance of 800 miles. The
journey occupied five months, the
season proving a wet one. In the
following year Mr. Bauman took
charge of another mob of close on
1,000 head, which he travelled from
“Boorandarra” to Moree, also about
800 miles. In the course of this trip
pleuro broke out among the cattle,
which necessitated the inoculation of
the whole lot, and so successful were
the precautions thus taken that only
80 beasts succumbed to the disease.
Another memorable droving journey
in ids experience was accomplished
by Mr. Bauman some six years later,
when in 1890 he took 1,100 cattle
from his father’s property, ‘ Try-
phinia,” to Muswellbrook, in the
Mother State, where upon arrival
they were sold by auction, when

they realized the meagre figure
of £2 17s. 6d. per head. This
trip extended over eight months,
heavy floods prevailing in the dis-
tricts traversed, and as a result of
these conditions food supplies were
dear and difficult to obtain, Mr.
Bauman paying £5 for a 1-cwt. bag
of flour, with proportionately high
prices for other provisions. In 1891
he became head stockman at “Emer-
aid Downs,” in the employ of Mr.
T. B. Moffit, and remained on this
property until the close of 1892,
when he turned his attention to
horse-dealing, purchasing a mob of

horses in Rockhampton, and travell-
ing them to Charters Towers and
Herberton. In 1894 he returned to
“Tryphinia Vale,” and took over the
management of the station on behalf
of his father, who was glad to be re-
lieved of the responsibility of control,
Subsequently, when large areas of
the run were resumed by the Govern-
ment, he settled near the old paternal
home, on a property to which he gave
the name “Tryphinia View,” and in
1902, the year of the big drought,
purchased 400 cattle from Mr. P.
Mahon, with which he restocked the
depleted area. In 1906, in conjunc-
tion with his brother William, Mr.
Bauman acquired the holding known
as “Honeycomb” Station, comprising
163 square miles of country, from
Messrs. McLennan Brothers. This
holding, which is copiously watered
by the McKenzie River and numer-
ous creeks and lagoons, has a carry-
ing capacity of from 4,000 to 5,000
head of cattle, and after coming into
the hands of the new owners fully
sustained its previous reputation as
a first-class grazing proposition.
After the death of his brother,
Mr. Baumann continued the


administration of affairs on the station
on behalf of himself and the heirs of
Mr. William Bauman. “Tryphinia
View” is comprised of flat, sandy
country, watered by dams and wells,
water being obtainable almost any-
where on the property at a depth of
about 100 feet. The property is well
improved, and subdivided into
several paddocks of convenient size,
each provided with all the necessary
equipment in the way of drafting
yards, dips, etc. “Tryphinia View”

descended from the best pedigreed
stock. The New Zealand bulls,

LAWRENCE BAUMAN, “Clen-
more” Station, is the third son of
Mr. Henry Bauman, who came to
Australia in the early fifties, and
after arrival in Queensland obtained
MR. HENRY BAUMAN
employment with the late Messrs.
Dutton Bros., of “Bauhinia Downs”
Station. Mr. Henry Bauman re-
mained for some time with these
gentlemen, and received a thorough
grounding in matters pertaining to
the pastoral industry. Upon severing
the connection he established himself
in the carrying industry, placing
teams upon the route between Rock-
hampton and the far west, which
proved a very profitable enterprise.
Later he took up an original lease-
hold from the Government in the
vicinity of the Dawson River, the
land being situated upon a tributary
of this stream, and here he resided
for a time with his family, giving his
attention to sheep and cattle raising.
In 1875, however, tremendous floods
swept through the country, and all
the sheep, numbering about 1,000,
and 300 cattle were destroyed. After
suffering these heavy losses Mr.
Bauman abandoned the proposition,
and in 1876 settled at “Tryphinia
Vale,” near Dingo, which he worked
in conjunction with a grazing area
of some 200 square miles in the same
district. The property consisted for
the most part of flat, salt scrub coun-
try, well watered by various perma-
nent streams, and in places bounded
by the Mackenzie River. This run,
which he developed as a sheep and
cattle station, was held intact by him
until about 1903, when portions of it
were resumed by the Government
and thrown open for selection. The
venture proved a profitable one from
the first, and in spite of the occasional
setbacks through drought —notably
in 1884 and 1897 —he built up a fine
herd of 7,000 cattle. The worst
drought on record, however, occurred
in 1902, when at least half of the
stock succumbed under the starva-
tion conditions that prevailed, and
owing to the reduction of area in the
years immediately following this
calamity, no attempt was made to
build up the herd to its former
strength. The subject of this memoir,
Mr. Lawrence Bauman, was born
in the year 1861, and received his
education at a school in Rockhamp-
ton. At 15 years of age he took up
duties on his father’s station, and
with his brother undertook some long
droving trips to New South Wales,
and other parts of the country. He
continued in his parent’s employ
until 1903, when he decided to
launch out on his own account, and
with this purpose in view selected
“Clenmore,” an area of between
5,000 and 6,000 acres of the original
“Tryphinia Vale,” upon which he
started cattle-raising operations.
Good results following his initial
efforts, in course of time he found
himself able to increase his holding
by the purchase of an adjoining
block, and is now owner of a fine
property of over 10,000 acres, with a
carrying capacity of about 1,000
head of cattle. “Clenmore” is a
thoroughly well-improved estate,
proper attention having been given

into paddocks of convenient size. A
considerable portion of the block is
ringbarked, and the erection of
homestead, drafting yards, dips, and
all other appurtenances of a well-
arranged pastoral property have re-
ceived due attention. Mr. Bauman

size and weight to any other he has
tried, in addition to which the black
poleys are great drought resisters, as
Mr. Bauman proved to his satisfac-
tion in the severe dry seasons of 1915
and 1916, when his losses, although
heavy, compared favourably with
those of many other pastoralists in
the district. Mr. Bauman is assisted
in the management and working
of the property by his eldest son,
Mr. Francis Henry Bauman. He
has also another son and six daugh-
ters. Mrs. Bauman is a daxighter of
the late Felix Fox, of Armagh,

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES


LAURENCE STEVENS SMITH,
“Mount Joseph” Station, is the
youngest son of the late Janies
Smith, a well-known apiarist and
horticulturist, of “Restdown,” Noosa,
who originally came from London,
where he was born in the year 1808.
MR. JAMES SMITH.
In 1823 the latter gentleman was
apprenticed to James Hopkins, a
currier, and completed his inden-
tures, which were for a term of seven
years, in 1830. In the same year he
set sail for Australia, and landing
in Tasmania in 1831, after a short
sojourn on that island continued his
travels to Sydney, New South Wales,
where he became engaged in the
leather trade for a lengthy period,
broken only by a few months’ sojourn
in Adelaide in the year 1835. He
also turned his attention to cattle
dealing, as is evidenced by a letter
from a friend, written from Rich-
mond in March, 1849, wherein the
latter gentleman, whose name was
John Roberts, offers to “gather”
certain cattle which were at agist-
ment, and deliver the same to their
owner, volunteering to make up any
shortage in the number. He also
advises Mr. Smith that the grass is
“going quickly,” but that the cattle
are “at present in good condition.”
In 1849 Mr. Smith sold out his busi-
ness in New South Wales and came
to Queensland, where he found a
profitable outlet for his energies
in timber-getting on the Brisbane
River, and later on the Nerang
Creek, where his special object was
to obtain the valuable cedar growing
there. Subsequently he resided in
Brisbane for some years, and was
engaged in ferrying vehicular traffic
over the river in a punt, which he
constructed with his own hands
whilst timber-getting on the Nerang
Creek, and which was the first large
punt used for the above-mentioned
purpose. Whilst on a visit to Sydney
he purchased a small steamer called
the “Nowra,” and established a ser-
vice between Ipswich, Brisbane, and
Moreton Bay. He went from Bris-
bane to Gympie, and during his
sojourn at this centre availed him-
self of the opportunity to get some
mining experience, making fairly
good profits out of the No. 2 North
Lady Mary Mine, in which he was a
shareholder, the reef, though small,
yielding ore which went as high as
17 oz. to the ton. A year later Mr.
Smith settled at “Restdown,” Noosa,
where he established a large apiary
and orangery, and continued there
until towards the close of his life,
when he went to reside with
his son at “Mount Joseph,”
where he died. The late Mr.
Smith in 1834 married Miss Sarah
Hannah Stevens, who was born at
Camberwell, Surrey, England, in
1817, and sailed for Australia with
her parents in 1831 by the “Arun-
del,” a teak vessel of 300 tons,
previously used as a whaler, a type
of vessel not seen in active service in
these days. Disaster was narrowly
averted at the Lizard Rocks, Sydney
being reached in September of 1831.
On her next trip the “Arundel” was
wrecked off Gibraltar. After her
marriage Mrs. Smith resided with her
husband at Parramatta and other
parts of Sydney until 1849, when
they decided to try their fortune at
Moreton Bay, to which port they
travelled with their six children by
the schooner “Mary Stewart.” This
little vessel narrowly escaped being
wrecked on Point Danger during a
severe gale. For 20 years Mrs. Smith
lived at Kangaroo Point, during
which time her three younger child-
ren were born. She survived to the
advanced age of 95 years, her decease
occurring at “Mount Joseph” on
October 12, 1913, after 82 years spent
under Australian skies. Mr. Lawrence
Joseph Smith was born at Brisbane
in the year 1859, and received his
earlv education at a public school in
the metropolis. In 1870 he accom-
panied his parents to Gympie, and
after completing his studies, engaged
in the butchering trade, in 1878
undertaking the management of a
business at Noosa on behalf of his
brothers. Six years later he took up
an area of land under the Act of
1876, comprising 5,000 acres, which
was further augmented by a holding
of from three to four thousand acres,
acquired by other members of the
family. This country formerly repre-
sented part of the “Gigoomgan” run,
and at the time was unimproved,
being practically unfenced, with no
dwelling-place of any description
upon it. During the subsequent two
years the work of developing the
property proceeded apace, and a
start was made to stock the run with
cattle. For five or six years Mr.
Smith foiught the uphill battle of
paying for improvements out of the
small profits derived from the stock,
and at the same time maintained
himself and his family. Gradually,
he converted the area into freehold,
until he controlled some 8,000 acres.
By the end of 10 years, as a result
of this policy, he found himself well
embarked on the way to prosperity,
and in 1894 he was able to increase
his holding by the acquisition of
adjoining country. In 1905 the
original “Gigoomgan” lease having
lapsed, he acquired an occupation
licence of some 50 square miles. This
land has been divided since by Mr.
Smith into four or five paddocks,
MR. LAURENCE S. SMITH.
securely fenced, and an excellent
dip and drafting-yards have been
erected—improvements of this de-
scription forming a special feature of
“Mount Joseph” Station, which is
universally acknowledged to be splen-
didly equipped with these necessary


features. In 1912 Mr. Laurence
Smith acquired the whole of the
interests in the estate which formerly

had been held by other members of
the family, thus becoming sole pro-
prietor, and having attained to this
run, some 25 or 30 miles distant,
which is known as “Glen Ronald.”
Like “Mount Joseph,” this country
is also well fenced and provided with
dips and stockyards, and a great deal
of improvement work of another kind
eradicate by the best known means,
with gratifying success. Prior to the
time of taking up this area on “Ban
Ban,” Mr. Smith purchased from
the Downs Investment Company the
balance of the “Ban Ban” herd, to-
gether with the use of the run for
this stock, which included some 2,000
head of Herefords, and for some 12
months he occupied this area (106
square miles), at the end of which
period the leases were surrendered
to the Government and the country
thrown open for selection. “Glen
Ronald” has a comfortable home-
stead, which is used by Mr. Smith
and his family as an occasional resi-
dence when they desire a change
from their usual abode to a region
nearer the coast. In 1914 the gentle-
man under review purchased the
freehold of “Glenbar” run, situated
near Brooweena, comprising 7,600
acres, also taking over the occupation
licence of 130 square miles, together
with some 1,200 head of cattle. After
holding this lease for some consider-
able time, he surrendered it to the
Government. The country surround-
ing “Mount Joseph” is undulating in
character, and consists mainly of
chocolate soil, interspersed with lime-
stone and gravelly ridges. The water
suppty is all that could be desired,
creeks wending their way through the
estate in every direction. At “Glen
Ronald” well-grassed ridges alternate
position, in the same year he took up
8,000 acres of grazing and agricul-
tural farms on the old “Ban Ban”

has also been accomplished, much of
the land being infested with pear,
which Mr. Smith has endeavoured to
witli basaltic flats, tlie Boramba and
bandy Creeks, with other freely-
flowing streams providing an ample


water supply. Among other objects
of interest to be seen at “Mount
Joseph” is a collection of coins, some
of which date back to the sixteenth
1772 and inscribed “Yarmouth
Halfpenny” round the presentment
of a full-rigged ship, with three sea-
lions on a shield and a laurel wreath

1906 Jessie, only daughter of Captain
A. D. Smith, of Brisbane, the issue
being two sons.


MACKENZIE BROTHERS,
“Tooloombah” Station, in the Port
Curtis district. (Proprietors: Hugh
Mackenzie and Murdo Mackenzie.)
The gentlemen under review are sons
MR. HUGH MACKENZIE.
of Mr. Hugh Mackenzie, of “Hun-
donnell,” Ross and Cromarty, Scot-
land, and of "Terrara,” New South
Wales, and were born at Bundanon
in 1877 and 1886 respectively. The
Mackenzie family originally came
from Ardross, Scotland, where, for
generations, they were landed pro-
prietors of some note. About 150
years ago “Ardross” passed out of
the family, and “Duudonueir’ was
purchased from another member of
the clan, the Mackenzies becoming
the Lairds of Dundonnell, which
position they since have continued
to occupy. The Dundonnell Estate
consists of about 70,000 acres of
farming land, deer forests, and graz-
ing country, and with it is included
the prerogative of the ocean rights
as far as the three-mile limit. To-
day the family receives £3OO per an-
num from the fishermen who net
these waters. In the thirties Dr.
Kenneth Mackenzie came to Aus-
tralia, and settled in the Shoalhaven
district, New South Wales, where
he practised his profession and also
acquired certain pastoral properties
in the district—where also it is re-
corded of him that he placed his pro-
fessional services at the disposal of
the poorer settlers, foregoing his
usual fee. This gentleman married
an Australian lady, and Mr. Hugh
Mackenzie, father of the present
owners of “Tooloombah,” was born
of the marriage in 1845. Educated
at the Sydney Grammar School, Mr.
Hugh Mackenzie subsequently entered
upon grazing pursuits in the Shoal-
haven district, and early in the
eighties succeeded his brother to
the Dundonnell Estates, in Scot-
land. He proceeded to the old
country to take possession of his in-
heritance, but subsequently returned

to the land of his adoption
with a view to disposing of his New
South Wales estates, his intention
being ultimately to take up his per-
manent residence in Scotland. The

property of about 1,000 acres on the
Shoalhaven River, being in the
market, Mr. Mackenzie yielded to
the temptation to purchase, and

resigning the idea of returning to
Scotland, where he had found the
climatic conditions rather severe
after the milder conditions of New
South Wales, he settled down in
his new home, where
he still resides. He
married in 1876 a
daughter of the late
T. T. Bidulph, of
Shoalhaven, a mem-
ber of another old
family who came to
Australia in the ear-
ly days for the pur-
pose of carving out a
career for himself,
the issue of the union
being eleven children,
including two sons,
Messrs. Hugh and
Murdo Mackenzie.
Mr. Hugh Macken-
zie, the elder of the
two brothers, was
educated at the Syd-
ney Grammar School,
and upon completing
his scholastic career
at the age of 19 years
returned to the pater-
nal homestead on the Shoalhaven,
where he remained until 1901, when
ho proceeded to Scotland to visit the
family seat at Dundonnell. After
remaining in the home of his


forefathers for about twelve months
he returned to Australia in 1902, and
in 1903 he married Florence,
daughter of Mr. W. F. Harrington,
managing director of Walkers, Lim-
ited, Maryborough. In
the same year Mr. and
Mrs. Hugh Mackenzie
sailed for Scotland, and
for the next five years
made “Dundonnell” their
home. Upon his arrival
once more in Australia,
Mr. Mackenzie, in con-
junction with his brother
Murdo, purchased “Too-
loombah” run, Queens-
land, in 1908 again visit-
ing Scotland, returning in
1909 after a few months’
sojourn, since when he
has made his permanent
residence in this State.
Mr. Murdo Mackenzie,
subsequent to the conclu-
sion of his education at
the Sydney Grammar
School when twenty-one
years of age, undertook
the duties of manager of the “Too-
loombah” run, the purchase of
which had been completed earlier in
the year. Marked prosperity has
attended the efforts of the Mac-
kenzie brothers, who are regarded as

there are various wells, situated in

administrative principles. These
properties are “Barwon Park,” an
area of 270 square miles, situated
on the Mackenzie River and carrying
6,000 cattle, which were acquired
in 1909; “Cluen,” in the Clermont
district, comprising 30,000 acres, pur-
chased in 1912; and “Lotus Creek”

firm in 1915. “Tooloombah,” the
home station, consists of undulating
with windmills, which augment the
supply yielded by the natural creeks,
and render the watering of the stock
an easy matter. The homestead, sit-
uated on a low range of hills


overlooking a stretch of plain, is built
on the bungalow design and is a large
and commodious residence. Every
attention has been given to comfort

When the pure Hill River stock
was no longer procurable, the
Messrs. Mackenzie directed their
attention to studs nearer home, and


Hereford bulls were secured from
“local” Station, New South Wales,
and from Mr. J. A. Beattie’s well-
known Victorian herd. A departure
recently has been made in the pur-
chase of about 36 black polled heifers
from the stud of Mr. F. White, of
“Boldblair,” New South Wales, and
a stud bull from “Edinglassie,”
also in that State. A large amount
of money has been expended in this
direction, and Messrs. Mackenzie
Bros, have set themselves a high
standard, nothing but the best types
gaining their approval. During the
ten years that the brothers have
been actively concerned in grazing
pursuits, the herd, which originally
was composed of from 4,000 to 5,000
cattle, has increased to some 20,000
head, whilst the area of country
administered has been quadrupled.
The value of this stock also has more
than doubled, the present price,
which averages about <£ll per head,
having risen from £5, which was
regarded as an ordinary figure a
decade since. The firm has met with
the usual setbacks and disappoint-
ments inseparable from pastoral
operations, and the present pitch of
excellence only has been reached by
steady persistence and perseverance
in spite of all untoward vicissitudes.

spends his time travelling from
station to station, thus keep-
ing the management of the
various runs under his own
personal observation, those
entrusted with the local con-
trol being responsible only to
his direct supervision. A man
of affairs, and interested in
the advancement of the district,
he serves as a councillor of the
Broadsound Shire, and with his


brother is distinguished for the sup-
port he accords to all movements of
a patriotic nature. The Messrs.
M ackenzie are keen sportsmen, and
participate in racing events purely
for the sake of the sport, betting of
any description having no attraction
for either gentleman. Mr. Hugh
Mackenzie is an adept with the gun,
and whilst in Scotland thoroughly
enjoyed deer shooting on the family
estate.
SIDNEY NORTH INNES,
“Walla” Station, via Gin Gin,
Queensland, was born at Banbury,
Oxfordshire, England, in 1864, and
is the third son of Mr. James Innes,
who carried on a land agency busi-
ness for many years in that County.
Upon the conclusion of his educa-
tion, which he received at the High
School, Edinburgh, he decided to
try his fortune in Australia in com-
pany with an elder brother (James
Sjoencer), the other remaining bro-
ther (John Robert) electing to stay
behind and study law. The last-
named gentleman eventually became
a barrister, and in 1900 was ap-
pointed a Judge of the Malay Straits
Settlement Court. Mr. Sidney North
Innes and his elder brother, after
first landing at Sydney, almost im-
mediately continued their journey to
Queensland, where they arrived in
1881. For the sake of obtaining the
necessary experience, they accepted
the invitation of an uncle, Mr.
William Spencer, to undertake work
among the stock on his station,
of a riding accident which ended
fatally. Having gained an excellent
acquaintance with the numerous de-
tails of the sheep and cattle industry
and made good headway in the

accomplishment of his ambition to
become an expert in the handling of
stock, he left “Ironbark” to learn
the profession of a surveyor under
Mr. Stuart Russell. From Towns-
ville, where he received his initial
training, he passed on to Maranoa,
and afterwards served for some time
with Mr. F. B. Campbell, deputy
surveyor-general in the Brisbane
district. Receiving his surveyor’s
licence, Mr. Innes followed his call-
ing in and around the Moreton Bay
the “Cresswell Downs” run, in the
Northern Territory, comprising 2,000
square miles, and carrying some
4,000 head of cattle of mixed breeds,
and the two gentlemen started
operations in this far-off outpost of
the Empire. Here, as at “Iron-
bark,” a tragic circumstance at-
tended the early years of Mr. Innes’
connection with the district, his
partner being killed by the blacks,
who had stolen firearms from the
station and used them for this fell
purpose. Seizing all the weapons of
defence on the station, with the
exception of the revolver carried by
Mr. Innes, the aboriginal hands
escaped to the bush, where they
joined the Myall blacks, who were
strong and numerous. Mr. Innes
rode off to the nearest station, 60
miles distant, and mustered the
white men of the district to his aid,
and for a fortnight they followed the
blacks, finally overtaking them and
demanding the surrender of the man
who had actually committed the
murder. After some trouble the
offender was handed over to the
police, and having stood his trial at
Port Darwin was sentenced to penal
servitude for life. Upon his return
to the station Mr. Innes found peace
restored, and purchasing Mr. Perry’s
share in the property he forthwith
settled down to its development.
Although frequently without any
companions but a Chinese cook and
black boys on the place, throughout
the remainder of his sojourn there
he was never again molested by the
natives. He met with considerable
“Ironbark,” on the Liverpool
Plains, New South Wales. During
the four years that he spent on this
property Mr. Innes had the misfor-
tune to lose his brother as the result

district until nearly 30 years of age,
when he decided to relinquish sur-
veying and return to pastoral pur-
suits. In 1895, in partnership with
the late T. A. Perry, he purchased
success in his proposition, despite
drought and other trying conditions,
the cattle on the run slowly increasing
to 6,000 head, exclusive of the sales
that were continually depleting the


ranks. In the eaxdier days of his
venture very low prices for cattle
were ruling, and the long droving
trips necessary to market the stock
were a severe tax on the time and
energies of the stockholder. Mr.
Innes at times overlanded mobs to
Port Darwin and Burketown, 700
and 400 miles distant respectively,
at a period when fats realised from
£2 ss. per head and breeders sold
at 12s. 6d. per head. To give em-
phasis to the low value set on cattle
in those days, it may he noted that
a mob of 1,000 head was driven
from the Macarthur River Station,
in the Northern Territory, to Vic-
toria, and upon arrival there was
sold to the highest bidder, the result
being that the figure realized was
Is. 6d. below the expenses incurred
in droving and commission, making
it necessary for the unfortunate
breeders to send down a cheque for
£75 to discharge the remaining
liability. Mr. Innes on one
occasion sold a mob of 500
breeders at 12s. 6d. per head to
a man who intended to stock a sta-
tion in Western Australia, but dis-
covering that the cheque paid by
this individual was of no value he
followed him 700 miles across coun-
try, and pulling him up on the
border of a Western Australian
station, compelled him to proceed

to the nearest telegraph station
at Hall’s Creek, Kimberley, where he
arranged by wire to receive his cash
in place of the valueless cheque. In
1902 the drought was exceptionally
severe, and when at length it broke
Mr. Innes mustered from 3,000 to
4,000 cattle, which he travelled
into Queensland in mobs of 1,000
head. Considerable improvement
in values had taken place as a
consequence of the disastrous effects
.of the drought, and these cattle
realised from £3 to £5 per head.
This was in 1904, about which time
Mr. Innes, tiring of his lonely life
at “Cresswell Downs,” decided to
follow his cattle to more civilized
regions, which necessitated a long
and wearisome journey. With horses
and packhorses he travelled the 550
miles from “Cresswell Downs” to
Cloncurry, at which point he sold his
horses and travelled per Cobb & Co.
to Longreach, via Winton, a distance
of 400 miles. From there he took
the train to Rockhampton, and con-
tinued his journey from that point
by rail to Adelaide, thus making
RIVER VIEW.
what was perhaps a record journey
round and across more than half
of Australia. From Adelaide he
boarded a P. & O. liner bound for
England, and bade farewell to Aus-
tralia for a time. Before reaching
Aden the boat encountered the
Russian Baltic Fleet, on its way out
to give battle to the Japanese, and
was for some time under the play of
the Russian searchlights. Nothing
happened, however, and in due
course Mr. Innes safely reached
England, after an absence of 24
years, the greater part of which had
been spent in the “Never-Never”
country, with only occasional asso-
ciation with white men. The green
fields of old England, the warm
welcome of relatives, the busy hum
of foggy London, soon made his far-
away life in the Northern Territory
appear as a dream, leaving only a
vivid impression of utter loneliness
and isolation. After a few months
in the Old Country and a trip to the
Continent, however, the call of the
bush again asserted its power, and
at the end of 1905 he decided to
return to the land of his adoption,
travelling via America. Upon his
return he sold “Cresswell Downs”
run, together with the brand, at a
fair price, and purchased “Walla”
and “Tenningering” Stations from
Mr. Tidswell, the purchase including
3,500 head of cattle running on the
two properties. At that time
“Walla” covered an area of 30
square miles and “Tenningering” 50
square miles (which still remains


intact), since when several occupa-
tion licences have expired. Mr.
Innes, however, was able to convert
some 12,000 acres into freehold, and
has purchased adjoining leases com-
prising 7,000 acres of grazing farms.
At the date of purchase a fair
amount of develojmient work had
been completed on “Walla,” and
Mr. Innes has since made further
improvements, both in ringbarking,
fencing, and the sowing of various
artificial grasses to enrich the pas-
ture land. The fencing chiefly con-
sists of two barbed wfires and one
plain, and the whole run is sub-
divided into paddocks of from 1,000
to 2,000 acres. The prolific natural
grasses have been supplemented with
Rhodes grass, which is sown by Mr.
Innes with system and method. A
team of bullocks is. used to plough
patches of the ground among the
trees, which are sometimes entirely
removed, and thus good seed beds
are prepared for the young grass
plants, which spread rapidly over the
tilled surface and make excellent
rooting during the first year. The
cattle, grazing over these prepared
patches, in time carry the seed all
over the pastures. Upon “Walla”
may be found examples of some of
the most convenient and easily-
worked drafting yards in Queens-
land. These stockyards are famous
throughout the district for the size
and strength of the timber used in
their construction, some of the cor-
ner posts being 4 ft. in diameter.
They were erected as far back as 50
years ago, and old bushmen who
make the solid work of the pioneers
a matter of pride still refer to these
yards as an illustration of their
point. Mr. Innes runs some 8,000
head of cattle on his
various properties,
and he also includes
horsebreeding on a
fairly extensive scale
among its operations,
the particular fea-
tures of this depar-
ture being polo ponies
and draught horses of
the Suffolk Punch
type. He has some
very fine drafts of
ponies, which give
every promise of
making their name
among polo players,
while his Suffolk
Punch sire, “Butter-
bone Cupbearer,” is
a well-known prize-
winner, among the
honours he has taken
being the blue ribbon
of the Royal Agricul-
ture Society, Too-
woomba. The pony
sire is also a first-
prize winner in his
section at the Bris-
bane Exhibition, and
was purchased by
Mr. Innes in the
full flower of his
glory. The homestead
stands on the bank of the Burnett
River—which, with the Perry River
and several permanent creeks, runs
through the property —being situ-
ated near the old crossing which for-
merly was on the main route be-
tween Brisbane and Rockhampton,
alongside which the old telegraph
line still runs, this now carrying the
telephone line from the station to
Gin Gin township. Mr. Innes hat
consented to making “Walla” a
flood-warning station, and on more
than one occasion has been the means
in this way of saving immense quan-
tities of goods stocked on the wharf
at Bundaberg. Designed on the
bungalow principle, the old home-
stead, with its cool and shady veran-
dahs running right around the house,
affords most inviting retreat from
the tropical heat of Queensland, and
additional attraction is lent by the
garden, which is a veritable blaze of
colour. A number of flowering
shrubs and trees contribute their
share of glory, among which the
wonderful purples and reds of the
jacaranda, poinciana pulcherima,
and poinciana regia make predomin-
ant notes at certain seasons of the
year. The alligator pear, cestrums,
and hibiscus justica also flourish, and

of equal beauty. Adjacent to
the garden has been formed one of
the finest orangeries in the Burnett
district, and the “Walla” oranges
have obtained a widespread reputa-
tion for their size and excellent
quality. The fine broad stream of
the Burnett flowing over its rocky
bottom adds its quota of attraction
to one of the most desirable localities
in Queensland, the view from the
verandah embracing broad reaches of
this watercourse, which, with its
fringe of deep-green native trees,
makes a fairyland of the surround-
ings of the old house. In 1910 Mr.
Innes purchased “Takilberan” run,
comprising 16,000 acres of freehold,
from Mr. Capper, of Maitland, New
South Wales. This is a splendid,
well-improved station, and a noted
fattening property, Mr. Innes, who
works it in conjunction with his
“Walla” estate, drafting off all his
stores to fatten on “Takilberan”
pastures, whence they are sent direct
to the meatworks. Two years later
he purchased the old “Barolin”
homestead, with its surrounding
paddocks, embracing 1,700 acres,
situated right on the coast, below
Bundaberg, and has since pulled
down the old structure and built a
very fine summer residence on the
site of the former house. Here his

DAVID LACY JONES, J.P.
clerk of the Shire of Kilkivan and
part owner of “Euroka” Station, is
a son of the late George Hall Jones
(onetime representative for Burnett
district in the Parliament of Queens-
land) and grandson of the late
David Jones, founder of the well-

known commercial house of David
Jones & Co., Sydney. The last-
named gentleman came originally
from Wales and established himself
in business in the metropolis of the
Mother State as far back as the early
thirties, at that remote period laying
the foundation of the present
flourishing firm and subsequently
pursuing a long and brilliant mer-
cantile career, during the course of
which he found scope for his surplus
energies by taking upon his should-
ers the burden of Parliamentary
duties, serving as a member of the
New South Wales Legislative Coun-
cil for several years. His son, the
late George Hall Jones, father of
the gentleman under review, was
born in Sydney in 1837, and as a
youth of 18 he became associated
with his brother in pastoral pur-
suits at “Boonara” Station, Goo-
meri, in the Burnett district. This
property was used at that time ex-
clusively as a sheep proposition, but
although some excellent merinos
were bred at “Boonara,” this being
the type favoured as most suitable
to the locality, it was discovered
later that by utilizing it as cattle
country much better results could
be obtained. Much pioneer work
was necessary to make the venture
a success, and the two brothers were
obliged to rough it in every direc-
tion, but the hardships they were
called upon to face only proved the
stoutness of their hearts, and they
met with indomitable courage the
various perils of their position.
Paramount among these were the
dangers caused by the hostile atti-
tude of the aboriginal population,
as a result of which the station
homestead had to be turned into a
regular arsenal in order that suffi-
cient ammunition might be assured
to provide against the contingency
of an attack. All supplies and pro-
visions had to be transported long
distances by means of bullock wag-
gons, and luxuries were conspicuous
by their absence. Nevertheless,
proving themselves of true pioneer
stock, the brothers persevered in
their enterprise, and, learning the
trick of looking after themselves and
their interests, won through those
strenuous times without serious
casualty. In 1863 Mr. George Hall
Jones married a lady of English
birth, whose father went right
through the Peninsula War as an
officer in the famous old 69th Regi-
ment, and of this union there was
a large family of sons and daughters,
eight of whom are still surviving.
In 1891 he disposed of his interest
in “Boonara” and took a trip to
England, accompanied by five of his
children. Upon their return the
family went into residence in Syd-
ney, but after about 12 months of
city life the erstwhile pastoralist
yielded to the longing for the old
free existence, which became too
strong to be resisted, and was the
purchaser in 1892 of the beautiful
“Kilkivan” Station in the Wide
Bay district, where he put in a
strenuous period of development
work, erecting a homestead and
there taking up his abode with his
family until his death in 1899.
With the wife who shared his joys
and his sorrows he now lies at rest
in a little reserve of five acres of
the old homestead property, kept as
a sacred spot by the sons and daugh-
ters of the worthy couple, whose
desire is that it shall never pass out
of the possession of themselves or
their descendants, the grandchildren
being already taught to look upon it
as hallowed ground. A decade later
“Kilkivan” Station was purchased
by a syndicate and surveyed into
smaller properties for closer settle-
ment, and thriving farms now
occupy the pasture land of an earlier
date, the old homestead only being
left as a landmark of the labours of
the old pioneer who ended his days
within its walls. The late George
Hall Jones took considerable interest
in the public affairs of the country
and for many years was a prominent
figure in Shire administration. He
was returned as member of Parlia-
ment, representing the Burnett dis-
trict, in 1889, and held this seat for
two years, resigning in 1891 upon
the eve of his departure for Eng-
land. Of his surviving family, Mr.
A. E. Jones manages “Euroka”
Station, of which he is a joint pro-
prietor with his brother and sisters;
Mr. G. E. Jones has established
himself as a stock and station agent
in Goomeri; Mr. V. B. Jones holds
the post of inspector for the Com-
mercial Banking Company, Sydney;
two daughters are married, respec-
tively, to the Rev. A. E. Henry,
Roma, and Mr. J. M. Horsburgh,
a merchant of Maryborough; and
the youngest, Mr. Norman Jones,
at 37 years of age, was a volunteer
in the Australian Imperial Forces,
and was attached to the 31st
Queensland Battalion, which arrived
in Egypt at the time of the
evacuation of Gallipoli, after which
Mr. Jones saw some strenuous
fighting. The subject of this notice,
Mr. David Lacy Jones, was born in
the year 1877, at “Boonara” Sta-
tion—now in possession of his
cousin, Mr. Llewellyn Jones—and
received his elementary education at
the Maryborough State School, sub-
sequently proceeding to London.

is the eldest son of the late Paul
Lawless, a native of County Cork,
Ireland, who arrived in the land of


the Southern Cross, accompanied by
his brother, in the early forties.
Entering the pastoral industry these
gentlemen made their first grazing-
venture on Liverpool Plains, stocking
their country with sheep. Shortly
afterwards they transferred their
flocks to the Logan River, taking up
and stocking “Nindooinbah,” a
property situated in the district out-
lying Beaudesert, and now owned by
Mrs. William Collins. Finding the
Logan country unsuited to sheep, the
brothers sold “Nindooinbah” to a
Mr. Compigne and proceeded further
north with their stock, settled in the
Burnett district, and formed
“Booubyjan” Station in the year
1846, with which, as before stated,
the family has since been identified.
Eleven years after the formation of
“Booubyjan,” Mr. Paul Lawless
visited his native land and while
there entered the married state,
espousing Ellen, only daughter of
Mr. William Nash, of Dramcummer,
Mallow, County Cork, the issue of
this union being a family of four
children. Returning to Australia in
1859, the late gentleman remained
at “Booubyjan” for the following six
years, at the termination of which
period, owing to failing health, he
relinquished business pursuits and
again set out for Ireland accompanied
by his wife and children, passing
away in the land of his birth shortly
after his arrival there, on August
9, 1865. Mr. John Paul Lawless was
born at “Booubyjan” on March 17

educated at Cheltenham College,

studies at that academy he returned
to Australia and directed his atten-
tion to the industry to which his late
father had devoted his life, gaining

period spent on the old family estate
he accepted a post on “Murrawam-
bie,” a property situated on the
Bogan River, New South Wales, in
order to gain a thorough knowledge
of the most up-to-date methods of
conducting a sheep proposition and
to equip himself with a wider
experience of the wool-growing in-
dustry, making such good use of his
opportunities that in 1882, being
then in his twenty-second year, he
was entrusted with the management
of “Booubyjan.” He remained
occupied with the duties connected
with that position until 1889, when
he relinquished the reins of control
and engaged in pastoral enterprise
on his own account, acquiring
“Windera” in that year and thence-
forward devoting himself to the
conduct of that proposition. He
married in 1889 Mabel, second
daughter of Mr. Thomas Evans, who
formerly owned “Aranbanga” Station
in the Gayndah district, and has a
family of five children. His eldest
son, actuated by that sense of duty
and patriotism which prompted the
flower of Australian manhood to
throng to the colours at the country’s
call, participated in the Great World
War as a member of the Australian
Light Horse and was serving in
Palestine on the conclusion of hostili-
ties in November, 1918. Mr. Lawless
has contributed largely to the
advancement of the district which
has claimed his interest for so
considerable a period, and with which
he has been identified since infancy.
For some years he was a member of
the Nananga Divisional Board and
later served in the same capacity in
the body dealing with similar affairs
in Kilkivan.
WILLIAM GEORGE STEEL,
“Moonbria,” Blackall, was born at
Geelong, Victoria, on April 17,
1875, and is the son of the late
James Hall Steel, a descendant of
an old English family, his forbears
having been long established in and
around the town of Bristol, and con-
nected with some of the leading
families of the Mother Country.
His maternal uncle was Sir Falkiner
Poole, the noted English artist of
that period. The present generation
of the Steel family includes members
similarly talented, whose productions
have been exhibited in the Royal
Academy. The late J. H. Steel

toria, and was engaged in mercantile

early phases of surface work to
operations on a more extended scale.
He died when a comparatively young
man, leaving a family of six
children, of whom the gentleman
under review is the third son. Mr.
William George Steel received his
education at Geelong and other
centres, and afterwards proceeded to
"Butherwah” Station, in the River-
ina district, where, in order to gain
a practical knowledge of the pastoral
industry, he remained in the
capacity of jackaroo for a consider-
able period, eventually leaving there

in the same locality, being thus
occupied for about a year. In 1890
he left the Riverina district, over-
landing to Collarenebri, New South
Wales, with a pastoral family who
were going up there to settle, and for
the following four years was engaged
in general stock and station work,
particularizing in the wool-growing
industry and enlarging the know-
ledge already acquired of that
branch of station production. Later,
he embarked on a pastoral proposi-
tion on his own account, taking up
a lease on "Creel” Station, in the
Moree district, New South Wales,
in 1897, which he conducted until
the advent of the general drought
of 1902 destroyed the results of his
previous efforts and necessitated the
relinquishment of his hopes for the
time being. As a result of this
visitation he became engaged in
droving, artesian well boring, etc.
In the year 1915, choosing the Queen
State as the scene of his future
career, he secured a block of land on
“Avington” Station, a resumption of
which occurred at that time, and at
once set out with his wife and family
to take possession of his new holding,
thus adding another to the many
useful settlers whose progenitors
made history in the dawn of Aus-
tralia’s nationhood. This property
is called "Moonbria,” and is situated
40 miles from Blackall, with which
town the homestead is connected by
telephone. It embraces over 15,000
acres of country, which at the time
of Mr. Steel’s acquirement carried
but little improvement. In the
course of a brief period the
homestead was erected and the
stockyards, fencing, and other
improvements were well under way.
Merino sheep form the mainstay
of the place, though a few cattle
are also pastured. The country is
undulating in character, its bound-
aries embracing open boree plains,
through which Box Creek wends its
way, adding its quota to the water
supply, which is enhanced by a four-
mile frontage to the Barcoo and
other natural waters, the provision
thus afforded being supplemented by
a good dam. Mr. Steel is a member
of the Blackall Club, and, though a
comparatively recent resident of
the district, takes a general and
intelligent interest in the public
affairs connected therewith. Pie is

Club. He married in the year 1903
Jessie, daughter of Mr. J. W.
Strang, a well-known pastoralist of
the North-western district of New
South Wales, and a descendant of
an old Orkney Scottish family, which
was a branch of the Stuart clan, and
one of his forbears, Sir Robert
Strang, rendered distinguished ser-
vice to his cause in the Stuart wars
in Scotland. The Steel crest—an
antlered head with the motto “non
incautus futuri”- —has been used by
the family for a period closely
approaching 200 years, during
which its members have taken a
notable part in naval affairs dating
from the early days of the building
of the Empire down to the present-
time, the line in Australia bearing
blood relationship with Sir Eric
Geddes and many others promin-
ently connected with the service.
Mr. J. W. Strang is a native of
Tasmania, his father, David Strang,
having arrived in the Apple Isle as
ship’s doctor. Mrs. Steel’s uncle
was one of the three men who
volunteered to lend assistance on the
occasion of the wreck of the "Dun-
bar,” and among the many historic
relics of the old days owned by this
family is a suite of furniture made
from the timbers of that ill-fated
ship. Mr. and Mrs. Steel have a
family of two sons and one daughter.

Isles, having been born at Caine,
Wiltshire, England, on March 9,

1837. He is a son of the late Nathan
Atherton, a member of the legal pro-
fession, who came to Australia from
the Old Country in 1847 to carry
out the duties pertaining to the
appointment of inspector for the
Bank of Australasia, which post he
held for four years, at the termina-
tion of that period returning to
England. Three years subsequent
to his father’s return to the land
of his birth, Mr. John Townsend
. Atherton set sail for the Antipodes,
arriving at Sydney, New South
Wales, in 1854, and being desirous
to obtain experience in the pastoral
industry, was successful in securing
a position on “Runnymede” Sta-
tion, at that time under the pro-
prietorship of Messrs. Atkinson and
MacKellar. He made the most of
the opportunities afforded him on
this station for becoming expert in
the handling of stock and in pastoral
matters generally, and displayed
such aptitude for the work that he
was entrusted with the management
of “Miriam Vale” Station during
the absence of the owner, Mr.
Bloomfield, and acquitted himself
creditably, this station, in common
with the others with which Mr.
Atherton had been connected, being
devoted to cattle-raising exclusively.
Feeling that he was now in a posi-
tion to launch out on his own
account, he next purchased the lease
of “Miva” Station from Messrs.
Anderson, Leslie, & Mant, owners
of “Giggumgam” Station, the pro-
perty in question covering a large
tract of country which, in one direc-
tion, extended to the Mary River,
the banks of which are now closely
settled by a prosperous farming
population. In those early days the
flats bordering this fine stream of
water were looked upon as forming
some of the finest cattle country in
a very wide radius, and they were
eagerly coveted by those engaged in
pastoral enterprise as fattening pas-
tures for the stock. In addition to
the Mary River, the property is also
watered by Munna Creek, which
possesses a deep stretch of good
water, and in other respects it is fav-
oured with many natural advantages

as stock country. The estate
was practically in an undeveloped
condition when Mr. Atherton en-
tered into possession, and one of his
earliest pieces of work was the clear-
ing of a track, nine miles in length,
between “Miva” and “Gootchie”
Stations, which was the first stage of
the journey to Maryborough, 37
miles in all, to which centre Mr.
Atherton had to make periodical
journeys by bullock dray to obtain
stores and other necessary supplies.
The old “Miva” homestead possesses
a certain historic interest from the
fact that it is built wholly of the
fine cedar indigenous to the district,
in this respect resembling the sister
properties of “Boonara” and “Kil-
kivan,” both of which have been in
possession of the well-known Jones
family—descendants of the late
David Jones, of Sydney—at different
periods. The whole of the building
material for the “Miva” residence
was cut on Munna Creek, a short
distance below the house, and after
being pit-sawn was tongued and
grooved by hand. It stands to-day
as sound and strong as the day the
posts were first put into the ground,
and the whole house presents a well-
preserved appearance, which is a fine
testimony to the excellent work put
into its erection by its builder in the
pioneering era. The native popula-
tion was fairly numerous in the
vicinity of “Miva,” but they never
proved a source of serious trouble
to Mr. Atherton, who took consider-
able interest in their welfare, with
the result that even in roughest
time they always avoided injuring
him or his. A few of the station-
holders lost cattle through the
blacks, and Mr. Atherton relates
with some humour that on one occa-
sion the natives apologized to him
for having speared a “Miva” bul-
lock, explaining that it was done in
mistake, as they had thought it be-
longed to “Widgee Widgee” Sta-
tion ! He proved himself consist-
ently their friend and took everv

dence and affection, and of enlarg-
ing his experience in dealing with

year the Kilkivan gold find was re-

when again the whole countryside
became alive with eager prospectors
and the attendant train of those
anxious to profit by the hour by
undertaking to supply the physical
needs of the diggers, whose one
thought was to find the precious
metal, and Cobb & Co.’s coaches ran

Failing sight compelled him to re-
linquish many of his interests, and
with the hope of receiving complete
benefit he paid a visit to Sydney
some five years ago and submitted
to an operation, which however was
not successful. Otherwise, although
now of advanced age, Mr. Atherton
is in possession of all his faculties,
his hearing being very acute and his
memory little short of remarkable.
His courteous manner prepossesses a
stranger at once in his favour, and
he entertains with old-world hospi-
tality, while as an interesting con-
versationalist he has few equals in
the district. His marriage took
place in 1874 with Edith Louisa
Homer, a daughter of Edward
Homer, of Summer Hill, Hew South
Wales, and of this union there are
two sons and two daughters. The
elder son, John Henry Homer
Atherton, who controls operations
on “Miva” Station, was born at
Sydney, and received his primary
education at St. Mark’s Crescent
School at Darling Point, Sydney,
completing his scholastic studies at
the Maryborough Grammar School,
Queensland. Upon the termination

in October, 1867, when thousands

Mr. Atherton resigned the manage-

elder son, and has since lived in re-
tirement on the estate. In earlier
times he interested himself in the

ANGUS ALEXANDER
McLEAN, J.P., “Harden Park,”
Blackall, was born at Broadmeadows,
Melbourne, on August 2, 1861. He
is the son of the late Robert McLean,
MR. R. McLEAN.
who hailed from the Highlands of
Scotland. This gentleman had in-
herited from his Gaelic ancestors a
spirit of adventure, which was no
doubt fostered by the romantic
stories of their deeds in days gone
by, and thus he dreamed of a
country that might give scope for
the achievement of greater things
than would have been possible in the
narrow confines of the Old Land.
On the occurrence of his marriage
this desire for larger interests took
definite shape, with the result that,
at the age of 34, he bade farewell to
bonnie Scotland and to his sheep-
farm, “Ballintean” (which means
the home of the fairies), and set sail
with his bride for the distant land
so full of possibilities, situated in the
southern seas, this fulfilling his
destiny of becoming a helper in the
building up of the greater Empire
abroad. He arrived in Australia in
the year 1857, settling in Victoria,
and records dating back to the early
sixties show that he was engaged in
farming on his own account in the
vicinity of Broadmeadows at that
period. He carried on the industry
in this locality for some time, sub-
sequently proceeding to the Western
District of Victoria, where he
pursued the same calling, but in the
year 1881, deciding to enlarge his
sphere of action, he sold his interests
in that State with a view to settling
in Queensland. In the same year
he arrived in the Leichhardt district
and took up land in the vicinity of
Springsure, where he became en-
gaged in pastoral pursuits, owning
a property called “Minerva,” which
was one of the earliest selections in
that portion of the State. He held
this estate for the following eight
years, at the end of this period
retiring from active life to spend the
autumn of his days in Rockhampton,
where at the conclusion of a useful
career—having nearly approached
the three score years and ten—he
crossed the “Great Divide” in the
year 1892. With his memory is
recalled his fine character, his useful
work as a settler, his many years
spent in the public welfare. Records
MR. C. S. WILLS.
show that as far back as the early
seventies he was fulfilling the duties
of a councillor in the Portland Shire
of the Western District of Victoria.
His son, Mr. A. A. McLean, was
educated in Victoria, and completed
his scholastic career at the Hamilton
Academy in the Western District of
that State at the age of 16. He
began life as a jackaroo on “Hilgay”
Station, in the famous Wannon
district, which has been named by
pastoralists “The Garden of Vic-
toria,” on which station he gained
valuable experience in the handling
of sheep. In 1881 he came to
Queensland to assist his father and
brothers in the working of the prop-
erty in the Springsure district, and
here he continued until the disposal
of “Minerva,” in the year 1889. At
this time his mind was strongly
imbued with the idea that the
Argentine Republic offered excep-
tional opportunities from a pastoral
view-point, and he decided to visit
South America, in order to test these
possibilities. However, after two
years’ employment in the industry
there, during which period he gained
valuable experience of stock matters,
and of life generally, he became
definitely convinced that the pastoral
attractions of the Argentine were
of the kind to which “distance lends
enchantment.” The year 1892
marked his return to Queensland,
and shortly after his arrival he was
appointed to the management of
“Bexley” Station, in the Longreach
district. He accepted the position
of overseer on “Kensington Downs,”
the property of Messrs. Cameron &
Co., a year later, and subsequently
managed “Rainworth” Station, near
Springsure, with considerable success
for the four years preceding 1899.
In that year he joined forces with
Mr. J. Robson-Scott and the Messrs.
Cameron Bros., sons of the late John
Cameron, and purchased “Belford”
Station, of which he became manag-
ing partner. This property was
composed of a group of grazing
farms near Richmond, on the

The “Belford” merinos, bred from
South Australian blood, bear a name
for excellence throughout Qiieens-
land, of which the breeder has reason
to feel justly proud. The firm later
purchased “Rainscourt,” a property
situated near Hughenden. Early in
1917, after having spent 18 years in
the administration of “Belford,” he
disposed of his interests in both
properties, subsequently devoting
some time to an inspection of the
country with a view to obtaining
suitable land for development solely
in his own interests. Eventually he
decided to purchase “Harden Park,”
situated near Blackall, from Messrs.
Hookes, Ltd., and entered into pos-

JAMES McKENZIE, Blackall.
Among the many pioneers who have
contributed so largely to the develop-
ment and settlement of the Central
West of Queensland, the name of
MR. JAMES McKENZIE.
Mr. James McKenzie deservedly
holds a foremost place. He has been
associated with the town and com-
munal life of Blackall and the
surrounding district since the year
1875, and the reputation which he
now enjoys is but a sequence to the
character which he established as a
pioneer in the days when the Queen
State was still in its infancy. He was
born in the parish of Skeyne, Aber-
deenshire, Scotland, on July 16,
1840, and is a son of the late Peter
McKenzie, a native of the same
place, and a descendant of the clan
McKenzie, who were established in
the Highlands, the headquarters of
this family having formerly been at
Ross. The grandfather of the
gentleman under review was a
member of the well-known Black
Watch Regiment, and was wounded
in the famous battle of Waterloo.
On his return from foreign parts he
removed with his family to the
Lowlands, where his son Peter,
already mentioned, is recorded as
having been engaged in forestry on
the estate of Lord Fife. The late
Mr. Peter McKenzie’s family con-
sisted of 11 children, all of whom,
with the exception of his son James
and his twin brother, remained in
the land which gave them birth.
This brother settled in Canada, in
the late sixties, where he still resides.
In the year 1864, while yet in his
early twenties, Mr. James McKenzie,
urged by the promptings of an
adventurous spirit, decided to test
the possibilities that might await his
enterprising nature in newer climes,
choosing the land of the Southern
Cross as the scene of his future
career. The voyage, which was made
in the sailing ship “Castle of Eden,”
a vessel of small tonnage in charge of
Captain Allsop, proved to be exceed-
ingly rough, and was marked by
perilous episodes, the ship becoming
dismantled through bad weather
experienced in the Bay of Biscay,
and again on reaching Bass Straits,
where she lost her masts and nar-
rowly escaped being wrecked. The
port of Brisbane was reached in
October of the same year after a
journey of five months duration. On
the day of his arrival Mr. McKenzie
was engaged to take charge of horses

and to fell and grub trees prepara-
tory to the development of a home
at Breakfast Creek for the late
Captain Seymour, who for many
years was superintendent of Police
in Brisbane. The nature of the work,
however, being uncongenial, he relin-
quished it as soon as he had earned a
few pounds, and immediately sought
other employment, which he was
successful in obtaining in connection
with the building of the first railway
line in Queensland. He worked at
bridge construction and on the
extension of the line from Grand-
chester to Gatton, and after spending
some time in this avocation became
attracted by the mining industry,
making his way to the Canal Creek
goldfields, near Leyburn, then being
opened up, where he was amongst
the earliest to try his luck. He was
unsuccessful in his search for the
precious metal, and this fact, com-
bined with other circumstances,
directed his steps northwards, where
he had no difficulty in again finding
employment in railway construction
work, on this occasion occupying a
post with the contractors who had
begun operations on the first section
of the railway from Rockhampton to
what was then known as Presho (now
Westwood), remaining at this work
for some time. The attractions of
the goldfields, however, still swayed
the mind and ambitions of the young
pioneer, and subsequently he pro-
ceeded to the Ridgeland diggings,
some 20 miles away, where, purchas-
ing a puddling machine, a horse and
dray, and the necessary parapher-
nalia, he began the work of puddling,
meeting with a fair amount of success
when water was obtainable. He left
the Ridgeland field to join the rush
to White Hill, but after about two
months of unsuccessful effort his
capital gave out, and he was forced
to again abandoned the industry with
its tempting but constantly vanishing
possibilities. Subsequently he went
to Peak Downs and took up contract
work, which, so far as remuneration
was concerned, yielded more than
double the amount he could have

earned as a wage-worker. In this
connection we should mention that
Mr. McKenzie never worked under
the latter conditions, preferring al-
ways to take work under contract. In
the year 1873, having again accumu-
lated a small amount of capital he

brought up to its present high
standard by those qualities of com-
mercial honesty, industry, and thrift
which are such conspicuous traits in
Mr. McKenzie’s character. Since his
advent as a resident of Blackall Mr.
McKenzie, with a single exception,
has never been absent from the town
for a whole month on end. His only
lengthy period of absence occurred
in the year 1910, when, accompanied
by his wife and youngest daughter,
he renewed the scenes and acquaint-
ance of his boyhood, visiting also
many places of historic interest, both
in Great Britain and across the
Channel in the “isle of saints and
scholars,” the land to which the
progenitors of his wife owed their
birth. He has studied the interests
of Blackall from the days of its
infancy, having held aldermanic
honours at that time, and some 40
years ago, in conjunction with his
numerous other duties, filled the role
of postmaster. He holds the distinc-
tion of being the first Freemason at
Blackall, and subsequently filled
nearly all the offices of that order,
but latterly he has ceased to actively
identify himself with the craft. He
is one of the founders of the local
hospital, and his support has been
freely given whenever and wherever
needed to all matters tending to the
later settled in Queensland, where he
became a well-known figure in the
carrying industry in and around the
districts of Aramac and Winton,

parental rooftree and immediately
became engaged in conducting the
financial side of his father’s business,
continuing in this occupation for the
following 13 years. During the above
period he purchased blocks of
country adjacent to Blackall, his first
venture being the acquirement of
“Westhill,” which he disposed of to

THOMAS ORCHARD & SONS,
“Douglas Park,’’ Blackall.
THOMAS ORCHARD was born in
the Geelong district of Victoria on
July 28, 1846, when that Colony was
yet a portion of New South Wales.
He is a son of the late Thomas
Orchard, who originally hailed from
Oxfordshire, England, having come
to Australia in the year 1844, accom-
panied by his wife and those of his
children who were then born. The
late gentleman had a family of eight
sons and four daughters, five of the
former and three of the latter having
first seen the light in the land of the
Southern Cross, the gentleman under
review being the only member now
settled in Queensland. His pro-
genitors followed agrarian pursuits
in the Mother ountry, though

certain representatives of the family
followed the profession of arms, some
of his uncles having fought to the
death in the glorious charge of
Balaclava. Both father and son have
w
served the Empire in more peaceful
avocations in a newer land, bravely
struggling with the hardships and
trials incidental to the progress of
settlement in this island continent, a
task in which they were upborne by
the courageous support of their
women-folk, who cheerfully shared
with them the sacrifices, hardships,
and adversities of the pioneering
days. The late Thomas Orchard
settled in Victoria (where most
of his descendants still reside),
purchasing a farm at Winchelsea,
near Geelong, where he lived until
his death, which occurred at the ripe
old age of 88 in the year 1900. His
children were reared on this property
and trained in the farming industry.
Mr. Thomas Orchard was educated
MR. WM. STIRLING.
at a private school at Winchelsea,
and at the age of 14 was working the
primitive old plough of the period on
his father’s acres, dividing his time
between school at night and farm
labour during the day. He remained
with his father until his marriage,
which occurred when he was 22 years
of age, in 1869. After this event
he invested the small capital saved
out of his previous earnings in a
block of land near his old home,
being occupied with the development
of this estate for a brief period.
Hearing of the possibilities offered by
the wide areas of unopened land in
the newly-formed Queen Colony, he
sold his farm in Victoria and pro-
ceeded with his wife and infant
daughter as far north as Rock-
hampton, where other members of
the family had preceded them.
Shortly afterwards he purchased a
team and became engaged in carry-
ing, working from Westwood through
the district surrounding Springsure,
MR. T. ORCHARD.
and as far out as “Landsdowne,”
“Terrick-Terrick,” and other places
on the Barcoo. He continued in the
carrying trade for about 10 years,
suffering during this period many
hardships and privations. In the
year 1882 he took up a block of
country consisting of 320 acres, which
included the site of his “Fairfield”
homestead, but was overtaken by
the drought of 1883-4, experiencing
his first real reverse as a consequence
of this visitation, which forced him
to abandon for the time being the
working of this property. He re-
turned to his former trade of
carrying, having the additional bur-
den of providing feed for his horses
to enable him to carry on in spite of
the rainless conditions. In 1885 he
took a position as overseer for the
Kargoolnah Shire Council, in order
to tide over the effects of this period,
and remained with them as their
trusted officer for eight years, even-
tually resigning to follow the dairy-
ing industry at “Fairfield.” He
pursued this avocation with sufficient
success to enable him to acquire
further country surrounding his
original block, and shortly afterwards
became engaged in sheep-farming.
With the help of his family, now
growing to years of usefulness, he
began to feel his feet financially,
being in a position to add from time


to time still further lands to those
already acquired, so that at time of
writing the combined properties,
“Douglas Park,” “Fairfield,” and
“Lilydale” comprise an area, roughly

speaking, of about 20,000 acres, with
a carrying capacity in average seasons
for 10,000 sheep. Cattle are also car-
ried lo some extent. Mr. Orchard
does not go in for breeding stock, his
Mitchell grass country, interspersed
with belts of light timber, which
provide useful shade. The land is
highly developed, among the im-
provements being an artesian bore
and a large dam, these sources
affording the main water supply.
“Fairfield,” the original holding,
embraces country of a similar nature
to “Douglas Park,” and the old
homestead is now occupied by Wil-
liam, the younger of Mr. Orchard’s
two sons. “Lilydale,” whereon the
elder son, Sydney Thomas, resides,
carries more scrub than the other
properties, this being of an edible
nature and highly suitable for cattle.
All three properties are well devel-
oped. Mr. Orchard, sen., lives with
his wife and youngest daughter at
“Douglas Park,” spending the
autumn of his days in partial retire-
ment, and leaving the active admin-
istration of the properties to his
sons. In his younger days he was an
active participant in all affairs of
importance connected with the dis-
trict, his interests in this direction
including the Blackall Municipal
Council and the Queensland Grazing
Farmers and Settlers’ Association.
He was one of the first aldermen of
the former body, fulfilling his duties
in this connection for two terms of
the Council. He was one of the
founders of the local general hospital,

mention that there is no better loved

teens, and was engaged at sea in
various capacities, the last ship in

immediately became attracted by
the fascinating possibilities of the
early Victorian gold fields, which in
those days tempted so many men of
brave hearts and enterprising
natures from all quarters of the
earth to these common centres, and
was responsible for the inaction of
many a ship, which lay idle in port
for want of the crew who had ex-
changed their maritime avocations
for the alluring prospects of the
gold diggings. The late Mr. Cooper
was soon numbered among those
intrepid spirits who counted no risk
too great or life too hard that held
forth the hope that sooner or later
their quest would prove successful.
Apparently, in his case, Dame For-
tune was not disposed to lavish
favours or to encourage his efforts in
the mining industry, for we find later
that the possibilities of the then little
known northern Colony of Queens-
land became apparent to his far-
seeing mind, and resulted in his
arrival in the north when Blackall
was but a name. He later became
a well-known figure to the dwellers
on the “Edge of the Beyond” in
the capacity of coach driver for the
firm of Cobb & Co. between Blackall
and Pine Hill, about 40 years ago.
His kindly nature and obliging
actions became household words at
that period, for be never failed to
render such service as was in his
power to make the lives of those
whose lots were cast in the spaces
of the “Never Never” a happier one.
His good offices in this direction
were, by choice, far in excess of
his duties, and there are many of
these old residents still alive who
remember the fact with gratitude.
He subsequently gave up coach-
driving and became engaged in
general station work around the
Blackall district for a few years,
during that time endeavouring to
put away by patient saving and
thrift an amount sufficient to enable
him to make a business venture on
his own account. His efforts in this
direction were so successful that in
the year 1885 he was in a position
to acquire in partnership with Mr.
Edward Powell and Mr. William
Sutcliffe a sawmilling proposition.
The former gentleman is now living
in retirement on the Darling Downs,
and the latter still lives as an
old identity of the Barcoo. Sub-
sequently Mr. Sutcliffe’s interest in
the concern was taken over by the
remaining partners, who worked the
industry in conjunction for the fol-
lowing 10 years. In 1895 this
connection was mutually dissolved,
and the mill sold, the late Mr.
Cooper retiring to “Norwood,” a
grazing farm of 3,000 acres, which
he had acquired in the meantime.
The acreage of this property was
subsequently increased by the pur-
chase of land,surrounding the original
block, and the old pioneer applied
himself diligently to the development

his children, attaining to years of
usefulness, became helpful in their
turn, and progress became more
rapid, so that after a brief period
the family had established a cosy

little property in the Blackall dis-
trict, which pastured a flock of
about 8,000 sheep and some cattle
and the requisite number of horses.
Some years later his eldest son


acquired a block of 20,000 acres in
the Hughenden district, which is
now in course of development. The
late Mr. Cooper lived to enjoy the

fruits of his industry tor about 12
yea™, passing away in 1907, being
then in the sixty-seventh year of his
age. He is missed by the many old
pioneers who battled with him under
the trying suns of the west in the
days when settlement was yet in its
infancy, and when the now highly
woman, whose sterling qualities
rendered her a worthy helpmeet to
her hard-working and industrious
husband. Her death occurred in the
year 1912. Of the union there is a
family of five sons and two daugh-
ters, all of whom were born in the
west, and the latter still reside in
the comfortable old homestead. The
estate is managed by the late
gentleman’s eldest son, Mr. John
Thomas Cooper. All the male mem-
bers of the family contributed
towards the development of the
estate, either directly on the pro-
jmrty or by the application of capital
earned in station work elsewhere.
“Norwood” is situated some 15 miles
north of Blackall, and within a
couple of miles of the Barcoo River.
It is principally watered by Douglas
Pond’s Creek, this source being sup-
plemented by a sub-artesian supply.
The country is flat, its nature being
indicated by black soil bearing
Mitchell and Flinders grasses chiefly,
and timbered by coolibah, gidya,
dead-finish, and other edible scrubs.
It is well fenced and subdivided into
paddocks, which are adapted for
either sheep or cattle. Mr. John
T. Cooper is a member of the local
hospital committee and the Blackall
Show committee. All the brothers
have a fondness for sporting events,
and invariably take part in the
various amateur events held in the
district. Three of the younger mem-
bers of the family have shed a lustre

grandfather of the gentlemen under
review, having been one of the

large landowner at that time.
Before entering upon pastoral pur-
suits he was engaged in railway
contract work, in which connection
he constructed the St. Kilda
(Victoria) line. His two sons, the late
Messrs. Abram and Thomas Craw-
ford, were also largely interested as
partners in the pastoral industry of
the Riverina district, though the
former gentleman’s personal activi-
ties were centred for the greater part
in commercial pursuits. The late
Mr. ABRAM CRAWFORD, the
father of the owners of “Coolagh,”
was born at Bathgate, Linlithgow-
shire, Scotland, in the year 1830,
and educated at that town, subse-
quently being engaged in the
soft-goods trade in some of the
leading houses in Edinburgh for a
time, and later leaving the land of
his birth with the intention of
joining a firm dealing in similar lines
in the land of the Southern Cross.
He landed in Melbourne in the year
1857, shortly afterwards undertak-
ing the management of a business
in Castlemaine, being thus occu-
pied for a year. At the end of this
time he embarked upon a commercial
proposition on his own account in
Market Square, carrying on there
until 1867, when he opened an
establishment at Ballarat, where, in
spite of recurring vicissitudes, he
carried on a large and profitable
business for a quarter of a century,
selling out to Messrs. Snow and
Room in the year 1878. After three
years’ respite he once more resumed
his connection with commercial life
as a member of the firm of Crawford,
King, & Co., of Flinders Street,
Melbourne, becoming at the end of
six years sole proprietor of this
business, which he carried on until
he was burnt out by the disastrous
conflagration which occurred in
the year 1897. As a result he
purchased premises in Chapel Street,
Prahran, in which, under the title
of Crawford & Co., and the manage-
ment of his third son, Mr. W .McN.
L. Crawford, the business was con-
ducted until the final retirement of
the late gentleman in the year 1904.
The late Mr. Abram Crawford’s
death occurred at his home “Clan-
gillian,” Malvern, Victoria, in the
year 1908. He was twice married
and left a family of five sons and
nine daughters, the eldest son by his
second marriage being the gentleman
mentioned above. Two of the sons
by the second union were educated
at Haileybury College, Brighton,
Victoria, while the third, Mr. W.
McN. L. Crawford, received his
education at the Ballarat and Gren-
ville Colleges in the same State.

agriculture, for which purpose he
selected a block of 4,000 acres near
Kojonop for the purpose. For two
years he was engaged in developing
this estate as a farming proposition,


when, realizing that it allowed
insufficient scope for progress on an
extended scale, he disposed of it,
and visited Queensland with the idea
of satisfying himself as to the

possibilities open to bim in this
State. The visit resulted in the
purchase of “Coolagh” in the year
1909, in conjunction with his two
brothers, Messrs. Glendinning and
H. A. N. Crawford, who had pre-
ceded him to the Queen State, and
a few years later of another property
named “Maryvale Springs,” near
Yalleroi. “Coolagh” is a sheep pro-
position, situated 50 miles north-
west of Blackall. The run embraces
over 20,000 acres of sparsely-tim-
bered open downs country bearing
boree, whitewood, and gidya, and
producing a luxuriant growth of
Mitchell, Flinders, blue, and many
natural grasses of edible species
besides the useful forage known as
saltbush. The property is well-
watered through natural sources,
having in addition to a four-mile
and five-mile frontage to the Barcoo
and Alice Rivers, respectively, many
natural ponds. A supplemental
supply is provided by a sub-artesian
bore. At the time of Messrs. Craw-
ford’s purchase the property was for
the greater part unimproved, but
under their energetic i egime a
system of development was inaugu-
rated which has resulted in its
becoming in this respect equal
to most of the older, and better
than the majority of estates in
the Mitchell district. “Mary vale
Springs” embraces country dissimi-
lar in type to “Coolagh,” its area of
16,000 acres being composed of open
forest land upon which kangaroo
grass and soft spinifex prevail. It
is watered by natural springs, as the
name implies, this property being
also further provided for by means
of sub-artesian bores. Both proper-
ties are worked in conjunction, and
form an ideal combination as a
proposition for raising sheep, of
which they have a carrying capacity
of about 15,000 in an average
season. The homestead, which
was built shortly after the Messrs.
Crawford’s acquirement of the
property, is up-to-date in every
particular, and contains all the
conveniences of a modern pastoral
home. On the outbreak of the Great
War, Mr. W. McN. L. Crawford,
setting at nought his private inter-
ests, hastened to “do his bit” in the
arena where such tremendous issues
were at stake. He served in France
and Flanders, and was wounded in
the battle at Menin Road, and as a
result was invalided home as unfit
for further military duty. Having
done his part in the glorious effort
to stifle the evils of military
domination, he is once more assisting
in the administration of the firm’s
estates in Western Queensland. His
brother, Mr. GLENDINNING
CRAWFORD, served the Empire in
the Boer war in the year 1901,
having been attached to the Marquis
of Tullerbardine’s 2nd Scottish
Horse. On his return to Australia
he gained experience in the pastoral
industry on various station proper-
ties in Queensland, including “Logan
Downs,” “Langton,” and “Huntly,”
being occupied with the duties of
overseer on the last-mentioned
property when the opportunity to
join his brother in the purchase of
“Coolagh” offered itself. Mr. Glen-
dinning Crawford married in 1918
Olive, daughter of the late George
Porter, a well-known grazier in the
early days of the Aramac district.
Mr. H. A. N. Crawford, the
youngest member of the firm, was
for some years accountant in the
Victorian business of Crawford &
Co. Subsequently he entered upon a
course of training at the Dookie
Agricultural College, and later
turned his attention to bush life,

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


JOHN ANDREW WILKINSON,
J.P., “Kainama,” Kogan, was born
at Oruru, near Mongonui, North
Island, New Zealand, in the year
1877. He is the fourth son of the
late Thomas Wilkinson, a native of
Lincolnshire, England, who sailed
from the Motherland in 1859, and
on arrival in New Zealand became
engaged in the farming industry
at Oruru, Bay of Islands County,
where he remained for thirty-one
years. In 1890 he decided to come
to Australia, and, having sold his
interests to his eldest son, arrived
at the Mildura Irrigation Settle-
ment in Victoria in the same year,
and almost' immediately acquired
“Oruru” —a 20-acre block of land —-
and subsequently became one of the
many successful fruitgrowers in that
well-known district. The late Mr.
Wilkinson died in 1910. Mr. John
Andrew Wilkinson was educated at
Oruru, New Zealand, and came
with his father to Australia when
he was 13 years of age, the follow-
ing six years being spent in assisting
that gentleman in the culture of
assorted fruits, among which oranges
and raisins were the most important,
and during this period he gained a
thorough knowledge of up-to-date
methods of fruit-growing. In 1896
he secured 20 acres of irrigation
land adjoining the home property,
in conjunction with his brother,
Thomas, the partners specializing in
sultana and “Gardo Blanco” varieties
of grapes for drying purposes, and
also citrus culture. Three years’
hard work were necessary before
payable results could be obtained.
Mr. AVilkinson calculates the expen-
diture per acre for the first three
gradually increased until they
arrived at the net average return
of from £3O to £35 per acre. The
working cost (including cultivation,
picking, drying, and selling charges)
MR. J. A. WILKINSON.
would average about £3O per acre.
Oranges and lemons would take two
years longer to come into profit.
Somewhat later in the same year
the Messrs. AVilkinson Bros, secured
a further block of land of 28 acres,
and subsequently increased the
extent of their orchard to 56 acres,
in addition to which they held a
block of 50 acres, which was devoted
to cereal crops. At the inception of
this irrigation scheme the Messrs.
Chaffey Bros, charged a uniform
price of £2O per acre for unimproved
worth from £lOO to £2OO per acre.
He visited Queensland in 1908,
toux'ing through the Darling Downs
country as far as Chinchilla, and
eventually selected his present
property, “Kainama,” this being
the name of the house in which he
was born in New Zealand, and is
a Maori word meaning “food on
credit.” He then returned to
Mildura, and sold his interests at
the settlement. The country com-
prising “Kainama” is composed of
7,000 acres of mixed country
timbered with pine, ironbark, box,
and brigalow, and will have a carry-
ing capacity when fully improved
of about 1,200 head of cattle, the
type favoured being shorthorn cows
crossed with Hereford bulls. Mr.
Wilkinson has at present some very
fine Hereford bulls from the well-
known “Lyndley” stud. He is par-
ticularly fond of horses, and his
Welsh pony stallion, “King of the
Dandies,” is one of the finest sires
of his kind, and has already secured
three firsts and two reserve cham-
pionships at the Brisbane National
Exhibition. The run is watered by
the Kogan and Little Kogan creeks,
these creeks being permanent, and
providing a splendid water supply.
About 100 acres of land are under
cultivation. Mr. Wilkinson’s public
spirit is emphasized through his
practical manner of helping matters
forward in developing the resources
of the district, particularly in the
case of the Kogan Co-operative
Cheese Company, of which he is
chairman of directors. This company
has an up-to-date factory and plant,
and can handle up to 1,100 gallons
of milk daily. Mr. Wilkinson is a

land. This settlement, practically
wholly devoted to fruit-growing, has
proved a great success, and the best
orchards in Mildura to-day are
supplier on the share system. He
has installed an A. W. R. Milking
machine, and has erected the neces-
sary milking shed, bail yards, etc.,


on most approved lines. The
"Kainama” homestead is a most
compact and modern bungalow, and
possesses large airy rooms and deep
verandahs. The orchard is an
example of what can be done in the
way of fruit culture in Queensland,
and contains a good assortment of
fruit trees, including oranges, lemons,
mandarins, apples, pears, peaches,
plums, almonds, olives, and persim-
mons, also a mixed variety of grape
vines, all of which are bearing well.
.Since his advent to the State he has
been much to the fore in public mat-
ters, occupying in 1916 the position
of president of the Chinchilla Shire
Council, and he still represents No. 3
Division of the Shire. He is a
member of the Brisbane, Too-
woomba, Chinchilla, and Dalby show
societies, and is on the committee
of the two latter societies. He
was appointed a Justice of the
Peace by the Denham Cabinet in
1911. Mr. Wilkinson married in
1909 Florence Annie, fifth daughter
of the late Emanuel Roberts, Quorn,
South Australia, and has a family
of one son and two daughters.
GEORGE MILBURN, late of
“Weeumbah” and "Avondale,” in
the Longreach district, was born
MR. W. MILBURN, SEN.
near Casterton, Victoria, on April
9, 1866. Fie is a son of the late
William Milburn, who, hailing from
Wierdale, Durham, England, in the
early fifties entered the industry
which at that time was attracting
men from all quarters of the globe
to the newly-opened goldfields of
Victoria and which gave the first
real impetus to the greater develop-
ment of the continent, the pioneer-
ing labours of men of the type of the
late Mr. Milburn contributing
largely to the rapid formation of the
nation. After experiencing the
many vicissitudes incidental to the
life of a miner of the period, the
late gentleman turned his energies
into a new channel, during the
Hamilton land boom of 1865, taking
up grazing and farming land in the
Casterton district, later purchasing
land from George Carmichael, of
“Retreat” Station, which he named
“Olive Grove.” He was one of the

first land-owners to form a perman-
ent home in the district, and at his
death at the ripe old age of eighty
years was survived by a family of
ten, of which the gentleman under
review is the second son. Concluding
his education, which was conducted
in his native State, at the age
of fifteen, Mr. George Milburn
became occupied with agricultural
2>ursuits on the paternal acres,
assisting his late father for the
ensuing seven years. On reaching
the age of twenty-two he entered
into partnership with his elder
brother John, and a younger brother
William, leasing a block of country
which adjoined the home farm. Here
the brothers carried on the industry
until January 1893 when George
and William transferred their ener-
gies to the Riverina, in which
district they continued the same
calling for a further four years. At
the end of that period, however,

realizing that Queensland afforded
larger opportunities for successful
landed enterprise, they disposed of
their interests in the South and
journeyed to the Northern State,
where they decided to test the
possibilities of the pastoral industry,
taking up two grazing blocks in the
Longreach district in the year 1897,
which were originally included in
the areas of “Westland” and “Silso”
Stations. Naming their blocks
“Weeumbah” and “Avondale” they
worked them conjointly for eleven
years, having brought them to an
advanced stage of development dur-
ing that period, the improvements
including a very comfortable and
up-to-date residence. In the year
1908 both properties were disposed
of to Mr. P. Hopkins, Mr. G.
Milburn then entering into partial
retirement and his brother William
relinquishing his connection with
pastoral affairs. The former, how-
ever, still finds congenial occupation
in the industry to which he devoted
eleven years of his life. Messrs.
Milburn are nephews of Messrs.
George, J. E., and Francis Coxon,
the senior members of the well-known
family of that name. Both brothers
are members of the Masonic
fraternity.


THOMAS CECIL BUTTON,
manager of “Retreat” Station,
Yaraka, and joint owner in the firm
of Button Brothers of “Adaford,”
“Weiford Downs,” “Corrib,” and
MR. T. BUTTON.
"Achill,” was born at "Maitland
Vale,” an historic old home on the
Hunter River, near Maitland, New
South Wales, on April 22, 1876. He
is a son of Mr. Thomas Button, who
now lives in retirement at Morpeth,
New South Wales, and who in earlier
years was one of the most prominent
and highly respected pastoralists in
the Mother State. Mr Thomas
Button, sen., was born
in Australia, his father,
the late Charles But-
ton, founder of the
line here, having hailed
from Cornwall, the
family deriving its des-
cent from the most
ancient Celtic stock of
that county. The But-
tons are connected on
the maternal side of
their house with the
Wynns of “Wynnstay,”
one of the most repre-
sentative families in
Wales. On arrival in
New South Wales the
late Mr. Button entered
the pastoral industry,
and is recorded as the owner
of “Burren” and "Maitland
Vale,” two properties notably
identified with the early pastoral
history of the country. Most of his
family were born on the former
estate. As was customary at that
period, he was followed in the
industry by his sons, of whom Mr.
Thomas Button, sen., was the third.
The latter gentleman subsequently
came into possession of “Maitland
Vale,” in partnership with some
of his brothers of "Burren” where
he was engaged in pastoral pur-
suits for many years, bravely
struggling with a succession of
droughts, which eventually were
the cause of his retirement, their
crippling effect leaving him hardly
any better off financially than when
he entered the industry. Neverthe-
less in the peaceful shadows which
usually enfold the latter part of an
active life, he rests content with the
knowledge of having given of his
best, assured that his efforts were
among the factors which marked the
peaceful settlement of the great
Empire abroad. Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Button have ever com-
manded the respect and goodwill of
all with whom they come in contact,
and to the latter must be accorded
all honour as a worthy wife and
mother whose sympathy was ever
ready in times of trial or happiness,
and whose moral and practical sup-
port were an unfailing source of
encouragement to her husband.
They have a surviving family of
four sons and two daughters, three
of the former being engaged in
pastoral pursuits in Queensland as
partners in the firm of Button
Brothers, of which the gentleman
under review is the principal

member. Mrs. T. C. Button also holds
interests in the firm. Mr. Thomas
Cecil Button was educated privately
at “Maitland Vale,” concluding his
studies at an early age owing to
reverses in the family fortunes and
m order to assist his father an
brothers in working the estate. He
remained so occupied until the for
mer’s retirement, when he obtained

a position as clerk in a commercial
establishment, a form of employ-
ment which he followed for three
years, during which he acquired an
experience that has stood him in
good stead in his subsequent career
as a landowner. While yet in his
teens, the compelling attraction of
his earlier environment resulted in
his accepting a post as jackaroo
on "Cheshunte,” near
Singleton, where he re-
mained for about four
years, leaving this sta-
tion in order to engage
in the dairying industry
in partnership with a
son of his employer.
The havoc played by
the drought of 1901-2
prevented them from
making a success of this
undertaking, and the
young man had perforce
to relinquish the idea
of personal venture for
the time being. In the
early part of the year
1902 he obtained a
position as overseer on
"Brindingabba,” a property then
owned by his uncle, Mr. W. M.
Christian (since deceased), and
held that post for the fol-
lowing five years. At the


termination of this period he was
promoted by his late uncle to the
management of “Retreat” Station,

that time. Subsequently, when the
opportunity offered, he purchased
“Corrib.” The firm already men-
tioned was then formed and later
purchased “Adaford” and “Wel-

derry.” The additional properties
were in the vicinity of “Retreat”
Station. The firm comprised the

Station and the four properties
owned by Messrs. Button Bros,
are composed of similarly formed
country, the nature of which is
indicated by open plains varied with
low-timbered sandhills, frontages of
channelled land bearing coolibah
trees, and back country timbered
chiefly with mulga. Sheep form the
main industry of all the above-men-
tioned estates, though cattle to the
number of 1,000 are pastured in those
of the firm’s paddocks most suited to
horned stock. Since his advent to
Queensland Mr. Thomas Cecil But-
ton has taken a prominent part in
matters of general interest. Among
the many offices he has held in
connection with the public welfare
may be mentioned the presidentship
of the Jundah Hospital, a post
which he filled for many years. He
is president of the Jundah Amateur
Race Club, and lends his hearty
encouragement to all clean forms of
sport. As a councillor of the
Barcoo Shire he has actively associ-
ated himself with local government
and he has rendered good service

DONALD JOHN MacDONALD,
“Randwick,” Blackall, was born at
Crystal Brook, South Australia, on
July 31, 1886. He is the third son
of the late Ronald MacDonald, who
originally hailed from Scotland,
sailing with his parents at the age of
10 years from the Old Land in the
ship “Hercules,” the family arriving
in South Australia in the year 1851.
The clan is of ancient origin and
counted among its members in cen-
turies past men who loyally did their
share in the history making of their
country. The late Archibald Mac-
Donald, grandfather of the gentle-
man under review and founder of
the line in Australia, followed
agrarian pursuits on that portion of
the Scottish mainland which is just
opposite the Isle of Skye, occupying
the acres whereon many generations
of his ancestry had pursued similar
avocations in the peaceful intervals
of clan warfare. On arrival in South
Australia he became engaged in
pastoral pursuits, and later, when
his son Ronald grew to manhood, he
too followed the industry, becoming
the owner of grazing lands in that
State. The latter resided on his
property near Crystal Brook, where
he had made his home, and on this
estate all his family were born.
Towards the latter part of his life
he settled in Queensland, his death
occurring in this State in the year
1906. His widow (who lives in
Brisbane), five sons, and three
daughters survive him, the former

being all occupied in landed pursuits.
His third son, the subject of our
memoir, received his education at
various centres, concluding his
scholastic career at Drayton, Darling
Downs, when at the age of 16, there-
after entering upon a course of
training in the carpentering trade,
an occupation which he followed for
something lees than four years,
MR. D. J. MACDONALD.
during which period he gained a
knowledge and experience of this
business which was to prove ex-
tremely useful in the structural and
other developmental work connected
with his subsequent career as a
grazier. He was engaged for about
three years as a building contractor
in the Blackall district, satisfying
his natural inclination towards bush
life during this time by occasionally
taking on droving and other work in
connection with stock, in which he
was well versed, h„,ing been
familiar with the wool-growing
industry from his boyhood, which
was spent on his father’s property.
The contracts which he completed in
the district surrounding Blackall
include the homesteads at “Home-
bush” and “Bloomfield.” In the
year 1912 he spent a brief period at
“Ryandale,” soon after undertaking
the management of “Bloomfield” on
behalf of the owner, Mr. H. Moffat,
and has since been occupied with his
duties on this estate, which, at time
of writing, he administers, in
conjunction with “Randwick,” a
personal venture upon which he
embarked five years later, purchas-
ing this property from Mr. Charles
Hoff in 1917. “Randwick,” which
was already stocked with sheep at
the time of Mr. MacDonald’s
purchase, is well developed, being
fenced and subdivided into five
paddocks, and watered by a sub-
artesian bore, which in addition to
the provision afforded by several
natural holes and a bore on an
adjoining property renders a fair
water supply. Further development
in regard to water conservation is in
course of progress. The estate, which
is situated 25 miles south of Blackall,
on the Ravensbourne Road, em-
braces 25,000 acres, comprising both
downs and nicely-timbered myall and
boree country, with belts of gidya
scrub, the latter slightly predomin-

CARL AUGUST FERDINAND
ZIEBELL, “Rangeview,” Hatton
Vale, is the third son of the late
Axigust Ziebell, a native of Romel-
berg, Germany, where he carried on
business as a stonecutter. In the
year 1887 August Ziebell’s eldest son
while on a visit to London heard
attractive stories of the splendid
opportunities awaiting young men of
energy and ability in the great over-
seas continent of Australia. Young
Carl, then a lad of 16, having been
born at Lauenberg in 1870, where he
also received a rudimentary educa-
tion, was induced by his brother on
his return home to join him in emi-
grating from the Fatherland to this
enchanted region. Accordingly the
two young men left Harzburg on
felling timber on behalf of various
landholders, and eventually made
his way to Bundaberg, where he
secured a position in Messrs. Young
Bros.’ sugar mill. Not finding the
enforced association with Kanaka
labourers congenial, he departed for
Cairns, and before finally settling on
the land worked on the wharves at
Mackay for two years. Eventually
he purchased his present homestead
block at Hatton Vale, comprising
160 acres, upon which a little culti-
vation had already been attempted.
He at once set to work to clear and
improve this area, with the result
that to-day he is proprietor of one
of the most thriving mixed-farming
industries in the district, in which

emigrants aboard the clipper ship
“Ocean Chief,” which reached More-
ton Bay from the Old Country on
November 2, 1862, was the late
William Dean, whose personality and
name still are well remembered in
Warwick and the surrounding dis-
trict. Mr. Dean was accompanied by
his family, amongst whom was his
son, James Dean, who now is
manager of the flourishing branch of
Messrs. Barnes & Co., Ltd., at Allora.
The late William Dean started
business life as a fuel merchant in
Stockport, England. Soon after
landing in Queensland (about 1864)
he purchased a farm at Qxley Creek,
near Brisbane. He engaged in mixed

raising are the principal factors.
Mr. Ziebell is essentially a home-
loving man, who cares little to be
associated with public affairs;
consequently he has not figured
prominently on any local committees
or associations, but in a quiet way
aided and abetted by his wife he has
always been ready to lend a helping
hand in any work tending to pro-
mote the welfare of the district. In
1900 he married Emma Louisa,
daughter of the late Johann Ludwig
Knopke, one of the pioneer settlers
of Hatton Vale, and of this union

long celebrated for its production of
lucerne. This venture proved most
successful and profitable, and it led
to Mr. Dean’s determination to

relinquish active work, his impelling
motive for doing so being his desire
to spend his westering days near his
son and grandchildren at Allora.
There he spent about 12 years of
calm, till, in his eighty-fourth year,
came the last call. Mr. Dean was a
pillar of the Wesleyan Church, to
which he devoted all his spare time
and energy. As an ardent local
preacher he was widely known
and revered, and practically every
important office open to a layman in
the Church he had filled and
adorned. Mr. Dean’s son, James,
was exactly 11 years of age when the
“Ocean Chief” dropped anchor in
Moreton Bay. He was born in
Manchester on November 2, 1851, a
year memorable because of the great
exhibition of textiles that was
opened and which did so much in
promoting the export trade in Man-
chester goods. At the Portwood
Wesleyan Methodist day school, in
Stockport, young Dean received a
solid primary education. About two
years before leaving school a storm
blew down the building, injuring
young Dean and killing several of his
school-fellows. Naturally the nerve-
shaking experience is vividly remem-
bered by him. At Oxley Creek only
a very primitive private school was
available, and before James was out
of his teens his father decided to put
him to work on the farm. Up to the
age of twenty-one he remained with
his father, learning all that was to be
learned in scientific farming and
management. Then came an event
that changed, moulded, made, or
ruined so many lives. The Gympie
goldfield was discovered, and the
famous rush to it furiously set in.
Mr. Dean was smitten with the gold
fever. He went with the rush, but
was amongst the myriads who
drew blanks. He worked under-
ground, he worked at timber getting,
until after a year’s experience, he
abandoned the field and rejoined his
father on the farm at Warwick.
There he met fresh misfortune. He
suffered a severe sunstroke, the
effects of which forced him ultimately
to abandon agricultural pursuits for

the sphere of commerce. He obtained
employment with Messrs. T. F.
Merry & Co., general storekeepers in
Toowoomba, as delivery clerk, and at
a later period he was similarly
employed by F. H. Holberton & Co.
From this time on Mr. Dean’s
fortunes rose. He was invited to
take a position with the firm of
Messrs. G. P. Barnes & Co., at
Warwick, which business has since
grown to such imposing proportions.
Until January, 1887, he remained at
the Warwick branch, and then he
was transferred to the management
of the Allora branch. Not long after
this firm was formed into a limited
liability company, and Mr. Dean
became one of the first shareholders,
remaining manager at Allora. He
is now one of the directors of the
company. He has a farm of 184
acres on the “Goomburra” repur-
chased estate, which he works on the
share system. Mr. Dean has held
many important public positions,
filling the mayoral chair on two
occasions, and is regarded as one of
Allora’s leading men. He is a
Justice of the Peace for Queensland,
New South Wales, and Victoria. In
October, 1879, he married Mary
Harding, daughter of the late David
Wyeth, of Toowoomba, and has issue
three sons and two daughters. His
eldest son, William Arthur, on
leaving the Toowoomba Grammar
School, entered the service of
Barnes & Co., Limited, at Allora,
under his father’s management. He
began behind the counter, later
taking charge of the clerical work.
He is now a shareholder in the com-
pany and sub-manager of the Allora
branch. The second son, Edwin
Clayton, after spending some time at
the Ipswich Grammar School entered
commercial life. He began at the
foot of the ladder at the branch his
father has been in charge of so long.
The experience thus gained brought
him under the notice of commercial
men outside the firm, and he was
offered the management of E.
Rich & Co.’s store at Goondiwindi,
which he accepted. The third son,
Raymond James Dean, is in the
service of the Union Bank of
MR. W. A. DEAN.
Australia, Ltd. Commencing at Clif-
ton branch he has since held various
positions at several centres, and for
the past few years has acted as
accountant at Gympie.


WILLIAM JOHN DAVIS,
J.P., “Glenroy,” Stonehenge, was
born on the Wolloombi, New South
Wales, on April 2, 1857, and is the
son of Mr. William Davis, a native
MR. W. J. DAVIS.
of New South Wales. The latter
gentleman is of Welsh descent, his
late father having occupied the acres
owned by many generations of his
Celtic progenitors, who followed
agrarian avocations thereon in the
valleys of Wales. Mr. Davis, sen.,
resides at Glen Innes, the autumn of
his days being spent in well-earned
retirement, after a lifetime occupied
with farming pursuits. Both he and
the good wife, who shared the joys
and sorrows, the hopes and disap-
pointments, and the hardships inci-
dental to life on the land in early
years, are respected and esteemed as
having honourably done their part
as citizens of Australia. The gentle-
man under review was educated at
Inverell, New South Wales, leaving
school at the age of 14 in order to
assist his father in the conduct of the
home farm, and remaining thus
engaged until attaining to man’s
estate, when he started life on his
own account. For several years he
followed various kinds of bush work,
chiefly droving, contract fencing, and
carrying. He was engaged in the
latter occupation for a period of 17
years, pursuing his calling with two
horse teams on the route between
Barcaldine and the South Australian
border. It is worthy of record that
he was responsible for the first load-
ing carried to Birdsville, near the
border, from the Queensland side,
this being delivered in the middle
nineties. In the year 1902, having
retired from the carrying trade, he
invested his hard-won capital in the
land, taking up “Glenroy,” origin-
ally a part of “Bimerah” Station, a
resumption of which occurred in
that year. This block consisted of
10,000 acres, but has since been
enlarged by the selection and pur-
chase of adjoining country at dif-
ferent times, so that at time of
writing the property boasts of an
area of four times that acreage.
Wool-growing is the chief industry
carried on by the owner, the flock
consisting of merinos founded on
“Bimerah” Station sheep, the strain
being improved from time to time
by the introduction of rams from the
Southern States. The property is
highly developed, and a good flock
may be carried with safety in any
season, a splendid water supply
being provided by the output of a
sub-artesian bore which has been
sunk on the estate, and by dams.
The structural improvements are
also of the most up-to-date descrip-
tion, these including fences of six
wires, and the necessary subdivisions.
The comfortable homestead on
“Glenroy” was built to replace the
earlier residence, and contains the
various modern conveniences which
assist so materially in mitigating the
severe conditions of the western
climate. Gas and water are con-
veniently laid on all over the house,
which is connected with Longreach
by telephone. The run is composed
of mixed country, comprising Mit-
chell grass downs and lightly-
timbered land, which affords good
shade for the stock. Mr. Davis was
created a Justice of the Peace by the

during the early years of the present
century, and has for several years
taken an active part in public
affairs. For nearly a decade he
fulfilled the duties of a councillor of
the Barcoo Shire, and in that
capacity frequently attended metro-
politan conferences of public bodies.
He is a member of the United

Margaret Jane, daughter of the late

efforts well deserve the recognition
of present and future generations.
Of the union there is a surviving
family of one son and four daughters.
The former, Arthur James Davis,
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces in 1916, and proceeded to the
front with the Field Engineers
Corps. When the Armistice was signed
he had been at the front for over
two years, fighting in the cause of
honour, liberty, and justice, and
proving himself a worthy son of the
parent whose unaided efforts have
achieved so much in the outback
spaces of Australia.

South Australian firm of Elder,
Smith & Co., Limited. In the year
1869 he journeyed to Queensland
and purchased from the late Vincent
Dowling a property called “Gouyea,”
situated in the far south-west of the
colony, having for partner in this
undertaking his brother-in-law, the
late Mr. Kenneth Budge. On the
death of the latter he admitted to
partnership the late W. R. Swan
and enlarged the area under his
supervision by the acquirement of
“Sedan,” “Welford,” and “Tintin-
chilla,” near Adavale, amalgamat-
ing these areas under the name of
“Milo,” the estate so called being
even at the present time one of the
best-known pastoral properties in
Australia. In the first instance only
horned stock were pastured on the
run owned by Messrs. Cudmore &
Swan, but under the later regime
sheep were also introduced, the
large area of country which at that
time comprised “Milo” depasturing
both flocks and herds, the manage-
ment of the estate being undertaken
by Mr. Lance Beck. During the
seventies, in order to secure an
increase of capital for the purpose of
enlarging the firm’s operations, the
late Sir Thomas Elder and Mr. R.
Barr Smith were taken into the
partnership, the management being
placed in the hands of the late A. 11.

Pegler, and most of the improve-
ments on "Milo,” then one of the
largest pastoral properties in
Queensland, were made under his
supervision. Mr. Pegler held an
interest in “Milo,” and prior to his
decease in August, 1918, was one of
the best-known pastoral managers in
Queensland. In the year 1888 Mr.
Cudmore disposed of his interests in
“Milo,” “Ned’s Corner,” and “Par-
inga.” During his term as manag-
ing director the first-mentioned
property carried a herd of 45,000
cattle and a flock of 600,000
sheep. In March, 1899, he sent his
eldest son, James Kenneth, to
Queensland, where the latter took
up the country which is now known
as “Tara,” comprising lands which
were originally attached to the his-
toric “Barcaldine Downs,” “Saltern
Creek,” and “Wellshot” Stations,
resumptions of which occurred at
about that time. Meanwhile the
late gentleman retired to “Paringa
Hall,” Glenelg, South Australia,
where he had built a fine home in
1882, and where he resided until
the time of his death in the year
1912. Mrs. Cudmore only survived
her husband by a few months. Of
a family of six sons and five
daughters, all but one of the sons
are engaged in the pastoral industry,
the exception being Dr. Arthur
Murray Cudmore, who elected to
follow the medical profession, and
whose efforts in the service of his
country throughout the whole period
of the Great World War (1914-18)
gained for him the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel. Dr. A. M. Cnd-
more served at Lemnos during the

Mr. James K. Cudmore,

follow the industry to
which his immediate pro-
genitors had devoted them-
selves. As already set forth
he came to Queensland in
1889, being then in his
twenty-second year, and
under instructions from his
father took up the lands
which comprise the pre-
sent “Tara” Station. From
that estate, which has
continued to be the prin-
cipal pastoral head-quarters of
the firm, though many other
interests of a similar nature have
since been acquired by its mem-
bers, he administered the joint
properties for the ensuing twenty-
four years, retiring to Sydney in

a member of the United Pastoralists
and Grazing Farmers’ Association of
Queensland and has devoted much
time and attention to the interests
of that body as well as
to various other movements
of a national character,
included among which may
be mentioned the Pastoral
Federal Council of Aus-
tralia, at whose annual
conferences he has been
present during the past
three years as representa-
tive of Queensland. Apart
from his multitudinous in-
terests Mr. Cudmore has
found time to devote to
items of sport, the turf
in particular being one
of his favourite forms of
recreation. For several
years he was president of
the Barcaldine Race Club,
and also sat as a member
of the executive of the

has held a Commission as Justice
of the Peace. He occupied a
seat on the Aramac Shire Council
until the formation of the Ilfra-
combe Council, of which he was one
of the original members. He was
the first to occupy the presidential

manager of the station properties
owned by the firm, was born at
Glenelg, South Australia, on Feb-

of his scholastic career at St. Peter’s
College he entered the office of
George P. Harris, Scarfe, & Co.,
Limited, hardware merchants, etc.,
Adelaide, where he remained for five
years. Resigning his position in the
year 1904 he came to Queensland in
order to personally enter the pas-

ever since resided on the property,
taking over the reins of administra-
tion on the retirement of his elder
brother in the year 1913. He is a

public life of the district and is vice-
president of the Barcaldine Pastoral
and Agricultural Society. He is a
hearty supporter of most forms of
sport and is a member of the
executive of the Central Queensland
Racing Association and on the
committees of all the local race
clubs. Mr. D. C. Cudmore married
in the year 1910 Kathleen, daughter
of the late William Pile, erstwhile
owner of “Cuthro” Station, South
Australia, and a well-known pastor-
alist of the River Murray districts
in that State. “Tara” embraces
some 145,000 acres of country
composed of Mitchell grass downs,
timbered chiefly with boree, gidya,
whitewood, and dead finish. When
the several areas comprising the run
were taken up very little had been
done in the way of effecting
improvements, a state of affairs
which Mr. J. K. Cudmore immedi-
ately set about to remedy. A
scheme of development was
decided upon. the first
work taken in hand being
the sinking of three artesian
bores to a depth of over
3,000 feet, thus assuring
a full and safe supply of
water for the stock. Miles
of fencing were erected
and the run subdivided
into a number of paddocks
for the convenient handling
of the first flock of 40,000
ewes and wethers intro-
duced to the pastures.
These were purchased from
“Isis Downs.” In the first
instance “Havilah” rams
were used for breeding
purposes, but later rams
from the celebrated


“Boonoke” stud were given a
trial, tire experiment yielding such
excellent results that this strain
has been used on the estate
ever since. The property known
as “The Rand,” also situated
in the Mitchell district, in the
vicinity of the town of Long-
reach, was next acquired by the
firm. It consists of 35,000 acres of
good grazing land which, like those
comprising the parent property, are
devoted to sheep. At the present
time woollies to the number
of 76,000 head graze over the
pastures of “Tara” and “The Rand.”
Other pastoral ventures which were
included in the joint ownership at
different times were formed into
company concerns, the brothers

“Tara” and assisted in the general
administration of that station until
their relinquishment of these duties
was necessitated by the more press-

FRANCIS GEORGE COLLINS,
J.P., owner of “Belldeen” Station,
near Banana, was born in 1863 at
Ipswich, Queensland, and is a son
of the late James Carden Collins, of
MR. JAMES GARDEN COLLINS.
Rockhampton, in this State. He re-
ceived his education at the Ipswich
Grammar School, and at 19 years of
age turned his attention to the pas-
toral industry, gaining his early
experience as jackaroo on “Glen
Prairie” Station, the property of
Messrs. Harvey, Holt, & Co., situ-
ated some 60 or 70 miles north of
Rockhampton. After three years on
this station, during which period he
made the most of the opportunities
afforded him for obtaining a
thorough knowledge of stock, he was
offered, and accepted, the manage-
ment of “Moolboolaman” Station,
in the Gin Gin district, owned by
Mr. A. P. Barton, and carrying
4,000 head of cattle. Here he re-
mained until 1892, when he severed
his connection with Mr. Barton, and
in the following year launched out
on his own account, taking up
his present property, “Belldeen,”
under the 1884 Lands Act. This
holding, comprising 17,000 acres of
undulating volcanic country, was at
that time totally unimproved, but
promised well from the point of view
of grass and water supply, a good
natural flow of water being provided
by Neville Creek, which runs
through the property. Mr. Collins
purchased 1,100 head of cattle at
about <£2 per head, and introduced
them on the run; and setting to
work with energy and promptitude
at the task of development, he soon
had his schemes for improvement
well under way. Numerous wells
were sunk, varying in depth up to
40 feet, and subsequently the {flans
for conservation were considerably
extended by the sinking of a bore, a
copious supply of water being struck
at 183 feet from the surface. A large
portion of the holding was covered
with ironbark timber and brigalow
scrub, whicli the ringbarkers’ axes
considerably reduced, sufficient
being left for shelter for the stock.
Substantial stockyards were erected,
and due attention was given to dips
and other necessary provision for
the well-being of the herd; while
round about the homestead rose a
number of outbuildings, fitted with
the usual accessories, and each mark-
ing a steady advance in prosperity.
MR. FRANCIS GEORGE COLLINS.
As Mr. Collins’ operations enlarged
he found it necessary to take up
additional grazing land, and for this
purpose secured an occupation
licence of 180 square miles of coun-
try in the same district, which
afforded considerable relief to the
home property. In 1902, in common
with many others, he was a very
heavy sufferer through the severe
drought conditions which prevailed,
and his herd was practically deci-
mated, only 400 head of cattle being
left on the pastures. At the present
time about 700 head of cattle and
about 200 horses are pastured on
the run. Hitherto the herd has con-
sisted almost exclusively of Here-
fords, Mr. Collins having had from
the first a decided predilection for
this popular breed. More recently,
however, the merits of the red poll
have commanded his consideration,
with the result that the old favour-
ite is giving way to some extent to
the poley. Mr. Collins takes an
active interest in the advancement
of the community, and is recognized
as one of the leading men of his dis-
trict. In 1890 he became a member
of the Kolan Shire Council, and re-
tained his seat for three years, when
he was elected as councillor of the
Banana Shire, and six years later
was made chairman of this body,
which office he retained up to
1914. He is a member of the
Masonic fraternity, and since 1890
has acted as secretary to the
Dawson Amateur Picnic Racing
Club, of which he was the organizer.
He is fond of a good horse, and has
bred some meritorious performers,
among which may be mentioned
“Guido,” who ran second in the
Central Queensland Derby in 1914,
and has carried his colours to victory
on several occasions. Mr. Collins is
a noted horseman, and has himself
ridden in various flat and hurdle
races. He was also a fine athlete,
and has won many prizes for pigeon-
shooting. In 1896 his marriage took
place with Wilhelmina, daughter of
Mr. John Murray, Inspector of
Police, of Cardwell, Queensland, of
which union there are two daughters

and one son. The latter gentleman,
Mr. Charles Francis Collins, enlisted
in the Australian Imperial Forces in
1916, and proceeded to the scene of
hostilities.

WILLIAM HENRY CHARL-
TON MACLEAN, “Wandoo” Sta-
tion, Banana, was born at Bathurst,
New South Wales, in 1853, and is
the third son of the late John Shand
MR. W. H. C. MACLEAN.
Maclean, a schoolmaster of that
place. The gentleman under review
received his early education under
private tuition in his own home, and
when seven years of age accompanied
his family to Queensland, where his
father took up a block of land in
the Burnett district, and engaged in
sheep-grazing. Two years later a
removal was made to the Dawson
district, where the “Gyrandah”
holding was selected under the old
original lease system. The death of
Mr. John Shand Maclean occurring
in that year, his widow and 10
children continued the enterprise,
but encountering a run of dry
seasons, found it difficult to make
ends meet, and in the early seventies
disposed of “Gyrandah and pur-
chased “Cracow” run, comprising
100 square miles of country, in many
respects suitable for sheep. For four
years the family remained on this
holding, and when in 1878 it was
sold to Messrs. Palmes and Ather-
ton, Mr. W. H. C. Maclean turned
to droving and horse-dealing, and
undertook some long overlanding
trips which extended from the gulf
country to Melbourne. In 1890 he
took 2,700 bullocks from Rotheram
Park, on the Mitchell River, near
Cooktown, to Wellington, New
South Wales, a distance of between
1,700 and 1,800 miles, which occu-
pied eight months. Mr. Maclean
received 19s. per head on this jour-
ney, and netted £1,700. In 1887
he purchased from the late Michael
Pearce, “Wandoo,” a property of
16,000 acres of unimproved land,
which he has converted into a fine
grazing farm. His developmental
work has been rewarded with
marked success, and the property
now carries from 1,500 to 2,000 head
of cattle. “Wandoo” is watered by
bores, which at a depth of 86 feet
yield a flow of water which is more
than equal to any demands made
upon it, and as a result of ring-
barking operations, natural grasses
and herbage abound, making splen-
did pasturage for the stock. Mr.
Maclean continued the strenuous life
of a drover for many years, combin-
ing his other interests with this
occupation until he found himself
firmly established as a pastoralist.
After the year 1900 he began
to confine his efforts principally
to stock-dealing, placing the man-
agement of the station in the
hands of his sons. In 1910
he acquired further property
in the shape of “Cocklebinda”
Station (aboriginal for “black kan-
garoo”), on Pinch Creek, 41,000
acres in extent, and consisting of
undulating country well adapted for
breeding purposes with a carrying
capacity of about 2,500 head of
cattle. Shortly afterwards he pre-
sented his two sons each with a third
of his landed estate, and has since
lived in semi-retirement at Rock-
hampton. Mr. Maclean is a public-
spirited man, and has done his
share of official work in the
interests of the com-
munity. He served for
several years on the
Banana Shire Council,
and afterwards was
elected to a seat on
the Livingstone Coun-
cil, which he retained
until 1914, when he
retired from public
office. He received the
Commission of the
Peace from the Den-
ham Administration.
A keen sportsman, he
has carried off many
honours in the racing
field, and is a cordial
advocate of general outdoor recrea-
tion of an athletic character. Mr.
Maclean married in 1881 Nora

WILLIAM GERARD WOOL-
RYCH, of “Woolthorpe” Station,
Banana, was born in 1865 at Crowle,
Worcestershire, England, of which
place his father was vicar. He is a
member of a very old Saxon family,
records being extant which prove
that Adam Woolfric, of Dudmas-
ton, who was created a baronet in
1231, was one of his progenitors. In
later times the name was perverted
to Woolrych, by which it has since
been known. The gentleman under
review received his education under
private tuition, and at the close of
his studies he entered the merchant
service, being then 17 years of age.
During the following two years he
made two tours of the world, and
was at Sumatra about the period

some of the islands were engulfed,

being wiped out with 80,000 of its
inhabitants. Upon the death of his
father in 1884 Mr. Woolrych re-
turned home, and relinquishing sea-
faring pursuits, decided to engage
in the pastoral industry in Aus-
tralia. Landing at Melbourne, and
remaining there for a few weeks,
subsequently he came to Queensland,
where he took a position as jack-
aroo on “Auburn” Station, in the
Burnett district, then the property
of Messrs. Goldsborough, Mort, and
Co., Limited. Here he remained for
two and a half years, during which
he obtained a thorough insight into
the business of stockraising; but
desiring to enlarge his experience of
commercial life, in 1887 he resigned
his position on the station and
joined the service of the British
India Company in Brisbane. In
1888 he left this office to associate
himself with the staff of the Queens-
land National Bank, and in 1892,
having gained all the
banking experience
necessary for his pur-
pose, he decided to
launch out in pas-
toral enterprise in
conjunction with
Messrs. E. R. Row-
botham and H. R.
Hunter (whom he later
bought out), he took
up grazing land under
the conditions of the
1884 Lands Act. The
holding is situated
on the Dawson River, where Mr.
Woolrych became the pioneer sett-
ler, and purchasing sheep from
“Normanby” Station, the property
of Messrs. Wallis & Casey, he per-
sonally overlanded them to their
new pastures, the trip occupying
about two months.
The area of the block
thus acquired was
20,000 acres of open
country, totally un-
improved, and Mr.
Woolrych’s first act
was to cut suitable
timber and erect a
homestead with his
own hands. This ac-
complished fencing was
taken in hand and the
necessary stockyards
built, which, with
shearing-shed and other outbuild-
ings, occupied a considerable amount
of his time and attention for many
months. The property, which con-
sists of open downs and plains tim-
bered with brigalow, with gum and
coolibah flats near the river, is now
highly improved, and
is subdivided into
paddocks of suitable
size by many miles
of fencing. The
original type of sheep
introduced upon the
run by Mr. Woolrych
was the ever-popular
merino, but there
are now a number
of crossbreds, among
which the Lincoln
strain predominates.
From 10,000 to 12,000
sheep usually compose the flock, and
in addition to these a herd of from
500 to 800 cattle are depastured,
which in the past have been confined
to the shorthorn breed, but are now

of the Rev. R. N. Kane, of Suckley,
England, a descendant of the Irish
family of Denbigh, whose place in
the peerage dates back many cen-
tures, Mr. Woolrych has one son.
S. BARTLETT JERRARD,
“Warraka Downs,” Taroom, was
born in the year 1883, and is the
fourth son of the late Henry Clapcott
Jerrard, a descendant of an ancient

back to a period before the Con-
quest. Tradition claims for the
antiquity of the line that it is an
offshoot" of the Sanford Orcas
family, drawings of the Sanford
stock; and again that the family
lost a property at the time of the
Great Rebellion; and yet again that
a member was executed for conspir-
acy, there being at the present time
a pamphlet in the British Museum
entitled “A True and Impartial
Relation of the Death of Mr. J.
Jerrard, who was Beheaded on
Tower Hill, 1654.” The late Mr.
11. C. Jerrard, with his two
brothers, arrived in the land of
the Southern Cross in the year 1862,
landing in Rockhampton after a
voyage of six months’ duration.
Each brother received a grant of 50
acres of land shortly after his
arrival, Mr. Henry Clapcott Jerrard
subsequently selling his for the
price of £1 per acre. His first
association with the grazing in-
dustry was as a jackaroo on
“Dumgree” and ''Prairie” Stations,
where he acquired a thorough know-
ledge of the business. In the
year 1870 he took up country on his
own account on Scoria Creek, and
six years later married Miss Mary
Callow, taking his bride to this
pioneer home of his first grazing
area, a property which he worked
successfully for ten years. At
the termination of this period he
sold “Scoria Creek” and purchased
“Rochedale” Station, which at that
time covered an area of 250 square
miles, situated 25 miles from Taroom
and 65 from Miles, his brothers
being associated with him in this
proposition. Both cattle and sheep
were run on the property, about 5,000
head of the former being carried. At
a very much later period the late
Mr. Jerrard purchased “Warraka
Downs” from Mr. James Langham,
this transaction being effected in
year 1915, leaving a family of three
sons. He was created a Justice of the
Peace in the year 1885, and took his
place on the bench when cases of im-
portance were listed for hearing.

Mr. S. Bartlett Jerrard was

assisting his father in the adminis-
tration of that estate. In 1907 he
took over “Warraka Downs” (un-
stocked), where he made his home,
taking up his residence there on his
marriage in 1910. In the meantime
he had erected the homestead and

and adjoining “Cracow” Station,
from Mr. Tidswell, Toowoomba, but
parted with this estate 12 months
later, subsequently acquiring “Bau-
hinia Vale,” also situated on the
Dawson, and including an area of
11,000 acres. His three properties,
“Rochedale,” “Warraka Downs,”
and “Bauhinia Vale” occupy country
to the extent of 140, 16, and 18
square miles, respectively, and are
well watei’ed by rivers, creeks, and
lagoons, which provide an abundant
supply at all seasons of the year,
which has not failed even during the
most severe droughts. All told, the
three runs carry from 3,000 to 4,000
head of cattle, the shorthorn type
being favoured, and in addition a
sufficient number of horses are kept
to work the estates. The home
property, “Warraka Downs,” em-
braces about 10,000 acres of undu-
lating country, composed of black
soil flats and sand ridges. The
residence is of the bungalow type,
and possesses high airy rooms and
wide verandahs. In all his pastoral
undertakings Mr. Jerrard has been
eminently successful, and has been
fortunate in escaping heavy losses
through drought and other causes.
He is a keen lover of all forms of
sport, being more particularly inter-
ested in cricket, a game in which he
excels. He married in 1910 Jessie,
daughter of Mr. Alexander Stewart,
of “Millera” and “Barney Downs”
Stations, in the New England
district of New South Wales, and
has three children.
Councillor JOHN GILLILAND,
of “Mountain View,” Samson Creek,
is a son of the late John Gilliland,
who was connected with the cotton
trade in his native County, Armagh,
Ireland, before coming to Queens-
land. The late John Gilliland was a
passenger by the sailing-ship “Duke
of Edinburgh,” and after a trip
extending over six months arrived
at Moreton Bay, whence he tran-
shipped to a lighter, which landed
him at the Old Wharf, near the
Emigration Depot, at South Bris-
bane. He obtained an engagement
with Messrs. Grimes Bros., sugar
and arrowroot mill owners at Oxley
Creek, where he rose to the position
of foreman, and continued in this
connection for 13 years. He resigned
his position to enter upon farming
pursuits, and for this purpose pur-
chased a property at South Pine,
consisting of 40 acres of scrub
country, which he cleared and
worked successfully until the time of
his death. The late gentleman left
a family of two daughters and five
sens, of whom the subject of this
review was born at Oxley in 1867.
He attended school until he reached
his twelfth year, after which he
assisted his father on the home farm,
and became, even at that early age,
something of an expert in his calling,
being entrusted with the manage-
ment of almost every branch of work
at one time or another. At 14 he
turned his attention to the timber-
getting industry, obtaining employ-
ment with a Mr. James Whallin, of
Branch Creek, at a wage of 12s. per
week and keep. After remaining
with this gentleman for 12 months
the enterprising lad had saved
enough money to invest in a horse
and saddle, and with this slender
equipment decided to strike out on
his own account. Riding as far as
Samson Vale, he met with a Mr.
Richard Winn, who owned several
bullock teams, which he used for
hauling timber to North Pine,
whence it was rafted down the Pine
River to Deep Water Bend, at which
point steamers were provided to tow
the logs to Brisbane. These methods
continued in vogue until railway
facilities rendered the more cumber-
some system no longer necessary.
Mr. Gilliland subsequently spent
two years with a Mr. Deitz, who was
engaged in the same line of business,
and when relinquishing this employ
leased from the same gentleman a
farm of about 100 acres, situated at
Samson Vale, when he started on
his own account in dairying and
general farming. This proved a
failure, as in three months he spent
the whole of his small capital
(£4O) without getting any returns.
Undaunted, he made a second ven-
ture, this time renting a small
holding in the same district. Better
results followed his efforts on this
property, and in time he raised
enough cattle to stock his present
homestead, an unimproved block of
155 acres of very rough country,
upon which Mr. Gilliland made his
first es&ay at forming a home, which
consisted of a slab “humpy” with
pine palings for a roof. After felling
the scrub he cleared and cultivated a
portion of the block, and since that
early period has continued to
increase his holding, until now he
owns over 400 acres of well-developed
pasture land. He has a first-class
herd of Ayrshires crossed with the
shorthorn type, and has met with
much success in his dairying opera-
tions, the Caboolture Butter Fac-
tory, in which he is a shareholder,
taking the entire output of cream.
He has a splendid team of bullocks,
which lie uses for timber-getting
purposes, both the homestead and
adjoining selections being rich in
valuable forest trees. Mr. Gilliland
interests himself in local public
affairs, and has been a Shire coun-
cillor for a number of years, acting
as chairman in 1912. He is an ex-
member of the school committee,
and has taken a prominent part in
the affairs of the local rifle club.
He married Emma, daughter of Mr.
Jacob Hobbs, of Emmet, near Bris-
bane, and has seven sons and seven
daughters.
JOHN MOODY, “Alpha,” Wyan-
dra, was born at Mudgee, New South
Wales, on April 22, 1860, and is the
third son of the late William Moody,
one of those hardy pioneers of British
birth, who forsook the comparative
security of civilized life for the pre-
carious task of building up a home
and fortune for himself and his
children in a. land only then in the
making, under the Southern Cross.
The founder of the name (which is
a well-known one in England, the
family having its representatives in
almost every county) in Australia
arrived in Sydney in 1850, his in-
tention being to pursue his trade of
bricklayer and stonemason in the
larger centres of settlement. For
the purpose of building himself a
home he purchased a block of land
on the site where the great emporium
of Anthony Horden now stands. A
year later, however, when the early
gold rushes occurred in Victoria,
seized with the gold fever, he ex-
changed his block of land for a horse
and cart and with a mate did the
overland trip to the scene of activity,
leaving his young wife in New South
Wales. Fortune smiled upon him
for a time, but, owing to the tide
of speculation which formed part of
the life on the fields, he lost all he
had acquired and subsequently

as opportunity arose, and con-
tinued in the land of his adoption
for close on half a century, playing
a useful part in the development of
the country. Of his family of
ten children, Mr. John Moody, of
MR. W. C. MOODY.
“Alpha,” was the third son, and as
a lad obtained book-instruction from
his mother under the parental roof-
tree. This necessarily was limited,
as even as a small boy he had his
allotted tasks of a strenuous nature
in connection with the farm work to
perform. As his years increased,
however, and he realized the impor-
tance of education, he set himself
to private study, by which means he
was able to acquire a creditable
knowledge of books and of ordinary
school subjects. Whilst still a youth
he obtained a position on a cattle
station, where his duties embraced
all branches of work among stock,
including the responsible one of
droving, and here he continued until
1876. In that year he took up his
first block of country, but this prov-
ing unworkable on account of the
lack of water supply, he disposed of
it some four years later, and, in part-
nership with Mr. John Lindsay,
purchased “Rookwood,” on the Mar-
anoa River, Queensland. In 1883
he sold his interest in this property,
and with the same gentleman pur-
chased “Muggleton,” on the head of
the Yeulba Creek, which, in turn,
shortly afterwards was disposed of
at a profit. The partnership between
Mr. Moody and Mr. Lindsay was
then dissolved by mutual consent,
and Mr. Moody invested his capital
in teams, and started in the carrying
business. For the following seven
or eight years no teamster became
better known or more popular than
the gentleman under review, and all
over the central, western, and south-
western districts, as well as in the
more northerly tracts of New South
Wales, his name was a familiar word.
In 1891 he entered upon commercial
pursuits near St. George, remaining
there for some two or three years.
He next went north-west to Bollon,
and sold out after about twelve
months, having decided that for
him better chances of success lay
further west, and when what is now
the town of Wyandra was no more
than a mulga scrub Mr. Moody
with his wife and young family came
to the place and opened up a hotel
and store at the time that the rail-
way line from Charleville to Cunna-
mulla was under construction. For
the ensuing 17 years this hostelry
was recognized as a most popular
institution, not only by the travel-
ling public, whose needs it catered
for, but also receiving the full
support of the surrounding station-
holders on account of the excellence
of its management. Both Mr. Moody
and his wife were ever on the alert
to serve their patrons, and many
kind actions marked their days,
which very frequently were simply
the outcome of a neighbourly spirit
rather than prompted by business
policy. About 1895 Mr. Moody took
up a block of land within eight
miles of Wyandra township, and

interests serves as chairman of

RICHARD ASHMORE ROBIN-
SON HOPKINS, J.P., “Sunny-
mead,” Rose Bay, Sydney, was born
on December 22, 1845, at “Benares,”
an old historical property in the vic-
inity of Dapto, lllawarra, New South
Wales, owned by his late father,
Captain Richard John Hopkins,
who hailed from the Motherland, his
forbears having been established in
the County of Kent for many genera-
tions. He was in command of a
merchant vessel which plied between
the Old Land and the new, and on
the termination of one of his voyages,
he relinquished his seafaring career
and took up country in the lllawarra
district, naming his estate “Ben-
ares,” which is still one of the
noted properties of that district, and
was administered by its first owner
until the time of his retirement
from active life. He died in Sydney
in the year 1876. Mr. R. A. R.
Hopkins, received his primary edu-
cation at a private school in Sydney
conducted by a Mr. Horniman, and
concluded his academic course in
Parramatta at the establishment of
that well-known and highly-reputed
scholar, the late Dr. Woolls. Thence
he proceeded to “Brookong” Sta-
tion, one of the most important of
the historical properties of the
Mother State. Attracted by the
hidden possibilities of the great
undeveloped spaces of the north,
he seized upon the earliest
opportunity of visiting the newly-
formed colony, wherein he arrived
in the year 1864, shortly afterwards
securing a position in the Clermont
district as jackaroo on “Gordon
Downs” Station, then the property
of the late Mr. Gordon Sandiman.
After two years spent at the above-
mentioned station, the late owner
showed his appreciation of the young
man’s intelligent grip of the industry

amateur, devoting his energies to
racing affairs for the following two
years. In 1868 he again entered the
pastoral industry, accepting a

position on “Eosenthal,” near War-
wick, the property of The North
British Australasian Company. In
1871 he accepted the manage-
ment of “Redbank” Station, in the
Burnett district, which he adminis-
tered for the following 18 months,
at the termination of that period
assuming, in consequence of the sale
of “Redbank,” the control of
“Wonbah” Station, near Mount
Perry. In 1872 he married Miss
Emily Thompson, whose death
occurred twelve months later. The
lady was a daughter of a well-known
manager in the service of the Bank
of New South Wales. Of the union
there is issue a son, Sydney Munro
pursuits for a brief period, and
in 1875 joined the late Mr. Geary
and Mr. Ernest Henry in a mining
venture. Pie, however, eventually
sacrificed his financial interests in
the undertaking, and again turned
his attention to station life, accept-
ing a position as manager of
“Langlo Downs,” in the Warrego
district, where he remained in full
control for four years. On his advice
“Langlo Downs” was sold, following
which the formation of a partnership
between Mr. Donkin and Mr. Hop-
kins came under discussion, the
basis of which was that the last-
named gentleman should select new
country further west, but the
immediate offer of the management
of the far-famed “Wellshot” Sta-
tion put an end to these negotiations.
Mr. Hopkins accepted the post and
took over the reins of administration
in 1881 of “Wellshot,” which con-
sisted of 1,823 square miles of
open country carrying about 40,000
sbeep. His administration covered a
period extending over a quarter of a
century, and on attaining his sixtieth
year his ability received due recog-
nition from the directors of the New
Zealand and Australian Land Com-
pany, the firm promoting him to the
position of inspector for Queensland,
a position which he still holds.
In 1889 his company gave him twelve
months’ leave of absence, and this
period he spent in England. He was
gazetted to the Commission of Peace
in 1872, and is one of the three oldest
Justices in the State. He took a pro-
minent part in local affairs, and the
result of his energies in the arena of
Shire government is still apparent in
the west. Mr. Hopkins married

James, who succeeded him—having
previously been made Captain of
King’s Governor —was the first Lord
Livingston, his elevation to the
Peerage transpiring previous to
August 30, 1458. This gentleman
filled the office of Master of the
Household, and was one of the Privy
Council and High Chamberlain of
Scotland. He died in 1467, leaving
two sons, James and Alexander. The
former succeeded him, but having no
issue, his nephew, Sir John Living-

estates of Linlithgow, the youngest,
James, who acquired distinction and
riches in foreign wars, being created
Lord Almond in 1633, and Earl of
Callandar in 1641. Alexander, the
second Earl, was succeeded by his son
George in the time of the Civil War,
the latter suffering greatly for his
adherence to the cause of King
Charles 11., though on the restoration
of the monarchy, his services were
recognized by his appointment as one
of His Majesty’s Privy Council, as
Captain of the Royal Regiment of
Foot Guards and as Justice General
of Scotland. George married a
daughter of the Earl of Panure, and
at his death in 1690, left two sons
and a daughter, the younger son,
Alexander becoming third Earl
of Callandar, while George succeeded
to the Earldom of Linlithgow, and
was one of the Privy Council to King
William 111. of England, and a
Commissioner of the Royal Treasury.
He had no issue, so the title and
estate passed to his nephew, James,
fourth Earl of Callandar, who, as
Earl of Linlithgow and Callandar,
was one of the sixteen Peers of
Scotland in the third and fourth
Parliaments of Great Britain in
1710-13. Lord James Livingston was
implicated in the rebellion headed by
the Earl of Mar against George 1.,
and was attainted of high treason

the Earl of Dalhousie), Lord Semple,
Lord Elphinston, Montgomery, Earl

Marquis of Huntley, etc., etc.,
figure prominently in their marriage
records. The late John Livingston
made his advent to South Australia
in the year 1843. On the voyage
from the Old World he formed a
life-long friendship with a Mr.
McCallum, and, shortly after arrival
in South Australia, became engaged
in pastoral and grazing enterprise in
partnership with the latter, forming


a station called “Curratum,” the
connection continuing for about
twenty years. It is worthy of mention
that at Mr. Livingston’s station,
“Curratum,” was first received
news of the wreck of the
“Admella,” which foundered off Cape
Northumberland in August, 1859,
many lives being lost, and the
survivors, twenty-four in number,
rescued after a week of exposure and
suffering. Adam Lindsay Gordon
refers to the “Admella” in his
famous poem, “From the Wreck,”
inspired by his own headlong ride,
undertaken at midnight, from
“Curratum” to Mount Gambier, in
order to obtain succour for the ship-
wrecked people, the poet being at the
time of the disaster in Mr. Living-
ston’s employ as a stockrider. The
late John Livingston was a fine
example of the best type of pioneer
—one who in his life’s work helped
to lay the basis for the sound stock,
both flocks and herds, now bred in
the Mount Gambier district, both
woollies and horned stock coming
within the scope of operations at
“Curratum.” Horses were also bred
there and the famous “J. L.” brand
was in high repute among the equine
lovers of the period, the owner being
regarded as the most expert judge of
horse-flesh in South Australia. His
sons were noted riders and most
successful as amateur riders in many
racing events in their native State.
A keen racing man himself, his
straight methods rendered him most
popular and respected as a sportsman,
while his efforts in all matters affect-
ing the welfare of the district gained
for him the respect and approval
of all classes of the community
“VAULT.”
of which he formed a part. The
erection of the first church in the
Mount Gambier district was to a
great extent the result of his labours.
In the year 1886, at Ardno, Victoria,
the old pioneer crossed the Great
Divide, leaving an honourable name
to his descendants, and one that is
worthily borne by the various
members of the family which owes to
him its foundation. He married
Catherine, daughter of the late John
Steele, whose advent with his family
to South Australia occurred shortly
after the arrival of Mr. Livingston,
and of the union there were seven
sons and seven daughters. Three of
the former and five daughters
survive, Mr. Malcolm Livingston, the
owner of “Bonnie Downs,” being
the youngest living son. Of the
remaining two, the elder is Mr. John
Livingston, who for many years has
been prominently to the fore in the
political arena of South Australia as
member for Barker in the Federal
Parliament, building up a record
which will be handed down to
posterity in the annals of that State.
The fourth son is engaged in pastoral
pursuits on his property on the
border of Queensland and New
South Wales, being a well-known
figure in the local public life. The
late Mr. Livingston’s grandsons have
upheld the family honour in the
firing line'—two by participation in
the Boer War in 1899-1902, and
several in the course of the titanic
struggle which raged in Europe

from"'his earliest years, he gradually
assimilated a knowledge of all
matters relating to stock, and when
still but a lad was requisitioned to
assist his father and brothers in their
pastoral work. He continued to
crain further proficiency under the
careful supervision of his parent for
several years, eventually, in 1887,
the year following the decease of the
latter, making a start in the industry
on his own account by taking up a
block of grazing land in the Ardno
district of Victoria. To this block
he added further country by purchase
and proceeded with the development
of the whole, working the property
as a cattle and sheep proposition until
1893, when he sold out and took a
lease of “Collerina,” a well-known
pastoral property in New South
Wales. Subsequently, he purchased
“Collerina” outright, carrying on
there for about fifteen years. In
1908, realizing the greater scope for
expansion in the North, he decided
to visit Queensland with the view of
there embarking upon a pastoral
venture, materializing his intention
in the same year by the purchase of
‘ 1 Bonnie Down s, ’ ’ his present hoi ding.
On the conclusion of the transaction
connected with this purchase he
returned to New South Wales, and,
securing 5,000 highly-bred ewes, the
pick of the sheep, the milking cattle,
and the horses which he had bred on
“Collerina,” overlanded from there
to his then recently acquired property
in the Queen State, taking possession
in the year 1909. ‘‘Bonnie Downs,
which embraces 40,000 acres of
country equal to any, and superior
to most of the admittedly fine grazing
country in Western Queensland, is
composed of well-sheltered downs
abundantly clothed with Mitchell,
Flinders, and other good grasses. It
was but partly developed at the time
of his acquirement, and, among other
necessary improvements, lacked a
suitable dwelling, the result being
that, owing to the extreme difficulty
of then securing competent trades-
men, Mr. and Mrs. Livingston
occupied a tent during the first year
of their sojourn on the station. The
question of the homestead remaining
thus in abeyance, the initial efforts of
the owner were directed to even more
essential matters, such as the sub-
division of the run into paddocks and
the production of additional water
for the stock. In 1910, the year
following his advent to “Bonnie
Downs,” homestead and outbuildings
were erected on a bank of Lucella
Creek, on a site lying some 48 miles
from Olio—a railway station on the
Hughenden-Winton line, 100 miles
south of Hughenden and about 70
miles from Winton. From 1910 on-
wards development was continued
apace, with the result that, at time of

writing (1920), the property ranks
among the highly improved proposi-
tions.of this district. Many sub-
artesian wells, equipped with the
most modern appliances for conveying
water to the stock, supplement the
natural water supply; while paddocks
have been formed, varying in extent
from fifteen to eight thousand acres,
and so arranged that the stock may
be handled with convenience and
despatch. In the stock a marked
improvement has evolved, the present
flock of about 20,000 bearing a
reputation as one of the best of its
size in Queensland. The correctness
of this view is demonstrated in the
price the “Bonnie Downs wool
commands, and in the keen demand
for the flock rams which the owner of
that property has for sale each
season. Of “Wanganella” origin,
the flock has arrived at its present
standard by the most careful selection
of rams, the blood being periodically
renewed by importations from the
best southern studs. While directing
his attention more particularly to
that most important department of
the operations which he controls, Mr.
Livingston has devoted much of his
time to bringing about an equally
desirable standard in the equine
section, the success which has
rewarded his efforts in breeding blood
horses being an all-sufficient tribute
to his excellent judgment of horse-
flesh. The present stallion, “Clyde-
side” (imp.), who deserves to rank
among the highly-pedigreed sires of
the North, is an almost faultless,
upstanding chestnut of perfect con-
formation. lie has had several
successes under silk, both in New
South Wales and Queensland, scoring
notably also in two English events


before being shipped to Australia;
and as a sire is regarded most
favourably by the best judges. He

“Isonomy”) from “Excellenza,” by
“Haut Brion”—“Gulbayez,” by

the No. 27 family. He was preceded
on “Bonnie Downs” by “Chesilton,”
a most successful sire by “Bill of
Portland” (imp.) from “Cooya,”
“Nordenfelt” by “Radiance” —“Fire-

Among the very choice stud-book
mares used at “Bonnie Downs” stand
out “Show Girl” (imp.); “None
Nicer” (dam of "Far Nicer”), by
“Parthenapeaus”; "Collora,” by
“Cooltrim”; “Changeful,” the dam
of “Cash Register,” and “Bonnie
Hatan,” winner of the Tenth Central
Queensland Derby run June 14,
1920; also a winner at Ascot Q.T.C.
meeting. Mr. Livingston has been
highly successful on the turf, winning
laurels with “Eudor Furley” (by
“Eudorus” “Lady Ranfurley”),
and “Far Nicer” (by “Raeburn” —
“None Nicer”), “Bonnie Wasan,”
and “Bonnie ITatan,” all well known
for their performances both in
y 2
Queensland and on the Southern
courses. “Eudor Furley,” as a two-
year-old, won the Nursery Handicap
at Ascot, and the Two-year-old
Handicap on the same course, after-
wards winning the Claret Stakes; and
as a three-year-old won the Valley
Handicap. “Far Nicer,” after
placing several wins to her credit in
Northern Queensland, later entered
in various Southern events, making
good her Northern reputation by
securing several places. “Bilbo,” by
“Prince Carbine”—“Mignonette,”
another horse in Mr. Livingston’s
ownership, was well known as a
winner on the Southern race tracks,
being markedly successful also in the
show ring, securing several champion-
ships and numerous first prizes. As
far back as the year 1890, Mr.
Livingston achieved distinction in
amateur events, winning in South
Australia the Adelaide Hunt Club
Trophy in that year with “Fescue.”
Before and since his advent to
Queensland his name has figured
prominently as a breeder and owner
of winning stock in various districts
where shows have been held, none of
his exhibits being better known than
“Vault” and “Skibo,” the former—
a veritable champion at Brisbane and
other centres where he has competed
—having been described as one of
the best hunters ever bred in
Australia. As a keen sheepman he
has also gained laurels, his exhibits
at the Brewarrina show in New
South Wales in 1906 winning from
all competitors first prizes for best
ram and ewe in the two-year-old
section. The many valuable trophies
to be seen at “Bonnie Downs”
demonstrate more fully than would
be possible in words his knowledge
and efficiency in all matters relating
to stock and the keen and clean
quality of sportsmanship which dis-
tinguishes him. He has been an
active member of the various show
and race committees of the districts
where at different times his inter-
ests have been centred, and in every
way has justified the reputation of
good citizenship which is accorded
him, supporting such movements as
tend to the public good, and further-
ing, as far as in him lies, all causes
which demand the sympathy of a
public-spirited man. He was gazetted
a Justice of the Peace for New
South Wales in the year 1908.
While engaged in the development
of “Bonnie Downs” he experienced
the varying vicissitudes incidental to
life on the land, and his success in
his undertakings is undoubtedly due
to the self-sacrificing and indominat-
able energy with which he carried
on the work, despite the many
obstacles which bestrewed his path
in earlier years. During times of
exceptional stress, as when it was
necessary to cut scrub to keep stock
alive through the length of nearly
three years’ severe drought, he
undertook the most severe physical
labour, mitigating disaster by his
personal efforts in this direction.
He- married in the year 1894 Jessie
Cameron Christina, daughter of the
late Alexander Cameron Mcßean,
formerly a pioneer and identity of
Victoria and South Australia, whose
duties as a contract drover rendered
him well known throughout those
two States, his work, spread over
many years, playing no small part
in the earlier development of the
stock industry. The late gentleman
enjoyed throughout his long life a
well-merited popularity. He was
regarded also as one of the best con-
tract drovers and stock experts of his
time in the South and as a very
capable horseman. The last ten years
of his life were spent in Bourke,
where, on September 9, 1913, in his
seventy-sixth year, he joined the

wide circle of friends and acquaint-
ances to whom his estimable quali-

settlers to arrive in New South
Wales, where he followed the trade
of a carpenter, an avocation in which
he was assisted by his son, the late
Thomas Lewis, grandfather of the
subject of our memoir. Some of
the buildings erected by these two
pioneers still form historic landmarks
in the Narrabri district of the
Mother State, which is now well
peopled by hundreds of their
descendants. Mr. Charles Lewis’
father, who also bore the Christian
name of Thomas, was born at Mus-
wellbrook, New South Wales. He
subsequently became engaged in tin
mining in the New England district,
and built the first hotel at Vegetable
Creek, now known as Emmaville,
near Glen Innes. In the year 1873
he came to Queensland, having
obtained a position as head stockman
on “Warr-Warr” Station, in the
Darling Downs district, a property
which he subsequently managed for
the late P. J. Clynes. He later
undertook the administration of
“Tallwood” Station, in Southern
Queensland, on behalf of the same
owner, and still later managed
“Wallen,” an estate situated near
the New South Wales border, for the
well-known firm of J, & W. Low,
originally of “Welltown.” In the
year 1880 he came with his family
to “Oakwood” Station, a property
situated on the Ward River, which
he administered for the following
two years. At the termination of
this period he joined forces with the
late Walter Perrier and Mr. John
W. Dowling in the foundation of a
stock, station, and general agency
business at Alpha, and later at
Jericho, where the partnership was
subsequently dissolved by mutual
consent, the late Mr. Lewis taking
up “Rumleigh” Station, near
Tambo, where he carried on pastoral
pursuits for several years. For some
time previous to his death, which
occurred in the year 1899, he was
living in retirement at Tambo. He
was one of the first residents of the
district to receive the Commission of
the Peace, and was for many years
a member of the Tambo Shire
Council, His eldest son, Mr. Charles
Lewis, was educated in the Mother
State, leaving school before reaching
his teens in order to assist his father,
with whom he worked until the time
of his marriage, which occurred when
he was 24 years of age. After this
event he was employed by the Scot-
tish Australian Investment Co., Ltd.
He later fulfilled droving contracts
for Messrs. Gilchrist, Watt, & Co.,
Mr. Edward White, “Martindale,”
and others. In 1897 he embarked
on a grazing venture, taking up a
block of land situated about 40
miles north of Tambo, and has ever
since carried on sheep-farming there.

The Late JOHN KIRBY, one of
Australia’s pioneer agriculturists,
was a native of County Cork, Ire-
land. He was brought to Victoria
by his father, and is the descendant

of a family which from generation
to generation followed agrarian pur-
suits in the Emerald Isle. The elder
Kirby’s connection with the land of
the Southern Cross was not of long
duration, his death occurring a few
years after the arrival of the family
in the Garden State, and his son
MR. J. F. S. KIRBY.
John had early to assume the re-
sponsibilities of a bread-winner.
During his early boyhood he was
engaged in the carrying industry to
and from the gold-diggings, being
entrusted with the charge of bullock
teams, and undertaking onerous
duties for one of such tender years in
connection with this enterprise.
While still a youth he selected a

farm at Lancefield, and after spend-
ing a few years in the development
of this holding, disposed of it as an
improved property, and established
himself in a new home in the Goul-
burn Valley district of Victoria.
Here he remained for a brief period,
when, with his brother, Mr. Francis

New South Wales—another well-
known personality of an earlier
period in the Mother State—he
started out on a prospecting trip,
with a view to land settlement in

the western districts. During this
journey they traversed many miles
of country, penetrating to the
Bulloo River, in the far south-west
of Queensland; but although they
struck a good season, and the local-
ities through which they passed
must have impressed them very
favourably, for some reason not re-
corded they did not take up any of
this land, which since has proved
itself cattle country of considerable
merit. Finally Mr. John Kirby
returned to the Albury district of
New South Wales, where he took up
an area of agricultural land, and
settled down to farming occupations,
In the year 1890 he sold this pro-
perty, and with his family removed
to Collarenebri district, in the vicin-
ity of Walgett, where several hold-
ings were selected by the various
members of his now grown-up
family, and a new home founded.
Here, at ‘‘Buddah Grove”—a name

JOHN FRANCIS STEPHEN
KIRBY, “Miltonise,” Bollon Road,
St. George, is the second son of the
late John Kirby, and was born near
Germanton (now Holbrook), New
South Wales, on July 6, 1869. He
received his primary education in his
native place, completing his scholastic

studies at St. Joseph’s College,
Hunter Hill, Sydney, under the
tuition of the Marist Brothers.
Leaving college at the age of 15, he
became"" associated with his father in
farming pursuits, and accompanying
the rest of the family to Collaren-
ebri in 1890, he continued with
them in the working of several hold-
ings which were acquired in that
district by the various members of
the family circle. In 1894 he joined
his elder brother, Mr. Patrick L.
Kirby (now of “Belara,” near
Pokataroo, New South Wales), in
partnership, and the two commenced
operations on their own account.
About this time the subject of irri-
gation first began to be generally
discussed, and experiments made in
that part of the Mother State, and
the Kirby brothers promptly became
convinced of the great possibilities
which' would be opened up for
pastoral extension by the adoption of
an easily workable system in this
direction of development work. As
a result of their progressive methods
the first wheat ever produced in the
Collarenebri district was grown on
the Messrs. Kirby Brothers’ estate,
where, also, they established a

of enterprise in which they succeeded
in creating something of a sensation

brothers continued their connec-
tion until 1908, when by mutual
consent they dissolved partnership,
each being desirous of following the
bent of his ideas along his own indi-
vidual lines. The elder, content with


the attainments and garnered know-
ledge of a long stretch of useful
years, elected to continue on the
lines already followed successfully in
the past. The younger man, on the

other hand, experienced the stirrings
of ambition, leading him to desire
wider scope for his enterprise. The
opportunities afforded by the big,
unoccupied territory in Queensland
were frequently brought before him
by another brother (Mr. J. S.
Kirby), of “Cashmere West,” near
St. George, and eventually, after
leasing a portion of “Cashmere
West,” carrying 10,000 sheep, for
a period of two years, the results
proved so convincing that the
subject of our memoir decided to
throw in his lot with the community
of which his brother formed a unit.
Taking up the block of land now
known as “Miltonise,” which he has
since developed with such marked
success, he set to work to harness the
forces of Nature to his own ends.
Previously the holding had been in
temporary occupation for pastoral
uses, but kangaroos, emus, and
dingoes were in full possession - when
Mr. Kirby made his advent to the
place, and commenced operations in
good earnest in 1912. During the
five years which have elapsed since
he took over control, great changes
have been wrought in the property,
lie amount of work accomplished
being almost phenomenal, and only
to be accounted for by the energy,
industry, and confidence in the
future of the country displayed by
the proprietor of the “Miltonise”
acres. No fencing had been done
prior to Mr. Kirby’s arrival, and
his first act was to enclose the pro-
perty with a good, strong boundary
fence, made proof against dingoes
and marsupials with wire netting.
The cost of this fence was over £92
per mile, a portion of which outlay
was borne by the Government—the
high figure being the result of the
distance of the run from a railway,
which made freight expensive, while
for labour alone £35 per mile had
to be expended. The 80 miles ol
boundary fencing having been com-
pleted, subdivision work was under-
taken, 18 paddocks of varying size
being formed, the fences having six
wires to render them sheep-proof,
The chief difficulty which had to be
contended with was that of obtain-
ing an adequate water supply, the
lack of this element, so important
to a successful pastoral proposition,
having been the chief reason for the
land lying idle so long. The Govern-
ment of the day, however, perceiv-
ing that some steps must be taken
to ensure the occupation of the land,

previously had stepped in, and at
the time of Mr. Kirby’s arrival this
obstacle already was being sur-
mounted by the sinking of two
artesian bores, which, & although


outside the actual boundary of “Mil-
tonise,” provide an ample flow of
water for stock and irrigation pur-
poses. Even larger numbers of sheep
and cattle than those at present de-
pastured on this and neighbouring
properties could easily be supplied
by the liberal streams which pro-
ceed from these sources and find
their way through artificial channels
over the country. The ever full
drains which run through “Milton-
ise” alone are over 38 miles in
length, and in connection with this
system of water supply it may be
mentioned that the “bore drain
delver” used in the work of drain-
making on the property was de-
signed by Mr. J. F. S. Kirby. This
delver since has come into general
use where large systems of bore
drains have been found necessary,
and has been universally adopted for
all public works of the kind by the
Government of New South Wales.
To Mr. Kirby’s credit, therefore,
must be placed not only the pioneer-
ing of a new pastoral station in
Southern Queensland, but also
original work of a most valuable
practical kind in the sphere of in-
vention, the prompt appreciation of
which by his fellow-pastoralists and
others has given a fillip to the occu-
pation of country which long had
remained unoccupied on account of
the cost and trouble of providing for
the watering of the stock, or the
irrigation of cultivation fields. The
bore drains and artificial tanks fed
from the bores constitute the entire

water supply of “Miltonise,” and
when developed the land makes ex-
cellent sheep country, large flocks
being depastured in this locality.
The country over which the
“Miltonise” holding stretches is
principally flat in character, with
soil varying from black to red,
and interspersed with sandy loam,
favourable to the production of
several varieties of good natural
grasses. The timbers which clothe
the flats and rising country are box,
pine, belar, coolibah, brigalow, and
currajong, and in addition to these
there are to be found a number of
species of edible scrub, which in
droughty seasons forms very accept-
able fodder for stock. A consider-
able amount of ringbarking has
already been accomplished by Mr.
Kirby, and this work is being pushed
forward with all available despatch.
The “Miltonise” dwellinghouse calls
for special mention, much thought
and care having been given to the
details of its design, with the idea
of achieving the desire of a “home-
stead” in the best sense of the word,
comfort and convenience being made
of paramount importance in the
arrangement of the interior. It is
quickly evident that the climatic
conditions prevailing in the south-
western districts of Queensland have
been taken into careful considera-
tion, and have had much to do with
the carrying out of a plan which has
proved highly suitable to the pur-
pose for which it was designed.
Although under one roof, the home
is built in two distinct portions, one
of which contains the apartments for
general and common use, such as the
dining-room, kitchen, and other
offices, all of which are on the
ground floor. Attached to this is a
two-storey building, comprising the
bedrooms and drawing-room, with a
balcony encircling the whole; while
the semi-detachment—a lofty room,
the ceiling and partitions of which
have been effectively decorated—-is
utilized for general purposes by the
members of the household. It may
be said that the whole architectural
plan, which was designed by Mr.
Kirby himself, suggests the abode of
the man who is in love with the
locality which he has chosen as the
scene of his life’s enterprise, and
who when building a home was de-
termined to make it in every respect
the most desirable of abiding-places.
The house is lighted throughout by
air-gas, a modern plant having been
installed for the production of
this illuminant. Although building
operations only ceased in 1914, the
surroundings already have begun to
take on the aspect of well-laid-out
grounds, several garden beds having
been made and shade trees planted
in suitable places. Another attrac-
tion is a large swimming tank, distant

about 100 yards from the house,
where the luxury of a cool dip may
be indulged in at any time during
the year. “Miltonise” is connected
by telephone with St. George, from
which centre it lies distant some
28 miles, being approached by the
St. George-Bollon main road. Mr.
Kirby interests himself in the public
life of the district, being a member
of the Balonne Shire Council, and
he co-operates in a cordial manner
in all local movements set afoot
in the cause of humanity and pro-
gress. He married in 1899 Lilian
Elizabeth, widow of the late William
Hylands, of Sydney, by whom she
had one son, William Leslie Hylands.
Mrs. Kirby is a daughter of the late
James O’Reilly, a native of County

Kirby. He received his education
at the College of the Patrician
Brothers, Albury, and at 16 years
of age left his scholastic life behind
him, taking up duties on his father’s
farm, where he became thoroughly
proficient in everything relating to
the agrarian industry. He continued
in this connection until the farm
was sold, when he accompanied the
other members of the family to the
Walgett district, and was associated
with them in the selection of grazing
country, in the administration of
which he was actively concerned
until 1907. A division of the land
having taken place, Mr. Kirby dis-
posed of his portion, and made his
advent to Queensland, with the in-
tention of acquiring a property upon
which to inaugurate pastoral

operations on a more important scale.
At that time many of the large areas
of the Maranoa River district of
South-western Queensland had been
abandoned by the leaseholders on
account of the ravages caused by the
great drought of 1902-3, and the
Government of the day offering
terms of an advantageous nature to
those willing to enter upon the occu-
pation of these tracts of country,
Mr. Kirby decided to avail himself
of this exceptional opportunity to
secure the territory necessary for his
purpose. After making an inspec-
tion of much of the land lying idle,
His choice fell upon the pastoral
lease of “Cashmere West,” an area
of some 184 square miles which orig-
inally comprised a large portion of
the historic old “Cashmere” station,
and here he settled down in
good earnest to the develop-
ment of a pastoral proposition of
some magnitude. The country was

promising in appearance, embracing
within its boundaries a great deal
of forest land, with wide belts of
mulga, heavily grassed with a
variety of native grasses of great
nutritious value for stock. Prior to
its occupation and improvement by
the present owner it was practically
waterless, the few miles of river
frontage which it owned contribut-
ing only in a very limited degree
to the value of the place in this
important respect. Mr. Kirby, how-
ever, who started out on his task
with the intention of making a
thorough success of the proposition,
undeterred by obstacles or difficul-
ties, proved himself equal to the
situation. He first set to work to
improve the neglected and dilapi-
dated boundary fence which was
rendered rabbit- and marsupial-
proof by the addition of wirenetting
and mesh, and to erect many miles
of new fencing, dividing the whole
property into some 20 paddocks of
varying size, the subdivision being
fenced with five wires. Next, hav-
ing rendered his neighbours, Messrs.
13. & W. Gunn, some service by
selecting a site and taking the levels
for the sinking of a bore on
their property, “Weeallah,” which
adjoined “Cashmere West,” he
arranged with them to obtain water
from this source, and forthwith
stocked his paddocks with 15,000


sheep, 12,000 of which he procured
from the famous “Wellshot” merino
flock. At a later date he directed his
attention to securing a permanent

and adequate water supply upon his
own property, and was fortunate in
locating a site some 14 miles from
the homestead, where the present
bore was sunk, which now waters
have been constructed on the run,
and in this way the problem which
confronts every stockowner on those
portions of the country which are
liable to periodical visitations of
drought has been very satisfac-
torily solved by the proprietor of

South Wales, having been born near

MR. WILLIAM HENRY JOSEPH KIRBY.
February 23, 1877. He is the fourth
son of the late John Kirby, and re-
ceived his education primarily in the
place of his birth, afterwards attend-
ing a State school in the Golden
Valley district of Victoria, where he

acquired by them in that district.
Here he remained until verging on
the completion of his twenty-first
year, when he joined his brother,
Mr. James S. Kirby, in partnership,
the two starting operations on their
own account on a property in the
vicinity of the parental estate, of
which, indeed, it previously had
formed a portion. The more serious
responsibilities which now had to be
shouldered by the young man proved
of considerable benefit to him, and
the experience gained in the connec-
tion referred to, together with the
advantage of being born and bred
to the calling upon which he was
now embarked in earnest, gave him
an excellent equipment for more ex-
tended enterprise of an independent
character. Upon the marriage of
the elder brother in 1904 a dissolu-
tion of partnership was agreed upon,
and the property was divided.
Thenceforward the gentleman under
review administered his own inter-
ests on independent lines, and in
1912, while still conducting the New
South Wales property, taking into
consideration the possibility of more
rapid advancement on an enlarged
area, he decided to make the experi-
ment of venturing across the Queens-
land border, there to inaugurate
operations on more extensive lines.
Accordingly he took up his present

inspired him with the utmost con-
fidence that under normal conditions
excellent returns would repay the
pastoralist who should throw in his
lot in this district, and he after-
wards displayed this confidence in
the most practical manner upon his
return to Queensland by acquiring
his present property, which lies with-

his possession. In its natural state
the country was abundantly clothed
with belar, box, sandalwood, pine,
coolibah, and mulga timbers, in
addition to a good deal of edible
scrub. Close on 20,000 acres of
the thickly-timbered area, however,
have been brought under the ring-
barkers’ axes, considerably altering
the general appearance of the
country. This work has been carried
out under the most difficult of condi-
tions, as the greater proportion of
it was accomplished whilst the
(1913-14) drought conditions pre-
vailed, making it necessary to cart
water for the use of the men the
whole of the time that the work was
in progress, thus reviving the real

primitive times. Natural grasses
flourish in season, and the winter herb-
age so invaluable for stock purposes is
also found in abundance. When the
property was first taken up from the
Crown by Mr. Kirby it was prac-
tically in an undeveloped state, the
only sign of improvement being that
the surrounding settlers had en-
closed their own property, in this
way providing a boundary fence for
the future “Bullindgie.’’ Mr.
Kirby at the outset was confronted
with the pastoralist’s greatest diffi-
culty—want of water—a poorly-
supplied tank, which stood on that
part of the grazing farm which
formerly had been embraced in the
old “Cubbie” Station, and had been
resumed by the Government of the
day, providing the only water
apart from the supply provided by
the bore, and as such add very con-
siderably to the value of the run.
Sinking for artesian water was com-
menced in the early part of 1915,
and the stream was struck at 3,057
feet, as a result of which the “Bul-
lindgie” area has benefited by a
copious flow of over a million gallons
daily. The usual bore drains have
been excavated, by means of which
the water is carried to different parts
of the run, more than 20 miles of
these channels already having been
completed. When the whole of the
proposed system is complete it is
estimated that there will be over 80
miles of these drains on “Bullind-
gie,” forming a very efficient water
supply, both for stock and irriga-
tion purposes. Although Mr. Kirby
Kirby first came to the district in
1915 he erected a homestead on very
substantial lines, though with no
intention of using it as a residence
for more than a brief period. De-
spite the fact that the structure was
designed for temporary habitation
only, considerable care was taken in
its planning, and in every respect it
fulfils its purpose admirably, incon-
veniences which could be endured in
view of the fact that at no very
distant date it is expected to be
superseded by a building of a
superior type, being practically non-
existent. The permanent home of
the future was planned for at an
earlier date, but the prevailing
drought and war conditions making
the necessary materials practically
unprocurable, the erection has been
obtainable on the whole of the pro-
perty. His first efforts, therefore,
were directed to the overcoming of
this drawback, and accordingly ex-
cavations for five tanks were made
on different parts of the property at
an average cost of £2OO, the main
object of their construction being
the supply of water to the stock
until such time as a bore, which had
been arranged for in Mr. Kirby’s
calculations at the time that he took
over the property, could be sunk.
Unfortunately, however, before he
had attained a fair start the drought
of 1913 descended over the country,
and the tanks for the time being
were rendered useless, but they have
since justified their construction by
proving of considerable use as reser-
voirs of surface water, altogether

regards his property as being still in
the pioneer stages of development, a
large amount of improvement work
already stands to his credit. About
75,000 acres, divided into two pad-
docks, have been securely netted
against the inroads of marsupials,
and the remainder of the fences are
provided with rabbit-proof netting.
The whole of the property is sub-
divided into nine paddocks, and a
further subdivision is now in course
of progress, Mr. Kirby intending to
confine his attention solely to the
raising of sheep. In this connection
it may be stated that the fine flock
of merinoes to be seen browsing on
the pastures of “Bullindgie” has
been built up with good flock ewes

time. The site upon which the home-
stead stands is 30 miles north-west
of Dirranbandi, the nearest point of
railway connection, and lies about
half-way between that centre and
the small township of Bollon. Mr.
Kirby has always manifested a live
concern in the general affairs of any
community with which for the time he
has formed a part. At Collarenebri
he was prominent in many charitable
movements and organizations, and
as a committeeman of the local hos-
pital he did useful work for a
lengthy period. He was honorary
secretary of the committee of man-
agement of the affairs of the Roman
Catholic Church in that neighbour-
hood for many years, and it was
largely through his efforts that the


new edifice which was erected in
1906 was secured to the communion
to which for generations his family
has been devoted. At the present
time he is a member of the Balonne

tance of 80 miles for the purpose of
attending the periodical meetings of
the council, which are held at St.

trouble to which he is prepared to
go in the discharge of his public
duties. Mr. Kirby married in 1908
Edith Mary, daughter of the late
Thomas Carmody, who, himself a
native of Bathurst, New South
Wales, was the son of an early
pioneer hailing from Ireland, who
settled in the Mother State, which
then was only in its infancy. Mrs.
Kirby’s father was associated with
the pastoral industry during the
whole of his life, and for many years
had full charge of the stock on the
old, historic cattle stations “Bun-
arba” and “Curragundi,” in the
Moree district. Of this union there
are two sons and two daughters
surviving.

The firm of WALL & BROMLEY
was established in the year 1919 on
the acquirement of “Kileen,” the
partners in this venture having been
associates since childhood. THOMAS
WILLIAM ALEXANDER WALL
was born at Warrnambool, Victoria,
on October 28, 1886, and is a son of
Mr. John Henry Wall, who at the
time of his son’s birth engaged as a
station manager in the pastoral
industry in the Garden Strte, sub-
sequently coming to Queensland,
where he has been well known for
over 20 years, being occupied at
time of writing as a manager and
owner in the central district of the
State. The Wall family was estab-
lised in Australia in the fifties, its
founder, the grandfather of Mr. T.
W. A. Wall, having been a pioneer
of the mining industry in Victoria in
the stirring days of the early gold
discoveries, though shortly alter his
arrival he settled down to pastoral
pursuits, becoming the owner of
“Shipley” and other well-known
Victorian properties. Mr. Wall, of
“Kileen,” was chiefly educated by
private tuition, becoming engaged
in the grazing industry in Queens-
land in a responsible capacity at an
early age and continuing his activi-
ties during different periods of his
subsequent career as manager of
“Glendower,” “Evora,” and
“Casurina” Stations, conducting

also on his own account a property
known as “Ivy Leaf,” in the Aramac
district, which, after carrying on for
five years, he sold to Mr. Allen,
of “Nalemba.” On joining Mr.
Bromley in the purchase of “Kileen”
he entered with that gentleman upon
the administration of the property
and of leased land in its vicinity
acquired as pasture for extra stock,
both areas being devoted to the wool
and mutton industry. Mr. Wall is
a strong supporter of clean sport and
a successful amateur racing man,
being the possessor of various cups
and trophies won at different north-
ern meetings A gifted rider, he has
been the mount on nearly every
occasion that his horses have sped to
victory. He married in April, 1914,
Eileen, daughter of Mr. George B.
Gallogly, of “Bowen Downs,” who
has been associated with the growth
and progress of the Muttaburra
district for a period extending over
nearly half a century. Of the union
there is a family of two sons, Alex-
ander and Lionel. BRIAN BROM-
LEY is a native of Rockhampton,
Queensland, the date of his birth
being October 10, 1889. He is the
eldest son of Mr. Charles Mackay
Bromley, who until comparatively
recent years was one of the most
influential citizens of Rockhampton,
where he was established in a stock
and station agency business run
under the title of John Macfarlane
and Co., and which he conducted
for well over a quarter of a century,
being closely associated with most of
the old pastoral pioneers of Queens-
land during that time. Mr. Bromley,
sen., is a descendant of an old Eng-
lish family of Yorkshire origin, a
former head of which was his
brother, the late Sir John Bromley,
C. 8., whose seat was at Sutton
Corner, Kent. He was the only
member of the family to settle in
Australia, and came to Rockhampton
from the Darling Downs, his sound
business methods drawing many
clients for advice to the office of
John Macfarlane & Co., and being
sorely missed on his retirement from
active pursuits. Mr. C. M. Bromley,
who now resides in Sydney, has a
family of three sons. Educated
primarily at the Rockhampton
Grammar School, and finishing his
collegiate course at a similar institu-
tion at Armidale, New South Wales,
Mr. Brian Bromley was engaged in
his father’s business until the out-
break of hostilities between Britain
and Germany in 1914, when he was
at the age of twenty-four. He
immediately offered his services,
being amongst the Australians who
first joined the colours, leaving for
the front with the first contingent.
Remaining abroad for the duration
of the war he served in Egypt,
Gallipoli, France, and Belgium,
being wounded on the Peninsula and
in France (in all four times), and
gaining his commission on the field.

On the signing of the Armistice lie
returned to Australia, and shortly
afterwards purchased “Kileen” in
conjunction with Mr. Wall, as

he, like his partner, shows by his
active support a keen predilection for
the sport of kings.
F. H. BIDDULPH, “Birtley,”
Springsure, who administers this
property on behalf of his mother,
Mrs. Harriette S. Biddulph, is
descended from a distinguished
ancestry on both sides of his family,
the members of which achieved
prominence by the important part
which they played in the history-
making of both the old and the new
world. His paternal progenitors
landed in England with William the
Conqueror in the tenth century,
when, according to the usage adopted
by the Normans, they assumed the
name of their place of residence—
Biddulph. This line is unbroken
down to the present generation,
which is connected with many of the
first rank in the Mother Country. The

three times for that monarch. The
property was eventually restored to
the family. The grandfather of the
gentleman under review, Captain
Edward Biddulph, R.N., was edu-
cated at Rugby, and entered the
British Navy as a first-class volun-
teer in the year 1803. He served on
many vessels, and in 1807 was
aboard the “Fenhouse,” from which
vessel he was appointed master-mate
on the “Ville de Paris” when the
latter ship bore the flags of Lord
Gardiner and Lord Gambier. He
was present in the “Caredonia” at
the destruction of the French squad-
ron in the Basque Roads in the year
1809, and was awarded a medal for
his services during this battle. He
was also present at the investment
of Flushings. In 1810 he was
appointed to the “Onyx,” and took
part in the defence of Cadiz, and
was distinguished as the recipient of
several other medals. Ten years
later he assisted in the landing of
emigrants at Algoa Bay and in
suppressing the slave trade. In 1831
he left England for Australia in the
“Sophia Jane” (called after his two
sisters), there being 13 souls on
board —-his wife, his son Walter, his
daughter, and the crew. They called
at the Cape en route, and spent a
fortnight as the guest of Mrs. Bid-
dulph’s brother, the Hon. John
Chase, who was Acting-Governor for
z 2
that colony. Their appearance at
Port Jackson, Sydney, created a
great sensation, the steam from the
vessel terrifying the blacks, who
regarded their presence as a, visita-
tion of the powers of evil. Subse-
quently Captain Biddulph retired
from the Navy on half-pay and
obtained a grant of land known as
“Elmhurst,”situated near Maitland,
New South Wales, but on the out-
break of the Crimean War he was
recalled to the colours and raised to
the rank of Commander. The indif-
ferent state of his health, however,
prevented him from taking any part
in that historical struggle. He died
at “Elmhurst” in 1851, leaving two
sons, the elder being the late Walter
MR. F. H. BIDDULPH.
John Biddulph, former owner of
“Mount Playfair” and “Birtley,”
and the younger, Francis Henry, a
retired wine and spirit merchant
living at Brighton, England. One
of the late Captain Biddulph’s
brothers married a sister of Major-
General Shrapnel, the inventor of
the Shrapnel bullet. Captain Bid-
dulph served his native land with
honour, and endeavoured with con-
siderable success to advance the
interests of his adopted country. He
and his wife were buried at New-
castle, New South Wales. His eldest
son, Walter John Biddulph, was
brought to Australia by his father
when he was but four years of age.
He received his education at several
schools, finishing his studies at the
Normal and the King’s School, Par-
ramatta. On reaching man’s estate
he took up farming and cattle-
buying, and coming to Queensland
in 1861 assumed the management of
“Boxvale” Station on the Dawson
River, which he stocked with
sheep for Mr. Gordon Sandeman.
He managed the station for a few
years, and in 1870 held a similar
position on “AVindah,” a property
on the Fitzroy River; and later still
took sheep to “Silsoe” and formed
that station for Mr. Williams. He
afterwards took up “Mount Play-
fair” and stocked it with Here-
ford cattle; and here he resided
with his family for 27 years.
At the end of this period he
purchased “Birtley,” where with
his family he spent the remaining
two years of his life, his death taking
place in 1905 in the 78th year of his
age. He was married on “Moravia
Downs” by the Rev. Mr. Dunning
on June 13, 1865, to Miss Foot,
daughter of the late Mr. Theophilus
Foot, who was the fourteenth son
of the late Lieut-Colonel James Foot,
Banville Bambridge, County Down,
Ireland. Mr. Foot’s mother was a
daughter of Count John D’Oleir, a
French refugee. His wife, Ellen,
was the daughter of the late Mr.
Nesbett, a lawyer living on the
sunny side of Stephen Green; and
one of her ancestors, Bishop Lloyd,
was amongst the six bishops who
were sent to the Tower to be
executed in the reign of Charles 11.,
MR. THEO. FOOT.
and were afterwards exonerated by
that monarch. Mr. Foot was a
Trinity College (Dublin) man, and
was educated first as a clergyman
and later as a surgeon. He and his


young wife arrived at Sydney in the
“Amelia Thomson” in the year 1837,
and eventually settled in the Hunter
District, where his family of five
sons and five daughters were born.
He owned “Piedmont” Station,
besides holding interests in other
properties. In 1862 with his wife
and family he journeyed overland
to Queensland, where he acquired
the property known as “Moravia
Downs,” in the Leichhardt District.
Later he bought "Warrinilla,”
near Rolleston, and settled there,
subsequently with his three sons
purchasing "Mount Leonard,” the
firm being styled T. Foot & Sons.
His two younger sons acquired
“Cungelela,” and after an interval,
“Riverside” and “Malcombie,” and
also held interests in other pro-
perties. Mr. and Mrs Foot died and
were buried at “Warrinilla,” aged
respectively 80 and 94 years, the
wife surviving her husband. The
late Walter Biddulph died at “Birt-
ley” in 1905, being then in his
78th year. This fine example of one
of our country’s pioneers has left a
family of one son and five daughters.
Four of the latter are married and
have families, and the youngest lives
with her widowed mother at "Birt-
ley.” His son, Francis Henry, has
undertaken the administration of that
estate, leaving his
Mr. Henry Bredhauer, in charge at
“Mount Playfair,” this property
having been settled on Mr. F. H.
Biddulph and Mr. Bredhauer by the
late Mr. Biddulph prior to his
death. Mr. Francis Henry Biddulph
married in 1907 Janet, second
daughter of the late Captain Walter
Hannah, Brisbane, the issue of
the union being two sons and a
daughter.
HARRY EDWARD McNEILE,
J.P., “Cowley,” Charleville, was
born at Dublin on December 9, 1870.
He is the only son of Mr. Alexander
John McNeile, a landed proprietor
living at Dollanstown, County of
Meath, Ireland, in the northern part
of which country this family of
landed gentry have been established
for many generations. The origin
of the family is lost in obscurity,
though for centuries past existing
records testify to the part they
played in the making of history in
that part of Ireland. The subject of
our memoir is an Etonian ; and on
the completion of his education at
that famous seat of learning in
Buckingham, England, he satisfied
the inherent craving for adventure
and the desire to see something of
the world, which forms so large a
part in the nature of a high-spirited
youth, by taking passage to Australia

in 1888 when approaching the
attainment of his eighteenth year.
Before his departure from the
Emerald Isle it was arranged that
he should fill the post of jackaroo on
“Cowley” (then in the hands of Mr.
A. H. McDonald), and in due course
he commenced his initiation into the
various phases of a pastoral proposi-
tion. At the end of two years,
having in the meantime carried out
his duties in the above-mentioned
capacity on the property of which,
later, he was to become part owner,
he returned to Ireland and spent
about a year in his father’s home, at
the termination of which period he
returned to his post at “Cowley.”
In the following year the station was
purchased from Mr. A. H. McDonald
(since deceased) by Mr. A. J.
McNeile, and Mr. H. E. McNeile
immediately assumed the manage-
ment on behalf of his father, then
resident in Ireland. Subsequently
Mr. H. E. McNeile secured an
interest in the property, and later
became a partner, and has since
continued to control operations, ex-
cepting during his absence on visits
to Ireland and other centres in
the years 1896, 1901, and 1911.
“Cowley” derives its name from a
creek which runs through the estate
between the Faroe and Bulloo Rivers,
and is situated about 100 miles from
Charieville on the Great Western
line. The homestead, built in 1887,
lies about 30 miles from Cheepie,
which is the nearest railway station.
The walls are constructed of pise,
the rooms being well ventilated, while
wide verandahs provide welcome
shade during the summer months.
The portion of the creek which runs
in close proximity to the building,
the view of the neighbouring dam,
the pretty garden enclosing the
house, and the well-planted orchard,
all render this homestead a refresh-
ing sight to the eye of the weary
traveller as he approaches its hospit-
able walls. The property comprises
some 160,000 acres, principally tim-
bered with the useful mulga, and
well clothed in parts with Mitchell,
blue, and many other varieties of
native grass and herbage. The carry-
ing capacity of the run in ordinary
seasons is about 20,000 head of
sheep, the water supply being prin-
cipally derived from tanks and ex-
cavated dams. At the time the
MR. H. E. McNEILE.
property was purchased by Mr. A.
J. McNeile, it was devoted only to
the breeding of cattle and horses,
but in 1897 a decision was arrived
at to devote the area exclusively to
the raising of sheep. Throughout
the whole thirty-three years of his
association with “Cowley” as man-
ager and owner he has played the
part of an energetic and useful
citizen of the State. In that time
he has successfully weathered the
many vicissitudes of station life.

success with his blood stock at these

to the fore, and he has had the dis-
tinction of being the winner of no
less than twenty-five races within the
past five years. Almost since the
decade he has been particularly
prominent in local sporting affairs,
and the success, of the Charleville
picnic race meetings has been due,
in no small measure, to the energy
which he has expended in promoting
the interests of the Charleville

JOHN ARMSTRONG, J.P.,
“Raceview,” Charleville, was born
on December 23, 1856, at a place
known as the Seven-mile Creek,
situated that distance from Ipswich.
His father, the late John Armstrong,
MR. JOHN ARMSTRONG, SEN.
was twice married, and the
gentleman under review is the only
son of the first union, his mother
being Elizabeth, daughter of the
late John Clarke, a member of an

old farming family in the North of
Ireland. There are surviving of the
issue of the second marriage, which
occurred some time after the death
of his first wife, a family of four
sons. Of these, two are officers in
the Department of Education and
two have adopted the profession of
their forbears by centreing their
interests on the land. The late John
Armstrong was a native of Belfast,
Ireland, and arrived in Queensland
with his wife and two children (one
of whom was born at sea) in the
early forties, when this State still
formed a part of New South Wales,
and was yet known merely by the
appellation of the Moreton Bay Dis-
trict. His first employment was that
of storekeeper on “Eskdale” Sta-
tion, then controlled by the Scott
family, and subsequently he worked
in a similar capacity on the historical
“Cressbrook” Station, where he took
his part in the general routine of
station work, gaining useful experi-
ence and a general knowledge of the
conditions of life prevailing in
Queensland at that time under the
most favourable circumstances.
Eventually he purchased some 80
acres of land at the Seven-mile
Creek, close to Ipswich, and became
a freeholder in the days when the
Mother State still ruled the destinies
of Moreton Bay, and later purchased
other properties until, at the time
of his decease, he owned about 500
acres. He carried on farming pur-
suits at this place until his death,
the dairying industry having chiefly
engaged his attention, and it is
worthy of note that the farm is still
carried on by a connection of the
family in the person of Mr. Thomas
Armstrong (a step-brother of the
subject of our memoir), who now
administers its acres and still
specializes in the industry inaug-
urated by his late father. This is
possibly one of the oldest dairy farms
in Queensland, and it may be safely
averred that it is one of the very
few properties to remain in the
possession of any one family in the
Northern State for such a lengthy
space of time. It was on this farm
that Mr. John Armstrong was born,
and it was here, also, that the fine
old pioneer crossed the “Great
Divide” in the year 1895. The late
John Armstrong left behind him a
record of honesty, industry, and
those other traits which were so
forcibly personified in the brave
sturdy settlers of the early days,
who were indeed the true founders
of the country. The life of such a
man must prove an incentive, not
only to his own immediate descend-
ants, but to every young man fired
with ambition and the endeavour to
succeed in the business of life. That
these traits were indelibly stamped,
both by force of example and in-
heritance, on the mind of his eldest
son is apparent in the exceptionally
and deservedly successful career of

that gentleman. The subject of our
review received such education as it

people at different private schools

and in his own home, and it was
necessarily somewhat irregular. His
education in farming and all matters

the farm. At the age of 15 all book
learning was of necessity abandoned
and his whole time devoted to the
roof, his sole possessions being his
horse, saddle and swag, assets to the
value of about £lO sterling. His
first independent work was droving,
when he made one of a party com-
missioned to take a mob of cattle
from “Rosewood” to “Burrindilla”
Station, on the Langlo River. Owing
to the dry conditions of that par-
ticular season, this trip occupied a
period of 16 weeks. This droving
trip was the first of many similar
experiences, in which he gained valu-
able knowledge of the country
through which he passed and the
stock with which he had to deal,
and this, added to the quota gained
in maturer years, renders him one
of the most highly-informed men of
the country concerning pastoral
matters. After the safe delivery of
the cattle at “Burrindilla,” young
Armstrong accepted a post on that
station as stockman, engaging in
addition to “break in” the station
horses. He remained in this position
for three years, after which he
returned to his first occupation of
droving, on these occasions being
employed by the Moore family, who
at that time owned “Moorlands,”
“Burrindilla,” and other pastoral
appellation of the Moores of “Cohn-
ton.” A member of the family yet

half a share in “Mentone” in the
year 1880, his partner being Mr. C.
H. Gibbs, a maternal relative of his
late employers. He managed this
proposition in their joint interests
“LYNDHURST DUKE OF DERRIMUT 3RD.”
during the following four years,
when by mutual consent the partner-
ship was dissolved. Taking his
share of the proceeds Mr. Arm-
strong journeyed to the property now
known as “Waverley,” but which at
that time was commonly called the
“J. C.,” owing to the fact that one
of the explorers, the late John
Costello, had carved the initials on
a tree which grew in such a position
on the run as to be a prominent
mark to commemorate the formation
of the first settlement there. He
acted in the capacity of manager for
his late partner, Mr. C. H. Gibbs,
on this estate until July, 1885, after
which he returned to the coast, and
coming to Brisbane remained there
for a time to test the pleasures and
opportunities afforded by the city.
The fetters of town life soon grew
irksome, however, and the offer of a
butchering business in Charleville
induced him to respond to the call
of the open spaces and the wider
freedom which were essentially his
birthright, and after a few months’
sojourn in the city he once more
turned his face westwards. At the
end of the same year we find him
conducting this butchering business
in the principal town of the far west,
and though he has launched out in
many other directions, and for the
past 20 years has had but little time
to devote to the details of this par-
ticular department of his numerous
interests, he is still wholly identified
with it, though he has practically
committed the management of it to
his nephew, Mr. R. T. Savage. In
the course of events, and being
encouraged by the success of his last
venture, his mind began to dwell on
fresh fields of activity. His inclin-
ation led him to make an essay into
the pastoral business, and the result
was the acquirement of the block on
which his present homstead, “Race-
view,” now stands, and which he
purchased from the late Hon.
Edward Flood, of Sydney, who then
owned the adjoining “Gowrie” Sta-
tion. This freehold block comprised
a little over 300 acres at the time
“LYNDHURST CLIPPERS DUKE 10TH.”
of Mr. Armstrong’s purchase. By
subsequent selection he has largely
increased the area of “Raceview,”
and to-day its boundaries enclose
some 40,000 acres of freehold and
leasehold lands. Some time after
the original purchase of this prop-
erty he continued to administer it
from Charleville, in conjunction with
his business in the township, but in
1895 he decided to take up his resi-
dence on the station and devote the
major portion of his time to his
pastoral enterprise. About this
time the possibilities of extending
the scope of his operations became
apparent to his active and fertile
mind, and resulted in the purchase
of the boiling-down works at Charle-
ville, which at that time was owned
by the Hon. Charles Campbell and
his brother. Another notable
westerner in Mr. H. J. Carter, also
referred to in these pages, was taken
into partnership, and under their
skilful management it became one
of the most successful concerns in
the Western District. The Charle-
ville Wool Scour continues to flourish
under the same proprietary, and is
one of the most up-to-date concerns
of its kind in Australia, the
machinery employed being of the
most modern design and the man-
agement beyond criticism. Success
following so closely on his efforts
encouraged Mr. Armstrong to make
another venture, in which he was
again joined by Mr. Carter, the firm
purchasing “Burrindilla” Station
(the old station on which the subject
of our review had spent so much
time as a wage-earner), from the
estate of the late John Moore, of
“Colinton.” This property was run
successfully until 1905, when a
satisfactory offer caused the owners to
part with it. Fortune still smiling
and apparently approving his in-
dustry and foresight, Mr. Armstrong
launched into a fresh proposition,
392

namely, the Charleville Meat Works,
which he purchased from the Kidston
Government in 1908, having pre-
viously held the property on lease
for some time. The Government had
taken over these works from the
original company, which had been
unable to successfully carry them on
owing to droughts and other militant
circumstances. At the time of Mr.
Armstrong’s purchase the business
was in a very unsatisfactory state,
but with characteristic energy he
soon brought about a great improve-
ment and a considerably increased
output. A bore sunk alongside the
works provides a flow of one and a
half million gallons daily, and this
circumstance, combined with the fact
that his land lies on both sides of
the railway, and thus surrounds the
property containing the works and
bore, rendered its acquisition of
peculiar benefit to himself. Some
years later, in 1912, he embarked on
a second pastoral enterprise, on this
occasion purchasing “Mount Moble,’’
a property containing an area of
over 60 square miles of country.
This estate is situated in the
Maranoa district, 15 miles north of
Mungallala, and about the same
distance from Dulbydilla. A third
grazing proposition named “Pin-
gine,” comprising some 80,000 acres,
was acquired at a later date, and is
situated about 16 miles north of the
Cheepie Railway Station and about
115 miles west from Charleville.
This property is under the manage-
ment of his eldest son, Mr. Jofin
Clarke Armstrong, who administers
it under his father’s direction. All
VIEW ON “PINGIEN” STATION,
these properties are controlled from
“Raceview,” and are run chiefly as
cattle propositions, though Mr.
Armstrong devotes considerable at-
tention to the breeding of horses of
some quality, which branch of his
business holds a forward place in the
general order of things. Sheep, for
which the west is famous, are only
carried in sufficient numbers to
supply the requirements of Charle-
ville through his butchering estab-
lishment. The three properties
generally carry about 3,000 head of
shorthorn cattle, from 200 to 300
horses, and about a couple of
thousand sheep. Mr. Armstrong has
always been a keen cattle man and a
close student of the latest methods
for improving the breed of beef
cattle, his main object being to pro-
duce a heavyweight beast combined
with good quality. In this he differs
from the pastoralist who keeps a few
choice bulls for the sake of the name
only, and his methods are an object
lesson to squatters and others
interested in the pastoral industry who
in the main have good stock, and yet
resort to slipshod methods of breed-
ing. He always keeps up the quality
of his beeves by the introduction of
highly-bred shorthorn bulls of the
best type, purchased from studs
which are beyond reproach. As an
example he has in use at
“Raceview” the bull “Lyndhurst
“AGAMEMNON II.” ROAN BULL.
Clippers Duke 10th,” from Mr. C.
E. McDougall’s famous Lyndhurst
stud, a well-formed animal by
“Clippers Duke” (imp) from
“Lily of Gurley,” by “Summer-
ton.” This bull goes back on the
dam’s side in an unbroken line to
the stock of Mr. Maynard, the
breeder of the world-famed “Comet,”
and has also the famous “Derrimut”
blood. “Lyndhurst Clippers Duke
6th” is another animal by the same
sire out of dam “No. 108,” by
“Lord Russell'44th,” bred in South
Australia by the late J. H. Angas.
Another stylishly-bred bull at pre-
sent at “Raceview” is “Lyndhurst
Duke of Derrimut 3rd,” by “Linde-
now Duke of Derrimut 46th,” out
of a cow by “Beverley Duke 20th,”
also bred by J. H. Angas. Mr.
Armstrong has other bulls of great
merit, and several of his cows are
in every way equal in breeding and
quality to many of the stud cham-
pions of the State. He has ex-
hibited his stock from time to time
and has been awarded several cham-
pionships and a number of trophies.
Draughts have been his chief study
in horseflesh, and he has achieved
considerable success in this depart-
ment. The stallion now in use is
“Silver King,” by “Silver Star”
(bred on the Weinholt Estates), by
“Banker,” by “Beaconsfield,” by

a native of South Australia, having

been born at Mount Gambier, in
the south-eastern portion of that
State, on December 8, 1869. He is
the only son by the former marriage
of the late Carl Schmidt, a very
early pioneer of the land of the
Southern Cross, who carried on
farming and grazing pursuits in
farms, and h© inherited from these
progenitors habits of thrift and in-
dustry which stood him in good
stead when he started out on his own
account in a new country. Upon
arrival in South Australia he
entered into partnership with a
brother in a farming proposition, but
some years later disposed of his
interest and in the early seventies
proceeded to Victoria, where he
settled in the Wimmera district, and
continued in agrarian occupations
until the time of his death in 1912.
His energy and honesty of purpose
brought him prominently to the fore
among his fellows, and for many
years he occupied a seat on the
Eriples Shire Council, Victoria,
whilst he was instrumental in intro-
ducing the various progressive move-
ments denoted by the advent of
reading-rooms, mechanics’ institutes,
etc., in the district where he resided.
He was twice married. His first wife
was a daughter of the late J.
Klowess, of Saxon origin, by whom
he had a son and two daughters, all
of whom are still surviving. His
second marriage was with Marie,
daughter of the late Martin Starick,
an old Victorian pioneer, and of this
union there are one son and three
daughters, the son being Mr. W. C.
Schmidt, a grazier residing on his
own property, “Wogganora,” on the
Warrego, near Cunnamulla. The
gentleman under review, Mr. Carl

character to that of “Charlotte

sandy loam, timbered with mulga,

which the first-named predominates.
Its chief natural water supply is the
Nebine Creek, which in ordinary

Mr. Schmidt has completed a con-

having been done prior to his occu-
pation of the run. Pre-eminent
among the improvements for which
he has made himself responsible is a
large bore, producing one and a

through 75 miles of well-constructed
drains. Various dams have been
built in different parts of the pro-

present time the station can boast
only 223 square miles within its
boundaries. A large variety of
natural grasses flourish freely, among
which the prized Mitchell, Flinders,
stretches of the fertile black and
chocolate sorts, for which the dis-
trict is so deservedly noted. It is
high-class sheep country, and has
a carrying capacity of from 30,000
to 35,000 sheep, being grazed at the
present time by a flock of 25,000
merinos and about 600 cattle. The
“Burrenbilla” sheep are well known
in the district and find a ready sale.
Mr. Schmidt has bred rams for the
requirements of his properties since
the year 1902, purchasing from time
to time stud sires of the famous
Pepin blood at the Sydney ram sales.
He increased his fine merino stud in
stud Shorthorn herd on “Burren-
billa” by the purchase of a draft of
stud cows from “Waroo” Station
and the stud bull, “Oxford Duke of
Cambridge the 16th,” from Mr.
Wm. Dugdale, Victoria. His success
as a cattleman is notably evinced in
the fact that he secured for bullocks
sold in the Orange (New South
Wales) yards what is probably a
record price, twenty head averaging
the high figure of £35 11s. Id., and
one animal bringing as much as £4B
ss. The whole draft of 133 which
were sold in Sydney and Orange,
New South Wales, on this occasion
made the satisfactory average of £32
Os. 9d. There are about 1,200 acres
of freehold on “Burrenbilla” Sta-
tion, which, it is interesting to note,
is historically known as “Cunna-
raulla Holding,” or the original
“Cunnamulla” Station, the name
being changed for greater conveni-
ence when the township sprang into
being and annexed the time-
honoured appellation. The improve-
ments on “Burrenbilla” comprise
three artesian bores, supplying over
60 miles of well-made drains in
addition to a considerable mileage of
creeks and old waterways, which are
utilized wherever they conveniently
can be. A further advantage from
the point of view of water facilities
is a frontage of about 11 miles to
the Warrego River, which contains
several deep pools over this part of
its course which are generally con-
sidered to be permanent. These,

however, play no important part in
the general scheme for an adequate
water supply for the station, the
bores alone providing an abundance
of good stock water for all the re-
quirements of both sheep and cattle.
Good woolsheds have been erected on
all three stations, those on “Clifton”
and “Burrenbilla” being thoroughly
up-to-date, while the “Charlotte
Yale” shed, although not quite so
modern in its appointments and
smaller than the other two, can still
hold its own with most structures of
this nature in the district. The three
sheds in all contain about fifty
stands, machines of the Wolseley
manufacture being installed, and in
two out of three these are driven by
a water wheel, for which the bore
water is utilized. This has proved a
distinct success, the scheme being
simple and effective, and on account
of the utilization of the bore flow,
more inexpensive than any other
method of obtaining driving power.
At “Clifton” this water wheel
(locally known as the “Henderson-
Pelton” wheel) was first put on the
bore, and the subsequent work of
cutting timber for the erection of the
woolshed and other buildings on the
run was carried out by its aid. Mr.
Schmidt has erected a comfortable
homestead on “Burrenbilla” in the
vicinity of the bore, which provides
hot water for domestic and house-
hold purposes at a temperature of
114 degrees. The dwelling, which he
uses as headquarters whilst actively
engaged in the management of his
interests in this direction, occupies
a site within six miles of Cunna-
mulla township. In the year 1919
he purchased for and on behalf of
Mrs. Schmidt the land and stock
comprised in “Woggonora,” a pro-
perty lying 20 miles south of Cunna-
mulla, and with a frontage to the
Warrego River. “Woggonora” com-
prises 30,000 acres that are chiefly
characterized by black and chocolate
soils and a prolific growth of Mit-
chell, blue, and Flinders grasses, and
will carry a flock of 6,000. Since
his advent to the district Mr.
Schmidt has associated himself with
its various organizations, being a
member of the committee of the
South Warrego Pastoralists’ Asso-
ciation, in the interests of which he

nagh, County Carlow, Ireland, on
July 13, 1878. He is the youngest
son of the late John Ryan, who

followed the avocation of a farmer
on the acres which had been in the
family’s possession for many genera-
tions, his progenitors having also
followed agrarian pursuits in County
Carlow, where this branch of the
Ryan family was well known and
esteemed. The subject of our mem-
oir, Mr. J. J. Ryan, was educated at
Carlow College under the auspices of
having reached man’s estate, set sail
for Queensland, in which State his
brothers had previously settled and
were at that time already on the
road to prosperity. Immediately
following his arrival be obtained a
position on “Terrick-Terrick” Sta-
tion, being compensated for his work
according to the then prevailing low
rate of wages, and gaining his first
insight into the pastoral industry.
Before he had completed a year in
the land of his adoption he had
accepted a position as overseer on
“Cootabynia” Station, then owned
by his brother, Mr. Michael Ryan,
owner of “Arcturus Downs,”
“Vindex,” “Homebush,” and other
stations, and whose career is des-
cribed in another portion of this
work. For three years he fulfilled
the duties incidental to his position
on “Cootabynia,” thus becoming
proficient in all matters relative to
the industry which was to form the
basis of his future career, leaving
there to follow the more lucrative
calling of a shearer. In those days
this occupation was the only branch
of station work which was sufficiently
remunerative to allow of a surplus
that might by patient thrift grow
large enough to provide for future
investment. Mr. J. J. Ryan was
engaged in shearing for about ten
years, his operations in this direc-
tion extending all over the Barcoo
country. At the end of that time he
had accumulated sufficient capital to
enable him to embark in business on
his own account, and he became
grazier. He obtained the block of
land upon which his present home-
stead now stands from the Crown
and named it “Carlow.” He at once
proceeded to the property, to the

eldest brother, Mr. Thomas Ryan,
now living in retirement in Brisbane,

acquired the block adjoining “Car-

conjunction until the retirement of
the elder in the year 1918,

character for integrity survives with
his memory in the hearts of many
early residents of the district. He
was engaged in contracting work at
Blackall for many years, the Masonic
numbering about 20,000, and in
addition about 100 head of cattle
and 80 horses for station use, such
of the latter not required for this
purpose being sold. The “Carlow”
flock was built from “Boonoke” rams
crossed with ewes from “Minnie
Downs,” and the blood has been
renewed when necessary by the
importation of rams from the best
southern studs. The run is sub-
divided into 17 paddocks by about
140 miles of fencing and is watered
by three permanent holes in the bed
of Bride Creek, this natural provi-
sion being supplemented by two
sub-artesian bores from which the
supply is distributed to the stock
through engine power and the action
of windmills. The country is undu-
lating in character, being composed
of Mitchell grass and blue grass
plains alternating with belts of good,
edible scrub. It is also plentifully
supplied with good herbage and
natural grasses. Mr. Ryan supervised
the erection of the homestead, which
occupies a site some 50 miles south
of Blackall, soon after his acquire-
ment of the property, and the

development, is charmingly situated,

tion and of the Show committee.
Be married in 1906 Mary, daughter
of the late Patrick Spillane, a
native of County Cork, Ireland, who
during his lifetime ranked as one of
the oldest of western pioneers. The
late gentleman will be remembered
as an old Blackall identity, and his
Hall of that town being among the
buildings erected under his direction.
The late gentleman married Annie
Enright, whose progenitors hailed
from Killarney, Ireland. Mrs.
Spillane’s unfailing help to her
pioneer husband may well be re-
corded. It was her lot to nobly bear
with him the burden and trials of
the early days of the West, and there
is no doubt that future generations
also, proud of their race, will render
to such wives and mothers the
honour which is their due. Mr. and
Mrs. Ryan have a family of three
sons and three daughters.

died when his son George was still
in infancy. The latter, after a brief
period of primary schooling, was
engaged at a very early age in a
flax-spinning mill, and later, when a
boy of 14, was apprenticed to the
merchant service. He followed this
avocation for about two years, but
tiring of the monotony of the life,
accompanied as it was by the rigour
and undue severity of those hard
times, and possessing a spirit which
rebelled against the harsh conditions
which then prevailed, he made a
bid for a life more in keeping with
his liberty-loving nature. At the age
of 16 he joined 20 others who were
leaving their ship at the port of
Lyttleton, New Zealand, with the
express object of making a living on
the land, thus exchanging the perils
and hardships of the deep for an
equally arduous but more inde-
pendent career ashore. He was

spent in this avocation he decided
to seek fresh fields for his energies,
and before the attainment of his
seventeenth birthday arrived in
Tasmania, where he remained for
three and a half years, following
agrarian pursuits in various parts of
the Apple Isle during this period.
The possibility of enlarging his
experience and gaining a wider
outlook on life, coupled with the
roving spirit which, no doubt, was
fostered during his sojourn at sea,
were responsible for his arrival in
Australia in the year 1870. He
secured a position on

months occupied in this maner he
conducted a business in Queen Street

attend this enterprise, and as a
result he returned to the west and
opened a merchant’s business at
more profitable purpose, for he set
up a business as a general station

which he proved a past-master;

western Queensland, where he shortly
afterwards commenced dealing in
merchandise, travelling all over that
part of the State, and putting into
Charleville, which he carried on for
three years. Near the termination
of this period, the possibility of
working up a more profitable trade

A few cattle and horses for station
use also graze on the “Vine Tree

very fond of a well-bred horse, and
makes a hobby of breeding a good
type of animal. In the matter of
water conservation, “Vine Tree
Downs” has received considerable
attention, being well supplied by the
output of a bore and by tanks and
dams. The property, although well
improved, is still in course of
development, and before long will
attain to a standard superior to most
propositions of its kind in the west.
The homestead is of simple design,
and was built chiefly with a view to
comfort, and the dwelling fulfills all
the requirements of the average
country house. An orchard orna-
ments the surroundings, and par-
ticular attention is given to the
cultivation of vegetables for home
consumption. The latter is watered
from the same bore that provides the
stock with their chief supply. Mr.
McWilliams is of a retiring nature,
and though he has often been
approached relative to his accept-
ance of a Commission of the Peace,
and also in the matter of his more
prominent association with the public
life of the district, he has hitherto
declined offers of this nature, pre-
ferring to confine his energies to the
personal management of his private
affairs. He is, however, a hearty
advocate of all clean forms of sport,
and a devotee of the sport of horse-
racing. In the latter connection he
has bred and raced many good horses
at country meetings with consider-
able success for several years past.

his grandsons were to play so large
a part as producers of the raw
material. The late Archibald Moffat
arrived in Australia with his young
wife and their infant son, John, who
was born during the voyage from the
Mother Country to the land of the
Southern Cross in the year 1851,
landing in Victoria. He immediately
endeavoured to find employment at
the trade which he had followed in
his native land, but the earliest
records that remain of his doings at
this period show that he was working
on a farm in order to provide the
necessities of life for his wife and
child, his only capital being his
native Scotch honesty and industry
of character, coupled with a strength
of muscle and will, the whole force
of which was thrown into his efforts
to achieve success in the country of
his adoption. At a later date, when
the opportunity arose, he worked at
his old trade for some time, and by
the exercise of the greatest thrift
amassed sufficient capital to enable
him to make a start in life on his

the year 1882 Mr. James Moffat and
his brother George visited Queens-

country which would permit of an
extension of their operations, and
after inspecting many pastoral
properties became enamoured of the
possibilities of “Bloomfield,” one of
the old original station holdings of
the west, which they purchased from
a Mr. William Jessop in 1883. In
the year 1884 they were joined by
their brother Hugh, and some time
later by Robert and William

in New South Wales). Prior to this

that the property had been fully
developed before the building of this
structure became a necessity proved
an advantage, the site for the new


home being chosen in close proximity
to a good water supply and in a
central position, thus rendering the
work of supervision much easier for
the owner. Many of the older home-
steads in the distinct, erected near

be in an unsuitable position, but in
the selection of the locality on which
the “Bloomfield” homestead now
stands care was taken to avoid this
fault. The presence of well-tended
flower beds and lawns, studded with
citrus trees and native shrubs, adds
a pleasing touch to the natural
surroundings of the home. There is
also a vegetable garden, without
which a station home would be
regarded as incomplete. The numer-
ous outhouses are roomy and solidly
noted for that old-time hospitality
which was so marked a feature of
the homes of the early pioneers of
the pastoral industry —a reminder
of those good old days, the spirit of
which still lingers around the place
wherein the subject of our review
has spent the greater part of his
life. Mr. Moffat is able to look back
upon years of drought and the conse-
quent bad times which were success-
fully surmounted by his indomitable
pluck, hard work, and capable
administration. With the coming
of better seasons and increased
values he reaped his just reward,
and, aided by his own sterling
qualities, placed himself in the
position which he enjoys to-day.

and foresight which distinguished
the founder of the family, and from
his early grounding in the industry
has exemplified how greatly such
qualities count in furthering the
interests of the community, especi-

“VICTORIA DOWNS” Station,
the property of Messrs. Lord Bros.,
was purchased in 1906 by Mr. A. P.
Lord, father of the present owners,
who made it over to his sons in 1914.

permanent flow of water has been
secured through the medium of seven
sub-artesian bores, each of which has
a 20,000 gallon storage tank and the
requisite troughing for the utilization
of the supply. In addition there
are eight dams and a couple of creeks,
in which there are a number of good
waterholes. The boundaries on the
north, east, and western sides of
the run, are wire-netted, while the
southern boundary is formed by
the Government rabbit fence. The
prickly pear is conspicuous by its
absence, the whole of the sheep areas
being free of this pest. The “Victoria
Downs’' stud of merinos has been
described as a “Queensland stud of
pure ‘Wanganella’ blood." It was
started in 1911 with pure-bred sheep
from “Deniliquin Park" and “Wan-
ganella” Estate studs, in New
South Wales, and right up to the
present all new blood introduced to
“Victoria Downs” has come from the
same studs. From “Deniliquin Park”
2,460 ewes were purchased, and 40
choice rams, among which were 10
reserve rams, which cost Mr. Lord
up to 300 guineas each. At the
Sydney ram sales a son of “Ajax"
was bought for 460 guineas, and four
other rams at prices ranging from
300 to 210 guineas. More recently
Lord Bros, purchased “Stud Park
No. 10" for 2,500 guineas from
Mr. Thomas Millear, Deniliquin
Park Stud. New blood is con-
stantly being introduced, and in
this way the quality of the stud stock
is maintained at a very high level.
With this sound foundation to work
upon, the Lord Brothers made rapid
progress in building up a select stud.
The station has been described as a
stud farm pure and simple, albeit a
large one, grazing no other than stud
sheep, between 5,000 and 6,000 of
which roam over the succulent pas-
tures. The large areas of practically
virgin country have been big factors
in bringing about the success achieved
by the Messrs. Lord, and the “Vic-
toria Downs" stud has been happily
termed by a contemporary “the
Queensland ‘Wanganella.’ ” All the
sheep are large-framed animals,
showing great depth and good backs,
and having a fine carriage. The
fleece is a bright medium wool, of
good, long, solid staple, with plenty
of character and exceptional density,
the wool on the back being tightly
packed and very clean, the the belly
wool dense and of great length.
Many of the ewes originally intro-
duced, although 13 or 14 years old,
are still good breeders, and during
the trying drought of 1915 displayed
great endurance, rearing sturdy,
well-grown lambs through this
period. A distinguishing feature of
the rams introduced from New
South Wales is their ready faculty
for acclimatization, which should
prove a valuable quality to recom-
mend them in the markets. The son

area, 90 miles from Charleville,
and comprises about 60,000 acres of
open downs, well watered, and tim-
bered on the eastern side. It carries
both sheep and cattle, and until 1915
was managed by Mr. R. S. Lord, who
relinquished control to take charge of
“Dunstan,” a property lying 45
miles north-west of Charleville, and
comprising about 47,000 acres of
first-rate sheep country. Stud rams
from “Victoria Downs” are being
used on both these stations, and the
experiment of removing flock ewes
thither from the stud farm during
the drought season has been attended
with the best results, the fleeces cur
from these averaging 9 lbs. of clean,
bright wool, while 75 per cent, of
lambs were reared. There are
over 3,000 breeding ewes on
‘‘Victoria Downs,” and the ever-
increasing demand for this type
of Queensland-bred ‘ ‘Wanganella”
is demonstrated by the fact that
all the young flock rams from
the station are eagerly booked by
western pastoralists for delivery
immediately after classing. The same
may be said of the high-class stud
rams of this popular type. The wool
was submitted for appraisement for
the first time in November, 1917, and
was commented on as being “shafty,
full-stapled, bright in appearance,
nice-conditioned, and practically free
from fault, and particularly suited
to the wool industry from a spinner’s
point of view.” The first quality ewe
wool of the station brought 2s.
per lb. in the grease. The success
achieved by Mr. R. P. Lord as a
studmaster of sheep moved him to
inaugurate a cattle stud of pure
shorthorns. With this end in view he
purchased at the National Exhibi-
tion, 1917, two yearling bulls, one of
which, “Lyndhurst Royal Peer
11th,” is an exceptionally fine
animal, and some cows, among them
being “Countess Wild Eye 7th”
(second prize, Sydney Royal Show),
whose last two calves realized 100
and 105 guineas respectively. This
calf has now (December, 1917) a calf
at foot by “Grand Duke of Clifton,”
son of the “Yandina” bull which was
sold for 700 guineas. Besides the
foregoing, 25 highly-bred heifers
were also purchased from New South
Wales, all being progeny of well-
known sires, and with these well-bred
animals to build up from, it may be
safely predicted that the “Victoria
Downs” stud shorthorns will soon
rank among the best in the State.
The founder of the Lord family in
Australia, the late Simeon Lord, left
England for Tasmania a century
ago, subsequently becoming one of
the pioneers of the pastoral industry
in the northern part of New South
AVales (now Queensland). His son,
Mr. Alfred P. Lord, who now lives
in retirement at Sydney, was well
known as manager of the Gympie
branch of the Australian Joint Stock
Bank, where he was located for a
considerable time. He gained his
experience in the pastoral industry
with his brother, the late Robert
Lord, in conjunction with whom he
founded “Woolooga” Station, now a

The firm of BANKS BROTH-
ERS, owners of “Duneira,” Blackall,
was originally founded by the late
William Henry Banks and his
brother, Richard Baker Banks. The
late gentleman was of English
parentage, and a native of Victoria,
and came to Queensland in the
year 1878, where he filled the post
of overseer at “Ravensbourne” Sta-
tion, in the Blackall district. He
carried out the duties incidental to
this position for four or five years,
and in 1881 was joined by Mr.
Richard Baker Banks, the brothers
setting r;p a business as contractors
for tank-sinking, and subsequently
being jointly engaged as hotel-
keepers, wool-scourers, and in var-
ious other avocations which gave
scope for their enterprise. Eventually
they selected lands which were
part of the resumptions of “North-
ampton Downs” and “Ravensbourne”
Stations, and later purchased “Dun-
eira,” this name being given to their
combined holdings. The death of
the late Mr. William Henry Banks
occurred in the year 1903, and his
family purchased the interests of their
uncle, Mr. R. B. Banks, in 1912. The
latter gentleman now (1919) lives in
retirement at “Duneira,” enjoying
well-earned rejiose from the life of
early hardship, sacrifice, and indus-
trious effort shared with his late
brother in the building up of the
family fortunes, and the estate is
now managed by the eldest member
of the present firm, Mr. John

these acres since the year 1907.

EDMUND DAWSON LEGH,
“Paradise Downs,” Blackall, was
born at “Newstead” Station, one of
the original pastoral homesteads of
New South Wales, on June 9, 1866.
MR. F. R. LEGH.
He is the eldest son of the late
Christopher Legh, a member of an
ancient English line whose head-
quarters were in Cheshire, where the
old home of the family still stands,
and in the annals relating to the
county aristocracy their name is still
to be seen ranking with others of
equal distinction. According to
authentic records their line dates
back to the eleventh century, the late
Edward Dawson Legh, grandfather
of the gentleman under review, being
the third son of John Legh, of
Booths, who was a descendant in a
direct line of Gilbert de Venables,
in the Barony of Kilderton, who
died a templar in the reign of Henry
11. of England in the year 1086.
The additional name of Dawson was
assumed on the occasion of the mar-
riage of Isabella, a member of the
Legh family, with her co-heir, Mr.
Edmund Dawson, of Wharton,
Lancashire, late in the seventeenth
century. Lack of space prevents us
from making full use of the
authentic records at our disposal
relative to the history of this family;
suffice to say that among its mem-
bers have been included men who
were distinguished as judges and
members of Parliament and the
Diplomatic Service, even in the old
romantic days of “Merrie England,”
when men defended their honour
with their lives in the duelling field.
The grandfather of the subject of
our memoir, Mi'. E. D. Legh, after
whom the latter is named, was an
Oxford man, and is recorded as
having taken first place in mathem-
atics in that seat of learning in the
year 1821. Subsequently he prac-
tised as a barrister of the Inner
Temple, London, but later entered
holy orders, after his ordination
being appointed to the curacy of
Holy Trinity Church, London. He
married Catherine, daughter of the
Right Honourable Sir Christopher
Robinson, of Bedford Square, Lon-
don, and of Surrey, who at that
time was a Judge of the Admiralty.
The late Christopher Legh was born
in London after his father entered
the Church. He received his
MR. E. D. LEGH
education at Harrow, and on
the conclusion of his scholastic
course there was offered the choice
of qualifying for a profession
or a career on the land. Having
elected to take his place in the nation
as a producer, he became a landed
proprietor while still in his teens,
and followed farming pursuits at
Roxburgh, Isle of Wight, until lie
married at about 24 years of age.
At this time the possibility of
achieving a larger share of success
in the wider areas of a newer world
and the fascinating glamour which
at that time surrounded the distant
island continent under the Southern
Cross, caused him to uproot his
earlier associations and ambitions
and transplant them in that land of
promise. He arrived in Australia
with his young wife in the early
fifties in the historic and ill-fated
“Dunbar,” which was subsequently
wrecked on the South Head, Sydney,
there being but a solitary survivor
of this tragic event. The late Mr.
Legh became engaged in pastoral
pursuits in New South Wales,
becoming part owner of “Gyrah”
Station, near Armidale. He also
managed “Newstead” Station, near
Inverell, for the Anderson Estate,
this property having been formerly
owned by his father-in-law, the late
Dr. Anderson. Later he purchased
“Blair Hill,” a pastoral property
near Glen Innis, which he carried on
for some time, and which was sub-
sequently the scene of his death,
which occurred in the year 1892.
The late gentleman was thrice
wedded, having a family of six sons
and four daughters by the first
marriage, a daughter by the second,
and a son by the third. Four sons
and three daughters by the first
marriage and the two children of his
later unions survive him. His first
wife was Jane, daughter of the late
Dr. Alexander Anderson, one of the
earliest pioneers of the Inverell dis-
trict of New South Wales. After
his arrival from Scotland Dr. Ander-
son practised his profession in the
Mother State for some time,

held pastoral positions in this State
until his death in the year 1914, as
also did Mr. Gilbert Legh, up to
in order to take part in that
struggle. Edmund Dawson Legh
received his primary education by
private tuition, and later continued
his studies at the Armidale Grammar
School until the attainment of his
sixteenth year, when he returned to
devoting liis spare time to study
with the object of increasing
the knowledge gathered by him
while at school. In the year 1896
he decided to make a
start in life on his own
account, and taking his
patrimony rode west and
north some 1,200 miles in
company with his brother
Gilbert, and after in-
specting various properties
picked upon "Paradise
Downs,’’ which at that
time was composed of
several small blocks of
country. Subsequently, by
the additional purchase
and selection of other
blocks, in conjunction with
his brother, Mr. Francis
Robert Legh, the extent
of the holding was brought
up to its present area of
some 32,000 acres. At
the time of writing "Para-
dise Downs’’ enjoys the
reputation of being one of the
most highly-developed and im-
proved properties of its kind in
the time of the outbreak of the
South African war, which caused

the parental property to assist in its
administration. Pie spent some 12
years in this manner, during the
earlier portion of that period
the Blackall district. The part-
nership between Messrs. E. D.
and F. 11. Legh continued for
five years, at the conclusion of which


time, and as a result of the drought
of 1901-2 (which broke in 1903), the
last-named gentleman sold his inter-
ests to his brother, who conducted
the property on his own behalf until
the year 1909, when he went into
semi-retirement. In the following
year he made a tour of the world,
leaving the administration of the
property in the hands of another
brother, Mr. Christopehr Legh (since
deceased). On the death of the latter
gentleman, Mr. F. R. Legh took
over the management, and has since
successfully filled that post on behalf
of the owner. In the early part of
the year 1907, during his personal
conduct of the property, Mr. E. D.
Legh laid the foundation of his
present merino stud by the purchase
of 50 pure-bred ewes and a ram from
the herd by their fidelity to type
exemplifying his scientific knowledge
and judgment. During his world
tour the owner of “Paradise Downs”
made a close study of life and the
general conditions relating to other
countries, being fully alive to his op-
portunities as regarding the gaining
of a still wider knowledge of stock
matters while travelling on the Con-
tinent. As a lover of good horses
he was much attracted by the sturdy
type of animal bred in Norway, and
regarded as a valuable utility horse,
and as a consequence he secured a
stallion and two mares for his sta-
tion. This sire, still in use at
“Paradise Downs,” has a fine
carriage, and shows plenty of bone
and muscular development. The
importations were well - known
pastoral homes. Verandahs surround
the house, which is shaded by
trellised vines, and the grounds are
beautified by well-tended garden
plots, tennis lawn, and ornamental
shrubs, and in the middle distance,
separating the home from its wide
acres, is a picturesque expanse of
cultivation, containing several plots,
which are devoted to the culture of
different imported grasses for the
benefit of the stud stock. Mr. Legh
has always been an active participant
in all matters connected with the
welfare of the district wherein his
chief interests are centred, and all
matters of a charitable or patriotic
nature can count on his support.
Shortly after coming to Blackall he
was elected as a committeeman of
the local hospital, and added his
Mr. W. H. Gibson, of “Fairfield,”
Epping, Tasmania. With these as a
nucleus he built up his stud, which
now contains over 1,000 well-bred
animals. This particular breed has
proved itself to be very hardy, and
has successfully withstood severe
tests of drought and other adverse
conditions which have prevailed at
various places in the Central West.
The flock has been kept up to its
high standard by the introduction
of new blood of the same strain at
frequent intervals. At the same time
as he founded the merino stud Mr.
Legh also established a herd of
pure-bred Ayrshires, one of the first
of the kind formed in that portion
of the State. In this department,
also, he has had considerable success,

height of the breed. Their descend-
ants promise to add to the prestige

future as a pony-breeding centre. In
normal seasons ‘‘Paradise Downs”
carries some 15,000 sheep and 300
head of cattle, besides the requisite
number of horses for working pur-
poses. It is subdivided into several
suitably-sized paddocks and watered
by the output of a sub-artesian bore
and by conveniently-placed tanks
and dams. The homestead is situ-
ated 14 miles from Blackall, and is
a modern structure, its design being
of the style usually favoured for
name to the list of members of the
local racing club. Later he was
elected to the Kargoolnah Shire
Council, and rendered valuable ser-
vices for a number of years. In
connection with the Blackall Agri-
cultural Society he was foremost
among those interested in its revival,
and worked energetically to the
accomplishment of this end. He has
been a very successful exhibitor at
the annual show, gaining many
awards with his cattle, sheep, and
blood stock. He is one of the found-
ation members of the Blackall Club,
and at time of writing is a
trustee of that institution. In con-
junction with other prominent men
of the Blackall district, he inter-
ested himself in the establishment of

was still merely an inaugural and
trial system. His forbears dwelt in
the environs of London, England,
where, according to tradition, the
family were engaged in agrarian
pursuits in times long past. The late
Mr. Joseph Stratford carried on the
business of a poulterer in New
South Wales, where he was amongst
the earliest followers of that calling,
MR. W. J. STRATFORD.
in which his sons, the late Mr.
JAMES STRATFORD, and his
brother, HENRY STRATFORD,
were associated with him in their
MR. S. STRATFORD
more youthful days. The two last-
named gentlemen were born at
Richmond, in the Hawkesbury dis-
trict, New South Wales, in the late
forties, the former being the older
by two years, and the father of the
Messrs. Stratford Brothers, of
“Stratavon.” Owing to the lack of

days, the scholastic knowledge

obtained in tbeir boyhood was neces-
sarily of the most limited descrip-

they both became employed in
MR. H. STARTFORD.
pastoral avocations, Henry accepting
an offer as stock and general station
hand on a cattle station in the Moore
district, New South Wales, and
James obtaining bush work in the


Cobar district shortly afterwards.
The brothers experienced the usual
vicissitudes incidental to the bush
life and work of the period, the
often severe privations and un-
ameliorated hardships, going their
separate ways until the year 1876,
when Henry drifted to Queensland
and secured work on “Currawildi”
Station. In the course of the duties
connected with his position he was
employed in droving cattle to New
South Wales, passing through the
district in which his brother James
was then engaged in tank-sinking,
the work being done under contract.
The chance encounter resulted in the
brothers joining forces in this avoca-
tion, which Mr. James Stratford had
successfully followed for the pre-
vious ten years, during which period
he had become one of the best-known
mechanics in that branch of station
development in New South Wales,
in which State he had also interests
in the copper-mining industry.
Messrs. James and Henry Stratford
carried on the above business as
partners in the Mother State until
the year 1883, when they visited
Queensland, where they were subse-
quently engaged in work of a similar
nature for many years. “Isis
Downs,” “Alice Downs,” “Port-
land,” “Terrick-Terrick,” “North-
ampton Downs,” and other stations
were the scenes of their labours.
They also took contracts for fencing,
much of which still stands as evi-
dence of the superior workmanship
of these two old pioneers, whose
tasks were performed through the
scorching heats of the western mid-
summers and the bleak winds of
winter time. By their ability and
undoubted integrity they achieved a
reputation which commanded the
goodwill and respect of all with
whom they came into contact. In
the year 1894 Mr. Henry Stratford
took up a selection on a resumed
portion of the “Ravensbourne”
Estate, his brother James acquiring
a block on “Terrick-Terrick” in the
following year. After some years
spent in the development of these
properties, however, the brothers
were obliged to sell out, owing to
the effects of the great drought
which ravaged the west from 1899
to 1902. However, having still
their tank-sinking outfit, they re-
turned to their former business for
a brief period, Mr. James Stratford
subsequently taking up a selection
south of Isisford, in the name of
his second son, Frederick Peter.
The estate was named “Strathfield,”
and shortly after its acquirement the
late gentleman and his family, in
conjunction with Mr. Henry Strat-
ford, entered upon the developmental
work of the property, which was
conducted in the general interest,
until the fatal illness of the former,
who was numbered with the great
majority in the year 1904, leaving
a widow and a grown-up family of
four sons and two daughters. Mr.
Henry Stratford and his nephews
continued in the joint administration
of the estate until the retirement of
the former, who is unmarried, and
now spends the autumn of his days
in the home of the family at Isis-
ford. The late Mrs. Stratford was
a descendant of a Celtic family
hailing from the Emerald Isle, from
whom she inherited those intrinsic
qualities which rendered her so
worthy a helpmeet to her pioneer
husband, with whom she cheerfully
endured the many hardships and
sacrifices of those early days. Fate
was not lavish in sprinkling the
luxuries of life in the path of the
pioneer mother, whose death occurred
before the achievement of the
ultimate success which crowned the
efforts of her children, to whom she
has left so faithful an example of
wifehood and motherhood. She died
at Isisford in the year 1911, where
she will be long remembered for her
kindness of heart and ever-ready
charity. Of the members of the
present firm the two elder, William
James and Frederick Peter, were
born in New South Wales on Octo-
ber 12, 1880, and May 9, 1882,
respectively. The third, Albert
Ernest, was born at Farrell Creek,
Queensland, on February 1, 1885,
and the younger, Stephen, on the
“Terrick-Terrick” Estate, on the
Barcoo, on August 9, 1888. Their
primary education was received
through private tuition under the
parental roof, and their later studies
were pursued for a time at the State
school at Isisford. On attaining to
years of usefulness they became each
in their turn of assistance to their
parents, eventally becoming em-
ployed in pastoral pursuits on their
own account. In the year 1915 the
brothers added to their landed in-
terests by securing “Stratavon,”
this property being formerly a por-
tion of the “Avington” resumption.
The combined area of “Stratfield”
and “Stratavon” embraces 25,000

acres of good undulating country, on
which Flinders, Mitchell, and many
other natural grasses flourish pro-
lifically, and an abundance of
useful herbage is also borne,
which provides additional feed for
the stock and has proved a great
stand-by in drought time. The
country is well watered, both pro-
perties, though separated by a dis-
tance of 50 miles, having a
considerable frontage to the Barcoo
River. “Stratavon” and “Strat-

conjunction by the four brothers,
are still in course of development,
and are devoted to the production
of sheep. The late Mr. James
Stratford’s two daughters are mar-
ried, and at time of writing reside
in the Barcoo district.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND ; ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


SAMUEL BLACKSTOCK, J.P.,
“Forest Hill,” Blackall, was bom at
Drum, near Thornhill, Dumfrieshire,
Scotland, on April 24, 1869. He
is the eldest son of the late David
Blackstock, also a native of the
Scottish Lowlands, the late gentle-
man having followed grazing pur-
suits on the farm which had been the
home of his progenitors and where
they had followed agrarian avoca-
tions for generations. The family
were also well known as stock
breeders in Dumfrieshire. The
founder of the line in Australia,
being attracted by the possibilities
which had tended to the success of so
many of his compatriots in newer
lands, uprooted the associations of a
lifetime, being then in his late
forties, and set sail for Canada, with
the intention of settling there if the
future gave promise of realizing
these possibilities. After a brief
period spent in that Dominion, how-
ever, he decided that a larger scope
awaited his efforts in Australia, and
consequently came to Queensland in
the late seventies accompanied by
his wife and the family then born to
him. On arrival in this State he
obtained a post as manager of “May
Downs” Station, near Clermont,
then owned by the firm of Gilchrist,
Watt, & Co., where he remained
until the education of his family
necessitated his removal to Too-
woomba. In that town he became
associated with the Press, subse-
quently purchasing the Darling
Downs Gazette, which he conducted
for a number of years. He later
disposed of that paper to the present
proprietors, in order to again take
on station management, and after-
wards occupied a position as manager
on “Hamilton Downs,” on the
Flinders River, until his retirement
from active life. He died in
Brisbane, being survived by a family
of three sons and one daughter, all
of whom were born in the Old World,
with the exception of the third son,
Mr. William Alexander Blackstock,
who is well known in commercial
circles at Brisbane, and possesses an
interest with his brother, the gentle-
man under review, in “Forest Hill.”
His second son, Mr. John M. Black-
stock, is an officer in the Union Bank
of Australia, Ltd., Brisbane, and
one of his daughters is married to a
Mr. Young, manager of a branch of
that institution at Lyttleton, New
Zealand. Mr. Samuel Blackstock
received his education in the
Toowoomba Grammar School, and
an the completion of his scholastic
course entered upon a course of
training in survey work. After
spending about two years in the
study of this profession he became
attracted by the possibilities of gold-
mining, and proceeded to the Croy-
don diggings to test the possibilities
of that industry, which he followed
with more or less success for the
following two years. At the ter-
mination of this period he accepted a
post as jackaroo on “Thurulgoona”
Station, in the Warrego district,
and a year later was employed as
overseer at “Bundaleer,” an out-
station of “Thurulgoona” where he
remained for five years. He resigned
from the latter position in 1895 and
purchased a block of land at
MR. S. BLACKSTOCK.
Balnagowan, near Mackay, where he
became engaged in the sugar-grow-
ing industry. This venture proved
unfortunate owing to the effects of
a severe drought, and in consequence
of which he was forced to relinquish
the property, shortly afterwards
proceeding to "Mount Alma” Sta-
tion, near Gladstone, an estate then
owned by his uncle, the late Nichol
Stirrat, where he found employment
as a stock and general station hand.
His work on this estate included the
breaking-in of the station horses and
enlarged his already extended ex-
perience in the various branches of
the industry. He left “Mount Alma”
in the year 1898 in order to take
over the management of “Mount
Watson,” near Blackall, where he
remained for two years, this estate
being closed down in 1900, owing to
the effects of the drought then
raging. After taking the “Mount
Watson” sheep on the road and dis-
posing of them by sale, Mr. Black-
stock again took a post on his uncle’s
property. Subsequently he became
overseer at “Lome,” and six months
later was offered and accepted
the overseership of “Northampton
Downs,” a property then in the
hands of Sir Francis Murphy &
Sons. In the year 1904 he was
appointed to the managership of
this estate, which he successfully
administered on behalf of the earlier
proprietors for some years, retaining
his post under the later ownership
of the Northampton Pastoral Co.,
and has occupied it ever since. He
entered the industry on his own
account in the year 1912, purchasing
in partnership with Michael Ryan,
his present property, “Forest Hill,”
from the estate of the late Sir
Francis Murphy, which he adminis-
ters from “Northampton Downs”
through his overseer. Three years
later he bought out Mr. Ryan’s
interests in the property. “Forest
Hill” embraces an area of 80,000
acres, which are devoted to sheep.
The country is similar to that gener-
ally prevailing in the district sur-
rounding Blackall. Mr. Blackstock
has taken a most prominent part in
all affairs having for their object the
advancement and development of the
district since his advent thereto. He
was gazetted a Justice of the Peace
by the Kidston Administration. At
the present time he is the
president of the Blackall Club and
has been a member of the Shire
Council for the past fourteen years,
having formerly been chairman of
that body for a considerable time.
He has also occupied the chair for a
number of years in connection with
the Marsupial Board, on which he
still retains a seat. At time of
writing he is president of the
Blackall Race Club and of the Hos-
pital Committee, being a life gover-
nor of the latter institution, and
formerly occupied the presidentship
of the Barcoo Amateur Race Club
for a lengthy period. He married
in 1916 Jessie, daughter of Mr.
W. W. Hood, general manager of
the firm of Messrs. Birt & Co.,
Brisbane, who was formerly identi-
fied with the pastoral industry in
Queensland. Mr. Blackstock has
one daughter.


CHARLES EDWARD and
AUGUSTUS HENRY GLISSAN
are the only surviving sons of the
late Patrick Charles Glissan, M.D.,
M.R.C.S., who, hailing from Ireland

and accompanied by his wife and
the children then born to him,
arrived in Sydney in the early
forties. For some years the late
gentleman followed his profession
in and around Sydney, but in 1848

came to Queensland and practised
in Ipswich and Drayton (then known
as The Springs), continuing for a few
years at the former place and
remaining in Drayton until the time
of his death, which occurred in the
year 1857. Dr. Glissan had a family
of six sons and six daughters. The
former Thomas Going, Robert
Going, John, George, Charles Ed-
ward, and Augustus Henry —were
all actively identified with the
pastoral industry in Queensland.
The two youngest sons were educated
at Drayton at a school conducted by
Mr. Joseph Rendall, and were also
taught by Mr. Rutledge, the father
of the late Sir Arthur Rutledge.
Mr. Charles Edward Glissan was
born at Wooloomooloo, Sydney, on
September 3, 1845. He concluded
his schooldays at the age of sixteen,
when he was commissioned by Mr.
(after Sir) Hugh Nelson to take 700
valuable rams from “Eton Vale”
(Mr. John Watts, owner) to “The
MR. T. G. GLISSAN.
Auburn,” a station in the Burnett
district, then the property of Mr.
Piggott, the purchaser of the rams.
On the safe delivery of his charges
after a journey throughout the
whole of which he led a pack-horse
loaded with swags, tents, rations,
and utensils, and was assisted by one
man only, who accomplished the trip
on foot, he was offered and accepted
a position on “The Auburn,” where
he remained some years, learning
sheep farming under conditions very
different from those prevailing at
the present day, flocks at that time
having to be shepherded, as there
were no paddocks, and ewes having
to be hand-lambed. Eventually he
left Mr. Piggott’s employ and spent
some time droving, taking charge at
different times of mobs of sheep and
cattle. He continued on the roads
until offered a station managership,
his acceptance of which was the first
step in a lengthy administrative

career. Amongst the properties of
which he had control was “Cork”
Station, which he administered for
sixteen years, originally for the
Darling Downs and Western Land
Co., and later on behalf of the
MR. G. E. GLISSAN.
Queensland National Bank, Ltd.
From “Cork” Station he was trans-
ferred to “Wetheroil,” in the Bur-

over four years, at the end of which,

over by the Government for pur-
poses of closer settlement, the Bank,

and the head station buildings,
disposed of the stock. Mr. Glissan,
who had been employed as pastoral
manager for the Queensland National
Bank for twenty years, had in the
meantime acquired an interest with
Mr. Robert Donaldson in a 20,000-
acre block of first-class sheep country
in the Warrego district that had
been selected by the latter gentle-
man in 1887. On leaving “Wether-
on” he took over the management
up of “Diamond Downs,” near
Clermont; “Beta,” near Alpha;
“Sedgeford”; and “Medway” Sta-
tions. After improving these proper-
ties they sold the three first
mentioned, and a dissolution of part-
uership being agreed upon in 1914,
Mr. Glissan became the sole owner of
“Baneda” and Mr. Donaldson re-
tained “Medway.” The former con-
tinned to administer his pastoral
interests at “Baneda” until July,
1920, when selling the area to
Messrs. Martin, Frith, & Sons he re-
tired from active connection with the
industry and went to live at “Taa-
binga,” his Toowoomba residence,
of Toowoomba and its district.
AUGUSTUS HENRY GLISSAN
was born at Penrith, New South
Wales, in June, 1847, and was
brought by his parents from the
Mother State to Ipswich (then Lime-
stone) when he was about a year
old. When his father, the late Dr.
Glissan, decided to remove to Dray-
ton the family journeyed to Too-
woomba (then known as the Swamp)
by Flagstone Creek, travelling over
the spurs leading to the top of the
range where many convicts were
employed in road making. The road
by the present Toll Bar did not then
exist. Leaving school at the age of
fourteen, Mr. A. H. Glissan was
sent to “Jondaryan” Station, where
he learned many details of pastoral
work under Mr. J. C. White, gen-
eral manager for Mr. Robert Tooth
of Sydney, and this being before the
day of the telegraph, did a good deal
of courier work between several of
Mr. Tooth’s stations. When Mr.
White and family left “Jondaryan”
he journeyed with them to “Wid-
gee,” where he spent a few years
gaining excellent experience among
cattle and horses. During this period
he often accompanied Mr. White to
Yengarie, where the mill was then
of this property, which is named
“Baneda,” and added considerably
to its improvements. Subsequently
he and his partner enlarged their
interests by the selection and stocking

the old settlers that are left and re-

that marked the early development

“Widgee” lie went to “Wombo,”
then owned by Mr. J. C. Mayne, to
take charge of the cattle there, and
from “Wombo” took a post at

“Halleford,” whence he was ap-
pointed as manager of “Tallwood”
on behalf of Mr. P. Clynes, of “War
War” Station. Subsequently he
joined his brother George in taking
contracts for the mustering of scrub
cattle at Chinchilla, and succeeded
in getting together about 2,000 head,
which with the exception of some
800 which succumbed to pleuro-
pneumonia—then prevalent for the
first time on the Downs—he sold to
James Glass for 17s. 6d. per head.
In the late seventies he took over
the management of “Rockwood,” on
the Landsborough, at that time the
Property Co., owners of “Rock-
lands” Station, Camooweal, Barclay
Tablelands, and entered upon the
management of the area in Septem-
ber, 1884. “Rocklands” embraces
about 3,000 square miles of country
situated at the head of Georgina

“Greenfields” to his son-in-law, Mr.
David Ross, on his retirement from
son of the late John Bates, who,
hailing from England, was one of
the very earliest of the free settlers
to arrive in the Mother State, where
he followed agrarian pursuits. Mr.
Thomas Bates was educated privately
under the paternal rooftree, con-
cluding his studies as soon as he was
of an age to be of assistance on the
home farm. He remained a few
years helping his father, later strik-

engaged in general farm work in
New South Wales. While still in
his teens, however, the call of the
vast spaces of the Queen colony
reached him, and resulted in his
journeying as far north as Gladstone.
After spending some time in the
district outlying that town, during
which he was able to purchase a
team of horses and other outfit of a
carrier, he proceeded in that capacity
to the infant township on the
Barcoo, then known as Whitown (so
named after the station formed by
Messrs. W. & J. Whitman), arriving
at the end of his long journey in
the year 1861. He continued carry-
ing in the Barcoo district for some
years, and eventually, in the late
eighties, became engaged in the
retail butchering trade, the township
meanwhile having considerably ex-
panded in size and population. For
more than a quarter of a century

give mute testimony to the prestige

period of their existence, and it was
an open secret even then that practi-
cally all credit was due to Mr. John
Bignell, who owing to his uncle’s
indifferent health took upon himself
almost the whole responsibility of
the stud management. As a. breeder
and studmaster he became widely
known, and his opinion was held
in high esteem by the pastoral com-

as a pioneer of the best sort he will
long be remembered by many of the
descendants of the fine old stockman
of the period. The partnership
between the Messrs. Bignell con-
tinued until the gentleman under

account about 40,000 acres of
the old “Widgeegoara” resumption

There are wide stretches of open
Mitchell and bluegrass plains, and
numerous other varieties of native
grasses, including barley grass, flour-
ish freely, whilst in proper season
among the herbage pre-eminently
is found the crowfoot, which
is of such immense value for
stock. About 200 miles of modern
fencing have been erected by Mr.
Bignell, the runs being subdivided
into larger and smaller paddocks;
and great attention has been given
to the matter of securing a copious
water supply by drawing on the
sub-artesian resources of the place.
Mr. Bignell enjoys the honour of
having been the very first to employ
this means of settling the water
difficulty in the district, and for the
purpose he imported a diamond
drill from America at a cost of
.£2,000. The first bore he put down
was only a partial success, owing to
the mechanic employed for the work
losing his head with excitement
when water was struck and so
mishandling the machinery that
permanent damage was done to the
bore and pipes. Despite this mis-
fortune the flow was sufficient to
water 19,000 sheep, and meanwhile
the sinking was being proceeded with
in other localities. In all five bores
were sunk by Mr. Bignell, and of
these two were highly successful, the
water from them, though slightly
brackish, being very suitable for
stock. The other three had to be
abandoned on account of the strong
deposits of a salty nature contained
in the water. From one of the bores
issues a flow of over 1,250,000
gallons daily, supplying 60 miles of
well-made and well-kept drains ; and
since the introduction of the diamond
drill with its marvellous results Mr.
Bignell never has had to move his
stock on account of lack of water.
His example has also proved of the


greatest possible benefit to the
neighbourhood, and although the
machinery of that period is now
obsolete, .the experiments of later
years have led to the use of more
up-to-date plant, which has brought
prosperity to many a struggling pas-
toralist. The carrying capacity of
“Widgeegoara” and “Avondale” is
estimated at about 25,000 sheep,
It is generally conceded that
Mr. Bignell owns the best-bred flock
of merinos on Widgeegoara Creek—
which for a part of its course runs
through the property —and the
fact that he has bred up from
types obtained from the far-famed
“Boonoke” and “Willandra” studs
at the outset of his enterprise is
sufficient explanation of the splendid
results achieved. During the pre-
sent season the sheep bred on the
station yielded an average weight of
WOOL WAITING FOR A TEAM.
12 lb. 10 oz. of wool of excellent
staple and quality, which at the
markets commanded well over the
ordinary prices for fleeces in the
grease. Although sheep have re-
placed cattle to a great extent on
these runs, a herd is still grazed on
the pastures of “Avondale,” which
continues to enjoy a reputation for
the same first-class quality as that
which distinguished the cattle of an
earlier era, though the numbers
have been very considerably dim-
inished since that time. Mr. Bignell,
who has won his way to prosperity
and success through many setbacks,
large among which loom those caused
by the drought, has now reached
the autumn of his days, and, cheered
by the companionship of a good wife
and family of sons and daughters,
enjoys a well-earned rest from the
toil and responsibilities of former
days. He married on July 12, 1881,

she applied herself to the tasks of

friends and acquaintances, by whom
he was held in the highest esteem.
The subject of our review, Mr. Frank
Pender Phillott, received his early
schooling from his mother, for the
overseer on “Charlotte Plains,” but
in 1890, after three years in that
position, he took up land on his own
account, purchasing a block of
12,000 acres, an area which is now
as they came into the market. A
large area of “Cockerina” (which was
subsequently given over to his sons)
and an area in Bulloo River District,
80 miles from Thargomindah, form
educational facilities in the country
districts of New South Wales during
the sixties were almost non-existent.
Later he was sent to the public
school at Wellington, New South
Wales, but owing to the serious
reverses in the family fortunes he
had to commence to earn his own
living when but ten years of age.
His first position was on “Warraner”
Station, near Coonamble, of which
property his father was manager,
and subsequently the work of
droving attracted him. When barely
15 years of age he constituted a
record of overlanding a large mob of
sheep to Sydney. A couple of years
later his droving duties took him to
Queensland, and seeing the wonder-
ful possibilities of the Queen State,
he decided to try his fortunes in this
“land of promise.” His first position
was on a station property belonging
to the late C. B. Fisher, and after
acting as an overseer there for three
years, Mr. Phillott subsequently was
associated with the trio of well-known
pastoralists—the late Hon. James
Tyson, and Messrs. Woolsley and
Langlo Parker, by whom he was
commissioned to take up station
areas in the Northern Territory. A
severe drought, however, interfered
with the plans, and Mr. Phillott was
compelled to overland his stock back
to Queensland, the owners compli-
menting him heartily on the small
percentage of losses sustained on the
long journey, which lasted for 18
months. lie next became head

included in his present holding. He
devoted the property to sheep-rais-
ing, but after five years of hard
work he realized that his efforts
would result in complete failure
unless he could obtain a better water
supply on his property. Therefore,
at a cost of over £2,000, he had
an artesian bore sunk, and this made
his interests safe and sound in the
event of a drought setting in. A
commodious and up-to-date residence
was next erected, and then the
plucky squatter steadily set to work
to pay off the big mortgage with
which the property was encumbered.
In passing, it may be mentioned that
Mr. Phillott personally carted all
the timber of which his home is
built, and also superintended the
construction of the homestead. By
dint of industry and thrift Mr.
Phillott has been enabled to add to
his original holding, from time to
time purchasing surrounding blocks

part of his more recent land pur-
chases, and the value of the last-
mentioned property has been con-
siderably enhanced by the sinking
of an artesian bore at a cost of
£3,400. Altogether the land now
owned by the Phillott family covers
about 170,000 acres of grazing
country, most of which is devoted to
cattle-raising. Mr. Phillott was
married in 1885 to Margaret Celia,
daughter of the late Richard Jack-
son, a well-known storekeeper of the
old gold-mining days at Temora,
New South Wales. Mrs. Phillott
has proved a worthy helpmeet to her

subsequently followed the mining

unsuccessful in this calling he
abandoned it after a period of five
years, and turning his attention to

owned by the late FI. W. Walsh, the
father of the gentleman who, at

ent day “Burenda” run. From
there they resumed a westerly
course, crossing the Warrego and
proceeding through the scrub which
divides it from the Nive. One of
the party, Mr. Missing, finding his
course so impeded in this scrub by
the closely growing vegetation,
remarked, “This is the ‘dead
finish,’ ” an incident which gave to
the plant its present name. They
more hit upon Mr. Walker’s track.
They now followed his course to the
head of Surprise Creek, which the
party discovered later to be a branch
of the Barcoo, and having safely
traced him to this point on his home-
ward journey they proceeded down
the Ward River for some distance.
At about this stage of their journey
they encountered the first blacks yet
seen in their travels, Mr. Allan
having described the incident in an
account of the expedition—written
some time before his death— as
follows: “They were stringing out
of the scrub at the other end of the
plain . . . and getting sight
of us stopped for a moment, then
stretched their legs to get first
across the plain. The chief returned
to the edge of the timber, just
reached by them, well armed after
the manner of his race, to interview
our leader in front as the immediate
representative of visitors to his
country. His manner implied a
determination to challenge our right
to be in his country. Our repre-
sentative gave his ear in silence to
the strange sounds of the chief’s
eloquence, and kept a sly hand on
his revolver, an action suggested
by the warrior’s antics, and in
expectation of a further development

humour concluded the interview
after a little exchange of trifles.”
The party then proceeded in a
westerly direction, eventually arriving
of the positions of the mountains,
creeks, and scrubs, to enable us to
construct a map.” And from the
latter part of the same account:
"The work done was traced into our

and Wills on behalf of the Victorian
Government. They sold four of
their erstwhile outlaws, tamed by
their three months of hard work, to
at a stream running south and
parallel to the Ward, which they
named Elizabeth Creek —the lower
end of which was subsequently re-
named the Langlo—where lots were
drawn for the country picked upon,
“Burenda” and the Nive and Ward
country below Mr. Walker’s claim
falling to Messrs. Missing and de
Satge, the Langlo to Mr. Davis, and
Elizabeth Creek to Mr. Allan. At
this stage the two former gentle-
men returned homewards, and
Messrs. Allan and Davis travelled
due north from their camp at
Elizabeth Creek, later discovering
the great Barcoo (though the river’s
name was then unknown to them)
and the vast pastoral lands forming
its watershed, which included
“Mount Enniskillen,” “Northamp-
ton Downs,” and “Greendale.
Eventually they reached “Douglas
Ponds,” already named by Sir
Thomas Mitchell, from whence, after
reconnoitering the country there-
abouts, they proceeded in an
easterly direction towards home,
their course later changing to the
south in order to strike the river
again, which they followed to the
present site of ‘‘Mount Enniskillen’
Station. We quote again from the
late gentleman’s written description
of the earlier part of the expedition ;

striking resemblance to Sir Thomas

placed side by side, and all

by Sir Thomas were seen re-
produced in ours. The question,
“Where were we?” was answered.
The Victoria was an earlier name
for the Barcoo. Calling at “Albinia

they met Mr. Frederick Walker's

lack of funds to carry it on.
“Vergemont” and “Evesham” were
also owned by Mr. Allan, his entire
area covering at one time 1,800
square miles. In 1862 Mr. Allan
entered into partnership with the
late T. S. Mort and the first Sir

“Home Creek (which has since been
included in “Barcaldine Downs”),
being then included in the proprie-
tary, both these estates being after-
wards sold to the Messrs. Fairbairn.
That partnership also lasted for
seven years, at the end of which
period the remaining properties were
resumed and auctioned, Mr. Allan
securing “Mount Enniskillen” and
“Birkhead,” and holding* these two
properties with “Windyear” and
“Maryvale” until the sale of the
latter run in the year 1902 to the
owners of “Saltern Creek.” His
remaining stations were sold to
Messrs Clark and Tait in 1909, when
the late gentleman retired from
active life and took up his residence
at Sydney. “Mount Enniskillen”
was originally stocked with cattle,
these being replaced with sheep
under the ownership of the firm
already mentioned, and later, on the
dissolution of the partnership, the
property was conducted by the late
Mr. Allan as a cattle proposition
only until his retirement to Sydney
in 1909, after a half-century spent
on that estate. He married a
daughter of Mr. Conolly, who with
his two sons and three daughters
survives him. Of the latter one is
now Mrs. J. J. Dalhunty, Illabo,
New South Wales. The late Mr.
J. T. Allan’s death occurred at
Sydney in the year 1912. His life’s
work tells in its own way of the

Wales, on April 26, 1874, and is the
second son of the late J. T. Allan.
He received his earlier education
through private tuition at “Mount
Enniskillen,” his father’s estate,
finishing his scholastic course at the
Sydney Grammar School. On
attaining his seventeenth year he
returned to “Mount Enniskillen”
and became engaged in general
station work under his father’s
direction, and continued to assist in
the working of that estate for the
following fourteen years. In the
year 1905 he went to the Northern
Territory, where he became engaged
in droving, travelling a mob of
cattle from “Wave Hill” and
“Victoria River” to- “Burrendilla,”

advancement of the district. He
married in 1910 Alicia Annie

Henry Rose, a descendant of an old
Scottish family whose forbears had
long been established in Ross-shire.
The late gentleman arrived in

ALLAN, “Thrungli,” the eldest son
of the late pioneer, was born at
“Mount Enniskillen” and educated
by tutors beneath the parental roof-
tree, later completing his scholastic
career at the Sydney Grammar
School. On the conclusion of his
academic course he returned to
“Mount Enniskillen,” where under
his father’s supervision he became
thoroughly conversant with the
many-sided aspects of the grazing
industry. He remained on “Mount
Enniskillen,” assisting in the work-
ing of that station until the year
1907, when he proceeded to “Erne,”
being thenceforward occupied with
its administration in conjunction
with his brother until the year 1913,
when the estate was divided, Mr.
G. R. Allan taking the southern
near Charleville. In 1907 the late
Mr. Allan transferred a block of
40,000 acres from his “Maryvale”
estate (which had originally formed
part of “Mount Enniskillen”) to his
two sons, James Macfarlane and
George Richard, the former assum-
ing the administration of the pro-
perty. It was named “Erne” and
conducted in partnership by the
brothers until 1913, when on the
occasion of the marriage of Mr. G.
R. Allan a dissolution took place
and the property was divided, Mr.
J. M. Allan retaining the portion
surrounding the original homestead,
which he has since carried on as a
sheep proposition. “Erne” is situ-

and became engaged in pastoral
pursuits, spending several years as
overseer on “Greendale” Station, in
the Barcoo district. Later, in 1872,
he became engaged in the sugar-
growing industry, with which he was
prominently identified for many
years through his personal interests
in the business and later in his
capacity of manager of plantations
at Port Mackay and Yeppoon. In
the year 1889 he was appointed to
the water police, Brisbane, of which
he later became sub-inspector, re-
tiring from that body in the year
1904. The late Mr. Ross was
connected by blood with one of
England’s Prime Ministers, the
famous William Ewart Gladstone,

is also a member of the Blackall
Club. He married in 1913 Mary,
only surviving daughter of the late
Edward Palmer, who was a native of
“Woollongong,” New South Wales,
and a member of a well-known Irish
family, his father having hailed
from the Green Isle, where his for-
bears had been established for
generations. Mr. Edward Palmer’s
connection with the pastoral industry
in Queensland is historical and dates
back to the year 1861. He is the
author of a work entitled “Early
Days in North Queensland,” which
throws much light on the conditions
of early settlement.


“THUR AGGIE,” the property
of Mr. William Edward Walmsley,
J.P. This estate, which came into
possession of the present owner in
MR. JOHN WALMSLEY.
1896, was purchased by him from
Mr. J. C. Henderson, about 20,000
acres being then comprised within
its boundaries. Subsequently con-
siderable additions were made to his
landed estate by Mr. Walmsley, who
MR. E. H. WALMSLEY.
selected another 40,000 acres, and
purchased several blocks, comprising
from 10,000 to 12,000 acres in the
same locality. At a still later period,
in conjunction with his sons, he
acquired 24,000 acres at Galonga, as
well as an adjacent property of
12.000 acres, known as “Maronga.”
Since that period the whole of the
properties have been conducted as a
joint family concern between father
and sons, under the general direc-
tion of the senior members of the
firm. “Thuraggie” is situated about
12 miles distant from the town of
St. George, and takes its name from
a large lagoon, noted for its perma-
nent waters, upon the banks of
which the station homestead stands.
The country consists principally of
open plains, well clothed with
natural blue grass, and varied by
belts of belar and coolibah timber,
which do well on the mixed black
and chocolate soils. A good water
supply is ensured by a double front-
age of over 4 miles to Thuraggie
Lagoon, above referred to, and
some 6J miles frontage to the Moonie
River, together with several wells
and an artesian bore, which yields
about a million gallons per day, its
flow being distributed over 20 miles
of drains. There are also some
scientifically-constructed excavation
tanks, which complete the water
supply arrangements on what is
generally acknowledged to be one of
the best-improved properties in
Southern Queensland. The fencing
on the estate is of a very substantial
character, the boundary being en-
closed by a double netting, marsu-
pial and rabbit-proof fence, and the
subdivisions with six wires and
rabbit-proof netting, all the posts
being made of timber cut from the
forest-belts on the property. An
area of 75,000 acres surrounding
“Thuraggie” homestead has been
divided into over 40 paddocks, and
extensive ringbarking operations
have transformed the country into
splendid open pastures, which, with
their excellent permanent water,
provide ideal conditions for stock-
grazing. Among the most notice-
able of the improvements on the
estate are the up-to-date woolshed and
drafting yards, and the sheep dip,
which not only equal, but easily sur-
pass, most of the structures of a like
character in the south of Queens-
land. The shearing shed is fitted
with 12 Wolseley machines, the
motive power for which is supplied
by a 6 h.p. steam engine, and among
other advantages storeage for 400
bales of wool has been provided,
whilst water is laid on to the shed
and all the drafting yards from
tanks having a holding capacity of
21.000 galls. The present homestead
(a commodious building) was erected
in the year 1911 to take the
place of the original dwelling-house,
which had done good service for

lofty rooms in the main building,
where ventilation has been made a
primary consideration, and wide
verandahs encircling the whole of
the structure ensure coolness during

the heat of summer. The general
appointments of the out-houses
and cottages are in keeping
with the progressive spirit which is
plainly manifest throughout all
departments of the station activities
and general arrangements. “Thur-
aggie” is carried on as a mixed stock
proposition, sheep occupying pride
of place in the combined enterprise,
though the station has already
established a reputation for its
highly-bred blood horses, and carries
a mob of shorthorn cattle of consid-
erable dimensions. In ordinary sea-
sons the flock, which is composed
exclusively of merinoes, numbers
from 25,000 to 30,000, and a high
standard of type is maintained by
frequent infusions of new blood from
noted South Australian studs, the
Murray strain having been found to
acclimatize well in the semi-tropical
latitudes of Southern Queensland.
From 1,200 to 1,300 head of cattle
are depastured on “Thuraggie,” and
expert care has been devoted to
building up pure shorthorn type;
whilst among the equine stock may
be noticed the unmistakable quali-
ties transmitted to their offspring by
imported sires of unimpeachable
breeding. Mr. Walmsley and his
sons are all lovers of a good horse,
and spare no pains nor trouble to
attain their object of producing
animals which shall do them credit
among their fellow-pastoralists in
the district. Mr. William Edward
Walmsley was born in the Hawkes-
bury River district of New South
Wales on April 12, 1855, his native
place being Portland Head, near
Windsor. He is a son of the late
John Walmsley, who came from
County Fermanagh, Ireland (where
the family had been settled for
generations, and where they still
flourish), to Australia with his
father, the late Edward Walmsley,
in the early forties. The last-men-
tioned gentleman settled with his
wife and young family on the
Hawkesbury River, where he be-

his prosperity, he retired to private
life at Camperdown, near Sydney,
where his death occurred at the ripe
age of 104 years, after a long and
useful life in the land of his adop-
tion. Plis second son, John Walms-
ley, at the time of his arrival in
New South Wales, was in his middle
teens, and having completed his
education before leaving the Old
Country, was ready to turn at once
to the business of making a liveli-
hood. His earliest work was in con-
nection with the carrying industry,
in the romantic days of early settle-
ment in the Colony, but subse-
quently in 1856 he became the
owner by purchase of two properties
on the Hunter River, near Millfield,
known as “Rose Hill” and “Glen-
myre,” which are still in possession
of members of the Walmsley family.
Here he resided until the time of
his demise in 1893, at which date

memoir, took over the properties, in
the administration of which he had
given his father considerable assist-
ance at an earlier date. The late
John Walmsley, however, with an
eye to the future of his son, in 1861,
when Mr. W. E. Walmsley was a
child of only six years of age, had
taken up in the boy’s name, under
the Free Selection Act of the late
Sir John Robertson, a block of
country adjoining “Rose Hill,” and
it is interesting to note something of
a record has been established in re-
gard to this property, which up to
the year 1917 continued to be held
in the name of William Edward
Walmsley. The gentleman under
review was associated with his father
in the working of the New South
Wales properties until he was about
25 years of age, when, prompted by
the spirit of adventure, and a con-
viction of the possibilities of Vvider
scope, he turned his steps to other
portions of the vast areas of the
country of his birth. In 1883 he
became a selector on the resumed

this property he soon added other
interests, becoming a shareholder in
“Tareelroi” Station and other sub-
divisions of the old “Welbon”
property. He personally administered
his pastoral interests in the Moree
district until 1896, when he disposed
of them and came to Queensland,
where he purchased “Thuraggie.”
Mr. Walmsley always has been
distinguished for the keen in-
terest he has taken in the
public affairs of the districts
wherein his properties have been
situated. In New South Wales he
was for some time a member of the
Stock and Pasture Board of that
State, and upon his advent to
Queensland he very soon began to
display an equally active concern
in the advancement of the common
weal in the neighbourhood of St.
George. He has been a member of
the Balonne Shire Council since
1906, and for two terms presided
over the deliberations of that body,
besides which he is a member of the
local Marsupial Board. He is also
vice-president of the Balonne
Pastoral and Agricultural Association
and of the St. George Hospital com-
mittee. Mr. Walmsley has also been
president of the St. George Picnic

the late John Dodds, of Alnwick,
Northumberland, England, a mem-
ber of one of the old yeoman
families of that County, who arrived
in Australia in the year 1850. The
late Mr. Dodds spent over a quarter
of a century in the land of his adop-
tion, and during the latter years of
his life resided near Sydney. He
was survived by a family of four
sons and five daughters. On the
maternal side, Mrs. Walmsley’s
family connection possesses records
dating back to the time of the
Huguenots, when the name of her
ancestors (the well-known name of
Blunt) figured conspicuously in the
tragic story of the refugees in the
seventeenth century; whilst other
branches of her family were con-
nected with the merchant service in
the early part of the nineteenth
century. Of the union—of William
Edward Walmsley and Jessie Dar-
ling Dodds—five sons and two
daughters survive, and of these the
eldest, Arthur Charles, was born
at Moree, New South Wales, in
1894. He was educated under
private tutorship in his paternal
home, and subsequently became
associated with his father in pastoral
pursuits in Queensland. He has
already made his name in Australian
sporting circles, being one of the
best-known amateur riders in
Queensland. After the outbreak of
war between Britain and Germany,
he resigned a career full of promise,
and responding to the call of duty,
offered himself for active service
abroad. He participated in the
Great European War (1914-18).
Joining the Australian Imperial
Forces on June 1, 1916, he em-
barked for the Western Front on
September 6 of the same year as a
member of the 6th Reinforcements,
52nd Battalion, and was transferred
to the 47th Batallion on the field.
He was wounded during operations
at Paschendaele, having previously
been in action at Bullecourt and
Polygon Wood. As a result of his
wound, caused by a bullet passing
through his neck, he was sent to the
Shorncliffe Military Hospital, in
Kent, where he remained for ten
weeks. On March 1, 1918, he re-
turned to France, where he joined
his original battalion, in the same
month taking part in the memorable
Dernancourt "stunt,” in the stem-
ming of the German advance, on
March 19, 1918, his battalion
being practically annihilated. The
remnant was captured by the
Germans on April 5, 1918, and he,
with his comrades, experienced the
enemy’s methods of treating their
prisoners, being forced to work on
the railways behind the lines and on
the canal barges. He was at Namur,
in Belgium, at the signing of the
Armistice, and two days after that
notable event he and his companions
made their way, chiefly on foot, to
Cambria, the journey taking them
fourteen days. On arrival they were
taken charge of by the British
authorities, who sent them to
Dover. After remaining three
months in England, Mr. A. C.
Walmsley embarked on the trans-
port "Nevasa” for Australia,
arriving in Brisbane on Anzac Day,
April 25, 1919. The fourth son,
Valentine Gwydir, is also strongly
embued with patriotic motives, and
on two occasions he presented him-
self as a candidate for the A.1.F.,
but was rejected on the score of his
being medically unfit. The youngest
son likewise aspired to serve his
country in her time of need, but his
parents withheld their consent, as
they considered him altogther too
youthful for such a task. The re-
maining two sons, Leonard George
and Ernest Henry, who reside re-
spectively at "West Haran,” on the
Moonie River, and "Maronga,”
both assist in the administration of
the home properties. The lastnamed,
like his brother, Arthur, is a leading
amateur rider, on various occasions
having carried off the trophy
awarded to the rider scoring most
wins at the St. George and Surat
Picnic Club meetings, and not in-
frequently he has been successful in
the principal racing events at Too-
woomba, Mungindi, and Moree.
Nearly all of the brothers are en-
thusiastic polo players, and partici-
pated in many matches.

subsequently sold at 2s. 6d. per acre,
the price paid for this property by
the late Mr. Sealy was at the rate
of £1 per acre. His farm, which was
named “Oakey Camp,” was situated


in the vicinity of Harrisville, and
was worked in conjunction with
“Surnmerlands,” where the old
pioneer made his home, until the
occurrence of his death in his
seventy-ninth year, at the end of a
half a century spent in the young
Colony. During his career in his
adopted country he battled bravely
with the excessive hardships inci-
dental to the life of a settler on
new lands, and in the varying
vicissitudes of his calling was upheld
by the unfailing encouragement and
whole-hearted support of a helpmeet
who, by her devotion and self-
sacrifice, provided an example of
wifehood and motherhood which was
regarded as well worthy of emulation
by the younger women with whom
she was associated. Mrs. Sealy came
of good old English stock, her birth-
place being Jersey, one of the
Channel Islands. The family of this
worthy couple consisted of four sons
and two daughters, the second of
whom, as already stated, is the sub-
ject of our memoir. Owing to the
almost complete lack of educational
facilities in those early days of the
history of the Colony, the book-lore
accorded him was limited to the few
opportunities then existing. For a
brief period he attended private
schools at Ipswich and Harrisville,
and subsequently had the benefit of
private tuition; but the most im-
portant part of his education was
self-acquired on his attainment to
man’s estate. In his late teens he
struck out for himself, leaving the
paternal rooftree in order to take
over the duties of second drover in
charge of a flock of 13,000 ewes
travelling on the road from “Jon-
daryan” and “Bon Accord” to
“Terrick-Terrick,” near Blackall,
which was owned by Rome Brothers,
having previously rendered material
assistance to his father in the work-
ing cf the home acres. His next
position was as a jackaroo on
"Terrick-Terrick,” where he re-
mained for five years, being promoted
to the overseership of the station
during that time. Subsequently he
gained further valuable experience
as a drover, continuing on the roads
for some years, and later filled the
posts of overseer at “Evesham” and
“Albilbah.” In the year 1885 he
secured the management of “Rod-
ney Downs” Station on behalf of
the late Thomas McWhannel, and
for the following five years was occu-
pied with the conduct of this estate.
The managership of “Barcaldine
Downs” becoming vacant in the year
1890, the then owners, Messrs.
George Fairbairn & Sons, offered
him the reins of control of this
important station, to the successful
conduct of which he has since
devoted himself, retaining his post
under the present owners, Messrs.
Clark & Tait, who, on their purchase
of the property in the year 1914,
requested him to continue its
administration. In the meantime,
in 1906, he embarked in pastoral
enterprise on his own account,
acquiring “Kyneton,” his eldest son
having selected adjoining country.
The two properties were amalgam-
ated, and are now worked con-
jointly with another estate —
“Mulgrave”—which was purchased
by the family at a later date. The
combined area of “Kyneton” and
“Mulgrave” covers some 80,000
acres, which are situated in the
vicinity of Barcaldine, and devoted
to sheejD and cattle, both proposi-
tions being worked under the man-
agement of his eldest son, Mr. Eric
Mitchell Sealy. The runs are very
well developed, important features
in the improvements being two
artesian bores, which provide the
stock with excellent water, and the
boundary and subdivisional fencing.

progress and development. Since
the inception of the Barcaldine Shire
Council he has been a member of
that body, having on different occa-
sions occupied the office of chairman.
He has been president of the
Hospital for a number of years, and
is chairman of the Barcaldine Dis-

According his support to racing, he
has served many terms as chairman

He is a member of the Barcaldine,

He married in the year 1890 Agnes
Jamieson, daughter of the late
David Mitchell, who hailed from
Scotland, where his forbears had
been long established. The late
gentleman was a pioneer of New
South Wales, and many of his
descendants now people that State,

Grammar Schools, and now manages
the family estates; the second, Henry
John, while yet in his teens, having
donned the khaki when men were
needed to fight for the Motherland
in the cause of justice and honour.
He served with distinction for over
three years of the Great War as a
member of the 49th Battalion, and
was twice wounded in action, the
first occasion being in 1916 at
Mouquet Farm, in France, and the
second at Arras, where his division
made glorious history for the Aus-
tralian army. He was educated at
the Rockhampton Grammar School
and King’s School, Parramatta, New
South Wales. At both these institu-
tions his name is recorded on the
honour boards. The youngest son,
Clive Charles, is also a King’s School
boy, and at time of writing is
carrying out the duties of jackaroo
at “Barcaldine Downs.”


THOMAS DOWNEY, “Fairhill,”
Longreach, was born in the parish
of Fairhill, in the City of Cork,
Ireland, in the year 1866, and is a
son of the late John Downey, a
retail merchant in Cork City, whose
forbears were engaged in commer-
cial pursuits in the historical old
southern capital for many gener-
ations. The name is well known in
County Cork, and, indeed, through-
out Munster, the Downey family
being renowned for straight trading,
and thus typifying the proverbial
integrity of the business people in
the South of Ireland, between whom
contracts are unknown. The subject
of this memoir, who was one of a
family of six sons, received his edu-
cation at the National School in
Cork, and on the conclusion of his
scholastic career was apprenticed to
the carpentering trade, completing
his training in that avocation when
in his late teens. In the year 1885,
realizing that his native land lacked
the possibilities open to men of
enterprise in younger and less popu-
lous countries, he bade farewell to
his kith and kin and departed to
seek his fortunes in Australia. He
landed in Melbourne, and shortly
afterwards obtained work in the
country, following agrarian pursuits
for a short period. Subsequently,
on the opportunity presenting itself,
MR. THOMES DOWNEY.
he became engaged in the craft
which he had learned in Ire-
land, spending about four years
as a contract builder in various
parts of Victoria, though principally
in the Western District. Being
dissatisfied with his progress in that
State, he decided to try his chances
in Queensland, arriving in the year
1892, and proceeding to Longreach,
where he continued in the same call-
ing in that town and in the
surrounding district, becoming one
of the best-known contractors of the
period. Among the buildings which
stand to his credit are those of the
Longreach Wool Scour and Meat
Works, several of the leading busi-
ness houses and stores, and many of
the up-to-date pastoral homes of the
district. Eventually, in the year
1896, he found himself in a position
to enter the pastoral industry, and
as a result selected a block of country
on the “Mount Cornish’’ run,
naming his property “Fairhill,” and
thenceforward applying himself dili-
gently to its improvement, so that
to-day it is one of the best-developed
areas of its size in the west. “Fair-
hill” is situated 14 miles west of
Longreach, and though not a large
estate as grazing properties are
regarded in this part of Queensland,
is highly suitable for pasturage, the
chocolate soil producing an abund-
ance of Mitchell, blue, and other
natural grasses, and a plentiful
supply of herbage in the winter
time, the nature of the run being
indicated by rolling downs, lightly
timbered with boree, gidya, and
other edible growths, which afford
good shelter for the stock. As many
as 9,500 sheep have browsed over its
acres, but to avert any danger of
overstocking, this number has been
considerably reduced. The flock was
founded on “Bimbah” ewes, the
rams, which were secured from
“Tara” Station, originally being
brought from New South Wales by
the Cudmore family. On Mr.
Downey’s advent to this property it
was destitute of water, the necessary
supply for domestic purposes having
to be carted from the most con-
venient centre during the first days
of his occupancy. At time of
writing there are two good tanks
"FAIRHILL” HOMESTEAD.
and an overshot dam of so permanent
a nature that his stock have been
well provided for since his initial
operations in this direction. The
homestead, which was erected by the
present owner, is a small though
comfortable dwelling, having been
constructed with due regard to the
climatic conditions prevailing in the
west. It is connected with Long-
reach by telephone. Mr. Downey
has been twice married, the first
occasion being in Victoria in the
year 1891, when he espoused a
daughter of the late George Coxon,
formerly of Newcastle-on-Tyne, Eng-
land, the lady’s death occurring in
the year 1894. After a period of
over four years he re-married, tbe
present Mrs. Downey being Mary,
daughter of the late Roger Kelly,
of Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ire-
land, and a descendant of a long line
of Irish forbears, who followed
agrarian avocations in that county.
The origin of the family is lost in
antiquity, even tradition, older than
history, failing to reveal the date of
its foundation, though the name is
frequently found in Irish history
and legendary lore. Of the union
there is one daughter, Mary. Mr.
Downey has twice voyaged to his
native land, on the second occasion
including America in his itinerary,
and he found much to interest him
during both periods of absence from
Australia.
ALEXANDER HOWATSON,
J.P., “Glenbuck,” Dartmouth, was
born on September 7, 1878, and is
the second son of the late James
Howatson, a native of Potstown,


Dumfrieshire, Scotland. The late
gentleman was a son of George
Howatson and his wife, nee Jean
Calvert, and a descendant of a long
line of farmers who had been settled

in the Lowlands of Scotland for
centuries past. He arrived in
Australia in the year 1853, and
immediately engaged in pastoral
pursuits, later becoming widely
known as a station-owner both in
Victoria and New South Wales.
His first employment was in the
capacity of jackaroo on a property

belonging to his uncle, the late Mr.
John Calvert, who was one of the
pioneer pastoralists of the Western
District of Victoria. Subsequently
he was interested in several grazing
DD
ventures with men whose names, like
his own, are indelibly associated
with the pioneering of the pastoral
industry and the consequent progress
of the Garden State, notably the
Bells, Calverts, Armstrongs, Ilowat-
sons, and Strachans. He also owned,
in conjunction with his brother, the
late Lewis Howatson, the well-known
“Boondara” and “Tarawonga”
Stations in the Hillston District,
and “Wangamana” Station, in the
Bourke District, New South Wales,
and was part owner of “Alma”
Station, on the Lachlan River, in
the same State, his associates in the
latter proposition having been Lewis
Bell and the late Alexander
Armstrong. The founder of the
Australian branch of the Howatson
family, which is now represented at
“Glenbuck,” was a man of great
foresight, who, realizing to the full
the future possibilities of the great
pastoral industry in the vast though
yet unoccupied areas of the con-
tinent, used his sure knowledge of
that industry to the best advantage.
In the early eighties he enlarged his
landed interests by the acquirement
of “Mount Derrimut,” the historic
home of the celebrated Derrimut
cattle, and there led a partially
retired life until he “crossed the
bourne” in the year 1897. During
his long pastoral career he devoted
much of his time to local
government, having filled the presi-
dential chair of the Braybrook Shire
Council for a period. At his decease
he was sadly missed by the many
old friends who had found in him
that quality which is not made of
“wine and dreams,” but “of the
tough fibre of the human heart.”
He left a family of three sons —
George, Alexander, and John Bell
Howatson, and one daughter. Mr.
George Howatson, the eldest, was
educated at Geelong College, and
subsequently entered the University
of Sydney, where he studied for the
profession of a mining engineer, tak-
ing his degree in 1907. On the out-
break of the war he obtained a
commission in the Royal Engineers,
Imperial Army, and served with
distinction throughout the great
struggle, being awarded the D.S.O.
The youngest of the three brothers,
Mr. John Bell Howatson, was edu-
cated at Merchiston Castle School,
Edinburgh, completing his studies
at the Hamilton College, Victoria.
For some considerable time he was
associated with his eldest brother
in the ownership of “Glenbuck,”
eventually severing his connection in
order to enter into possession of

the vicinity of Arrilalah. When the

and was on active service as an air
mechanic in France for three years.

In 1910 he took up his residence on
the newly-acquired area and entered


on the personal administration of
the estates, which he has continued
ever since. The partnership between
the two brothers continued until
1913, when Mr. J. B. Howatson
disposed of his interest to the
gentleman under review. The two
blocks comprising “Glenbuck” were
previously separate estates known
respectively as “Irvingdale” and
“Griffdale,” the territory originally
having been part of “Wellshot”
Station. Both blocks were taken up
by the former owners in the year
1890, when part of that station was
resumed by the Government and
subdivided for purposes of closer
settlement. On entering into possess-
ion Mr. Howatson consolidated the
Bai’caldiue and Longreach, the
homestead being about a mile
distant from Dartmouth, which is
the nearest centre of railway com-
munication, and occupies a site on
the property. Improvements have
been effected since the advent
of the present owner, particularly in
regard to fencing and water conser-
vation. There are two artesian
bores on the estate, and in
addition three dams, the out-
put thus provided being fully
adequate to the needs of the stock
which graze on the well-grassed acres
of sheltered downs. About 18,000
sheep are usually put to the shears,
and the reputation already acheived
for the wool grown on “Glenbuck”

need be said of the stamp of animals
bred at “Glenbuck.” Mr. Howatson
is interested in sport for sport’s sake,
and follows horseracing as a pastime.
He has captured numerous races
with horses of his own breeding, and
in this connection special mention
should be made of “Cornsocks”
(winner of the Central Queensland
Derby of 1913) and “Nic of Time”
(winner of the first Central Queens-
land Hopeful Stakes), both these
animals having been bred at “Glen-
buck.” Amongst the blood mares

entered the industry on his own

conditions which prevail in Western
Queensland during the months of
summer. It is a two-storied building
surrounded by deep verandahs and
balconies, the interior furnishings
and fittings including every require-
ment essential to the comfort of the
family. The homestead was built in
a central position for the more
convenient administration of the
whole estate, and the several out-

shearers’ quarters, too, are notice-
ably up-to-date, the dwelling accom-
modation fulfilling all requirements
in regard to the comfort of the
men. Since his advent to the
district wherein he has made his
home he has freely participated in
the various movements set afoot for
the benefit of the residents, and has
not been neglectful of his duties
from a social standpoint. For the
past five years he has been a member
of the Ilfracombe Shire Council, and
sometime chairman of that body.
He has exercised magisterial duties
as a Justice of the Peace since 1912,
having received his commission at the
hands of the Denham Administration
in that year. As a member of
the United Graziers’ Association
of Queensland he evinces great
interest in affairs tending in a
general way to the advancement of
the pastoral industry. He is a
member of the local clubs at
Longreach and Barcaldine, of the
Queensland Club, and the “Bohem-
ians.” He has been a committee-man
of both the Longreach Jockey
Club and Amateur Race Club for
several years. Mr. Howatson mar-

GEORGE JOHN BUTT, “Witton
Lodge,” Montville, is a son of the
late George Butt, a native of Wor-
cestershire, England, who followed
farming pursuits in Warwickshire,
where he brought up a large family
of five sons and four daughters, his
decease occurring in the year 1875.
The subject of this notice was born
near Birmingham, and leaving school
at seven years of age, started work
on a farm, his duties being to scare
birds off the wheatfields, for which
service he received the sum of 6d.
per week and a daily mid-day meal.
After three years he was earning
2s. 6d. per week, in addition to the
whole of his keep, and being now
old enough to undertake more
responsible work, applied himself to
learning gardening under the super-
vision of a market gardener, who, in
addition to fruit and vegetables, cul-
tivated flowers of every description,
acres of wallflowers being a notice-
able feature of the garden. A big
trade was done with casual custom-
ers who called to purchase cut flowers,
as large a sum as £2O being taken
in one day by sales made on the
ground in this way. After four
years Mr. Butt left his employ and
took a position with a Mr. Quilter,
who conducted some pleasure gar-
dens at Lower Aston, where he
completed his knowledge of the
industry, remaining in this connec-
tion until 1884. About this time he
experienced a strong desire to try
his fortune in other lands, and
deciding to visit Australia, on
November 18, 1884, he took passage
by the steamship “Chibassa,” from
which he dis-embarked with his
family at Brisbane after an eight-
weeks’ voyage. Having met with an
accident on the voyage which
resulted in a broken rib, his first
“colonial experience” was a sojourn
in the Brisbane Hospital, and after
leaving this institution he lodged for
a month at the old emigration depot
in William Street, on the bank of the
Brisbane River. Eventually he


joined a brother-in-law in the
employ of Mr. J. C. Dixon, of
Buderim Mountain, obtaining work
at a wage of 225. per week, upon
which he had to keep his family—a
difficult task with flour at 365. a bag,
and other supplies proportionately
high in price. Having spent 15
months with this gentleman, Mr.
Butt returned to Brisbane, and for
some time worked at the gasometer
at Breakfast Creek, earning 7s. Bd.
per day, from which he was recalled
to Buderim by Mr. Dixon, who
offered him a post of overseer at 6s.
per day, with a comfortable dwell-
ing-house for his wife and children.
Shortly after this a portion of the
Blackall Range, known as Razor-
back, was thrown open for selection,
and Mr. Butt, having visited the
district, selected 160 acres of scrub
country, for which he paid the
nominal purchase money of 2s. 6d.
per acre, the same class of land now
commanding as much as ,£BO per
acre in this district, to which he has
since given the name of “Montville.”
Obtaining three months’ leave from
Mr. Dixon, Mr. Butt proceeded to
cut and split his own timber for the
erection of a slab “humpy” on the
new selection, and when the little
home was ready established his wife
and family therein, and returned to
his duties at Buderim Mountain.
Thenceforth for three years he led
the most strenuous of lives, after his
week’s work leaving the Mount at
5 o’clock on Saturday afternoon, and

journeyings to and fro. Upon
arrival at the foot of the Razorback,

to fight his own way to the summit,
while he himself scrambled up as
best he could, often dragging himself
along by clinging to grass and roots
on the steep side of the mountain.
On many occasions through the horse
going astray he was compelled to
tramp the road home carrying the
rations on his back, receiving his
After three years of this life Mr.
Butt obtained a position on Young
Bros.’ sugar plantation at Bunda-
berg, and 12 months later was
induced to sell a portion (40 acres)
of his selection for £lOO, and with
this capital in hand he took up his
abode on the selection, and became
the pioneer in fruitgrowing in Mont-
ville, an industry which has grown
to astonishing proportions there.
The greatest possible credit is due to
Mr. Butt for the steady consistency
of aim which kept him true to his
original purpose, and for the utter
disregard of personal comfort which
led him to ignore all hardships and
difficulties in the working out of the
same. Other settlers’ orchards have
now sprung up all around his little
holding, but he is universally
acknowledged to be the Father of
Montville, which owes its ultimate
prosperity to the foresight which
perceived the possibilities of the
country and the hardihood which in
spite of all obstacles caused the
vision to materialize. He was
appointed one of the first Justices of
the Peace for the district; and did
his share of Shire Council work at
Nambour for five years, in many
ways proving his active interest in
public matters; and it is inter-
esting to note that when Governor
McGregor visited the district he
always took the opportunity of call-
ing on Mr. Butt, and listened with
great attention to the pioneer’s
account of his experiences in the
wet or dry setting forth on his
journey of 18 miles, with a load of
provisions securely fastened on to his

timbered country, where the only

of Central Queensland, first came

time enjoyed the distinction of
being the largest sheep run in the
world. The daughter property,
carved in generous proportions out
of this great block, was the initial
venture of the then newly-formed
firm of Inglis & Fanning, who in
1895 began their pastoral opera-
tions with considerable vigour,
pushing forward the necessary de-
velopmental work with rapidity and
judgment. The holding, comprising
an area of about 26,000 acres, by
degrees was fully stocked with sheep,
from which excellent returns were
secured. Encouraged by this suc-
cess, the owners took an important
step forward when in 1903 the pur-
chase of “Westfield,” formerly the
property of Mr. Frederick Bowman,
was decided upon. This second hold-
ing, adjoining the former one, added
20,000 acres of the choice old
“Westland” property to the area
already controlled by the partners,
whose enterprise now had more
abundant scope. Their exertions
were rewarded with still further
prosperity, and so successful was
their scheme of management that in
1908 yet another extension of the
enterprise was decided upon with
the acquisition of “Blaina.” This
was another block of 20,000 acres,
consisting of country very similar
to “Strathmore,” which it adjoins,
and proved itself a very convenient
administration, for which the amal-
gamation was designed. The country

Landing at Victoria in 1880, Mr.

State for a few months. In 1881
he was attracted to the Temora gold
decided to come to Queensland, the
prospects of the Northern State at
that time being considered very
promising, and affording wider
scope than did the older settlements
for enterprising and adventurous
young colonists. Arriving at “War-
breccan” Station, on the Thomson
River, then the property of the late
John Simpson, and under the man-
agement of the late John Affleck,
Mr. Inglis spent a short period in
the capacity of jackaroo, but within
a few months was promoted to the
as head overseer of the run. At the
close of this period he was appointed
manager of “Eddington” Station,
and here the next decade of his life
was passed. Whilst resident there
he accomplished much valuable
improvement work on the property,
which was devoted to sheep, and
which under his management proved
a noteworthy success. In 1906, when
Mr. Hopkins, the late manager of
“Wellshot,” retired from that posi-
tion, Mr. Inglis was chosen as his
successor, and he forthwith assumed
the duties of control on his com-
pany’s principal property in Queens-
land. Some idea of the magnitude
of the task now entrusted to his
hands may be gained by the fact
that at the time of Mr. Inglis’s
appointment “Wellshot” carried
over 300,000 sheep, while the
efficient manner in which he has
handled the multitudinous affairs
devolving upon him as controller of
its operations is amply attested by
his having continued to hold the
post ever since. During his term of
service as head overseer Mr. Inglis
became closely associated with Mr.
W. J. Fanning, who was then head
musterer on the same station, and
the two men had abundant oppor-
tunity to discuss the possibilities of
pastoral enterprise in the district.
As a result of this association a


partnership was determined upon,
and in 1895 they combined forces
in the purchase of “Strathmore,”
afterwards becoming owners of
“Westfield” and “Blaina,” as
already written. Mr. Inglis has con-
tinued at his post as manager of
“Wellshot,” leaving to his partner
the practical administration of their
joint interests. To the former has
fallen the duty of representing the
firm in the public life of the dis-
trict, where he has been a fairly
prominent figure. For 11 years he
has served as member of the Ilfra-
combe Shire Council, being elected
chairman by his follow-councillors
on several occasions. He is a com-
mitteeman of the Longreach Agri-
cultural and Pastoral Society, was
appointed a Justice of the Peace
by the Philp Administration in
1899, is a member of the various
sporting clubs of the district, and is
a committeeman of the Longreach
Amateur Racing Club. Mr. Inglis
married in 1894 Elizabeth, daughter
of the late James Nicholson, of
Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, a
member of an old Lowland family,
and has issue a son and a daughter.

the stirring days when Ireland was
an independent nation with a Par-
liament of her own. Though little
more than a lad still in his teens,
Mr. W. J. Fanning shortly after the
death of his father sailed for
Australia with his paternal uncle,
the late Thomas Fanning, his inten-
tion being to begin life on his own
account in the big overseas colonies
of Great Britain, which were be-
ginning to be much talked of in
Ireland, as in other portions of the
United Kingdom. Queensland drew
him, together with many other
daring and adventurous spirits, to
her borders. Proceeding inland,
Mr. Fanning found his first
occupation in the pastoral industry,
being employed by a drover to assist
him in the work of overlanding
sheep in the Barcoo district. A few
months later he obtained a position
on “Oakwood” Station, then owned
by the firm of Messrs. Bullmore and
Burns, well-known pastoralists of
that time, and in the capacity of

very useful to his employers. In
1886, desiring a change and wider
experience, he became identified
with the working staff of ‘'Well-
shot,” nine years later joining Mr.
Inglis in the purchase of “Strath-
more.” He married in 1898 Cather-
ine, daughter of the late Thomas
Connolly, for many years head-
master of the New Ross National
School, County Wexford, and a
scion of good old Celtic stock, the
Connollys of Wexford being second
in historic importance only to the
Fannings. Old heirlooms yet in
possession of the former family,
some of which have found their way
to Queensland, date back to the
days of Irish national independence.
Of the marriage there were five
children, of whom two sons and two
daughters survive. In 1912 Mr.
Fanning, with his wife and family,
took a trip to the Old Country,
where they visited many places of
interest. During a two-years’ resi-
dence in Ireland the sons attended
Blackrock College, County Dublin,
returning with their parents to
Queensland in 1914. Mrs. Fanning
is a lady of considerable literary
attainments, and published many
articles on Australia in the Wex-
ford Free Press, which served the
useful purpose of bringing into
prominence the land of the South-
ern Cross among the residents of the
Emerald Isle.


WILLIAM GEORGE CAREY
AVERY, J.P., owner of “Nogo”
and “Euston,” Longreach, was born
at Mount Gambler, South Australia,
on August 16, 1867, and is the eldest
MR. W. B. AVERY.
son of the late George Hitchcock
Avery, who hailed from Devonshire,
England, in which county in the
vicinity of Barnstaple he carried on
agrarian pursuits, his progenitors
having followed similar avocations
in that locality for many generations.
On the late gentleman’s arrival in
Australia he became occupied with
commercial interests in connection
with the whaling industry. In the
early sixties he turned his attention
to the pastoral industry, acquiring a
property in South Australia, which
he worked for a short period and
then sold. Proceeding to Victoria
he continued his associations with
the land, and shortly afterwards
extended his operations to New
South Wales, being one of the
pioneer selectors of the Riverina
district, where he took up a property
near Jerilderie in the early seventies.
After spending some time in that
locality he removed to the north-west
of New South Wales, where he
purchased a sheep-run known as
“Molton Plains” from the late Sir
Samuel Wilson. He continued to
personally administer that estate
until the year 1884, when he decided
to embark on a venture of greater
magnitude in South Australia.
Disposing of “Molton Plains” he
purchased from the South Aus-
tralian Government an immense
tract of country in the far north
of that State, and adjoining the
Northern Territory boundary, to
which he despatched large flocks of
sheep to depasture the wide acres
which had come under his control.
His enterprise, however, was fol-
lowed by most disastrous conse-
quences, owing to the fact that he
was overtaken by the drought which
devastated the continent during the
early eighties, and which resulted in
the ruination of his prospects,
providing another instance of the
unmerited misfortunes which have
so often attended the laborious
efforts of the pioneer, whose enter-
prise none the less paved the way for
later generations. Nothing daunted
by the frowns of fortune, and
actuated by the courage and perse-
verance which were the undoubted

factors of his earlier success, the late
Mr. Avery next directed his atten-
tion to Queensland, which at that
time had made good headway as a
pastoral colony, and arrived there
with his wife and family (then
almost grown up), shortly after-
wards investing the remnant of
his capital in “Sunny Hills”
Station, in the vicinity of Win-
ton. This speculation also proved
unfortunate, and he was again faced
with failure and disaster, but the
spirit of the old pioneer was not
easily broken, and having deter-
mined on a fresh start, he selected
country in the Mitchell district, near
Longreach. This property was called
“Rio,” after the old “Rio” cattle
yards and waterhole, which it
surrounded, and consisted of 10,000
acres of country. With the assistance
of his two sons he immediately
entered upon the development and
improvement of his newly-acquired
estate, stocking it with sheep. He
resided at “Rio” until the occurrence
of his last illness, his death eventuat-
ing in the year 1891 at the Barcal-
dine Hospital, that town being then
the nearest centre at which medical
attention was available, and at that
time the terminus of the Queensland
Central Railway. The late George
Hitchcock Avery left a name
deserving of all honour and well
worthy of historic record in the
annals of the State as that of a
pioneer to whom posterity has every
reason to feel grateful. His wife nee
Eliza Carey, who was descended on
the maternal side from an old French
family, came to Victoria in the early
fifties under professional engage-
ment as an elocutionist. Miss Carey
landed at Portland, which town at
that time vied with Geelong for
supremacy in the Victorian State —
Melbourne being then in its infancy
and little more than a canvas town —
and shortly after her arrival met
her future husband in the person of

was removed, the situation being
thus saved. “Alroy” embraced some
40,000 acres of country, this area
including both the original ac-
quisition and the later purchase by
the firm of an adjoining block called
“Yreva.” Owing to the rapid re-
cuperation of the country resultant
on the prosperous season which
followed the period of drought it was
considered advisable in their own
interests to dissolve the existing
partnership, the brothers realizing
that better results would accrue from
single-handed efforts. Accordingly
the several properties were divided,
“Alroy” and the adjoining blocks
falling to the lot of Mr. Charles N.
C. Avery, while “Rio” and “Long-
way” were retained by Mr. W. G.
C. Avery, who continued to admin-
ister both estates until the following
year, when he disposed of the former
run. On the completion of that
transaction he devoted his undivided
attention to “Longway,” and having
built a fine residence on the property
continued to reside there until the
year 1911, when a tempting offer
resulted in its disposal. In the
meantime he was busy in other
directions, having selected “Euston”
on November 1, 1910, and purchased
“Llighfields,” an adjoining estate,
early in the following year, the
latter negotiation being succeeded by
the purchase of “Nogo,” in June,
1911. Soon after his acquirement of
“Highfields” he resold it and
directed his energies to the

somewhat varied, the former run,
which has a nine-mile frontage to
the Thomson River, bearing for the
greater part boree and gidya, in
addition to the coolibah which
prevails on the river flats and in the
channel country. “Euston,” which
does not possess a river frontage, is
nicely timbered for shade purposes,
yielded no return, as its owner was
bent on expending everything in the
way of output on modern and
permanent development, the wisdom
of this course having been proved by
later results. Among the improve-
ments which have been the outcome
of his administration are two sub-
artesian bores and three 12,000-yard
tanks, the water supply thus afforded
being supplemented by the output of
a permanent spring. After the sale
of “Longway” in 1911 Mr. Avery’s
family resided for some years in

the pages which immediately precede
this article in a memoir dealing with
the life of his eldest son, Mr. \V. G.
C. Avery) having been engaged at
that time in pastoral pursuits in the
vicinity of the above-mentioned
town. He was educated chiefly at
home under private tuition, though
he later entered with his brother
upon a course of study at a scholastic
supervision, being thus employed on
the family’s removal to Queensland,
where the late Mr. Avery hoped to
improve his fortunes after a lifetime
spent in the Southern States which
was marked by many vicissitudes.
The late gentleman’s first speculation
in Queensland was in a pastoral
property called “Sunny Hills,” near
Winton, in the working of which he
was assisted by the gentleman under
review and his elder brother. This
venture proving unsuccessful was
relinquished in favour of another —a
selection of 10,000 acres in the
vicinity of Longreach, to which was
given the name of “Rio,” after the
old “Rio” cattle yards which the run
surrounded. In the conduct of this
property he was assisted by his elder
son and the subject of our present
memoir until his death, which
occurred in Barcaldine in the year
1891, after a lifetime spent in
pioneering and developing the wide
spaces of his adopted country. The
brothers continued to work the
estate in partnership for about 18
years, acquiring during that time at
different periods three additional
propositions, namely, “Longway,”
“Alroy,” and “Yreva,” situated in
the Mitchell district, in the vicinity
of Longreach, the first-mentioned
by selection, and the two latter,
which adjoin each other, by pur-
chase. In order of their acquirement
an energetic regime of development
was instituted, the results of which

being directed towards the conser-

completed at the homestead. The
slogan of Mr. Charles N. C. Avery
has ever been "thoroughness and
efficiency,” and there is not the least
shadow of doubt that these two
qualities have been present in all his
undertakings, and it can be said
with truth that there is hardly a
pastoral property in the west of
Queensland whereon the improve-
ments have been so efficiently carried
out as on the three blocks which now
might assist towards the accomplish-
ment of that end. In the year 1907
Mr. Avery added to his landed
interests by the acquirement of a
property known as consist-
ing of 40,000 acres, which after
holding and improving for about
seven years he disposed of in 1914,
and it is worthy of mention that the
first sub-artesian bore put down in
the district was sunk on this estate
under his auspices. After the dis-
posal of "lulga” he purchased from
Messrs. Pincombe & Buckland a

Mitchell and blue grasses provide
the stock with their chief fodder,
though the property also produces a
considerable growth of Flinders
grass, and in addition the usual
winter herbage. The chief timbers
borne are boree, gidya, and white-
wood, which, in addition to affording
a desirable shelter for the flocks from
the severity of the summer sun and
the inclement winds of winter, have
been found most useful in the carry-
ing out of the vast amount of utility
work which has been effected on the
estate, the wood having been used
for both fencing and building pur-
poses. The run is subdivided into
12 sheep, two horse, and two ram
paddocks, all of which are of a
suitable area, and there are also
other utility paddocks of smaller
dimensions. It is completely fenced
on the boundary, rabbit-proof nett-
ing having been used on two sides,
while the remainder is a six-wire
structure, which has been rendered
dog-proof. Including the boundary
and sub-divisional erections, the
length of fencing covered amounts
to about 80 miles. The woolshed is
a large iron building containing 10
stands, fitted with Burgon-Wolseley
combination machines, and driven

homestead, which is situated 58
miles nearly due west from Long-
reach, is an artistic structure
enclosed in a garden full of beautiful
blooms, tbe grounds in the further
distance being adorned by the ever
useful and ornamental shade and
shrub and the several varieties of
fruit trees which flourish so lux-
uriantly in the central west of
Queensland, the whole area of
cultivation testifying amply to the
care and attention which have been
bestowed upon it, evidencing those
qualities of order and thorough-

EDWARDS, MARTIN, LTD.,
builders and contractors, hardware
merchants, manufacturers, engineers,
and sawmillers, etc., Longreach.
This important firm was established
MR. J. M. EDWARDS.
in 1910 by the purchase and amal-
gamation of two of the earliest and
most reputable business concerns
then trading at Longreach by
Messrs. Edwards and Martin. These
were the old-established firms of
Messrs. English & Co., Limited, and
John Martin & Co., with which
Messrs. Edwards and Martin had
been identified, the two businesses
being run as one concern, though
independently of each other. This
expensive system was promptly-
abandoned by the new owners, and
the two businesses placed under one
head, the premises of John Martin
and Co. being sold to the Longreach
Motor Company, Limited, which was
then formed into a co-operative
company, of which Edwards, Martin,
Ltd., were the jirincipal share-
holders. Mr. Edwards became the
first chairman of directors of the
last-named company, and it is
worthy of note that since his
assumption of control both these
well-known western houses have pro-
gressed to a marked degree, the
turnover of Edwards, Martin, Ltd.,
having increased fourfold. The
firm lias played an important part
in the development of the west in
regard to their country business, as
is particularly exemplified in the
case of station homes, nearly every
one of the up-to-date and well'
equipped residences which have been
such large factors in mitigating the
trying conditions incidental to the
western summers having been
erected under their contracts. In
all other branches of the business
this progressive note is apparent, a
large amount of capital having been
expended in motor traction to cojie
with the erstwhile difficulty of
transport over the long distances of
the west during dry seasons. The
enterprise displayed by the firm in
this matter was marked by its effect
on water conservation for the saving
of stock, the utilizing of motor con-
veyance, rendering it possible to
provide the equipment necessary for
the successful prosecution of this
important work, which otherwise it
would have been impossible to
attempt. John Maine Edwards,
J.P., the head of the firm of Messrs.
Edwards, Martin, Ltd., was born
at Ipswich, Queensland, on Sep-
tember 25, 1873, and is the son of
Mr. Samuel Davies Edwards, who
hailed from Bideford, Devonshire,
England, landing in Australia in the
early sixties, having at that time
just reached man’s estate. The last-
mentioned gentleman is descended
from an old English Congregational
family, his father, the late Rev.
John Edwards, having been a well-
known divine whose labours were
confined to his native land. After
a period spent in the island con-
tinent, during which he was engaged
in agrarian pursuits, Mr. Samuel D.
Edwards crossed over to New Zea-
land, where he remained for a short
time, subsequently returning to his
original destination and continuing
in farming avocations. He was
amongst the pioneer farmers of the
East Moreton district, Queensland,
where he owned a. property which he
worked from the early days of that
district until the year 1886, when
he was offered an appointment
under the Crown. Having devoted
many arduous years to the farming
industry he decided to accept the
post, and was for several years Clerk
of Petty Sessions at Rockhampton,
and subsequently stamp officer until
his retirement from the Service on
reaching the age limit provided by
the Government. He now lives in
retirement in Rockhampton, having
long passed the allotted span, the
autumn of his days being spent in
company with his good wife, whose
life also provides a fine example of
citizenship through that womanly
sympathy and brave support which
she so unwaveringly accorded to the
efforts of her pioneer husband. This
lady, nee Eliza Morrow, is a native
of the north of Ireland, and comes
of a well-known family of the name
who peopled that portion of the
Emerald Isle. Her brother is Mr.
Thomas Morrow, principal of the
firm of Morrows Limited, Brisbane.
Of the union there were two sons
and six daughters, the elder son
being the subject of our present
notice. Mr. John Maine Edwards
received the major portion of his
education at Rockhampton, and con-
cluding his scholastic career at the
age of 14 immediately joined the
firm of Messrs. Burns, Twigg, & Co.,
Rockhampton. He remained in this
establishment for a period of ten
years, during which he became con-
versant with every branch of the
business. Subsequently, on relin-
quishing his first post, he entered
the establishment of Messrs. English
and Co., Longreach. Starting at the
bottom of the ladder in the firm’s
office he was very soon au fait with
the various phases of the business and
within 10 years had worked himself
up by his probity, ability, and
industry to the post of manager.
Eventually, in the year 1910, he
and Mr. Martin acquired by pur-
chase the control of this old-
established business as already

described, since when the former
gentleman has acted in the capacity

the year 1911, and has always taken
a prominent part in local public
affairs. Since his advent to Long-
reach he has largely interested him-

present site of this institute having
been obtained from the Government
through his instrumentality. His
firm was responsible for the erection
of the School of Arts building, this
work being accomplished by Messrs.
Edwards, Martin, Ltd., at a price
which was actually hundreds of
pounds sterling below the actual cost
to the firm itself, Mr. Edwards’ per-
sonal interest in the matter setting
aside purely business considerations
in order to worthily achieve the
desired end. He has been president
of the Longreach School of Arts for
a considerable period. For a couple
of years he accorded his services to
the Longreach Shire as a councillor.
He is on the committee of the Long-
reach Agricultural and Pastoral
Show Society, and gives his prac-
tical support to all matters of public
import. He married in the year
1904 Hannah Isabella, daughter of
Mr. James Macfarlane, who for over
42 years has filled the post of Rail-
way Inspector for Central Queens-
land, and whose association with the
railway history of the State is
marked by the fact that he has
practically followed the building of
the line from the sea to the far west
during that period. Of the union
there is a surviving family of two sons
and one daughter. John Martin,
one of the principals and works
manager of Edwards, Martin, Ltd.,
was born at Bennett’s Bridge,
County Kilkenny, Ireland, on
December 21, 1859, and is the son
of the late James Martin, who
was a grazier and mixed agricul-
turist. The late gentleman was
descended from an ancient family of
Norman extraction, his ancestors
having settled in the Emerald Isle
at the time of the Norman invasion.
The old home of the Martins has
been in the family for untold gener-
ations. Mr. Martin received his
primary education in the local
branch of the Irish National
School, concluding his scholastic
course under the tuition of the Kil-
kenny City Christian Brothers. On
leaving school he was sent to Dublin,
where he was apprenticed to the
coach-building trade, subsequently
following his craft in his native
county until the attainment of his
twenty-fourth year, when he decided
to visit Australia. Landing at Bris-
bane he afterwards proceeded to
“Bon Accord” Station, near Dalby,
where he worked for a time. He
later returned to the metropolis,
where, in conjunction with Mr.
Charles Lyons, he set up a coach-
building business, which was carried

on by the partners until 1893. In
that year he proceeded to Long-
reach, where he followed his trade
in a general way for about five years,
launching the business of John
Martin & Co., general blacksmiths,
coach-builders, etc., in 1898, which
he conducted until its amalgamation
with the present firm on its estab-
lishment 12 years later. Since his
arrival in Australia he has actively
concerned himself with the duties of
public life, having filled the post of
auditor on the Windsor Shire
Council during the term of his resi-
dence in the precincts of the
metropolis, and taken part in all
important movements connected
with that suburb. On his advent to
the west he at once entered whole-
heartedly into every progressive
movement on foot, giving practical
assistance to the various bodies insti-
tuted for the welfare of the district
or community. He is a pillar of the
Roman Catholic Church in Long-
reach and one of the founders of the
local H.A.C.B. Society, having car-
ried out the duties of either president
or secretary of that body for the past
14 years. For some years past he
has been a councillor of the Long-
reach Shire, and has also filled a seat
on the Hospital and School of Arts
committees. He is also a member
of the Fire Brigades Board and cap-
tain of the Rifle Club. Indeed, he is
one of the popular workers of the
district, being ever ready whenever
and wherever needed to do his share
for the general good, sparing neither
time nor energy to this end. He is
a lover of clean sport, and has always
been prominently connected with the
various athletic clubs, and is also a
member of the Longreach Jockey
Club committee. He married in the
year 1903 Lily Ellen, daughter of
the late Jolm McGreevy, a member
of an old Leitrim family, whose
origin in the Emerald Isle is almost
as old as tradition itself.


JOHN McNALLY, J.P., “Ban-
don Grove,” Longreach, was born at
“Alderly” Station, near Stroud,
New South Wales, on April 12,
1857, and is descended from one of
MR. J. McNALLY.
the most ancient families in Ireland,
the name having been connected
with agrarian pursuits from time
immemorial. One of his more
immediate ancestors followed the
profession of arms, having served
with distinction in the Spanish wars
during the early part of the last
century. He is the second son of
the late Thomas McNally, and a
grandson of one of the first veter-
inary surgeons to arrive in Australia
in a professional capacity, this
gentleman (who was a native of the
Emerald Isle) having been preceded
by two of the fraternity who accom-
panied the military authorities to the
country about the time of the
foundation of New South Wales as
a colony. The pioneer of the
McNally family in the land of the
Southern Cross was a veterinary
surgeon to the A.A. Company in
New South Wales from the time of
its inception, and also overseer of
the staff of Government men em-
ployed at “Alderly” at that period.
His duties at the above-mentioned
station occupied him until his
death, which occurred there in
his eightieth year. The late
Thomas McNally was also born
in Ireland, and came to Aus-
tralia with his father in the
early thirties. He subsequently fol-
lowed farming pursuits in the
neighbourhood of Stroud, New
South Wales, and in this locality his
family of eight children were reared.
In time he, too, crossed the “Great
Divide,” though his memory is still
held in honour as one of the worthy
pioneers of the land movement in
the Mother State. Mr. John
McNally received his education at a
small Government school at Booval,
concluding his scholastic course at
an early age in order to assist his
father in the work of the farm. As
was the case with most of the sons
of early pioneers, his childish efforts
were requisitioned in the general
routine of farm labour, from his
early years before as well as during
and after his school days. On reach-
ing man’s estate he left the paternal
rooftree, starting life as a carrier in
conjunction with his brother Hugh
in the year 1880, his father having
MR. J. W. McNALLY.
presented him with the necessary
plant. The brothers began with two
teams, and pursued their calling in
the northern part of New South
Wales, and subsequently came to
Queensland. On their arrival in the
latter State they parted company,
Hugh having elected to try his luck
at gold-mining. The subject of our
memoir, however, continued in the
carrying trade until the year 1891,
when, after having covered many
thousands of miles in the pursuance
of this calling, he decided to utilize
his outfit for a different purpose,
transferring his energies to the
tank-sinking business, the country
having at that time begun to realize
the serious need of water conserva-
tion if its resources were to be
profitably developed. He subse-
quently owned three of the most
up-to-date tank-sinking outfits in the
west, and continued work as a con-
tractor until 1906, in which year he
retired from active pursuits for a
short period in order to visit the
Motherland, where he saw many
places of historic interest. On his
return to Queensland, though still
retaining his interests in the tank-
sinking business, he decided to
embark in landed pursuits, select-
ing, in partnership with Mr. A.
Brunner, his present property,
“Bandon Grove,” in the year 1907.
The venture was followed by the
purchase of “Spring Hill,” an
estate which is also situated in the
vicinity of Longreach. Subse-
quently “Gloucester” and “Bala-
clava” were taken up, these selections
being located in the Mitchell district.
At a still later date the firm acquired
“Trafalgar,” a property situated on
the Barcoo. In the year 1911 Mr.
McNally bought out all the interests
of his partner, and has since con-
ducted his grazing propositions on
his own account, combining his
activities in the pastoral industry
with his tank-sinking business, the
latter being now conducted by his
nephews. The whole of his landed

grass, though many other natural
varieties and an abundance of useful
herbage prevail. The run was origin-
ally stocked with locally-bred sheep,
but by degrees this type was worked
out by the substitution of a pure
Wanganella strain, the careful study
and scientific methods brought to
bear on the subject producing such
satisfactory results that at time of
writing the clip from this estate
equals in quality that of any property
in the district. “Bandon Grove’’ is
also noted for the quality of horse-
flesh bred on its acres, the success
achieved in this department being
the result of the owner’s love of a
good type of horse. The stallion
now in use is “Welcome Trist,’’ a
fine upstanding horse, 16.1 hands
high and 6 ft. 6 in. round the girth,
a winner of the Rosehill (twice),
Hawkesbury Spring, Hawkesbury,
V.A.T.C. Coongy, Sydney, Dudley
and Warwick Farm Handicaps, and
the A.J.C. Grantham Stakes. He
came second to “Mountain King’’

"WELCOME TRIST.”
Previous to the declaration of war
between Great Britain and Germany
“Welcome Trist” was included
among the stallions purchased by the
latter Government, the transaction
being upset on the outbreak
of hostilities. “Welcome Trist” was
retired from the turf as a result of
an accident. Mr. McNally was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Denham Administration. He
served three years as a member of
the Longreach Council, and is a
member of the Longreach Club. His
support is accorded to everything in
the way of clean sport, his name
being included in the membership of
nearly every race club in the west.
He married in the year 1889 Mar-
garet Ann, daughter of Mr. James
Mulveny, a well-known identity of
Western Queensland, and a native
of the Emerald Isle, who arrived in
the State in the dawn of her history,
coming from the Old Land with the
first company of free settlers to the
land of the Southern Cross. Of the
union there is a family of six sons
and five daughters. The eldest son,
William Alexander, assists his father
in the administration of the pro-
perty, while the second, John Wal-
lace, enlisted in the A.I.F. He is
one of the original Anzacs, and saw
several months’ fighting on the
Gallipoli Peninsula, afterwards being
on active service in Palestine. One
of Mr. McNally’s married daughters
joined the Voluntary Aid Detach-
ment and proceeded to England,
while her husband, Mr. E. T. Arden,
served with the Royal Flying Corps
in France.

accord, and which many years after-
wards produced as an inevitable
consequence the Great World War
which ended (1918) in glorious
victory for Britain and her
Allies, after ravaging Europe for
over four years. As a result oi his
lack of sympathy with the policy of
his native country, the founder of
the Peters family in Australia up-
rooted the earlier associations of his
life, and bidding a last farewell to
his kith and kin set his face towards
the free land under the Southern
Cross, arriving with his wife and the
children then born to him in New
South Wales in the year already
mentioned. Having come of a farm-
ing stock, he naturally turned his
attention to agrarian pursuits on
arrival in his adopted country, and
shortly afterwards secured a farm in
the Burnett district, in the vicinity
of Mount Perry. For about 15 years
he devoted his energies to the
successful conduct of this property,
subsequently in the middle seventies,
establishing himself in the butcher-
ing business of Gayndah. After
worthily acheiving his desire of
carving an honourable career in the
land of his adoption and of rearing
his children with similar ideals to
those which he himself possessed, he
crossed the Great Divide in the year
1886, having been occupied with
his business up to the time of his
last illness. His family consisted of
two sons —the elder of whom was
the late John Henry Peters, the
father of the present occupiers
of "Notus Downs”—and four
daughters. The last-mentioned
gentleman was born and received
his education at Gayndah, though
at an early age he rendered useful
aid to. his father in the conduct of
his business. On the attainment of
his eighteenth year he became
engaged in droving, assisting in
travelling a mob of cattle from
"Mount Perry” to “Mount Cornish”
Station. On his arrival at the above-
mentioned property he was offered
and accepted the post of bush
carpenter, and was subsequently
employed in various other occupa-
tions, remaining on the station for
10 years, during which period his
work covered almost every branch of
pastoral development, from that of
general stock hand to contractor for
fencing and other developmental
operations. On severing his connec-
tion with the proprietors at the end
of the year 1890 he had accumulated
sufficient capital to make a start, in
what even now might be considered
a small way, on his own account,
acquiring by selection a block of
land consisting of 5,000 acres. This
property, which he named "Nogo,”
was a portion of the resumed area
of "Mount Cornish” Station, and to
its improvement and general admin-
istration he thenceforward devoted
his whole-hearted efforts, settling

seasons of flood and drought, which
brought dispiriting and heartbreak-
ing consequences in their train.
Spurred ever to fresh effort, how-
ever, by the needs of a young family
MR. E. R. PETERS.
and by the unfailing encouragement
and practical assistance of his wife,
he continued to work his property
despite the odds, his strenuous
endeavours being at length rewarded


by the comparative success which
enabled him to seize the opportunity
of bettering his circumstances, by
the selection and purchase of small
blocks surrounding the original
of some 96,000 acres of excellent
pastoral lands in the Longreach
district, from which important
pastoral centre the homestead stands
on a site 60 miles south and east of

review of his career. He left a family

industry. In the interim, during
the year 1896, he selected other
blocks, the first of these being
“Upshot,” a part of “Silsoe” Station

miles from Longreach. To the
development of this property he
applied himself assiduously, adding

purchase of an adjoining estate con-

later, in 1911, he disposed of the
whole of his previously acquired
property and devoted his energies to
the administration of the last-
mentioned estate, being assisted in
his efforts in the latter years of his
life by his elder sons, who were then
approaching the years of manhood.

owners. The two eldest daughters

Service for the past 20 years. Mr.
Frederick George Peters, who is the
eldest son of the late John

his education at Nudgee College,
near Brisbane. On the completion
of his collegiate course he returned
removal to “Notus Downs,” actively
participated in the administration
of that estate. The second son, Mr.
Leslie Peters, was born on June 16,
1893, and, like his elder brother,
Roland Peters was born at Rock-
hampton on July 10, 1901, and
educated at the local Grammar
School, concluding his scholastic
course in the year 1916. Adopting
to the homestead at “Nogo,” and
resuming his association with the
routine of station life with which he
had been familiar since childhood,
became engaged in pastoral pursuits
under his father’s supervision. It
was not long before he had mastered

to continue in the steps of his

father’s tuition gained the experience
necessary to qualify him for the
the career to which he was born, he
has since assisted his brothers in the
administration of “Notus Downs.”
Though this property has already
attained to a high degree of develop-

continue apace. At time of writing
the improvements include some 120

head is Lord Reay—the late Duncan
Mackay held lands which were
acquired by his progenitors in those
ancient times when it was customary
for the head, or chief of a clan, to
give to his relatives a portion of the
estate of which he was overlord; and
for which the occupier paid a tax,
being thus known as the chieftain’s
taxman. The history of this clan is
fraught with unusual interest.
Tradition claims that it was founded
on a tribe of the tall, fair, Celtic
race which, originally invading the
southern shores of Britain in pre-
historic times, was gradually driven
westward by later comers and
eventually established a footing in
the Isle of Man, Ireland, and the
Highlands of Scotland. It is also
claimed by tradition that the north
of Ireland was the cradle of the
Mackay family, and that the tribe to
which they owe their descent was
engaged in the primitive warfare of
the period under the chieftainship of
the most distantly recorded ancestor
of the present clan, which finally
settled in Scotland. Records of those
early times and subsequent ages have
kept alive the memory and achieve-
ments of the Mackay, which, even in
the glorious annals of Scottish
history, have never been outshone;
and this anciently-acquired prestige
of the line received added lustre
during the later eras of peace or war
from the brilliant courage of its
soldiers and the acomplishments of
its civilian representatives in many
different parts of the globe. During
the Great War (1914-18) the only
brother of the subject of our memoir,
Angus Cameron Mackay, as a
captain and major in the Royal
Army Medical Corps fully bore out
the traditions of his race on the
battlefield. The Strathy branch of
the Mackay family, from which Mr.
Peter Mackay is descended, settled
in Sutherland, but during the reign
of Queen Anne his ancestors removed
from that County to Perthshire,
where they held extensive landed
interests as graziers. Early in the
last century the family took up the
acres of “Glenure,” in Argyllshire,
and there made their home, it being
worthy of mention that the house of
Glenur© is identical with the dwelling
described in Robert Louis Stevenson’s
celebrated novel, “Kidnapped,” as
the home of Colin Campbell, the
“Red Fox,” whose wife was a Mackay
of the Bighouse branch of the clan.
On the distaff side of the house Mr.
Peter Mackay is descended from the
Lochaber Camerons (Lochaber being
the cradle of the clan so named) and
is also maternally connected with the
McNab family of Innishewen, Perth-
shire. Francis, the twelfth laird of
this clan, was the original of Rae-
burn’s famous portrait, “The
Mac Nab.” Mr. Peter Mackay was

shire, Scotland, on November 30,

ing industry received recognition by
his appointment as a life member of
the Highland Cattle Society. On
in the new country, and with that
objective he journeyed with his wife
over the northern part of Queensland
and through the Northern Territory,
overlanding through the Clonclurry
district, and eventually arriving in
Central Queensland, where his choice
fell on a future home. Entering into
partnership with his brother-in-law,
at that time but recently arrived at
years of manhood, he purchased
“Plereward” on behalf of the firm,
and has since been actively engaged
in the administration of the proposi-
tion. He married, in Edinburgh, in
the year 1907 Annie Elizabeth,
second daughter of the late Mr.
Donald Maclntyre, of “Dalgonally,”
and has a family of two sons and
three daughters. Mr. Robert Macln-
tyre, part owner of “Hereward,” was
born at Bowen, Queenland, in the
late gentleman was divided amongst
his family. While engaged in graz-
ing enterprize in Scotland, Mr. P.
Mackay made a keen study of all
matters relating to stock, becoming
an expert in that direction, with the
result that his services were in fre-
quent request as a judge of Highland
cattle and black-faced Highland
sheep. He was the owner of a well-
known herd of Highland pedigreed
cattle; and his knowledge and
experience, combined with the excell-
ent nature of the country comprising
his Australian property, have been
responsible for the success which has
crowned his efforts at “Hereward.”
For a number of years, ere leaving
his native land, he acted as Hon.
Secretary of the Scottish Farmers’

various channels of public life was

trable mystery. Donald continued
to administer “Dalgonally” until the
year 1905, and in forming and
one of the most prominent pastoral-
ists of Northern Queensland He
raised a large herd of cattle on
“Dalgonally,” comprising at one time
75,000 head, and founded the
Normantown Meat Works in the
nineties, entering upon this under-
taking when the value of horned
stock was at an exceedingly low ebb.
He was a supporter of the various
progressive movements that marked
the development of the North, and
generously aided the sacred cause of
charity. A ward which bears his
name was presented by him to the
Townsville Hospital when that
institution was re-erected after the
disastrous cyclone, “Leonta,” which
practically razed that centre in 1896.
He married in the year 1872
Elizabeth, daughter of Donald
Macdonald, a native of Lome,
Argyllshire, Scotland. The last two
years of his life were spent in retire-

the year 1907, at the ripe old age of
four score years, he crossed the Great

of the School’s First Eleven. The
year 1910 witnessed his return to
Australia and his entry into the
pastoral industry on “Wellshot,”
then one of the largest sheep stations
in Queensland, where he directed his
efforts with the intention of obtain-
ing a first-hand and thorough know-
ledge of the industry to which, in
emulation of his late father, it was
his purpose to devote himself. Two
years later his partnership with Mr.

also spent some months in the Army
of Occupation on the Rhine. His
brother, Duncan, also participated
in the great struggle for world

member of the Imperial Veterinary
Corps in France. Mr. Robert

gallon tank and troughing, give
excellent supplies of good water,
while two overshot dams and one

cubic yards, situated in the vicinity
of the homestead, conserve further
quantities and amply supplement the
natural sources contained in the
several creeks which intersect the

JAMES HORNIBROOK, owner
of the "Glenore” and "Glenavon”
properties, Obi Obi, is descended
from a family of Hornibrooks in
Ireland, most of whom have turned
to the soil for their means of liveli-
hood. His father, the late Augustus
Hornibrook, a native of Dunmanway,
County Cork, who followed the
calling of his ancestors in that part
of the Emerald Isle, died when the
gentleman under review was only
two years of age, and subsequent to
this event the widow, with several
of her children, emigrated to
Queensland, and settled in Brisbane.
Mr. James Hornibrook and a
brother meanwhile were left in the
care of an uncle and aunt in the
Old Country, and before following
the family to their new home James
was sent to the public school at
Dunmanway, where he received his
primary instruction. After arrival
in Brisbane in January, 1889, he
finished his education at the Normal
School, Adelaide. Street, and subse-
quently obtained some experience of
commercial life which proved of
value to him in his later career. A
brother, Mr. Michael Augustus Hor-
nibrook, had selected country for
farming purposes and formed a home-
stead of 160 acres in the Obi Obi dis-
trict, and to this holding Mr. Jas.
Hornibrook came as a lad to work
under the older man’s supervision.
Making rapid progress during the
course of two years, when barely 20

account, and selected a holding of
160 acres adjoining his brother’s
property, the two estates being

separated by the Obi Obi Creek.
After taking possession the erection
of a slab "humpy” first claimed his
attention, and for this purpose
timber pit-sawed on the selection was
path had been cut through the
scrub bit by bit by the little band of
settlers who had preceded him in the
district. Finally, reaching Nambour,
he despatched the carcase, which
utilized. The clearing of five acres
for cultivation followed, and before
long corn, maize, and root crops
presented a healthy appearance,
while a few pigs and cattle repre-
sented the nucleus of the stock
department. Mr. Hornibrook’s rela-
tion of some of the incidents of those
early pioneering days indicate clearly
what a life of hardship and privation
the settlers endured in the develop-
ment of their various propositions.
MR. JAMES HORNIBROOK.
The difficulty of conveying produce
and stock to market was very great,
and to illustrate this he tells how
upon one occasion he killed a pig and
carried the carcase on horseback
over a range of mountains thousands
of feet in height, where a bridle
weighed some 140 lbs., to Brisbane,
receiving in return the small sum of
18s. Butter and other produce also
had to be taken on horseback toNam-
bour, whence it was sent by rail to
the metropolis, and this condition of
things extended over a lengthy
period. Eventually Mr. Hornibrook
became the first mail-coach con-
tractor from Obi Obi, via Mapleton
and Dulong to Nambour, receiv-
ing the munificent salary of
£45 per year. Whilst engaging in
this work he continued to improve
his holding, clearing the ground acre
by acre in his spare time, and by
the end of 8 or 10 years had fenced
and cleared the whole of the block,
which was also divided into paddocks
for grazing purposes. With the
advent of the creameries and butter
factories, the turning in the long
lane was reached, and Mr. Horni-
brook is now able to live practically
on the fruits of his earlier years’
labour. After completing the
improvements on “Glenore,” he with
an eye to the future of his five sons,
purchased a property of 160 acres
lying about a mile distant from the
homestead, for which he gave £2 ss.
per acre, as against 2s. 6d. per acre
for the original holding. This place,
which is known as "Glenavon,” was
in its natural state of rough scrub
country, and again began the pro-
gramme of pioneering, until at
length the rich soil was turned over
and cultivation and grazing pad-
docks took the place of the wild
bush. The country about "Glen-
avon” is composed of fertile flats,
covered with alluvial soil and pasture
land which produces grasses of highly-
nutritious quality. The sandy and
chocolate loam is favourable to the
growth of many species of fruits,
and Mr. Hornibrook, who was the
first settler, now values his holding
at £l3 per acre. For many years he
has bred his own cattle and horses,
and has a number of fine Berkshire
pigs, which he sends to the Murar-
rie Bacon Co-operative Company, of
which, as also of the Caboolture
Butter Factory, he is a shareholder.
After residing at “Glenavon” for a
few years, he removed to Brisbane,
letting his two estates to farmers who
are working them on the share system,
Mr. Hornibrook still owning all the
stock on both farms. From time to
time he visits his properties, and
continues the work of improvement
wherever he perceives the opportu-
nity of a judicious expenditure of


capital for further future remunera-
tion. He has accepted the responsi-
bility of public office from time to
time, being a Justice of the Peace,
a member of the local school board,
and for some time served as presid-
ing officer in connection with both
Federal and State elections in the
district. He was also a member of
the Nambour Masonic Lodge, Q.C.
Mr. Hornibrook married Amy
Isabel, daughter of Mr. William
Mitchell, of New Boston, Connecti-
cut, U.S.A., and has five sons, who
are being educated for various pro-
fessions. Of these, Lionel Stanley,
the third son, manifests a keen
interest in his father's properties,
and is desirous of training in the
necessary directions to fit him for
taking over the management at a
later period. At present he is at
the Queensland Agricultural College,
Brisbane, with a view to equipping
himself with a complete knowledge
of pastoral work both from a prac-
tical and theoretical standpoint.
The eldest son, James Harold, hav-
ing fully qualified for the profession
of electrical engineering, is now

CAPTAIN GEORGE SMITH.
Carlyle held that the age of romance,
so far from being ended, has not
even perceptibly diminished. Only
the environment and the characters

have changed. The great essayist’s
words might well apply to the his-
tory of the various States of Aus-
tralia, though countless examples of
noble effort and fine achievement, of
superb courage and endurance, well
calculated to inspire the pen of
novelist or poet, pass, unrecorded,
with the lives of the men who
created them—men who toiled amid
such scenes as Essex Evans has por-
trayed in his fine poem, “The
Nation Builders.” Many such
men are to be found among the
pioneer squatters and settlers, many
among the old pioneer timber-
getters, and others among the
pioneer prospectors. Among the
more romantic of the country’s
industries is that followed by the
pearl-sheller. The history of North
Queensland and Western Australian
pearl-shelling, with all its terrible
tragedies and weirdly dramatic
scenes, would certainly read like
a romance. Of the men whose
names must be honourably and
permanently associated with the
history of pearl-shelling is that of
Captain George Smith, now (in
1921) living in retirement at “Wara-
benia,” Darling Point, Sydney.
He is a Sydney native, having been
born at Woollahra on March 27,
1857, his father, David Milne Smith,
having come to Australia from
Scotland in 1840, being a brother
of Captain Charles Smith, of the old
time-honoured firm of McDonald,
Smith, & Co. Captain George Smith
was educated in Sydney. In early
manhood, while in business there he
became interested in pearl-shelling,
in 1879, at the age of 22, contract-
ing a partnership with Captain
James Rickenson. He remained
in Sydney until 1882, when his
partner left Thursday Island to go
pearling on the coast of Western Aus-
tralia. He then went to take charge
of all their pearling interests in
Thursday Island, and built a pearling
station on Prince of Wales Island,
which remained his headquarters until
Captain Rickenson was murdered by
the blacks in Pearl Bay, Western
Australia, on May 24, 1884. Prince
of Wales was the island from whose
blacks the white woman, Barbara
Thompson, was rescued by H.M.S.
“Rattlesnake” in the year 1847.
In 1885 Captain Smith joined Mr.
James Clark, and the two became
the pioneers of Ninety-mile Beach
on the western coastline of Aus-
tralia, and found the first shell there
in 1886. Mr. James Clark married a
sister of Captain Smith, and Mrs.
Clark and Mrs. Smith were the first
and only two white women in those
days to live at sea with their pearl-
shelling husbands, to accept all the
hardships, and brave all the dangers
inevitably attendant on a life on the
ocean wave, on those storm-swept
seas of tropic Western Australia
where for the three most dangerous
months of the year the pearl-
shell fleets remain carefully in
sheltered bays until fine weather
returns, though intermittent storms
may be met in any month of the
year. In pearling on the western
coast the partners, Mr. James
Clark and Captain Smith, employed
aborigines, Japanese, Manilla men,
and Malays. In 1891 Captain
Smith returned to Thursday Island
and remained there from 1891 to
April 1905, at a time when labour
troubles and the action of the
Government so disgusted the
pearling men that they got a lease
of the Aroe Islands from the Dutch
Government, and Mr. Clark left for
there with the schooner “Alice,”
being followed by the “Sketty Belle”
in charge of Captain Smith, with
Captain W. Field Porter; the
“Ariel,” in charge of Captain
Duncan and Messrs. E. and H. B.
Munro; the “Wanetta,” in charge of
Captain Ferguson and Mr. Reg.
Hockings; the “Torres,” in charge
of Mr. Vincent Jessup and
Captain George Pym, who was
afterwards lost in the trawler
“Endeavour”; and the “Dario,” in
charge of Captain Thom and Mr.
W. M. Hayne, the combined fleets
representing 125 boats and about
800 men, more than half the
whole pearling fleet and crews of
Thursday Island, and, needless to
say, the effect on the trade of that
lone outpost of the north was not
beneficial. During his stay there
Captain Smith was a very active
citizen, being president of the
Hospital and organiser of the
Garrison Battery of which he became
captain, and remained in command
until he left in 1905 on a trip to
England. He had been equally
active in the interests of Broome
during his sojourn there, and was
present at the first landing of the
cable at Broome from Banjoewangi.
The “Sketty Belle” reef is named
after his old schooner, and the cap-
tain is responsible for the names of
many reefs on the charts of the
north. He has done much, both
directly and indirectly, for the in-
dustry to which he has devoted the
greater part of his life, to his efforts

Smith approached the Home authori-

brought before the House of Com-
mons, was the cause of Sir Malcolm
Fraser being sent to visit Roebuck
Bay (now Broome), where a confer-
ence was held on board the revenue
schooner “Meda” and an appeal
made by Captain Smith on behalf
of the pearlers which secured an
amicable settlement that was satis-
factory to all concerned. In the year
1906 Mrs. Smith went to reside in
Sydney, where she was joined two
years later by Captain Smith, who
retired from active connection with
the pearling industry in 1907,
possible to those who personify the
best types of wifehood and mother-
hood. Some idea of the difficulties
and hardships which she shared with
her husband may be gleaned by con-
sideration of the climatic conditions
under which Captain Smith’s calling
was pursued, when it may be said
that few white women in Australia
have passed through similar experi-
ences. The western coast is liable
to terrible storms and cyclones, such
as the old Norsemen never wit-
nessed in their oar-rowed galleys,
that would not have lived an hour
opportunities have lacked. On re-
tiring from the sea Captain Smith
invested in the pastoral industry,
purchasing a Queensland property,
the well-known “Landsborough
Downs” Station, in the Hughenden
district, now managed by his eldest
son, Mr. George Clark Smith, who
married Miss Catherine Fraser, a
daughter of Mr. Frank Fraser,
merchant, of Ingham, a very well
and favourably-known North Queens-
lander. One other son, V. Wyben
Smith, who is managing “Eusay”
Station, and one daughter, are the
though he retained his share in the
Aroe Island speculation, which was
paying handsomely. After many
years, spent chiefly in Sydney, amid
scenes affording a strong contrast to
those of her earlier life, Mrs. Smith
passed away, the date of her decease
being February 26, 1921. For ten
years she made her home with her
husband on the schooner “Sketty
Belle,” sharing his strenuous experi-
ences in the pearling industry, and

of their married life, by her moral
and practical support, her unfailing

part of Australia and the north-
eastern coast of Queensland, periodic-
ally. Despite the fact that they
were so far removed from the busy
centres of civilization, Captain and
Mrs. Smith were able to provide
their sea-going home with many
comforts. They had the benefit of a
good library and were close observers
and attentive readers, besides being
expert photographers, and thus their
children, who lived on board the
“Sketty Belle” until old enough to
be sent to school in Sydney, had
advantages in the way of culture

WILLIAM DAVID COLMAN,
J.P., Barcaldine, was born at
Bendigo, Victoria, on January 1,
1869, and is the eldest son of the
late William D. Colman, a native of
MR. W. D. COLMAN, SEN.
Tasmania, and a descendant of an
old English family, the grandfather
of the gentleman under review
having arrived in Australia with the
first free settlers from the Old
World a century ago. That gentle-
man lived in the Apple Isle for a
period, but subsequently came to
Victoria and was amongst the
agrarian pioneers of the then colony,
where he died at the age of eighty-
six. His son, the late William D.
Colman, mentioned above, was
born in Tasmania, and was engaged
in farming, carrying, and mining
pursuits in the stirring days when
the country’s nationhood was form-
ing, having been present at the
famous Ballarat Stockade riots and
witnessed other notable events in
the history-making of the sister
State. He subsequently came to
Queensland and became a cattleman,
carrying on grazing avocations on
the Darling, and was later associated
with Mr. John Hope (also deceased)
in similar pursuits, bringing out a
mob of cattle to stock “Kerongola”
Station in the early seventies and
managing the property for several
years. In the early eighties he went
to “Connemara” Station, near Win-
dorah, as manager, filling the post
for a few years, and eventually
drifted into retirement at Barcal-
dine, where he lived with his son,
the subject of this memoir, until
his death, which occurred in the year
1918 at the age of seventy-eight. He
was survived by two sons and a
daughter, the younger son, James,
being at time of writing engaged in
the business which is now carried on
by his brother in Barcaldine. On
the conclusion of his education, which
was conducted in Victoria, Mr.
William David Colman became
engaged in stock and station work
on “Connemara” under the super-
vision of his father and later under
subsequent managers, remaining on
this property for seventeen years,
during which period his work
covered the whole gamut of pastoral
experience from his initiation as a
jackaroo until his appointment to
the managership of the property, a
post which he occupied all through
the historic drought which lasted in
that locality from 1899 to 1904. He
later severed his connection with the
above-mentioned station and opened
a butchering establishment at Bar-
caldine, which he has carried on ever
since. Within a few years of the
establishment of this concern he
turned his attention to the pastoral
industry, purchasing in the first
instance “Valley Downs” Station,
near Barcaldine. Subsequently he
purchased the “Alice River Settle-
ment” holding, the latter acquire-
ment having been at one time the
property of several socialistic ideal-
ists, and devoted to the propogation
of a scheme which, by its failure,
has afforded another proof that the
time is not yet ripe for the promo-
tion of such ideals. The extent of

respects proved himself a public-
spirited man. For some time he
was a member of the Barcoo Shire
Council, and at time of writing
is a committeeman of the Bar-
caldine Hospital. He is a keen
sportsman and a supporter of the
local turf, being a member of the
Barcaldine Central Race Club corn-
mittee. He is prominently identified
with the local lodge of Freemasons
and has filled various offices in the
craft, being a pastmaster of Lodge
Comet, E.C. He married in the
year 1906, and has a family of three
sons and three daughters.

GEORGE FOOTE, “Mount Plea-
sant,’' Tambo, was born at Dalby,
Queensland, on July 6, 1872. He is
a son of the late George Foote, one
of the very earliest of Queensland's
MR. G. FOOTE, SEN.
pioneers, both tire father and the
grandfather of the gentleman under
review (the former being then but a
lad), having arrived in the Moreton
Bay district, as Queensland was then
known, considerably over 60 years
ago, the founder of the family in
Australia having left the old land
with the view of starting life under
more promising conditions in a new
country. The family hailed from
Somersetshire, England, where they
had been engaged in agrarian pur-
suits, and on arrival in Australia
followed various avocations con-
nected with the bush, the sons, in-
cluding the late Mr. George Foote,
being subsequently identified with
the farming industry. The latter
gentleman was also well known as
a carrier in the far west of Queens-
land, as the district surrounding
Tambo was then designated, and for
a considerable time held a farm on
the Darling Downs. He was among
the early settlers in the Charleville
district at the time when the system
of cutting up the latter estates was
initiated. The late Mr. George
Foote joined the Great Majority in
the year 1915, at the age of 72.
During his lifetime he earned the
reputation of being an honest, hard-
working settler, a good neighbour,
and a worthy pioneer. The memory
of his efforts will live as an example
and an encouragement to succeeding
generations of his race. The subject
of our memoir received his education
at the State School, Tambo, and on
its conclusion was employed for a
time on his father’s farm. On the
attainment of his 17th year, how-
ever, he obtained work in connection
with "Landsdowne” Station, near
Tambo, where he secured employ-
ment as a teamster and carrier. He
followed this calling for 14 years,
subsequently owning the teams
which he had worked for so long on
behalf of the proprietors of the above
station. Eventually, while still in
his early thirties, by dint of thrift
and industry of no mean order, he
was in a position to enter the grazing
industry on his own account, acquir-
ing his present homestead area, a
selection of 20,000 acres. He
immediately took up his residence on
the property, building his home
and proceeding with the necessary
development. "Mount Pleasant,”
which was formerly included in the
resumption of “Tambo” Station, is
devoted to both sheep and cattle,
and as a mixed proposition has
proved a very successful venture. The
run is composed of good downs and
forest country bearing gidya, briga-
low, box and other timbers, being
well grassed and amply watered by
dams, the construction of the latter
being the personal work of Mr.
Foote. The homestead, which is con-
veniently situated at a distance of
10 miles from Tambo, is comfort-
able and up-to-date. Since his
acquirement of “Mount Pleasant,”
and notwithstanding the duties con-
nected with its administration, he
has found time to render useful ser-
vice to the district, having taken his
part in all matters connected with
its welfare. For some time oast he
has been a member of the Tambo
Shire Council, of which he has

months, and for a period was
chairman of the local hospital, and
lends his assistance to all bodies in-
stituted for the advancement of the
district and community. He is also
a supporter of the local racing
events, and all other forms of clean
sport. He married in the year 1897,
Margaret Frances, daughter of Mr.

South Wales, on May 13, 1863. He
is the third surviving son of the late
Charles Alphonse Massey, who made
his advent to the young continent
three-quarters of a century ago. Mr.
C. A. Massey first visited New
MR. G. MASEEY, SEN.
Zealand, where he remained for a
brief period, eventually sailing to
the Mother Colony of Australia
and making the acquaintance of
Sir Terence Albury Murray, a
well-known pastoral pioneer of New
South Wales, and at that time
owner of “Wind redeem” and
“Yarralumbla” Stations, for whom
he carried an introductory letter
from England. The meeting
resulted in the appointment of the
late Mr. Massey to a post on
“Windredeen” Station, where he
spent about two years in the
capacity of jackaroo, being promoted
to the overseership of Sir Terence A.
Murray’s two properties at the end
of that period. He faithfully carried
out the duties of his position, in the
meantime acquiring an experimental
knowledge of stock and accumulat-
ing the capital destined to accom-
plish his entry into the industry on
his own behalf. His first individual
venture was in a property of some

3,000 acres on the Yass River, near
Gundaroo, called “Fairfield.” By
the later purchase of “Bairnsdale,”
“Estermead,” and another property,
which here-named “Stoneville”—all
of which were amalgamated with his
earlier acquisition—he became the
owner of over 13,000 acres of free-
hold grazing and agricultural land,
which he devoted to the breeding of
stud cattle and horses and of cross-
bred sheep, conducting operations
thereon until the time of his death,
when the property was purchased by
the late Patrick Osborne. Mr.
Charles A. Massey was one of the
most popular pastoralists of his time
and figured prominently in the
industry, his reputation as an expert
in all matters relating to stock
having resulted in his appointment
as judge of blood stock, cattle, and
crossbred sheep at the Sydney Royal
Show. He left a family of four sons

engage in any particular calling, but
a year later, in 1881, he came to
Queensland to join his brothers, the
late Charles Eyre Massey and Mr.
O. H. Massey, at “Sonoma,” a cattle
property owned by them in the
vicinity of Bowen. He remained on
“Sonoma” for about a year, at the
end of which time, in company with
the late C. Eyre Massey, he started
with a mob of breeders numbering
about 1,000 head with the view of
taking up land on the Lynd, a river
which junctions with the Mitchell.
On their arrival, however, they
learned that the country had been
already selected by a Gulf pioneer,
Mr. E. Bostock, and their next
thought was to obtain pasturage for
their herd during the wet season
which was then advancing. This
was secured on “Wrotham Park” by
the courteous acquiescence of the
owners, Messrs. Henderson and
Skene. During the period that the
cattle remained on the run in charge
of Mr. G. Massey, Mr. C. Eyre
Massey made a tour of inspection
down the Mitchell and Palmer
Rivers and over the Staaten River
Valley, becoming conversant with
the geographical features of that
portion of the country and of its
possibilities from a pastoral view-
point. When the roads were again
traversable the brothers mustered
their stock and continued their
journey to the Far North, eventually
arriving at the Stuart River, where
they took up country lying between
eight and nine hundred miles from
the point from which they had
started. This land is now known as
“Silver Plains,” and is owned by
the Government of Queensland, the
Messrs. Massey having abandoned it
on their acquirement of better
country to the west-north-west, where
their stock was removed and to
which was given the name of
“Rokeby.” To this property they
devoted many strenuous years, and
all honour should be accorded to
the gentleman under review and his
two brothers and to men of similar
calibre for the pioneering work
which they accomplished in the out-
back spaces of our vast continent,
and which will probably fail to
receive due recognition until the
advent of a later generation, who,
while enjoying the advantages and
luxuries of civilization where are
now to be found but the bare
necessaries of life, will be enabled by
a better sense of perspective to

Residing at a distance of 100 miles
from the nearest neighbour, lacking
postal and telegraphic facilities,
their only means of procuring stores
being by pack-horse from Cooktown,
over a distance of 240 miles, at a
cost of £35 per ton, they sturdily
faced floods and droughts and the
financial institutions. The numerous
and unfriendly natives were not the
least of their troubles. Unrestrained
through lack of police force, they
constantly killed and harassed the
stock and menaced the lives of the
settlers, and in the efforts of the
brothers to check the marauders by
dispersing a troublesome mob, the
elder of the two, Charles Eyre, was
fatally wounded, a barbed spear
having entered his back and become
so imbedded in the flesh and muscles

memory is perpetuated in the land-
marks which bear his name —Massey’s
Spur, on the Mcllwraith Range, and
the Massey River, north of the
Stuart River, which finds an outlet
in the Pacific Ocean, having both
been called after the fine bushman
whose labours in the Far North met
with so tragic a termination, and
whose name deserves to be handed
down as that of a pioneer whose
work and sacrifices demand recog-
nition from future generations.
“Rokeby” Station is situated about
240 miles north-west from Cooktown,
on the Coen River, Cape York
Peninsula. Though Cooktown is the
natural port the brothers soon saw
the advisability of opening a road
to the Stuart River mouth, where a
landing was constructed. To this
point stores are now conveyed from
Cooktown and taken 90 miles to the
station by teams of pack horses at a
cost of £lO per ton as against £35
per ton on the original route
according to prevailing rates, while
in earlier days a still more substan-
tial saving was effected. The action

with sand ridges. Bloodwood flour-

patches of the volcanic country bear
bauhinia, the remainder being

Australia. Both the Coen and
Archer Rivers flow through the

Mr. Glenville Massey proceeded to
Thursday Island and there estab-
lished a butchering business, which
he conducted on his own behalf for
the following fourteen years, and
which, though affording a means of
absorbing the “Rokeby” stock was
in no way identified with the
partnership of the brothers. At the
termination of the above-mentioned
period this butchering business was
floated into a limited company with
the title of “The Torres Straits

which concern he still retains an
interest. In the meantime the firm

1807 Jessie, daughter of the late
James Ilall-Scott, a pioneer of the
Bowen district, who was well known
for his sterling character and
honourable dealings both through-
out Northern and Southern Queens-
land. He was one of the first
to introduce sheep into the
Bowen district and was the
founder of “Woodhouse,” on

found to yield very satisfactory
results in the Peninsula. Most of
the stock are sent to Cape York for

Mr. Glenville Massey retired from
North Queensland and took up his

minently identified with the pastoral
industry in Central Queensland.

earliest pioneers of the then Colony.
The Millers are of Scottish origin, and
descended from a line which has been
domiciled in Glasgow for several
generations, many of its members
achieving prominence in professional
life and in the arena of commerce.
The late Alexander Miller was a
member of the legal fraternity,
having practised in Scotland
before his departure from the Old
World to the land of the Southern
Cross. After his arrival he became
associated with the leading pastoral-
ists of the day, devoting himself to
the pioneering of the great industry
which was destined to ensure the
future prosperity of the island con-

decease his widow retained possession
of the station, whilst his two sons
and three daughters invested the
money derived from the sale of their
interests in the estate in a property
called “Murrabit,” also situated in
Victoria. Owing to adverse seasons,
however, the result of this venture
proved disastrous, some £40,000 in
capital being lost to the late Mr.
John Miller (the father of the gentle-
man under review) and his brother
and sisters, and as a consequence of
this reverse Mr. John Miller took
over the management of “Kulkyne”
Station, on the River Murray, then
owned by the late Hon. Henry
Miller. He was occupied with the
conduct of that property for a period
of six years, and subsequently

of jackaroo at “Coreena” Station, in
the vicinity of Aramac. In the year
1893 he was appointed to the post
of second overseer, carrying out the
work connected therewith with such
complete satisfaction to his employers
that two years later he was promoted
to the overseership, and the ability
with which he discharged the duties
of this position led to his being
chosen to exercise managerial control
of this important estate in the year
1897. “Coreena” at that time em-
braced an area of nearly 800 square
miles, and carried 155,000 sheep and
4,000 head of cattle. His rapid
advancement and the occupation of
so responsible a post while yet in his
middle twenties in itself indicates the
high administrative powers and
natural adaptability possessed by
Mr. Miller. Since his appointment
to the managership of “Coreena” he
has continued in the successful con-
duct of the affairs of the station for
a period exceeding 21 years, retain-
ing the confidence of his principals
through serious droughts and other
adverse circumstances, and demon-
strating by results the value of his
knowledge of the pastoral industry
in all its details. His eldest brother,
Mr. Howard Ernest Miller, who also
received his education at the Rock-
hampton Grammar School, was sub-
sequently engaged in the motor and
cycle trade at Rockhampton for
several years. Owing to failing
health, however, he eventually put
city life behind him, and acting on
the advice of his brothers proceeded
westwards, securing in conjunction
with them the “Murrabit” pro-
perty, previously a portion of
Coreena Station, which had been
resumed about that time. Mr. John
Graham Miller, the youngest mem-
ber of the firm, was born in 1879,
and joined his brother’s staff at
‘Coreena” in his twentieth year,
gaining his first experimental know-
ledge of sheep on this station. He
had previously spent a couple of
years amongst cattle under his father
at “Allandale.” In the year 1903
the firm of Miller Bros, was estab-
lished. Combining their resources,
the brothers proceeded to add to
their original acquirement, taking up
“Mildura” in the year mentioned,
which the youngest, Mr. J. G. Miller,
has personally managed since. “The

to Brixton Siding, and "Margot,”
which embraces some 10,000 acres,
were acquired at a later date, the
latter having been originally known
as "Dalgi,” receiving its more
recent name at the hands of the pre-
sent owners. The area of the four
properties aggregates over 80,000
acres, which are devoted to both
horned and woolly stock, sheep to
the number of 24,000 and about
1,500 cattle being usually grazed on
the different runs. "Murrabit”

as desert country is kept mainly as
a reserve or relief area, the other
propositions being typical of the best

incidental to the western climate.
Besides the properties above described
Messrs. Miller Bros, are interested
in a cattle proposition in the vicinity
of Mackay, in partnership with Mr.
R. J. McCullough. During the
lengthy term of his residence in Cen-
tral Queensland, Mr. Walter Cecil
Miller has been a prominent figure
in the public life of the district
wherein his lot is cast, and has
actively concerned himself in all
affairs tending to its advancement or
the welfare of th§ community of
which he is a member. For nearly
a decade he occupied a seat on the
Aramac Shire Council. He has been
of the Barcaldine Club. He married
in the year 1900 Jane, daughter of
the late Henry Cooper, of Victoria,
and a fellow-student of the late John
Miller at Scotch College, Melbourne.
He is later recorded as owner of the
historic "Talgai” Station on the
Dawson, and was associated through
ties of friendship with such old
pioneers of the romantic days of
Western Queensland as the late
Hon. John Murray and the late
John Arthur Macartney, sharing
with them and many others of
similar calibre the laurels of history-
making in those far-off days when
the great pastoral industry was
cradled in the vast interior of the
country in the district outlying
Barcaldine, and indeed may be
classed amongst the ideal pastoral
runs of Western Queensland. Devel-
opmental work has been pushed
ahead on each of the properties
owned by this enterprising firm, the
improvements in regard to water
conservation and fencing being up-

GEORGE ROBERT KEYES,
J.P., “Mount Norman” Station,

Wentworth Keyes, a pioneer of
English birth and descent who
arrived in Australia in the fifties,
ownership of “Woodstock,” a well-
known pastoral property near
Broken Hill, and of “Roseberth,”
near Birdsville, and later, as a
pioneer of the Northern Territory
and the first settler on the Roper
River. He took up country there
in conjunction with the late
Robert Christensen, one - time
owner of “Lammermoor” Station.
In common with the majority
of the men who braved the
vast wilderness of unopened terri-
tory in the early days he was
brought to the verge of financial
ruin by inadequate markets,
drought, and other adverse condi-
tions, facing with fine fortitude the
realization that the results of a
lifetime of unremitting and strenu-
ous effort were dissipated by cir-
cumstances beyond his control. The
declining years of his life were spent
at the home of his son, the subject
of this memoir, where he was rich
in the affection and respect of the
second and third generations of the
line which he had founded in the
land of the Southern Cross, meeting
death as the result of an accident
when in his eighty-fourth year.
Mr. George Robert Keyes, who is
is, an ancient one in Ireland, was
born at Bouligal, near Mossgiel,
New South Wales, on November
14, 1874. Before reaching his
teens, in consequence of the reverses
experienced by his father, he discon-
tinued his studies at the State school
in New South Wales, where such
scholastic knowledge as he then
possessed was gained, and obtained
work as a station hand on “Mount
Pool,” a property near Milparinka.
Here he spent five years, relinquish-
ing his post when at the age of
seventeen in order to enlarge his
outlook upon life, and with the
realization that a wider experience
of the pastoral conditions of his
native land would materially con-
duce to the success which he was
determined to win. Attracted by
the pastoral possibilities of North-
western Queensland, he accordingly
set out for this portion of the State,
spending a short period at “Kyabra”
Station, near Thargomindah, en
route, and subsequently securing a
billet as stock-keeper on “Richmond
Downs,” well known as one of the
early pastoral runs of the North-
west, and then owned by C. E.

the purchase of cattle from the old
“Byalong” herd which was broken
up in the year 1895, and took these
to the Woolgar goldfields. At that
centre the Messrs. Keyes engaged in
dealing operations, their interests
rapidly expanding and suggesting
the selection of grazing country on
the Norman River. In the year
1902, their first pastoral venture
having proved successful, they pur-
chased “Woodstock,” a property
already stocked and also situated on
the Norman. Shortly after acquir-
ing “Woodstock,” the second eldest
of the Messrs. Keyes was acci-
dentally killed while attending to
stock, and in consequence of this
bereavement the management of the
family affairs devolved upon the
gentleman under review. In course
of time the latter purchased the
interests of his remaining brothers,
the share of the youngest being
taken over by Mr. G. R. Keyes and
his then partner, Mr. W. Chaplin,
in 1910. In the same year Messrs.
Keyes and Chaplin sold out “Wood-
stock” and took up “Quilalar
Downs,” in the Cloncurry district,
which they stocked with 800 heifers
from the former property and an
additional 500 purchased from
“Eddington” Station, increasing
the sphere of their operations in
1914 by the purchase of “Rocky
Glen,” a run also lying in the
vicinity of Cloncurry. On a dis-
solution of partnership being agreed
upon in 1915, both “Quilalar
Downs” and “Rocky Glen” were
sold. Immediately after severing
his connection with Mr. Chaplin, Mr.
Keyes, in conjunction with his wife,
purchased the "Mount Norman”’
leases and an adjoining property
named "Middle Park” with its
stock, comprising 1,000 head of
cattle, the two properties embracing
350 square miles of fine cattle
country which is now stocked with
Shorthorns of a superior quality.
In the year 1917 Mr. Keyes took up
“Etheldale,” which covers 55,000
acres, formerly included in the area
resumed from “Saxby Downs/’ On
the acquirement of this property,
which he also devotes to a high class
herd of Shorthorns, he disposed of
part of his holding on the Woolgar.
Mr. Keyes is well known as a breeder
of blood horses, and from the time
of his occupation of the home
property has kept sires of a type
unrivalled in the North, the list
including “Strathmore,” by "Strife”
from "Oakleigh”; “Lord Kelpie,”
by "North Star” from “Dinette”;
"Miltiades,” by “Eridspord” from
“Umilta”; and the famous “King’s
Scholar” (imp.), by “Your Majesty”
from “Don’s Birthday,” a "Dono-
van” mare. His judgment in horse-
flesh naturally results in a keen
predilection for the sport of kings,
and his colours (red, white and blue
—blue and white cap) have fre-
quently been borne to victory, such
events as the Richmond Downs
Bracelet, the Cloncurry Cup, and
the Milohester and Flying Handi-
caps won with “Lamplight,”
‘ L- K.” (bred by the owner), and
"King’s Scholar,” respectively,
standing out amongst scores of
lesser events won by the “Mount
Norman horses. Among the wins
placed to the credit of "Miltiades,”
who was formerly owned by Sir
Rupert Clarke, is the South
Australian Derby. Mr. Keyes is a
member of the Townsville Amateur
Jockey Club and the Clutha Picnic
Race Club. He has exercised
(magisterial duties since the first; year
of the present century, having been
gazetted a Justice of the Peace by
the Liberal Administration. In the
year 1907 lie married Mary Ethel,
daughter of Mrs. and Mrs. William
Chaplin, a native of New South
Wales. Of the union there is a family
of two sons and one daughter.

progenitors have been prominent in
the wars waged by the Empire,
practically ever since its rise as one
of the Great Powers of Europe.
Among the earliest Parliamentary
records extant there is mention of a
charter granted by Henry 111. to
the town of Smitterley, in Norfolk,
the name of which was changed to
Blakeney in consideration of services
rendered by one John de Blakeney
to the State in 1258. In 1341 a
Roger Blakeney was member for
Great Yarmouth in the British
Parliament, and in 1447 a John
Blakeney represented Norfolk, and
subsequently East Grimstead, whilst
in the Irish Parliament the name
appears almost continuously from
1613 until the repeal of the Union
in 1801. In the reign of Queen
Elizabeth the family had land
granted to it in Ireland in recog-
nition of national deeds, and one of
its members —Thomas—married a
niece of Lord Chancellor Hatton,
and settled in the South of Ireland,
while another—Henry —made his
home at Castle Blakeney, in the
West. The connection was also
represented in the Church, John
Blakeney, Rector and Squire of
Bodham, Norfolk, flourishing in the
fourteenth century, Thomas, Dean
of Roscommon, in the eighteenth,
and John Edward Blakeney, Vicar
and Archdeacon of Sheffield, Canon
of York, and Chaplain in Ordinary
to Queen Victoria, in the nineteenth
century. One of the most distin-
guished ancestors of Mr. Blakeney
was William, Lord Blakeney, born
at Mount Blakeney in 1672, whose
father for many years was member
for Kilmarnock in the Irish House
of Commons, whilst his son later
joined the British Army and served
through several campaigns under the
Duke of Marlborough, rising to the
rank of General in 1741. He held
Stirling Castle during the Rebellion
of the Pretender, and put him with
his forces to flight after a decisive
battle on the plains below the Castle.
He was appointed Governor of
Minorca by George 11.,wh0 bestowed
upon him the Order of Knight of
the Bath and created him a Baron
under the title of Lord Blakeney, of
Mount Blakeney. He is buried in
Westminster Abbey. In subsequent
years another illustrious member of
the same family was Sir Edward
Blakeney, who was Commander of
the Forces in Ireland. Coming down
to modern times we have to place
on record that two brothers of the
gentleman under review fought in
the Great World-War as colonels in
the regular Army, the elder (Edward
John) being in charge of motor
transport, while the younger
(Herbert Norwood) served with
distinction at the Battle of Mons,
where he was severely wounded.

was born at Fort Beaufort, Orange
River Colony, South Africa, where
his father was stationed as a military


officer, and received his education at
the various centres to which the
late veteran removed in pursuance
of his military duties. His principal
college was that of St. Elizabeth, at
"MANGALORE” HOMESTEAD.
Guernsey, in the Channel Islands.
He was designed by his father for
the Army, but whilst still in his
teens turned his attentive ear to
tales of the possibilities of a brilliant
future for young men of energy and
enterprise in Australia, and even-
tually elected to test his fortune in
the land of the Southern Cross,
arriving in Queensland in 1886.
Ultimately he devoted his attention
entirely to land survey work, and
during the quarter of a century in
which he has followed his profession
he has become a most important
factor in the closer settlement of
many of the largest pastoral areas
in the west and south, such estates
as “Tabragalba” and “Colinton”
being among those with the subdi-
vision of which he took a prominent
part. In the far-back blocks he cut
up practically the whole of the
south-west, and apart altogether
from this work his name will be
handed down to history in connection
with other important surveys, in-
cluding road routes and the boun-
daries for rabbit-proof fences, the
results of which appear on the early
maps of Queensland. In the late
nineties he became personally in-
terested in land-ownership, purchas-
ing a farm on the “Westbrook”
Estate, near Toowoomba, which he
still owns, and in 1912 he became
the possessor of the block on which
the old “Mangalore” homestead had
been erected which he has since
made his home. This is well known as
one of the most historic homesteads
GG
in the far west, being believed
to be the property to which the first
flock of sheep was sent in that part
of the State, and possessing the
earliest woolshed ever erected there.
The homestead block owned by Mr.
Blakeney and retaining the old name
covers about 20,000 acres, with six
miles frontage to the Warrego River,
which has never been known to run
dry at this part of its course, its
largest waterhole being in the
vicinity of the homestead. The soil
is chiefly a light sandy loam, and
on the river frontage lie open gidya

distant from the homestead, adding
materially in the expeditious tran-
saction of business. Merino sheep

draught horses and useful station
hacks are bred for the work of the

GEORGE KERMODE JEF-
FREY, of “Blairmore” Station,
near Wetheron, was born at “Min-
goola,” Queensland, in the year
1876, and is the son of Peter Jeffrey,
the owner of the latter station. The
last-named gentleman is a son of the
late George Jeffrey, who was an
officer in the British Army, and who
purchased a property known as
“Blairmore,” on the Hunter River,
in New South Wales. Mr. Peter
Jeffrey married Miss Margaret Ker-
mode, a descendant of a very old and
distinguished family which settled at
“Mona Vale,” near Douglas, Isle of
Man, many centuries ago. Associated
with Mr. G. K. Jeffrey, the subject
of the present article, in the proprie-
torship of “Cracow” Station, was
his brother Norman, who joined the
A.I.F. and was killed at Gallipoli in
1916; also Mr. Arthur Jeffrey, who
took his own motor ambulance car to
Europe and joined the French Red
Cross (1916). He saw two years’
service, most of the time being
stationed at Verdun, where he was
engaged in front-line ambulance
work. He was specially mentioned
by one of the great French Generals
for coolness and quickness and for
his absolute disregard of danger.
Was awarded the Croix de Guerre
and later two bars. Mr. A.
Jeffrey was invalided to Australia
early in 1918, and died in July of
that year. He was married in 1908
to Miss Daisy McLeod, of “Terrica”
Station, the result of the union being
two sons—Roderick and Peter. Mr.
G. K. Jeffrey was educated first
at Coerwull Academy, New South
Wales, finishing his scholastic car-
eer at Newington College, New
South Wales. After leaving the
latter institution he returned to the
parental home at “Mingoola” Sta-
tion, where under the guidance of
his father he became an expert
cattleman. This branch of his
education filled a period of four
years, which were followed by two
years spent in acquiring experience
of sheep-breeding and wool-growing
at “Nive Downs” Station” in Cen-
tral Queensland. The experience
gained in this way was not super-
ficial in any sense, but embraced
practical familiarity with each de-
tail in the work of administering
large pastoral properties. Taking a
keen interest in the industry, which
already had brought success to his
father, the young man had spared
no pains in thoroughly equipping
himself with technical skill in apply-
ing modern methods. Returning to
“Mingoola,” Mr. Jeffrey helped his
father to fight through the terrible
drought of 1902, which is recognized
as having been the most severe trial
ever placed upon the pastoral busi-
ness of the North-Eastern State, with
the possible exception of that of
1915. It was during the former
period of climatic adversity that the
total stock in Queensland was re-
duced by actual deaths from starva-
tion to less than half their former
numbers. Much of the country had
been reduced to barren waste, over
hundreds of miles not a blade of
herbage was to be seen, and water
supplies were giving out in all
directions. The severe times experi-
enced led to many runs being thrown
upon the market in Queensland.
Some had been so denuded of stock
that the owners were quite incapable
of carrying on. Banks and other
financial institutions had foreclosed
upon others, which they were
anxious to realize upon as soon as
an opportunity presented itself for
securing back the money originally
advanced, or in many instances a
portion of the loans. Other holdings
had been resolutely abandoned. Mr.
Jeffrey purchased “Cracow” Station,
on the Dawson River, in 1903. In
taking over the control of “Cracow”
he was undertaking a task of no
mean magnitude. Cattle yards and

John A. Richardson was still a
lad in his teens when he landed in
Victoria, but he was destined to take
a prominent part in the development
of the pastoral industry in his
adopted country. During his subse-
quent career he was associated with
such prominent Victorian pastoralists
as the Armytages, Mcßeans, and
John Benn. He acted as manager
of “Coobart” Station for the last-
named gentleman who was an historic
character in the very early days of
the then Colony. Having accumu-
lated considerable capital, in the
year 1882, he purchased the freehold
of a property situated south of
Melbouxme, which he worked as a
grazing proposition for some years.
When the great land boom was at its
zenith he sold the holding, but before
payment fell due a heavy deprecia-
tion in land values set in, which
ultimately brought about the finan-
cial crisis from which Australia
suffered so severely in the early
nineties. This spelt ruin for Mr. J.
A. Richardson, but, undaunted by
this severe reverse, he set about to
retrieve his fortunes, accepting the
management of a station in the
neighbouring colony of New South
Wales. Subsequently he was engaged
classer on several properties in the
Northern State, chiefly owned by the
late Hurtle Fisher, the Australian
Pastoral Co., and the Peel River Co.
He left a family of three sons and

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


The only daughter became the
wife of Mr. McKail, who resided
in New Soutli Wales. Mr.
J. G. Richardson received his
primary education at South Yarra,
Victoria, completing his scholastic
studies at Carlton College, in the
same colony. Following the heavy
losses sustained by his father, he
determined to strike out for himself,
and accepted a position as jackaroo
on “Berry Bank” Station, in the
Western district of Victoria, where
he remained for a couple of years.
At the end of this period he became
engaged in droving, travelling both
sheep and cattle on the roads of
Victoria and New South Wales, and
during the two years spent in this
connection gained a large store of
experience which has proved of great
value to him in his subsequent
career. He next worked as jackaroo
on “Mount Hutton” Station, under
the late James Broad, after three or
four years severing this connection in
order to accept a similar position on
“Glen Erne” Station, in the vicinity
of St. George, owned by the late
Hurtle Fisher. During the years
spent on this property he became
familiar with the various phases of
the pastoral industry, but in order to
further improve his knowledge of
stock raising, he became overseer on
“Barcaldine Downs” Station, then
under the management of Mr. H. J.
Scaly. Here he remained until the
year 1900, when lie was promoted to
the management of “Peak Downs”
Station, where he continued for five
years, during which time he also
assisted in the management of the
famous “Peak Downs” sheep stud.
His reign of management at “Peak
Downs” was marked by the great
drought of 1901-2, which decimated
the stock and havoc with the
surrounding country. Mr. Richard-
son entered the pastoral industry on
his own account in 1905, by the
purchase of “Emerald Downs,” in
the vicinity of the town of Emerald,
from Mr. Donald Wallace, one of the
pioneers of the district. He immed-
iately inaugurated a scheme of
developmental work, and during the
three years which he remained on
the property effected many improve-
ments. Disposing of “Emerald
Downs” toward the end of the year
1908 he returned to Western Queens-
land, and with Mr. J. E. Grice took
up a block of land which formerly
was included in the “Saltern Creek”
area, to which the name of “Ascot

purchased his share and became
sole proprietor. In 1916 he relin-
quished the management of “Darr
River Downs,” and thenceforward
devoted his energies to the conduct
of affairs on his own property.
"Ascot Downs” embraces an area of
over 25,000 acres of country, which
for grazing purposes is equal to any
in the Commonwealth. It is charac-
terized by well-shaded rolling downs,
timbered chiefly by boree and gidya,
though whitewood also flourishes.
Mitchell and blue grasses put forth a
prolific growth; and in a favourable
winter when copious rains are experi-
enced, a sturdy growth of herbage
makes its appearance. The lack of
rain is not altogether responsible for
the seasonal shortages of this
excellent fodder, as to a great extent
the luxuriant growth of grass which
clothes the face of the downs in
ordinary good seasons, prevents other
vegetation from making much head-
way. The "Ascot Downs” property
is subdivided into seven paddocks,
and about fifty miles of fencing has
been erected. The important matter
of water conservation has received
due attention, the stock being well
supplied by the output of four
sub-artesian bores. The homestead is
a picturesque building set in the
middle of verdant lawns and well laid
out flower beds, to the tending of
which Mrs. Richardson devotes much
of her leisure. Both the host and
hostess at “Ascot Downs” are noted
for their delightful hospitality and
a visit to their home is a pleasurable
experience not easily to be forgotten.
Mr. Richardson is a genuine sports-
man ; horse-racing, perhaps, being
his favourite pastime. He is a
member of both the Barcaldine and
Longreach Race Clubs, holding a
seat on the committee of the latter
body. Be is also a committeeman of
the Barcaldine Pastoral and
Agricultural Show Society, and is
connected with the various other
local institutions having as their
object the advancement of the town
and district. His name is included
in the membership lists of the
Rockhampton, Barcaldine, and Long-
reach Clubs. He married in the year

of returned travellers and glowing
newspaper accounts Mr. William
Dennis, when at the age of nineteen,
had come to regard seriously the
possibilities of life in the youngest
of the continents, and realizing that
the limited areas available for cultiv-
ation in the Old Land allowed very
little scope for enterprise, he decided
that he would try his luck abroad.
He set out for Australia in the year
1874 by the sailing ship “Indus,”
and after a voyage of 109 days
landed in Brisbane, being then
twenty years old. Shortly after his
arrival he secured a post on a selec-

he realized that a better return
should be forthcoming for the labour
output of a healthy, able-bodied
young man, and therefore, before
completing his first year in the
country he became employed in well-
sinking. As his knowledge of the
conditions of the country grew he
obtained a post with a droving staff,
and for the ensuing three years was
engaged in travelling stock over the
routes connecting Central and
Southern Queensland. After com-
pleting a trip as second in charge
of a mob of mixed cattle despatched
from “Hornet Bank,” near Taroom,
to “Maxwelton,” on the Flinders
River, he worked for a year at
“Beaufort” as horse-breaker, this
being in the late seventies, and from
then onwards he worked on different
stations, becoming familiar with
every phase of the industry during
the years that followed, and eventu-

resigned his position at “Lanark”
and purchased a share in “Epping

entered upon the management. His
partner in the property was the late

practically lacking in modern im-
provements on his advent as manag-
ing owner, and those now in exist-
ence are due to his energetic and

bearing fruit trees and with vines
and shrubs. Mr. Dennis made “Epp-
ing Forest” his headquarters from
1894 to 1917, and in that time twice
(in 1881 and 1910) revisited the
Motherland, on the second occasion
touring all over England and Ireland
and visiting many places of historic
interest on the Continent. He took
a live interest in all matters affecting
the progress of the Peak Downs dis-
trict during his residence therein,
and was for several years a member
of the Belyando Marsupial Board.
In the year 1917 he purchased from
Mr. J. W. Walmsley “Springfield,”
a property situated at Oxley, and
about eight miles from Brisbane; and
leaving the active direction of his
large pastoral interests to his sons
has since resided there, only occa-
sionally visiting his western proper-
ties. “Springfield” occupies a site
on what was one of the finest pastoral
properties taken up in Queensland,
the foundation of which dated from
the time that the present State was
yet included within the boundaries of
New South Wales and known as
Moreton Bay Territory. It embraces
between 30 and 40 acres, and permits
of the paddocking of a few choice
cattle, horses, etc., thus affording
scope for the abundant energy which
is still one of the distinguishing
characteristics of Mr. Dennis, and
which, coupled with his preseverance,
grit, endurance, and ability to look
ahead, enabled him to achieve what
he has in the face of hardships and
trials which would have disheartened
a man of weaker calibre. Possessed
of keen powers of observation and an
excellent memory, and being a clever
raconteur, his reminiscences of men
and incidents are both amusing and
instructive, throwing much light on
the conditions accompanying the
making of the State and the building
up of the great industry which was
and is the most salient factor in her
prosperity, and with which he has
been so notably identified, playing
his part against flood and drought
and the numerous adversities for
which experience has since taught
the remedy, in the spirit which has
ever actuated the Empire builders

on the first occasion in England in
the year 1882, to Mary Ann,
daughter of the late William Thomp-
son, of Campton, Bedfordshire, of

which union there was born a son
and a daughter. Some time after the
death of the first Mrs. Dennis he mar-
ried Annie, daughter of the late P.
Rooney, who, of Irish birth, was one
of the early pioneers of Queensland,
having been a well-known con-
tractor of the southern part of the
State, and of this union there is a
family of three sons and three daugh-
ters. Mr. W. 11. Dennis, the eldest
son, is now in charge of “Durdham”
Station, of which he entered upon
the management in the year 1919 on
his return from the firing line, he
having enlisted for active service in
1915, shortly after the outbreak of
the Great War. His record of ser-
vice dated to the end of hostilities,
in the course of which he was three
times a casualty, being wounded in
the Somme battle and twice gassed.
While in England he married Louise
Harper, of Bedfordshire. Jack, the
second son and eldest of second
family, is a past student of the well-
known Christian Brothers’ College at
Nudgee, and now manages “Epping
Forest.” His wife is Gertrude,
daughter of Mr. W. Southgate, a
well-known contractor and citizen of
the Clermont district. Robert, the
third son, was educated under
tutorial supervision at “Epping
Forest,” and is now engaged in the
management of “Boombeena,” a sta-
tion adjoining “Moray Downs.” He
married a daughter of Mr. Beck,
formerly head teacher of the Gympie
State School and well known also in
Duaringa during his many years’
occupancy of the head-mastership of
the State School there. The youngest
son resides with his brother at
“Boombeena” and attends to the
clerical work connected with the
various properties. Mr. William
Dennis is a member of the Clermont
Club.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


JOHN WILSON BULL, “Belle-
vue,” Capella, was born at “Coorin-
goora” Station, near Bingara, New
South Wales, on August 12, 1865,
and is fourth son of the late Charles
MR. C. BULL.
Bull, one of the early pioneers of
colonization in Australia, who, then
still in his teens, arrived from the
Old World in the late twenties.
From a short account of his career
penned at the time of his decease
for The Sydney Stock and Station
Journal of July, 1902, we glean
some idea of the vicissitudes that
marked his long association with
the pastoral industry and of the
strenuous part he played in connec-
tion with its development, as well
as of the esteem in which he was
generally held by a large circle of
friends and acquaintances through-
out the Mother State. He owned
“Cooringoora” Station for nearly
half a century, and there made his
home during the whole of that
period, on his death bequeathing the
property to his descendants. With
other interesting matter connected
with his career it is recorded that
he was one of a party which took
possession of “Coppymorumbilla”
Station, near Goondiwindi, in the
thirties, and that he had several ex-
citing encounters with the hostile
blacks who then infested this district.
On one occasion, while working his
stock, he was attacked by a horde of
natives, and when attempting to
make good his escape a well-aimed
spear deprived him of his horse. He
continued to outdistance his pursuers
on foot, though they followed
him in full strength across ten miles
of open plains ere wearying of
occasionally discharges from a long-
barrelled musket which he carried.
To give some idea of the depriva-
tions suffered by the pioneers of the
country, it is mentioned that during
Mr. Bull’s sojourn at “Coppymor-
umbilla” he was without flour, tea,
or sugar for a period of twelve weeks
while awaiting the arrival of bullock
drays with supplies from Maitland,
300 miles distant, the nearest ration
depot in those days. He became
the owner of “Cooringoora,” then
known as “Big River” Station, in
the year 1853, having as his partner
in this venture Mr. W. M. Borth-
wick. Death claimed him at the ripe
old age of ninety-three, closing a

life which was chequered with hard-
ships and sacrifices and many set-
backs, and rewarded by the joy of
achievement and the knowledge
that his labours had reared in com-
fort a large family and placed him
in the position to gratify the prompt-
ings of a generous nature. He mar-
ried a member of an old English fam-
ily, Emma Wilson, who was a step-
daughter of the late George Murray,
well known during his lifetime as a
pastoral manager. The late Charles
Bull had twelve children, of whom
seven sons and three daughters
survive, the eldest son being yet
in residence at “Cooringoora,”
which has continued in the
the family for nearly seventy years.
Three of the sons are engaged in
pastoral pursuits in Queensland,
namely, H. W. Bull, of “Yarra-
wonga” Station, near Charleville;
G. E. Bull, of “Tarana,” in the same
district; and John Wilson Bull,
owner of “Bellevue,” near Capella.
Educated by private tuition at
home, Mr. J. W. Bull, who assimil-
ated a knowledge of stock with his
growth, when at an early age had
duties assigned to him on the home
acres, in the working of which he
continued to assist his elder brothers
until shortly after the death of the
late pioneer, when he took over the
management of “Roma” Station, in
the Narribri district, in the family
interests. He subsequently started
in business on his own account as a
stock and station agent in Barraba,
and later accepted the management
of “Barraba Creek” Station for
Messrs. Carter Bros. When that
property was sold he journeyed to
Queensland with the intention of
striking out in the industry on his
own account, and in due course pur-
chased his present holding from Mr.
Alsop Williams, the original holder
of the block, which prior to the
latter’s acquirement of it was

to the late Andrew Herbertson, who
established the name under the

World under engagement for the lay-
out of Government House grounds
and various public gardens then under
contemplation in Hobart Town, he
having previously followed the
profession of landscape gardener in
Scotland, where many of his pro-
genitors had been horticulturists.
Mr. Andrew Herbertson was so im-
pressed with its beauty and promise
that, when the work for which he
was specifically engaged was com-
pleted, he definitely decided to
remain in the country and engaged
in gardening on his own account.
Hotel-keeping also occupied him, it
being on record that he was “mine
host" of the first hostelry built on
the north side of the Risdon Ferry.
He owned the rights of this ferry,
which he worked in conjunction with
his hotel business. When the sensa-
tional news of the gold discoveries
of the fifties reached Tasmania he
proceeded to the mainland and be-
came one of the pioneers of the
Ballarat field. His name has come
down to posterity as that of one of
the miners who were active in the
famous Eureka Stockade Riot, and
his death is recorded as having
occurred at the hands of gold robbers
when on the way to Melbourne with
the metal he had won, his brother,
who had been his companion at the
diggings, having been murdered at
the same time. Every class of
humanity was represented among the
vast throngs which sought fortune at
the early goldfields, the worst types
being immigrants of evil character,
escaped convicts, etc., whose crimes
too often remained unpunished—as
in the case of the murderers of the
founder of the Herbertson family—
owing to the impossibility of giving
due effect to the law under the con-
ditions governing the gold rushes.
The late gentleman’s widow carried
on the family interests in Tasmania
practically up to the time of her own
demise. Her sons eventually crossed
to the mainland, however, and finally
settled in Queensland, one', Robert,
having for a number of years repre-
sented Port Curtis in the Queensland
Assembly. Mr. Francis Herbertson
was born at Risdon, on the Derwent,
Tasmania, on May 23, 1854, and
educated at public schools in Hobart
and Richmond. In the last year of
his teens he crossed over to the main-
land and became engaged in stock
work in New South Wales, at which
he continued for the ensuing four
years, in 1877 taking up an agricul-
tural farm on “Jingelic" Station, on
the Upper Murray. This property
was well improved on coming into
his possession, and he continued to
work it until faced with the problem
of expansion, which he realized
would be difficult of solution with-
out considerable capital in a closely-
settled district such as the Upper
Murray. As a scheme likely to afford

to the best advantage he decided he
would trade on the way, and with
that end in view had a spacious van

him to act on medical advice and

the end of this period of his career
he again set his face towards the wide
pastures and untrammelled environ-
merit of Western Queensland, and in

out the district for the upnghtn^gs
and courtesy which characterized his
dealings, his kindliness being ex-
tended to the weary traveller carrying


his swag with the same punctili-
ousness as to the wealthiest of his
patrons. Towards the end of 1895
he disposed of his Langlo interests
and proceeded to the district out-
lying Gladstone, where, in conjunc-
tion with his brother, Robert
Herbertson, he pioneered and opened
up Glassford Creek Copper Mine,
the development of which „ engaged
the brothers for two years. They
were fairly successful with this
venture, and in 1900 Mr. F. Her-
bertson took up three blocks of
grazing land in the Boyne Valley,
and on this property, "Melrose,”
made his initial start in the pastoral
industry. Six years later he added
to his landed interests by the
district, while its homestead and out-
buildings stand out as being the
most up-to-date in the locality. The
country is comprised of open downs
which are luxuriantly clothed with
Mitchell, Flinders, blue, and very
many other varieties of native grasses
and well sheltered by shady belts of
blackbutt, bloodwood, and good
edible scrub. A number of wells pro-
vide a generous water supply, which
is conveyed to the stock by the action
of windmills and engines. Among
the other very up-to-date improve-
ments maybe mentioned outbuildings,
fences, and gates, all of which, in
their way, bear that same stamp of
completeness that marks the home-
stead, which is situated about twelve
father and sons having spent their
lives in pioneering work in their
adopted country. The late gentle-
man was an early settler of the
Albury district, New South Wales.
Of the union there is a family of
three sons and two daughters, the
eldest son, Francis John, being at
time of writing the secretary of the
Mount Morgan Hospital. The two
younger sons, Norman Ernest and
Aubrey Herbert, have been admitted
to partnership by their father, whom
they assist in the administration of
“Blair Athol.” Norman Ernest was
born in Melbourne on October 25,
1889, and educated chiefly by private
tuition under the paternal rooftree.
Shortly after the outbreak of the
purchase of "Blair Athol” Station
and worked both holdings until 1913,
when he disposed of "Melrose.” In
1914 he bought "Winchester Downs,”
a property on the Isaacs, which, after
holding for five years, he also sold,
thereafter exclusively devoting him-
self to his interests at "Blair Athol.”
The latter was the portion first
acquired of the area known as
"Bathampton” Station, having been
taken up by a Mr. McMaster in the
early days of the State and subse-
quently reduced to its present acre-
age of about 20,000 by Government
resumption. Its admirable situation,
the excellence of its pasturage, and
the high state of development to
which it has been brought, however,

lofty rooms which are lighted by

ditions of the most trying summer,

tion as an ideal country home. The
old residence does duty as quarters.
Mr. Herbertson has long exercised
the Commission of the Peace. He

1917, and in the course of that
engagement was taken prisoner by
the Germans. For twenty months he
was held a prisoner of war in Ger-
many, being returned to England
after the Armistice. Since his re-
turn to Australia he has been
engaged, as already stated, at "Blair

at Charleville on July 29, 1892, and
received the same tuition as was
accorded his brother. He is con-
sidered one of the most able and suc-
cessful amateur riders in Queensland,

son of the late Alexander Bonar
McDonald, who, of a farming family
of old Scottish lineage, was during
his lifetime one of the best known
pioneers of the Peak Downs district.
Hailing from Bonar Bridge, Scot-
land, in the early fifties, Mr. A. B.
McDonald originally settled in Vic-
toria, where, immediately after his
arrival, he joined the vast throngs
then assembled on the newly dis-
covered Bendigo field. He followed
the mining industry in Victoria for
some time and was a well-known
figure among the persevering hands
who continued to court fortune on
the early gold diggings. When the
opening possibilities of Queensland
were attracting the attention of the
more enterprising Southerners, he
decided to try his luck in the north
and was amongst the earliest arri-
vals at the copper fields of the Peak
Downs. After following the industry
in this locality for a brief period he
became “mine host” of an hotel at
Copperfield, in the conduct of which
he was engaged at the time of the
birth of the subject of this memoir.
While carrying on his business in
Copperfield he became intimately
associated with the development of
the pastoral industry, having pur-
chased in the middle seventies “Gros-
venor Downs,” a large area in the
Peak Downs district. His chief
energies were subsequently devoted
to the administration of this pro-
perty, which continued his home
during the many years which elapsed
up to the time of his death in the
year 1907. Even after centreing his
interest in pastoral pursuits he
devoted a good deal of attention to
mining, and in this connection, as
in various phases of communal life,
did much to further the progress of
the town and district, his public-
spiritedness meeting recognition by
his election to the mayoral chair on
several occasions during the pros-
perous days of Copperfield. A man
whose word was sacred and whose
integrity was unimpeachable, he has
left a name of which his descendants
may be justly proud. Two sons and
two daughters survived him, his
elder son and namesake, Alexander
Bonar McDonald, being at time
of writing engaged in dairying
near Brisbane. Mr. Duncan C.
McDonald attended Mr. Perkin’s
High School, Mackay, until past his
thirteenth year, when he returned to
"Grosvenor Downs.” For several
years he was engaged in assisting his
father here, and when the property
was sold after the death of the latter
he launched out on his own account,
taking up country from a resump-
tion of "Peak Yale” Station. From
his headquarters at this .holding,
which embraces 10,000 acres and is
known at "Eton Vale,” he engages
in grazing pursuits and in cattle and
horse dealing, the block being most

Kettle, a pioneer of the early days
of the Mother State, who was born
in Sydney in the year 1828. Of Eng-
lish origin, the latter was a son of
a very early settler, who, born in the
MR. F. W. G. KETTLE.
Old World, was brought to Australia
when only two years of age. This
gentleman grew up, married, and
reared his family in the Mother
State. His son, the late George
William Kettle, played his part in
pioneering both the pastoral and
mining industries, having been one
of the earliest arrivals at Bendigo
and Ballarat and a participant in
the historical event known as the
Eureka Stockade Riot. He rode from
New South Wales to the Bendigo
rush, experiencing great hardships on
the way. Mr. Kettle then undertook
a long journey over unknown
country from New South Wales
to the head of the Burnett River.
On reaching the Burnett he
secured a post on a pastoral property
owned by the Hon. (then Mr.) W.
H. Walsh. It is recorded of him
that he was the first man to drive
a bullock-team into Gayndah. He
subsequently proceeded to New
South Wales from Gayndah, return-
ing to Queensland in 1864 and mak-
ing his way to the Peak Downs dis-
trict, where he became employed as
supervisor in charge of teams owned
by the late Thomas Hatfield, formerly
a well-known pioneer of this part of
Western Queensland. With these
teams he conveyed ore to the sea-
board from what was then the
thriving settlement of Copperfield—a
task of no mean proportion. In the
late sixties he entered the hotel busi-
ness, becoming mine host of the first
inn opened at South Copperfield,
where he continued to reside until
1878, in which year he removed to
Emerald, having in the interim con-
ducted a stock and station and gen-
eral agency business in Clermont for
a brief period. With the completion
and opening of the railway to
Emerald he erected an hotel on the
site now occupied by the Grand
Hotel of that town, personally con-
ducting the business for about three
years, at the end of that time trans-
ferring his energies to Capella, to
which the line had by then been ex-
tended. During his residence in
Capella the Divisional Board system
of Local Government was inaugu-
rated in Queensland and he became
one of the pioneer members of the
Belyando body, in which he repre-
sented Capella. He eventually re-
turned to Clermont, again estab-
lishing himself in the agency busi-
ness. It was through his instrument-
ality that the Peak Downs Shire was
formed from the old Belyando Coun-
cil district, and much of the early
development of the locality, which
included the making of good roads,
crossings, and similar operations is
traceable to his public spiritedness.
For fourteen years he was clerk of
the Peak Downs Shire Council. His
full and busy life, chequered by
vicissitudes of which the foregoing
memoir necessarily conveys but a
faint idea, ended in the year 1918,

which he was employed for four
years. At the end of that time he
resigned from the Public Service,
and in conjunction with his father
became interested in commerical life.
Eventually he entered the pastoral
industry, which he followed on
various stations in Central Queens-
land until the year 1895. He was
actively concerned in the shearers’
strike of 1891, being the leader of
the free labourers of “Peak Downs”
and “Northampton Downs” Sta-
tions. In 1895 he started on his own
account as a stock and station agent
in Clermont, carrying on in this con-
nection until other interests caused
him to dispose of the business, which
has since come into the hands of
Appleton & Co. He purchased in
1905 from the Bank of New South
Wales an original property lease of
former owners. Mr. Kettle, how-
ever, was quick to see its possibilities,
and it was not long before he had
supplemented the water supplies con-
tained in two creeks which intersect
the run by sinking a number of
wells. The creeks may be depended
upon for about ten months in the
year, and sometimes for the whole
year round. The country comprising
the run, which is devoted to sheep,
cattle, and horses, is made up of un-
dulating plains, open forest ridges,
and myall creek flats, and its suit-
ability for the wool-growing industry
is demonstrated in the fact that the
“Prairie” wool yielded the topmost
price for wool grown in Central
Queensland during the year 1914.
“Prairie” is well fenced and sub-
divided—the paddocks numbering
sixteen—and may be described as one
of the most improved properties of its
size in the district. The homestead,
which was erected in 1909, is a hand-
some structure, and so designed as
to add considerably to the comfort
of fruit trees, and is in every sense
an ideal home. Mr. Kettle is a large
shareholder and the Rockhampton
manager of the Queensland Primary
Producers’ Co-operative Agency —a
company formed on May 1, 1920,
and which purchased the well-known
business of John Bridge & Co. In
his absence “Prairie” is managed
by his sons. He, like his late father,
has prominently jiarticipated in the
public life of the Peak Downs dis-
trict. For fifteen years he has been
a member of the Belyando Shire
Council and twice its chairman, while
for fourteen years he was associated
in the same capacity with the Peak
Downs Shire Council, of which he
was chairman for four periods. He
was twice mayor of Clermont and was
chairman of the Graziers’ Associa-
tion of the Clermont district for
eight years, and was also chairman
of the district country party, and
during his whole career has lent his
support to all movements of a
charitable, patriotic, political, or
sporting nature. He still takes his
recreation in the cricket field, his
predilection for the national game
being probably inherited as an early
member of the family played in one
of the first test teams got together
in Australia, since when the name
throughout two States has been more
or less prominently associated with
this sport. Mr. Kettle married in the
year 1894 Mary Jane, daughter of
the late Timothy Cunningham, an
Irish settler from County Roscom-
mon, who played a pioneer part in
the agrarian development of the
Rockhampton district. Of the union
there is a family of two sons and
one daughter. Both sons were born

JOHN CAMERON, “Rook-
wood,” near Mitchell, was born near
Maitland, on the Hunter River,
New South Wales, on January 14,
1842, and is a son of the late Donald
MR. J. CAMERON.
Cameron, who came to Australia in
1836, by the ship “Brilliant,” under
the auspices of the late Rev. John
Dunmore Lang, before the period of
the consummation of that gentle-
man’s immigration campaign, which
took place in the late forties.
Voyaging by this vessel were a num-
ber of other Scottish families, among
whom were included such well-
known names as McPherson, Mc-
Kenzie, and McGregor; but it may
safely be said that no more worthy
representative of ancient Scottish
clan ever left his native heath to
undertake the work of empire-build-
ing in a far distant land, than the
late Donald Cameron. He sprang
from one of the oldest of these clans,
his ancestors having peopled the
Lochaber district in the West of
Scotland from time immemorial, and
his crest—a mailed hand holding a
dagger—is one of the most ancient
in Scottish history. Since his arrival
in the land of the Southern Cross,
a large number of other members of
the family connection have followed
his example, and have left their
native land to carve out a career in
the Mother State of the great island-
continent of Australia. Immediately
following his advent to New South
Wales, Mr. Donald Cameron took
up land on the Hunter River, and
became engaged in farming and
grazing pursuits, continuing there
for a lengthy period. Eventually
he settled at Booral, in the Port
Stephens district, where he ended a
useful career as a colonist, leaving a
large family to carry on his name.
Mr. Donald Cameron, who was twice
married, was accompanied to Aus-
tralia by five sons and four daugh-
ters, the issue of his earlier union;
and by his second wife, who after-
wards became the mother of three
Australian-born sons and one daugh-
ter, and was the companion of his
declining days at Booral. Of her
sons, the eldest, Mr. Dugald Cam-
eron, J.P., who is mentioned else-
where in this work, is the owner of
“Camlet” Station, near Bollon;
the second is Mr. John Cameron,
the subject of this memoir; and the
third, Mr. Donald Cameron, now
living in retirement in the Manning
district of New South Wales. Mr.
John Cameron spent his childhood
days at Booral, for a time attending
a school at West Maitland, where
he made the most of the limited op-
portunities for instruction afforded
the children of the pioneers. From
a very early date his services were
requisitioned in the development of
his father’s property, and he became
thoroughly familiarized with the
many details of the agricultural and
grazing industries, as pursued at
that period in New South Wales. In
1860 his elder brother, Mr. Dugald
Cameron, who, at an earlier period
had found his way to Queensland at
the time of the gold rushes in the
Port Curtis district, married, and
brought his wife to the northern
colony, which had recently taken
upon itself the responsibilities of
self-government; and Mr. John
Cameron, who was then over seven-
teen years of age, decided also to
try his fortune in this portion of
Australia. Upon arrival he promptly
secured a post on “Currawillighi”
Station, which property at that time
was owned by a Mr. Henry Adams
—a pioneer of the Maitland country
where young Cameron had been
brought up —and here he filled the
position of a trusted employe for
twenty years, during the second
decade taking full charge of the
stock in the capacity of overseer. At
the time of his advent the blacks
were numerous and hostile, and it
was necessary for Europeans to make
a point of arming themselves
against possible attack, but, unde-
terred by such drawbacks, Mr. Cam-
eron remained in the faithful dis-
charge of his duties, carrying out his
work in a most efficient manner. The
station changed hands during Mr.
Cameron’s residence there, but he
transferred his services to the new
owner, and, in the course of time,
married, still continuing to reside at
“Currawillighi.” About eight years
after the event referred to he found
himself in a position to launch out
on his own account, and, purchasing
“Tilquin” Station, in the Rollon
district of Queensland, started
cattle-raising operations, with excel-
lent results. Mr. Cameron continued
the development of his private pro-
position for a number of years, even-
tually disposing of “Tilquin” Sta-
tion, in the year 1912, since when
he has lived in retirement at “Rook-
wood,” near Mitchell, a property
owned by his son, Mr. Donald Archi-
bald Cameron. The veteran pastor-
alist, who is now in his seventy-
sixth year, has had a wide range of
experiences whilst doing his part
towards the opening up of the rich
resources of the place which he had
made the country of his adoption.
He suffered many of the hardships
and privations of the pioneer settler,
and has known what it meant to
camp out with his wife and family
for weeks at a time on ridges of sand
whilst flood-waters swirled round the
walls of the old-time homestead.
During his lifetime he made more
than his share of sacrifices in carry-
ing out his appointed work to the
best of his ability. Starting life on

stock from time to time, sometimes
being reduced to the point when
there appeared small hope of ever
retrieving the lost ground. He en-
joyed, however, the unqualified
blessing of the help and companion-
ship of a good wife, who afforded
him on all occasions the practical
and moral support which a true
helpmeet only can give; and,
cheered and encouraged by her sym-
pathy and assistance, he was enabled
to “make good,” even when things
looked their blackest. Mrs. Cameron
is a daughter of the late William
Nicholas, recorded as the earliest
pastoral manager of the Liverpool
Plains district, New South Wales,
his native place being Bury-St. Ed-
monds, Suffolk, England. His wife
was a member of the well-known
Irish family of the name of Graham,
for over a century resident in Dub-
lin. Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas settled
near Booral, the township of Bog-
gabri now standing on the site of
the homestead where they resided
for many years at a period when the
aboriginals were a serious menace to
the civilized residents who estab-
lished themselves in their midst.

is outlined below, Mr. and Mrs.
Cameron have three daughters—Mrs.

scholastic course, at sixteen years of
age, he joined his parents at “Til-
quin,” where he remained for some
of time lie left the paternal home-
stead, and began at the bottom of
the ladder as station hand on “Wool-
erina,” which was owned by the New
Zealand Loan Company, and, at
that time, was under the manage-
ment of Mr. C. W. Raleigh. After
about twelve months he undertook
the duties of assistant drover on the
long stock routes, and, eventually,
became a full-fledged drover on his
own behalf, in this way considerably
augmenting his knowledge of the
management and handling of stock.
When barely out of his teens, Mr.
Cameron inaugurated the operations
which he has since so successfully
developed, and, for five years, was
engaged in stock-dealing on a more
or less extensive scale. In 1905 he
purchased the grazing area upon
which the “Woodlands” headstation
has been established. This holding,
which was a portion of the resumed
area of the original “Foyleview”
run, in the first instance covered
only 15,000 acres, and was used by
Mr. Cameron as a sheep station, the
developmental work commenced
thereon by the previous owner —a
Mr. Jackson—being steadily carried
forward under the new regime. In-

boundaries, the gentleman under-

already acquired country. Mr. Cam-

administration of the three combined

of place is given to the wool and
mutton producers, which thrive well
in the district. At an early stage in
the history of the enterprise, pure
1915-16 brought these figures down
to a considerably lower level. A
flock of 30,000 with a herd of about
4,000 cattle would be an approxi-
mately correct estimate of the
estates until 1912, when the old
"Rookwood” Station, about thirty
miles distant, being placed on the
market, he secured this valuable
property. Since that date he also
has become proprietor of "Foyle-
view,” one of the oldest historic
stations of the district, the founda-
ton of which dates back to the period
which witnessed the rise of the earli-
est pastoral properties in Queens-
land. The aggregate area of the

PETER ABRAHAMSEN, J.P.,
“Bonnie Doon” and “Hazeldene,”
Jundah, was born at Newcastle-on-
Tyne, England, on November 4,
1852, and is the eon of the late
MR. P. ABRAHAMSEN.
Abraham Jensen, a native of Den-
mark—the difference in the surnames
of father and son being accounted
for by the style of nomenclature,
then current in that country, which
provided that the surname of the son
should be taken from the Christian
name of the father. The late
Abraham Jensen was descended
from a family of old lineage in
Denmark, his progenitors having
followed agrarian avocations in that
country, though his own profession
was that of a mariner, a calling in
which he was engaged for some time
in the capacity of ship’s mate.
Subsequently he relinquished his
seafaring career in order to settle in
England, where he married, his wife
being of Scottish birth. His death
occurred during the infancy of the
subject of our memoir, who as a
consequence of this bereavement was
taken to Denmark by his paternal
uncle and brought up and educated
as a member of that gentleman’s
family. On his attainment to years
of man’s estate, however, having
heard of the possibilities cf success
awaiting men of energy and resource
in that distant part of the great
Empire to which he owed his birth,
he decided that he, too, would put
those qualities with which he was so
largely endowed to the test, and
sailed for Australia in the year 1874.
His twenty-second year marked the
starting point of his life in this
country, where lie lias founded his
name and line, and the posterity of
the old pioneer will surely have every
reason to feel grateful to that spirit
of adventure and hardihood which
animated him when as a youth he
severed old tie's for the purpose of
carving a career in the land of the
Southern Cross. He obtained his
first position in the coastal district
of Central Queensland, where he was
employed in fencing work at an
annual wage of £3O. Owing to the
unfamiliar environment and to the
fact that he was practically un-
acquainted with the English
language his lot was far from being
an easy one, but he quickly gained a
satisfactory knowledge of his work
MR. E. K. ABRAHAMSEN.
and the conditions which accom-
panied it, feeling at the end of six
months spent as an employe that he
was fully capable of starting as a
contractor on his own account. From
thenceforward he was engaged in
general bush contract work for
several years, his labours taking him
as far north as Cooktown and to
Normanton in the Gulf country. In
both those places he pursued the
business of a wheelwright and
carpenter, trades which he had
learnt and followed while living
under his uncle’s roof in Denmark,
and which he naturally resumed on
the first suitable opportunity, his
earnings in this work being at times £1
per day. While engaged in his busi-
ness at Normanton the Croydon gold
discovery eventuated, and tempted
by the fascinating possibilities held
out by every newly-found field,
he joined in the rush to that
centre in the year 1885, following
the gold-mining industry for the
ensuing three years. Having met
with but little encouragement at the
hands of Dame Fortune in that
pursuit he at length determined to
build his hopes of success on the
surer basis of trade. Accordingly he
joined in partnership with Mr. P.
Meling and started as blacksmith
and wheelwright in Croydon in the
year 1888. Two years later, in 1890,
he was joined in partnership by Mr.
George Kerr, with whom he carried
on the business for the following
seven years. At the end of this
period, having realized that the man
who develops the resources and pro-
duces the best result from the land
generally achieves a larger share of
success and independence than his
fellows, he decided to turn his own
energies in that direction. As a
result he selected “Bonnie Doon,” a
block on the “Warbreccan” resump-
tion, in the year 1898, and in the
following year purchased 1,000
ewes from “Bimerah” Station, these
being intended for the foundation of
his future flocks. His enterprise,
however, was followed by almost
heartrending conditions, the plucky
settler being overtaken by the

whose hard-won earnings had been
sunk in his new venture, was
naturally a heavy loser and only
able to avert complete disaster by
returning to his trade. This he did,
of 50,000, the whole area, which has
received due attention in regard to
development, being devoted to mer-
ino flocks, shorthorn cattle, and
horses. The latter, which are bred
by a sense of duty, has interested
himself in most matters affecting the
interests of the community. For
the past twenty years he has fulfilled
his duties as a Justice of the Peace,
and to such good purpose that he
w T as soon again in a position to make
a fresh start on the land which he
had previously acquired, having in
the interim contracted for and
erected amongst other public and
private buildings in the town and
district the Jundah Public Hospital
and the local school, all of which
structures stand as evidence of his
craftmanship. Twelve years after

proposition, "Bonnie Doon,” he
selected "Hazeldene,” an estate

on the properties, are mostly light
draughts well suited for station
work. The runs are well watered by
permanent holes situated in different
parts of the estates, “Bonnie Doon”
being additionally favoured in this
respect by a six-mile frontage to the
Thomson River. About one-half of
the country consists of Mitchell
grass plains, the remaining portion
being lightly timbered with mulga,
gidya, beefwood, and other varieties
of edible scrub, trees and shrubs
which have proved extremely useful in
times of drought. Mr. Abrahamsen
and for over a decade celebrated the
ceremony for couples entering into
wedlock. He has also rendered many
years’ useful service as a member of
the Barcoo Shire Council, and has
been a committeeman of the local
hospital for several years, holding
the distinction of being the first
subscriber to that institution. He
married in the year 1897 Mary Ann,
daughter of the late Mr. Angus, of

DAVID JOHN EYRE, “Haugh-
ton Vale,” Jundah, was born at
Hay, New South Wales, on Decem-
ber 4, 1870. He is the second son of
the late Daniel Eyre, and a grandson
MR. DANIEL EYRE, JUN.
of an old Manchester identity, also
known as Daniel Eyre, whose for-
bears peopled that town and the
surrounding country for many gen-
erations. The late Daniel Eyre was
born in Manchester, and served as a
regular in the British Army. He
took part in the Crimean War, and
received wounds on that memorable
occasion, the scars of which remained
with him until his death. Leaving
his native town for the land of the
Southern Cross nearly three-quar-
ters of a century ago, he arrived at
that early period of Australia’s
history when the growing prosperity
of the young country gave promise
of a glorious nationhood —a promise
which has since ripened into fulfil-
ment mainly through the efforts of
such staunch pioneers as the founder
of the Eyre family in Australia.
The greater portion of his life in his
adopted country was spent as a
member of the New South Wales
Civil Service, but a short interval
was devoted to the search for the
“golden gleam” on the discovery of
the early goldfields in Victoria.
Prior to his retirement from official
work he occupied the position of
sergeant of police at Wilcannia, a
post which he relinquished for the
prospect of a more congenial career
on the land, and as a result he
entered the dairying industry, in
which he continued until his retire-
ment from active business pursuits.
His death occurred at the ripe old
age of 84. His memory, and that of
his good wife, still live in the hearts
of those with whom they came in
contact during their lengthy resi-
dence under the sunny skies of
Australia. Mr. David John Eyre
was educated at the local school,
Wilcannia, his scholastic studies
being varied by his contributions of
labour towards the conduct of the
home acres, for even during his
schooldays such assistance as he was
able to render was readily availed of
in the general routine of the farm
work. When he had reached his
fourteenth year, in common with so
many lads of equal calibre who owed
their origin to similar sturdy stock,
he started life on his own account,
obtaining work in a shearing-shed,
where he was employed picking up
the fleeces. Subsequently he secured
a situation as boundary rider on
“Kiltower” Station, being thence-
forward employed in general station
work for about two years. At the end
of this period he decided to test the
possibilities of mining, entering into
the industry at Broken Hill. He fol-
lowed the career of a miner for
over two years, relinquishing his
pursuits in this direction in order to
return to the more congenial environ-
ment of bush life and work, realizing
also that conscientious labour in this
direction gave promise of more
prosperous fulfilment. As a result
he journeyed to Queensland, where
he secured employment as stock-
keeper and drover in the far Central
West, travelling in the accomplish-
ment of his duties all through the
Northern State, and from different
centres in that part of the continent
into the markets of New South
Wales. This form of occupation was
was followed by that of a mail-driver,
in which capacity he carried His
Majesty’s mails over the route
between Mooraberrie and Windorah,
and from the latter village to Stone-
henge, for a period of four years.
Subsequently he returned to boun-
dary riding, taking charge of a large
mileage of rabbit-fencing for the
Boulia Shire Council. While so
engaged he purchased a small flock
of sheep numbering 500 head, which
he shepherded in the country which
surrounds Stewarts Creek, his home
being a canvas tent, wherein he lived
with his wife and the family of five
children then born to him, his entry
into the pastoral industry being thus
accompanied by conditions very
similar to those which marked the
initial efforts of the early pioneers of
whom we have such just reason to
feel proud. He next selected a
block of land consisting of 6,000
acres, in proximity to that of
his present acreage, whereon the
“Haughton Vale” homestead now
stands, and within a couple of years
had increased the area of his
property by the selection of 12,000
acres of adjoining country. By dint
of industry, thrift, and that deter-
mination to “make good” which is
one of his marked characteristics, he
still further enlarged his territory by
the gradual acquirement both by
purchase and selection of further
lands in the vicinity of his earlier
acquisitions, thus bringing the whole
acreage of his landed estate to a
figure approaching 40,000. To the
development of this area, which he
named “Haughton Vale,” and the
improvements of the flocks which
pasture on its acres, he has devoted
his whole time and thought for the
past 10 years. Under conditions
which entailed much personal sacri-
fice he began the task of erecting 50
miles of fencing, of subdividing the
run into the necessary number of
paddocks, and of providing a supple-
mental water supply. The run is
composed of mixed sandy and
spinifex country and well-grassed
rolling plains, and has a combined
frontage of over 17 miles to the

Thomson and Barcoo Rivers.. The
flock numbers some 10,000 sheep of
the merino breed, the fleeces from
which are of good average weight
and quality, the clip going about


7 lbs. per sheep. A few cattle and
a good mob of horses are also run on
the estate, the latter being bred for
station use, surplus animals being

convenience of bis family. As a
result of his efforts, in which he was
upheld and encouraged by the moral
and practical support of a good wife,
having been for a considerable period
on the Board of the local Hospital,
and in other ways given freely of his
support whenever and wherever
needed. He has been pro-
minent also in the local
amateur racing events,
being a sincere advocate
for the promotion of good,
clean sport. He married
in the year 1900 Mary,
daughter of the late John
Frederick Dolgner, who
was an old Queensland
identity and a pioneer of
the far west. The late
gentleman, accompanied by
his brother, brought the
first loading by bullock
team to Stonehenge, and
the name is still well
known in that locality,
some of his descendants
being engaged in landed
pursuits in the far western
portion of Central Queens-
land. One of his sons, John
Frederick Dolgner, met his
death on the fields of France
disposed of locally. Mr. Eyre
personally manages the property,
dividing his time between the home-
stead and the town of Jundah, where
he has also a residence for the

he has now the satisfaction of seeing
his exertions crowned with well
merited success. Despite his strcn-
uous career he has found time to
attend to matters of local interest,
while fighting for his country in the
cause of humanity, justice, and
liberty. Mr. and Mrs. Eyre have a
surviving family of one son and
seven daughters.


BENJAMIN EYRE, “Depot
Glen,” Stonehenge, via Longreach,
was born at Booligal, Lachlan
River, New South Wales, on May
30, 1873, and is a son of the late
MR. DANIEL EYRE, SEN.
Daniel Eyre, whose portrait appears
in the preceding article. The grand-
father of the gentleman under
review, who was also called Daniel
Eyre, was during his lifetime a
well-known figure at Manchester,
England. Mr. Benjamin Eyre was
educated at Wilcannia, and at the
conclusion of his schoooldays, and
while still in his teens, became
engaged in mining at Broken Hill
for a brief period. On reaching his
sixteenth year he came to Queens-
land, and though the youngest
member but one of his family was
the first to arrive in this State.
He obtained work on “Eulbertie”
Station, a cattle property situated
on Cooper Creek, where he remained
in the capacity of stock-keeper and
drover for four years. About March
in the year 1894 he secured the post
of driver of the mail-coach on the
Windorah and Birdsville route,
carrying out his duties in this
connection for nearly a year. Subse-
quently he returned to “Eulbertie,”
having accepted a contract for the
breaking-in of a mob of horses on
that station. Having completed this
work he resumed his post as driver
of the Windorah-Stonehenge mail-
coach for some years, eventually
finding himself in the position
to be able to buy up all the mail
contracts between Windorah and
Longreach—-the longest mail service
as regards distance in the west. He
continued as a mail contractor
between these two centres until
1910, with the exception of an
interval of three years, during which
he drove a passenger coach over the
same route. In his coaching days he
was one of the best-known mail
drivers of the central west, fre-
quently risking his life in the
performance of his duty, successfully
overcoming the obstacles arising
through swollen streams by swim-
ming his horses from bank to bank,
and again, when the roads became
impassable, by striking across dan-
gerous bush routes in order to fulfil
the contracts which he had under-
taken. As another example of the
exceptional difficulties with which
he was faced, it should be mentioned
that during the most severe drought
ever experienced in that part of
Australia he was obliged to pay
freight at the rate of £l4 per ton
on feed for his horses, which was
purchased at Longreach, and trans-
ported thence to Jundah. This
entailed heavy financial loss, but
Mr. Eyre kept strictly to the terms
of his mail contract, and thus made
it possible for many of the settlers
to survive the ruinous conditions
then existing. In the year 1910 he
disposed of the coaching business
and settled on the land, taking up
the block on which the “Depot Glen”
homestead is now situated. Within
a few years of the acquirement of
his original block he had purchased
“Beechwood,” an adjoining property.
Subsequently, in conjunction with
his two sons, who at this time were
approaching early manhood, he
selected “Dreamlands,” near Jun-
dah, its 60,000 acres being so
highly improved by him that when

end of 1918 a ready sale was effected.
“Depot Glen” and “Beechwood” are
conducted by Mr. Eyre as one
proposition, and embrace an area of
28,000 acres of land well adapted
for sheep, with which the runs are
depastured. The runs have a
frontage of 14 miles to the

permanent waterholes. The subject
of our memoir has taken a
due part in affairs of local import-
ance, and accords his support to the
local race clubs. For a number of
years past he has been a committee-
man of sporting bodies both at
Stonehenge and Jundah. He married
in 1897 Margaret, daughter of the
late John Dolgner, who was well
known during his lifetime as one of
the pioneers of the far west of
Queensland. To Mrs. Eyre should
be accorded due credit for that
unfailing sympathy and cheerful
support which proved so great a stay
to her husband during the strenuous
periods of their married life. Of the
union there is a surviving family of
three sons and four daughters.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND: ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


COLIN BASIL PETER BELL,
J.P., part owner of "Tullamore,”
Alpha, was born at "Jimbour,”
Darling Downs, on June 26, 1867,
and is the third son of the late Sir
SIR J. P. BELL.
Joshua Peter Bell, formerly Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council of
Queensland, and for a period Acting-
Governor of the then Colony. The
deceased statesman was a native of
County Kildare, Ireland, and a son
of the late Thomas Bell. The
late Sir J. P. Bell was born in the
year 1826. He acquired, in partner-
ship with his father and brothers, the
fine property known as "Jimbour,"
which was purchased in the early
forties. Sir J. P. Bell made his entry
into Parliament in 1863, and was
appointed Colonial Treasurer during
the administration of the first
Queensland Government in Decem-
ber, 1864. He was appointed Pre-
sident of the Legislative Council in
March, 1879. He died in Brisbane in
December, 1881. His eldest son,
the Hon. Joshua Thomas Bell, held
the portfolio of Minister for Lands
in the Morgan Ministry (1903-6),
was Secretary for Public Lands
and Secretary for Public Lands and
Railways in the Kidston Cabinet
(1906-7), and Secretary for Public
Lands (February-October, 1908),
and Home Secretary (October, 1908-
June, 1909) in the second Kidston
Government. After the death of Sir
Joshua his near surviving relatives
visited Europe, returning to their
old home in 1889, where they resided
until the death of Lady Bell in 1915,
when "Jimbour" was sold. Mr. C.
B. P. Bell was educated at the
Brisbane Grammar School, and later
at Shrewsbury School, England,
from which academy he entered
Trinity Hall, Cambridge University,
where he remained for three years.
He twice rowed as No. 4 of the
Cambridge Eight, which was suc-
cessful against Oxford in 1888 and
1889, and holds, up to the present
time, the Oxford and Cambridge
record of having won every possible
open University boatrace (both
sculling and rowing) in one year, in
addition to which he was one of the
crews of the Grand Challenge Eights
and Champion Fours at Henley. He
secured many trophies for running,
boxing, etc., winning 78 out of 110
University and other events in which
he competed in England, these being
commemorated by the numerous
challenge cups in Mr. Bell’s pos-
session, possibly the largest collection
owned by any one individual in
Australia. Recently Mr. Bell pre-
sented to the North Shore Grammar
School, Sydney (where his eldest son
is now (1919) being educated), his
oars won in England, which are to
be seen hanging in the school hall.
On his return to Queensland in the
year 1889 he entered the pastoral
industry, and subsequently, from
1896 to 1906, was occupied with the
management of “Ayrshire Downs’’
on behalf of the Darling Downs and
Western Land Co. On his retirement
from that post he became manager
of “Westland’’ Station, near Long-
reach, which he has administered
under the ownership of the Queens-
land National Pastoral Co., Ltd.,

for the past twelve years. For
some years he filled a seat on the
Winton Shire Council, and since his
advent to "Westland" has been a
councillor of the Longreacli Shire.
For a period he filled the office of
vice-president of the Central Queens-
land Pastoral Employers’ Association.
He is President of the Longreach
MR. C. B. P. BELL.
Club and a member of the Queens-
land Club, Brisbane, his association
witb tbe latter institution dating
from the late eighties. He was created
a Justice of the Peace by the Griffith
Administration. He is the founder of
the Arrilalah Amateur Race Club,
Mr. Bell married in March, 1898,
Sybil Frances, daughter of Mr.
Francis H. Needham, late owner of
"Koreelah” and "Canning Downs"
Stations, Warwick, who now (1918)
lives in retirement in Sydney. Of
the union there is a family of two
sons and three daughters.


JOHN GEARN, "Braidwood
Park,” Jundah, was born at Braid-
wood, New South Wales, on January
1, 1861, and is the third son of the
late James Gearn, a native of
MR. ALEX. PATTERSON.
Limerick, Ireland, who arrived in
New South Wales with his wife and
the only child then born to them.
Mr. James Gearn became one of the
pioneers of the Araluen diggings and
subsequently followed various kinds
of bush work, being eventually
enabled by reason of his industry,
thrift, and perseverence to acquire
a farming property and thus to
follow a calling for which he had a
natural inclination inherited from a
long line of ancestors who had tilled
the soil for many generations. All
the hardships and sacrifices which
accompanied farm life in those
early days in remote inland dis-
tricts were experienced by the
founder of the Gearn family in
Australia, and in his struggle
against such adverse circumstances
he imparted to his children those
qualities of pluck and determination
which were his own distinguishing
characteristics. The subject of our
notice received but little in the way
of scholastic training, most of his
early boyhood having been spent in
the performance of duties assigned
to him which occupied long hours of
continuous labour on the home farm.
He remained under his father’s roof
until the attainment of his twelfth
year, starting on his own account at
that early age by obtaining work at
"Bellevue” Station, near Braidwood,
a property which was then owned by
the Hassell family. Here he was
employed among the horses and in
dairy work, being subsequently en-
gaged in similar duties elsewhere,
though chiefly in the former connec-
tion. In his early teens he made
one of a droving party who were
commissioned to travel a mob of
cattle from Sutton Forest to Wagga-
Wagga. On the conclusion of that
trip he took a temporary post with
the late John Affleck, a member of
one of the oldest pastoral families in
Australia, by whom he was after-
wards employed at “Mossgail,”
"Cannoble,” and "Eunonyhareena.”
Later when the late Mr. Affleck
purchased that historic old cattle
station in West Central Queensland,
known as "Carella,” the first man
chosen to assist him in his new ven-
ture was the subject of our memoir,
who at that time was only nineteen
years of age. The latter had already
made a name for himself as a very
capable horseman, and his advent to
this State in the year 1880 was
marked by several incidents which
further established his reputation in
this direction. On arriving at
Bogantungan (which was at that
time the terminus of the Central
Railway), en route to "Carella a
distance of between four and five
hundred miles —he discovered that
the coach by which he was to con-
tinue his journey had started a few
hours earlier. With the intention of
overtaking it he hired a horse at
Bogantungan, being fully deter-
mined to arrive at his destination at
the time arranged. The animal,
however, being of an inferior stamp
was soon spent, and the young man
had perforce to borrow another
which proved to be no better than
its predecessor, the result being that
the horse was turned loose and the
rider obliged to shoulder saddle and
bridle and tramp all night in the
hope of catching up with the coach
at a mail change, which at this stage
of his journey was about twenty
miles ahead. Wearied with hunger
and exhaustion he trudged on until
the night turned to day, when in the
horizon he saw the vehicle with all
the passengers in their seats ready
for the start. His hopes of achiev-
ing his object seemed unlikely of
fulfilment, but the fates, evidently
approving the determined spirit of
the wayfarer, lent their aid—a
delay occasioned by unruly coach
horses being sufficient to enable him
to arrive before the final start was
made. The sympathy of both the
manager-driver and the passengers
was at once extended to him, and the
coach delayed until the belated
passenger had breakfasted, when
the journey to Isisford was resumed.
From Isisford he proceeded on horse-
back, accompanying the mailman
and his pack-horse to "Old West-
lands,” where he found it necessary
to procure a fresh animal. The only
one available was an outlaw which
no one in the district had so far been
able to conquer. Mr. Gearn and the
mailman decided to pack him with
the mails, etc., a proceeding which
was determinedly and successfully
resisted by the unruly quadruped.
Mr. Gearn, accepting the only
alternative, decided to bestride the
beast himself, this achievement gain-
ing for him the reputation of being
“the best rider in the west,” a
distinction which he enjoyed for
many subsequent years as a result
of that and many similar exploits
which still furnish material for
household and camp-fire stories.
After overcoming other difficulties
he at length arrived at his destina-
tion with his packs borne by an un-
broken colt. He carried out his
duties as a stockman on "Carella”
with such satisfaction to his
employer that at the end of twelve
months he was appointed to the
MR. JOHN GEARN.
management of the station, a
position which he held for over a
quarter of a century, retaining the
post for seven years after the pro-
perty has passed from the Affleck


family to the ownership of the
Australian Pastoral Co., Ltd. His
experiences during the lengthy term
of his administration of “Carella”
were many and varied, and it is
worthy of record that on one
occasion he accomplished the perilous
task of swimming his horse for five
miles qver the Thompson River
when in high flood in order to assure
himself of the safety of his wife and
family, having been cut off from the
homestead by the inundating waters,
while discharging his managerial
duties. His sound judgment, in-
dustry, and capacity for hard
work, his uprightness of character,
and sense of justice in dealing with
his employes gained the unstinted
admiration of all with whom he
came in contact. In the year 1906
he relinquished his long connection
with “Carella” and took up on his
own account a 10,000-acre block of
country on the resumed portion of
that estate which he immediately
began to develop on the most
approved lines. Subsequently he
purchased three additional blocks,
thus bringing the area of his pro-
perty up to 30,000 acres, which are
devoted to sheep raising, though
small herds of cattle are run from
time to time. Ewee purchased from
“Wellshot” formed the foundation
of his flock, which steadily increased

ravages of drought. The homestead
is situated about five miles west of
Jundah and though unpretentious
is a comfortable structure. Mr.
Gearn has always been a supporter
of all clean forms of sport, and has
been prominent in amateur racing
events in the Central West for over
thirty years, having frequently
ridden his own horses to victory at
various meetings held in the district.
He is a well-known judge of
thoroughbreds and his stables always
shelter a number of really first-
class horses. He is ever to the fore
in all movements affecting the
general welfare of the community in
which he resides, and charitable
objects never fail to secure his
ready support. He has been a
member of the Barooo Shire Council
for nearly twenty years, and has
acted as its representative at the
conferences of local bodies annually
held in Brisbane. He is also one of
the founders of the Jundah Hospital.
He married in the year 1886 Mary,
eldest daughter of the late Alex-
ander Patterson, a native of Scot-
land, who later lived in the north of
Ireland, where his family were
engaged in agricultural pursuits.
Mr. Patterson came to Australia in
the middle forties and settled in
Victoria, being amongst the earliest
residents of Melbourne, and subse-
quently a well-known figure on the
various goldfields of that State. He
faithfully and honourably carried
out the duties of a pioneer citizen
of the country wherein he has
founded his name and line, and
died in Victoria in the first decade
of the present century. To Mr. and
Mrs. John Gearn were born a family
of five children.

FRANCIS JAMES CLARENCE

who, having hailed from Abridge,
near London, England, in the fifties,

ing been trained for a commercial
MR. A. W. R. BROWN.
career in the Old Country. Before
establishing himself in Gayndah he
was engaged in commerce in Bris-
bane for a brief period. At the
former place he carried on a general
storekeeping business for some years,
but realizing the advantages of mak-
ing a start in a young district so
full of promise as was Central
Queensland in the days of early
settlement he sold out of his original
venture and purchased a similar
position in Nebo, where he arrived
with his young family in the year
1866. From then onwards, for a
period spread over forty years, he
conducted his establishment there,
having considerably enlarged and
extended the scope of his trading
operations and acquired important
pastoral interests before his retire-
ment from active association with
business in the year 1906. He first
invested in the pastoral industry
towards the end of the seventies with
the purchase from the late John
Arthur Macartney of four undevel-
oped blocks of country in the district
outlying Nebo township. These,
which were consolidated under the
name of “Iffley” and subsequently
added to as he acquired various
adjoining blocks of virgin country,
were placed under the management
of the late John Absolam, who,
authorized by the owner, inaugurated
a system of development which, as
it was carried out, brought the hold-
ing into line with the most highly-
improved properties on the Peak
Downs. At the time of Mr. Brown’s
death the boundaries of “Iffley”
embraced some 500 square miles, and
the country depastured a herd of
about 10,000. Francis Brown mar-
ried Elizabeth Ann, daughter of the
late John Smith, who, hailing from
New South Wales at an early period
of Queensland history, became a
pioneer and subsequently a well-
known identity of the Tewantin dis-
trict. The union resulted in a family
of two sons and six daughters. At
Brisbane, in the year 1910, after a
few years spent in retirement here,
the fine old colonist passed away,
leaving a name of which his descend-
ants have every reason to feel proud,
and in the fruits of his unaided
efforts an example of what may be
accomplished in this great State by
application, industry, and foresight.
Throughout his long sojourn in the
district he was held in high esteem
by all classes, and his death was
keenly regretted by many an old-
timer to whom he had lent a helping
hand and the several of his acquaint-
ances who had experienced so
often the kindliness which ever
characterized tbe dealings of both
the pioneer and his wife. It is to the

tended he should devote himself, and
here he spent three years, benefiting
to such an extent by the oppor-
tnmties afforded him that at the end
o that period, being then at the age
of twenty-one, he was given full
management of the station, a posi-
tion which he retained for the whole
period intervening between 1887 and
1920. While controlling operations

affairs of the districts in which
“Bombandy” and “Iffley” are situ-
ated, For a considerable time he
was a councillor of the Nebo Shire,
and is now a member of the council
of the Broadsound Shire. He has
exercised magisterial duties as a Jus-
tice of the Peace for nearly a quarter
of a century, having been gazetted
by a Liberal Administration of the
nineties. An enthusiastic sport, he
has scored considerable success at
picnic and amateur race meetings

who represents a very old pioneering
family, which in the persons of his
father, Mr. F. Y. Fox, former owner
of “Bombandy,” and his uncle, the
late George Fox, M.L.A., and others
of the name, has been long and pro-

development of Central Queensland.

after the advent of the rains which
terminated the great drought of the
period, with cattle from “Mount
McConnell.” Shortly afterwards the
partners took up “Rookwood”—
which had been abandoned by the
previous owner during the same
drought—and stocked the area, to
which they gave the name of “Sud-
bury,” with breeders from “South
Fort Cooper.” As the herd in-
creased and their ventures prospered
they enlarged their possessions, pur-
chasing “Bombandy” from Mr. F.
Y. Fox in 1912. About two years
later “South Fort Cooper” was sold.

breeding. On relinquishing the
managerial position which he filled
for so lengthy a period at “Iffley”
he was presented, as a token of good-
will and affection, with a substantial
cheque by the trustees of the estate
of his late father. In the year 1898
he married Margaret Jessie Mc-
Kenzie, daughter of the late Murdoch
Campbell McLennan, who was well
known in pastoral circles and at one
time manager of “Stockton,” a
station formerly included in the
owmership of the late Francis Brown.
Of this union there is family of one
son and one daughter, the former,

December 30, 1903, and educated
at the Ipswich Grammar School,

native grass of several varieties, and
much edible scrub. It is generously
endowed with natural water, as inter-
secting the area are the Isaacs River,
Develin, South, and Swampy Creeks,
all of which retain good supplies,
while springs and wells—the latter
being equipped with windmills—
further ensure the safety of the stock
in the event of drought. The run
has been divided into twelve pad-
docks, the formation of which in-
volved the erection of nearly 100
miles of fencing. A herd of 10,000
well-bred Shorthorns are depastured,
which, founded on good stock in the
first instance by Mr. F. Y. Fox, has
since been kept fresh by the intro-

on “Bombandy” are deserving of
special mention, the present owner
having made a special study in con-
nection with the breeding of this
class of stock, which commands a
ready sale both from “Bombandy”
and “Iffley.” The sires at present

profession as the basis of his future
career he apprenticed himself to the
Smith Forresters Foundry, Bris-
bane, and completed a practical
training in the profession at the
Australasian United Steam Naviga-
tion Company’s workshops in the
same city. In the year 1898 he was
appointed Assistant Engineer in the

Mr. F. J. Clarence Brown in the

a century ago. It is situated between

suitability of the district for cotton

RICHMOND BROWN, the younger
son of the late Francis Brown, was
horn in Brisbane on November 22,
1868. He received his early educa-
tion at Nebo State School, from
Scottish Gympie Gold Mines, which
at that time had one of the biggest
batteries in Australia. At the re-
quest of his father, he resigned his
position in Gympie in order to con-
duct engineering operations at the
old Mount Britain Mine, near Nebo,
in which the late Francis Brown had
invested capital, and continued to
carry out his duties here until the
mine was proved to be unprofitable.
From “Mount Britain” he went to
Townsville to take a position at the
Ross River Meat Works, and, on
leaving there in 1904, joined the
staff of the New Ravenswood Gold
Mining Co., with which he was
associated in a professional capacity
for seven years. At the end of that


period, being requested to fill a
vacancy on the staff of the Pioneer
Sugar Mill, he removed with his
family to the Ayr district. From

In 1851 the late John Muirhead, as
a very young man, arrived from
MR. JOHN MUIRHEAD.
Scotland and joined his uncle,
the late Robert Muirhead, a pas-
toralist, at “The Grampians,” on
the River Wimmera, Victoria.
A few years after his arrival in the
country, and immediately following
his marriage, he became the manager
of “Carr’s Plains” Station, where
his eldest son was bom. The year
1864 witnessed his advent to “Elgin
Downs,” which, having been taken
up in partnership with a Mr. Sin-
clair, he depastured with sheep from
the Darling Downs district of South-
ern Queensland. John Muirhead’s
wife and family accomplished the
long distance from Rockhampton
to their new home by buggy.
Much trouble was experienced
from the aborigines, and the
settlers had to be ever on the
alert to prevent treacherous attacks
on themselves and the destruction of
their flocks. One of the “Elgin
Downs” shepherds met death at their
hands, and when the pioneer’s wife
and children were left (as was often
unavoidable in the early days) with-
out male protection, she would fre-
quently appear about the place in her
husband’s clothing and handling his
gun, knowing that her invisible
foes were on the watch, and trusting
that her masculine appearance would
effectually check their approach.
After a few years, owing to the
depredations of the blacks and
dingoes, the pioneers abandoned
sheep for cattle. The partnership
between Messrs. Muirhead and
Sinclair was dissolved, and the
former continued to carry on the
property until the time of his
death, when his eldest son, James
Cameron Muirhead, entered upon
the management in the interests of
the family, which then consisted of

is situated about 80 miles from
Clermont, and embraces 126 square
miles. About 4,000 Shorthorns of
good quality are depastured. The
present homestead was erected over a
quarter of a century ago, and is now
occupied by a manager, Mrs. Muix*-
bead having her residence in Cler-
mont. The late John Duncan Muir-
head married in 1902 Jane, daughter
of the late David Muirhead. Of the
union there is one son, Arthur
David, and a daughter, Jessie
Agnes, the former being a student at

variety, but the major portion of it
is either flat, or gently undulating,
forming excellent pasture land,
where natural grasses, which possess
splendid fattening qualities, flourish
luxuriantly. Predominant among
these, perhaps, is the favourite Mit-
chell grass. There is also a fine
growth of herbage at the appropriate
season. Plenty of good timber is to
be found on the run, belts of
mulga, and gidya, box and myall
being noticeable. Its boundaries
enclose about 400 square miles of
country, but, originally, at the time
of its selection by the well-known
Flood family, of New South Wales,
in the early days, it embraced the
immense mileage boasted of by but
few of the pioneer pastoral holdings
in the unopened-up territory at the
“back of beyond,” its 3,000 square
miles extending from the neighbour-
hood of Wyandra to a point near
Augathella. The original head
station was situated where the town
of Charleville now stands, and on
its actual site is now situated a
hostel that was formerly a private
residence bearing the name of
the station. Subsequently “Old
Gowrie,” on the Ward River, was
built, and used as a station residence
for a number of years. This in turn
gave way under the management of
Mr. G. W. Pitt to a new homestead,
for which the present charming site
was chosen in a locality now
approached by 14 miles of good road
from Charleville and in near vicinity
to the Warrego River, which at
this point runs along the southern
boundary of the run. The present
“Gowrie” head station is distin-
guished by one of the most modern
and complete pastoral homes in the
district, the charm of which is
enhanced by a garden in which
bloom 80 varieties of rose plants.
Trellised vines cover long, shady
walks, and many ornamental trees
add to the picturesque appearance
of the place. On “Gowrie” there
are 100 grape vines and 150 fruit
trees, citrus fruits grown here
having taken prizes at the Bris-
bane Exhibition. The woolshed,
which lies within a quarter of
a mile from the homestead and
has a large storage capacity, is
also of up-to-date design, being
fitted with sixteen stands of
Wolseley machines, the driving
power for which is provided by an
8-h.p. Marshall steam engine.
Other improvements on the pro-
perty are equally in keeping with
the progressive spirit at the helm
of affairs, telephone connections
with Charleville and two of the
outstations proving of great service.
Attention has been given to the
important matter of water supply,

in this respect having been aug-

the only breed favoured by Messrs.
Baker Brothers, and the expert
attention devoted to this department
of the firm’s operations has resulted
in the building up of one of the best
herds in the district. Bulls from the
studs of such well-known and suc-
cessful breeders as Mr. C. E.
McDougall, of “Lyndhurst,” Mr.
C. H. Angas, of South Australia,
and Mr. J. Lomax, of “Yandilla,”
are used as sires, and have proved
their superior strain by the
stamp of fine breeding which dis-
tinguishes their descendants among
the “Gowrie” cattle. In 1917 the
firm secured the record price for
bullocks sold in the district,
as high as £2O per head on
the station having been secured
for “Gowrie” stock. The price
obtained for fat sheep also narrowly
escaped the distinction of creating a
mcord when offered for sale at the
metropolitan markets. “Gowrie” is
used for dealing, and as many
as 200,000 sheep have been pur-
chased in one year. Mobs of cattle are
also purchased yearly. The horses
bred on “Gowrie” are principally
blood horses, although a fair number
of draughts are produced annually
for the requirements of the station
and there are few owners not making
a specialty of breeding horses that
can show better quality in blood
stock than the property under
review. This satisfactory state of
affairs is readily explained by the
fact that, although this up-to-date
firm does not actually specialize in
this department, they bring to- bear
a great deal of very careful thought
and consideration to the working of
it on the best possible lines. Their
aim being to secure the best prices
in the market for the surplus not
required on the property, they spare
neither trouble nor expense in
procuring the best type of mare to
mate with the fine stallion, “Togo,”
now in use as sire. “Togo,” by
“Antares” (imp.), out of “Phyllis,”
was a very successful performer on
the turf, appropriating over £16,000
in stakes, and placing to his credit
among other events the Newmarket
Handicap, the Doncaster Handicap,
the Q.T.C. Derby, and various
other races of importance. Most of
the mares are the progeny of some

of the best stallions ever imported
into Queensland, and under these
favourable auspices the good results
that have been the rule in the
breeding of blood horses at “Gowrie”
were a foregone conclusion. The
station came into possession of the
present proprietors in 1912, being
purchased by them from Messrs.
Menzies & Co. in August of that
year, since when they have person-
ally resided on the run, and have
conjointly administered its affairs.
“TONGY” Station was purchased
on August 23, 1919, from Mrs.
Holloway, to whom it was bequeathed
by her former husband, the late Dr.
Hindes. It embraces an area of
400 square miles of open mulga
country and broken plains, and is
well known for its fattening qualities
as one of the most highly-developed
runs in the district, the improve-
ments to date having cost £25,000.
They include an immense mileage of
fencing, 300 square miles being
enclosed with dog- and rabbit-proof
netting, and 100 square miles with
rabbit-proof netting only. The de-
velopment for water has resulted in
two artesian bores which yield flows
approximating to 2,000,000 gallons
daily. With their station plant the
Messrs. Baker are putting down an
additional bore, which has already
been sunk to 2,000 feet, and pro-
duces 80,000 gallons per diem, the
operators expecting to strike a big
flow at any moment. Apart from
the bores, numerous tanks and dams
supplement the natural water supply,
which is chiefly received from Mun-
gallala Creek, to which the run has
a 20-mile frontage. The “Tongy”
residence is an exceptionally fine and
up-to-date building, having been
erected at a cost of £2,000. It

properties, “Bendena,” “Tongy,”
and "Yunnerman.” Since his advent
to Charleville, he has given a con-
siderable amount of attention to the
affairs of the district in a general way,
but on account of the responsibili-
ties connected with the management
of “Cowrie,” has not allowed himself
to be considered eligible for election
to any public offices in connection
with any local organizations. He has
held the Commission of the Peace
for several years, and is a member
of several clubs, including the
America, and the British Isles, and
various parts of the Continent. The
second son, Reginald Arthur, was
born at “Glenelg,” near Warwick.
After a period of study under private
tuition in his father’s homestead he
entered Gatton Agricultural College,
and upon the completion of his
course in this institution returned
to the parental rooftree, where he
applied himself to the acquisition of
practical experience in all the details
of station work and management.
The urgent need of his country for
eligible men to take their place in
the ranks fighting for the national
ideals in the Old World caused him
to place patriotic service above his
private ambitions and aspirations,
and, offering himself for military
service, he went into camp, where,
however, he met with an unfortunate
accident, which delayed his depar-
ture for some considerable time.
He left Australia for the front
in April 1918. The youngest

South Australia, on September 25,

1887, and is a fourth son of the late
Ronald MacDonald, a grazier of
that place. The latter gentleman
came to Australia with his father,
the late Archibald MacDonald, in
the ship “Hercules,” in the year
1851, being at that time only 10
years of age, the family having left
the home which had sheltered so
many generations of their ancestry
for centuries past. The home of
these MacDonalds was situated on
the mainland of Scotland, in that
portion which is just opposite the
Isle of Skye, and their name sug-
gests all that is bold and adven-
turous to the student of Scottish
history, and the brave deeds of this
clan have been recorded in rhyme
and story as well as in the history of
“The land of brown heath and
shaggy wood; land of the mountan
and the flood,” since long before the
days of the greatness of the British
Emjnre, of which it was proudly to
become a part in later times. The
war-like progenitors of the MacDon-
ald family followed agrarian pursuits
when not engaged in the settling of
clan disputes. In later times of
peace, the spirit which prompted
these warriors to the performance of
heroic feats was replaced in their
posterity by one of adventure, and
thus we find the then young Scotch
pioneer leaving his ancient home
with wife and bairns to seek
fortune under the Southern Cross.
On arrival in South Australia
the original founder of this
branch of the MacDonald family
became engaged in pastoral work,
and in course of time his son too
became the owner of grazing lands
in that State, where they established
a reputation for honour and in-
dustry, and where their advent was
considered as having been in every
way beneficial to the community.
The late Roland MacDonald followed
grazing pursuits practically for the
term of his life, and on his home
near Crystal Brook his family of five
sons and three daughters were born.
He died in Queensland, where he
had settled later, in the year 1906.
His widow is living in retirement in
Brisbane, and her sons, with the
exception of Mr. Alan Finlayson
MacDonald, have followed their
father’s avocation. The latter gentle-
man enlisted in the Australian
Imperial Forces shortly after the
outbreak of the Great War.
He was attached to the Aus-
tralian Fifth Light Horse, and took
part in the campaign in Palestine.
Three other of her sons also volun-
teered in their country’s cause, but
failed to pass the medical test. The
subject of our memoir was educated
both in South Australia and Queens-
land, completing his scholastic
studies at Toowoomba at the age of
15, and on leaving school went
immediately on to his father’s
property in the vicinity of that
town. Then he learnt the first
principles of the industry, and
remained, assisting in the adminis-
tration and working of the acres
surrounding the paternal rooftree
until that gentleman’s decease.
Following this bereavement he
entered upon a career of stock-
dealing in Western Queensland,
which he pursued with considerable
success until the year 1914, when he
purchased his present estate from
Mr. John Vetter, comprising about
20,000 acres, which originally formed
a part of “Dillalah” Station. This
property, which is called “Loddon,”
was considerably improved at the
time Mr. MacDonald entered in
MR. A. J. MACDONALD.
possession, and he has continued his
predecessor’s policy, so that to-day
the estate is as well developed as
any area of equal size in the west.
The land is of good carrying
capacity, and both sheep and cattle
are run. The homestead, which is
modern and comfortable, is situated
about 45 miles from Charleville and
three miles from Loddon Siding,
which is situated on the property.
Mr. MacDonald takes a due share
in any of the local movements which
have been set afoot for the welfare
of the district of his choice. He is a
member of the Central Warrego
Pastoralists’ Association and of the
Warrego Club, and a member of the

married in 1916 Louisa, third
daughter of Mr. Robert Douglas, of

HARRY LAWRENCE KIL-
ROY, “Begonia,” Mitchell, was
born at Ipswich, in the State of
Queensland, on May 23, 1871, and
is a son of Mr. Thomas Kilroy,
MR. THOS. KILROY.
of “Glenroy,” Kalbar, a pioneer
of the Fassifern district. Mr.
Thomas Kilroy hails from Athlone,
County West Meath, where the
lands still in possession of the family
have been owned by them for over
a century, a younger brother of the
last-named gentleman being the
present occupant. Mr. Kilroy, sen.,
after arrival in Queensland, en-
gaged in cotton-growing in the Ip-
swich district, subsequently trans-
ferring his energies to the Fassifern
district, where he was the only set-
tler to experiment with this crop.
In 1876, he took up a selection on
the resumed portion of “Moograh,”
comprising 640 acres, and to this he
has since added by purchase and
further selection, until, in the
year 1917, he held one of the
finest freehold properties in the
district, with an acreage running
into five figures. Upon this home-
stead—to which he gave the name
of “Glenroy”—Mr. Killroy has since
resided. He married at Ipswich,
Mary, daughter of the late Mr.
McAnallan, a native of Armagh,
Ireland, and owner of “Kent’s La-
goon,” a grazing property in the
Fassifern district, and has a family
of two sons and two daughters. Mr.
Harry Lawrence Kilroy received his
education at St. Mary’s School,
Ipswich, and, at the termination of
his studies at sixteen years of age,
turned his attention actively in the
direction of pastoral pursuits. Prior
to this date, when only a lad of
thirteen, he had undertaken a drov-
ing trip during a school vacation,
being entrusted with the charge of
some herd bulls, which lie success-
fully travelled from “Fassifern”
Station to “Taabinga” Station, on
behalf of the Weinholt Estates Com-
pany, on the return journey bring-
ing a herd of cows from “Taabinga”
to “Trelawney,” for Mr. Edward
Seeley. After finishing school and
upon reaching man’s estate, he
selected country on his own
account, adjoining his father’s
property, and, after fulfilling the
conditions necessary to render the
holding freehold, he sold it to
his father, himself coming west-
wards in search of larger scope for
his enterprise. In 1894, he pur-
chased “Maryvale” Station, near
Morven, which he conducted for
about two years, and, subsequently,
disposing of this holding, took up
the forfeited lease of “Annievale. ”
Stocking the new property, and
'starting operations thereon, even-
tually Mr. Kilroy sold the run as
a going concern to Sir Samuel Mc-
Caughey, and, purchasing an un-
improved block of land from the
late Thomas Marsh, of “Hills-
borough,” near Mitchell, formed
“The Overflow” Station, which, at
a later date, he sold to Mr. Joseph
Goodyear. After disposing of “The
Overflow,” Mr. Kilroy resided in
Roma, occupying himself mainly
with stock-dealing, until, when the
“Rookwood” Station territory was

resumed by the Government, he
drew by ballot his present home-
stead area, a block of something
over 6,000 acres, to the develop-
ment of which he has since devoted
his time and attention. Various
additions have been made to the
property from time to time, large
areas of adjoining country being
secured as opportunity occurred,
MR. H. L. KILROY.
and some 40,000 acres are now un-
der the personal administration of
Mr. Kilroy, who uses it as a run
for both sheep and cattle. Mr. Kil-
roy has made a reputation for him-
self as a capable judge of stock, and,
in this capacity, is closely associ-
ated with one of the largest cattle-
dealing firms in Australia. His
many interests absorb every minute
of his time, and preclude partici-
pation in the public organizations
of the district. He married in
1900 Mary Sophie, second daughter
of the late Henry Welge, of Fassi-
fern, and has a family of five sons
and three daughters.

explorer. Subsequently owned by
Messrs. Claudius Cheesborough
McDonald and Michael Carrol, and
later, soley by the former gentleman,
LIEUT. F. L. CAVAYE, R.N.
it was purchased from Mr. McDon-
ald by Sir Samuel Wilson and
Mr. Donald Wallace, who held it in
partnership for five years, at the end
of which period, a dissolution having
been agreed to, it was divided,
the land comprising the present
“Logan Downs” remaining in the
possession of Sir Samuel, while the
remainder, now known as “Kilcum-
min,” was retained by Mr. Wallace.
In 1883 the “Logan Downs” end
was sold by Sir Samuel Wilson to
Mr. George Fairbairn, whose work
and enterprise in the days of early
settlement are so widely recognized.
Mr. Fairbairn retained the pro-
perty until his death, when it
passed to his son, Mr. Frederick
Fairbairn. At time of writing it
embraces a large area which is
devoted principally to cattle, though,
the country being adaptable for
either class of stock, it also depas-
tures a flock which is kept up to an
approximate strength of 100,000,
and a herd of about 6,000 head.
Both the Peak and Denham
Ranges traverse the property, add-
ing a rugged beauty to the landscape
where they occur and providing deep
shelter in their valleys that proves
of distinct advantage to the stock.
Mr. Cavaye, the managing partner,
on behalf of the firm, secured and
improved large tracts of cattle
country previously regarded as
valueless owing to the lack of per-
manent water —a drawback which
has been obviated by conservation
on an elaborate scale. Wherever
practicable, overshot dams have been
formed by the erection of cement
walls. Tanks also conserve immense
supplies, which are amply supple-
mented by many sub-artesian bores
and wells, the water from these
various sources being raised by the
action of about sixty windmills that
are equipped with up-to-date
troughing, and, in the event of the
wind failing, are worked by oil and
petrol engines. The country is
being developed with the object of
ensuring a still more abundant water
supply, and if the boring operations
now in progress prove even fairly
successful, the carrying capacity will
be considerably augmented and the
already large numbers composing
the flocks and herds greatly in-
creased. In regard to the machin-
ery and other necessary plant for
working a large and progressive
pastoral concern, “Logan Downs” is
in the front line, its workshops being
so efficiently equipped that all black-
smithing, general, and most of the
engineering repairs are effected on
the station. The woolshed is a large,
roomy and solidly constructed build-
ing, and, though of more than forty
years’ standing, is considerably ahead
of many of the more modern erec-
tions of its kind. It contains forty

selections. Most of these quarters
and shearers’ huts are new, and, like
the sheep, cattle, horse yards, dips,
etc., are solidly constructed. Con-
crete has been an important factor
in carrying out most of the improve-
ments, this lasting material having
been used in the formation of the
several dips, for the lining of iron
storage tanks, and other purposes.
The fencing, which includes 250
miles of wire-netted boundary and
sub-divisional erections on the sheep
areas and a considerable mileage of
barbed-wire barriers on the cattle
country, is first-class both in respect
to construction and material, the
paddocks being numerous and
arranged in accordance with a
system which renders it possible to
work the place with convenience and
despatch. “Boonoke” blood princi-
pally was used in founding the flocks.
The herds are composed of Shorthorns

different parts of the country and as
far afield as India. To produce
such a standard as the property
enjoys in this regard has meant con-
siderable outlay of capital and the
application of keen knowledge of
block-stock. Situated about forty
miles from Clermont, the nearest
centre of railway communication,
and not far from the eastern boun-
dary of the Peak Downs district,
the homestead and its outbuildings
deserve more than passing mention.
Erected under the supervision of
Mr. Fairbairn, when he personally
administered the property, the main
dwelling is typical of the very com-
fortable pastoral home of the period,
and during late years many up-to-
date alterations have been effected
within and without the building,
which may now be described as
excelling both in old world charm
and in modern conveniences. The
house contains a billiard room. A
pretty garden, well-kept lawns and
a tennis court are pleasant features
of the immediate surroundings,
which are further beautified with
many ornamental trees, shrubs, and
vines; and the neat and modern
outbuildings tend to give the

though several of its members were
also represented in the navy, the
late General contributed five sons
to the army. Of these, one is
Major-General William Cavaye, late
Royal Sussex Regiment; another,
Colonel Cavaye, late of the Scottish
Borderers; and a third, Lieutenant-
Colonel Cavaye, late of the 79th
Highlanders; the fourth being Cap-
tain Cavaye, late of the 40th Foot;
and the fifth, Lieutenant Cavaye,
of the 24th Regiment, who met his
death at Isandula, when five com-
panies of his regiment were surprised
and destroyed by the Zulus. Mr.
Cavaye, of “Logan Downs” was
educated at Blair Lodge, a large
public school near Edinburgh, and
after leaving that institution, read
for the army in London, being so
engaged for about two years. In the
year 1875, being then in his teens,
he set out for Australia with
“Eurella” Station,” Southern
Queensland, then owned by an old
Edinburgh family named Duns-
mure, as his destination. After a
few months spent at “Eurella” he
accepted a post as jackaroo on
“Amby Downs,” near Mitchell, and
within a couple of years, he
was appointed overseer of the
latter station, a post which he
occupied for five years. In 1880 he
left “Amby Downs” to take over
the management of “Langton,” a
station in the Clermont district, in
which he purchased a share from
Messrs. Singleton and Menzies, who,
jj2
previous to his advent, were the sole
owners. He was associated with
“Langton” for seventeen years, the
firm of which he was a member,
later adding “Cotherstone” to their
interests. In the year 1896 he voy-
aged to the old world and was ab-
sent from Australia several months.
On his return in 1897, his pastoral
investments having been seriously
affected by a severe drought of the
period, he disposed of his interests in
both “Langton” and “Cotherstone”
and journeyed to New South Wales.
After a few months spent in the
Mother State he set out for Canada
with the intention of there settling
on the land should conditions prove
favourable, but a cabled communi-
cation received shortly after his
arrival caused him to return to
Queensland, where he took over, on
behalf of Mr. Frederick Fairbairn,
the management of ‘ Logan Downs.”
He entered upon his duties here in
the late nineties, and became a
partner later. Mr. Cavaye was
created a Justice of the Peace
in the year 1882. He has been
a councillor of the Belyando
Shire for a number of years. In
1886 he married Emily, daughter of
the late Thomas Hatfield, one of the
oldest pastoral pioneers of Queens-
land, who will be well remembered as
the owner of “Yatton” and
“Fleurs,” two very old grazing pro-
perties of Central and Central-west
Queensland. Of the union there is
a family of two sons and four
daughters. Of the latter, one
became the wife of Harold Murphy,
a son of the late Frank Murphy, of
“Northampton Downs,” and a
grandson of Sir Francis Murphy, a
prominent Victorian pastoralist
during his lifetime and a notable
politician in the early days of the
then Colony, while another married
Mr. 8. A. Josephson, a son of Judge
Josephson and a member of the well-
known Sydney firm of Waugh and
Josephson. His eldest son, Lieuten-
ant Frederick Langton Cavaye,
R.N., is at time of writing (1921)
in command of H.M.A.S. “Stal-
wart.” Lieutenant Cavaye was born
at “Langton” and educated in
England, and after passing through
Osborne and Dartmouth Naval Col-
leges, entered the Royal Navy.
During the Great War of 1914-18 he
served on H.M.A.S. “Sydney,” and
participated in the historical action
in which the “Emden” was captured.
Very shortly after the “Emden”
engagement he was transferred to

ARCHER MACARTHUR BOW-
MAN, “Tarcombe,” Longreach, was
born at Ipswich, Queensland, on May
3, 1873. He is the ninth son of the
late William Macarthur Bowman,
MR. W. M. BOWMAN.
and a direct descendant on the
maternal side of John Macarthur, of
Camden, to whose practical and
strenuous efforts in the early years
of the last century Australia owes
the foundation of the great wool-
growing industry. The late William
Macarthur Bowman was a son of Dr.
Bowman, who is recorded as being
attached to the General Hospital,
Sydney, as early as the year 1820,
his valuable services in this connec-
tion being mentioned in the work
entitled “Records of the Macarthurs
of Camden,” which besides being a
faithful record of the incidents
connected with the introduction of
fine-woolled sheep to Australia and
the subsequent progress of the
industry, throws much light on
various interesting events of the
period. In November, 1823, Dr.
Bowman married Mary, second
daughter of the founder of the
Macarthur family in Australia. His
son, William Macarthur Bowman,
was a well-known figure in the
pastoral world for many years, and
was occupied with the management of
the historical “Mount Brisbane”
Station on behalf of the Bigge
brothers, from the late sixties until
1891, residing on that estate with
his family during the whole of that
period. Mr. Archer M. Bowman
was primarily educated by tutors at
the old “Mount Brisbane” Station,
and when sixteen years of age, was
sent to the King’s School, Parra-
matta, New South Wales, remaining
at that academy, which has been the
Alma Mater of so many notable
Australians through succeeding gen-
erations of our history, until the
attainment of his twentieth year.
From school he proceeded to “Van-
rook” Station, near Normanton, in
the far north, a property then owned
by the Bank of New South Wales,
whereon he immediately took up the
duties of head stockman, the know-
ledge of stock obtained during his
boyhood under his elder brothers at
“Mount Brisbane,” combined with
his natural ability, having well fitted
him for such a post. That it was no
sinecure may be inferred from the
fact that “Vanrook,” which was
MR. A. M. BOWMAN, JUN.
devoted to horned stock, pastured at
that time nearly 30,000 head of
cattle, the operations connected with
the working of this vast herd being
on a correspondingly extensive scale,
tie carried out the duties connected
with his post for three and a half
years, severing his connection there-
with when an opportunity offered,
whereby he and his late brother,
Frank, were enabled to take up
country in partnership. They ac-
quired a holding quite on the “edge
of beyond” which they called “Rut-
land Plains,” and carried on for 12
years. This property was the farthest
out pastoral country in the peninsula
and infested with natives of a partic-
ularly treacherous character, some of
whom, eventually, were responsible
for the death of Mr. Frank Bowman,
who was speared by the blacks at
“Rutland Plains” as recently as the
year 1911. This tragedy led to the
disposal of the place, which was pur-
chased by Messrs. Curr Bros., who in
turn sold out to Mr. Sidney Kidman.
Some years prior to the tragic death
of Mr. Frank Bowman, the brothers
had acquired “Weivehurst,” a cattle
station on the Burnett, in 1906,
where both resided for a time, and it
fell to Mr. A. M. Bowman to super-
vise the management of the property
during the frequent absences of
his brother at “Rutland Plains.”
“Weivehurst” was sold in the year
1910, and owing to the indifferent
state of his health as the result of
the hardships and many adverse
conditions connected with his pion-
eering work in the North, Mr. A.
Bowman decided to spend some time
in less strenuous avocations, and with
this end in view, acquired a dairying
property in the Brisbane Valley. On
regaining his wonted health, how-
ever, he sold out this concern and
purchased his present holding, “Tar-
combe,” entering into possession in
the year 1912. “Tarcombe” at that
time was but partially improved, a
state of things which he immediately
set about to remedy, spending some
thousands of pounds in develop-
mental work in order to bring the

and is the eldest son of the late
Edward Rowland Edkins, one of the
pioneers of the great pastoral areas
MR. J. RULE.
of Northern and Central Queens-
land, his first arrival in the then
Colony dating back to the early
fifties. Records to hand show that
the advent of the late gentleman to
the Gulf country occurred in the
year 1856 in company with the late
Mr. Cornish, his motive being to
take over the management of
“Beanesbrook” cattle station, but
the fatal illness of the last-mentioned
gentleman, who had contracted Gulf
fever, prevented him from persever-
ing with this intention, and resulted
in his return to more civilized parts
on the death of his companion a few
days after their arrival. In conse-
quence of a meeting with Mr. W.
Glen Walker, of Sydney, in the year
1861 while in the Riverina district,
New South Wales, his thoughts were
again directed to the north, having
accepted an invitation to meet that
gentleman in the following year at
“Ballarang” Station, on Gil Gil
Creek, in the Mother State. The
result was that in 1862 he once more
set out for the Gulf, being in charge
of 1,500 head of cattle destined to
depasture country in the far north
of Queensland taken up by Mr.
Walker and a partner some time pre-
viously. At the time this trip was
undertaken another mob of 1,500
was being travelled along the same
route by Mr. G. Sawtelle, the plan
of operations being to spell the
animals near the head of the Flin-
ders River until a port should be
opened at the Gulf. Upon reaching
Rockhampton the late Mr. Edkins
with the consent of his employer
undertook the overlanding of 800
head from Mr. Robert Stewart
(formerly adjutant 97th High-
landers), in conjunction with his
other mob, and keeping the smaller
lot behind the others arrived safely
in the vicinity of Port Denison.
From there he assisted in placing the
cattle for a time upon “Bluff
Downs,” “Mary Vale,” and
“Wando Vale,” by which arrange-
ments the holders of these runs were
enabled to declare their country
stocked, which had to be done at
latest by April, 1863. After spend-
ing a few months in the employ of
Messrs. Walker & Co. in this
locality Mr. Edkins left on Decem-
ber 27, 1862, for Victoria, where he
had to attend to some business on
behalf of his mother. Subsequently
he gave his attention to the acquire-
ment of expert knowledge on the
subject of pleuro-pneumonia, and in
1864 returned to Queensland, where
he was employed by Mr. Glen
Walker to inoculate a number of
cattle on his runs out from Rock-
hampton. After accomplishing that
work he took 2,000 cows out to
“Wando Vale” for Messrs. Walker
and Co., and upon his arrival in
October of the same year was
entrusted with the despatch of
about 8,000 head of cattle from that

and the “Cargeen” and “Prairie”
runs, at the head of the Flinders
River, the first mob being taken out
by Mr. Walker’s partner, who with

them stocked the “Taldora” country
on the Flinders and Saxby Rivers,
which he had previously taken up.
During the following two years Mr.
Edkins sent out the balance of the


cattle, and in April, 1866, proceeded
to Burketown to assume the manage-
ment of a boiling-down establishment
which had been founded there
shortly before by Messrs. Glen
Walker, Morehead, & Young. Mr.
Walker withdrawing from the con-
cern, Mr. Edkins controlled opera-
tions for the remaining proprietors
for about ten months, but the
proposition proving unsatisfactory he
relinquished the connection, and in
March, 1867, left “Taldora” with
3,000 bullocks, which he over-
landed to the head of the Darling
River. This journey was success-
fully accomplished, and the 3,000
cattle were safely delivered at
“Medindie” Station, realizing £4
per head. Returning to Melbourne
he there met his future wife, Miss
Huey, and after his marriage
returned to Burketown accompanied
ships and the low prices obtained for
the stock that the decision was
arrived at after six years to bring
the cattle further south and abandon
the northern run, a mistaken policy
as events turned out, the discovery
of the Palmer goldfields a short time
afterwards raising the price of fat
cattle from a few shillings to £8 per
head. The stock, however, were
transferred to “Mount Cornish”
and throve excellently, the herd
increasing to 60,000 head, all of
pure shorthorn strain. Mr. and Mrs.
Edkins resided on “Mount Cornish"
for 30 years, becoming well and
favourably known among all the
pioneer station owners of the far
west. The late Mr. Edkins was one
of the most optimistic believers in
the ultimate prosperity of Queens-
land, and while at “Mount Cornish"
acquired interests in “Lawn Hill,"
remained under his father’s roof for
the brief period intervening his
school days and his initial entry into
the industry for which he was
intended, his first position being in
the capacity of a jackaroo at “Ken-
sington" Station, in the vicinity of
Muttaburra, under the supervision
of the late Mr. John Cameron. At
the end of two years, during which
he benefited largely by the wide
experience of that very able sheep-
man, he took up “Bimbah," which
was a part of “Mount Cornish,” the
old station which had been his home
in childhood. Subsequently he
joined forces with Mr. Francis
Campbell, the partners acquiring
further grazing areas, with the
result that the aggregate acreage of
the firm very soon increased to a
figure in the vicinity of 300,000. The
estates owned by Messrs. Edkins,
by Mrs. Edkins, who had decided to
share with him the perils and respon-
sibilities of his life in Queensland.
Mr. Edkins at this time accepted
charge of the “Beanesbrook” herd
of cattle in the interests of the
Scottish Pastoral Investment Com-
pany, with whom he continued until
1869, when it was decided by the
owners to recall this herd from the
Gulf. The work he had undertaken
was far from light, the task of look-
ing after some 18,000 head of cattle
on unfenced country being one of
extreme difficulty, while the
treachery of the blacks made the
situation very dangerous. Every man
had to be well armed, and in spite
of all precautions Captain Huey, a
brother of Mrs. Edkins, who was on
a visit from India, was murdered
with two station hands within 25
miles of the homestead. It was on
account of the indescribable hard-

“Roxburgh Downs," “Hardington,”
and other station properties. His
death occurred at Sydney, New
South Wales, on September 14,
1905. Mrs. Edkins will be long
remembered in the north as a
liberal-minded woman and a charm-
ing hostess and also an accomplished
pianiste. She is the composer of a
valse entitled “The American
Fleet," dedicated to Admiral Sperry
on his visit to Australia in the year
1908. Mr. E. R. H. Edkins, the
gentleman under review, was edu-
cated at the Church of England
Grammar School, Launceston, Tas-
mania, completing his scholastic
course at Wesley College, an academy
well known throughout Australia as
having been the Alma Mater of some
of her most talented and brilliant
sons. On the conclusion of his col-
legiate career at the age of 17
years he returned to Queensland and
Campbell, & Co. include “Bimbah,"
“Malboona," “Shirley" and other
properties of lesser import, all of
which are typical examples of the
high-class country for which the dis-
trict is noted, being admirably
watered from natural sources as well
as by the artificial supplies resulting
from that important sphere of deve-
lopment. Merino sheep raising is
the principal industry controlled by
Mr. Edkins from “Bimbah," though
considerable attention is given to the
breeding of both equine and horned
stock of exceptional strains. The
aggregate number of sheep which
compose the flocks grazed on the
several estates averages a figure
between 80,000 and 100,000. These
have been worked for many years on
“Canowie" blood, and kept true to
type by the annual introduction of
fresh young rams from the well-
known stud so named. The number


of horses is between 700 and 800
head, comprising both blood and
draughts, those of the latter bred at
“Bimbah” including winners which
have scored high honours at various

shows, notably at the Sydney Royal
Show, a “Bimbah” draught stallion
having been recorded as first prize
winner against all Australian com-
petitors. Another draught stallion
which is New Zealand bred and now
in use on the property, has the dis-
tinction of having carried off three
championships in the Dominion, and
among the mares on this well-known
estate there have been and are
several high-class prize winners.
“Bimbah” also boasts a very choice
stud of shorthorn cattle, the bulls,
which have been introduced from the
best herds in Australia, having
already achieved an enviable repu-
tation for their progeny, and thus
helped to make the fame of the
“Bimbah” shorthorns. The home-
stead, which is situated 14 miles
from the town of Longreach, in a
north-easterly direction, may be
described as one of the most
comfortable homes in the west, Mr
Edkins having successfully achieved
that most desirable object in the
architecture of his up-to-date resi-
dence. Its site on a high bank
overlooking the Thompson River
provides a glorious panoramic view
of the surrounding country stretch-
ing far beyond the cultivated area
in the near vicinity of the home-
stead. The grounds of the latter
are beautified by many fruit trees
and in its immediate neighbourhood
by a delightful garden, which amply
repays the care bestowed upon it
under the direction of Mrs. Edkins.
A vegetable garden is another
successful feature of this ideal
pastoral proposition. The interior of
the dwelling contains the many
innovations and conveniences which
are too often lacking in country
homes, Mr. Edkins having to a
great extent pioneered the initiation
of such up-to-date accessories, an
example which has been followed by
many of his brother pastoralists.
The house receives illumination from
an electric-light installation, and
water is laid on throughout. A high
degree of development has been
attained both on “Bimbah” and the

include those conducted by the well-
known firm of Messrs. Edkins,

he is chairman of directors. He was
created a Justice of the Peace by
the Liberal Administration a
quarter of a century ago, and has
played a particularly prominent
part in the communal life of the
Central West, his efforts having been
largely responsible for many phases
of its progress, while his initiative
and support are regarded as impor-
tant factors towards the ultimate
success of any public movement. He
is one of the founders of the Long-
reach Shire Council, and holds the
distinction of having been the first
occupant of the presidential chair,
which he has since filled on numer-
ous occasions to the satisfaction of
all concerned. Mr. Edkins is
president of the Pastoralists and
Grazing Farmers’ Association of
Central and Northern Quensland and
the Pastoral and Agricultural Show
Society. Indeed, the business of an
honorary nature performed by him
would be more than sufficient to
occupy the leisure of several ordin-
ary men. He is regarded as a
prominent figure in the realms of
sport and in his capacity of presi-
dent of the Longreach Jockey Club,
Longreach Amateur Race Club, and
other sporting bodies has done much
to further their interests. He is the

JOHN AMBROSE DALY,
“Valeria,” Capella, was born at
“Mount Douglas,” in the Belyando
district, on August 22, 1870. He
is the second son of the late William
MR. J. A. DALY.
Daly, who, a native of Ireland and
hailing from County Antrim, arrived
in the late fifties in the Barcoo dis-
trict, Queensland, where he imme-
diately identified himself with the
pastoral industry. The late gentle-
man was for a considerable time
well known as a member of the
“Bowen Downs” staff. In 1869 he
proceeded to the Peak Downs dis-
trict and became the purchaser of
what at a later date became, and
continued to be, well known as the
“Mount Douglas” homestead. This
dwelling, which was termed a “road
house,” was situated on a Govern-
ment Reserve, and had been erected
for the convenience of squatters and
carriers travelling the long distances
between Bowen and the widely separ-
ated holdings. The founder of the
Daly family leased the land—origin-
ally known as “Lowlands”—in the
vicinity of the dwelling and started
grazing operations, and, having
secured a licence, carried on an hotel
business also, continuing to reside
here until the time of his death,
which occurred in 1876. He married
Mary Gallagher, who, of old Irish
descent, afforded throughout her life
a fine example of the womanhood to
which Australia owes so much. Of
the union there was born a family
of three sons and three daughters.
After the death of her husband Mrs.
Daly closed the hotel business and
entered upon the management of her
pastoral interests, continuing to
occupy the old road house as a sta-
tion homestead. During her admin-
istration “Lowlands” and an adjoin-
ing block were consolidated under
the Land Act of 1884 and given the
name of “Mount Douglas,” and
later, further adjoining lands were
added to this now well-known pro-
perty, which at time of writing is
managed, in his own and sister’s
behalf, by her youngest son. The
widow of the late William Daly re-
married, taking as her second
husband Mr. John Hopkins, there
being a family of three by this
union. Mr. John Ambrose Daly
entered upon the management of
“Mount Douglas” in 1890 and held
the reins of control for the following
twenty-nine years, during which he
faced exceptionally severe droughts
and heavy reverses and fought the
many obstacles which came in his
way with the same qualities of grit
and perseverance which distinguished
his forbears. He was working 10,000
cattle on “Mount Douglas” pre-
vious to the 1902 drought, all of
which, with the exception of less than
200, succumbed to its ravages, of
the few saved some having been mus-
tered a couple of hundred miles from
the station. Of a mob of 600 horses
there was a salvage of 75 after this
drought. Poor markets were among
the adversities with which Mr. Daly
had to contend, and, as a contrast
to present prices, it is worthy of
mention that when affairs were at
their lowest ebb at “Mount
Douglas” the prices of fat stock
ranged from 355. to 455. This sta-
tion has always borne an enviable
reputation in regard to the quality
of its horned and equine stock, the
former invariably realizing top
prices in the district, while the horses
bred here in Mr. J. A. Daly’s time
were in keen demand for the Indian
market. In 1900 “Mount Douglas”
was formed into a company concern
in which all the family held a pro-
prietary interest, and this arrange-
ment continued for about nineteen
years, at the end of which Mr. J.
A. Daly and his brother, Mr. W.
G. Daly, disposed of their interests
and separately acquired other pro-
perties. The former purchased
“Valeria,” stocked with about 950
cattle, 500 sheep, and some horses,
in the year 1919, from Mr. James
McFetridge, and immediately en-
tered into occupation, adding to the
stock with cattle to the number of
1,400 and about 200 horses from
“Mount Douglas.” With these assets
he is now engaged in further devel-
oping his property, which embraces
nearly 70,000 acres of good cattle
country comjjrised of ironbark and
brigalow flats and bloodwood ridges,
and further characterized by a pro-
lific growth of forest, Mitchell, blue,
and many other varieties of grass
and several species of edible scrub,
among which yellow-wood and white-
wood predominates. Surface water
supplies in the holes of Carbine and
Theresa Creeks and adjacent lagoons
are supplemented by wells, to which
are attached windmills, and at time
of writing, Mr. Daly is laying out
considerable capital in bore sinking.
Seven large paddocks and a smaller
enclosure for the sheep have been
formed. The homestead lies some
13 miles from Capella, and is com-
fortable and homelike and furnished
with many up-to-date conveniences.
Mr. Daly takes a deep interest in
the public life of the Peak Downs
district. Under the Amended Local
Authorities Act he was nominated
in the year 1921 for a seat on the
council of the Peak Downs Shire,
the ratepayers expressing by a large
majority of votes the confidence they
placed in him and electing him head
of the poll. As a committeeman of

CHARLES HENRY DALY, “Mt.
Douglas” Station, Clermont, was
born at Bowen, Queensland, on
September 17, 1872, and is the
youngest son of the late William
Daly, who became the owner of the
historical station known as “Mt.
Douglas” (which has remained in
the same family for a longer period
than any other pastoral area in the
South Kennedy district) as far back
as the year 1869, the property then
being known as “Lowlands”. Mr.
William Daly hailed from Antrim
and made his advent to Queensland
in the late fifties, from which period
until the date of his acquirement
of “Lowlands”, he followed the
pastoral industry in the Barcoo and
Muttaburra districts, successively.
With the purchase of “Lowlands”
and what was formerly a “road
house” on a Government Reserve and
used as a stopping place by the
station-holders on the way to their
far distant homes “outback,” or car-

educated under tutors. He was two
years of age at the time of his
father’s death and assimilated a
knowledge of stock and station work
with his growth. By the time he
was fourteen he was a good rider and
capable, with a couple of station
black boys for assistance, of taking
charge of a mob of 160 horses from
“Mt. Douglas” to Townsville (a dis-
tance of 220 miles) for market
through the sale-yards there, and of
carrying out other duties of a similar
nature. Ere leaving his teens he
had gained a very complete training
in the practical side of the industry,
while his keen powers of observation
had supplied much of the theoretical
knowledge which is included in the
curriculum of the modern training
colleges. His chief interests through-
out his life have been bound up
with those of his family at “Mt.
Douglas,” though in 1914 he added
thereto by the purchase of a share
in “Conway” Station, in the Bowen
district, in partnership with Mr.
Joseph Woolley. He personally
managed “Conway” for three
years, at the end of which he

on April 16, 1864, and is the only
son of the late Henry Bell, who, a
native of Gloucester, England,
Henry Bell’s father, the founder of
the line in this island continent,
came of a family which had branches
in Essex and Sussex, and was of old
standing in both those Counties. On
arrival in Australia he chose the
New England district as the scene
of his new home and labours, and
there followed agrarian pursuits, his
son, Mr. Henry Bell, having been
thus intimately associated with the
bush and made familiar with its
varied conditions from childhood
upwards. The late fifties found
him, still a youth, facing all the
hardships of the early goldfields, and
doubtless his experiences at this
time, which were of the sort cal-
culated to make or mar a man, had
their share in moulding his char-
acter and fitting him for the
pioneering achievements with which
his name is so honourably associated
in Northern Queensland —achieve-
ments ranking with those which

of the original members and the first
starter of the Mackay Turf Club,
occupying the latter position for
many years. For about seven years
previous to his death, which occurred
on January 29, 1915, he lived in
retirement in Mackay. The late

in the year 1907, being some time
afterwards joined by his brother-in-
law, Mr. George Skene, who acquired
a half share in this venture, which
has since been carried on in partner-
ship, the management of the place
devolving upon Mr. Skene. Later,
in the year 1917, he further in-
creased the acreage of his holdings
by the purchase of “Strathdee,” a
grazing selection near Nebo. The
dwelling has a south-westerly aspect
and its grounds have been laid out
into flower beds and lawns. “Strath-
dee” is situated about 55 miles from
Mackay and 10 miles from Nebo,
and embraces about 25,000 acres of
hilly, ridgy country which is tim-
bered chiefly with ironbark and
admirably adapted for grazing pur-
poses. The herd is composed of cross-

proving exceedingly suitable to the
class of country comprising “Strath-
dee.” “Cerito” is centrally situated
on the Suttor River, about 160 miles
from Mackay, and approximately
the same distance from Bowen,
Clermont, and Charters Towers. It
covers an area of 300 square miles
and is depastured with mixed stock
of the same class as that grazed on
“Strathdee,” the strength of the
herd being about 3,000. Mr. Bell’s
successful participation in various
athletic sports will still be remem-
bered by many who knew him in
the eighties, his reputation in this
respect having been widely estab-
lished in Central Queensland. Mr.
William H. Bell married in the year
1901 Annie Hyndman, daughter of
the late Archibald Ferguscn of
“Byerwin.” His family consists of
three sons and one daughter, the
sons being Archibald Henry, Wil-
liam Hyndman, and George Fer-
guson Bell, who were born on
April 25, 1902; January 24, 1904;
and January 11, 1910, respectively,
and at time of writing are pursuing
their education at the Southport
Church of England Grammar
School, the daughter, Jessie Mar-
garet, being the youngest member
of the family.

late Thomas Barclay, whose forbears
during many past generations had
devoted themselves to agricultural
pursuits in their native land. James
Barclay was educated at a public

Cross lay possibilities which could be
turned to golden account with no
other capitalization but the will and
ability to work—a conviction which,
though not realized so speedily or
easily as the optimism of a young
man was likely to calculate, was
nevertheless fully justified by his
subsequent career, in which novelty
and adventure were in no wise lack-
ing, though his experience was very
dearly and hardly bought. In the
year 1888 he landed as an absolute
stranger at Townsville and immedi-
ately sought such work as might be
obtainable, securing, very shortly, a
post as oarsman on a ferry boat
which he held until presented with
the opportunity of becoming a sailor
on one of the vessels then plying the
coast. The binding conditions of a
seafaring life and the vague and
tardy chances of advancement were
galling to a man of his temperament,
however, and after a time he decided
to try his luck ashore, having to
accomplish his freedom from condi-
tions so little to his liking by decamp-
ing, and subsequently, for a time,
to use a good deal of caution so as
to avoid a forcible return to them.
It was not long before fate decreed
that he should seek and obtain
employment at bridge-building from

two years, followed tin, copper, and

with considerable success, afterwards
journeying to New Guinea, on the
north-east coast of which island he
prospected considerably also, though
with unsatisfactory results. While
in New Guinea he contracted a
severe attack of malaria, in conse-
quence of which, when sufficiently
recovered, he returned to the main-
land and directed his steps to the
mining district vicinal to Charters

tralia during the year 1901, and
finding that, owing to the drought
conditions then prevailing, it was im-
possible to prospect far into the
interior, he became interested in
small gold shows on the edge of the
Charters Towers field. When the
drought broke he again ventured
inland and worked with varied suc-
cess until he made his advent to the
district outlying Ravenswood. Here,
near Ravenswood Junction, he took
up a mine known as the “Golden
Valley” that had been abandoned
long before, and erecting machinery
for pumping, soon had the satisfac-
tion of proving the soundness of his
judgment and the value of his
strenuously acquired knowledge, for

having furnished with a battery, he
worked in partnership with his step-
brother, Mr. Murdoch McKenzie,

success, the partnership being dis-
solved in the latter year owing to
the departure of Mr. McKenzie for
Scotland. From Dreghorn Mr. Bar-
clay proceeded to the then newly-
discovered gold field named “Mount
Coolon,” which had been originally
prospected by Mr. Luke Reynolds,
a miner of the old school and of the
type to which the industry owes
much. Mr. Barclay purchased the
claim held by Mr. Reynolds and his
partner, Mr. Kelly, and at once set
out to develop his new possession.
Here his experience stood by him
to good purpose, for after sinking

of the Ambrose Silver and Copper

gained additional experience. After
a time, preferring to work again on

spot personally selected, to discover
what other expenditure’ the venture
warranted, he was rewarded by
discovering what he considered a

within four months of his advent to
the field, the regular sound of the

Native Bear has reached the stage
of being one of the best-equipped
Queensland mines held by a single
owner. His success in the industry

properly applied intelligence, and a
force of character capable of over-
coming obstacles which would have

days it cost him £l2 a ton to bring

type and a vacuum cyanide plant of
the very latest design are noticeable
among the improvements connected
with this mine, at which, as well as
at the mills, additional up-to-date
machinery is being erected as
required, no effort or expense being
spared in the treatment of the ores.
The mine is situated about two miles
from the mill, the latter being built
on Police Creek, in which there is
an almost permanent supply of good
water. Mr. Barclay and his family
occupy a large brick residence which
is provided to the last detail with
those essentials of comfort that are
the outcome of modern mechanical
science. The house is furnished with
spacious verandahs and the rooms
are lofty and excellently ventilated.

CHARLES HERON, “Tedlands”
Station, near Koumala, via Mackay,
was born at Rockhampton, Queens-
land, on October 1, 1868, and is a
son of the late Charles Heron, who,

England, was one of the first settlers
of the Sarina district. A descendant

MR. L. L. HERON.
the late gentleman fully appreci-
ated the prospects of making
good in a country whose greatest
need he had learned was then, as it
is now, an influx of energetic
colonists. Accordingly, when still a
young man, he set out for Australia,
and, in the early sixties, and after a
voyage of about six months duration
lauded at Rockhampton, Central
Queensland. From Rockhampton,
at that time an infant settlement,
he proceeded to the Dawson Valley
district, where he obtained work as
a station hand. There he worked to
such purpose that in a comparatively
brief space of time he was in a posi-
tion to return to Rockhampton and
open a butchering business, which
occupied him on the northern side
of the Fitzroy until his preference
for pastoral life resulted in his
establishing himself in the dairying
industry at Stoney Creek, some
distance outside the town. Dairying-
occupied him here until the year
1882, when he sold his })roperty and
overlanded his stock and effects to
Plane Creek, where he selected as a
grazing proposition portion of the
area originally comprising old
“Homebush” Station. With the
expansion of the sugar industry
around Plane Creek (now Sarina),
he became interested in cane grow-
ing also, and otherwise identified
himself with the rapid development
which followed the advent of the
railway and the increase of the
population in this district, being
recorded as one of the original
directors of the Plane Creek Mill,
which he helped to establish. Both
grazing pursuits and cane growing
occupied him for very many years,
during which he played the part of
a progressive and upright citizen,
being looked up to by his fellows as
a man of his word and of unassail-
able integrity. At Alligator Creek,
when residing at the home of one of
his sons, he met death as the result
of an accident, being then at the age
of sixty-nine. He was survived by
a family of four sons and three
daughters. His second son, Mr.
diaries Heron, of “Tedlands”
MR. C. HERON, JUN.
Station, was educated at a school at
Stoney Creek, near Rockhampton,
which he attended until the late
Charles Heron sold his property
there, when, then at the age of
fifteen, he assisted in the overlanding
of the stock to the Plane Creek dis-
trict, continuing to work with his
father for the ensuing year. At six-

tively owned by the Atherton family
and the late Henry Bell occupied
him for three years, at the end of
which period he changed his occu-
pation by accepting a post as mail
carrier over the routes between
Lyndhurst and Georgetown. Near
the end of the eighties he again
entered into a droving engagement
with the Atherton family, for whom
he continued to travel stock until the
desire to gain wide pastoral experi-
ence led him to proceed further
north and take a post on the well-
known “Carpentaria Downs” Sta-
tion, where he remained until the
middle nineties, when he decided to
return to the district south of
Mackay. During his sojourn in the
Far North he saw a good deal of the
difficulties experienced by settlers
there as a consequence of the ill-
feeling which existed between some
of them and the aborigines. Mr.

Heron had personal experience of
the war-like tendencies of the blacks,
and recalls an occasion on which he
was able to assist the recovery of a
white man who had been speared.
In the year 1895 he returned to
Plane Creek and started on his own
account as a cane grower in the
outlying district as one of the
guarantors who undertook to grow
ten acres of cane and mortgaged
their land to the Government as
security for the erection of the mill
now owned by the Plane Creek Cen-
tral Milling Co. Subsequently, when
the mill was converted into a com-
pany concern, he became a member
of its directorate, in which capacity
he acted for three years. Finally he
abandoned sugar growing and re-
turned to the industry with which
he was earlier associated, accepting
a position which involved the over-
seership of mobs of cattle owned by
his father, Mr. H. Bell, and the
Atherton family. Meantime he had

of all forms of clean sport, and con-

minent part in all patriotic move-
ments, in which connection the resi-
dents of Sarina accorded to Mrs.
Heron the honour of unveiling the
monument to fallen soldiers which
adorns the main street of the town.
In the year 1895 he married Lucy
Ada, daughter of the late William
Lionel Langford, formerly well
known in Mackay as one of the
pioneer pilots of the port, Mr.
Langford having met death by
drowning while in the execution of
his duty nearly half a century ago.
Four sons and a daughter were born
to Mr. Heron. The eldest son, Leslie
Lionel, made the supreme sacrifice
during the Great War of 1914-18,
this young soldier having enlisted
and been accepted for service while
still in his teens. He participated
in operations on the Western Front,
and his name was among the missing
immediately after the battle of
Pozieres, but some time afterwards
it was ascertained that he was
amongst those killed in action. The
second son, William Albert, is en-
gaged, as already mentioned, in the
management of “Tedlands”; the
third, Percy Edward, is following
station life in Southern Queensland;
and the youngest, Clement Ralph, is
pursuing his education at Sarina.


WILLIAM ROBERTSON, “The
Hollow,” Miraui, near Mackay, is
a son of the late William Robert-
son, who, hailing from Lanarkshire,
Scotland, about the year 1840,
MR. WM. ROBERTSON.
formed a station on the Clarence
River, known as “Lanark Lodge.”
Mr. William Robertson, of “The
Hollow,” was born at “Lanark
Lodge” on June 25, 1845. He made
his advent to Queensland in the year
1870, having been appointed to the
management of the Australian Joint
Stock Bank (since merged into the
Australian Bank of Commerce,
Ltd.) at Mackay, after a period spent
in that Bank’s service in the South.
From the seventies, his interests
have been more o~ less identified
with the development of Mackay
tution operating in the town.
Before long he became financially
interested in “Habana” Plantation
in partnership with the late E. M.
Long. In those days the cane
growers, or “planters,” as they were
then called, all owned mills on their
properties, having, by their erection
and in various others ways, expended
immense sums in establishing the in-
dustry, which was then run on quite
different lines from those at present
pursued, the central mill system hav-
ing resulted from a variety of cir-
cumstances which arose with the
cessation of labour supplies from
Polynesia. Mr. Robertson was trans-
ferred from Mackay in the year
1875, and for some time was
engaged at different branches of the
Australian Joint Stock Bank in
Queensland, being eventually ap-
pointed to the management at
Rockhampton, a position which he
occupied until the year 1888, when
he retired in order to join his part-
ner at “Habana.” This plantation,
which Messrs. Long and Robertson
carried on conjointly, until the
death of the former, was situated on
the northern side of Mackay, and
was closed when Kanaka labour was
no longer available. In the year
1903 Mr. Robertson took over, on
behalf of the Messrs. C. C. and E.
S. Rawson, the management of
“The Hollow,” then a pastoral pro-
perty of old standing, being the third
run taken up in the Mirani district.
Mr. Charles C. Rawson —who is
now living in retirement near
London—and his brother were pro-
minent amongst the pastoralists of
the South Kennedy for more than
a quarter of a century, having car-
ried on the industry at “The

many who, like himself and Mrs. Rob-

parts in the great work of nation
building. Mr. Robertson, as a mem-
ber of the Board of Directors of the
Pleystowe Mill, is still keenly inter-
ested in the chief industry of Port
Mackay. In the past he did not
fail to identify himself with the
various movements instituted for
the progress of the district, his
membership of the Pioneer Divisional
and the outlying districts, and his
optimism contributed in no small
degree towards their early progress

WILLIAM CONYNGHAM US-
SHER, J.P., late of “Bombandy,”
St. Lawrence, is a son of the late
Henry Neville Ussher, who came to
Australia by the “City of Brisbane,”
SIR WILLIAM USSHER.
arriving at Moreton Bay on Septem-
ber 10, 1862, and who married in
April of the same year Sarah,
daughter of Mr. Philip Talbot, of
“Byfield,” near St. Lawrence. The
Ussher family is of great antiquity,
and includes many illustrious names
among its representatives in vari-
ous generations. Conspicuous among
these is that of Primate James Us-
sher, D.D., Lord Archbishop of
Armagh (1625-1656), the famous
scholar, antiquary, and divine, a
great-great-grandson of Arland Us-
cher or Ussher—the first of the name
—who appears to have been settled
in Dublin about 1439. Henry Us-
sher, an uncle of “Ireland’s greatest
scholar,” also held the Primacy
from 1595 to 1613. The most emi-
nent of his descendants was James
Ussher, a famous schoolmaster, and
partner in that profession with John
Walker, the author of the pronounc-
ing dictionary. Arland Ussher,
third of the name, was a distin-
guished Chancery lawyer, who mar-
ried a daughter of James Stanihurst,
the Recorder of Dublin and three
times Speaker of the Irish House of
Commons. Christopher, youngest
son of the first Arland Ussher, who
married into the great feudal family
now represented by Earl Fitzwilliam
and the Earl of Pembroke, was the
father of John Ussher, Alderman and
Collector of Customs, at whose ex-
pense and in whose house at Bridge-
foot, Dublin, was printed the first
book in the Irish language. His son,
Sir William Ussher, the elder, held
office as clerk of the Privy Council
from 1593 until the fall of Charles
I. in 1649. In his house and at his
expense was printed the first version
of the Irish New Testament. Among
other eminent men of the family
were John Ussher, Master of Chan-
cery from 1698 to 1721; the Rev.
Henry Ussher, D.D., S.F.T.C.D.,
first Astronomer Royal of Ireland
(1783-1790); Sir Thomas Ussher,
K.C.8., K.C.H., Rear-Admiral of
the Blue (1846-1862); and it is also
interesting to note that Arthur Wel-
lesley, Duke of Wellington, was de-
scended in a direct line from the
earliest of the Arland Usshers,
his great-grandmother being Mary,
daughter of the above-mentioned
MR. W. C. USSHER.
John, Master of Chancery. Mr. Wil-
liam Conyngham Ussher, the subject
of this review, was born at Yaamba
on April 26, 1866. He was droving for
several years, and in 1893 travelled
from Collaroy to Esk. In 1897 he
accepted the appointment of overseer
at “Mount Spencer” cattle station,
near Mackay, and, upon the retire-
ment of the manager, Mr. Dyson
Lacey, took over the reins of con-
trol, which he retained until 1911.
In 1901 and during his term of man-
agement at “Mount Spencer,” Mr.
Ussher entered into partnership with
his brother-in-law, Mr. F. J. C.
Brown, in the purchase of a grazing
farm near Nebo known as “South
Fort Cooper,” having an area of
20,000 acres. During the next two
or three years, when the great
drought descended on Queensland,
the firm became deeply indebted to
Mr. Graham Turner of “Boling-
broke,” who placed some well-
watered country at their disposal,
thus enabling them to emerge from
the ordeal with a loss of only 500
cattle and 50 horses. In 1905 the
jiartners obtained a lease of “Rook-
wood,” near St. Lawrence, embrac-
ing an area of 228 square miles,
which proved a fortunate venture
for the new leaseholders, who intro-
duced a large number of breeding
cattle from the “South Fort Coop-
er,” and reaped excellent returns
as a result of their enterprise. In
1911 Mr. Ussher left “Mount Spen-
cer,” and spent some time at
Mackay, later, in conjunction with
his partner, purchasing “Bom-
bandy” Station, near St. Lawrence,
the administration of which he per-
sonally supervised until 1920, when
he sold out to Mr. Brown. When the
“Waverley” stud was broken up. Mr.
Ussher purchased 50 blood horses,
including many of the best brood
mares in the stud. About 1890
Mr. Ussher was gazetted to the Com-
mission of the Peace by the Philp
Administration. For some years
he was a member of the Nebo
Shire Council. He was a member
of the Nebo Jockey Club and
of the Mackay Amateur Racing
Club, and one of the founders
of the Mackay Club. Mr. Ussher
married in 1900 Beatrice, daughter
MR. F. ERIC USSHER.
of the late Francis Brown, of “Iff-
ley” Station, and has a family of
two sons and two daughters. He is
now living in retirement at Tinfield,
Sydney.


PHILIP HOWARD USSHER,
J.P., “Lake Elphinstone” Station,
Nebo, via Mackay, was born at “By-
field,” near St. Lawrence, Queens-
land, on July 31, 1871, and is the
MR. H. N. USSHER.
second surviving son of the late
Henry Neville Ussher, who was a
descendant of a family which was
associated with the history of Wor-
cestershire from an early period of
English history, and a branch of
which was founded in Ireland about
the year 1439, when one Arland
Uscher, or Ussher, settled there.
Since then the name has been borne
by many who have distinguished
themselves either in professional or
civil occupations, notable among
these being Primate James Ussher,
D.D., Lord Archbishop of Armagh,
who lived until 1656 and was the
author of “Annales Yeteris et Novi
Testamenti,” a work of considerable
historic importance. He was third
in descent from the Arland Ussher
above mentioned. Of the sons of
Arland, Christopher, the youngest,
is recorded as having married into
the family of which Earl Fitz-
william, and the Earl of Pembroke
are now the chief representatives.
Christopher’s son was John Ussher,
Alderman and Collector of Customs,
who is said to have financed and
supervised in his house at Bridge-
foot, Dublin, the production of the

language. At the house of John’s
son, Sir William Ussher, the elder,
the Irish version of the New Testa-
ment was first rendered into print,
this work having been undertaken
and completed at Sir William’s ex-
pense. Sir William Ussher was
Clerk of the Privy Council for fifty-
six years (1593-1649), being deprived
of his office at the accession to power
of Oliver Cromwell as the head of
the Commonwealth after the execu-
tion of Charles I. Another member
of the family who was prominently
represented in the Established
Church was Henry Ussher, Primate
from 1595 to 1613; while yet
another Henry Ussher, bearing the
titles D.D., and S.F.T.C.D., was,
apart from his clerical distinction,
the first Astronomer Royal of Ire-
land (1783-90). One of the Primate’s
descendants was James Ussher,
notable for his success in the teach-
ing profession in which he was

engaged in conjunction with John
Walker, the author of the well-
known pronouncing dictionary bear-
ing his name. Amongst other mem-
to to
hers of the family who attained to
eminence was John Ussher, Master
of Chancery from 1698 to 1721. In
the navy the line was honourably
represented by Sir Thomas Ussher,
K.C.8., K.C.H., Rear-Admiral of
the Blue (1846-1862), and in the
army by a descendant on the
maternal side, and its most dis-
tinguished member, namely, Arthur
Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, who
sprang in direct descent from the
first Arland Ussher of Ireland, his
great-grandmother having been
Mary, daughter of the John Ussher,
Master of Chancery, mentioned
above. Henry Neville Ussher, the
father of the subject of this memoir,
was born at Long Preston, York-
shire, and was a son of the Rev.
William C. Ussher. It was intended
that he should become a clergyman
of the Church of England, but cir-
cumstances militating against the
project, he set out to carve a career
in the land of the Southern Cross,
voyaging to Queensland by the
“City of Brisbane,” and arriving at
his destination about three years
after the establishment into a
separate colony of the vast territory
formerly included within the bound-
aries of New South Wales and
designated previous to 1859 as the
Moreton Bay district. He quickly
adapted himself to the conditions of
the new land of his adoption, taking
such work as came to his hand, and
very shortly after his arrival we find
it recorded that he was engaged in
carrying on the roads between Broad-
sound and Copperfield. On his
advent to the country of his adopt-
ion he became associated with the
late Philip Hayes Talbot, whose
daughter, Sarah Anne, he married
in 1862, the year which witnessed
the arrival in Australia of both Mr.
Ussher and Mr. Talbot. Throughout
her long married life, Mrs. Ussher
fulfilled the best ideals of wifehood
and motherhood, lightening, by her

stock routes of Central Queensland,
until he settled down to station life
as a stockman at “Tierawoomba”
Station, near Mackay, which at that
death occurred in February, 1891,
closing a life whose value to the
country is best demonstrated in the
fact that he made good in the face
of the many adversities in the days
of early settlement. The late H.

setbacks in the course of his pioneer-

In the year 1907 he purchased a
small grazing farm adjoining “Fort
Cooper” Station, and here began
pastoral operations in earnest. He
purchased, five years later, a share
in “Lake Elphinstone” Station, the
old and historic property which he
has since controlled as managing
partner. Here the practical respon-
sibility of administration devolves
upon him, and at many a critical
period due to droughts and other
adverse visitations with which the
pastoralist has to contend his long
experience of the industry has stood
him in good stead. When he took
over the control of “Lake Elphin-
stone” the run was chiefly used as
a breeding proposition, but under
country. In the early days it was
owned in turn by Mr. Hess and Mr.
Ewan (both now deceased), and sub-
sequently, in the opening eighties,
it came into the possession of Messrs.
Ilyne and Bridgman, passing from
that firm to Messrs. Cook, Michel-
more, & Co., Mr. Ussher’s partners.
The run is well developed in every
particular, the yards being solidly
constructed according to an up-to-
date system and the supplemental
water supply ample, the several
wells which have been sunk having
attached to them Fuller-Johnston
engines and windmills. A fine
volume of natural water is provided
by Lake Elphinstone—from which
the property takes its name—and
standing on a bank of the lake which
is the haunt of swans, wild duck, and
other water birds, it commands a
delightful view of water and moun-
tain scenery. In local movements
of general interest Mr. Ussher has
taken due part, and for a consider-
able time was a councillor of the
Nebo Shire. He was gazetted a
Justice of the Peace in the year 1907
by the Liberal Administration then
in power. Sport has for him the
interests that it always has for the
horse lover—an interest which in his
case displayed itself with the fre-
quent entry of a good mount in
amateur events. He is a member of
the Mackay Turf and the Mackay
Amateur Race Clubs. In the year
his regime it has been turned into a
fattening property, and in this con-
nection has achieved for the
place an enviable reputation. Mr.
Ussher breeds a very good type
of station mount, but has been even
more successful with his draughts,
which, generally commanding top
market prices in the district, have
made quite a name for “Lake
Elphinstone” as a breeding centre
for this class of stock. One hundred
and fifty square miles are embraced
within the boundaries of the pro-
perty, which, when settlement was
young and before the Government
had begun its system of resumption,
covered a far greater extent of

which, having a circumference of
about ten miles, is formed from the

twice dry in the history of the dis-
trict. Part of the “Lake Elphin-
stone” homestead is the original
dwelling erected when the property
was newly converted from virgin
country. Various alterations and
additions have since been made, so
that, though following no particular
style of architecture, it is as comfort-
able and roomy as those old semi-
detached pastoral homes generally
are. Its advantages in regard to
the picturesqueness of its site are
unsurpassed in Queensland, for,

fifth daughter of the late Francis
Brown, a pioneer of this district,
who, of English birth and hailing
from Uxbridge, near London, in the
fifties, settled in Gayndah, where he
was engaged in commercial pursuits
for some years, eventually, in 1866,
removing to Nebo, Central Queens-
land, where he spent forty years.
He was the owner of “Iffley”
Station, now managed by Mr. A.
W. R. Brown on account of the
late gentleman’s estate. His death
occurred in the year 1910, in Bris-
bane. Mr. and Mrs. Ussher have two
daughters, Constance Howard and
Fay Howard.

from an old friend of the Maclean
family, the late Charles Mackinnon,
who, after a j)eriod of residence in
the Island Continent, was at that
time revisiting his native land. Mr.
Mackinnon’s description of the
country, its conditions and the
possibilities open to a young man
willing and able to work, stimulated
a previously formed desire of seeing
something of the world, with the
result that, when still in his seven-
teenth year, he became a passenger
for Australia by the sailing ship
“Ben Cruachan.” He landed in
Melbourne in the year 1873 and
shortly afterwards secured an engage-

Argus, so as to tide over such time
as might elapse before he realized

ment of the late Robert Molesworth,
who at that period was regarded as
one of the most practical men in the

Molesworth he rapidly acquired first-

woolly stock, and, showing both
aptitude, energy, and keen interest
in his work, was installed as its

FREDERICK YOUNG FOX,
J.P., late of “Bombandy” Station,
near Clermont, was born on April 13,
1856, at “Jerrara,” Bungonia, a
pastoral property then owned by his
LIEUT.-COL. I. FOX.
father, the late Isaac Fox, in the
district outlying Goulburn, N.S.W.
Isaac Fox, who was of English
descent, was a son of Lieutenant-
Colonel Isaac Fox, who owned in
Jamaica a coffee plantation called
“Mt. Cressy” until the opening years
of the nineteenth century, when the
slave trade was abolished in the
British Empire. At about that time
Lieutenant-Colonel Fox took his wife
to Liverpool, England, where, on
February 14, 1810, his son, Isaac,
was born. After a brief stay in Eng-
land, he set out once more for
Jamaica with the object of settling
his affairs there and arranging for
the transport of his possessions to the
Motherland. He was not destined to
see his wife and child again, however,
as he was lost at sea. The gentleman
under review can trace his descent
in a direct line from the time of
Charles 11., to whose cause the
members of this family were loyal
adherents and to whom they were
able to render signal service at
Boscovel, where the King escaped
from his enemies by taking refuge in
an oak tree. The circumstance is
commemorated in their crest, which
is an oak tree with the motto,
“Video et taceo.” Isaac Fox, the
West Indian planter, married on
August 2, 1806, Mary Eliza,
daughter of David Young (born
1763), a member of a notable English
family and a younger brother of
Rear-Admiral William Young, who
is recorded in history as flag captain
of the “Foudroyant” under Admiral
Lord Keith in the expedition sent to
Egypt in the early part of the last
century, and in whose cabin Sir
Ralph Abercromby died, after having
won undying fame in the battle
against the French in Alexandria in
1801. The first member of the Young
family of whom we have records was
Sir John Young, who had the grant
of Leny in the Trossachs and filled
the office of Lord Chamberlain to
Mary, Queen of Scots. For the last
fifty years of the nineteenth and the
early years of the twentieth century,
the name was prominently borne by
Sir Frederick Young, a grandson of
Rear-Admiral William Young. Sir
Frederick Young, who was created a
MR. I. FOX.
K.C.M.G. in 1888, was one of the
founders of the Royal Colonial Insti-
tute nearly fifty years ago, and for
long on© of its most prominent and
active members, retaining the vice-
presidentship of the body as late as
1912, when well in his nineties. His
activities were responsible for the
immigration to New Zealand of a
large number of settlers, and were in
various ways directed for the better-
ment of conditions for the people,
both in England and her Colonies.
He was also keenly interested in
Imperial Federation and was the
author of many books dealing with
this subject and immigration. Many
members of the Young family, in-
cluding Admiral Young, are buried
in the Catacombs beneath the church
at Norwood, and their coat of arms
is carved on the cloister wall of the
church. Isaac Fox, the founder of
the Fox family in Australia, being
left fatherless when an infant, was
placed under the guardianship of his
great-uncle, Admiral Young, through
whose influence he was placed, on
reaching manhood, in the East India
Company’s service. When the East
India Company was dissolved he was
appointed to the command of the
vessel on which Lord Henry Somer-
set (afterwards Lord Raglan) voyaged
to South Africa for the purpose of
establishing a British Colony there.
After his return to England, where
he married Mary Bridget, daughter
of William Richardson, of Croydon,
he was placed in command of a
convict ship destined for Tasmania.
He arrived in Australian waters in
due course, and, realizing the poten-
tialities of the great and then little
known Continent, started on the
return journey to the Motherland
with the object, merely, of making
the preliminary arrangements and
accompanying his young wife and
infant son (the late George Fox,
afterwards owner of “Croydon”
Station, Central Queensland, and a
member of the Queensland Legisla-
tive Assembly) to the land in which
he had decided to make for them a
home. The family first settled (about
MR. F. Y. FOX.
1840) at Binda, on the Fish River,
New South Wales, where the late
gentleman purchased a sheep farm.
After the death of the first Mrs. Fox,
which occurred at Parramatta, he


removed to “Jerrara,” Bungonia,
New South Wales, where he engaged
in farming and grazing pursuits. He
was twice married, on the second
occasion to Sarah, daughter of
MR. N. L. FOX.
Benjamin Carter, of Bolanglo, New
South Wales, who, hailing from
Nottinghamshire, arrived in Aus-
tralia with his family in the year
1832. Mr. F. Young Fox, who has
had so lengthy a pastoral career in
Queensland, was the second son of
this union and was named after Mr.
Frederick Young, a son of Admiral
Young and the father of Sir
Frederick Young. Mr. Isaac Fox’s
daughters, Ann, Fanny, and Alice
Maud, married John Alexander
Badgery, of “Ivy” Hall, Sutton
Forest, William Wentworth Buck-
nell, of “Quambone” Station, and
Stuart Wilmore Manning, of Nelli-
gan, respectively —all well-known
names in the early history of Aus-
tralia. Mr. F. Y. Fox was educated
at a Private School conducted by the
Rev. Mr. Welby at Goulburn. In
the year 1876, being then at the age
of twenty, he, accompanied by his
late brother, Thomas, journeyed with
stock to Central Queensland, where he
purchased the now historical pastoral
property known, as “Bombandy” from
Mr. John Shannon, a well-known
pioneer of that district. On this
property, then quite undeveloped,
he immediately settled, stocking
the run and inaugurating various
improvements. He resided on “Bom-
bandy” for forty years, becoming
one of the most representative
men in the industry in Central
Queensland. He was one of the
m'iginal councillors of the Shire and
prominently participated in every
movement instituted for the general
progress of this part of the State.
His hearty support was a live factor
in advancing the interests of amateur
racing here, and the hospitality of
Mr. and Mrs. Fox at “Bombandy”
was a byword, the homestead being
on the high road from the Copper
Mines of the Peak Downs district to
the Coast. For over a quarter of a
century he has exercised the duties
of a Justice of the Peace. His
reminiscences of the country in the
early days are most interesting, par-
ticularly in regard to the evolution
of the blacks from pure savagery to a
partly civilized state. He states that
MR. S. C. FOX.
it was no uncommon thing to find,
on bank of river or creek, some old
battle ground strewn with the bones
and skulls of the warriors who had
fallen in tribal fights. Mr. Fox sold
“Bombandy” in the year 1913 and
retired from the industry, taking up
his residence in Brisbane. His mar-
riage occurred in the year 1884 to
Margaret Isabel, daughter of the
late William Craig, who, during his
lifetime, practised as an architect in
New Zealand; and of the union there
was a family of three sons and one
daughter. The eldest son, Sydney
Craig Fox, was born in Mossvale,
New South Wales, on May 26, 1885,
and educated at King’s School,
Parramatta. From there he returned
to “Bombandy,” where he was
engaged in assisting his father until
1912, when he took up “Carfax”
Station, where this old family is still
represented by Messrs. Sydney C.
Fox and F. Y. Fox, jun. Mr. S. C.
Fox married in the year 1919, Hazel,
only daughter of Mr. F. J. C. Brown,
the present owner of “Bombandy,”
there being a daughter of the union.
Mr. Frederick Young Fox, jun., was
born in Rockhampton, Central
Queensland, and educated at the
Rockhampton Grammar School, on
the conclusion of his studies at the
age of seventeen returning to the
“Bombandy” home. Like his elder
brother, he received his training in
the pastoral industry there, and
moved to “Carfax” when that pro-
perty was taken up by Mr. Sydney
C. Fox, all three of the pioneer’s sons
being engaged on this holding until
the outbreak of the Great War in
1914. At the very beginning of
hostilities the two younger joined
the Australian Imperial Forces as
privates of the 9th Battalion and
members of the first Force despatched
to the Egyptian Front. Mr. F. Y.
Fox served through the Gallipoli
campaign, at the close of which he
was sent to France, where, in 1916,
he participated in the fighting on the
Somme and in various other engage-
ments in the north of France, being
wounded on April 25, 1917, during
CAPT. F. Y. FOX.
the counter attack on the German
forces at Villers Bretonneux, nearly
three years after his baptism of fire
at Gallipoli. He was invalided to
England and, in August, 1917, after


three months in hospital there, re-
joined his unit at the Western Front,
where he continued on active service
until the signing of the Armistice in
November, 1918. He won his com-
mission on the field and retired fi’om
the army with the rank of Captain,
and, on being demobilized, resumed
his connection with pastoral affairs
at “Carfax.” His elder brother,
Norman Lambert, of whom his
country claimed the supreme sacri-
fice, also served through the opera-
tions at Gallipoli, being subsequently
accidentally killed while instructing
troops with grenades in Egypt. Mr.
F. Y. Fox, of “Carfax,” married, on
his return from England, Portia, only
daughter of the late Harry Wheeler,
of “Cooroora” Station, Duaringa,
Central Queensland. Mrs. Fox’s
mother, Mrs. Wheeler, was decorated
with the 0.8. E. in recognition of her
services to the Australian soldiers in
England while the Great War was
in progress. Shortly before its out-
break she set sail for the Motherland
with the object of placing her
daughter at an English school, and
was in England when hostilities
were declared against Germany.
Immediately perceiving how great a
field there was for active patriotism,
she began to work in the interests of
the Central Queenslanders who had
become casualties in the course of the
struggle and the relatives of those
who had fallen. From her head-
quarters in London she thus relieved
much distress, being generous in the
disposal of her own capital and dis-
tributing to the best advantage the
funds sent by her compatriots of
Central Queensland. Mr. F. Y. Fox,
jun., has one son, Norman, whom he
named after the brother who gave his
life for his country in Egypt. The
only daughter of Mr. Fred Young
Fox, sen.,married Dr. S. A. Richards,
who is prominent in dental practice
in Brisbane, and a son of Dr. S. J.
Richards, who died on active service
with the A.I.F. in Gallipoli. Dr. S.
J. Richards was a well-known
medical man of Mount Morgan for
about twenty years, and his son, Dr.
R. M. Richards, who also saw active
service abroad, is engaged in the
practice of medicine in Sydney.

gentleman having sailed from Corn-
wall some five years previously and
set foot on Australian soil in 1852,
settling in the Ovens district,
Victoria. He was a pioneer of the
Ovens and other goldfields, his whole
career having been devoted to
mining pursuits, with which he was
occupied until his death which
occurred in the year 1862. Four sons
—John, Samuel, William, and
Thomas —survived him, the eldest
and youngest of whom have since
joined the Great Majority, Samuel
and William being blessed with both
health and prosperity in the autumn
of their days. The elder, Mr. Samuel
Coade, lives in semi-retirement at
“Baarmutha,” and affords his
assistance in the administration of
that property, though approach-
ing his eightieth year, while his
brother William is the head of the
firm of Messrs. W. Coade & Sons as
already stated. On their arrival in
Australia in the early fifties the
three elder sons of the old pioneer
became engaged in mining avocations
owning a claim on a very early
alluvial field named Spring Creek,
which they worked for two years.
Subsequently relinquishing the quest
for gold and its doubtful possibilities
for more prosaic and less unstable
pursuits, Samuel became engaged in
a store at Eldorado, and William
obtained contracts for supplying the
timber needed for mining operations
on various fields. In the early
seventies the latter journeyed to the
Mother State, where he entered upon
a career as a tank-sinking contractor,
starting in a small way with merely
a horse and dray. Accompanied by
his wife, who shared the hardships of
his life, mitigating its trials by
womanly sympathy and practical
support and softening its conditions
by housewifely duties cheerfully
performed, he worked over different
parts of the Riverina district for
nearly ten years, gradually enlarging
the sphere of his operations and
adding to his plant so as to render
it up to date, being one of the first
to employ the McCaughey scoop. In
the year 1883 he started on an
overland journey from the Riverina,
New South Wales, to Central Queens-
land, securing in the meantime a
large contract for the excavation of
over 200,000 cubic yards on “Well-
shot,” an important station situated
in the Mitchell district. Having
completed that work he carried out
other contracts of a similar nature
and was personally engaged in tank-
sinking operations until 1891, in
which year he selected “Baarmutha,”

been well known in commercial
circles of the Western towns for


nearly half a century. Of the union
there is a family of two sons and
two daughters. The late Francis P.
Coade was connected with the well-
known establishment of Walter Reid
& Co., Rockhampton, for a consider-
able time, relinquishing his position
with the firm in order to join his
father and brother on the land,
assisting in the administration of
"Baarmutha” for the following three
years. At the end of that time,
however, being unable to resist the
urgent call of the Empire for men to
assist in the great world struggle,
then in its second year (1915), he
placed the possibilities of a prosper-
ous future in the background and
readily offered his services in the
hour of his country’s need, cheer-
fully sacrificing his life on the altar
of duty. He was called upon to
make the Supreme Sacrifice, the first
report to reach his parents in con-
nection with their bereavement being
that their son was wounded and
missing, this intimation being fol-
lowed by a subsequent message to
the effect that he had joined that
glorious company of Australia’s sons
who, though destined never to
revisit their native shores, will live
in her memory for ever.

tributes to their own and their
country’s honour, even from that
almost obscure era of time when such
tradition supplied the place of later
authentic history. During the
earlier years of the subject of this
notice the late Mr. T. MacKenzie
continued to reside at Rosehearty,

the vicinity of his home, concluding
his scholastic career when at the age
of fourteen in order to assist in the
tilling of the soil and other duties
connected with the agrarian pursuits
of his parent. lie remained thus
employed for about two years when,
actuated no doubt by the same spirit
of enterprise which had prompted
some of his progenitors to leave
their native heath and make their
homes in the North of Ireland and
other portions of the Globe, he
decided that he also would do his
best to carve a successful career
abroad such as the limited possibili-
ties of the Old World denied him.
Choosing the land of the Southern
Cross as the scene of his future
activities he embarked from Ports-
mouth in a ship called the “Scottish
Lassie,” arriving at Maryborough,
Queensland, after a voyage of four
months’ duration in October, 1889,
and, though still well under 17 years
of age, fully resolved that honest
effort, industry, and perseverance
would not be lacking in his endeav-
our to win the goal of success upon
which his mind and heart were bent.
Shortly after landing he obtained
work in a sawmilling proposition,
receiving as remuneration for
arduous work during long hours the
sum of twelve shillings weekly. This
excessively low wage, however,
failed to discourage the resolutions
which he had formed, though point-
ing to actualities very different to

followed mining avocations at that
centre for about a year, deciding at
the end of that time to equip him-
self with a knowledge of bush work,
more particularly in that branch
which dealt with the important
matter of water development. With
this end in view he accepted a post
vicinity of Isisford. Under the
experienced and capable management
of the worthy old pioneer the young
man soon acquired such knowledge
as was essential for the successful
and independent prosecution of the
tank-sinking business, to which end
he continued to carefully husband
his resources. After about three
years he was in a position to pur-
chase the necessary plant to set up
as a contractor on his own account,
but unfortunately his new venture
plant and the few animals which he
had succeeded in saving. This mis-
fortune happened shortly after the
attainment of his twenty-first year,
and though sorely felt, it but
strengthened his determination to
succeed in spite of odds. The spirit of
his fore-fathers coming to his aid he
once more set out as a wage earner,
becoming engaged in general bush
work, the major portion of the three
years during which he was so
occupied being spent in the capacity
of manager of a tank-sinking plant.
By steady industry and thrift he was
soon enabled to put aside the savings
which were destined to again pave
the way to independence, and indeed
his efforts in this direction were
applied to such purpose that at the
termination of the above-mentioned
period he had accumulated sufficient
capital to buy a small plant with
which to pursue the trade of a
carrier. For several subsequent
years he followed this avocation,
confining his operations to Longreach
and the outlying district in the pur-
suance of his work, enlarging the
useful experience already gained of
the natural conditions of the country.
Fortune still smiling on his industry
he continued in the carrying trade
until the year 1906, having in the
meantime entered the married state
and, as a sequence started grazing
operations on a block of land which
at that time was owned by his wife,
and which has since developed into
“Rosebank.” Concluding from his
own observation that the land is he
basis of more general prosperity he
retired from trade as already stated
in the year 1906, and in partnership
with Mr. A. F. Smith took up a

flood of 1893. The result spelt
disaster for the young Scotchman,
who was obliged to sell his outfit,
which after the flood included his
selection situated on the Thomson
River, twenty-four miles from Long-
reach. This property, which em-
braces an area of 17,000 acres of
country, was named “landra,” and

immediately set to work upon its
development, devoting his whole
attention to the new venture. He

once more turned his attention to
his earlier home at “Rosebank,”
where his capable administration
was soon in evidence. In the space
of a short time the extent of its
area was considerably augmented,
the purchase of several surrounding
properties being effected, so that it
is now considered one of the repre-
sentative places in the vicinity of
Longreach, from which it is situated

besides the two already alluded to
are “Arranmore” and “Baratria,”
two well-known estates. The latter
station is situated about half-way
between Longreach and Winton, and
embraces 100,000 acres of country.
Woolgrowing is the main industry
conducted on the four properties,
although the firm breeds a large
number of horses suitable for station
and other purposes. Cattle are bred
in sufficient numbers to provide for
methods errqiloyed in regard to
development of both land and stock
being evidenced in the high prices
obtained for the clips from the
various estates. Between 60,000 and
70,000 sheep are shorn annually by
the firm. Mr. MacKenzie married
in December, 1901, Rose Ann, eldest
daughter of Mr. Thomas Spence,
“Rosedale,” who is referred to in
another portion of this work. Mrs.

support which has been so largely


responsible for bis ultimate success.
Her advice lias been invaluable to
bim in that it was always carefully
weighed, and her sympathy and
encouragement have been unfailing,
both in times of stress and happiness.
Of the union there is a family of one
son and three daughters.
The late EDWARD DEMPSEY,
of “Wallbury” Station, near Dua-
ringa, was born at Templemore,
Tipperary, Ireland, being a son of
the late James Dempsey who fol-
lowed agrarian pursuits in that part
of the Emerald Isle. Mr. James
Dempsey came with his family to
Australia by the sailing vessel
“Beejapore,” in 1863, and, landing
at Rockhampton in June of that
year, he selected a building site on
the range, in near vicinity to the
spot now occupied by the Mater
Hospital. After the pioneers had
settled in their new home, they
turned their attention to the ac-
quirement of land in the district,
and, about 1867, took up “Meteor
Park,” a property of 1,000 acres,
which they used for farming pur-
poses. Subsequently this property
was sold to the founder of an
orphanage at Mackay, who moved
to a more southerly locality,
and the “Meteor Park Orphan-
age,” now a well-known institution,
was established on the area. The
Dempseys were widely recognised for
their enterprising spirit, and, among
other ventures, they placed teams
on the roads, for which they em-
ployed drivers, and made for them-
selves a large connection throughout
Central Queensland. In 1875, the
late Edward Dempsey, in conjunc-
tion with his father and brothers,
took up the country to which they
gave the name of “Sorrel Hill,” an
area of about 250 square miles,
watered by the Mackenzie River and
the Ten-Mile and Sixteen-Mile
Creeks, both tributaries of that
stream. This they stocked with cattle,
building up a herd of some four to
five thousand, and doing exceedingly
well by the venture until 1902, when
the drought reduced their stock by
about fifty per cent. In the last-
named year, portions of the run
were resumed by the Government of
the day, and thrown open for selec-
tion, and Mr. Edward Dempsey
availed himself of the opportunity to
secure a holding in his own right,
to which he gave the name of “Wall-
bury.” This comprised some 40,000
acres of the pick of the run, with
three miles of frontage to the Mac-
kenzie River, and plenty of localities
suitable for well-sinking, and here
he settled down to the active admini-
stration of his private interests. In

addition, he owned 4,000 acres of
land, representing a portion of a
property taken up by him in 1888,
comprising 14,000 acres and known
as “Woodvale”—a well-watered
stretch of country, served by tribu-
taries of the Dawson River. This
he had fenced and partially improv-
ed, but, preferring the Mackenzie
holding, decided to dispose of
10,000 acres, retaining the home-
stead and the more important im-
provements. The “Wallbury” Es-
tate is characterised by undulating
ridges and fertile river flats, the
tableland country, which in its
natural state is thickly timbered,
having been partly cleared, and pro-
ducing a prolific growth of natural
grasses. A number of wells have
been sunk, and among the other
improvement work is the subdivision
of the property into four large
blocks. Mr. Dempsey favoured the
Hereford breed of cattle, and
brought his herd to an advanced de-
gree of perfection. The drought of
1902 wrought much havoc among the
stock, but breeding up was immedi-
ately resumed, and, at the time of
time of his decease “Wallbury”
was carrying some 2,000 to 2,500
head of cattle. Mr. Dempsey was
public-spirited in a marked degree,
and for many years occupied a seat
on the old Divisional Board of Dua-
ringa, of which he was chairman for
a lengthy period. He exercised the
Commission of the Peace with more
than ordinary responsibility, being
the only official of his rank in the
town of Duaringa, where he adjudi-
cated on all petty cases and, in con-
junction with the visiting police
magistrate, in matters of serious im-
portance. He was a well-known
sportsman, horse-racing being his
special hobby, and he always placed
his colours on the course in the true
racing spirit, "the best horse to
win.” He also was keenly interested
in athletics, and gave personal and
financial encouragement to all forms
of manly sport. In 1890 Mr. Demp-
sey married Louisa, daughter of Mr.
Robert Joseph D'Arcy, of North
Rockhampton—a gentleman engaged
originally in land ventures, but who,
on account of setbacks through
drought, went into the carrying
trade, his teams becoming well
known all over the Central district,

where they proved of much assist-

MAXWELL BROS., “Moondah
Park,” Longreach. The Australian
branch of the Maxwell family was
founded by the grandfather of the
above-mentioned gentlemen, the late
Dr. Edwin Stanford Maxwell, who
was a medical officer in the British
Navy, on his retirement from which
he practised his profession for a time
at Londonderry, Ireland. Some
time previous to his departure for
Australia he had joined the ranks of
the benedicts, and his young wife
and one child then born to him (a
daughter) accompanied him to the
land of the Southern Cross, a son
being born on the voyage out. A
landing was effected in the late
forties at the Port of Melbourne,
this now populous city being
then in its infancy. Dr. Max-
well established himself in practice
in Collins Street, his first resi-
dence consisting of a tent, and
here also were his consulting-rooms.
In the year 1849 he removed to

Golden Square, near Bendigo, and
it was due to his suggestion that the
latter centre first became known as
Sandhurst, in compliment to the
military college to which he had
been attached ere joining the Navy.
At a later date Golden Square was
included within the boundaries of
Bendigo, one of the finest provincial
cities of the Victorian State, and

here he continued in the practice of
his profession until the time of his
decease in 1865. His eldest son who
was also named Edwin Stanford was
but six weeks of age when the family
arrived in Victoria. On the conclu-
sion of his education, which was
received at Bendigo, he followed the
profession of a surveyor in Victoria
for some time, subsequently relin-
quishing that calling in order to
engage in landed pursuits. Proceed-
ing to Kerang, a town situated
within a few miles of the Murray
River, he selected "Stanford
Park," one of the smaller station
properties in Victoria, and engaged
in the breeding of sheep, cattle, and
horses. “Stanford Park” has since
been cut up for closer settlement.
The late Mr. E. S. Maxwell was also
connected with the Victorian Press
for some years. He joined the Great
Majority in the year 1897, having
left a name well worthy of historic
record, recalling, as it does, the close
association of both the late gentle-
man and his pioneer father with the
early romantic days of the Victorian
State. At the time of the decease of
their parent the two surviving sons,
who are the subject of this memoir,
were still in their boyhood. Shortly
afterwards Mrs. Maxwell decided to
take up her residence in Melbourne,
and it was here that the Maxwell Bros.
(Edwin S. and Henry C. K.) first
became interested in farm properties.
The elder brother, Edwin Stanford
Maxwell, was born at "Stanford
Park" on September 14,1885, and on
the conclusion of his scholastic career
at the Malvern Grammar School
became a jackaroo on “Dalcross”
Station, in the Wimmera district,
where he became conversant with
pastoral enterprise in its various
phases. He remained at "Dalcross”
until 1909, when having decided to
strike out for himself, he came to
Queensland, accompanied by his
younger brother, Mr. H. C. K.
Maxwell, with the intention of look-
ing for a suitable grazing property
for breeding sheep and growing wool,
and being considerably impressed
with the possibilities of acheiving
speedy success in this field of in-
dustry, he returned with his brother
to Victoria with the object of
impressing upon their mother’s mind
the desirability of securing a suitable
sheep-run in the Northern State.
Being satisfied with the result of her
sons’ observations, Mrs. Maxwell
joined forces with them in the
purchase of “Moondah Park” in the
year 1909, the firm of Maxwell Bros,
thus being founded. The property
consisted of about 20,000 acres at
the time of its acquirement by the
present owners, but was subsequently
enlarged by the purchase of an
adjoining 20,000 acre block from
MR. E. MAXWELL.
Mr. E. Jowett, M.H.R. The com-
bined acreage originally formed part
of the resumption of “Ruthven”
Station, and the block first pur-
chased by the firm was previously


owned by a member of the Arm-
strong family, who were well known
pioneers of Western Queensland.
As a result of the progressive system
of development inaugurated under

a family of two sons and one
daughter. The younger partner,
Mr. H. C. K. Maxwell, was born at
"Stanford Park,” Kerang, on Sep-
tember 29, 1890. He received his
education at Kerang College and
the Malvern Grammar School, con-
cluding his course at that Academy
in order to enter the Dookie
Agricultural College with the view
of obtaining an insight into the
theoretical and practical side of
pastoral life. On the termination
of his studies at Dookie he came to
Western Queensland with his elder
brother in 1909, the visit resulting
in the purchase of "Moondah Park”
in the same year, as already related.
He assisted in the administration of
that estate until the year 1917, when
he decided to offer his services in
defence of the Empire’s rights and
for the- sacred cause of liberty.
Motoring overland to Melbourne he
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces there, being attached to the
sth squadron, Australian Flying
Corps. He left Australia for
England in July, 1917, and was on
active service in France and Belgium.
During his residence in the Long-
reach district he has earned a
character similar to that borne by
his brother, both being known as
useful and progressive citizens,
always ready to take their part in
any matter instituted for the general
good. He is a keen participant in

WILLIAM HENRY PIN-
COMBE, “Capella Downs,” Capella,
was born at Orange, New South
Wales, on April 26, 1854, and is
the son of the late William Pin-
combe, who, in 1853, shortly after
his marriage, hailed from Devon-
shire, England, and became one of
the first residents of Orange, New
South Wales, and in course of time
a well-known grazier of the outlying
district. It is recorded of William
Pincombe that he was a member of
the first jury empanelled in Orange,
with which centre he was identified
until the late seventies, when he
accompanied members of his family
to Queensland. He died in Too-
woomba in 1901, after having lived
several years in partial retirement
there. His family consisted of five
children, all of whom were born in
Australia, the owner of “Capella
Downs” being its only surviving
member. Mr. W. H. Pincombe pur-
sued his education during intervals
when his assistance was not required
in the carrying out of his father’s
grazing operations at a Private
School, which he left when at the age
of eighteen. He continued to devote
himself to his father’s interests until
his arrival at man’s estate, when he
decided to make an independent
start in life, and with this objective
journeyed to Queensland and secured
a post as overseer under the late
Hon. James Tyson at “Felton.”
From “Felton” he was subsequently
transferred to the overseership of
“Tinnenburra,” where he continued
for three years, adding largely to
his already comprehensive knowledge

industry and returned to the calling
which he had temporarily forsaken

overseer at “Silsoe” Station, near
Longreach, of which he was subse-
quently made manager. Most of
the developmental work now in evi-
dence on this historical old station
was inaugurated and completed dur-
ing his term of administration, which
covered a period of twelve years.
In 1896, when “Silsoe” was sold, he
purchased, in conjunction with Mr.
Victor Buckland, the grazing block
in the Winton district known as
“Corolla,” which he personally
named “Eureka.” In 1909 Mr.
Pincombe took up “Withywine” in
conjunction with Mr. George Bond,
a property situated in the same dis-
trict. He disposed of “Corella,”
“Eureka,” and “Withywine” at
different periods, “Eureka” having
passed by purchase to Mr. Avery, of
“Alroy,” and “Withywine” to Mr.
Telford. After thirty-eight years’
association with the pastoral in-
dustry in the Longreach district,
where his readiness to lend a helping
hand, his uprightness, and his in-
dustry gained the sincere respect of
his fellow-citizens and the friendship
of a wide circle of friends, he made
use of his freedom from pressing
business interests by taking an ex-
tended holiday. At the end of
twelve months, however, missing the
activity to which he had been accus-
tomed during his whole career, he
decided to again invest in grazing
interests, and in 1915 purchased
“Capella Downs,” in the conduct of
which he finds sufficient scope for a
temperament essentially active. With
his wife he spends occasional months
at Rockhampton, where he has a
town residence. “Capella Downs”
comprises about 20,000 acres of
country which is devoted to a small
herd of cattle. A public-spirited
man, Mr. Pincombe has always in-
terested himself in communal and
other affairs of general interest. He
was a former president of the local
branch of the Primary Producers’
Union, and is at present a member
of the Peak Downs Shire Council.
In the year 1906 he married Mary
Anne, daughter of the late George
of the industry during this period.

been established in the brewing
trade in that locality for many
generations. The late gentleman
was prominently identified with that
business, and was also one of the
ruling spirits of the local public
institutions during his lifetime. His
son, Frederick William Banks,
received his earlier education
through private tuition under the
parental rooftree, spending the last
six years of his scholastic career in
the famous St. John’s College,
Hurstpierpoint, near Brighton, an
Academy which has produced many
men who have made history in
various parts of the Empire. It was
intended that he should adopt the
law as a profession, and with this
end in view he entered the pre-
liminary legal examination, in which
he was most successful. Owing to
a breakdown in his health, however,
he was unable to continue his law
course, and in consequence, acting
upon the advice of his doctors, he
proceeded to Australia. The voyage
was accomplished in the historic old
passenger sailing ship, “The Tor-
rens,” one of the Elder Smith line,
in which he embarked from Ply-
mouth on his eighteenth birthday,
the vessel taking 73 days to com-
plete the voyage from that town to
Adelaide without once touching
land. As his brother, Mr. Alfred
Banks, was already established in
Brisbane as an architect, Queensland
was naturally his objective, and he
landed in the above-mentioned town
in January, 1887. After spending
a few months with his brother he
accepted the offer of a post as
jackaroo on “Daandine” Station,
near Dalby, on the Darling Downs,
and proceeded to that estate, where
he received his first insight into the
pastoral industry. He remained on
“Daandine” for the following 18
months, and in the year 1888
became one of a droving party which
was engaged to take a flock of sheep
to “Uanda,” a station situated in
the Mitchell district, in the vicinity
of Torrens Creek. The few months
during which he was so occupied
gained for him his first experience of
the, road, after which he became
engaged as jackaroo on “North-
ampton Downs,” a well-known sheep
station near Blackall, remaining
there in that capacity for two years.
At the end of this period he was
offered and accepted the post of over-
seer at “Mount Morris,” in the
Warrego distrct, fulfilling his
duties in this connection until the
year 1891, when, in order to gain
a further and wider experience, he
accepted a position on “Barcaldine
Downs.” He arrived at the latter
station at the time of the memorable
shearers’ strike, when it was neces-
sary to carry firearms for self-
preservation. In the year 1893 he
was appointed as overseer at “Man-
eroo” Station, carrying out the

the outcome of the occasion. He
also took the oi:>portuiiity of visiting
many places of historic interest in
the Motherland during this visit.
Returning to “Maneroo,” he re-
mained there until the year 1899,
when he accepted the management
of “Fermoy” Station, a property
between Longreach and Winton,
successfully applied his knowledge of
the conditions of the country (gained
through many years of close observa-
tion), and succeeded in saving a
marked percentage of the stock,
despite the general devastation. In
coping with the adverse conditions
then prevailing he added to his
already wide experience, the methods
which then suggested themselves
tending largely to his subsequent
success during similar periods of
stress. At the latter end of the year

industry on his own account, he
Queensland were totally different
from those encountered out west, he
persevered with the working of this
estate until the year 1908, when he
sold out. In the following year he
selected and became part owner of
his present homestead block, which
was originally a portion of “Tocal,”
being acquired by the partners on
the resumption of some of the land
composing that estate. He named
the property “Kendal,” after his
birthplace in the Old Land, and in
1911, buying out the interests of his
partner, became sole proprietor. In
the same year he purchased the two
adjoining blocks, bringing the area
of the estate up to 58,000 acres,
which may be classed amongst the
finest pastoral land in the Common-
wealth. The country is amply
watered from natural sources, hav-
ing a double river frontage of
miles, with permanent water on both
sides, the Thompson providing here
a chain of deep holes which even
in the most severe droughts have
never been known to fail. Mr.
Banks has, nevertheless, spent con-
siderable sums in regard to water
conservation with the intention of
safeguarding the country from the
consequences of dry seasons. His
first essay in this direction proved
unfortunate, as several thousand
pounds were unsuccessfully spent in
sinking bores for sub-artesian sup-
plies. However, he directed his
next efforts to the excavation of
dams of large holding capacity, and
which he administered for the
following three years, encountering
the great drought of the period

being completed in this direction.
The homestead, which is situated 63
miles south of Longreach, on the
eastern bank of the Thomson River,
is a modern structure of comfortable

side vistas of rolling downs, broken
with occasional belts of shade timber,
and whichever way the eye turns it

conditions prevailing with regularity

shelter for the stock, both from the
intense heat of the long summer
months and the frosts and bleak

is devoted to sheep which have been

ewes. The standard of the flock,
which at time of writing num-

been kept up by the introduction of
good blood from time to time, chiefly
from the “Collaroy” stud. The
wool grown on “Kendal” commands
up to 24d. in the grease. A small
herd of milkers and a mob of about
80 horses are pastured on the run.

John’s Wood, London, on April 28,
1842, and is a scion of a well-known
old English family, being the eldest
son of the late Dr. T. H. Roberts,
whose father before him also was a
medical practitioner of London in
the latter part of the seventeenth
subsequently qualified for his degree
in medicine at Guy’s Hospital,
London. In 1861 he sailed for
Sydney with the intention of joining
his paternal uncle, Sir Alfred
Roberts, who will be remembered as
one of the founders of the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital in that city,
and who received knighthood in
recognition of his many successful
endeavours in the cause of suffering
humanity. Dr. Roberts returned to
England in the following year, two
years later again crossing the ocean
to the Island-continent, and landing
in New South Wales. A few months
later he revisited the homeland, but,
towards the end of 1865, finally
made up his mind to settle in
Australia, and coming to Queensland
established himself in the practice of
his profession at Toowoomba. Dr.
Roberts continued to practise until
the year 1908, when he entered upon
a well-earned and honourable retire-
ment at “Croxley,” where he has
rested from his labours, rich in the
affection and gratitude of a large
circle of friends, gentle and humble.
It is not too much to say that, while
resident at Toowoomba, he was the
best known and best loved of the
citizens of the Darling Downs, and
that his arduous labours freely given

College. In the early part of 1898
he concluded this valuable training
for his future career, and came to
settle on the “Croxley” Estate, which
had been purchased on his behalf by
his father a short time previously.
The property was formerly a portion
of the old “Westbrook” Estate, and
consisted of some twelve hundred
acres, but this area has since been
added to by further purchase from
time to time of surrounding blocks
of the same parent run, which had
passed into other hands at the time
of the sub-division of “Westbrook”
for closer settlement purposes. The
area of “Croxley” at the present
time comprises about 3,500 acres,

judgment on such matters, the
estate not only holds its own as one
of the “show” places of the Downs,
but there is even something unique
about it, arising from the fact of its
having been under the control of an
owner who has been able to introduce
the latest scientific methods into the
working of every department. To
facilitate the careful detail work
which the application of the property
to purposes of mixed farming has
made necessary, a number of small
paddocks have been fenced, which
are used for the grazing of fat
lambs, horses, and cattle respectively,
and for cropping, some 700 acres of
lucerne, besides from three to four
hundred acres of wheat, barley, and
oats being grown. The estate is

characteristic of the Downs, liberal
growths of timber are found on the
rising ground, which are altogether
absent from the plains. Gumtop,
box, and apple timber are distributed
fairly freely over the estate, which is
thus furnished with excellent shelter
for the stock during the heat of
summer. A flock of about 3,000
sheep is grazed, and Mr. Roberts has
also given some attention to the
breeding of horses, while dairying is
an important branch of the farm
operations. The original homestead
was erected in 1897, and is now
utilized as a dwelling-house by Dr.
Edwin Roberts, who, since his retire-
ment from medical practice in the
town, has altered and improved the
building, which is now an up-to-date

while the Doctor’s residence is both
picturesque and cosy, Mr. Cecil
Roberts’ home is one to command
attention from the most casual of

art treasures have been gathered,

Roberts has been deeply interested
in public affairs, and, a close student
of political economy, he naturally
found congenial spirits in those
whose studies ran along the same
of his advantages in this respect that
his name rapidly became one to
reckon with, not only on the Darling
Downs, but even throughout the
Island Continent. In his strong
advocacy of the principles of co-

methods of production, but also in
the matter of securing the most
advantageous legislation, and other
general conditions, the carrying on
of their important industry, whereby
the maximum amount of profit
should accrue to the primary
producer, Mr. Roberts became more
and more enthusiastic, and the result
of his efforts was the founding of the
“Darling Downs Farmers’ Union,”
in 1911, which, a year later,
developed into the “Queensland
Farmers’ Union,” now one of the
most successful trading organizations
in the Commonwealth, with a very
important political significance,
which already is making itself felt as
a factor of considerable weight. In

24,000 acres freehold and 16,000
leasehold, its area having been con-
siderably reduced by the selections
of smaller settlers from the original
acreage of about 150 square miles.
There are about 4,000 head of cattle
on the country, the former shorthorn
herd in recent years having given
place to Herefords, which have
proved well adapted to local condi-
tions. “Galloway Plains” was taken
up in 1864 by the late Hugh Neill,
a native of Wigtonshire, Scotland,
whose father, George Neill, farmed
his own holding in that County.
Born in 1834, Hugh Neill, after the
conclusion of his scholastic career,
which he received at an Academy in
Scotland, decided to come to Aus-
tralia, and arrived in Victoria in
1854. At that time the gold-diggings
were in full swing, and he proceeded
direct to Ballarat, where he did
fairly well as a digger. In 1860
he made his advent to Brisbane on
a quest for land for pastoral pur-
poses, and having inspected the
country on the Calliope River, tooK
up the holding to which he gave the
name of “Galloway Plains.” Re-
turning to the metropolis, he
arranged for the purchase of a few
hundred head of cattle, which he
overlanded from Brisbane to his
new run, a distance of 350 miles.
The season was wet and consider-
able delay was occasioned through
floods, three months expiring before
the herd arrived at its destination.
The country at that time was in its
natural state and thickly inhabited
by blacks, who were inclined to be
hostile, making it necessary for every
settler and his men to carry arms;
but this drawback was counter-
balanced by the fine promise of the
property, with its magnificent downs
rolling up to the eastern slopes of
Dawes Range. It was heavily tim-
bered with ironbark and bloodwood,
and a good water supply, provided
by Oakey Creek and other streams,
rendered the locality highly suitable
for stock-grazing purposes. Mr. Neill
took the work of improvement
vigourously in hand and by degrees
the property was fenced and sub-
divided, after which the construc-
tion of large dams for the ensuing
of a permanent water supply re-
ceived attention. The holder was
successful in establishing the run as
a revenue-producing proposition be-
fore 1870, in which year he went for
a trip to the Old Country, during
his absence meeting the lady who
afterwards became his wife. Return-
ing to Australia during the same
year, he continued the development
of his property, and was also instru-
mental in forming a road over the
range to Gladstone. In 1874 he paid
another visit to Scotland, and in
April, 1875, immediately after his
marriage he once more sailed for
the land of his adoption. Settling
down with his wife at “Galloway
Plains,” he there pursued a success-
ful career as a pastoralist for a
number of years, during his tenure
converting some 20,000 acres into
freehold. In 1886 Mr. Neill made
an arrangement with the Lake’s
Creek Freezing Works to take all
the fats as they became ready for
sale, and this arrangement continued
until 1888, when with his wife and
daughter he went on a 12 months’
holiday trip to Scotland. Upon his
return in 1890 he took up a lease
called “Bolburram,” comprising
20,000 acres, and also acquired
“Boyan Island,” lying 15 miles off
the coast from Gladstone, which pro-
perty he utilized for the depasturage
of young cattle. Upon his death,
which occurred in 1894, Mr. Neill
left his property in the hands

immediate heirs, i.e., his widow and

afterwards at a Boarding School in
Scotland. In 1902 she married Dun-
can Ballantine, of Bairnsdale, Vic-
toria, and the young couple took up
their residence at “Summerlea,”
a grazing farm near “Galloway
Plains.” In 1902 the drought re-
duced the cattle on “Galloway
Plains” to a little over 1,400 head,
and three years later Mr. Ballan-

having been taken up separately by
the present owners, Messrs. Lamotte
and Dibbs, in the year 1910, and
consolidated as one proposition on
the formation of a partnership
between them in the following year.
It is situated 80 miles west of Long-
reach, and is composed of undulating
pebbly country, clothed chiefly with
Mitchell and Flinders grasses, and
bearing gidya, boree, whitewood,
and dead finish, portions of the run
carrying a heavy growth of these
timbers. The property is provided
with two sub-artesian bores, six
dams, and a well, being thus ren-
dered “safe” in the event of drought.
The improvements include some 100
miles of fencing, 70 miles of which
is six-wired, while rabbit-proof net-
ting has been used in similar con-
struction work for a length of
35 miles. The run is subdivided
into 13 paddocks. The homestead,
which was erected in 1918, con-
sists of two stories, and contains
all the modern appurtenances
which so materially add to the
comfort of station life. Sheep
have formed the mainstay of
the property for several years, but
the flocks have been latterly replaced
with shorthorn cattle, the breeding
of horned stock being still carried on
at “Mount Ryde,” awaiting the
completion of the dog-proof fence,
when sheep will again form the
mainstay. The present herd numbers
some 1,500 head, and a small flock
of “woollies” is also depastured, the
country being admirably adapted for
either sheep or cattle. Horses are
also bred on the property, over 80
head being carried at the present
time, and owning a reputation which
ensures a ready market for the
young stock. The two blood stallions
in use on “Mount Ryde” are
“Arolhurst,” by “Amhurst” (imp.),
from “Flora”; and “Paloma,” by
"Riding Master” (imp.), from
“Ruve,” both sires having been
imported from Sydney. The mares
also include highly-pedigreed ani-
mals, among them being “Sadava,”
by “Reunalf,” from “Huasca”;
“Parting Shot,” by “Blackpan,” out
of “Goodbye”; and “Lacot,” by
“Sir Tristam” (imp.), from “Bac-
carat.” LEONARD LEYCESTER
LAMOTTE was born at North
Sydney, New South Wales, and is a
son of the late Mr. Frederick Charles
Lamotte. He was engaged in station
management in Western Queensland
for a period covering twenty years,
twelve of which were occupied in
the administration of “Cluny”
Station, on the Georgina River, in
the vicinity of Birdsville, and eight
as manager of “Vergemont,” in the
district outlying Longreach. He

“BONUS DOWNS” and
“CYTHEREA” Stations, Mitchell,
the property of Messrs. Robinson
and Vincent (Matthew J. Robinson,
T. W. Vincent, and Guthrie Robin-
son). These stations, with which
are combined the old “Annie Vale”
and “Tullendunna” runs, together
with various other holdings—the
whole being consolidated under the
general title of “Bonus Downs”
rank among the oldest-established
properties of the Maranoa district.
There are, indeed, few pastoral
areas in Queensland which can boast
of an earlier date of selection.
“Bonus Downs” proper was first
taken up by the late Mr. R. Stat-
harn in the early sixties, but was
abandoned by that gentleman at the
time of the calamitous drought early
in the present century. Another of
holdings, was owned in the early
eighties by one John Holland, later
coming into possession of Mr. J. C.
McManus, who was succeeded in turn
by other proprietors; while" Sala-
mis,” now part of “Cytherea,” was
once an independent cattle run, held
by the Copley family nearly half a
century ago. “Salamis” was in the
hands of Mr. William Crouch when
the disastrous drought of 1902 com-
pelled its evacuation, and later it
was held successively by the Winten
family, and by the Whites, of Mus-
wellbrook, New South Wales, before
its purchase by the present owners,
Messrs. Robinson & Vincent. Origin-
ally the various properties were
devoted solely to cattle-raising, but
Sir Samuel McCaughey, perhaps the
best-known identity in the pastoral
industry in Australia, perceived the
sheep. Thereafter the cattle were
gradually replaced by sheep, and
prior to the big drought of 1915 the
pastures were carrying a flock of
80,000, in addition to some 5,000
to 6,000 cattle. After “Cytherea”
was purchased by Messrs. Robinson
and Vincent in 1914, and attached
to “Bonus Downs,” which latter
property they acquired from Sir
Samuel at an earlier date, it under-
went the necessary preparation for
the reception of sheep, rabbit- and
dog-proof netting being carried
round 50 miles of fencing, rendering
the area immune from these pests.
The venture proved highly suc-
cessful, and prior to the 1915
drought, which struck such a severe
blow at pastoral enterprise over
nearly the whole of Queensland,
130,000 sheep from the combined

was “Annie Vale/’ first occupied in
the seventies by the late Daniel
Coghlan & Sons, and sold by him to
Messrs. Webb Bros., of Orange,
New South Wales, who abandoned
the area owing to a succession of
droughty seasons in the early
eighties. Subsequently, “Annie
Vale” was owned by Messrs. Spen-
cer & Thompson, and retained 1 y
them until 1902, after which the
forfeited lease was taken up by Mr.
H. L. Kilroy, who restocked it and
started operations, eventually dis-
posing of the run to Sir Samuel

with a view to embracing wool- and
mutton-producing in his scheme of
operations. The consolidated pro-
perties, with the exclusion of
“Cytherea,” when acquired by Sir
Samuel, covered about 300,000 acres,
but since that period certain areas
have been resumed, and the “Bonus
Downs” acreage at the time of
writing is only about two-thirds of
its former size, the remainder hav-
ing been devoted to purposes of
closer settlement. During the
reyime of Sir Samuel McCaughey,
the run was protected with rabbit-
proof wire-netting all round the
boundary, and two-thirds of the
enclosed country was subdivided into
paddocks of suitable dimensions for
properties were put to shears in one
season. Both flocks and herds suf-
fered severe diminution in 1915-16,
and although restocking was begun
immediately after the breaking of
the drought, the pastures have not
yet regained their full complement
of either cattle or sheep. At the
time of writing about 40,000
sheep and 2,000 cattle represent the
full strength of the proposition, but
it is confidently anticipated that in
a comparatively short time these
numbers will be considerably aug-
mented, and the former era of
prosperity even surpassed, as with
advanced development the carrying
capacity of the properties will be
considerably enhanced. The sheep

generally consists of undulating

respect is ideal for the purpose to
which it has been applied by the
present holders. Much credit is due
to Messrs. Robinson & Vincent for
the energy and ability which they
have displayed in continuing Sir
Samuel McCaughey’s fine develop-
mental work, with the result that
what at one time was considered
little better than waste country
was recently valued by the officials
of the Lands Department at three
acres to a sheep—a very satisfactory
assessment. Sir Samuel gave much
attention to the matter of water
supply, and was responsible for the
sinking of six artesian bores on dif-
ferent parts of the run. Five addi-
tional bores have since been sunk,
three being sub-artesian, and from
these the water is distributed
through 100 miles of drains to the
localities where it is required, cer-
tain natural watercourses also having
been utilized to achieve this object.
A feature of the station is its
modern shearing-shed and wool
scour, which is situated some eight
miles from the homestead, and was
built during Sir Samuel McCaug-
hey’s term of ownership. This is one
of the largest sheds in the west,

Victoria, where he settled down to
farming pursuits. Acquiring land at
Coleraine, in the first instance, he
rapidly made a success of his indus-
try, and subsequently inaugurated
operations as a grazier on a fairly
extensive scale. Of the various
properties owned by the late Janies
Ferrier, in the sister State, several
are still in possession of some of his
descendants, four of his eight sons
at the time of writing being settled;
on the land in the Western District
of Victoria. One (Duncan), who
also was interested in the pastoral
industry died at Surat, in June,
1905; and another (Mr. Thomas
Ferrier), who died in November,
1918, was the owner of “Bellevue”
Station, near Roma. Mr. David
Ferrier was four years of age when
he first set foot in Australia, and,
like other sons of the early settlers,
he had to make shift for his educa-
tion, the facilities for instruction
being then of a meagre and inade-
quate character. He obtained some
schooling at Coleraine, but as soon
as he grew old enough to make him-
self useful on his father’s farm, his
services were requisitioned for this’
purpose, and, while still of tender
years, he gained an excellent work-
ing knowledge of many details of
the industry. As he increased in
years and bodily strength his duties
became more onerous, and, until his
thirtieth year, he continued to reside
under the parental roof-tree. During
this period he invented and patented
the wool-press known as the “Fer-
riers,” which has proved the most
satisfactory wool-press ever made.
He also invented an earth-scoop
which, having proved itself very
serviceable, was adopted by the
Canadian Military Forces and used
by them in making the sunken roads
in France during the Great War.
He, later, invented a perfect
automatic pull-out gear for wind-
mills and numerous other devices
of great utility. In 1877, re-
ceiving his share of the patrimony,
he severed his connection with
the home property, and came to
Queensland with the intention of
striking out for himself in pastoral
enterprise. In this journey he was
accompanied by his brother Thomas,
and the two young men, shortly
after arrival in the Northern State,
conjointly selected “Bellevue” Sta-
tion, which they worked together for
about two years. At the close of
this period, the partnership was
dissolved by mutual consent, each
desiring to carve out an independent
career, and Thomas deciding to re-
main at “Bellevue” Mr. David Fer-
rier looked round for suitable country
upon which to start on his own
account. Almost immediately he
made choice of a Government prop-
erty, situated some five miles from
his present home, and twelve miles

“Brynog” Estate was placed upon the
market by the then owner, the late
Richard James Underwood, of
“Warroo” Station, and Mr. Ferrier,
perceiving a favourable opportunity
to enlarge his operations by the pur-
chase of this valuable holding, made
an offer for the estate, which shortly
afterwards came into his possession.
The name of “Brynog” was bestowed
upon the property by the original
owner —a Mr. Vaughan—who was a
native of Wales, and had early asso-
ciations with the original place of
that name in the old country. This
gentleman, subsequently disposing
of the estate, occupied the office
of police magistrate at Roma, where
he was a well-known personality. In
the first instance the area of the
property comprised only about 2,400
acres, and although during Mr.
Underwood’s regime this had been
slightly enlarged, at the time it
passed out of his ownership it still
contained less than 3,000 acres. Mr.
Ferrier, however, saw in it the pos-
sible nucleus of a large and valuable
holding, and, having secured pro-
prietary rights in the comparatively
small block referred to, he set to
work to enlarge his boundaries by
the selection of all the available
surrounding country, until he had
his own piece of territory, built
up for it a well-deserved repu-
tation as one of the best grazing
propositions in the neighbourhood.

major portion of the run leaves
little to be desired, the good black
soil for which the district is noted,
and dams, located in different parts
of the holding, represent the prin-
cipal means of water supply, and no
less than fourteen windmills have
been erected to render the service of
water to the flocks and herds efficient
and easy. The boundary is protected
by a substantial fence, which is
rendered rabbit-proof by the addi-
tion of wire-netting, and consider-
able attention has been paid to the
work of subdivision. Tire homestead,
erected in 1882, presents the appear-
ance of a comfortable, rural resi-
dence, similar in general characteris-
tics to the many better-class pastoral
homes which w r ere built for the pur-
pose at an earlier date in the various
parts of Queensland, and subse-
quently added to to meet the needs
of a growing family. Tire abundant
verandah shade, so desirable in a
climate like that of Queensland, is
an attractive feature of the house,
and in the interior are found all the
necessary conveniences, with not a
few up-to-date appointments of a
more luxurious character. Among
the out-houses, which also are of
modern design, the spacious wool-
shed is deserving of special mention.
Although, occasionally, a few cattle
are run on the station, principally
for home requirements, the late Mr.
acquired a very large area, aggregat-
ing over 35,000 acres. Retaining for
his own purposes about 16,000 acres,

of the historic families of hop-

Mr. Hammond landed in Australia
in 1825, and subsequently married,
in the early days of New South
Wales, Miss Frances Tully, an aunt
of the original Australian Mrs.
Durack, of the prominent Durack
family, whose name has become a
household word in pastoral circles in
many parts of the island-continent.
Mr. Hammond carried on farming
pursuits in the Mother State, and,
in the latter part of 1866, came to
Queensland, trekking westwards
with his family at about the time of
the settlement of the earliest
pioneers in that region, and bring-

he retained some landed interests on

vicissitudes experienced by those
who essayed the task of opening up
the untouched country at the “back

between the Culgoa River and Lead-

perished for want of water. Before
taking up land for themselves the
family settled for a time on “Coola-

families of Queensland, also found a
temporary resting place whilst pros-
pecting for suitable country upon
which to start operations. In 1869
the Hammonds took un their first
block of territory, to which they
gave the name of “Tenham,” after

excellent working knowledge of the
pastoral industry during the inter-
vals spent at home in holiday time,
and in more youthful days, before
leaving the paternal rooftree, he was
able to take over the administration
of affairs almost at once, and applied
himself diligently to the task before

up in conjunction with his brother-
in-law, Mr. Moustaka, of Western
Australia, a grazing farm, named
“Ingella.” Here he made his home,
and with the few head of stock left
to him after the ravages of the 1902
drought as a nucleus, he came to
“Tenham,” where a much larger
scope was afforded for pastoral opera-
tions. He began with steady deter-
mination, though at times with an
anxious heart, to build up the fallen
fortunes of the now historic station,

miles to the Cooper and Kyabra
Rivers, and besides the advantages
with which it has been endowed by
Nature its value has been greatly
enhanced by the numerous improve-

time by Mr, Hammond and his
father, in the process of its develop-

by the new owners for a couple of

born at Oakey Creek, Dalby, on
February 21, 1871. He is the
youngest son of the late John
MR. J. T. HUMPHREYS
Humphreys, a native of England
and a descendant of a family the
members of which were identified
with agricultural pursuits for many
having been engaged in that calling
from the time of his advent thereto
until his retirement from the Public
Service a short time previous to his
death, which occurred at Toowoom-
ba. He was survived by a widow
and five young children. Mr. J. T.
Humphreys had the benefit of but
a brief period of schooling under his
father’s tuition, his studies being cut
short by the death of the latter. As
a result of this bereavement he was
obliged to leave home before reach-
ing his teens in order to contribute
his share towards the support of the
family and take a position as horse
and cow boy on "Hive Junction,” a
property then owned by the late
A. B. Jones. After a period spent
in that capacity he was promoted to
the duties of general stock hand,
which occupied him for the remain-
ing term of his stay on this station
where he gained a knowledge of
stock work that has since stood him
in good stead. He left “Nive
Junction” for Jericho, Central
Queensland during the drought
which occurred in the district
surrounding Dalby in the year 1884
in order to find pasturage for the
horses which he had acquired as an
investment for his small savings and

he was placed in charge of a stud

of which was then spread all over

the following three years was
engaged in this department of pas-
toral work on various stations in
the district, being acknowledged one
of the best horsemen in the West.
In the year 1894 he accepted the
overseership of “Delta” Station, a
property situated in the vicinity of
Barcaldine, where he remained for a
period, relinquishing the position in
order to take over the dutes of head-
stockman on “Eastmere” Station,
near Aramac. For three years he
carried out the duties incidental to
the latter post, leaving “Eastmere”
in 1897, when he entered upon a
variety of bush occupations, turning
his hand during the ensuing few
years to any form of labour that
would yield him the remuneration
that his capability and experience
merited. He afterwards took cart-
ing contracts in connection with the
construction of the Blackall-Jericho
railway, and on the completion of
that line started as a regular carrier,
his principal route being from
Ilfracombe down the Thomson
River as far as “Retreat” Station,
situated in the vicinity of Jundah.
During the period he was so occu-
pied he balloted for various blocks
of country as they were thrown open
for selection, and in 1913 was
successful in drawing “Hazelmere,”
a block of some 20,000 acres, which
were originally a part of “Eastmere”
Station. With the assistance of his
eldest son, George, he immediately
set himself to the task of developing
this proposition, which is of the
nature usually described as “desert”
country, though the land is of
exceptional value for pastoral pur-
poses and is capable of carrying a
flock of 10,000 in ordinary seasons.
It is of flat formation and timbered
chiefly with ironbark, box, and
black and silver gidya, the soil being
a sandy loam well covered with
indigenous grasses, while plentiful
herbage prevails in the ordinary
seasons. Shortly after entering into
possession of his property Mr.
Humphreys put down a sub-artesian
bore with the object of supplement-
ing the natural water supply, which
is provided by Lake Galilee (to
which the estate has a frontage of
5 miles, and which has been rarely

known to fail) and several creeks
containing numerous holes that may
be depended upon for seven or eight
months in the year, his progressive-
ness providing a safeguard for the
stock against the visitation oi
drought. The flock, which was
raised on a foundation of rams bred
by Mr. A. D. Alexander, of
“Willoughby” and “Beaconsfield ’
ewes, is unsurpassed in the district
both in regard to robustness of
frame and quality of wool. “Hazel-
mere” homestead is situated some 56
miles from Aramac in a north-
easterly direction, and occupies a
site 4 miles distant from Lake
Galilee. Mr. Humphreys’ life has
been spent in hard work and honest
endeavour, and the success which
has attended his efforts is well
deserved. He has always dealt
honestly and fairly by his neigh-
bours, being ever ready to lend a
helping hand when needed, and to
the various movements that are
projected from time to time which
have as their object the advancement
of the district he lends his hearty
support. He is a member of the
United Pastoralists’ and Grazing
Farmers’ Association. For many
years he has been a member of the
Royal Society of St. George and of
the Masonic craft, and takes a keen
interest in the affairs of both bodies.
He married in the year 1891 Sarah
Sophia, daughter of the late Thomas
Corry, a descendant of an old
English family, and who for many
years occupied the position of
Inspector of Fisheries in County
Dublin, Ireland. Of the union there
is a surviving family of three sons
and two daughters. His eldest
daughter is married to Mr. W. L.
Tamblyn, a son of one of the oldest
pioneers of the district, Mr. R. H.
Tamblyn, of “Lake Dunn.”

WILLIAM HENRY LANGUON,
“Adelong,” Aramac, was born at
“Ellendale” Station, near Geelong,
Victoria, on February 12, 18G3. He
is a sou of the late Captain James
MR. J. C. LANGDON.
Conway Langdon, who, originally
an officer of the British Army, left
the Motherland for Australia on his
retirement from the service, and
shortly after his arrival entered
the pastoral industry, purchasing
“Ellendale” Station over sixty years
ago. The late gentleman also pos-
sessed interests in a large flour mill
in the Geelong district. While
occupied with the conduct of his
private affairs he resumed his
association with military matters,
his earlier experience rendering him
a valued officer in the volunteer
forces of Victoria. Subsequently he
disposed of station and other inter-
ests and purchased a property at
Barrabool Hills, where the remain-
ing years of his life were spent and
where his death occurred in the year
1886 at the ripe old age of eighty-
three. He was one of the earliest
Justices of Victoria, and his career
was marked by a public-spiritedness
which caused him to be well and
favourably known in various fields
of activity. A keen sportsman, he
was particularly prominent in hunt-
ing circles, while his efforts were
largely instrumental in the establish-
ment of various forms of clean
sport. Mr. W. H. Langdon received
his scholastic training at the Geelong
Grammar School, leaving this
academy at the age of sixteen to enter
the office of Messrs. Taylor, Buck-
land, & Gates, an old firm of
solicitors practising in Melbourne,
with whom he remained for some
months, relinquishing his legal
duties in order to visit his sister,
who resided at Bowen, North
Queensland. After a short sojourn
in that town, being attracted by the
free and adventurous life of the
bush and disregarding its accom-
panying hardships and perils he
decided to accept a post as stock-
keeper on “Mount Cornish,” in the
Mitchell district, and accordingly
started overland with a riding and
pack-horse, travelling mostly alone
through country infested with notor-
iously dangerous and treacherous
aborigines, eventually arriving
MR. W. H. LANGDON, SEN.
safely at his destination, where he
took over the duties for which he
had been engaged, being at that
time only seventeen years of age.
He remained on “Mount Cornish”
for twelve years, during which
period he went through the whole
gamut of stock and station work,
which included that of horse-
breaker, in which he was most suc-
cessful, and for a time tank-sinking
operator in charge of a team used
for that department of pastoral
development. For the last nine
years of his connection with this
well-known station he occupied the
post of overseer, which he relin-
quished in 1892 in order to embark
on a double venture iu conjunction
with Messrs Tozer and A. C. Cooper,
the firm taking up “Weewondilla,”
near Muttaburra, for grazing pur-
poses, at the same time purchasing a
butchering business in that town.
Mr. Langdon managed both pro-
positions for five years, at the end
of which period he and Mr. Tozer
sold their share in “Weewondilla,”
only retaining their interests in the
butchering business. Subsequently
“Barcorah,” a property situated in
the vicinity of Aramac, was pur-
chased and stocked with sheep.
Their enterprise in this instance
proved unfortunate, however, owing
to a set of unlucky circumstances
which included the illness of Mr.
Tozer, who was obliged to retire
during a period of drought, the
whole burden of liabilities, etc., thus
falling to the share of Mr. Langdon,
whose financial position was far
from satisfactory. Eventually he
was successful in disposing of the
place to Mr. Edmund Jowett, and
thereafter he devoted his attention
to the biitchering trade at Mutta-
burra and Aramac, having in the
meantime opened a business in the
latter town. In the year 1905 he
again entered the pastoral industry,
purchasing “Adelong,” and selecting
“Angora Park.” He at once

inaugurated a system of develop-
ment on the former property, which
was placed in charge of a manager

the outbreak of the Great European
War his eldest son (also W. H.
Langdon) took over the conduct of
the business and was so engaged

JAMES MAURICE GRAY-
BUCHANAN, J.P., ‘'Scotstoun,”
Arainac, Central West Queensland,
was born at Eastfield House, Cam-
buslang, Lanarkshire, Scotland, on
COL. JAMES ROSS GEAY-BUCHANAN.
September 26, 1877, and is the only
surviving son of Colonel James Ross
Gray-Buchanan, who now lives in
retirement on his Scottish estate at
Eastfield. Colonel Gray-Buchanan
served her late Majesty Queen
MR. C. G. GRAY-BUCHANAN
Victoria for many years as an officer
of the 26th Cameronians in India.
As the name denotes he owes his
descent to two of the most ancient
families of Scotland, whose history
and traditions are as old as lliat of
the country itself, the prefixed name
having been assumed with the arms
of the Gray family by his father, the
late James Buchanan, on that gentle-
man’s succession to the estates of
“Eastfield” and “Scotstoun,”
Lanarkshire, on the death of his
blood relative, John Gray, in the
year 1841. The branch of the
Buchanan family represented in
Queensland by the owner of “Scots-
toun,” Aramac, is traceable link by
link through various'cadets back to
the main line of that ilk, the history
of which has been closely interwoven
with that of the “land of brown
heath and shaggy wood, land of the
mountain and the flood,” from time
now lost in the traditional past. The
Grays of “Scotstoun” and “East-
field” were cadets of the old historic
family erstwhile known as the Grays
of Carntyne, whose line ended in the
year 1868 on the death of its last
male member, the late Rev. John
Hamilton Gray, who was celebrated
as a scholar and for his genealogical
research, a branch of science in
which other relatives of the subject
of our notice have also distinguished
themselves, notably, the late
Alexander Wilson Gray-Buchanan.
That gentleman was possibly one of
the most enthusiastic and accurate
genealogists in Scotland, his study
and research resulting in many of
the discoveries that have supplied
the missing links in the chain of
circumstances connecting the his-
tories of many of the oldest and
most distinguished Scottish families.
A tie of kinship exists on the distaff
side of the house between the Gray-
Buchanan and the Ramsay families.
The last-named, who at one time
owned the lands of Over Mungall in
the parish of Falkirk, were for many
generations regarded as one of the
most representative families of the
county. Members of these various
branches of the line have rendered
distinguished military and naval
service to the Empire during many
past generations and up to the
present time, both Captain Walter
Bruce Gray-Buchanan and his
brother having laid down their lives
in defence of national ideals in the
course of the Great World War. The
former, like his father Colonel James
Ross Gray-Buchanan, was a member
of the 26th Cameronians, and Ips
death occurred on the field from
wounds received in the battle which
took place at Neuve Chapelle; while
his brother, the late Cecil Gordon
Gray-Buchanan, was amongst the
earliest of Australia’s volunteers,
having enlisted on the outbreak of

history. The eldest son of Colonel
Gray-Buchanan left his native soil
for Australia in the middle nineties,
settling in Queensland, in the
Mitchell district, and owning a


proposition in the vicinity of Mutta-
burra called “Eastfield” after his
father’s place in Scotland, which he
carried on up to the time of his
death, which occurred on April 27,
1899, as the result of an accident.

received his primary education at
Cargilfield, Edinburgh, completing
his scholastic course at “Repton,”
one of the most widely known public
schools of the Kingdom. Towards
the end of his teens he left this
academy in order to engage in
practical agrarian study at Aspal
Hall, Suffolk, and while so occupied
the lad had the good fortune to make
the acquaintance and gain the
friendship of the late Earl Kitchener,
whose deeds for the Empire have
rendered his name immortal. After-
spending some time in Suffolk, his
mind began to dwell on distant fields
where the scope for achieving a
landed career would be greater than
that afforded by the “tight little
isle” of his birth, the example of his
late brother who, as already stated
was settled in Australia, spurring
him to similar initiative. Accord-
ingly, choosing New Zealand as his
destination, he set sail for the
Dominion in the year 1896, and on
arrival entered upon the duties of
jackaroo on “Pareora,” a sheep
property in the South Canterbury
district. He remained in New
Zealand for three years, during
which period he acquired a thorough
knowledge of sheep on the above-
mentioned and other properties. In
1899, owing to his brother’s death,
he came to Queensland to take over
the latter’s pastoral interests in the
State. He was engaged in grazing
operations on “Eastfield” for several
years, eventually disposing of that
proposition and taking up his present
holding, whereon he has since resided
and to the development of which he
has assiduously applied himself with
satisfactory results, the improve-
ments carried out under his super-
vision being of the most approved
and up-to-date description. The
land comprising “Scotstoun” consists
or rolling downs, well timbered with
boree and gidya and bearing a most
prolific growth of Mitchell grass, the
aspects of the wide vistas of country
disclosed in every direction from the
homestead being exceedingly pic-
turesque and reminiscent of some of
the beautiful parks of England. His
first concern after putting up a
temporary home was to provide the
property with an adequate water
supply, this object being attained by
the sinking of an artesian bore, and
the outlay thus necessitated repaid
by an ample flow which serves the
stock in the various paddocks into
which the run has been subdivided'.
In the latter department of develop-
mental work also he has followed the
most progressive ideas, the paddocks
being well fenced and of varying
sizes, the largest measuring between
four and five thousand acres. The
homestead now occupied by the
owner and his family is a two-storied
building, fulfilling in its design those
essentials of comfort and convenience
that are such large factors in mitigat-
ing the trying conditions of the
western summers. Large verandahs
and balconies are attached to the
structure and afford delightfully cool

decorated with lawns, and flowerbeds
containing shrubs, blooms, and
several varieties of beautiful rose

turesque effect to the dwelling, and

extensive and beautiful views of the
downs arranged by the master hand
of nature. The outhouses are of the
description usually attached to a
pastoral home, and are in keeping
with the general scheme or orderli-
ness and thoroughness which marks
the whole administration of “Scots-
toun.” Ever since his advent to the

FREDERICK WILLIAM
BRIGGS, J.P., “Politic” Station,
Aramac, is a son of the late Henry
Neil Briggs, of Westminster, Eng-
land, who emigrated to Tasmania
MR. F. W. BRIGGS.
over three-quarters of a century
ago, being amongst the earliest
of the free settlers to reach
the island continent. His first
employment was as overseer for
a Mr. Stokell, a member of one of
the pioneer families of Tasmania, and
whilst in this gentleman’s service he
gained considerable experience on the
land, chiefly in connection with the
pastoral and grazing industry.
Several years later he engaged in
pastoral pursuits on his own behalf
at “Richmond Park,” some 20
miles distant from Hobart, where he
continued until his lease had ex-
pired, when he purchased two pro-
perties, known as “Darlington” and
“Peckham Vale,” both of which
were in the vicinity of his former
holding. With his wife and family
he resided on the last-named estate
until the time of his death, which
occurred in the year 1890. The late
Henry N. Briggs was a worthy
pioneer, and left a record of which
his descendants have every reason to
be proud. He did much in the way
of developing the resources of his
adopted country, bravely meeting
the adverse conditions of early settle-
ment, and finally achieving the goal
of success which his labours so richly
deserved. Mrs. Briggs, whom he
married in 1845, was a daughter of
Henry Brunker, “Spring Bank”
Estate, Colebrook, Tasmania, the
issue of the union being five sons
and four daughters. Mr. Frederick
William Briggs was born at “Rich-
mond Park” on October 28, 1865.
Pie received his primary education
under the supervision of tutors in
his father’s home, and later attended
the local State school, completing his
scholastic course at Hutchings’ High
School, Hobart. At the age of 17
he returned to the parental roof tree,
and under his father’s direction
received his first grounding in pas-
toral work, assisting in the opera-
tions connected with the working of
the home property for a time.
Realizing the limited scope afforded
by the industry in his native isle,
MR. GREGORY BRIGGS.
he sought a wider field for his
energy and the fulfilment of his
ambitions, and while yet in his teens
crossed over to the mainland, his
chief assets being his ability and the
will to work, which in the long run
generally spell success. Messrs. Gib-
sou and Taylor placed him in charge
of a number of stud sheep, which
he was commissioned to travel to
“Gungarleen” Station, near Can-
berra, New South Wales. Having
successfully delivered his charges, he
carried out the duties of overseer on
the latter run for about a year, at
the expiration of this time finding
employment on a property in the
Riverina owned by a dealer in fat
sheep, and for a year he familiarized
himself with this side of pastoral
operations. With the object of still
further widening his knowledge of
the industry, in his twenty-second
year he proceeded to “Buckenbee”
Station, on the Darling River, where
he remained for a period, afterwards
journeying overland to Queensland,
via Bourke, New South Wales.
Crossing the border at Barringun he
proceeded to “Tinnenburra” Sta-
tion, which was then owned by the
late James Tyson. Having already
acquired a good grip of the many-
sided aspects of sheep-raising and
wool-growing, and desiring to master
the various details of the cattle-
raising industry, he spent 12 months
in the service of that widely
experienced pioneer, becoming fami-
liar with the handling of horned
stock both in the ordinary routine
of the station and on the roads, a
considerable portion of the time
being spent in overlanding cattle
from “Tinnenburra” to the Wodonga
cattle markets near the border of
Victoria and New South Wales. In
the year 1889 he severed his con-
nection with the above-menetioned
property and accepted a post on
“Warenda,” a cattle station on the
Hamilton River, near Boulia,
Western Queensland, owned by
Messrs. Kent and Wienholt. Here

then owned by the Bank of New

characteristics which have been im-
portant factors in his subsequent
career on the land, were largely

of this time Mr. Briggs endured

ROBERT MOYSE, J.P., “Dun-
raven,” Barcaldine, was born in
Sydney on October 1, 1857, and is
the second son of the late Vickers
Moyse, who was a native of Kent,
MR. V. MOYSE.
England, and a member of an old
farming family of that county.
This gentleman came to Australia
with the Blaxland family, who also
hailed from Kent, and whose name
is indelibly associated with the early
settlement and subsequent develop-
ment of New South Wales. Mr.
John Blaxland and family sailed
from the Old World in their own
schooner, which contained stock and
household furniture, etc., destined
for their personal use, arriving at
rejoining him in his adopted country
a few years after his advent thereto.
For many years he was engaged in
the pastoral industry, subsequent to
which he became a postal inspector
in the Civil Service, the duties of
which post occupied him until the
time of his death. He left a family
of three sons and four daughters.
Mr. Robert Moyse received his early
education at Christ Church School,
Sydney, and completed his collegiate
course at that noted seat of learning
known as “Calder House” in the
same city. Discarding his books at
the age of 14, and responding to that
spirit of enterprise which prompted
him to see something of life in the
vast unoccupied spaces of his native
land, he became one of a droving
party headed by Henry Bloomfield
to take a mob of 2,000 cattle from
“Miriam Vale,” Port Curtis, to
“Evesham,” these being tbe first
horned stock depastured on that pro-
perty. He remained on “Evesham”
in the capacity of a jackaroo, and
during the two years in which he
was so occupied received a good
insight into the methods of working
a cattle station in the early days of
settlement in the district, when the
industry was carried out under most
adverse conditions, inferior food,
lack of vegetables, and other priva-
tions being included in the lot of the
station folk. Mr. Moyse’s experience,

he retained for 11 years, the scene of
his work having been the Walgett

resigned from the service in order to
join his brother-in-law, Mr. H.
C. Taylor, in the purchase of
“Dunraven,” a property situated in
the Barcaldine district, which had
claimed so much of his interest 40
years previously, taking over the
managing partnership a year later.
He subsequently purchased Mr.

Station, having been taken up by a
Mr. Davis over a quarter of a
century ago. It later passed into
the possession of Messrs. Coldham
Bros., who, after inaugurating many
improvements, sold it, as stated, to
the gentleman under review and his
former partner. Since taking over
the property Mr. Moyse has con-
siderably added to the development
carried out by the former owners,
with the result that at time of
writing it ranks as one of the most
highly developed concerns of its
kind in the district. The run is
composed of well-sheltered rolling
downs, timbered chiefly with gidya
and boree, and clothed with
Mitchell, blue, Flinders, and other
good stock grasses, though the
last-mentioned affording a good
supply during half the year, and the
combined resources rendering the
property safe for all purposes in any
season. It is subdivided into 14
paddocks, which are adapted to the
convenient working of the flock,
which averages some 20,000 merinos.
The homestead, which is one of the
most picturesque pastoral dwellings
of the west, having been built on
true bungalow lines, is very modern,
yet nevertheless suggestive of an old-
time station home. It is surrounded
by outhouses which present those
features of orderliness so character-
istic of the whole property, while
both native shade and fruit trees
lend their beauty to the general
scheme, the charm of which is still
further enhanced by cultivated
shrubs, clipped hedges, and shel-
tered beds wherein bloom choicest
flowers, the whole providing a
picture that is refreshingly homelike.
Mr. Moyse is a Justice of the Peace
for the State of New South Wales.
He is prominent in the controlling
council of the Barcaldine Pastoral
and Agricultural Show Society and
a member and committeeman of the
Barcaldine Club. A keen supporter
of all clean forms of sport he is
particularly inclined to legitimate
racing, being a member of the
committee of the local jockey club.
He married in the year 1900 Fanny,
daughter of the late James Moore,
of “Bugilbone” Station, New South

legion in that part of England where
the line has been identified with the
trade for several generations. Mr.
R. H. Tamblyn was educated in the
village of Tregrehanmills, in the
vicinity of his old home, and con-
cluded his scholastic studies when
still a lad in order to assist his father
in the conduct of his business. He
remained under the paternal roof-
tree until he was tweny-one years of
age, when he accepted an offer made
to several young men of the locality
by the Peak Downs Copper Mining
Company of positions under contract
for two years in their mines in
Queensland. Accordingly, on Feb-
ruary 28, 1873, he set sail by the
"Countess Russell” for the far-away
and then little-known land of the
Southern Cross, in due course arriv-
ing at Keppel Bay, where he exper-
ienced a month of quarantine as the
result of an epidemic of fever
amongst the ship’s company. On his
realease from quarantine he pro-
ceeded to his destination and entered
upon the duties for which he had
been engaged. Two years later, on
the completion of his contract in the
Peak Downs Mines, he secured a
position as stock-keeper on “Gros-
venor Downs,” a property then
owned by the late A. B. McDonald.
Here, under the tuition of the late
John F. McArthur, who was one of
the most able and experienced
stockmen of the North, he rapidly
became familiar with the various
aspects of stock and station work
and was soon recognized as a very
capable cattle-man. He remained
on the above-mentioned station for
seven years, relinquishing his post
as head stockman in the year 1882
in order to take over the manage-
ment of “Lake Dunn” for the
executors of the Estate of the late
Charles Briggs, an early pioneer
whose two sons and one daughter are
also connected with the pastoral
industry, one of the sons owning in
addition to other interests of a
similar nature in the Mitchell dis-
trict, “Louvain,” on the banks of
Lake Galilee, in the vicinity of
Aramac. For twenty-three years
the subject of our memoir carried
out his managerial duties on “Lake
Dunn,” at the termination of which
period, in the year 1905, the pro-
perty was equally divided among
the children of the late Mr. Briggs.
Mr. Tamblyn purchased the shares
of the elder brother and his sister
and entered into partnership with
the younger, who retained his por-
tion of the estate, the connection
continuing until the year 1918. On
undertaking the administration of
the property in the year 1882 Mr.
Tamblyn found it undeveloped (the
late owner’s death having occurred a

the land), but by the exercise of

the district. The present area of the
land owned by the gentleman under
review approximates over 42,000
acres of good pastoral country of the
type erroneously described as “desert
country,” but which in reality is
exceptionally safe for stock in
all seasons. Its average carrying
natural springs provide a supply of
water ample for the needs of the
stock. Other improvements include
the subdivision of the run into six
paddocks of varying sizes and a
modern homestead. The original
dwelling was built on the banks of
Lake Dunn but the resumption of a
portion of the estate by the Govern-
ment in 1914 resulted in the erection
in that year of the present home on
a more convenient site in the centre
of the property. Standing on
blocks 9 feet from the ground the
which is covered with a bungalow
roof and designed on up-to-date
lines, consists of well-ventilated
rooms 16 feet in height and very
wide verandahs. It is situated about
50 miles from Aramac, which is the
nearest town, though for many years
Jericho, which is 90 miles distant
from “Lake Dunn,” was the centre
to which Mr, and Mrs. Tamblyn
were obliged to travel for mails and
stores. Since his advent to the
district Mr. Tamblyn has actively
concerned himself with the various
movements connected with its ad-
vancement, and at time of writing
is a member of the Aramac Shire
Council. He was created a Justice
of the Peace a few years ago. Since
the year 1873 he has been associated
with the Oddfellows’ Lodge, being
one of the oldest Queensland mem-
bers and an office-bearer of that
body, the distinction of Past Noble
Grand having been conferred upon
him by the Order for merit. But in
Freemasonry he has been most
prominent, his association with the
craft dating back a quarter of a
century. He has filled the various
offices of honour in the Aramac
Lodge and on five distinct occasions
was elected to the Master’s chair.
In 1904 he was appointed D.A.G.

worthy of note that since his arrival
in the country he has never had a
day’s illness. He married in the
year 1884 Elizabeth, widow of the
late Charles Briggs. Mrs. Tamblyn
is a daughter of the late William
Crossman, who originally hailed
from Tavistock, Devonshire, and
landed in Australia in the year 1852.
In common with many other enter-
prising spirits who arrived at this
period he proceeded to the goldfields
and tried his luck in the various
rushes of the romantic days of the
building up of the Southern Colonies,
and after following the mining
industry for some years revisited
England, returning shortly to Aus-
tralia with his family and settling at
Copperfield, near Clermont, for a
short time. Mrs. Tamblyn lived
there until the occasion of her first
marriage in 1873. In her subse-
quent life she experienced to the full
the many trials, sacrifices, and hard-
ships incidental to early settlement
in Queensland which would be
inconceivable to the more luxuriously
placed of her sex. Her children
were born in the backblocks in the
primitive days preceding the advent
of hospitals and their scientific

and is a son of the late Captain
Robert Atkin Hickson, formerly of
the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers, who
was a descendant of a family, which
we learn by reference to “Burke’s
Irish Landed Gentry,” came to
Ireland from Cambridgeshire during
the fifteenth century, its principal
members being then given grants of
land according to the system of
settlement constituted by the Eng-
lish Parliament at the time, and
made governors of certain portions
of the country. The Hicksons, who
became very prominently known in
Ireland, are allied by matrimony
with most of the old Kerry families
of note. A relative of Mr. Hickson,
of “Saxby Downs,” is the author
of a book entitled “Reminiscences
of an Irish Land Agent.” An
early scion of the Irish line, one
Robert Hickson, of “Grove Dingle,”
was a Deputy Governor and County
High Sheriff in 1749, and had a
family of five sons and two daught-
ers. His eldest son, John, married
Barbara, daughter of John Mahony,
of “Dronmore” Castle, County
Kerry, the union resulting in three
sons and five daughters. John, the
eldest son of John and Barbara
Hickson, had only one son, Robert
Albert, now General Hickson, who,
having sold all his Irish estates
except “Ballintaggart,” resides in
England. Of the other sons of
Robert Hickson, the third, the Rev.
Robert, was the great-grandfather
of the gentleman under review. He
married a member of the Hussey
family and had one son and three
daughters, namely, William Murray,
Ann, Sarah, and Julia. William
Murray Hickson married Louise
Atkin, Careystown, County Cork,
grand-daughter on the maternal side
of Colonel Fitzgerald, of Cork Bay,
County Cork, a leading man at that
time and a direct ancestor of the
CAPT. R. A. HICKSON.
late Sir Robert Uniacke-Vencose-
Fitzgerald. Through the marriage
of William Murray Hickson and
Louise Atkin the owner of “Grove
Dingle” is directly descended from
the famous Katherine Fitzgerald,
Countess of Desmond, who is said
to have lived to the age of
one hundred and forty-five. This
lady lived in the 17th century, and
her memory is said to have gone
back to the days of Richard 111.,
who reigned from 1483 to 1485.
She is reputed to have declared
that that unscrupulous monarch
had no hump on his back. Wil-
liam Murray Hickson’s family
consisted of seven sons —Robert
Atkin (father of Mr. Hick-
son of “Saxby Downs”), Walter,
William, James, Fitzgerald (the
present head of the family in Ire-
land), who married the second
daughter of the Right Hon. Sir
Samuel Walker, Bart., who for
many years was Lord Chancellor of
Ireland, Albert, and John —and one
daughter, Gertrude, who married
Dr. C. Martin, of the Indian Civil
Service. Captain Robert Atkin
Hickson fought with General Gordon
at the time of the taking of Hong-
kong by the English and spent
several years with the British Army
in India. Subsequently, in the
early sixties, he came to Queensland,
where his brother, Walter, one of
the early pioneers of the North-
western districts of the State, had
previously settled, having been asso-
ciated with the Palmer and Hodg-
kinson goldfields before permanently
devoting himself to the pastoral
industry, in which connection, in
association with the firm of Collins
and White, he founded many of the
old stations of the far North-western
portion oif Queensland, before this
State had been granted her own
constitution. On his advent to
Queensland, Captain R. A. Hickson

late James Sparkes, of “Barbigal”
Station, near Dubbo, New Sontb
MR. W. B. J. G. SPARKES
Wales, who came from County Nor-
folk, England, where for generations
the members of the family had en-
gaged in agricultural pursuits. The
late gentleman arrived in Victoria
in the early forties, at the time of
the gold discoveries in that Colony,
and his blood being fired by the
numerous and glowing reports of rich
finds of golden metal, he decided to
try his luck on the diggings. Success
did not come his way, so abandoning
for ever this mode of life, he crossed
the border into New South Wales,
and accepted the post of overseer on
"Barbigal” Station, a jrroperty of
30,000 acres. The run subsequently
was taken possession of by the Bank
of New South Wales, from which
institution it was purchased by Mr.
Sparkes in 1880. Here the new owner
devoted his attention to the raising
of high-class sheep, and at a later
date he started a shorthorn stud,
which soon came to be regarded as
one of the finest in the Australian
States. Mr. James Sparkes died at
"Barbigal” in the year 1896, and
thenceforward for a dozen years the
estate was carried on by trustees, one
of whom was Mr. James Sparkes’s
widow. Mrs. Sparkes, it is interesting
to note, was a member of the Yates
family, so well known in the Western
District of Victoria. The subject
under review, Mr. W. B. J. G.
Sparkes, was born on the home pro-
perty in 1889, and was seven years
of age when his father crossed the
"Great Divide.” Educated at first
under governesses at "Barbigal,”
in his twelfth year he entered
St. Joseph’s College, Hunter Hill,
Sydney, where he completed his
scholastic career. In 1905 he returned
to the parental rooftree, and during
the ensuing 12 months gained useful
insight into the workings of a pas-
toral enterprise. He next accepted
the post of overseer at “Momba”
Station, near White Cliffs, New
South Wales, which embraced within
its boundaries some 2,500,000 acres,
over which a flock of 600,000 was
grazed. This station is owned by the
Momba Pastoral Company, of South
Australia. Although but 17 years
of age, Mr. Sparkes practically
had control of some hundred men,
employed in various capacities on the
run, and his duties were not made
any the easier by the fact that the
average rainfall was in the vicinity
of 5 inches per annum. Here he con-
tinued for two years, at the expira-
tion of which time he once again
wended his footsteps to his father’s
property. The time had now arrived
when "Barbigal” was to be sold
under the terms of his father’s
BULL "MANSEL LIBERATOR” (IMP.)
will, and the proceeds distributed
among the beneficiaries—five in all.
The station was sold in 1909, Mr.
W. B. J. G. Sparkes, in conjunction
with his sister, purchasing a portion
of the area, which was devoted to
mixed farming. Twelve months later
he disposed of his interests in the
property to his sister and came to
Queensland, where he purchased 200
horses, which be overlanded to Well-
ington, New South Wales, a distance
of 1,200 miles. The country being in
the throes of a severe drought, the
venture did not prove a financial
success, the returns barely covering
the outlay. He returned to the
Northern State in 1911, and travelled
over the major portion of the country
seeking a suitable area upon which to
establish a stud farm. Finally
“Lyndley” came under inspection,
and his investigations proving satis-
factory, he purchased the property
from the owner, Mr. E. K. Tidswell.
At that time “Lyndley” comprised
6,000 acres, principally open downs,
myall and box country, very little
improvement work having been done.
Mr. Sparkes immediately commenced
to remedy this state of affairs and
render the property suitable to the
object he had in view. He fenced the
boundary, and formed 32 paddocks,
and sank a number of wells, in this
way providing a permanent supply of
water in each enclosure. The wells
are fitted with windmills and storage
tanks, the capacity of which ranged
from 10,000 to 40,000 gallons. This
artificial supply is augmented by a
large lagoon of permanent water, in


places 15 feet hi depth, besides which
Downfall Creek flows through the
property, the whole providing a
never-failing supply. On the sandy
flats near the lagoon lucerne is
grown, a large acreage being sown
with this valuable fodder. The
timber, which in the first place had
been badly rung, next engaged his
attention, and he had this work
properly carried out and the thick
growth of seedling timber removed.
All these improvements cost in the
vicinity of £9,000. The homestead is
a large and commodious dwelling,
built in the bungalow style, with
double walls, which keep it cool even
in the hottest periods, and is fitted up
with the most modern conveniences.

to exhibit his stock in 1913 at Bris-

the intervening years has captured
7 champion prizes, 10 reserve chain-

the best specimens of the Hereford

into the Commonwealth, and should
go far in increasing the prestige
already gained by the Lindley stud.

New South Wales. Included in this
quintette were “Wonder’s Joy” (621,

breeder of stud stock Mr. Sparkes
has been singularly successful, which
fact may be attributed to his expert
knowledge and fine, all-round judg-
ment of the Hereford breed. In his
opinion Queensland has the finest
cattle country in Australia, and he
holds that cattle develop much more
rapidly and grow to greater propor-
tions than in any other State of the
Commonwealth. Mr. Sparkes takes
an interest in affairs of local moment,

JAMES EDWARD COXON,
“Elwell,” Muttaburra, Central
Queensland, was born near Ballarat,
Victoria, on June 27, 1860, and is
the youngest son of the late George
MR. J. E. COXON.
Coxon, a native of Newcastle-on-
Tyne, England, who arrived in Aus-
tralia in the year 1857, being at that
time about thirty-five years of age.
The late gentleman was an engineer
and practised his profession both in
England and in the land of his
adoption, establishing himself at
Ballarat soon after his advent to the
country. Subsequently, on behalf
of various mining companies, he
followed the same calling at other
gold-bearing centres as the rushes
event dated, his technical knowledge
being much in demand. Attracted
by the possibilities of landed enter-
prise, he later selected a holding in
the vicinity of Casterton and worked
this area chiefly as a wool-growing
proposition, carrying on farming as
a side issue. Eventually he retired
to Portland, Victoria, where he
resided until the time of his death
in 1893. He married Mary, daughter
of the late Timothy Dodgson, a
descendant of old English stock, the
name having been long identified
with farming pursuits in Durham.
Of this union there was a family of
four sons and four daughters. Follow-
ing in the footsteps of their parent,
the sons have directed their energies
to developing (he resources of their
native land for upwards of half a
century. The eldest, John, is settled
on the land in Victoria, while
George, who now lives in retirement
at “Gateshead,” Lindum, near Bris-
bane, and Francis, owner of “Glen-
dower” Station, Prairie, North
Queensland, and James Edward, are
still closely identified with pastoral
interests in Queensland. Mr. J. E.
Coxon, the subject of this notice,
was educated at Hamilton, Victoria,
concluding his studies on the attain-
ment of his sixteenth year when he
joined his father and brothers in
their operations on the home acres,
remaining under the paternal roof-
tree for a few years. Later he was
connected with the flour milling
industry, spending about two years

in the establishment of Mr. H.
Clapham, at Coleraine, Victoria. He
relinquished his post at the end of
that period in order to join two of
his brothers, George and Frank, in
agricultural enterprise on the Darl-
ing Downs, they having settled in
Queensland some time previously and
subsequently represented in attrac-
tive colours the possibilities of the
State. On his arrival, in the year
1879, he also selected a block of
farming land, the trio working their
properties on a mutual basis and
experiencing the excessive hardships
incidental to the development of
virgin country in those primitive
times, when the many aids to the
industry which now exist were lack-
ing. Owing to the insecurity of the
seasons at this time he was constantly
obliged to leave his farm for long
periods together in order to obtain
the wherewithal necessary for its
development, during these intervals
being occupied with shearing and
general bush work, with occasional
spells of droving. The irregularity
of the rainfall eventually caused him
to abandon landed pursuits for a
period, and, disposing of his property
in the year 1886, he decided to try
his luck in the mining industry, the
Croydon gold discoveries having
eventuated at about this time and
arrested the attention of the business
population of the continent. He was
one of the first on the field, reaching
the diggings early in the following
year, when he entered upon a
prospecting career which afforded
him considerable experience and
mixed success, his efforts being
requitted at times by the discovery of
gold of an indifferent grade in con-
siderable quantities. The mining
industry at this centre occupied his
energies until the year 1888, when,
having contracted malarial fever,
which is usually so prevalent on
newly opened fields, he returned
perforce to a life more conducive to
the preservation of health, selecting
in the latter end of that year a

he, like others, was severely handi-
capped for lack of capital, owing
to the impossibility of securing
advances from any financial institu-
tion on such small acreage and in the
circumstances of the selector. Such
a state of things necessarily involved
a long uphill fight for the gentleman
under review, who for lengthy
periods at a time was obliged to work
very long hours in order to make a
bare living. In due course, however,
prevailing conditions altered and he
was enabled by purchase and selec-
tion to add other lands to his original
holding, so that at time of writing
“Kateroy” embraces over 17,000
acres of choice rolling downs of good
carrying capacity, the country being
well watered by the Thomson River,
lagoons, dams, etc. Encouraged by
the success attending his earlier
ventures as a result of industry and
perseverance, he decided to extend

All four propositions are now worked
collectively under a family partner-
ship, the firm being known under the
title of J. E. Coxon & Son. The
area of the combined holdings totals
some 160,000 acres varying from
open Mitchell grass downs to spinifex

FREDERICK AUGUSTUS
ALLEN, “Nalemba,” Aramac, was
born in the Grenfell district, New
South Wales, on April 6, 1880, and
is the youngest son of the late
MR. F. ALLEN.
Francis Allen, who was on© of the
original pastoral landowners in that
part of the Mother State. The late
Mr. Allen hailed from the United
States of America, where many
generations of his progenitors first
saw the light, though the family
trace their descent from old Celtic
stock. While yet in his teens he left
his home in the western hemisphere
and sailed for the land of the
Southern Cross, drawn thither by
the fascinating lure of the early
goldfields. He arrived in Victoria
in the late fifties and immediately
identified himself with mining pur-
suits, following the industry at
various centres of gold-bearing fame
in the Colony and in the central and
southern portions of New South
Wales. Though meeting with in-
different success in his quest for the
coveted metal he persevered until
the prosperity of the fields showed
signs of diminishing, when in
conjunction with a partner, he
opened a business in Grenfell. After
a period he sold out his share in this
proposition which at time of writing
is still flourishing, and entered
the pastoral industry, acquiring
interests in “Wheogo” cattle station,
New South Wales, where he person-
ally engaged in grazing pursuits for
pp
a number of years. Later he became
the owner of “Binda” Station on the
Lachlan River and of “Lake Cowal
West,” in the Forbes district, New
South Wales, eventually disposing of
the former property and settling on
“Lake Cowal West,” where he
remained until the time of his death
in the year 1904, at the age of 64.
His memory is worthy of all honour
for the fin© qualities of citizenship
displayed during the many years of
his life in Australia. He left a
family of four sons and six
daughters. Several members of the
line which he founded in the land
of his adoption have proved them-
selves to be fitting descendants of the
fine old pioneer, having taken their
part in defence of national ideals in
the great struggle which recently
agitated the civilized world, and one

of his grandsons met his death in the
firing line. Mr. F. A. Allen received
his primary education at Dubbo,
New South Wales, and later attended
the Cooerwell Academy in the Blue
Mountains, completing his scholastic
course at the Sydney Grammar
School when in his seventeenth
year. In 1897 he joined his
father, and under that gentleman’s
able tuition gained practical ex-
perience of stock and station work.
Four years later he relinquished his
connection with pastoral affairs with
the idea of eventually settling in the
sugar industry, and with this end in
view proceeded to Banual Levu, one
of the Fiji Islands, where he became
familiar with the various processes
connected with cane growing and its

remaining on the island until the
year 1905. His return to Australia
was necessitated through his father’s
death, and as a result, he took over
the management of “Mount Cowal
West,” retaining the position until
the property was disposed of some
two years later. Deciding at this
time to devote his energies to pastoral
pursuits he journeyed to Queensland
and purchased the block of land upon
which his present homestead now
stands, which consisted of 12,000
acres of virgin country in the
vicinity of Aramac. He immediately
settled on his newly-acquired pro-
perty, which he named “Nalemba,”
and applied himself to the work of
development. Subsequently, realiz-
ing that the area did not allow of
sufficient scope for expansion in the
industry, he purchased “Levuka,”
a proposition of over 33,000 acres
situated near Muttaburra and still
later in 1916, added to his landed
interests by the purchase of “Ivy
Leaf,” the latter property, which
occupies a portion of the country
outlying Aramac, being of about the
same acreage as “Levuka.” He

he resided at Gladstone and Rock-

purchasing land for the purpose,
erected the Railway Hotel, which he
opened on the same day as the
railway line to Longreach was
declared open to traffic. He occupied
the Railway Hotel until 1898 when
he retired from active business life.
Some twenty years later, on
November 21, 1918, when at the age
of seventy-eight years he crossed the
Great Divide, leaving a widow, three
sons, and two daughters, and a
name which is held in affectionate
memory by many friends, and
especially by the old residents of the
district to whom the generosity of his
nature was well known. The gentle-
man under review received such
education as was possible in view of
the nomadic calling followed by his
father, in the State schools of
Westwood and Comet at the respec-
tive periods when those centres were
the late gentleman’s headquarters,
concluding his studies when at the
age of twelve years in order to
accompany and assist the latter in
his journeys. Tn the year 1887, in
conjunction with his brother William,
he took charge of the teams and for
the following eleven years was
engaged on the roads, lie disposed
of his interests in the carrying
business in 1898 and took over the
lease of the Railway Hotel from the
late John Ahern, purchasing the
property outright in the following
year, thence forward filling the role
of “mine host” of that hostelry until
1911, except for an interval of one
year which he spent in retirement,
On relinquishing his connection with
the Railway Hotel he entered the
pastoral industry, having selected in
the same year a grazing property
named “Thornton,” which was one
of the original “Tower Hill” Station
resumptions, and of which he
immediately took possession. A
system of development had already
been inaugurated on “Thornton,”
and Mr. Ahern quickly applied
himself to the work of further
improvement. Some time after
acquiring “Thornton” he purchased
an adjoining block, thus extending
the scope of his operations and
bringing the acreage of his properties
to a figure approaching 30,000. Both
sheep and cattle are successfully
grazed on the area, which is
eminently suitable for either depart-
ment of the industry. The flock,
which numbers nearly 10,000, was
founded on the progeny of the well-
known “Portland Downs” and
“Aramac” Station flock, the strain
being improved by the introduction
of “Coonong” rams. He has
specialized in a small way in short-
horn cattle, the herd comprising
some two hundred head; and as an
experienced horse - breeder has
devoted a good deal of attention to
the equine department of the opera-
tions conducted under his super-
vision, about sixty head of horses
being carried on the properties at
time of writing, such of the latter
not required for station use being
readily disposed of locally. Mr.
Ahern is always ready to lend his
support to such movements having
for their object the advancement of
the district or the progress of
Western Queensland, though being
of a retiring nature he has hitherto
refrained from taking a prominent
part in public life. He is well known
as a clean sportsman, having raced
many horses; and his racing colours
—blue jacket, white sash, blue and
white cap —have been seen frequently
at the head of the field. In fact he
has met with unqualified success at
the principal professional meetings
that have eventuated at various
centres from Rockhampton to the
Far West, his wins being always
popular. Mr. Ahern married in
May, 1896, Elizabeth, daughter of
the late John Smith of Rockhampton,
a well-known pioneer of the early
days of Queensland, and one who
was regarded as one of the identities
of Rockhampton. Of the union there

LESLIE NORMAN KIBBLE
MUNRO, "Coorahbar,” Arainac,
was born in Denman, New South
Wales, on February 14, 1877, and is
the third son of the late Alexander
MR. G. MUNRO.
Ross Munro and a grandson of the
late George Munro, who came from
Scotland in the early fifties and
MR. L. N. K. MUNRO.
settled with his family on the
Wolombi, Ilawkesbury River, New
South Wales, where he engaged in
farming pursuits for a brief period.
He afterwards moved to Richmond
Grove, on the Goulburn River,
where he followed farming and
pastoral occupations. The early
progenitors of this gentleman
established themselves near Aber-
deen centuries ago, and on a
property called “Watson’s View”
succeeding generations of the race
farmed their own land and were
regarded by their contemporaries as
notably successful agriculturalists.
Mr. Alexander Ross Munro, who
was an only son, accompanied his
father from the land of the heather,
and on reaching manhood relieved
the latter (who was well advanced in
years on arrival in Australia) of the
work and administration of the
home acres. While still a young
man the family transferred their
interests from farming to pastoral
pursuits, and in the latter connec-
tion Mr. A. Ross Munro was
afforded an opportunity of gaining
experience in cattle buying and deal-
ing, and in this role became a well-
known figure at the famous Home-
bush markets, which he attended for
some years. “Denman” Station, on
the Bree, which was called after the
township in New South Wales
wherein he first settled, was founded
by him, and subsequently he formed
in conjunction with the Drynan
family the famous “Nockatunga”
Station and carried on pastoral work
there and at “Denman” for a
number of years, eventually experi-
encing the reverses which fell to the
lot of many other brave and sturdy
founders of Australian nationhood,
with the result that he returned to
stock buying and droving as a means
of livelihood. In the latter calling
he was associated with the White,
Bell, and other well-known pastoral
families. About this time he was
joined by the subject of our memoir,
Mr, L. N. K. Munro, who had just
concluded his scholastic education.
The first droving trip undertaken by
the last-named gentleman was in the
early part of his seventeenth year,
the route travelled extending from
Denman, New South Wales, to
“Alice Downs,” and thence to
“Tooloombilla” Station, in the
Maranoa district. Mr. Leslie N. K.
Munro continued to assist his father
in his dealing operations, which
consisted of the buying and droving
of woolly stock chiefly, until the
advancing age of the latter de-
manded his retirement from active
life, when his son took over the
full responsibility. For many years
lie followed his calling over all the
principal routes of Queensland and
New South Wales under contracts
from the leading stock owners, and

stock routes of both States, every
track and its features in regard to
camping places, etc., being familiar
to him. Shortly after his marriage
he entered the pastoral industry as


a land owner, and in the year 1906
took up “Coorahbar,” in the vicinity
of Aramac, subsequently purchasing
“Lockholm,” a property situated in
the same locality, which after

submitting to a course of develop-
ment he disposed of. While breeding
up his stock and supervising the
progressive developmental operations
which he instituted on “Coorahbah”
he devoted the greater part of his
energies to dealing, thus advancing
his interests with a view to launch-
ing out on a larger scale when the
opportunity offered. In 1913 he
joined his brother-in-law, Mr.
Charles Briggs, late of “Lake
Dunn,” in a stock partnership, a
connection which has proved of
mutual advantage and continues to
the satisfaction of both parties. Mr.
Munro devotes his particular atten-
tion to “Coorahbar,” the other areas
in which he is now interested being
conducted under special management.
“Coorahbar” embraces about 24,000
acres of mixed country composed of
black soil downs, clothed with Mit-
chell grass, and on the eastern
boundary of sandy ridges of the so-
called desert country bearing Mit-
chell and other grasses, light
spinifex, herbage, and top feed
which make this class of country safe
in all seasons. The run has been
subdivided into several paddocks of
comparatively small dimensions for
the more convenient handling and
grazing of the stock; other improve-
ments include a sub-artesian bore,
which provides an abundant pumping
supply of first-class water. The
“Coorahbar” homestead, which is
situated about 36 miles from
Aramac, was erected on up-to-date
lines by the present owner in the
year 1909 and is of bungalow archi-
tecture, the residence having been
designed with a view to mitigating
the trying conditions prevalent in
Central Queensland. It contains six
rooms and is surrounded by wide
verandahs, additional shelter being
provided by shade trees of native

growth which add picturesqueness to
the surroundings. A public-spirited
man, Mr. Munro has prominently
identified himself with all move-
ments set afoot for the welfare of
the community. He is a committee-
man of the Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Show Society of Barcaldine
and a member of the United Pastor-
alists and Grazing Farmers’ Associa-
tion. -The sport of kings also claims
his keen interest and support, and
he is on the committee of the local
club besides being a member of the
Barcaldine and Rockhampton Race
Clubs. lie is a member of the Bar-
caldine Club and an energetic sup-
porter of Red Cross and other
patriotic and charitable organiza-
tions. On the outbreak of the great
European War he was among the
early volunteers for service, but to
his extreme disappointment failed to
pass the medical test. Mr. Munro
married in 1901 Mary Agnes,
daughter of the late Charles Briggs,
of “Lake Dunn” Station, who was
one of the pioneers of the pastoral
industry in Central Queensland.
The late gentleman hailed from
Nottingham, England, where his
father was engaged for many years
in the practice of medicine, having
been a member of one of the old
aristocratic families of that County,
where the name is still well known
and highly esteemed. Mrs. Munro
has proved herself a true example of
the finest type of Australian woman-
hood —a loyal and practical wife, ever
ready to share in the sacrifices and
to soften the hardships inseparable
from bush life under the primi-
tive conditions that existed in earlier-
years. Of the union there is one
son and one daughter, Lionel Varell
and Irene Norma.

MR, R. H. TEMPLETON
on October 4, 1873. He is the
eldest son of the late Robert Henry

of Scottish forbears, certain of whom
eventually established a branch of
the family in the North of Ireland,
the late gentleman’s father having
been a clergyman of the Presbyterian
Communion at Ballyatwood, County

to Australia in early manhood, his
subsequent life being spent in
pastoral pursuits in different parts of

hardships, sacrifices and dishearten-
ing failures that so often attended
MR. E. H. TEMPLETON
the efforts of the pioneer settlers in
the early days of the State, more
especially in the further backblocks
where the lines of his life were cast.
One of his first ventures was a
property situated near Camooweal,
on the Queensland side of the South
Australian border, which he con-
ducted as a cattle proposition over
fifty years ago, and where his

chief among which was the want of
a market for his stock, operated
against the success of this undertak-
ing, which he was obliged to


relinquish after having expended
practically the whole of his capital
in working it. He made a fresh start
in the Dawson Valley district in
partnership with the late Robert

“ Retro’ ’ Station, near Clermont,
for a number of years), on this
occasion engaging in the wool-
growing industry, in which he was
also unsuccessful, being unable to
cope with prevailing conditions which
rendered his strongest efforts
unavailing. Undeterred by the
frowns of fortune he returned to the
cattle industry, owning, in partner-
ship with his brother-in-law, Mr.
Eric Henry Mackay, “Tierawoomba”
Station, in the vicinity of Mackay,
general station work and mining
pursuits. He died at Rockhampton
at the comparatively early age
of forty-one, being survived by a
family of four sons. His wife, who
is also deceased, was the only
daughter of the late Lieutenant-
Colonel Henry Fowler Mackay, a
scion of the ancient Highland clan of
that designation, a brief account of
whose career we quote from a record
which appeared at the time of his
death: —“Lieutenant-Colonel Henry
Fowler Mackay, who died recently
at Bath in his ninety-eighth year,
was the only surviving son of Mr.
Alexander George Mackay, of Bag-
thorpe Hall, Norfolk. He was at
Harrow under Dr. Butler from 1813
silk trade riots in 1826, when he was
sent from Manchester, where he was
quartered, to Macclesfield. After his
retirement from military service
Colonel Mackay was appointed Chief
of the East Sussex Constabulary, an
office which he retained for forty-one
years. He married in 1838 Caroline
Matilda, youngest daughter of
Lieutenant-General George Robert
Ainslie.” Besides the last-mentioned
gentleman, the distaff side of the
family has produced other distin-
guished members, among whom was
Lieutenant-Colonel Frederic George
Ainslie, C. 8., who was wounded in
the battle of Inkerman and whose
career provoked an enconium in
which he is recorded as being “a good
man, a perfect gentleman, and a
gallant soldier.” A maternal uncle
of the gentleman under review was
also wounded in the Crimean War,
losing a leg in that historic struggle.
The late Mr. Mackay’s four sons are
all engaged in landed pursuits, three
in the pastoral industry in Queens-
land, and the fourth engages in
mixed farming near Grafton, in the
Clarence River district of New South
Wales. Mr. Eric Henry Templeton,
the second son, is associated with his
maternal uncle, Mr. Eric Henry
Mackay, in the ownership of
“Huntley” Station in the Leichhardt
district, and manages that property,
the elder partner having retired from
where again his efforts were doomed
to failure. In the year 1879 he
relinquished his connection with this
station and for the remaining years
of his life was occupied with

Inniskillen Dragoons in 1825, was
made captain in 1830 and paymaster
in 1840. His first experience of
service was in connection with the
active business pursuits. The latter
gentleman who, at time of writing,
lives in England, was a well-known
Queensland pastoralist and for a
considerable time a member of the

has since proved extremely useful to
him in carving his own career. He
relinquished his post at “Mount

having in the interim risen to the
position of overseer, which he
resigned when the station changed
hands. In the year 1899 he decided
on an independent career, starting


life as a drover and subsequently
travelled over practically all the
stock routes of the State. While
engaged in this calling he was
successful in maintaining a flock of

12,000 sheep, which during the
devastating drought of 1900-3
he travelled from “Maxwellton”
Station, near Hughenden, to Nor-
manton, in order to secure grass and
droving for many owners until the
year 1905, previous to which,
towards the end of 1904, he selected
a block of land to which he gave the
name of ‘‘Acacia Downs.” This
block, which embraces 44,000 acres
of country, was formerly a part of
the well-known “Bowen Downs”
holding, which had been resumed
with a view to closer settlement
and to-day “Acacia Downs” is one of
the best-known properties in regard
to its improvements in the Central
West. In 1911 he purchased, in
conjunction with his brother Eric, a
share in “Huntley” Station from
Messrs. Milson Bros., of North
Sydney, New South Wales, this
property up to that time having been
held by them in partnership with
Mr Eric H. Mackay, who, with his
nephew, continued to retain his
interest as part owner. Subsequently,
the subject of our notice became a
partner with his uncle in the owner-
ship of “Alpha” Station, in 1913,
having purchased the interest
formerly held by Mr. Charles Rolfe,
now living in retirement in England.
Since the year 1916 he has still
further enlarged the sphere of his
pastoral operations with his brother
James, acquiring other landed
interests in the vicinity of “Alpha,”
so that, at time of writing he per-
sonally owns about 30,000 acres in
that district in addition to the
44,000 acres comprising “Acacia
Downs,” while in partnership with
other members of his family he is
interested in some 240,000 acres of
pastoral territory in Queensland. His
personal energies are centred in
“Acacia Downs,” where, as pre-
viously mentioned, he has completed
a considerable amount of develop-
mental work. The run is divided into
fifteen paddocks of varying sizes, the
largest of which contains but 3,700
water, remaining for several months
in the far north tending the welfare
of the flock, which would un-
doubtedly have perished in less

advent, has been sunk a further 600
feet, the result being a daily flow of
340,000 gallons of good water, which
is conveyed through several paddocks
by means of drains, over 30 miles of
which have been excavated. The
nature of the country comprising
“Acacia Downs” is indicated by
plains well covered with Mitchell
grass, while patches of blue grass are
also in evidence. Light growths of
timber are noticeable on the run,
whitewood prevailing in proximity
to the creek which intersects the
property, while coolibah flourishes in
the vicinity of the gullies. Sheep
form the mainstay of the station, the
flock having been founded on “Col-
laroy” blood and the strain improved
by the introduction of rams imported
from the “Anama” stud, South Aus-
tralia. An important and interesting
phase of the pastoral operations
carried out on “Acacia Downs” is
embodied in a stud herd of Norfolk
poll cattle, which the owner makes
his special care and with which he
has been particularly successful, the
stud having been founded on stock
purchased from Mr. Philip Charley,
of New South Wales. Mr. Temple-
ton also devotes considerable atten-
tion to horse-breeding, his pro-
animals to the home property, these
being the first importations of their

the late John Francis Gottwaltz,
of that place. He is descended
from a family which first settled

in England during the reign of
one of the early Georges, and his
progenitors subsequently became
numbered among the landed proprie-
tors of Great Britain, their estates
being situated at Culworth, North
Devon. Many noble and distin-
guished names appear in the records
of the family and its collateral
branches, Mr. George F. Gottwaltz’s
grandfather having been vicar of
Coton, Warwickshire, and a connec-
tion existing with the houses of the
Duke of St. Albans, Grimston of
Grimston, the Earl of Verulam, and
the Earls of Radnor and Har-
borough. The subject of this memoir
received his education at Eastbourne
College, and in 1877, at the age of
17 years, having completed his
scholastic training, and being a
younger son, he decided to try his
fortune under the sunny skies of
Australia, the entailed estates of the
family falling to his elder brother,
who remained in the Old Country.
His choice of a destination fell upon
Queensland, and upon arrival at
Moreton Bay his first thought
naturally was how best to obtain the
“colonial experience” necessary to
equip him for the struggle upon
which he had embarked. A fellow-
passenger on the boat by which Mr.
Gottwaltz had travelled was the
owner of a sugar plantation, and he
offered the newcomer a position at a
salary of £lOO per annum, which at
that period was considered excellent
pay for a “new chum.” Taking this
as a first step towards the attain-
ment of the all-round knowledge
with which he desired to equip him-
self as a means of getting into touch
with the most profitable channels of
enterprise in the country which he
had chosen as the scene of his youth-
ful endeavours, he applied himself
to the work of cane-growing, and
continued on the plantation for
about 12 months. Having mastered
the details connected with the rais-
ing of sugar-cane, he decided to
enter another field of industry, and
in 1879 proceeded to “Wagoo” Sta-
tion, on the Maranoa River, under
the same proprietorship, and here
he spent two years in the capacity of
jackaroo, gaining practical experi-
ence in the breeding of cattle and in
the handling of different classes of
stock. At the latter end of 1880,
having obtained a good insight into
the operations of a cattle proposi-
tion, he abandoned the life of a
jackaroo and undertook, on behalf
of Dr. May, of Bundaberg, the work
of opening up a sugar plantation on
I lie “Kalbar” Estate. The country
was in its virgin state when it first
came into the controlling hands of
Mr. Gottwaltz, whose initial business
was to fell the standing scrub which
covered the area required for the
future cane plantation. He had at
his command a number of young

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND: ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Queensland at that period was still
in a very primitive state, the facilities
for crushing the cane being very
inadequate and involving a great
deal of waste, while the sugar mills
of the present day, which have so
completely revolutionized the indus-
try, were then but a dream of the
future. Despite these drawbacks,
however, Mr. Gottwaltz was success-
ful in establishing the enterprize on
a satisfactory basis, and having ac-
complished his aim he relinquished
the management of the plantation
and sailed for England on a visit to
his relatives. In 1885 he returned
to the country of his adoption, and
in the following year started on
of financial loss to Mr. Gottwaltz.
With the object of retrieving his
financial position, during the next
few years Mr. Gottwaltz devoted his
attention to various speculations,
among which were included some
contracts in connection with the
Gladstone railway line, and having
successfully established himself once
again from a pecuniary standpoint,
in 1896 he found himself free to
return to the life which he preferred,
and with the intention of once more
starting a grazing property he ac-
quired from the Honourable A. J.
Thynne the estate known as “Wal-
lila,” a fine tract of country, con-
sisting of 9,000 acres, and with
the first year had 5,000 acres rung,
at an average cost of Is. per acre,
and about 13 miles of fencing erected
at about £2B per mile. This amount
of fencing has since been doubled,
the system varying between barbed
and plain wires, which in some places
are both used. Some very good
Shorthorns were included among the
herd of 500 head of mixed cattle
with which the run was stocked at
the time of purchase, and which
were taken over by Mr. Gottwaltz as
part of the bargain. In 1895 the
dreaded tick pest had made its ap-
pearance in the northern areas of the
State, and many of the best herds
were completely decimated by its
independent lines purchasing a
stretch of grazing land on the Kolan
River, where he carried on operations
on his own account for about four
years. The varied experiences of
the Queensland pastoralist attended
his exertions, and he became fami-
liarized with both scorching drought
and devastating flood, only two
years after the inception of his ven-
ture a tremendous flood, which oc-
curred in the year 1887, sweeping
away all his maize crops and a good
deal of other valuable property.
Partly as a result of this heart-
breaking experience he decided to dis-
pose of his grazing farm, and in 1889
a purchaser was found, the trans-
action, however, involving a good deal

many advantages for pastoral pur-
poses. At the time of its purchase
by Mr. Gottwaltz practically no im-
provements had been made on “Wal-
lila” beyond the erection of a home-
stead and the fencing necessary to
enclose a few paddocks, so that the
building up of the venture from its
very foundation had to be faced by
the new owner. This, however, only
proved an incentive to him, and
being thoroughly familiar with the
methods of procedure necessary he
at once set to work to make his
boundaries secure with substantial
fences, to complete the work of sub-
division, and to arrange for the ring-
barking of the timber. This work
he let out on contract, and during
ravages. In order, therefore, to
anticipate its advent, should it work
its way to the south, and effectively
to ward off the fatal effects of such
a visitation, Mr. Gottwaltz erected a
dip on his property, and having a
few months previously successfully
inoculated his stock against red-
water, in 1899, when the tick ap-
peared, he immediately dipped the
cattle, and as a result of this fore-
sight his losses were particularly
small, only about 5 per cent, of the
herd succumbing to the pest. The
big drought of 1902-1903, which
wrought havoc over the greater part
of Queensland and proved the ruin
of farmers and pastoralists all over
the country, found Mr. Gottwaltz to

to rise until about the close of 1913,
since when they have continued


steadily to ascend until 1920. In
1904 and 1907 cattle were scarcely
saleable, and Mr. Gottwaltz, in com-
mon with the other pastoralists, felt
the strain of the position. He, how-
ever, did not lose his confidence in
the ultimate restoration of normal
conditions, and he has since reaped
his reward. The “Wallila” home-
stead is a fine old building, designed
on the bungalow principle, with a
deep old-fashioned verandah running
all along the front of the house, the
welcome shade of which is increased
during the summer months by a
leafy screen of climbing vines which
cover its entire length. In 1906 Mr.
Gottwaltz, with the intention of ex-
tending his operations, acquired an
value in the Powlathanga lake,
which is about four miles in circum-
ference ; and it is worthy of men-
tion that about the month of April
a magnificent spectacle is presented
by the water-lilies, the bluey-white
blossoms of which appear in massed
beauty on the clear surface of the
whole of the lower end of the lake.
There are also several lagoons and
springs, from which good water is
obtained, and in the back country
these are augmented by wells, water
being easily secured on most parts
of the run at depths varying from
30 ft. to 70 ft. There is a certain
amount of timber left from the raids
of the ringbarkers, and this consists
chiefly of box, ironbark, bloodwood,
touch with the course of events on
that property. Mr. Gottwaltz takes
considerable interest in the public
life of the community, and for a
couple of decades occupied a seat on
the Kolan Shire Council, being first
appointed in 1897 and retiring in
1914, and during the years 1903 and
1912 he served as chairman of the
Council. He is a Justice of the
Peace, having been appointed to the
Commission by the Philp Adminis-
tration. He is socially popular, and
is well known throughout the dis-
trict, and even far beyond its
bounds, as a genial and hospitable
host. He is fond of sport, and as a
lad at Eastbourne College took part
in many well-fought cricket and
estate at Rosedale, consisting of
about 12,000 acres of improved pas-
toral country, which he utilized for
his own purposes for a few years and
in 1913 disposed of it to Mr. Carige.
At this time he transferred his acti-
vities to "Powlathanga,” near
Charters Towers, a grazing run,
covering about 100 square miles of
well-grassed territory, where a con-
siderable amount of development
work had been accomplished, and
having arranged for the purchase of
this desirable acquisition he com-
menced active operations thereon
without delay. The property, which
was both fenced and ringbarked be-
fore Mr. Gottwaltz took possession,

affording plenty of shelter for the
stock. The climate is salubrious, the
country being about 1,000 feet above
sea-level, and cattle thrive well in
the locality, the estate carrying from
3,000 to 4,000 head. These consist
mainly of Shorthorns, this breed
being favoured by Mr. Gottwaltz for
‘‘Powlathanga” on account of his
conviction, based on experience, that
the type is best suited to a dry cli-
mate. The station is at present
under the management of Mr. Gott-
waltz’s second son, who reaps the
advantage of the personal super-
vision of his father, the latter mak-
ing periodical visits to “Powla-
thanga,” and so keeping himself in
football matches, while since his con-
nection with Queensland began his
sporting instincts have found vent in
shooting and fishing. Mr. Gottwaltz
married in 1882 Elizabeth, daughter
of the late Thomas Lloyd Jones, a
gentleman of English birth. He
had been in the Life Guards and
came to Queensland in 1863, went
to Gympie, where he was interested
in ‘‘Jones” mine, which was called
after him, and returned to England
in 1875. Of a family of six sons and
five daughters all but one son sur-

period dating centuries back, his
progenitors have lived and died as
farmers and agricultural land-
owners. From existing records it is
shown that members on the distaff
side of the house to which the late
gentleman owes his descent, have
been citizens of Peebles for genera-
tions extending beyond the romantic
times of the Stuarts. One of these
records sets forth that during the
Jacobite rebellion of 1745, the
maternal great-great-grandfather of
the gentleman under review—the
Mackintosh of Borland —fought
with great valour under the banner
of Prince Charles Edward Stuart.
Mr. R. E. Jackson was educated at
Bonninton Park Academy in Peebles.
While yet in his teens he was keenly
desirous of visiting Australia,
prompted by accounts of the country
received from the late Robert Henry
Riddell—a son of the Reverend
Henry Scott-Riddell, poet and
cleric, and a relative of his mother’s
—who was a votary of mining in the
stirring days which witnessed the
rapid unfolding of early Australian
history through the medium of the
great gold industry, and later became

the now historical Queensland
property known as “Langlo Downs,”

Before reaching hia seventeenth year
Mr. Jackson bade farewell to his
Alma Mater and immediately set
out to join this gentleman, who was

initiated into the duties of a jackaroo

training being spread over the period
of severe drought which started in

1883, which, though involving a
strenuous time for all engaged in
pastoral work, afforded him invalu-
able experience of the industry
under conditions which only occur,
fortunately, at periods separated by
wide intervals; and this experience
stood him in good stead in later years
when engaged in landed enterprise
on his own account. In 1887, the
year following the break-up of the
drought, Mr. Riddell died, and was
succeeded in the management of
“Langlo Downs” by the late Thomas
G. Millar, under whose regime Mr.
Jackson filled the position of overseer,
which he retained during the follow-
ing decade. At the termination of
that period he joined forces with Mr.
Millar in the purchase of a property
situated in the Finders watershed,
known as “Vernon Downs,” and
now owned by Mr. W. H.
Carter. Here again he was faced
by the problems incidental to a
succession of abnormal seasons, as
about three years after their acquire-
ment of this station, the partners
were overtaken by the 1900-4
drought, the worst visitation of its
kind experienced in the history of
Queensland. Despite every effort to
save the bulk of their stock, they, in
common with the majority of
Queensland graziers lost heavily as
the effect of this scourge, though
they subsequently retrieved much of
their losses with the recurrence of
good seasons and by reason of the
marvellously recuperative powers of
the country. They held “Vernon
Downs” for ten years, disposing of

it in 1907, when, being rendered free
from pressing cares, Mr. Jackson
took advantage of the opportunity
to revisit his native land and renew
the associations of his boyhood days.
He spent about a year in the old
world and returned to his adopted
country in 1908, when, in conjunc-
tion with the partner of his earlier


venture, he purchased a freehold
dairy and grazing farm of some
1,500 acres lying about twenty miles
from Brisbane. This property, which
was named “The Highland's,” was
conducted by Messrs. Jackson and
Millar for two years, under the
management of the former gentle-
man. Finding the scope of ojDerations
too narrow and the life uncongenial
after handling for half a lifetime the
larger issues connected with the
proprietorship and management of
a sheep station, he suggested its
disposal with the view of again
embarking upon pastoral enterprise.
“The Highlands” was accordingly

sold, and, with the object of
procuring good grazing country, Mr.
Jackson proceeded to North-western
Queensland, and while at Winton iu
1910, purchased “Apsley” Station
from Mr. Chas. Blum© in conjunction
with Mr. Millar and Mr. R. L. W.
Johnstone, who, at time of
writing manages “Oondooroo”
Station. Shortly after concluding
the transaction connected with the
purchase of “Apsley,” Mr. Jackson
entered into possession and has since
been occupied with the duties of
managing partner. Formerly a
portion of “Vindex”—one of the
oldest station properties in Western
Queensland—and the particular
block upon which the first owners,
Messrs. Scott and Gordon, chose a

Mr. Blume named the area “Apsley”

yet to be seen on the run, recalling
vividly realistic descriptions of
pioneering existence in those far


back days, when indescribable
hardships, privations, and perils
were faced and surmounted with a
courage passing description by the
founders of nationhood in Australia.
“Apsley” embraces 65,000 acres of
lolling downs interspersed with a
light growth of timber, which
provides shelter for the stock, the
principal being whitewood and
supple-jack. The nature of the soil
proves extremely favourable to the
growth of Mitchell and Flinders
grasses, with which the area is
luxuriantly clothed, while it is
favourably endowed also with natural
water courses, as, in addition to the
Western River, to which it has a
“Vindex,” and when that station
depended altogether on surface
water for its supplies. The “Apsley”
flock is depastured in eleven
paddocks, into which the run is
divided, the object of the manage-
ment being to expedite and facilitate
the handling of the stock, which
has been effectively realized. One
hundred miles of fencing of the most
modern description has been com-
pleted on the boundary and sub-
divisional paddocks, while the
utility buildings are solidly
constructed and up-to-date in design.
The homestead is a modern well-
built structure, which was originally
erected in Charters Towers under the
natural beauty of the surroundings,
Practically throughout his whole pas-
toral career Mr. Jackson has keenly
interested himself in the public
affairs of the districts in which the
lines of his life have been cast. Since
the year 1911 he has been a member
of the Winton Shire Council, while
at time of writing he occupies
a seat on the Gregory Marsupial
Board. During the Great War
(1914-18) his practical efforts did
much to forward the noble cause of
patriotism, while the claims of
charity have ever called from him
an equally ready response. In
matters of sport he is also to the
fore, assisting the cause of clean
five mile frontage, Oondooroo and
Scott’s Creeks meander through the
property, the former providing a
frontage of about five miles,
Evidences of the high stage of
development to which “Apsley” has
been brought are everywhere
apparent, the improvements includ-
ing seven sub-artesian bores, which
not only supplement the natural
water supply, but are in themselves
capable of amply providing the run
with water in all seasons. In
addition to the sources already
mentioned, there are on “Apsley”
four large surface tanks, which wore
constructed at a period when the
property was still a part of

direction of a former owner. While
it was in course of reconstruction at
“Apsley,” Mr. Jackson added
considerable additions and improve-
ments, with the result that the
dwelling now embodies all those
comforts and conveniences that add
so materially to the charm of home
life in the back country. It is
furnished with wide verandahs
which have been rendered fly-proof,
and the rooms are large, airy, and
well ventilated. As the home is
approached the graceful foliage of
pepperina trees first comes into view,
and these, with which the dwelling
is surrounded, prove useful for shade
purposes as well as adding to the
racing in the pursuance of his
functions as honorary steward and
committeeman of the North Gregory
Amateur Racing Club. He married
in the year 1913, Kathleen Margaret,
daughter of the late John Eustace,
who, a son of an Irish Protestant-
family, hailed from his native Isle
nearly half a century ago, becoming
well known in manufacturing and
commercial circles in Milchester and
Charters Tower's in the days when
these centres were yet infant

family of three daughters, who are
named respectively, Jessie Margaret,
Kathleen Mary (Molly), and

to the impossibility of making any

operated northward and westward of

marked by the hardships and almost
insurmountable objects incidental to
a carrier’s life in the days when
freedom and romance went hand in
hand with sorrow, sacrifice, and even
tragedy, the common routine of his
life as bread-winner for a growing
family involving many dangers and
oft-times imminent peril. On one
occasion, while on the roads with his

son, then only a child, he was caught

worthy of emulation by the descend-

brought ruin to so many pastoralists
throughout the Commonwealth, Mr.
Cochran being enabled to save about
half his stock, however, by feeding
them on scrub fodder. On the con-
clusion of the drought he was com-
pelled to sell his remaining sheep in
order to provide himself with suffi-
cient capital to purchase a few ewes
for breeding purposes, the demand
for which was excessive owing to the
tremendous depletion which the
industry had so recently suffered.
Depasturing his acres with these he
began another uphill fight against
the adverse conditions which so
thickly bestrew the settler’s path,
his prospects assuming a decidedly
brighter aspect after a few years had

industry and determination he
devoted himself to the development
of this proposition, accomplishing
much in the way of improvements,
but owing to the difficulty of coping
with the depredations of native dogs
and the prickly pear and other pests,
he disposed of the land after working
it for three years, having in the
meantime acquired a block of
country in the Mitchell district. He
set out for his newly-acquired hold-
ing, which he named "Bengal,” in
the year 1910, overlanding with his
own teams, being assisted by his
eldest son George. "Bengal,” which
is situated 92 miles from Longreach,
was originally a portion of
“Kensington Downs” Station, and
consists of some 27,000 acres of good
grazing country, to the development
of which the owner has given his
whole time, personally supervising
and assisting in the work of fencing,
dam sinking, etc. In the face of the
many hardships attendant upon
forming a home in the backblocks,
which in Mr. Cochrane’s case included
the extra cost and difficulty of
transport in getting his wool to
market and procuring the necessary
requirements for station use owing to
the distance from the nearest railway
centre, he has made good, and
attributes no small share of his
ultimate success to the practical sup-
port of his wife and later to the
assistance rendered by his sons now
grown to manhood. “Bengal” is
highly improved in regard to pad-
docking and its artificial water
supply, the latter being supplied by
five sub-artesian bores and a dam,
which, supplementing the natural
sources, amply provide for the needs
of the stock during the whole year
round. The flock is composed of
merinos, having been built up from
a foundation of “Vindex” and
“Green Hills” ewes and rams pro-
cured from well-known and approved
local stock, the wool grown being of
a satisfactory quality and productive

of good prices both at the ordinary
wool sales and later under the system
of Commonwealth control initiated
as the outcome of the Great War of
1914-18. The homestead, which was
erected by Mr. Cochran in the year
1910, has been enlarged as circum-
stances required and is a comfortable
and cosy dwelling, the conditions of
the climate having been taken into
consideration in its design and con-
struction, while the detached build-
ings in its vicinity tend to give it the
appearance of an old-time pastoral
residence. Mr. Cochran married in
the year 1888 Winifred, daughter of
the late Michael O’Grady, whose
forbears played their part in the
making of Irish history, the name
being one that is revered and
respected throughout the Isle of
“Saints and scholars.” Mr. O’Grady
hailed from County Clare in 1858
and was a prominent figure in com-
mercial circles in Sydney. New South
Wales, where his death occurred in
the year 1886. Mr. Cochran has a
surviving family of three sons and
two daughters. The former, who
were educated at the Christian
Brothers’ Colleges at Charters Towers
and Toowoomba, assist their father
in the administration of “Bengal.”
One of Mr. Cochran’s daughters is
the wife of Mr. Claver T. Kelly, a
pastoral manager of Central Queens-
land. The late James Cochran,
eldest brother of our subject, was for
many years, and up to the time of
his death, engaged in pastoral pur-
suits in the Walgett district of New
South Wales.

THOMAS McMASTER, J.P.,
“Kelso,” Ilfracombe, was born at
Bellarine, near Geelong, Victoria,
on July 31, 1863. He is the second
son of the late William McMaster, a
MR. THOMAS MCMASTER.
native of Wigtonshire, Scotland,
who came to Victoria in the early
fifties, having been amongst the
earliest of the free settlers hailing
from the Old World to that State.
The late gentleman came of agrarian
stock, his forbears having followed
farming avocations in Wigtonshire
for many generations, in which
county they ranked as highly-
esteemed citizens. On arrival in the
land of his adoption the late
William McMaster naturally di-
rected his attention to the calling
to which he was born, as the basis
of obtaining a livelihood, and
secured a position on a farm in
Victoria in order to gain experience
of the industry under conditions
which were naturally unfamiliar to
him at that time. Ultimately he
became proprietor of this farm,
which he purchased in the year 1858,
conducting operations thereon for
the following six years. In 1864 he
journeyed to Queensland, obtaining
a post in the employ of Mr. P.
F. McDonald, the well-known pas-
toralist, now living in retirement
at Rockhampton. Being much
impressed with its future possibilities
he decided to throw in his lot with
the great north-east of the Island
Continent and remained in charge of
a team owned by Mr. McDonald,
being employed in carrying supplies
to that gentleman’s stations in the
Springsure district for a number of
years. However, when the mining
industry sprang into prominence in
the Port Curtis district he was one
of the earliest on the field, following
the lure of Dame Fortune with con-
siderable success, his energy in this
sphere of action being rewarded by
the wherewithal to provide for his
wife and family of seven children
with comfort. He followed the
mining industry until his death,
which occurred in the year 1884 as
a result of an accident which
happened while in discharge of his
duties as manager of the “Welcome”
Mine at Morinish, near Rockhamp-
ton, having accomplished during his
career in that calling much that
tended to the advancement of the
MR. W. J. MCMASTER.
State through .his share in the
development of one of its principal
industries. His wife still lives in
Rockhampton, and in the autumn
of her days may rest content with
the knowledge of a usefully spent
life, not realizing that perhaps that
in the performance of what to her
was a simple matter of love and duty
she, like so many of our pioneering
women, has rendered inestimable
service to the land of her adoption,
fulfilling a worthy woman’s share in
settling the greater Empire abroad.
Her family of five sons and two
daughters have every reason to
venerate the perseverance, courage,
and devotion to duty which formed
so large a part in the personality of
both their parents. Mr. Thomas
McMaster, the second son of the
pioneer, whose career we have
briefly described, was educated in
Queensland, chiefly at the hands of
his father, the late gentleman and
his children sacrificing much of their
leisure in order to attain the accom-
plishment of the latter’s education,
which was necessarily largely rele-
gated to the evening time owing to
the strenuous demands made on each
member of the family in the
ordinary routine of the day’s work.
The gentleman under review was
occupied with a man’s work when in
his early teens, and even when but a
lad of ten summers had the handling
of a horse in the performance of his
share of the work connected with his
father’s mining operations, becoming
more useful as time progressed and
continuing with his parent until the
latter’s decease, after which event
the interests of the other members
of the family remained united. But
in the year 1891 Mr. Thomas
McMaster came West to the district
outlying Longreach and took up in
conjunction with his brothers the
block on which his present home-
stead is situated. The property,
which embraced 20,000 acres of
country, was called “Kelso,” after
the town of that name in the land of
his father’s birth. He entered with
a will and a capacity for hard work
upon the development and improve-
ment of this holding to which he
MR. T. G. MCMASTER.
devoted his earnest and undivided
attention, and on which he soon had
the happiness of seeing the fructify-
ing results of his labours. Subse-
quently he purchased his partners’


shares in the proposition and thence-
forward conducted it on his own
account, adding to the area of his
landed estate in the year 1913 by
the purchase of “The Springs,” a
pastoral lease of 100 square miles in
the Jericho district. He manages
aggregate number usually carried
being from eighteen to twenty
thousand head. The flocks were
founded on “Wanganella” blood, the
strain being improved annually by
the introduction of “Deniliquin
Park” stud rams, the results
indicated chiefly by Mitchell grass
downs which are lightly timbered
with boree and gidya —these plants
being highly valued for shade pur-
poses —while the acreage composing
“The Springs” bears a heavy growth
of timber of several varieties, briga-

both properties from “Kelso,” and
has since formed his interests into a
limited company in which only the
members of his family are concerned.
The area embraced by the two
properties consists of 84,000 acres,
which are devoted to sheep, the
attained in this direction proving
highly satisfactory, and exemplify-
ing the wisdom of the methods
employed by Mr. McMaster. In
character the properties are dis-
similar, the nature of the country
comprising “Kelso” run being
low and wilga being the predominat-
ing species. The improvements on
both properties are of the most
up-to-date description, over 100
miles of fencing having been erected
in the subdivision of the runs into
suitably sized paddocks, these being


amply supplied with the necessary
water for the stock by the output
of sub-artesian bores and by dams.
Quite in keeping with the general
tone of modern development are the

outhouses and offices on the two
properties. The homestead on
“Kelso” is a comfortable structure
built on up-to-date lines and is in
every way a suitable pastoral home;
that on “The Springs” having
been erected during the year
1918. Mr. McMaster has always
been prominently identified with the
public work of the district wherein

lie lias made his home, and for the
past fifteen years he has been closely
associated with the communal life of
Ilfracombe, having been a member
of the Ilfracombe Shire Council
during the whole of that period and
for several years its chairman, and
he has also represented the Shires on
various occasions at the Local
Authorities’ Conferences which are
annually held in the Queensland
metropolis. It may be truly said
that there is hardly a movement set
afoot in the district in which he
does not take a part. He is a share-
holder and chairman of directors of
the Longreach Motor Co., Ltd.,
having been one of the promoters of
that company. He serves on the
district committee of the Pastoral
Employers’ Association and is also a
committeeman of the Pastoral and
Agricultural Society. He married
in the year 1890 Elizabeth, daughter
of the late John Edgar, of Dumfries,
Scotland, a descendant of an old
Scottish family of that town, to
which he returned prior to his death,
which occurred in the year 1912. Of
the union there is a surviving family
of two sons and two daughters.
Though rendering material assist-
ance to their father in the adminis-
tration of the family properties the
former are yet in their teens. The
McMaster family was represented at
the firing line during the great
struggle which has so recent!}
terminated in victory for the
Allied Nations by the two brothers
of the gentleman under review,
Messrs. George and Fergus McMas-
ter. Though both gentlemen were
married they deemed it their duty
to place their services at their
country’s disposal and fought in the
cause of justice and humanity in
Europe. The elder of the two,
George, laid down his life for his
country in France, while the
younger brother, Fergus, was at the
war theatre to the end of hostilities.
Though the prospects of both these
sons of Australia were sufficiently
fair to have tempted natures of less
loyal fibre to turn from the clash of
arms they were moved to action by
reasons similar to those which
prevailed with the myriads of the
Empire’s sons who flocked to the
defence of the Motherland and her
Allies. Messrs George and Fergus
McMaster were members of the old
firm of Messrs. McMaster Bros.,
founded after the death of their late
father in the year 1884.

SYDNEY HAROLD FRASER,
J.P., “Rankin,” Aramac, was born
at Roma, Queensland, on June 25,
1877, and is the only surviving son
of Mr. Sydney Peachey Fraser, a
MR. S. H. ERASER.
pioneer of Central Queensland and
one of the oldest pastoral managers
of that part of the State. Mr. S.
H. Fraser was educated at the Rock-
hampton Grammar School, complet-
ing his scholastic studies at the age of
seventeen, when he joined his father
on “Bowen Downs” Station. Here,
in the capacity of jackaroo, he was
identified with the workings of the
pastoral industry under his father’s
supervision and remained on the
estate for a period of two years,
receiving a good grounding in all
matters relating to stock. In the
year 1896, while yet in his teens, he
was offered and accepted the over-
seership of “Talgai West” on the
Darling Downs, a property then
under the same proprietorship as
“Bowen Downs.” He carried out the
duties incidental to the position for
nearly three years, resigning in 1899
and returning to the Central West
in order to occupy a similar post on
“Caledonia” Station on behalf of the
firm of John Cameron & Co.
Subsequently he became manager of
“Meteor Downs,” a pastoral property
in the Springsure district, of which
he took control in the year 1902,
continuing his managerial duties for
three months, when the management
was taken over by the owner in
consequence of the disastrous
drought of the period. Thence-
forward he was occupied with a
variety of pastoral avocations,
including droving, the overseership
of wool sheds, the handling of
horses, etc., until the beginning of
1904 when he accepted the manage-
ment of “Barcoorah” Station for the
executors of the Tozer Estate,
retaining the post until the property
was taken over by Mr. Edmund
Jowett. Mr. Fraser was then
appointed by Mr. Jowett to the
overseership of “Mount Marlow”
Station, where he remained until
transferred to the management and
administration of “Manningham,” a
station newly formed at that time
by the owner of “Mount Marlow.”
Subsequently, in April, 1909, he
took up a block of 28,000 acres of
country in the vicinity of Aramac,
on which he bestowed the name of
“Rankin,” this land being formerly
a portion of “Bowen Downs” and
situated at the junction of the Downs
and the so-called “desert” country.
Good natural grasses abound on the
pastures of “Rankin,” which also
produce a plentiful growth of top-
feed which has proved its value as
fodder in dry seasons. Originally

he used the area for sheep-breeding,
hut meeting with little success in this
department of the industry he
directed his efforts to the production
of wool, to which the property is
now chiefly devoted. It is well
developed, the improvements includ-
ing a bore which affords a good
supplemental supply to the water
provided by several natural springs
and a creek which flows through the
run. The homestead, which was
erected in 1912, is a modern
structure, having been designed in
accordance with the most approved
ideas for coping with the adverse
conditions of the western summers,
Mr. Fraser has identified himself
with the public life of the district,
having been appointed to the Corn-
mission of the Peace in the year
1916 and elected to the Board of the
Aramac Shire Council in 1918, being
also a member of the Marsupial
Board. He is prominent too in all
movements of a charitable nature
and is on the committee of the
Aramac Hospital. He is a member
of the Western Executive of the
United Pastoralists’ and Grazing
Farmers’ Association and occupies
the chair of the Aramac District
Committee of that society. A keen
lover of the national sport for its
own sake, his name is included in
the membership roll of the Rock-
hampton Jockey Club and many of
the racing bodies of the Central West,
and he usually runs a horse or two
at local amateur meetings. Mr.
Fraser is a member of the Rock-
hampton and Barcaldine Clubs. In
1920 he married Edna, daughter of
Mr. C. E. Rosser, manager of the
Queensland National Bank, Yangan,
near Warwick.


GEORGE SKENE, J.P., “Beres-
ford” Station, Clermont, was born
at Dunedin, New Zealand, on July
12, 1874, and is a son of the late
George Skene, who, hailing origin-
ally from Aberdeen, Scotland, spent
MR. G. SKENE, SEN.
many years in the Dominion and
subsequently in Australia, where, in
the seventies, he became one of the
pioneers of the pastoral industry in
the far north-east of the continent.
Commercial pursuits occupied the
late gentleman during his long
sojourn in New Zealand, and he was
particularly well known in Dunedin
as one of the successful merchants of
that city. The line from which he
was descended has extended in the
counties vicinal to Aberdeen for
centuries, and, from a period dating
many generations back, has been
notably identified with primary pro-
duction on the land. Parting with
his interests in New Zealand in the
year 1874, the late George Skene
arrived in Australia with a capital
of =£20,000, and with the view of
investing in the pastoral industry
joined his brother-in-law, George
Henderson, also a native of Scot-
land, in partnership. Messrs. Hen-
derson and Skene’s first venture was
“Wrotham Park,” in the Chillagoe
district, which they took up and
stocked in the middle seventies, and
where their pioneering work was
carried on in the face of great hard-
ships, disappointments, and setbacks,
before being finally rewarded with
the success it merited. “Havilah,”
on the Bowen River, was also one
of their early acquirements, and
they brought both properties from
virgin country to that state of
development which caused them,
when subsequently sold, to rank
among the best developed and most
progressive runs of the times. They
entered into possession of “Wrotham
Park” at a time when the wild
blacks were a menace in the district
and the handling of stock was
attended with very serious danger to
life, many a lonely rider—often a
white man and still oftener a friendly
native trained to stock work—being
dismounted by a spear from an
unseen enemy. Cattle killing was
wantonly indulged in by these un-
tutored children of the wilds, and
the prevention as far as possible of
their depredations was largely a part
of pioneer existence at that time.
MR. G. SKENE.
Low prices, and sometimes lack of a
market for their stock, were among
the adverse conditions which the
founder of the Skene family and his
partner were obliged to face in the
early days. On one occasion, after
the sale of 600 fats, delivered from
their station to the Mareeba Meat-
works, they received 7s. 6d. per head
for the mob, a price which proved
insufficient even for the defrayment
of expenses. “Wrotham Park” and
“Havilah” were amongst the first
Queensland stations to be affected
with the tick fever scourge which
wrought so much havoc before
being effectively coped with by
inoculatory measures, reducing the
herd of the former run in the year
1896 from 27,000 to 9,000 —a
loss of 18,000. However, such
and many equally disheartening
vicissitudes, were overcome in a
spirit which commands, as it will
command of generations yet to come,
the deepest admiration. Their enter-
prise found considerable scope in
Bowen and the outlying district, and
the meatworks situated in that his-
torical and naturally favoured centre
were established as the result of their
efforts. In 1901, after twenty-seven
years’ active association with the
industry, Mr. Skene retired to Mel-
bourne, where, shortly, his upright
career closed, he being at the time
of his death at the age of sixty-six.
“Havilah” was sold in 1902, and in
1906 when the estate was wound up
“Wrotham Park” was also disposed
of. The wife of the late pioneer was
of Irish birth and a member of the
well-known Mclnernly family, which
is one of the most honoured and
famed in the history of their native
land, and which contributed many
professional men to Victoria. Two
sons and two daughters were born
to him, Mr. Skene of “Beresford”
Station being now the only surviving
son. Educated at St. Patrick’s
College, Goulburn, and Cooerwull
Academy, near Lithgow, Mr. George
Skene entered the pastoral industry
as a jackaroo under his father at
“Havilah” in the year 1891. Later
he was given sole management of

that property and retained control
until its sale in 1902. Afterwards
he spent some time with his cousin
at “Wrotham Park,” of which he
also assumed the management. On
the sale of this property he joined


Mr. William IT. Bell of “Strathdee”
Station in the purchase of “Beres-
ford,” an unstocked area in the

vicinity of Clermont. Towards the
end of 1908, after depasturing the
run, a work in which his keen know-
ledge of pastoral conditions and of
which class of stock would prove most
adaptable to the country proved its
value, he entered upon the manage-
ment of “Beresford,” which has
since occupied his chief energies.
Though historically an old property,
the holding was almost wholly lack-
ing in development and improve-
ments on coming under his control,
a state of things which he imme-
diately set himself to remedy. A
bore and a number of dams now
supplement the water supplies
naturally conserved in several holes
in the bed of Mistake Creek, to which
the property has an eight mile
frontage. “Beresford” covers 320
square miles, having been a much
larger area before coming under the

cattle, which are marketable from
“Beresford,” are in ready demand at
the meatworks owing to their quality
and even weight. At time of writing
the horned stock comprise about
5,000 head, but the country is capable
of carrying over 7,500, the former
herd having been considerably
depleted by the drought of 1915.
The dwelling is of old standing, hav-
ing been built by the original owner
of the property in the early eighties.
It still does service as a comfortable
home, though Mr. Skene intends
erecting a more modern residence in
the future, and one that will do
justice to the charming surroundings
which are a feature of the place. He
is a deep reader and thinker and
keeps in touch with the trend of
latter day events, while keenly
interesting himself in all local move-
ments instituted for the advance-
ment of the district in which the
lines of his life are cast. For some
years he has exercised his duties as
a Justice of the Peace. In the year
1904 he married Katherine, daughter
of the late Archibald Ferguson, who
was one of the early pioneers of
Queensland. The late gentleman
hailed from Glasgow, Scotland, in
company with his father, in the late
twenties, being at that time only a
child. He made his advent to
Queensland immediately after leav-
ing school, and is recorded as the
founder and sometime owner of
“Walloon” Station in the Burnett
district. In the early seventies he
took up “Byerwen,” one of the first
pastoral properties to be formed in
the district outlying the town of
Bowen and now owned by his son,
this holding having been held by the
family for over half a century. Mr.
Archibald Ferguson is remembered
by his compatriots in Queensland as
a man ever ready with generous
support whenever and wherever
needed, and as one of the best known
and most popular pastoralists of the
State. Mr. and Mrs. George Skene
have a family of one son, Archibald
George Francis, who was born on
March 4, 1913, and two daughters.

year 1895 a spirit of enterprise
prompted him to launch out in a new

teams to that centre with the

“Clanbah.” Mr. Nicol died in the
year 1915, before the completion of
his fifty-third year, his comparatively
early end being hastened no doubt as
the result of the hardships and
sacrifices which formed so large a
part of his pioneering existence. He
was distinguished by many fine
characteristics, the generosity of his
disposition urging him to freely
render such assistance as was in his
power whenever or wherever his help
was needed, and earning for him with
justice the character of a good
neighbour. He was a keen judge of
stock, more particularly of horses,
and in his time bred many first-class
animals which ranked with the best
in the district. Though occupied
with the many duties connected with
the administration of his pastoral
proposition, he was not unmindful of
the duties of citizenship, taking his
full share of the work and respon-
sibility attaching to public office and
being ever ready to do his utmost
for the welfare of the district
wherein he had made his home.
During his residence in the North he
filled the presidential chair of the
Farmers’ and Settlers’ Association at
Proserpine, and was also director of
the Proserpine Central Sugar Milling
Company. Mr. W. A. Nicol married
on November 13, 1887, Emily Jane,
daughter of the late George
Hayward, of Gloucester, England.
The latter gentleman arrived at
Rockhampton with his wife and one
child then born to him in the year
1861, having made the journey
from England in the “Persia.’’
Shortly afterwards he was success-
ful in obtaining employment on
“Calliungal” Station, in the vicinity
of Rockhampton, where he remained
for nine years, gaining during that
period a valuable insight into the
routine of pastoral life. Subsequently
he was associated with the copper
mining industry, pursuing the calling
at Copperfield, in the Leichhardt
district. At a later period the
carrying trade occupied his energies,
his operations taking him over the

routes out from Westwood, past
which centre at that time the railway
had not been laid, while still later,
now nearly half a century ago, he
was well-known in the same business
on the roads of Western Queensland.
Eventually he settled on the land,
taking up one of the first blocks of
grazing country thrown open for
selection in the vicinity of the town
of Longreach, and for many years
was engaged in the administration
and development of his property,
“Blaina,” which is now incorporated
with “Strathmore” Station. His
death occurred at “Blaina” in the
year 1903. Of the union of the late
William Andrew Nicol and his wife
there was issue four sons and five
daughters. The sons, as previously
stated, assist their mother in the
conduct of “Hillview,” a mutual
dissolution of the partnership
established between their father and
Mr. John Hayward having occurred
two years subsequent to the death of
Mr. W. A. Nicol. The eldest son,
Leslie William, was born on March
28, 1897. He received his education
at Proserpine and Bowen and on the
completion of his school career
entered pastoral life, gaining his first
knowledge of the industry under his
father’s supervision. The late
pioneer’s second son, Charles
Bertram (born April 3, 1899) was
also educated at the above-mentioned
towns, and, on leaving school, like
his eldest brother availed himself of
the opportunity of engaging in
landed pursuits on the home acres.
Reuben Arthur, the third son, was
born on April 5, 1901, and educated
at the Townsville Grammar School,

whose birthday was January 8, 1903,
was educated at the Mount Morgan
High School. “Hillview” is situated

under the Southern Cross, his grand-
father, who arrived in New South
Wales about 110 years ago, having
been in the van of those who made
pastoral history in the then little
known continent of Australia in the
first decade of the last century. The
Terrys hailed from England and
were descendants of an old family of
the yeoman class. Mr. A. J. Mac-
donald Terry is the eldest son of the
late Thomas Terry, who was very
prominently connected with the pas-
toral development of the Mother
State nearly 100 years ago, when the
industry was in its infancy, and dur-
ing the fifties as part owner of the
historical “Howlong” Station, which,
more than three-quarters of a cen-
tury hack, was known by the
aboriginal name, “Carrathool.” The
late Thomas Terry, erstwhile part
owner of “Howlong,” was one of a
family of three, having had a
younger brother and sister. The
latter became the wife of Mr. Wil-
liam Rudd, a partner with Thomas
Terry in a well-known New South
Wales firm. Each generation of the
Rudd family has been prominently
represented in the Mother State.
Thomas Terry married Margaret,
daughter of the late Alexander Mac-
donald, the founder of another old
and well-known Australian family,
of the second generation of which
such prominent pastoralists as the
late P. F. and J. G. Macdonald —
memoirs of whose careers appear
also in this work—were members.
Some years previous to 1830 Alex-
ander Macdonald was engaged in
farming and cattle raising on a pro-
perty near Campbelltown, New
South Wales. His daughter, the
widow of Thomas Terry, now in her
ninety-sixth year, resides in Sum-
merhill, Sydney. Thomas Terry,
whose pastoral operations were
largely conducted around Woolon-
gong, had a large family, of whom
yet survive five sons and three
daughters. Of the sons two reside
in Queensland, namely, the subject
of this memoir, Mr. A. J. M.
Terry, and his youngest brother,
Mr. Ernest Terry, who, having pre-
viously engaged in pastoral pursuits
in New South Wales, has devoted
himself to the management of
“Inkerman” since the year 1915,
the senior gentleman having relin-
quished at that time the more
arduous duties of administration.
Mr. Terry, sen., whose primary edu-
cation was conducted under his
father’s roof by tutors, was sent to
a school in Campbelltown for a
secondary course. When in his early
teens he journeyed to Queensland
to obtain what was then termed
“colonial experience” on a property
owned by his uncle, the late P. F.
Macdonald. He remained with Mr.
Macdonald for three years, during

being finally appointed manager of
“Columbra” Station. The experi-
ences of Mr. Terry during his early
life in Queensland were of a very


strenuous order, the conditions under
which the industry was then carried

endurance, being truly such that
only the fittest could hope to survive.
were considered necessary. In later
years a better feeling existed, which
he was among the first to engender,
allowing the blacks to come un-
molested to “Columbra” and
ague so common to newly opened-up
country, lie finally returned to the
pastoral industry. In the years 1872
he took up “Eton Vale,” a property
in the district outlving Bowen, which
It was no unusual thing for him

The hostile feeling of the blacks,
doubtless engendered before settle-
ment was advanced so far north by
the unscrupulous methods employed
by certain of the whites in the South
in punishing their depredations and
the more evil of their propensities,
made pioneering in this district very
difficult, things being finally brought
to such a pass that, after shepherds

his intimate association with
Queensland in the making, Mr.
Terry, who is a gifted raconteur and
whose recollections of the past are
most interesting, was given many
opportunities of becoming conversant
with the customs, beliefs, and char-
acteristics of the fast disappearing
original race of Northern Queens-
land. He proceeded to Bowen after
relinquishing the management of
“Columbra,” and from Bowen visited
Ravenswood, then a newly discovered
goldfield and a settlement of tents,
had been abandoned by the previous
owner. He stocked this run with
cattle which he chiefly obtained from
“Balcomba” Station, on the Fitzroy
River, and, holding it for eleven
years, considerably developed it,
eventually, in 1883, selling to Mr.
J. A. Page, who continued its owner
for more than a quarter of a century
afterwards. On disposing of “Eton
Vale,” Mr. Terry purchased “Blen-
heim” Station on the Bowen River,
on which he conducted operations for
three years, at the end of which,
in 1886, he sold this property also,

by Mr. Terry and submitted to a
system of development which he per-
sonally supervised from 1889 to 1911
and which resulted in many improve-
ments. He encountered some diffi-
cult times during his ownership of
the property, some of which serve
to illustrate the divergence between
present-day prices of stock and the
values of past years. The cattle with
which he originally formed “Kirk-
uie’ ’ were worth £3 per head, while
the highest price that he was able to
secure for stores six years later was
10s. per head, his fats bringing not
more than £2 each. Among many
interesting reminiscences Mr. Terry
recalls an occasion when he sold a
The gentleman under review met
the difficulty by waiving half the
price, thus getting 4s. per head for
the stock. For the pastoralists of
this district 1896 was a very bad
year, witnessing, as a result of the
cattle tick visitation, the financial
ruin of several of them. Though
having kept his property free of
debt, Mr. Terry was amongst the
few station holders who did not then
go to the wall, he suffered a loss of
85 per cent, of the “Kirknie”
stock, the remainder being so poor
as to be quite unsaleable. His ex-
perienoes at this time, rendering
negligible the results of many hard
years and big sacrifices won in the
face of drought and other calamitous
circumstances, were such as would
have disheartened a man of weaker
calibre, but Mr. Terry, upheld by
the comradeship, support, and ever-
ready synqoathy of a loyal wife,
the wonderfully recuperative powers
of the country re-asserted themselves,
he again found his interests in the
industry on a solid footing, being in
the position to add to them in the
year 1900 by the purchase of “Thyra”
and the 3,000 head of cattle then
depasturing that run, the site of
which is on the Cape River. In 1901
he disposed of “Thyra,” having pre-
viously removed the stock. Among
other vicissitudes of his varied
career he fought the great drought
of 1901-3 on “Kirknie.” In the
year 1908 he purchased “Laurel
Vale,” a Western Queensland sta-
tion situated near Prairie, which,
formerly a sheep property, is now
devoted to horned stock and owned
by his daughter, Miss J. L. R.
Terry. During the years he held
“Kirknie” he also owned, in con-
junction with his son, Mr. A. J. S.
B. Terry, “Enryb Downs” and
“Knapdale,” the family, by whom
the former property was named,
having eventually disposed of both,
the former,, “Enryb,” to his son,
T. S. B. Terry. Mr. Terry sold
“Kirknie” in 1911 and took up his
residence in Brisbane, where he lived
in retirement from business cares
until 1914, when, feeling the need
of the old familiar interests to
employ his still vigorous mental and
physical powers, he re-entered the
field of pastoral activity. His new
venture, the historically noted
“Inkerman” Station, was taken up
in 1861 by his uncle, Mr. J. G.
Macdonald, who at the same time
acquired “Leichhardt Downs,”
“Dalrymple,” and other areas. Mr.

surmounted also this the greatest
disaster of his pastoral career. When
things were at their worst he
engaged in droving to tide over the
evil times, and in due course, when
Macdonald’s pastoral interests
suffered considerably owing to the
droughts, indifferent stock markets,
and other adverse conditions, and
thus, in the year 1870, “Inkerman”


and the adjoining run, “Leichhardt
Downs,” were sold to the late
Robert Towns & Co., after having
been held from 1861 by Mr. Mac-
donald, Captain Robert Towns, Sir
Alexander Stewart, and Sir John
Robertson, of Sydney, in partner-
ship, under the title of J. G. Mac-
donald & Co. The end of the seven-
ties witnessed the runs in the pos-
session of Messrs. Mcllwraith & Co.
Later they were owned by the North
Australian Pastoral Co., under the
direction of the late William Forrest
and the Messrs. Collins, who effected
the sale of a portion of the combined
area of “Inkerman” and “Leich-
hardt Downs” consisting of 80,000
acres to the Government of Queens-
land for closer settlement purposes,
this land being the site of a now
prolific sugar area on the Burdekin
Delta. The block comprising “Kirk-
nie,” as already mentioned, was
taken up by Mr. Terry in 1889 and
retained by him until 1911. The
balance of the property, which in-
cluded the “Inkerman” homestead
area, was purchased by Mr. A. J.
Cotton, who sold it, with a part of
his stud stock he had raised here, to
Mr. Terry in the year 1914. On
coming into the hands of the nephew
of the original owner it was thus, by
resumptions and sales, reduced to the
comparatively small acreage of
60,000, and since then has continued
to depasture on an average a herd of
5,000 and horses to the number of
about 250, the equine stock, which
include some very fine specimens,

with which he originally stocked the
ran, these having been purchased in
the Bowen district. He has consider-
ably improved “Inkerman” by the
erection of additional fences and new
yards and by repairing those already
in existence and by the construction
of dips. The old homestead, the his-
tory of which dates back to the year

1870, was also included in the com-
paratively recent scheme of develop-
ment, and a distinctly up-to-date
atmosphere has been created within
and without the building, which
deservedly comes under the heading
of one of the most comfortable and
picturesque pastoral homes of the
North. It was originally erected on
"Leichhardt Downs,” as "Inker-
man” was then an out station, being
used for depasturing cattle, while
the former run was devoted to sheep.
In time "Inkerman” became the
more important property, and in
consequence the homestead was trans-
ferred to its present site on that run,
which is most lavishly endowed with
natural water received from large
lagoons, springs, and waterways,
and Plum Tree Creek. Wells
equipped with windmills afford a
good supplemental supply. Mr.
Terry is one of the oldest Justices of
the Peace in Queensland, having
been gazetted under the Mcllwraith
Administration in the early seven-
ties, and exercised the functions of
the office under three monarchs —
Victoria, Edward, and George. The
foregoing account of his pastoral
undertakings speaks adequately of
his value as a citizen to the State,
for assuredly he should be ranked
with those pioneers whose indom-
itable energy and capacity for work
have built a nation. He married in
the year 1875 Rose Mary Angella,
daughter of the late Michael Hugh
Byrne, a member of an old family
whose name figures prominently in
Irish history. Mr. Byrne was a
native of Wicklow, Ireland, and,
born in the year 1801, came with
his parents to Australia when a
child. Of the union of Mr. and
Mrs. Terry there is a family of three
sons and four daughters. Memoirs
relating to the careers of their two
sons, Messrs. T. S. B. and L. V. B.
Terry, appear elsewhere in this work.
The second son, Mr. Alexander
James Staines Byrne Terry, is en-
gaged on his own account at "Dal-
muir,” near Stamford, Western
Queensland. He married Ruth,
daughter of Mr. A. A. Paine, of
"Glenyarra,” Ayr, and has a family
of three sons and one daughter. Of
Mr. Terry’s daughters, the eldest,
Margaret Annie Jean, married Mr.
A. H. Abbott, of “Elina Grove,”
Ingham; the third, Clara Frances,
became the wife of Mr. F. D. R.
Grant, of the Australian Bank of
Commerce, Brisbane; and the
youngest, Emmaline, is married to
Mr. A. Keogh, of the Commonwealth
Bank, Brisbane. Miss Julia Louisa
Rose Terry resides at "Inkerman,”
and here her kindliness keeps alive
that spirit of hospitality which has
ever held sway in the historical old
homestead.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


JOHN GRAHAM MACDON-
ALD. Among the worthies of
Queensland, those who did the State
great service, the name of Mr. John
Graham Macdonald deserves to be
well remembered. By his explora-
tions he opened up huge tracts of
country to pastoral enterprise, estab-
lishing properties which played an
important part in developing the
primary industries of Queens-
land. Among the stations he in-
augurated are names familiar to
stockowners, for under his energy
and enterprise these grew and
prospered—“lnkerman,” “Strath-
bogie,” “Dalrymple,” “Kirknie,”
“Leichhardt Downs,” and “Car-
pentaria Downs.” No less worthy
and capable was Mr. Macdonald’s
work in later years, for as a Gold
Warden and Police Magistrate he
won golden opinions, while he occu-
pied the Bench, the amiability of an
endearing personality, in some men
a source of weakness, being balanced
by a rare gift of reading character,
a power which stood him in good
stead in his administrative duties.
John Graham Macdonald’s childhood
was spent in what may be termed
the interregnum days of Australian
history. He was a native of Camp-
belltown, New South Wales, his
birthday being September 5, 1834.
His previous experiences were slip-
ping away from Australia with the
old days and the old systems, while
the new era had not dawned. Man-
hood’s early years found Mr. Mac-
donald astir and eager to- take
up life’s work, for at the age of
twenty he joined his brother, Mr.
A. C. Macdonald, C.E., then
engaged in work in Victoria, and
acquired a knowledge of surveying.
Two years later his energy found
outlet in general farming and
grazing pursuits near Geelong.
That he was staid and possessed of
solid mental gifts beyond his years
is proved by the fact that in 1857,
when only twenty-three years of age,
he became a Justice of the Peace,
and later became chairman of the
Portarlington District Road Board
and also chairman of the Bellarine
Farmers’ Association, his capable
performance of the duties of the
office being attested by the fact that
he held the position for three suc-
cessive annual terms. Beyond that,
public opinion pronounced the verdict
that he had not spent his days on
the land for naught, for he acted as
one of the judges in the competition
under the Geelong and Western
District Agricultural Society for the
best-managed farm, and for which
prizes were awarded. In 1859, when
a new Colony was established in Aus-
tralia by the separation of the
mother settlement from her stalwart
daughter, Queensland, Mr. Mac-
donald heard the call of the wild,
and answering, sold out all his
interests and went north. The gold
field at Canoona, which had ' been
discovered a year previously, at-
tracted him, but not for long. He
had made a venture from Sydney,
having taken horses to Rockhamp-
ton. After selling them, however,
he joined his brother, Mr. P. F.
Macdonald, in exploration work, the
country at the head waters of the
Nogoa and Belyando Rivers being
traversed, and as a result of the
pioneering trip a very large area of
land, known subsequently as Glenlee,
was secured. Mr. Macdonald seems
now to have realized that in explora-
tion he could at once achieve that
for his country which he ardently
desired, advancement and prosperity,
and in the doing of the work gratify
that love of adventure which burned
so strongly in him. So the far
and unknown north, as it then was,
drew him, and in 1861 he made his
way to Bowen, being a member of
the foundation party led by
Dalrymple. As the result of his
exploring trips from Bowen, which
became his base, “Dalrymple” and
the other stations mentioned above
were formed, Carpentaria Downs
being taken up and stocked as the
outcome of a journey to the head-
waters of the Einasleigh River,
which at that time was supposed to
be identical with the Lina River,
referred to by Leichhardt. The
Burdekin waters were followed up
from the coast to the Valley of
Lagoons, westward of Cardwell. It
is interesting to recall the fact that
in a very real sense Mr. Macdonald
has good claim to be considered a
veritable city father of Bowen, for
he and his brother, Mr.. P. F. Mac-
donald, figure among the purchasers
of allotments at the first sale of town
allotments, and, indeed, Adelaide
Point, where he took up his resi-
dence, was named after his wife. It
is noteworthy to recall the fact that
Mr.- Macdonald’s brother, Mr. P. F.
Macdonald, who subsequently had a
distinguished career as a Member of
Parliament, can also claim place on
the roll of pioneers in development
work, etc., on Peak Downs. In 1863
he entered into partnership with Sir
John Robertson, Sir Alexander
Stewart, and Captain R. Towns, and
formed a pastoral syndicate under
the title of J. G. Macdonald & Com-
pany. He became the managing
partner of the firm, the objective
being the development of the
important and valuable grazing
properties adverted to, and which in
totality represented no small contri-
bution to the pastoral wealth of
Queensland. One might have fancied
perhaps that circumstances, as they
then were with him, might have
moved Mr. Macdonald to abandon
his love of nature in her wild garb,
but it was not so, for in 1864 he was
again on trek, travelling in August
of that year with two white men, one
black boy, and 17 horses from Bowen
to Carpentaria Downs. Subsequently
the country as far west as the
Gregory River was explored, the
journey taking him near the
sites of future settlements, later
known as Croydon and Normanton.
Thereafter the Gregory River was
traced down to the site of the
present town of Burketown. Still on
the look out for grazing land, Mr.
Macdonald, on behalf of the syndi-
cate he represented, took up that
portion of the country attractively
named “The Plains of Promise” by
Captain Stokes. This area of land
included Floraville on the Leich-
hardt, Beames Brook, and Gregory
Downs. The trip to the Gregory
was accomplished in the marvel-
lously short time of 44 days,
the river being reached in latitude
18° 40' S. and longitude 139° 20' E.
AVhen one is told that the explorer
had for companions on the journey
only two white men and a black boy,
one is inclined to marvel at the
energy, strength of will, and purpose
which must have animated the
leader. The Gregory River was
followed north to a few miles below
its junction with the Nicholson
River. Here a depot was established.
Including the Plains of Promise one
million acres were taken up and later
transformed into station properties.
It is of importance to remember,
that as a result of Mr. Macdonald’s
exploring journey in 1864 the first
store was established at the Albert
in the same year. In June of that
year a settlement was formed at
Adam Bay, Alexander Land, Mr. B.
T. Ginnis being the first Government
Resident. His settlement was, how-
ever, abandoned subsequently in
1869 in favour of Poi’t Darwin,
selected by Mr. G. W. Goyder, who


founded Palmerston. In tlie same
year Port Albany, North Queens-
land, was founded by Captain
Carnegie, of H.M.S. “Salamander.”
Not only could Mr. Macdonald
explore but also narrate his explora-
tions, and as one of the results of
the journey a book was published by
the leader of the expedition, invalu-
able in one respect, for with it Mr.
Macdonald issued a map of country
absolutely unknown until he and his
companions traversed it. A copy of
the book was sent by Sir George
Bowen, who was then Governor of
Queensland, to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, with the
result that the Imperial Minister
complimented Mr. Macdonald very
warmly on the great results which
had attended his explorations.
In July, 1872, Mr. Macdonald,
having bidden a final farewell
to pastoral pursuits, began a
prolonged and distinguished career
in the Public Service of Queensland,
a career that, during the thirty-three
years of its continuance, was charac-
terized by unflinching devotion to
his official duties, a devotion that
many will think was hardly recog-
nized as it should have been when
the time of need came. Mr. Mac-
donald’s first appointment on the
Bench was that of Police Magistrate
and Gold Commissioner at the
remote field of Gilberton; but that
position was very soon exchanged for
the much more important control of
Charters Towers, the wealth of
which in gold production leaped
suddenly into prominence. It does
not come within the scope of this
article to deal with the causes which
led to wild unrest on the part of the
thousands of diggers, drawn to “the
Towers” by inflated telegrams con-
cerning gold finds. One thing is
certain, that things were not as they
were reported to be. As a result,
hardships came to the many who
found themselves stranded at Chart-
ers Towers, moneyless and workless.
Serious rioting occurred, and but for
the presence of Mr. Macdonald and
the wise tact and firmness he dis-
played in dealing with a difficult
situation, the outcome in regard to
the miners themselves, the future of
the fields, and the State as a whole
might have been disastrous in the
extreme. By his sane common sense
the Gold Commissioner smoothed
away the difficulties, and trouble was
averted. It was in this work that
Mr. Macdonald marked his judicial
and administrative duties with a
white stone. He spent 33 years in
the Public Service. Two years later,
in 1874, he was transferred to a less
electric atmosphere, becoming Police
Magistrate and Gold Commissioner
at Springsure, west of Rockhampton.
Here for 11 years he performed all
the duties of his office, holding courts
at Comet, Emerald, Bogantungan,
and Pine Hills on the Central Rail-
way. During the occupancy of the
Bench at Springsure, he received the
distinction of being elected a Fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society of
London, a recognition of services
rendered to the Empire in explora-
tion well deserved. And it may be
mentioned that he had close relation
with the Victorian Branch of the
Royal Geographical Society of Aus-
tralia, of which he was one of the
founders, and a life member. In
1883 his energy found outlet in
another direction, for in that year
he formed a Masonic Lodge at
Springsure, becoming the first
Master. In 1885 Mr. Macdonald
was appointed Police Magistrate and
Northern Sheriff at Bowen, and
three years later he was promoted to
Townsville as Police Magistrate and
Gold Commissioner. After 11 years’
service in Townsyille Mr. Macdonald
was transferred, in 1899, to Warwick.
With his appointment to South
Brisbane in January, 1904, came the
finale to his career as a Police
Magistrate, for after fulfilling the
offices of Visiting Justice to Brisbane
Prison (male and female divisions),
St. Helena Penal Establishment, and
Dunwich Benevolent Asylum, he
was retired in April, 1905, after a
total term of 33 years of service, of
which 27 years were, as will be seen,
spent in the Central and Northern
Divisions. In accordance with hard
facts and statutory regulations there
was justification for Mr. Mac-
donald’s retirement, but a man is no
older than he feels, and that this
worthy pioneer and able magistrate
felt himself capable of work was
proved by his doing it. For four
years he chafed under enforced
inactivity at variance with the
strenuous life he had led, and the
inactivity was accentuated by the
fact that despite his advanced years
he still retained unimpaired the
faculties that had contributed in
such a substantial degree to the
up-building of the State. Among
the statutory measures introduced by
the Kidston Government in 1908 was
a “Wages Board Act,” necessitating
the constitution of Boards to deal
with the settlement of industrial
disputes and regulate wages in the
various industries of the State.
These Boards, constituted on an
elective basis, were to be presided
over by a chairman selected by the
representatives of the parties at
issue. Here, in work demanding
probity, a spirit of conciliation, and
a well-balanced judicial mind was an
outlet for the dormant energies of a
man eminently qualified for the
office. And so it proved, for a dozen
Boards selected Mr. Macdonald to
preside over their deliberations, a
splendid proof to the ability that the
Government of the day did not
recognize or was forbidden by cast-
iron regulations from giving effect
to the recognition of his awards. Only
two were questioned on appeal,
while of these two, one the Minister,
exercising the judicial powers given
by the Act, refused to vary, and
confirmed. Later Mr. Macdonald
again took up the work of Visiting
Justice at various Government insti-
tutions, including industrial schools
and the mental asylums of the
metropolitan area. He continued so
occupied until the illness came which
terminated in death on May 29,
1918. Only under treatment for a
few brief weeks in a hospital, he
passed to the place beyond these
voices. Few men, even in our busy
Commonwealth, have had a record
so full, so unblemished, so worthy in
work done for country and for others.
Little need to add that Mr. Mac-
donald was beloved by all who knew
him; the life imperfectly sketched
could not but attract love. He has
passed but his work remains. Mr.
Macdonald, who was twice married,
left a widow with one son and two
daughters to mourn a loss, the State
in all its three divisions shared. The
son, Mr. W. B. Macdonald, is a
solicitor at Hughenden, while the
daughters are Mrs. E. B. Wareham
and Mrs. J. A. Roe, of “Inkerman”
Station, North Queensland. His
brother, Mr. P. F. Macdonald died
only last year, thus severing another
link with the past and its work. The
last sacred rites were administered
on May 30, 1918, the funeral taking
place from the residence of the
deceased gentleman, “Kotoro,” Mer-
wall Street, South Brisbane. All
that was mortal was laid to rest but
his work remains, and has influenced
and bettered Queensland in North,
Centre, and South alike.


ANDREW SCOTT, “Leswalt,”
Winton, was born at Timpendean,
near Jedburgh, in the Shire of
Roxburgh, Scotland, on November
22, 1865. He is a son of the late
MR. ANDREW SCOTT.
William Scott, who during his life-
time was engaged in agrarian
providing records which lead to the
assumption that the family were
among the early primary producers
of the country. Mr. Andrew Scott
received his scholastic training at

Merchiston Castle College,
Edinburgh, where he continued
until reaching the last year of his
teens, becoming then associated with
his father in the industry to which
so many generations of his
progenitors had devoted themselves.
He continued under the paternal
roof-tree until reaching manhood,
land under the Southern Cross.
Accordingly, he took passage to
Brisbane, where he arrived on the
day which witnessed hie attainment
to the age of twenty-one. From the
Queensland metropolis he proceeded
to “Mount Hutton” Station, which
with other large cattle properties
then owned by the late James Broad,
a typical pioneer of Scotch birth of

enterprising settlers to whose efforts

when, realizing that to remain at
home would mean little short of
stagnation, so far as his own personal
career was concerned, he decided
to cross the seas to the far-away
of her present prosperity. He
continued in the service of Mr.
Broad for about a year, during
which he gained a knowledge of

equipment for future employment
in the vocation which he thence-

Hutton” to take on the duties of
jackaroo on “Bimerah,” near
Stonehenge, a property at that time
in the ownership of the Messrs.
Fairbairn, and to which he was
subsequently appointed overseer.
After five years spent in the service
of the Fairbairn family he entered
upon a career as a drover, under-
taking his first contract in the year
1892 and remaining on the roads for
the following twenty-two years, his
duties as an independent drover
taking him to nearly every corner of
Western and Northern Queensland.
In the year 1914 he negotiated the
purchase of “Leswalt,” and two
years deciding to adopt a more
settled life than that which for so
many years had been his lot,
assumed the management of the
property on behalf of Mrs.
Duncombe, the lady who is now his
wife. He has since been occupied
with the development of “Leswalt,”
which was later amalgamated with
an adjoining block named “Wando,
purchased in 1918, both runs, which
are now conducted as a single
proposition, embracing an area of
about 60,000 acres, having originally
formed part of a resumed area on
“Oondooroo” Station. The nature
of the country comprising “Leswalt”
is characteristic of some of the best
grazing country in the west, as
indicated by Flinders and Mitchell
grass downs, timbered lightly with
and supplejack and
intersected by creeks. One of these
waterways takes its name from the
founder of the Scott family of
“Hornet Bank” Station, near
Taroom, whose pioneering enterprise
extended to this district, most of
which was originally taken up by
him for pastoral purposes in the
early days of its settlement, while
the other is called “Oondooroo”
Creek. Sheep form the mainstay of
“Leswalt,” the carrying capacity of
which allows of a flock of 25,000 to
be depastured within its boundaries,

from 20,000 upwards. Develop-

with the most progressive ideas.
The woolshed is a well-built
structure equipped with a six-stand
Wolseley plant. Originally the
residence of the manager of one of
the local banks at Charters Towers,
the homestead was purchased and
re-erected at “Apsley” in 1916 on a
site lying 25 miles south-east of
Winton, on the old Muttaburra road,
Mr. Scott, like many of his
neighbours, having seized the
opportunity of purchasing a modern
home already constructed at that
thriving centre when the necessity
of erecting a suitable building arose,
and, as in other cases, the experiment
proved entirely satisfactory. A
supporter of sport, he has actively
identified himself as a committeeman
of various clubs in the North
Gregory district. His marriage
occurred in the year 1916 to Kate,
daughter of the late William
O’Keeffe, of Ruhillmore, County
Cork, Ireland, a scion of very ancient
stock, which has produced famous
soldiers through the different eras
of Irish history, the name harking
back to the days when, as epitomised
in an old motto, the country was
doubly armed with the strength and
power of her sword and the virtue of
her women—the latter characteristic
being one that remains, having stood
the test of ages. Previous to her
marriage Mrs. Scott was well known
in connection with her commercial
interests in Western Queensland,
and as the widow of the late Horace
Duncombe, a member of one of the
oldest families in New South Wales,
the founder of which was identified
with the early pastoral history of the
Armidale district, New South Wales,
as part owner of “Laura” Station.
A family of one son and two
daughters resulted from the first
union.

main line to which the representa-
tives of this family owe their descent
were identified with agricultural
pursuits in the Motherland from a
period now lost in the mists of
antiquity. The paternal great-grand-
father of the Dawsons of “Mount
Landsborough” hailed from Lincoln-
shire, England, and came to the
land of the Southern Cross in the
early part of last century, just
about 100 years ago. Having
sprung from a race of farmers who
were trained to agricultural pursuits
in his native land, the founder of the
family in Australia directed his

Mr. John Acton Dawson practised
law on reaching manhood’s estate,
joining his father in partnership,
and was actively engaged in the
profession until the time of his
death, which occurred in the year
1891. He married Florence Mary
Henfrey, daughter of a former well-
known citizen of Sydney, New South
Wales, who was identified with
commercial and manufacturing
pursuits in that capital. Of the
union there was a family of five sons
and three daughters. One of the
sons, Rupert Leslie Dawson, follows

pastoral industry, and realizing the
exceptional possibilities contained in
the vast unoccupied spaces of the
northern part of Australia for those
to whom life on the land appealed as
the basis of a career, set out for
Queensland in the year 1907 and
undertook the duties of jackaroo on
“Rangelands” Station, near Winton.
The following year he took up
“Mount Landsborough” in conjunc-
tion with his late brother, Herbert
Selwyn, with whom he jointly
administered the property until the
latter joined the colours, severing,
in response to the call of duty, a
connection which was characterized

his arrival, taking up a patch of
country on the South-Coast of New
South Wales, and, subsequently,
widening the sphere of his opera-
tions, became one of the pioneer
graziers of the Mother State. Of the
children born to him ere leaving his
native land, one was the late John
Dawson, the grandfather, who was
twelve years old when he arrived
with the family in Australia. Having
been educated for the law, Mr. John
Dawson, in due course, qualified as
a solicitor, afterwards practising his
profession in Sydney. Twelve

occupying a position as draughtsman
in the Lands’ Office, Sydney. Justin

he married Edith Cleve, daughter of
the late William B. Bartlam, of

Victoria, Mr. Bartlam received his
education at the Church of England
Grammar School in that city. He
gained his first experience of the
sheep-raising industry at “Perri-
coota” Station, on the Murray River,
subsequently, in company with the
late Malcolm Chisholm, travelling
to “Moselle Downs,” Richmond,

throughout Northern Queensland as
a keen supporter of racing, and

“Island Lodge,” the old home in
County Antrim with which the
family had been associated since the
date of one of the early settlements
formed in the North of Ireland by
Scottish colonists, he was descended
from stock which had been identified
with primary production in the Old
World for centuries—originally in
Scotland, and subsequently in Ire-
land. The first member of this
family to arrive in Australia was the
late William Clark’s uncle, Samuel
Clark, who became a shipowner and
was recorded in the late fifties as
managing the interests of the old
Australian Steam Navigation Com-
pany. In response to his uncle’s
desire, Mr. W. Clark left Ireland
with the view of eventually taking
charge of landed interests which the
late Samuel Clark then intended to
acquire, to which end was secured
for him a post on “Westbrook” Sta-
tion, on the Darling Downs. The
death of the last-mentioned gentle-
man, shortly after his arrival, pre-
vented the materialization of the
plans for his future, and he was thus
left to carve his own career. He
continued to engage in pastoral work
for some time, changing his occupa-
tion to mining when payable gold
was found at what is now Ravens-
wood. Not having any luck at
Ravenswood he went to a diggings
near Charters Towers, called the “70
Mile,” where for a time he was
engaged in fossicking. Later he
became associated with the No. 1
and No. 2 Identity Mines, in which
he first met with anything tangible
in the way of success. Finally
abandoning mining, he purchased
a half share in “Doongmabulla”
Station, on the Carmichael River,
and for the following two years
was engaged in the management
of this property. “Doongmabulla”
was disposed of in the year 1881,
when Mr. Clark came further north
and took up virgin country (pre-
viously unoccupied owing to its lack
of permanent water), on which he
bestowed the name of “Mirtna,” his
affection for his native County in
Ireland finding expression in the
reversal of the spelling of Antrim, a
name which had already been given
to a Queensland pastoral property.
In the year 1882 he formed the sta-
tion with a mob of breeders pur-
chased from a Mr. Moody, of
Charters Towers. On “Mirtna” he
spent over thirty years ere his death
claimed from the community a
citizen whose character had been
marked by kindliness and integrity.
He married in the year 1878 Mary
Theresa, daughter of the late
Thomas Kennedy, who followed com-
mercial life in Durgarvin, County
Waterford, Ireland, where several
generations of his family had been
engaged in trade. Five sons and
two daughters were born of this
union, the daughters yet residing

engaged in the management of that
property. As a member of the Aus-
tralian Imperial Forces he served his
country from 1916 until the
Armistice, being twice wounded in
the course of operations on the
Western front. His brothers—
Henry Samuel, Robert John, and
Archibald Kennedy —were born at
“Mirtna” on November 13, 1888;
March 25, 1893; and July 20, 1895,
respectively. The former was edu-
cated at the old home and the two
latter were students of the
as corporal and the latter as lance-
corporal. Both became casualties in
France, Archie having been wounded
on two occasions. The latter, after
escaping the terrible dangers of the
battlefield, was spared to his family
in Australia for but a few years, for
on February 16, 1922, while engaged
in stock duties at “Malvern Downs”
Station, he met death as the result
of an accident. Robert John, on
leaving school, entered the service
of the Union Bank of Australia,
Ltd., at Townsville. With the out-
break of the War in 1914 he tem-
porarily relinquished his position to
join the First Contingent, and in
April of the following year was pre-
sent at the famous landing at
Gallipoli, being then numbered
amongst the wounded. After a period
in hospital he returned to duty, con-
tinuing with the forces at Gallipoli
until the evacuation. From the
East he proceeded with his regiment
to France, where he participated
in the fighting until he was again
incapacitated by wounds. On receiv-
ing his discharge, he returned to his
former duties and is now attached to
the Bank’s Brisbane branch. In
the year 1920 he married Nancy
Emily, daughter of Lieutenant-
Colonel Fowles, A.1.F., who now
resides in Brisbane and whose only
son made the supreme sacrifice
at Gallipoli. “Mirtna” embraces
within its boundaries an area known
as ‘‘Yumara,” and the two pro-

LOUTS JAMES LANDSBERG,
J.P., “Trafalgar,” Charters Towers,
was born in Rockhampton, Central
Queensland, on February 10, 1872,
and is the second son of the
MR. L. F. LANDSBERG.
late Leopold Francis Landsberg, a
descendant of a noble Polish family
which suffered deprivation of titles,
estates, and in many instances of life
itself, as the outcome of that pas-
sionate love of freedom which is one
of the most distinguishing character-
istics of the Polish race. The late
gentleman was born in the year 1837
in Dantzig, the ancient capital of
Poland, and like his father, who was
a baron in his own right, was pro-
minently concerned in the struggle
for continued independence which
marked the latter years of the
18th century. He was destined,
however, to see all his hopes
shattered and his beloved country
partitioned between her three then
powerful neighbours—Russia, Aus-
tria, and Prussia. Deprived of every
shred of prestige, many noble families
of Poland shared the fate of the
Royal line, suffering extinction in
exile, the last heir to the Polish
throne dying as a shepherd in
America. Realizing that under the
altered conditions there was little
hope of enjoying in his native land
that freedom which in common with
his countrymen he so dearly prized,
and confident that the most happy
conditions for the exile were offered
under British rule, the late Leopold
Francis Landsberg left Poland for
Australia in 1858. The year follow-
ing his arrival witnessed the estab-
lishment of the Colony of Queens-
land, the potentialities of which were
consequently very much before the
public mind. Mr. Landsberg was
attracted hither by the certainty that
larger opportunities would present
themselves than in the more closely
settled areas of the Continent, and,
during the first years of his sojourn
in the then Colony, found it possible
to support himself and, at the same
time, study a jirofession that pro-
mised ample employment. He had
been trained in Poland for the
medical profession, which he prac-
tised intermittently in Queensland,
more to be of service to settlers
deprived of other medical aid than
for pecuniary advantage. In the

sixties he seriously took up the pro-
fession of surveying, which occupied
the remainder of the thirty years of
his life in his adopted country, his
death taking place in Rockhampton
in the year 1888. His work as a
surveyor was of considerable his-
torical importance and was car-
ried on in the face of extreme
danger from elemental disturbances,
abnormal rainfalls, droughts, and
hostile natives, the latter more par-
ticularly in the district outlying
“Llornet Bank,” where he was
engaged, and personally encountered
many risks, at the time of the murder
of the Fraser family by aborigines.
Many of the old pastoral holdings on
the Darling Downs, and in the
Springsure, Clermont, Rockhamp-
ton, and Broadsound districts, were
originally surveyed and had their
boundaries defined by him, and it is
on record that with the delineation
of the South Kennedy district from
the descriptions and drawings of Dr.
Leichhardt, the Hon. A. C. Gregory,
and Sir Thomas Mitchell, be became
the first draughtsman to produce a
map of any portion of Queensland.
Of the many bonds of friendship
which strengthened his devotion to
the land whose development he
so faithfully assisted, that which
resulted from his association with
the Messrs. Archer, well-known
Queensland pastoralists, was perhaps
the closest and most cherished. He
married Emily, daughter of the late
John Wright, a native of Cornwall,
England, where the branch of the
Wright family of which the late
gentleman was a representative had
been established and had contributed
towards the work of primary produc-
tion for many generations. Of the
union there survives a family of
three sons and two daughters. The
eldest son of the founder of the
Landsberg family in Australia is Mr.
Leopold Philip Landsberg, who,
having spent a long career in the
pastoral industry in Queensland, is

the late Holt Holt, who for a long
period was attached to the teaching
staff of the Queensland Department
for Education, and the younger,
Emily, resides with her brother at
"Trafalgar.” Mr. L. J. Landsberg
was educated under tutorial super-
vision in his father's home. When
in his middle teens he became
engaged in pastoral operations on a
property which the late L. F. Lands-
berg had acquired in the vicinity of
Rockhampton, and under whom he
became acquainted with many aspects
of the industry. Subsequently, in
conjunction with his brothers, he
became interested in freehold

management of the area. Two years
later the partnership between the
brothers was dissolved by mutual
consent, and Mr. Landsberg, being
free for the time being from pressing
business cares, seized the opportunity
of visiting England and Scotland
and many other parts of the old
world. On his return to Australia
he once more identified himself with
the great industry which is the
backbone of the State, by the pur-
chase of "Trafalgar” Station, where
he now resides. He immediately
directed his efforts to the further
development of this property, which
now ranks as one of the most highly

solely devoted to the raising and
fattening of shorthorn cattle. The
herd was founded by Mr. Rollinson
on good stock, and has been since
kept up to a uniformly fine standard
by the introduction of high quality
bulls from both northern and south-
ern studs, mainly the former, sires

Messrs. Landsberg purchased "Bar-

McKenzie River and formerly owned
by the pioneer of the Blackman
family, from whom it passed to Mr.
Walter Blackman, the latter gentle-
man's son. “Barwon Park” had
been practically abandoned as a
result of the great drought of 1902,
and the Messrs. Landsberg spent
four very full years improving and

It is excellently watered by the
Campaspe River and its many tribu-
taries, by Balfe's Creek, and numer-
ous wells, from which the water is
made available to the stock by the
action of windmills and engine

Landsberg’s acquirement in the year
1913, "Trafalgar,” which has changed
hands several times since the sixties,
was in the ownership of Mr. James
Rollinson, who had entered into
possession of the holding thirteen
years before. Consisting of about

and 20 miles from Balfe's Creek

homestead is one of the most modern
pastoral dwellings in the North.

father, the late James Hall-Scott,
who was one of the pioneers of the
North Kennedy, having arrived in
the district in the early sixties, and
with the selection of “Strathbogie,”
MR. H. A. HALL-SCOTT.
became one of the very first pastoral
landowners north of the Burdekin.
James Hall-Scott came of an old
Scottish family which had been
settled in Ross and Cromarty for
generations, the name being a well-
known one in the northermost part
of Great Britain and in the Isle of
Skye, and at one time in India,
where his brothers were largely
interested in indigo plantations.
During the present generation and
in past times members of this family
have distinguished themselves in vari-
ous professions, some achieving fame
for the part they played in the world
of art and letters and others for
Empire service, which in many cases
during the past quarter of a century
was rewarded with the honour of
knighthood. One of those particu-
larly distinguished for his patriotism
in comparatively recent times was a
paternal uncle of the head of the
family in Northern Queensland, the
former, Sir Henry Hall-Scott, to
whose son belongs the distinction of
being the first volunteer for service
in South Africa after the declaration
of hostilities in 1899, having donated
£l,OOO towards the formation of a
corps of yeomanry during the Boer
War. Mr. A. J. Hall-Scott is
descended on the maternal side from
the Ross family of Contin, Ross and
Cromarty, which, for considerably
more than a century, held, under the
estate ownership of the McKenzie
family of Coul, the old farm lands
comprised in “Kinnahaird.” The
distinguished architect, Sir Rowland
Anderson, Gold Medallist of the
Royal British Institute of Archi-
tects, whose professional reputation
is testified to by many beautiful
buildings in the old world, is his
uncle on the maternal side. The late
James Hall-Scott left Inverness-
shire on July 9, 1852, embarking for
Australia by the sailing ship “Wind-
sor.” The fare then, with only the
barest necessities provided, was £6B.
His fellow passengers in the saloon
numbered 37 and among them were
many gentlemen who, like himself,
were destined to play no insignificant
part in the history making of the
Island Continent under the South-
ern Cross. He had many interest-
ing reminiscences of this voyage and
of his early life in Australia that
made vivid the contrast between the
civilization of less than seventy years
ago and that of the world to-day.
It was his original intention to settle
in South Australia, but, learning
from aquaintances aboard ship of
the better chances for investment in
Queensland —then generally spoken
of as the Moreton Bay district of
New South Wales—he decided to
test the potentialities of this then
little known portion of Australia.
In Southern Queensland he became
the owner of “Taloom” Station, and

absences of her husband, her chil-
dren, of whom there were then two,
contracted diphtheria, and despite
their mother’s care (medical aid in
the circumstances being of course
unobtainable) succumbed to the dis-
ease, and the brave lady, having
performed for them the last rites
left alone, performed the last offices
of him also. As already mentioned,
the late James Hall-Scott took up
“Strathbogie” in the early sixties.
He also occupied “ Woodhouse,”
which, with “Strathbogie” and other
properties, has for very many years
been included in the ownership of
Messrs. Gilchrist, Watt and Cun-
ningham, both areas being now out-
stations of “Strathmore.” The
wool industry was carried on at these
runs by the pioneer in the face of
untold difficulties and hardships
arising from the unsuitability of the
country for sheep, lack of market
facilities and the depredations and
hostile dispositions of the aboriginal
tribes, by whom many shepherds and
others were treacherously murdered.
Two of Mr. Hall-Scott’s men were
killed while tending sheep at “Strath-
bogie” and two others, a jackaroo
and a partiallv civilized black boy,
who was included among his station
hands, were murdered in their sleep
while camping at “Kirknie” Station,
Among the experiences of the
pioneer’s wife during her life at
“Strathbogie” was an occasion,
when, left with a woman servant in
the rough building which then did
service as a home, she realised that
an untimely end at their hands, the
two women were obliged to keep up
a continuous discharge of muzzle
loading guns throughout the night
through the openings between the
slabs of which the hut was con-
tracted. The strain of fearful
expectancy which they endured was
only relieved by the coming of day
when Mr. Hall-Scott and the station
hands returned, at sight of whom the
natives immediately dispersed. The
founder of the Hall-Scott family in
Australia crossed the Great Bourne
when in his early fifties. Bowen
was his headquarters in his active
days and his residence there was
known as ‘'Ross Hall.” He played
an important part in connection
with the development and progress of
the town and district, and the annals
of the time testify to his enterprise
and good citizenship and to the value
to the nation of men of his type and
the debt which posterity owes them.
He was survived by his widow, a son
and daughter, the latter being the
wife of Mr. Glenville Massey of
“Glenville,” Auchenflower, Brisbane,
and “Rokeby” Station, Cape York
Peninsula. Mr. Massey was an
early settler of the Gulf country.

duties incidental to this post he car-
ried out for two years, when, for the
sake of enlarging his experience, he
accepted a position at“Tinnenburra,”
then under the ownership of the
late James Tyson, who was noted
for the millions which accrued to his
larger acquaintance with his native
land, he left “Tinnenburra” to enter
upon a droving career which was to
prove a school of varied experiences
and first hand opportunities of learn-
ing much of the conditions charac-
terising the pastoral industry in
Queensland, New South Wales and
Victoria. Much the same motives
as prompted him to take on droving
caused him to turn his attention to
the mining industry, to which he
later applied himself with character-
istic energy and enthusiasm, without,
however, reaping the results that the
industry invariably holds out to the
optimistic. Still, the knowledge
which he gained in connection with
the mineral development of the
State was such as to qualify him for
the position of mine manager, which
he filled at the Grace Darling and
Albion Tunnel Mines on the Nor-
manby field for some time. Even-
tually, he returned to pastoral life
and in course of time became the
owner of different areas in the vicin-
ity of Bowen. His three properties,
“Kaili Valley,” “Murroona,” and
“Inverdon,” comprise about 10,000
acres of freehold country and a
considerable mileage held under
occupation licence, a-nd, at the time
of writing, depasture cattle and

Almost immediately after his arri-
val he proceeded to the Cunnamulla

remained in Mr. Tyson's service for
two years, at the termination of

from the town and faces the sea, a
beautiful spot called Queen’s Beach
forming its boundary. “Mur-
roona” was Mr. Ilall-Scott’s resi-
dence for many years, but in 1921,
a home was built on “Inverdon,”
which then became the family head-
quarters. Despite the inroads made
on his time by his pastoral affairs,
he finds leisure to bestow on those
movements instituted in the cause of
charity or patriotism or in any way
conducive to the well-being of the
community, and is rightly recorded
as one of Bowen’s most progressive
and active citizens. For nearly a
quarter of a century he has been a

Mutiny. Lieutenant-General Forster
had a family of four sons and a
daughter, the latter being the wife
of Mr. H. W. Jerram, a member of
the London Stock Exchange. His
two elder sons, William Anson
Maitland Prendergast Forster and
Stuart Boscawen Erode Debresay
Forster, were born in Madras, India
—the younger at Erode'—on April
21, 1869, and October 5, 1870,
respectively, and educated in Eng-
land at the Bostol Hill School, Abbey
Wood, Kent. From this academy
the brothers entered upon a course
of agricultural training at the Glas-
nevin College in Ireland. Both
being intended for pastoral life in
Australia, they left England when
in their teens and landed in Towns-
ville in February, 1888, the elder
then proceeding to "Dotswood”
Station, near Charters Towers, and
at that time in the ownership of Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith and under the
management of the late John Carr,
and the younger to "Inkerman”
Station on the Burdekin, then owned
by the North Australian Pastoral
Co. and under the management of
Mr. J. H. Rae. In the year
1895 they joined forces in a
personal venture in the industry,
purchasing “Stonington” from the
late Thos. 11. Houghton, the brothers
being backed in their enterprise by
their maternal uncle, Sir George
MacKenzie of Greys, Dawes & Co.,
London. “Stonington,” which was
founded by Mr. Houghton and
named by him after his birthplace,
originally comprised country to the
extent of 200 square miles. Shortly
after its acquirement it was enlarged
by the Messrs. Forster with the pur-
chase of "Boundary,” an adjoining
station, from Messrs. Carr and
Brown; but in course of time Govern-
ment resumptions reduced its area
to its present figure, which is some-
thing in excess of 100 square miles.
The run has always been devoted to
cattle and horse-raising, the original
herd having been established by the
late Mr. Houghton and been
periodically freshened by the intro-
duction of bulls from the "Bluff
Downs” and other Northern studs.

drought disasters has not since been
attained. “Stonington” has the
name of being an excellent horse-
breeding centre, many mounts from
the station being exported to India,
and one, at least, having done
excellently on the Continent during
the Great War. In the course of the
operations there this particular
animal, who was known as “Romeo,”
and had previously been an officer’s
charger in India and achieved
exceptional success in military racing,
called forth considerable comment
for his speed and boldness in action
as an officer’s remount. The nature
of the country comprising the run,
which is watered by the Cape River,
several creeks and supplies in
swamps, is indicated by ironbark
ridges, flats of box and gum trees
and scrub lands. The natural pro-
vision is supplemented by a number
of wells, and, in a dry season,
troughs and bailing are resorted to.
The present homestead is a modern
structure, at a comparatively recent
date having replaced the dwelling
which served for a quarter of a
century. Furnished with wide
verandahs and containing bright
airy rooms fitted with many con-
veniences which add so materially to
comfort of life in the bush, it is
surrounded by pleasant grounds that
include well kept lawns, carefully
tended flower beds, tennis courts,
and a fernery. The owners of
“Stonington” have carried on the
work of that property for over a
quarter of a century and devoted
themselves whole-heartedly to the
industry which they so worthily
represent. They are members of the
influential association which stands
for the interests of the graziers and
agriculturists of the State. The
eldest brother, Mr. W. A. Maitland
P. Forster, married in the year 1907
Jessie Frances, second daughter of
the late John Neal, whose parents,
hailing from England, settled in
Australia half a century ago, the
late gentleman having been a native
of New South Wales. Plis life was
devoted to the pastoral industry,
which he followed both there and in
Queensland. Twenty years ago he
was the owner of “Congie” Station
in the Charleville district, and later
of “Mossdale,” near Charters Tow-
ers; but will best be remembered
probably as manager of “Millun-
gera” Station, near Cloncurry,
North-western Queensland —a cap-
acity in which he acted for over
fifteen years. Of the union of Mr.
and Mrs. Maitland Forster there is a
family of four sons —Lennox Cecil
Maitland, Neal MacKenzie, Gordon
Glendower and John Douglas Stuart
Forster. The third son of Lieuten-
ant-General Forster, the late Brig-
adier-General George Norman Bowes
Forster, C.M.G., D. 5.0., was born
on October 26, 1872. He rendered
distinguished service to his country
in the Nile Expedition under Lord
Kitchener, for which he was awarded
the Queen’s Medal and the Khedive’s
Medal, with clasps, for Atbara and
Khartoum. He served throughout
the Boer War and was further dec-
orated and mentioned in despatches;

and during the Great War of 1914-18,
in the course of which, on April 4,
1918, he was killed in action, was
awarded the D.S.O. and mentioned
several times in despatches. Lennox
Weston Glendower Forster, the
youngest brother of Messrs. Forster
of “Stonington,” was bom at

1878, and, on the conclusion of his

education, which was conducted at
the United Service College (Kipling’s
Alma Mater), Westward Ho, Devon-
shire, entered the firm of Grey,
Dawes & Co., London. In the
nineties he came to Australia to
engage in pastoral pursuits with his
brothers at “Stonington,” where he
remained until 1904, when he
returned to England and resumed
his connection with the firm of Grey,
Dawes & Co. Subsequently he pro-
ceeded to Eastern Africa and became
associated with the general trading
firm of Smith, MacKenzie & Co.,
of which his uncle, Sir George Mac-
Kenzie, was a controlling member.
In 1911, after four years spent in
Africa, he returned to Australia and
since then has continued to engage
in pastoral pursuits in Northern
Queensland.

making of Australia, and the story
of the family’s achievements in this
the youngest of the continents is all
the more interesting when considered
in association with the deeds and
incidents that mark the history of
the old Scottish line from which it
springs, for surely, the same spirit
which actuated high deeds long
before and after the days of Robert
Bruce, of whom the Cunninghams
or Cunynhams of his time were, by
development of Australia. To obtain
cognizance of the approximate date
of the family’s foundation in Scot-
land we must depend upon tradition,
carefully preserved in the records of
antiquaries of early times. From
such records we learn that the name
originated with one Malcolm, son of
Freskin, whose ready wit baffled the
pursuers of Prince Malcolm, when,
fleeing towards England, the latter
was forced to take refuge in a barn,
where he was effectively concealed
by the straw or hay which the
traditional forbears of the Cunning-
hams forked over him. When the
Prince (renowned in history as the
great King Malcolm Canmore) came
into his kingdom after defeating in
battle his father’s murderer, Mac-
beth, he rewarded the faithful ser-
vice of Malcolm, son of Freskin, by
presenting him with the Thanedom
of Cunynhame. Thus the story,
handed down from remote ages of
how the Cunningham crest and motto
—a sheath fork with the words “Over
Fork Over”—and the name were
acquired. Authentic record carries
forward the history of the family
from the commencement of the 12th
century, when their ancestor, Yerne-
bald, was settled in the West of
Scotland. That their importance
was then fully established is evi-
denced by the fact that Vernebald’s
son and successor, styled “Robertus
filius Vernebaldi,” “made a dona-
tion of the patronage of the Kirk
of Kilmaurs, etc., to the Abbey of
Kelso, about 1153.” The grants
made by Robert, son of Yernebald,
who married Richenda, daughter
great-grandson of the second Robert,
founded the Collegiate Church at
Kilmaurs, “and is renowned in
tradition for his gallant conduct at
the battle of Largs, against the

Danes.” In 1864, Hervey de
Cunynghame received a Charter
from Alexander 111. Scanning the
lists of names representing in almost
unbroken lines the main and
lateral branches of this family,
we find them, together with the
lands granted as rewards for
service, recorded in many cases in
association with some of the most
notable episodes of Scottish history.
The head of the line in the latter
marriage, near kindred, lived in the

by his son, Robert, before 1189.
The next notable representative of
the line, Hervey de Cunynghame,
part of the 14th century, Sir Wil-
liam de Cunyngham of Kilmaurs,
married Eleanor Bruce, daughter of
Alexander Bruce, Earl of Garrick,
and niece of King Robert 1., and

of the original firm Mr. Ernest
Watt, who resides in New South
Wales, and whose name—as was the
late Mr. Gilchrist’s—is prominently

only survivor. The management of
“Woodhouse” devolved upon Mr.
Cunningham, who, from the year
1873, when he sold “Burdekin

in 1898, gave of his best to the devel-
opment of the rich pastures comprised
in the former run. Throughout his
long sojourn in the district he evinced
a public spiritedness which materi-

accomplished valuable work as a
member of the Thuringowa Shire

of the late Edward Cunningham

and Mrs. Ahearne of London) has
been worthily carried on by his son,
Mr. A. H. W. Cunningham of
“Strathmore,” is made evident in
where he immediately became actively
interested in the working of “Wood-
house,” relieving his father, whose
health was rapidly failing, of much
of the arduousness and responsibility
of administration, so that it was not
long before he was engaged in the
practical administration of the prop-

When, taking the place vacated by
the death of his father in the firm of
Gilchrist, Watt & Co., he entered
upon the management with full
powers from his partners, he was con-
fronted by one of the most trying
problems that the industry in Aus-
tralia has encountered—the question
of how to cope with the cattle tick
visitation, then at its worst and
responsible, owing to the resultant
owners’ operations. Mr. Cunning-
ham, therefore, in conjunction with
Messrs. Gilchrist & Watt., purchased
in the year 1902 “Strathmore,” and
the firm under its present title of
Gilchrist, Watt & Cunningham was
established. Both properties were
newly depastured and since then
have been worked under Mr. Cun-
ningham’s management, increasing
in acreage with the acquirement of
additional country as required.

“Strathmore” holding are the Burd-
ekiu, Bowen and Bogie Rivers, to
each of which it has a double front-
age, and water is obtainable in good
supplies all over the area at depths
of 70 ft. Artificial provision has
been made for the stock at points dis-
tant from the rivers by the construc-
tion of several large concrete tanks
and dams, from which the water is
made available by the action of
windmills. Elaborate development has
been carried forward under Mr. Cun-
ningham’s regime , and the property
like most of the surrounding country,
was originally stocked and developed
for sheep, but owing to the detrimen-
tal effect, both on the wool and car-
case of the animal, of the spear grass,
which, with Mitchell and Flinders
grass, constitutes a fair proportion
of the natural fodder produced by
the district, the attempt to carry on
with woolly stock was abandoned,
cattle then being introduced to the
pastures, for which they prove
ideally adapted. The shorthorn
breed is favoured by Mr. Cunning-
ham and the herd consists of 38,000,

expensive proceeding, but necessary
on these coastal plains where ticks
abound—for ensuring the uniformly
excellent condition for which the
“Strathmore” herd is remarkable, it
being proved that cattle allowed to
suffer this pest invariably lose in
weight. Inoculation, of course, pre-
vents them from contracting the

several occasions has been awarded
every prize of importance at the
annual exhibitions of these centres,

nounced by judge and critics as the
best bullock ever shown in the city

reproduced herein. A lover of clean
sport, Mr. Cunningham has figured
prominently in the racing world of
Queensland, and though his horses
have only been entered for perfor-
mances in this State, they were
responsible in three successive years,
for the greatest number of races won
for any owner in the Commonwealth
during the same period. At several
Northern Queensland meetings his
colours have led in every event in the
programme. He won the Derby at
Charters Towers with “Simpel,”

chairman, having held that office in
the Shire Council for the last six
out of the twenty years he has con-
tinued in membership with the body.

The grandfather of the subject of j
this memoir was associated with t
mercantile pursuits in Dublin ere
sailing for the land of the Southern
Cross. He originally settled at
Sydney, remaining there for a period,
but eventually he removed with his
family to the country, where he
became engaged in farming, in
which he was assisted by his son,
the late John Kennedy, who con-
tinued under the paternal rooftree
until the year 1860. Beng then in
his early twenties, he struck out for
himself, bis first independent work
being with a droving party in charge
of stock destined for “Marlborough”
Station, in the Port Curtis district,
Queensland. The trip afforded him
his first real glimpse of the wonder-
ful pastoral resources of his adopted
country and prompted him to devote
his future energies to the great
industry with the rapid progress of
which in the North-eastern State
(then Colony) he was more or less
identified during his subsequent life.
Remaining in Queensland, he was
employed in various station avoca-
tions for a period, gaining meanwhile
a thorough knowledge of stock and
pastoral routine, his experience
eventually resulting in his appoint-

fame. In 1873 he proceeded to
“Wyenbah” on the Bollen and on
leaving that property bought a farm
near Gatton, which he subsequently
sold. Of his early achievements in
connection with the growth of the
pastoral history of Western Queens-
land, one is recorded in the annals
of the town of Dalby, which states
that he departed from that centre
in the year 1875 in charge of a flock
of 10,000 sheep on behalf of Mr.
Donald Gunn, the animals being
destined for a large pastoral area in
the Mitchell district now known as
“Kensington Downs.” These were
the first sheep to arrive on the
western side of the Thomson River.
He formed “Kensington Downs” and
settled there with his family, the
birth of his son, Frederick, the first
white child born west of the
Thomson River eventuating while
he was engaged in the management
of the property. Subsequently he
relinquished his position in order to
enter commercial life. He opened a
store at Budgerygar —later known as
Scarbury though now non-existent as
a settlement, nearly all traces of the
earlier occupation of the land there-
abouts having vanished in conse-
quence of rapidly-changing conditions
in the locality—and carried on as a
trader until the year 1888. In the
meantime, when a grazing leasehold
in the district outlying the town of
Winton was thrown open for selection
he seized the opportunity thus
afforded of re-entering as a land-
owner the industry in which he was
so widely experienced, taking up this
area in the year 1881. He named
the property “Sunny Hills,” and
seven years later added to its acreage
by the acquirement of an adjoining
block called “Highfields,” relinquish-
ing his commercial interests in order
to take over the administration of the
area embraced in the two runs, which
he stocked and carried on as one

he was again the victim of a drought,
the most disastrous ever known in
the history of Australia, thereby

of the country, who, having staked all
they possessed in pastoral enterprise,
were in the course of a couple of
rainless years faced with utter
financial ruin, at a time when bereft
of youth also, they lacked the
incentive to make a fresh start in the
battle of life. In prosperous times
such experiences are apt to be
forgotten with the passing of the
men to whom the nation owes so
much, while only the ultimate success
of those who participated in the
heart-breaking failures incidental to
the opening up and working of virgin
country, is perceived by those who
have not lived through similar
experiences. The late John Kennedy
as the result of his financial reverses,
retired to a small place in the
vicinity of Townsville, which he
worked for a period. Throughout his
career in Queensland his name was
synonymous with uprightness, while
his qualities as a bushman and his
capacity as a pastoralist were
generally recognized by his contem-
poraries, his advice being constantly
sought by less experienced owners of
large pastoral interests as well as by
the smaller selectors of the districts
in which he resided. On February
23 of the year 1916, this sturdy son
of Erin crossed the Great Divide,
leaving a widow, four sons and three
daughters, three sons having pre-
deceased him. He married Frances
Mary Hall, fourth daughter of the
late Lieutenant William Charles
Borlace Wilson, who, with his wife,
mother, and two brothers, Chris-
topher and George, arrived in
Sydney by the sailing ship “Lady
Raffles,” in the year 1839. Lieuten-
ant W. C. B. Wilson was the eldest
son of the late Captain John Alex-
ander Wilson of the Second or
Queen’s Own Regiment, who served
in the expedition to Walcha in 1809
and in the Peninsula Campaign
during 1811-14. Both Lieutenant
Wilson and his brother Christopher
passed through the military college
at Sandhurst and held commissions
in the British army, the elder having
served under the late General

last century. Born at Newcastle,
England, on December 25, 1807, he


was originally attached as an officer
to the 51st Regiment, afterwards
serving as first lieutenant with the
69th and 73rd. During his sojourn
in Greece he was instrumental in
saving the city and inhabitants of
Arta from the ravages of a band of
brigands, his bravery on that
occasion subsequently receiving pub-
lie acknowledgment in the form of
an appreciative address presented to
him by the citizens on May 30, 1833.
In January—three years later—his
valour received further recognition
at the hands of Othon, then King of
Greece, who decorated him with the
Royal Order of Croix de Chevalier.

brother Christopher eventually re-
turned to the old land where the
latter was appointed Treasurer to
the County of Lancaster. Lieutenant
W. C. B. Wilson married Elizabeth,
daughter of the late Charles Hall,
of Hanley, Staffordshire, England.
This lady, who died on March 9,
1902, was a member of a very old
English family of note, one of her
ancestors, Sir John Hall, having
distinguished himself under Edward,
the Black Prince, in the foreign wars
of the fourteenth century. She is

from position to position marking

the information he gave on his
return, we were able to knock out

the very highest order. He is quite

offered most favourable inducements
to practise that profession in New
South Wales, with the result that
both retired from the Army and
voyaged to the young Continent.
where for many years Lieut. Wilson
was engaged as district surveyor,
residing at Grafton, New South
Wales. Grafton was laid out under
his direction and a spot known as
Wilson’s Hill called after him. In
the year 1869 he was appointed as
surveyor to the Mackay district,
residing in that town for many years,
where he gained the respect of all
classes of the community. On his
retirement from active life he pro-
ceeded to Sydney, where at his home,
“Croxton,” he resided until the time
of his death, which occurred on
widow of Mr. John Kennedy being
the fourth daughter. The children
of the old pioneer and his wife have
worthily fulfilled the traditions of
their forbears, two of their sons and
one daughter having served with
distinction during the Great War of
1914-18. Of the former, Neville
Claude Mervyn Kennedy, M.M.,
joined the colours in September,
1914, the month following the
declaration of hostilities between
England and Germany, rendering
distinguished service to the cause of
liberty and honour at Gallipoli,
Egypt, and France, in the course of
which he was twice wounded, first at
Gallipoli and later on the western
front, where he won his decoration.
The official report of the latter
circumstances reads as follows:
equal plane with the comrades with
whom he had fought side by side
and shared the desperate odds
against life in the trenches. He was
returned to Australia after the
Armistice was signed, and is now
engaged in pastoral pursuits. His
younger brother, John R. W.
Kennedy, joined the Australian
Imperial Forces in the year 1916 and
participated in many of the most
brilliant “stunts” accomplished in
France, the success of which achieved
for Australia a glorious and lasting
fame. He was eventually seriously
wounded and spent a considerable
time in hospital ere being finally
returned with his brother to his
native land, where for a lengthy
period he continued under medical
supervision, owing to the acute


nature of his wounds, his jaw having
been fractured by shrapnel. Not to
be outdone in patriotism by her
brothers, and urged by that tender
charity which, with her ability,
renders her so eminently suited for
the noble profession which she repre-
sents, Miss Jessie V. M. Kennedy,
the youngest daughter of the old
pioneer volunteered for military
service while practising as a nurse in
Brisbane. She left Queensland with
a body of troops in the year 1915,
and served with the nursing corps in
Egypt. Subsequently she was trans-
ferred to France, where she bravely
bore the strain of nursing under
conditions impossible of realization
to the uninitiated, her one thought
being to ease the suffering and
brighten, as far as possible, the lives
of those, who, weak and helpless,
having spent themselves in their
country’s cause, were reduced to the
of his father, and on reaching
manhood was associated with the
latter in his various undertakings
until the advent of the drought
which was fraught with such disaster
for the late pioneer and his family,
and in consequence of which he
secured in 1901 a position as over-
seer-in-charge of “Quambetook,” an
out-station of “Kynuna,” then under
the management of Mr. L. G. Reid.
The duties of this position occupied
him for the following six years, at
the end of which he resigned in order
to take managerial control of
“Dimora,” near the township of
Kynuna, on behalf of the late Mr.
Thomas Knox. After two years he
relinquished the managership of
“Dimora” in order to fill a similar
position on “Manfred Downs,” the
old station, “Lara” and “Exmore,”
which his father had formed and
administered forty years previously.

the nearest railway station, was
erected in 1916, according to plans
designed by the owner as the result
of his long familiarity with the
climatic conditions of Western
Queensland. It is a two-storied
structure containing fourteen rooms
furnished with the many appliances
considered necessary for perfecting
a modern pastoral residence, an
electric installation providing light-
ing for the building and the power
for working the many fans with
which it is provided. Space in
proximity to the house has been
devoted to floral cultivation which,
with a tennis court, gives that touch
of homeliness which adds to the charm
of these dwellings so far away from
the largely-populated centres of
civilization. The outbuildings are in
keeping with the other improve-
ments, being all of the most modern
need of a woman’s gentle ministra-
tions. Sister Kennedy’s noble effort
won for her the distinction of the
Royal Red Cross, the highest honour
accorded up to that time to a woman
in the course of the war, and as a
worthy recipient of that decoration
in Queensland, her portrait is
reproduced on page 715. During
her service abroad she acted as
matron in a military hospital in
England and returned in a similar
capacity with troops en route to
Australia following the signing of
the Armistice. Mr. A. G. K.

He held the reins of control at

in conjunction with his wife’s people
he purchased “Bundoran,” a pro-
perty near Richmond. For nearly
two years he continued as manager
and part owner of that proposition,
eventually selling out and purchasing
on his own account “Werna,” a
property consisting of nearly 40,000
acres of lightly-timbered, undulating

his efforts were likely to advance the

causes of patriotism and charity.
While in the far West he served on
the Burke Rabbit Board. In the

progress and development of his

the annals of their country. Mr.

custom of the higher nobility among
the Saxons, to receive and welcome
his guests on a dais in the upper part
of his hall, which is described as
having a recess or bower at its lower
end for his repose. In the same work,
among other quaint records, it is
mentioned that a streamlet wended
its way through the premises to the
Derwent, in which it is said Henricus
baptized his children where the river
flowed through the forest of Koker-
mouth in Cumbru, in the district of
Cumberland, which was part of
the ancient Kingdom of the
Northumbers and of the Brigantes.
It appears, by a deed bearing date
A.D. 859, that this Henricus had
lands granted him by Gulielmi de
Koknat, which lands were called
Koknat and Derwent and were
granted to him from Alice de
Vumeley, daughter of Gulielmi, son
of Latcey, to the said Gulielmi de
Koknat. In Dugdale’s “Monasticon
Anglicanum,” volume 6, page 270,
the designation of Vumeley, daughter
of Gulielmi, reads as "Rumeley,
daughter of Willielmi, son of
Duncani,” the charter in which the
extract appears being in the hand-
writing of Richardum Tolson de
Brydekirke, April, 1665, who states
therein that he was in possession of
the original deed at that time. The
fifth in descent from the first
Henricus, who lived a.d. 859, was
another Henricus, who assumed the
name of "de Tolson,” the latter being
succeeded by Henricus, his son, who
was found guilty of high treason in
'the time of Edward 1., from whom
he subsequently received a free
pardon. The last-mentioned Hen-
ricus held lands appertaining to the
Monastery of Gysburne, in the
County of York, and was granted a
Coat of Arms in the reign of the
first Edward. Thirteenth century
records—for which our authorities
are the historian Bardsley and
M.S.S. in the Guildhall—mention
that John Tolson, a merchant draper
of London, was Mayor of the City
during 1252-2 and Sheriff from 1237-
49 and Alderman for Candlewick
before 1249. On the dissolution of
the Monastery of Gysburne, nearly
two-and-a-half centuries later, 1544,
Henry Tolson, the lineal descendant
of John Tolson, received from
Henry VIII. a grant by patent dated
July 29, in the thirty-fifth year of
that king’s reign (1544), of the
Manor of Brydekirke to himself and
his heirs for ever. Henry Tolson
died in 1553 and left as his
successor Henry Tolson, who was
Sheriff of the County of Cumberland
in the seventeenth year of Eliza-
beth’s reign (1575), and seized of the
Manor of Brydekirke in 1590. The
latter’s grandson, John Tolson, was
Vice-Chancellor and Provost of

much of interest concerning them
and the families with whom they
intermarried prior to 1665 may be
read in "Worthies of England” and
other noted historical works and in a
manuscript written by Sir William
Dugdale in 1664-5 and now contained
in the British Museum. A most
interesting record is to be seen in the
Lady Chapel of Wath Parish Church,
Cumberland, namely, the Tolson’s
Armorial Shield on which is embla-
zoned the Arms of Tolson impaling
those of Bray or Multon—intermar-
ried families. An ancestor of the
Bray family is named on the Battle
Abbey roll, this gentleman having
witnessed the signing of the Charter
in the year 1088. All the documen-
tary evidence, which is fully corrob-
orated, relating to the different
branches of the Tolson family shows
it to have continued in an unbroken
line down to the present day and that
its members were prominently repre-
sented in mercantile life, and in the
professions of the Church, Army, and
Law. The following is quoted from
Burke’s General Armory of England,
Scotland and Ireland, 1857 :—"Arms

ricus de Tolson of Bridekirke, temp.

The first of the line to settle in Aus-
tralia was Joseph Tolson, who hailed
from Wakefield. The date of the
arrival of this gentleman, who was
one of the pioneer pastoralists of
Victoria, is unrecorded, though the
year of his retirement from the indus-
try is set down as 1857. He died
unmarried in Geelong, Victoria, at
the age of eighty-two. The founder
of the Australian family represented
at "Glenmore Downs” was the late
James Tolson, who, born in Dal-
ton, Parish of Kirkheaton, in the
year 1841, was the eldest son
of George Senior Tolson. The late

gentleman arrived in the country
with his wife and the children then
born to him in the late seventies but
shortly afterwards proceeded to New
Zealand, where his family also accom-
panied him. Deciding after an
absence of six months, that Queens-
land offered better conditions for
investment, he returned to the Conti-
nent and in due course purchased
from the late R. Christensen, of
“Lammermoor,” a block of land from
old “Uanda” Station. Leaving his
wife and children in a residence near
Breakfast Creek, Brisbane —a local-
ity then so little populated that no
other dwelling was in sight of their
house—he immediately entered upon
the work of forming his property, the
acreage of which he more than
doubled by selection of virgin
country which thenceforward com-
posed the major portion of the 2,000
square miles that for many years com-
prised the “Uanda” run. His first
home here was a bark and slab erection
which it was one of his first concerns
to make habitable for Mrs. Tolson,
who was desirous of sharing, as far as
might be, the vicissitudes with which
her husband was faced in a new land.
As illustrative of the unaccustomed
hardships that were pluckily and
cheerfully faced by our pioneers’
wives, it may be of interest to men-
tion that Mrs. Tolson with her four
children—two boys and two girls—
accomplished the 600 miles journey
from Roma—then the nearest point
of railway communication with her
destination—to "Uanda” in a wag-
gonette, accompanied by two wag-
gons for the conveyance of house-
hold goods, stores, and other necessi-
ties. Only those who have driven long
distances across the vastness of the
Queensland bush, urging their horses

as well as might be the attacks of
myriads of sand (lies and mosquitoes,
and other numerous discomforts, can


realize tlie trials of the journey accom-
plished by Mrs. Tolson. However,
it is to colonists of the type of this
lady and her husband that the rapid
growth of civilization in the country
is due. Early in his pastoral career
Mr. Poison admitted Mr. William J.
B. Cameron into partnership, the
latter having overlanded from the
Brisbane River the first cattle depas-
tuned on his property. The connec-
tion between Messrs Tolson and
Cameron continued for ten years, at
the end of which Mr. Tolson pur-
chased the latter’s interests and
became sole owner of “Uanda.” In
1889 he divided the run and called
the lower end “Corinda,” devoting
married Mary, daughter of John
Haig, of “Lascelles Hall,” Kirk-
heaton, who was a Justice of the
Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for
the County of York and Mayor of
Scarborough. He had a family of
two sons and five daughters, the sons
and two of the daughters (Mrs. J.
C. Snell, of Sydney, and Mrs.
Leslie Davidson, of Fiji) having
been bom in England, while the
youngest members of the family, who
are married to Mr. Herbert Collier,
son of one of the most noted pioneers
of both the grazing industry and the
railway construction of the State;
Mr. Gilbert Coles, a well-known
Sydney business man; and Mr.
completed his collegiate course at the
Brisbane Grammar School. When in
his eighteenth year he became a
jackaroo on “Lammermoor” Sta-
tion, then owned by its founder,
the late Robert Christenson, and
managed by Mr. Horace Williams,
who, at the time of writing,
is engaged in the administration of
“Telemon” Station, on the Flinders.
Under the very able tuition of the
last-mentioned gentleman, who is a
well-known stock expert and pastoral
manager, he quickly obtained a grip
of the industry, and by the time he
had arrived at years of manhood
was considered sufficiently experi-
enced to undertake the duties of
this area to sheep. Two years later
he enlarged his sheep interests by the
purchase of “Aramac” Station, and
some idea of the success which atten-
ded bis efforts in both phases of the
industry will be gathered from the
fact that in the middle nineties his
three properties depastured over
30,000 cattle and 380,000 sheep.
However, he shared the fate of so
many pastoralists of the period, los-
ing both properties and stock
through the drought that ushered in
the late nineties, and continued to
devastate the country until 1903. He
spent the last years of his life in
retirement. The late James Tolson

World in the early seventies, being
then in his childhood. He was
primarily educated in Sydney, and

father’s property. Realizing the
value of a commercial training as
part of the equipment as a grazier,
he temporarily relinquished pastoral
work to enter the firm of Burns,
Philp & Co., in Brisbane, then under
the personal management of Mr.
(now Sir Robert) Philp, with whom
he continued to gain business experi-
ence for eighteen months. On his
return to the West he was placed
in charge of the sheep at “Corinda,”
where he remained until 1894, when
he was promoted to the management
of “Aramac” Station. He relin-

from the family, and immediately
took control of “Cambridge Downs,”
on the Flinders River, which pro-
perty he administered on behalf of
the Australian Estates and Mortgage
Co. until the year 1901, when the
outbreak of the South African War
caused him to volunteer for service
at the front. Shortly after joining
the forces he was given a commission
with the Commonwealth Horse under
Colonel (now Major-General) Sir
Harry Cheval, and in the course of
the campaign in Africa saw service
in the Orange Free State, Natal,
and the Transvaal. On the conclusion
with Mr. M. Ryan, he purchased the
interests of his former partners and
carried on under the new arrange-
ment until 1915, when he became,
by purchase, sole owner. “Glenmore

has been carried on as a sheep pro-
position, embraces nearly 100,000

in his college days and a wildc-
hearted supporter of the sport of
kings throughout his whole career as

with the pastoral industry as
manager of “Vindex,” which was
then owned by the Chirnside family.
“Vindex” was sold in 1906, and in
that year Mr. Tolson acquired an
interest in “La Plata,” a sheep pro-
perty near Blackall, which he con-
ducted as managing partner for four
years, eventually selling out to his
partner. He next purchased an
interest in “Glenmore Downs,” in
which venture he was associated
with the family of the late W. H.
Campbell, on whose and his own
behalf he managed the property

on October 9, 1882. He is the fifth

son of the late Thomas Bryce, who
'founded the Australian branch of
the family now represented at
"Colston.” The last-mentioned
gentleman arrived in the then
newly-created colony of Queensland
from Glasgow in the year 1862 by
the "Golden City.” Of ancient
Scottish lineage and a family which
was distinguished for its association
with various forward movements
that have marked the passage of
later centuries in the old world, he
was the eldest son of the founder of
the famous Glasgow publishing
house of David Bryce & Sons, and
counted amongst his ancestors and
various of their descendants men
whose parts gained for them titled
honours. The Bryces were identified
with the printing press almost from
the birth of this powerful medium
of communication and were also
notably represented in commercial
life during successive generations of
their line. Mr. Thomas Bryce was
educated at the Glasgow Academy,
and when yet in his teens acquiesced
to an arrangement made chiefly on
account of his then indifferent state
of health that he should visit
Queensland with the view of there
finally settling in the pastoral
industry. With "Purbrook Downs,”
a property in the Springsure district,
as his destination, he accordingly
left Scotland and in due course was
installed at that station as jackeroo,
in which capacity he continued to
gain what is termed "colonial
experience’' for some years. In
1866, being satisfied that his
knowledge of stock and the condi-
tions of his adopted country
warranted his entry into the industry
on his own account, he acquired i
large grazing area in the Moreton
district, to which he gave the name
of "Burnside,” and which, mainly
comprised of leased land, included
7,000 acres of freehold within its
boundaries. Here he carried on
amongst the pioneer pastoralists of
the time, meanwhile varying his
interests by purchasing a carrying

business from a Mr. Drake, con-
jointly administering both branches
of enterprise until, with the growth
and development of the metropolis,
the latter expanded to an import-
ance which necessitated more
exclusive control. He accordingly
disposed of "Burnside” and gave his
sole attention to what is still the
most important concern of its kind
in the State, the firm of Bryce Ltd.
Members of the family still retain
an interest in this old-established
business, and the gentleman under
review was actively connected with
it for some time. The late Thomas
Bryce was recognized as one of the
best-known men of the time in
connection not only with pastoral
and commercial pursuits but with
the early gold and coal mining
industries. He was one of the early
holders of the Commission of the
Peace in Queensland, and for forty
years held the office of District
Registrar of Births, Marriages and
Deaths in the Caboolture district;
and was also Clerk of the Caboolture
Shire for a considerable period,
retaining this then important office
until the press of his city interests
caused him to resign it. His earliest
pastoral acquirement in 1866 was
shortly followed by his marriage to
Janet, second daughter of the late
John Menzies, by whom he had a
family of seven sons and two
daughters, all of whom were born
at “Burnside.” In the year 1912
this fine old pioneer crossed the
Great Divide, having completed
nearly seventy years of a life marked
by splendid attainments, the results
of which yet live to testify to his
worth and as an example to those
who would also carve a career of
successful and useful citizenship.
Mr. Frank Charles Bryce was
educated primarily at Stoney Creek,
Caboolture, completing his studies
at the Normal School, Brisbane.

River. On reaching man’s estate
he became bead stockman at “Apis
Creek,” a station then in the
ownership of the McConnel family,
and carried out the duties of the
post until attaining the age of
twenty-three, when his ability was
recognized by a well-known pioneer
of the Port Curtis district, the late
O. C. J. Beardmore, former owner
of “Tooloombah,” who offered him
the management of that property,
which was devoted to horned stock.
He was manager of “Tooloombah”
for nearly three years ©re finally
deciding to make himself familiar
with the methods of running a sheep
property. With this object he took
a post on “Barcoorah,” near Aramac
and was subsequently occupied
among the stock on “Reedy Creek,’’
an out-station of “Bowen Downs.”
From “Reedy Creek” he removed to
“Brookwood,” where he continued
as overseer until an offer from the
firm of Bryce Ltd., caused him to
abandon pastoral pursuits for a
time. During his association with
1912 he again became identified
with the grazing industry, tak-
ing up the block of country which
comprises “Colston,” to the improve-
ment and development of which he
has since assiduously devoted himself.
“Colston” was originaly a portion
of the area known as “Warrnambool
Downs.” Its character is indicated
by alternating plains and scrub
lands and an abundant growth of
Mitchell, Flinders, and spinifex
grasses, the scrub being largely
composed of edible varieties. The
run is watered by Bluebush Creek
and a number of wells that are most
efficiently equipped with up-to-date
windmills, tanks, and troughing.
The homestead, which is situated
about forty-five miles from the
railway town of Winton, is a very
pretty, modern, and homelike
structure of a style eminently suited
to western climatic conditions. An

NORMAN RICHARDS, J.P.,
“Mount Hillalong,” Nebo, was born
at “Marmadilla” Station, on
January 1, 1880, and is the eldest
son of the late Henry Richards, who
MR. H. RICHARDS.
was one of the early pioneers of
Central Queensland, having settled
on what was then “Springsure”
Station in the year 1861. The late
gentleman purchased “Springsure,”
in conjunction with his uncle, from
the explorer Landshorough, and a
permanent spring on the property
suggested its name, as also that of
the township Springsure which was
later surveyed on the site. Mr.
Henry Richards was a native of the
Hunter River district, New South
Wales, and the year of his birth was
1841. He was brought up to
pastoral life on a station owned by
his father in the Hunter River
district, and which afterwards, when
it came under his own administra-
tion, he sold. From the Hunter
River he proceeded to the New Eng-
land district and formed “Winter-
bourne” Station, near Armidale,
where he remained until 1861, in
which year he overlanded to Central
Queensland, having crossed the
Dawson after leaving the Burnett
district, then the Expedition Range,
and finally arrived in the Comet
watershed. His settlement was
slightly antecedent to the advent of
many pastoralists from the South to
occupy recently taken up land in the
district, and Mr. Richards’ contem-
poraries of these very early days
included Messrs. P. F. Macdonald
of “Fernlees” (who explored and took
up much of the country hereabouts),
Thompson of “Orion Downs,” Greg-
son of “Rainworth,” Mclntosh of
“Wealwandangie,” Kelman of
“Meteor Downs,” and Wills of
‘Cullin-la-ringa.” The country was
all stocked with sheep in those days
and their wool was sent in the grease
in drays to Rockhampton, 180 miles
distant, at a cost of £4 per bale.
Blacks were a dangerous force with
which no chances could be taken, as
shown by their massacre of Mr. Wills
of “Cullin-la-ringa” who had
always treated them with trust and
kindness— and of all those who were
with him. The late Henry Richards
removed to the Nebo district in the
year 1881 and formed “Mt.
Pleasant” Station, which, four years
later, he sold to Mr. Allan Williams,
who re-named it “Burrenbring.” On
disposing of “Mt. Pleasant” he
purchased “Homevale,” near Mt.
Britten, a mining township which
was then flourishing. On “Home-
vale” he spent many years in cattle-
raising and agricultural pursuits,
and eventually introduced sheep to
the pastures. In the year 1910 he
sold both stock and property, and
Mr. A. Williams became the owner
of “Homevale,” Mr. Richards then
retiring to Sydney, where he pur-
chased a home and lived for a time.
Subsequently, in conjunction with
his youngest son, he entered the
dairying industry in New South
Wales, purchasing a farm on Glen-
nies Creek, which continued to be
his headquarters until the time of
his death in the year 1918. For
some time he acted as Chairman and
as Clerk of the Nebo Divisional
Board, which was formed through
his influence, the shire having been
proclaimed in the early part of the
year 1883. He married a daughter of
the late 'Rev. Edward Holland, a
native of Dublin, Ireland, who
became one of the founders of the
Presbyterian Church of New South
Wales. The late Edward Holland
was horn in the year 1819. While
still in his teens he went to England,
and after studying there for the

ministry, was ordained in company
with the renowned explorer, David
Livingston, whose room-fellow he
was in those early days. After their
ordination in 1840 Mr. Livingston
went to Africa and Mr. Holland to
Jamaica. He devoted eleven years
to mission work among the emanci-
pated negro slaves, but in the early
fifties came to Australia, taking up
his work at Port Macquarie in 1853.
His parish covered a large district
embracing three of the northern
rivers, and his work was necessarily
of the most strenuous order. From

said to have proved the possibilities
of sugar-growing on the northern
rivers of New South Wales. In 1869
he was appointed to the parish
embracing Campbelltown and Liver-
pool, where he laboured until 1875,
when he received a call to Grenfell.
Prom Grenfell, he was appointed to
Dubbo (1877), which was the last
scene of his active ministerial work,
which occupied him here for nine
years, though he held office as senior
minister of Dubbo until his death,
which occurred at “Dubboville,”
Burwood, on July 12, 1895. The
reverend gentleman married Mary,
eldest daughter of Robert Haldane
Scott, of “Wooden,” Kelso, Scot-
land, who worthily shared the
labours of her pioneer husband. To
Mr. Henry Richards were born three
sons and three daughters. Of the
sons, the second, Harold, is now
managing “Mt. Murchison” and
other properties in New South Wales
for Mr. Sidney Kidman; and the
youngest, Leslie Scott, is engaged in
agrarian pursuits on his property at
Glennies Creek, near Singleton, in
the Mother State. Mr. Norman
Richards of “Mount Hillalong”
received his education under the
paternal roof tree, “Homevale,” and
at Burwood School, Sydney. On
concluding his studies he entered the
mining industry, which occupied his
energies until the year 1900, when
he decided to apply himself to
pastoral pursuits. In the year 1903
he was qualified to undertake the
management of “Mount Hillalong”
when that position was offered him.
It fell to him to pull this property up
after the severe drought that ended
in the locality in 1902, and he had
been in control only three years when
he took advantage of an opportunity
then presented to him of purchasing
“Mount Hillalong” on terms. From
1905 onwards he progressed steadily
in the industry, hard work and good
seasons soon placing him on a solid
footing. About ten years later the
drought of 1914-15 proved a big set-
back and called for even greater
effort on his part, but, in view of the
great need of the Empire in the
tremendous struggle in which she
engaged from 1914 to 1918, he set
aside his private interests and only
awaited the arrival of his brother,
Harold, who resigned from the
management of “Tilberoo,” Sidney
Kidman’s station near Cunnamulla,
to take charge of his pastoral affairs
before enlisting with the A.I.F. He
joined up in 1916, and was shortly
despatched to Egypt with Light
Horse reinforcements. He partici-
pated in the Gaza engagement and
in operations conducted in Egypt and
around Palestine, and remained on
active service until the signing of the
Armistice. After a short period in
England he returned to Queensland
and “Mount Hillalong,” which, by
the way, is one of the original
pastoral properties of the district
outlying Nebo. Sheep were origin-
ally the mainstay of the run, but
the countr-y not proving suitable
for woolly stock the flocks were
replaced with cattle. Mr. Richards
specializes in red polls, and from an
extensive experience recommends
this class of cattle. He also raises
good equine stock, and at time of
writing runs about 300 horses (mostly
blood) on “Mount Hillalong,” such
as he does not require on the station
being readily disposed of for the
India market and locally. His love
of a good horse and clean sport is
evidenced in his successful participa-
tion in the sport of kings at different
Central and Northern Queensland
meetings, his colours —blue and green
(also the colours of the regiment of
which he was lately a member) —
having on frequent occasions caught
the judge’s eye. The Mount Hilla-
long” homestead was erected over
half a century ago, and still does
service as a comfortable dwelling.
It occupies a picturesque site in view
of the Denham Range, 50 miles north
of Nebo and 120 miles from Mackay,
which is the nearest centre of sea
and railway communication. Mr.
Richards assists in local government
as a councillor of the Nebo Shire,
having been returned by the rate-
payers at the head of the poll at the
election of July 23, 1921. In other
ways, also, he is active in promoting
the welfare of the district. lie was

ADAM BLACK, J.P., “Pajingo”
Station, via Charters Towers, was
born at “Heatha House, ” Northum-
berland, on February 20, 1859, and
is a son of the late Robert Black, a
MR. ROBERT BLACK.
member of a very old English family
which had been identified with
agrarian and grazing pursuits near
the Scottish border for centuries.
MR. A. R. P. BLACK.
Mr. Black’s forbears had their home
near Wooler—long the scene of a
favourite gipsy encampment—where
his people engaged in wool-growing,
depasturing, chiefly, the breed of
sheep known as the Cheviot. Plis
mother’s folk, the Scotts, were also of
old standing in the locality. The
branch of the old Northumbrian line
which is represented at “Pajingo,”
was founded by the owner of that
property on his advent to the land of
the Southern Cross on November 1,
1882. Educated at West Kilbride
School, Ayrshire, Mr. Black went
from his Alma Mater to a post in the
City of Glasgow Bank, with the view
of becoming au fait with the
intricacies of business and of
equipping himself with commercial
knowledge that might be applied to
such calling as he should eventually
decide to follow. On reaching man’s
estate, he resigned from this Bank’s
service to enter the office of the late
Earl of Linlithgow—then Lord
Hopetoun—with whom he continued
for over a year. During 1881-2,
while in the employ of the late
Robert Dewar (Live Stock Salesman
in Ayr), he became acquainted with
Mr. Mcllwraith, father of the late
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, who was so
prominently known in the political
history of his time as Queensland’s
Premier and the holder of different
portfolios in the erstwhile Colony.
Through the first-named gentleman
he learned something of the poten-
tialities of the young country where
his sons, John, Andrew and Thomas,
had already become men of mark,
and was sufficiently impressed to
make up his mind to carve a career
abroad. With the land in view as
the basis of his future livelihood and
a sturdy optimism that prompted in
him a determination that lack of
effort would be no bar to his eventual
independence, he set out by the
“Scottish Knight,” (Capt. Lawson,
sailing from Glasgow on July 12,
1882), a sailing ship owned by the
Mcllwraith Company, for “Pitzroy
Yale” Station, Northern Queensland,
where, through the office of the same
Company, had been secured for him
the position of book keeper. Land-
ing at Mackay at the date already
recorded, he proceeded to his first
home in his adopted country, which
at that time was held by the Berkel-
man family, who owned vast pastoral
interest in Australia and the founder
of which was one of the pioneers of
the industry in Central Queensland.
Shortly after his arrival here Mr.
Black was deputed to take a number
of emigrants to “Listowel Downs.”
At this station he was appointed
second overseer, a capacity in which
he was afforded considerable
experience among sheep and the op-
portunity of adding to the knowledge
already acquired on the family acres
in Northumberland, but chiefly in
Ayrshire, Scotland—of the then

at that time was in the ownership of
the late Donald A\ allace. With the
bieaking up of the 1884 drought and
the acquirement of Terrick-Terrick’
and its out-stations by the Australian
Estates and Mortgage Co., Mr.
lack relinquished his position and
i(-turned to New South Wales, ■where
he \\as engaged in pastoral work

to again visit Queensland by the late
John Dickens, who was manager of
"Terrick-Terrick” during the asso-

review with that property. At Mr.
though Mr. Black and those under
him carried out the work inci-
dental to their positions without
trouble. He left “Elderslie” to take
over the management of “Lolworth,”
a Northern Queensland property, on
behalf of Messrs. J. & W. D. Clarke.
His administration of this station
lasted for ten years, and during that
period he was faced with some diffi-
cult times, the most disastrous being
due to the cattle tick, which seriously
depleted the herds of the State ere
the preventative remedy of inocula-
tion was discovered and applied.
“Lolworth” was among the first runs

Northern studs and inaugurating
operations that have resulted in the
run’s increased carrying capacity,
and the production of a good supple-
mental water supply. Much of the
structural improvement of the prop-
erty, embracing sub-divisional fenc-
ing, etc., has been effected under his
direction. “Pajingo,” at its most
northerly jroint, lies some 60 miles
from Charters Towers, and, on
coming into Mr. Black’s possession,
embraced an area of 600 square
miles, over 200 of this acreage hav-
ing been resumed by the government
Dickens’ invitation he set out to fill
a post on “Elderslie” Station, and
en route to his destination learned of
his former chief’s death. However,
his services were retained under the
altered management and he contin-
ued to be associated with the prop-
erty for four years, during that
period filling at different times the
positions of acting manager, book
keeper and overseer. During his
final year at “Elderslie,” the big

to be infested with this pest, which,
with the-resultant fever, reduced its
herd from 20,000 to 6,000 head. Mr.
Black held the reins of control for
Messrs. Clarke at “Lolworth” until
the sale of the property, shortly after
this event, in 1901, joining forces
with Mr. W. J. Pauli in the purchase
of “Pajingo” Station. The develop-
ment of “Pajingo” has since engaged
his energies, and he has carried on the
work with vigour and a keen know-
ledge of stock and the conditions
under which industry may best be
forwarded, considerably improving
the herd by the introduction of
for purposes of closer settlement. It
has a carrying capacity for about
12,000 head of cattle, its herd, which
was originally founded by the pre-
vious owner of the run, the late
Frederick Hamilton, being now
approximately estimated at that
strength. Good horses are also bred
on the property but only with a view
to station requirements. Typically
representative of the pastoral dwell-
ings that embody the associations,
several of them historical, of very
many years, the “Pajingo” home-
stead, as it is approached, breaks
upon the view as an irregular


rambling structure set in the midst
of an old garden and sheltered by a
mass of foliage. The garden itself is
the home of many choice blooms and
ornamental shrubs. Constructed with
due regard to utility, the outbuild-
ings, yards and concomitants of a
pastoral holding are up-to-date and
conveniently situated; and the same
attention which has brought “Pa-
jingo” into line with the most pro-
gressive runs of the locality has
achieved similar results on “Corea,”
the out-station, where stands a roomy
dwelling of modern architecture.
While dwelling upon the old time
charm of the “Pajingo” home, it is
fitting to mention the kindly hospi-
tality with which its name is associ-
ated, for the host and hostess most
perfectly carry out the traditions
established by our pioneer pastoral-
ists in this respect. Mr. Black’s

maternal side from the Olivers,
Lairds of “Langraw,” who are also
referred to in old records as land-
owners. Sir Walter Scott, famous
author of the Waverley Novels, was
related to Mrs. Black’s forbears,
several of whom have distinguished
themselves in the world of letters.
The first Dalgleish to establish him-
self in Australia was Mrs. Black’s
uncle, John, who was one of six
brothers who settled in the country
in the early days; Peter, her father,
having been the youngest but one of
this group. Three of her uncles were

and (he Old Miners’ Rest Race Club,

first schools, churches, and other
public buildings. Mrs. Black went
as a bride to “Elderslie,” and,
imbued with the sense of how much
every good woman’s work and
influence counts in the building of a
nation, proved herself from the out-
set a helpful wife and comrade, and
a neighbour who could be counted
upon in all emergencies in a land
where bush homes are often
separated by vast distances. To
nurse the sick, to make a home as it
should be for husband and children,
to study the wonders which nature
hides in the depths of scrub and
forest and become acquainted with
the bird and animal life of the bush
surrounding her home, were affairs

belief that the country is best served

depends largely upon the develop-
ment of its pastoral resources,
prompts him to actively interest him-
self in those movements calculated
to encourage enterprise in this
direction, and to protect those whose
brains, energies, and financial assets
are invested in the land. For several
years he was chairman of the
Charters Towers branch of the
Central and Northern Graziers'
Association. He married in the year
1890 Jane, daughter of the late
Peter Dalgleish, J.P., who during
his lifetime, was one of the most pro-
minent citizens of the Boort district
of Victoria. Though pre-eminently

industry —the late gentleman is

Isle removed to Victoria, and later
formed a sheep station across the
River Murray near Wilcannia, which
he sold on the finding of gold at
Ballarat to his cousin (who was the
Hon. John Crozier, of Adelaide). As
a digger and mining man he had only
moderate success, but as a pioneer
and progressive farmer at a place he
named “Bothwell Springs,” he had
much to do with the early history of

unending source of interest, and the
results have been given to those
desirous of adding to the general

career at the latter academy. He

DAVID CANNON, J.P., of
“Como,” Yeronga, Brisbane, and
"Newlands,” Longreach, was born at
Lancefield, Victoria, on August 10,
1861, and is the second son of the
MR. J. CANNON
late James Cannon, a native of
Dumfriesshire, Scotland, in which
country his progenitors were re-
garded as well-to-do farmers for
many generations, having been
amongst the earliest residents of
their own land in that part of Scot-
land. Mr. James Cannon made his
advent to Australia in the late
forties, and is recorded as having
farmed his own acres in Victoria as
far back as the early fifties and as
being a well-known agriculturalist in
the Lancefield district. He lived for
well over eighty years, and at the
time of his death in Melbourne in
the year 1911 was survived by two
generations of the family which he
had founded in the land of the
Southern Cross. His descendants
have just reason to venerate the
memory of the fine old Scotchman
who threw in his lot with those other
hardy and intrepid spirits whose
united exertions in developing the
virgin soil of their adopted land laid
the foundation of one of her greatest
industries. He was survived by his
widow, one son, and one daughter.
The last-mentioned resides in Vic-
toria with her mother, who at time
of writing is approaching her
ninetieth year. Mr. David Cannon
received the rudiments of his educa-
tion at the local school at Lancefield,
and later entered that old and well-
known institution, the Scotch Col-
lege, Melbourne, which has sent so
many of her students into the world
of letters, arts, and industry, in
which several fields they have
achieved prominence and reflected
much credit on their Alma Mater.
Choosing the land as the basis of his
future career he concluded his s nol-
astic course at the age of eighteen
and immediately went into possession
of a farm in the South Gippsland
district, which was purchased and
presented to him by his father.
After working this property for
about two years he was prompted by
the spirit of adventure and the
appeal of the wide spaces of his
native land to seek an outlet for that
restless energy so characteristic of
MR. DAVID CANNON.
high-spirited youth, and returning
his farm to his father persuaded the
latter to give him the necessary fin-
ancial assistance in order to try his
luck in the Queen State. He set out
in March, 1881, and arrived in Bris-
bane with several letters of introduc-
tion to prominent Queenslanders,
but preferring to carve his own way
immediately entrained to Toowoom-
ba, where he took up work in the
timber industry, and for the follow-
ing six months was engaged in the
severe labour of log-cutting to
supply a local saw mill. For this
work, as events turned out, he
received no remuneration, his
employer becoming insolvent at the
termination of the above-mentioned
period. Nothing daunted he
proceeded to look for employment as
a station hand, and arriving at
“Felton,” the home of the late
Honourable James Tyson, secured
there a post as boundary rider at a
salary of £4O a year. He remained
at “Felton” for a period during
which he gained a further knowledge
of the conditions jirevailing in the
Queensland bush, and subsequently
set out from that station with a mob
of cattle en route to “Canobie,” in
the Gulf country. On arrival there,
wishing to test the possibilities of
the Far North, and, in his own
words, “ready to sink or swim with
his judgment,” he relinquished his
earlier post and obtained employ-
ment as a stockman on “Clonagh,” a
property then owned by Mr. Reid.
Eventually he rose to the post of
cattle overseer on that estate, and
was still occupied with the duties of
his position when the Croydon gold
rush eventuated, a circumstance
which determined him to try his luck
in the mining industry. Resigning
his position on “Clonagh” he pro-
ceeded to the newly-opened field and
entered upon the life of a prospector
and opened up a claim or two. His
efforts, however, met with but little
encouragement at the hands of
Dame Fortune, for at the end of

ing lure had bereft him of the
savings of seven years. Returning to

the owner of that station as drover-
in-charge of a mob of 1,000 bullocks,
which he was commissioned to travel
overland to a station in New South
Wales, the propei’ty of a brother of
his employer. The latter paid a
high compliment to Mr. Cannon’s
integrity by instructing him to take
delivery from himself , thus accepting
his word as to the safe delivery of
the mob without question. He
remained some time on the roads,
eventually travelling to Longreach,
where he met the lady who is now
his wife, and was then the owner of
the Commercial Hotel in that town,
and to whom he was married shortly
afterwards. For the following six
years he filled the role of boniface
of the Commercial Hotel, at the end
of which time, wearying of town life
and the hustle of business he decided
to interest himself in pastoral pur-
suits. Letting the hotel property on
lease he took up, in conjunction with
his wife, a landed property called
“Longford,” in the vicinity of
Jundah, this venture being made at
the beginning of the drought which
started on its devastating course in
1899 and continued to work havoc for
the following three years. Though
Mr. and Mrs. Cannon lost heavily as
a result of this visitation they
ultimately achieved success through
the exercise of those qualities of
industry, thrift, and perseverance,
which enabled them to overcome the
obstacles in their path, and by the

stock and modern methods of station
development gained by the subject
of our notice during his long
connection with the industry.
Whilst engaged in the development
of “Longford” their hotel property
in Longreach was destroyed by fire
and resulted in a heavy financial
loss, necessitating the subsequent
return of husband and wife to that
centre in order to reorganize the
business. While again personally
conducting the Commercial Hotel
other pastoral properties were pur-
chased, developed, and sold, and
eventually, in 1913, Mr. Cannon
took up two blocks of pastoral land
aggregating about 40,000 acres
which comprise “Newlands,” and
which were formerly part of the
original “Vergemont” Station; also
a block of some 20,000 acres on
Trotter Creek, developing the whole
for the wool-growing industry.
Owing to the depredations of
dingoes, however, he was obliged to
relinquish his earlier intention and
devote the properties to cattle,
shorthorn being the type favoured.
“Newlands,” which is situated about
100 miles south-west of Longreach,
is a well-improved run, one-half of
which is composed of rolling downs

remainder consisting of a superior

ALFRED ARTHUR PAINE,
J.P., “Glenyarra,” near Bowen,
Northern Queensland, and of “Hla-
long,” Brandon, was born near
Morpeth, a town on the Hunter
MR. A. A. PAINE.
River, New South Wales, on Febru-
ary 21, 1856, and educated at St.
Paul’s Grammar School, West
Maitland, under the guidance of the
late Rev. W. K. Colyer, who shaped
the minds of many who were des-
tined to become pioneers of vast and
previously unoccupied portions of
the great Continent, and by their
fine pastoral achievements, to
increase the prestige of their native
land and the great Empire of which
it forms a part. He is the youngest
son of the late Charles Lavender
Paine, who had a long career as a
nautical captain and was descended
from an old British seafaring family,
which, in the late gentleman’s early
lifetime, had its headquarters in
Sussex, England. Captain Paine
received his first command when
still a youth and navigated to Aus-
tralian waters the S.S. "Thistle',’’
one of the first steamers to be floated
by the old Australian Steam Navi-
gation Company. He continued in
the service of the same Company
until the time of his death, having
for some time previously been resi-
dent in Maitland, where, after his
demise, his family continued to
dwell. His youngest son, Mr. A. A.
Paine of "Glenyarra,” was an infant
when left fatherless. On completing
his studies at St. Paul’s in the year
1872 he entered the pastoral indus-
try, being appointed to the post of
overseer at “Walhallow” Station,
then under the management of his
eldest brother and in the ownership
of Messrs. Christian Bros., at that
time a well-known pioneering fam-
ily of the Liverpool Plains district,
New South Wales, and afterwards,
of Queensland. His experience at
“Walhallow” covered most phases of
pastoral enterprize and the year
1880 found him on the roads with
cattle for the foundation of a station
on the O’Shanassy River, in the far
North-west of Queensland, the
journey covering 2,000 miles and
occupying a period of fourteen
months. The perils of such a
journey are scarcely realized by
those who to-day reap the benefits
purchased by the hardihood, cour-
age and resource, and oftentimes
the lives, of such men whose
careers constitute the subjects of
these memoirs. Those comprising
parties who drove cattle over vast
distances in Northern Queensland
during and before the eighties had
to be on the alert against surprise
attacks from hostile natives, were
constantly in danger from severe
elemental disturbances, hindered by
floods and the boggy nature of the
country through which they were
forced to travel their stock; and
they frequently suffered from the
effects of exposure and hard fare.
The station formed by Mr. Paine
on the O’Shanassy became known
as “Riversleigh,” and after its
formation he returned to New
South Wales and became engaged in
contract droving, being continually
on the roads with stock for the three
years spread over 1883-6. He was
offered in 1886 the management of
“Chatsworth,” a run situated on
the Burke River, near Boulia.
Accepting this position, he was
accompanied to this far-western
Queensland station by his wife, who
was then the only white woman
within a radius of 100 miles Mr.
Paine remained in control of “Chats-
worth” until the end of the year
1888, when he proceeded to the Ken-
nedy district and undertook the man-
agement of various properties, includ-
ing “Lochinvar,” owned by the late
Edward Mytton. Subsequently, on
his own and Mr. Mytton’s behalf he
established a butchering business in
Ayr, and the connection between the
two continued until the death of the
latter, when Mr. J. H. Rae joined
Mr. Paine in the venture. The gen-
tleman under review continued to
personally carry on the business in
Ayr until the year 1918, when he
entered into partial retirement, hav-
ing in the meantime secured impor-
tant landed interests in the outlying
country. Among his pastoral pos-
sessions is "Glenyarra,” which, in
1912, he purchased as a freehold of
7,000 acres. Subsequently, he took
up a number of blocks on the
resumed portion of “Inkerman” run,
and these adjoining his first acquire-
ment, were amalgamated with "Glen-
yarra,” bringing the area to an acre-
age of some 20,000, and into line
with the most desirable properties
of the district. Depasturing on an
average about 2,000 shorthorns and
horses to the number of 100, the run
is well subdivided for the conven-
ient handling of the stock, which

Queensland and became associated
with his father in his business at Ayr
and Brandon and in his pastoral en-

Paine, Sen., until the year 1916,
when the great need for man power
to guard the liberty of the Empire
and our shores from foreign invas-
ion during the Great War of 1914-18,
caused him to volunteer for service
abroad with the Australian Imper-
ial Forces. As a member of the 11th
Light Horse, he participated in the
campaigns conducted in Egypt,
Palestine and Syria, his period of
service being protracted until Aug-
ust 1919, owing to the Egyptian
disturbances which continued for
some time after the Armistice was
signed. When he finally returned to
Australia and received his discharge,
he took over the management of
“Glenyarra” and the partnership
in that property which his father
offered him. Mr. Leslie Paine is a
supporter of various forms of field
sport. His marriage occurred in
1916, on the eve of his departure for

of the late Henry Cashin, who was a

oped as to make evident to the far-
seeing its enormous resources and

engages in agrarian pursuits in New
South Wales. On the distaff side
of the house the Messrs. Templeton
are descended from the old Mackay
and Ainslie families, and several of
their progenitors have been pro-
minently associated with the British
army. Their mother was a daughter
of a Lieut.-Colonel Henry Fowler
Mackay and a grand-daughter of Mr.
Alexander George Mackay, a former
owner of “Bagthorpe Hall,” Nor-
folk, and, on the maternal side, of
Lieut.-General George Robert Ains-
lie, and a near relative of Lieut.-
Colonel Frederick George Ainslie,
C. 8., who was wounded in the battle
of Tnkerman. Mr. E. H. Templeton
was born at St. Lawrence on Novem-
ber 26, 1875, and educated at
Perkins’ High School, Mackay. In
the intervals of his scholastic train-
ing he received a good grounding in
cattle and sheep work, and on
leaving school in 1893 took a post on
“Huntly,” the property of which he
is now part owner in conjunction
with his uncle, Mr. E. H. Mackay,
and his brother, Mr. A. N. Temple-

time of his advent to “Huntly” the
property was owned by Mr. Mackay
in partnership with the Milson Bros.,

practically from the time of his
advent to the country was associated
with the pastoral industry, being pro-
minently known in the Peak Downs
district during the sixties and seven-
ties as the owner of “Lanark,”
“Alpha,” and “Tierawoomba” Sta-
tions, as well as of “Huntly.” Sub-
sequently he became a well-known
figure in metropolitan business circles
as the managing director of the firm
of Dalgety & Co., Ltd. “Huntly”
was his residence for some years,
during which he personally managed
the property and inaugurated a
very fine system of development,
having taken over the run in a prac-
tically unimproved condition. He
was one of the first to substitute
fencing for the old-fashioned method
of shepherding, and under his
regime “Huntly” was rendered
sheep-proof through a very complete
system of boundary and subdivi-
sional erections, with the result that
the flock of 12,000 which he had
established was rapidly augmented,
at one time numbering 33,000. Mr.
Mackay has for long ceased to
actively associate himself with his
pastoral interests, and now resides in
England. “Huntly” was originally
taken up by the late John Arthur
Macartney in the year 1859, and is
one of the oldest properties in the
Peak Downs district, and has the
distinction of having remained in the
same family ownership for a longer
period than any other holding in the
locality. From Mr. Macartney it
passed to Mr. Oscar de Satge, who

ing book called “Pages from the

continued in partnership until the
death of the former gentleman, when
the Milson Bros., of “Milson Point,”
Sydney, New South Wales, became
associated with Mr. Mackay as part
owners of the property, the connec-
tion continuing until 1910, when
Messrs. A. N. and E. H. Templeton
purchased their interests, the younger
of the- brothers then entering upon
the management. At time of writ-
ing the run contains 45,000 acres,
which, somewhat higher than the

have proved their value as fodder.
Ti-tree, myall, bloodwood, and a
predominating growth of blackbutt
are noticeable amongst the timbers,
and nowhere on the Peak Downs is
there a better growth of saltbush

which is subdivided into thirty-two
paddocks, is splendidly watered both
naturally and artificially, the sup-
plies from the many fine springs with
which it is favoured being amply
supplemented by seventeen wells,
which are equipped with Comet

stud sires bred on this station. The
equine section has been in no way
behind the other phases of the
grazing industry carried out on the
station, horses bearing the B 2 M
brand being in as keen demand for
the Indian market at the present
time as in the past. Erected in the
year 1863, the homestead is a low,
quaint, adzed-timbered and splen-
didly-preserved building lying 20
miles east from Clermont, on the St.
Lawrence road. The grounds sur-
rounding it are studded with useful
and ornamental trees and garden
plots, which harmonize completely
with the picturesqueness of the
dwelling, while in keeping with the
orderly appearance of the home are
the commodious outhouses, including
the wool shed, which was built at
the same time as was the homestead.
As illustrative of the progressiveness
which has always characterized the
management of “Huntly,” it is
worthy of mention that on this pro-
perty in the year 1895 sheep-dipping
was first tried on Peak Downs. Some
idea of the minor, though sufficiently
serious, difficulties with which the
early pastoralists had to contend may
be gathered from the fact that in one
year nearly 1,000,000 wallabies were
killed in the district to prevent the
pastures from being eaten out, over
40,000 scalps being taken and paid
for on “Huntly” alone. The settlers
endeavoured to cope with this pest
by erecting stake fences, the cost of
which approximated between £l2O
and £l3O per mile, but the experi-
menting proving not altogether suc-
cessful netting was resorted to, the
cost in the latter case working out at
£9B for the netting and £5O for
labour and other material per mile.

several descendants, is widely and
prominently represented in the
north, and in direct succession to its
founder in the State has continued
to the fourth generation, which is
the fifth in descent from the pioneer’s
late father, the founder of the line
under the Southern Cross. The story
of Mr. John Shannon’s very inter-
esting career is outlined in Yol. I.
of this work and throws much light
on the conditions under which settle-
ment was carried forward in the six-
ties, seventies, and eighties, which
seen in the perspective of the
country’s yet brief history, form a
strange contrast to the progressive-
ness that followed the advent of rail-
way locomotion, telegraphic and tele-
phonic communication, and motor
power for sea, land, and aerial trans-
port, during the latter part of the
nineteenth and the opening decades
of the twentieth century. Mr.
MR. J. B. SHANNON, SEN.
Shannon experienced even more than
his share of the disappointments and
setbacks that fell to the lot of the
settler at the period when Queens-
land was practically all virgin
country, but overcame every obstacle
that beset his path with that un-
quenchable spirit of conquest which
would appear the heritage of the
best representatives of the British
race and which has made for this
great land the name she enjoys
throughout the world as a prolific
and wealth-producing continent. He
was born on the Hunter River, New
South Wales, in the year 1841, and
was still in his teens when he started
life on his own account in Queens-
land, having travelled overland from
Maitland to Brisbane witli a few
good horses as his assets and arrived
at the latter place after a six months’
journey over immense tracts of un-
settled country in the year 1864.

bane he proceeded to Rockhampton
by a small paddle-boat, and after a
protracted and very hazardous trip
reached that now important centre
which was then a very primitive
settlement, built over chiefly with
huts. Thereafter, the lines of his
life were constantly cast in the vast
wilderness of the Never-never, and
his experiences at this period of his
career, when conditions outback
were so primitive that only the
fittest could hope to survive the con-
tinued hardships that were the sum
of existence in the early days, deserve
that description in detail which
could well be accorded them in a
volume of pioneering reminiscences.
A year after his advent to Queens-
land he married and settled on
the land at ‘‘Crescent Lagoon,”
near Rockhampton, and there, with
the young wife who was always
to prove so staunch a comrade
in the face of many adversities and
who shared the prosperity which
eventually rewarded his exertions,
began his long pastoral career. His

resided until attaining his late teens,
when he returned to his father’s

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Of the pioneers of the Bowen
district, the founder of the POTT
FAMILY, the late Gideon Pott, was
one of the few who, long surviving
the stress and arduousness of early
MR. A. POTT.
settlement and pastoral develop-
ment, witnessed the transforma-
tion of primitive forests to thriving
towns and highly improved holdings,
MAJOR ARTHUR POTT.
for his passing was delayed as late
as the year 1913, when he was at the
ripe old age of eighty-one. Born
near Longholrn, Dumfries, Scotland,
on October 6, 1831, and educated at
Green Row Academy, Cumberland,
he was the only son of Mr. Alexander
Pott of “Burnfoot,” who was a scion
of an old Border family, records of
which have been preserved from a
period dating back to the year 1521.
He was nearly related to that branch
of the family which held the estates
of Dod and Knowesouth, the owner
of which, his namesake, Gideon Pott,
having for thirty-six years carried
out the honorary duties of secretary
to the Duke of BuccleuclTs Hunt,
was presented at the residence of Sir
William Scott, Bart., of Ancrum, in
the presence of a gathering of dis-
tinguished gentlemen, with a solid
silver dinner ssrvice and a full-
length portrait of himself in hunting
costume, as an appreciation of his
services. The late Gideon Pott of
“Burnfoot,” Bowen, came to Aus-
tralia in the year 1852, and landed
at Sydney, whence he proceeded to
the scene of one of the newly dis-
covered goldfields, which at that
time were thronged with adventurers
and wealth-seekers representing every
nationality and nearly every class,
profession and trade then common to
civilized humanity. Continuing for
some years as a miner, he sought
prosperity at Bendigo, Ballarat and
other gold- bearing centres with but
indifferent success; and finally aban-
doned mining for the pastoral indus-
try. The year before Separation
(1858) found him in Queensland,
and here, in the Dawson Valley
district, he roughed it with the best
of the pioneers, assisting, in the face
of violent hostility from the aborig-
ines and the elemental dangers
inseparable from the settlement of
vast and occupied territory, in the
work of. reclaiming from Mother
Nature the prolific pastures of that
part of North-eastern Australia.
Three years later, in 1861, he came
North with cattle and sheep for
“Havilah” on the Bowen River,
that station being then in the course
of formation. To the late Gideon
Pott is due the credit of having
brought the first load of wool into
the township, two years after its
settlement, and at about this time
he took up his residence there, being
thenceforward, for some considerable
time, associated with the Bowen
shipping trade and the transport of
goods overland. In 1867, he selected
land on the Don River and forming
a home on this property, which is
o.nly a few miles from the Port, car-
ried on grazing and farming, his
operations covering the breeding of
cattle and horses and the cultivation
of cotton and other products. When
the idea of recruiting labour from the
South Sea Islands was first put into
effect, he secured a working staff of
MR. G. POTT, SEN.
kanakas, and was able to make this
industry pay until it received its
death blow by the withdrawal of the
bonus of 4d. per pound previously
MR. E. POTT.
granted to the growers by the then
existing Government of Queensland.
In the early seventies, when he real-
ised the impossibility of making a
success of cotton growing, he


enlarged his landed interests by the
purchase of a block of land situated
withing 14 miles of the coast, which
he named “Glenfallough,” and
thenceforward devoted himself solely
MR. G. POTT.
to grazing pursuits, making a partic-
ular study of the breeding of both
horned and equine stock, and
specializing in Clydesdales. Many
MR. J. POTT.
of the latter breed bearing his
registered brand, POT, found their
way to such parts of the North as
were then settled, and frequently
comprised whole working teams on
the Charters Towers, Ravenswood
and other roads, in the early days,
exemplifying the keen demand
which existed for “Glenfallough”
bred draughts. He added still
further to his interests in the late
seventies with the acquirement of
an area lying 40 miles from Bowen
at the head of the Don River; and
this property, which is named
“Radfordslea” and now worked by
his eldest son, Alexander, he devoted
to cattle raising. In later years,
when his sons became sufficiently
experienced to take over the admin-
istration of his larger interests, the
pioneer entered into partial retire-
ment at “Burnfoot,” his originally
acquired property, and here, for
many years, continued to devote his
energies to the culture and expor-
tation of citrus fruits, despatching
thousands of cases of these products
annually to the South. With fruit
farming he combined dairying, hav-
ing imported for the latter purpose
a choice strain of Ayrshire cattle.
His marriage occurred in the year
1864, to Ellen, daughter of the late
John Phelps, a member of a family
of old Welsh lineage, which,
formerly, was well-known and highly
esteemed in Pembrokeshire, where,
in the year 1841, Mrs. Pott, Sen.,
was born. This lady and her brother
terminated in the early sixties an
eventful journey from their native
land to Sydney, the ship in which
they originally embarked having
been wrecked in the Bay of Biscay.
However, they eventually reached
their destination, and after a short
period spent in Sydney, Mrs. Pott
(then Miss Phelps) embarked for
Bowen by the schooner “Policeman,”
arriving in the infant settlement in
the year 1862. In Bowen she resided
with her brother-in-law, the late
James Gordon, who at that time was
sub-collector of Customs there.
James Gordon, who had previously
filled the position of super-cargo on
the “Santa Barbara” under Captain
Sinclair on the voyage which, on
October 16, 1859, resulted in the dis-
covery of Port Denison, was subse-
quently appointed Police Magistrate
at Townsville. Too much cannot be
said of the good accomplished by the
pioneer’s widow, or of her exceptional
attributes as a wife and mother.
Her guerdon to her adopted country
is two generations of a hardy race
which, playing their part on the
land as Australian citizens and hav-
ing contributed towards Empire
defence —one during the South
African struggle (1899-1902) and
both at the chief theatre of the Great
War (1914-18) —have proved and
continue to prove, the value of her
training. She is now at the age of
MR. G. W. POTT.
eighty and resides with her two
unmarried daughters, the Misses
Mary Elizabeth and Thomasina
Hannah Pott. The late Gideon Pott

and educated in Bowen, the eldest

grazing industry, though, for a short
time he followed mining and com-
mercial pusuits on the Normanby
goldfields, where he was interested
in a butchering business in the pros-
perous days of the goldfield. His
pastoral interests are now centred in
"Radfordslea” and "Glenfallough,”
the latter he owns in conjunction
with his two youngest brothers,
Major Arthur Pott and Mr. Edmund
Pott, while on his home property on
the Don Delta, he engages in farm-
ing pursuits. His two sons, Walter
Leslie and Gideon, enlisted for
second son of the founder of
the family in Australia, was
born in the year 1869, and is
now the manager of a ranch in
Rhodesia, South Africa. He was
associated with pastoral affairs from
his childhood onwards, and in early
manhood had had considerable
experience with stock on the roads
in the course of many extended
droving trips. The mining industry
at Flagstone also afforded him exper-
ience for a period. With his brother,

early days. Both these brothers
were comrades, also, to the Nor-
manby rush, and subsequently,
when the Boer War eventuated, they
enlisted together, becoming members
of the third contingent, with which
they served in Rhodesia with Gen-
eral Plumer’s Column. They par-
ticipated in the relief of Mafeking
and the memorable siege of Elands

sugar industry, which now engages
his energies on his property near
Ayr. JAMES POTT, the fourth
son, was born in 1872, and like his
brothers, was trained to grazing pur-
suits on the family acres, like them,
also, becoming in time associated
with the sugar industry, taking up
country for cane growing at Pros-
erpine. After working this farm for
a period, he sold out, and returning
to pastoral life, accepted the manage-

behalf of the Queensland National
Bank. At time of writing he is
engaged in the management of

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND; ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


“MARY VALE” Station, the
home of Mr. and Mrs. C. M. Clarke,
is brimful of historical associations,
having been founded in the year
1861 by one of our most intrepid
MR. JOSEPH HANN.
explorers, the late William Hann,
who, as he rested on a bank of the
creek on which now stands the sta-
tion homestead, and with his
thoughts turned to the young wife
in Victoria who was destined to
share with him the ups and downs
of a pioneer’s life, instantly decided
that the fair prospect before him
should bear her name. —“There is
‘Mary Vale,’ ” he said, bestowing on
the station the title by which it has
ever since been known. The late
William Hann was Mrs. Clarke’s
father, and was one of the most
prominent of four brothers well-
known in the pastoral life of the
Continent, namely, William, Frank,
John and James Hann. Both Wil-
liam and Frank, by their explora-
tions and geological discoveries,
achieved results of incalculable
benefit to their kind. Frank Hann
was the first white man to ascend
Mount Broome in Western Austra-
lia, and named Mounts Ord, Clifton,
Smith, Elizabeth, the Synnot Range
and many other localities in the
course of his tours of exploration,
which embraced Northern and Cen-
tral Australia from the. eastern
coast across the Gulf and the
Territory; the North-west of West-
ern Australia; South Australia from
the Gulf to the mouth of the Mur-
ray; and the hinterland of the West.
Born in Wiltshire, lie came to
Australia with his parents when five
years of age, and his long career
ended in Perth on August, 23, 1921,
before the completion of his seventy-
sixth year. The brothers were sons
of the late Joseph Hann and their
only sister became the wife of the
late Edward Cunningham, the pion-
eer of “Burdekin Downs” and the
discoverer of other pastoral areas in
the North. Joseph Hann brought
his family to Australia about the
year 1851 and settled in Victoria.
After engaging for some years in
pastoral pursuits there, he journeyed
by boat to Bowen, Queensland, and
from there rode over much of the
west and the north of the then Col-
ony in search of suitable grazing

country, having been one of the first
whit© men to cross the Burdekin
River. Finally he discovered on the
edge of the basalt country outlying
the present town of Charters Tow-
ers, the well-grassed area now known
as “Bluff Downs.” Joseph Hann
and his sons devoted many years to
the development of this property.
Messrs. Bland, Daintree and Kling-
inder subsequently joined the family
in partnership, and “Bluff Downs,”
“Mary Vale,” “Lolworth” and the
surrounding country, were con-
ducted as company concerns. In
January, 1864, in an attempt to
cross the Burdekin when in flood.
Joseph Hann was drowned, and
at “Bluff Downs” on June 24, of the
same year, the death of Mrs. Joseph
Hann occurred. Of the sons of the
original pioneer and his wife, Wil-
liam Hann achieved most for Queens-
land. Hailing from Wiltshire,
England, with his parents, he
resided in Victoria until reaching
manhood, and joined his father at
“Bluff Downs,” or “Red Bluff” as
it was then named, almost immedi-
ately after the country was dis-
covered, leaving his wife—whom he
had married in November, 1859
in Colart, where he had settled
some time previously. Mrs. William
Hann was the daughter of the late
James Hearn. In the year 1863
she rejoined her husband, having
travelled from the South by boat
and accomplished, in a spring cart
with her three year old daughter,
the long overland journey from
Bowen to “Bluff Downs,” which
was undertaken on March 5, and
completed on April 8, of the same
year. “Bluff Downs” became the
birthplace of her younger daughter,
Mrs. C. M. Clarke. Her only son
was born at “Bluff Downs” and died
in childhood, and her first-born child
became the wife of Mr. Fred Keppel
of “Victoria Downs.” She also is
deceased. Mrs. Hann’s experiences
as a pastoralist’s wife in the early
days would of themselves make an
interesting volume, and many of

these serve to illustrate the dignity,
kindliness and force of character,
which distinguished her. Among
the incidents which marked her life
at “Bluff Downs,” it is recorded that


once, towards evening, considerable
consternation was caused at the
homestead by the congregation of a
large number of natives on a stony
ridge nearby, from which a small

deputation approached the rather
anxious lady and her domestic staff.
It soon transpired that their fears
were groundless, for one or two of
the natives who had some knowledge
of English smilingly mentioned that
the blacks meant no harm but had
come to see the "white Mary” (Mrs.
Hann) —a phenomenon in their eyes,
as they had never seen a white
woman before. They remained in
the vicinity of the house all night,
and next morning, to satisfy their
curiosity and to show her confidence,
Mrs. Hann went freely among them,
by her friendliness and the ease
which she gave to some that were
ill, purchasing their grateful friend-
ship to the extent of being assured
that so long as any of the Hann
family lived no trouble would ever
come to them from the black men
and women —a promise which was
ever after faithfully kept, for,
although the tribes of the Kennedy
district proved more or less trouble-
some in the early days and wrought
considerable havoc among the flocks
and herds of the border properties,
they absolutely respected the stock
and property owned by the Hanns.
The pioneer’s wife cheerfully accepted
the privations and hardships which
necessarily fell to the lot of the early
settlers, setting herself the task of
improving as much as might be

conditions existing at an outpost of
civilization separated by some hun-
dreds of miles of roadless country
from the nearest point of communi-

a time the stores and mails from
Bowen would be overdue (the mails
arriving but once in three months),
for their carriage necessitated a
journey over almost impassable
ranges, and rivers and creeks that
were sometimes swollen with torren-
tial rains. As an incident of the
minor difficulties which met her
efforts to make living conditions more
tolerable, she used to tell of how, on
one occasion, having caused a hive of

experienced many vicissitudes, also,
at “Mary Vale,” where she resided
from the year 1870 until the time of
her death in 1894. Her birthplace
was Somersetshire, England, and she
arrived in Australia in the year 1840,
being then aged seven. William
Hann continued to be associated with
“Bluff Downs” until the year 1870,
in which year, on November 19, the
partners having decided to abandon
the station owing to the unsuitable-
ness of the country for woolly stock,
he started all the sheep he could
muster on the road, concluding the
long droving trip at the Victorian side
of the Murray, where he found a
market for them. He then returned
to the North, and,i acquiring sole
interest in “Mary Vale,” brought
his wife from “Bluff Downs” to
reside in the home which had been
erected by the Daintree family, who
were the first to occupy the run after
its discovery by William Hann in
1861, and with one of whom, Mr.
Richard Daintree, he had been, at
different times since 1862, closely
associated in exploratory work, gain-
ing with the eminent scientist a
first-hand knowledge of the various
geological features ot Northern
Queensland. During a 2,000 miles
trip from the Burdekin River to
Victoria, Mr. Hann made a very val-
uable collection of fossils and minera-
logical specimens, the possession of
which enabled Australian scientists
to follow out a geological system of
Central Queensland and connect it
with those of the more southerly
parts of the Continent. His explor-
ations and their results had, by the
seventies, attracted considerable
notice from the geologists, minera-
logists and pastoralists of the per-
iod, and when, in the early seventies,
the Government proposed fitting out
an expedition to ascertain the char-
acter and mineral resources of the
country lying north of the 14th par-
allel, he was considered as most
eminently fitted for the leadership,
and approached in this connection
by those responsible for the under-
taking. Accepting the onerous and
responsible post, he immediately got

Jerry; and on June 26, 1872, started
out on the expedition which was des-
tined to materially add to the pros-
perity of the country by the opening

Warner’s Range, named after the
surveyor, was the next discovery of
importance, and, on August 5, the
explorers came to a spot where, three
miles to the north, was seen a large
waterway, which, on reaching, they
found to be a wide river bed con-
taining long and deep water-holes
connected by small streams. This

the neighbourhood of which was
discovered and named the Stewart
River. From this locality was taken
a southerly direction towards the
Endeavour River, which was reached
on September 21. From their camp
here Messrs. Hann, Warner and
Nation walked to the present site of
Cooktown, where they came upon the
deserted fishing grounds of Messrs.
Towns & Co. In an attempt to make
the return journey along the coast,
the explorations of the party were
continued over exceedingly rough
and scrubby country, and on short
rations; and it was at this phase of
their adventures that the black boy,
Jerry, reported having seen in the
scrub a tree climbing animal resem-
bling a kangaroo. Dr. Tate was
able to collect some bones of this
creature, which unfortunately,
owing to the hazards involved in
their journey southward, he was
obliged to abandon with many of the
valuable specimens that he had col-
lected, thus leaving the honour of
discovering the climbing kangaroo
to Carl Lumholz, who visited the
country ten years later. Being finally
convinced that perseverance in his in-
tention of reaching home by forcing
a track along the coast could only
end in disaster, Mr. Hann changed
his course and led his party westward

tracks begun. In due course they
reached Fossilbrook, and from there,
on November 12, after four and a
half months in the wilds and having
covered 1,500 miles of country, Mr.
Hann rode to Junction Creek
Telegraph Station and wired the
official announcement of his return.
The news of the discovery of gold on
the Palmer was followed by his
receipt of a request for information
from Mr. Mulligan—after whom
Mount Mulligan, the mining town-
ship, is named—and this was fully
tendered by Mr. Hann, together with
a copy of Mr. Warner’s map of the
route. Mr. Mulligan, with a party
of five, arrived on the Palmer on
June 29, 1873, and finding payable
gold on the field, from which, up to
the present day, the value of about
£7,500,000 has been obtained,
received the Government reward of
£l,OOO. He continued prospecting
in the locality and in 1875 named the
Hann and Warner Rivers after the
leader and surveyor of the partjy
which discovered the Palmer. Hav-
ing so successfully accomplished his
mission, William Hann resumed
control of his pastoral interests at
“Mary Vale,” and, as teeming mul-
titudes flocked to the Palmer River
in search of the yellow metal, found
there a market for his stock, which
he personally drove over the rough,
roadless country for sale to the
herd, being successful also in rais-
ing good Clydesdales, importing
high-class sires and mares for the
latter purpose, which was chiefly
prompted by a love for the type, as
the station records show that pedi-
greed draughts were not at this time
the basis of profitable investment.
He succeeded in acclimatizing a breed
of deer known as the Axis, having,
on his return from a trip to the old
world in 1886, secured one of the
species at Ceylon, and the following
year imported a doe and buck to the
the run. 11 is daughter, Mrs. C. M.

JOHN MAGOFFIN, “Chiltern
Hills,” Winton, was born in Chil-
tern, Victoria, on October 26, 1872,
and is the youngest son of the late
Richard Magoffin who, hailing from
County Down, Ireland, arrived in
the Garden State in the year 1851.
Though a descendant of very old
farming stock and of progenitors
who, through many succeeding gen-
erations, engaged in agricultural
pursuits on the land which is still
held by their descendants in County
Down, the late gentleman immedi-
ately directed his steps to the newly
discovered mining fields in Victoria,
and followed the industry with but
small success for over twenty years,
during which he was associated with
Ovens, Ballarat, Bendigo, and other
early diggings. In the late seventies
he abandoned mining for agrarian
pursuits, but realizing the futility
of continuing on the land after
struggling for some years with
adverse conditions which precluded
the possibility of profit, he disposed
of his farming interests to start as
a general contractor for bush work.
Accompanied by his family and
assisted by his sons, he worked in
this capacity through Victoria and
New South Wales into Queensland,
where he arrived in the year 1882
and continued to engage in fencing,
shearing, tank-sinking, etc., in con-
junction with his sons until the time
of his death, which occurred under
circumstances which have sur-
rounded the last hours of many a
pioneer. The late Mr. Magoffin,
being overtaken by a storm, was lost
in the bush and died only a few
hours before the arrival of a party
sent out in search of him. Educated
at Bourke, New South Wales,
Mr. John Magoffin concluded his
school days long ere entering his
teens in order to accompany his
parents and other members of his
MR. J. MAGOFFIN.
family on the roads to Queensland.
During the prolonged journey
through the States he became
familiar with various aspects of
country life and contributed his
juvenile help in the operations which
were directed by the late pioneer.
On arrival in Queensland he
continued to render such assistance
as he was capable of in connection
with the tank-sinking contracts
undertaken by the family, and thus
gained early experience of what was
then the chief avenue of develop-
ment in the State. In conjunction
with his brothers he followed the
same calling after the death of his
father, and in the year 1891 became
interested with them in a stock
venture comprising the purchase of
10,000 sheep. This flock, which
was placed on agistment, was heavily
depleted in consequence of the
drought which visited the West in
the early nineties, though in the
case of the Magoffin Bros, disaster
was considerably mitigated by their
activities in the matter of water
production, their long experience in
this phase of pastoral development
then proving of incalculable value.
At about the beginning of the
present century, which was ushered
in by the drought which devastated
the country for so many years, two
pastoral properties, “Melrose” and
“Rosevale,” were purchased by the
brothers, who then abandoned the
carrying business and settled on the
land, subsequently suffering consid-
erable loss as the result of the
disastrous visitation. With the

seven years he continued on the

four teams. These he finally dis-
posed of in order to re-enter the
pastoral industry, and with that
object took up in 1910, in partnership
with Mr. George B. Kettle and other
members of his family, the 110,000

posed of good mixed country, the
character of which is chiefly indicated
by Mitchell and Flinders grass downs

attention is given also to the
breeding of cattle and horses, the
herd now comprising about 700 head
of shorthorns of first-rate quality,
and the horses numbering a figure
in the region of 400. Built up from
a nucleus of 10,000 “Elderslie”
ewes, with rams imported at regular
intervals from “Goolgumbla,” the
well-known South Australian stud,
the flock now numbers 30,000
merinoes of a good class which
produce fleece of fine quality, good
length and staple, averaging a
weight of seven lbs. per head. Mr.
Magoffin’s operations in the equine
department of his property have
been rewarded with exceptional suc-
cess, his country being highly
suitable for this class of stock and
bearing the reputation of producing
horses of considerable quality and
some of the best that have raced on
the western turf. There is always
a demand for such of the “Chiltern
Hills” horses not required by the
owner, these invariably commanding
good prices. “Qurgan,” the winner
of several big events at Northern
meetings when bearing the colours
of Mr. Richard Magoffin, was bred
on the property. The stallion at
present in use is “Royal Laddie” by
“Ayr Laddie” (imp.). Situated on
Hie Winton-Boulia route 135 miles
from the former centre, which is the
nearest railway town, about midway
between it and the far western
township of Boulia, the homestead
is a two-storied building, which,
designed in accordance with up-to-
date ideas fulfils the requirements
imposed by the adverse conditions
of the western summer and is in
every way worthy of description as
a most comfortable home. The
ground floor forms the base of a
lofty, well-ventilated, and tastefully
arranged living room which is always
delightfully cool. Mr. Magoffin is a
keen and clean sportsman and a
member of the Kynuna Amateur
and the Clutha Picnic Race Clubs,
two of the most important institu-
tions of their kind in Northern
Queensland. He married in April,
1912, Emily Jane, daughter of the
late George Kettle, a Staffordshire
native and a member of a family,
which has been identified with the
County for generations and which in
comparatively recent times has been
connected with the mining industry
there, the issue of the union being
three sons.

ties, concluding the long sea voyage
from the Old World at Brisbane,
Queensland. In London he had

served an apprenticeship to the
butchering trade, and on his arrival
in the Queensland metropolis he
sought employment similar to that
which had occupied him in his native
land, being shortly engaged by Mr.
Edmonstone, Mayor of Brisbane,
in whose service he remained until
he had been sufficiently long in the
country to obtain some idea of its
geographical and industrial condi-
tions. Realizing the greater possi-
bilities for a man of energy and
enterprise in the more recently
settled districts of the then Colony,
he left Brisbane after a brief resi-
dence there and proceeded to
Northern Queensland, where, at
Bowen, he secured employment at
his trade under the late John Wylie
Wilson, who owned what was then
the only butchering establishment in
the town. In 1876, after less than
ten strenuous years, during which,
as an employe, he gave to his

adopted country the best that was
in him, exercising meanwhile thrift
that meant much self-sacrifice, and
finally foresight and enterprise, he
was able to purchase the butchery
and start upon a career as an inde-
pendent business man and prove the
value of his citizenship in a district
that for its progress needed, above
all, men of initiative and ability,
such as the late John H. Isbell. For
nearly a quarter of a century he car-
ried on his butchering establishment,
having in the interval branched out
into pastoral investment, purchasing
“Heidelberg” Station, and from
Mr. Joseph Emerson (since deceased)
the property known as “Pretty
Bend,” which is now in the hands of
Mr. T. A. Atherton, of whose career
a memoir appears elsewhere in this
work. In the year 1901, fortune
favouring his former enterprises, he
added to his pastoral interests by the
purchase of “Havilah” Station.

was at the age of sixty-seven,

munity and among a wide circle of

friends. He married in the year
1874 Sophie Madelene, daughter of
Mr. Felix Lannoy, who, of French
birth, as was his wife, was the well-
known and popular proprietor of
Petty’s Hotel, Sydney, in the early
days. This exceedingly popular
hostelry was first opened by Mr. and
Mrs. Lannoy, and under their man-
agement was established the excel-
lent reputation which it still retains.
To the late J. H. Isbell were born
fourteen children, of whom seven
sons and two daughters survive. His
widow deserves all honour for the
support, both moral and practical,
which at all times and in all his
undertakings she accorded him, and
for those qualities of motherhood
which have built up an Australian
race that worthily upholds the name
and traditions handed down by its
founder. Under her father’s auspices
she received a good business training
in the Mother State, and in the diffi-
cult times incidental to an initial
venture in the early years of settle-
ment, was able to assist her husband
through many a critical period,
sharing with him many sacrifices and
hardships of a sort that present gen-
erations are seldom called upon to
face, and with him finally reaping
the reward which ability, industry,
and thrift are in the end bound to
secure. Her reminiscences of Bowen
go back to the time when a few cot-
tages and two- or three small shops
formed the towship, and throw inter-
esting light on the conditions under
which settlement advanced in the
North—conditions necessarily primi-
tive and rough and unsoftened by
luxuries that would be considered
necessities at the present time,
Though living quietly at “Penrith
House,” the beautiful home erected
by her husband at the end of the last
century, Mrs. Isbell continues to
actively assist such objects and insti-
tutions as tend to alleviate distress
or ease the sufferings of the sick, all
movements of a charitable nature
having a strong appeal for her. She
is an energetic worker for the Church
of England, her talent for organiz-
ation and undoubted ability being
an invaluable factor in promoting
the success of any local movement set
afoot in its behalf. “Penrith House”
is in Sinclair Street and is one of the
most delightful dwellings in Bowen.
It contains many treasures of art and
rare curios, all of which form the
collection of a lifetime and testifv

born on September 22, 1889, October
4, 1890, March 10, 1892, and August

ton College, Sydney. Of these, the


two first-mentioned are engaged in
the administration of “Heidelberg”
and “Havilah” Stations, while Maur-
ice Victor and Cyril Fortiscue follow
commercial life in Brisbane and
Sydney. The elder daughter, Sophie
Josephine, married in tlie year 1912,
Archdeacon Saxon, a cleric of the
Church of England, Cessnock, New
South Wales, and the younger,
Beatrice Mellow, resides with her
mother at the Bowen home. “Hav-
ilah” and “Heidelberg,” the station
properties owned by the Isbell
family, are both very highly devel-
oped pastoral concerns, the former
being regarded as one of the best
cattle runs in Northern Queensland.
Both rank among the scenes of very
early pastoral development in the
district and are well watered from
natural sources.
MARTIN HENRY HAYWARD,
J.P., manager of “Ayrshire Downs,”
Winton, was born on July 4, 1867,
and is a son of the late Rev, Rowland
Hayward, who was at that lime the
officiating clergyman of Holy Trinity
Church, Few, Melbourne. Of old
English descent, the late gentleman
was a member of a family which was
established in Suffolk many genera-
tions ago, and from records relating
to the annals of the County we learn
that he is a direct descendant of a
former owner of the lands and estate
of Mettingham Castle, which passed
from the Haywards at a period
dating about a century back.
Possessing a temperament to which
the possibilities of a new country
keenly appealed, he set out for
Victoria in the early fifties.
After seeing much of the conditions
jmevailing in the then Colony and
realizing the wide field for apostolic
labour, he entered the ministry of
the Church of England, and is
recorded as the first clergyman who
visited the Inglewood mining district
in the rough days of the fifties. At
subsequent periods he filled incum-
bencies in Bendigo, Kew, and other
parishes, and was later sent to Tas-
mania as Government chaplain of
Port Arthur. When that office was
abolished he returned to the main-
land and was appointed organizing
chaplain for South Australia. In
1909, towards the end of fifty years
of noble effort in the land of his
adoption, he retired to Boxvale, in
the State which for so long was the
scene of his labours, and there

known during his lifetime for his
responsible connection with the
management of the principal penal
establishments of the early days and
as a pioneer reformer of such
institutions. Fie arrived in Tas-
mania in 1835 and three years later
was made Police Magistrate of
Hobart Town. Subsequently he
became Chief Superintendent at
Norfolk Island, and in the early
fifties was appointed Chief Inspector
of the penal establishment in
Victoria. A few years later, in
1857, he met his death as the result
of severe injuries received in the
execution of his duty. He left a
large family, of which the late
Colonel Thomas Price, C. 8., was
a member. This gentleman was
notably connected with military
affairs in the Old World and in
India, and later in Victoria, where
he pioneered the mounted rifle
movement. Fie commanded the
Victorian Mounted Rifles during
the South African War and was
mentioned in despatches to London.
In 1902 he was made Commandant
of the Commonwealth Military
Forces in Victoria, and afterwards
in Queensland from 1902 to 1904.
Mr. M. H. Flay ward was educated
at St. Peter’s College, Adelaide,
concluding his studies at that
institution and taking up com-
mercial life when at the age of
seventeen. After a brief period at
the desk, however, realizing that his
temperament was unsuited to the
narrow outlook of office life, he
decided to try his fortune in the
bush, and accordingly he obtained
a post as jackaroo at "Andamooka”
Station, which lies at the head
of Lake Torrens, South Australia.
Here he was initiated into the
workings of a sheep station and
obtained a good grounding in the
wool industry. Fie remained at

years, resigning his post in 1888
to take over the duties of overseer
at "Naryilco Downs,” a station in
the south-western corner of Queens-
land and then owned by the
Morphett Bros. “Naryilco Downs”
was devoted to both sheep and cattle,
and in the course of his duties on this
property, which occupied a period of
five years, he was afforded con-
siderable practical experience of
both phases of the industry. In
1893, with the view of still further
widening his sphere of experience, he
accepted the overseership of
“Bingera” Station. After spending
some time on "Bingera,” increasing
responsibilities caused him to seek
more remunerative occupation, and
this he alternately found as a
contractor for the conveyance of
mails over bush routes, droving, and
other bush work. In the year 1901,
being offered the post of overseer on
"South Comongin” Station, in the
Warrego district, he again associated
himself with the pastoral industry,
carrying out the duties of that
position until advanced to the
management of the property a few
years later He resided at "South
Comongin” for over ffteen years,
and when it was sold he was appoint-
ed by the Queensland National Pas-
toral Co. to the managership of
"Cork” Station, a position which he
held until transferred to “Ayrshire
Downs” in the year 1919. During
his residence in different districts of
the State he has contributed his
support to all movements of a
progressive nature and taken an
active part in public life. He was
for long a councillor of the Bulloo
Shire and a member of the Marsupial
Board. and has exercised the
Commission of the Peace since 1907.
Mr. Flayward is a member of the
Winton Club. In the year 1895 he
married Edith, daughter of the late
James Betts, a pioneer contractor
of Southern Queensland, and of the
union there is a family of four
sons and three daughters. Mrs.

year 1915. Her eldest son, Rowland,

the Hunter River district, New
South Wales, he made his first start
in life as an employee on a pastoral
property, being then in his middle
teens. He continued to equip
himself with a knowledge of stock
and station work for the following
four years, at the end of which he
set out from the Mother State with
sheep for the pastures of “Portland

of nearly forty years, speaks volumes
for his practical methods of adminis-

major portion of his time and
attention has not prevented him
from participating in the public life

of citizenship finding expression in
connection with various charitable

ALBERT ALFRED COOK,
“Greenmount,” Mackay, is the
youngest son of the late John Cook
and a grandson of Samuel Welling-
ton Cook, who was born in the year
MR. J. COOK.

near St. Neots, Cornwall, England,
of old farming and grazing stock,
which he was destined to perpetuate
in a land far removed from the
MR. R. ATHERTON.
surroundings and associations with
which it had been identified through
unbroken centuries in the old world.
Samuel Wellington Cook married a
Miss Dangar, whose brother, Mr.
Henry Dangar, had previously
settled in Australia as a pastoralist
in the Singleton district, New South
Wales, owning a station called
“Neotsfield,” of which he was the
founder. Shortly after his marriage,
realizing the possibilities and desir-
ing to take advantage of the wider
scope of landed operations afforded
by the possessions of the Empire in
North America, Mr. Cook left his
native land for Lake Ontario,
Canada. Not caring for the condi-
tions of the Dominion, however, he,
after an absence of a few years,
returned with his family to England,
where he spent a brief period before
again setting out for distant scenes
amidst which he hoped to carve a
career more fruitful of achievement
than would be possible if he remained
in the homeland. The year 1837
witnessed his arrival in Sydney,
whence he immediately proceeded to
“Turanville,” at that time the resi-
dence of his brother-in-law, Mr.
William Dangar, and many years
later the property of Mr. Thomas
Cook, one of his sons. From “Turan-
ville” he proceeded further inland,
to take up, on behalf of Mr. W.
Dangar, the country afterwards
known as “Myall Creek.” This
property, some time after Mr. Cook
relinquished its management, became
the scene of a shameful massacre of
aborigines by a number of convicts
employed there as assigned servants,
six of whom, however, suffered death
for their crimes in Sydney. When
his work of establishing “Myall
Creek” Station was accomplished,
Mr. Cook ventured further west on
his own account and formed a station
on the Barwon River, naming it
“Ferrambone. ” Here his efforts
were hampered by the depredations
of the natives, who, in that part of
the country were exceptionally
treacherous and dangerous and a
constant menace to the lives of the
courageous settlers, the pioneer hav-
ing on more than one occasion barely
escaped death at their hands. Some
idea may be formed of the conditions
under which the settlers of the back
blocks existed in those days in New
South Wales, and far more recently
in Queensland, from records which
tell of buildings being loopholed as a
means of repulsing attacks from the
blacks, whose wholesale destruction of
stock on “Ferrambone” finally caused
Mr. Cook to abandon the place
and resulted in his undertaking the
formation of a station on Paradise
Creek, near Inverell, for Mr. H.
Dangar. Subsequently he once more
started on his own account, forming
“Bullcari” Station on Thalaba Creek,
a tributary of the Barwon, and

devoting the run to cattle and
horses. He eventually negotiated
with Mr. H. Dangar for the acquire-
ment of “Nemingha,” a property
situated in the vicinity of Tamworth,
MR. L. G. ROSS.
in exchange for “Bullcari.” He
resided at “Nemingha” until the
year 1869, when he retired to New-
castle, in the vicinity of which, at
Lucerna, on Easter Sunday, March,


1883, he passed away at the age of
eighty. His family consisted of three
sons and one daughter, his second
son, the late John Cook, having been
the founder of “Balnagowan,” near
Mackay. John Cook was born at
“Turanville,” near Scone, New South
Wales, on April 30, 1838, and
educated in Maitland. Following
in his father’s footsteps he became
early identified with the pastoral
industry on the late S. W. Cook’s
station near Tam-
worth, with which
he continued to be
associated until his
marriage in the year
1860, when he en-
tered into possession
of a property in the
New England dis-
trict, a grazing area
which was presented
to him by his father
and known as “The
Serpentine River.”
The possibilities of
the country then
opening up in
Northern Queens-
land were not likely
to be overlooked by
a person of the cal-
ibre of the late John
Cook, who, conse-
quently, was in the
van of those pioneers
who made history
in the district out-
lying the then re-
cently established
settlement of Mac-
kay, becoming, with
the stocking up of
a vast tract of virgin
land in the year
1862, the owner of
“Balnagowan,” the
second station
founded in that
locality. He started
from the “Serpen-
tine River,” his
property in the New
England district
of the Mother State, with 970
cattle, 8 working bullocks, and 22
horses, on May 12, 1862, as the
leader of a party including Mr. Lewis
Gerald Ross (his wife’s brother),
James Muggleton, and two black
boys, and the journey as far as Rock-
hampton was accomplished in the
face of conditions hardly conceivable
in these days of rapid and easy
locomotion. On reaching Rockhamp-
ton he despatched Mr. Ross and the
xx 2
other members of the party ahead
with the stock, while he returned
south by boat to prepare a second
draft of cattle and start them en
route for his newly acquired holding
in Northern Queensland. While
waiting in Rockhampton for a vessel
to convey him to New South Wales
he met for the first time Captain
John Mackay, then also en route for
the south, on business in connection
with a station he had formed on the
Pioneer River which he called
“Greenmount.” The first consign-
ment of stock reached “Balnagowan’
in July, 1862, and was followed by
the second lot early in 1863. Mr.
John Cook resided at “Balnagowan”
for nearly forty years, and from his
home there made his last journey,
crossing the Great Bourne in the
year 1901. The country afterwards
named “Balnagowan” was originally
taken up by (Murray or Robinson)
a member of Captain John Mackay’s
party when they discovered the
district; but, remaining unstocked
after the period prescribed by the
Government in order to render a
claim valid (a matter of nine
months), it became forfeit and was
taken up by Mr. John Cook, who
throughout his long pastoral career
was one of the most highly esteemed
and honoured residents of the
Mackay district. His pastoral
interests included
“Wandoo,” a pro-
perty on the other
side of the Range,
which he purchased
in the year 1872,
and which is now
owned by the gentle-
man under review
and his brother-in-
law, Mr. A. R. Ath-
erton, being, with
“Blue Mountain,”
another holding in
the same ownership,
managed by the
latter gentleman.
The late John Cook
did not confine
his energies to
pastoral pursuits,
but, as one of
the founders and
a director of the
Pleystowe Central
Milling Co., assisted
in no small degree
the rapid develop-
ment of the indus-
try which has caused
Mackay to be recog-
nized as the most
important sugar-
growing centre of
the State. He mar-
ried Elizabeth Cor-
mack, daughter of
Robert and Eliza-
beth Ross (nee Cor-
roack) who were
both descended
from old Scot-
tish stock. Their
son, Lewis Gerald Ross, who took
up, stocked and named “Balna-
gowan” for the late John Cook in
the early sixties, was born at Balna-
gowan Castle, Ross Shire, Scotland.
His death occurred in Mackay, eight
years after his advent to the district,
on March 21, 1870, as the result of
a drowning accident in the Pioneer
River. Mr. A. A. Cook, of “Green-
mount, ” was born at “Balnagowan,”
on September 4, 1875, and educated
MR. S. W. COOK.


at the New England Grammar
School, Armidale, New South Wales,
concluding his studies when in his
middle teens. From school he
returned to his father’s home, and
shortly afterwards employed himself
in the industry to which he has since
devoted himself. He
was placed in charge
of “Wandoo” in
1894 and contin-
ued to manage
that property until
1901, with the ex-
ception of a brief
interval when he
was absent in the
Cook district at a
holding near Cook-
town in which he
was personally in-
terested. After the
death of his father
in 1901 he returned
to “Balnagowan,”
in order to take
over the manage-
ment of the estate
as the late gentle-
man’s trustee. This
property has con-
tinued to occupy his
time and energies,
though in the year
1914 he acquired
“Greenmount,” a
holding to which
considerable inter-
est attaches, in so
much that it is the
very oldest in the
district, having
been stocked up by
Captain Mackay in
February, 1862, the
year following his
discovery of the Pio-
neer River, the site
of the town of
Mackay and all the
outlying country
between the coast
and the Range.
‘‘Balnagowan” was
depastured by the
late John Cook
a few months later.
Mr. A. A. Cook
is interested in over
410 square miles of pastoral
country, being also part owner
of a property in the Nebo dis-
trict. Under his administration
'“Greenmount” and “Balnagowan”
are worked as a single property, and
used for fattening purposes and as
the home of a pure bred stud herd of
Aberdeen Angus cattle, which was
founded on imported pedigreed cows
bred by Mr. H. B. Williams at the
famous “Turihana” Stud, New
Zealand. The stud bulls used in the
first instance were also bred in the
Dominion, at Mr. Branson’s ‘‘Fair-
field” estate, the later importations,
which are the progeny of New
Zealand stock, having come from
“Yundah,” Darling Downs, South-
ern Queensland. Mr. Cook’s “Green-
mount” stud has already proved
beyond dispute the suitability of the
district for raising Aberdeen Angus
cattle, which on account of the
quickness with which they arrive at
maturity, may in a verdant district
such as that which spreads out from
Mackay, be more profitably stocked
than other breeds.
Coupling its situa-
tion with the stage
of development to
which it has been
brought by Mr.
Cook, “Green-
mount” deserves
description as the
“show” place of the
Pioneer watershed,
while its homestead
ranks as one of the
fine and picturesque
modern pastoral
dwellings of the
State. Designed
by Mr. and Mrs.
Cook so as to secure
both convenience
and architectural
beauty, its charm
is heightened by
prettily laid out
grounds, in which
gravelled walks,
wide lawns, and
flower beds find a
place. A summer
house, filled with
sub-tropical plants,
is attached to the
dwelling, which
overlooks gently
sloping acres stretch-
ing for miles to
where the country
is dotted with cane
farms, and finally
meeting in the far
distance a semi-
circle of mountains
on whose sides and
jagged tops the play
of light and shade
produces ever
changing hues of
softened tones. Mr.
Cook has directed
the progressiveness,
which is one of
his most noticeable
characteristics, not only towards the
furtherance of his pastoral operations
but the advancement of the district
generally. Since the year 1901 he
has been a director of the Pleystowe
Milling Co., occupying the position
rendered vacant at the death of his

Government as a Councillor of the

yet continues to support, all move-

In sport, also, he takes a warm
interest, and for a considerable
number of years was a member of
the executive of the Mackay Turf
Club. In the year 1908 he married
Vida Althea, daughter of Mr.
Richard Atherton. Of the union
there are two sons, Thomas Albert

Mrs. Cook’s grandfather, was of
English birth. In the year 1844,
accompanied by his wife and the
seven children then born to him, he

had been following farming pursuits,

voyage reached New South Wales.

was the representations of this son
as to the wonderful potentialities of
the north which caused Mr. Edmund
Atherton to remove to Queensland,
as “Baldblair,” his Armidale pro-
perty, was too limited in area to
allow sufficient scope for his enter-
prise at that time. The latter, after
selling “Baldblair,” came to Queens-
land in 1860 and took up “Mount

pioneers of the Mackay district, with
which he was actively associated from
the sixties until his retirement from
personal participation in pastoral
affairs in the year 1914, Mr. R.
Atherton now resides at Yeerongpilly,
an environ of Brisbane. He was
born in the Maitland district, New
South Wales, on October 26, 1847,
and is the sixth son of the late
Edmund Atherton, with whose
Here he resided for several years,
engaging in pastoral pursuits and
owning “Baldblair” Station, 25
miles from Armidale. His family
consisted of six sons and three
daughters, and of these the two
youngest children were born in the
Mother State. Eight of the family
were destined to make their homes
in Queensland, the first to perma-
nently settle across the border being
the eldest son, James, who owned
“Rosewood,” a station situated on
the Fitzroy River, less than 50 miles
west of Rockhampton, which, in the
tribe from their own word
“Hedloo,” or “mountain,” the latter
method of spelling is strictly correct.
Here the whole family settled (with
the exception of the son already

participated in the making of Aus-
tralian history. Founded in Aus-
tralia by Captain James Beatty, of
the “Triton,” about eighty years
ago, the Beatty family is
represented in Queensland by Mr.
Theophilus Stuart Beatty, whose
eldest son was the former partner of
the firm of Beatty & Haynes. Mr.
Theophilus Stuart Beatty, who was
born in Sydney in the year 1844,
and there educated, is a son of the
Captain Beatty above referred to
and a grandson of another Captain
James Beatty, who held estates in
Jamaica and traded from that port
to London before the abolition of
slavery. Through the marriage of
the last-mentioned gentleman he is
a descendant of the family of which
the famous French general, Jean
Victor Moreau, was a member, whose
niece, a sister of Sir David Moreau,
one-time Governor of the Tower of
London, Captain Beatty married.
From records to hand we quote the
following genealogy of the Queens-
land branch of the Beatty family,
whose motto, handed down with
CREST OF THE BEATTY FAMILY.
their crest, is “Truth is Strength” :
“General Jean Victor Moreau was
the brother of Captain David
Moreau, one-time Governor of the
Tower of London; he married the
daughter of Sir John Houstin, Bart.,
and has issue three daughters and
one son, David. Maria Moreau, the
youngest daughter, married the late
Captain James Beatty, who had
issue one son, James Beatty, mariner,
who married Jemima Yates, of the
House of Stuart.” Captain James
Beatty, of the “Triton,” voyaged
with his wife to Australia in that
vessel and settled originally in
Hobart, but after a brief period of
residence there removed to Victoria,
where, with the eventuation of the
sensational gold discoveries of 1851,
he became a pioneer of the Turon
field, eventually abandoning mining
for grazing pursuits. His son, Mr.
T. S. Beatty, who established the
name in Queensland, arrived in
Chinchilla when at an early age and
became associated with the pastoral
industry as a jackaroo on a Darling

Stations. Having purchased “Glen-
ora” Station during his connection
with the company, he finally
relinquished his position in order to
take over the personal management
of that property. During his career
in North Queensland he was
manager for some years of “Stone-
leigh” Station, on the Herbert River
and later general supervisor of
“Collaroy” and “Orion Downs”
Stations for his brother-in-law, the
late John George Henry Wilson.
On retiring from active connection
with the pastoral industry he made
a home for his wife and children in
Mackay, and has since been promin-
ently identified with the various
bodies whose activities are directed
towards the advancement of the
town and district. He unhesitat-
ingly attributes his success in life to
the loyal sympathy and active
support of Mrs. Beatty, who was a
daughter of the late Mr. William
Tucker Evans, of Orange, and niece
of Allan Cunningham, the famous
botanist and explorer, and a cousin
of Mr. Pagan, the late Commissioner
for Railways in Townsville. The
Haynes family is connected by
marriage with that of Mr. Hughes,
the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth. Three of Mr. T. S. Beatty’s
sons served in the South African
War. The eldest, the late W.
Dacres Beatty, was born in Chin-
chilla in the year 1873 and educated
under tutorial supervision at home,
concluding his studies when at the
age of seventeen. With the object of
becoming proficient in the industry
which had for so long claimed
the energies of his father, he then
proceeded to “Glenora” Station,
near Normauton, where he remained
for three years, at the end of which
period he became one of a droving
party at that time setting out with
cattle from “Glenora” for Bourke,
New South Wales. After his
delivery of the stock at their
destination in the Mother State, he
returned to Queensland and occupied
a position on his uncle’s place “Orion
Downs,” owned by Mr. T. B. S.
MR. H. P. HAYNES.
Wilson, leaving this station after a
few years to accept a post on
“Wellshot,” near Ilfracombe, there
to gain practical experience of
pastoral conditions further west.
He made his first independent essay
in the industry with the selection of
country on the Thomson River. On
selling out of this property he
acquired, in conjunction with Mr.
Foulsham, an area on “Rodney
Downs,” which after working suc-
cessfully for a period the partners
disposed of to the present owners,
Messrs. Shannon & Sons. In the
year 1915 he became senior partner
of the firm of Beatty & Haynes with
the purchase of an interest in
“Nuken,” and erected the fine
dwelling on that property which was
his home until the time of his
death, on June 22, 1919, an
event resulting from pneumonic
influenza, and closing a useful life
and one in which the vicissitudes
of pioneering were experienced to
the full. He spent two years at the
Boer War. The Haynes family
originated in Australia in 1840 with
the advent to Sydney of the late
John Haynes, the great-grandfather
of Mr. H. P. Haynes, the managing
partner of “Nuken.” Mr. John
Haynes, came from Cork, Ireland,
expressly to take over the manage-
ment of “Boorolong,” an historical
pastoral area situated near Armidale
in the Mother State, and now held
by his descendants. With him
arrived a married son, Mr. Richard
Haynes, the grandsire of Mr.
Haynes of “Nuken,” who in 1849
was engaged in the pastoral industry
in Queensland as manager of
‘ Munjure” Station, near Ipswich.
Several sons were born to Richard.
Of these three became distinguished
members of the medical, legal, and
literary professions in Western
Australia and New South Wales,
while another, Charles Alexander
Haynes, ranked during his lifetime
as one of the earliest pastoral
pioneers of Western Queensland.
The last-mentioned gentleman was
born in Brisbane on March 23, 1849,
and from the age of six (having been

left an orphan) resided with his
paternal grandfather at “Booro-
long,” New South Wales, and from
there was sent as a student to the
Armidale Grammar School. On


arriving at the age of fifteen he took
upon himself the whole responsibility
of his future, obtaining work as a
drover, and in the year 1864 set out
with a mob of horses from Armidale
to “Bowen Downs,” Western
Queensland. He spent two years at
“Bowen Downs,” which was then
under the management of the late
B. D. Morehead, and in 1865 joined
the rush to the Palmer goldfields in
the far north, which for a short
period were noted for their
sensational yields. He had many
interesting reminiscences of the
Palmer, both in respect to the
plentifulness of the gold and the
hostility of the natives which was of
so threatening a character that men
were obliged to carry arms and it
was considered inadvisable to travel
in parties of less than twelve, while,
though all camp fires were extin-
guished before dark, it was necessary
was divided into two separate hold-
ings, and on one of these, “Mount
Cornish,” he became stock-keeper
under the then manager, the late
Mr. Rankin. He continued as an
employe on “Mount Cornish” until
the area was placed in charge of the
late E. R. Edkins, who was to prove
to him a life-long friend. In the
year 1872 he explored much of the
Diamantina and Western River lands
and travelled over the country where
the town of Winton now stands. In
1879 Mr. Haynes opened a butcher-
ing business in Muttaburra, and
carried on there for two years, at
the end of which he again entered
the service of the Scottish Australian
Investment Co., taking charge of a
part of the “Mount Cornish” lease
then known as “Bangall,” and the
stud herd of cattle there. “Bangall”
occupied the area now forming
“Brookwood” Station. He remained
the management of “Old Long-
reach” Station, and was occupied
with the duties of this position until
1896, when that station also was cut
up for selection. At this time he
embarked in the industry on his own
account, selecting country on the
western side of the Thomson River,
which his enterprise soon converted
into a paying proposition. Success
attended his efforts until the visita-
tion of the disastrous drought of
1902, which brought to him, as to
many another pioneer, heavy
reverses, crippling his resources
beyond hope of recovery. He died
at the age of sixty-seven after
completing a period of fifty-two years
in this district, where he was
universally respected for his integrity
and his generous support of all worthy
objects. He was survived by his
wife, who was one of the best of
mothers, and five sons and seven
daughters. Of his sons four volun-
teered for enlistment during the
Great War of 1914-18, though only
one was accepted for service at the
front, another being allotted for
home defence. We have already
referred to the brothers of the late
pioneer—the Hon. Richard Septimus
Haynes, K.C., barrister of Perth;
and the late John and Dr. E. Haynes

at “Bangall” until 1888, when much
of the “Mount Cornish” country
was thrown open for selection, and
was then placed in charge of “Table
Derry,” which remained a part of
the original area. In 1893 he was
transferred from “Table Derry" to
in New South Wales, and after
being admitted to the Bar took
control of the offices of Messrs.
Norton and Smith, Sydney, where
he subsequently practised on his own
account for five years. He settled

public men of that town. Always
a keen student of politics he entered

Legislative Assembly in the year
1896. The late Dr. Haynes was a
native of Maitland and qualified for
the medical profession in London in
1886. He settled in Western
Australia four years later, and there
his ability was accorded wide recog-
nition, as was the prominent part
which he took in public, military,
and municipal work. A rising
journalist in New South Wales half
a century ago, when he was on the
staff of the Maitland Mercury, the
late John Haynes was prominently
in the public eye both as a literary
man and a politician until the time
of his death. When on the staff of
the Sydney Evening News he rose
to the position of sub-editor of that
paper, and later, in conjunction
with Mr. J. F. Archibald, founded
that widely-read publication, the
Sydney Bulletin. Subsequently he
issued a venture known as Haynes’
Weekly, and in 1900 purchased
The Elector from Mr. Frank Cotton,
and transformed it into the Sydney
Newsletter , of which he became the
editor in 1905. His Parliamentary
career dates from 1887, when he
entered the New South Wales
Legislative Assembly as one of the
members for Mudgee. He was later
returned for Wellington, which he
represented while that district re-
mained a separate constituency. In
1915, as the result of a by-election,
he became member for Willoughby.
HERBERT PERCY HAYNES,
third son of the late C. A. Haynes
and managing partner of the firm
of Beatty & Haynes, was born at
“Bangall” (now “Brookwood”) rear
Muttaburra, on May 21, 1886. He
was educated by private tuition until
reaching the age of fifteen, when he
entered the pastoral industry under
his father’s supervision. Later he
secured a position at “Bimbah”
under Mr. R. 11. Edkins, with whom
he remained for some time. In the
year 1908, in conjunction with three
of his brothers, he launched out on
his own account, purchasing “Darr
Water Farms,” a grazing area lying
between Longreach and Winton.
Two years later he disposed of his
interests in this property, and
joining forces with Mr. William T.
Evans selected “Nuken,” which was
conducted under the joint adminis-
tration of the owners until 1915,
when Mr. Evans sold his interests
in the property to Mr. W. D.
Beatty, the firm of Beatty and
Haynes being then established.
Since the death of Mr. Beatty, Mr.
H. P. Haynes has administered the
area in the interests of the firm, the
personnel of which includes his
sister, Mrs. Beatty—as her hus-
band’s legatee—and his brother,
PATRICK ROLAND HAYNES,
who was born at “Table Derry,”
near Muttaburra, on May 12, 1892,
and educated at Longreach. On
leaving school he joined his brothers
in the purchase of “Darr Water
Farms,” in the development of
which he assisted until 1911, when
he disposed of his interests in the
property and accepted a droving
engagement. Droving occupied his
energies for some time and eventu-
ally he became employed in pastoral
work under his brother at “Nuken,”
being admitted as a partner in the
firm of Beatty and Haynes in 1920.
THE CREST OF THE HAYNES FAMILY.
“Nuken,” which has a double
frontage of nine miles to the
Diamantina River and embraces an
area of about 57,000 acres lying
some 69 miles west of Winton, was
originally included within the
boundaiues of “Elderslie ” Station.
Sheep are the mainstay of the
property, though a herd of Shor:horn
cattle is also depastured, and consid-
erable attention is devoted to the
breeding of good blood horses.
“Elderslie” and “Nive Downs” ewes
formed the foundation of the flock,
which, averaging a strength of
12,000, is kept up to a high all-
round standard of excellence by the
periodical introduction of rams from
“Boonoke,” New South Wales, and
South Australian studs. The lamb-
ing of “Nuken” averages 50 per
cent. Included among the up-to-
date improvements on the property
are three sub-artesian bores and a
number of dams which amply sup-
plement the natural water supplies
contained in the river.

Comprised of eminently fine cattle

Clark gained the enviable reputation
it now possesses in respect to the

being provided by several streams
intersecting the area., chief of which
is Grosvenor Creek, which, in its

old English family. Her father, the
late John Henry Clark, whose
memory will be handed down to
posterity as one of our most intrepid
pioneers, was born at Mururundi,
New South Wales, in the year 1823.
He was a son of the late Charles
Clark, the founder of the line under
the Southern Cross, who was one of
the earliest pioneers of the Hunter
River district of the Mother State.
The bush, with its varied avocations
and illimitable scope, was the stage
which held his chief interests from
childhood to old age. In the year
1850, while yet in his twenties, he
owned, in conjunction with Messrs.
Foster and Yind, a line of coaches
which were run from New South
Wales to Beech worth, Victoria, and
personally drove the first mail coach
to enter the town. Later he ran
coaches to many of the goldfields of
the Mother State. In the year 1861,

were Mr. Norris, afterwards War-
den’s Orderly in Charters Towers,
and the late Mr. Bailey of Milchester.
On the conclusion of what was a very
strenuous and difficult trip, marked
by incidents that demanded the
finest courage and the most unfailing
endurance and resource, he was
installed as manager of the station,
a position which he occupied for six
possibilities, born from the rapid
development of the North, of the
carrying business, and became the
owner of a number of waggons, which,
loaded with stores on the outward
and wool on the return journey,
he plied between '‘Mount Cornish”
Station and Bowen, then the seaport
of the North and a flourishing town-
ship. It was not long before he took
up “Mount Pleasant,” now a well-
known Northern pastoral property.
At about the same time he acquired
considerable freehold country on
Euri Creek, where he erected an
hotel, which became the headquarters

years, facing, with the same brave
front, all the hardships and sacrifices
which were the lot of the early
pioneer. Of a nature essentially
enterprising, he was quick to see the
from which he worked his several
teams. He enlarged his pastoral
interests in the seventies by the
acquirement of a large area between
the Cape and the Suttor Rivers, from


which he formed “Lornsleigh.”
Some time after taking up “Lorns-
leighj which continued to be his
home until a week or two of his
decease, he purchased “Mount
McConnell,” an adjoining station,
and “Grosvenor Downs,” the well-
known pastoral property described in
the preceding pages. The late J. H.
Clark was regarded as a keen judge
of cattle and horses, and won for
“Lornsleigh” and his other stations
the reputation of carrying excellent
stock of both classes, despite the fact
that (though many fine bulls and
stallions were at different times his
property) he never exhibited in the
show ring. “Richmond,” by “Mari-
byrnong” from “Kestrel,” was a
well-known “Lornsleigh” equine sire
in his day, and was followed by
“Ralston,” an erstwhile favourite on
the Northern turf, and later by

stallions. John Henry Clark was one
of those pastoralists the value of
whose work in the days of early
settlement can never be sufficiently
appreciated and extolled. In the
memory of many his fine and striking
personality still lives. A rare
swimmer and an athlete in every
sense of the word, he was finely
proportioned and considerably ex-
ceeded the average both in breadth
and stature, and was endowed with
physical and moral attributes which
eminently fitted him for the part he
so nobly played in the settlement of
the great untrodden wastes of North-
west Queensland. At his daughter’s
home in Charters Towers on Christ-
mas Day of the year 1917, when at
the age of ninety-four, he passed very
peacefully away, leaving a widow and
two daughters. The former is a
daughter of the late John Geary,
who, of Irish descent and parentage,
was born in New South Wales. Mrs.

South Wales, and has resided in
Queensland for the past forty years.
She shared with steadfast courage
the more strenuous years of her
husband’s career, aiding his every
effort in the myriad ways that have
earned for a wife the term of help-
meet, which, in the many vicissitudes
of their married life, she indeed most
loyally proved herself. Her other
daughter is Mrs. R. Bell, who, at
time of writing, resides in Charters
Towers. The younger, Minnie Maud,
was married to Mr. Cosmo Percy
Gordon in 1907, when in her
eighteenth year, Mr. Gordon at that
time having been engaged in the
management of "Lornsleigh” for the
late pioneer. Born in the Nebo
district, Queensland, he is a descend-
ant of an old English family which
contributed many members to the
ministry of the Church of England.
Mr. and Mrs. Gordon have a family
of five sons and three daughters.

which attaches to the well-known
pastoral area known as “Mount
Elsie.” Embracing 130 square miles
of cattle country, the nature of which
is chiefly indicated by open forests
and spinifex lands alternating with
belts of brigalow scrub, it is excel-
lently watered by the Cape River and
its tributaries, the supplies thus
naturally afforded being amply
supplemented by several dams and
two wells. On the pastures are
grazed about 3,000 cattle, this herd
having been founded in the early
days on a very small nucleus of
healthy shorthorn stock of pure
breeding and carefully chosen bulls
of the same strain acquired from
neighbouring stations. Though still
principally made up of pure short-
horns, a few Devon cattle are also
included in its numbers, the latter
being of comparatively recent intro-
duction and proving highly suitable
to the country. Throughout their
lengthy proprietorship of “Mount
Elsie,” both Messrs. Miles and
Clarence used extreme care in the
choice of bulls, and the enviable
reputation which the station bears in
the North for the quality of its
stock strongly testifies to the excel-
lence of their judgment. Since it was
taken up by Mr. Miles, the bound-
aries of the run have varied some-
what, the partners having acquired
additional country from time to time,
but the policy of resumption exer-
cised by respective governments
reduced it to its original dimensions,
which are recorded above. From the
time of its foundation, horse-breed-
ing has also been carried on with the
object of providing for station
requirements, though occasionally a
surplus has arisen which, being
readily disposed of, has gained a good
name for the equine stock produced
on “Mount Elsie.” The homestead
and its surroundings present the
appearance of a small village. It is
typically representative of the
growth and development of the
pastoral industry in Northern
Queensland, though the old bark hut

which originally served the pioneer
and his wife for a dwelling no longer
stands, it having been replaced in
the eighties by a comfortable cottage
that occupies a site among the build-
ings and very up-to-date outhouses
erected at later periods, chiefly
within the past ten years. Than the
founder of “Mount Elsie,” the late
Michael Miles, few of our pioneers
accomplished more for the State
through the channels of industry in
the hard, rough times of early settle-
ment. Descended from an old family
of Sussex, England, he was born in
Rotherfield, in that County, on
November 17, 1829, and is a son of
Dr. Michael Miles, who was a mem-
ber of the medical faculty and a
resident of Eridge, Sussex, for 62
years. Dr. Miles’ death occurred at
the age of 86, and his widow and
daughters continued to occupy
“Meadow Bank,” the home which he
made for them at Eridge Green,
Tunbridge Wells, until (with the
exception of his youngest child, who,
when bereaved of her dear ones,
removed to a new home) they also
were called beyond the bourne. Dr.
Miles was one of the most highly
esteemed and representative men of
Eridge, and his worth was eloquently
recorded in a sermon preached on
October 25, 1868, the Sunday follow-
ing his funeral, at Eridge church, of
which he had filled the office of
Church-warden from the time of its
consecration. Mr. Michael Miles
was only 20 years of age when he
came to Australia, having previously
followed a brief career at sea. His
temperament was of the kind which
found its proper environment in the
bush, and his earliest occupation
was as a drover in Victoria, where he
first arrived in the year 1849. For
a time he continued to occupy him-
self with pastoral pursuits in Vic-
toria, subsequently removing to New
South Wales, where, until 1859, he
followed stock and station work,
which he varied with droving
experiences. In the last year of the
fifties he came to Queensland, and in

1861 set out from Rockhamnton with
the late Edward Cunningham and
Mr. Philip Somer for the recently
discovered settlement of Bowen, with
the view of exploring from this centre


country likely to prove suitable for
pastoral purposes. The three gentle-
men accompanied the late George
Elphinstone Dalrymple’s party, which
was then setting out to officially
found the township of Bowen.
Shortly after arrival there, Mr. Miles
and his companions put into effect
their intention in coming north, and
the party, augmented by Mr. Sten-
house and led by the late Edward
Cxxnningham, undertook, over a vast
tract of xxnknowxx country, a journey
which has become historical. Mr.
Miles’ enterprise at this time led to
the establishment of the firm of
Messrs. Favenc, Wise, and Miles.
Mr. Favenc was an uncle of Ernest
Favenc, the author and explorer.
The country taken up by Mr. Miles
extended past the Fanning and
Burdekin Rivers to the site now
occupied by Charters Towers, and
portion of it lay on the Starr River,
this being now included in the area
comprising “Dotswood” Station. To
the venture, which he conducted in
the eaxdy sixties on behalf of the firm
of which he was a member, Mr. Miles
gave the name of “Bridge,” after his
old home place in England, and his
whole energy, his wide experience

and capacity for endurance and hard
work were applied to the develop-
ment of the property. In these
luxurious times it is difficult to
visualize the difficulties and hardships
yy2
which hampered the task of the
pioneers or to conceive the sacrifices
which their enterprise demanded.
Hitherto untested climatic conditions,
marked by appalling floods or

devastating droughts; low prices or
the total absence of markets; the diffi-
culties of communication with the
outer world; treacherous hostility
from the aborigines, were among the
things they faced with an undaunted
front, and Mr. Miles was in the van
of those whose endurance and courage
cannot be sufficiently extolled.
Contemporary pioneers then operat-
ing in the district spreading out from
Bowen were the late Edward Cun-
ningham, the Allinghams, Hanns,
Philip Somer, and Mr. Stenhouse.
Mr. Miles left the Burdekin in the
year 1863 to take over the manage-
ment of “Barcaldine Downs,” then
recently formed in the central district
of the State. Here he remained for
about four years. In 1869 he
entered into partnership with Mr. W.
Chatfield, and in conjunction with
that gentleman purchased “Natal
Downs” and the adjoining run,
“Peegurrima. ” Messrs. Chatfield
and Miles devoted “Natal Downs”
to sheep under the management of
the former gentleman, and “Peegur-
rima” to cattle. Mr. Miles adminis-
tered “Peegurrima” until the part-
nership was dissolved. In the year
1874 he took up two blocks of country
on the Cape River and formed the
now historical “Mount Elsie”
Station from very small beginnings,
naming the run after his first-born —
who is now the wife of Mr. F. W.
Giles—and from an elevation near
which the site of the homestead was
chosen. On first taking up the
station, he was joined by his nephew,
Mr. T. F. Clarence, then a mere lad,
who thenceforwards, throughout the
term of a long pastoral career, con-
tinued to identify himself with his
uncle’s interests, following worthily
the fine example of the elder man,
whose equal he proved in steady
application and tenacity of purpose,
and in those qualities of uprightness
which distinguished the best types of
our pioneers and had so marked an
influence in establishing what may
be termed a distinguishing character-
istic of those whose work and
interests are of the bush. Mr. Miles
started “Mount Elsie” with sixty
heifers which he purchased from
“Biralee” Station on the Bowen
River. He bred from this nucleus,
to which he added eight years later
by the purchase of a mob of about
300. Breeding gradually with care-

time brought the “Mount Elsie” herd
to a numerical strength equal to the
majority in the North, and to a
standard of quality surpassing most.

ist, whole-heartedly participating in

oldest Justices of the Peace in
Queensland at the time of his death,
which occurred as recently as the
year 1922, creating a gap in the fast
thinning ranks of those courageous
and gallant souls who made the
country habitable for posterity. It is
well over half a century since he was
granted his commission. His life
was brimful of vicissitudes, in which
droughts, floods, and epidemics
amongst the stock figured largely.
The many heart-breaking experiences
that fell to his lot were tided over
with indomitable courage and
perseverance characteristics un-
doubtedly strengthened by the
practical and moral support of one
who proved herself a true wife in
every sense of the word, shirking
neither hardship nor sacrifice, nor
even, in the early days, the actual
work of a pioneer, so that the efforts
of her husband should be fruitful of
results. To make for, him a home on
the fringe of settlement, Mrs. Miles
undertook the perilous journey over
many miles of roadless and little
travelled country from Bowen,
risking attacks from the natives, the
daughters. Of these, two are
unmarried, the eldest being the wife
of Mr. Francis William Giles, to

John Clarence was Robert Clarence,
who was assessed in Sampford in the
year 1523, as shown in the Subsidy
Rolls preserved in England from that
period. The name has been thus
prominent in Sussex and Essex for
centuries, the family, formerly,
having been landowners in Great and
Little Sampford, in the latter
County, and as such frequently
assessed in Subsidy Rolls which are
yet extant in the archives of the
Mother Country. From these and
other records the line may be traced
in unbroken descent down to the
present day; and it is shown that it
contributed many eminent men of
various professions to the service of
their country, one of whom was
Judge Clarence, who died at Caxton
Hall (Devon) in 1916. Educated at
Paddington House College, the
academy of the late Dr. Stanley,
LL.D., he concluded his studies
there when at the age of fifteen to
enter the office of his uncle, Mr.
Giles, deeming a grounding in com-
mercial work as likely to prove useful
in whatever walk of life he should
eventually decide to follow, which in
his case proved to be that marked by
pastoral enterprise. His association
with the great industry, which is the
backbone of the State’s prosperity,
began shortly after the advent of his
seventeenth birthday, on which he
left Sydney to join his uncle by
marriage, Mr. Michael Miles, at
“Peegurrima” Station, Northern
Queensland. Arriving in Bowen in

unaccompanied, on the long overland
journey to the station —a journey
then presenting many dangers and
terrors to even seasoned bushmen, foi
the loneliness of the rough route by
which he found his way over 200

ing, was so absolute as to make an
unwary traveller an easy prey to the

the whites, at the period, existed
much ill-feeling and misunderstand-
ing. However, he arrived at the
station without mishap, and, under
the auspices of Mr. Miles, began a
career in the industry which was
destined to be fruitful of results and
to have no small bearing on the
pastoral development of the district.
In those early days he formed a life-
long friendship with the late Allister
McDonald, then one of the notable
men of the industry in the North. A
few months after his arrival he left
“Peegurrima” with Mr. Miles, and
was thus with the late gentleman
from the start of operations on
“Mount Elsie.” Entering thoroughly
into the spirit of his uncle’s
enterprise, the lad worked hard to
make the undertaking a success, and
his labours brought him an interest
in the now historic property, with
which he has continued to be
associated in ownership for nearly
fifty years. Even before leaving his
teens he was entrusted with con-
siderable responsibility, often com-
bining the duties of management
with the arduous work among the
stock. On the retirement of Mr.
Miles from active participation in
the running of the station, a re-
adjustment of the firm occurred, and,
under the new arrangement, Mr.
Clarence became the senior partner,
he having for some time previously
solely administered the affairs of the
station. He continued to be thus
occupied until the year 1914, when
he took an extended trip to the Old
World, leaving his cousin, Mr. Giles,
in charge. The latter has since
controlled operations among the
stock at “Mount Elsie,” Mr.
Clarence, finding ample occupation
in attention to details not actually
connected with the work of
the run. He has proved himself
throughout his long sojourn in the
district, by supporting all move-
ments tending to its advancement, a
thoroughly public-spirited citizen.
Always a lover of a good horse, he will
be remembered as a hearty supporter
of clean sport and a crack rider in
local amateur racing. His kindliness
as a host at “Mount Elsie” has well
seconded the welcome so gracefully
accorded to their guests by his
partners. It is not out of place to
mention here that the late Michael
Miles, his wife, and daughters, by
innumerable kindly actions, caused
the name of the station to become
synonymous with the terms hospi-
tality, neighbourliness, and good
feeling.

matriculating shortly afterwards.
Less than two years later, being
attracted by the untrammelled con-
ditions of open-air life, he responded
to the “call of the bush” and
became jackaroo on “Barooga” Sta-
tion, on the Murray River. Here
he remained for ten years, making
a close study of the sheep industry
in all its phases under the direction
of the resident partner of the firm
which owned the property, Mr. Pat-
rick McFarland, who was recognized
as one of the leading sheep stud-
masters of the country. Establishing
a high standard in connection with
his operations in the sheep industry,
the above-named gentleman spared
to devote his future career he relin-
quished his post at “Barooga,” and
in 1891 came to Central Queensland,
where he took up 10,000 acres of
country, originally a part of “Well-
shot” resumption, to which the name
of “Vermont” afterwards was given.
In partnership with the late James
Francis Cudmore, formerly of “Milo”
Station, near Adavale, he founded
a stud flock on the “Vermont” hold-
ing, for the purpose of breeding
rams for use on “Tara” Station,
owned by Messrs. Cudmore & Sons,
and for prospective purchasers. A
few “Vermont” (N.S.W.) rams
purchased from Messrs. Clarke Bros,
at Brisbane, and 600 aged stud ewes
from Mr. A. J. Murray’s “Mount
Crawford” flock in the year 1895,
all but one of the “Vermont” rams
being discarded after the first lamb-
ing, the yolk carried by them being
unsuitable to local conditions. Five
years later Mr. Alexander became
sole proprietor of the “Vermont”
property. In 1904, when part of
“Saltern Creek” was thrown open
for selection, he secured, in partner-
ship with Mrs. Alexander, two
blocks which form portion of his
present property, the area of this
holding being increased two years
later by the purchase of an adjoining
block, bringing the total acreage up
to about 48,000. In 1908 he

neither pains nor capital in his efforts
to produce first-class stock, and his
methods, which were the outcome of
a vast store of experience gained in
different parts, were closely followed
by Mr. Alexander, who in course of
time was invested with larger
responsibilities, his interest in his
subject, coupled with intelligence,
industry, and study eventually
fitting him for the post of manager,
which he occupied during the last
five years of his connection with
“Barooga.” Having thus laid the
foundation of his subsequent success
as a pastoralist through the excellent
grounding which he had received in
the industry to which he intended
of pure Boonoke strain purchased
from the late F. S. Falkiner, formed
the nucleus of this stud. It was
the intention of the partners to
introduce Boonoke stud rams and to
maintain that strain, but owing to
dry seasons and other difficulties
which arose from time to time this
plan was not adhered to. Later stud
rams were imported from “Rnine
Park” and “Mount Crawford”
Stations, South Australia, Mr.
Alexander personally visiting South
Australia for the purpose of secur-
ing these animals. Since this

he purchased the “Minnie Downs”

Queensland in the early forties by
Messrs. Archer Bros., with sheep
from the old L.U.E. flock in New
South Wales, which was founded in
the year 1823 from pure bred

tory of the stud, "Minnie Downs”
subsequently passed into the hands
of Messrs. William Irving and

married in the year 1897 Frances
Catherine, eldest daughter of the
late Arthur Raymond Brown, who
during his lifetime was a notable
figure in the pastoral world of
Central Queensland, which portion
of the country he pioneered in the
early sixties. Mr. Brown was the
second son of the late Captain John
Crago Brown, who came to New
South Wales from Tasmania in his
own ship in the early part of the
last century and there married a
daughter of the late Robert Peel
Raymond, who was the first Post-
master-General of New South Wales,
having been appointed to the office
in the year 1829, and retained it
until May, 1851, when his career
was ended by death. On the com-
pletion of his education, which was
conducted at King’s School, Parra-
matta, the late A. R. Brown pro-
ceeded to “Malvern Hills,” a well-
known station in the vicinity of
Blackall, Queensland. He was sub-
sequently appointed manager of this
property, and his term of adminis-
tration proved an unqualified success.
In the early seventies he was tendered
the management of “Saltern Creek,”
a Western Queensland property then
recently taken up by the Messrs.
Wienholt Bros. “Saltern Creek”
was at that time wdiat is generally
described as a “dry” run, being lack-
ing in permanent water. Under Mr.
Brown’s control this drawback was
obviated and other necessary devel-
opment completed; and the station
continued to be his headquarters
until the time of his death, which
occurred at Barcaldine and caused
a distinct loss to the district of which
he had been for so long a resident.
In the year 1921 Mrs. Alexander
passed away. Mr. Alexander has a
surviving family of four sons and two
daughters. Of the former the eldest
is yet in his teens and at time of
writing is studying the industry to
which his father has devoted his
energies for so many years.

LEWIS VON STTEGLTTZ. The
original pioneer of the von Stieglitz
family under the Southern Cross,
Frederick Lewis, Baron von Stieg-
litz, who was of Irish birth and
MR. C. H. VON STIEGLITZ.
Saxon parentage, settled in Tasmania
over 100 years ago. Numerous his-
torical records show that he was a
descendant of a noble family which,
styled variously as Stiglitz and Steg-
litz, lived in Pomerania in the 13th
and 14th centuries, and held landed
property in Mark of Brandenburg.
Archives dating from the middle of
the 14th century, at which time their
identification with Pomerania ceases,
lead to the assumption that the Steg-
litz family migrated to Bohemia at
that period, when it was ennobled
by Emperor Rudolph 11. Other 14th
century records mention its members
as holders of various public positions
in the Bohemian town of Pilsen and
as landowners in its neighbourhood.
Annals of a later period mention
Bartholomew Stieglitz and his four
sons John Laidislaw, Caspar,
Andrew, and Bartholomew. These,
siding with the Protestants, were
implicated in the religious and poli-
tical troubles involved in the Thirty
Years’ War, and their name is to be
found amongst the lists of those who
fell in battle or were executed or
exiled. Caspar, who had been em-
ployed in the Archives of Prague,
was exiled to Saxony, and there lived
in comparative poverty, supporting
himself as a schoolmaster. However,
the family appears to have soon
established its prestige amid newer
surroundings, for Melchior Stieglitz,
son of Melchior, who was the eldest
son of Caspar above-mentioned, was
at the time immediately preceding
his death in 1692 Procurator of the
Court of Justice in Leipzig, while
many of the name became doctors
and associates of the faculty of law
and held high positions. Of these
one was Christian Ludwig (Lewis)
Stieglitz, who became Doctor of Law
in Leipzig in 1699, and subsequently
Private Councillor to the King of
Poland, Elector of Saxony, Assessor
of the Judicatory Court, Consul of
Leipzig, etc. In the early part of
the Seven Years’ War against
Prussia this Christian Ludwig Stieg-
litz was taken as a hostage to Madge-
burg, being at the time (June, 1757)

nearly eighty years of age. He re-
turned to Leipzig after a brief period
and died there in July, 1758. His
great patriotism and some pecuniary
aid which he had rendered to the
Emperor Jospehus 11. was recognized
by that monarch in the form of a
charter of nobility granted to his two
sons, Christian Ludwig and William
Ludwig and their heirs for ever.
This charter was dated at Vienna,
December 5, 1765, and entitles the
family to use the prefix "von” and
a noble coat of arms. The sons of
the great patriot all occupied im-
portant positions, the eldest. Dr.
Christian Ludwig von Stieglitz, hav-
ing succeeded to his public employ-
ments, titles, and landed estates, but
being eventually threatened with the
same fate as befell his father,
namely, that of being sent as a
hostage to Prussia, became a volun-
tary exile from Leipzig and settled
with his lady and children at Schnee-
berg, in the Hartz Mountains.
Christian L. von Stieglitz married
Christina Fredericka, only daughter
of a wealthy banker named Richter.
He had five children, the eldest, also
Christian Ludwig, having been a
Doctor of Laws, a member of the
Senate, Proconsul in Leipzig, Canon
of the Cathedral of Wirtzen, and an
author. His two youngest sons were
born in Schneeberg. They were
Henry Lewis (from whom the
gentlemen under review are directly
descended) and Augustus Lewis von
Stieglitz. Henry Lewis was born on
March 2, 1762. On reaching man-
hood he entered his uncle Richter’s
counting house, and after several
years so gained the confidence of that
gentleman that he was entrusted
with affairs of the greatest respon-
sibility, and but for certain difficul-
ties made by the Court of Saxony,
due to the secret interference of a
rival house in Leipzig through one
of the Ministers, ’”ould have been

fied the Court of Saxony as to the
success of his mission, was instructed
to extend his voyage to England.
He set sail for Margate in the vear
1786, and during the following


eighteen months travelled over most
of the island, while in London being
presented to the English Queen (the
wife of George III.) by the Saxon
Ambassador. On the conclusion of
his travels he reported to the Saxon
Court at Dresden. Subsequently he
returned to England and visited
Scotland and Wales, and later Ire-
land, where he eventually settled.
He married on Anril 20, 1802, Char-
lotte, third daughter of Mr. John
Atkinson, of Kilmore and Will-
mount, and purchased “Annamory,”
near Blackwater town, calling the
property “Lewis Hill,” which, how-
ever, he afterwards disposed of in
order to take up his residence in
Belfast, where better facilities
offered for the education of his chil-
dren, of whom at that time there
were six. Eventually he sold his Bel-
fast house and purchased “Rose-
mount,” near Loghgall, County
Armagh, and on disposing of this
property removed to Cookstown.
Before leaving Saxony he had pur-
chased, in conjunction with his
youngest brother, a large estate, but
on account of the wars of the time
had no communication from the
latter for six years, at the end of

They were largely interested in the
pastoral development of Tasmania
and Victoria, the eldest, Frederick
Lewis, Baron von Stieglitz, having
owned a property near Cullenswood,
of retrieving the family fortunes,
which had suffered considerably as
the result of an unfortunate invest-
ment made by a trustee in Ireland
after the death of his father. He
there married a widow, a Mrs. Ran-
som, whose daughter Ann became the
wife of Francis Walter. Baron von
Stieglitz was twice married, on the
second occasion to a Miss Blacker, of
“Carrickblacker,” County Armagh,
where at his seat, “The Glen,”
Newry, he died on May 14, 1866.
He was a member of the Legislative
Council of Tasmania under Sir Wil-
liam Denison’s Government. His
other brothers were all station
owners in Victoria. Francis Walter
von Stieglitz had a property near
Avoca, in Tasmania, which he called
“Lewis Hill,” and another named
“Ormley.” His family consisted
of several sons and three daughters,
one of his sons having; entered the
medical profession and practised in
London; while another, Caspar
Harry von Stieglitz, was the father
of Messrs. O. F. and R. L. von
Stieglitz, of Western Queensland.
Francis Walter von Stieglitz died in
the year 1890. Caspar Harry von
Stieglitz married on June 21, 1877,

a native of Fife, Scotland, whose
wife was a Miss Bennett, a descend-
ant of a Cornish family which

brother Francis Walter, arrived in

from the Old World by the prospects
contributed many members to the
engineering profession both in Eng-
land and Tasmania, and settled in
the Apple Isle in 1842, the vear in
which the Wardlaws also arrived.


The Wardlaws were descendants of
old farming stock and were identified
with agricultural enterprise in the
early days of Tasmania. ROBERT
LEWIS VON STIEGLITZ, the
eldest son of the late Caspar Harry
von Stieglitz, was born near Swan-
sea, on the east coast of Tasmania,
on December 17, 1881, and ere com-
pleting his tenth year was, on
account of the death of his father,
placed in the care of his maternal
uncle, Mr. Robert Wardlaw, who
then resided at “Woodlawn,” a free-
hold grazing property owned bv a
member of the family. Mr. Ward-
law was the eldest son of the founder
of that family in Australia. At
“Woodlawn,” as in his father’s life-
time, the education of the gentleman
under review was conducted under
private tuition, and here, on the
conclusion of his schooldays, he
entered the pastoral industry, working
Situated about 40 miles from Rich-
mond, its nearest postal and railway
town, his property, on which he
bestowed the name of “Roscarvon,”
consists of 20,000 acres of open Mit-
chell grass downs intersected by
Cassilis and Alick Creeks. At time
of writing it is in course of develop-
ment for sheep, with which class of
stock it is already partly depastured.
Mr. R. L. von Stieglitz is a member
of both the Masonic and Oddfellows’
Societies, and has filled the several
offices of the latter institution. He
is an active supporter of amateur
racing and other forms of sport and
a member of the amateur racing
clubs of the district. OSCAR
FRANCIS YON STIEGLITZ is
also of Tasmanian birth, having first
seen the light at the family home
near Swansea on April 3, 1883. His
father’s death occurring when he was
about eight years of age he was
administrations of Mr. Wardlaw
and Mr. Brabazon, he was occupied
.for over eight years. “Farewell,” a
block resumed from “Elderslie” Sta-
tion, being in the market in 1918,
he became its purchaser, and resign-
ing his position on the latter pro-
perty immediately took possession of
the former, which consists of 20,000
acres of particularly fine pastoral
land, the nature of which is indicated
by open brown soil and a prolific
growth of Mitchell and Flinders
grasses. The run is well timbered,
gidya scrubs and whitewood trees
and the coolibah which flourishes on
the banks of Farewell, Middle, and
Dinner Creeks, three waterways
which intersect it, providing excel-
lent shade for the stock. Abundant
water is conserved in three dams,
while in normal seasons good natural
supplies are retained for half the
year in lagoons formed in the
under his uncle for fifteen years.
At the end of that neriod he decided
to visit Queensland and make him-
self familiar with the conditions
under which the industry is here
conducted, with which object in
1913 he accepted a post on “Elders-
lie” Station, where his brother Oscar
was at that time engaged as over-
seer. After spending some time at
“Elderslie” he relinquished his post
to assist Mr. O. F. von Stieglitz in
the development of “Farewell,” a
property which the latter purchased
at about that time. His work on
“Farewell” occupied him until the
year 1920, when, being the fortunate
drawer of an excellent grazing block
from a resumption of “Cassilis” Sta-
tion, he was able to materialize the
intention which brought him from
Tasmania, namely, to make an
independent start as a grazier.

received into the home of his
maternal grandfather, the elder
Robert Wardlaw, and there resided
until the age of seventeen, when he
entered the Tasmanian Department
of Education and was sent as a pupil

position he continued to advance
until promoted to the headmastership
of a school at Roseberry, from
whence he was later transferred in
a similar capacity to Gormanston, a
town on the western coast of the
island. He relinquished his post as
a teacher to take up pastoral life,
to which he was initiated as a
jackaroo on “Elderslie” Station in
Queensland, then owned by tire

A D. Ramsay. Here he filled
various positions, being finally ap-
pointed as overseer, in which
capacity, under the successive

ARTHUR SHEPHERD, J.P.,

ern Queensland, was born in Middle-
sex, England, on August 8, 1863,
and is the youngest son of the late
MR. A. SHEPHERD.
Ralph Hardy Shepherd, a scion of
an old Norfolkshire family who
were the possessors of farming lands
in that County from a period dating
MR. A. W. SHEPHERD.
far back in its history. Mr. A.
Shepherd, the founder of the
Queensland branch of the line, was
destined for a sea-faring care-er, and,
zz
on the conclusion of his education,
which was conducted primarily at
a National School in London, and
subsequently, at the old Cooper’s
Chartered School, was found a post
on a vessel bound for Australia.
He had not completed his fifteenth
year when he reached Townsville,
this being in 1878, but he was suc-
cessful in securing a post as jack-
aroo on a pastoral property in the
district outlying that town. Less
than a couple of years later the
eventuation of the Woolgar rush
directed his steps to that field.
Then he joined the late Edward
Mytton of “Wando Vale” and “Oak
Park” Stations, who was supplying
cattle and beef to the fields. This
was the first step in an association
with the late pioneer which lasted
for twenty years, for the first three
of which his duties included the
usual operations among stock on a
cattle run and their management on
the roads. In the course of the ten
or twelve years which followed his
employment by the latter gentleman
his administrative operations were
varied with numerous droving trips,
in the carrying out of which he
became well known on the stock
routes of the districts outlying
Townsville and Charters Towers as
one of the most capable cattle drov-
ers of his time, his journeys extend-
ing, not only to the coast, but as
far as New South Wales and other
Southern States, which in those days
often offered the only markets for
stock. Meanwhile, his keenness,
energy and perseverance, and his
thoroughness in detail as well as in
the larger issues justified the con-
fidence of his employers, with whom
he entered into partnership in the
early nineties with the acquirement
of an interest in ‘Wando Vale.”
Almost simultaneously with his
entry into the ranks of the pastoral
landowners, however, Northern
Queensland was struck by the disas-
trous tick visitation which the
fatal fever that robbed the State of
such a heavy percentage of stock and
deferred for a time the reward which
was due to the strenuous efforts and
unceasing strain of previous years.
“Oak Park” had been sold before
the advent of the tick pest, but the
“Wando Vale” herd was among
those which suffered most severely,
being depleted to the extent of 76
per cent. After the death of Mr.
Mytton, Mr. Shepherd retired from
the management of “Wando Vale”
and in the year 1902 purchased an
adjoining station called “Pandanus
Creek,” which occupied a site at the
heads of the Clarke and Broken
Rivers and was originally stocked
and taken up by the McKinlay

MR. H. SHEPHERD.
This property was originally
taken up by Alfred Taylor and
formerly covered a considerable
mileage, part of which has since


been resumed for closer settlement
purposes. The present “Milray”

lent cattle country situated on the

Great Northern Railway, and is held
in conjunction with three blocks of

den and adjoining “Wonga Lee.”
“Delbessie,” which consists of nearly
15,000 acres, was originally taken
up by Mr. Chisholm, later owner of
a Western Queensland holding
known as “The Plains,” and a very
old pioneering identity of the North.
“The Plains” has since been ac-
quired by Mr. Shepherd. In earlier
days it was devoted to sheep, but,
eventually, as the depredations
of the dingoes became increasingly
difficult to cope with, the attempt
to run flocks was abandoned and it
was converted into a cattle run.
Mr. Shepherd has accomplished
much in the way of development on
“Delbessie,” the many improvements
inaugurated and completed under
his administration including two
sub-artesian bores that amply sup-
plement a very fair natural water
supply afforded by Galah, Crescent
and other creeks by which it is inter-
sected, and render the run very safe,
even in abnormally dry seasons.

from the blacks, who were then both
numerous and treacherous. He
managed to escape trouble at their
hands, however, and accomplished
the trip to the satisfaction of his
employers. Subsequently he became
overseer on “Dunumbral” Station, a
rather important run in New South
Wales, situated near Walgett, be-

Queensland. The position appear-
ing desirable both from a remunera-
tive point of view and in the light
of the additional experience to be
gained in connection with the exten-
sive scope of operations carried out
on the property under (to him)
unfamiliar conditions, he decided to
avail himself of the opportunity thus
afforded, entering upon his duties in
the year already mentioned. Dur-
ing his sojourn at “Terrick-Terrick”
the annual output of wool from this
station usually exceeded 4,700 bales
shorn from a flock averaging a
strength of over 320,000. From
the foregoing facts it will be

valuable experience which it in-

and on relinquishing his duties
there, indulged in a well-earned
holiday to the land which had
nurtured his forbears. On his

resulted in the offer and his accept-
ance in 1896 of the management of
“Kilcummin” Station, a holding
occupying 1,600 square miles of
country in the vicinity of “Peak
Downs," owned by the Australian
Estates and Mortgages Co. For the
ensuing twenty years he continued
to administer “Kilcummin,” filling
also the position of Pastoral Inspec-
tor of various properties owned by
the Company, being promoted to
the more important post in 1907
and continuing in that capacity,
which entailed the oversight of a
dozen or more properties, includ-
ing “Cotherstone,” “Langton,”
“Loglan,” “Hobartville,” and other
large and important grazing areas
in Queensland, for the follow-
ing nine years. Among the pro-
perties which, in addition tc
“Kilcummin” he actually controlled
in the past, were “Avon Downs, ’
“Dagworth,” “Penola Downs,”
“Cambridge Downs,” “Granada,”
“Manuka,” “Mount Morris,” and
“Mount Margaret.” During his

involved in this department, being
sceptical as to the benefits likely to

reposed in Mr. Sutherland by his
employers was amply rewarded by
the large measure of success which
followed his vigorous policy. His
wide experience and expert know-
ledge as a pastoralist were largely
availed of by his contemporaries in

Mr. J. V. Kirby was educated under
private tuition in his father’s home,
and at an early age was initiated into
the routine of stock and station work
on the paternal acres, the old pioneer
having adopted the wise course in
training his sons for a successful
pastoral career, of familiarizing them
by their actual performance of the
work of the station, with the many-
sided aspects of the industry. The

eldest son of the late Robert AVilliam
Duncombe, a native of the same
State, who was born in the Hawkes-
bury River district. The late R.
W. Duncombe was of Scottish
parentage, his father, Robert Dun-
combe, having landed in Australia
over three quarters of a century ago,
afterwards becoming one of the
earliest settlers in New South Wales,
where he followed farming pursuits
until the time of his death. This
old pioneer was also interested in the
pastoral industry, owning in part-
nership with his cousin a grazing
property in the Mother State known
as “Laura” Station. In the past,
through several successive genera-
tions, the Buncombes were identified
with primary production in Scotland,
many of the name being still to the
fore in the agricultural life of their
native Shire. The late R. W.
Duncombe was one of seven sons
born to the founder of that branch
of the family now represented by the
owner of “Glenelg,” and when quite
a young man started on an indepen-
dent career as a farmer. Finding
his opportunities somewhat restricted
in this calling, he disposed of his
holding and directed his energies
into wider channels of interest by
securing droving and other contracts,
and in the former connection became
a well-known figure on the New
South Wales stock routes. Subse-
quently, he established a connection
as a dealer in stud bulls, his
enterprise leading him to purchase
stock from the principal studs in
New South Wales and travel the
animals to the far-out stations of the
Never-never, selling to owners who,
by his initiative, had opportunities
of improving their stock such as in
the majority of cases would have been
denied them, graziers in the back-
blocks in those days seldom caring to
incur the risk involved in the
importation of valuable sires. He
thus, in the course of a strenuous
career marked by hardship, losses,
and sacrifices, advanced the interests
of the great industry with which he
was associated, continuing as a cattle
and horse dealer until the year
1894, when he crossed the Great
Divide, survived by a family of three
sons. Of these, Robert William
represented the family at the Great
War theatre, serving his country for
three years on the Egyptian front
as a member of the Fifth Australian
Light Horse. He now owns grazing
country in the vicinity of “Corfield,”
supervising his own interests in
conjunction with the management of
“Glenelg” which he conducts on
behalf of Mr. C. R. Duncombe, the

district, fulfilling the duties inci-
dental to the position until the year
1898, when he was commissioned by
the owners to travel a large flock of
sheep from the Blackall district to
“Essex Downs,” on the Flinders
River. On arrival at “Essex
Downs” he was appointed to the
management of that property, the
conduct of which occupied his ener-
gies for some time. Later, he was
again busily employed in the fulfil-
ment of droving contracts, being so
occupied throughout the prevailing
disastrous drought, the heavy de-
mands then made on his services
demonstrating the opinion in which
his capabilities were held by the
pastoralists of the district. Weary-
ing of the arduousness of the life, he
seized upon the opportunity of a
change which presented itself
through the offer of the lease of the
Central Hotel, at Chillagoe, filling
the role of “mine host” of that
hostelry for about two years. He
sold out this business when the
decline of the mining industry set
in, and returning to North-western
Queensland purchased the Manuka
Hotel at Corfield, carrying on there
with a view to securing an income

grazing country which he shortly
afterwards secured in the vicinity of
that town. To the improvement of
the area, which he designated
“Glenelg,” and which is situated at
a distance of 10 miles from Corfield
and 70 miles from Hughenden, his
attention is now chiefly directed,
though he still retains the proprietor-

abundant growth of coolibah along

the nature of the run. Three eub-

course through the property and
provide excellent water for the stock.
Mr. Duncombe is a well-known
supporter of the national sport, his
successes on the turf being frequent,
not only in the North-west but on
the metropolitan courses. His horse,
“Bushwind,” by “Eurasian” (imp.),
bred on “Lammermoor” Station, was
successful in winning a welter
handicap at Ascot, carrying 10 st.,
in 1.29 J, the places being filled by

the latter being the winner of the
T.J.C. Handicap and Milchester

1919 and several other events of
lesser importance. “Negro” is at
present at the “Glenelg” stud, and
great things are anticipated for the
progeny of the sire whose pedigree is
second to none in the State. Mr.
Duncombe is a member of the
Hughenden, the North-western
Amateur, the Winton, and the North
Gregory Jockey Clubs. He married
in the year 1898 Edith, daughter of
the late Alfred Smith, who was well

ARCHIBALD WALLACE
NORTH BELL, "Belmont,” Win-
ton, is the eldest son of the late
Archibald North Bell, a member of
a well-known Australian family, the
HON. A. BELL.
founder of which under the Southern
Cross was Lieutenant Archibald Bell,
who left England as an ensign to
join the 102nd Regiment, New
South Wales, under Major Johnston,
in the year 1806. From that time
onwards the Bells have been closely
concerned in the history-making of
the country, as will be seen by refer-
ence to page 192, vol. i., of this work.
A son of the original Archibald Bell
and the grandfather of the subject
of this memoir rendered considerable
service to the settlers of New South
Wales by exploring and clearing a
track across the Blue Mountains in
1823. This gentleman subsequently
settled in the Hunter River district,
which he was the third white man to
penetrate. The late Archibald North
Bell was his eldest son, and also
engaged in pastoral pursuits on the
Hunter River, having pioneered the
industry in Queensland over half a
century ago. At his death, which
occurred at Walloo, New South
Wales, he was survived by a widow
(Louisa Augusta Bell, nee Hyland, a
member of a very old English
family) and five young children,
of whom Mr. A. W. N. Bell,
of "Belmont,” Winton, was the
second eldest. Born at Walloo,
on the Hunter River, on Janu-
ary 9, 1872, the last-mentioned
gentleman was educated at the
Sydney Grammar School, and on
concluding his school days became a
jackaroo on "Noorindoo” Station,
near Surat, of which his uncle, Mr.
H. W. Bell, was then part owner. At
“Noorindoo” he spent about six years,
severing his connection with the
property on being offered by the
Queensland Investment and Land
Mortgage Co. the post of head stock-
man of “Cammaroo” Station, on the
Moonie River, the duties of which
position occupied him for two years.
MR. A. N. BELL.
At the end of that period, merging
his interests with those of his
brothers and other members of his
family, he selected the property
now known as “Belmont,” of
"BELMONT” HOMESTEAD.
which he has ever since been
managing owner. In addition he
carried out the responsible duties of
general manager of “Oondooroo,”
“Burleigh,” and “Disney” Stations
on behalf of Messrs. Ramsey
Bros., Ltd., but relinquished the
position owing to impaired health
and the necessity of devoting more
attention to his own affairs.
MR. A. W. N. BELL.
“Kinnoul,” on the Dawson River,
and “Bundarraga,” a property on
the Hunter River, New South Wales,
are also owned by the brothers,
Messrs. A. W. N., J. E. N., and H.
N. Bell, and respectively managed
by the two latter. The "Belmont”
property, which is situated some
fifty miles from Winton covers about
65,000 acres. It is devoted to sheep,
while cattle form the mainstay of
“Kinnoul.” Mr. Bell is a generous
supporter of all institutions of a
charitable or patriotic character.
A man with a wide circle of
friends, he is a member of the
Civic, Tattersalls, and the Pioneers’
Clubs of Charters Towers, Towns-
ville, and Sydney, respectively, and
of the Winton Club.

But the country about Caboolture is hardly as tropical
in appearance as is that reached a few miles nearer to
the Landsborough-Nambour district. The vegetation is
less dense and the land is not quite so fertile.
After leaving Caboolture the train brings the
traveller to his first near view of the remarkably-shaped
Glasshouse Mountains, named by Captain Cook, who,
when he saw them in the far distance from Moreton
Bay, was struck by their resemblance to glasshouses.
They rise abruptly from the surrounding forest, appear-
ing to be sheer precipices on every side, though in reality
NAMBOUR.
a tangled and impenetrable wall of leaves and wood,
creeping things festoon the branches, verdant ferns still
further vary the heterogeneous blaze of hue, and every
valley cradles its ever-flowing stream of crystal water.
Open spaces demonstrate the work of civilization, fields of
bananas, sugar cane, and planted grasses tell their tale
of latent wealth.
Nambour lies fifty-one miles north of the metro-
polis, and is on the main line to Rockhampton.
After leaving Brisbane, Caboolture is the last con-
siderable town passed. Caboolture is the centre
of a district devoted to mixed forms of primary
industry. Though, as elsewhere on the north coastline,
sugar-growing forms one of the mainstays of the place,
there are points from which they may be scaled. The
first to be passed is Beerburrum, which is forty miles
from Brisbane. The first settlement for returned
soldiers to start working in Australia lies near the foot
of this remarkable elevation, and has taken the same
name. The highest of these mountains is about 1,800
feet, but appears to be greatly larger than that on
account of the towering abruptness of its formation.
The origin of the mountains has puzzled many travellers,
but the theory usually accepted is that they once formed
the core inside the craters of volcanoes which have long
since eroded away with the action of time, leaving only
remaining the harder igneous rock which filled the old
vents.


LANDSBOROUGH.
Landsborough was named after the famous ex-
plorer. The population of the town is estimated at 180
and of the district at 1,000. This is the nearest point
at which the railway approaches the Blackall Range,
a northern continuation of D’Aguilar Range. There
is a coach road of seventeen miles from here to
Caloundra, a well-favoured watering place. From this
point the scenery is filled with interest and beauty. The
country is hilly, but not too broken to prevent large
blocks being cultivated for sugar, bananas, and other
tropical and siub-tropical crops. No one who sees the
country can doubt the great productivity of the deep
volcanic soil. Were its richness not made apparent by
the wealth of native forests and scrub, the farmed
patches which every here and there open out through
the trees would suffice to indicate that an immensely
wealthy region has been entered upon. Palmwoods
Station is passed at a point sixty miles from the metro-
polis. From this point an excellent road reaches up the
Blackall Range, the latter being noted for richness of
soil and an unusually heavy rainfall. Woombye is but
two miles further on, the proximity of these stations
showing how heavy is the freight offering to the rail-
ways. Quantities of pineapples are cultivated about
the last-named place. Buderim Mountain, some ten
miles from here, is noted for the excellence and the large
quantities of bananas sent, from there, whilst coffee has
been produced with successful results.
Nambour is on Petrie Creek, a branch of the
Maroochy. This thriving town, with a population of
1,000, is the centre of an important sugar-producing
district of some 5,000 inhabitants. The Moreton
Central Sugar Mill, with a capacity for crushing
40,000 tons per annum, has been established
here, and some twelve miles of tramways radiate
through the surrounding country for the purpose
of bringing cane in for crushing. These lines
run through the canefields of Petrie Creek and
the Maroochy River districts and up the range to
Dulong. They have been constructed on a gauge of
only two feet, but experience has demonstrated narrow
width to best combine economy with efficiency of work-
ing. The sugar industry within the immediate neigh-
bourhood of Nambour made rapid strides during the
first half of the second decade of the century, and the
town has progressed along parallel lines. The mill at
the time of writing crushes up to 30,000 tons of cane
per annum, but this quantity is likely to rapidly
increase. The rainfall of the district averages about
sixty-five inches per annum, which, coupled with the
phenomenal fertility of the soil, manifests itself in the
vigorous growth of artificially-grown vegetation just
as it does in the wealth of the native forests. Besides
sugar cane, the land immediately surrounding Nambour
aaa2
prolificly grows excellent citrus fruits, bananas, pine-
apples, heavy crops of maize, and many varieties of
vegetables. The alluvial flats and the hillsides with
their fertile volcanic soil give a variety of productivity
in which the value of each is increased by the proximity
of the other. An outstanding feature of the district is
that the farms are small, a fair average being about
ten acres of cane, which are worked in combination with
a little dairying and fruitgrowing, the whole forming a
prolific source of livelihood to the farmer who works
his own holding. Under these circumstances the land-
holder to a considerable extent is independent of outside
help and of the vagaries of the labour market. Of
recent years a regular influx of experienced agricul-
turists from the Northern rivers of New South Wales
has exercised an excellent influence in improving
farming methods throughout the whole region.
The beautiful Noosa Lakes lie between the north
coast railway and the coast itself. They are to the
north of Nambour and to the south of Gympie, Noosa
itself being reached by road from the railway station
at Cooroy or at Cooran. Accommodation is to be found
at a point three miles from the mouth of the Noosa
River. The lakes are formed by the stream spreading
out over expanses of flat country; and they are
known as Weyba, Coroibah, and Cootharaba, the
last-mentioned being seven miles by five. On all
sides the shores are clothed with gorgeous foliage,
whilst rugged ranges add to the picturesque effects of
a scene of more than ordinary beauty, the clear reflec-
tions on water of a remarkable purple hue being of most
unique character. Lake Weyba is nearest to the
entrance of the stream to the sea. Higher up is Lake
Doonella, but it is little more than a widening of the
river. Lake Coroibah is about one and three-
quarter miles long and one and a half miles in
width. The chief apparent importance of these sheets
of water is the excellent facilities they provide as
holiday resorts.
GYMPIE.
Gympie has played a unique part in shaping tne
destinies of Queensland. In the middle sixties the
young colony was suffering severe financial and indus-
trial depression. The failure of the old Bank of
Queensland and Masterman’s Bank in London had led
to a scarcity of capital and contraction of enterprise, so
that unemployment grew rife among the immigrants
who were flocking into the country. Politicians were at
their wits’ end to make both ends meet in the public
finances, and the outlook for the commercial community
was clouded with ominous forebodings. In those days
all Australian Governments had acquired the habit of
looking to gold to pull them out of whatever monetary
trouble might overtake the country. The discovery of
Ballarat and contemporary goldfields, beginning from


fifteen years before the time to which we refer,
had done more for the development of Victoria
than could have been accomplished by a century
of normal progress. Each Australian Parliament
knew that finding gold within the territory of its
jurisdiction would bring population by tens of thou-
sands, and that capital would quickly grow from
the accumulation of the production of the precious
metal. And each Australian Parliament likewise knew
that the absence of some such fortunate occurrence
would leave the very success of the luckier parts of the
continent to drain population, and consequently poten-
tial riches, from the less auriferous regions. Such
circumstances as these were instrumental in inducing the
Queensland Government to offer a reward for the dis-
covery of any considerable quantity of gold. The colony
already had yielded several deposits, and rushes had
with a tin dish, a pick, one or two other implements,
some rations, and a dog—to penetrate the little known
wilds to the north of the embryo settlement. Some
weeks afterwards, within a hundred yards of the site
of the present Gympie town hall, and where a monument
stands erected to his memory, this lonely pioneer hit on
what he had set out to obtain. At first the result of his
labour was insignificant, but small as were the yields
the possessor found the shortage of coin of the realm
in the nearest settlements severely handicapped him in
disposing of even enough of the long-sought-for metal
to enable him to purchase the necessaries of life. After
some months had been occupied in working the claim,
fear of being discovered by others, who might encroach
on rights he had not yet legally protected, induced
Nash to claim the Government’s reward and peg out
his mine. Then the neighbouring country, so far as it
GYMPIE.
brought population flocking to places hitherto hardly
heard of. But compared with what was happening in
the south, these had been but minor attractions.
Within the short space of six months the rush at
Canoona had produced 50,000 ounces. At Clermont
good results were obtained four years later; whilst
Cape River, Crocodile Creek, Ridgelands, Raglan, and
other Queensland centres had at one time or another
attracted eager streams of wealth-hunting prospectors.
But in the middle sixties something really big was sorely
needed. Gold appeared to offer the only escape from
public insolvency.
How much the promised Government reward had
to do with generating the gold fever in the heart of
James Nash is not to be determined at this stage of
Queensland’s history; but certain it is that in 1867
he set out from Nanango—alone, and equipped only
was populated by white people, became almost denuded
of male inhabitants. Men flocked in from the south
in a daily-increasing stream, and when the news reached
Brisbane a general exodus was checked only by the
Press throwing cold water on the description of the
prospects of the new find.
But the field rapidly developed. The gullies were
soon converted into hives of activity. The timber was
felled, and a crowded canvas town made its appearance
on what, less than a year before, had consisted of
virgin forest. The discovery was turning out to be the
biggest mining event of the time. Here—as at Ballarat,
Ararat, Bendigo, and other important finds—the first
operations were confined to securing the alluvial gold.
But here, as at those other places, rich reefs remained
for later development, so that when the independent
prospector, working for his own profit and concerned


only with shallow sinking, was beginning to exhaust
what to him were the possibilities of the place, the
gross yield was being added to by the application of
large amounts of capital, which employed armies of
men on wages. By the beginning of 1915 the Gympie
field had yielded 3,856,828 oz. of gold, valued at
£13,500,000.
To-day Gympie is an obviously prosperous town of
just on 9,000 urban inhabitants. The gold production
has decreased and the mining industry is still on the
down grade, but the development of dairying, pastoral
pursuits, and general farming is much more than com-
pensating for the shrinkage in the older enterprise.
Gympie is built among timbered hills, and the surround-
ing country presents a delightful mixture of forest and
open glades. The soil is not so rich as in the volcanic
land lying between there and Caboolture, where farmers
are able to milk from two to four cows from a single
acre of paspalum and the annual rainfall runs up to
75 inches; but the growth of herbage is abundant and
a wonderful variety of fodder plants is naturally suited
to the conditions. A local butter factory flourishes,
and the possible extension of this industry is such that
the cream production may be multiplied many times.
Banana plantations, cattle-grazing areas, fields of sugar
cane, sawmills with their incoming trainloads of mam-
moth logs, cultivated maize, and the rare riot of native
vegetation all demonstrate potentialities awaiting ex-
ploitation only to cause them to swell Gympie to dimen-
sions of many times its persent size.
The citv of Gympie was proclaimed a local authority,
with a territory of six square miles, on June 25, 1880.
The population of the town, residing within the juris-
diction of the City Council, was officially calculated on
December 31, 1916, to be 9,259, whilst a considerable
further population is contained in the outskirts of the
municipal boundaries.
NANANGO-KINGAROY DISTRICT.
The prosperous and well-populated district of which
Nanango and Kingaroy are the principal towns, lies
on the Burnett, at the terminus of a railway branching
off the main northern line at Theebine, 39 miles south
of Maryborough, and running in a south-easterly direc-
tion to near the Bunya and Cooyar Mountains. At Kin-
bombi the route crosses the Coast Range, the distance
from Theebine to Kingaroy being 83 miles. From the
latter centre one line continues for 16 miles to Nanango,
whilst another ends at Tarong, 18 miles from the
junction.
Nanango was one of the first settlements to be
formed in Queensland, the surrounding country origin-
ally being held in huge runs for cattle-raising, the
names “Tarong,” “Taabinga,” “Cooyar,” and others,
to-day attaching to stopping places for regular train
services first having been given to primitive station-
holdings lying several days of difficult journey from
conveniences of civilization now within reach by a few
hours of comfortable travel. Though Nanango is
separated from Brisbane by 225 miles of railway, the
actual distance between the two places is less than half
what is covered by the rail route, and the construction
of the short linking-up line from Yarraman Creek,
already approved by the Public Works Standing Com-
mittee, would take more than 80 miles off the distance
by train. The proposed route crosses the Cooyar Range,
and would open up fertile land excellently suited for
dairying and mixed farming, applied under methods of
intense culture. So prolific are these resources that
the construction of the extension probably would be
justified, even regardless of the great economy in haul-
age to be effected in regard to the heavy bulk of pro-
duction annually exported from the well-farmed region
stretching from Nanango to beyond Kingaroy and
westward along the railway from the latter to Tarong.
The Shire of Nanango, which was proclaimed a
local authority on November 11, 1879, contains an area
of 700 square miles, and holds a population approxi-
mately of 3,700. Some 1,000 people live in the town,
and the whole district is estimated to form the
home of 6,433. Though for many years the local
business centre to a solidly prosperous community,
Nanango appeared hardly to have made the growth fore-
shadowed by its earlier progress until the completion of
the railway extension from Kingaroy late in 1911
marked the beginning of a new era of development,
which has continued to the time of writing. The town
is well built, and adequately serves the varied require-
ments of the people of the district. The surrounding
country originally was heavily timbered, but many
thousands of acres have been completely cleared, and on
these areas, as well as w T here the trees have been only
thinned and the undergrowth destroyed, Rhodes grass
and paspalum thrive luxuriantly and give a stock-
carrying capacity which sounds almost incredible to
landholders whose experience in grazing pursuits does
not take them beyond the use of natural pasturage. The
importance to which the local dairying industry has
attained may be gauged from the fact that the output of
butter is almost equal in volume to that of any other dis-
trict in the Wide Bay division. Mixed farming occupies
considerable local attention, wheat being successfully
produced; but maize probably has pride of place as
the most popular crop. Considerable areas are culti-
vated for fodder crops. The soil is so rich that prac-
tically any class of agriculture may be followed with
success, excepting, of course, cultivation of the class of
plants which thrive best in poor ground. The most
common area of holding is about 640 acres, and though
in Queensland this is regarded as being about the


minimum from which a farmer can derive a comfortable
living. In southern States as much as £7O and
£BO per acre is paid for land no more fertile
than is much of that surrounding Nanango and Kin-
O O
garoy, whilst the rainfall of the former region is neither
heavier nor more regular.
Though younger than is Nanango, Kingaroy for
a number of years prior to 1911 progressed more rapidly
than did the present terminus of the railway. From the
latter end of 1904 till the construction of the exten-
sion of the line, the latter town served as the commercial
centre of the whole of the surrounding district, remain-
ing the railway head until 1911. Not until December 15,
1915, was the route to Tarong opened for traffic.
Friendly rivalry between Nanango and Kingaroy serves
to stimulate the progressive public spirit of both places.
Until the invigorating influences of improved means of
The village of Taabinga and the little settlement of
Booie are typical examples of the embryo townships
which the fertility of the country is destined to some
day lift to the status of important places of business.
The latter of these two lies on a plateau, the altitude of
which may be gauged from the fact of its commanding
a view of a vast sweep of the Kingaroy district, despite
the fact that the latter lies 1,471 feet above sea level.
The view from this eminence comprises a magnificent
panorama of undulating agricultural land, hill and
dale alternating with far-stretching flats, and thousands
of acres of cleared farms surrounded with the dark greeu
of dense forests.
CHILDERS.
Twenty-four miles northward from Maryborough, on
the railway to Bundaberg, is a station called the Isis
Junction, from which a branch line goes westward for 50
NANANGO.
transport began to reflect themselves on the commercial
and industrial life of the older settlement, the younger
town was rapidly forging ahead, and at the time of
writing the public and business buildings of the latter
are probably the more substantial. In other respects
honours are about easy, as is illustrated in the sphere
of industry. The population of the neighbourhood of
Kingaroy amounts approximately to 2,100 persons. For
many years the timber industry of this region has
ranked as of high importance to the whole State,
and no other local product contributes so largely
to the annual revenue from freight, whilst the
sums distributed throughout the neighbourhood in the
form of wages add greatly to the prosperity of the
various hamlets which dot the map, as well as to the
more populous centres.
miles to Dallarnil. At a distance of 12 miles from the
junction is a township called Childers, in the centre of a
highly prosperous and very important sugar district.
On the way there the train passes over a tract of "very
poor country and then suddenly enters an extensive
tract of rich, red basaltic soil, identical in quality with
that of the Woongarra scrub, but differing from that in
being entirely free from stones. Originally that Childers
country was known as the “Isis Scrub,” being covered
by a dense jungle, which was left undisturbed in the
care of the birds and marsupials until there came the
knowledge that the red volcanic scrub soil was among
the richest in the State for sugar growing or general
agriculture. The first selectors started clearing and burn-
ing off in 1871, and the following year the first cane was
planted. There is a somewhat singular coincidence in


the fact that Isis Scrub and the site of Childers are
exactly the same height as the summit of the “Hum-
mock” in the Woongarra Scrub. Each is just 350 ft.
above sea level. In the 12 miles from the Isis Junction
to Childers the train rises from 71 ft. to 351 ft. above
sea level. Where the scrub turkey built her nest and
the aborigines danced and sang their corrobories there
stands a picturesque town of 3,500 people. Far-
stretching fields of sugar cane extend over the long,
graceful undulations of the cultivated red land which
was once covered by the Isis Scrub, and cane fields
continue for seven miles to Cordalba, on the line to
Dallarnil, which is 38 miles beyond Childers.
The town of Childers only dates back to 1892. It was
laid out with wide streets, and the main street has a
graceful curve and is beautified by avenues of trees on
both sides. The very fertile soil encourages the rapid
growth of all vegetation. Like the Woongarra Scrub,
the Isis Scrub held no permanent water and the sugar
mills have to rely on dams; that of the C.S.R. Company
holding 30,000,000 gallons. This company has a large
mill capable of crushing an immense quantity of cane,
and there are three other large mills, two representing
the Millaquin and Yengarie refineries. The other is
the North Isis Central Mill, a co-operative concern
erected under the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, so that
the Isis Scrub has grown to be one of the most important
sugar centres in Queensland, and all that marvellous
progress has evolved since the opening of the line from
the Isis Junction to Childers on October 3, 1887.
On June 1, 1896, the line was opened to Cordalba,
a distance of seven and a half miles, and from Cordalba
to Dallarnil, the present terminus, on May 6,
1913, a distance of 31 miles, and 50 miles from the Isis
Junction. In Childers there are three banks, six hotels,
several good stores, a bi-weekly newspaper, motor garages,
four churches, a Chamber of Commerce, four clubs, four
lodges, two brass bands, and two theatres. All the district
is governed by the Isis Shire Council, which includes
about 32,000 acres of good soil, of which the best 20,000
acres are under cane. The population of the Shire
represents nearly 6,000 people. Such has been the
amazing result from that small area of basaltic soil
known a few years ago as the Isis Scrub. It may be
said that the Woongarra Scrub basaltic area is the chief
support of Bundaberg. The two largest basaltic areas
in Queensland, if not in Australia, are represented by
the Darling Downs and the Atherton Tableland, each
containing about 2,000,000 acres. Picture an Isis Scrub
extending from Maryborough to Gladstone with a width
of 30 miles ! Think of all the population and production
and prosperity to be credited to the basaltic areas of the
Blackall Range, the Boonah district, the Rosewood
Scrub, and Meringandan, and then feel less surprised
at the result the Isis Scrub has shown in the short period
of twenty-five years.
GAYNDAH.
Gayndah is one of the oldest towns in Queensland,
dating back to the years before Separation. The name
is a rather brief spelling of the aboriginal word “gi-un-
da” (with accent on the “un”). “Giunda” and
“paluma” were the Burnett River blacks’ names for
thunder and lightning.
Gayndah is 90 miles from Maryborough by rail,
which continues on beyond Mundubbera. The town is
356 ft. above sea level and stands on high, dry, solid
country on the banks of the Burnett River, which enters
the sea at Bundaberg. Lower down the river was a
station taken up in 1847 by Forster and Blaxland, and
named “Gin-Gin,” after that of the local aboriginal
tribe, the “Jinjinburra.”
In the river, or a lagoon near the river, Forster’s
men caught some strange fish, and one was sent to
Gerard Krefft, curator of the Sydney Museum, who
discovered it to be of the species of the gamoid fishes
supposed to have been extinct in the Mesozoic Period.
Krefft named it Ceratodus Forsteri, the now famous
lung fish found only in the Mary and Burnett Rivers
of Eastern Queensland.
Forster’s partner, Blaxland, and several shepherds
were killed by the blacks on “Gin Gin.” The first
station on Burnett waters was taken on the head of the
river by Stuart Russell in 1843 and named “Burran-
dowan.” It passed from him to Friel and Gordon
Sandeman, and then to Towns & Co.
Other squatters followed until a large area of
Burnett country was taken by men under the impression
that the river was the Boyne of Oxley in 1823, and they
remained in that belief until Surveyor Burnett in 1847
found that Oxley’s Boyne was 110 miles north of the
Burnett. Even to-day on the maps one of the heads of
the Burnett is erroneously named the Boyne. Twenty
miles from where Gayndah stands the Messrs. Strathda
took up “Cooranga” in 1848. “Barambah” was taken
up by Richard Jones and “Booubyjan” by Lawless in the
same year. “Rocky Bar” and “Redbank” were taken
up by John Ross in 1848 as sheep and-cattle country, and
sold to E. H. Lloyd. Robert Fleming took up “Dyke-
head” in 1848, which passed to Alfred Thomas in 1852
and John Croker in 1860. The famous “Hawkwood”
Station, 37 miles from Gayndah, was taken up by John
Kinchela. Thence it went to the Archer Bros., and from
them to Cameron, Mackenzie, and Murron. “Yendah”
Station was taken up in 1848 by R. Wilkin and Elliott
Brothers, and the very well-known “Mount Debateable”
Station, 4 miles out of Gayndah, by George Macotta, the
first squatter who ever brought sheep from the Darling


Downs to a station below the Range at Helidon. “Ban
Ban Station was taken up by the Messrs. Herbert in
1846 and Ideraway” in 1848 by J. B. Reid, who sold to
J. J. Caldwell. The well-known “Wetheron,” 12 miles
from Gayndah, was taken up by William Humphrey in
1845, and from him it passed to the Hons. B. B. and S.
Moreton, sons of the Earl of Ducie. “Eidsvold”
Station was taken up by the Archer Brothers in 1843
and from them it passed to the Ivory Brothers.
When the foundations of Gayndah were being laid
there were only a few squatters on the Burnett, and
these were nearly all educated men of good families with
command of money and the confidence of the Banks and
financial institutions.
It must have made considerable progress when Tom
White went there in 1857 and started The Burnett
number of settlers now occupy those red soil
plateau, and the State Government has sunk bores to
provide a water supply, as, like all the other red-soil
volcanic tracts of Queensland, they carry no surface
water.
The farms usually contain 160 acres. Very pleasant
is the train journey from Gayndah to Mundubbera,
which is the way to Eidsvold, the line running along
the Burnett River, a considerable stream bordered by
very fine ti-trees, and winding among picturesque hills
and ridges sloping to the river and timbered chiefly by
a forest of stately gums. The township of Mun-
dubbera, has sprung up but little less rapidly than
Jonah’s gourd, and already has a butter factory and
good hotel, and is rapidly acquiring all the advantages
and conveniences of a town.
GAYNDAH.
Argus. The Gazette now represents the Press in
Gayndah, which is a very prosperous town of nearly a
thousand people, the centre of a thriving district of
farmers and fruit-growers and squatters, with a popu-
lation of over 4,000 people.
The railway was opened to Gayndah on December
16, 1907, and to Mundubbera on February 3, 1914. The
town has twoßanks, a Co-operative Dairy Co., four hotels,
good stores, a theatre, four lodges, a band, and seven
clubs. The town is governed by a Mayor and Council,
and the Rawbelle Shire Council meets there every month.
There is an athletic club and a very successful Pastoral,
Agricultural, Industrial, and Horticultural Association.
Gayndah commands an extensive area of rich
agricultural country, conspicuous in which are the
two volcanic plateau of Binjour and Gurgeena,
originally covered by dense scrub. A considerable
EIDSVOLD.
liom Mundubbera a good coach road runs to
Eidsvold, a small mining town 47 miles by the old coach
road from Gayndah, and 55 miles south-westward from
Mount Perry. Gold was found in Eidsvold in 1857 at
what was afterwards called “Swindle Hill” by a shep-
herd named “Loddon Bill,” who had come from the
Loddon River in Victoria; but the first serious
mining was undertaken here by John Falconer,
who sent a ton and a half of stone to Sydney,
where it gave 8 oz. to the ton. For some unexlpained
reason the mine was abandoned until 1887, when a
miner named Fred. Achilles registered a protection area
at the Warden s office in Gayndah, exhibiting some rich
specimens and about 3 oz. of gold. Then Carter, of
Gympie, pegged off the Golden Spur, and on July 25,
1887, Eidsvold was proclaimed a gold field. Miners


came in from all directions, followed by business people,
a good road from Gayndah and Mount Perry was formed,
and the town fairly started. Its geological formation
closely resembles that of Charters Towers, with granite,
quartz, and quartzites, feldspar, and intrusive dykes
of diorite. Eidsvold became a highly prosperous field
as instanced by the Minerva Mine, which, in
1898, paid £16,500. Among the other mines were
the Alma, Maid of Erin, Lady Augusta, Craven,
Empress, Pallas Minerva, Mount Rose, and Stockman
Junction. That year (1898) was one of the best, the
returns showing 13,430 oz. The first 3,149 tons of stone
crushed at the Mount Shamrock prospecting claim gave
3,346 oz. of retorted gold. Gold was found in numerous
reefs, and in most of them in payable quantities, and
four tons of bismuth were sent to Maryborough in the
first year to be shipped to England.
The history of Eidsvold is an amazing story.
Warden Edmund F. Craven proclaimed the gold
field, and next year he reported as follows:
“Eidsvold, or Mount Rose township, has eight
public-houses, eight stores, two bakers, two butchers,
Roman Catholic church, Salvation Army barracks,
one dancing saloon, two steam sawmills, and a
population of about 1,200. Two coaches come weekly
from Gayndah, four from Mount Perry, one from Dalby,
and one from Chinchilla. Craventown, three miles from
Mount Rose, has three hotels, three stores, two butchers,
and two cordial makers, and a population of about 400.
Edistown, at Mount Jones, has also four hotels, stores,
and butchers’ shops, with about 400 population."
There were then 2,500 people in and around
Eidsvold, and yet miners were so scarce that a number
of mines had to get exemption, as labour was not obtain-
able. Prospectors scattered over all the district, and
claims were taken up in all directions. The sudden rise
and expansion of Eidsvold were remarkable in even the
history of mining towns, and a great future was con-
fidently anticipated by all classes. At the present time
Eidsvold has a population of only 400, or about
1,000 in the whole district, and its glory as a mining
field has departed, at least for the time being.
MARYBOROUGH.
Maryborough is a town with an interesting history.
It is situated on the Mary River, the mouth of which
is in the south end of Hervey Bay and the north end of
Sandy Straits, a point about 150 miles northward by sea
from Brisbane. Steamers going to Maryborough have
to cross what is known as Wide Bay bar and thence
traverse a narrow strait known as Sandy Strait, with
the mainland on the left and Fraser Island on the right.
Originally Fraser Island was known at Great Sandy
Island. Sandy Strait runs through the Inskip Point,
on the southern end of Fraser Island, to the southern
end of Hervey Bay near a spot called the White Cliffs on
Fraser Island, which extends from Inskip Point northwaid
75 miles to Sandy Cape, beyond which the notorious
Breaksea Spit runs out for 19 miles to the northward. The
island is named from Captain Fraser of a vessel called the
“Stirling Castle," which brought out a load of Scottish
mechanics (selected by Dr. Lang) to Sydney in 1836.
After returning in 1838 she started for England and was
wrecked on Elizabeth Reef, 300 miles east of the
Queensland coast. The captain, with his wife, the first
mate, the boatswain, and some of the crew landed finally
on Fraser Island, where the blacks treated them well and
passed them on across to Inskip Point to the mainland
blacks to be conducted down along the coast to the then
penal settlement at Moreton Bay. Not one of the party
reached Moreton Bay, except Mrs. Fraser, who was
guided within sight of the settlement by a white man
named Bracefell, an escaped convict who had been living
three years among the blacks, and whose heart so failed
him at the sight of the old convict station that he
returned to the blacks and lived with them for seven
more years.
At that time there must have been 2,000 wild blacks
on Fraser Island. When the first steamers ran to
Maryborough, the Strait was badly charted and the
captains were glad to take some Fraser Island blacks
on board to act as pilots. They swam off to the vessels
and climbed on board on ropes flung over the side. One
or two would ascend the masts and indicate to the
steersman with a wave of the hand the course of the deep
water. On the return journey they jumped overboard
and swam ashore. When the Gympie diggings started
in 1867 all the wharf labourers left Maryborough, and
twenty or thirty Fraser Island blacks were taken on
board by every vessel to do the loading and unloading.
They were powerful, active men, and did their work well.
There is no doubt that the first white men to
cross the Wide Bay bar and navigate Sandy Strait were
Andrew Petrie, Stewart Russell, and their party in a
whaleboat in 1842. It is equally certain that they were
the first white men to navigate the River Mary and view
the site of the present Maryborough. For years the Mary
was called the Wide Bay River, and the whole district
was known as Wide Bay.
The blacks had various names for the river—the
Morrobocoola, the Monooboola, Goodna, and Yaboou.
It was finally named the Mary, from Lady Mary
Fitzroy, wife of the Governor of New South Whales,
and Maryborough was named from the river.
When Petrie and Russell and Jolliffe went there in
1842 they were in search of a white man, Jem Davis,
an escaped convict who had been fourteen years with the
blacks, and were piloted by Bracefell, the escaped con-
vict, then ten years with the blacks, and whom they had
picked up not far from the Noosa River when coming


along the coast. Those two wild white men were
brought to Brisbane where Davis (“Durramboi”) first
worked as a blacksmith and then kept a crockery shop in
George Street. Bracefell (“Wandi”) was killed while
felling trees for a settler at Goodna. “Durramboi”
was evidently the first white man who ever saw the
Maryborough country, though he lived chiefly in the
vicinity of Mount Bauple.
Settlement began on what is known to-day as West
Maryborough in 1848 when E. T. Aldridge, the first
settler, took a place there which he called “Baddow,”
and where in 1848 he erected a public-house and called
it the “Bush Inn.” He removed this afterwards to
the new town and rebuilt it in an improved form on the
site of the present Royal Hotel, finally retiring from
business in 1860.
Before Aldridge practically started Maryborough,
a large area of the Mary and Burnett country was
McTaggart, Powell, Graham, Palmer, Bidwell, and the
Moreton Brothers. George Furber and his son-in-law,
James Williamson, were among those killed by the
blacks.
Maryborough continued to progress slowly until
the arrival of immigrant vessels in 1860, and the pace
increased to 1867, when the discovery of Gympie sent
Maryborough ahead in a remarkable fashion, as all the
trade of Gympie and the traffic by foot, vehicle, and
horse to and fro passed through the town, and all goods
from the south, and all travellers either way, came or
went by steamers up or down the Mary and through
Sandy Strait to or from Brisbane. By this time the
“old town” was deserted, and all settlement was on the
present site on the bank of the Mary, the river named
by Surveyor Burnett in 1847. The old town site was
a favourite spot for the blacks to have their fights,
corrobories, and bora rings.
MARYBOROUGH.
occupied by squatters. There was Hawkins at “Boo-
nara,” Lawless at “Booubyjan,” Jones at “Baramba,”
Corfield at “Gigoomgan,” Perrier at “Degilbo,” Her-
bert at “Ban-Ban,” and Dr. Ramsay at “Cockatoo.”
In May, 1842, Joliffe had taken up “Girkum” and
stocked it with sheep belonging to John Bales, of Syd-
ney. Those were rough, wild days, and the blacks were
very numerous and consistently hostile. Shepherds
were murdered in all directions, and several of the
squatters were also among the victims. When Aldridge
came overland he was accompanied by Enoch Rudder,
John Meyers, Wm. Fitzgerald, and an aboriginal frdm
Gigoomgan, where he was joined by Henry and R. E.
Palmer. In 1849 there were about 350 people at Mary-
borough, Aldridge having the first hotel, and he and
Uhr and Dowzer were the first storekeepers.
Among the squatters of that day were Uhr,
The Mary River is navigable, for vessels drawing
10 ft., up to Yengarie, nine miles above the town, and
for 7-ft. vessels for 20 miles above Yengarie. From
Maryborough wharves to the mouth of the river at the
entrance to Sandy Strait is 26 miles, and thence to the
Wide Bay bar 28 miles. From there to the mouth of
the Brisbane River is about 112 miles, or a total of 166
miles by water, nearly exactly the distance (167 miles)
by rail from Brisbane. In 1843 the schooner “Edward”
went up to Tinana Creek with supplies for Bales’ sheep
stations, the first in the district. At the mouth of that
creek in 1851 there lived a man named George Bidwell,
a surveyor, who grew the first mangoes ever grown in
Queensland, and some of the grand old trees still
remain. He was the man who sent cones of the bunya
pine to Covent Garden, where Hooker, the famous
botanist, named the bunya tree Araucaria Bidtailli,


though Andrew Petrie reported discovering it on the
Blackall Range back in 1843. In Covent Garden
market the first bunya cones sold for ten guineas each.
A cutter called the “Aurora” came to Maryborough
in 1849 with a boiling-down plant to boil down catarrh
sheep from “Baramba” Station, on which the Govern-
ment aboriginal station stands to-day. The first steamer,
the “William Miskin,” came up in 1854.
The Burnett Times, afterwards The Wide Bay and
Burnett News, started on March 6, 1860, and The
Chronicle on November 21, 1860.
Then came the days of cotton and sugar. The
Maryborough Sugar Company started on 1,000 acres on
Tinana Creek in 1865 and made sugar and rum in large
quantities.
Excellent cotton was grown in 1860, the Mary-
borough and Wide Bay Cotton Growing Association
being formed in 1859 with a capital of £3,000 in £5
shares, afterwards increased to £5,000.
In 1860 the town was visited by Governor Bowen,
who found the company conducting vigorous operations.
Sugar and rum-making became popular, and plantations
were started in all directions, among them being Yen-
garie, Nerada, Antigua, Etonvale, Kircubbin, Irra-
warra, Jerrah, lindah, and Magnolia.
In 1872 coal seams were found in the Burrum River
about 12 miles out of Maryborough, and coal mines were
started.
Vast quantities of pine, red cedar, and hardwood
were drawn to town or rafted down the river and shipped
away to southern markets. The first eight bales of
cotton were shipped on May 8, 1862.
In 1859 the town became a port of entry, and the
Customs house was built in 1861. The famous plantation
of Yengarie was started by T. C. White as a boiling-
down establishment, but was taken over by Tooth and
Cran, who added the making of a meat extract of fine
quality. Finally they made it a great sugar mill and
refinery.
The plans of the railway from Gympie to Maryborough
were approved on August 7, 1877, and the line was
opened on August 6, 1881, a distance of 61 miles. To-
day Maryborough is a town of 15,000 people,
within a three-mile radius, with the largest sawmills
and iron foundries in Queensland, one of them, Walkers
Limited, being equal to any in the Commonwealth. There
are handsome churches, a large number of fine shops,
and 30 hotels. The climate is healthy, the streets are
clean and well made, and a supply of excellent water
is received from Tinana Creek. About 22 miles away, on
the Mary River, is the town of Tairo with about 1,000
people in a prosperous district producing sugar, maize,
potatoes, butter, and much timber.
Maryborough lies 167 miles by rail from Brisbane
and 230 from Rockhampton on the North Coast line;
and railways run from here to Gayndah, Nanango,
and Pialba, the last-mentioned line terminating at
Urangan Point. Pialba and Urangan Point are the great
watering-places for the Maryborough people. At Uran-
gan Point there is a jetty 3,000 ft. in length where
ocean-going steamers can load and unload. In front of
Urangan are Big and Little Woody Islands, beyond
which is the long white sandy beach and the low coast-
line of Fraser Island, a beautiful and romantic scene.
Pialba has a nine-mile hard beach of white sand, which
forms a splendid riding, driving, or walking track.
It is quite a township with about 500 people and a
little town is springing up around Urangan.
Maryborough stands on level country of good soil
favourable to the cultivation of fruit or flowers
or general vegetation. It stands in a curve of the river
by which it is partly encircled, and a large area of the
town is liable to inundation in floods such as those of
1871, 1875, 1885, 1890, and 1893. There is a frontage
of 14 miles to the river and nine miles to Saltwater
Creek.
The Maryborough sawmills cut up more soft and
hard woods than the mills of any other timber centre
in Australia, and now a Sydney capitalist has a large
mill at White Cliffs, on Fraser Island, cutting the island
timbers on a leased area. The great iron foundry of
Walkers Limited, dating back to 1868, one of the most
extensive and successful in Australia, is capable of
making steamers, tugs, dredges, barges, iron bridges,
boilers, mining machinery, railway engines, and sugar
mills. Fairlie’s sash and door factory, dating from 1862,
is one of the largest in Australia. So that, all things
considered, Maryborough can be regarded as a perman-
ently prosperous town, the centre or depot of an exten-
sive area of highly productive country. The timber
supplies of red cedar, hoop and kauri pine, tallow wood,
spotted gum, and ironbark and silky oak cannot endure
for ever unless re-afforestation provides a guarantee.
Even now red cedar is drawing rapidly towards
the point of extinction, and hoop and kauri pine are
following fast.
Maryborough’s status as a ship-building centre was
fully established with the launching of the “Echuca”
on July 7, 1921. This fine steamer was made for the Aus-
tralian Government by Walkers Limited. Its length is
331 ft., its breadth 47 ft. 9 in., and its carrying capacity
6,000 tons dead weight, while when fully loaded it will
displace 9,000 tons. The “Echunga,” a vessel of similar
type, is shortly to be launched here.
BUNDABERG.
The town of Bundaberg is situated on the bank of
the Burnett River, discovered by Surveyor Burnett in
1846. The town is nine miles by water from the mouth
of the river.


Geologically the position is very remarkable.
From Maryborough to Bundaberg, 50 miles, the train
passes over dead-level and very poor country covered
with “wallum” trees, ti-tree, wattle, small blood-
woods, grey gums, and casuarinas. That is all coal-
bearing country overlying the “Coal Measures.’’
The surface soil of nearly all the coal-bearing
country of Australia is mostly clay and sand, growing
poor and stunted vegetation. That sort of country ex-
tends from near Maryborough to within a couple of miles
of Bundaberg. Just outside of the town, between it and
the sea, is a remarkable tract of very rich red soil known
as the Woongarra Scrub, which is pure basalt, or the
decomposed lava once thrown out by an ancient volcano
now represented by the Hummock, an eminence 260 ft.
above sea level, looking out on the sea from the centre
of the Woongarra Scrub. The word “Woongarra” was
the old blacks’ name for the brigalow tree, one of the
country in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg, bordering
on the big scrub which they named “Woongarra.”
The first settlers came in 1857 when A. Walker of
Gayndah, his brother Robert, and Barnard and Parker,
came down the river on an exploring expedition and
formed “Bingera” Station, on which there stands to-day
one of the largest and most successful sugar mills in
Queensland, 11 miles up the Burnett on the railway to
Mount Perry. In February, 1858, R. Walker, G.
Martin, Gustav Merz, and a Gayndah black boy camped
on the present site of Bundaberg.
A party of three men from a station on the Upper
Burnett made a big canoe and paddled down the river
until it reached the sea. Two brothers named John
and Gavin Stewart came from the boiling-down works on
Baffle Creek, 50 miles north of the Burnett, looking for
stove wood, and they were so pleased with the rich soil
that they selected 320 acres under the Coffee and Sugar
MARYBOROUGH.
acacias. This volcanic area was originally covered by dense
scrub. Outside the volcanic area was the poor, sandy,
clay soil seen along the railway from Maryborough to
Bundaberg. The line of division is clearly defined. At
the mouth of the Burnett, on the beach, are great
quarries of black volcanic rocks which were thrown out
by the old “Hummock” volcano far back in some remote
past of which we know next to nothing. The days when
that “Hummock” was an active volcano are beyond the
reach of human imagination. The Burnett River was
known to the old blacks as “Borall-Borall,” and “Birra-
barra” the name of the Lower Burnett. The district
was first explored by Forbes, of Upper Doongool, and
William Howard, two squatters in search of fresh graz-
ing country. They took up land in 1856, all the forest
Regulations Act of 1862. This was in the Woondooma
Scrub on the northern side of the river where settlement
first started, a selection belonging to the Messrs. Alex-
ander being cut up into town lots.
Another selector named Watson sold a site for a saw
mill to a Rockhampton man named Samuel Johnson,
whose machinery came up the river in the ketch “Eliza-
beth.’' Watson’s selection was next to that of the
Stewarts.
So that the Stewarts, Watson, the Alexanders, and
Johnson were the first settlers in the Bundaberg district.
They all went to Bundaberg in 1867, the year in
which Johnson’s saw mill came in the ketch “Eliza-
beth,” the first vessel to enter the river.
Seeing a settlement starting on the northern side


the Government decided to survey a township on the
Crown lands of that side, nearly all open forest dead-
level country, with a narrow strip of scrub along the
river. This intention was immediately put into effect
(1868), the surveyors being Messrs. Edwards and
Thompson. Bundaberg was named, at the suggestion
of the former, from the aboriginal word "Bunda,” and
our own affix of Saxon derivation, "berg.”
The timber industry rapidly expanded and two
other saw mills followed that of Johnson. Farmers
started to grow maize and potatoes and pumpkins. The
town evolved very slowly.
The first auction sale of town lots was held at Mary-
borough in 1871, and quarter-acre allotments brought
£4, and some were afterwards sold for as little as £2,
so the great future of the town was evidently not fore-
seen at that time. Some of those lots sold in after years
up to £4,000, and one corner allotment at £9,000. The
town was very sensibly laid out in regular squares, the
streets being a chain and a half wide, with a very fine
main street like a great avenue two chains in width,
called Bourbon Street, from a sugar cane which came
originally from the Island of Bourbon, and was very
popular with the early planters, until, being the first
to take the rust, it was ploughed out and exterminated.
A tremendous stimulus was given to Bundaberg
when copper was discovered at Mount Perry, which
to-day is 67 miles by rail from Bundaberg. The railway
was opened through to Mount Perry on May 20, 1884,
but before that was available all the traffic in goods
and ore was done by dray, and people either rode or
drove in buggies or went by Cobb’s coaches.
Bundaberg became the seaport for Mount Perry,
and steamers came up the river and berthed at the
wharves.
The Land Act of 1868 did much to encourage
settlement, and a lot of land was selected in the Burnett
Valley.
Until the opening of the last 20-mile section
of the railway to Bundaberg on February 20, 1888, all
goods and much of the passenger traffic went by steamers
which ran regularly via Maryborough to and from Bris-
bane, and there are still regular steamers which carry a
considerable traffic, as sea carriage is cheaper than rail.
The first steamer to enter the Burnett was the "Sir
John Young,” under Captain French. The ketch
"Elizabeth,” which brought J. S. Johnson’s saw mill in
1868, loaded red cedar for the Maryborough saw mills.
The first white women were Mrs. and Miss Watson, who
went to live on Mr. Watson’s selection on the north side.
Bundaberg was not declared a municipality until
April 22, 1881, and the rate of progress may be realized
by the fact that in 1889 the population had risen to
5,000. To-day the population of the whole town must
be over 10,000 and of the postal district over 17,000.
The original survey wisely left a very fine broad
esplanade fronting the river, forming an extensive
promenade.
Sugar became the main pillar of Bundaberg pros-
perity. Sugar mills were erected in succession until
there were 30 working. In 1882 the Messrs. Cran
erected the great Millaquin Refinery, from which pipes
radiated through the Woongarra Scrub and brought in
the juice from what were merely small crushing mills.
To-day there are fourteen plantations and ten mills,
including the Millaquin Refinery, an immense building
covering an acre and a quarter, where sugar is refined
on the most advanced scientific principles.
In going to the coast, a distance of nine miles,
over an excellent road through the Woongarra Scrub,
you pass through cane fields extending over nearly
20,000 acres. Between that scrub and the sea lie the
famous Barolin Plains. The cane fields extend to the
coast, and there is a magnificent view from the summit
of the Hummock, taking in the river and the coast, far
away northward and southward, the whole of Bundaberg,
all the Woongarra Scrub, and a great expanse of country
in the west. Apart from sugar making there are two
large distilleries, the Millaquin and Bundaberg, which
make great quantities of excellent rum. There are no
fewer than six Cane Growers’ Associations, two news-
papers —The Daily Mail and The Daily News —six
Banks, a co-operative dairy company, a Harbour
Board, two Bridge Boards, thirteen different societies,
and six Masonic lodges. There are about thirty clubs,
about as large an assortment as any town of thrice the
size in Australia.
GLADSTONE AND PORT CURTIS.
Gladstone stands on the western shores of Port
Curtis, one of the best harbours on the Queensland coast,
and lies 328 miles by rail north from Brisbane.
When Flinders came along our eastern coast in June
and July, 1802, he was accompanied by Captain John
Murray in the brig "Lady Nelson,” his own ship being
the "Investigator,” originally the "Zenophone,” and he
examined the coast carefully from Sandy Cape to Cape
Clinton discovering and naming on that voyage, Curtis
Channel, Facing Island, Gatcombe Head, Sea Hill,
Townshend, Leicester and Allen Islands, Mount Westall,
Cape Clinton, Mount Funnel, Upper Head, and the
Percy Islands. Curtis Channel, the present Port Curtis,
he named after Admiral George Curtis. He also
named Mount Larcom, that splendid mountain which is
such a picturesque landmark for the town of Gladstone.
Probably no white man after Flinders came before
Oxley in 1823, when, armed with a copy of Flinders’
chart, he went to examine Port Curtis and ascertain if
it were suitable for a new penal settlement to relieve the


overcrowding of Port Macquarie and Norfolk Island.
He anchored in Port Curtis, inside the Gatcombe Head,
on November 6, 1823. Oxley was in the “Mermaid”
(Captain Pearson) and was accompanied by Lieutenant
Stirling of the “Buffs,” John Uniacke, a Sydney abor-
igine named Bowen, and the ordinary crew. The
weather was hot, and the thermometer in the cabin up
to 95°. Next day they started with two boats and three
days’ provisions to examine the shores of the port, and
camped all night on a sandy beach. The following day,
according to Oxley, they marched 12 miles inland over
barren steep hills covered with loose broken quartz, coarse
grass, and stunted gums. Evidently they went westward
or south-westward, as next day Captain Pearson found
a river which Oxley and Stirling ascended to the head
of tidal water and returned to the “Mermaid.” They
then went six miles higher up the river, which
of Moreton Bay, and strongly recommended that locality
for a penal settlement.
In 1846 an attempt was made to found a new
colony at Gladstone, the declared objective being
the amelioration of the lot of those who had had
the misfortune to be transported and were anxious
to redeem their characters. Some of these (the
“exiles”) had been liberated on arrival in Australia,
others had served their sentences and were desirous of
making a fresh start in life. At that time transporta-
tion was practically confined to Van Diemen Land,
and that small island was unable to find employment
for the numbers who became free every year. The
scheme for the foundation of the Colony was due to
the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, William
Ewart Gladstone. It was proposed to excise the whole
of what is now Queensland, north of the 26th parallel of
BUNDABERG.
showed traces of tremendous floods and was covered with
teal, widgeon, and black duck. Stirling shot two swamp
pheasants. That was the river which Oxley named the
Boyne, familiar to-day to all the people of Gladstone and
all travellers to Rockhampton by the train which crosses
the Boyne about five miles out of Gladstone.
While Oxley was away up the Boyne the mate of
the “Mermaid” had been 12 miles down the coast and
reported finding a large bay which proved, however, to
be the Rodd Bay of Captain King.
Evidently Oxley was not favourably impressed by
the country he saw at the back of Gladstone, and was
clearly of the belief that if the country was no good for
settlement all the virtues of Port Curtis, as a harbour,
would go for nothing. So he sailed away southward,
and saw and approved of Redcliffe, on the eastern shore
latitude; that is, north of a line drawn east and west
about one hundred miles north of Brisbane; and create
it into the Colony of North Australia. The London
Gazette of May 8, 1846, contains the appointment of
“George Barney, Esq., Lieutenant-Colonel in the Corps
of Royal Engineers, to be Lieutenant-Governor of
North Australia, and to administer the goveimment of
that Colony under the style and title of superintendent.”
The provision for the government was on a very limited
scale. Only one other appointment was made in England,
and it was left to Lieut.-Colonel Barney to find a staff
of officials in Sydney. Barney had been some years
previously Surveyor-General of New South Wales, and
had made a survey of Brisbane in 1839. He was at
Chatham when he received the appointment to North
Australia, and lost no time in returning to Australia.


He brought with him the other official appointed in
England, a chairman of Quarter Sessions, Mr. William
Whaley Billyard, a solicitor. The selection of the
remaining members of his staff was as follows:—Crown
Prosecutor, J. S. Dowling; Colonial Secretary, E. C.
Merewether; Sheriff, W. A. Brown; Registrar of Court,
W. K. McNish; Clerk, G. H. Barney; Assistant Sur-
veyor, Thomas Robertson; Assistant Commissary-
General, Darling; and Surgeon, Mr. Robertson.
After visiting Bustard Bay, Rodd Bay, and Port
Curtis, Lieut.-Colonel Barney finally determined upon
the latter for the settlement, and chartered two vessels,
the “Lord Auckland” and the “Thomas Lowry,” to
convey the expedition to its destination.
The “Lord Auckland’s” departure was delayed,
and it was not until January 8, 1847, that she passed
Sydney Heads. Her departure is noted in The Sydney
Herald of January 9. In addition to the officials
mentioned, she had on board Mrs. Barney and her two
daughters, Mrs. Billyard and child, Mrs. McNish and
her family, Captain Day, of the 99th Regiment, Mrs.
Day and family (including their son, Henry Day), Mr.
F. E. Stewart, Mr. G. O. Allen, Miss Stokes, Mr. and
Mrs. Vellier, Messrs. W. Thew, W. Carney, A. Cook,
T. Shaddock, J. Rutter, C. Jones, W. Rowell, C.
Smith, J. Harrison, and twenty-two privates of the
99th Regiment, seven women, and twelve children.
The “Lord Auckland” was an old ship, but her skipper
was older, being then about eighty years of age. Her
chief officer, Mr. Usher, had at one time been mate of
the yacht “St. Kilda,” after which the Melbourne
suburb of that name is called.
The voyage was long, and it was not until the
eighteenth day that Port Curtis was reached. Here
the shoals proved dangerous and the vessel ran aground.
The experience of being pounded on the sand as the
ship rose and fell with the waves was most unpleasant.
It was impossible to stand on the decks. The topmast
shook like a wand, and the ship was rapidly making
water. Lieut.-Colonel Barney with his family and
some soldiers left the ship at once. He landed on
Facing Island, the nearest point of land, at which all
were subsequently disembarked. The vessel was taken
up the harbour and lay off what is now the town of
Gladstone. The people on shore had to suffer a great
deal of inconvenience, if not hardship. Facing Island
is not an ideal spot for camping in the rainy season.
The mosquitoes and sand flies were very bad. The food
was insufficient, and there was some anxiety with regard
to supplies, until the arrival of the “Thomas Lowry” in
March. The “Thomas Lowry” brought all the stores
requisite for founding the new colony, and fifty
men of the 99th Regiment, under Lieut. G. J. de
Winton. Her passengers included Colonel Grey and
his son and Mr. Loundes.
Everything was now ready for the work of founding
the settlement, but on April 15 the steamer “Kan-
garoo” arrived, with instructions to abandon the place.
There had been a change of Government in the
United Kingdom, and the new Colonial Secretary (Lord
Grey) annihilated the scheme.
The first building at Gladstone was a hut erected
by a band of young men from Maryborough, who,
having heard descriptions of Port Curtis, had deter-
mined to be the first on what appeared to be a favour-
able field of settlement. Their advent is clothed with
no small degree of romance, being a sequence to the fate
of “The Countess of Minto” and another vessel load-
ing guano at Lady Elliot Island, about sixty miles east-
ward of Port Curtis, when an exceptionally heavy gale
threatened both with destruction. One of these ships
was blown clean out to sea when she had only one man
on board. With great fortitude and after suffering
many hardships this lonely seaman managed to navigate
the ship to near Port Jackson, where he was sighted by
a passing vessel, taken in tow, and eventually landed
in safety, after passing through what ranks as one of
the most remarkable experiences ever falling to the lot
of a mariner on the Australian coast. But the other
ship was less fortunate, being blown sheer on to the
island, where she soon became a total wreck and quickly
broke up. The crew of the latter was saved. There
were thus left the whole crew of one ship; and the crew
of the other ship, with the single exception of the one
man who had been blown away in her, and who was
given up for lost. Two of the boats of the -wrecked
ship were secured. The combined crews then got to
work on these frail craft, with a view to reaching the
mainland. They raised a light bulwark of planks
round the gunwales of both boats, and with the little
vessels thus made more seaworthy they sailed for Mary-
borough, which place they safely reached. On arriving
at that port the sailors raffled the boats, for which they
had no further use, and to Robert Blackman fell the
captain’s gig, which was afterwards described by his
brother as being large and beautifully built.
This boat was then secured by Joseph Willmott,
Jack Allport, Joseph Trundle, and two others for the
purpose of taking them to Port Curtis, where they pro-
posed to settle. On examination the little craft was
found to be rotten in places, and she was hauled out of
the water, and Frederick Archibald Blackman was given
the task of repairing her. The last-named pioneer was
at that time but seventeen years of age, but he was
known to be a good hand with tools, and the prospective
crew was quite prepared to place confidence in his work.
A good many people at Maryborough called the boat
a coffin ship, and openly proclaimed the enterprise as
a foolhardy undertaking; but the young men duly put
to sea. Among the men were some well able to sail a


boat, and, fortunately, only good weather was experi-
enced, so that Port Curtis was reached in due course.
But on arrival at their destination the party found that
their craft was far too rotten to again attempt the open
sea in. A camp was pitched, not at the original site
chosen by Colonel Barney, but at Auckland Point, and
here the first hut was built. It was composed of round
saplings, and was the first home in Gladstone.
Shortly after this party set up a residence at Glad-
stone Frederick Archibald Blackman, accompanied by
two others, made an important overland journey to the
same jflace from Maryborough, a distance of 220 miles.
At that time the furthest fringe of northern settlement
had not reached to within a hundred miles of Glad-
stone, so that young Blackman, in covering his final
stage, was passing over wild and unoccupied territory.
The expedition arose from a report that excellent
man brought a tent of stout calico, but it was not
spear-proof. The principal danger of the journey lay
in the possibility of attack from blacks, who in that
locality and at that particular period were hostile and
treacherous, and almost always attacked at night.
During the first 150 miles Blackman passed through
five stations, at the homesteads of which he received
the hospitality so characteristic of the bush in those
early days. "Rosedale” was the last station out, and here
the party fitted out for the final and most dangerous
part of the expedition. A fresh supply of flour and
salt meat was procured, and a start was made for Port
Curtis. The first twenty-five miles proved difficult to
get over on account of the country being hilly and
crossed by many creeks. In places the travellers had to
cut their way through dense scrub. During the whole
journey the waterholes and creeks were so well stocked
GLADSTONE.
prospects of gold had been discovered in the vicinity of
a surveyor’s camp on the Calliope, then known as the
Liffey, at a spot about twenty-five miles from where
the hut had been erected on Auckland Point. Robert
Blackman, one of the pioneers of that part of Queens-
land, determined to send a prospecting party overland
to the new field. He placed Frederick Archibald Black-
man in charge, and with him sent a German named
Haudt and a black boy, who was called “Birramo.”
Although the leader was so youthful, he had good
experience of the bush and had proved himself self-
reliant and of sound judgment. Subsequent events
showed that no error had been committed in arriving
at the choice of commanders. The equipment was but
slender. Each of the party had one horse, whilst there
was a single pack-horse to do service for the trio. Black-
with fish and wild fowl that the party hardly touched
the salt meat which it carried. One night was
spent beside a beautiful waterhole in the midst of a
grassy plain, the surface of which was very little above
the level of the water. The lagoon was of serpentine
form, being about a mile in length and fifty yards
across. Several hours were profitably spent here with
rod and gun. No blacks were seen, though the young
leader remarked afterwards that he was sure the natives
had seen plenty of the small party, which, throughout
the whole journey, failed to adopt the simple precaution
of keeping a watch at night. Yet some years after-
wards a daring murder was committed by the aborigines
at this very spot. The headquarters of a station called
Miriam Vale” had been established near the lagoon,
and at the time alluded to shearing was in progress,


and about twenty white men were at the homestead.
But attacking at night, according to their custom, the
blacks were not deterred by mere numbers. The first
spear was aimed at the manager while he was sitting
on the verandah of his house smoking in his chair. He
was badly wounded on the shoulder. One of the
shearers named Jack Hillary, hearing the noise of the
assault, took up his gun, and as he was pushing his
tent door aside he received a spear through the heart.
The blacks then retreated and camped on a mountain
four miles away. Immediately prior to this they had
killed two men at an out-station two miles from the
homestead. Had the assailants followed up the first
shower of spears they might have massacred all hands,
for the only man who seems to have shown any pluck
was the unfortunate shearer who was killed. It was
among natives of this description that the pioneers of
Gladstone and Central Queensland travelled almost
unsuspectingly, often failing to keep guard at night,
and offering ready marks to the showers of spears which
at any time might fall among them.
The prospecting party did not prove to be a happy
family within itself. Haudt proved himself to be a
man of most violent temper, and one whom the leader
felt he could never thoroughly trust. The first break
occurred over the black boy. Thinking the German
was bullying the latter for something which was not the
native’s fault Blackman remonstrated with'the German,
whereupon the foreigner flew into a most ungovernable
passion, and taking his gun threatened to shoot the two
other members of the party and then commit suicide.
But the young leader showed no fear, and obtaining
possession of his own gun he threatened to shoot first.
Haudt knew the Englishman to be the better shot of
the two and he subsided, afterwards professing sorrow
for what had transpired, and excusing himself on the
grounds that all his life he had been subject to spasms
of temper during which he was not responsible for his
actions. But during the whole of the journey Haudt
was a morose, unpleasant companion, and when he
finally stole a horse Blackman concluded that his dislike
of the man had been based on good grounds.
On arrival at Port Curtis Blackman was pleased to
see his old friends who had left Maryborough in the
boat under the circumstances described. They were all
tolerably well, but had suffered torments from the sand
flies, which were particularly bad at that time of the
year. A bullock team was at Port Curtis at that time.
It had been driven by a Mr. Eraser from the “Rannes”
Station, on the Dawson River, with a load of wool. This
was probably the first team to bring wool to this port.
A vessel had previously been in bringing supplies. From
that time on Gladstone took its place among the com-
mercial ports of the Colony, and continued progressing
888
steadily, though somewhat slowly, right down to con-
temporary times.
Blackman did not linger at Gladstone, but pushed
on to Calliope, where Lieutenant John Murray and a
detachment of native police were camped. They were
stationed temporarily at the spot for the purpose of
safeguarding a Government surveying party which,
under a Mr. McCabe, was at work about four miles
away. In addition, protection had to be afforded to
the embryo settlement which was just forming at Glad-
stone. Examination of the place where the gold was
supposed to exist did not yield any encouragement to
the young prospector. He was met by a Mr. Birch, a
naturalist of some note, who had been sent by the
Government on a scientific tour through the district.
Accompanying the latter was a Dr. Grey. Several hours
of fossicking resulted in the discovery of a few specks of
gold, but so scanty was the quantity that the outlook
hardly justified further consideration. With no exalted
opinion of the new field the little party turned back.
The homeward journey proved somewhat richer in
incident than had the expedition outward, narrow
escape from murder at the hands of blacks illustrating
how grave a risk had been run by Blackman and his
companions when making their way towards Port Curtis.
After the latter had started homeward three troopers
set out close on their tracks. A band of blacks, who
had intended surprising the prospectors, cut the tracks
of the troopers and followed them up. The natives had
heard of the smallness of Blackman’s party and the
ease with which it might be assailed. There is little
doubt that a conflict would have taken place had the
young leader and his two companions not been thus pro-
tected, for the attack was duly launched, but was borne
by the other three. Having been warned of the risks
he was running, Blackman hurried along his journey
with all possible speed, endeavouring to render it impos-
sible for any band of natives to keep pace with them
in order to choose their time of attacking.
The troopers were less fortunate in their experi-
ences. As was their habit the aborigines made their
attack during the darkness, on this occasion selecting
an hour before dawn. The first spear was thrown
when one of the white men rising to light his pipe
picked up a burning ember from the fire, and immedi-
ately received a spear in the fleshy part of his breast.
The natives then rushed the camp; but the wounded
man, pulling the weapon from his own body, returned
it with interest. His companions were instantly on
their feet, but there was no time for firing. All three
clubbed their rifles and broke the stocks with the force
of the blows which they rained on their assailants. Two
of the troopers were desperately wounded, but they suc-
ceeded in beating off the attacking party—a feat which


was accomplished partly with the aid of the native
weapons which the white men had w r rested from their
enemies and were able to handle with deadly effect. The
aborigines had received a surprise. Undoubtedly they
believed they were attacking a youth, a man, and a
black, all of whom would be asleep. A massacre would
have been easy work. But instead the savages were
faced with three strong and trained men, all well on the
alert. The two wounded men afterwards died from the
effects of their injuries. One was a well-educated black
named Bungaree, and the other an Englishman named
John Brown. Bungaree had been to a good school in
Sydney, and proved himself a capable and trustworthy
servant, though he took periodical excursions into the
bush, where for a short while he would return to the
old, wild life of his ancestors.
Some years later the Calliope field was the centre
of a rush, and on that occasion the prospects were
thoroughly tested, but again the results were disappoint-
ing. A little alluvial gold was found in patches and
reefs were opened, but more money was spent on the
place than ever came out of it. Blackman, with one of his
brothers, shortly after the expedition just related, took
up the first run in the Port Curtis district.
When in 1854 New South Wales politicians foresaw
separation, and were anxious that the capital of the
new Colony should be much further northward than
Brisbane, whose people were wanting to include all
south to the 30th parallel, the line for which Dr. Lang
fought so strenuously, the existing Administration sur-
veyed a township at Port Curtis, calling it “Gladstone,"’
and sent Sir Maurice O’Connell there as the first Govern-
ment Resident, in hopes that the embryo town would
be chosen as the seat of government of the new Colony.
The first sale of Gladstone land was held in Sydney on
February 8 and 9, 1854, and the prices realized clearly
show that the buyers fully expected that they were invest-
ing in what was to be the capital city of a new Colony.
Twenty-one town allotments along the ridge ending in
Auckland Park were sold at an upset of £2O per acre,
and realized £3lB per acre. One-quarter of an acre
was said to have realized over a thousand pounds, but
that seems incredible. Of suburban lands 215 acres
were sold at an upset price of £2 and £2 10s. per acre,
and realized £9. Specially interesting are the names of
some of the buyers. One in after years was to be Sir
James Martin, a Premier and a Chief Justice of New
South Wales, and another became a Premier of that
Colony, and his name was William Forster, once a
squatter on the Burnett River, whose name is associated
with the discovery of the Ceratodvs Forsteri, mentioned
elsewhere in this work.
fn 1854 a large Dutch ship of 900 tons, called
the “Hester,” left Sydney, and was wrecked off
Keen Reef, 350 miles north-eastward of Cape Capri-
corn, and the officers and crew, a total of eighteen,
finally reached Keppel Bay in the long-boat, after
eight miserable days of starvation and thirst. They
ran through the Narrows to Gladstone, reaching there
in the last stages of exhaustion to be hospitably fed
and cared for by O’Connell’s party.
When gold was found in 1858 by Chappie at
Canoona on the Fitzroy the whole male population of
Gladstone fled to the new diggings, leaving only the
women and children and old men.
Gladstone stands on the edge of highly-mineralized
country, much of it gold bearing, and there is a mine of
manganese in the town itself , on Auckland Point, whence
the jetty extends, the shipping commanding 24 ft. at low
tide. The town stands on high dry healthy country, with
a fall on the north and east to the harbour. Its
population at the end of 1920 represented over
2,500 people. The town is the port for the produce
of a large number of mines, a considerable number of
pastoral properties, and a rich and extensive agricultural
district. It was the first Queensland port whence horses
were shipped to India. In 1855 Sir Maurice
O’Connell predicted a great future for Gladstone,
which is favoured by many natural advantages,
possessing not only a first-class, perfectly-sheltered
harbour, but a very fine site for a town, solid and
perfectly drained, a position that could be made pic-
turesquely beautiful at a moderate cost, for it has ideal
waters for boating and fishing and canoeing, charming
places for picnics and excursions. From Gladstone
you can go by rowing boat, motor boat, or canoe
through the long channel called the “Narrows”
from Gladstone Harbour to the Fitzroy River, pass-
ing the spot where the tides meet from Keppel
Bay and Gladstone Harbour, and where at low
tide you can walk from Curtis Island to the mainland
with your boots on, the channel being nearly dry.
Before the railway was made to Rockhampton the pas-
senger traffic went to and from Gladstone through the
Narrows in a stern-wheel flat-bottomed steamer to land
at Broadmount, on the Fitzroy River, and go thence by
rail to Rockhampton.
Curtis Island forms the western side of the Narrows,
is about 26 miles in length, and on the north-eastern end
is Cape Capricorn, on which is an important lighthouse.
A narrow channel, only navigable by cutters or motor
launches, divides the southern end of Curtis Island from
Facing Island. There are many small and very
picturesque islands in Gladstone Harbour, and it forms
an ideal spot for motor or sailing boats.
It is predicted by some that the time is coming
when Gladstone, by virtue of that harbour, will become
the seaport of Central Queensland.


WILLIAM HENRY ROSSER,
Mapleton, was born at “Tythe”
Farm, near Carphilly, Glamorgan-
shire, Wales, on April 11, 1862, a
property belonging to his father, who
MR. W. J. ROSEER.
came of a long line of farmers, well
known for centuries past and at the
present day in that County. Whilst
visiting relatives at Perrycord Castle,
near Newport, the late Mr. Rosser
met with an accident which caused
his death in the year 1872, his
widow, Elizabeth, daughter of
Captain Jenkins, master of a pas-
senger vessel plying in the Bristol
Channel, surviving him for nearly
30 years. The gentleman under
review was educated at the Browning
School, near Bath, where he was a
boarder, continuing his studies there
until 15 years of age. Being desirous

of enlarging his experience by travel,
he sailed for Australia by the “Dun-
bar Castle” in 1877, and landing at
the old "emigrants’ wharf,” called
on the Kev. Mr. Rosen fell, at Redhill,
bbb2
who recommended him to a Mr.
Upton, of Brookfield, near Brisbane.
The latter gentleman offered him a
block of land for his own use in
return for assistance in clearing
operations, and accepting this offer,
the young Welshman put his shoul-
der to the wheel with such good
results that within a very short time
he had about 16 acres of his own
holding prepared for cultivation,
from which by the end of 12 months
he had gathered some 900 bushels of
maize. For the purpose of securing
further capital he obtained employ-
ment with the firm of Fraser and
McDonald, railway contractors,
being appointed foreman in charge
of the timber department —a respon-
sible position for a 17-year-old lad.
During the seven years of his con-
nection with this firm they carried
out various important contracts,
including extensions from Beenleigh
to Southport, from Emerald to
Clermont, and from Blythedale to
Charleville. Subsequent to the
resignation of his duties with
Fraser & McDonald, Mr. Rosser in
1886 was seized with the “land
fever,” and visited Christmas Creek,
a tributary at the head of the Logan
River, where he took up 1,000 acres,
for which he gave from 2s. 6d. to
7s. 6d. per acre. His health, how-
ever, prevented him from continuing
operations on this holding, and
abandoning the selection he turned
his attention to contracting for the
supply of timber in railway con-
struction. For this purpose he con-
structed a bridge across the Logan,
which in a time of heavy floods was
washed away, a disaster which was
repeated after the erection of a
second bridge on his behalf by the
contractors, Messrs. Bond & Mason.
On account of this misfortune he
was unable to carry out his contract
to supply a large quantity of piles,
girders, etc., which he had ready,
and as a result sustained a loss
of over £l,OOO. For two years
succeeding he contented himself with
small contracts, and also engaged in
hotel and storekeeping pursuits. In
1894, with Mapleton as an objective,
after making the train journey to
Nambour he walked through bush
and scrub to the top of the Blackall
Ranges, and being well satisfied with
his visit of inspection returned to
Brisbane, and completed arrange-
ments for taking up a selection of
150 acres. Repeating his former
programme, he arrived at his new
holding, armed with a pitsaw, and
after clearing a small area erected a
“humpy,” and sent for his wife and
children. Before long a five-acre
plantation of bananas testified to his
industry and enterprise, and this was

followed up by 30 acres devoted to
oranges and strawberries, the former
fruit being somewhat rare in those
days. With other settlers he aided
in the cutting of a track across the
bush to Nambour, by means of which
they conveyed their produce on
horseback to the town, and later he
was one of the leading spirits in
agitating for the construction of the
present good coach route to Maple-
ton. In 1894 he began to acquire
further territory, and gradually
became the owner of some 2,000
acres in the district, which he is
assured must advance rapidly in the
near future. Mr. Rosser has been
the pioneer in almost all progressive
movements, being the first post-
master, butcher, and hotel proprie-
tor in Mapleton. Knowing the
value of the forest timber in the
locality, comprising cedar, beech,
pine, and other hardwoods, he built
a sawmill, the output of which


supplies all the surrounding district,
and finds its way to Wynnum South,
where Mr. Rosser recently opened a
timber-yard, and Sydney, New
South Wales. He has no less than
four fine bullock teams engaged in
the timber industry on a 17-mile
forest reserve at Mapleton, where he
has obtained the right to cut for his
own purposes; and the tramline
recently constructed between Maple-
ton and Nambour is largely used by
him for the transport of freight of
this description. Mr. Rosser married
Caroline Constance, daughter of Mr.
O’Brien, of West End, Brisbane,
and has four sons and three daugh-
ters. His eldest son, William Henry,
upon leaving school, selected 160
acres of land, where he began farm-
ing under his father’s supervision,
but upon the declaration of war
between England and Germany he
was the first in the district to volun-
teer for active service, leaving in
May, 1915, for the front with the
Fourth Ligho Horse, 11th Regiment.
WILLIAM COLLINS, orchardist,
“Surrey Hill,’’ Mapleton, is a son of
the late Daniel James Collins, who
was born in Surrey, England, in
1836, and before leaving for Aus-
tralia in 1861 was employed in the
engineering work of a sawmill in
MR. DANIEL JAMES COLLINS.
that County. He landed with hie
wife and two children at Brisbane,
and shortly afterwards found
employment on a selection owned by
Mr. Sayer at Rocklea, then known
as Rocky Waterholes, where he
remained for six months. Deciding
to launch out on his own account,
with his brother, Mr. Elias Collins,
he started a contracting business,
undertaking clearing and fencing for
the settlers in the above-named dis-
trict. After continuing this work
for three years, the partners leased
a farm at Oxley Creek, but on
account of bad seasons and floods
were not fortunate in this venture.
They next selected 90 acres each at
Bunya, on the South Pine River,
about 12 miles from Brisbane, and,
with the help of his family, Mr. D. J.
Collins set to work to clear sufficient
ground for the erection of a slab
“humpy,” after which he prepared
ten acres for cotton growing. On
account of the poor prices realized by
this product he turned his attention
to maize and potatoes with greater
success, and after 14 years purchased
a block of 37 acres in the Redland
Bay district, where he cultivated
bananas and pineapples, and also
planted three acres with oranges. He
held this land from 1885 to 1901,
when he retired from active pur-
suits, and, letting the property,
resided at Plargreave Road, West
End, near Brisbane, until the time of
his death on April 14, 1914. Mr.
William Collins was born at Rocklea
in 1865, and received his education
at Albany Creek, near Bunya. At
16 he began work with his father on
the home farm, and some five years
later received a block of land at
Redland Bay from his father, com-
prising 11 acres, which he cleared
and converted into a banana planta-
tion. After working this property
for six years he leased it to a
Mr. Yeo, and proceeding to Isis,
between Maryborough and Bunda-
berg, obtained a lease of 30 acres
from the South Isis Sugar Company
for cane-growing purposes. The land
was still in its rough state, and two
years elapsed before his first cane
was cut, on which he paid the com-
pany a royalty of Is. per ton. After
five years he sold the lease and
returned to his father’s old home-
stead at Bunya, where he carried on
dairying pursuits for a time. The
big drought of 1891-2 made it neces-
sary to feed hie cattle on banana
stalks, procured from a 40-acre
plantation owned by his cousins, and
upon the expiration of his lease he
trucked the stock to Nambour,
where he sold them at a fair figure.
While visiting relatives he made an
inspection of the district surrounding
Mapleton, and eventually secured
a block of 3l£ acres, which has been
so highly improved by Mr. Collins
and his sons that within a very few
years he was offered £lOO per acre
MR. WILLIAM COLLINS.
for land that had originally cost him
£6 7s. 6d. per acre. This estate is
known as “Kingview,” and is prin-
cipally devoted to the cultivation
of oranges and strawberries. Mr.
Collins next purchased 33 acres close
to the township of Mapleton, which
he has developed as an orchard for
citrus fruits, devoting a portion to
a homestead area, whereon he has
erected a fine residence of eight
rooms, replete with every conveni-
ence. He married in 1889 Ada E.,
daughter of the late John Johnson,
of Sheffield, England, and has four
sons and one daughter. The two
elder sons manage the “Kingview”
Estate, where they have a nursery,
from which most of the fruitgrowers
in the district procure their young
trees, while the second youngest son,
Sydney, assists his father at “Surrey
Hill.”
RICHARD HERRON, fruit-
grower, of Mapleton, is a son of Mr.
Thomas Herron, now living in
retirement at Taringa, near Bris-
bane, who was born in County
Armagh, Ireland, on November 25,
1845, and as a lad was engaged with
his father in farming pursuits. As
a young man he went to work in
the shipping yards of Glasgow, and

subsequently sailed for Queensland
in the vessel "Light of the Age,”
arriving at Brisbane on March" 29,
1866. Pie soon found employment
in the capital city, and after follow-
ing various avocations in Brisbane
selected a homestead block at Pullen-
vale, about 12 miles from the metro-
polis, in the vicinity of the Moggil
Road. In 1869 he married Ann
Jane, daughter of Mr. Samuel Gray,
of County Fermanagh, Ireland, and
taking his newly-wedded wife to
Pullenvale, settled down to family
life, clearing, fencing, and planting
his farm, and bringing up a family
of 10 —six sons and four daughters
—who as they grew old enough took
their share in the work of the hold-
ing, which is now practically the
only original selection left in the
district. Since Mr. Herron’s retire-
ment from active pursuits, the
Pullenvale property has been taken
over by his son, Mr. Robert Henry
Herron; while another son, Joseph,
is working country selected by his
father at Samson Creek. Of Mr.
Thomas Herron’s other sons, Mr.
William Herron has been employed
in the General Post Office, Brisbane,

railway workshops; and Mr. Samuel
James Herron instructs the lads in
the saddlery trade at St. Helena.
The subject of this review, Mr.
Richard Herron, was born at
Pullen vale, and received his education
at the local public school. At 14
years of age he began to work on the
homestead farm, and two years later,
being sufficiently experienced to be
of considerable assistance, accom-
panied his brother Joseph to Sam-
son Creek, where he helped to
prepare the virgin holding for culti-
vation. Purchasing a team of
bullocks, they carted timber to the
sawmills, and in this way eked out
a livelihood during the earlier
months of their venture, afterwards
augmenting their income by dairy-
ing and the sale of corn and other
crops. Leaving his brother on this
selection, Mr. Richard Herron took
a party of men from Brisbane to do
contract work on the sugarcane
plantations at Port Douglas, and
continued at this port for three

years, during which time he under-
took the management of a farm for
a Mr. Lambert. Upon leaving here
he spent over a year and a half with
an uncle at Billinudgel, New South
Wales, whom he assisted in dairying
operations, and returning to Queens-
land purchased his present property
in June 1910. The holding at that
time consisted of acres of rough
scrub country, unfenced, and
totally unimproved; but undaunted
Mr. Herron applied himself with
vigour to the task before him, and
soon had 18 acres planted with
bananas, a home built, and a few
rows set with pineapples. Since
then he has continued with unabated
zeal, and has had the satisfaction
of sending his fruits to all parts of
Australia, as much as 500 cwt. of
bananas being despatched to the
various markets in a single year. He
grows several varieties of this popu-
lar fruit, including the Cavendish,
sugar banana, lady’s fingers, and a
very large species known as the

plantain; and in addition has
planted an orange orchard, and a
large number of passion vines, which
bear prolific crops with very little
attention, but on account of the low
market prices hardly pay for the
trouble of transport, and conse-
quently are being allowed to run
wild. Mr. Herron married Christina,
daughter of Mr. P. A. Neilson, now
living in retirement at Samford,
about 15 miles from Brisbane, and
formerly engaged in the cultivation of
his own farm at the head of the Pine
River. Their family consists of two
sons and one daughter. Mr. Richard
Herron’s great-grandfather, the late
James Simonton, lived to the extra-
ordinary age of 114 years. Born in
Ireland, at an early age he turned
to farming pursuits, and later
became a tenant on the "Colebrooke”
Estate, in the parish of Aghalur-
cher, where he remained until the
time of his demise on July 26, 1877.
During his lifetime he was per-
sonally acquainted with six genera-
tions of the Colebrook family. He
was strictly temperate, and a non-
smoker, and always enjoyed excel-
lent health. The portrait reproduced
with this article was taken on the
107th anniversary of his birth, on
which occasion he walked five miles
to the studio in which the portrait
was made.


HARRY JOHNSON, “Mountain
View,” Mapleton, is a son of Mr.
David Henry Johnson, a native of
Buckinghamshire, England, and
descendant of a long line of farmers
who for centuries had occupied the
same farm, which was worked by
succeeding generations down to the
present day. Leaving the Old
Country with his wife and one son
in 1873, Mr. D. H. Johnson voyaged
by the sailing-vessel “Ramsay,”
bound for Moreton Bay, and their
destination reached, proceeded to the
Ipswich Depot, where he obtained
work on the railway line between
Brisbane and Ipswich, then in course
of construction. For about 17 years
he was engaged in this class of
employment, and at the end of that
period took up a block of land in
the Mapleton district, of which he
became one of the early pioneers.
He started fruitgrowing operations,
and relates how on one occasion he
sent a load of bananas to Brisbane,
for which he received the munificent
sum of 2s. 6d. Steadily making his
way, however, he has resided ever
since on his selection, and, although
now in his sixty-fifth year, is hale
and hearty, and able to do his share
of work with the best. The gentle-

branch of his operations by his only
son, who is very popular on the
road. He is keenly interested in the
development of the district, the
growth of which he has watched
from the very commencement, wit-
nessing the rise of a flourishing little
township from the very midst of the
thick, dense scrub which covered the
site of Mapleton originally, and
orchard after orchard spring up in
the vicinity of the village. The value
of the land has increased greatly
during the past few years, Mr.
Johnson, sen., having sold a portion
of his homestead property for as
high a figure as ,£lOO per acre, and
the place is rapidly establishing its
reputation to be one of the foremost
dairying and fruitgrowing districts
in Queensland. In addition to his
other interests, Mr. Johnson con-
ducts a general store, and is in all
respects a progressive and up-to-date
member of the community. Although
the advent of a tram line between
Mapleton and Nambour might affect
his private enterprise, he is dis-
interested enough to be a strong
advocate of this innovation, believ-
ing that it would be of considerable
benefit to the district; and in many
other ways he proves himself a useful
and influential worker for the public
good. He married Selina, daughter

“GLENGARRY” ORCHARD,
Maroochy River, near Nambour.
Messrs. F. W. Blanch and Edward
James Blanch, the proprietors of
this well-known orchard, are sons
MR. F. W. BRANCH.
of the late Frederick George Blanch,
a pioneer of the Clarence River,
New South Wales, who came origi-
nally from the County of Kent,
England, where he was born in 1838.
When only two years of age the late
gentleman was brought to Australia
by his parents, the family after dis-
embarking at Sydney proceeding by
bullock team to the Hunter River,
where they were engaged in dairy-
ing pursuits for some little time.
Shortly after the big flood in the
Hunter River in 1857 Mr. F. G.
Blanch made the trip to the Clar-
ence in the small paddle-wheel
steamer “Grafton,” and sailing up
the river to Laurence (then known
as “The Elbow”), passed there the
first signs of habitation by whites,
a squatter’s outstation having been
formed in this locality. Continuing
up the river, Rocky Mouth (now
Maclean) came into view, untouched
by even the fringe of European
settlement, but farther along the
course of the stream a landing was
effected at Ulmarra, or The Sand-
spit of that period, where a few
farmers were living in tents and
gunyahs. The young pioneer
obtained employment in clearing
work until the arrival of the rest
of the family about two months
later, when he assisted his father
to split a quantity of ironbark
shingles for a resident of Grafton,
which took them to the Swan Creek
Ridges in search of the special kind
of timber needed. Eventually a
farm was secured at Lower Ulmarra,
which when cleared yielded a harvest
of maize in the following season, and
operations were carried on here until
1861, when, under the Free Selection
Act, the family took up land at the
back of the South Arm, a little above
the junction of the Coldstream.
Wheat was planted, and subse-
quently cotton, but machinery was
difficult to obtain, and a stripping
machine procured from the Hawkes-
bury River, where they were largely
used at the time, proved unsuitable,
as it required eight bullocks to work
it, and these animals were found to
be too slow to make the necessary
speed; while farm horses had not
yet been brought into use in the
district. Rust, too, was prevalent,
so that wheat proved a, partial
failure; and as the cotton pods
matured in the rainy season, which
injured the quality, while in the
absence of cotton-gins the seed could
not be extracted from the fibre, this
industry fared even worse. Upon
the inception of the sugar enterprise,
however, the late Mr. Blanch’s
father erected a fairly large steam
sugarmill, which proved a very
successful departure; and in 1865
the younger man started on his own
account on a farm at Cowper, where
he continued for some 44 years. In
MR. FREDERICK GEORGE BLANCH.
the early nineties the dairying
industry began to come into promi-
nence, and gradually the late Mr.
Blanch confined his efforts to work
of this nature, ultimately retiring
from active life and removing to
Grafton, where he died in May,
1915. His reminiscences were fre-
quently of a most interesting nature,
throwing light upon the difficulties

encountered by the early settlers in
working out their propositions; and
among other things he would relate
how maize and corn were shelled in
most primitive fashion, the husks
being placed in bags, over which
horses were driven, and after
undergoing the sifting process the
cereal was carried to the river and
tipped into the hold of a sailing
vessel for transport to market, the
consignments of the various owners
being separated merely by leaves
and twigs. Messrs. F. W. Blanch
and E. J. Blanch were both born on
a farm known as “Alicefield,” on the
Clarence River, near Cowper, and
were educated at the Cowper State
School. At an early age they were
initiated into farming duties, and
eventually worked the property on
the share system in partnership with
their father for some considerable
time. Later, the two sons leased the
holding and inaugurated dairy-
farming on an extensive scale, intro-
ducing milking machines and other
up-to-date appliances. Whilst on a
visit to the Blackall Ranges,
Queensland, Mr. F. W. Blanch
became interested in the fruitgrow-
ing industry, and after inspecting
several properties, in conjunction
with his brother he purchased their
present holding of 90 acres, and
immediately set to work to clear a
small portion on which to erect a
homestead. For the first nine months


Mr. F. W. Blanch carried on single-
handed, his brother remaining at
Clarence River until the expiration
of the lease; yet in a remarkably
short time 10 acres of ground were
prepared for cultivation, three acres
being devoted to bananas, an acre
each to oranges and custard apples,
while the balance was planted with
pineapples. The property, which
has a frontage of a mile and a half
to the Maroochy River, is very
favourably situated for enterprise of
this description, and the brothers
expect in course of time to become
the largest growers of pineapples in
the district, whilst they have also
met with much success in the culti-
vation of sugarcane. At the last
Nambour Show they won first prize
for an exhibit of four dozen pines in
open competition with the district
growers. The Messrs. Blanch are
erecting a sawmill for the purpose
of cutting their own timber for
cases, by means of which they will
avoid much inconvenience and
delay. Mr. F. W. Blanch married
Elizabeth, daughter of Mr. Charles
Lee, a pioneer farmer of Calliope,
near Cowper, New South Wales, and
has two children; while Mr. E. J.
Blanch espoused Gertie, daughter of
the late Mr. Avery, of Orara, in
the same State, the issue being two
sons and a daughter.
JOHN MURTAGH, J.P., of
“Dulong,” Dulong, is a son of the
late Dennis Murtagh, and was born
at Aclare, Sligo, Ireland, on Novem-
ber 10, 1851. He received a scanty
education at the local national
school, which he attended only
during the winter, in other seasons
being employed in helping his
parents on the home farm. When
f. 4 years of age he obtained a posi-
tion as coachman, but being ambi-
tious for a wider scope, crossed to
Yorkshire, and worked at the build-
ing trade for about 18 months.
Coming to Australia with his
brother Martin by the “Southern
Belle” in 1870, after a rough trip of
16 weeks they landed at Rockhamp-
ton, and shortly afterwards Mr.
Murtagh was engaged by Mr. James
Atherton, of “Adelaide Park” Sta-
tion, where he remained for about
six months. He next accompanied
Mr. John Atherton to the Palmer
goldfields, overlanding cattle in
expectation of finding a ready sale,
but being disappointed in this
respect, killed and sold the cattle for
beef. Upon leaving the goldfields
Mr. Murtagh returned to Rock-
hampton, taking three months on
the trip, which was dangerous on
account of the aborigines, who were
numerous and hostile. He was
employed on the central railway at
Rocky Creek for some time, and
later contracted to cut cordwood for
the furnaces on the Peak Downs
copper mines, following which he
pemired a contract for dam construc-
tion at “Mantuan Downs” Station,
Springsure. He was afterwards
engaged in handling sheep at
Blackall, and also with a mate,
William Chippendale, gained con-
siderable experience on “Hoodsville”
Station, the property of Sir Samuel
Wilson, the well-known Victorian
pastoralist. Leaving “Hoodsville,”
he crossed the New South Wales

border with Chippendale, and
during a period of drought was occu-
pied in the building of dams across
the Paroo River, subsequently tak-
ing on fencing contracts at Paroo.
Whilst in this district he travelled
150 miles further into the interior,
returning to build a number of
drafting yards for Sir Samuel Wil-
son, after which he sold out and came
to Cunnamulla. When within 15
miles of his destination his horses
knocked up, forcing him to camp for
the night, but whilst he was sleeping
the animals got away, and he had
to proceed on foot. He next went
to Dal by, via Charleville, where he
arrived after a somewhat exciting
journey, on account of the Conda-
mine River being in flood. Continuing
his travels Mr. Murtagh arrived
at Brisbane, where after a brief stay
he set out for Melbourne. Having
saved a considerable sum of money,
he decided to revisit the scenes of
his youth, and sailing for England,
visited Yorkshire and Durham, and
other parts of the United Kingdom,
during the course of his travels
taking to himself a wife. Finally he
settled down in Yorkshire, and
obtaining lucrative employment,
made his home there for nine years,
at the end of which period he
decided again to set sail for Aus-
tralia, this time voyaging with his
wife and daughters by the vessel
“Quetta.” For a time he formed a
member of the maintenance gang
in connection with the telegraph line
construction between Woombye and
Gympie, and during this period
availed himself of an opportunity to
select the site of his present home-
stead, on a tract of country which
had not then been surveyed. After
an 18-months’ sojourn in Brisbane
he proceeded to take possession of his
selection, having practically to cut
his way through the dense scrub
which covered the ground. His first
act was to prepare timber for the
erection of a home, beech trees being
chosen for this purpose, and when
the walls were up and the roof
securely fastened, he manufactured
all the furniture for the dwelling
with his own hands. This house was
burnt down about 1895, but has
since been rebuilt. Mr. Murtagh
continued timber-getting for com-
mercial purposes for a few years, but
about 1900 turned his attention
chiefly to the improvement of his
farm, and became interested in the
dairying industry, from which he
has since retired. He busied himself
in obtaining postal facilities for the
district, and has proved a very
useful member of the community in
many ways. He was a member of
the Maroochy Divisional Board for
a few years; was chairman of the
committee which applied for a school
reserve when first the country was
thrown open for settlement; and is
recognized as the pioneer of the
district. He has acted as scrutineer
at Nambour for the past 28 years,
and has also been employed in taking
census returns at various centres.
Mr. Murtagh married in the first
instance Miss Emma Feather, who
died on December 11, 1893, leaving
five daughters. His second wife was
Mrs. Tampinen, of Dulong, who died
on February 2, 1915, two children
surviving her.


WILLIAM WALTER MALLET,
grazier and fruitgrower, “Blythe-
field,” Nambour, is a son of Mr.
John Mallet, who, born on “Yugil-
bar” Station on the Clarence River,
after spending a number of years in
that district, served his apprentice-
ship to the shoemaking trade at
Casino, and subsequently became an
employe of Mr. Hochey, of Grafton.
Eventually Mr. Mallet returned to
the agricultural industry at the
Clarence River, and at a later date
was engaged in droving stock in the
vicinity of Mclntyre, Gwydir, Rich-
mond and Hunter Rivers, in New
South AVales. He finally settled
down at Lismore, where he still
resides, having celebrated his seven-
tieth birthday in May, 1915. Mr.
Mallet married Mary Ann, daughter
of Mr. John Webber, a resident of
MR. WILLIAM WALTER MALLET.
the Hunter River district, by whom
he has issue four sons and four
daughters, The subject of this
notice, Mr. W. W. Mallet, was born
at Wyrallah, on the Richmond
River, in 1877, and attended the
local public school, which he left at
13 years of age. He started work
on a farm for a wage of 4s. a week,
rising with the sun, and frequently
working 18 hours at a stretch.
During the two years that he spent
on this place he obtained a fair
insight into the dairying industry,
and eventually secured a better
position in the same district, where
he was paid 7s. weekly. After two
and a half years he renounced this
in favour of bush life, being
employed in the clearing of scrub on
settlers’ holdings, and also turned
his energies in the direction of cane
cutting for a time. He ultimately
found congenial and lucrative occu-
pation in the sawmilling industry,
and rose to the position of head

sawyer in the mill owned by the firm
of Hollingworth & Mallet, the latter
being a cousin of Mr. W. W. Mallet.
After five years in this connection
he decided to start farming on his
own account, and visiting Queens- •
land in company with a partner,
after looking round he selected a
property at Eumundi, about 14
miles distant from his present pro-
perty, and took it on a clearing
lease with the option of purchase.
BANANA PLANTATION.
The country here was in a very
rough state, but so energetically did
Mr. Mallet push his enterprise that
when at the close of four and a half
years he disposed of the holding he
had cleared and grassed 200 acres,
and was milking as many as 66 cows.
Dissolving the partnership arrange-
ment that had existed up to this
time, he purchased his present
property of 100 acres, to which he has
since added 44 acres of adjoining
land, and continued dairying opera-
tions for about 12 months. Mean-
while he had planted 20 acres with
bananas, and as soon as this became
a profitable concern he sold his
milking herd, and is now clearing
the whole of the ground for the pur-
pose of devoting a larger area to
fruitgrowing and grazing. He is a
keen advocate of the principle of
co-operation, and is a shareholder in
the Caboolture Butter Factory,
Queensland, the Co-operative Bacon
Curing Company, and the Farmers’
Co-operative District Company. For


two years he acted as district secre-
tary to the Queensland Farmers’
Union in the Lilly district, in which
he took a keen interest, and opened
several branches of the Union in
other places, tie is a member of the
local agricultural society, and is a
large exhibitor at the annual shows.
For many years he has been a
stanch adherent of the Manchester
Unity 1.0.0. F. Lodges throughout
Queensland, was secretary to No.
230 Loyal Star Brunswick, and has
filled all chairs, as a senior officer
opening lodges at Eumundi and

ber of the State School committee of
the district. He married Edith,
daughter of Mr. Thomas Bailey, of
Mullumbimby, New South Wales,
and has three sons.
WILHELM LEIKEFELT, dairy-
farmer, “Mountain View,” Obi Obi,
was born at Hanover, Germany, in
1856, and received his education in
his native town. At 14 years of age
he went to w T ork at an hotel, where
he had charge of the wine-cellars for
two years, subsequently returning to
his parents’ home, and remaining
there for four years, when he joined
the army. He became corporal in
the Brunswick Hussars, with which
regiment he served for three years,
when, obtaining his discharge, he
decided to visit his uncles in
Australia. Sailing in 1881 from
MR. WILHELM LEIKEFELT.
Plymouth, England, by the sailing
ship “Samora,” he arrived at Moreton
Bay on May 21 of that year, and
after landing at Brisbane, whither
he was conveyed by lighter, he
proceeded first to Waterford, where
his uncle, Mr. Andrew Opperman,
was engaged in farming pursuits on
the Logan River. Mr. Opperman
and his brother were interested in a
sugar mill, which they worked with
five other farmers on the co-opera-
tive system, and employment was
soon found for the newcomer in
connection with this enterprise,
which was conducted under the name
of the Eagleby Sugar Mill. In slack
seasons Mr. Leikefelt filled in his
time in sawmilling occupations on
behalf of Messrs. Leigh Brothers,
who owned a sawmill in the same
place; and after continuing in this
way for three years he purchased an
80-acre farm at Dugandan, about 30
miles from Ipswich, which, being
partly cleared, was prepared without
great difficulty for cultivation of
maize and potatoes, which were
planted between the stumps. On
account of the drought which
occurred in 1881, further operations
proved unavailing, and disposing of
the property he removed to Zillmere,
near Brisbane, where he was able
to secure educational advantages for
his children, whilst carrying on a
pineapple farm in that neighbour-
hood. During the two years spent by
Mr. Leikefelt at Zillmere he was
impressed with reports of the valley
country in the Blackall Range, and

when at length this was thrown open
for selection he took up 160 acres on
the Obi Obi River, about 30 miles
from Eumundi, to which shortly
afterwards he brought his family,

a spring cart, which also conveyed
house furniture and implements for
working the farm. The weather
being very rough, the party was

manner of difficulties in getting to
their new home, the roads being very
rough, and the Mary River partly
in flood. Not caring to run the risk
of taking his wife and children across
in the dray, he swam the stream,
taking them on his back, finally
returning for the horse and cart;
but having still to face the Obi Obi
which would have to be crossed at
least half a dozen times before he
could reach his holding, he grate-
fully accepted the hospitality of
Mr. Tamlyn, owner of “Mount Übi”
Station, who insisted on the party
remaining at the station until finer
weather prevailed and the river
should have subsided. After resum-
ing their journey steep hills had to
be negotiated, which after the wet
weather were slippery in the extreme,
and the creeks being still high, more
trouble occurred, from which they
were rescued by two kindly settlers,
who went up to their armpits in
water to help them out of the creek.
The homestead reached after mani-
fold delays, they had barely finished
erecting their tents when steady rain
began, which lasted for three days,
and the whole countryside being
flooded their food supplies and much
of their clothing were spoilt. To
obtain rations Mr. Leikefelt took a
pack horse to Nambour, where, how-
ever, the floods had stopped railway
traffic, and no supplies were obtain-
able. Doing almost the whole of the
journey (15 miles) to and fro on
foot, he returned to his selection to
find the children crying with hunger.
Both parents then set out for a
neighbouring farm, five miles dis-
tant, which on account of the flooded
river they could only reach by a
circuitous route over mountains and
through deep gullies and forests, at
times having cut their track,
and returning the same way to
their tents with food for the
little ones. Being unable to obtain
work in the district, Mr. Leikefelt
travelled 110 miles to the Eagleby
Sugar Mill, where he received 15s.
per week and his keep, and in this
way was able to send provisions to
the family. After a few months he
returned to the homestead, and got
employment on the stations, at the
same time doing a little farming on
his own block. The big drought of
1902-3 caused a temporary set-back,
but was followed by prosperous
times on his little selection, which
finally was developed as a thriving
dairy farm, ultimately being sold at
a good figure by Mr. Leikefelt, who
selected another 400 acres of land in
the Obi Obi Valley, about three
miles distant, where he built a com-
fortable homestead, and carries on
dairying pursuits upon an extended
scale. Although declining the
appointment of Justice of the Peace,
he takes a keen interest in local
affairs, is chairman of the school
board, and in 1905 was one of the
prime agitators for the construction
of a road to Mapleton from Obi Obi,
being spokesman of the deputation
that waited on the authorities to
crave this concession, which enabled
the settlers to travel by vehicles
right through to Nambour. Mr.
Leikefelt married Wilhelmina,
daughter of Mr. Felschow, of One
Tree Hill, Brisbane, an early settler
of the Logan district, and has a
surviving family of nine sons and
one daughter, the only other daugh-
ter dying on January 2, 1915 —a
loss severely felt by the family. It
is interesting to note that Mrs.
Leikefelt’s grandfather fought under
Wellington in the Battle of
Waterloo, while her grandmother
was killed in the Huguenot War in
France.

trade, who emigrated with his
family from the Emerald Isle in the
year 1850. Landing at Melbourne,
the late Mr. Darcy followed his call-
ing in the sister State for some time,
and when gold was first discovered
at Bendigo he was among the ear-
liest to join in the rush consequent
on the news being noised abroad.
Erecting a primitive smithy and
workshop in the vicinity of the dig-
gings, he continued to work at his
trade until the time of his death,
which occurred at the comparatively
early age of 47. Mr. Michael Darcy,
who was a mere boy at the time of
the arrival of the family in Aus-
tralia, received his early education
at a night school in Bendigo,
through the daylight hours working
at the blacksmithing trade and in-
teresting himself in the mining
industry. Having arrived at the
age of 17, he left Victoria for New
Zealand, where he visited some of
the goldfields of the Dominion, and
thenceforward divided his time be-
tween his trade and the more fas-
cinating occupation of prospecting
for gold, being wont to fly to the
anvil when finances were low and
he needed the sinews of war to pur-
sue the mining ventures so dear to
his heart. After four years in New
Zealand he re-crossed the ocean to
the Australian mainland, and land-
ing in Queensland arrived at Gym-
pie in 1862, just a few months be-
fore the great gold rush occurred at
that centre, where he has since
thrown in his lot. Mr. Darcy estab-
lished one of the first blacksmithing
businesses in the early settlement of
Gympie, and among other pioneer
work for which he was partly re-
sponsible was the development of the
No. 1 North Phoenix Mine, the Monk-
land, and many others. Much suc-
cess attended his enterprise in this
direction, and in the middle eighties
he found himself in a position to
relinquish active business pursuits,
since when he has lived in partial
retirement at his pleasant home,
“South Side,” on the outskirts of
the town of Gympie, the site com-
manding a fine view of South Gym-
pie, and overlooking the picturesque
windings of the Upper Mary River.
Mr. Darcy has always displayed a
disinclination for public life, and in
consequence his name has never
been prominent in any of the or-
ganizations for local government.
He is a well-known lover of horses,
and from time to time has owned a
number of representative performers
on the turf, being a member of the
Queensland Turf Club. He married
in 1882 Isabella, daughter of the
late Henry Hill, hotelkeeper, of
Gympie, and has a family of two
sons and one daughter

a championship. It is Mr. McKin-
non’s intention shortly to engage in
the fruitgrowing industry. He takes
an active interest in the district
where he resides, and identifies him-
self cordially with every progressive
movement, being a shareholder in
the Caboolture Butter Factory and
in the Moreton Central Sugar Mill.
He is a committeeman of the Agri-
cultural Society, Nambour. Mr.
McKinnon married Susanna, daugh-
ter of the late William Brown, of
Teven Creek, Richmond River, a
sugarcane grower, who in the earlier
days was interested in shipping in
the Shoalhaven district, on the south
coast of New South Wales. The
issue of this union is one daughter
and three sons.
GEORGE GREATHEAD, general
manager, Moreton Central Sugar
Mill, is a son of the late George Great-
head, a native of Yorkshire, Eng-
land, who came to Queensland, and
settled in Maryborough, turning his
attention to the timber trade. Having
heard good reports of the Burnett
River country, he determined to do
some exploration work on his own
account, and earned the distinction
of being the first white man to take
a boat up the river from Mary-
borough to Bundaberg. In 1870 he
selected a large tract of scrub land
at Moongarra (where his widow now
resides), and putting up a home-
stead, entered upon the work of
clearing and fencing with a view to
starting farming operations. His
enterprise flourished, and at a later
date he became proprietor of the
Hopewell Sugar Plantation and
Mill, and commenced the cultivation
of cane and the manufacture of
sugar, employing as many as 80
hands in connection with the differ-
ent departments of his industry. He
also purchased large supplies of
sugarcane in the district, for which
he paid the highest market price,
and thus materially assisted in
establishing the sugar enterprise at
Bundaberg, which is now recognized
as the leading centre for the produc-
tion of this commodity. Mr. Great-
head was very successful in the
growing of maize on his farm, some
of his crops attaining the record
height of 10 feet, and another
branch of industry which he con-
ducted with excellent results on the
home premises was the manufacture
of butter, large consignments of
which were sent from Bundaberg to
different parts of the State. Mr.
Greathead, who was looked upon as
the pioneer of the district, had con-
siderable trouble with the blacks in
the early stages of his residence
there, the wild tribes requiring con-
stant watch to be kept against their

visitations; but upon finding that
they received consistent kindness at
the hands of the family they ulti-
mately displayed a friendly spirit,
and showed themselves willing to
perform a few tasks in exchange for
tobacco and “tucker.” The late Mr.
Greathead married Ann, daughter of
the late John O’Hagan, who during
the latter part of his life settled at
Woongarra Scrub, where he pur-
chased and cultivated a farm holding.
The subject of this review was born
at Bundaberg in 1873, and received
his education at a local school.
Relinquishing his studies at 15 years
of age, he joined his father at the
Hopewell Sugar Mill, and gave close
attention to the methods of sugar
manufacture in all its branches.
Under Mr. McKinley, the well-
known chemist, who was employed
by the late Mr. Greathead on his
works for about two years, he
became an expert in the business,
and even studied engineering to
qualify himself thoroughly in that
department. After the death of his
father in 1887 he took over the man-
agement of the mill, and continued
for five years, when the estate was
wound up. He then accepted an
engagement with Mr. Fred Buss,
the well-known sugar planter, who
offered him a position in the Pember-
ton Knock-Roe and Victor Sugar
mills, Where he remained for another
five years. Desiring to enlarge his
experience, he paid a visit to the
Fiji Islands, where he found much
to interest him as an expert at
Nausou and Labase, and having few
associates of his own nationality,
spent an immense amount of time in
further study of sugar manufacture.
After two years he returned to
Queensland, and again entered the
employ of Mr. Buss, whom he left
to join the firm of Messrs.. Gibson
and Howes, on “Bingara” Plantation,
as chemist in charge of the white
sugar manufacturing department.
Four years after his return from Fiji
he was offered the position of mill
manager and chemist on “Penang”
Estate, in that island, and took up
his duties on this plantation, which
comprised about 2,000 acres. His ser-
vices were next sought by the British
Columbia Sugar Refining Company,
who by purchasing the Fiji Sugar
Company’s estate had established
very large interests in Fiji. His con-
nection with this company extended
over three and a half years, when,
being desirous of seeing his old home
and relatives, he resigned his posi-
tion, this decision being received by
his employers with great regx-et.
After his return to Queensland he
took a few months’ holiday, and in
1909 resumed work, this time as
supervising chemist at the Moreton
Central Sugar Mill, Nambour. His
methods here obtained the unquali-
fied approval of the directors, who
signified their satisfaction by
appointing him to full control of
the mills, and in the following year
made him general manager of the
company, which position he still
retains. Mr. Greathead has become
deservedly popular in the neighbour-
hood, and always holds himself
ready to assist by his expert

GEORGE PITMAN, fruitg rower,

the late Charles Pitman, a native of
Somersetshire, England, who came
with his father, the late W. Pitman,
to Queensland, and started in the
butchering business at Brisbane,
Charles droving stock to the metro-
polis for his father from the various
stations where purchases were made.
Subsequently Charles purchased a
holding at Ipswich, and at a later
date took over a tannery in partner-
ship with a Mr. Fulcher, where they
conducted business successfully for
some time. Twenty years of farm-
ing on the Darling Downs followed,
the 480 acres of open country which
he took up having to be fenced be-
fore operations could be commenced.

Eventually, however, great success
crowned their efforts, and Mr,
Charles Pitman became widely
known as a prosperous wool pro-
ducer and lucerne grower, hundreds
of acres in the vicinity of Gatton and
Forest Hill being sown with seed,
while at the various agricultural
shows sheep raised by him obtained
most favourable recognition from
the judges. His father died as the
result of an accident in 1893,
Charles Pitman surviving until
1899. The subject of this notice,
Mr. George Pitman, was born at
Brisbane in the year 1875, and as a
child of four years was taken by his
parents to the Downs, where he
received his education at a school
at Kincora, starting work on his
father’s estate at 14. Two years
later, in conjunction with his
brother, he began independent
operations on a selection which they
leased at Springs! de. After two
years, during which a portion of
RESIDENCE (SHOWING PINEAPPLES).
this holding was cleared by the
young settlers, he relinquished the
joint enterprise, and took over on
lease a holding of 160 acres in the
same district. Afterwards this place
was purchased by his father, and
was worked by Mr. George Pitman
for about three years, when he sold
his interest, and returning to the old
parental homestead carried on
mixed farming there for about the
same period. The occurrence of a
big drought compelled him to sell
out, and, seeking fresh fields for his
energies, he purchased a partnership
in an aerated water business at
Ipswich, subsequently, after con-
tinning this enterprise for two years,
turning his attention to dairy-
farming. At a later period he was
engaged for a time in the aerated
water manufacture at Nambour, but
foreseeing the golden prospects
ahead of the pineapple industry in
that district, embraced the oppor-
tunity of purchasing 40 acres of land
from the "Currie” Estate for the
purpose of starting a pine planta-
tion. The ground was still in its
natural state, being covered with
timber and scrub, and Mr. Pitman’s
first act was to clear seven acres of
land, upon which he planted pine-
apples and bananas, the harvest
after three years’ work yielding
1,500 cases of pines. Since that
date he has prepared the remainder
of the area for cultivation, and has
also purchased another block of 30
acres at Palmwoods, where he has
felled the timber and is developing
the land for grazing pastures. He

to the movement which resulted in
the large fruit display in the non-
competitive section at the National
Show, 1915, on which occasion
between 40 and 50 tone of fruit were
placed on view, Mr. Pitman acting
as manager of the exhibit. He mar-

WILLIAM J. SMITH, Maple-
ton, Nambour, president of the
Queensland Fruitgrowers’ Indus-
trial Trading Society, 1914, was
born near Malvern, Worcester-
shire, England, in 1868, and being
taken to America at an early age
received his primary education in
the New World. Subsequently, at
10 years of age he returned to
England, and continued his studies
for a couple of years, when a further
flight was made by the family to
Australia. Upon arrival in Queens-
land in August, 1880, Mr. Smith’s
parents formed a home at Red-
land Bay, about 25 miles south of
Brisbane, a district devoted almost

exclusively to the growing of sugar-
cane. In September, 1890, with his
younger brother he took a trip to
the Blackall Ranges, with a view to
selecting land suitable for banana
cultivation, their route being by rail
to Caboolture, and thence by coach
to Nambour, then known as Petrie
Creek. As a result of their visit of
inspection the brothers became the

first settlers of the now thriving
orchard district of Mapleton, lying
about seven miles in a westerly direc-
tion from Nambour, at an altitude
of 1,300 feet above sea level, and
right at the top of the range. At
the present time a coach plies daily
between Mapleton and the railway
town of Nambour, but at that
primitive era there were no roads in
the district, and the first act of the
enterprising brothers was to cut a
track over which to carry their
stores and tools from the railway
terminus to their selections. These
holdings comprised 160 acres each,
and the rich, red soil being covered
with a dense growth of tangled scrub
a great deal of solid “graft” was
necessary before sufficient clearing
could be made to provide even a
pasture paddock for a horse; con-
sequently every week a trip on foot
had to be made to the township,
from which the youthful pioneers
would return loaded’with supplies,
implements, and even small articles
of furniture for the two-roomed
slab “humpy” which they had erected
as a temporary shelter. The work of
clearing went on apace, and in 1891
already grass paddocks showed a
promising appearance, whilst in
addition a large area had been
planted with bananas, and an oran-
gery of 50 trees occupied a further
space. Whilst waiting for the pro-
ducts to mature and bring in returns
Mr. Smith took contracts for clear-
ing the public roads, and gave half
his time to this work until the
bananas came into bearing, when he
was faced with the difficulty of
transporting the fruit to the railway,
which had been brought up as far
as Nambour at the end of 1891. The
roads were only fit for bridle traffic,
and as a result teams of four or five
horses were employed, each horse
being capable of bearing two cases of
bananas, with about 30 dozen
bananas to the case. After about
three years the roads were
sufficiently improved to
allow of vehicles being
used, and with a spring
cart or waggon a couple
of horses could draw thirty
cases in one trip. In the
early days of the advent
of Mr. Smith and his
brother to the district their
nearest neighbours were
four miles distant, but the
success of their plantations
being assured other settlers
began to take up the sur-
rounding land, and citrus
orchards sprang up on
every side, until now
Mapleton is regarded as
one of the leading centres
of this industry in the
State, Mr. Smith alone
having 1,000 trees in
full bearing. The six-
roomed house which in time replaced
the slab hut has in its turn given
way to a superior 10-roomed resi-
dence, built about two years ago,

wife and family enjoy all the com-
forts brought within the reach of
country centres by modern civiliza-
tion. Mr. Smith is well to the fore
in the various progressive movements
of the neighbourhood, and is a com-
mitteeman in connection with the
recently-opened tramway from
Mapleton to Nambour; president of
the Mapleton Progress Association;
and secretary to the local school
committee. His most distinctive
office, however, is fittingly that of
chairman of the Queensland Fruit-
growers’ Industrial Trading Society,
to which he was appointed in
August, 1914, and which is regarded
as one of the most important
organizations of its kind in the
Commonwealth. He represented
Queensland at the Interstate Con-
ference of Fruitgrowers held in 1909
in Perth, Western Australia, and
takes a keen interest in all matters
connected with the industry. Mr.
Smith married in 1891 Annie,
youngest daughter of Mr. D. J.

The gentleman under review re-
ceived bis early education at the
late R. C. Mitton’s Grammar
School, Adelaide, and at 14 years of
age he was apprenticed to the trade
of an ironfounder, at the conclusion
of his indentures obtaining the posi-
tion of foreman in the Glenelg Rail-
way Company’s employ. In the con-
struction of that line he was en-
gaged for a considerable time. At a
later date he established himself in
business on his own account in Ade-
laide, and carried on successfully for
about five years. In 1886 he came
to Queensland, and in conjunction
with a partner formed the Bunda-
berg Foundry Company, about 12
years later transferring his activities
to Gympie, where he opened the
present foundry, the supervision of
which has since occupied the whole
of his time and attention. The
foundry, which is now one of the
well-established and most important
industrial institutions in the district,
is up-to-date in character, being
fitted with machinery of the latest
design and capable of turning out
any class of ironwork, its range in-
cluding mining machinery, engineer-
ing work, all manner of agricultural
implements, and motor repairs. The
enterprise serves a very large connec-
tion, being well and favourably
known throughout a wide radius,
and where its manufactures find
their way a prompt extension of
business in that direction results.
Mr. Coombe was married in 1870,
his wife being Frances, daughter of
the late Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Field,
whose marriage was the first to be
celebrated in the old historic
Trinity Church, North Terrace,
Adelaide. Of the four sons and two
daughters born to Mr. Coombe, two
of the former are in partnership
with their father in the foundry busi-
ness. The elder of these, Percy
James Coombe, was born at Bromp-
ton, South Australia, in 1874, and
received his education in the Church
of England Grammar School of that
place.° Outside of his business in-
terests he gives the major share of
his attention to social and sporting
matters in Gympie, where he is well
known among the devotees of out-
door recreation. He is married and
has two sons. The other partner,

in Adelaide in 1882, and at the
close of his education served
his apprenticeship to the ironmong-
ery trade, at a subsequent period

RICHARDSON NICHOLS, of
Bli Bli, near Nambour, is a son of
the late Thomas Nichols, descendant
of a Norfolk family of farmers, who
before his departure from the land
of his birth, filled the position of
overseer on an estate of 500 acres
owned by a Mr. Howard. Mr.
Thomas Nichols married Elizabeth,
daughter of Mr. Eli Fulcher, of
Wingfarniug, Norfolk, and with his
wife and family sailed for Australia
by the “Alfred,” landing at Bris-
bane on September 25, 1855, after a
trip occupying 90 days. The pas-
sengers disembarked at the William
Street Wharf, the future site of the
old emigrant barracks, which were
not then erected, and the family
lodged on the spot where the present
Treasury Buildings now stand. Mr.
Nichols and a fellow-passenger, Mr.
Charles Vincent, entered the employ
of Mr. Charles Coxon, on what was
then known as the “Garden of
Brisbane,” a property of 100 acres,
on the Brisbane River, now partly
occupied by the American Meat
Company’s works. After remaining
in this employ for two years Mr.
Nichols purchased from the New
South Wales Government a small
farm of six acres, at a place called
Doughboy, now known as Emmet,


where he continued for 22 years,
when his sons being grown up and
desiring more scope for their efforts,
he accompanied them to Queensland,
and spent the remaining years of his
life with his children, attaining the
ripe old age of 91 years before pass-
ing the Great Divide. The late Mr.
Nichols was greatly esteemed and
respected by all who knew him, and
has bequeathed to his successors a
worthy name, which is held in all
honour throughout the district where
he spent the closing years of his life.
Mr. Richardson Nichols, the subject
of this notice, was born in Norfolk,
England, and attended a private
school at Pullham until 11 years of
age, when he came with his parents
to Brisbane, and finished his educa-
tion under his mother’s tuition. He
was then apprenticed for a term of
seven years to the boot trade in
Brisbane, but tiring of this occupa-
tion returned to his father, who
utilized the boy’s services in his
gardening work for a number of
years. Eventually with his brother
he selected country in the Maroochy
district, which they claim to have
first opened up, and each settling on
his own selection started operations
on independent lines. Mr. Richard-
son Nichols cleared three acres the
first year, and planted maize, which
he shipped by cutter to the Brisbane
market. The following season he
placed 10 acres under maize and
bananas, and each succeeding year

receiving a small sugar mill plant
which he had ordered, and delivery of
which had been faithfully promised,
Mr. Nichols placed a large area of
ground under sugarcane, but no
machinery coming to hand he was
compelled to burn the cane, sacri-
ficing as much as 500 tons in this
way in one season alone. Following
these unfortunate experiences, Mr.
Nichols planted the area with
cargo completely ruined. Persever-
ing in his efforts, he at length had
the satisfaction of witnessing the
erection of the Moreton Central
Mill by the Government, and on the
completion of this enterprise he was
approached by the directors and
specially requested to grow cane for
the mill. The management also
offered to lay tramlines for the con-
venience of settlers undertaking the
cultivation of cane, provided the
latter would supply timber for
bridges and clear a track for the
line, which eventually was carried
through Mr. Nichols’ property. He
now has about 40 acres under sugar-
cane, his record crop having been
taken from 40 acres, on which occa-
sion he cut 60 tons to the acre, and
so fine is the quality of this Malabar
cane that photographs have been
sent to different parts of the world
by the Queensland Government to
illustrate the great possibilities of
the industry in the Northern State
of the Commonwealth. Mr. Nichols
also engages in dairying and fruit-
growing on a fairly extensive scale,
and has lately improved his property
by the erection of a fine residence.
He is a foundation member of the
Maroochy Divisional Board Council,
from which he afterwards resigned
on account of pressure of private
work; and has filled the position of

THOMAS PIDD, canegrower,
Bli Bli Road, Nambour, is a native
of Queensland, having been born at
West End, Brisbane, in the year
1857. His father, the late William
MR. WILLIAM PIDD.
Pidd, sprang from a family of agri-
culturists in Lincolnshire, England,
where he also tilled the soil until
his departure from the land of his
birth for Australian shores. At the
age of 25, with his wife and two
children he took passage by a sailing
vessel bound for the land of the
Southern Cross, and arrived at
Brisbane after a voyage lasting
three months. Almost immediately
Mr. Pidd entered the employ of the
Government, becoming engaged in
road construction down the south
coast, and after continuing this work
for a considerable time he visited
Pimpama Island, where he was so
favourably impressed with the
ccc2
general aspect of the country that he
took up a selection of 260 acres
suitable for mixed farming purposes.
After building a home with timber
cut on the selection he cleared the
land, and eventually saw his own
fields of cane and corn flourishing as
a result of his enterprise and
industry. He also gave some atten-
tion to the rearing of cattle, and
made dairying a profitable branch
of his operations. After remaining
here for about 25 years, Mr. Pidd
sold the farm and entered upon
hotelkeeping pursuits, after about
seven years removing to Benowa, a
small township on the Nerang River,
where he conducted a small store and
the local post-office for a few years.
He then removed to Southport,
where he resided until the time of
his death in January, 1915. Mr.
Thomas Pidd, the third son of his
parents, grew up on Pimpama
Island, where he suffered from the
disabilities experienced by most of
the early settlers’ children on
account of the lack of educational
advantages. When he was 12 years
of age his father donated a piece of
land for the purpose of building a
school, but as the son of a pioneer
family, already his help was needed
on the farm, where clearing the
paddocks for grassing and cropping
took many long months of hard
labour. At 25 years of age he
started work on the “Fairymead”
sugar mill, owned by Mr. Young, at
Bundaberg, where he put in six
months, after which he returned to
the old homestead on Pimpama
Island. In the following season he
went back to the sugai plantation,
and subsequently undertook to clear
the land toi a canegiowing pio-
position at Nerang Creek, near
Southport, where many of the farmers
were beginning to grow cane as a
result of the erection of a sugar mill
by the Government for the benefit
of small planters. Having proved
MR. THOMAS PIDD.
his capacity by two or three months’
work, Mr. Pidd was appointed
manager of the estate, which was
called “Rushton,” and after holding
this appointment for five years,
leased the property and carried on
operations there for seven years,
making a fair success of his venture.
Wishing to acquire a holding in his
own right he came to Nambour, and
purchased his present estate, known
as “The Palms,” Petrie Creek, com-
prising 115 acres, and well suited
both to the growing of cane and for
dairying purposes. Very little pre-
paratory work had been done on this
holding, which was covered with
standing timber, logs, and stumps,
and much hard work was necessary
before the first area could be planted
with cane. Eventually, however, all
the initial difficulties were sur-
mounted, and Mr. Pidd now has a
most flourishing plantation extend-
ing over about 40 acres, and pre-
senting every evidence of skilled
care and management. The home-
stead is situated on a pretty rise,
and forms a picturesque feature
among the beautiful hills surround-
ing it, the flower and vegetable
gardens, together with the orchard
area, all adding their quota to the
scene. Mr. Pidd married Mary
Jane, daughter of Mr. John Jarvis
Tucker, of Nerang, and has a family
of three daughters.

buildings marking thoroughfares
along which bullock teams slowly
wending their way were no infre-
quent sight. The late Mr. Bofinger
found his way into the country and
secured employment on the property

of a Mr. Farrow, in the vicinity of
Wollongong, where he remained for
about three years. Subsequently he
rented a farm situated some nine
miles distant from that centre,
where he conducted operations on
his own account for five years, at the
end of which period he proceeded to
the Bega district, some 300 miles
from Sydney, on the south coast of
New South Wales. Here he followed
various occupations, for a time being
employed on “Rameruka,” an estate
of 18,000 acres, owned by Sir
Robert Lucas Tooth, Bart., and his
death occurred in this district
at the age of 68 years. The
gentleman under review, Mr. Fred-
erick Bofinger, was born at Wollon-
gong, New South Wales, in 1862,
and received his education at the
local public school. When 12 years
of age he began work on a farm at
Marshallmount, owned by a Mr.
Dowds, and five years later remov-
ing to the Bega district, obtained
work with a Mr. J. M. Black, who
employed him in general farming and
dairying duties. After two years in
this connection he accompanied his
parents to “Kameruka” Station,
where he assisted with the dairying
operations, and after the departure
of Mr. and Mrs. Bofinger from the
station was retained in the capacity
of general hand in farm and orchard
work. During the 25 years that he
spent at “Kameruka” Mr. Bofinger
married, and his four children were
all born on the property. His
responsibilities as a parent deter-
mined him to accept any opportunity
of bettering his condition, which
came in the shape of an offer from
Colonel Jackson, a resident of Bega
district, who had taken up 560
acres at Obi Obi, in Queensland,
and requiring a manager suggested
that Mr. Bofinger should proceed to
the sister State and work this pro-

finding that the country was excel-
lently adapted for mixed farming,
he carried out his early development
work with this in view, and con-
trolled affairs from the beginning
with such excellent results that the
proposition has proved itself an
eminently payable one. In 1910 he
acquired a partnership in the
concern, and has since
continued to improve the
property with a view to
enlarging the enterprise in
every possible way. Situ-
ated about eight miles
from the township of
Mapleton, “Emmerton” has
a most favourable position
in the midst of a rich
agricultural district, and
the 400 acres which have
already been cleared, fenced,
and grown show a prolific
growth of Rhodes grass and
paspalum. About 177 head
of cattle are grazed on the
pastures, which they share
with a number of horses,
used for the working of the
place, and in addition Mr.
Bofinger gives a good deal of
attention to the rearing of
pigs of the Berkshire and
Yorkshire breeds. He is a shareholder
in the Caboolture Butter Factory,
whither the supplies of cream from
the dairy are sent. Mrs. Bofinger
is a daughter of Mr. Philip Spindler,

EDWARD FARMER, of ‘ Woe-
wood” Station, Port Curtis district,
was born at Worcester, England, in
1867, and is a son of Mr. Samuel
Farmer, late owner of “Hazeldean”
Estate, near Gladstone, and nephew
of Sir William Farmer, founder of
the famous commercial house of
Farmer & Co., Sydney. Mr. Edward
Farmer received his education prim-
arily under private tuition, later
attending public school in the city
of his birth. As a lad of 12 years
he came to Australia and obtained
his first experience under the guid-
ance of his uncle, Mr. Joseph
Farmer, of “Coomoodilly” Station,
Queensland, making good use of his
time during the three years that he
remained upon that property. Hav-
ing become proficient in the hand-
ling of stock and other pastoral
operations, he took up droving for
a time, and in various other ways
fitted himself in a thorough-going
manner for a position of technical
responsibility and trust. This he
attained to in the early eighties, and
after successfully proving his capac-
ity to conduct a cattle and horse-
raising venture on behalf of his
parent, in 1890 he took up on his
own account, under the 1884 Lands
Act, a grazing farm now well-known
as ‘ ‘Voewood.” This property, con-
sisting at the present time of 20,000
acres, in the first instance was a
modest holding of 6,000 acres of
country, undulating, and of granite
formation, which was one of the sub-
divisions of the old “Calliope” run.
It was practically without water,
but the ringbarking of the timber

produced the result so frequently
noted in formerly densely-wooded
districts of liberating natural sup-
plies and of promoting the flow of
surface water where previously
creeks were conspicuous by their
absence. Among the permanent
streams which run through the pro-
perty, the most reliable are Oakey,
Toms, Doubtful, and Spring Creeks,
which together have proved equal to
the saving of the situation in times
of drought. The whole of the
original block, with the additional
area secured by subsequent purchase,
is well fenced and subdivided, the
15 paddocks carrying about 2,000
head of cattle and 150 horses.
Whilst making “Voewood” his
home, Mr. Farmer in 1916 increased
his landed possessions by the acquire-
ment of “Banana” Station, then in
the hands of Mr. A. H. Stirrat.
This transaction gave into his charge
the administration of 60 square
miles of country, consisting of undu-
lating tracts of open forest, varied
by black soil plains, the whole hav-
ing a carrying capacity of 3,000 to
4,000 head of cattle. Here wells
have been sunk and fitted with
windmills and Fuller and Johnston
engines for pumping purposes, and
these, together with a couple of
large dams, make the water supply
practically assured. At the time of
purchase the place was stocked with
over 1,950 head of mixed cattle,- and
was used by Mr. Farmer principally
as a fattening station, the number
of the herd rapidly increasing to its
present number, viz., 2,500. The
owner is, however, also giving his
attention to the breeding of Here-
fords, the type chosen for the “Voe-
wood” stud being the McConnell
and Archer strain, so well and
favourably known among Australian
breeders. In 1916 Mr. Farmer pur-
chased several high-class Hereford
bulls, and with this infusion of new
blood is achieving great success in
his enterprise. He is an enthusiastic
sportsman and horsebreeder, and in
his time owned “Young Tim,” by
“Tim Whiffler” (imp.); “Rhyn-
darra,” by “Respite,” by “Yatten-
don”; “Loriraer,” by “July,” full
brother to “Sir Modred”; “Slum-
ber,” by “Far Niente” (imp.), from
“Queen Agnes”; and “Capture,”
by “Antares,” from “Bronze
Cap.” By these sires he has bred
many useful and high-class horses,
several of which he has raced with
success. Mr. Farmer interests him-
self in the public welfare of the dis-
trict, and has been a member of
the Calliope Shire Council for a
lengthy period. In 1913 he visited
his native land, and made a 12
months’ tour of the United King-
dom, in the course of which he re-
newed mauy old acquaintances, and
revived his recollection of the beauty
spots of the British Isles. He re-
turned to Australia in 1914, prior to
the outbreak of the war. In 1905 Mr.
Farmer married Nora, daughter of
Mr. W. Goldsmith, of Ramsay, Isle
of Man, by whom he has three
daughters.

HERMAN KUCH, of Obi Obi,
via Nambour, was born in the Pro-
vince of Meiningen, Germany, in the
year 1862, his native place being
Saohon, a suburb of Obermassfeld,
MR. HERBERT KUCH.
where his father, the late Heinrich
Kuch, a highly-respected citizen,
engaged in farming pursuits, and
filled the office of burgomaster for
12 years. The gentleman under
review began his education at the
public school in Obermassfeld at six
years of age, and attended this
he travelled through Bavaria,
Switzerland, and Italy, returning
via France and the northern States
of Germany, working at his trade,
and finding much to interest him in
the course of his journeys. Desiring
to start in business on his own
account, he purchased the connec-
tion and plant of his late employer,
Mr. Heinrich Barenburg, and
settled at Oderstadt, close to Bremen,
in the Kingdom of Hanover, where
he carried on for about two years.
At the end of this period Mr. Kuch
sailed for Australia, landing at
Sydney, which city he left for Bris-
bane in February, 1888. To familiar-
ize himself with local conditions, he
applied himself to the work of
clearing a block of land at Welling-
ton Point for a farmer of that
neighbourhood, and subsequently was
employed by a Mr. James Baron, of
the same district as a general farm
hand, in which capacity he became
acquainted with dairying occupa-
tions, ploughing, and other occupa-
tions of a similar nature. At a later
date he obtained a position as
enginedriver in the employ of Messrs.
McGhie & Luya, timber merchants,
of Brisbane, and also did a consider-
able amount of engineering work in
this connection, which extended over
12 months. His next venture was
the purchase of an interest in the
Sillett & Kuch. Upon the dissolu-
tion of the latter partnership, which
existed for a few years, Mr. Kuch
secured an appointment upon “Ter-
rica” Station, some 300-odd miles

proving especially useful. Return-

undertaking business formerly carried
on by Messrs. Aldington & Sillett, at
Petrie’s Bight, which, upon the
retirement of the former gentleman,
became known under the title of
the great flood of that year, and
after taking a few months’ holiday
was invited by a friend, Mr. Otto
Suers, to inspect his selection at Obi
Obi, with the result that he was so


favourably impressed with the dis-
trict that he decided to take up a
holding on his own account. This
selection was christened “Ferndale”
by his wife, by reason of the masses
of fern which grew wild in the
locality. It was also heavily tim-
bered, and the present highly-
improved condition of the 160-acre
farm of which Mr. Kuch has made
so successful a proposition represents
many years of steady and strenuous
toil. In the first place building a
slab "humpy” for the occupation of
the family, he afterwards erected
the present homestead from timber
cut and pit-sawed on the property,
and after this work was completed
cleared five acres of timber and
orange trees, planted many years
ago, are still a picture of health and
beauty. Corn is grown on the slopes,
and from the higher portion of the
estate the green stretches of Rhodes
grass and paspalum form a very
pretty sight. A tributary of the
Mary River, called the Obi Obi
Creek by the blacks, who were
numerous at the time of Mr. Kuch’s
advent, winds round the foot of the
hilly ground, and it is the intention
of Mr. Kuch very shortly to inaugu-
rate an irrigation scheme, by means
of which every portion of the farm
will be served. In course of time
Mr. Kuch established his reputation
as a successful breeder of cattle and
horses, raising his own herd of
supervision of the farm, and also
does his share in the public activities
of the district. He was the first
Justice of the Peace in the neigh-
bourhood ; and also acted as
postmaster for a time before the
appointment of a regular officer in
that capacity. A member of the
Farmers' Union, he aided the
advancement in general directions
by presiding over the Obi Obi Pro-
gress Association for five years; and
has also occupied the post of chair-
man of the local school committee;
while all charitable organizations
find in him and his wife ready
support. He was also one of the
founders of the Roslyn Masonic
Lodge at Nambour; and has left his
scrub, and started dairying opera-
tions and the raising of pigs.
Further clearing and subdivision of
the land into conveniently-sized
paddocks followed; while keeping
pace with grazing and stock-breed-
ing, the cultivation of the soil was
carried on. A portion of the estate
boasts exceedingly rich soil, and Mr.
Kuch claims that upon these fertile
flats may be grown products raised
in any other part of Queensland.
For potato-growing they have proved
themselves unequalled, and, indeed,
for root crops of every description,
including arrowroot; while, spite of
the ground being low-lying, the
citrus fruits raised in the orange
orchard are of the finest, and the

in the improvement of prevailing
methods, and being of an inventive
turn of mind has instituted reforms
in the direction of farm implements,
all of which he fashions himself, and
the arrangements of the outbuild-
ings, some of his devices being very
ingenious, are well deserving the
attention of his fellow-farmers. In
1890 he met with an accident, which
deprived him of the use of one leg,
but notwithstanding this great draw-
back, he still continues his active
mark in a permanent manner by
assisting in the erection of the More-
ton Central Sugar Mill, and various
other buildings throughout the dis-
trict. Mr. Kuch married Effie, only
daughter of the late William McGill,
of Coulter, Lanarkshire, Scotland,
a member of the famous clan of
McGills, who for generations past
have occupied the territory adjoin-
ing Lord Lamington’s estate on the
bank of the Clyde, from which
property Mrs. Kuch’s old home was
divided by a rivulet or “burnie.” In
1889 she left the land of her birth
for Australia by the steamer
“Dacca,” which vessel was making
her maiden voyage, and arrived at
Brisbane on Apxdl 1 of the same


year. Mrs. Kuch was married in
1891 on New Year’s Eve, the issue
of the union being one son,
Herbert, who went through a
course of study at the Gympie High
School, having previously distin-
guished himself by being the first
scholar in Obi Obi to pass the pre-
scribed examination for entrance to
this institution.
EDWARD CHARLES LAMB,
of Woombye, North Coast Railway,
is a son of the late Edward William
Lamb who, born in England in 1826,
arrived in Australia at an early age
with his father, Commander John
Lamb, R.N., who founded the firm
of Messrs. Lamb, Parbury & Co.,
Sydney, and subsequently entered
the political arena, becoming a
member of the Legislative Council
of New South Wales. Mr. E. W.
Lamb returned to England to
be educated, and for some years
attended the Royal Naval School.
Upon the conclusion of his scholastic
course he once again set out for
Australia, and upon arrival in New
South Wales became identified with
the above-mentioned firm. After
continuing with the company for a
number of years he entered upon
pastoral pursuits, undertaking the
management of his father’s estate at
Murrumbidgee for several years.
Excellent reports of Queensland
coming to his ears, he joined a Mr.
MR. EDWIN CHARLES LAMB.
Skinner in the purchase of “Dalgan-
gal” Station, on the Burnett River.
Henceforth Mr. Lamb took an
important part in colonial develop-
ment, and may be counted among
the honoured band of early pioneers
to whom the general opening up of
the country for pastoral purposes is
due. Disposing of his interests in
“Dalgangal,” he formed a partner-
ship with Mr. Black, and took up a
large property on the Peak Downs,
known as “Yamala” Station, which
they developed as a sheep and
general grazing proposition. The
late Mr. Lamb became a candidate
for political honours in 1866, and
was returned as representative for
Mitchell District, which seat he held
for some years, very quickly estab-
lishing himself as a prominent figure
in the Legislative Assembly. Sub-
sequently he received the appoint-
ment of Chief Commissioner of
Crown Lands, after holding the port-
folio of Secretary for Public Lands
in the MacKenzie Cabinet from
August 15, 1867, to September 10,
1868. The late gentleman was a
great traveller, and received the
honour of being elected a Fellow of
the Royal Geographical Society. He
resided at Ipswich for some consider-
able time in the early sixties, but
latterly lived in Sydney, where his
demise occurred on October 19, 1910.
The subject of our review, Mr. E. C.
Lamb, was born at Ipswich, Queens-
land, in 1860, and received his
education privately, under direction
of the Rev. D. A. Court, concluding
his scholastic career at Goulburn
and Mittagong, in New South Wales.
Relinquishing his studies, he was
placed by his father under Mr.
Gunn, of Pikedale, for the purpose
of obtaining instruction in pastoral
matters, and upon leaving this tutel-
age proceeded to Evesham, on the
Thomson River, for further experi-
ence in cattle-raising, sheep-breed-
ing, etc. He next joined his father,
and took up 1,000 square miles of
country on the Buchanan River,
Northern Territory, to which he
gave the name of “Alroy Downs.”
For this station a large mob of
breeding cattle was purchased from
“Avington,” in the Barcoo country,
which was overlanded 1,000 miles
by Mr. E. C. Lamb, the trip taking
nearly 12 months. The Messrs. Lamb
were the first to open up the
Buchanan River country, but finan-
cial disaster followed their advent
there in 1893, and the younger man,
who was in charge of affairs, found
it advisable to abandon the enter-
prise, and for a time he was engaged
as manager on various stations
throughout Queensland. Later he
joined his brother-in-law, Mr.
Walter Allen, and Colonel J. W.
Allen in the purchase of “Grosvenor
Downs” and “Kirknie” Stations, in
the Clermont and Clare districts
respectively. Disposing of his interest
MR. EDWARD WILLIAM LAMB.
in these properties he proceeded
to the Northern Territory on a visit
of inspection for Mr. Sidney Kid-
man, the cattle king, his object
being to visit “Creswell Downs”
Station. His impressions of the
place not being sufficiently favour-
able to result in business, Mr. Lamb
returned to Queensland, and pur-
chased a farm at Woombye, where
he is now engaged in the extensive
cultivation of pineapples, oranges,
and other fruits. Mr. Lamb mar-
ried Doris, daughter of Mr. Carl
Harden, of Rockhampton, and has
one son, who is receiving commercial
training in the firm of Messrs.
Brabant & Co., merchants, of
Brisbane.
THOMAS SMITH, orchardist,
Woombye, is a son of the late
Richard Smith, who was born in
Devonshire, at “Furzeberry” Farm,
near Southmolten, on the River
Moule, in the year 1860. His grand-
father, the late Richard Smith,
came from a long line of agricul-
turists in that County, and was the
owner of “Furzeberry” Farm, in
addition to which he leased two
other farms, the aggregate area of
which ran to about 200 acres. He
owned a large herd of cattle, and in
addition was a breeder of sheep,
which brought good prices at the
London markets, their condition
being kept up by hand feeding


during the winter, for which pur-
pose swede turnips, rape, and hay
were extensively cultivated. Mr.
Thomas Smith recalls his father’s
stories of days when he and his

covered up by a snow drift 20 feet
in depth. A large number of hands
were employed on the farm, which
was noted for its manufacture of the
famous Devonshire cheese and
butter, and also for its annual brew
of the cider for which the County is
celebrated, as much as 60 hogsheads
being produced in one season solely
for private consumption. The sub-
ject of this notice attended a public
school until 13 years of age, when
he was sent to a boarding school for
a year. Upon the conclusion of his
studies he was apprenticed to the
drapery trade for five years with the
firm of John White, of South
Molten, during which period he
received no remuneration for his
services. At nineteen years he
had a further term of experience
with the wholesale drapers, Messrs.
Cook & Son, of London, who allowed
his a salary of £2O a year, with
living expenses for the first few
months, ultimately increasing this
figure to £4O per annum. For health
reasons, in 1882 he decided to visit
Australia, and leaving Plymouth by
the “Duke of Buckingham,’ he spent
eight weeks on the ocean, during
which period the ship ran short of
coal, and by order of the captain a
number of the cabins were destroyed
and the timber used for fuel. After
visiting his relatives, who were settled
on the Hunter River, New South
Wales, Mr. Smith returned to Bris-
bane, where he had first disem-
barked, and joined the business staff
of Messrs. Stewart & Hemmant,
wholesale drapers of that city. After
remaining in this employ for two
years the possibilities of the pine-
apple industry attracted his atten-
tion, and with an eye to the future
he relinquished his connection with
commercial pursuits and proceeded
to select a suitable holding upon
which to begin operations. This he
found at Zillmere, then known as
the Zillman Waterholes, and purchas-
ing an unimproved block of 20 acres
he fenced and cleared it, and by
degrees planted the whole area with
pineapples. He also grew cucumbers
and tomatoes between the rows of
pines, and sent thousands of cases of
these products to Sydney and Mel-
bourne, where they found a ready
market with the leading merchants.
After a period of about 16 years
Mr. Smith was offered a good price
for this farm, and having completed
the sale inspected various parts of
the north coast country with a view
to settlement. The good depth and
quality of the soil on his present pro-
perty, together with the excellent
rainfall of the district, 64 inches
being registered within 12 months,
determined his choice, and he
forthwith purchased a selection of 275
acres, still in its virgin state, and
set to work to develop a model pine-
apple plantation. With products
from this plantation Mr. Smith has

Councillor CARL MARTIN
NOTHLING, of “Winehill,” Teu-
toburg, is a son of Mr. Julius
Nothling, a native of Germany, who
held considerable property at Berlin,
which he lost at the time of the war
between Russia and Turkey. In the
year 1880 he came to Queensland by
the merchantman “Runnymede,” he
and his family being the only pas-
sengers on board, and after a rough
trip lasting 90 days landed at Bris-
bane, where a sojourn of about four
months was made. At the end of
this period Mr. Nothling, sen.,
purchased about 20 acres of land
near Beenleigh, and started the
manufacture of bricks, employing
hand labour in this industry, of
which he was the pioneer for the
district. Success attended his efforts,
and in 1884 he sent an exhibit of
bricks to the Intercolonial Exhibi-
tion held in that year in London,
for which he secured first prize and
a diploma. He also engaged in
winemaking on a modest scale. Mr.
Nothling eventually retired from
active business life, and came to
reside with his sons at Teutoburg.
He married Miss Emilie Hilde-
brandt, of Berlin, Germany, by
whom he had issue six sons and two
daughters. The subject of this
notice, Mr. C. M. Nothling, was
born at Berlin in 1863, and received
his education at a private school,
subsequently serving his articles in
the office of an architect. Before his

indentures had expired Mr. Ndth-
ling, sen., decided to bring his
family to Australia, and after sett-
ling at Beenleigh, Mr. C. M. Noth-
ling attended a night school, where
he mastered the English tongue. In
1887 he took up land in the Blackall
Ranges, but this proving unsuitable
he secured 160 acres at Teutoburg,

drove from the Logan district over
roads good, indifferent, and very
bad, a rough bullock track, in wet
weather three feet under mud, being
the only defined route from Lands-
borough to the vicinity of his selec-
tion, while the final six miles lay
through unbroken scrub, and took
him nearly a day to negotiate.
Having some knowledge of the
building trade, he assisted a Mr.
Rabehl in the erection of a slab hut,
and shared this shelter whilst
engaged in the preliminary work of
felling timber on his holding. After
clearing eight acres, he built a two-
roomed house, and having brought
his young wife and child to the
selection, immediately gave his atten-
tion to turning his holding to the
best account. Having planted one
and a half acres with about 20 varie-
ties of vines, he planted couch and
buffalo grass to make pasture land
for a horse, which he needed for
carrying provisions from Lands-
borough to his homestead. Mr.
Nothling was a man of extraordin-
ary physical strength, and on one
occasion carried 200 lbs. of flour and
70 lbs of sugar respectively for fully
half a mile. Whilst his vines and
grass were growing he occupied
himself in clearing other portions of
his lease, and pit-sawing a lot of
cedar, sent it to Brisbane to be sold.
Fencing claimed a considerable
amount of time, and in the pad-
docks thus enclosed he pastured a
few cows; while in addition to these
numerous occupations, regular em-
ployment was always open to him at
the Moreton Central Sugar Works,
where in the slack season he under-
took the repairing of the boilers.
By the close of 10 years he had
accomplished the clearing of 100
acres, and the dairying industry
then being in full swing, he started
a shorthorn herd, which he after-
wards crossed with Holsteins, and
finally returned to the original
breed, the present number of short-
horns on the estate being over 80.
Mr. Nothling also breeds horses for
his own use, with a small surplus for
the market. The winemaking depart-
ment has flourished, and a very ready
sale for this product has been
obtained, a number of trophies
testifying to the excellence of the
“Winehill” vintage. Almost every-
thing necessary to the liberal
providing of a household is pro-
duced on the farm, from which
also were obtained most of the
materials used for building the
handsome homestead, where the
tasteful furnishings, even to the
picture-frames, are of Mr. Noth-
ling’s own manufacture. He is
prominent in the public life of the
district, being a director of the
Maleny Butter Factory; councillor
of Landsborough Shire; a Justice of
the Peace; presiding officer for the
Commonwealth and State Govern-
ments; Secretary of the School of
Arts; and chairman of the School
committee; elder of the German

in the country, and finishing his
studies at the age of 12, proceeded
to his father’s selection at Flaxton,
which he reached by horseback,
taking two days to do the trip. In

mentioned district in 1875, and
received his education at the North
Pine State School. Subsequently he
was engaged in the blacksmithing
trade at Strathpine for nine years,
but in 1896, business being slack,
he turned his atttention to dairying,
accompanying the late John Mahon,
who was travelling through the dis-
trict as Government Dairy Instruc-
tor, for six months. After Gatton
Agricultural College was established
he obtained an appointment to
manage a cheese factory at Laidley,
two years later transferring his
services to Brisbane, receiving and
grading the cream at a butter fac-
tory owned by the same company.
In 1898 he secured the management
of the butter factory at Tiaro, near
Maryborough, and at the time of
the inauguration of the export trade
with England, when a prize of
£l5 15s. was offered by the Queens-
land Government to stimulate the
butter industry in the State, he
was fortunate in winning the
premier award. In 1902 he returned
to blacksmithing in partnership with
his brother at Terrors Creek, and in
the following year took up 152 acres
of land at Maleny, in the Blackall
Ranges, which property is still
being carried on by his two brothers.
Shortly after his arrival in this
district the idea of a butter factory
was mooted, and after holding the
position of provisional director for
a time, Mr. Skerman was requested
to take the management of the fac-
tory, beginning his duties in
December, 1904. For 12 months he
carried on the work single-handed,
also acting as his own secretary, and
sleeping on the premises, at this
period there being only one residence
on the present township site. As
the enterprise grew he employed
labour, and at the end of 1905 the
company established a co-opera-
tive general store at the settlement,
which Mr. Skerman managed in
conjunction with the butter factory
for a time with great success. By
degrees the expansion of the business
rendered it necessary to employ a
separate manager for the store, and
Mr. Skerman was left free to devote
his energies solely to the factory
business, which also was rapidly
increasing. The premises being too
small, in 1908 it was decided to
erect a larger factory, and after visit-
ing the leading establishments of
f the kind in New South Wales, Mr.
Skerman supervised the erection of
the present building, which took
three years to complete on account
of the difficulty in transporting
materials from Landsborough. The
factory stands on a block of land
13 acres in extent, and co£b ,£4,000
to build, over 617 casks of cement
being used in its construction.
Machinery to the value of £4,000
has also been installed, including a
Hornsby suction gas engine of

a compression of 25 tons capacity;

and a new combined “Baltic”
churn and butter-worker. Large
quantities of cream are brought
daily to the factory from the
surrounding farms, and upwards
of 40 tons of butter is the weekly
output. The butter, which is of the
highest quality, having won the
gold medal at the Franco-British
Exhibition, two first awards in
Sydney, and numerous other prizes,
is sent to the Farmers’ Co-operative
Distributing Company,*which in the
summer exports largely to London,
finding ready markets in the
southern States during the winter
season. Two four-horse teams are
regularly employed in taking the
butter to Landsborough, six private
wagons collecting the cream from
the farms of the shareholders, this
factory being the first in Queensland
to adopt the daily delivery, which is
continued for six months in the
year. A large piggery is run
in connection with the factory,
by means of which all waste pro-
ducts are consumed. Mr. Skerman

work of this kind in an honorary
capacity. Mr. Skerman married

JAMES KIRBY, of “Flower-
dale,” Woodford, is a son of the late
John Kirby, who came to Australia
from his native place, Uxbridge, Mid-
dlesex, England, by the sailing-vessel
‘‘Star of England,” in 1866. He
was accompanied by his wife and
children, and among the passengers
were 700 emigrants who had been
engaged by the late Peter Brassey
to work on the construction of the
Ipswich to Toowoomba railway line.
After a trip occupying about five
months the boat arrived at Moreton
Bay, and on landing Mr. Kirby found
employment about the small settle-
ment of Brisbane for a few months.
Subsequently he obtained a position
on “Kilcoy” Station, then, seeing
good prospects in the timber-getting
MR. J. KIRBY.
industry, turned his attention to
cedar-cutting and carting in the
Neurum and Woodford districts.
After carting the timber to Cabool-
ture, it was taken down the river
by raft to Brisbane, and numbers
of timber-getters found lucrative
employment in thus supplying the
timber yards of the metropolis. At
this time there was plenty of scope
for the industry in the district, which
was practically untouched, very few
selectors having taken up holdings
in that part of the country. Mr.
Kirby continued in this occupation
until about the year 1885, when he
removed to Brisbane, where he lived
in retirement until the time of his
death. The subject of this notice, Mr.
Jas. Kirby, was born at Shepparton,
on the Thames, and came as a lad to
Australia with his parents in 1866.
On account of the lack of educational
facilities in the new country, his
schooling was necessarily very limited,
and at an early age he was assisting
in earning the family livelihood by
minding sheep and goats for the late
William Butler, of “Kilcoy” House,
the arrangement being on the share
system, by which young Kirby
received half profits from the sale
of wool and sheep. At the age
of thirteen, after assisting his
father in the timber industry for
a time, he purchased a team
of bullocks and engaged on his
own account in carting cedar logs
for the timber-getters from the
forests to the Mary River, where
they awaited the “freshing” season,
i.e., the time of flood when the
timber would be floated in rafts
down the river and conveyed to
Brisbane, whence it was forwarded
by boat to the several States.
Eventually Mr. Kirby decided to
make a beginning in the direction
of land settlement, and with this end
in view selected a homestead block of
120 acres at 2s. 6d. per acre in the
Neurum district, which he fenced
and cleared, and subsequently re-sold
to Mr. W. Heaton. He then took up
another area of 545 acres at Conan-
dale, and has since augmented this
purchase by the acquisition of con-
siderable property, aggregating in
all about 3,269 acres, in the selec-
tion of which he has displayed
excellent judgment. A large portion
of this land has proved suitable for
farming purposes, but Mr. Kirby
has devoted the major share of his
attention to the timber-getting
industry, in which he is assisted by
different members of his family,
while labour is employed for the
cutting of the timber, which is
obtained both from Government and
private property. The logs are
carted to the Woodford railway
station, and thence dispatched by
train to their metropolitan destina-
tion. In the course of this enter-
prise Mr. Kirby has opened up new
areas of country, and may be said
MR. W. KIRBY.
to have pioneered Bellthorpe, about
12 miles distant from Woodford,
which has come into prominence as
good dairying land. He has erected
a comfortable home, which, enhanced
by the pretty flower garden, of
which Mrs. Kirby makes a hobby,
presents a very attractive appear-
ance. Mr. Kirby interests himself
in the public affairs of the district,
and for the past four years has
occupied a seat on the Caboolture
Shire Council. He married Louisa
Annie, daughter of Mr. Robert
Wilson, of Tamworth, New South
Wales, and of this union there are
five sons and three daughters. In
the year 1917 the second son, Walter,
joined the Australian Imperial
Forces, and left for England with
the 3rd Reinforcements, 42nd Bat-
talion. Subsequently he proceeded
to France and took part in the heavy
fighting at Armentieres. Whilst thus
engaged his leg was badly shattered
by a shell, and after a period in
hospital he was invalided to Aus-
tralia, arriving at his home in 1919.
HENRY CHRISTOPHER
DYER, general merchant, etc.,
Landsborough, is a son of the late
Henry Dyer, a native of East Wood-
hay, near Newbury, Berkshire, Eng-
land, who carried on business as a


butcher in that town, where also the
gentleman under review was born in
the year 1851. After attending
school until 15 years of age, Mr.
Dyer won a scholarship which
entitled him to five years’ free educa-
tion at a grammar school and a
bonus of £25, but relinquished this
opportunity in deference to his
father’s wish that he should serve his
apprenticeship in a large butchering
business. He spent nine months in
this establishment, at the end of this
period being prevailed upon by a
friend to accompany him to London,
where after a few weeks he secured
employment at a distillery at
Milbank, Westminster, where he
remained for about six and a half
years. He then decided for health
reasons to come to Australia, and
having paid his passage obtained the
position of butcher on board the
STORE AND RESIDENCE.
"Ophelia,” subsequently combining
with this post the duties of second
steward, thus securing a first-class
saloon berth and receipt of two
salaries. The boat being quaran-
tined at Peel Island, he undertook
to slaughter the sheep required by
the passengers, and when at the end
of the voyage he received his pay he
found himself in a position to
decline an offer of two years’ employ-
ment as chief steward, made him by
Captain Strickland, his preference
being to remain in Australia. An
attack of fever incapacitated him
for three months, and upon recovery
he took a position at Beenleigh, with
Messrs. Pietzchez & Co., butchers
and genera] storekeepers, who, being
impressed with his aptitude for busi-
ness, five months later started him
on his own account at Waterford,
assisting him financially until he
should be able to establish himself.
In three months he had cleared off
all his liabilities, and continued
successfully for two years, at the
close of which period he became
temporarily crippled with rheumatic
fever. Selling out, he availed him-
self of treatment in Brisbane until
his health returned, when he opened
a butchering business in George
Street, Brisbane, opposite the old
Courier office, but on account of the
keen competition in the city failed
to establish himself, and finally dis-
posed of his interests to Messrs.
Baynes Bros., well-known butchers
of Brisbane. After managing a
branch business of this firm in Vic-
toria Street, Mr. Dyer joined his
brother Matthew, in a trip to Dalby,
where both gentlemen entered the
employ of Mr. Carmody, a butcher
of that town. Upon the extension
of the railway line to Roma, a Mr.
Fountain, who had charge of the
third section, from Dogwood to
Dulacca, built a shop for the Dyer
brothers at Paddy Creek, where they
did a brisk business, killing as many
as 20 bullocks per week. Upon
leaving here Mr. Dyer opened a
business at Miles (in 1879), where
he remained for 11 years, becoming
a dealer in stock on a fairly large
scale, upon one occasion sending as
many as 120 head by special train
to Fenwick & Co., Brisbane. Mak-
ing Miles his headquarters, he
travelled long distances in various
directions to buy up stock, and in
pursuance of this enterprise visited
most of the station properties
within a wide radius, purchasing as
many as four or five hundred cattle
on one trip. Although these trips
were always made for business pur-
poses, Mr. Dyer frequently found
them very enjoyable, and received
most hospitable entertainment at
many of the stations on the Dawson
and Condamine Rivers. At one of
the latter he read the burial service
over the body of the manager, who
was supposed to have been murdered.
It was in this district that the
notorious "Toby,” the outlawed
aboriginal, was practically running
wild and terrorizing all the popula-
tion. Mr. Dyer frequently visited
"Hornet Bank” Station, the scene
of the massacre of the Fraser family
by the blacks. Disposing of his
interests at Miles, he spent a period
at Brisbane, and eventually pur-
chased a business at Bundamba, near
Ipswich, which after six months he
relinquished in favour of a similar
concern at Normanton, in
the Gulf country. This
locality, however, not agree-
ing with his wife’s health,
he returned to Brisbane,
where he lived in retire-
ment for a time, whilst
his children enjoyed the
educational advantages
afforded by city schools.
Tiring of inaction, he
came to Mellum Creek,
now known as Landsbor-
ough, where he took over
a business established in
connection with the con-
struction of the railway
line, and upon the com-
pletion of the latter work
purchased the combined
hotel and storekeeping
business, to which he
has since added sawmilling pur-
suits, and also manages the rail-
way refreshment rooms. He after-
wards sold the hotel, retaining the
general store, butchery, and sawmill,
and carries on an extensive trade
throughout Queensland, New South
Wales, and Victoria, and in
1915 negotiated for a contract
of 250,000 feet of pine and
beech on behalf of the Government.
Mr. Dyer has watched the develop-
ment of the district with great
interest, and being one of the first
half-dozen settlers in the locality is
generally recognized as the Father
of Landsborough. About 18 months
ago he was appointed to the Com-
mission of the Peace. He married
Sarah, daughter of Mr. George
Deeding, of Miles, and has four
daughters and one son.


WILLIAM HAROLD ECROYD,
of “Northcote,” Flaxton, via Palm-
woods, is a son of the late Richard
Ecroyd, who was born in the year
1855 in Lancashire, where the
Ecroyd family carried on a well-
known manufacturing business at
Manchester, Mr. W. H. Ecroyd’s
grandfather being the founder of the
firm which at a later date was con-
verted into a large limited liability
company. Richard Ecroyd, after
learning his trade in this house,
launched out for himself, following
in the footsteps of his fathers by
building a mill for the manufacture
of worsted goods, serges, etc., at
Charlestown, near Bradford, in
Yorkshire. Having disposed of this
business, he entered the employ of a
manufacturing firm at Bradford as
designer, and at a later date started
again in business as manufacturing
agent in the same town. Richard
Ecroyd died at Southport, Lanca-
shire, in 1906, leaving a widow
(Emily, daughter of Mr. Wood-
head, of the same County), three
sons and seven daughters. The sub-
ject of this notice, Mr. William
Harold Ecroyd, was born at Colne,
Lancashire, in 1879, and received
his education at Ilkley College, in
Yorkshire. At 14, having displayed a
taste for floriculture, he spent a brief
period at a nursery garden, where
he gained a slight insight into the
trade, leaving there to engage in the
farming industry, under the tuition
in the employ of a resident of that
district, and after filling various
other positions in different parts of
the country, volunteered for service
in the Boer War in South Africa.
MR. WILLIAM HAROLD ECROYD.
Being disqualified on account of
dental trouble, he decided to come
to Australia, and accordingly left
in March, 1900, by the steamboat
“Cuzco,” and landing at Sydney,
continued his voyage to Brisbane by
the “Aramac” a little later. Mr.
Ecroyd began work on the farm
of a Mr. Dixon at Maleuy, where
he remained for a few months,
Running Creek, Kilkevan, 36 miles
from Gympie, he had his first taste
of work on the mines as a trucker,
and when operations were abandoned
here consequent on the drought,
with two mates and a packhorse he
travelled to Mount Usher, a mining
town situated about 17 miles from
Rockhampton, the trip occupying
six weeks. Here he took contracts in
timber-getting for the mines, but
eventually returned to agricultural
pursuits in the employ of a farmer
on the central line, and in 1902
while cutting timber at Mount
Morgan met with an accident, as a
result of which he was confined to
the Mount Morgan Hospital for a
few weeks. Returning overland to
Brisbane after this misadventure,
Mr. Ecroyd decided to settle down
to farming enterprise on his own
account, and having made inspection
of various properties his choice fell
on the homestead holding “North-
cote,” where he now resides. This
property, which is situated at Flax-
ton, on the main road between
Palmwoods and Mapleton, was par-
tially improved, about two acres of
land being cleared and planted with
orange trees. Since taking posses-
sion Mr. Ecroyd has completed
clearing operations over the whole of
the block, and now has about seven
acres under cultivation, while it is
his intention eventually to place the
entire area under fruit trees, his

he obtained a position with Mr.

September, 1909, Amelia Barcroft,
daughter of Mr. Thompson Varley,
of Bury, England.


CHARLES HENRY BUNDY,
orchardist, of “Llandilo,” Mont-
ville, is the second son of the late
Arthur James Bundy, who was a
native of Bedford, England, and
belonged to a family which followed
the time-honoured profession of
landscape gardeners. In Australia
that profession is confined to the few
who lay out public gardens, but in
the Old Country the call of
landscape gardeners is very wide,
and in Mr. A. J. Bundy’s day the
profession was highly lucrative. He
designed practically all the principal
gardens, public and private, in
Bedford, and his reputation was so
good that he received commissions
from many other parts of England.
In 1858 he married Grace Frances,
the daughter of the late George
Tracey, by whom he had two sons.
After his death, which occurred in
1860, his widow emigrated to Aus-
tralia, taking with her the two boys;
but not until 1864 did she come to
Brisbane. She was accompanied by
a brother, Mr. Francis Tracey, and
her sister, and the latter’s husband,
Mr. John Wykes. The party came
in the sailing clipper “The Light of
the Age,” a vessel whose name is
of the islands in the bay, and their
passengers and cargo were lightered
up to Brisbane. For two years
after her arrival in Brisbane Mrs.
Bundy worked to support herself
MR. CHARLES HENRY BUNDY.
and her two bairns, and in 1865 she
married Mr. G. A. Mills, formerly
of Cornwall, England, who had
followed the work of shepherding on
one of the large stations in the dis-
trict. After varied experiences in
other station occupations, Mr. Mills
finally returned to Brisbane, where
he joined the staff of the Customs
Department, then a very important
sub-department of the State Trea-
sury. For upwards of a score of
years he remained in that depart-
ment, rising to the responsible
position of senior locker, but then
he decided to settle on the land.
With that object in view he took up
a considerable area of agricultural
and pasture land at Montville, and
in the course of the next eight years
he converted it into' freehold pro-
perty, which he sold at a very good
figure. In 1890 Mr. Mills returned
to his family at Indooroopilly, where
they are still living in the quiet
enjoyment of their peaceful wester-
ing days. The aged and highly-
respected couple have a surviving
family of one son and three
daughters. The presentation which
is mentioned in the address here
reproduced, has been in the family
for over a century. The wording of
the address is as follows : —“Lloyds,

Gazette of the Ist inst. I am, Sir,
Your humble servant, T. Bonar,
Chairman. Mr. John S. Tracey, His
Majesty’s Ship ‘Centaur.’ ” Mr.
John S. Tracey was an uncle of Mrs.
G. A. Mills. Her second son,
Mr. Charles Henry Bundy, was
born at Llandilo, Wales, close to
Swansea, in 1861. He was a posthu-
mous child, not being born until
two months after the death of his
father. On his mother’s side he is
of Welsh descent, and he has marked
his love of his native place by calling
his own beautiful homestead at
Montville after it. He was educated
at the Normal School, Brisbane,
under the mastership of that late
doyen of all schoolmasters in Queens-
land, Air. J. Rendle, and also at the
State school at Fig Tree Pocket,
Indooroopilly. On leaving school he
was apprenticed to Mr. J. J. Hislop,
of Brisbane, a skilled cabinetmaker
and carpenter. After serving his
apprenticeship he worked at his
trade for many of Brisbane’s leading
firms, in 1889 settling in Gympie.
After leaving Gympie, where he did
well, he joined his step-brother,
Joseph Weatley Mills, who had a
selection of 160 acres at Montville.
Mr. Bundy purchased half the land,
and started what is now one of the
finest orchards in Queensland. His
first clearing was only five acres, on
which he raised strawberries, his
crop being so prolific and profitable
that he was able to wait until his
orange and other citrus fruit trees
began to bear. Thence onward he
continued steadily clearing the land,
and built the fine home that now
adorns it. The house contains eight
airy rooms, and attached to it are
substantial outbuildings and packing
sheds. Mr. Bundy devotes himself
principally to the production of
citrus fruits, all classes of oranges
and lemons, mandarins, and pine-
apples, Washington navels, Sebina,
Jaffa, Valentia, scarlet mandarins,
Seville, Glenretreat, Empress, Tahiti
limes, and many others are grown
by him. He employs three hands,
and for many years his returns
from the orchard have been
very substantial. In 1889 he mar-
ried Mary Ann, daughter of Mr.
John Young, of Kilcoy. She died
in 1898, leaving a daughter and son,
the latter being George Francis
Bundy, selector at Kilcoy. After
four and a half years Mr. Bundy
again married, his wife being Eliza
Ann, daughter of Mr. Samuel
Unwin (whose biography also
appears in this work), the issue of
this union being one son and one

daughter. As one of the earliest
settlers, Mr. Bundy has taken a
lively interest in the affairs of the
district, and especially in the pro-
jected Palmwoods tramway, knowing
that when completed that line will
be of enormous benefit to the dis-
trict. At present a three-horse team
is required to carry a ton and a
quarter of fruit down the Razor
Back Range. Mr. Bundy as secre-
tary of the Montville School Corn-
mittee took a prominent part in the
building of the first school in the
district, and in all matters of interest
to the place he is foremost. George
Tracey Bundy, eldest son of the late
Arthur James Bundy, was born at
South End, near Southampton, in
August, 1859. He received his
education at the Normal School,
Brisbane, and at Fig Tree Pocket
School. Eventually he turned to sea-
faring pursuits for a few years, after-
wards going to the United States of
America, where he now resides with
his family in the town of Brooklyn.


HERBERT VICTOR FIELD-
ING, “Clitheroe,” Mount Buderim,
is a son of the late John Fielding,
a native of the town of Clitheroe,
Lancashire, England, who came to
MR. HERBERT VICTOR FIELDING.
Queensland, then known as the
Moreton Bay Settlement, in Febru-
ary, 1849. He arrived by the ship
“Fortitude,” one of Dr. Dunmore
Lang’s emigrant ships, after which
Fortitude Valley is named. Among
his fellow-passengers were folk of
such well-known names as Pettigrew,
Cribb, Roper, Trundle, and Keid,
and his future wife was also among
the number, travelling in company
with her brother, William Bulcock.
The young couple were married in
Queensland in the following May.
The land-order system was then in
operation, and Mr. Fielding chose a
promising block at Eagle Farm, a
discontinued, and it was a fairly
frequent occurrence to find pieces of
chain, and even leg-irons, on the
farm. Blacks were numerous, and
Mr. Fielding was wont to relate
interesting stories anent their depre-
dations on his melon patch and
potato beds, in which a shot gun
loaded with rock salt occasionally
played an important part. Mr.
Fielding’s family, which included
three sons and seven daughters,
were all born at Eagle Farm,
About the year 1876, having

previously inspected the Buderim
district, he left this locality, and
settled at Buderim, where he
acquired a forfeited scrub selection
for 15s. per acre. Afterwards he
purchased a farm from Mr. D.
Cogill, and also selected two portions
of land at the foot of the mountain.
In conjunction with Mr. J. C. Dixon
he next started sugar-growing, and
subsequently they erected a mill for
crushing their own cane and that of
attention to fruitgrowing and cane
producing until the year 1890. when
his decease occurred. Mr. Fielding
was buried in the local cemetery, and
upon the death of his wife a few
years later his remains were taken
to Nundah, where he and his faith-
ful helpmeet lie side by side. Mr.
Herbert Victor Fielding was born
at Eagle Farm in 1870, and re-
ceived his education at the Normal
School, Brisbane, under Mr. Kerr,
who encouraged him to qualify for
a teacher. After a few months,
however, finding the work uncon-
genial, he took a position in the
Government Savings Bank, where he
remained for two years. Having a
preference for outdoor life, eventu-
ally he joined his father at Mount
Buderim, where the home property
of 500 acres though valuable was
heavily encumbered. Undeterred,
however, by these difficulties, he
applied himself to the improvement
of the holding, and by continuing
few miles distant from Brisbane,
where he became engaged in farming
on a modest scale. The convict

Brisbane River had not long been

very encouraging feature is the
increase of land values in the
district, which is now coming into
prominence as a pleasure and health
resort, due mainly to the construc-
tion of a good tramway line from
Palmwoods, * and the great natural
beauty of the mountain. Mr. Field-
ing was married to Rose Amelia,
daughter of Mr. William Bines,
mining engineer, of Gympie, and
has three sons.
The late SAMUEL UNWIN
was born at Linton, on the
border of the Counties of Essex
and Cambridge, in the year
1854, being descended from a
family which for many generations
had been identified with farming
pursuits in that locality. Mr. Unwin
lost both parents in his early youth,
and after obtaining the rudiments of
education in his native place, at 14
years of age he proceeded to London,
where he was successful in securing
employment with a firm of East
Indian and Colonial drug brokers,
whose headquarters were at Mincing
Lane. After two years he accepted
by the well-known emigrant
liner “Warren Hastings,” a sailing
vessel which, leaving England early
in March, arrived at Brisbane on
June 19 of the same year, and

during the trip Mr. Unwin occupied
his time by imparting instruction to
famous firm of Sangster & Co., of
Paternoster Row, with the princi-
pals of which he was distantly con-
nected. Mr. Unwin gained his
early experience in local farming
conditions at Boggy Creek, near
Myrtletown, where later he began
operations on his own account. In
1892 for health reasons he removed
to Bald Hills, and purchased 150
acres of land, which he used for
general farming and dairying pur-
poses, a few years afterwards dis-
posing of the property. He next
acquired possession of another estate
at Bald Hills, which he used for
dairying purposes for about nine
years, when he disposed of it, and
purchased another property in the
same district, which in 1914 he sub-
divided and sold, retaining only a
homestead allotment of two acres.
Mr. Unwin was always distin-
guished for his active interest in
public affairs, and appointed a Jus-
tice of the Peace as far back as May,
1888. In 1891 he stood successfully
for the Toombul Divisional Board,
and during the dark days of 1893
served on the Flood Relief Com-
mittee. In February, 1894, he was
a responsible position with the firm
of Alexander Townsend, colonial
drug broker, with whom he remained
for a further two years. In 1864 Mr.
Unwin set sail from Southampton

position of chairman, in which office
he gained the respect of all his
fellow-members for his energy and
ability. Nearly 50 years after his
departure from London Mr. Unwin
revisited his native land, and calling
at the office of his old firm, surprised
Mr. Townsend, sen., by producing
the testimonial he had received from
his hands when leaving the firm.
Mr. Unwin married Mary, daughter
of Mr. Henry Brand, of Essex,
England, who with his family came
to Queensland in the middle fifties,
and his surviving family consists of
three sons and six daughters. The
aged couple celebrated their golden
wedding on Boxing Day (December
26), 1915, which event was made the
occasion of a family re-union. Mr.
Samuel Unwin died on February 8,
1920.
JOSEPH COTTAGE UNWIN,
owner and occupier of the “Silver-
ton” property, in Montville district,
is a native of Queensland, his birth-
place being the locality formerly
known as Myrtletown, now Pin-
kenba, where he first saw the light
on October 27, 1880. He acquired
his education at a public school at
Myrtletown, and at the termination
of his scholastic course became asso-
ciated with his father in farming

pursuits on the parental property,
dairying being the chief branch of
industry then engaging his atten-
tion. Desiring a wider scope for his
energies, and being anxious to secure
something in the way of an indepen-
dent livelihood, he joined forces
with his brother, Mr. David Brand
Unwin, in the purchase of a citrus
orchard, which the two young men
worked together for about a year,
when they accepted an offer to sell
to advantage, and cast about for a
suitable farm-land investment. This
they found in a 200-acre block
situated at Montville, where plenty
of work lay ahead of them in the
shape of clearing and fencing, the
property being totally unimproved.
Putting their shoulders to the wheel
they accomplished an immense
amount of solid “graft” within the
next four years, with the result that
pastures were formed carrying 100
head of dairy cattle, and in addition
a small plantation of pineapples
flourished on the estate. After dis-
solving partnership with his brother,
Mr. J. C. Unwin decided to remain
in the same district, and was success-
ful in securing a block of 78 acres
formerly the property of Mr. Hamil-
ton Muirhead. Here he has engaged
in fruitgrowing, pineapples and
citrus fruits covering about 10 acres
of ground, and of these he has made
a very profitable proposition, send-
ing large consignments to both Mel-
bourne and Sydney, besides those
that find their way to Brisbane and
other parts of Queensland. Mr.
Unwin has his time fully employed
in supervising the clearing and
general improvement operations on
his property.

DAVID BRAND UNWIN, store-

in conjunction with his brother, Mr.
J. C. Unwin, he purchased an
orchard planted with citrus fruits,
and became engaged in horticultural
pursuits for 12 months, at the end
of which period the orchard was sold
at a fair profit. The brothers then
purchased a property of 200 acres
in the same district, which was still
in its virgin state. Clearing, fencing,
and grassing occupied the greater
portion of the following four years,
during which time a dairy herd was
introduced, which rapidly increased
in numbers until it reached 100,
the cream being sent to the Cabool-
ture Butter Factory, in which the
brothers were shareholders. This
property eventually was sold for
£4,300, a big advance on the origi-
nal purchase price, and at this
juncture the connection was dis-
solved, each gentleman deciding to
strike out for himself. Mr. D. B.
Unwin purchased a 60-acre block of
land, and almost immediately after-
wards took a trip to the Old Coun-
try, during his absence the newly-
acquired holding being sold at a
satisfactory price. Upon his return,
after looking round for several
months, he purchased the business
of Mr. H. Smith, who carried on a
general store at Montville, and has
since devoted his attention to the
conduct of this business, which being
the only store in the district, has a
large connection and does a very
brisk trade. Mr. Unwin also acts as
postmaster for the district. He takes
a live interest in local affairs, and is
actively supporting the proposal to
build a tramway between Palmwoods
and Montville, having subscribed to
the fund raised by the residents to
obtain a survey, which reached a sum
of over £3OO during the course of a
single meeting at the Town Hall,
upon which occasion contributions
were invited. Mr. Unwin frequently
expresses his great confidence in the
future of Montville, which being one
of the finest fruit-growing districts in
the State, is well in the van of pro-
gressive settlements. He married
Margaret Dorothy, daughter of Mr.
John Briggs, of Bolton, Lancashire,
but had the misfortune to lose his
wife after two years of wedded life.
FREDERICK WINSTANLEY
THOMPSON, J.P., Montville, was
born at Birkenhead, near Liverpool,
England, in November, 1865. He
attended a local school for some
years, and at the age of 13 was
apprenticed to the building trade
with the firm of Messrs. Brown and
Backhouse, contractors, of Liver-
pool. In 1884 he sailed for Aus-
tralia, landing at Townsville, where
he found employment in his trade,
at a later date commencing as a
builder and contractor in Brisbane.
Subsequently he went to New Zea-
land, where he remained for 12
months. After returning to Queens-
land he erected numerous buildings
in and around Brisbane for private
persons and the Government, also the
Customs House at Rockhampton, and
carried out the lighting of the north-
west channel to Moreton Bay, as well
as drainage works for the Brisbane
Council. He also erected the whole
of the Moreton Central Sugar Mill,
with the exception of the machinery.
MR. FREDERICK W. THOMPSON.
In 1907 Mr. Thompson removed to
Montville, well known for its beauty
spots and as a tourist resort, where
he purchased property and built a
first-class boarding-house containing
25 rooms, the conduct of which is in
the hands of Mrs. Thompson, while
her husband occupies his time with
contracting work. Many attractions
are offered to visitors, where a good
table is amply supplied with home-
grown fruit and vegetables, and all
the comforts of a home from home
efficiently catered for. Mr. Thomp-
son takes considerable interest in
local affairs of public moment, and
acts as secretary to such; while he
is a member of the Duke of Leins-
ter Masonic Lodge, 1.C., and Past
Chief Ranger of the A.O.F. He
married Mary Jane, daughter of the
late Samuel Unwin, whose biography
appears elsewhere in this section,
and has two sons and one daughter.
JOSEPH JAMES THOMAS,
fruitgrower, Montville, is a son of
Mr. William Thomas, a native of
Cornwall, England, where his family
carried on farming pursuits. At the
close of his education Mr. Thomas,
sen., learnt the engineering trade in
Cornwall, and at about 19 years of
age sailed for Australia, where he
first obtained employment at the
Langland Foundry, at Melbourne.
Subsequently he was engaged in
different parts of the island-continent
as engineer in charge of various
important works, carrying out some
very large contracts for the above-
mentioned foundry, and erecting
large mining plants at Ballarat and
Bendigo. On one occasion when
erecting a battery he was unable to
secure iron stampers, and showed
his power of resource by manufac-
turing wooden ones shod with iron,
which made very fair substitutes.
After relinquishing his connection
with the foundry Mr. Thomas was
seized with the “gold fever,” and was
present at several rushes to newly-
discovered diggings throughout Vic-
toria; but not meeting with much
luck, once more returned to engi-
neering work with his former firm,
who sent him to Queensland to erect
machinery on a large pool for
washing wool on the sheep’s back,
this work being on behalf of the late
Sir Joshua Peter Bell, the well-
known squatter and landowner. He
also erected the first quartz-crushing
battery on the Gympie mine, which
led eventually to his resigning his
position with Langlands in order to
take over the management of the
mill and battery, which he retained
for a number of years. Whilst filling
this post he was allowed to carry
on private work in conjunction with
his duties at the mill, and con-
structed the first wire rope to be
used for mining purposes at Gympie.
Upon leaving this town he obtained
employment as engineer to the Yen-
garrie Sugar Refinery, later trans-
ferring his services to the Millaquin
Refinery, owned by the same com-
pany, in whose service he continued
for a number of years. Taking
work again as a mining engineer, he
designed and erected the mining
plant of the Day Dawn Block and
Wyndham Mill, situated about 12
miles from Charters Towers, on the
Burdekin River, after which he
returned to the sugar district of


Bundaberg, carrying on a private
engineering practice which included
work for nearly all the principal
mills in that district. Mr. Thomas
continued active operations until the
age of 76, and although now living
in retirement, he is still often con-
sulted on matters concerning all
classes of engineering work. Mr.
Thomas has a family of four sons
and five daughters. Mr. Joseph
James Thomas was born at Gympie,
and received his education at the
Public School at Bundaberg. At 16
he was taken in hand by his father,
who taught him the engineering
trade, and for nine years he was
associated with all the undertakings
of his parent, becoming very expert
in the profession. At 25 he started
establishment of the orchard indus- ;
try, this branch of operations was
discontinued. The property, which
comprises 162 acres, is devoted
mainly to pineapples and citrus
fruits, about 30 acres now being
under cultivation. Mr. Thomas is
an earnest worker in the public
interest, and is using all his influ-
ence to bring about the proposed
tramway from Palmwoods to Mont-
ville; while he is ever ready to place
his engineering experience at the
disposal of the community in any
scheme, public or private, where it
may be deemed of value. He mar-
ried Margaret, daughter of Mr.
George Harr, of Southport, and has
two sons, both of whom are still
at school.

the year 1875, and received his
primary education under private
tuition, at 10 years of age, removing
with his parents to "Maneroo,” a
property comprising 1,200 square
miles of country devoted to stock
and cattle raising and grazing
purposes. From here he was
sent to the Ipswich Grammar
School until the age of 14,
when he returned to the station
and became absorbed in pastoral
operations in association with his
father, who in the interval had been
engaged in the building up of what
gave every promise of being an
for himself, and after completing
work for various sugar mills, was
appointed engineer to the Bunda-
berg Waterworks, being the first to
receive this appointment, which he
held for eight years. Having decided
to take up land and go in for hortu
culture, he resigned his position,
and purchased a property in con-
junction with his brother-in-law,
Mr. H. Turner, of Bundaberg, with
whom he trades under the title of
Thomas & Turner. Whilst waiting
for the fruit trees to come to
maturity, a dairy was established by
the partners, the products of which
were sent to the Caboolture Butter
Factory, but upon the eventual

WILLIAM REGINALD SYD-
NEY McMILLAN, of "Hazel
Dene,” Mount Buderim, is a son
of the late William McMillan, who
hailed from Cloneg, Glasgow, Scot-
land, where he was born in the year
1839. He spent most of his early
life on his father’s cattle stations
in Victoria, and in 1885 came to
Queensland, bringing with him his
wife and family. He was the ownsr
of the well-known "Maneroo” prop-
erty near Longreach, but had to
relinquish it on account of bad
times. He then took up a selection
called "Culparoo Park,” in the
same locality, which he continued to
own up to the time of his death, at
exceptionally fine herd. Beginning
as jackaroo, young McMillan put
his hand to all classes of station
work, and having become familiar
with the various phases of the indus-
try and obtained an excellent know-
ledge of the district, at 17 he
assumed the duties of messenger on
behalf of the various pastoral sta-
tions, which were scattered over a
very wide radius. At the time of
the great strike in the early nineties
the ringleaders rode to "Maneroo”
Station and threatened Mr. McMil-
lan and his son that if the men did
not stop work they would be dragged
away by main force. Mr. McMillan,
sen., allowed his shearers full


opportunity to choose for themselves,

selves of his permission to depart
others preferred to remain and take
their chance on their employer’s

burnt the woolshed and did con-
siderable damage to the property
these suffered no further molestation.
After the settlement of grievances
Experiencing difficulty in the build-
ing up of their broken fortunes,
both father and son turned their
hand to whatever work of a profit-
able nature offered itself, and for a
time the younger man was employed
in carrying out a contract for the
carting of wool from the old
“Maneroo” homestead. Later he
and his father proceeded with a
horse and dray to Opaltown, 130
miles distant, where they trusted that
the smile of the fickle Dame Fortune
might reward their efforts in delving
for the beautiful opal stone which
is found in so valuable a quality in
various parts of Queensland. Here
again, however, disappointment
awaited them, and abandoning in-
dependent enterprise the gentleman
under review took a position as
jackaroo on “Warbreccan,” a sta-
tion near Stonehenge, on the Thom-
son River. After some time he was
promoted to the post of second over-
seer, but with a change of owner-
ship his wages were reduced, and he
decided again to join his father.
About this time Mr. McMillan, sen.,
with his son and daughter, took up
10,000 acres of the old “Maneroo”
homestead property, which they
leased for agistment purposes, and
the management of a run of 20,000
acres, called “Leeson,” in the Win-

landing a flock of some 10,000 sheep
from “Maneroo” to a large tract of
country on the Georgina River, in
connection with which exodus he
penetrated into places where sheep
had never been seen before, the trip
taking 12 months. Owing to the
terrible drought conditions that
ensued provisions had to be obtained
from Hergott Springs, South Aus-
tralia, a distance of over 1,000 miles,
the supplies being brought by means
of camel teams, mostly in charge of
Afghans. Both in bringing the
sheep to this region and returning
them to “Maneroo” Mr. McMillan
made very successful trips, losing
scarcely any stock, and effected what
was commonly termed “a good

delivery after a long journey.
(Signed) “Lewis Leake, Manager.”
Returning to Longreach, he obtained
employment on “ Maneroo ” in
breaking-in horses, and attended to
other work in connection with sheep
pastured by his father on the home-
selection. In 1904 he began dealing
in sheep in small lots, and, finally,
selling his share of the selection and
sheep to his father-in-law, Mr.
Harry F. Rogers, he purchased
3,500 ewes from “Vindex” Station
near Winton, and travelling them to
Warrnambool Downs, about 40 miles
from the latter centre, he selected
38,000 acres of land for grazing pur-
poses. After carrying on this pro-
position for a short time, he

Atkinson, and another belonging to
Mr. Egholem, and taking up his resi-
dence in that neighbourhood has
since directed his attention to the
improvement of the orchard, plant-
ing bananas, oranges, and man-
darins, besides experimenting in the
cultivation of coffee. He is a
believer in up-to-date methods, and
lias installed a large pumping plant
for irrigation purposes, while in
addition to extending and improving
the homestead he has introduced fit-
tings for a gas-lighting plant in the
interior. Mr. McMillan married in
September, 1904, Anastasia, daugh-
ter of Mr. H. F. Rogers, of “Too-

on the forward journey he travelled

took a large mob of sheep to

Wales, for the same proprietary, and
received the following testimonial
from Mr. Lewis Leake, manager for
Dalgety’s at that station; —

brother took up 38,000 acres of pas-
toral territory in the same district,
which became known as “Sesbania”
Station, and was devoted to the
breeding of merino sheep by the pro-
prietors. After the sale of this pro-
perty Mr. McMillan removed to
Brisbane for the sake of procuring
the best educational facilities for his
growing family, but finding himself
unable to settle down to city life
after the absolute liberty which he
had hitherto enjoyed, he lent an
attentive ear to reports of the excel-
lent fruit-growing country in the
vicinity of Mount Buderim. Having
paid a visit of inspection, he decided
to purchase the large orchard
lady, whose decease occurred in
1913. Subsequently Mr. McMillan
married again, the present Mrs.
McMillan being his deceased wife’s
sister.
WILLIAM JAMES TYSOL
SELBY, Nanango, was born at
Armidale, in the New England dis-
trict of New South Wales, in the
year 1863, and is the only eon of
the late William Selby, once a well-
known name in Inverell, of that
State. The late Mr. Selby com-
menced storekeeping at the last-
mentioned town in the very early
days, and as in course of time suc-
cess crowned his efforts he erected
on his own behalf the first flourmill


at that centre, which he owned until
his death in 1870. His son, the
subject of this notice, received his
primary education at a Public School
at Inverell, subsequently becoming a
MR. WILLIAM SELBY, SEN.
student at the Sydney Boys’ Gram-
mar School, which institution he
left at the age of 17. After a short
interval he entered commercial life
by joining the staff of Messrs. Munro
and Maitland, a well-known firm
carrying on business at Inverell, with
whom he remained for about four
and a half years. Later on, in his
twenty-second year, he came to
Queensland, and was one of the
pioneer storekeepers of the country
districts, first opening in business on
the spot which afterwards was chosen
as the site for the present Nanango
railway station. Here he remained
for seven years, from 1885 to 1892,
and during that period availed him-
self of the opportunity to purchase
what has since developed into a very
prominent corner in this historic
town. Erecting larger premises on
the new allotment, he established
himself in business therein, and has
since reaped the reward of his enter-
prise and progressive methods in the
patronage of a large and continually
increasing clientele. At the same
time he built a modern detached
residence in the near vicinity of the
store, and with his family took up
his abode in this dwelling, which is
a modern villa, containing large and
lofty rooms, fitted with acetylene gas
and other up-to-date appointments.
Some few years ago Mr. Selby altered
the character of his business by
abandoning storekeeping operations
and taking over the agency for
a leading firm of manufacturers of
agricultural implements and machin-
ery. He has been highly successful
iu his efforts to introduce the latest
apnliances in the agricultural world
to the notice of his numerous
patrons, and carries a very large
stock of all kinds of machinery on
his premises. He has unbounded
confidence in the future of Nanango,
and owns various agricultural hold-
ings, together with a considerable
amount of real estate in the shape
of township allotments. Among the
valuable town properties of which he
holds the freehold are various stores,
and a very choice corner opposite
to that where his own premises are
situated, with a large frontage,
which has been utilized for the erec-
tion of shops, offices, and a Bank.
Whilst attending with zeal and
industry to the development of his
own private interests, Mr, Selby has
not been neglectful of his obliga-
tions to his fellow-citizens, and has
always shown himself ready to assist
in any movement for the benefit of
the district. He served as president
of the Nanango Agricultural, Pas-
toral, and Mining Association for
two years, and at the present time
occupies the position of secretary of
that body. An enthusiastic Free-
mason, his association with the craft
dates back to 1902, when Lodge

WILLIAM THOMAS WIG-
GLESWORTH, who after a long
and adventurous career, during
which he has visited most portions
of the Island Continent, is now
living in retirement at Buderim, is
a son of the late Joseph Wiggles-
worth, descendant of a family which
for many generations had followed
farming pursuits, its representatives
century after century tilling the soil
on the same property in Yorkshire,
England. Like his father before
him, Mr. W. T. Wigglesworth was
born at Hemsworth, in that County,
the year of his birth being 1848; and
after the completion of his education
at the local Grammar School, he
obtained a good grounding in all
departments of mixed farming on the
home property. In 1875 he decided
to emigrate, and with this end in
view, journeyed to London, paid his
passage money, and set sail in the
good ship “British Empire,” from
which he landed at Auckland, New
Zealand, after a trip occupying 82
days. Here he found employment in
a hay and corn store, which occupied
him for a time, and eventually he
left the Dominion for Australia by
the “Hero,” a steamer of 750 tons.
During this voyage the boat was
struck by a cyclone, and the passen-
gers spent three anxious days below
under lock and key, in momentary
expectation of the vessel founder-
ing, and though the boat was spared
this disaster, the second mate and a
couple of seamen paid the penalty
with their lives. In Melbourne Mr.

Wigglesworth secured work as
station-hand on a property known as
“Gerogery,” situated some 20 miles
from Albury, and owned by a Mr.
Samuel Watson, and after four
months was appointed overseer of
the stock—a responsible position
involving charge of 20,000 sheep.
Two years later he relinquished this
work in favour of droving, and
MR. WM. THOMAS WIGGLESWORTH.
accepted a contract from Mr.
McFadden, of “Yambla” Station, to
take a mob of sheep from the latter
property to Mr. A. G. Jones’ run
at Wagga. After effecting a safe
delivery of the flock, he was engaged
by Mr. Jones to carry out a droving
contract in New South Wales, and
this being followed up by others, he
soon became one of the best-known
drovers both in that State and the
northern districts of South Australia.
Mr. Wigglesworth found no diffi-
culty in securing contracts, and con-
tinued intermittently in this class of
occupation for about 20 years. In
1886 he was approached by Messrs.
De Salis & Brougham, of Melbourne,
who offered him the mission of
travelling through South Australia
and Western Australia in search of
suitable country for stock; and
starting out from Wilcannia in
New South AYales, he began this
journey, which was extended over
five months, proving a trip of very
exceptional hardship. All alone,
without even the companionship of
a blackboy, he rode the whole dis-
tance to Adelaide, and leaving his
horses there, sailed across Spencer
Gulf to Port Lincoln. Here he pur-
chased more horses, and set forth
on his travels, continuing along the
coastline as far as Fowler’s Bay,
when striking northwards he came
to the Nullabar Plains, over which
he rode 150 miles to another tele-
graph station. Thenceforward he
scoured the country in a westerly
direction, making long trips into the
interior, from which he returned as
soon as his food supplies ran short
to replenish his “tucker-bag” at one
of the telegraph stations, which were
150 miles apart. On one occasion,
when in the vicinity of the south-
west coast, after having been two
and a half days without water, he
discovered a waterhole among some
rocks, and proceeded to dole out the
precious liquid to his horses, using
his hat for this purpose. This was
done under the gaze of a tribe of
hostile blacks, whose curiosity got
the better of their animosity at the
sight of a man who was able to keep
them at bay with a revolver in one
hand, while with the other he dipped
water from a pool and gave drink
to his thirsty beasts. Upon his
departure the whole tribe followed
him for a time, gradually falling
back until only six, who had evi-
dently been appointed to kill him,
were left, and whilst passing through
some dense scrub from one of these he
received a spear wound in the back.
Upon the report of his revolver they
disappeared, and as the spear
happily was not poisoned, and had
not penetrated deeply, he was able
to escape without any ill effects.
Still searching for stock country, he
found his way over this wild region
with only the aid of a compass, until
eventually he struck the Herbert
River, when, turning northwards
again, he continued his travels to
the AVilliams River, and thence to
the Western Australian capital,
where he received the first commu-
nication from his employers since


leaving Wilcannia. Deeming all the
country through which he had
passed unsuitable to the purpose
required, and learning that the

severely through drought, which
necessitated a temporary removal
of the stock out west to Georgina, a


subsequent run of good seasons
restored prosperity to the firm, and
in 1914 Mr. Wigglesworth disposed
of his interest to his partner, and
retired from active grazing pursuits.
Coming to Buderim, he purchased
eight and a half acres of land at
£lOO per acre, upon which he has
built a fine residence of 10 rooms,
with a tower, from which is obtained
a magnificent view of many miles of
country. During his residence at
Winton he interested himself in
public affairs, and served as a mem-
ber of the Winton Shire Council for
a number of years, also doing
yeoman service in connection with
the Boulia Rabbit Board. Tie was
also a member of the , Winton
Masonic Lodge, travelling 120 miles
to the local gatherings of the frater-
nity, which in the days of buggy and
horses consumed a large slice of his
time. More recently, however, Mr.
Wigglesworth used motor cars on the
station, and by this quick mode of
transit the long, wearisome journeys
became easily negotiable.
AUGUSTUS WILLIAM BOW-
DER, Yandina, is a son of the late
William Sims Bowder,- a native of
Lincolnshire and descendant of a
family who for generations had tilled
the soil in that part of the English
Isle. The farm rented by the late
gentleman, who died at the age of
69, in 1889, lay on the borders of
Lincolnshire and Leicestershire, and
here the subject of this notice was
born in the year 1857. Educated at
the National School at Colsterworth,
which he left at 13 to take up work
on his father’s farm, Mr. Bowder
two years later availed himself of an
opportunity offered him of a year’s
tuition at Holland House, a very
good school at Boston, Lincolnshire.
Here he rose to be head of the
school, and subsequently returning to
the paternal roof-tree, put his know-
ledge to a very practical account,
being able to assist his father in the
discharge of various public offices
held by the latter, and by acting as
secretary, etc., to organizations in
the district, augmented his income
by some £2OO a year. At 23 he
married, and subsequently under-
took journalistic work, becoming
correspondent to a number of influ-
ential papers, for which he wrote up
agricultural notes and contributed
other matter. Eventually he began
to lease small holdings of land, for
which he paid as high a rent as £4
per acre, and in 1886 took over his
father’s farm, and worked it until
1895, when severe financial losses
compelled his retirement. For the
following five years his operations
were restricted to 30 acres, and in
1900 he came with his wife and
family of nine children to Queens-
land by the s.s. "Jumna.” Whilst
staying at the Immigration Depot
for 10 weeks he was granted by the
Government every facility to secure
a selection, and eventually decided
upon leasing a farm on the north
coast line, 65 acres in extent, of
which a few acres only had been
partially cleared. Conditions of
living were very rough, but he man-
aged to house his family in a little
home, and set to work with a will
to develop the property, in six

months coming to the end of the £9O
of capital with which he had landed.
He made careful and practical study
of the best methods of working the
land, and put in as many as 76 plots
for the purpose of discovering the
best time to sow, making besides
many other experiments leading to
an expert knowledge with regard to
many matters of deep interest to the
farming community, notes of which
have been carefully preserved, and
which it is his intention to publish
in the form of a textbook at no very
distant date. Difficulties with him
were only so many obstacles to be
surmounted, and being convinced of
the value of the country he never
dreamed of looking back, but
plodded on steadily, the first five
years working from dawn to dark
with the loyal co-operation of his
two sons. Corn and vegetables were
planted, a few pigs and fowls pur-
chased, and consoling himself with
the reflection that if little was
earned little was spent, Mr. Bowder
continued steadily until success
crowned his efforts, and he has had
the satisfaction of enjoying a solid
prosperity for several years past.
The whole of the property is cleared,
and presents a thoroughly prosperous
appearance, being an object lesson in
the district, where many of the
settlers are adopting Mr. Bowder’s
tried and approved methods. He
supplies seed to various merchants,
and his champion “King” maize is
used all over the State, the special
care which he takes in marking the
cobs to be reserved for seed having
been fully rewarded by the eager
demand on the part of the buyers for
his product. He has also made a
special feature of cattle and pigs, in
the latter section previously having
favoured the British blacks, which
are now giving way to the Berkshire
type. He has met with pronounced
success in the cultivation of sugar-
cane, in the growth of which he has
demonstrated that cultivation is of
more importance than irrigation.
Two years after the first occupation of
his property Mr. Bowder leased and
eventually purchased an additional
30 acres of land, and in 1911 further
enlarged his holding by the acquire-
ment of an adjoining 26 acres. The
small “humpy” of early days has
been replaced by a house of nine
rooms, and another homestead
almost as large has been erected for
the use of his married son. In 1915
,Mr. Bowder retired from the active
management of the property, hand-
ing over the control to his two sons,
but he still keeps to some extent in
harness, and is frequently found
busy over some of the experimental
work so dear to his heart.
WILLIAM HENRY BURTON,
J.P., "Palmetto,” Maroochy River,
via Yandina, is a son of the late
Henry Burton, of Brisbane, who,
born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, Eng-
land, in 1847, came to Queensland
in 1884, and engaged in journalistic
work until 1889, writing under the
nom de plume of “Occam’s Razor.”
He then came to Maroochy,
where general farming pursuits,
combined with banana-growing on
the Maroochy River, occupied his
attention until 1893. In the latter
year, leaving the selection in the


hands of his sons, Mr. Henry
Burton removed to Brisbane, and
subsequently was appointed city
inspector, which office he held for
about three years. He met his

death as the result of a motor car
accident in 1914. Sprung from a
good old family, the Burtons are
descendants of William Burton, the
Leicestershire antiquarian, elder
brother of Robert Burton, author of
“The Anatomy of Melancholy,” and
among their ancestral connections
were George Stephenson, the “Father
of Railways” ; and the grandmother
of Emerson, author of the famous
“Essays.” After his arrival in
Queensland the late Mr. Henry
Burton took an active part in
political life, being a supporter of
the protection movement, and his
published lectures on the subject
indicate a sound grasp of economics.
He was one of the most prominent
figures in the anti-Federation cam-
paign, and worked hard against the
referenda. In conjunction with Mr.
J. M. Cross, ex-member for Cler-
mont, he originated the Brisbane
branch of the Royal Society of St.
George; and for many years was a
leading member of the society of
Freemasons, filling the various chairs
of the Esoteric Lodge, of which he
was a founder and first master. In
his native County he attained a con-
siderable reputation as a literary
man and essayist, contributing to the
Newcastle Examiner and other jour-
nals many valuable papers on
literary, moral, and abstract sub-
jects. He dipped considerably into
science, and was particularly fond of
philosophic study and inquiry ; while
as a Shakesperean student and
scholar he had few superiors in Aus-
tralia. He was a good speaker,
forceful and convincing, and his
lectures on literature were always
highly esteemed on account of their
critical value being highly educa-
tional. His well-known lecture on
“The Allegory of King Solomon’s
Temple; its Masonic Significance
and Beauty,” is worth a permanent
place in Masonic literature. The
subject of this notice, Mr. William
Henry Burton, was born at New-
castle-on-Tyne, in the north of
England, and received his early
education at Dr. Rutherford’s School,
subsequently attending a school in
Derbyshire. After arrival with his
parents in Queensland, he completed
his studies at the Normal School,
Brisbane, and at 15 years of
age began active life in a printing
office, from which he turned to
various other avocations before
finally accompanying his father to
Maroochy River in 1889. The
country at this period was in its
wild, virgin state, and aborigines

were frequently seen in the district.
Mr. Burton assisted his father and
brothers in the clearing, scrubbing,
and fencing preliminary to the form-
ing of banana plantations. After
his father’s removal to Brisbane,
Mr. Burton’s three brothers also
took their departure from Maroochy
River, leaving the gentleman under
review to manage the property, with
his mother and aunt, who, however,
afterwards joined Mr. Burton, sen.,
at Wooloowin where Mrs. Burton
still resides. At that period the
produce was towed up the river to
Yandina, and sent thence to Bris-
bane, the advent of the railway later
making considerable improvement in
the facilities for the transport of
fruit, etc., to the best markets. The
place now presents a most flourishing
appearance, cane, bananas, citrus
fruits, etc., all coming to perfection.
Mr. Burton takes a keen interest in
the welfare of the district, and he

He is a life member, trustee, and past
president of the School of Arts, of

GEORGE EDGAR BEST, Yan-
dina, is a son of Mr. George Best,
whose parents came from England
in the early days and settled at
Sandgate, where George Best was
born in the year 1863. After coming
to mature years the latter gentleman
was for some time in the employ of
Mr. Greenwood, a butcher, of Sand-
gate, and after obtaining a good
knowledge of the trade, removed to
Yandina, where he purchased from
Mr. Bonnie the flourishing butcher-
ing business which he has since
so successfully conducted, “Butcher
Best,” as he is familiarly known
among the townspeople, being one of
the popular identities of the place.
In addition to this business, the
management of which he has now
handed over to his son, Mr. George
Best has acquired various landed
properties, among others being a
260-acre selection, a portion of the
old “Beli Park” Cattle Station,
which is now in process of clearing,
fencing, and general development
for dairying purposes and stock
grazing. Be also conducts a dairy,
situated about a mile distant from

been returned unopposed by No. 1
Division as a councillor of Maroochy
Shire. He has a family of four sons
and four daughters, two of the
former, Arthur and Edwin, having
education there and at Yandina,
whither his parents removed during
his boyhood. Upon leaving school
he became associated with his father
in the butchering trade, and has
continued in this connection ever
since. The main establishment is
situated right in the town of Yan-
dina, and the firm does its own
buying and slaughtering, the yards
for the latter purpose being located
some two miles out of the town,
where operations are superintended
by Mr. John Best. Most of the
cattle for slaughtering are brought
from Goomeri, on the Nanango
railway line; and as a side industry
Mr. Best breeds a good class of
Berkshire pigs, which he sends to
the Queensland Co-operative Bacon
Factory at Murarrie, acting in his
turn as agent for the company in
Yandina and Nambour. Excellent
management characterizes all the
details in connection with the
butchering business; the shop is
lighted with acetylene gas, and
everything is kept scrupulously
sweet and clean and free from flies
and dust. Like his father, Mr. Best
takes an active interest in all local
public affairs, and he is well known
in the town. He married Katherine,
daughter of Mr. Philip Browne, of

CHRISTOPHER SHARRY,
J.P., Kenilworth, is a eon of Mr.
Patrick Sharry, a native of Ireland,
who came to Australia in 1862 by
the ship “Maryborough,” with his
wife, and after landing in Queens-
land settled at Walloon, near Bris-
bane, where he cultivated cotton and
other crops, and split and carted
pine shingles from Kirkheim to
Ipswich for a number of years. He
now lives in retirement near Ipswich.
The subject of this notice was born
at Walloon in 1866, and received his
education at a small State School in
the neighbourhood of his home. At
12 years of age he began work under
his father’s direction, and until his
twentieth year remained at home,
undertaking whatever offered in the
way of employment from the
farmers of the district. In 1889 he
went to Charters Towers, where he
took contracts for fencing in con-
nection with the railway line, and
subsequently became identified with
station pursuits on Mount Übi,
which ultimately led to his taking
up land in the Kenilworth district
in 1890. His first selection consisted
of 640 acres of forest country, where
he built a hut of the native timber
on a low-lying site, and commenced
operations. Being flooded out in
premier share of his attention; a
small co-operative company of six
settlers being formed after the flood,

his own dairy herd. Mr. Sharry also
raises horses and pigs on his farm,
and to allow of greater scope in these
directions he acquired in 1903
Rhodes, and prairie grasses. Mr.
Sharry employs labour to work this
property, which is watered by the
Obi Obi Creek, a tributary of the
River Mary. Being recognized as
one who has made good in his private
proposition, he has had no lack of
opportunity to serve the community
by accejitance of public office from
time to time, and in 1911 was
gazetted to the Commission of the
Peace. He was president of the
Kenilworth Farmers’ Association for
several years; district representative
on the Nambour Show Committee;
rendered financial assistance in con-
nection with the erection of a local
hall and public schoolhouse; and in
1910 successfully contested No. 1
Division in the Maroochy Shire
Council, which seat he has since
retained. For some considerable
time services in connection with the
Roman Catholic Church were held
at his homestead; and as president
of the local athletic club for several
years he gave a practical manifesta-
tion of his cordial approval of
healthy outdoor recreation by
extending to the club the right of
holding their annual sports upon his
property for over 17 years. In 1898
Mr. Sharry suffered the loss of his

HENRY THOMAS BRIDSON,
J.P., of “Pyramid” Station, Ukal-
unda, via Bowen, was born at
“Yaamba,” Queensland, in the year
1866, and is a son of the late Jordan
Roach Bridson, an engineer by pro-
fession, who settled in Queensland in
the early days of the State. Upon the
maternal side he is a descendant of
a well-known English family, his
great-grandfather, Captain Yicary,
an officer of the British Army, being
the first of his name to cross the
seas to Australia. He was in charge
of a shipload of convicts, and landed
in Tasmania. Mr. Bridson’s grand-
father, the late Thomas William
Yicary, came to Queensland from
Victoria in 1859 in company with the
late P. F. Macdonald, of “Yaamba,”
and purchased from Messrs. Ramsay
and Gaden the “Canoona” Run,
which comprised the whole country-
side from the Eitzroy River to the
sea coast. Subsequently this huge
area was subdivided into several
large stations, some of which were
capable of carrying up to 10,000
head of cattle. The gentleman under
review received his education at
Mackay, at the close of his studies
serving his apprenticeship to the
pastoral industry as jackaroo on
“Canoona” Station, where, under
the guidance of his grandfather he
became well versed in the various
departments and practical working
of the enterprise. He continued in
this connection for a lengthy period,
in 1886 becoming a partner in the
property. The pastoral industry
in Queensland, however, had fallen
on evil times, the country scarcely
recovering from one drought before
a similar visitation struck the
struggling station-holders another
severe blew. At this trying time, in
order to save even a small propor-
tion of their value, the cattle were
slaughtered wholesale for their hides
and for the meagre percentage of fat
yielded by the carcase when boiled
down. Floods, too, brought ruin in
their train, great tracts of country
being inundated on these occasions,
and thousands of cattle and sheep
destroyed. In 1898 Mr. Bridson
severed his connection with “Can-
oona,” disposing of his interest in
the run, the value of which by that
EEE
time was reduced almost to a neg-
ligible figure. But although by so
doing he personally escaped the
further disaster of the worst drought
on record (1902-3), which practically
decimated the flocks and herds, not
only on this station, but throughout
the State, misfortune for a time
dogged his footsteps, and at one
period a team of horses represented
almost his entire worldly wealth.
The pioneer spirit within him, how-
ever, was strong, and he battled
along in the carrying trade between
Tooloombah and Rockhampton, de-
spite the fact that the rates for
carriage had sunk as low as £3 per
ton. As time advanced he found
himself able to put other teams on
the roads, and he also gave some
attention to stock-dealing, in which
he met with success. Eventually, in
MR. HENRY THOMAS BRIDSON.
1912, in conjunction with his uncle,
Mr. Thomas Benjamin Yicary, he
purchased “Collaroy” Station, near
St. Lawrence, possessing an area of
256 square miles, and carrying 1,450
cattle. This was the beginning of
better times. “Collaroy,” which
was purchased for £B,OOO, 18 months
later was re-sold for £13,000, and at
the latter end of the same year
(1914) the partnership with his uncle
having been dissolved, Mr. Bridson
purchased from Messrs. Mayne and
Shaw “Woodstock,” a fine tract of
country, comprising 17,500 acres of
grazing farms, and 44 square miles
of leasehold, which at the time of
purchase was already stocked with
500 breeders, with 150 calves at foot.
The character of this country is
principally tableland, with sand
ridges and box flats, watered by
numerous creeks of a permanent
nature. Mr. Bridson disposed of
“Woodstock” in 1918, shortly after
the record flood occurred, together
with 1,150 head of cattle at £9 ss.
per head. He retained the horses,
and, joining Mrs. Roderick Johnston,
of Stanmore, Sydney (a lady widely
known for the great interest she
manifested in the welfare of the
returned soldiers), purchased “Pyra-
mid” Station, comprising 42 square
miles leasehold and 60 square miles
occupation licence, with 2,000 head
of cattle and 160 horses, the property
price being £20,000. The property
consists mostly of low ridges with
river flats, and is first-class country
for both cattle and horses. Very
little surface water is available,
but ample supplies are to be
obtained by sinking. While resi-
dent at Marlborough Mr. Bridson
took a keen interest in all
local progressive movements, and was
a cordial supporter of the various
organizations for the promotion of
patriotic and charitable objects. He
married in 1897 Helena, daughter
of Mr. J. H. Hartman, post and
telegraph master at Yaamba, who
came to Queensland in 1857, and
spent some years in search of the
elusive yellow metal with very poor
success. He was one of the pros-
pectors of the Wyndham block, at
Charters Towers. Mr. Bridson has
a family of two sons and three
daughters.
The late FREDERICK GOETHS,
a pioneer of Yandina, in the
Maroochy district, Queensland, was
born at Stettin, near Berlin, and
before his arrival in Australia in
1867 followed seafaring pursuits,
being employed as sailmaker on
board the emigrant sailing-ship
“Goddefray” during two of her
voyages to Queensland. On one of
these trips, which occupied 13
months, an outbreak of typhoid
fever occurred, and over 150 of the
passengers succumbed to the com-
plaint. Having decided to settle in
Queensland, Mr. Goethe proceeded
to “Toorong” Station (now “Bar-
amba”) on the Burnett River, where
he spent a couple of seasons in
getting into touch with the sheep
industry. Moving from there to
Ipswich, he purchased a homstead
on the Logan River, where he car-
ried on farming pursuits, and was
also occupied in timber-getting and
other avocations incidental to bush
life. After 15 years in this district

place known as “Maroochydore.”
Here he again became engaged in
farming and timber industries, using
teams of bullocks for transport of
the logs to the river, whence they
were despatched by steamer to Bris-
bane. After clearing the whole of
the selection, Mr. Goeths disposed of
it to a Mr. Davison, the present pro-
prietor, and continued to reside in
the district until the time of his
death, which occurred two years
later, in 1910, in his seventy-third
year. He marr’ed Margaret,

five daughters. Two of the sons met
with accidental deaths on the
property. FREDERICK WIL-
LIAM GOETHS, “Mount Übi,”
Eumundi, was born at Ipswich, in
1867, and when two years of age was
taken by his parents to the Logan
River, where subsequently he
attended the public school of the
district. At 13 he removed with the
other members of his family to
Yandina, on the Maroochy Inlet,
and proved himself of great assist-
ance in the strenuous toil that was
necessary to reclaim the land taken
up by his father from its virgin
state of scrub and heavy timber.
Mr. Goeths remained under the
parental rooftree until his twenty-
fifth year, when he made arrange-
ments to start life on independent
lines. Good reports having reached
him of the country through which
the Obi Obi Creek threaded its way,
he visited the neighbourhood, with
the result that he and his wife each
selected 160 acres of country on the
banks of the Übi Creek, in the near
vicinity of the above-mentioned
stream. Undaunted by the prospects
of pioneer experience which lay
before them, the young couple
travelled in a bullock team from
Yandina, following for some dis-
tance the old Gympie road, and
finally diverging on to a rough track
which led to the spot where the pre-
sent homestead stands. A slab hut
shortly afterwards gave the first hint
of civilization in the wilderness, and
next stout arms were busy with
reducing the confused tangle of
brushwood and timber to a payable
proposition. This was accomplished
by the conversion of forest giants
into railway sleepers and other
classes of timber required by the
Government of the day in their
developmental schemes, and as by
this means the cleared spaces on the
holding grew large enough to provide
sufficient pasture land, a dairy
herd was introduced, which was soon
producing gallons of rich cream for
the creamery at Eumundi. Gradu-
ally, however, Mr. Goeths perceived
MR. ALBERŢ HERBERT GOETHS.
that for him greater profit lay in
the timber industry, particularly in
the pine trees which flourish in that
region, and relinquishing farming
operations he erected a sawmill, to
which are brought by means of bul-
lock teams the huge logs, often
fully 4 to 5 feet in diameter, which
are sawn into all sizes and lengths
and sent to the railway station at
Eumundi to be forwarded to the
timber merchants in Brisbane. Pack-
ing cases and fruit cases are also
made by the thousand on the pre-
mises for the supply of the fruit-
growers of Mapleton and the sur-
rounding districts. Mr. Goeths
married Mary Margaret, daughter
of the late John Anderson, of Yan-
dina, a shipmate of the late Freder-
ick Goeths, father of the gentleman
under review. The family consists
of four daughters and one son.
ALBERT HERMAN GOETHS,
of Cedar Grove, near Obi Obi, was
born at Alberton, on the Logan
River, where also he attended school
for a few years. When he was 11
years of age his parents left the
district for Yandina, and after
assisting in the preliminary work of
clearing, he aided his father, the late
Frederick Goeths, in the timber
enterprise so successfully built up
by that gentleman. Subsequently he

accompanied his elder brother to the
Obi Obi district, and selected a
holding, after which he returned to
the home at Yandina for about three
years. Upon his approaching mar-
riage he took his bullock
team to the selection pre-
viously taken up, and built
a “humpy” of rough tim-
ber on the banks of the
river, ready for the recep-
tion of his bride, who
shortly afterwards made
her advent to the spot
as the second white woman
in the district. As one
of the earliest settlers of
Cedar Grove, Mr. Goeths
had his full taste of pioneer-
ing work, particularly in
connection with timber-
getting, which was one of
his chief sources of income.
After cutting the timber
he carted it to Eumundi, taking
nearly a week to travel the distance
(about 30 miles) over mountains and
rivers, to the little settlement,
where he disposed of it to various
timber merchants. A disease depriv-
ing him of some of his bullocks, he
decided to abandon this means of
livelihood, and about this time
secured a contract tor driving' the
mail between Obi Obi and Nambour.
The service was a tri-weekly one, and
as the road wends its way over a
steep range of hills a full day was
taken up in making the return jour-
ney of 52 miles, teams of four and

and smashing the coach to pieces.
Upon his recovery, in 1905, he pur-
chased a small herd of cattle and
commenced dairying operations, a
departure which proved a decided
success. A few years later he moved
the homestead farther from the
river, and recently has built a new
home, which stands as the centre of
a fine dairy farm, where about 60
cows browse on the rich pastures,

wheelwright and blacksmith in his
native country, Scotland. While
still quite a young man he sailed
with his wife for Australia, and
after arrival at Brisbane established
himself in business in the vicinity of
the present warehouse of Messrs.
Finney, Isles, & Co. For a time he
resided at Ipswich, and thereafter
moved from one place to another,
carrying on his trade, and also
acquiring land for farming and other
purposes. Eventually he settled at
born at Toowoomba in 1886, and
received his education at Dalby,
where his father opened a black-
smithing business. About the year
1893 another removal was made to
Laidley, where he finished his
studies, and began to learn his
father’s trade, upon the completion
of his training in this direction
undertaking different classes of work
for various residents in that district,
being employed in cane-cutting and
kindred pursuits on the neighbour-
ing farms until his twenty-first year.
Meanwhile Mr. Andrew Purdon and
one of his sons (James) had selected
a holding in the Kenilworth district,
and after working on this property
for a time, William and his brother
a recreation reserve being thrown
open for purchase through the
agency of the local branch of the
Farmers’ Association. The sale was
conducted on the ballot system, and
there were at least 57 applica-
tions for these coveted blocks,
among whom the Purdon
Brothers proved successful,
each being the fortunate
drawer of an allotment. The
locality is favoured with a most
fertile soil, a heavy black loam,
which, in ordinary parlance,
“will grow anything,” pre-
dominating. On the rising
ground is splendid pasture
land, where the nutritious
natural grasses have been
supplemented by a growth of
paspalum, highly valued as a
fodder plant. Prairie and
couch grass are found in
abundance, and the excellent
rainfall ensures a continuity of
pasture which keeps the dairy
herd well nourished all the
seasons round. The cattle are chiefly
of the shorthorn type, and in addi-
tion to this class of stock Mr. Pur-
don has given considerable attention
to the breeding of saddle and
draught horses, and also of Berk-
shire pigs. The property is situated
at the junction of the Mary and
Obi Rivers, the homestead lying in
the vicinity of Eumundi, whither
the dairy products are sent from

parental homestead, subsequently
attending an education institution
at Toowoomba. Upon the comple-
tion of his studies at the age of 16,
he was placed in a position on
“Boonara” Station in order to learn
the business of cattle mustering and
the many and varied details per-
taining to the management and
handling of stock generally. Apply-
ing himself with energy and industry
to the duties that were assigned to
him, he rapidly became proficient,
and in due course was installed as
head stockman, which position he
retained for a period of four years.
Impelled by the spirit of adventure
to seek a change of scene, Mr. Green
relinquished his post at “Boonara”
and proceeded westwards, making a
short sojourn on “Mount Marlow”
Station on the Barcoo River. From
there he continued his travels to
“Warrnambool Downs” Station,
and settling down to the routine of
the station spent a further two years
in perfecting himself in all matters
concerning cattle-raising and other
pastoral enterprise. He next turned
his steps in an easterly direction,
calling a halt at “Wigton” Station,
where he remained in the capacity
of cattle overseer for six years, at
the end of this time transferring his
services to “Myall Grove” Station,
on the Condamine River, and mak-
ing a conspicuous success of his first
managerial position. Four years
later he accepted the management
of “Wigton,” and from that time
(1901) onward has maintained an
unbroken connection with the pro-
perty, of which he is now joint
owner, through the intervening
years controlling operations with the
best results. “Wigton” is situated
iu the Burnett district, near the
towns of Wondai and Gayndah, on
the Nanango branch railway line,
and consists of some 50,000 acres of
fair grazing land. It is provided

with an adequate water supply, and
the pastures are rich in natural
grasses, the property being capable
of carrying 5,000 cattle, besides the
hundred and a half of horses which
are run thereon. Mr. Green has
proved himself not only a very effi-
cient administrator of the private
proposition which has absorbed the
major share of his time and energies,
but he has also assumed the respon-
siblities of a public-minded citizen,
being an active member of the Bur-
nett Marsupial Board, and promin-
ently associating himself with the
various social and philanthropic
movements of the district. He was
married in the year 1896 to a
daughter of the late John Broad-
bent, of “Widgee Widgee” Station,
a gentleman very widely known as
a successful cattle-breeder, and of
this union there is issue one
daughter.
RICHARD SIMS, Gheerulla, via

having been born at Ipswich in the
year 1866. His father died during

Enoggera district, where he was
engaged in timber-getting for the
supply of builders in Brisbane. At
the age of nine years Mr. Richard

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


Sims began his education at the
Upper Kedron School, which was
built by the settlers, who agreed to
defray the expenses of a schoolhouse
in return for free education for
their children. This building is still
standing, though to meet the needs
of an increasing population a larger
and more modern structure has
taken its place as a schoolhouse. At
13 years of age Mr. Sims left school,
and proving himself useful in the
timber industry was employed by
his uncles in all classes of work in
connection with their calling until
1891. About this time he proceeded
to the north coast with three com-
panions, their purpose being to
select country for farming pursuits.
Having provided themselves with
plans from the Lands Department,
they visited several localities between
Landsborough and Traveston, where
large areas of land had been thrown
open for selection in 160-acre blocks
at 2s. 6d. an acre. His choice fell
on a holding 486 acres in extent,
which being classified land was
valued at £1 per acre. Subsequently,
however, classification being accom-
plished over this part of the district,
the price was made uniform with
that of the neighbouring territory,
and Mr. Sims reducing the quantity
named in his application was able
to secure 320 acres at 2s. fid. per
acre. The block of land of which he
then took possession was formerly a

carted by road to Gympie, Eumundi
at that time being little more than
a railway siding for the convenience
of the immediate settlers; and after
a rough trip occupying three days
obtained 2s. per bushel for the
maize and a proportionate price for
the potatoes, these being top prices
plucking up heart of grace, Mr. Sims
and six other settlers determined to
Iry and retrieve their fortunes by
starting the cream industry in that
neighbourhood. Accordingly the
little syndicate purchased a hand
separator of 75 gallons capacity, and
on July 1, 1898, the first consign-
ment of cream was sent in two
eight-gallon cans on the back of a
packhorse to Eumundi. After nine
months a road was constructed, and
a cart was used for taking the cans
to the settlement, and for three
years the small company continued
operations, receiving satisfactory
returns for their enterprise. Upon
the advent of the home separator
they disbanded, each continuing on
his own account, but the industry by
this time had been firmly established,
and prosperity once more reigned in
the district. It is interesting to
know that Mr. Sims’ house was the
headquarters of the combined indus-
try, the separating all being done at
“Maryland,” the name given to his
property, which is situated at
Gheerulla, formerly known as Yahoo
Creek. At the present time he
divides his attention between dairy-
ing and pig-raising, the cream being
sent to the Caboolture Butter Fac-
tory, and the pigs finding their way
to the Cleveland Bacon Factory, in
both of which institutions Mr. Sims
is a shareholder. He is also a mem-

FARMER & SON, “Namoi Hills,”
Dingo. (Joseph Farmer and Nor-
man Farmer.) Mr. Joseph Farmer,
the senior partner of the firm under
notice, was born in Worcestershire,
England, in 1842, his father being
engaged in farming pursuits in that
County. At the close of his school-
days he assisted on the home farm
until 1861, when he decided to come
to Australia, following the example
of an elder brother, who had emi-
grated some years previously to join
his brother, Mr. (afterwards Sir)
William Farmer, founder of the
well-known firm of Farmer & Co.,
of Sydney. This brother subse-
quently had taken a position as
jackaroo on “Redbank” Station, in
the Burnett district, Queensland,
and later travelled about the coun-
try for a year or two, looking for a
suitable locality in which to settle
down to pastoral pursuits. Mr.
Joseph Farmer, after a voyage of 84
days’ duration in the “Young Aus-
tralia” sailing ship, landed at More-
ton Bay, and, proceeding to “Cal-
luingal” Station, near Rockhamp-
ton, secured employment there,
where he was found by his elder

brother, during the shearing season,
towards the end of 1863. The broth-
ers then joined forces in the pur-
chase of ewes from Messrs. Dutton
and Sons, of “Bauhinia Downs”
Station, taking delivery of the sheep
there. Whilst travelling “out west,”
their progress was barred by the
record flood that occurred in the
Dawson River in 1864, and, together
with a hundred other intending
settlers and bullock teams with sup-
plies for the stations, they had to
wait for the waters to subside. Al-
most all the men were down with
fever and ague, and beyond the
Barcoo River the settlers were almost
at starvation point. When the flood
abated, Mr. Farmer and his brother
proceeded on their way, and estab-
lished a station at the head of Lake
Salvator, on the Nogoa River, which
they conducted in partnership for
about nine years, during this period
admitting a cousin into the firm.
From time to time they acquired
further territory, and in 1873, when
they sold out, were controlling
“Mount Playfair” and “Fairview,”
both areas of 40 square miles, in
addition to the original “Lake Sal-
vator,” which comprised 48 square
miles. This was all well-watered
country, and the partners obtained
fairly good results in their ventures,
despite the fact that values for sheep
and wool were not so high as they
were at a later date, and
the difficulties of transport reduced
the profits very considerably. After
the dissolution of the firm in the
year above-mentioned, Mr. Joseph
Farmer selected land on the Calliope
River, which he devoted to cattle
and mixed farming, but owing to
various causes —principally droughts
and the lack of markets —this proved
financially a failure. In 1910 he
purchased “Namoi Hills,” originally
part of the “Pearl Creek” Estate,
and having an area of 29,000 acres,
which subsequently was increased, by
the purchase of two small grazing
farms in the vicinity, to 35,000 acres.
The country consists of open forest
land, with sandstone ridges, and is
watered by Bridgewater and Spring-
ton Creeks, both containing per-
manent water, and by four large
dams, and a large proportion of the
run has been ringbarked, consider-
ably improving the pasturage. The
homestead, erected by the present
owners, is of bungalow style, and a
huge woolshed, roofed with shingles,
and in a splendid state of repair,
although dating back to 1864, shows
as a landmark of the days when the
wool industry was killed, almost at
its inception in this district, by the
damage wrought by the seed of the
spear grass. Mr. Farmer married in
1874 a daughter of the late George
Bayliss, a civil engineer of some
note in England, and has one son.

Rockhampton in 1877, and was edu-
cated privately. He early became his

in 1897 assumed practically the full
control of affairs. Some very suc-
cessful transactions have distin-
guished his administration, the
earliest being the sale of “Coomoo-
dilly,” the homestead on the Cal-
liope, and the purchase of “Namoi
Hills.” "Palm Tree Creek” Station
(100 square miles, carrying 2,300
cattle) he bought and sold in 1913;
and 1914 was marked by the pur-
chase and sale of both “Ben Lo-
mond,” near Bowen (190 square
miles, 2,000 acres freehold, with
4,009 head of cattle), and “Charle-
vue” (114 square miles in extent,
with a herd of 3,850 cattle). He is
also a partner with his cousin, Mr.
Carlton Farmer, in ‘‘Gogango Es-
tate,” having an area of 7,000 acres
freehold and 6,000 acres grazing
farms, well watered and highly im-
proved, carrying 1,800 head of
stock. Mr. Norman Farmer married
in 1907 Mary Louise, daughter of
Mr. Samuel Farmer, of “Eazeldene”
Station, and has one daughter.

who for centuries had carried on
agricultural pursuits in County
Down, Ireland. After arrival in this
State David Gordon selected land in
the Enoggera district, about six or
seven miles from Brisbane, which he
cleared and developed for farming
purposes, and here his large family
of seven sons and four daughters
grew to manhood and womanhood,
giving him material assistance in the
working of the property. At a later
date Mr. Gordon took up a second
holding in the district, and con-
tinued successfully in the agricul-
tural industry for many years. He
died at Wilston, near Brisbane, on
March 10, 1910, at the age of 69
years. The subject of this notice,

the Cedar Creek Public School,
which he attended until 14 years of
age. Upon leaving school plenty of
employment was found for him on
his father’s farm, and he remained
under the paternal rooftree for
about six years, at the close of which
period the Boer War broke out in
South Africa. Enlisting as a volun-
teer for active service, he accom-
panied the Third Australian Con-
tingent to Beira, in Portuguese
East Africa, proceeding thence to
Rhodesia with a relieving column
under General Plumer, and eventu-
ally taking part in the relief of
Mafeking, when he served under
General Baden-Powell for a term of
three months. At the termination
of active hostilities he was concerned
in the ensuing guerilla warfare for
about two years, subsequent to which

This being a year of great drought,

over the country in search of places
where grass and water might be
found—a very tedious and trying
task, especially when the stock suc-
cumbed by the thousand on the
parched, dry areas which stretched
for hundreds of miles in the west of
Queensland. While engaged in this
way, Mr. Gordon visited Longreach
and other large centres, and upon
the breaking up of the drought
returned to Brisbane, where he
turned his hand to various avoca-
tions. Ultimately deciding to
settle on the land, he selected a
holding in the Kenilworth district,
which had been thrown open to
small investors, and taking up 200
acres in this locality he formed it
into a homestead property, clearing,
fencing, and erecting a dwelling-
house and outbuildings. He has
installed an up-to-date milking plant

on these premises as a labour-saving
device in dealing with the 60 cows
which provide the products for the
staple industry of the property, and
do well on the rich pastures through
the long Queensland summer. The
holding, which bears the quaint
name of "Natural Pocket,” is situ-
ated on a small creek, a tributary of
the River Mary, which latter stream
runs round nearly three parts of its
boundary in the shape of a horseshoe,
and the flats, besides being rich in
natural grasses, produce splendid
results when planted with root crops
or corn. Mr. Gordon, as well as cart-
ing the large quantity of cream
produced by his dairy into Eumundi,
also undertakes the conveyance of
his neighbours’ dairy products to
that town, which lies 16 miles dis-
tant, often carrying 400 gallons in
one day, and using two teams for
the work. He has some fine horses,
and is justifiably proud of his stock.
In addition to the homestead pro-
perty he owns a grazing block at
Conondale, his landed possessions
in the district aggregating about 700
acres. Mr. Gordon takes a great
interest in the local branch of the
Queensland Farmers’ Union, and
has acted as secretary to this body
ever since its formation. He mar-
ried Emma, daughter of Mr. Jacob
Fritz, a farmer of the same district,
and has two sons and three
daughters.


FREDERICK MacDONALD
HOOKE, grazier, “Burnside,” Woo-
looga, is a son of the late Frederick
Augustus Hooke, who was born at
“Wiragulla” Station, Dunvog-, New
O 7 O O 7 #
South Wales, in which district a
great deal of landed property is still
owned by various branches of the
Hooke family. He represented the
third generation of his name in Aus-
tralia, the great-grandparents of the
gentleman under review—possessors
of considerable substance—having
voyaged to the land of the Southern
Cross in the early part of the nine-
teenth century in their own ships,
bringing with them servants, horses
and cattle, farm implements, and
all the equipment necessary for
pioneer work on the land. The sub-
ject of this memoir, Mr. Frederick
MacDonald Hooke, was born at
Dungog in the year 1879, and re-
ceived his education at the Public
School in his native town. Upon the
completion of his studies he turned
his attention to pastoral pursuits,
and in course of time, having gained
the requisite experience, undertook
the management of a couple of
estates, known respectively as “Din-
gadee” and “Peachtrees,” situated
near Dungog, which were devoted to
the fattening of cattle, and eventu-
ally purchased the latter property,
upon which he resided for some con-
siderable time. While still a mere
youth Mr. Hooke had been

his years when he was first entrusted
with this mission that it is recorded
of him that on one occasion he was
met with a curt refusal from the
owner of some cattle, who declined

to allow him to inspect his stock on
the score that it was hardly likely
a lad of 16 would have been seriously
commissioned to undertake such a
responsible task. During the pro-
gress of these travels he gained a
fairly wide knowledge of the Queens-
land country and formed a very
of his New South Wales interests
and purchased the “Bonnie Doon”
and “Ensham” cattle stations, on
the Central Queensland railway line,
near Emerald. In this venture,
he was joined by Mr. J. S. Y. Mein,
and since then the two partners car-
ried on operations together. Mr.
Mein was in France in 1916, fight-
ing with the Australian Imperial
Forces. In 1914 Mr. Hooke decided
to dispose of “Bonnie Doon” and
“Ensham”—which latter station
enjoys distinction from the circum-
stance that within its boundaries is
to be found the historic “Leichhardt
Tree,” famous in early Queensland
history—and acquired the present
estate, “Burnside,” at Woolooga,
consisting of about 10,000 acres of
freehold land, capable of running
over 2,000 head of cattle. This fine
property lies on beautiful, well-
watered country, and possesses a
deep, loose, and very rich soil, which
responds remarkably to improve-
ment, making it a labour of love to

6, 1877, at Bowen, Queensland, and
is a son of the late John Charles
William Mackrell, whose father, the
late William Thomas Mackrell,
native of the above-mentioned
County, the date of his birth being
April 21, 1845. In his twenty-second
year he left England by the sailing
vessel “Great Victoria,” arriving ar
M oreton Bay on August 25, 1865,
and subsequently for a few years
he spent his time in the coastal coun-
try of Queensland, gaining valuable
experience in the pastoral industry
and the general conditions of the
bush. By degrees he qualified him-
self for the position of station mana-
ger, and during the course of his
career controlled the affairs of a
number of large pastoral runs, his
first responsible position being at
“Newstead,” owned by Mr. Bertie
Parr. From there he transferred his
activities to “Eaton Yale,” and
subsequently, after a period spent as
manager of “ Jarvisfield,” he was at
“Bromby Park” and its out-stations,
“Goorganga” and “Crystal Brook,”
where he remained for some con-
siderable time after his marriage,
which took place in the year 1875.
In 1892 he re-visited England with
his family, during the course of the
trip having the misfortune to lose
his wife, who was an English lady
named Miss Alice Jane Selwood.

where they have resided ever since
their father’s demise. The estate
comprises about 3,000 acres, some
of the country being particularly
rich in quality, and has proved
highly suitable to grazing and cattle-
raising, which are the chief indus-
tries carried on. Mr. Mackrell was
a member of the Ivilkivan Shire

to their own physical ills have every
reason to acknowledge the courteous
attention which he gives to their
requirements. The subject of this
memoir is a son of Mr, James


Griffiths, of Wellington Road,
East Brisbane, who came to Queens-
land from Bolton, Lancashire, Eng-
land, about 30 years ago, and 12
months after arrival joined the
Civil Service as master of one of the
Government dredges, which post he
still retains. Born at Brisbane on
February 14, 1890, Mr. Ernest
Griffiths was educated at the East
Brisbane State School, which he
attended until about 15 years of age.
Subsequently he studied under a
private tutor for a year, and passed
the preliminary pharmacy examina-
tion to enable him to become
indentured to Mr. W. R. Colledge,
pharmacist, of Brisbane, for a term
of three years. Whilst serving his
articles he studied at the Brisbane
College of Pharmacy, and after two
and a half years succeeded in passing
the intermediate examination, and
at the close of his term became
assistant dispenser for about three
years to the Friendly Societies’ Dis-
pensary. During this time be still
further prosecuted his studies at the
Pharmacy College, and before com-
pleting his twenty-second year
became a fully qualified chemist.
Subsequent to this he took a position
with Messrs. Moses, Ward, & Son,
chemists, of Queen Street, Brisbane,
with whom he remained for two
years, and at the close of this period
embraced the opportunity for secur-
ing a good country practice by pur-
chasing the Killarney Pharmacy
from Mr. FI. G. Barnes in 1915. All
through his school and college days
Mr. Griffiths took a keen interest in
athletic sports, and distinguished
himself in cricket and football,
winning medals in the former field.
He was also a member, and in his
final year captain, of the school
football club, which carried off the
coveted cup three years in succes-
sion; and later whilst at college was
a playing member of the Chemists’
Cricket Club. In June, 1913, Mr.
Griffiths married Kathleen, daughter
of the late Mr. Stephen Simpson,
one of the early pioneers of Ingham,
North Queensland, where he occu-
pied the office of post-master. Of this
marriage there is one daughter.
FLORENCE O’ROURKE, J.P.,
"Brefney,” via Cooran, was born in
County Kerry, Ireland, in the year
1856, and is the youngest son of the
late Maurice O’Rourke, who was en-
gaged in farming occupations in that
part of the Emerald Isle. Educated
in his native place, Mr. Florence
O’Rourke left school at about 14
years of age, and turned his atten-
tion to the duties of his father’s
farm, where he remained for about
four years. At 18 he accompanied
his brother to New Zealand by the
ship “Wild Deer,” and landing in
Otago found employment of a varied
nature open to him. For the follow-
ing seven years he spent his time in
farm work, railway construction,
and other avocations incidental to
the development of country districts,
and eventually in 1881 crossed to
the mainland of Australia, landing
at Sydney with the intention of pro-
ceeding to the newly-discovered gold-
field at Temora. Owing to unfore-
seen circumstances he was unable to
carry out this plan, and as an alter-
native went to New England, where
he was employed on a station in the

vicinity of the mining district of
Hillgrove. In 1895 he made his ad-
vent to Queensland, and whilst
travelling on the North Coast line
he was much impressed by the possi-
bilities of the rich scrub land about
four miles distant from Cooran.
Accordingly he here selected a hold-
ing of about 100 acres, which subse-
quently he was able to increase to
double that size, and upon this area
started a sugar plantation, which he
carried on for about six years,
Owing to the decreasing price given
for cane and the exhausting influ-
ence of this product upon the soil,
Mr. O’Rourke decided at the close
of this period to enter upon the
dairying industry, and with this
purpose in view prepared his land
for pasture paddocks, introducing a
good strain of dairy cattle and
inaugurating his new enterprise upon
up-to-date methods. Experience has
taught him that the most suitable
type of milch cow for the district is
the Illawarra Shorthorn, which has
proved most reliable and satisfac-
tory, and in all respects the venture
has fully justified itself, Mr.
O’Rourke’s position now being that
of the prosperous dairy farmer of
Queensland. He is a shareholder in
the Murarrie Co-operative Bacon
Factory, in the Caboolture Butter
Factory, and in the similar institu-
tion at Wide Bay, and acts in vari-
ous official capacities in connection
with the public organizations of the
neighbourhood. He is a com-
mitteeman of the Noosa Agricul-
tural, Horticultural, and Industrial
Society, is a member of the valua-
tion board of the Shire of Noosa
and Widgee, president of the Work-
ers’ Political Organization, and
chairman of the local School Com-
mittee. Mr. O’Rourke married in
1883 Esther, daughter of the late
James Doherty, a farmer of Armi-
dale, New South Wales, and has
seven daughters and three sons.
The late TIMOTHY DEMPSEY,
of "Sorrel Hills” Station, via Dua-
ringa, is a native of Tipperary, Ire-
land, where he was born in 1854,
his father, the late James Dempsey,
having followed the calling of a
farmer in that country. In 1865,
the family came to Australia bv the
ship ‘‘Beejapore,” arriving at Rock-
hampton on June 23 of that year;
and, after completing his educa-
tion at the local State School, Mr.
Timothy Dempsey turned his atten-
tion to the pastoral industry on a
property owned by his father in
that district. In 1885, he pro-
ceeded northwards, to take over on
behalf of Miss O’Reilly, the man-
agement of the "Innisfail” sugar
plantation, on the Johnstone River,
founded by the late Mr. Fitzgerald,
and noted as the earliest sugar-
growing proposition in the wet
tropical belt. Despite the fact that
this was his initial experience, Mr.
Dempsey made a signal success of
the enterprise, the estate, which
formerly was heavily involved, pay-
ing handsomely under his admini-
stration. Whilst residing at ‘‘ln-
nisfail” he was offered, and ac-
cepted, the control of affairs on the
neighbouring plantation of “Innis-
sheen,” which was owned by a


company; and, later, when Miss
O’Reilly disposed of her estate, Mr.
Dempsey formed one of a syndicate
to take up and establish the “Mour-
ilyan” sugar plantation and mill,
which, at a subsequent date, was
formed into the present Australian
Sugar Company. In 1893 he pur-
chased “Evelyn” Station, a prop-
erty of some 400 square miles,
situated north of Herberton, and
devoted to the raising of cattle and
horses. This station he afterwards
sold to Mr. J. Moffat, of Herberton.
He disposed of his interest in the
Mourilyan Sugar Plantation about
1910, when the “White Australia”
nolicy of dispensing with Kanaka
labour created complications in the
working of this industry; and, re-
turning to the Duaringa district,
he settled down at “Sorrel Hills,”
formerly the property of his late
father and brothers, of which, by
degrees, he had purchased the sole
interest. Mr. Dempsey forthwith
inaugurated great improvements on
the run, ringbarking large areas of
timber, and completing the work of
subdivision into paddocks of work-
able size. He made alterations in
the homestead, and found scope for
his energy and enterprise in the
building up of the Hereford herd,
which under his able administration
showed marked improvement, fresh
blood from Messrs. Archer Brothers’
herd being introduced with excellent
results. “Sorrel Hills,” where Mr.

Mining Companies. He was a very
large shareholder in the “North
Queensland Register” newspaper, in
the Australian Bank of Commerce,
Messrs. Howard Smith’s Shipping
Company, and in various other com-
panies. He also was an investor
in real estate at Cairns, the busi-
ness premises at present occupied by
Messrs. Samuel Allen & Sons, Ab-
bott Street, being in his possession
at the time of his death. He took
a keen interest in local government
and in politics, and, for a lengthy
period was a member of the John-
stone Shire Council, serving as its
chairman for several years, and
earning the highest respect of the
community for his good judgment
and ripe experience, which made
him a useful member of any organi-
sation. Mr. Dempsey married in
1893, Mary Catherine, daughter of
Mr. Michael O’Brien, of Rockhamp-
ton, and had one daughter. Miss
Evelyn Dempsey was born at “In-

cation at a Private School at War-

HENRY COLEY HUTTON,
“Raby Creek,” via Duaringa, is a
son of the late Charles Boydell Dut-
ton, whose father—Henry P. Dut-
ton —came to Australia in the late
MR. CHAS. BOYDELL DUTTON,
twenties of the nineteenth century,
and settled at “Pickering Scone,”
on the Hunter River, New South
Wales. Charles Boydell Dutton was
born on this estate in 1834, and, at
the close of his education, became
engaged in pastoral pursuits, but, on
account of heavy floods on the
Hunter in the late fifties, he decided
to accompany his father and other
members of the family to Queens-
land. The party travelled overland
with bullock drays, and, after a pro-
longed journey, arrived at Rock-
hampton, where they took up “Bau-
hinia Downs” as an original lease
from the Crown, and, settling down
on this area, developed it as; a sheep
proposition. In 1860, Mr. C. B.
Dutton, leaving his father and
brother to manage “Bauhinia
Downs,” with one of his brothers
and three cousins (Messrs. W., R.,
and H. Bell), secured the leasehold
of “Tambo” Station, on the Barcoo
River, and “Nive Downs” Station,
on the Nive River, both very large
areas, which they stocked principally
with sheep. The latter property
was disposed of after three or four
years, but the firm continued the
development of “Tambo,” which,
under their administration, carried
a flock of 30,000. About 1879, dis-
posing of “Tambo,” they transferred
their efforts to “ Bimerah” on the
Thomson River, comprising some
700 square miles, upon which a flock
of 40,000, and 12,000 head of cattle
were run—this number being sold
with the station in the early eighties.
In 1882, the late C. B. Dutton left
the district, and, taking up his resi-
dence in Brisbane, successfully
contested the Leichhardt electorate
for Parliamentary honours, begin-
ning his political career in 1883. He
was appointed Secretary for Public
Lands in the Griffith Ministry in
that year, resigning in August,
1887, to take the portfolio of Public
W orks and Mines in the Griffith
Administration. In the following
December, he resigned his portfolio,
and created the office of Secretary
for Railways, which he filled until
June, 1888, when he retired from
public life. Whilst Secretary for
lands, Mr. Dutton was mainly re-
sponsible for the important Griffith-
Dutton Land Act of 1884, one of the
features of which was the introduc-
tion of the leasehold tenure in con-
nection with grazing and agricul-
tural farms, the object of the Gov-
ernment being to further closer set-
tlement. Among his other useful
services in Queensland, he assisted in
the founding of the Central Queens-
land Meat Export Company, Ltd.,
at Lake’s Creek, in which he was a
very large shareholder; and, in con-
junction with the late Hon. William
Miles, he founded in 1886 the Royal
Bank of Queensland, his name being
included upon the original Board of
Directors. He was a noted breeder
of merino sheep at Bauhinia Downs,
and swept the shows at Springsure,
among other honours winning the
50-guinea gold cup presented by the
local Agricultural Association. His
blood horses and high-class cattle
also attained a wide reputation. In
addition to his other interests, in
the sixties Mr. C. B. Dutton way a
part owner of “Ghinghindi” Sta-
tion, in the Dawson district, which,
subsequently, was purchased by Mr.
W. C. Mayne. Ultimately he left
Queensland and purchased a small
freehold property six miles distant
from Tenterfield, New South Wales,
known as “Cooredullaj” where he
died in 1904. He married a daugh-
ter of Colonel Coley, who had charge
of soldiers stationed in Brisbane, in
the convict days, and had a family
of two sons and six daughters. Mr.
Henry Coley Dutton, the gentleman
under review, received his education
in Brisbane, and, later, was associ-
ated with his father in pastoral pur-
suits, eventually becoming manager
of “Bauhinia Downs” and “Goo-
mally” which latter station was ac-
quired by his grandfather, and
worked in conjunction with the
earlier run. After Mr. C. B. Dut-
ton’s death he continued to admini-
ster the estates on behalf of the
family, and was a heavy loser in
the drought of 1902, when 600 head
were mustered out of 14,000 cattle.
“Bauhinia Downs” was sold in 1903
to Mr. A. J. Cotton, and “Goo-
mally” was purchased by Mr. Dut-
ton and his brother, Mr. C. W. Dut-
ton, who conducted it for seven
years, when this country also passed
into Mr. Cotton’s hands. Mr. Dutton
then bought a property on the junc-
tion of the Comet and Nogoa Rivers,
which he sold at the end of twelve
months, and for a time resided in
Rockhampton. In 1917 he accepted
the position of manager of “Raby
Creek” Station, on behalf of Messrs.
McLaughlin, Limited, and has re-
tained this appointment ever since.

affairs of the district, and has occu-

BATES, Fernleigh,” Lakeside, is
the youngest son of the late William
Bates, of Boompa” Station, and
was born at “Old Mingo” Station,
MR. WILLIAM A. A. BATES.
in the Burnett district, in the year
1860, at which period his father—
who had come to Queensland from
New South Wales some years pre-
viously —was filling the position of
sheep overseer on behalf of the late
Gilbert Eliott, the then owner of
“Yenda” Station. In 1863, when
the “Boompa” run was acquired by
Wide Bay district. During the
course of his education, which he
received at home under the guidance
of a private tutor, young Bates made
full use of the excellent opportuni-
ties that fell in his way as the son of
a large stockholder, and became very
expert in the handling and manage-
ment of cattle. In this way he fitted
himself for the duty which devolved
upon him after the death of his
father in 1894 of carrying on the
conduct of the station in partnership
with his elder brother, Mr. John
William Bates, of “Boompa,” and
this connection was continued until
1901, when he disposed of his inter-
est in the property, and coming to
“Fernleigh,” a holding comprising
640 acres, taken up by him in 1893,
settled down to pastoral pursuits on
his own account. Subsequently Mr.
Bates availed himself of opportuni-
ties to add to his landed pos-
sessions by purchase and selection
until it approximated to 5,000
or 6,000 acres. The “Fernleigh”
country, which is watered by springs
and wells, providing an unfailing
supply for the stock, in every respect
has proved very suitable for the pur-
pose to which it has been applied by
Mr. Bates, who uses it chiefly as a
fattening estate for some 500 to 700
head of cattle, its dimensions being
too limited for breeding on an ex-
tensive scale. A considerable amount
of development work has been accom-
plished, the estate being fenced and
subdivided into a number of

interested himself in the public life
of the district, and is president of
the Biggenden Agricultural Society,
which office he has held since the

inception of that body in 1901. He
has been twice married, his first wife
being Lily, daughter of Mr. John
Reid, Gayndah, by whom he had
issue three sons. This lady died in
1905, and two years later Mr. Bates
espoused Bessie, daughter of the
late Thomas Brook, of “Lakeside,”
in the same district. In January,
the late Mr. Bates from Mr. W. H.
Walsh, of “Degilbo” Station, the
family left “Old Mingo,” which was

Bates, volunteered for active service
witli the Australian Imperial Forces
at the early age of barely 18 years,
and being accepted has since served


his country on French soil. This
brave young soldier, who displayed
undaunted courage in active warfare
was six weeks in the firing-line,
when he became a sufferer from
“trench feet,” and had to spend a
similar period in hospital.
THOMAS SMALLEY BELL,
“Dumgree” Station, is the youngest
son of the late Robert Bell, who left
his native Scotland in the forties,
and, coming to the New England
district of New South Wales, re-
mained there for a few years before
ultimately settling in Queensland.
Whilst resident in the Mother State
he had followed the calling of a
shepherd on a large pastoral run,
accepting drafts of sheep in lieu of
wages, his intention being eventually
to start operations on his own ac-
count. In this way, in course of
time, he found himself owner of two
fair-sized flocks, with which he came
to Queensland in the early fifties,
during the journey overland experi-
encing many hardships and priva-
tions. Shortly after arrival he took
up the country known as “East
Stowe,” about fourteen miles from
Gladstone, which he afterwards

disposed of, and it is now in the pos-
session of Messrs. Clark and John-
ston. This area he stocked with the
sheep brought from New South
Wales, and proceeded upon its de-
velopment on the best lines. Sub-
sequently, the “Dumgree” property,
now owned by Mr. Thomas Smalley
Bell, was purchased by the late
gentleman, who required additional
land to work with the “Stowe” acres ;
and about the year 1870 large num-
bers of sheep were sold to pioneers
of the western country, and the re-
mainder of the flocks were sent to
“Dumgree,” cattle being introduced
on to “East Stowe” in their stead.
The late Robert Bell, whose decease
occurred at Sydney about the year
1865, was twice married, his first
wife, who died before his departure
from Scotland, leaving one son
(James Bell) and three daughters.
Of these, the son and two daughters
remained unmarried, one daughter
becoming the wife of Mr. Richard
Buchanan, of “Riverstone” Station,
Cairns, Queensland. Mr. Bell’s
second wife was Miss Margaret
Pilkin, of Tenterfield, New South
Wales, and of this union there
was issue three sons and two
daughters. Mr. Thomas Smalley
Bell, the youngest son of the late
Robert Bell, was born in 1864, at
“Stowe” Station, and received his
education at the Brisbane Grammar
School. In 1880 he was given the
position of jackaroo at “Dumgree”
by his uncle, Mr. John Bell, who,
with Mr. Thomas Bell’s step-
brother, James, was carrying on the
estates in the family interest. Mr.
James Bell, who met his death while
mustering stock on the run, did
much to improve the breed of cattle
and horses in the district, and was
well known as the purchaser of the
noted stallion “Pyrrhus,” who won
many races in his day at both Syd-
ney and Melbourne. When Mr.
Thomas Smalley Bell attained to the
age of twenty-one, his uncle retired
from the management of “Dum-
gree,” and, since that date, its
affairs have been under control of the
subject of this review. “Dumgree”
is situated on the Dawes Range, and
consists of very mountainous coun-
try, watered by several creeks, and
timbered with ironbark, bloodwood,
and other useful timbers. Originally
it comprised an area of 500 square
miles, and this large run remained
in possession of the Bell family until
1890, the rent paid to the Crown
being about £lO per annum for each
block of 25 square miles. The run
now comprises 7,500 acres of free-
hold. The raising of Merino sheep
constituted the exclusive industry of
the station during the earlier years
of its occupation by the Bell family,
but these have now entirely given
way to cattle, the latter proving the
more profitable class of stock for the
district. A great deal of improve-
ment work has been completed, the

property being fenced and sub-
divided, and provided with the usual
stockyards, outbuildings, and dips.
In 1913 Mr. Bell purchased “Koo-
ingal,” about 40 miles distant from
“Dumgree,” a block of 38,000 acres

a merchant of Aberdeen, Scotland,
and was born in Aberdeenshire in

the year 1846, also receiving his
education in that County. From very
early days the lad displayed a keen
interest in everything connected with
Australia, and when he entered his
teens he succeeded in prevailing
upon his father to allow him to cross
“WESTWOOD” HOMESTEAD.
the ocean and begin his training in
the pastoral industry. A berth was
secured for him in a sailing vessel,
and during the four and a half
months’ voyage the ship encountered
severe storms and was becalmed for
several days whilst crossing the Line.
The vessel, however, at length landed
her passengers in safety at Sydney,
New South Wales, and subsequently
Mr. Maitland continued his journey
to Queensland, where he obtained a
position as jackaroo on “Gigoomgan”
cattle run. Here he made the
most of the excellent opportunities
afforded him, and during the 11
years spent on this property became
an expert stockman. In 1871 he
decided to launch out on his own
account, and with this purpose in
view took up the “Ellerslie” pro-
perty in the Wide Bay district,
where he entered upon the business
of breeding and fattening cattle.
The country before his advent was
totally unimproved, being unfenced
and possessing no buildings of any
description; but Mr. Maitland, by
his energy and industry soon brought
about marked changes in the aspect
of things, and continued on this pro-
perty for 16 years, meeting with
considerable success in his opera-
tions. At the close of this period he
disposed of the holding, and with
his family left Queensland on a trip
to the Old Country. After 15 months
abroad he returned to the land of his
adoption about the latter end of
1888, and shortly afterwards ac-
quired a selection at Teebar, com-
prising 5,000 acres of excellent un-
dulating land. This was the nucleus
of “Westwood,” his present estate,
which has since been enlarged by the
purchase of some 4,000 acres, mak-
ing in all a snug little pastoral pro-
perty of some 9,000 acres, watered
by Sandy Creek and its tributaries.
Like his former block, this holding
at the time of Mr. Maitland’s ad-
vent, was yet in its virgin state, and
the whole of the development work,
MR. J. EATON.
including many miles of fencing, a
large amount of ringbarking, dips,
yards, and all accessories for the
efficient working of a large cattle
proposition, has been due to the
vigorous policy from the first initi-
ated by the founder. Mr. Maitland
has taken some part in the public
affairs of the district, and prior to
his visit to England was a member
of the Tiara Shire Council. He was
gazetted to the Commission of the
Peace by the Philp Administration.
In 1871 he married Martha Mary,
eighth daughter of the late John
Eaton, of Teebar, one of the oldest
pioneers of the Wide Bay district,
who originally owned not only
“Teebar,’’ but also “Tiaro’’ and
“Neardie,” all pastoral properties
situated in this portion of the State.
Mr. Eaton grazed on his various
runs some 13,000 head of cattle,
which formed what was admitted to
be one of the finest herds in Queens-
land, and he also assisted in pioneer-
ing the sugar industry, forming in
1868 the ‘‘Eaton Vale Sugar Plant-
ation’’ with Kanaka labour, in which
venture he sank some £60,000 to
£70,000 sterling. He was a native
of New South Wales, having been
born on the Hawkesbury River in
the year 1810. He became second
Mayor of Maryborough in 1860, and
always was most keenly interested in
the progress of the Wide Bay dis-
trict. This fine old pioneer died in

_ JOHN INGLIS HENDERSON,
J.P., of “Littlemere,” near Glad-
stone, was born in 1846 at Fifeshire,
Scotland, and is a son of the late
James Henderson, of that County.
In 1854 the family emigrated to
Australia, and upon arrival at Bris-
bane, after a voyage of six months’
duration, the late Mr. Henderson
purchased “Tabragalba” Station, a
run of 75 square miles, situated near
Beaudesert. This holding originally
was in the hands of the late Dougald
Graham, and had been used by him
as a sheep station. Mr. Henderson,
however, found that the country
was not well suited to wool and
mutton production, and during the
ten years that he remained on “Tab-
ragalba,” he suffered heavy financial
losses. Disposing of his station, he
took up a property at Tambourine,
and the subject of this memoir,
being then 18 years of age, turned
his attention to droving pursuits,
making several trips from Queens-
land to New South Wales. After
some years of droving, Mr. John
MR. J. S. HENDERSON.
Inglis Henderson took a position in
1868 as stockman on a station in the
Castlereagh district of New South
Wales, whence he afterwards re-
moved to the Thargomindah district
fff2
in the south-west of Queensland for
three years, subsequently occupying
various similar positions until 1879.
At that date he became manager of
“Eulbertie” Station, on Cooper
MR. J. I. HENDERSON.
Creek, a property of 3,000 square
miles, carrying 8,000 head of cattle.
Here he remained for 14 years, in
which time the herd increased to
40,000. During his sojourn on
Cooper Creek he was brought into
close contact with the aboriginal
population, and succeeded in estab-
lishing relations with them of a
very satisfactory nature, his experi-
ence being that they made excellent
stockmen, and when treated firmly
and kindly were neither aggressive
nor savage. In 1893, having estab-
lished his financial position, he re-
linquished his post at “Eulbertie,”
and came to Brisbane, with the
intention of settling there. The
heavy blow dealt to so many by the
big Bank smash, however, counted
him among its victims, and his
money being all invested in Bank
shares and fixed deposit, he was left
quite without liquid capital. This
necessitated a fresh start, and in
1894 Mr. Henderson accepted the
appointment of manager of “Mil-
ton” Station, the property of the
Queensland National Bank, situated
in the valley of the Boyne, where
he remained for 17 years. “Milton”
station at that period embraced
practically the whole of the Boyne
watershed, but during Mr. Hen-
derson’s term of management
smaller selectors began to encroach
over its boundaries, with the result
at the time of writing it has
been reduced to one-tenth of its
former area. In 1910 Mr. Hender-
son’s health being indifferent, he
relinquished the management of
“Milton,” and purchasing “Little-
mere,” an out-station of that pro-
perty, took up his residence in his
present home, since when he has
devoted his energies to farming and
grazing pursuits. “Littlemere” com-
prises 1,000 acres of river flats,
stretching out to the ranges at the
back, and lies within 3 miles of the
Littlemere railway-station. In addi-
tion to the property Mr. Henderson
owns a grazing farm on the Burnett
River, which he acquired in 1896,
consisting of 12,000 acres of undu-
lating granite country, well watered
and highly improved, with a carry-
ing capacity of a beast to seven
acres. He is actuated by a keen
public spirit, and has served his
fellow-members of the community
as a magistrat-e of 40 years’ stand-
ing. He is an active member of the
Port Curtis Agricultural and Pas-
toral Association, and occupied the
presidential position in connection
with this body for 10 years. He is
also a director of the Gladstone Meat
Works of Queensland. He is inter-
ested in sport, and is a member of
the Mary Peaks Jockey Club. Mr.
Henderson married in 1883 Joseph-
ine, daughter of Mr. Isaac Seymour,
late of the Logan River district, and
there are two sons and one daughter
of the marriage. The elder son, Mr.
Seymour Henderson, occupies the

position of manager of “Milton”
Station, and the younger, Inglis
John, manages “Ritavale,” the
property owned by his father on
the Burnett River.


The Late THOMAS BENJAMIN
VICARY, of “Strathmuir,” near
Marlborough, is a descendant of a
long line of his name, the members of
which have distinguished themselves
MR. THOMAS WILLIAM VICARY.
as army officers for generations
past. His grandfather, Captain
Vicary, in the early thirties was
stationed in Tasmania, in charge of
the convict settlement there, prior
to this date having been for some
time in India, where his son, the late
Thomas William Vicary, father of
the gentleman under review, was
born. Mr. T. W. Vicary came to
Victoria in the forties with Messrs.
Paterson Brothers, and became
identified with pastoral pursuits,
first holding a position as jackaroo
on a station owned by the latter
firm, whom he afterwards served for
some time in the capacity of over-
seer. In the fifties he launched out
on his own account, becoming the
proprietor of “Yan-Yan-Gurt” Sta-
tion and other pastoral holdings in
that State. Whilst engaged in the
development of these interests he
made a trip to Queensland, in com-
pany with Mr. P. F. Macdonald,
and joined an exploration party,
including that gentleman and the
late Mr. J. A. and Sir John Macart-
ney, which followed in Leichhardt’s
tracks in the vicinity of the Mac-
kenzie River. During this expedi-
tion various experiences were en-
countered. A member of the party
went mad through over-exertion,
and having fired at one of the black-
boys, wounding him in the arm, took
to the bush, and although due
search was made for the unfortu-
nate man he was never seen again.
On one occasion, whilst camping out,
Mr. Vicary with his revolver shot
a crow perched on top of a tree,
and subsequently was told by the
blacks that at the very moment he
fired a lurking native was upon the
point of spearing him, but being
impressed by the accurate shooting
of his intended victim, decamped
forthwith. Large leases of country
on the Mackenzie River were taken
up by Mr. Vicary, who also acquired
the “Canoona” run from the former
owners, Messrs. Ramsay and Gaden,
and realizing £30,000 on the sale of
his Victorian properties, he trans-
ferred his attention to his interests
in the northern Colony, which only
shortly before had taken upon itself
the responsibility of self-govern-
ment. “Canoona” embraced some
500 to 600 square miles in area, and
after stocking this country Mr.
Vicary placed a manager in charge,
and proceeded upon the development
of his other holdings. Unfortu-
nately, through mismanagement he
sustained heavy losses, and ulti-
mately found himself in considerably
reduced circumstances. Mr. Thomas
Benjamin Vicary was taken into
partnership by his father in the
“Canoona” Run in 1878, and after
the death of the latter gentleman —
which took place on May 13, 1900—-
he undertook the administration of
the station on behalf of the family,
and continued there until about
1901, when it was agreed to dispose
of the holding, Mr. Arthur Mac-
donald being the purchaser. Mr.
Vicary purchased the whole of the
stock, and removed it to “Wood-
stock” Station, then in possession of
the family. Later he sold “Wood-
stock” to Messrs. Mayne & Shaw,
"STRATHMUIR" HOMESTEAD.
and in 1912 acquired “Collaroy”
Station, in conjunction with his
nephew, Mr. H. T. Bridson, the
present owner of “Woodstock.” Tu
1914 the “Collaroy” estate was sold
at a handsome profit, and in the
same year Mr. Yicary bought
“Strathmuir, ” near Marlborough,
with about 1,000 head of breeding
cattle, from Mr. R. F. Duncan, of
MR. THOMAS BENJAMIN VICARY.
Rockhampton. This transaction was
scarcely completed when he was
prostrated by an attack of pneu-
monia, to which he succumbed
before he had had time to take up
his residence in the new home, his
death taking place at Rockhampton
on November 12, 1914. “Strath-
muir,” which is now occupied by
Mr. Vicary’s widow and family, is
a well-improved property of 20,000
acres, watered by creeks and wells,
the latter being fitted with wind-
mills and up-to-date arrangements
for watering the stock, which at the
present time numbers about 1,300
head of mixed cattle. Mrs. Ethel
Vicary, who became the wife of the
late Thomas Benjamin Vicary in
1912, is a daughter of Mr. P. Han-
sen, of Yaamba, the issue of the
union being two children.


JOHN HENDERSON, “Inver-
coe,” Colosseum, is the third son of
the late Donald Henderson, who
was born in the year 1838 at Glen-
coe, Scotland, where his father was
MR. DON. HENDERSON.
engaged in farming pursuits. In
1858 the young Scotsman, then 20
years of age, decided to come to
Australia, and upon arrival pro-
ceeded to Gippsland, Victoria, where
he spent some years in obtaining
the experience necessary to fit him
for independent enterprise. Even-
tually he travelled northward to
Queensland, and made his advent to
Maryborough about 1860, becoming
identified with the timber industry
in that district for some three years.
In 1863, being ambitious to start
in a larger way, he selected land at
Pialba, and formed this property on
his own account with a fair measure
of success. In 1869 he married
Agnes McGregor, by whom he had
"INVERCOE."
a large family of 11 sons and daugh-
ters, all of whom are still surviving.
After 15 years at Pialba the grow-
ing claims of his family caused him
to realize the necessity of enlarging
his operations, and to achieve this
end he began to look about him for
a more extensive holding. As a re-
sult, in 1878 be selected 3,500 acres
on the old “Miriam Vale” run,
which had been subdivided for
closer settlement, and in the follow-
ing year the farm at Pialba was
disposed of, and the family came to
reside at their new home, to which
was given the name of “Invercoe,”
which it still retains. Here the late
Mr. Henderson turned his atten-
tion to cattle grazing, afterwards
extending his operations to sheep,
the former class of stock being at
that period somewhat of a drug in
the market, and commanding very
low prices. As an instance of the
low value of cattle at the time, it
may be stated that the late Mr.
Henderson on one occasion pur-
chased 300 bullocks at £2 10s. per
head, and after keeping them for
about 12 months to fatten he took
them to Brisbane, where he sold a
portion of them for £2 12s. 6d. per
head, allowing a margin of only
2s. 6d. on the purchase price. The
market proving so unsatisfactory,
he decided to return the balance to
the station, but on the road was
able to dispose of them at £2
17s. 6d. per head, and congratu-
lated himself upon coming so well
out of the transaction ! Mr. Hen-
derson eventually established him-
self as a successful grazier, and
upon his death, which occurred in
1912, he left a fine pioneering record
behind him. Mr. John Henderson
was born at Pialba in 1875, and
came with his parents to “Invercoe”
when about five years of age. He
received his education by private
tuition at the homestead, and while
still quite a child became familiar
with pastoral operations, under the
guidance of his father. As his years
increased he began to take an active
part in the general work of the
station, and in especial developed a
great aptitude with horses, his par-
ticular delight being to act as
breaker-in of the young and most
high-spirited stock. In 1907 he
accepted the appointment of man-
ager of “Thornhill” Station on be-
half of Messrs. Gibson Bros., which
position he resigned in 1909 to take
MR. JOHN HENDERSON.
over the management of “Invercoe”
for his father, who was then in fail-
ing health. After the demise of the
late Donald Henderson in 1912, he
continued to administer the affairs
of the station in the interests of the
family, and still retains the reins of
control. “Invercoe” has experi-
enced various increases in area since
it first came into possession of the
Henderson family, and at the pre-
sent time consists of some seven or
eight thousand acres of undulating
country, chiefly of granite forma-
tion, well watered by the Baffle and
Colosseum Creeks and sundry tribu-
tary streams. It is thoroughly well
improved, being provided with all
the necessary stockyards and out-
buildings, a cattle dip, and every
requirement of a properly-conducted
pastoral property. It has a carrying
capacity of about 1,000 head of
cattle, and the breed chiefly
favoured is the Hereford, a fine
stamp of cattle having steadily
risen during the past 15 or 20 years,
the attention of the present manager
is principally devoted to this class
of stock. Mr. John H enderson is a
keen sport, and has scored some
notable successes with his horses at
various country meetings. He is
fond of athletic exercise, and is a
marksman of no mean merit, also
being socially popular, and in sym-
pathy with philanthropic effort.


GEORGE HERBERT HORNE,
of “Rockfield” Station via Glad-
stone, was born in Surrey, England,
in 1863, and is a son of the late
George Horne, of Hereford, in that
County, where he carried on busi-
ness as a brewer. The gentleman
under review was educated at the
Cathedral School, Hereford, one of
the oldest scholastic establishments
in England, which celebrated its
500th birthday during Mr. Horne’s
time as a student there. In 1879 he
left school, and subsequently was
associated with his father in the
brewing business until 1885, when
he decided to come to Australia to
join a brother who had taken that
step the previous year. After a
nine-weeks’ journey, via the Suez
Canal, by the steamer “Duke of
Westminster,” Mr. Horne made his
advent to Rockhampton, Queens-
land, where he was met by his
brother, and shortly afterwards
secured a position as jackaroo on a
pastoral property. He was employed
in this capacity on several stations
successively, and in course of time,
having become an expert cattle man,
he entered upon the life of a drover
in conjunction with his brother. In
this connection some long trips were
made by Mr, Horne, who on one
occasion overlanded stock from
“Taunton” Station, on Baffle Creek,
to “Coonamble,” New South Wales,
a distance of from 800 to 900 miles,
the journey extending over four
months. In 1890 the brothers took
up in partnership “Rockfield,” an
area of the old “Calliope” Station,
consisting of 4,500 acres, which they
secured on a 30-years’ lease. At a
later date the tenure was changed
to that of agricultural farms, with
the right to convert a proportion of
the land to freehold at 15s. per
acre, the yearly rental (4|d. per
acre) being reckoned as part of the
purchase cost. Ring-barking opera-
tions were initiated at an early date,
and as a result the country, which
at the time of its acquisition by Mr.
Horne was practically waterless,
began to show surface water in many
places, creeks which have proved
permanent appearing and maintain-
ing a steady flow. Fencing and other
improvements also received atten-
tion, and considerable success has
attended the efforts of the partners
on this property. In 1898 the broth-
ers took up land under the 1897
Act, their choice falling on 7,000
acres situated on “Galloway Plains.”
This was undulating, granite coun-
try, well watered by springs, which
became more copious in their flow
after the necessary denudation of
timber was accomplished. The run
soon proved itself highly suitable for
cattle. The block, however, had

been only a short time in possession
of the firm when it was agreed to
dispose of half the area and to dis-
solve partnership, Mr. Horne’s
brother continuing to work the re-
maining portion. In 1910 a part-
nership was again entered into
between the brothers for the pur-
chase of “Cluen,” a property near
Clermont, embracing 23,000 acres.
This they held for three years, and
sold in 1913 at a satisfactory figure.
In 1914 Mr. Horne purchased

13,200 acres, with an additional 960
acres freehold. Originally this was

part of the “Kooingal” run, and it
extends over a tract of black soil
and volcanic ridges, plentifully
grassed, with an easy carrying
capacity of a beast to 10 acres. It
is watered by several wells, which
are fitted with lifting engines and
windmills for pumping purposes,
while substantial fences, stockyards,
and dips are among the other
improvements, water being laid on
to the yards. A fine herd of Here-
ford cattle is run on “Crowsdale,”
and expert attention is given to
breeding, a large number of calves
being branded annually. In addi-
tion, Mr. Horne breeds blood horses,
owning some fine thoroughbred
brood mares, which until recently
he has mated with the imported
English sire, “Skopos,” winner of
premier honours at Brisbane, Rock-
hampton, Bundaberg, and several
other show rings. The former owner
of this sire (the Hon. James White,
of New South Wales) refused 2,000
guineas for him after he was landed
in Australia, and several of his
progeny have distinguished them-
selves by winning races in various
parts of Australia. Mr, Horne has
owned various good performers,
which have won many local races,
and at the time of writing he has
a fine specimen of a “Skopos”
filly in training, of which he
is hoping great things. He is well
known on the turf, and is a mem-
ber of the Rockhampton Race Club,
the Dawson Amateur Picnic Race
Club, and was for eight years sec-
retary to the Port Curtis Race Club.
A well-known figure in all worthy
movements set afoot in the district,
Mr. Horne is patriotic and philan-
thropic, and withal a “good sport.”
An enthusiastic motorist, he makes
frequent journeys in his car over the
Dawes and Callide Ranges, cover-
ing in minimum time the distance
between his station, and negotiating
gradients, several of which are 1
in 3 for 100 yards at a stretch. He
married in 1897, Annie, daughter of
Mr. Samuel Farmer, of “Hazel-
dene,” by whom he has issue three
sons and one daughter.


ROBERT LIVINGSTONE
BOYD, J.P., of “Wetheron,”
Byrnestown, was born at Logan
River in 1885, and is the second
son of the late R. A. Boyd, of
MR. R. L. BOYD.
“Lara” Estate. The latter was born
in Victoria in 1858. He was the
eldest son of the late Captain Boyd,
of the Imperial Forces, and came
to Queensland with his brother
when both were young men and took
up country at “Terriboo,” in the
west, and later on settled down at
“Lara.” Mr. Robert Boyd received
his education first from a governess
and afterwards at Mark’s Boys’
School, Brisbane. He finished at the
Brisbane Grammar School. On leav-
ing school Mr. Boyd entered the
workshops of the Electric Supply Co.
of Brisbane, in order to qualify as
an electrical engineer, but two years
later he became a jackaroo on
“Broraelton” Station, the property
R. L. Brabazon, of “Wyaralong”
Station, his experience there includ-
ing dairying. In 1905 he left
“Wyaralong” to take up droving,
which he followed for about a year,
including one trip with sheep which
occupied six months. Early in 1907
Mr. Boyd took over the management
MR. R. A. BOYD.
of “Conondale” Station. That run
comprised 14,000 acres of freehold
and 100 square miles of Crown
leaseholds. Just prior to Mr. Boyd’s
advent large estates were being cut
into farms and butter factories were
being established. “Conondale” had
then been acquired by a company
and cut up into suitable areas for
dairy farmers, whilst a creamery had
been erected at a cost of nearly
£3,000. But of the many blocks
offered only one found a purchaser,
and “Conondale” reverted to raising
beefers. This work was entrusted to
Herefords in Queensland, and 3,000
remained. At the end of five
years young Boyd himself pur-
chased 1,000 acres, which included
the homestead. He was then 26

years of age, and the purchase com-
pleted the winding-up of the estate.
The company who had employed Mr.
Boyd reposed so much faith in him
that during the whole of his career
with them they only visited him
once, and then but for a few hours.
His suggestions were acted on and
his facts and figures accepted with-
out reservation or enquiry. After
buying the property Mr. Boyd
leased it to a tenant and bought the
“Wetheron” homestead back. Here
he entered into the business of
dairying. The “Wetheron” house
was in an excellent state of preserva-
tion, and it, has been completely
renovated by Mr. Boyd. In 1912
Mr. Boyd married Dorothy, the
youngest daughter of the Hon. A. J.
Thynne, and has issue one son and
of his grandfather, the late C. L.

his majority. The remnant of the
“Durundur” herd stayed on the
estate. These cattle originally held
the reputation of being the finest

interested in sport, particularly in
tennis, football, and shooting. He
is a director of the Gayndah Dairy
Co., and in all movements for the


advancement of the district Mr.
Boyd is counted on as a leader. He
has been a Justice of the Peace since
his twenty-first birthday, having
been appointed by the Kidston
Government.
JOHN CAMPBELL, “Kilbur-
nie” Station, near Gladstone, is a
native of Ayr, Scotland, in the
vicinity of which city his father, the
late William Campbell, owned a pro-
perty known as “Vow Farm.” In
early boyhood Mr. John Campbell
was taken to live with an uncle at
Ballymena, Ireland, and at the con-
clusion of his schooldays, which he
passed in the North of Ireland, he
went to work on the farm owned by
his relative, where he continued
until about 25 years of age. Having
decided to emigrate, be took pas-
sage by the ship “Great Queens-
land,” which encountering bad
weather, occupied 100 days on the

Campbell landed at Brisbane in
September, 1873, and after a brief
stay in the capital proceeded to
Maryborough, where for some
months he found occupation in
punting sugarcane on the river for
the planters. Gympie, with its
mining possibilities, next attracted
him, but the Palmer Diggings, on

far north. This project, however,
was abandoned, and Mr. Campbell,
travelling to Gladstone, via Rock-
hampton, eventually arrived at
“Dumgree” Station, where he
entered into a three-years’ engage-
ment with the late Mr. Bell. At that
period the country surrounding
Gladstone was mainly devoted to
sheep, cattle having only just begun

to make their appearance there, and
Mr. Campbell became thoroughly
expert in handling the flocks. In
1879 Mr. Bell decided to offer his
sheep for sale, and 1,600 maiden
ewes and 50 rams were secured by
Mr. Campbell, who rented a portion
of the run for grazing purposes.
Three years later be disposed of
these, making an excellent sale, and
in 1883 he took up on lease from the
Crown the nucleus of his present
“Kilburnie” Station, an area of
sandstone tableland country, dipping
to the south, within 10 miles of the
Calliope coalfields, the seam of which
is held by Government geologists to
underlie the country held by Mr.
Campbell. This station is watered
by Oakey Creek, and during the
period of his occupation Mr. Camp-
bell lias devoted a great deal of
attention to conservation work, with
the result that five dams, each 400
yards in length, 30 yards wide, with
a holding capacity of 16 feet of
water, have placed the question of
water supply beyond anxiety. The
timber is chiefly ironbark and blood-
wood, of which some 7,000 acres
have been ring-barked, while the big
drought of 1902 killed huge areas of
open forest. The carrying capacity
of the run is estimated at from 2,500
to 3,000 head of cattle, and Mr.
Campbell has achieved a signal suc-
cess in his principal branches of in-
dustry, notably in breeding draught
horses and Hereford cattle of
superior type. His enterprise flour-
ishing, in 1903 he secured 10,000
acres of country under the 1884
Land Act, to be used as a grazing
farm, and in subsequent years in-
creased this area to 25,000 acres,
its situation, about 9 miles distant
from “Kilburnie” homestead, mak-
ing it easily workable from the latter
place. This property is undulating
granite country, through which Bell
Creek, Smoky Creek, and Ten-mile
Creek, all permanent streams, wind
their way, in seasons of the most
severe drought plenty of good water
always being procurable. There are
also four bores, representing be-
tween them 900 feet of boring, and
an aggregate flow of 2,200 gallons
per hour. A herd of from
1,500 to 2,000 Herefords is
depastured on the estate.
Mr. Campbell is an enthusi-
astic breeder of draught
horses, and among the fine
sires of the stud special
mention may be made of
the famous stallion “Black
Prince.” In 1874 Mr.
Campbell was married to
Elizabeth, daughter of the
late Thomas Bridges, of
Bushmills, in the north of
Ireland, and he has three
sons and five daughters.
The third son, John Camp-
bell Gordon, in 1917, during
the Great War, was serving
with the Australian Imperial
Forces, in the Light Horse, and was
in action in Palestine, whilst a
daughter, after having been engaged
as a nurse in Egypt and England,
was invalided home.

ANGUS CARLYLE GORDON,
“Wyroona,” Gayndah, is the
youngest son of Mr. Henry Gordon,
of “Beaumont” and “Deveron”
Stations, near Tiaro, the descendant
MR. ANGUS CARLYLE GORDON.
of an old and well-known Scottish
family, which has contributed some
brilliant members to the legal pro-
fession in that country. The gentle-
man under review was born on
“Deveron” Station in 1884, and
spent the whole of his early child-
hood on the homestead. He received
his education at Nudgee College,
where his studies included a course
in chemistry and also one in
Nudgee Manuscript Journal, an
organ conducted by the students.
After having passed with honours
the University Junior Examination
he left school at the age of 19 years
and joined Mr. Robinson, a sur-
veyor, with a view to continuing his
training in that direction. After
12 months, however, he decided to
relinquish this ambition and to de-
vote his attention to pastoral and
agricultural pursuits, and accord-
ingly, in conjunction with his bro-
ther, he became engaged in the
dairying industry at “Beaumont,”
a portion of which run was allotted
to them by their father for this
purpose. Here the brothers carried
on the business of dairy farmers for
about three years, milking about
100 cows daily, which work was
greatly facilitated by the use of a
decided to relinquish dairying, and
in pursuance of this decision the
dairy herd and plant was sold. In
1908 Mr. Angus Gordon acquired
the grazing homestead “Wyroona,”
formerly a portion of the “Ban
Ban’’ Station area, and comprising
6,500 acres of undulating country,
upon which he commenced opera-
tions on his own account. Since
that period several other blocks
have been added to the property
by purchase or selection, and to-day
about 20,000 acres are included in
the area known as “Wyroona.” The
property is watered by several good
watercourses, including Walloon
Creek and the headwaters of Deep
Creek and Boogoorootommy Creek,
while various wells have been sunk
in suitable places. The country has

its boundaries. Mr. Gordon breeds
heavily in preference to purchasing
stores, and he has achieved a suc-
cess commensurate with his enter-
prise and endeavour. The public
affaire of the district have com-
manded a share of his attention,
and he has identified himself in a
practical manner with all move-
ments tending to its advancement.
He has always been a keen sports-
man, cricket being the special game
in which he has personally excelled
ever since his youth, when as a
member of the Nudgee College
Cricket and Football Club he was
highly esteemed by his compeers.
He is a member of the Maryborough
and Gayndah cricket clubs, and has
played for the former district in the
country association fixtures at Bris-
bane and elsewhere, batting being
his particular forte, although he is
useful as a change bowler. He mar-
ried in 1913 Josephine, fifth daugh-
ter of Mr. Robert Brightwell, of

“THEBARTON” Estate, Bur-
nett district, under the general
management of Mr. Henry Edgar
Mills Leggett, who owns the pro-
perty in conjunction with his father
and brother, is a portion of the vast
tract of country formerly known as
MR. H. E. M. LEGGETT.
“Ideraway” Estate. It was taken
up in 1884 by the Messrs. Leggett,
who were practically the pioneer
settlers on this larve area which had
lain idle for 10 years subsequent to
its subdivision for closer settlement
purposes. Inspired by a vigorous
spirit of enterprise, they embarked on
the work of grazing and crop-raising
on hitherto unimproved country,
MR. E. C. LEGGETT.
neither fencing, ring-barking, nor
water conservation having been
attempted prior to their advent on
the area which now presents the
appearance of a highly-improved
grazing and agricultural farm. The
soil consists of a black loam, which
grows every class of fodder and
grain crops to perfection, corn
planted by the Messrs. Leggett hav-
ing produced from 80 to 100 bushels
to the acre, while a second crop
grown on the same area after the
first had been harvested reached 15
feet in height and yielded 60 to
70 bushels to the acre within the
same year. Citrus fruits also thrive
well in this locality, and a number
of very fine trees of this description
flourish near the homestead. As a
result of the efforts of the Leggett
family the extraordinary productive
qualities of the soil have been so
effectually demonstrated that the
agricultural areas of “Thebarton”
are regarded as a first-class object
lesson for intending settlers, who
frequently receive advice to inspect
that property to be convinced of the
wisdom of throwing in their lot in
this highly-favoured district. The
Leggetts came to Queensland from
South Australia, the family origin-
ally emigrating from England as far
back as 1835, when the late William
Leggett arrived in Adelaide, shortly
afterwards obtaining employment on
the works of the General Post Office,
then in course of erection. Subse-
quently the late gentleman entered
the service of the South Australian
Pastoral Company, and removed to
Woodside, where, it is interesting to
note, his wife was the second white
woman, her sole predecessor being
Mrs. Breckenbridge, the station
manager’s wife. In 1851, with his
12-year-old son, Mr. Edward Crox-
ton Leggett, he proceeded overland
by bullock team to the Bendigo gold
diggings, and having surmounted all
the difficulties occasioned by thick
timber, deep bogs, and troublesome
blacks, the party upon their arrival
pegged out a claim, and soon after-
wards were rewarded by a little haul
of 14 oz. of gold. This claim, how-
ever failed to justify its promise,
and was abandoned for others, all of
which in turn proved alike dis-
appointing, and eventually the bul-
locks and drays had to be sold to
provide the necessary capital for
continuing the search. After nine
months of almost fruitless toil the
return journey of 500 miles was per-
formed on foot, the baggage being
carried on a little cart drawn by a
ponv. and thenceforward the Leg-
getts devoted themselves to farming
at Woodside on their own account.
Mr. Edward Croxton Leggett mar-
ried in 1861, and taking up an

80-acre block of land in that district,
continued there until 1863, when
he removed to Mount Gambier, in
the south-eastern portion of South
Australia, and there carried on


farming and grazing for some 18
years. In 1861 he disposed of his
interests in the Central State, and
set forth with horses and drays to
travel overland from Mount Gam-
bier to Queensland, accompanied by
his wife, daughter, and two sons.
The route traversed was across the
Murray River at Echuca, and
thence through Burke to Barringun,
on the Queensland border, the War-
rego district being their ultimate
destination. The first land taken up
by the newcomers was a selection on
“Tickleman” Station area, but after
three years in this locality the fam-
ily again “trekked” a distance of
500 miles to the Burnett district,
where they secured the nucleus of
their present “Thebarton” Estate.
As the sons grew to manhood they
turned their attention to the
acquirement of landed holdings on
their own account, and the agricul-
tural blocks taken up by them,
added to the original area selected
on the first arrival of the family in
the Burnett district, formed the
present valuable estate now owned
and worked by the three partners.
HENRY EDGAR MILLS LEG-
GETT, who acts as general manager
of “Thebarton,” is the younger son
of Mr. Edward Croxton Leggett,
and was born at Mount Gambier,
South Australia, on October 8,
1872. He received his primary edu-
cation in that State, completing his
scholastic studies in Queensland.
From an early age he was accus-
tomed to assist his father on the
home farm, and showed considerable
aptitude for the duties with which
he was entrusted, which led in
course of time, when he arrived at
man’s estate, to his taking over the
general management of “Thebar-
ton” Estate, which he still retains.
Mr. Leggett is distinguished for his
keen public spirit, and although the
affairs of the estate claim the greater
share of his time and attention, he
has taken a prominent part in mat-
ters connected with the advancement
of the district. Scarcely a move-
ment of importance has been set
afoot in that part of the State with
which he has not been associated,
and alike as vice-president since its in-
ception of the Gayndah Agricultural
Society, member of the Rawbelle
Shire Council, Public School com-
mitteeman, or president of the Reid’s
Creek Rifle Club, he has rendered
yeoman service to his fellow-citizens.
He is a Justice of the Peace,
having received his commission from
the Morgan Government, is con-
nected with the Oddfellows’ Order
and other benefit lodges, and a keen
sportsman, holds membership on the
committee of the Gayndah Race
Club, in which he generally acts as
steward, while he is also very keen
on cricket.
FRITZ LOESKOW, of “Cedar
Grove,” Bororen, is a son of the
late Edward Loeskow, a native of
“La Belle France,” who left the
land of his fathers with Australia
as an objective, in the year 1870,
and, landing at Brisbane, settled on
the Albert River, where he became
engaged in mixed farming and
cattle-raising on a few hundreds of

acres of country. The holding taken
up on his arrival by the late gen-
tleman became the birthplace of all
his children, and the subject of our
memoir, Mr. Fritz Loeskow —who
first saw the light there in 1877 —
spent all his early life on his
father’s farm, receiving his education
at the local Public School. He con-
tinued to assist in the work of the
holding until his attainment of the
age of twenty-five years, when, the
late Mr. Loeskow’s death having oc-
curred in the previous year, he
determined to strike out for him-
self on more ambitious lines. In
accordance with this decision, he
disposed of his share of the home
property, and proceeded to the
Burnett district, making a halt at
Maroondan, twenty-four miles from
Bundaberg, on the railway line to
Mount Perry. He leased a block of
land at Bingera, which he worked
successfully as a cane-growing pro-
position for three years, when he
disposed of the holding. At the
same time he took up another
block of 2,000 acres on Oyster
Creek, and started cattle-raising,
being attended with satisfactory
'financial results almost from the
beginning. He remained in the Ma-
roondan district for six years in all,
and in 1907 sold his property at a
satisfactory figure. Proceeding to
Bororen, he purchased “Durru-
mutt,” an estate comprising over
4,000 acres, which he applied to
grazing purposes. Here he engaged
in the breeding and fattening of
cattle on an extensive scale. Suc-
cess attending his efforts as time
went on he purchased considerable
real estate in the neighbourhood,
and at the present time owns a
number of valuable properties in
the township of Bororen, including
the hotel, stores, and private resi-
dences. In 1911 he acquired pos-
session of “Cedar Grove,” a prop-
erty of 320 acres, where he erected
his present home, from which
centre he administers the varied
interests requiring his personal sup-
ervision. It is Mr. Loeskow’s in-
tention to make a special feature of
the breeding of Herefords, and in
pursuit of this object he has se-
cured a number of pedigreed bulls
from the leading herds in the Com-
monwealth with which he has laid
the foundation of a first-class stud.
In connection with his other enter-
prises may be mentioned a scrub
farm, 320 acres in extent, situated
in the vicinity of Booyal on the Isis
branch railway, to which Mr. Loes-
kow has devoted a considerable
amount of attention. This area,
which has been cleared and sown
with Rhodes grass, is utilised as a
fattening station, and in normal
seasons is capable of pasturing some
690 beasts the whole year round.
Mr. Loeskow also owns several graz-
ing paddocks of extensive aggregate
acreage in various parts of the
State, and in addition to breeding
cattle he is a buyer of stock on a
large scale, in this department
handling on an average 2,000 head
per annum. A keen sportsman, he

racing, this being his favourite

Loeskow has owned some well-bred
horses, and at the present time
“Mac’s Counsel” and “Taffy the
Second” hold pride of place in
his estimation. His stables have
also sheltered some very fine sires,
principally of the Clydesdale type;
among which may be mentioned
“Noble Duke,” “Here I Go,” and
'“Paymaster.” “Here I Go” se-

rifle shot, and recorded top score
at the meeting held at Bororen
early in 1917. He is regarded gen-
erally as “a good sort,” and has
earned a well-deserved popularity
by the cordial support he has given

WILLIAM JAMES DOHERTY,
“Harriott Hills” Station, Gayndah,
was born at “Rosedale” Station,
Queensland, in the year 1857, and
is the son of the late William
MR. W. J. DOHERTY.
Doherty, well known among pas-
toralists of the Burnett district as
an expert sheep man at the period
when that part of the country was
mainly given over to sheep stations.
Mr. Doherty, sen., took a personal
part in the education of his son,
subsequently placing him under a
tutor, with whom he concluded his
scholastic studies. At the age of 15
he proceeded to “Coonambula” Sta-
tion to gain an acquaintance with
sheep-raising under the guidance of
Mr. W. H. McCord, the owner of
that property. The introduction of
spear grass, however, rendered sheep
an unprofitable proposition, and
cattle finally displacing the mutton
and wool industry on “Coonambula”
young Doherty perforce had his at-
tention turned in that direction,
with the result that he rapidly
transferred his interest from the
flock to the herd, finding the latter
a much more engrossing object of
study. After sjjending some years
on this station he decided to obtain
a wider experience of the Queens-
land country, and travelling as far
as “Dalgangal” Station, near Eids-
vold, in the Burnett district, was
here offered the post of stockman,
which he filled for some time, after-
wards becoming sub-manager, and
remaining in all on the station for
12 years. Mr. Doherty indulges in
stirring recollections of what were
known in those days as wild scrub-
bers—namely, cattle which had
escaped from the station mobs and
run wild, which, with their mongrel-
bred progeny, only ventured out of
the scrub late in the evening or
through the night, usually in search
of water; and of the hunts which
were set on foot to try and exter-
minate these outlaws, in the course
of which many hairbreadth and
thrilling escapes were experi-
enced. In those days Mr. George
Hooper, then manager of “Dalgan-
gal” Station, and Mr. W. J.
Doherty were the only expert rifle
shots in the district. With the de-
parture of the former gentleman the
whole of the shooting fell to Mr.
Doherty, and as this was generally
done while galloping at full speed
through the roughest of country,
using the rifle with one hand and
reloading without drawing rein, the
attendant risks were very great in-
deed. Leaving “Dalgangal,” Mr.
Doherty visited his parents at
“Mount Debateable” Station, and
the Eidsvold gold discoveries occur-
ring about that time, he decided to
visit the field, with the result that
the gold fever entered his veins and
he became an ardent prospector
after the yellow metal. He was suc-
cessful in locating several reefs, not-
ably the Stockman Reef, which at
first yielded large quantities of gold,
and the Lady Anne, which dur-
ing 12 months of working gave a
percentage of over 4 oz. to the ton.
Eventually the reefs showed signs of
petering out, and Mr. Doherty,
seeking farther afield, discovered the
Squatter Mine, some 12 miles dis-
tant. This also was rich at the sur-
face, but becoming associated with
"HARRIOTT HILLS” HOMESTEAD.
antimony, which rendered it difficult
or impossible to recover the gold
under ordinary amalgamation with
mercury, had likewise to be aban-
doned. In search of fresh adven-
turse, Mr. Doherty turned to drov-
ing, and delivered several mobs of
cattle to various stations in New
South Wales from Queensland.
About 1893, with the purpose to
settle down, he selected his present
holding, “Harriott Hills,” which
has been increased from time to time
by the addition of grazing leases,
and set to work to improve this
holding by ring-barking, fencing,
etc., until at the present time it has
been brought to an advanced state
of development, and is affording Mr.
Doherty substantial returns for his
years of perseverance and thrift.
Among the other departments of his
industry he has attained great suc-
cess in the cultivation of citrus
fruits, and has been awarded several
prizes for exhibits of this class at
the Gayndah Agricultural Show.
He has interested himself in public
affairs and served as a Shire coun-
cillor for Rawbelle from 1898 to
1904, also being elected a commit-
teeman of the Gayndah Agricultural
and Horticultural Society, in which
capacity he took an active part in
organizing the annual show; while
all movements for improving the
condition of settlers on the land have
always received his strong support.
Mr. Doherty devotes his leisure
hours to gardening pursuits, in
which form of relaxation he finds
much pleasure. He is also keenly
interested in shooting, having known
many splendid marksmen among the
early stockmen who took part in the
extermination of the wild scrub
cattle earlier referred to.


STUART ANDREW BARRETT,
“Drumburle” Station, Banana, is
a son of Mr. Patrick Joseph
Barrett, of Inglewood, who came
to Queensland in the year 1885,
to take over the management of
“Whetstone” Station on behalf of
the late Frederick Badgery. In
1892, at the age of 15, young
Barrett was given the position of
jackaroo on this property, and dur-
ing the seven years that he remained
on the station in that capacity he
became highly proficient in the man-
agement and handling of cattle.
O O
Leaving “Whetstone,” he trans-
ferred his services to “Prairie”
Station, on the Dawson River, then
in the hands of the Queensland
Investment Company, and in 1901
made a further removal to “Moura”
Station, the property of Messrs.
D. C. McConnel & Sons, where he
continued as jackaroo for about six
months. At the close of this period,
in 1902 he accepted the post of head
stockman at “Drumburle,” which
originally was a lease taken up from
the Crown by the late Mr. Morton,
and comprised about 35 square
miles of country. The block was
purchased in 1880 by Mr. R. A.
Purvis, who carried it on mainly as
a cattle run. Mr. Barrett gradually
assumed full control of the stock on
“Drumburle,” and in 1903 Mr.
MR. R. A. PURVIS.
Purvis appointed him to the man-
agement, himself relinquishing resi-
dence on the station, and making
his home at Rockhampton. This
arrangement continued until 1912,
when in conjunction with Messrs.
John William and Robert Alfred
Purvis, Mr. Barrett received an
offer from Mr. Purvis, sen., who ex-
pressed himself desirous of resigning
MR. STEWART ANDREW BARRETT.
the responsibility of ownership,
and suggested that the three gentle-
men referred to should make a joint
purchase of the property. A
partnership accordingly was agreed
upon, and the firm of Purvis and
Barrett came into being, Mr. Bar-
ret undertaking the role of general
manager, which he has since re-
tained. Since the period when the
property was acquired by Mr. Pur-
vis, sen., various additions have
been made to its boundaries, which
now include some 40,000 acres of
undulating, volcanic country, with
granite ridges, timbered with iron-
bark and bloodwood. Scoria Creek
runs through the estate, which is
also plentifully supplied with springs
of good water, and about 11 wells
have been sunk to depths varying
from 16 to 60 feet. A great deal of
improvement work has been com-
pleted by the previous and present
owners, among whom many miles of
fencing, dividing the property into
paddocks of suitable size, may be
mentioned. These, ranging in acre-
age from 3,000 to 4,000, are used
for the depasturing of cattle, a fine
herd of Herefords being the princi-
pal department of the firm’s enter-
prise. This was founded by Mr.
R. A. Purvis, but since the
inauguration of the present regime
considerable attention has been
given to improvement of the original
type, the introduction of Hereford
bulls from the famous “Torsdale”
stud, owned by Mr. Archer, having
been productive of very good results.
The country carries about one beast
to 10 acres, but the firm believes
that a policy of understocking is
the wiser in the long run, and at
at the present time 2,000 to
2,500 represents the numerical
strength of the herd on “Drum-
burle.” About 200 horses of the
draught type which have been bred
on the station are depastured, and
these are noted for their excellence.
Mr. Barrett takes a keen interest in
the public life of the district, and
is a member of the Banana Shire
Council, a committeeman of the
Dawson Amateur Picnic Racing
Club, and a member of the War
Recruiting Committee. He is a
well-known philanthropist and gen-
erous contributor to funds for pat-
riotic purposes and other useful
objects. In 1903 he married Beatrice,
daughter of Mr. R. A. Purvis, of
Rockhampton, and has two sons
and one daughter. The Messrs.
Purvis Brothers (Mr. Barrett’s
partners) are also well known for
their patriotic spirit, and the elder
(Mr. R. A. Purvis) was at the
front, fighting with the A.I.F. for

The younger (Mr. J. N. Purvis)
also volunteered for active service on
two occasions, but was rejected on
account of defective eyesight.

The land then was in its natural
state, being heavily timbered and

arrangements for comfort could
be made under existing conditions
by the settlers. In common with
others, Mr. Bates could command no

degrees, however, the place began
to assume a more homelike and
settled aspect, as buildings and
stockyards were erected, paddocks
fenced in, and timber removed. A
neat homestead soon sheltered the
family, cattle were introduced into
the pastures, and the proposition
began to take definite form and
shape. In all his endeavours Mr.
Bates was ably seconded and assisted
by his three sons, and by the com-
bined efforts of the plucky quartette

were achieved, and when the worthy

land in 1857, and when the family
settled at “Boompa” he was six
years of age. His education was
received partly at the hands of pri-
vate tutors in his paternal home and
partly at the Maryborough Public
School, and being resident during the
greater part of his time at the sta-
tion homestead, naturally from an
early age he became familiar with
the details of stock-raising in its
various branches. Some years before
the decease of his father he took
over the management of the run, and
subsequent to that event continued
to control affairs on behalf of
the family until 1902, when he pur-
chased his brother’s interests and
became sole proprietor. Since the
run was first taken up the original
area has been considerably en-
croached upon by selectors, and only
about 8,000 acres of the old holding
now remain in the possession of Mr.
Bates, the major portion of this
being converted into freehold. He
has augmented his property by pur-
chasing additional areas, making in
all about 15,000 acres, the whole of
which is known under the general
name of “Boompa.” Development
work has proceeded apace, fur-
ther subdivision being accomplished,
ring-barking pushed ahead, and on
the site of the original homestead now
stands a modern residence, fitted up
with all the appointments of up-to-
date civilization, including the erec-
tion of a gas plant, by means of
which the house is brilliantly lighted.
The run is excellently equipped with
dips, drafting yards, and everything
necessary for the efficient working of


a large cattle run, and in every
respect the improvements are on a
par with those of the other leading
pastoral properties of the neighbour-
hood. Mr. Bates has taken a fairly
prominent part in affairs pertaining
to local government, and for a num-
ber of years served as a member of
the Degilbo Shire Council, while he
was also a useful member and vice-
president of the Biggenden Agricul-
tural and Pastoral Society. He has
always displayed a keen interest in
the local annual show, and is a
constant exhibitor and prize-winner
in connection with this popular func-
tion. He holds an unbeaten record
for buggy horses, his “Delma” and
“Commodore” being well known in
this class, while for many years in
succession he has been a successful
competitor with “Rowley” in the
Galloway Hunt. Mr. Bates married
in 1899 Sarah Jane, daughter of the
late George Bates, of “Tickalera”
Station, Queensland.
“WOOLTON” Station, Banana,
the property of Messrs. Hutchison
Brothers. This station, which is
comprised of various leases, with an
aggregate area of 100,000 acres,
originally formed part of the “Wal-
loon” and “Camboon” properties,
taken up by the late James Reid in
MR. D. HUTCHISON.
the early days of settlement, and
used by him for sheep-raising pur-
poses. It was secured in 1867 by the
late William Hutchison, who
stocked it with merinoes, purchased
from the “Camboon” flocks. These
were allowed to increase until they
reached the number of 20,000, only
flock ewes being used, though from
time to time stud rams were intro-
duced with good results, the earliest
draft being procured from “Eton
Vale” Station, on the Darling
Downs, at prices ranging from 5
to 10 guineas each. In 1900 Mr.
Hutchison decided to try an in-
fusion of new blood, for which
purpose h© purchased some of
the “Boonoke” rams, and sub-
sequently these, together with
“Wanganellas,” supplanted the
earlier types. Satisfactory results
followed this policy, and it is a
somewhat remarkable fact that, with
the exception of the sires just noted,
no changes have been made in the
flock, and the “Woolton” sheep of
the present day are all de-
scended from those with which the
founder of the station started his
enterprise 45 years ago. This is a
circumstance in the district, “Wool-
thorpe” being the only other pro-
perty where a similar procedure has
been followed. In the present season
the clip has averaged 10 lbs. weight
of wool per fleece, and a price of
22d. per lb. has been realized. The
country is suitable both for sheep
and cattle, consisting of ironbark
ridges, rolling downs, and fertile,
black soil plains. During the
great drought which swept through
Queensland in 1902, a large propor-
tion of the natural timber died, and

good,” removed the necessity of
ring-barking for the purpose of
improving the pasturage. The estate
is watered by the Dawson River, to
which it has a frontage of several
miles, and its back country is well
provided with wells and bores, the
latter being fitted with pumping
apparatus in the shape of engines
and windmills. A large amount of

improvement work has been com-
pleted on the run, which is sub-
divided into numerous paddocks by
dogproof wire fencing, and has its
full complement of stockyards, dips,
and other conveniences. The shear-
ing is done by machinery, and the
shed is fitted up with stands for 10
men. In addition to the 10,000
sheep carried on the pastures, there
are 3,000 head of cattle, the latter
department having been started by
the purchase of Herefords from the
herd of Mr. Cook, of “Roundstone”
Station, and improved by infusions


of blood from Messrs. Archer Bros.'
stud, and also Coochin-Coochin
bulls. The present aim of the owners
of “Woolton” is confined to the
breeding of good, sound herd cattle,
but they intend in the future, as
opportunity may allow, to launch
out in the direction of producing
stud animals of first-class quality.
Some 300 head of horses are run
upon the estate, the sires in use at
the present time being two blood
horses and two draughts from
imported stock. The quality of
these horses is sufficiently demon-
strated by that fact that wherever
they have been offered they have
topped the market. The late William
Hutchison was born in 1832 in
Inverness-shire, Scotland, and was
descended from a family well known
for its martial proclivities, and
which gave many soldiers to the
country. At the age of 27 Mr.
Hutchison decided emigrate to
Australia, and landing at Brisbane
on September 27, 1859, he spent
some time at Ipswich, after which
he proceeded to “Isla” Station, on
the Dawson River, where he served
as jackaroo to Mr. McLaren, the
owner of that property. Six years
later (in 1867) he launched out on
his own account, taking up the pre-
sent “Woolton’’ area, as already
written. The late Mr. Hutchison
died in 1908, and is buried on the
homestead block of “Woolton.’’ By
his wife, Catherine, who accom-
panied him from England to Aus-
tralia, he had five sons and three
daughters. Three of the sons, viz.,
J. R., John, and Duncan A.
Hutchison, took control of the pro-
perty after the demise of their
father, and at the commencement
of their administration agreed on a
policy of general improvement,
which has proved highly successful.
Mr. J. R. Hutchison is the senior
member of the firm, but the actual
management is in the hands of his
brothers. Mr. Duncan A. Hutchison
interests himself in the public organ-
ization of the district, and is a mem-
ber of the Banana Shire Council,
president of the local racing club,
and a committeeman of the Dawson
Amateur Picnic Racing Club, in
connection with which he also acts
as starter. The last-named gentle-
man, who is the only married mem-
ber of the firm, in 1908 was united
to Enid, daughter of Mr. Frank
Collins, of “Belldeen” Station,
CHARLES HOUSE, of “Char-
ville” Station, Banana, was born in
1863, at Henley-on-Thames, and is
a son of Mr. Thomas Smith House,
a farmer, of Henley, Oxfordshire,
England, who died when his son
was 12 years old. He received his
education at the Henry Royal Gram-
mar School, and at the conclusion
of his scholastic course in 1878 he
remained under the paternal roof-
tree for a time, on the home farm.
At 17 years of age he was sent to
Australia by his guardians, and
obtained a position as jackaroo on
a station at Springsure, owned by
his uncle, Mr. H. V. Hewitt, where
he remained for 12 months. He next
proceeded to “Banana’’ Station,
then owned by Mr. F. W. Wright,
and continued there in various

positions until 1890, when he was
appointed to the management. At a
later period he became manager of
“Moura’’ Station, on behalf of
Messrs. D. C. McConnel & Sons, and
retained this post until 1908, when
he decided to launch out on his own
account, and, taking up “Char-
ville,” a property of 20,000 acres,
in the Banana district, he settled
down to stock-raising pursuits on
this holding, where he still resides.
He also owns “Highworth,’’ a pro-
perty of 20,000 acres upon the Daw-
son River. Mr. House has been 35
years in the Dawson River district,
and is a well-known personality in
the pastoral community. He has
taken a keen interest in the public
affairs of the district, and was a
member of the Banana Shire Council
for many years, also serving for
three years as clerk . of the
Council. He is a keen sports-
man, being an adept with the
gun, a good swimmer, and very fond
of horses. He married in 1897 his
first cousin, Mary, daughter of Mr.
H. V. Hewitt, of “Spring Vale’’
Station, and has a family of two sons
and one daughter.
WILLIAM CHARLES MIT-
CHELL, “Moonmera,” Rockhamn-
ton, was born at Newquay, Corn-
wall, in the year 1841, and is a son
of Mr. John Mitchell, a farmer of
that place. He received his educa-
tion in his native town, and upon
leaving school assisted his father
upon the home farm until twelve
years of age, when he went to sea
on a schooner named the “Marshall,”
trading on the English Channel,
from Swansea to Bordeaux and
Bilboa. The last-named town at that
period was notorious for its lawless
characters, and a ship was liable to
attack from river pirates, even whilst
being towed up the river. The
“Marshall” on one occasion encoun-
tered this exciting experience, but
was successful in beating off the
attackers with axes, without any
casualties among the crew. One of
the pirates, however, lost his hand
by an axe-stroke during the fray.
During the period of Mr. Mitchell’s
marine trading days, the scourge of
cholera was rife in Spain, and the
terror of the disease prevented sailors
from landing there. The dead were
picked up along the roads and
streets, and Mr. Mitchell showed his
grit by facing the avenues of carts
sent for this purpose whilst pursuing
the mission with which he had been
entrusted by his superior officer of
obtaining the ship’s papers from the
British Consul at Bilboa After
remaining at sea for two or three
years he returned to the farm, and
for a time conducted the livery
stables at Newquay. In October,
1860, he came to Australia by the
vessel “Flying Cloud,” and during
the voyage enjoyed the excitement of
a minor mutiny which occurred
among the crew, peace being
restored before the arrival of the
ship at Moreton Bay in January,
1861. Upon landing Mr. Mitchell
undertook the charge of twelve
immigrants on a journey from Bris-
bane to “Blythedale” Station, near
Roma, a distance of 300 miles,


which, done on foot, was covered in
safety by the party, which included
three women, Mr. Mitchell, as
leader, driving a spring cart con-
taining food supplies, etc. Floods
and bad weather delayed their pro-
gress, and frequent menace from the
numerous blacks was feared. Small
bush shanties on the road were the
haunts of ticket-of-leave convicts,
who could purchase “home-made
rum” there at Is. per glass; but,
despite these drawbacks, the two-
months’ trip over new country was
full of interest to the “new chums,”
who were well armed, and who
enjoyed the novelty of their experi-
ences. Mr. Mitchell rapidly became
an expert bushman, and towards the
close of the year of his arrival pur-
chased horses and waggons, and
started in business as a teamster.
His brother, who had preceded him
to Australia, had taken up “Blythe-
dale,” “Usella,” and “Wallumbilla”
Stations, near Roma, and about this
time was due with stock and teams
from New South Wales, where he
first had settled. Mr. Mitchell pro-
ceeded to Surat to meet the party,
but the Balonne River was running
a banker from there to “Werribone”
Station, and the surrounding coun-
try was entirely submerged, the
horses frequently having to swim
over the lower-lying parts. On
account of the floods no goods could
be transported, and the brothers
were compelled to return to “Blythe-
dale” to await more favourable con-
ditions. Mr. Mitchell followed the
life of a pioneer teamster for a num-
ber of years, during which period he
witnessed the establishment of many
new pastoral holdings, and was
entrusted with the work of convey-
ing to these the necessary supplies.
In many cases no roads nor even
tracks existed, and it was the custom
for a mounted bushman to scout for
a suitable route, depending as much
on instinct as on the compass with
which he was provided for the direc-
tion. The big flood of 1864, which
proved a throwback to Mr. Mitchell’s
business, was an outstanding experi-
ence, and another event of the same
year, which he vividly recalls, was
the turning of the first sod of the
earliest railway in Queensland, at
which function he was present. In
1868 Mr. Mitchell launched out in
another direction, travelling the
country with merchandise, in which
sphere of enterprise he was very suc-
cessful. In the course of these
journeyings, on one occasion his pro-
gress was arrested at Sir John Jame-
son’s “Biddenham” Station, on the
Nive River, by about a thousand
natives. After a delay of three days
police arrived on the scene, and the
blacks dispersed, fighting a running
battle across the plain. The police
and black trackers followed, and
numbers of slain natives attested the
grim nature of the struggle. After
two years of this life Mr. Mitchell
sold out, and again became engaged
in the carrying industry, initiating
his business by loading wool from
“Oakwood” Station, in the Warrego
district, to Rockhampton, a distance
of 500 miles, in the course of which
the wool had to be unloaded and
punted across the Dawson River.
He delivered his cargo safely, and

thereafter continued on the roads for
some years. During this time he
was chased by the blacks, and was
only saved by the speed of his Arab
stallion, which carried him to the
Ward River, seven miles distant.
After crossing this stream he fell in
with Redfern and another man, both
well armed, who returned with Mr.
Mitchell to attack the blacks, who,
however, by this time had decamped.
Mr. Mitchell’s experiences in con-
nection with the aboriginals were
numerous. He once witnessed a
tribal fight which lasted three days,
with regular intervals of armistice to
remove the dead and wounded.
Some of his journeys extended from
Rockhampton to the South Aus-
tralian border, and on his final trip
in 1878 he was caught in the flood
at “Wilfred Lagoons.” On this occa-
sion the owner of the holding gave
him what was known as “pitch
plaster,” i.e., an 1.0. U. for £3OO,
the cash for which he received six
months later. It was here that, upon
leaving his tent one morning, he saw
a gin devouring nart of a black-
fellow’s leg, which so horrified him
that he made a hasty departure from
the place, subsequently floundering
for three weeks through flood waters,
and temporarily losing the bag con-
taining the “pitch plaster” and his
clothes. Mr. Mitchell had carrying
teams in various parts of the State
until 1885, when he sold out, and
proceeding to Mount Morgan, took
on contracts with the mine for the
supply of timber, in which large
amounts of money were involved, the
first “squaring-up” between the
Company and himself taking place
at the close of two years’ time. In
1895 he pu phased the Razorback
Hotel at Mount Morgan, which he
conducted successfully for a
lengthy period, disposing of it in
1914, when he retired to “Moon-
mera,” his present home, which he
had erected as far back as 1882. It
is worthy of note that the timber of
this dwelling was all brought from
New Zealand, and still presents a
perfectly new appearance, showing
no trace of white ants. Mr. Mitchell
married in 1881 Arabella, daughter
of the late Thomas Thorne, of
Somersetshire, England, and has two
sons and three daughters.
GEORGE McEYOY, “Broad-
meadows,” Rockhampton, is a son
of the late George McEvoy, who,
hailing originally from King’s
County, Ireland, came to Queens-
land in April, 1865, and, subse-
quently, was one of the early set-
tlers in the vicinity of Rockhamp-
ton. He was first engaged in
clearing the route of the telegraph
line from Rockhampton to Banana,
and, upon the completion of this
piece of work, accepted employment
of various kinds, finally purchas-
ing cattle from Messrs. Archer
Brothers, of “Gracemere,” with
which he established a dairy farm
at Rockhampton, about 1867. This
venture proved successful, and a
year or two later he took up a home-
stead block near Table Mountain,
and added cattle-breeding to his
dairying operations. In 1871 a


t Hither area was acquired in the
shape of a block of 2,700 acres, upon
which the late Mr. McEvoy built a
house, and, settling there with his
family, started in good earnest in

the pastoral industry. Although
encountering the usual setbacks of
the early settler, he was able to
make his way, and, about 1912,
having made sufficient to retire
upon, he divided his various pro-
perties between his sons, George
and John Joseph. He died at
Rockhampton in 1915. The gentle-
man under review, M/r 1 , George
McEvoy, was born at Rockhamp-
ton in 1866, and received his edu-
cation at the Crocodile State School.
"BROADMEADOWS" RESIDENCE.
From early davs his services were
enlisted in the working of the home
farm, and it was not until 1899 that
he made a move towards independ-
ent enterprise. In that year he took
ggg2
up two blocks of land on the old
“Calliungai” run, comprising
11,000 acres of grazing land, un-
dulating in character, and watered
by the Don River and Alma Creek.
This he stocked with cattle, and
proceeded to improve it by ring-
barking, well-sinking, and sub-
division, increasing his herd by de-
grees until it numbered 800 head.
His first transaction in stock was
highly profitable, a draft of 200
stores, which he had purchased at
thirty shillings per head, a few
months later, after fattening, bring-
ing T 5 per head, delivered at the
yards of the Gladstone Meat Works.
Subsequently, Mr. McEvoy in-
creased his holding to 20,000 acres,
and at t lie time of writing
it is one of the leading properties
of the district, highly improved,
with a carrying capacity of from
1,500 to 2,000 head of cattle. In
1914, he purchased hßroadmead-
ows,” whicb formerly was a portion
of a block of 2,700 acres owned bv
Mr. England, who, in his turn, had
acquired it from, his father, the
original leaseholder of a much
larger tract of country, in the early
days. Mr. McEvoy has since re-
sided on this property, which be
uses as a fattening station, and
from it he controls his other inter-
ests, which lie within easy distance
of the homestead. Besides “Cal-
liungai,” these include a freehold
block, 3,000 acres in extent, known
as “Mountain View,” situated
about fourteen miles distant from
Rockhampton, in close vicinity to
the Mount Morgan railway line. All
the properties are devoted to the
depasturage of cattle, the breeds
favoured by Mr. McEvoy being the
Shorthorn and Hereford, with
which he has been very successful.
His experiences have included the
usual vicissitudes of the Queens-
land pastoralist, and in the big
drought of the early years of this

century, he was hit badly, having
to resort to prickly pear as a staple
food for his stock. In earlier days
hardship was his constant com-
panion, a diet of “johnny cake’’
and corned beef being all that was
obtainable, whilst, when not sit-
ting in the saddle, he was glad to
use it for a pillow. He crossed the
Razorback with cattle in 1879, when
it was the terror of the country, and,
on account of the broken nature of
the land, the greatest bar to the
development of the pastoral indus-
try in the vicinity. At this period
there was only one white man in the
neighbourhood. Later, he was
grazing cattle on the present site of
the great Mount Morgan mine, of
which lie watched the growth from
the time of pitching of the first tent
thereon—passing the Morgans on
the road, when they were on their
way to peg out their claim. He
has interested himself in the public
affairs of the district, in which he
has a big stake—in addition to his
pastoral activities being a share-
holder in the Farmers’ Co-ooerative
Bacon and Butter Factory and
other commercial enterprises—and
is connected with various organiza-
tions, viz., the Shire Council, the
Agricultural Society, and the local
jockey club. He married in 1905
Julia, daughter of Mr. John Mar-
tin, of Sebastopol, West Rock-
hampton, and has four sons and
one daughter.


THOMAS ASHTON, orchardist,
Palmwoods, is a son of Mr. William
Ashton, a native of Kirkstall, near
Leeds, Yorkshire, England. In
1883 he left the Old Country
for Australia, and landing at Mary-
borough, was employed by the Rail-
ways Department for a number of
years. Afterwards he selected 110
acres of land at Bauple and
started farming operations. When
the sugar-cane industry came into
prominence he planted about ten
acres with cane, and, being suc-
cessful, has since increased the area
under cultivation. He married
Eliza, daughter of the late Joseph
Adams, of Kirkstall, near Leeds, and
has three sons and two daughters.
Mr. T. Ashton, was born at Leeds,
Yorkshire, in 1873, and attended the
Church of England National School
until his departure for Australia
by the “Earl Granville,” landing at
Maryborough, where he completed
his education. He began work with
the firm of Messrs. John Walker and
Co., shipbuilders and iron founders.
When his parents left for Tiaro in
1885 he accompanied them, and
followed farming pursuits on various
holdings in this neighbourhood, sub-
sequently assisting his father on the
home farm at Bauple. Upon the
inception of the sugar industry he
obtained employment as clarifier on
attention, on the route terminating
at Goomeri, about 10- miles from
Murgon, and subsequently he took
up timber-contracting in that dis-
trict, continuing there for about

seven years. Mr. Ashton claims to
have been the second white man
in the Murgon district. Sup-
plies had to be brought from 16
miles distant along a bullock track,
there being only three small
postmaster and parcel collector in
an honorary capacity. These and
other services were acknowledged
in a very cordial fashion by
the community upon his departure
from the district, when he
was made the recipient of a gold
watch and chain, suitably inscribed,
and his wife was presented with a
valuable dinner service, both also
receiving other tokens of the esteem
and respect in which they were
generally held. In 1905 Mr. Ashton
paid a visit to Montville, and five
years later he purchased a selection
of 160 acres from Mr. C. Topper, of
Palmwoods, in the Blackall Range. A
few pineapples and oranges planted
on a 20-acre clearing, about 3 acres
of which were under fruit, formed
a nucleus for the extended enterprise
in this direction which Mr. Ashton
has since inaugurated, 12 acres now
being devoted to the fruit industry,
which includes the cultivation of
bananas. The products of th : s
orchard find their way to all parts
of the Commonwealth and New
Zealand, over 2,000 cases in 1914
being consigned to the various
capitals. Mr. Ashton interests
himself in public affairs, being a
committeeman of the local School of
Arts, the Farmers’ Union, and the
Progress Association respectively,
and a prominent member of the
the Bauple Central Sugar Mill, and
after remaining in this connection
for three years, again became engaged
in farm work at Tiaro. Railway

settlements within a wide radius, and
no post-office nor store; but it was
splendid timber country, and as the
population increased Mr. Ashton
voluntarily assumed the duties of
Palmwoods Methodist Church. He
married Sarah, daughter of Mr.
Alexander Hall, a farmer of the
Tiaro district, and has two sons and
three daughters.


SAMUEL CLEMESHA, J.P.,

was born at Maitland, New South
Wales, on January 23, 1860, and is

esha, a native of Yorkshire, England,
who arrived in Australia with his
parents in the late thirties, being at
that time but an infant. The grand-
MR S. W. CLEMESHA.
father of the gentleman under
review and the founder of the
Clemesha family in the land of the
Southern Cross was a scion of old
Yorkshire stock, his forbears having
been connected with various manu-
facturing businesses in the County
from a period dating many centuries
back. Mr. Wordsworth Clemesha
was one of a family of five children.
He started life as a tradesman, but
subsequently, after his marriage,
entered the hotel business, filling the
role of “min© host” of a notable old
hostelry in Wandsworth (then known
as Limestone) in the New England
district, as far back as the year 1862.
While conducting this establishment
he selected a grazing farm in the
same locality, engaging in wool-
growing and stock-raising in a small
way, and thus in the early days
following its foundation identifying
himself with the industry which has
made Australia the greatest wool-
producing country in the world.
Later he removed to Tamworth
where he was again connected with
trade for a time, and her© he was
also well known as the owner of an
hotel called “The Southern Cross.”
He spent the autumn of his days in
Sydney, crossing the Great Divide
when in his seventy-sixth year.
Early in life Mr. Samuel Clemesha
became occupied with various
duties such as the exigencies
of the times demanded of the
lad growing to years of useful-
ness, assisting his father both in his
landed and commercial enterprises.
Realizing the benefit of having a
trade as an asset, Mr. Wordsworth
Clemesha apprenticed his son Samuel
to the blacksmithing trad© in Mus-
wellbrook, with which the latter was
connected for five years, during which
period he applied himself assiduously
to the mastery of the trade which was
to occupy the greater portion of his
life and eventually prove the found-
ation of his prosperity. At the ter-
mination of his apprenticeship he
became an improver, and later fol-
lowed his calling at Inverell, Narri-
bri, Glen Innes, Armidale, and
Sydney, working in connection with
the railway line to Glen Innes and
from thence on to Tenterfield. In the
year 1884, owing to the fact that
finished tradesmen were able to com-
mand higher wages in Queensland
than in the Southern Colonies, he
transferred his energies to the North
and securing a temporary post at
Bundaberg worked there until the
eventuation of the mining boom at
Wild River Tin Mines, the scene of
which later became Herberton. Pro-
ceeding to this centre he worked at
his trade until the mines began to
shut down, subsequently journeying
to Rockhampton where he again
secured temporary employment. From
Rockhampton he travelled to Jericho
in order to engage as a railway
tradesman on the Western Central

being thus occupied along the route
as the railway progressed to Blackall.
On arrival at the last-mentioned
town he was employed in private

work, later following his calling at
Clermont. At about this period of
his career, feeling somewhat dispirited
at not having achieved better success
as the result of his strenuous labours


in Queensland he practically decided
to return to New South Wales, being
deterred from this course by the
advice of a friend who suggested
that he should make a start in
the Mount Cornish hotel, the
leading hostelry of that town. After
a few months spent as an employe,
Mr. Clemesha rented the smithy
which he carried on with marked
centre for the manufacture of
coaches, carriers’ waggons, and
vehicles of every description. During
the above-mentioned period he
acquired other interests, purchasing
Western Queensland. The advice
appeared sound in view of the fine
possibilities of that district, and
accordingly Mr. Clemesha set out for
"ZARA" HOMESTEAD.
success. By the end of the year
1887 he was in a position to
purchase the business and premises
outright, his enterprise being
the hotel at Muttaburra and, as early
as the year 1892, becoming a pastoral
landowner, his first venture in the
latter connection being the purchase
Muttaburra, at which town he
arrived in the middle of the year
1886. He obtained employment with
Mr. St. John Harding, the owner of
the local smithy, who also conducted

rewarded during the following 27
with continued success which
resulted in the extension of his
operations and the enlargement of
his premises, the latter becoming a
of a small block of country con-
sisting of 1,280 acres on which he
bestowed the name of “Clemville ”
and which he devoted to sheep and
horses. By later selection he added


to this block, increasing its acreage
to 60,000. In the year 1898, being
further convinced of the great possi-
bilities of the pastoral industry in
Western Queensland, he selected
"Silverwood,” a property of 20,000
acres, situated on Tower Hill Creek.
Stocking the run with sheep, he
initiated various improvements
thereon, being personally engaged in
its administration until 1905, in
which year he disposed of the propo-
sition to advantage. Encouraged by
the success which had hitherto
attended his pastoral enterprises he
embarked upon another venture in
the year 1908, purchasing “Zara,” a
proposition situated in the vicinity
of Hughenden, to the development of
which he immediately applied him-
self with energy, the improvements
resulting in the prominent place
which “Zara” holds to-day among
similar highly developed properties
in Northern Queensland. In the
year 1913, Mr. Clemesha entered
with his family into permanent
residence on the above-mentioned
proposition, disposing of his black-
smithing and wheelwright business in
the following year though still
retaining ownership of the premises
which were the scene of his first
independent business essay; and
holding also various other properties
within the town area of Muttaburra.
He disposed of “Clemville” in 1909
as being too small for the purpose he
had in view, and selected “Potosi,”

near Muttaburra, in the same year,
and in 1910 purchased “Dirvock,” a
block adjoining “Zara. In March
1920 he purchased a very fine prop-
erty, “lona,” comprising 18,000
acres, fully stocked, situated about
sixteen miles from Hughenden.

luxuriance on the downs, while
spinifex, edible scrub, and many
varieties of useful herbage flourish
on the ridges and other portions of
the run, the whole area being highly
adapted to the raising of both woolly
and horned stock to which depart-
ments of the industry it is devoted.
Mr. Clemesha has entrusted the
administration of “Potosi” to a
resident manager as, owing to the
distance between the two properties
he finds it inconvenient to give his
personal attention to both. “Zara”
consists of five blocks of country
which originally were a part of
“Cameron Downs” resumption, and
“Dirvock,” the block acquired two
years later, the combined areas being
now run as a single proposition,
embracing some 55,000 acres of fine
grazing country, the nature of
which is indicated by well-grassed
downs alternating with belts of
timbered land. The “Zara” bound-
ary on the northern side lies
22 miles from Hughenden. Mr.
Clemesha has given his undivided
attention to the various develop-
mental operations initiated by him
on the station, with the result that
the improvements are all of the most
up-to-date description, the fencing
being efficient, the water supply
abundant and the various other
departments of the station conducted
on lines producing most satisfactory
results. The paddocks are 13 in
number and adequately provided
with excellent water by the output
of four artesian bores, the stock
receiving conserved supplies from
those sources at distances of not
more than two miles from whichever
point they seek refreshment, further
provision being afforded, by the
supplies contained in ground tanks
of most approved modern structure,
these being supplied from the Lands-
borough River from its source in the
ranges bordering the “Zara” run.
On no station in the North has such
attention been given to the making
of roads, those on “Zara” having
been formed around the fences and
to the various watering places
facilitating not only the work of
inspection by motor but also serving
as brakes in the dangerous seasons
when bush fires occur. The sheep
depastured on “Zara” and “Potosi”
have been bred from a nucleus of
“Bowen Downs” and “Ambo” ewes
and rams of southern importation.

the other improvements effected
on the property are the shear-

gazetted a Justice of the Peace in
the year 1911 by the Liberal
Administration then in power. Since
his advent to Muttaburra 35 years
ago he has actively and prominently
participated in the communal life of
that town and the surrounding dis-
trict, and later of Hughenden. For
the past twenty years he was a
councillor of the Aramac Shire
Council, only retiring from that
office early in 1920. The Council wish-
ing to give expression of its appre-
ciation, handed a letter to him which
reads as follows:—“Aramac, 24th
June, 1920. S. Clemesha, Esq.,
Zara. Dear Sir, I have under direc-
tion to advise you that the Council
has pleasure in placing on record the
long and valued services you have
rendered to the Shire, whilst a mem-
ber of the Board. They also decided
as a small recognition of such ser-
vices to grant you a free pass over
the Tramway for life. The pass
will be sent later on. In connection
with the Tramway, the Surveyor
General suggested that the names of
Ascot and Mildura sidings should be
changed to save confusion, as other’s
had a prior claim to the names. It
was decided to accede to the request
and that of Ascot was re-named
'Clemesha,’ and Mildura, ‘Bowyer.’
Yours faithfully, (signed) R. G.
Miller, Shire Clerk.” For long he
has been a foremost figure in the var-
ious bodies instituted for the public
weal both at Muttaburra and Hugh-
enden, having occupied the offices of
president of the Hospital and School
Committees, the local Turf Club and
the Progress Association of the
former town. On the eve of their
departure from Muttaburra, Mr.
Clemesha and his wife were made the
recipients of a testimonial and an
address which expressed in warm
terms the appreciation of all with
whom they had come in contact either
socially or in the course of business
during their long sojourn in the town,
many friends coming from long dis-
tances in order to be present at the
gathering assembled for this purpose.

was asked by Longreach to contest in
the National cause the Mitchell
electorate against the sitting Labour
member, but was unable to accede to
the request owing to the pressure of
his pastoral interests. Mr. Clemesha
is a past-master of the Aramac
Masonic Lodge, E.C. He married
in the year 1887 Mary, daughter of
the late Michael Cunneen, a native
of County Clare, Ireland, and a
descendant of a family which was
established in the western portion of
the Emerald Isle in far back ages,
his forbears having been occupied
with agrarian pursuits through the
succeeding generations. Of the
union there is a surviving family of
two sons and two daughters. The
former are both assisting their
father in the administration of
“Zara.” The elder son, Samuel

and the outlying districts from 1882,
the year which witnessed his arrival
to the North-west, to the date of
his death which occurred in 1916.
The late gentleman was born in the
village of Inst Lawrence in County
Limerick, where for many genera-
tions his progenitors were engaged in
agricultural pursuits, the Penny
family being an offshoot of a clan of
warriors who figured prominently in
the early history of the country
through their loyalty to the reign-
ing Princess of Munster in the days
when province warred against pro-
vince. At a period dating nearly
half a century back, when Queens-
land was still in the throes of the
financial debacle which paralysed
the country in 1866 and was prim-
arily the result of the monetary and
commercial crises existing in Eng-
land, the late Mr. Penny and his
sister made their advent to Australia
which during the preceding years
had been largely advertised in Great
Britain for the encouragement of
intending settlers. His first post was
as jackaroo on “Hornet Bank”
Station, where he obtained a good
grounding in pastoral work, acquir-
ing also useful knowledge of the
conditions under which the industry
was conducted in his adopted
country. Making good use of his
time and opportunities he was soon
sufficiently experienced to undertake
more responsible duties, being eventu-
ally appointed to the overseership of
“Baroonda.” In the middle eighties
he travelled in charge of 20,000 sheep
destined for “Maxwelton” Station
near Hughenden. Later he became
employed on “Redcliff” Station, also
situated in the vicinity of the above-
mentioned town, but relinquished
his post in order to open a
butchering establishment at Hugh-
enden in partnership with Mr. John
Luckmann, the firm thereafter being
engaged in this connection for a
period. Eventually Mr. Penny
purchased Mr. Luckmann’s interest
in the concern, which he conducted
on his own until the year 1914, when
he retired from active business
pursuits. During the period he was
also well known as a dealer in stock
and as the owner of various landed
propositions. For some years he was
a member of the Hughenden Divis-
ional Board and later of the
Hughenden Town Council, and has
received much praise for his public-
spirited efforts on behalf of the town
and community and for the satisfac-
tory manner in which the duties of
an honorary nature falling to his
share were carried out. Of good,
clean sport he was always a promin-
ent supporter, and during his life-
time was officially connected in various
capacities with the racing bodies of
Northern Queensland, his colours—
blue and gold—scoring frequently at
the different meetings. His marriage
to Miss Jane Gibson, a native of

WALTER EDWARD ANDER-

Queensland, on September 10, 1893.
He is the eldest son of the late Walter

quarters of a century ago, having

the grazing industry and thus
paved the way which has been
worthily followed by his son and
grandson. A native of Scotland, the
late John Anderson became notably
identified with the pastoral life of
the Southern States of Australia,
having managed among other old-
time stations of note “Merne” and
Avenue Range” in South Australia,
and became widely conversant with
prevailing conditions relating to the
industry in his adopted country.
This old pioneer crossed the Great
Divide at Penola, South Australia,
in 1882, full of years and honours,
leaving a family of twelve (of whom
the late W. R, Anderson was the
third born) and a memory worthy to
be recalled in association with many
of his countrymen whose pioneering
efforts achieved so much in the way
of development in Australia, and
whose descendants continue to carry
out the traditions of their Scottish
forbears. The late Walter Robson
Anderson was born at Geelong,
Victoria, in the year 1857. For over
a quarter of a century he was closely
associated with the growth of the
pastoral industry in Queensland,
during the major portion of the time
being in the service of the Messrs.
1 airbairn, with whom he was
originally associated as overseer of
“Barcaldine Downs.” As the out-
come of his experience, ability, and
keen attention to duty, he was soon
promoted to the important post of
general manager, supervising in that
capacity the administration of
“Beaconsfield,” “Delta,” “Fairview,”
and “Crendon” Stations, and becom-
ing in the course of his duties one of
the best known pastoral managers of
the State. In 1907 he relinquished
his connection with the firm and in
the following year purchased “Fair-
view,” near Kynuna, from Mr.
Fairbairn, which he personally
conducted for about three years,
selling in 1911 when he went into
retirement for a brief period.
Subsequently he purchased “Del-
bessie,” near Hughenden, but
shortly afterwards taking advantage
of a good market sold the property
and became “mine host” of the
Central Hotel, Hughenden, the
leading establishment of its kind in
North-West Queensland. Embarking
upon another venture in June, 1915,
he selected a block of country in the
vicinity of Corfield, which he named
“Burnside” and conducted for a
short time only, his death eventuat-
ing in the following year, when the
district lost a man noted for his fine
qualities of citizenship, his capability
as a pastoralist, and the open-hearted
and genial characteristics which
distinguished him. He is survived

daughters, the first-mentioned being

Hooke, who, in the last decade of the
18th century, sold out of his estates
in England and purchased two ships
for the conveyance of his family,
domestics, house furniture, farming
implements, horses, cattle, etc., to
the new world in which he intended
to settle. This meant the breaking
off of very old associations, as, of the
four properties which he owned in
England, two had been in the family
since the year 1416 and one since
1066. On arrival in Australia he
received from the Crown a free grant
of land in the Parramatta district,
and this property, which he devoted
to cattle raising, he named "Bailey
Park." However, he subsequently
sold "Bailey Park" and returned
with his folk to England, later cross-
ing the equator for the second time
in the country’s infancy and settling
in Tasmania, where the name is
found in different records bearing on
events which happened there in the

MR. JAMES HARROP.
of Mr. James Harrop, who was
brought to Australia by his parents
when an infant. The founder of the
line now established in Queensland
was the late Henry Harrop, a
descendant of a very old English
farming stock, who, hailing from
Macclesfield, Cheshire, landed with
his family in the territory then
known as the Moreton Bay district
in the forties, immediately proceeding
to that part of the country which is
fertilized by the waters of the Logan,
and there settling down to agricul-
tural pursuits. The Harrop family
were amongst the pioneers of the
Logan district, and continued to
work the land acquired on their
arrival until the death of Mr. Henry
Harrop, when the property, which
was a freehold proposition, was leased
for a time. It is worthy of mention
that it is yet in their possession, pro-
viding one of the rare instances in
which country taken up during the
infancy of Queensland continues to
be identified with the original
owners. Five children were born to
the late Henry Harrop. After his
death his son, Mr. James Harrop,
devoted his energies to stock dealing,
and followed that department of the
pastoral industry until his retire-
ment from business pursuits, having
been a well-known figure in and
around Brisbane —where he still
HHH
resides—during the intervening 50
years. He is still hale and
hearty at the ripe old age of 72,
spending the autumn of his days with
the companion who trod with him
life’s journey, proving herself a
stanch comrade through the various
vicissitudes which chequered his
career, and now sharing with him
the love and reverence of their
descendants to the second genera-
tion, namely, two sons, two daugh-
ters, and six grandchildren. Both
sons and one of the grandsons par-
ticipated in the Great European
War. Mr. George Harrop was
educated at Petrie Terrace School,
Brisbane, where he pursued his
studies until reaching the age of 14,
when he became apprenticed to
MR. G. HARROP.
Messrs. R. W. Thurlow & Co., Ltd.,
of Brisbane, continuing his commer-
cial career in that service for the
ensuing eight years. On the out-
break of the Boer War in 1889 he
was amongst the first to volunteer
for active service, and as a member
of the Fourth Queensland Imperial
Bushmen’s Contingent took part in
the campaigns conducted in the
Orange Free State, the Transvaal,
and Cape Colony. When the war
ended he returned to Australia and
joined the staff of Messrs Samuel
Allen & Sons, Northern Queensland,
with which he was connected for
eight years. While operating in the
north on behalf of the above-men-
tioned firm he availed himself of
an opportunity afforded him of
purchasing a half share in a general
business established in Hughenden
by Mr. W. Wilkes, within two years
taking over the whole direction of
this concern, which he still conducts
in conjunction with more recently
acquired interests, some of which in-
clude grazing areas in the vicinity of
Hughenden. He made his first essay
into the pastoral industry in the
year 1913, on various subsequent
occasions enlarging his operations in
this direction, with the result that
he is now the owner of an acreage
considerably in excess of 100,000,
which is devoted to sheep and cattle.
His later ventures included a quarter
share in “Thirlstone,” in the
vicinity of Hughenden, the area of
which station embraces 81,000 acres;
a half share in “Tarella,” which lies
in the district outlying Torrens
Creek; and the country comprising
“Sussex Park,” a grazing proposi-
tion situated near Hughenden, which
he personally conducts. In the public
life of Hughenden he has been a
prominent figure, having held
aldermanic honours for six years and
twice filled the Mayoral chair. He
acted as the Western representative
of the Townsville Harbour Board
for four years. A foundation mem-
ber of the Flinders Club, he has
been a committeeman of that insti-
tution since its inception, being also

was born on April 17, 1886, and is
the third and youngest son of the
late Joseph Woodburn, a pioneer of

both the southern and northern
portions of the State. Hailing from
Ireland, the late gentleman, some
time after his arrival in his adopted
country, became identified with gold
encouraging, so when the important
gold discovery eventuated on the site
of what is now Ravenswood, he was
among the first prospectors on that
field. From Ravenswood he pro-
ceeded to Charters Towers, where his
interests embraced both mining and
carrying operations. Here he became
associated with Mr. (afterwards the
Hon.) John Deane, in conjunction
with whom, in the middle eighties,
when engaged as a carrier between
Townsville and Charters Towers, he
established the firm of Woodburn &
Deane and acquired “The Bluff”
Station. Thenceforwards, his ener-
gies were devoted to both the pas-
toral and mining industries, his
association with the latter having
lasted throughout the whole period
of his career in Australia until his
retirement from active pursuits.
Messrs. Woodburn & Deane were
the founders of the Burdekin Meat
Works. In the early years of the
firm’s ownership of “The Bluff” Mr.
Woodburn personally managed the
property, but later handed over the
control to a brother of his partner.
Subsequently, Mr. Andrew Deane,
afterwards owner of “Woura Park,”
near Prairie, entered upon the
active administration of the run, in
which, in the year 1910, the late
Joseph Woodburn purchased his
retirement. His life was brimful of
incident and interwoven with the
careers of many old friends who ever
found in him a ready helper and a
stanch comrade. The affection in

men are interested also with their
brother, Mr. George Woodburn, in
"The Bluff.” Born at Charters
Towers, the subject of this memoir
pursued his education at the Sydney
Grammar School, from there pro-
ceeding to the Hawkesbury Agricul-
tural College to equip himself for the
life on the land which it was his
intention to follow. On concluding
his training at Hawkesbury, he
returned to “The Bluff,” where, very
shortly, he was allotted duties that
afforded a very thorough and prac-
tical experience of cattle and horses
and all that pertains to the working
of a station. As already stated, he
entered upon the management of
“The Bluff” in 1910, and when his
father acquired the sole interests in
the property, which, under his
regime, has been enlarged by the
purchase of an adjoining area called
“St. Pauls,” and now comprises
about 300 square miles of country
characterized by ironbark, box and
bloodwood timbers, and depastured
with a good type of cattle which are
the progeny of shorthorn-Devon
stock. The portion of the run most
recently acquired is well watered by
the Burdekin River, while a number
of springs, wells and dams afford
ample supplies on the original area
known as “The Bluff”—now the title
of the amalgamated holdings. A com-
fortable and artistic home is a notable
feature among the improvements
existing on the property. Mr. Wood-
burn duly participates in affairs

days. When the present century
opened he was the owner of “Congie”
Station in the Charleville district,
and subsequently held “Moss Vale,”
near Charters Towers, being engaged
in the management of “Millungera,”
near Cloncurry, North-western
Queensland, for many years previous
to his death. Mr. and Mrs. Wood-
burn have one daughter, who is
named after her mother.
The late BERNARD CANNING
MACGROARTY. In the annals
of Northern Queensland, the name of
Bernard Canning Macgroarty figures
prominently; and his death left a
sorely felt gap in the ranks of those
whose efforts contributed towards the
history making of this vast, prolific
and still sparsely populated portion
of the State. He was born at Don-
egal, County Donegal, Ireland, and
at the age of seventeen left his native
land for Sydney, accomplishing
the voyage, which lasted six months,
in a. sailing vessel. Sydney was not
to know him for a very lengthy per-
iod, however, for he left the Mother
State for Queensland about the time
of the great gold discovery which
made Gympie famous (1867), com-
pleting the journey from Brisbane

on foot, after experiencing, with
some companions, the dread adven-
ture of being lost in the Bunya
Ranges for three weeks, during
which time the nuts contained in the
bunya cones saved the party from
starvation. As a miner at Gympie
Mr. Macgroarty met with indifferent
success, and accordingly left there
for the Palmer River, when the rush
for gold to this then little known
part of the Far North occurred.
The results of his efforts at Palmer
were not conducive to perseverance,
and, therefore, he made his way to
Georgetown, where, in 1874, he
joined the Civil Service as Clerk of
Petty Sessions. He was later trans-
ferred to Normanton in this capac-
ity, and there appointed Police
Magistrate in 1879. From then
onwards he continued to act in a
judicial capacity in different North-
ern centres. He was Police Magis-
trate of Normanton for seven and of
Hughenden for seventeen years, and
engaged in Blackall in the same cap-
acity from 1902-5, and in Mackay
from 1905-12. He was spared
to hie relatives and friends in
Mackay, after his retirement from
the Civil Service, until the year
1918, when he rejoined the com-
rade of many years, his good wife,
who predeceased him in 1915. This
lady was Matilda Marie, daughter
of the late Mr. Gielis, who, having
hailed from Launceston, Tasmania,
was one of the prominent mining
engineers of the early days. Mr.
Gielis supervised the erection of the
first large plant on the Gympie
gold field, as well as other plants
there and elsewhere in Queens-
land. Before her marriage, which
occurred in Georgetown when Mr.
Macgroarty was Clerk of Petty
Sessions there, Mrs. Macgroarty had
lesided in Tasmania. She cheerfully
faced the adverse climatic conditions
that prevailed in the almost infant
townships in which, at different
times, her husband’s duties lay, and
adapted herself to every circum-
stance which confronted her, after-
wards looking back at this period of
her life as one full of happy mem-
ories. When the home was removed
to Normanton, she accomplished
with her husband the long overland
journey from Georgetown in a bul-
lock waggon. She was an exemplary
member of the Catholic Church and
one of its most untiring workers, and
heJped to forward the great ideals
of Christianity. Her self-sacrificing
energy proved an invaluable aid to
the hospital, ambulance and other
local institutions, and she was presi-
dent of the Hospital Auxiliary up to
the time of her death and of the Hos-
pital Saturday movement until her
failing health caused her to relin-
quish the position. Mr. Macgroarty
at Ins death left a family of five. Of
these, four are now living, Messrs.
Dan, Herbert and Neville Mac-
groarty and Mrs. Webster, wife of
Mr. A. H. Webster, merchant of
Mackay. Mr. Neville Macgroarty
left for the Western War Front in
the early part of 1916, and after
nearly three years active service in
trance was grievously incapacitated
by the loss of a lower limb as the
result of a serious wound, the paraly-
sis of one hand, and the general
break-up of his health.

HISTORY OF QUEENSLAND : ITS PEOPLE AND INDUSTRIES.


CLARENCE LINDSEY-
BROWNE, “El Dorado,” Stamford,
North Queensland, was born at
“Forest Lodge,” New South Wales,
on September 1, 1884. He is the
MR. LINDSEY-BROWNE.
only son of Mr. A chie Henry Cecil
Browne and a grandson of the late
J. D. Browne, whose grandfather,
William Browne, was the founder of
the line in Australia. The late
William Browne was a member of a
very old Irish family, the head of
which is the Marquis of Sligo. In
the year 1816 he landed in Sydney
from Calcutta, where he had been
engaged as an officer in the East
India Company’s service, accom-
plishing the voyage in a ship called
the “Mary.” Pie brought with him
a capital of £20,000 and considerable
quantities of merchandise, and also
several Indian servants, whom, how-
ever, he subsequently sent back to
their own country. Immediately on
arrival he became identified with the
agricultural and commercial life of
the then Colony, engaging in farming
pursuits on a land grant of 3,000
acres situated in the Illawarra
district, which he received from
Lieutenant-Colonel Macquarie, the
Governor, whose policy, in accord-
ance with that of the Imperial
Government, was to offer every
possible incentive to enterprise of
this nature. As an interesting side-
light on the methods of encouraging
settlement which then existed we
quote from a letter written to Mr.
Browne by the Governor’s secretary,
dated April 27, 1816. It reads as
follows:—“His Excellency will make
you a grant of 3,000 acres of land
and assign you 12 cows from the
Government herds on a credit of
three years, to be paid back in kind
or in money, at your option
You will also be allowed eight
Government men, to be victualled
from the King’s stores for a term of
eighteen months to facilitate your
agricultural pursuits, and they will
be ordered to you as soon as the land
destined for you shall be selected and
surveyed. You and your family will
also be victualled from the same
period for eighteen months from the
King’s stores. The Governor will fur-
ther direct an eligible town allotment
to be marked out for the purpose
of your erecting a dwelling-house,
stores, and wharf near to Dawes’
Point Battery, in the situation
solicited by you.” Mr. Browne also
owned an area of 800 acres at Port
Hacking—part of which is now
included in the National Park—and
a property called “Oaklands,” near
Appin, which is still held by the
family. “Oaklands” is fronted for
a distance of half a mile by old oaks,
which were planted two generations
ago. Apart from his landed interests,
he was well known at a period dating
over a century back as one of the
prominent merchants of Sydney, and
his town residence, warehouse, etc.,
occupied land on the northern
corner of George and Bridge Streets,
extending to the Tank Stream. The
second generation of the family built
the Crooked Billet Inn on the
George Street frontage of this
property, and on the same site which
is now occupied by the Star Hotel.
Included in the third generation of
the Browne family were the late J.
D. and W. J. Browne. The latter
was a well-known sportsman of the
fifties, and in later years was a
member of the Customs branch of
the Civil Service. He died in 1914,
having reached his ninetieth year.
Mr. J. D. Browne was eighty-two at
the time of his death, which occurred
at Liverpool, a town with which he
had long been identified. An
agricultural landowner with large
interests, he formerly held a con-
siderable portion of the southern
half of Liverpool for farming
purposes. He married Miss Graham,
a member of another early Aus-
tralian family, the history of which
is interwoven with that of the
Macarthurs, the Baylys of Bayly
Park, and the Broughtons,
descendants of Commissary-General
Broughton. His sou, Mr. A. H. C.
Browne, was born at “Oaklands,”
the old family home in Appin, and
eventually became well known in the
pastoral industry in his native State,
retiring from active life in the
nineties. At time of writing he
resides at Petersham, Sydney. For
over a century (1816-1920) the
Browne family has been identified
with land settlement in Australia.
With the intention of following in
the footsteps of his progenitors, Mr.
C Lindsey-Browne, on the conclusion
of his education at the Brighton
Grammar School, Victoria, went for
practical experience to the Co-
operative Wool and Produce Co. of
Sydney, so as to acquire reliable
knowledge of the technical and
commercial phases of the wool
industry, being then at the age of
eighteen. From the Co-operative
Wool and Produce Co. he went to
the well-known firm of Hudson & Co.,
Bradford, England, to obtain
specially expert knowledge, and
remained there until his purpose was
fulfilled. On his return to Sydney
he occupied for a time the position
of assistant valuator with the
company with which he had been
first associated, but as that appeared
to be too narrow a sphere he left it to
turn his attention to stock, starting
MR. A. H. C. BROWNE.
by leasing a property named
“Lambridge,” near Penrith, in New
South Wales. Afterwards he secured
another called “Llandillo,” near St.
Mary’s, not far from Sydney, using


both properties as suitable depots to
hold stock for the most favourable
market. After a few successful years
in these speculative purchases and
sales, he decided to go to Queensland,
where, in 1912, he selected his present
homestead block and two adjoining
selections, the three aggregating
about 40,000 acres, known by tne title
of “El Dorado,” and while these
were being formed into working
order he was engaged in cattle and
sheep buying for the Torrens Creek
Meat Export Co., Ltd. The sheep
on “El Dorado” are pure merinos
with “Afton Downs” ewes crossed by
“Strathdarr” rams, founded on the
best “Wanganella” blood, the wisdom
of the cross being shown in the price
of Is. being realized in 1919
for “El Dorado” wool in the grease.
The quality of the wool will always
clearly indicate the quality of the
sheep. Cattle-breeding is not included
in the “El Dorado” programme,
cattle being merely grazed there until
ready for market, and it is usual to
have about 2,000 Gulf-bred short-
horns roaming over the station.
In addition to this fine properly, Mr.
and Mrs. Lindsey-Browne conjointly
own “Clyde Park,” north of Hughen-
den on the Flinders River, a station
property still in the initial stage.
The homestead at “El Dorado” is a
very comfortable home and was
erected under the auspices of the
present owner. It has all round
verandahs and ingenious devices
providing against excessive heat and
the periodic visits of flies. Like the
great majority of successful men,
Mr. Lindsey-Browne is an enthusiast
in his work, and in the year 1919 was
a most successful exhibitor at the
Hughenden Pastoral and Agricul-
tural Show, being the winner of two
first prizes for cattle, three for sheep,
and four for horses, and the quite
unusual winner of a prize for every
exhibit, and this, too, against the
competition of some of the most
expert stock-breeders, and some of
the best herds in North Queensland.
For a number of years he has been
a consistent supporter of amateur
horse-racing in North-West Queens-
land, a sport he has always been
anxious to keep above suspicion, and
as an expert horseman he has won
prizes on his friends’ horses, and also
on his own swift-footed steeds, which
have acquired a fine healthy reputa-
tion in the North, particularly with
a very fast horse called “Malion,” a
kind of “Eclipse” or “Flying
Childers” among the famous equine
grass-fed sprinters at amateur race
meetings in the North. Mr. Lindsey-
Browne is a w r ell-known and popular
member of the Flinders Club at
Hughenden, one of the best organized
and influential clubs of Western
Queensland. In June, 1892, he
forsook the bachelor ranks and joined
the benedicts by marrying Miss
Florence Elizabeth McDonald, a
daughter of the late Robert
McDonald, who was in the early days
of Townsville, a well-known and very
popular contractor, “Bob McDonald”
being a general favourite, a man who
left an honoured name to his
descendants. Among other members
of the Lindsey-Browne family is the
present Brigadier-General Spencer
Browne, who, apart from his exalted
rank in the army, is a well-known
and capable pressman, being in early
years the editor of papers at Cook-
town, Townsville, and Brisbane,
editing in 1881 the Brisbane morning
daily Observer , now the evening
Observer, of Brisbane, and he has for
years been an associate editor and
"MALION.”
one of the leader writers of the
Brisbane Courier. He went through
the Boer War and the campaign in
Egypt during the recent war in
Europe.
