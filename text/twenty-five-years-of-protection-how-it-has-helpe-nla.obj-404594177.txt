TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
PROTECTION
How it has Helped Victoria.
CHAPTER I.
How shall we begin? Simply by coming to a good understanding.
Let us see how the controversial land lies.
The hurly-burly of political conflict does two
The Scope of opposite things. It often stimulates public inquiry
Present into the “dismal science,” but it necessarily blurs
Inquiry. the public judgment through the bias of partisanship.
We have lately gone through a strenuous tariff battle
in Victoria, with the result that we possess a more scientific Protection
than ever we had before.
New South Wales is in the vortex of the fiscal fight. And seeing
that the old controversy is still alive in England, with a decidedly
protectionist revival; that it is also agitating Canada and the United
States, the time is opportune for an historical review of how Protection
has built up Victoria.
The rival doctrines of Protection and Freetrade may be argued
from many standpoints. But there are chiefly three great divisions
of them—
1. The Ethical Aspect.
2. The Historical Aspect.
3. The Economic Aspect.
The ethical elements in the fiscal controversy touch the principles
of everlasting justice which underlie the Protectionist doctrine. And
those principles are capable of an absolutely logical demonstration.
The economic basis on which Protection rests involves a study of
more than mere wealth-getting. It reaches up to the highest social
functions of the race.


But the unity of my present design will not permit an excursion
into those regions. I propose to confine myself to the historical aspect
of the question, and to limit that historical survey to the colony of
Victoria.
I may say, just in passing, that Protection and
What History Freetrade have both a world-wide history. It
Teaches. is a history replete with instruction. I venture to
say that no one who studies that history apart
from any preconception will fail to find the results of ancient and
modern history alike condemning freedom of international exchange.
In Athens, Sparta, Carthage, Rome, Venice and Genoa, in earlier
times, Freetrade invariably led to national declension.
In England, Ireland, France, Germany, Russia, Holland, Turkey,
India, in modern times, it produced the same result.
Freetrade has always been the precursor of deeds that doom
empires.
For the present, however, these must be mere statements. They
are all capable of the amplest verification; but they do not come
within the scope of my present purpose, which is to consider Protection
as it has historically approved itself in Victoria.
How has Protection affected the progress of Victoria?
Method of There are those who say that it has retarded that
Inquiry. progress.
Let us see.
It is a very interesting inquiry if honestly and ingenuously made ;
and, fortunately we have peculiarly distinct data for it.
Victorian history may be divided into two periods of Freetrade
and Protection.
Starting from 1836, and coming down to the end of 1870, the
Colony had 35 years of Freetrade.
Starting with 1871 and ending with 1896, Victoria has had
26 years of a gradually perfected Protection.
That is the first comparison we shall make. But there is
second comparison equally legitimate.
The two Colonies of Victoria and New South Wales have grown
side by side. The mother colony had half a century’s start of her
daughter. But she had another advantage still more powerful. The
area of Victoria is 87,884 square miles. That of New South Wales
is 309,175. Victoria’s gold has roughly balanced New South Wales
coal.
Except for a period of semi-Protection, New South Wales has
followed the doctrine of Cobden.


Victoria for more than a quarter of a century has enjoyed a
Protectionist tariff.
A fair comparison of two such colonies cannot be without in-
struction.
We will first compare Victoria with herself.
Her Freetrade period from 1886 to 1870 comprises, literally
speaking, her golden age. In nine wonderful years of gold discovery,
between 1851 and 1860, the colony produced £100,000,000 worth of
the precious metal.
All the advantages, therefore, of that extraordinary time are with
the Freetrade period.
The corresponding disadvantage of rapid gold decline comes into
Victoria’s Protectionist period. How great that decline was, will be
seen thus: —
Value of Victorian gold raised in 1871 ••• £5,421,908
„ „ „ 1881 ... £3,435,400
„ „ „ 1891 ... £2,305,600
This is a decline of from £7 9s. per head to £2 per head. A
terrible declension of a great natural and national industry. Nor are
there, so far as I am aware, any extraneous circumstances to counter-
balance it.
Waiving, therefore, but not forgetting that immense stimulus to
national growth existing in the Freetrade period, but absent in the
Protectionist one, we will proceed to a careful comparison.
CHAPTER 11.
First we will take population.
Obviously the factor of primary importance to
1 essons national life is population. Without people Para-
from the dise be a waste.
Many=Headed. Tins truth is more apparent in new States than in
old ones. In settled nations it may sometimes
happen that the population rapidly increases where the Government is
bad, and where the means of sustenance do not maintain a correspond-
ing advance.
This was the case in Ireland in the first half of the present
century. It was also the case in Victoria during the first decade of
our gold fever, when the rush of population to our shores was quite
abnormal, and during which no provision was made for permanently
employing the floating population of the goldfields against a time
when the gold might fail.


But settled countries, as a broad and general rule, do not largely
increase their population without correspondingly providing for their
maintenance.
On the other hand new countries which are populated mainly by
immigration cannot attract and retain citizens by any other means
than offering superior promises of material comfort.
Therefore the growth of population, where other things are equal,,
is a significant test of a new country’s attractiveness. The following
figures show the increase of population in Victoria :—•

Freetrade (gold discovery) .. 97,489
Freetrade .. .. .. 537,847

Protection .. .. .. 1,177,444
This shows an average yearly increase during the first Freetrade
period of 6,079. In the period of the gold rush, from 1851 to 1860,
there was an average yearly increase of 55,784. In the third Free-
trade period, from 1860 to 1870, the average annual increase was
18,875. If we eliminate the abnormal period of the gold rush, and
take the 26 years of normal Freetrade, we find the average annual
increase was 11,000. In the 26 years of Protection, from 1870 to
1896, notwithstanding the gold decline, and the boom collapse, the
average annual increase has been 17,900. We have thus :
Average annual increase of population during
26 normal years of Freetrade ... ... 11,000
Average annual increase of population during
26 normal years of Protection ... ... 17,800
It might be thought that the larger' natural increase of the
Protectionist period accounts for the superiority. But that is not so.
The oversea immigrants in 25 years of Protection, exceeded the over-
sea emigrants by 215,422, or an annual average increase of 8617. In
the normal 26 years of Freetrade the oversea immigrants exceeded the
oversea emigrants by 111,084, or an annual average increase of 4272

Such are the facts respecting population. They show that in

That is all we need say here about the population test.

It is a fact not to be overlooked that the Freetrade period
exhibits violent fluctuations. The first year gave £4 16s. the second
five times as much, the third one-eighth of second, and the last less
than the first.
In the Protectionist period there is a constant advance, save in
the last year, which has been a time of unexampled depression.


CHAPTER IV.
It is a remarkable fact well worth the student’s
The Agricultural attention, that Freetrade and Agriculture have
Test. never been able to co-exist for any long period.
France, Turkey, India, Germany, Russia and
England have all shown it at different times.
All wealth in its primary forms must come from the land.
Therefore the conditions of ,a nation’s agriculture must ever remain one
of the tests of its well-being.
Agricultural progress in Victoria, as we know, has been very
rapid under our system of Protection. We glean the following from
the statistical summary of the Victorian Year Book , 1891: —•
Area of land cultivated at the end of
Freetrade period, 1870 ... 909,015 acres.
Area of land cultivated at the end of
Protectionist period, 1895 ... 2,980,299 acres.
This means a cultivated area, thus: —
Freetrade period ending 1870 ... 1.25 acres per capita.
Protectionist period ending 1895 ... 2.53 acres per capita.
We observe therefore that the land in cultivation is twice as
much per head as it was in the Freetrade era. New South Wales
in spite of its magnificent territory, is almost as backward in this
respect as Victoria was in her Freetrade days.
As it is with the land, so is it with the flocks and herds that
The feed upon the land. I saw the other day a slander circulated
Flock from Melbourne in a Sydney paper, that this colony is in the
Test, throes of disaster, because its total productivity is less than
that of New South Wales. It is, of course perfectly true that
Victoria has a less aggregate production than the mother colony, and
must always have, because New South Wales has 120 million acres
more than this colony has. But Mr. Coghlan himself, in the follow-
ing passage from his Seven Colonies p. 271, says that Victorian land
is put to more profitable use than that of the mother colony: —
“Thus Victoria occupies first position with an average primary production
of is 4d per square mile, while Western Australia has the lowest return of
£1 7s 2d. The following, as well as the preceding table, bears testimony to the
great natural resources of New Zealand, which has an average production per
head of 8s Bd, and per square mile of 7s 2d ;

What has Freetrade New South Wales got to show against a
record like that?
Victoria’s farming successes have always been achieved by
Victoria’s Protectionist Liberals. In this, as in every country of the
world—l repeat it after a diligent study of economic history—Pro-
tection and Agricultural prosperity have always gone together, just as
have Freetrade and Agricultural decline.
The story of how our farmers got their farms is not

Farms. agricultural settlement.
For the first 25 years of Victorian history the land
of the colony was held almost exclusively by Freetrade squatters.
They were strong and jealous and dominant. They ruled the country.
They virtually claimed it for their own. Those were the halcyon days
of the trade Importer, when all our bread-stuffs were brought to us in
ships; when every article of consumption was charged for at extortionate
prices; when fortunes were made in Flinders-lane in a few years; and
when anyone who ventured to hint that the colony could grow its own
wheat was denounced as an incendiary. A farmer in that day was a
mark for the most scathing contempt from the Freetrade press and
the Freetraders of the city; and for the anathemas of the Freetrade
squatters in the country.

gladly sold their country’s birthright of free government if they could
only have prevented agricultural settlement.
But they could not. The great Victorian Liberal party, which
always demanded protection for the trades of the towns, insisted on
protection to the tillers of the soil. The agents of the German Trade
Invasion would fain bring about once more this autocracy of wealth.

But we are told that high Protective duties crush the

Farmer. farmer. He has to sell his wheat and butter in the
outside markets of the world. He consumes taxed
manufactures. As a consumer he is taxed; as a producer he is not
protected.
We will examine each of these statements a little in detail.
First, as to the tariff crushing the farmer. Now, the Victorian
tariff has been framed with a special eye to give the farmer a
maximum of profit with a minimum of loss. Agricultural machinery
is all of it free. Cornsacks are free; so are manures, bone dust and
grass seed; so are fencing wire, cream separators and wire netting.
Portable engines, because sometimes used by farmers, have 10 per
cent, less duty on them than other engines.
Do I mean, then, to say that the farmer pays no customs duties ?
Not at all. The farmer does pay tariff duties; but I want to say on
this two things
1. Protection does protect the farmer.
2. Protection is not the cause of taxation to the farmer
to the extent of one sixpence.

First, “ Protection does protect the farmer.” You know that the
farmer produces, or can produce, about fifty articles which form a part
■of our daily consumption. Here are nearly forty of them, with the
protective duties specified to each taken from the Customs returns for
1895 :
Imports of Farming Products into Victoria for 1895.


Did not the millers demand permission to grist in bond, and was
not that permission refused them at the wish of the farmers ?
Is not that a very real and genuine protection to the farmer ?
Protection then does protect.
Now as to my second statement that “ Protection
Farmers does not cause any taxation on the farmer, not
not even to the extent of one solitary sixpence in the
Taxed year round.”
One Farthing I cannot do better than narrate what happened the
through other day in my own office. A very intelligent friend
Protection. of mine called, and in the course of conversation said ;
“I can’t help thinking that the farmer has to pay
the bulk of the tariff taxation.”
I looked at him in surprise, because I knew him to be a thought-
ful man. I said, “Will you be good enough to tell me how you
arrive at that conclusion ? ’ ’
He replied, “Certainly. I start with the assumption that all
imports are paid by exported commodities.”
“Certainly,” said I.
He said, “Well, the landed producer is our chief exporter. It is
his butter, cheese, wine, wheat and wool which mostly pay for what
we import.”
I answered again, “ Certainly.”
He continued, “We send out, say, £14,000,000 worth of goods.
We get, say £12,000,000, worth back. The £12,000,000 have to pay
the producers of the £14,000,000. But if the £12,000,000 have to pay
a duty of £2,000,000 a year to the Customs House, it seems clear that
it must be the producers of the £14,000,000 worth of exports who pay
it.”
I said, “I can assure you that is not a correct statement of what
really happens,”
He said, “Well, it so appears to me. I shall be very glad if you
can show me otherwise.”
“It is quite true,” I said, “that every country pays its imports
with exports. It has nothing else with which to pay them. When it
has not got sufficient exports to cover the cost of its imports, it goes
into debt until it can make up the difference. But something is true of
the nation which is not true of the individual. The farmer never
barters his butter for machines, or sugar, or any goods—never. He
sells his butter for gold and silver, or some other form of money credit.
The money price is always fixed, though no money passes. There
the transaction absolutely ends for him,”
My friend paused, and then slowly said, “ That is certainly true,
I must admit.”


1 continued —“It is so. And whether the farmer sells his
produce in Melbourne or in London, or across the counter of the local
store, it makes not a particle of difference. He sells for money, and for
nothing else. When he has got his gold, or his credit, he bjiys with
it, just the same as any other men, whatever he wants at the market
price.”
“Well,” he said, “I must concede that far,”
I then said, “Well, now, that absolutely settles the point as to
whether the farmer stands in any exceptional relation to the tariff.
We now come to the question of whether the tariff taxes him at all.
It is clear that if what the farmer buys are not dutiable goods, he pays
nothing.”
“ Granted,” said he.
“Very well,” said I. “ Whenever the farmer buys dutiable goods
he pays the duty, just the same as others. Now T last year we imported
into Victoria twelve and a half millions worth of commodities. On
those commodities there was paid £1,733,000 in duty. Every con-
sumer of dutiable goods had to pay his share of that £1,733,000. You
often see it stated in Freetrade prints that one-fourth of that
£12,500,000 worth of goods never reach the people at all —that they
are intercepted by the duty. That is simply untrue. All the goods
we buy abroad are bound to come to us.”
“ That is plain,” said my friend, “ I have always recognised that.”
“ Very well, then,” I answered. “ Before those goods reach the
Victorian consumers, the duty has to be paid, and the £12,500,000
worth of goods are charged roughly at £14,250,000. The duty amounts
to about £1 9s. sd. per head of the people. That is beyond all question
an impost on those who buy the imported articles.
Here my friend chimed in—“ Does not this prove, then, that
tariff duties are a tax ? ”
“ No,” said I. “ There lies the fallacy. Tariff duties tax us
beyond all question. So do the Land Tax, the Stamp Tax, the Income
Tax. But they are not a cause of taxation, which is the real question
at issue. This we may now see. We are at close logical quarters.
What becomes of the Tariff tax ? It goes into the Treasury to defray
the general expenses of the Government. If that £1,733,000 were wiped
out to-morrow, the Treasurer must find some other means of raising the
same sum of money from the same people; and the farmers must pay
their share of it.”
“ I begin to see,” said he.
“Of course, you do,” said I. “ That money must be got, either
from a poll tax, a pleasure tax, a property tax, an extra income tax, or
in some other way. Therefore, not one farthing of the Protective
Tariff duties paid into the Customs House is an extra tax on the people
at all. So far as they pay it they pay it in place of some other form of
taxation.”

CHAPTER VI.
My friend, tp whom I made the statement in the foregoing chapter
was frank enough to admit that the fact covered the ground.
But I have heard the ridiculous statement made that on
A very £10,000,000 worth of manufactured goods locally made in
absurd Victoria the price is raised about 80 per cent, to the con-
Fallacy. sumers in consequence of the tariff duties ;so that about
£2,600,000 a year, it is said, is paid by the people which
never goes into the Treasury at all, but into the pockets of the manu-
facturers. It is declared to be a law that the higher price which a
tariff duty puts on an imported article, raises the price of the locally-
made article in the same ratio, so that Victorian farmers pay £6 per
head or £B6 per family.
The falsity of this can be demonstrated by a single simple fact.
Hats and boots are now sold in Melbourne at a retail price which is
smaller than the amount of the duty payable on similar goods imported.
That one fact disposes for ever, with honest men, of the theory of a law
of prices which follows from the import duty to the domestic products.
But I shall not be content with this. The Freetraders who put
forward as facts these fatuous inventions have unconsciously landed
themselves in a logical absurdity which they may be glad to escape from.
There is nothing like the reductio ad absurdurn for disposing
A of folly.

Let us see how such a law would work out for the farmer.
Turn back to the Customs table given above. There is levied a
protective duty on those goods of 47‘66 per cent. We will now ascertain
what amount of our landed produce thus protected is consumed in the
colony. Taking the values of the products as we find them given in
the Victorian Year Book for 1894,” at pp. 732, 747, 752 and 795, we
get the following result: —
A close examination of the exports will not show more than
£2,700,000 of this exported. Consequently £10,200,000 worth was
consumed or retained in the colony.

Now the position we have arrived at is this. If
The Customs duties raise to the consumer the price of
Reductio all domestic produce by something more than the

dairymen, and others who raised this £10,200,000
worth of produce have had a sum of about £5,000,000 put into their
pockets by the protective duties.
This, of course, is a rank absurdity.
The landed producers have had no such

been maintained, so that last year the
farmer realised more profit than he would if there had been no failure
in the crops. This is shown in a budget paper presented to Parlia-
ment as folloAvs :

The Freetrader is therefore placed in this plight that if it be true,
as he says, that protective duties raise prices all round, the farmer has
been benefited to the extent of £5,000,000. And if it be not true then
the farmer has lost nothing by the tariff, and gained something by the
grain duties. This reduces the Cobdenist argument to an absurdity,
which is strictly its native position.
Under this heading of agriculture there is but one other
The thing I wish to add. Most people know what the German
Sugar Sugar Industry is. It has been built up by State help, and
Industry, it can challenge the world. We consume in Victoria about
1000 tons of sugar every week. We import it all. We
ought to grow every ton of it on our own fields. And we want to do it.
The Maffra sugar mill will soon bo built in a district where the soil and
climate are all that are required. The experiments made by some of
our analysts justify us in expecting as large a percentage of sugar from
Victorian beet as can be got in any part of the world. And yet without
Protection the sugar industry can no more succeed than it could have
done in France and Germany, in both of which countries it was well
protected and has yielded an ample return. Without adequate pro-
tection be given to sugar production the importer can crush every
• * /


attempt of our local farmers, and local mills. The German invader
would find this colony quite a happy hunting ground, while our farmers
and workers would stand idle.
A word as to our Victorian stock tax, which is described as
The such an anti-federal measure. In a speech made recently in
Stock Parliament Mr. M‘Lean quoted official statistics to show that
Tax. it has given to Victorian stock breeders the command of the
local markets. In cattle Victorian breeders have sold more by
1000 a week than they did before the tax, and of sheep a million a year.
The prices have been steady instead of fluctuating, while the consumer
has got his meat a little lower than before.
That is a short statement of how Protection has benefited the farmer
in Victoria.
CHAPTER VII.
I once heard a Freetrade speaker say in the Victorian Parliament
that Protection has retarded the national growth of the colony. He
gave no facts or figures in support of his statement. He might as well
have said the Frigid Zone is at the Equator.
When thoughtless people, or designing people, tell us
Who that Protection has retarded our national growth in
are our Victoria we may ask two questions—Who are they?
Traducers. What is their evidence?
I say we should first ask who they are because Free-
traders are of two kinds. There is the sincere man who is a Free-
trader because his father was, or his friend is, who has no time in busy
life to think it out for himself, but who lazily puts on his belief as he
puts on the coat which his tailor made for him.
But there is another class much less tolerant and tolerable.
The They are Freetraders because in trade they can find their
German individual profit. Amongst these latter you will find the
Swarm, übiquitous agents of the German trade invader. They are
parasites who swarm everywhere over the the world’s
surface. Their business is to undermine the industry of all nations,
careful only that German houses can increase their export. They do
this by the most reckless and impudent falsification of current history.
The facts sets out in Mr. E. E. Williams’s book, Made in Germany, show
how these foreign trade agents infest the various countries of the world.
In Victoria they are well known. That is who they are. What is
their evidence of national retardation ?
I have shown that in the point of population and agricultural pro-
gress, Victoria has a strong lead, head for head, and acre for acre, over


any other Australasian colony. But there are other evidences of national
growth. The following table shows something about seven of the
foremost of our institutions:—

find it nearly equalled there. We will see another instance.

This last table speaks for itself. In the year 1870, after 35 years
of Freetrade, during which the colony had produced nearly
£150,000,000 worth of gold, the rateable property was worth only £66
per head of the people. But after 23 years of Protection, with its
concomitant land settlement and industrial development, the municipal
property had grown to a rateable value of £l6l per head.
New South Wales is confessedly far behind Victoria in municipal
development.
CHAPTER VIII.
This is a field which has been selected by the
Manufacturing enem i es of national industries for special mis-
Success representation. I purpose to lay bare a few of the
Indispensable deceptions, and to set forward the irrefragable facts
to a as ex i s k
Nation’s Everyone admits that progress in the arts and

people never yet developed the complete qualities of the race; nor ever
can do so; because the faculties of man are as various as his needs, and
require scope and opportunity for their development.
The embryo inventor, if confined to the avocations of the farm,
would live and die with his talents untested, and unused. Diversity of
occupation, therefore, is more essential for the true progress of the
nation than even the acquisition of material wealth.
No nation ever has developed or ever can properly develop a
national system of manufactures under Freetrade. This is true even
of England.
Victoria made little progress in manufacture under Freetrade, and
therefore we have no basis of comparison between her earlier and her
later advances.
Previous to 1881 the Victorian statist gives us no data
Factories — concerning the products of Victorian factories. But
their taking the total number of the factories themselves we
Number have the following in the summary of the Victorian
and Year Book , 1894, at p. 774 : —lB7O, total Victorian
Character. factories (exclusive of flourmills), 1,432; 1884, 2,777;
1889, 2,975; 1894, 2,677.
Referring to the later number the statist says, p. 768 Victorian
Year Book, 1894 :
No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufactu-
ring industry may be carried on thereat. Were this done, the manufactories of
the colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent.
What had happened in the changing circumstances of the colony
was that a number of registered factories had closed, and a large
number of smaller shops, below the regulation status of a factory, had
been opened.
It is therefore abundantly clear that no true data as to manufac-
turing production can be drawn from the registered factories.
Fortunately, however, we have another means of comparison. We
can now compare Victorian manufacturing growth with that of the
mother colony—the growth of Protectionist Victoria with that of Free-
trade and semi-Protectionist New South Wales.
In making this comparison great care is necessary, because the
methods employed by the statists in the two colonies differ very
widely.
Mr. Fenton, the present assistant statist in Victoria,
Factory confirming the judgment of Mr. Hay ter, his late
Test chief, says in a communication addressed to the Age on
Fallacious. December 29, 1895 :
My opinion is that Mr. Coghlan takes account of more than
wt do. He includes in his figures many establishments as factories that we do
not, and thereby swells the number of hands. He seems to go on his own basis,
and to have his own ideas, without the least regard for uniformity. Of course,
after all is only a matter of opinion as to what constitutes a factory.

But besides this, the law as to what constitutes a factory is not
the same in the two colonies. Moreover the mechanics in Victoria
employed outside of factories number 35,841, according to the Victorian
statist, who gives us this table, p. 775, Victorian Year Book, 1894:
Commenting on this remarkable discrepancy the statist (p. 775,
Victorian Year Book, 1894) says: —
This is to be accounted for by the circumstance that the census returns
embrace every individual blacksmith, tinsmith, saddler, cabinetmaker, tailor,
dressmaker, baker and such like; whereas the latter [annual returns] include, as
already stated, only the workers employed in the principal establishments. It
should be pointed out, moreover, that the difference is really greater than shown;
for there is no doubt that some of the manufacturers include as “ hands employed ”
clerks and accountants, salesmen, engineers and firemen, carters, labourers, and
others attached to their establishments, who are not actually engaged in manu-
facturing ; whereas the census figures are restricted to manufacturers, pure and
simple.
With these warnings before us we shall be able to guard ourselves,
in the search for truth, against drawing any deductions from the annual
returns of “ hands employed ” in factories. But there are other
sources of very positive information. These are the census returns.
Here, for example, is one statement of fact, taken from
yijg the Victorian Year Book for 1894, p. 776 :
True Basis According to the census returns of the Australasian colonies,
of the number of persons engaged in manufacturing in Victoria
Comnarison are more numerous and bear a higher proportion to the popula-
” * tion than do the corresponding classes in any of the other
colonies. Next to Victoria, the highest position is occupied by
New Zealand, and the next by New South Wales, Tasmania being at the bottom
of the list. The number and proportion in each colony were as follows :

later reliable returns.
{Wealth and Progress,


The last year for which there are full particulars is 1892. It was then
ascertained that the total value of articles produced, or, where manufacturing in
its restricted sense is not carried on, the increased value to materials from treat-
ment was £16,098,630 ; the value of materials used, including fuel, was £8,299,840;
and the difference, £7,798,790, represents the production.
The Victorian Statist has nothing to guide us, subsequent to 1891,
save the percentages of factory decline, which he estimates at 30 per
cent. He gives us no guide at all to the numbers employed outside
registered factories since the above date.
Taking this as it stands, it completely establishes Victorian
superiority at the latest dates available. It was certainly incumbent on
the detractors of this colony, to show, if they could, that these census
returns—all said to be accommodated to the same basis—were delusive.
That has never been done. But these figures do not present the Vic-
torian case in the strongest legitimate light. The Victorian Statist
acknowledges (p. 774) that he has taken from the census returns of this
colony 4303 “ painters, plumbers, and locksmiths.”
We are now in a position to bring down the figures to date, so far
as mere statistical estimates can aid us. The Victorian Statist (p. 795,
Victorian Year Book , 1894) estimates the declension in factory production
at 80 per cent., or a fall from £10,694,000 to £7,486,000. Mr. Coghlan
(Wealth and Progress, 1894, p. 553) estimates the factory product decline
in New South Wales at from £7,798,000 in 1892 to £6,726,000 in 1894 ;
but he adds £900,000 for work done out of the factories, and sets
down the total at an estimate of £7,626,000. Mr. Fenton gives us no
help as to how much is earned by his 35,000 people who manufacture
outside factories, and whose numbers have almost certainly increased
during recent years. But if we estimate their earnings on the same
basis as that employed by Mr. Coghlan ( Wealth and Progress, 1894.
p. 554) their work would be worth £1,575,000.
Fastest We have thus for the latest dates of comparison
Estimated manufacturing products for the two colonies as
Comparison follows:

These are the nearest comparisons which can be made for the
later dates. But they are largely conjectural, as both Statists admit.
We will now submit the ascertained comparisons as fixed by census,
including raw material:—

New South Wales Manufactures, 1891. —

Mr. Coghlan says ( Seven Colonies, p. 268) : —-
The colony of Victoria is, perhaps, of all the colonies the possessor of the
most varied classes of industries.
It is on these broad figures, and on facts analogous, that the
relative growth of manufactures in the colonies must be decided. They
are simply unanswerable. They move the dispute from the domain of
argument and fix it on a basis of plain, irrefutable fact.
The proofs are abundant that shops and small unregistered
factories are greatly more numerous here than in the mother colony.
Therefore, to present statistics of industry which ignore these is either
fatuous or dishonest.
We can now sum up the total productiveness of the two colonies,
deducing the totals for Victoria from the Victorian Year Book, 1894,
pp. 782, 752, 773, 794, 795; and for New South Wales from
Wealth and Progress p. 569 :

As to the last table of figures, there is but one explanation
required. In the two colonies the dairying returns do not embrace the
same items, poultry farming being included in the New South Wales
dairying returns. In Victoria the Statist includes it in miscellaneous.
Victoria, therefore beats New South Wales all along the line, save for
the mines and pasture lands, which are of course independent of
Protection.
CHAPTER IX.
I now come to a test which many people regard as
The the epitome of all—Accumulation.
Accumulation We have seen how, regarded from the population test,
Test. Victoria progressed in her Protectionist period twice
as rapidly as she did in her Freetrade period, and
this in spite of the fact that under Freetrade immigration was
assisted, while under Protection it was voluntary. We have also
noticed that this capacity to attract population continued in Victoria
through twenty years of a gold decline from £7 9s. per head to £2 per
head. We saw also that Victoria has 18 people to the square mile,
while New South Wales has only four.
Next we observed how Protection brought with it, as it always does,
an agricultural development that has put Victoria at the head of the
Australian group in the matter of farm settlement.
In the chapter immediately preceding this, we have proved from a
candid examination of the Statists of both colonies that Victoria stands
far in advance of New South Wales in her manufactures.
We will now ascertain what is the net result of these three sources
of wealth. If we have more people per square mile than any of our
neighbours, a greater agriculture than any other colony in the group,
and a more extended system of manufactures, we ought to be able to
show the results of these things in a greater degree of opulence.
That is exactly what we can show, and show beyond the possibility
of fair contradiction.
No Protectionist who knows his creed will regard mere accumu-
lation as the be-all and end-all of national well-being. Far from it.
Wealth-getting is but one out of many human aims. It is an
important aim, doubtless. But not even the highest of many.
The most perfectly productive people will be not those
Material who have most assiduously cultivated acquisitiveness,
Wealth but those who have learned to develop human nature
but in all its infinite diversities of talents.
w o^° rm W hen the Protectionist so strongly insists on the
Wealth fostering of varied industries, even at the temporary
apparent cost of some, he does so quite as much in order


to provide diversified avocations for a diversity of talents as to add to
the general stock of acquired wealth. He knows that a merely pastoral
people, or an agricultural people, a nation of vignerons, or of fruit-
growers, can never contain all the elements which lead to the highest
development of men in community. Such people may possibly grow
opulent; they can never grow great. They lack the intellectual
stimulus that gives birth to invention. As iron sharpeneth iron, so
mind quickens mind ; but this is true only when men live and work
under such diverse employment as offers the requisite opportunity to
budding genius.
Nevertheless, with these limitations, we must
admit that the accumulated wealth of a people
is a fair gauge of national progress. I will
Wealth therefore compare the accumulated wealth of
v ey s us the two colonies of New South Wales and
New South Wales Victoria. In the Victorian Year Book, 1890-91,
Wealth. V ol., i ? p. 471, will be found the following
passage: —
The property- left by deceased persons aftords an indirect means of
ascertaining approximately the private wealth of the population, for it may be
supposed that the average amount left by each person dying is equivalent to the
average amount possessed by each person living. The only Australasian colony
besides Victoria in which calculations as to the wealth of the population have
been published, based upon the amounts left by persons who died, is New South
Wales. The result of such a calculation for four periods of five years is as
follow :

The comment made on this by the "V ictorian Statist is as
follows: —
It should be explained that the figures given represent only the property
possessed by private individuals, no estimate being made of the value of Crown
lands Government or municipal buildings, churches, hospitals, libraries, museums,
mechanics’ institutes, State schools, forts, artillery, lighthouses, war vessels, rail-
ways telegraphs, &c. Also that the figures no doubt understate the truth, as a
considerable amount of property is taken over by relatives without any declaration
of value or issue of probate, or letter of adminstration, and that in order to reduce
as much as possible the amount to be paid as succession duty the properties are
frequently declared at less than their full value.
The official figures in Victoria are not brought down later than
1889. So far as that table extends it is significant. The two colonies
named started in 1870 in their industrial race, with the Victorian
people £3B per head better off than those of New South Wales. In

the last year of the return the Victorians were registered as £BO per
head better off than their neighbours.
The whole of this progress was made under Protection in Victoria
and mostly under Freetrade in New South Wales. The Victorian gain
has been made notwithstanding that the territory of the mother colony
is more than three times as large as Victoria. These Victorian
accumulations have been made, too, during a period of mining
collapse that must have meant ruin had it not been for a corresponding
manufacturing development.
It is but right to say that the Victorian Statist has discontinued
that mode of comparison, because, as he tells me, he finds it in one
sense delusive. The average ages of those who die are greater than the
average ages of the living; and as the average man at 60 is -wealthier
than the average man at 30, it follows that the average bequests of
the dying are not a perfect gauge of the average possessions of the
living.
This must be admitted to be so; but it does not in the smallest
degree impair their usefulness as a means of comparison between
neighbouring colonies, and as a method of comparison between
different periods in the same colony.
For this reason I think the Victorian Statist has been ill-advised
in discontinuing the system. Mr. Coghlan has a keener appreciation
of its value, and still employs it, as we shall see, after his own fashion.
I have turned to the New South Wales Statist for his views on
this question, and strange to say, I find both a confirmation and a
contradiction of the Victorian Statist.
In Mr. Coghlan’s Seven Colonies , 1894, p.
The 291, he tells us that he pursued the same system
New South Wales for some years, but found it inconclusive,
Statist’s because the ages of those dying were not the
Account. same as those living, and elderly people, as a
rule, are wealthier than their juniors. He,
however, acknowledges the system to be of great statistical usefulness,
since it affords evidence as to the average size of estates. These he
compares for a period of 12 years; and Victorian private wealth is
shown by him to be very considerably greater than that of New South
Wales, and much more equally distributed. Thus :


This is extended at p. 292 as follows:
Victoria, 1890-2—Number of estates left per 100 deaths of
the total population, 17 - 2 per cent., or 1 in 6 who
died.
New South Wales, 1890-2—Number of estates left per
100 deaths of the total population, 12-5 per cent., or
1 in 8 who died.
Victoria, 12 years 1880-92 —Number of estates left per 100
deaths of the total population, 14-8 or 1 in 7 who
died.
New South Wales, 12 years 1880-92 —Number of estates
left per 100 deaths of the total population, 11-36., or
1 in 9 who died.
Now it must be manifest from what has been said that these re-
turns of the Victorian and New South Wales Statists, differing as they
do in degree, are one in the conclusion that the value of property be-
queathed over a long course of years is greater in Victoria than it is
in New South Wales. Moreover, Mr. Coghlan brings his figures down
to 1890-2. He shows that in those years lin every 6of the people
who died in Victoria left an estate valued on an average at £3,014;
that only 1 in 8 dying in New South Wales left an estate, which in
average value was £2145.
When we divide the average value of these bequeathed estate of
the two colonies by the total number of persons who died we find the
account stand thus:—
Victoria.—Average amount bequeathed in 1892 by
each person dying ... ... ... ... £502
New South Wales.—Average amount bequeathed in
1892 by each person dying ... ... ... £268
These are the deductions from Mr. Coghlan’s figures. I do not
believe that the discrepancy between the wealth of the two colonies is
so great as would appear from the single year of 1892. But if we
take his figures for 12 years, as given above, and divide by the respective
factors as before, we find the result: —Victoria, private wealth, £387
per head; New South Wales, £284. This means that for every person
who died in Victoria for that 12 years there was bequeathed an average
sum of £387; for every person who died in New South Wales in the
same period a sum of £284 was left to the living.
I now approach what I consider the most important of all my
demonstrations.
Mr. Coghlan tell us in his Seven Colonies, 1894 (p. 288), that he
has another and superior method of ascertaining the wealth of the
colonies. In New South Wales he takes the census returns of the
property valuations. He says:—


The Census Act was so framed that every holder of land was required to

the present estimate was compiled.
For Victoria he takes the municipal valuations, and the result he
brings out is as follows:

This at the first sight appears to conflict with
A Mr, Coghlan’s results as previously published, in
curious which he agreed with the Victorian Statist that the
Corroboration, value of bequeathed Victorian property has always
been much larger in the aggregate and per capita
than that of New South Wales.
But the antagonism is only in seeming. We shall see directly that
it really confirms the deductions drawn from the probate returns. It
will be noted that the above table gives the private wealth in the
colony; not that which belongs to the colonists. The value of New
South Wales land and buildings is set down {Seven Colonies , p. 289) at
£808,000,000, but, as a matter of fact, while this is properly credited
in Mr. Coghlan’s census papers to New South Wales, a great deal of
it is owned by Victorian investors. We have to try and find out, if we
can, how much of the New South Wales landed property is owned in
this colony.
The Victorian Statist in the Victorian Year Book, 1894, p. 457
says:—
It should be remembered that the Victorian returns of imports and exports
are each year largely swelled by the value of wool brought to Melbourne from the
neighbouring colonies for convenience of shipment. It should be remembered,
however, that a large portion of this belongs to Victorian capitalists.
Just so. This should be remembered. But it is just the thing
which is not apprehended at all by some glib manipulators of
statistics.
CHAPTER X.
The Victorian Year Book shows us that for more than
Victoria twenty years past Victoria has been steadily increasing the
a excess of her intercolonial imports over the amount of
Lending 1 exports which she sends to her neighbours. The facts
Colony, concerning this are well known. Victorian capitalists have
generally found their funds more abundant than the local
means of investment, and the broad pastures of Queensland, New
South Wales, and South Australia, have afforded profitable open-
ings for Victorian money. A good deal of Victorian capital has

Here we have a sum of £81,239,154, after deducting the excess
of exports for 1888, which Victoria has received from the neighbouring
colonies in
excess of what she has paid to them.
It amounts to an
likewise found investment in Sydney mercantile businesses, in the
silver mines of Broken Hill, in the coal mines of Newcastle, and more
recently in the gold mines of Coolgardie. Victorian capital has in the
same manner found investment in New Zealand and even Fiji. The
profits on these investments naturally flow to this colony in the shape
of imports, and Victoria has received from her neighbours £50,800,000
in excess of the exports which she has sent in return.
Earlier numbers of the Victorian Year Booh show that
The in the 11 years from 1870 to 1880, both inclusive,

Victorians invested abroad very extensively, so that
they exported more than they received.
The following are the Statist’s figures for the 18 years ending
1895. The first 11 years are found at p. 480 of the Victorian Year
Booh, 1894. The remaining two years are obtained from Mr. Fenton: —
thus: —

ments, apart from State and municipal

Here, then, in round numbers, we have had sent to us from
our neighbours in 26 years, fifty millions worth of commodities over
and above what we have sent away to them. As the Statist says, they
have not had to be counterbalanced, as is usually the case, by a
corresponding export.
For the last thirteen years, as we have seen, that income has
averaged £2,408,000 a year. All the facts seem to me to show that
this sum is the true approximate measure of Victoria’s profits on her
intercolonial investments.
I will now give what appear to me to be the
jhg proofs of this.
Proofs Mr. Coghlan (p. 302 Seven Colonies , 1894) says
of the annual sum of this profit due to Victoria is
Victoria’s Income only £1,800,000, but he gives us no data for his
from conjecture.
Abroad. It j s sometimes said that Victoria receives the
Riverina wool for shipment only. That is partly
true j but as the Victorian Statist has told us “a large proportion of
this belongs to the Victorian capitalists,” and the profit on it is
necessarily retained in this colony. The Victorian Year Book, 1894
p. 493, says:—
It is known that large sums have been received by the colony in the shape
of dividends from the Broken Hill silver mines, and other investments in the
neighbouring colonies, which amounts, being clear profit, have, as a matter of
course, not be counterbalanced, as is usually the case, by a corresponding export.
The New South Wales Statist is still more explicit and circum-
stantial. At p. 300, Seven Colonies, 1894, I find the following
passage:—
So far as Victoria and South Australia are concerned there have also to be
considered the earnings derived by local residents from their own outside invest-
ments. In the case of Victoria the earnings of investments of non-residents and
incomes of absentees were less than the income derived by residents in the colony
from investments abroad until the year 1888. 1
And then the Statist gives us a table which is simply conclusive
as to Victorian wealth outstripping that of New South Wales. Here
are extracts from it:—
1871-1892. —Victoria, nil. But Victoria actually received a sum
of £4,157,000 in excess of what she had to pay away.
One more illustration:—
Net interest paid by New South Wales 1870
to 1892 (loans included) £62,615,000
Do do Victoria do 21,395,000


There is an indirect means of reaching to almost a certainty con-
cerning this matter. Mr. Coghlan has told us that “ the colony of
Victoria is perhaps of all the colonies the possessor of the most varied
classes of industries.” We knoAV he has also told us that, territory for
territory, “Victoria occupies the first position, with an average primary
production of £226 per square mile,” while New South Wales has only
£B7 per square mile. (Seven Colonies, 1894, p.p. 268, 271). We
should expect to find these developments have given Victoria an
accumulated wealth in a corresponding degree. We shall find, before
concluding, that that is just what has happened.
If we capitalise our intercolonial profits of £2,408,000 on a 4 per
cent, basis, it gives us a total investment abroad of £60,200,000. A
large portion of this sum will have to be taken from the New South
Wales totals of wealth, and added to Victorian totals, and this being
done, the figures will harmonise very nearly indeed With the revelations
of the probate returns, as supplied by the several Statists.
The only matter which remains to be determined, is as to
whether Mr. Coghlan’s estimate of or the sum of
£2,408,000 indicated by the intercolonial trade balance, is the true
index to Victorian income from beyond her borders. There are no
means that lam aware of for absolutely determining this; but all the
inferences point to the fact that Victoria, like other states and colonies,
liquidates her foreign liabilities through her imports and exports, and
the preceding figures are only just short of demonstration that
Victoria’s trade balance is her profit.
An esteemed correspondent with whom I have consulted on this
subject, says : “ I think Victoria’s annual profit is understated by you.
It is scarcely fair to strike the average excess of our imports over the
years when we were sowing the seed, in order to reap the harvest.
From 1870 up to 1886, Victorians were investing large sums of money
in the other colonies, and of course the exports were going out as in-
vestments. Therefore, the real profits commenced from the latter
date, and the yearly average profit should, to my mind, be spread only
over the years 1886 to 1896.”
Wo are now in a position to check Mr. Coghlan’s estimate that
New South Wales has private wealth belonging to her citizens of £368
per head, based on census returns, while that of Victoria, compiled
from municipal valuations, is /"304. We see that beyond all question
a considerable part of that which he credits to New South Wales has
to be transferred to the credit of citizens of this colony.
When the necessary transfer to Victorian wealth is made from
Mr. Coghlan’s census figures of New South Wales land and improve-
ments, the results obtained from that mode of calculation will almost
completely corroborate the relative proportions of wealth obtained by
a comparison of the probate returns of the two colonies. These tend


to show that Victorian citizens as an average are about 20 per cent,
more wealthy than those of New South Wales.
This is how Protection has “retarded ” the national progress of
Victoria.
CHAPTEE XL
I reach my last words; but they are important
The Test ones.
of the The previous chapters have prepared us to
Gross and Net understand that in the accumulation of material
National Assets wealth, Victoria has done just what an intelligent
and Protectionist would have predicted of her. Head
Indebtedness. for head, her people have outstripped all Australa-
sian competitors.
I propose to follow up the preceding demonstration of this in a
manner which I think is unexceptionable and yet new. This will be
by placing a statement of Victorian assets opposite to one of Victorian
indebtedness.
It is a really remarkable fact that as yet no serious attempt has
ever been made to ascertain this colony’s real indebtedness. The
Government Statist posts us definitely, of course, as to our public
debts, but is as vague as most people are as to the private loans from
abroad. He tells us
No reliable information is available respecting the amount of private
borrowings, but it is known they are extensive.
In this, however, he has failed, as we shall see, to make use of
all the information at his disposal.
To speak of private borrowings as “ extensive,” without giving
us any approximate idea of what the term means, offers just that
scope to the imagination which romancers delight in.
■ I have heard people guessing that our private borrowings had
reached Others, aping moderation, conjectured that we
might have gone as far as More careful reckoners
have thought they saw their way to bring down our total private
indebtedness to /”80,000,000 or /90,000,000.
I propose here to set that question definitely at rest. The method
is not at all recondite. Anyone may understand it.
We begin with the principle that all borrowings, public
The and private, must come to a gold exporting country in
method the form of commodities. In this lies our clue. The
employed. ■ exports of a nation must pay for its imports in order
to maintain a balance of trade.


The old notion about there being large profits on all round trade-
is an exploded fallacy. So is the suggestion sometimes made that
there is a certain debt against us for cost of transit of our exports or
imports. The Government Statist says (p, 410 Victorian Year Book,
1894)
The Customs valuations are made upon the following principle. In the
case of the imports, goods on which ad valorem duties are payable are by law
appraised at their fair market value in the principal markets of the country
whence they were exported, with io per cent added. Valuations of other imported
goods may be practically said to be their cost price on landing, i.e., their invoice
values with the addition of freight and charges. In the case of the exports, the
values returned are presumed to be the actual values in the local markets at the
time of shipment.
This is a safe rule to follow —to balance exports against imports
in our own ports, because the foreigner has to payior our goods, plus
the cost of carriage to him, as we have to pay for his plus the same
cost to us.
What we have to do, then, is to ascertain all that is due from us
to the foreigner for all commodities and interest on same, as well as
every other form of debt. We can then ascertain what we have paid,
and the remainder is our indebtedness.
First, there will come the total value of the imports
Total received into Victoria from thb year 1887 to 1895 inclusive.
Imports This value amounts to £698,500,000. The total value of
and our exports from 1837 to 1895 inclusive is £617,500,000.
Exports. Deduct these one from the other and we get a total sum of
£81,000,000 which we have imported in excess of what we
have exported.
If we turn to p. 492 of the Victorian Year Book, we may test those
figures. The net excess of imports over exports is there set down up
to 1893 at £84,116,309. When this is brought up to December, 1895,
the net excess of imports is £80,485,974. We may therefore with
great certainty set down in round figures £80,500,000 as our total
debit for imports.
The next item is that of interest.. The sum total which
Victoria has had to pay on State and municipal and corporation loans
up to the end of 1895 was about £38,050,000. This is made up as
follows: —
Interest to end of 1870 (See Victorian Year
Book, p. 205) £6,000,000'
Interest from 1871-92 (See Seven Colonies
p. 301) 25,550,000
Interest from 1893-95 (See Victorian Year
Book, p. 245) .. 4 6,500,000
£38,050,000


We have now to ascertain, as near as may be the interest which
has accrued and been paid on our private borrowings. Mr. Coghlan
says (Seven Colonies, 1894 p, 301) that Victoria received in this
way up to 1892 £4,157,000 from her investments abroad more than
she paid.
We have already seen that Victoria received something over
£50,000,000 as profits from the other colonies from 1870 t0°1895.
If Mr. Coghlan’s figures are correct she had thus to pay about
£46,000,000 in the same time to foreign private investors.
These three items—our excess of imports, the interest on our
public debt, and the interest on our private borrowings—constitute
our total indebtedness. They are as follows ;
Excess value of imports over exports from
1837 to 1895, inclusive £80,500,000
Total interest accruing on public debts ... 38,050,000
Total interest on private borrowings
46,000,000
Total £164,550,000
It is sometimes supposed that the incomes of absentees form a
considerable debt to be added to this list. But that is not so. It is,
of course, quite true that all such incomes form a liability against the
colony and have to be liquidated by our exports. Mr. Coghlan
(Seven Colonies, p. 294) estimates the income which Australasia had to
pay absentees in 1892 was £BlO,OOO. Victoria’s share of that would
be perhaps one-fourth. But absenteeism was practically unknown in
Victoria until about 1870; and since that time European absentees
and visitors resident amongst us have virtually balanced the account
for Victorian absentees. We may, therefore, ignore the absehtee
liability.
Some financiers have suggested another form in which we may
have incurred debt. Foreign capital has been privately invested here,
and Ave OAye for it to the investor. That is quite true; but as every
pound of it came to us in the form of imports, it has been already
counted in that item.
Some property has come to us Avith immigrants, and some has
been carried away by emigrants. These also may be said to balance
each other, and to form little or nothing of a disturbing factor in the
sum. Caterers for public amusement may be included in this class.
We must now find the per contra—the credit side of the Victorian
account. The first item after our exports, already balanced against
imports, is the £50,800,000 Avhich this colony received on its foreign
investments. That sum came to us in imports, and is debited against
us in the figures above. But as it Avas our oAvn, Ave have noAv to


place it to our credit. Then there is a third item. The private invest-
ments made by old countries in new ones are always in process of part
liquidation in two ways. Some of the investors become residents, and
the earnings are no longer a debt due to foreigners. In other cases,
the foreign money is lost by the failure of the projects, on the security
of which it was lent. This was a marked feature of the boom collapse.
It has been estimated by Mr. Coghlan (Seven Colonies, 1894, p. 295)
that our foreign borrowings have been liquidated in the first of these
two ways by a sum of £12,082,000. By failure of dividend-earning
companies there has been wiped out a very large total of indebtedness.
Precision is not possible in this matter, but there are means
of reaching approximate estimates. In the Argus of November 26,
1896, the following appears;—
The Senior Official Receiver in London, in declaring a further dividend of
6d. in the £x under the winding up of the Federal Bank of Australia Limited,
states various distributions he has made to British creditors of Melbourne
institutions, as follows:
Dividend. Amount.
s. d. £
Mercantile Bank of Australia .. .. .. 6 8 339,584
Mercantile Finance, Trustees, and Agency
Company .. .. .. .. .. 26 36,955
City of Melbourne Bank .. .. .. 34 431,324
Federal Bank of Australia .. .. .. 76 455,665
The total amount thus distributed is £1,289,031, this sum, of course repre-
senting in a sense withdrawal of capital from the colony. If the British creditors
are to be satisfied in full, they have still to receive the following sums ;
Mercantile Bank of Australia ... ... ... ... £679,168
Mpt'/'antilft rinonpp _ r, .-r.
Mercantile Finance, &c., Company ... ... ... £258,685
City of Melbourne Bank £2,156,620
Federal Bank £759,442
The total is £3,853,9x5. Most of this amount the British creditors stand
to lose.
So that in four companies alone, the foreign investor will stand
to lose near £4,000,000. It will certainly be a moderate estimate if
we suppose that in 59 years foreign investors have lost £20,000,000 in
the colony by their own rash speculations. We have, therefore, to
place against our import and interest bill the following:—
Total profits on intercolonial investments
from 1879 to 1895 £50,800,000
Total capital introduced by persons taking
up their abode in the colony (see Seven
Colonies p. 295) 12,082,000
Total losses by foreign investors 20,000,000
Total £82,162,000


end of 1895
60/200,000
Net YicWian indebtedness ...
... £22,188,000
We may now bring our results together, and the debtor and
creditor side of the colony will be found to stand thus :
Total indebtedness from excess of imports
and interest on borrowings £164,550,000
Less credits from investments abroad, from
immigrants’ capital, and foreign in-
vestors’ losses ... ... ... ... 82,162,000
Total debt owed by Victoria abroad ... £82,888,000
This indebtedness may be classed as follows: —
Public, municipal and quasi public debts
payable abroad, 1898, (see Victorian
Year Book p. 245) ... ... ... £48,876,600
Private foreign interest-bearing investments 38,511,400
£82,388,000
There remains one other calculation to be completed. Victoria
has for many years received from abroad profits averaging £2,408,000
per annum. These capitalised on a 4 per cent, basis give us invest-
ments abroad of the value of £60,200,000. If we subtract our foreign
assets from our foreign debts the balance will stand thus :
Total foreign Victorian public and private
debt ... ... ••• ••• £82,388,000
Total Victorian investments abroad at the
As against this net indebtedness Victoria has public works worth
more than twice the amount. The Government Statist tells lis
{Victorian Year Book, 1894, p. 245) that the total interest payable abroad
in 1893 on our State and quasi public loans was £1,972,762. The in-
terest she has to transmit for private foreign investments, counting
5 per cent, on thirty-three millions, may amount to £1,675,000 more.
Against this she receives £2,408,000 in profits from abroad. The
interest account, therefore, stands thus: —
Victorian interest on public and quasi loans,
payable abroad ... ... ... ... £1,972,000
Victorian interest on foreign private invest-
ments payable abroad ... ... ... 1,675,000
Total interest payable abroad ... ... £3,647,000
Deduct for interest receivable on intercolonial
investments ... ... ... 2,408,000
Net interest payable abroad by Victoria
£1,239.000


No other colony stands in a position comparable to this. Mr.
€oghlan estimates that the total interest payable by New South Wales
is over £5,000,000 a year, because in addition to her public borrow-
ings, she has to provide for the absentee owners of her property.
I do not claim complete accuracy for the figures here submitted.
They are susceptible of possible adjustment in the light of further
facts. But they represent the case as far as it is at present known.
And they confirm and corroborate the facts which are known and
proved, and which give Victoria an industrial development and an
aggregate of accumulated wealth, far surpassing those of New South
Wales or any other Australasian colony.
I will add only two or three other comparisons, taken from the
Victorian Year Book , pp. 208, 203, 226, 229, 287: —

Just a word of recapitulation. We started this enquiry by com
paring the Victorian Freetrade and Protectionist eras.
1. We have shown in the Population test that Protection has
always been more attractive than Freetrade.
2. W r e have shown again that in the great Agricultural industry
—the back-bone of all other' industries—Victoria has made all her
progress under Protection, and outstripped all her neighbours.
3. We have shown, also, that in all the institutions which lend
stability to society, our Protectionist period has given paramount
results. Banks, friendly societies, post offices, railways, telegraphs,
savings banks, depositors, deposits—all have received a life and vigour
under Protection, which they lacked under Freetrade.

4. In Manufactures we proved from the comparison of New
South Wales and Victoria, that the Protectionist colony, little as it is
territorially, has left every other colony far behind. We have de-
molished the falsity of the statistics based on mere factory returns, and
showed that manufacturing producers and production are both very
much greater in Victoria than in New South Wales.
5. Then came the question of Accumulation. The findings
of the Statists of the two colonies have been examined and compared.
The probate returns prove beyond doubt that the wealth bequeathed in
Victoria over a term of 12 years was far greater than that bequeathed
in New South Wales over the same term. The inference is Miat
Victorian citizens, in the matter of absolute possessions, have accimm-
lated much more wealth than have those of New South Wales.
6. We next checked the deductions from the probate returns by
the actual teachings of both Statists respecting the foreign investments
of the colonies, and it was shown that Victoria has been the only one
of the group which has been a large foreign investor.
7. From this we proceeded to investigate the comparative
indebtedness of the two colonies. By the admission of all parties the
interest-burden on New South Wales is beyond comparison greater
than that on Victoria.
I don’t think any ingenuous man who has followed the course
of these chapters can accuse me of any straining for effect. Life is
too short and truth too precious to make it worth while to juggle and
play tricks with the verities.
The great ethical truths which underlie Protection, and the vast
national interests which depend on the duo development of industry
as distinguished from trade, make me anxious that Victorian people
should thoroughly know what it is that has wrought Victorian
progress. There is nothing novel in what is here advanced. There
is no aiming at eloquence. The facts are a simple compilation from
the bluebooks. I believe them to be a candid statement, and to form
a perfectly unanswerable proof of the efficiency of a Protective policy.
And as they are clear to me I would they should be equally clear
to every one of my fellow colonists.
