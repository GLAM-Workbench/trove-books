The Editor desires to thank, most
sincerely, those women of Queensland
who, by their invaluable help, have
made this volume of records possible.
A little surprise may be felt at the
absence of several names in this issue,
but it must be explained that in some
cases the invitations had to be with-
drawn because of the expiration of the
time permitted for acceptance.
Despite this, however, it is felt that
our efforts have been well rewarded
by the splendid representation, within
these pages, of women and their activ-
ities.
Our success is, in great measure, due
to the Advisory Committee upon whom
rested the responsibility of nominating
those women who were eligible for
inclusion, and since the number of in-
vitations were limited we are confident
that their choice will meet with general
approval.
Every care has been taken in the
compilation of this record, but no re-
sponsibility is accepted for any errors
that may occur. Before going to press
each patron received a copy of her
details for correction but several failed
to return these within the time specified,
therefore any inaccuracies are not the
fault of the publishers.

FOREWORD
By His Excellency, the Governor of Queensland,
COLONEL RT. HON. SIR LESLIE ORME WILSON,
G.C.5.1., G.C.M.G., G.C.1.E., D.S.O.
This Biographical Record of Queensland Women is a
hook which is wanted. In nearly every other State in
Australia, the work of the women in philanthropic and
charitable spheres, is on record, and it is only right that,
here in Queensland, there should he a similar record. In
addition to such work, it is very necessary that the names
of those who have rendered pioneer service—and great
service in their lives—should he remembered for all time.
There are those also, whose names are well known in
sport, in the professions, and in National, Public, and Social
Service, who have done valuable work.
It has always been my complaint that we are leaving
too little on record for future generations. We have been
forgetful in handing on to posterity the work of those in
the past, who laid the foundations of the State—and this
applies to both men and women. This Biography will, at
any rate, give to the future a reminder, for all time , of
women who have done much in our generation by service
in many ways, and will also be a reminder to generations to
come and afford information to many to-day, of the great
part which women are playing in the development and
progress of a young State.

MRS. M. SHANNON (Margaret) (deceased).
Born at Umbercollie Station (then known as Yambacollie) on the Mclntyre River, New South
Wales; daughter of Mr. Jonathan Young, a pioneer squatter who "blazed the trail" in the far
south-west of Queensland, and of Mrs. Margaret Young (nee Fitzgerald). Married John
Shannon, Grazier, of Salt Bush Park, McKay, North Queensland, and of Wyalla, Toowoomba.
Pioneer family.
Family, eight sons and four daughters; Jonathan, Rowland, Elvyn, John, Cyril, Val, Alan,
Eric (deceased), Mabel (Mrs. Norman Mclntyre), Olive (Mrs. J, C. Richardson), Jane and
Ruby (Mrs. T. Macleod, deceased).
ACTIVITIES: Mrs. Shannon came to Queensland as a young bride from New South Wales,
first making her home near Rockhampton. After some years there Mr. and Mrs. Shannon
went to Lilyvale on Crinun Creek, and finally at Salt Bush Park, St. Lawrence, Queensland,
where the family home was permanently established. This property is now owned by her
youngest surviving son, Mr. Alan Shannon.
Mrs. Shannon was one of the originators and first Committee members of the Bush Nursing
Association. Her many various trying experiences in rendering first aid and nearly all her
children being born in the bush at great distances from a doctor with only an untrained
mid-wife in attendance taught her the great necessity for such an Association.
She was a life member of, and keen worker of the "Mothers' Union," Queensland Ambulance
and Benevolent Societies.
St. Margaret's Church of England, Nebo (the nearest township to Salt Bush Park) has been
erected to her memory by her children, and the people of the district.
Mrs. Shannon, who died in 1916, was the first white child born in the Goondiwindi district
(then New South Wales) in 1847.
The last few years of her life were spent at "Wyalla," Toowoomba, which is still owned by the
family.

MRS. M. YOUNG (Margaret Fitzgerald Chapman)
(deceased).
Buttervant, Ireland, in 1815. Married, 1836, Jonathan Young, a pioneer squatter
of New South Wales, and later of South-west Queensland.
Family, two sons and five daughters (all now deceased).
'Left an orphan at an early age, Mrs. Young came to New South Wales while still in her
teens with an Uncle fßev. Richard Fitzgerald) and his wife. After her marriage Mrs
Young accompanied her husband on horse-back from Maitland to "Pulliman" station on
the Namoi River, a ride of hundreds of miles over bush tracks menaced by natives 'and
snakes. It was af Pulliman station that four of her children were born and where also,
two of her sons died without receiving medical attention because of the families isolation
from help. Some years later Mr. and Mrs. Young and their two daughters journeyed further
north where, on the Mclntyre River they stocked a holding which Mr. Young named
Yambacollie (now known as Umbercollie). Their third daughter, Margaret (afterwards Mrs
John Shannon) was the first white child to be born in this district. In 1869 Mr. and
Mrs. Young sold the station and returned to the Hunter River where they bought an estate
near Maitland and retired. Mrs. Young died in 1902 at the age of 88 and retained all her
faculties to the last, particularly her Irish wit.
The Altar in the old Holy Trinity Church, Goondiwindi, beautifully carved by a grand-
daughter, Ruby Margaret Shannon, was erected to the memory of Jonathan and Margaret
Young and their daughters. This Altar has now been placed in the side chapel of the fine
new edifice lately dedicated.
Part of the inscription on the old Altar reads: "The above were Pioneer Settlers of the
Goondiwindi District, Mrs. Young and her daughters being the first white women on the
Mclntyre in 1845. Mr. Young built the first Church of England House of Prayer in the
district ..."
