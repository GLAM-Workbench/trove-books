FOREWORD.
The publication of this pamphlet by Mr. Butcher, Biologist of this
Department, is a happy augury for the future development of the science
of fish culture and conservation in this State.
Not only is this so, because of the valuable qualities of the publication
itself, but because it is an indication of the practical and progressive
policy which the Government of Victoria is undertaking for the improvement
of our freshwater fisheries.
Over a long period, the Victorian trout fishermen have contributed
funds for the improvement of our inland fisheries resources.
The Dunstan Government, in return for such contributions, approved
an ambitious programme of development of inland waters by inaugurating
a new system of fish hatcheries, the scope and potentialities of which mark
a revolutionary stage in fish culture in Australia.
Apart from the encouragement and financing of research into the
breeding habits of native fish, the immediate object is to increase the
output of State-maintained hatcheries to 1,000,000 Brown and Rainbow
trout yearlings per annum.
This quota in addition to providing unsurpassed sporting facilities for
Victorian fishermen and an attraction to visiting anglers, will relieve the
drain on our native fishes until such time as science has made it possible,
by artificial hatching methods, to breed them in quantities adequate for
re-stocking requirements.
Mr. Butcher’s work, therefore, has a significance beyond the description
given on the title page. It is a practical, scientific analysis of some of the
problems to be faced in the carrying out of the Government’s project—a
project which deserves the ardent support of every citizen desirous of the
future well-being and progress of his State.
F. LEWIS,
Chief Inspector of Fisheries.

The Food of Indigenous and Non-indigenous Freshwater
Fish in Victoria, with Special Reference to Trout.
A. Dunbavin Butcher, M.Sc.
Biologist, Fisheries and Game Department, Victoria.
1. INTRODUCTION.
This work was initiated by the Victorian Fresh Water Research
Committee and was later carried on by the Fisheries and Game Department.
A certain amount of work has been carried out in Australasia on this
subject; in Tasmania by Evans (1937, 1938-39, 1942); in New South
Wales by McKeown (1934, 1934 a, 1934 b, 1936, 1937) ; and by Phillips
(1929, 1939) in New Zealand. There is also a considerable literature on
the subject in overseas publications but this is the first investigation to
be carried out in Victoria.
A study of the food of fish has been sufficient apparently in itself to
justify the publication of numerous papers; an even greater literature
dealing with wider problems of freshwater fisheries includes references to
this subject. It must be realized at the outset that although this study
of food organisms is only part of a major survey it, in itself, does contribute
substantially to a fauna survey. Some attempt is to be made to correlate
growth with food and other factors affecting the growth of fish are to be
discussed briefly. This work forms portion of a study to determine the
factors on which a sound and economic stocking policy is to be based.
The food of several species of fish is to be discussed ; the indigenous fish
include the Macquarie perch ( Macquaria australasica), the blackfish
(Gadopsis marmomtus) and the galaxias ( Galaxias attenuatus) ; the three
species of non-indigenous fish are the brown trout ( Salmo fario), the
rainbow trout {Salmo irideus ) and the English perch ( Perea fluviatilis).
This p?,per is concerned particularly with the two species of trout and
more specifically with the brown trout.
I wish to stress at this stage the qualitative rather than the quantitative
aspect of this stomach content analysis investigation. The difficulties
associated with a quantitative survey are to be discussed later but apart
from these difficulties a quantitative survey can only assume its full value
when carried out in conjunction with a quantitative survey of the fauna
of the streams from which the fish being examined were taken. The
waters in this instance are widely scattered and without a large field staff
it would not be possible to carry out such a survey in the streams.
The reasons for, and the value of, carrying out an investigation of the
type to be described in this paper are numerous. A sound stocking
policy is the most important principle which has to be formulated in an
acclimatization programme or in a programme aimed at the development
of a native fish. This line of thought is of fairly recent origin ; generally
speaking acclimatization in the past has been a somewhat haphazard
business. As a result of the indiscriminate stocking of various waters it
gradually became obvious that there were marked differences in the
productivity of these different waters. Among the many factors determining
the productivity of a given water the quantity and type of available fish
food stands out as the major factor. This has led to many surveys of the
food organisms taken by fish and of the fauna of streams and lakes.


A term, perhaps with a wider significance than stocking policy, has come
into general usage in the United States of America in recent years, this
is fish management programme This expression applies to all species
ol fish, both indigenous and non-indigenous. One of the first considerations
in game fish husbandry is a definite knowledge of the natural foods
constituting the diet of the game fish to be managed—(Dimick and Mote,
1934). Mottram (1928) states that “the reason for considering the
natural tood of trout is in order to suggest methods for its preservation
and increase”. Needham (1934), Tillyard (1934), McKeown (1934), Salmon
and Freshwater Fisheries Commissioners (Tasmania) (1936) and Surber
(1940) all express views similar to those quoted above.
As has been mentioned already, the examination of the stomach
contents of fish does assist in the carrying out of fauna surveys. Several
of the streams which supplied fish stomach material for this investigation
have been subjected at most to a cursary survey but these stomach
contents have thrown some light on, at least, three invertebrate groups
in these waters, namely Crustacea , Mollusca and Coleoptera. Needham
and Vestal (1938), McKeown (1937), and Needham and Rayner (1939) all
stress the value of results of the examination of the stomach contents of
fish in assisting in surveys of the food in streams and lakes. According
to Rayner (1937) the fauna of a water as well as the food of trout
inhabiting those waters may be well known by an examination of the
stomach contents of the trout. In a survey carried out by Moffett (1942)
regular apparatus could not be used owing to certain difficult conditions
and the examination of trout stomachs assisted the survey. Griffiths and
Yeomen (?) go further and according to these workers the analysis
of food found in the stomachs of fish is believed to be a better index of
available food than bottom samples, (although it must be noted that
they refer to available foods ; this question will be discussed in detail at
a later stage), but bottom samples offer a more convenient means of
comparing relative productivity of the lakes being examined.
A further matter on which an investigation of this type may throw
considerable light is one of great ecological interest, that is, the effect of
the introduction of an exotic species into our streams. This refers to the
two species of trout, brown and rainbow. This is a question which will
attain an even greater significance in the future as at present plans are
being formulated to greatly increase acclimatization activities in this
State. The question of competition for food between indigenous and
non-indigenous fish will be discussed later in this paper but it is obvious
that not only the fact of food competition is involved. Both McKeown
(1934 a) and Percival (1932) raise this question of the possible effect of the
introduction of exotic species but beyond stating that some influence on
the native fauna is to be expected they do not elaborate on this theme.
2. MATERIAL.
All the material available for examination was supplied by anglers and for
this reason no specimens were obtained over the winter months as the
fishing was carried out in the open season. The closed season for
trout in Victoria extends from the first of May to the thirty-first of August.
Two other closures also affect anglers and these are one for Murray cod
and Macquarie perch, &c., over the period first of September to the
thirtieth of November, and the other for blackfish which extends from


the first of May to the fifteenth of December. These close seasons may
overlap to a certain degree as the closure operating on any one water is
based on the dominant fish species in that water. Thus certain portions
of the Goulburn Eiver (a stream to be discussed in this paper) are closed
until the thirtieth of November because although trout are present in
these waters the Murray fish are the dominant species.
The fact that material is lacking for the winter months is perhaps not
as great an omission as may appear at first sight; the aquatic and
terrestial invertebrate fauna is less in evidence during the winter months
and thus less food is available over this period. Trout show little growth
over the winter months and it may be assumed that normally little food
is taken during this period. This abstention is due, at least partly, to the
relative absence of food rather than to choice ; fish reared in a hatchery
will feed readily throughout the year. The food taken by trout during
the remaining eight months of the year in any one river system will give
a fairly accurate picture of the food available and the feeding habits of
fish in that system.
War-time conditions have placed another limitation on the quantity
of s material available ; fewer people are fishing and those in the position
to fish have not been able to fish as frequently as they would at normal
times. The work described in this paper has been carried out also as a
spare time activity by myself.
The question of regurgitation of portion of their stomach contents by
fish has been raised by Phillips (1929) and commented on by Pentelow
(1932). If this habit was widespread and of common occurrence it
would have to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of the
examination of the stomach contents of fish as a method of studying
their feeding habits. From my own experience in netting estuarine
fish I have found that fish sometimes regurgitate portion of their stomach
contents but that this only occurs when the fish have been feeding
heavily and then only the most recently ingested food is voided. To
obtain further evidence on this question I contacted several fly-fishermen
and also the governing body of anglers in Victoria. The general opinion
expressed was that trout regurgitate the stomach contents only rarely
and then only when the fish have been feeding heavily. On the other
hand, Murray cod frequently do so.
Pentelow (1932) discusses the possible selection of material when fish
are taken on dry flies, that is, the fish are attracted to the surface to feed
and therefore the catches are weighted by an excess of surface feeding
while bottom feeders are not sufficiently represented. This question
does not arise in the case of the material under review; the stomachs
were taken from fish caught on many types of flies, on bait, and by
spinners. The method of catching was recorded in almost every case of
the stomachs examined in this survey.
3. METHODS.
One of the earliest questions which had to be settled in this investigation
was the system to be adopted in setting out the results of the analyses of
the stomach contents. That is, whether the stomach contents were to
be expressed as a count of the various organisms or according to bulk or
weight. In the majority of the references listed in which the stomach


contents of fish are dealt with, these are given as an actual count, usually
in terms of per centages, that is, of the total number of food organisms
eaten. The reason frequently advanced in support of using a count is
that this method does show the food preference of a fish or the selectivity
of the fish, for example, Needham (1938). Later in this paper I intend
to demonstrate that little or no food preference is exhibited by trout.
The alternative is to express the stomach contents either as volume or
weight. Volume and weight are unsatisfactory as they do not adequately
represent the proportions of the food taken since one large organism such
as a fish or a crayfish will, in bulk or weight, be quite disproportionate to
a considerable number of smaller forms such as the various groups of
insects. Furthermore, weight and bulk are unsatisfactory in that many
food organisms can be positively identified from fragments only which
are found among the stomach contents. Phillips (1929) discusses this
problem somewhat along these lines.
Despite the defects of the count in tabulating food proportions I have
adopted this system in setting out the results of the examination of the
stomach contents of fish.
A factor, which has been obvious throughout this work, and which
has to be considered whichever method of expressing the results of the
analyses is adopted, is that some forms are so rapidly digested that the
results of the analyses must be on the low side. This is recognized by
McKeown (1934), Phillips (1929), and Hess and Rainwater (1939).
The latter authors have made an attempt experimentally to formulate a
value which will allow for this differential rate of digestion of various
organisms. If all organisms eaten by fish were digested at the same
rate examination of the stomach contents would yield directly a measure
of the numbers eaten. But this is not so and Hess and Rainwater
demonstrated it experimentally by feeding various organisms to fish
under controlled temperature conditions. The fish were killed at intervals
and the stomach contents examined. They suggest that the following
method should be adopted in evaluating the stomach contents of fish :—-
“ Using a constant temperature and hourly samples of 20 fish each,
let the relative values given to each kind of organism be the reciprocal of
the time in hours required for 50 per cent, (this point is chosen to
eliminate the extremes at each end) of the stomachs to become emptied
of that organism. The ratio of these values multiplied by the actual
number of organisms found in the stomach of the fish will give the
relative numbers eaten ”. They suggest further that a soft-bodied,
easily digested form might be taken as a standard type and the rate of
digestion for all other forms measured in comparison with this standard
type. The standardized values thus obtained might be termed
“ evaluation factors ”.
While this work is a valuable contribution it is impossible to apply it
from the practical viewpoint. An examination of the Tables given below
in this paper will indicate the large range of organisms involved and then
the question of temperature has to be considered. Considerable fluctuations
in temperature occur in the different sections of any one water and the
difficulties associated with this factor appear to •be insuperable.


In many instances little attempt has been made to take identification
of the food organisms beyond Families or beyond Orders except in the
case of Crustacea, aquatic Coleoptera, and Mollusca because—
(a) In many cases it is impossible to identify the larvae of aquatic
forms as their life histories have not been worked out; this
applies to Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Diptera, Perlaria, dtc.
Work on these groups in this country has been negligible.
( b ) Fragments of food organisms found in fish stomachs although
they cannot be identified as to species, can in many cases
be placed at least in their respective Orders and frequently
into Families. The head capsules of trichopterous larvae,
the chitinized thoracic segments of the larvae of Perlaria
and Ephemeroptera, the head capsules and thoracic segments
of Hymenoptera, the heavily chitinized fragments of Coleoptera,
&c., are quickly identifiable.
(c) Terrestial insects and other terrestial forms, although constituting
an important item of diet of freshwater fish in certain
seasons and in certain localities, must however be regarded as
incidental to the normal diet or at best supplementary and it is
felt that no particular purpose would be served in fully
identifying the bulk of these forms.
Many other workers have admitted to limitation of identification for the
reasons outlined in (a) and ( b ) above—Pentelow (1932), Phillips (1929), &c.
Early in the investigation it was obvious that some definition had to be
given for the term “ aquatic ” forms ; this definition must be somewhat
arbitary.
Rayner (1937) and Needham (1938) in discussing the food of trout
have taken the somewhat rigid view that the adults of aquatic larvae such
as the Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, some families of the Coleoptera, &c.,
must be regarded as terrestial insects once they leave the water. Phillips
(1929) does not separate stomach contents into aquatic and terrestial
forms but in discussing the Coleoptera he classifies them under three
headings—
(а) Completely aquatic in all stages;
(б) With aquatic larvae, the adults generally living on the waters
edge ;
(c) Land beetles which live on the vegetation near streams and
which may fall into the water.
Dimick and Mote (1934) accept a wider definition in that “ Aquatic
insects are those which live at least for the major part of their lives in fresh
water ”. Thus there is some difference of opinion on the definition of
aquatic insects and other organisms. Insofar as my work on the food
of fish is concerned I have taken a view that will perhaps be regarded as
somewhat broad. At one end of the scale are groups such as the
Sphaeromidae, Gammaridae, Attyidae in the Crustacea, the Mollusca, &c..
which do not leave the water voluntarily at any stage in their life history!
It is in the dominant group in the food of freshwater fish, the Insecia,
that the greatest difficulty arises. I have adopted a definition somewhat
along the lines of that of Dimick and Mote quoted above, that is, anv
insects the larval stage of which is passed in freshwater I have classified as
“ aquatic ”. One of the general characteristics of all insects is the greater
7792/45.-2


length of the larval stage as compared with the adult phase. Adults of
groups such as the Corixidae {Hemiptera), Gyrinidae, Hydrophilidae
(Coleoptera ) which are generally regarded as being aquatic are frequently
found on “ dry land The Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Perlaria, and
Odonata are also regarded as typical aquatic groups ; the larvae (nymphs),
pupae, sub-imagos, or whatever name by which the phases leading up to
the imago are known, are undisputably regarded as being aquatic. The
adults are non-aquatic in as far as their environment is concerned
although in several of these groups they may never leave the neighbourhood
of freshwater bodies. In all cases they return to the stream, lake or
pool to deposit their eggs, either at the water surface or below it. I have
classified all stages in the life history of these forms as aquatic. Between the
many groups of insects passing some phase of their life history in freshwater
there is a gradation of the period spent in the water or in close association
with the water. However, these have all been regarded as aquatic.
Many insects and other organisms in the diet of the freshwater fish can
in no way be regarded as aquatic and there has been no hesitation in
classing these as terrestial forms. For example, many families of
Coleoptera such as Scarabaeidae, Chrysomelidae, Carabidae are commonly
found in the stomachs of freshwater fish ; Hymenoptera may be represented
by Formicidae and Hemiptera by Cercopidae and Membracidae, &c. ;
Isoptera are very commonly found in trout as also are Acriidae.
4. DISCUSSION.
(a) Food of the Different Species of Freshwater Fish.
A knowledge of the food of the different species of freshwater fish is a
matter of considerable importance ; it is of greater significance than a
similar study on the diet of marine fish. The extreme range of
environmental conditions with its accompanying differences in fauna,
both from the qualitative and quantitative aspects, found in freshwater
is, generally speaking, absent in the large bodies of sea water. It is not
uncommon to find very different conditions in two freshwater systems
separated by only a few miles whereas in the case of the oceans, except in
the regions of impact of two current systems, such sharply defined
variations are not usual. This question will be discussed more fully in
the discussion on food and growth.
Returning to the necessity for a survey of the food of freshwater fish—
(а) If the propagation and development of indigenous fish is
contemplated it is essential that information on the food
requirements of the species in question be available.
(б) In the acclimatization of non-indigenous fish, a matter which
is to receive considerable impetus in this State in the near
future, further questions arise :
(i) Will the food competition which will possibly develop
following the introduction of non-indigenous fish
act to the detriment of the indigenous fish ? This
is the most common question met with from people
interested in inland fisheries and is one which only
a long term investigation can answer.
(ii) The stocking policy will be based largely on a
knowledge of the food requirements of the fish in
association with surveys of the actual food supplies
available.

• T his dis cussion will centre largely around two non-indigenous species
rainbow and brown trout, and then on food competition
and other species. The second matter will be dealt with but tv,
collectmn of more data will be necessary before it can be answered in f u ]T
For example, the introduction of trout is blamed by many for the
rapid disappearance of the native blackfish. This accusation cannot yet
e supported or refuted on the basis of available data but there are Sit
ast two other very significant factors which are known to be operating
These are the disappearance of marginal brush cover and submersed
timber in blackfish waters and the rapid siltation of many streams both
of which have followed on settlement. ’
diff Th V rOU J ma , fcerial to J? 6 discussed here was collected in several very
different waters but at this stage all the brown trout stomachs wih he
1° all the rainboW stmnachs
(see fable 2.). Trout throughout the greater part of the world where
they occur or have been established eat much the same type of food
organisms although the proportion of each group of food organisms does
lary considerably in different countries. The food taken by the two
trout species in Victorian waters differs. Trichoptera constitute the
dominant food for both species, being 42 per cent, and 30 per cent hy
number of the food organisms taken by brown and rainbow trout
respectively. In the brown trout the following groups appear fo
greasing order of importance; Coleoptera, Hemiplra, zndDiptera.
File m the rainbow trout, again in order of decreasing importance the
following groups appear; Diptera, Ephemeroptera, and Hemiptera. ’

Under Kenyan (East Africa) conditions Copley (1940) found that the
food of the rainbow and the brown differed considerably. He found that
the rainbow was typically a crab eater while the brown was not, although
crabs were available to the brown. Also that the brown stomachs
contained more underwater and terrestial insects than the rainbow.
Rayner (1937) working in California, states that the stomach contents of
rainbow, brown, and brook ( Salvelinus fontinalis) trout show no marked
difference in diet, at least no more than that exhibited by individuals of
the same species. Needham (1938) also working in America, found that
the feeding habits of brown trout differ in some respects from those of
the rainbow trout while the rainbow trout more closely resemble brook
trout than brown trout in their selection of foods. Furthermore, they
show several dietary characteristics not shown by the other two species
of trout. Bush (1933) in discussing rainbow and brown trout in Natal
waters states that they eat almost any animal of suitable size that is
available.
In Victoria I have found some marked differences between the diet of
the two species and I hope to develop this in the following discussion.
The dominant food group for both trout species, as has already been
stated, is the Trichoptera or caddis-flies. These constitute 42 per cent,
and 30 per cent, by number in the diet of the rainbow and brown
respectively. The next most important food group for the rainbow is
the Diptera or true flies (20 per cent.); this group take fourth place in
the brown trout diet (9 per cent.). The Ephemeroptera (may-flies)
constitute another important group for the rainbows (16 per cent.) while
they represent only 3.5 per cent, of the food organisms taken by the brown
trout. Hemiptera are well represented in the diet of both species, 11 per
cent, for brown trout and 10 per cent, for rainbow trout. Coleoptera
(beetles) form 13 per cent, of the diet of brown trout and 4 per cent, for
rainbows. Mollusca have not been found in rainbow trout but represent
4 per cent, of the food organisms taken by brown trout. The four most

important groups in the diet of rainbows mentioned above constitute
89 per cent, of the total food organisms which are found in the stomachs
of this species. Eight groups of organisms ( Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera,
Diptera, Crustacea, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Mollusca)
make up 85 per cent, of the diet of brown trout. The remaining 11 per
cent, of the diet of rainbow trout consisted of organisms from eleven
other groups while fifteen other classes of food organisms contributed
15 per cent, by number of the organisms found in the stomachs of brown
trout. Brown trout take a much greater variety of food in their diet
than do the rainbows. Apart from this, the most striking differences in
the diet of the two species are found in five invertebrate groups.
Ephemeroptera which are important in the diet of rainbows occupy a very
much less significant position in the dietary of the browns; Crustacea
are almost absent from the diet of the rainbows ; Mollusca have not been
found in the stomachs of rainbows. The remaining two groups, Hymenoptera
and Coleoptera, will be dealt with a little further on in a discussion on
terrestial and aquatic organisms found constituting the diet of trout.
Phillips (1929) working in New Zealand, has found that Trichoptera
constitute up to 80 per cent, of the diet of brown trout in that country.
He states that this figure is probably somewhat high due to the fact that
the caddis larval cases are not digested to the same degree as other
organisms but there is no doubt that they constitute the principal food.
Percival (1932) quoting other New Zealand authors, states that Trichoptera
may constitute 31 to 100 per cent, of the diet of brown trout. One of
these investigators supplies the following figures:— Trichoptera 77 per
cent., Ephemeroptera 9.5 per cent., Coleoptera 10.8 per cent. The
remaining 3 per cent, of the diet was made up of fish, Crustacea and
Mollusca.
Needham (1938) discussing the diet of rainbow and brown trout in
the United States of America, supplies the following figures :
This presents a very different picture from the position in Victoria
in so far as the constituents of the diet are concerned but again stresses
the differences in the food taken by the two species. Discussing rainbow
trout in California, Needham (1934) states that Trichoptera constitute over
50 per cent, of the diet and Diptera 30 per cent. According to Tillyard
(1936) the principal sources of trout (rainbow and brown) food in Tasmania
in descending order of importance are Trichoptera, Crustacea, Odonata,
Perlaria, and adventitious insects such as Coleoptera and Acriidae.
McKeown (1936) makes a comparison of the average number of insects of
each order taken by rainbow and brown trout in New South Wales and
for Trichoptera these are 87.59 and 12.56 respectively. He states that
from an examination of material over the period 1931-35 Trichoptera are
the only important aquatic food.


This is a very brief survey of the literature dealing with this question.
lB ver 7 difficult to make any direct comparison of the diet of trout in
different areas and different countries as the available food depends largely
On the type of stream or body of water in which the trout are taken and
more often than not these details are lacking. Nevertheless the bulk of
the literature does make a comparison possible as in the aggregate a
sufficient number of stream types are investigated to smooth out the
existing differences.
It is obvious that the Trichoptera constitute the most important item
of diet of trout of both species whatever are the relative positions of the
other groups of organisms in the food of trout in different countries.
A striking feature of the diet of both species of trout, but particularly
of the brown trout, in Victoria, as compared with the food of trout as
shown by the surveys of other workers, is the large range of organisms
contributing to the diet. Generally this would be regarded as indicative
of an unsatisfactory state of affairs, that is, it would suggest that the
fish have to cover a considerable field and to be very active in their efforts
to obtain a sufficient quantity of food to cover their minimum requirements.
That this is not the case is demonstrated by the high productivity and
carrying capacity of many of our lakes and streams and also the excellent
growth rate attained by both species of trout which compares more than
favourably with other areas ; see discussion later in this paper and also
Parrott (1932, ?a, ?b) (New Zealand) and Malloch (1910) (Great Britain). &c.
Another significant and consistent difference between the diet of the
two species is the ratio of aquatic to terrestial food organisms. Thirty-
three per cent, of the food (by number) taken by brown trout consists of
terrestial forms, that is, terrestial forms make an important contribution
to the food of brown trout. On the other hand, only 8 per cent, of the
food organisms of rainbow trout are terrestial in origin. The definitions
°f. <£ aquatic ” and “ terrestial ” given earlier must be borne in mind at
this stage. Five insect orders make up the majority of the terrestial
forms taken by brown trout and of these the Coleoptera and Hymenoptera
must be regarded as important. Weather conditions affect the quantity
of terrestial insects falling on to the surface of the water and this applies
to the five orders in question. Many of our streams and lakes are situated
m bush country and have a marginal flora ranging from scrub to forest.
This is the source of large numbers of Coleoptera (beetles) and Hymenoptera
(ants, wasps, &c.) and these two groups are available over the greater part
of the year. These two orders in particular must be regarded as a
consistent supply of food for brown trout. This also applies, although
to a lesser degree, to the terrestial Hemiptera. Isoptera (termites) are
blown on to the water surface during the nuptial flight and although
quite frequently found in trout stomachs they cannot be regarded as an
important food supply. The Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) are
even less important; a certain number of larvae drop on to the water
from over-hanging trees and occasionally one species of Noctuidae, the
Bogong moth, attains plague proportions and trout may gorge on the
adults, but neither lepidopterous larvae nor Bogong moths can be
considered significant as trout food.
No one group of terrestial insects contributes a large proportion of the
8 per cent, of terrestial organisms found in the stomachs of rainbow trout.


From this brief discussion it would appear that the brown trout feeds
at the water surface more than does the rainbow trout. The same
forms of terrestial insects are available to both species of trout and yet
the quantity of terrestial insects eaten by rainbow trout is considerably
less than that taken by brown trout. Furthermore, the three dominant
groups in the food of the rainbow trout are taken in the lower depths, if
not on the bed, of the stream or lake.
Terrestial foods, on the basis of my own definition, may be grouped
roughly in three classes :
(1) Swarming insects such as Acridiidae (grasshoppers), Isoptera
(termites) and Formicidae (ants).
(2) Terrestial forms blown in by strong winds or which fall from
overhanging vegetation; Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera,
&c.
(3) Terrestial forms swept in by heavy rains ; earth worms ; ground
inhabiting forms of coleopterous larvae, for example,
Scarabaeidae; Crustacea such as wood lice, &c.
The importance of terrestial organisms in the diet of trout varies
considerably in dilferent countries. In the three Australian States
(Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania) which have developed
acclimatization to any degree terrestial food is of considerable importance
and this applies particularly to the two mainland States. McKeown
(1934) in a general discussion on trout in New South Wales states that
the surface of the water is a prolific source of food for trout; many insects
fall in or are blown into the streams. In a further paper (1934 a) he
states that an examination of the stomach contents of trout from several
localities indicates that by far the .greater proportion of the insects are
terrestial species. He later (1934 b) discusses an opinion freely expressed
in some quarters that the brown trout feeds more upon the surface than
the rainbow and comes to the conclusion that an examination of the
available data does not support this contention. In the Victorian study
it is apparent that the brown trout does feed more on the surface than
the rainbow trout. In Tasmania (Evans, 1942) terrestial insects form
an important source of food. According to Phillips (1929) and Percival
(1932), although terrestial insects appear to be of some value as trout
food in the summer months in New Zealand they are not, as a whole, an
important factor. The position appears to be similar in England and
according to Pentelow (1932) there is no likelihood that terrestial insects
are an important source of trout food. Dimick and Mote (1934), Needham
(1937, 1938), and Davis (1938) all express the opinion that, in the United
States, the terrestial forms, referred to as drift food, are generally
accepted to be of considerable importance. Needham states that the
examination of stomach contents for these forms is used to make a
rough estimate of the amount of food available from this source in
formulating a stocking policy. This fact must be borne in mind when
the acclimatization of trout is being developed in this State. These
opinions quoted above refer to trout generally, that is, no reference is
made to any one restricted area. Needham (1942) in a survey of one
water found that 33 per cent, of the food of trout examined consisted of
terrestial insects ; this is a figure similar to that found for brown trout in
this State. In another survey of a restricted area (Needham and Vestal,
1938) two groups of aquatic insects constituted 96 per cent, of the total


food taken by trout. In a further survey dealing with rainbow trout in
a single water system Needham (1934) states that 87 per cent, of the food
taken was aquatic in origin which corresponds closely to the figure for
Victoria (92 per cent.) which refers to fish taken from a number of sources.
Generally, the position, both in New South Wales and the United States,
corresponds very closely to that found in Victoria.
In Victoria it has been our experience that it is inadvisable to stock a
water with both rainbow and brown trout as after a period the brown
trout dominate the rainbow trout. For this reason particular care has
been taken in recent years to stock any one water with one trout species
only. The present investigation has not thrown much light on the
matter but a recent publication (Needham and Slater, 1944) discusses a
similar position in United States of America. The paper deals with an
experiment conducted to determine the survival of hatchery-reared brown
and rainbow trout as affected by wild trout populations. One conclusion
was that the survival of the large rainbow trout is similar to that of small
brown trout and thus a greater hardihood is indicated for the brown trout
although the reason is not obvious. The authors quote the case of a
stream system in which brown trout predominate despite repeated
plantings of rainbow trout but they state further that this condition may
be the result of intensive angling as well as other factors as it is well known
that rainbow populations can be depleted by intensive angling. But in the
experiment described angling was not a factor and the writers suggest
that the explanation lies in a greater inherent ability of brown trout to
meet competition either among themselves or from other species of trout.
They state further that the difference in origins of the brown (European)
and rainbow (native) stocks does not appear to be a determining factor.
Under Victorian conditions we are dealing with two introduced species.
In Kenya (Copley, 1940 a) the reverse condition appears to be the case
and of the several explanations advanced one in particular appears to be
significant. Comparatively high temperatures averaging from 60° to 82°
Fahrenheit are typical of the downstream stretches in the area under
discussion and Copley claims that the rainbow trout show a far greater
adaptability to warm water than do the brown trout. Copley states
also that under Kenyan conditions many rainbow trout spawn twice a
year regularly and this fact is another reason for the rainbow trout
dominating the brown trout.
Before leaving this question of competition between rainbow and
brown trout the position in Victoria in reference to the differences between
the feeding of the two species may be summarized, on the basis of the
data available to date, as follows :
(1) There is a marked difference in the percentage of the various
groups taken as food, viz., Ephemeroptera and Diptera are
important in the .diet of rainbow trout but not in the diet of
brown trout; Mollusca and Crustacea whilst found in the
stomachs of brown trout were entirely absent in the case of
Mollusca and almost absent in the case of Crustacea in
rainbow trout. Parts at least of the organisms in the latter
two food groups resist digestion in the alimentary canal of
fish and if taken would certainly be found.

(2) There is a marked difference in the proportion of aquatic to
terrestial food taken by the two species; 67 per cent,
aquatic and 33 per cent, terrestial in brown trout and 92 per
cent, aquatic and 8 per cent, terrestial in rainbow trout.
(3) Brown trout feed more extensively at the surface than do
rainbow trout.
(4) The brown trout is considerably more catholic in its dietary
than is the rainbow trout. A greater number of groups of
food organisms is found consistently in brown trout and
also a greater number of miscellaneous forms.
The broader question of the competition between trout and other fish
species must be dealt with now. Referring first to Tables Ito 6: The
most significant fact is the importance of Trichoptera in the diet of
Macquarie perch, blackfish, rainbow trout, brown trout, and English
perch ; it is the dominant item except in the case of the two perch species.
In the blackfish it is the most important item of diet constituting almost
66 per cent, of the food organisms taken. The English perch takes only
one other important group of food organisms and these belong to the
Crustacea and consist mainly of the larger forms—the freshwater crayfish
or yabbies. Trichoptera and Crustacea together make up 86 per cent, of
the diet of English perch and no other group is represented in any number.
Diptera form the major item of diet in the native Macquarie perch (54
per cent.) and together with the Trichoptera constitute 78 per cent, of the
organisms taken. Diptera are also of some importance in the diet of
both trout species and particularly of the rainbow trout. The blackfish
is the only species, apart from trout, taking appreciable numbers of
Coleoptera. The outstanding feature, on the basis of this comparison, is the
more limited range of food organisms taken by the three non-trout species ;
Diptera and Trichoptera in Macquarie perch, Trichoptera and Coleoptera
in blackfish, and Crustacea and Trichoptera in English perch. In each
case the former group is the most important.

A further basis of comparison is the proportion of aquatic to terrestial
food taken by each fish species. The Macquarie perch is the most dependent
on aquatic food, this constituting almost 99 per cent, of its diet. Sixteen
per cent, of the food of blackfish is of terrestial origin and 3 per cent, of
the English perch diet is terrestial.
Taking into consideration diet alone the English perch competes least
with the other four species. The dominant food of this species consists
of Crustacea, particularly the larger forms such as freshwater crayfish,
although Trichoptera constitute nearly one-quarter of the food organisms
taken. These two groups have parts which resist digestion and perhaps
the percentages are weighted for this reason but there is no doubt that
these are the two most important groups. However, against this
comparative absence of competition for available food supplies by this
species with the two indigenous fish (blackfish and Macquarie perch) and
also with the two non-indigenous trout species, is the very severe
competition for food which must arise under certain conditions which
favour the successful reproduction of the English perch. In some

localities English perch may be found together with the other fish species
under discussion, without any apparent detrimental effects, but, generally
speaking, under Victorian conditions, English perch are harmful in
waters which successfully carry any of the other four species.
Food competition between the two indigenous fish, blackfish and
Macquarie perch, and the two trout species is more difficult to determine.
McKeown (1934 a), working in New South Wales, states that the feeding
habits of the Macquarie perch are very similar to those of trout. The
diets of the four species have been discussed already. Trichoptera are
important to all species and the two trout species must compete with
Macquarie perch and blackfish, but particularly the latter, for these
insects (principally larval forms). Diptera are significant in the diet of
both trout species and form the dominant food item for Macquarie perch.
Thus it will be seen that trout compete with Macquarie perch for the two
most important food groups in the diet of the latter species. The
Macquarie perch is a Murray fish, that is, it inhabits the waters of the
River Murray system and in Victoria these waters are all north of the
Great Dividing Range. In recent years several attempts to acclimatize
Macquarie perch in southern streams have been very successful and it is
proposed to extend this development. In that case the competition
from the trout will have to be borne in mind.
Ephemeroptera form the third most important food group in both
Macquarie perch and rainbow trout and further competition may be
anticipated in this direction. Yet, if rainbow trout are placed in the
waters most suitable for their development this problem need not arise.
Blackfish meet with competition from both trout species ; Trichoptera
are important to all three species but particularly to the blackfish.
Coleoptera are the second most important food group for both brown trout
and blackfish.
The food of the different fish species is the subject under discussion in
this paper and whilst the effect of competition for food on the different
species is being considered, the fact that other factors, particularly
environmental conditions, may be as important, if not more important


in some cases, in the relations between different fish species inhabiting a
single water system, has not been overlooked. For example, the
introduction of trout to this State is blamed very frequently for the
disappearance of the blackfish from many streams. Direct competition
has doubtless played a very large part but even more significant are the
very great changes that have taken place in environmental conditions
following on deforestation and erosion, &c., and also overfishing (the
blackfish is most readily hooked) ; these factors have operated to the
detriment of the blackfish.
To summarize very briefly the possible competition between the
various fish species as is indicated by the data under review :
(1) The English perch may compete successfully against the other
species, indigenous and non-indigenous; particularly on the
grounds that it is capable as a species, under certain
conditions, of increasing very rapidly.
(2) The rainbow trout competes with the Macquarie perch for the
available food supplies, particularly for food organisms
belonging to the three insect orders of Trichoptera, Diptera,
and Ephemeroptera.
(3) The rainbow competes further with the blackfish, particularly
for trichopterous larvae which constitute the major part of
the diet of blackfish.
(4) The brown trout also competes with the native blackfish,
Trichoptera and Coleoptern being the two groups principally
concerned.
(5) The Macquarie perch takes very few terrestial food organisms
and for this reason will suffer less from the presence of brown
trout which, under Victorian conditions, subsists on a diet
consisting of a large proportion of terrestial organisms, than
it will from rainbow 7 trout which takes a much smaller
proportion of terrestial food.
(6) Following a similar reasoning, greater competition for terrestial
forms will take place between blackfish and brown trout
than will occur between blackfish and rainbow trout.
An examination of Table 7 throws further light on the question of
competition of food between the different fish species. In this table the
frequency, that is, the number of stomachs in which each particular group
of organisms is found, is set out and this is given also as a percentage of
the total number of stomachs in which each particular group of food organisms
occurs. This will not affect the conclusions drawn from the study of
Tables 1 to 5. For reasons already outlined, the results of the analyses
of the stomach contents for Trichoptera (particularly the larval forms),
Coleoptcra and Hemiptera will be more accurate than for some of the
other groups. From Table 7 it will be seen that 81 per cent, of the
blackfish, 76 per cent, of the rainbow trout, 57 per cent, of the Macquarie
perch and 28 per cent, of the English perch examined had eaten
Trichoptera. The Coleoptera form the next most important group on
the basis of this analysis ; 62 per cent, of the brown trout had eaten these
insects, 57 per cent, of the blackfish, 52 per cent, of the rainbow trout
and 26 per cent, of the Macquarie perch. The Hemiptera occupy a more

significant position-on this basis; 50 per cent, of the brown trout, 43 per
cent, of the rainbow trout, 14 per cent, of the blackfish, 12 per cent, of
the Macquarie perch and 4 per cent, of the English perch examined had
taken these insects.
Before leaving the question of the competition for food, two other fish
species must be mentioned briefly. The stomach contents of a number
of specimens of Galaxias atteniuatus were examined (Tables 6 and 7) as
this fish plays an important part in the food cycle, particularly that of the
larger fish, by which it is frequently eaten. The groups of organisms
taken by this small fish are very similar to those taken by the other fish
species already discussed, with this difference, that the species within each
group of organisms are all small forms. Diptera represent 49 per cent,
of the food taken and Mollusca and Coleoptera form the remaining two
important groups. Trichoptera are conspicuous by their almost complete
absence from the diet of this fish but this appears to be dependent on the
fact that the food taken by Galaxias does not give any indication of
bottom feeding. Percival (1932) discussing the food of Galaxias attennatus
in New Zealand records that caddis larvae, pupae and adults and the
larvae of midges, &c., were found in the gut contents of this species.
The principal difference is the presence of a number of Trichoptera.


There has been no opportunity to examine the stomach contents of
other than a few specimens of eels, but in view of comments by Cairns
(1942) this matter will have to be investigated. According to this
writer, a comparison of the food of trout and eels in New Zealand indicates
that the eel is a definite competitor with the trout for the same types of
food. Apparently even the genera of the food organisms represented are
essentially the same in both cases and Trichoptera occupy an important
position in the diet of both fish.
There are several other matters to be discussed whilst dealing with the
question of the analyses of the stomach contents of our freshwater fish.
The proportion of larval to adult insect forms throws further light on
the feeding habits of the different fish species. Of a total of 3,314
Trichoptera eaten by the brown trout examined 3,250 were larvae, 56
were pupae and 8 adults. Of the 380 Ephemeroptera eaten, 212 were
larvae, 5 sub-imagos, and 163 were adults. A total of 1,022 Diptera
were eaten and these were made up of 677 larvae, 199 pupae, and 146
adults. Only 71 Perlaria were taken but of these 51 were larvae. It will
be seen that the majority of these typical aquatic forms are taken before
they leave the water. As the greater part of the life of these four orders
of insects is spent in the water it is not surprising that the larval and
pupal stages constitute such a large proportion of the insects, belonging
to these orders, which are taken. Needham (1938) describes a somewhat
similar position in America; of the Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, and
Diptera eaten by brown trout, I*l per cent., 53*9 per cent., and 2'B per
cent, respectively were adult forms. The position in Victoria in respect
to rainbow trout is much the same ; Trichoptera —6s6 larvae, 1 pupa and
10 adults, Ephemeroptera —102 larvae, 145 sub-imagos, and 12 images,
Diptera —2B2 larvae, 3 pupae, and 29 adults; Perlaria —44 larvae and
3 adults. Corresponding American figures (Needham, 1938) for rainbow
trout are I*4 per cent, adult Trichoptera, 27• 7 per cent, adult Ephemeroptera,
and 15‘8 per cent, adult Diptera. Needham (1934) dealing with a specific
survey on steelhead trout (sea-run rainbow trout) states that of 557
Trichoptera eaten only one was an adult, and of 400 Diptera only 20 were
adults.
A comparison of the United States of America figures for brown and
rainbow trout indicates a greater support for the contention that the
brown trout is more of a surface feeder than is the rainbow trout than do
the figures for Victoria quoted above. But the bulk of the evidence
from which the conclusion in reference to the surface feeding habits of the
brown trout was drawn is based on other dominant food groups such as
Doleoptera, Hymenoplera, and Hemiptera, &c.
One or more of the four insect orders discussed above are significant
in only two of the remaining fish species under discussion. All the
Trichoptera taken by blackfish were larval forms ; the remaining groups
are not important. Diptera are the dominant group in the diet of
Macquarie perch, and of 933 individuals taken 921 were larvae, 10 were
pupae, and only 2 were adults. Trichoptera were represented by 423
individuals and all these were larvae.
.There has been considerable discussion on the part that plant forms
play in the food of fresh water fish. I have frequently found vegetable
material in the stomachs of the two trout species and of the Macquarie
perch. In the case of the Macquarie perch and the rainbow trout the


material usually consists •of green algae. Brown trout stomachs and a
few of the rainbow trout stomachs have contained the leaves and seed
capsules of Leptospermum sp. (ti-tree), the fruits of Eucalypts, the flowers
of Acacias, and the leaves of various other shrubs (this is additional
evidence of the surface feeding habit of the brown trout). The stomachs
of both rainbow and brown trout from Eildon Weir have been reported
to contain large quantities of green algae. The alimentary canal of the
two trout species and of the Macquarie perch are not of the type found in
fish which are vegetable feeders, and it is very doubtful if this material is
deliberately consumed. Generally the green algae are submerged forms
and the leaves and fruit of Leptospermum, &c., are blown on to the
surface of the water from trees and shrubs on the stream banks. The
algae are almost certainly taken when the fish are feeding below the
surface. Fish food such as Mollusca, the nymphs of Ephemeroptera, the
larvae of Trichoptera, &c., are frequently found on and among algae, and
this plant life is ingested while the fish are foraging for the shell fish and
insects. The leaves and fruit floating at the surface of the stream or
lake are taken probably by the fish without any regard to their identity
while the fish are feeding at the surface ; this question of the fish taking
any available object is to be discussed at some length later on. Some of
the floating pieces of vegetable matter may also be taken at the surface
together with insects. Dimick and Mote (1934) express very similar views
to those given above both in regard to the submerged algae and the
floating leaves, &c. A somewhat differing view is expressed by Moffett
(1942) and by Needham (1938). Moffett describes a survey of the
Colorado River (U.S.A.); with only two exceptions the stomachs of
rainbow trout contained algae (70 to 98 per cent, of the contents was
algae), and he states that the examination revealed that they had fed very
uniformly on algae. But Moffett, discussing the work of other authors
in which they state that the examination of the stomachs of some trout
showed that they had been feeding heavily on algae, states that the
consumption of such large quantities of algae by rainbow trout is quite
exceptional. These fish normally eat some algae, but the presence of
such large quantities in these trout suggests that the algae is eaten to get
the nutritive value of aquatic insects which inhabit it. This differs
somewhat from the conclusion he drew in the survey carried out by
himself. Needham found no plant foods in brown trout, but 25 per cent,
of the rainbow trout examined in a survey contained algae. He states
that rainbow trout either feed directly on this alga ( Cladophora ) or they
receive it indirectly along with animal foods, when feeding on rocky
stream bottoms. Pentelow (1932) working with brown trout found
vegetable matter in two cases only.
Brief mention must be made of the various miscellaneous forms found
in the stomachs of trout and particularly of brown trout. I have found
a large mouse, frogs, Gordius worms, &c., in the stomachs of brown trout.
Copley (1940) working in Kenya has found frogs, rats, and weaver birds in
the stomachs of large brown trout. Recently a one and a quarter pound
rainbow trout taken in east Gippsland contained a. 12-inch tiger snake
and I was given also the skeleton of a bird taken from a seven and a half
pound rainbow trout, but generally these odd forms are not found in
rainbow trout to the same degree as in brown trout. Evans (1938-39)
states that he found large quantities of the crustacean Daphnia in the
stomachs of trout he examined and presumably these were legal size fish.
This is of some interest as I have never found Daphnia in the stomachs of


any fish examined although this crustacean is widespread in fresh water
systems. This organism probably could not resist digestion for any
length of time and is also somewhat difficult to see, but if taken in any way
freely by trout it could not have completely escaped detection. Needham
(1937) also records finding Daphnia in the stomachs of trout.
Cannibalism is a widespread characteristic of fish, both fresh water and
marine. Strictly cannibalism is defined as an animal eating its own
species but here it will be used in a wider sense and refers to a fish taking
any other fish as food. In the Victorian survey no fish has been found
taking fish of its own species, although fish play quite an important part
in the diet of fish, particularly in certain waters. In several waters in
this State which are noted for the large fish they produce small fish are
taken very freely. The rainbow trout in Lake Bullen Merri feed on the
native trout ( Galaxias attenuatus , a land-locked form), the tupong or
fresh water flathead ( Psevdaphritis urvillii) and the flat-headed gudgeon
(Philypnodon grandiceps). In Eildon Weir large brown and rainbow
trout feed on the goldfish ( Carassius auratus), the smelt or cucumber fish
{Retropinna semoni), and the form of blackfish known as “ slimys ”
(Gadopsis marmoratus). Phillips (1929) and Percival (1932) report a
very similar diet for trout in New Zealand ; smelt ( Retropinna retropinna)
and Galaxias ( Galaxias attenuatus) are among several other species of fish,
eaten fairly extensively. Brown trout and quinnat salmon ( Oncorhynchus
tschawytscha) in Glenmaggie Weir feed on smelt and in the Barwon River
large brown trout feed on native trout or Galaxias and small Macquarie
perch. Specimens of Galaxias attenuatus have been found in the stomachs
of English perch and pigmy perch ( Nannoperca australis) in the stomachs
of tench {Tinea tinea). In the Deep Creek system brown trout feed on
Galaxias and the flat-headed gudgeon. In all the waters mentioned
above the larger fish eat whatever species of small fish are available and
in some systems these small fish form a major item of diet for the larger
fish. Trout are notorius for eating their own species under the artificial
conditions found in aquaria and hatcheries, yet in river systems, known to
be prolific natural spawning areas, no authentic cases have come to my
notice of trout eating trout. Another matter of interest is the absence of
fish in all the stomachs of blackfish and Macquarie perch which were
examined. In some seasons native trout are one of the principal sources
of food for trout in the Great Lake in Tasmania (Evans, 1937). Needham
(1937) classifies the young of all fishes present as one of the four types of
food available to trout in an area under survey and Dimick and Mote
(1934) state that small-sized fish were conspicuous in the diet of the
larger trout examined. Copley (1940) records the occurrence of true
cannibalism in Kenya in the case of brown trout. This is the only
specific instance in the literature examined.
Before leaving this general discussion on the food of fresh water fish
mention must be made of the effect of weather on the food of trout which
is mentioned by McKeown (1934). This question has been overlooked
apparently by most authors and although of no very great significance
in a survey carried out over a period it is of importance in interpreting
the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain organisms, or a sudden increase
in the numbers of a particular form, found in the stomachs of fish being
examined. At times very large numbers of organisms such as earthworms,
wood lice, and slugs are found in the stomachs of fresh water fish, and it is
obvious that these have been taken by the fish after very heavy rain.

In warm weather, with bright sunshine, the proportion of terrestial insects
taken increases and in dull weather there is a tendency on the part of
trout to feed more on aquatic forms.
B. Food According to the Size of the Fish.
Only two stream systems have provided a sufficient number of
stomachs from fish of varying size to permit a worth-while analysis.
Brown trout from the Deep Creek and the River Yarra have been
divided into two groups: —(1) fish less than 12| inches in length and
(2) fish 12| inches in length or greater. This is an arbitary division and
the fish in the second group are two years old or older. The analyses are
set out in Tables 8 and 9. It appears to be generally accepted that fish
take food according to their size and this applies to a large number of
fresh water fish and to some marine fish at least. A somewhat extreme
case appears to be that of the pickerel (Esox niger and E. americanus) in
United States of America (Hunter and Rankin, 1939) ; these authors
claim that the fish can be divided into two groups on the basis of their
diet, the young, those under 6 inches in length, and the older groups,
those over 6 inches long. The diet of*these two groups is very different.
It must be borne in mind, when interpreting Tables 8 and 9, that the
available food supplies in the streams in question must be considered, as
must also the fact that samples of larger fish, say of 3 lb. and upwards,
from these streams are very small. Evidence from other localities/
indicates very definitely that these larger fish will feed on the larger food
organisms, for example, fish and large crustaceans, when these forms are


available. In the two streams being discussed, the River Yarra and
Deep Creek, neither are the larger food organisms present in any quantity,
nor are large numbers of the bigger fish taken, the latter fact probably
being dependent largely on the former.
Tables 8 and 9 are difficult to interpret on the basis of the size of the
food organisms concerned. In the Deep Creek system (Table 8) significant
differences are found in the proportion of five insect orders taken by the
two groups of trout. Disregarding the size of the fish for the moment,
each of these groups is equally available to all the fish in the stream.
From the nature of each of these groups, each should be, as a group,
equally available to all sizes of fish. This would not be the case if a
group such as the Mollusca was involved ; the smaller trout would not be
capable of detaching some of the larger forms. The only major differences
in the diet of the two size groups of trout within each of these five food
groups lie in the differences in size of the actual food species taken by the
trout and this does not apply to all these food groups. It does apply, of
course, to some of the groups listed in Tables 8 and 9, of which approximately
equal proportions are taken by both size groups of fish ; here, in some
cases, the larger species within a group are taken by the bigger trout.
Returning to the five groups specifically referred to in Table 8 : of these, only
the Coleoptera and Anisoptera contain species which are very divergent in
size. There are no great size differences in the species within the
Hemiptera {Corixidae, Notonectidae, Jassisdae, in particular), Trichoptera,
and Ephemeroptera. I can see no obvious explanation for the different
proportions taken by the two groups of trout within these five insect
orders. Although the stomach samples examined were random samples
collected over a period it is possible that different quantities of these insect
orders were available at different times, and it is essential that further
material from the same systems be examined on the same basis in order to
determine whether these differences are more or less consistent or not.
Phillips (1929) found in New Zealand that very small trout feed on
similar items of diet to large ones, but in different proportions, the
Diptera predominating (that is, in the small fish). He states, however,
that very different results are found in other parts of New Zealand to
where he was working, where considerably larger fish are taken. He
further quotes Parrott, another New Zealand worker, who considers that
the size of the fish largely determines the diet on which it feeds.
Percival (1932) also found dipterous larvae forming the major portion of
the diet of small trout in New Zealand.
Table 9 deals with fish taken in the River Yarra and the diet is very
different from that of the Deep Creek fish. There is a significant
difference in only two groups of food organisms, again both insect orders,
Hemiptera and Ephemeroptera, although in this system the smaller fish
take a larger proportion of Ephemeroptera. As stated above, there is no
very great divergence in size between the species within these orders, and
again it is not possible to draw any definite conclusion. One point of
interest is the fact that Trichoptera play a very important part in the diet
of trout of all sizes.
Discussing the present investigation in more general terms, it has been
my experience that the type of food taken is largely dependent on the
size of the trout. I have found the stomach of a 10-lb. fish to contain
food identical to that taken by a 1-lb. fish, but, conversely, I have found

food organisms in a 10-lb. trout which I have never seen in a 1-lb. trout.
Generally, these larger fish are found in large numbers only in waters
which carry big quantities of the larger food organisms. This broad
conclusion is borne out by many overseas workers. Needham (1934, 1935)
in the United States of America states that it is generally conceded that
small foods are eaten by small trout and that larger fish will eat larger
forms if they can get them. Coleman (1928) discussing trout in Californian
lakes holds the view that trout as they grow in size take larger insects and
their consumption of various sized prey is only governed by the size of
their mouths. Allen (1941), touching on a matter which is to be dealt
with in detail later on, that is, availability of food, but which has been ■
assumed already in this present discussion, states that among fish of
similar habits it appears probable that changes with the size (that is, of
the fish) are of greater significance in respect to the food taken than are.
differences between species. He quotes the case of Salmonidae, living in
streams, as an example ; the larger food organisms become available as
the fish become larger. A final reference is to a paper by Surber (1940)
which discusses the food of the small mouth bass ; here again changes in
diet are correlated with the ability of the growing fish to take organisms
of increasing size.
C, Seasonal Feeding.
For the purpose of this survey the stomach contents of the brown
trout were analyzed on the basis as to whether they were surface,
sub-surface or a mixture of surface and sub-surface in origin (see Table 10).
The definitions of these terms are obvious; surface food consists of any
organisms, irrespective of their origin, which are found floating on the
surface of the water; sub-surface food consists of all organisms found
below the surface. In actual fact, these two groups conform, very
closely with the definitions of terrestial and aquatic food organisms given
earlier in this paper. The trout season in this State extends from the
first of September of one year until the thirtieth of April in the following
year, and thus is spread over the spring, summer, and autumn seasons.
This discussion will have to be confined to these seasons, as, as has already
been stated, the bulk of the material used as the basis of this investigation
was supplied by anglers who had to conform with the “ open ” season.
An examination of Table 10 shows that surface food is available throughout
the spring, summer, and autumn. It is not' possible to make a detailed
comparison from month to month, as the number of stomachs available for
each month varies considerably. Comparatively few fish are corapletly
surface or sub-surface feeders and approximately 60 per cent, of the fish
examined obtained their food from the two sources. Sub-surface food
was dominant in one month only —September —and winged forms, apparently,
are not as much in evidence then as in the summer and autumn.

Generally, winged forms are available throughout the trout season,
and there is no marked seasonal feeding under Victorian conditions, that
is, there are no definite periods of either surface or sub-surface feeding.
Dimick and Mote (1934) report the position in Oregon (U.S.A.); during
the spring, summer, and fall months insects of terrestial origin were
prominent items in the diet of trout examined. These insects were
least numerous during the winter months, frequent during the spring
months, and more numerous during summer and fall months. Parrot
(1928-29) quoted by Phillips (1929) states that diet varies according to
the time of the year, but Phillips supports this statement only in respect
to certain districts. An examination of the New Zealand literature,
Phillips (1929, 1931), Percival (1932) suggests that there would be
possibly a greater demonstration of seasonal feeding on the part of trout
in New Zealand waters than is the case in Victoria (if the data is examined
in the same way as in Table 10). This statement is made in view of the
fact that insects of terrestial origin play a very insignificant part in the
diet of trout in New Zealand and that a very large proportion of the
surface food taken by trout in that country is aquatic in origin, and the
major hatches are more or less restricted to the warmer months of the
year. That is, one would expect to find well defined periods of surface
and of sub-surface feeding.
D. Food in Different Localities.
In a survey of the food of fresh water fish it is of considerable
importance to know the type of habitat in which the fish have been
living, in other words, the stream type. Little attention has been paid


previously to this aspect of food surveys. Table 11 sets out the food of
brown trout in four different localities and marked differences in the diet
of the fish from the various waters are obvious. Again, a later section of
this paper must be anticipated and it is assumed that trout, generally,
take whatever food is available under a given set of conditions. Phillips
(1932) working in New Zealand discusses each group of trout food in
some detail and discusses further the types of streams or lakes in which
each of these groups is most likely to be found, that is, he is relating each'
group of organisms to a given stream type. This is an important point.
To follow further Phillips’ line of discussion, it has been our experience in
this State, and this should be equally true for any country, that a number
of streams, each equally capable of carrying large quantities of fish food
(the factors controlling this are to be dealt with in some detail later),
may each carry very different dominant food groups according to the
nature of the stream.
Four stream systems are listed in Table 11, and the following
descriptions are more or less generalized and apply to the stretch of water
from which the samples have been taken :
(а) River Yarra —This is not a big stream ; it flows at times over a
muddy bed with many logs, at times over a gravel or stony
bed. It is generally a fairly fast flowing - stream.
(б) Barwon River in the Geelong area—An alluvial stream ; some
large rock outcrops. In the neighbourhood of Geelong
itself it is a locked water being held between a rock barrier
and an artificial breakwater. Slow flowing; very luxuriant
aquatic plant growth.
(c) Deep, Emu, and Jacksons Creeks —These are all part of the
one system and may be regarded as a single unit. All
small perennial streams with a rocky or gravelly bed ;
shallow water with some deep holes.
( d) Goulburn River between Eildon Weir and Thornton —A fairly
large stream ; the bed varies from gravel to silt in places ;
fast flowing but a fluctuating flow due to the control exercised
at Eildon Weir.
As mentioned earlier, the assumption is made that the analyses set
out in Table 11 indicate food availability rather than food preference.
If this is so, these analyses give some indication of the preponderance of
the various groups in these different streams.
Table 11 does not indicate fully which of the food is aquatic in origin
and which is terrestial in origin but an examination of the detailed
analyses, from which the table has been compiled, shows that 2 per cent,
of the food taken by brown trout in the Barwon River is terrestial in
origin ; 14 per cent., 20 per cent., and 50 per cent, of the food taken by
brown trout in the Deep Creek system, the Goulburn River and the River
Yarra respectively is terrestial in origin. These percentages of terrestial
food, although not fully indicative of the food position in the various
streams, do make up for a deficiency in available aquatic food.
Trichoptera form the dominant food group in the Yarra, and it will be
seen that this is the only significant aquatic group in the diet of the Yarra
fish. The bulk of the Trichoptera larvae taken have sand grain cases of
various types and belong to the one Family Sericostomatidae which is
typical for this stream type. Ephemeroptera is the only other aquatic
group represented in appreciable numbers (4 - 2 per cent.) and together
with the Trichoptera make up 40-5 per cent, of the food organisms taken.


Fifty per cent, of the food consists of terrestial insects and is made up
principally of two insect orders, Hymenoptera and Jsoptera. The remaining
9-5 p6r cent, of the food organisms eaten is split up between a large
number of groups. Apart from Trichopiem and perhaps Ephemeroptera,
streams such as the Yarra do not carry a great variety of aquatic groups,
and the diet of the fish in this stream conforms with what one would
expect to find.
The Barwon River is a very different stream type; a sluggish,
alluvial stream carrying large quantities of aquatic plants. Again the
diet of the trout in this stream conforms very closely with the aquatic
fauna normally found associated with a stream of this description.
Crustacea form the dominant diet group (71-4 per cent.) and all these are
shrimps ( Paratya australiensis) ; these organisms are found normally in
association with aquatic plants in comparatively still water. Fish are
important also (14'6 per cent.), and consist of Galaxias attenuatus and
Macquaria australasica (Macquarie perch). Galaxias are found in very
large numbers in this stream, and the Macquarie perch is increasing rapidly
since it was introduced from the northern streams a few years back.
This is the only stream of the four under discussion in which fish form an
important item of diet; this is not because of a disproportionately large
sample of the bigger fish from this stream. Hemiptera is the remaining
important group (9'4 per cent.) and all the food organisms coming within this
group belong to two purely aquatic families —Corixidae and Notonectidae.
The heavy weed growth associated with the sluggish flow of this stream
is reflected in the diet. Ninety-five per cent, of the food taken by brown
trout in the Barwon examined in this survey is made up of two families of
insects belonging to the one order, one family of Crustacea and two families
of the Phylum Pisces. This is a different position from that found in all
other streams or lakes from which samples have been collected to date.
A qualitative survey of the fauna of the Barwon River has been carried
out over a number of years, and the dominant groups (not necessarily in
order of importance) are Pisces, Crustacea, and of the Insecta, Hemiptera,
Perlaria, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. The dominant items
of diet are Crustacea, Pisces, and Hemiptera. The almost complete absence
of Trichoptera and Odonata is somewhat difficult to explain ; many of the
larvae of Trichoptera and the larval forms of the Odonata inhabit the weed
from which the bulk of the Crustacea and Hemiptera are obtained. The
latter two groups are generally more active and perhaps for that reason
are more obvious, and further, both groups would tend to move away from
the weeds more frequently than the former groups. This may be a
possible explanation for the fact that Crustacea and Hemiptera are taken in
large numbers, whilst the Trichoptera and Odonata are not. Neither
Perlaria nor Ephemeroptera appear in the diet of the Barwon trout, but this
is due, I think, to the fact that the majority of the larval forms of these
two groups, together with a large proportion of the trichopterous larvae,
are not available to the trout as food ; they are found under large rocks in
areas of rapids. A large number of these rocks are damp only and could
not be approached by the fish, and further, many of the rocks which are in
running water are very large, and the immense number of food organisms
attached to and under these rocks are not accessible to trout.
The Deep Creek system consists of small perennial streams with rocky,
stony, or gravelly beds, with some deep holes. Here, new food groups
assume the dominant positions in the diet of the trout and the bulk of the


food is aquatic in origin. Coleoptera, the majority of which are aquatic, is
the dominant group (34.3 per cent.) in the trout food. These are
mainly small beetles, many of them similar to the “ riffle ” beetles of the
United States. This term describes their habitat, and riffles are numerous
in the streams belonging to this system. These streams also carry a
certain amount of aquatic plants and this habitat, contributes a number of
Hemiptera (18.6 per cent.), particularly of the Family Corixidae, and also
Crustacea (10.6 per cent.), again consisting largely of shrimps. The
Trichoptera form an important group (12.2 per cent.) and these again
consist largely of sand grain case larvae belonging to the Family
Sericostomatidae (see comments on the River Yarra). This is the only
system under survey in which Mollusca are significant (5.8 per cent.);
these are small forms.
The Goulburn River is very different from any of the streams already
discussed. It is a much larger stream carrying a considerable quantity
of water and running over a bed which varies from gravel (large) to silt.
Diptera constitute the most important group of food organisms (48.9 per
cent.) and of these 39 per cent, are aquatic. Diptera are not as simply
classified according to a stream type as are many of the other groups which
have been discussed but generally they are not found in great quantities
in a fast running stream. Certain families of the Diptera —for example,
the Culicidae, are most definitely inhabitants of quiet or still water.
It is possible that many of the dipterous larvae eaten' by trout in this
water have come down from the Eildon Weir, which is a large body of
comparatively quiet water. The Trichoptera, the second most important
food group, are again typical of the stream type. Of the Coleoptera (12.3
per cent.), 8 per cent, are aquatic, and these belong to the more robust
species of the Families Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae. The three insect
orders-already mentioned make up 86.6 per cent, of the food of trout of
this area ; the remaining 13.4 per cent, consists of a number of other
groups.
Needham (1935) in a general article on the natural food of trout in
the United States discusses more specifically the food of trout in three
very different stream types and shows that there are marked differences
in the diet of the fish in these three streams. From the brief description
given of these streams they appear in no way comparable with those which
have been discussed here and it is not possible to make any further
comparison. The actual effects on trout of the different diets is to be
discussed in a later section on food and growth.
E. Availability or Selection of Food.
Before discussing this matter it is desirable first to attempt some
definition of the terms to be used. One or other of the expressions
“ preference ” and “ selection ” are commonly used when it is intended to
express the opinion that fish actually exercise one or other function as
the antithesis to the view that fish merely depend on “ availability ” of
food. Ido not consider that the use of one or other of the first two terms
is significant, and feel that the two may be accepted as being more or less
synonymous —for example, a fish to exhibit a preference must practise
selection of food. Whenever reference is made to authors who use one
or other of these expressions I am accepting it in the sense outlined above.
That is, this discussion is to be whether fish take whatever food is


available to them or whether they actually select food organisms from
among those which are available to them. Further distinction is made
by some authors between “ accessibility ” and “ availability.” By
“ availability ” I understand that food organisms can be taken by a fish
because there are no physical barriers, such as a particular type of habitat
which the fish cannot enter, to prevent it taking those particular organisms.
“ Accessibility ” can only refer to “ degree of availability ”, that is, some
organisms may be taken more easily than others, again because of the
different types of habitats occupied by the various groups of food organisms.
For example, an organism living among aquatic weeds would be more
available, that is, more easily accessible to a fish, than one living under a
rock. Needham (1939) in discussing seasonal availability of particular
foods has taken care to define the use of the term. He states that
“ The term £ available ’ or ‘ availability ’ is used here to mean potential,
rather than actual, availability. An animal may be abundant as to
numbers and its potential value as a food be high, but if trout cannot get
them to eat because of its habits, or for other reasons, its actual availability
as a food element may be very low.” Availability, as used by myself,
refers, according to ray definition above, to actual availability.
It should be borne in mind that availability cannot be discussed in
detail until such time as stream surveys are carried out in conjunction
with examinations of stomach contents.
Selection of food as between different species of fish has been discussed
already in this paper (see Tables 1 to 7) and there is no doubt that this
occurs. Selection of food as between different sizes of fish within a
species has also been discussed and this can be accepted. Hunter and
Rankin (1939) discuss the selection of different foods by fish of various
size belonging to two species of pickerel (Esox niger and E. americanus)
which are taken in the same schools, that is, both the young and the older
fish have access to the same types and quantities of food organisms.
Shapovalov (1936) quotes another case of remarkable selective feeding by
large and small striped bass (Boccus lineatus) which were taken from the
one school which had been in the same hole for over a month.
This discussion is concerned mainly with the feeding habits of trout.
The data to hand for fish in this State definitely indicate that both rainbow
and brown trout take whatever food is available and exercise little or no
selection. This conclusion is supported by the bulk of the evidence from
overseas and from other Australian States.
Streams in the Apollo Bay and Lome districts carry very large food
supplies, particularly the nymphs of Perlaria and Ephemeroptera and yet
these streams, which are shallow and fast running over gravel and stony
beds, are known for the small trout they carry. The reason for this is
that this food is not available to the fish as the bulk of these organisms
are found on the lower surfaces of the stones. These streams generally,
offer only one type of habitat (apart from that of the free swimmers and
surface inhabiting forms) for an invertebrate fauna, that is, rocks and
gravels submerged or semi-submerged in fast running water. It must
not be assumed from this that food is the only factor contributing to the
growth of fish.
The Barwon River has been dealt with at some length already.
Odonata and Trichoptera are among the dominant groups found in this
stream and yet they are rarely found in the stomach contents of trout.


This is due to the fact that they are not available as trout food, or rather,
that they are less available than some other groups, and not to the fact
that some groups are selected as food by the trout in preference to other
groups. The larvae of Odonata and Trichoptera, and Hemiptera and
Crustacea are found together in the one association—aquatic weeds—and
yet the first two groups are rarely taken by trout (this refers, of course, to
the period covered by this survey). It has been suggested that the latter two-
groups are taken because they are more active and thus more obvious to
the fish and secondly, because they also move away from the protection of
the weed more frequently, that is, they are more available. The Trichoptera
found in the weed association belong to the Family Leptoceridae and
although taken freely in many waters they were eaten very infrequently
by trout in the Barwon in the period under survey. Two other families
of Trichoptera are also well represented in the Barwon ; (a) the Hydropschidae,
these construct a case of pebbles which is attached to the under side of
rocks, usually in fast running water and are thus not available to the
trout; (6) Hydroptilidae, these construct a small transparent gelatinous
case and are found usually moving over rocks and submerged timber where
they feed on slime algae. These are not taken probably because of their
very small size and because of the fact that they are inconspicuous.
The insect Order of Odonata is divided into two Sub-Orders, Anisoptera
and Zygoptera. In waters carrying large numbers of nymphs of both
sub-orders it is frequently found that the anisopterous nymphs are taken
by trout while the zygopterous nymphs are not. This is again probably
due to the fact that the former nymphs move in a wider environment and
are more active than the latter which are found among aquatic weeds.
Apart from these more or less specific instances in which the food
taken by trout is dependent upon availability rather than any selection
exercised by the fish, the analyses of* the stomach contents of rainbow
and brown trout set out in Tables 1,2, 7, and 11 show the very catholic
tastes of trout. It is evident that the two trout species take whatever
food is available.
As stated earlier, the general consensus of opinion supports feeding
according to availability rather than by selection. According to Percival
(1932) there is considerable evidence now accumulated that the trout in
New Zealand obtain the bulk of its food from the water and that the kind
of food taken depends largely upon what is to be had. He states further
that it is well known that a fish will eat one kind of organism for a period
and then will turn to something else, or will cease to feed. This latter fact is
often advanced in support of selection of food. Almost exclusive feeding
on a single type of organism is quite a frequent occurrence ; I have found
trout gorged with grasshoppers, or termites, or winged ants, with a species
of Paropsis larvae (chrysomelid beetle) or with caddis larvae. This is not
evidence for selection ; it is characteristic for all these organisms to occur
at times in very large numbers and it is particularly easy for a fish to
obtain all the food necessary within a very small area ; it is unlikely that
a fish finding itself in these circumstances would move away to look for
other food. McKeown (1934, 1934 a), on the basis of data collected in
New South Wales, has come to the conclusion that trout feed’ on any
small animals which may come within their reach. Tasmania is the only
other area within Australasia in which work has been done on the food of
trout. Evans (1937, 1939, 1942) supports the view that trout feed on
the available organisms and yet, in another report (1938), he states that


there is little doubt, that not only are large Crustacea, small fish and
Mollusca chosen as food by trout in preference to insects, but that they
provide a better diet. It is possible again that this is rather a question
of degree of availability rather than actual selection by the trout. In his
1942 report, in which all previous work is summarized, Evans makes the
basic assumption that random samples of the available food have been
eaten by trout. Pentelow (1932) in England, Bush (1933) in Natal, and
Copley (1940) in Kenya all state that trout feed on the available organisms
but Pentelow and Copley refer to certain exceptions. Several species of
Perlaria are very common as larvae in a stream surveyed by Pentelow and
yet neither the larvae or adults have been found in the stomachs of trout;
Pentelow cannot advance any explanation for this. It may be that the
larval forms are not available but it is difficult to see that this could apply
to the adults. Ephemeroptera occur in the stream examined by Copley
and yet are comparatively untouched by the trout (brown). Copley
suggests that either the trout cannot get at the Ephemeroptera or that they
do not like them. He quotes another case in which crabs and an
indigenous fish are a large source of food for trout and then for a period
of three months the fish feed heavily on Libellulidae (dragon-fly) nymphs
and rarely touch crabs. This may again be due to differences in degree
of availability. However, these sometimes unexplained exceptions do
not render invalid the general conclusion that trout feed on the available
food organisms.
Very detailed work has been carried out in the United States,
particularly quantitative stream surveys in conjunction with examinations
of stomach contents. Further evidence that the diet of trout is based on
the available food supplies is advanced by Snyder (1933), Rayner (1937),
Needham (1938), Needham and Rayner (1939), Needham and Sumner
(1941), and Raney (1941) and much of this is based on quantitative surveys.
Surber (1941), in advancing reasons for the necessity for determining the
relative importance of the different items eaten compared to the potential
food supply, quotes a statement by Hubbs and Bailey : “It is becoming
more generally accepted among fisheries investigators that food habits
are to a large extent dependent upon the availability of different food
organisms. It is invalid to assume, because stomachs contain certain
food items, that these items are preferred and that other items have been
rejected.”
Very few authors actually support the view that trout actively select
their food. According to Coleman (1928) trout, as they grow older, become
more selective. Morofsky (1936) states that brown trout actually prefer
certain species of caddis fly larvae and Allen (1941) contends that in
addition to the availability of the food animals, selection by the fish
probably also plays an important part in determining what animals are
actually eaten and further, the existence and extent of selection is not
easy to determine, and it is not at present possible to lay down any
general principles with regard to it. Hess and Rainwater (1939) have
developed a method for measuring “ the food preference of trout ”. This
is an unfortunate choice of words as the method they have developed
(and it. is of definite practical value) is actually one for measuring
availability as the text of their paper itself indicates.
The art of fly fishing for trout is more or less based on the assumption
that trout are highly selective in their feeding habits. Some of the greatest
claims are made by people who are not themselves fishermen : Phillips


(1929) quotes Hayes as stating that trout will take the female may-fly,
but often reject the male fly. Tillyard (1933) in referring to the hatch of
the Snowflake Caddis or so-called “ Shannon Moth ” ( Smicridea sp.) in
Tasmania states that when the “ rise ” of this caddis is on, anglers have
noted that the trout, though feeding voraciously on the flies, will often
refuse an artificial fly tied to resemble one of them. However, if a
“ Hare’s Ear ”or similar fly be used, the trout will rise to it. He states
further that the obvious explanation for this is that the trout are
actually more on the look out for the succulent females than for the less
attractive but more abundant males. A “ Hare’s Ear ” fly, used dry, closely
resembles a newly emerged female of the Snowflake Caddis, and should
form an irresistible lure for trout feeding on the rise of this insect.
It will be noted that both Hayes and Tillyard credit the trout with
extraordinary powers of discernment in that they actually select female
Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera from out of a mixed population of males
and females. There is no doubt that the females of each group would
provide much more valuable food than the males as the females are
literally merely sacs of eggs.
Both Snyder (1933) and Needham (1938) refer to the faith of anglers
in the selective powers of trout.
Under certain conditions trout will not take a fly which is not a very
close replica of a natural fly which is hatching at the time. Under other
conditions almost any artificial fly will be taken by a fish. Anglers
themselves cannot explain this apparent inconsistency. Anglers claim
further that in the case of a big “ hatch ” of Ephemeroptera (may-flies) for
a time the fish will not take any type of fly other than that classed as a
“ nymph ” ; this represents the nymphal form of the mayfly rising to the
surface of the stream to “ hatch ”. Then the fish will take only the flies
known as “ Duns ” which are intended to resemble the mayfly sub-imago ;
at this stage the fish will no longer take “ nymphs ” despite the fact that
the nymphs are still rising to the surface. The final stage is reached
when the imagos or adults are emerging from the sub-imagos ; the flies
resembling the imagos are known as “ spinners ”. Again the fish may
take only “ spinners ” although there are still numbers of the sub-imagos
about. This can, I think, be explained in part at least, on two grounds.
The first is that of degree of availability; at first only nymphs are
available and the fish are feeding exclusively on these forms as they move
to the surface of the stream. The next stage in the life cycle of the
mayfly is the sub-imago and this emerges from the nymph at the surface
of the water, and in certain species of mayflies these sub-imagos remain
floating on the surface. These are present in large numbers and trout
commence feeding on them, and although more nymphs are rising to the
surface, the fish are feeding at the surface. The second factor now comes
into operation; the fish have changed from sub-surface feeding to
surface feeding and they tend to remain at the surface feeding on the
most easily available forms —the sub-imagos, or the “ duns ” of the
fishermen. The imagos or adults emerge from the sub-imagos and very
soon the imagos are the dominant form and the trout feed more or less
exclusively on these. From examination of the stomach contents of
trout which have supposedly been feeding exclusively on one or other of
the forms mentioned above, it is obvious that the trout need not feed on
one organism only to the complete exclusion of all others ; odd organisms


are taken at such times. Anglers instance experiences which apparently
afford strong support to the selective powers of trout and which are
difficult to explain. But it must be remembered that in discussing this
matter, an immeasurable factor is involved, that is, the human element,
particularly in respect to the interpretation of events observed in the
field.
F. Food —Growth.
The data on the growth rate of trout given in the following discussion
are based on the direct proportion formula although it is realized that this
method is now open to some criticism. While some adjustment may be
necessary, it is felt that such adjustments will not be of sufficient magnitude
to appreciably affect the general conclusions drawn in this paper.
In a more specific discussion on the growth rate of trout, modification of
the method used on this occasion will have to be considered in detail.
It is generally considered that there are a number of factors which
contribute to the growth of fish : the pH value of water has long been
regarded as of considerable importance ; to generalize, the larger trout
are usually taken in alkaline waters (that is, waters with a pH value
greater than seven) and the smaller fish (weight for age) in acid waters
(waters with a pH value of less than seven). Streams or lakes with a
catchment area including granitic outcrops or with peat in its topography
(for example, Lake Catani on the Buffalo Plateau) may. be expected to
carry an acid water; streams running through limestone areas (for
example, the Barwon River in the Western District) are normally
alkaline.
The density of fish population may also affect the growth rate ; if a
water is overstocked with trout (naturally or artificially) the resulting
competition for food may result in an overall reduction in the growth rate
together with a limit in size to which the fish may grow.
Inbreeding is frequently blamed for the poor growth of fish in certain
waters.
Climatic conditions, with particular reference to prevailing temperatures,
have been considered as a further factor influencing the growth of
freshwater fish.
Stream or lake conditions, that is, the environmental conditions, are
of some importance in respect to the general well-being of trout, including
their growth rate. A suitable habitat has a considerable influence on
reproduction, the general condition of fish, &c.
The most obvious factor contributing to the growth of fish is the
supply of available food ; wdiereas some of the factors mentioned above
influence the growth rate indirectly, this factor does so directly. Langford
and Martin (1940) who carried out a study on seasonal variation in stomach
contents and the rate of growth came to the conclusion that the correlation
between seasonal variation in the volume of stomach contents and the
seasonal changes in - growth increments are so well marked that food is
believed to be the primary factor controlling growth. Bush (1933) states
that the nature of the available food supply is a limiting factor in growth,
and according to Percival (1932) there is every reason to believe that the
accelerated growth frequently shown by fish during one in several years
is due to the movement of the fish into improved feeding conditions.


There is sufficient ecological data on a few V ictorian waters, including
the growth rate of the fish in these waters, now available to permit a
discussion on the part played by the various factors which have been
mentioned above, influencing the growth rate of fish. Four of these will
be dealt with briefly and then the pH value of the waters and the supplies
of available food will be discussed in some detail.
Density of population can be a significant factor and is so in one of the
waters to be discussed-Lake Catani. There the trout population,
because of ideal conditions for natural reproduction, increase to such a
degree as to result in overcrowding. The limited food supplies were not
sufficient to maintain the population and the fish became stunted, length
and weight for age. Other factors were also responsible for a poor growth
rate in this water and these are to be dealt with later.
Inbreeding does not result in a population of small fish. The bulk of
the rainbow and brown trout in this State have been bred T^'°
original consignments of trout eggs which have been introduced mdirec y
through New Zealand and Tasmania. The breeding of trout has been
carried out in various hatcheries for many years but, to my knowledge,
no additional stocks (“ new blood ”) have been introduced. The young
fish, which have come from the same line, are liberated in different waters.
In ’some streams these fish show an excellent growth; in others the
growth rate is poor. In other words, the streams which are stocked may
be suitable or unsuitable for trout. Bush (1933) quotes Knut Dahl, from
a iournal which has not been available in this country, as follows; No
trout may apparently be considered as possessing definite and hereditary
capacities for a definite kind of growth. Growth always appears to be a
product of exterior influences.”
Temperature may be regarded generally as not being significant in as
far as it affects the growth rate. There appears to be little definite
information on the lower temperature limit for trout but these fish are not
affected by temperatures which freeze the upper stratum of lakes. ihe
upper limits for the two trout species vary somewhat according to local
conditions but it is in the neighbourhood of 83° Fahrenheit for brown trout
and 85° Fahrenheit for rainbow trout.
Stream conditions also do not affect the growth rate directly
Different environmental conditions may affect the type and quantity ol
available food, as has been discussed in the section on food in different
localities, although they need not necessarily affect the volume ot
available food.
I wish to discuss now the relationship between the chemical nature of
the water, the supplies of available food and growth, with specific
reference to several Victorian waters. Growth rates, in terms ol length
and weight, will be given for these various waters. They are to be
regarded as typical for these waters for the period of the present survey
onlv and not as final figures. Early mention was made ol the extreme
range of conditions which may be found in streams and lakes, even in those
only a few miles apart. This applies also to a single water system over
a number of years ; food supplies can fluctuate violently and with these
fluctuations the growth rate may vary also from year to year.
The future history of a fish may be determined by its growth in its first
year tfr two A fish introduced in to, or produced in, an area ol plentiful
supplies of food organisms will develop quickly from the outset, and

granted a continued ample supply of food, will maintain a good growth
rate. Fish tend, as has been shown, to take food according to their size ;
a good growth rate for the first year permits the fish to take larger food
organisms, or, if the larger organisms are not present, to compete more
actively for the available food supplies, and to thus maintain the early
lead.
The role of nutrients (phosphates and nitrates) in the plant-animal
cycle has been recognized for a long time and has been put to practical
application in agricultural practice over a considerable period. In more
recent years the similar role of nutrients under marine conditions has been
gaining recognition and this also applies to freshwater bodies. The
relation of nutrients to fish growth has been regarded as fundamental by
the Victorian Fresh Water Research Committee (of which I am a member)
for some time and it was discussed frequently by that body when it was
active in pre-war years. These discussions were initiated and given impetus
by Mr. V. G. Anderson, the President of the Committee, who has carried
out detailed chemical analyses of the majority of Victorian waters.
Four V ictorian stream systems have been discussed in some detail
already; these are the Barwon River, Deep Creek, Goulburn River, and
the River Yarra. The growth rate of the trout in these waters differs
considerably (see Tables 12 and 13) as does also the nutrient content of the
waters in these streams. It is not proposed to give detailed chemical
analyses in this paper but the streams as listed above are in order of
decreasing nutrient content. Examination of Tables 12 and 13 indicates
that the growth rate decreases with the decreasing nutrient contents of
the waters in which the fish live.

The nutrient content of the Barwon River is good for a stream ; that
of the Yarra is poor. On this basis of comparison the Goulburn River is
intermediate between the Barwon and the Yarra and Deep Creek falls
between the Goulburn and the Barwon. That is, the nutrient contents
of the Barwon, Deep Creek, and the Goulburn lie closer together than does
the nutrient content of any one of these streams to that of the Yarra.
In Table 12 the first year group is missing because all the material has
been supplied by anglers and except in a few localities fish of this age do
not conform with the minimum legal length. For the second and third
years the weight of the fish in these streams is closely correlated with the
nutrient content. This correlation appears to break down somewhat in
the fourth year when the Deep Creek and the Goulburn River are linked
together, followed by the Barwon River and finally the Yarra. This
apparent breakdown is due to natural mortality operating on each of the
successive age groups, that is, fewer fish of each of the older age groups
are available, and this is reflected in the very small number of these older
fish taken by anglers. The samples of fish of four years old and upwards
are not large enough to be used.
On the basis of length (Table 13) the fish from the Barwon, Deep Creek,
and the Goulburn may be taken together, with the fish from the Yarra in
marked contrast.
Other Victorian waters carry fish exhibiting extremes of growth rate :
Lake Bullen Merri, rainbow trout, three years old fish weighing 14 lb.;
Coleraine, rainbow trout, years old fish weighing 9£ lb.; Lake
Purrumbete, male rainbow trout, 3 years old, 32 inches in length and
weighing 18 lb. 9 oz.; female rainbow trout, 3 years old, 30| inches in
length and weighing 14 lb. 2 oz. ; 103 rainbow trout, netted fish, average
weight 14| lb. ; 20 rainbow trout taken by anglers, average weight of
12 lb. 2 oz., length at end of third year of 29 inches. The fish from these
waters show an extraordinary growth rate. At the other extreme, fish
from Lake Catani may be mentioned ; the average length and weight for
brown trout aged 4 years 2 months from this locality are 13 inches and
12 ozs. respectively. The three waters —Lake Purrumbete, Lake Bullen
Merri, and Coleraine, but particularly the first two, have a very high
nutrient content, in fact, amongst the highest for any waters in this State.
In these same waters are fish which exhibit the greatest growth rate for
the State. These waters carry literally enormous quantities of invertebrate
and vertebrate fish food and at present are carrying only a fraction of the
fish they are capable of carrying. They could carry an increased
population and still maintain a growth rate comparable with that found
in these waters at present.

, fhese fish showing a remarkable growth rate are rainbow trout but it
is now proposed to make a comparison of brown trout from the Barwon
River, which show a good growth rate for river fish, with the brown trout
from Lake Catani. There is a very marked difference in the growth rate
of trout in these two waters, (See Table 14.)
The Barwon is a stream with a high nutrient content; Lake Catani
has a very low nutrient content. The nutrients in waters like Lake
Catani may fluctuate, for example, after bush fires the phosphate content
will rise temporarily.
4 here may appear to be some discrepancy in the figures for Barwon
Ri\er fish in Tables 12, 13, and 14 ; this is due to the fact that the figures in
Tables 12 and 13 are based on a greater number of fish than in Table 14 as
it was considered desirable to select fish which could be compared directly
with the samples from Lake Catani on an age basis. Again the figures in
Table 14 may be accepted only for the period of the survey. The very
marked differences, both in respect to length and weight for age, in these
two waters may be correlated with the differences in the nutrient content
of these waters. In the case of Lake Catani at least one other factor has
to be considered, that of overcrowding although the effect of this would be
compensated, in part at least, if the Lake carried a greater quantity of
food organisms. Excellent conditions for natural reproduction are found
in the creeks feeding the Lake and this has led to the building up of a fish
population greater than the Lake can carry. I still consider that the
food factor is the most important; a survey of the available food supply
has been made and this indicates a very marked paucity of fish food.
Insufficient food due to the poor nutrient content of the water is the major
factor contributing to the low growth rate; the Lake is capable of
carrying only a very small population of trout.
The hydrogen-ion concentration (the pH value) of water has long been
considered to be an important factor in the growth of trout. That is,
alkaline waters produce fast growing fish ; acid waters produce slow growing
fish. I consider it doubtful whether the pH value of any water itself
directly affects the growth rate of fish in that water.
In Table 15 a number 6f waters already discussed are set out in order
of decreasing nutrient content. Associated w r ith the decreasing nutrient
content of each of these waters is a decreasing invertebrate and vertebrate
fauna suitable for, and available as, fish food. Lake Purrumbete carries one
of the richest faunas in the State ; the Barwon River carries a rich river
fauna; Deep Creek and the Goulburn River are somewhat similar except


that that they carry different types of faunas ; the River Yarra carries a
poor stream fauna and the fauna of Lake Catani is almost negligible.
In the same Table are set out the average pH values for these waters ;
Lake Purrurnbete is definitely an alkaline wader and Lake Catani is an
acid water; the remaining waters are intermediate between these.
The stream or lake condition in each of these waters is suitable for
trout and this cannot be regarded as an important factor affecting the
growth rate in any of these systems. The density of population is
significant in only one water, Lake Catani, and the opinion has been
expressed already, that this is of secondary importance only. Two
significant factors remain ; the pH value of each of these waters and the
nutrient content which is reflected by the food supplies. The two
nutrients, phosphate and nitrate, may be organic or inorganic in origin
and in the case of waters of a high nutrient content, is largely of organic
origin ; these waters are in areas heavily stocked with farm animals.
At this stage the exact part played by the hydrogen-ion concentration,
expressed in terms of pH, is not known, but it is suggested that it is
possible that (by influencing chemical reactions and thus the nutrient
content of the water) it plays a part, indirectly through the available
supplies of food, on the growth rate of the fish. In the waters under
discussion, the more alkaline waters have the greatest nutrient content
and the possible association will have to be investigated. From my own
knowledge of the available literature, I do not know whether the alkaline
waters overseas have been investigated from the aspect of nutrients or
whether high nutrient content is normally associated with alkaline waters,
and a low nutrient content with acid waters. In the United States,
where the raising of fresh water fish is carried out on a large scale in
hatcheries, organic and inorganic nutrients are added to the rearing ponds,
and no reference is made in the literature dealing with these experiments
to the pH values of the waters.
I am hopeful that a rational stocking policy is to be developed in this
country, that is, only waters which are capable of carrying fish will- be
stocked ; this applies to both indigenous and nonindigenous fish. Much
of the propagative and acclimatization work in the past, in many
countries, has resulted in streams being stocked indiscriminately, irrespective
as to whether they are suitable to carry a particular fish species or not.
In an effort to overcome this wastage stream and lake surveys have been
carried out, particularly in the United States, to determine whether
particular waters carry sufficient food supplies and to determine also
the carrying capacity of these waters. Such surveys, to be thorough,
normally absorb a considerable amount of time and labour. I consider
that once a definite relationship between nutrients-food supply-growth
rate has been established, and this need be applied to only a small number
of waters covering poor, medium, and excellent growth rates, and perhaps
with separate reference to streams and lakes, the present methods of
evaluating a water, from the fish management view point, can be replaced
by a more rapid and more accurate system.
The evidence available to date indicates that this may be done through
the medium of chemical analyses. If a stream appears to be satisfactory
from the view point that it offers a suitable environmental condition or
set of conditions for the fish species in question, and this can normally be
determined from a fairly rapid survey, then chemical analyses may be carried


out with particular reference to phosphates and nitrates. It is preferable
perhaps that four analyses be carried out at three monthly intervals so
that a composite picture may be obtained. If the nutrient content is
comparable with that of waters known to produce a satisfactory growth
rate (due to the presence of a supply of suitable and available food
organisms) and if the analyses of other chemical factors are favourable,
then the water in question may be adjudged suitable for stocking
When other conditions are favourable, the rate of growth is roughly
proportional to the quantity of readily available and suitable food and
this, in turn, is dependent upon the nutrient content of the water.
5. SUMMARY.
1. The primary aim of this study is to determine the factors on which
a sound and economic stocking policy may be based.
2. The stomach contents of fish are expressed as an actual count or
each group of food organisms is given as a percentage of the total
stomach contents.
3. Aquatic food organisms are defined as those which spend any phase
of their life history in water.
4. There are marked differences in the diet of brown trout and
rainbow trout in Victoria.
5. Terrestial organisms play an important part in the diet of larown
trout but not in the diet of rainbow trout.
6. The brown trout feeds more at the surface than does the rainbow.
7. The English perch may compete successfully with all the other
species, indigenous, and non-indigenous, particularly on the grounds that
it is capable as a species, under certain conditions, of increasing very
rapidly,
8. The rainbow trout competes with both the Macquarie perch and
the blackfish for the available food supplies. (In actual practice,
competition between rainbow trout and blackfish is not a problem. The
blackfish (yellow-bellied) is a southern form and in the few southern
streams in which rainbow trout do occur the latter fish are normally
found in the upper reaches.)
9. The brown trout also competes with the blackfish. (There are
many instances where blackfish streams have deteriorated but in which
there are no trout. Cardinia Creek might be quoted as an outstanding
example. Further, reference has been made on two occasions in the
text to the fact that major contributing causes to the decline of the
blackfish are deforestation and the accompanying erosion.)
10. The Macquarie perch suffers more from competition with the
rainbow trout than it does from competition with the brown trout.
(Competition between rainbow trout and Macquarie perch is mainly a
problem of artificial waters such as the Eildon Weir. The Macquarie
perch is a northern (in Victoria) fish and in the northern streams the
rainbow trout are found principally in the upper reaches and the
Macquarie perch in the lower reaches. Macquarie perch and brown
trout are found together ; both occupy the lower reaches of the northern
streams.)


11. The opinion is expressed that trout do not deliberately feed on
vegetable matter.
12. Small and large trout feed to a certain extent on the same groups
of food organisms but take them in different proportions. When large
food organisms are available, the bigger fish feed on these larger forms.
13. There is no marked seasonal feeding by brown trout in Victoria ;
surface and sub-surface foods are available throughout the spring,
summer, and autumn months.
14. Different stream types carry very different dominant food groups
according to the nature of the stream and the diet of the trout in these
different waters conforms very closely with the varying faunas.
15. The examination of the stomachs of brown and rainbow trout in
Victoria indicates that both species take whatever food is available and
exercise little or no selection.
16. The supply of suitable and available food is the most important
factor influencing the growth of freshwater fish ; the food supply is in
turn dependent on the nutrient content of the water.
17. It is essential that the relationship between pH value and the
nutrient content of water be examined.
18. It is suggested that the suitability of a water for stocking may be
determined by a rapid survey of environmental conditions in conjunction
with four quarterly chemical analyses of the water with special reference
to the nutrients —nitrates and phosphates.
6. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
I wish to thank the Essendon Fish Protection Society and Anglers’
Club for a continuous supply of fish stomachs over a period of several
years and particularly Mr. L. Houston of that Club, for the somewhat
arduous task, which he has so willingly undertaken, of labelling and
preserving the material and also of collating the necessary data.
Also the Geelong Fish Protection Society and Anglers’ Club for
collections of material and their very real assistance in helping to carry
out the survey of the Barwon River over a period of three years and I
should like to specially mention Mr. L. Mitchell of that Club for his
assistance in collecting material and in organizing assistance for the
survey.
A number of people also have consistently supplied me with material
and I would like to thank Messrs. C. Staples, L. L. Beeson, and M. E.
McCausland of Melbourne and Mrs. Farnbach of Eildon Weir. Without
the assistance of these people, and many others, it would not have been
possible to undertake this survey. This work has been carried out
during the war years and field work in association with freshwater
fisheries has been cut down to that minimum sufficient only to prevent
the complete cancellation of the value of the work done in pre-war years
to permit the carrying out of work more closely associated with the State’s
war time activities.
I wish to thank Mr. D. S. Quayle, formerly Secretary of the Ballarat
Fish Acclimatization Society, for information on the growth rate in some
of the waters discussed, and also Mr. V. G. Anderson, President of the
Victorian Fresh Water Research Committee, for helpfid discussions on
the chemistry of Victorian waters.


Several people have assisted in the identification of material found in
the stomachs of fish examined and I wish to thank Miss Ellen Clark
{Crustacea), Mr. C. J. Gabriel ( Mollusca), Mr. P. Radford and Mr. F. E.
Wilson (aquatic Coleoptera).

8. APPENDIX.
It was mentioned early in this paper that owing to the catholic taste of
trout in that they take any available food organisms, the results of the
analyses of the stomach contents could be used as a contribution to the
fauna survey of the waters in question.
With this in mind, the following lists are appended. They are
naturally incomplete but they will serve as a record of some of the forms
which may be collected in the several streams.
Many of the forms are listed for the first time from these localities.
This may be due to the fact that intensive collecting has not been carried
out in these waters or that the fish have taken organisms which have not
been picked up in normal collecting activities.
