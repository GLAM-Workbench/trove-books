and leaving you to figure to yourselves great square, oblong,
or irregular courts, containing forests of granite columns,
with avenues of obelisks, sphynxes, and nondescript objects,
and directing your attention to Lepsius? book on Egypt, the
right royal gift of the King of Prussia to the Library, we
will proceed to Greece.
As in Egypt, an ostentatious yet morose dominant in-
fluence exulted in the display of architecture in its most
ponderous and durable forms ?so in Greece the genius and
character of the people presented it in a different aspect.
There, while liberty of thought was unfettered, while the
poetic fire pervaded society, and while a religious culture
prevailed, more intellectual than the debased superstition of
the Egyptians, a greater elegance in style is to be observed.
This spirit extended itself to Asia Minor and to Italy, and
oth�r countries colonized by the Greeks. In all are to be
found remains of large buildings, chiefly temples, erected in
honour of the somewhat formidable body of gods and demi-
gods who were believed to have originally tenanted or to
have been admitted into Olympus. Portions of these have
been so frequently repeated or imitated as to be sufficiently
well known to most of you. Here then, as in the last in-
stance, a few only will be mentioned in order to give you
their size.

exception that it is elevated on a lofty terrace approached by a noble
flight of steps, rendered necessary to secure an artificial plateau on a
rock overhanging the Danube.

An account, however brief, of the great buildings at
Home is more than you can expect on the present
occasion; any effort on my part to give you one would
be wholly unprofitable, while the history of the ruins
which encumber the soil is involved in such obscurity, and
while so much doubt exists as to the persons by whom the
original buildings were erected, or the gods to whom dedicated,
?alike forgotten,? or the uses to which they were applied.
There is one class, however, to which it is desirable for
ulterior purposes your attention should be called, namely,
the Basilicas, great rectangular Halls, used either as courts of
justice exclusively, as the derivation implies, or as exchanges
for the congregation of mercantile men, or for the joint
accommodation of both commerce and the law. The
largest was built by the Emperor Maxentius, defeated
and killed in, or drowned after, the battle of Saxa Rubra, or
the red rocks, Oct. 28, A.D. 812, within six miles of Rome,
fought with Constantine, from which event the recognition
in the Roman Empire of the Christian religion may be said
to date.
Authors do not seem to be agreed about the dimensions of
this, but the length being taken at close on 220 feet (the
same as that of our hall), and the ground-plan approaching a
square, its cubic contents must have been very great, although
the symmetry of proportion could not have been as pleasing
as other dispositions would have achieved.
The size of that called the Basilica of Ulpian, or Trajan,
cannot be ascertained either, for although the width, 180
feet, is known, the excavations have not been carried out
beyond 860 feet to either extremity, to determine the
length. So far, however, as exploration has gone, enough
has been developed to show that it must have been of enormous


magnitude. At present the appearance it presents is peculiar.
Two rows of massive columns, more or less mutilated and
defaced, stand in a deep recess like a dry tank, many feet
below the level of the streets which run round it, at
the bases of the churches and houses erected on the con-
solidated heaps of rubbish accumulated during an unknown
number of centuries.
Many others remarkable for their size and conspicuous for
the splendour of their interiors existed at Rome. The
flourishing provincial towns also vied with each other in
rearing similar structures. These Basilicas were amongst the
first buildings converted with the consent of the emperors
into Christian churches ?the transformation was progressive.
The vaulted tribune or Hemicycle, ornamented with
mosaics and frescoes, in which were placed the curule chair
of the prsetor and seats for the judges, elevated above the
quadriporticus or centre, in which the advocates and their
clients assembled, and separated from them by the bema,
assumed the name of the apse; in some instances it was
enlarged and thrown back. Into this was moved the chair
O
of the bishop and the seats of the prebendaries.
The altar, which had previously stood in front of the
praetor, and on which in pagan times sacrifices were offered,
or libations poured out, before the business of the court
began, was covered with a haldachino or canopy.
This quadriporticus was subsequently expanded into
transepts. The oblong entrance hall, formerly thronged
with suitors, witnesses, and spectators, became a nave?the
ship ?or gremium ?thebosom ofthechurch ?into which were
admitted those who had passed through the probationary
classes. By degrees the side walls were pierced for windows
near the roof, and broken up with arches sustained by piers
or by columns. Aisles were added, with pent-house roofs
leaning against the principal walls, and on the occasions
when the clergy swept in procession up the nave to approach
the altar, the congregation shrunk reverentially into the aisles.
The other parts of the Christian basilica were the atrium,
or court of entrance, surrounded by a columnar portico in
semblance of the Court of the Gentiles in front of the
Temple at Jerusalem.


The narthex * or portico, reserved for the catechumens
until they had received baptism, and the penitents until they
had received absolution. In some, as at Sta. Sophia at
Constantinople, there was an outer or exonarthex.
The cancellum, or choir for the singers and inferior clergy,
in which were the ambones or reading desks, found now in
four only of the basilicas at Rome, St. Clement, St. Lorenzo,
Sta. Maria in Cosmedin, Sta. Maria Maggiore.
The crypt, in which was kept the relics of the saint to
whom the church was dedicated, the sacramental utensils,
and ultimately in times of danger the treasures of its
dignitaries.
In the Basilicas the men stood on the right, the women on
the left, as in heathen temples and St. Barnabas in London ;
afterwards a gynceconitis, or women?s choir, was set apart for
the female sex ; and in the cathedrals and abbey churches of
later date was a semi-laic porch, near the western entrance,
called Galilee, where women were allowed to see monks to
whom they were related. When ascertained that it was
proper to concede to them the privilege of an interview, the
attendant addressed the visitor in the words of Scripture:
?He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall you see
him.?f
Two. basilicas have been erected within the last few years,
in close adherence to the ancient form, each a gem in itself;
one, at Munich, has an exterior of plain red brick?inside it
blazes with the choicest marbles.
The other is near Salisbury, built by the late Lord
Herbert, upon which an immense sum of money was ex-
pended:
Leaving Italy for a while, you are invited to return
to the regions of the East, to contemplate the great
architectural achievement of the 6th century.
The Ist Basilica of Sta. Sophia was erected by the
Emperor Constantine, A.D. 526, after he had removed the
seat of government from Rome to Byzantium, and given
that city the name of Constantinople. As we are talking of
* Narthex means the rod of the Greek pedagogue, signifying that the

names let me beg of you not to imagine that Sta. Sophia was
a lady of his family or acquaintance?the title was conferred
on the church because it was dedicated, not to a saint of
the female sex but to the ? Holy Wisdom,? which in the
Greek language is of the feminine gender.
The 2nd, built by Constantine, A.D. 360, who united with
it the contiguous church of Irene or Peace, was burnt, A.D.
404.
The 3rd, built by Theodosius, a.d. 415, was set fire to and
destroyed during the tumults of the blue and green factions,
who in their day did as much mischief as factions of later
times, one of the colours adopted being of a different hue.
Justinian erected the 4th, A.D. 532, which continues to
the present day. Shortly after it was completed it was
injured by a severe shock of earthquake, and since that time
it has suffered much both outside and inside; for buttresses,
props, and excrescences of all kinds, sadly disfiguring the
exterior, have grown up to support it from without, and
on the taking of the city by the Turks, A.D. 1453, it was
converted into a mosque.
Such was the apprehension of the Mahomedan true
believers, lest the presence in a mosque of any representa-
tion of animal form _or created being might cause a relapse
into idolatry, the pictures were cut in pieces, the marble
statues were broken up and calcined into lime, the other
works of art collected with vast labour and expense from all
quarters of the Empire were hewn into fragments, and a
coat of white-wash obliterated the elegance of the frescoes,
and the delicacy of the mosaics; as you may conceive the
gilding was easily disposed of.
For centuries before the time of Justinian, the Roman
architect had done little to vary the form of temples,' the
style of which he imitated?and it was not until a late
period, that the dome borrowed from the East superseded
the simpler arrangement of the Grecian roof.
Justinian* assisted doubtless by the knowledge of his

architect Anthemius, and the oriental draughtsmen, under-
took a task as novel as it was bold?namely, to place at a
height unattempted before, a dome smaller indeed, but flatter,
than that of the Pantheon at Rome. This he flanked by
two semi-domes, whereby the whole unsupported expanse
of the central aisle was made nearly double that of the
Roman Temple ; and by introducing forty windows into
the centre dome, five into each of the semi-domes, and
piercing the side walls with numberless others, he poured
in light, and distributed it for the illumination of his vast
treasures in a mode infinitely better than that used in the
Pantheon, where light is admitted only by one aperture,
an open ring at the apex of the dome. Moreover, he
thus relieved the heaviness of the necessarily ponderous
supports, and threw an air of extreme radiance and
brilliancy over the scene. The dimensions of the church
itself are somewhat unusual, 360 ft. by 229 ft. The dome
rises to a height of 182 ft. above the floor. The narthex or
entrance porch measures 202 ft. by 26 ft.
You all recollect the story of the gruff old miller who
refused to sell to Frederick the Great of Prussia the land on
which stood his wind-mill, an unsightly object close to the
terrace of the Palace of Sans-Souci, Frederick wished to
have it pulled down, but the king, who could conduct the
seven years" war to a glorious conclusion, could not induce
him to part with his inheritance. The old mill stands on
the same spot yet, telling its tale of the unaccommodating
spirit of independence of the ancestor of its present master,
and whirling its arms as indifferent to the contests now
going on between William of Prussia and Francis Joseph of
Austria as to those between Frederick and Maria Theresa
more than a century ago.
You also remember the tale told of the difficulty expe-
rienced in getting rid of the apple-stall, kept at Hyde Park
and was used to drop money amongst the spalls in order to induce the
artizans to linger at their work, until able to pick up the coins
unobserved in the twilight. Can it be possible that the resort to this?
for an emperor be it said, with all deference ?shabby expedient, pro-
duced the fashionable ? Government Stroke,? so cordially approved by
the society for the encouragement of native indolence.


corner, on the site of the old Pillars of Hercules Inn, when
the ground was wanted for purpose of building. History-
repeats itself even in its grotesque incidents, for Justinian
was beset by similar troubles.
Desirous to erect a temple more spacious than either of its
predecessors, he endeavoured to induce the proprietors of
the adjoining land to part with some, so as to afford him a
larger area for his operations.
The first person applied to was a widow lady of rank
named Anna; she declined to part with her estate, even as
she said if offered 50 lbs. weight of gold. As you may
imagine, corner allotments in the neighbourhood of Sta. Sophia
rose thereupon considerably in value, probably to �740 a
foot, at which rate land was sold last month in Bourke-
street. At last the emperor waited upon her in person?
with persuasive eloquence he pressed his suit. The lady,
moved by his condescension, threw herself at his feet,
besought him to accept it as a free gift; the sole stipulation
on her part being that after her death she might be interred
near the sacred edifice.
The next person addressed was named Antiochus, a
wealthy citizen, who had been a doorkeeper. He valued
his property at 50,000 pieces of money. Acts of Parliament
with compulsory arbitration clauses were then unknown ;
but an expedient was suggested by an ingenious courtier,
which produced the desired effect. Aware that this churlish
non-vendor was passionately addicted to horse racing, an
order was obtained and he was cast into prison. For some
time he lay there not daring to murmur or inquire the cause
of his incarceration. The Habeas Corpus Act was not yet
invented. As the time for the annual races approached he
became restless and uneasy, fearing that he would lose the
greatest enjoyment of his life. The subtle courtier then
approached him, insinuating that a concession to the wishes
of the emperor would ensure to him his liberty. He ad-
hered bravely to his resolution until the first day of the
races was over ; but when the Constantinopolitan Leger, or
Derby, was about to come off, the shouts of the people,
cheering the green and blue, &c.?the colours of the rival
jockeys ?penetrated to his cell, he could stand it no longer:


he cried out, ? I will see the races. I will agree to any
terms.?
85 lbs. weight of gold was handed to him, the necessary
deeds were presented for his signature, being attested
by formal witnesses, ?the ministers and all the senate, ?he
was released.
We are not informed further by the historian* whether he
made a fortunate ? book,? or whether he had recourse to the
praetor to be relieved in equity against the instrument so
executed by him under the pressure of duress.
A sturdy cobbler ? Xenophon,? his name also is preserved,
for a long time resisted all overtures. Wearied at last by
repeated applications he made a proposal which, as he
expected, would set the question at rest. He agreed to give
up possession for 14 lbs. of gold, provided that on the day of
the great festival of the annual races he should be placed on
a throne, and receive from the four great factions the same
honours as were paid to the emperor.
To his surprise his terms were accepted ; and on the
appointed day he was clad in robes of ceremony, and led with
great pomp to a throne in front of the Amphitheatre.
However, the populace with one voice declared that they
would not submit to the indignity of beholding such homage,
as was due only to the emperor, paid to this obscure
individual. Some casuist present hit on an expedient by
which the scandal might be avoided, and the promise of the
sovereign literally fulfilled. The throne on which the son of
Crispin sat was wheeled round, and he was turned with his
face to the wall. The ingenious expedient diverted the
spectators, the guards presented arms, and the courtiers
and the factions, with mock solemnitj", made their profound
obeisances to the disappointed and mortified cobbler.
After the final collapse of the Roman power in the West
of Europe, and the interregnum of confusion caused by the
incursions of barbarians from the East and North, fol-
lowed the creation of the Empire of Charlemagne. At his
death occurred the subdivision into separate kingdoms, of
those territories no longer held in subjection by his iron
hand.
* Codinus : ? Script. Byzant.?


For a time the kings of Europe were engaged in
strengthening their dominion over their feudatory vassals
and people, by erecting palaces and fortresses.
The rapacious nobles covered the face of the country
with castles, from which they issued forth at times to
ravage the possessions of the defenceless peasantry.
Meanwhile trade, shunning the paths of danger, left the
regions of the South, and carried on its operations by
caravans from the East, which traversed Russia and Poland,
and found an emporium at Wisby, on the Baltic.
This town on the now neglected Island of Gothland, was
once a grand emporium, at which the annual confluence of
merchants from all parts of Europe must have been con-
siderable.
A judgment as to the wealth of the early inhabitants
may be formed from the cathedral, which, with seventeen
churches (some of the tenth century) still exist, and from
the ruins of more than forty other churches. Rare objects
such as tables of marble, porphyry, jasper, and vases
of the precious metals, which have been found, bear
witness to their luxury.
Their wisdom as legislators is attested by the maritime
code framed there, still known as the Laws of Wisby.
From this, now obscure, seat of trade may be traced the
development of that commercial enterprise which led to the
rise of the Hanseatic Towns, those which sprung up in
Lombardy, the Venetian Territories, and in other countries,
which in due time swelled into prosperous municipalities.
The activity of the burgesses was stimulated by
grants of divers privileges and immunities. The enjoyment
of their riches was secured to them by the concession of
important rights and material guarantees. Associated there
in democratic self-governing bodies, a necessity arose for
suitable buildings in which to transact the business of each
society.
First among these is the Palazzo della Municipalita or the
Palazzo della Ragione, at Padua, built between the years
A.D. 1172 and 1219. It was originally 267 feet in length,
and consisted of three chambers ; but in the year A.D. 1306
an Augustine friar, named Frate Giovanni, who had travelled


much, proposed to remove the subdivisions, and cover the
whole with a stupendous roof unsupported by pillars, on a
plan similar to one which he had seen in a palace in India.
Pleased with the daring novelty of the design, the Paduans
employed him to undertake the work, which he completed,
receiving as remuneration the materials of the old roof.
The vast hall is now 240 feet long, by 86 feet wide, and
80 feet high, the largest of the kind in Europe. The interior
is dull and gloomy, and the exterior is destitute of any
architectural attractions to relieve the monotony.
In the hall are two objects which arrest the attention of
the traveller. One, the monument of the Koman historian
Livy ? w ho was born in the town, and lived at the time of
Augustus, more than 1800 years ago?respecting the authen-
ticity of which the most credulous may be allowed to enter-
tain some doubts. The other, the Lapis Yituperii or Stone
of Disgrace.
To this, dishonest bankrupts were, by a very salu-
tary local custom, haled by their defrauded creditors,
and on it they were enthroned. In one respect, as well as
in others, the ceremony which followed differed from that
which occurs occasionally in Westminster Abbey at the
Coronation ?when the monarch is allowed to seat himself as
gently as is pleasing to his majesty in the chair of Edward
the Confessor, under which is placed the Stone of Scotland,
brought from Scone by Edward 1., A.D. 1297.* For the uncere-
monious creditors seized the delinquent defaulter by the legs
and arms, and bumped him on the penitential pillar with more
or less violence according to the probable amount of dividend
expected to be derived from his assets. After submitting to
this expiation, which absolved him from his debts, and has
given rise to a vernacular proverb, he was discharged.
Vicenza also boasts a similar hall, known by the same
name. The primitive Italian-Gothic exterior, so distasteful
to the genius of that people, has undergone a change vastly

for the better. It was cased by the celebrated Palladio
with a new front of two orders, the Doric below the lonic
above, in what has been considered one of the most happy
of his compositions. Another kind of building differing in
style, called Broletto, and used for the like purposes, is found
in the northern towns of Italy, formerly independent?
Como, Milan, Brescia, Bergamo, Monza, and others, each
possesses one of these. The lower story with open arches
serves the purpose of a market, over which is an upper floor
with usually a spacious hall, in which the political affairs of
the city were transacted.
Commerce exercised in Belgium an active influence, simi-
lar to that already noticed in Italy, and Municipal, Trade,
and Guild Halls sprang up in that country about the same
time ; some bold, elaborate, and tasteful; some overladen
with singular disproportioned and grotesque decoration.
Ghent, Bruges, Liege, Louvain, Mechlin, Mons, Oudenarde,
and other Flemish towns, present numerous Halls of this
class, evidence of the wealth and enterprise of the inhabi-
tants. That of Ghent, if completed, would have exceeded
in size and beauty all existing in that country of Medieval
magnificence, but it remains unfinished.
That at Brussels, began in 1401, finished in 1455, mea-
sures externally 264 ft. by 50 ft. It is of remarkable
character, with a tall graceful steeple and spire, 374 feet
high, one of the most elegant in existence, and with one of
those quaint steep roofs, in which are four tiers of windows
to light a succession of garrets, crowded, in all probability,
in those days with hundreds of poor families.
The narrow limits of the trading towns, confined within
walls to protect the industry of the burghers from the rude
attacks of the idle marauding barons, suggested to the archi-
tect the necessity for raising story over story to economise
space. The sagacious adaptation of the rules of art to
encounter these adverse circumstances produced in several
of these buildings the effect of dignity of style and lightness
and harmony of proportion.
The Cloth Hall of Ypres is still larger than the Town
Hall of Brussels, presenting a fagade of 440 ft., with an im-
posing square tower and belfry in the centre, nearly 300 ft.


high, and a charming pinnacle at each end. It is also of
older date, the foundation was laid in the year 1200,
by the ? pious, chaste and brave ? Baldwin, Count of
Flanders, but not finished until the beginning of the next
century. Baldwin was one of those stalwart Crusaders who
joined the French and Venetians in their attack on Constan-
tinople, led by the Doge of Venice, ?blind old Dandolo,?
then in his 97th year.* Byron alludes to him in ? Childe
Harold?s ? lamentation over fallen Venice, now, ?if our tele-
grams may be relied on, ?no longer true in its application to
that city:?
? The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns :
An emperor tramples where an emperor knelt.
Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces; and chains
Clank over sceptered cities ; nations melt,
From power?s high pinnacle, where they have felt

The city yielded to the power of the combined forces,
and the deposed emperor, Isaac, with his son Alexis, were
placed on the throne. An insurrection ensued, which led to
the assassination of both these princes?to a fresh attack on
and capture of the city. The usurper, named Murz-
uphlus, was hurled from the top of a column 140 feet
high. Baldwin was elected Emperor of the East and, un-
happily for him, he exchanged the humbler and more stable
government of his peaceful subjects for the dangerous attrac-
tions of an imperial crown. Involved in war with the*
Bulgarians, he was taken prisoner, and the historianj* tells us
that having resisted the licentious approaches of the Queen
he was made to suffer a cruel death.

or earthen floors were strewed with rushes. Behind the

supposed to be a corruption of Jersey. The derivation of

f Stowe says that, in the time of Edward VI., there were not above a
dozen milliners in all London. The commodities they dealt in chiefly,
were owches, brooches, aglets, spurs, caps, glasses, &c., wares that came
from beyond the seas, from Italy, from Venice, France, or Spain.


Having thus glanced at the causes which influenced the
growth of Secular Architecture, your attention may be called
to other causes which operated in another direction with
even more striking results.
The remarkable increase of the temporal power of the
Pope, and the vigorous development of the chief monastic
orders about this time, gave a marvellous impetus to the
erection of the great cathedrals, conventual churches, and
religious houses on the continent of Europe. Of these

with fifty others, leap into the recollection before utterance.
In England, the invasion by William I, the confiscation
of the estates of the Saxon nobility, and the profuse endow-
ment of the ecclesiastical bodies, combined to create a new
epoch in the history of Architecture, displacing the
homely Saxon by the ponderous and proud Norman, and
giving the successive transitional gradations of the pointed,*
01 eaily English, florid, or geometrical, and perpendicular
styles.
It is not my intention to dilate on any of the interesting
subjects connected with these stupendous buildings. In
some, in their gradual enlargement during five centuries,
from the Conquest to the Reformation, many portions
distinct in style were inharmoniously mixed.
Como, already mentioned, was?as you who are members

great Guild of Freemasons, and she sent forth in the
11th and 12th centuries organised bodies of workmen
to undertake the erection of those great works which distin-
guished that age. So long as the designing and planning of
them were in the hands of the clergy?the only men of
learning and taste in those rude times?these buildings
reflected the lofty aspirations, the swelling pride and pomp,
or the elevated devotional feelings by which the originators
were animated. But when the great Masonic bodies became
so powerful as to imagine themselves independent of the
guidance and influence of their clerical directors, a change
occurred at once. Admirably skilled to execute the tech-
nical details of their calling, they usurped the planning as
well as the construction of their buildings. The result was
that an historic era is now palpably defined throughout
Europe, by a belt of masonry devoid of taste and the higher
elements of beauty. The buildings of this period were
erected by honest, plain, practical, but ignorant self-
sufficient men, during the time which elapsed between their
having discarded the direction of the refined clergy and
their having surrendered themselves at discretion to the
dominion of regularly educated, enlightened, professional
lay Architects.
Your own experience will supply instances in which a like
assumption by builders, acting in a sphere beyond their
capacity, has entailed on their employers much inconve-
nience and loss, while they themselves have gained neither
in pocket nor in reputation.
You will not, however, refuse to be detained for a short
time to learn the length of these buildings ; an attempt to
give the width is abandoned, for, varying as it does in
different parts by projecting chapels and porches, the state-
ments of different authors cannot be reconciled.
porated like other traders. That they held annual chapters to fix the
rate of their wages, to the subversion of the law and grevous damage of
the commonalty in violation of the Statute of Labourers, is apparent
from the Act 3, Hen. YL, c. 1, which forbids such confederation, and
makes such act felony. Coke?s Inst., 111., 99. Hallam?s Mid. Ages,

measure, be attributed the change of religion in England, and the sup-
pression of monasteries, ?may be ascribed its preservation, and the erec-
tion of Peterborough, with Oxford, Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, and West-
minster into bishopricks. No more queenly sanctuary could be found,
and in no respect could Her Majesty?s dying injunction have been more
suitably complied with.

Amsterdam is of similar shape, the same mode of construc-
tion as you may remark has been adopted for our Hall.
Owing to the strictness of the ?Reviewers? at the
time of the Reformation, and in the reign of Queen Eliza-
beth, also to the sternness of Cromwell?s round-head soldiery,
many of these cathedrals have been sadly desecrated and
despoiled of some of their fairest decorations. The praise-
worthy liberal-mindedness of the present day is engaged
in making amends for the follies, the crimes, the neglect,
of the past. The work of restoration goes on well.
Let me here venture to assert, even at the risk of offend-
ing those purists who contend for the pre-eminence of the
ancient Greek orders, that the architecture of this period
appears to me far more surprising and agreeable than they
are. The beetling tower, the spire rearing its flame-like
point on high, the arches of every degree of curvature, the
flying buttresses ?features unknown to the formality of
Greece or Rome ?impart to Gothic buildings an air of
grandeur and of stateliness not achieved by them. The
transmission of light through tall graceful windows, their
delicately-involved tracery embellished with glass of
curiously-toned colour?and its diffusion in mellowed rays,
through aisles, the arched and groined roofs of which,
enriched with pendants and bosses, were supported by
columns and vaulting shafts of every form, simple and
composite, give to them a wondrous superiority over the
ancient forms.
In the interior of those where regularity consistently pre-
vailed, perspectives so diverse, vistas at once so complicated
yet so simple, could not exist. In consequence of the large-
ness of their component parts they may have deceived the
eye by appearing smaller than they actually were ; while in
the cathedrals the deception is of the opposite kind ; for the
smallness of the members, and frequent repetition of them,
delay the eye while taking in the scene, whereby the
interiors are magnified apparently beyond their real dimen-
sions. In many of those, as the Pantheon, a cold or dazzling
glare would occur ; no such floods of light and masses of shade
would be attained. In sculpture and colouring they certainly
could not have been exceeded; nevertheless, in the cathedrals


the countless modifications of ornament, carving, chasing,
monumental sculpture, mural tablets, armorial achievements,
emblazonments, and other accessories, combine to produce a
gorgeous aggregate not permitted, according to the rules
of severe simplicity, by which the Greeks bound themselves.
To some, at least, of these sacred fanes most, if not all, of
you have been visitors. You must on such occasions have
been imbued with feelings of amazement and reverence, and
could not have departed without admiration of your ances-
tors?workmen like all of us ?whose high privilege it was
to be engaged in their generation on such enduring monu-
ments of the national taste, skill, and religious enthusiasm.
You must, therefore, recognise the force of the poet?s
words when designating them as places conducing to evoke
the holiest sentiments, he says?
But let my due feet never fail
To walk the studious cloyster?s pale,
And love the high embowed roof,
With antick pillars massy proof,
And storied windows richly dight,
Casting a dim religious light;
There let the pealing organ blow,
To the full voic?d quire below,
In service high and anthems clear,
As may, with sweetness, through mine ear
Dissolve me into ecstasies,
And bring all Heav?n before mine eyes.
II Penseroso.
Let me, also, at the hazard of arousing the indignation of
our own highly intelligent body of Architects whose
resentment is most respectfully deprecated?express my
regret that, with such models before them, the ecclesiastical
architecture of Victoria is not allowed to exhibit more
becoming examples of their ability.
The enterprising town of Ballarat may boast of two,
amongst its numerous churches, which reflect credit on the
professional education of the designers?who they are is to
me unknown ?as well as on the liberality of the con-
gregations.
But what is to be said for our capital, with its 120,000
inhabitants, so provided with houses of worship as it is. It


cannot be affirmed that there are many possessing any
architectural pretensions. True it is the great cathedral
of the Roman Catholic body is conceived in a spirit which
raises expectations that when finished it may accord in
lordliness of style with not a few of the edifices enumerated
above.
But what must not the candid and impartial admirer of
the art of architecture admit on behalf of the rest.
Martin Luther said he ? had no idea of allowing the Devil
to have all the good music to himself/? and he insisted on
his followers cultivating the art to the honour and glory of
God, ?in humble deference then to the good sense, as well
as true piety of this reflection, may we not ask why are all
the pains to be lavished on the secular architecture of
Mammon ? Cannot the talent which furnishes such
respectable designs for buildings, public and private?
worthy of a place in any city in Europe?be equally fertile
in resources to dignify those intended for loftier and more
serious purposes than the despatch of business and the
acquisition of wealth ? No answer will be more ready, and
none less satisfactory, than that the genius of our architects
is fettered by the limited funds at their disposal. A truthful
adherence to the rules of proportion, and a dexterous
application of the principles of construction, would enable
them, surely, to produce for the same amount something
more becoming.
Prayers offered up with an humble, lowly, and contrite
heart, may be acceptable in whatsoever species of building
the penitent sinner may be ; nevertheless, the adoration of
Nature?s Great Architect cannot be the less acceptable if
reverently tendered in something somewhat better than a
barn-like structure of bluestone or red brick disfigured by a
lean ill-featured imitation of the portico of a heathen temple,
or some other costly as well as inappropriate unsightly
adjunct in front.
And it appears to be an uncomplimentary depreciation of
their abilities ?disclaimed altogether on my part ?to assume
that our Architects are unequal to cope with difficulties,
triumphed over centuries ago, in favour of the indigent
villagers of the poorest parts of Europe.


Take, for example, what has been done within the last
few years at the obscure hamlet of Mousta, in the island of
Malta. A new church was required, and after long debate
between the pastor and the parishioners, it was resolved to
copy the Pantheon of Rome. The chief reason which induced
these artless people to adopt the plan and overlook all the
attendant difficulties was, that the new church might be
erected around and over the old church of their forefathers,
in which they might continue their devotions until the new
edifice could be consecrated.
To an architect named Grognet the merit of the suggestion
is attributed, but the real hero of the piece is the village
mason, who can neither read, write, nor draw?and a brave
workman is Master Angelo Gatt. For twenty years he
toiled at wages of fifteen pence a day, in directing his
neighbours, the majority of whom contributed their labour
gratuitously. In consequence of the deficiencies of his
education he was compelled to accept ornamental details,
selected for him from books by other persons, not always
with the most correct judgment, yet his name deserves to be
held in remembrance throughout all time.
You are, doubtless, aware that in India some of the
domes* were formed on moulds of earth, piled up inside the
building as it progressed ; on this the arch was laid, and
after a proceeding, of which the beaver or the bee would be
ashamed, the key-stone was set. The earth was then
removed from the interior in little baskets, holding about a
couple of shovelfuls, borne on the heads of the slender
labourers.
This primitive substitution for centreing was used near
Bombay, in the erection of a mausoleum for a native prince
(as it was told to me), so late as the year 1862. The domes
of Europe, when not of stone, are in most instances formed
of shell within shell, held together by massive bands of metal
put up by workmen on stages, supported from below or
suspended from above.
* This of course does not apply to the Jain cupolas, not strictly
domical in form, constructed with large flat stones placed in horizontal
layers, supported by struts, and propped by numerous pillars.


But brave Angelo Gatt was not to be daunted, albeit his
dome is 16 feet larger than the cupola of St. Paul?s in
London.
He struck out a new line for himself, and following the
promptings of his natural constructive genius he completed
his dome without help of a scaffold. Exercising his own
intuitive acuteness he made a discovery which would have
added lustre to the renown of Michael Angelo Buonarotti or
Christopher Wren, and by simply notching each course of
stone into that below he accomplished the astonishing feat.
The work being finished the old church was taken to
pieces and carried away within a week, and the simple
rustics assembled on the fallowing Sunday in a temple
resembling in size, and ?notwithstanding apparent mistakes
of detail in ornament ?in some respects positively handsomer
than that which was the pride of the Consul Agrippa, the
glory of the Augustan age.
It was my good fortune to visit this church in the after-
noon of the Saturday preceding Christmas-day.
While admiring the interior ?well adapted for the Roman
Catholic worship, not necessary congregational, an arrange-
ment which breaks up agreeably with shrines and altars the
monotony of the great Rotunda?a rustling sound was heard.
Unattended by an individual of the other sex, a band of
women, exceeding 800, trooped in. All were clad in black
silk, ?the holiday attire of the poorest female in the island, ?
with fal-lals or hoods worn after the inexplicable fashion of
the Maltese ladies. A few moments having been spent in
silent supplication, they all knelt, and raised their voices
with one accord in a hymn of thanksgiving and praise. The
effect was sublime. Probably many an humble and warm
prayer was offered up that day for honest Angelo Gatt. He
had my good wishes; let me hope he has yours also.
To return from this digression, let me resume by leading
you to the first great Hall of Westminster, 276 feet long, with
two rows of columns down the centre ; it was built by
William 11, a.d. 1197, on the site of the palace of the early
Saxon kings.
When remonstrances were humbly tendered to his majesty


on account of the heavy burdens and oppression of his sub-
jects consequent on his having undertaken the enclosing of
the Tower of London, the building of London Bridge, and
this great Hall, he declared roundly that he meant this Hall
only for his bedchamber, and would straightway build
another larger and grander still. Possibly the hasty con-
struction caused it to be not as truthfully built as it should
have been; for it appears to have required frequent expensive
repairs effected by Thomas A?Beckett, King Jolm, and Henry
111., before it was destroyed by fire.
King Richard IT., A.D. 1397, erected that now standing?
though it is not unusual to hear it called erroneously the
Hall of Rufus ?its length is 238 feet, breadth 68 feet, height
86.
Although sadly disfigured externally by the courts of law
built up against one side, in a totally dissimilar style of
architecture, the interior is highly imposing ; in fact, no more
ornamental roof of wood-work on such a scale has been
attempted iu Europe, and no more august approach to the
Houses of Parliament could well have been devised. So the
adjustment to it of the corridors which lead to the different
parts of them must be esteemed a most happy conception.*
Shortly before Richard commenced this Hall, he had caused
the Royal Pajace of Sheen, in Richmond Park, which con-
tained a fine hall also, to be pulled down, because of his
excessive grief for the loss of his wife, the good Queen Anne
of Luxembourg, who had died there.-f*
Guild Hall, in London, from its antiquity, its beauty, and
the numerous curious and affecting incidents connected with
its history, is deserving of consideration as next in dignity
and importance. The erection of it followed close on the
completion of Westminster Hall, for the foundation was laid
* We are told by an old chronicler, that ? This marvailous work was
made with great costs, all which the king levied on strangers banished,
or flying out of their countries, who obtained license to remain in this
land by the king?s charters, which they had purchased with great sums
of money. ?John Botterell being then clerk of the works.?
f To her majesty is attributed the introduction into England of the
custom of riding on a side-saddle, for which the ladies ought to hold
her memory in grateful recollection.


A.D. 1411.* In this noble apartment the municipal authorities
have dispensed their splendid civic hospitalities to every
king of England from the time of Henry V., as also to many
foreign potentates, and many illustrious personages of all
countries.
In it have been also held several important state trials, the
enumeration of which would not entertain you much.
In it, A.D. 1 421, the formation of a library was begun by
that most worthy Lord Mayor, whose biography and that of
his cat are well known by your children, Sir Richard (turn
again) Whittington, in whose favour the chimes of Bow
Bell rung out that he should be ?thrice Lord Mayor of
London.?
It is asserted that the Duke of Somerset borrowed the
books, and insinuated that His Grace forgot to return them.
Probably it is owing to this inauspicious commencement that
the progress of this library has not been greater ; for we find
that, although it has received an acquisition of books formerly
in the Dutch Church at Austin Friars, the number accumulated
within 450 years does not exceed 30,000 volumes: the
number our library collected within thirteen years is close on
45,000.
Guild Hall is in length only 150 feet, it is divided into
eight bays.
The historical treatment of my subject obliges me to take
you back for the third time to Italy, in order to refer you to
St. Peter?s, at Borne. In size this Basilica exceeds that of any
building of the kind raised by the hand of man ; for it is
unfair to institute a comparison between the vast, roofless
temples of Egypt, or the straggling, irregular buildings of
other countries, and this consummate production of genius
and courage.
* The chronicler informs us that towards the building the companies
gave great benevolencies; also offences of men were pardoned for sums
of money towards this work, and extraordinary fines, amerciments, and
other things during seven years, and a continuation thereof of three
years more ; all to be employed in this building. You will, doubtless,
be gratified by the assurance, that no such expedients as those last
mentioned have been resorted to by the trustees, to enable them thus
to erect this Hall.


The construction occupied a period of 828 years, between
the reigns of Pope Nicholas Y, A.D. 1447, and Pope Pius
VI., a.d. 1775. A description of its magnificence, of its
contents, and of the countless objects of interest, in, and con-
nected with it, would occupy many a summer?s day ; so let
us pass to the Pantheon ?a contrast between its dome and
that of St. Sophia, at Constantinople, which it exceeds in
size by 33 feet, has been already drawn.
You have now to witness the verification of the not idle
vaunt of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, that he would ? hang
the dome of the Pantheon in the clouds.?
The diameter of the lower concave is 139 feet, still 3 feet
less than that of the Pantheon ; but its height from the
pavement to the summit of the lantern cupola, which sur-
mounts the dome is 448 feet. You require some standard
of mensuration, by which to adjust the eye of your mind to
such Brobdignag proportions ?such is furnished in the
spacious nave, on the floor of which is inscribed the relative
length of other churches, in which other countries pride
themselves.
St. Peter?s measures in length ... ... ... 613 feet.
St. Paul?s, in London ? ... ... ... 518 ?

St. Paul?s without the walls at Rome ... ... 419 ?
Sta. Sophia ? ... ... .... 360 ?
You will not have forgotten the length of
Winchester ... ... ... ... ... 560 ?
So that, as you see, the stupendous Roman Basilica is 53
feet longer than the largest cathedral in England.
It is of this that Byron says :
? But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
Standest alone, with nothing like to thee ?
Worthiest of God, the holy and the true.
Since Zion?s desolation, when that He
Forsook his former city, what could be,

Childe Harold?s Pilgrimage, Canto iv. 154.
You see from the representation on the canvas that in
front of St. Peter?s are two magnificent fountains, between


and in front of which is an obelisk,* one of those mysterious
monuments of which the Egyptians were the inventors.
This ?big stone,? 132 feet high (it is nothing more in
fact, as it has no hieroglyphics or writing on it to tell its
origin or purpose), was brought, A.D. 40, by the Emperor
Caligula from Heliopolis in Egypt, the same as the city of
Onj* mentioned in Scripture. It was placed in the forum of
Nero, not far from its present site, and remained in that
position for more than 1,500 years, until the architect Fontana
was ordered by Pope Sixtus Y., A.D. 1586, to remove it to
where it now stands.
Having made his calculations, and prepared his apparatus,
the architect summoned to his assistance 900 picked labourers
to man his capstans, and marched at their head into St.
Peter?s, where the whole body devoutly attended a special
mass and confessed their sins.
They then took their stations at the bars, and at the sound
of a trumpet they swayed away merrily for several hours.
You may well imagine the phases of distrust, doubt,
anxiety, and hope, which agitated the minds of the
spectators, and the final burst of joy when a gun from the
Castle of St. Angelo announced that the united efforts of the
labourers had raised the enormous stone from its bed. Then
the bells rang out from every church in the eternal city.
Fontana, amidst exulting shouts, is borne in triumph round
the scene of his daring and successful achievement.
For five months the obelisk remained suspended in air,
until further necessary arrangements having been completed,
the labourers were summoned a second time.
They submitted themselves to a repetition of the religious
ceremonies, and then set themselves earnestly to the work.
The great stone was gently lowered from the perpendicu-
lar to one of its sides on to rollers, the stout battalion of
900 papal ?navvies,? a?ded by 140 horses, transported it to its
* Some suppose that it was made to a Roman order, and as the sacred
writing of the priests was not understood by the Romans, hieroglyphics
were omitted. Of the eleven obelisks at Rome, three, viz., that in
question, that in front of the church of St. Maria Maggiore, and that on
the Monte Cavallo, are plain,

Showing that the Hall of the Melbourne Public Library and
Museum, built in the 29th year of the existence of the City
of Melbourne, may exceed in size that of the ancient City of
Westminster by 50,000 feet.
In addition to this, you see two wings connecting this
hall with the front of the Library ; each of these measures
230 feet, and when raised to the contemplated height of
three stories, is capable of holding an accumulation of
treasures of which Victoria may, and doubtless will, make a
profitable and a wise use. ?
The rotunda of the grand staircase, which will be, when
finished, probably as handsome as any yet built, not except-
ing the Scala Regia of the Vatican, measures in diameter 71
feet. It exceeds, therefore, by six feet the great dome of the
Pantheon in Paris, one of the most striking objects in
that delightful capital, and is as large as the dome of the
Cathedral of St. Isaac?s in St. Petersburgh?that city of giants
?where everything is on a scale of surpassing splendour ; a
church whose monolithic columns of rose-coloured gianite
are 56 feet high, nine feet higher than those of the original
Pantheon, to which reference has been so often made as one
of the noblest monuments of ancient Rome.
This then, surely is a hall worthy of the objects for which
it was designed, well suited to the graceful sociabilities
which will usher in the approaching great act of inter-
colonial hospitality for which it is intended and for the
reception, on the close of the Exhibition, of the works o
nature, science, and art to which it is to be devoted.
Surely we' ought to acknowledge with gratitude (winch,
according to a distinguished diplomatist, means a lively sense
of future favors) the enlightened statesmanship of our rulers,
and the judicious liberality of our who have
generously and wisely combined to convert into inde-
structible capital, such as the Melbourne Public Library and


Museum, sums small in themselves taken from the revenue
during a few years, without impairing in the smallest degree
the efficiency of the public service, or creating one shilling
of debt.
Here it may be most appropriate for you to take a promi-
nent part in greeting with a hearty welcome our fellow-
labourers in the cause of mutual improvement on which we
have entered.
There are many modes in which you may support, many
in which you can further the general object of the Exhibi-
tion.
A series of Lectures by ablb men, explaining what invites
attention?and what so humble as not to deserve notice ?will
be given. Your attendance at them will evince .your desire
to keep pace with the rapidly advancing strides of know-
ledge.
But let us not concentrate all our thought upon ourselves.
Why should not our different guilds invite bands of their
brethren of their respective trades to come from the adjoin-
ing colonies to visit us during the Exhibition ? To exchange
ideas respecting the objects of interest common to all of us,
to explain practically in language which workmen under-
stand better than Presidents, Commissioners, or Professional
Lecturers can do, the excellencies or defects of the different
materials on which they have to labour ?to impart a know-
ledge of commodities which may become of immediate
exchangeable value. But above all to break down the
parochial little-mindedness, which, transplanted into these
colonies, exaggerates itself into the contemptible form of
colonial jealousy. You may have already anticipated the
idea, if so, let me trust that you will carry it out with the
like vigour and the like success you have displayed here.
And now a word about yourselves, for in addressing you
the lines of Swift admonish me ; he says :
As when a lofty pile is rais?d,
We never hear the workmen prais?d
Who bring the lime or place the stones,
But all admire Inigo Jones.?
It is gratifying to be able to say, that this, which may without
ostentation be justly called the successful commencement of


a great work, has, much to the credit of the active con-
tractors, been finished within the contract time, and happily
without an accident of any kind.
The highest commendation which need be given as to the
excellence of the workmanship is, that it has satisfied the
Architect, whose duty it has been to certify to the Trustees
that it is equal to that required by the specification.
The durability of the permanent portions of the structure
will bear witness to your labour, it may be hoped, for
centuries to come.
But other steps will be taken to record the services you
have rendered to your country. A roll of the names of the
men employed is prepared, classified according to their
respective trades, showing the rates of wages paid to them,
the cost of materials, and of provisions, tools, clothing,
house-rent, and other particulars, during the first six months
of this year. To this the contract, transcribed in illuminated
writing, will be prefixed. Every man employed will be
invited to sign the roll; and let me take upon myself to
predict that it will be not the least attractive object at our
approaching Exhibition.
You are too sensible and too independent, my good friends,
to be imposed upon by the clap-trap nonsense which it is the
fashion to deal in respecting the ? dignity of labour ; ? and
you know full well that all the glory is not to be
monopolised by the robust possessor of the ? horny hand.??
Ready and willing you doubtless will be to concede that the
man of thought and of action in his sphere deserves some
consideration also?be he as robust as you are, or be he the
man of slender frame, the man of the sallow cheek, the
hollow eye, the toil wrought brain, the sensitive organisation
strained by works as useful materially, and higher in
the scale of social utility than the erection of the proudest
temple yet built, ?he also is entitled to his share of honour
for his work in his vocation. Yet, without disparaging the
merit of the one, or attempting to mislead by attaching
undue importance to the other, it strikes me as likely that
some of you will look in after years with satisfaction on
that Roll, and that your descendants may feel a not unworthy


pride in the recollection that you in your day assisted to
build this Hall.
Concluding with an earnest hope that before long you
may be called together to complete the building so
auspiciously begun, that it may be my privilege to address
my congratulations to you at no distant day, and bidding
you farewell for the present, let me invite you to make the
new roof reverberate again and again with three lusty loyal
cheers for Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen.
