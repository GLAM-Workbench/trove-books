PREFACE.
At the solicitation of several Gentlemen interested
in Lord Howe Island, the writer has decided on pub-
lishing these articles in pamphlet form.
The issues of the July and August numbers of the
Illustrated Sydney News (in which they originally
appeared) being exhausted, he is indebted to the
proprietors of that journal for the readiness with
which they have permitted him to reprint in the
present form.

fii MADEIRA OP THE: PACIFIC.
Perhaps not one in a hundred of the busy toilers of
Sydney could point on the map to the island to which
has been given the name of Lord Howe, and certainly
not one in a thousand has the slightest conception of
the varied beauties and attractions of this Paradise of
Palms !
It is true there have been several ? Official Reports ?
published from time to time by the Government of
New South Wales, but these have usually been apropos
of some special project connected with the island, and
have been furnished by gentlemen who have had but
the slightest opportunities of becoming acquainted with
the daily life of the islanders, and but the slenderest
means of knowing the resources, products, and capa-
bilities of the soil, climate, and surrounding waters.
Indeed, the only* two Reports which have appeared
were one in 1852, when it was proposed to make Lord
Howe Island a penal settlement for criminals from the
Australian group of colonies ; and one in 1869, when it
was visited by Mr. Cloete, the magistrate of the Sydney
Water Police, to inquire into the circumstances of an
alleged murder on the island. The former mentioned
of these Reports dealt almost exclusively with matters
relating to the suitability of the place for penal pur-
poses ; and the Report by Mr. Cloete, which was ably
edited by Mr. E. S. Hill, and contributed to by Mr.
Moore, of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, and by Mr.
R. D. Fitzgerald, of the Survey Department of New
* Since this was written a series of articles have been published by
the Government relative to the Botany, Geology, and other features of
Lord Howe.


South Wales, who accompanied the expedition, was
necessarily but a brief and very imperfect one, owing
to the visit only extending to four days. This Report
is, however, a very valuable and suggestive one, but it
has long since shared the fate of official documents,
and is practically lost to the people of the present day,
or could only be found by a close search in the waste
paper department of the Government Printing Office.
Referring again to the circumstances under which
the Report of Captain Denham was made, it is a very
remarkable fact that nearly all these beautiful lands of
the South have had their attractions and capabilities
made known to the world through the efforts made by
Great Britain and other countries to meet the pressure
of the criminal classes for a secure and suitable domi-
cile while undergoing their allotted terms of impri-
sonment. It was this incentive to enterprise which
led, if not to the discovery, certainly to the early settle-
ment of New South Wales. It was to this the beautiful
Island of Tasmania owed its development. Victoria
only escaped being made a penal establishment, first by
the blunder of Captain Collins, who could not discover
water, in 1804 ; and secondly in 1850, by the almost
open rebellion of the colonists against the British
Government. The horrors of the penal period on Nor-
folk Island are a matter of history. To Dr. Lang
Queensland is mainly indebted for its exemption. Pro-
bably, if Great Britain had taken possession of New
Caledonia, when she was so urged by the Australian
Colonists, that island would have been made a recep-
tacle for her criminal classes, just as the French have
since made it for theirs. Indeed, it would seem that
the modern system of dealing with the more hardened
offenders against the capital clauses of the decalogue is
to have the choicest spots on God?s earth allotted to
their special use and service.
Well, Lord Howe Island escaped such a fate by the
merest chance. Taking the Report of 1852, as ordered
by the Council to be printed, everything. seemed favour-
able and in train for this Madeira of the South
becoming a second Norfolk Island or Port Arthur, or,
as Governor Latrobe expressed it in the official corres-


pondence, ? A place to which Victoria and New
South Wales might send their worst class of criminals
(short of those whom it might be absolutely necessary to
hang) to expiate their crime as transports.? ?I am
sure,? adds he, ? that such provision is both wise and
necessary ***** and lam exceedingly
anxious to effect some such arrangements without loss of
time,? &c., &c. These favourable Reports were duly
embodied in a minute of the Executive Council of New
South Wales, and forwarded to the Duke of Newcastle,
the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, with a
prayer that the colonies might be allowed to appro-
priate Lord Howe Island to the purposes suggested,
was due to the foresight and wisdom of the Duke of
Newcastle that the project was nipped in the bud and
abandoned. That statesman informed the petitioning
Governments that, so far from adding to the number
of criminal islets of the Pacific, Great Britain contem-
plated reducing them ; and that, in carrying out the
Government plan, the penal establishment of Norfolk
Island would be broken up, and that not only was this
step decided upon in the interest of economy, but that
a more efficient and salutary discipline and training
might be carried out under more adequate official
supervision. This was at the time deemed a great
?snub? to politicians in the colonies, but subsequent
events have proved the correctness of the views of
the English statesman.
Lord Howe Island is about 400 miles (or two days?
steaming) from Sydney, and within 300 miles from
Port Macquarie, which may be regarded as the nearest
point of the mainland to the island. Its exact geo-
graphical position is, latitude 31� 31" S., longitude
159� 5" E. On a clear day its highest mountain,
Mount Gower, which rises to a height of nearly 3,000
feet, may be clearly seen 90 miles off, and those of less
elevation may be plainly traced as the island is
approached. In shape it is a crescent of irregular out-
line its southern point being the abrupt mountain
referred to, while its northern is a steep rugged decli-
vity known as ?North Head,? but marked on the
charts as Point Phillip. Studding its crescent-shaped


face are well-timbered, regular rising hills, and several
rough mountain rises of high elevation especially
rugged on their sea-frontages. These are, on the
south, Mount Gower ; Mount Lidgbird, scarcely second
in grandeur to Mount Gower ; and Mount Armstrong,
a well-timbered undulating rise. On the north, Mount
Phillip, North Head; Mount Eliza, resembling a divided
cone with a peaked top ; Mount Poole ; and several
lesser mountains, well-timbered, but too rugged and
stony for cultivation.
As the island is approached from the South there are
several imposing and most picturesque features : one of
these is a pyramidal rock, with a dome-like top, tower-
ing to a height of nearly 2,000 feet, and varying greatly
in aspect as it is approached from different points.
Viewed from the west in sunshine it presents the ap-
pearance of a massive golden spire ; while, seen from
the north-east, it resembles greatly the dome of the
Pantheon in Paris. This is known as Ball?s Pyramid,
after its discoverer, Lieutenant Ball, who sighted it
when on his way to Norfolk Island. On the north a
group of Islands known as the ? Admiralties,? are
extremely interesting and well worthy a visit by our
Australian artists, who may find hereabouts lots of
magnificent scenery, highly characteristic of the
region. On the east of the island is a rocky, inacces-
sible islet known as Mutton Bird Island. All these
islands are the resort of countless numbers of sea-
birds, and in the breeding season millions of their eggs
may be obtained. The gannet, wide-awake, whale-
bird, mutton-bird, boatswain-bird, gull, and many other
sea birds favour this locality, and the abundance of
fish in the surrounding waters tempts them to make it
their breeding-ground. Some idea may be formed
of the flocks of the dusky mutton-bird when it is
mentioned that a party of five visited one island three
days during this last season and obtained in a few
hours 600 dozen of the eggs. These birds lay regu-
larly within a week of the 28th November, and the
islanders make a point of clearing the nests every
other day during this week in order to get perfectly
fresh eggs. Certainly not a tithe of the eggs are


obtained, as many of the islands are too difficult to
scale, or altogether inaccessible. The eggs are per-
fectly sweet, and not the slightest unpleasant flavour
or odour can be detected. They answer just as well as
duck?s or hen?s eggs for all purposes to which those
are employed, the only difference being that the albu-
minous portion is slightly in excess in the eggs of the
mutton-bird. In view of this perhaps they might be very
profitably employed for albuminizing paper for photo-
graphic and other purposes, while the yolks might be
used up in the numberless ways in which this most useful
and nutritious boon is employed. Indeed, from the
enormous numbers of these eggs which yearly go to
waste, it seems a pity that in these days of meat con-
serving no means can be adopted of securing and pre-
serving them for export, so as to bring such nutri-
tious diet to the doors of the many scantily-fed popu-
lations in various parts of the world.
One of the chief products of the soil to which the
attention of the islanders is devoted is that of growing
the onions which have so good a name in the Australian
markets. Fully nine-tenths of the land under culti-
vation is occupied with this crop, which at all times
commands the highest price owing to the excellent
keeping qualities of the esculent. The seed is sown
thickly in beds about the month of July, and the
young plants, when sufficiently large to handle, are
transplanted from three to four inches apart in long
narrow strips or beds. Some idea may be formed of
the labour attending this process when it is mentioned
that no fewer than 144 plants are made to occupy
every superficial yard. A single plantation of less than
two-thirds of an acre was estimated to contain 286,000
plants. The beds are reduced to a fine surface, and
the operator holding a bunch of the young plants in
one hand with the other presses the bulb firmly in the
ground to the depth of about an inch. The months of
August, September, and October, are occupied by this
labourious and back-aching process, and in weeding
from time to time. As may be imagined this thick
crowding of the plants results in small bulbs, even in
a moist and favourable season, but if this should prove


a very dry one the produce rarely reaches above the size
of a walnut. The greatly enhanced price of these
?picklers,? however, offers some compensation for the
reduced crop ; but there can be no doubt that the
system of over-crowding is the reverse of economical
in every way. It is not on record how the islanders
first came to realize the special suitability of the soil
and climate for the onion, or how the public discovered
its peculiar excellence, but there can be no doubt that
it is owing to the high percentage of phosphates in the
land that the bulb finds its special pabulum, and in its
slow, dry growth it gets the firmness and solidity so
much lacking in bulbs grown rapidly by gross manur-
ing and excessive moisture. Another product of the
island is the plantain and banana, which are grown
extensively and are yearly being added to. The prox-
imity of the Sydney market (within two days? steaming),
the great excellence of the fruit, and the little labour
attending its culture, seem to point unmistakably to
the banana as likely to play a most important part in
the future of the island.
The sweet potato is also a favourite product here, as
also is the ordinary potato, which is called on the island
the ? Irish potato,? to distinguish it from its tropical
namesake ; and the maize, or Indian corn, gives a good
return. The lemon grows luxuriantly and forms a
fence through which a buffalo could scarcely break.
Nearly all the trees are seedlings, from some half-wild
introduced variety ; the fruit is large, with a loose
rind, and the pulp is less acidulous than the Lisbon
and common lemon. Taken with a little sugar the
fruit is very agreeable, but it is commonly eaten
alone, and it is quite the custom when going on excur-
sions, and with workmen going to their daily toil, to
take a bag of lemons to eat during the day to allay
thirst. The trees are spreading all around the culti-
vated patches, and the seeds taken by the birds or
dropped casually about the bush usually germinate.
It?s questionable whether the lemon, as here grown, has
any or much commercial value, but as indicating the
suitability of the place for the extensive growth of the
cultivated varieties of the orange family generally it is


very suggestive. Indeed, the few orange ti'ees that
have been planted have thriven with a vigour and
healthiness quite phenomenal. The large and delicious
orange of Tahiti, the mandarins, and other well-known
varieties, grow luxuriantly and bear profusely.
Other plants and trees of economic value have been
tested, and with varying success ; some of these are
more or less grown for the, crop, while others have
scarcely reached beyond the experimental stage. All
the varieties of culinary vegetables commonly known
grow well, while others of semi-tropical climes yield
abundantly. The yam, arrowroot, and taro, of the
South Pacific, find a favourable home here ; the custard
apple, loquat, ?mummy? or papaw apple, kei apple
(akebia), Brazilian cherry, coffee, granadilla, guavas,
pomegranate, succeed admirably. The more generally
grown fruits, such as peaches, nectarines, mulberries,
tomatoes, grapes, passion fruit, Cape gooseberry, figs,
melons, cucumbers, revel in the rich soils and favouring
climate, and grow almost wild. Indeed, the peach
grows so readily that no pains are taken to introduce
and propagate the best dessert varieties, and at present
the fruit is very small and inferior, though well suited
for preserving and for stewing.
The apple," pear, plum, raspberry, strawberry, goose-
berry, currant, and other fruits of cool latitudes, are
said not to find the climate favourable, but from obser-
vation one is led to the conclusion that no adequate
trial has been made with any range of varieties. It is
well-known how capricious many kinds of plants yielding
those fruits are as to the conditions suiting them, and
there are doubtless many well-known sorts which would
find in Howe Island all they require for their healthy
and productive growth. In considering the suitability
of any place for the growth of a given plant nothing
short of actual experiment, and this intelligently con-
ducted, can be conclusive. Fortunately in Captain
Armstrong, the Resident Magistrate and Administrator
of the Island?s affairs, the Government of New South
Wales have one who is exactly fitted for developing
to the utmost the resources and capabilities of the
region. Many most interesting experiments in the


way of introducing exotic plants and personally testing
their probable value, are in course, and no opportunity
is lost by this gentleman in adding to their number.
The visitor could not spend a day more profitably or
with greater pleasure than in accompanying Captain
Armstrong and inspecting the progress of these experi-
ments.
The island seems to offer peculiarly favourable condi-
tions and affords good promise for the more extensive
growth of tobacco, coffee, mango, custard apple, orange,
ginger, liquorice, lechee, longan, olive, pine-apple,wam-
pee, and many other little grown sub-tropical plants,
giving fruit or other products of exceptional value in the
markets of the large Australian towns. But as yet no ade-
quate trial has been made of the varied resources offered
by the soil and climate of Lord Howe Island. The
rapid growth of the coffee plant, its early fertility and
abundant yield, as attested by the few trees planted,
point to this crop as one likely to be of great com-
mercial importance to the island. As reported on at
the late Exhibition the coffee grown on Lord Howe
Island is equal to the very best samples from Ceylon
and other favoured coffee growing countries.
Mention has been made of the fertility of the soil
and the suitability of its climate for the cultivation of
every vegetable product of temperate zones, it but
remains to notice here the genial character of the place
as far as the human constitution is concerned. The
winter is much milder than that of New South Wales
and of her southern neighbours ; frosts are unknown,
the temperature rarely falling below 48�. The range
of summer temperature is from 60 to 80� ; a few days
of exceptional heat brought the thermometer to 106�
in the sun. Occasionally northerly winds prevail, and
these are rather trying and enervating during the day.
The evenings are always cool, and never interfere with
perfect repose. The people are healthy, their simple life
and plain wholesome diet tending to keep away many of
the ills it is customary to say ? flesh is heir to in large
towns ?, Droughts are rare, rain usually falling copiously
at intervals of a week or fortnight ; to be a month
without rain is quite a noticeable event on the island.


Most of the houses are huilt of wood and thatched
with palm leaves within the coast belt of timber, and
this, with the profusion of palms in every stage of
giowth, affords secure shelter against the severe winds
from the south-west which are at times experienced.
Sickness is almost unknown, and the usual ailments are
treated successfully without the aid of a doctor of any
kind. No such a thing as scarlet fever, small-pox, or
other zymotic disease, except measles, which some
years ago was introduced by a passing ship, has been
known, and the presence of rheumatism is only to be
attributed to indiscreet exposure while working during
wet weather, and the entire neglect of any precaution to
ward off colds and their complicated consequences.
There is no snake or other venomous reptile, or
beast or bird of prey ; not a rat has been seen, but
mice were by accident introduced some years ago, and
have increased a good deal. That pest of town and
country life in the colonies, the house-fly, is almost
unknown on the island ; but nature, in establishing
that beautiful equilibrium which philosophers are so
eloquent upon, has here made up in fleas for any defi-
ciency in flies. The common blow-fly is to be found
here as everywhere, and it is surprising how, when not
one is to be seen around, the instant any meat is
exposed they assemble in thousands. Even on the top
of Mount Gower, nearly 3,000 feet high, on opening a
tin of salmon blow-flies came around in hundreds. No
frog or toad is found on the island, and only two varie-
ties of the pretty harmless lizard are met with. There
is good fishing off the coast, and the wild pigs and
goats offer exciting sport for the gun. Few game birds
visit the island the snipe, quail, goose, and bus-
tard, are not known, the only birds of value for the
table being the beautiful green and gold dove, the
wood-hen, the small curlew, called the snipe by the
islanders, and a few waders or stilts resembling the
sandpiper. Occasional visits of the blue coot and wild
duck are spoken of.
Altogether the island offers a magnificent opportunity
for a resort to recruit health and to take in a stock
of renewed vigour and strength. Any person with the


requisite capital and management might establish here
a sanatorium which would soon attract many visitors
anxious to have rest and repose from the toil and worry
of city life and business anxieties. Just as patients
visit Madeira, the Azores, and Algeria, to recruit
health and recover lost elasticity of mind and muscle,
so Lord Howe Island will in time become a second
Madeira, and its efficacy in this respect will be ? familiar
as household words.? The usual trammels and con-
ventionalities of fashionable sea-side resorts would be
here escaped, and visitors could roam its palm groves,
climb its mountains, explore its botanical treasures,
bathe in its waters, without a thought or care of the
great world they have torn themselves from. With a
few roomy and cosy cottages erected on the island of
the palm stems and thatched with their fronds, as is
the custom, families might take occasional migrations
from the colonies for a few months, arranging with a
schooner or for a passing vessel to call at the island.
Indeed, the steamers trading to Fiji often come within
sight of Lord Howe, and the islanders are well supplied
with good boats and the necessary crews to man them ;
but until some preparation has been made to meet the
demands incurred by any large number of visitors, it is
well to mention that beyond accommodating two or
three people for a short visit at present no adequate
provision exists. Any party proposing to make a
short day should go prepared with provisions and
refreshments in case of need. Persons who have
visited the island and who have made a stay of
a few weeks always speak of the bracing effects
of the life led there, and the genial influences of
its climate.
Like most small communities the people of Lord
Howe Island have their peculiarities and distinguishing
features. No citizen of the world would expect to find
an Eden-like condition of things. Just as it is said
party Government has a tendency to keep political
society sweet and progressive, so the likes and dislikes
in society have a tendency to keep the body social in
condition ; or, a better simile?just as a periodical
visitation of measles, small-pox, and other zymotic


diseases leads to the adoption of cleanly and healthful
habits, so a little bickering and watchfulness on the
part of sections of society tend to keep up a keen sense
of propriety, which after all is the best guarantee for
progress. People left pretty much to themselves, and
without the police-man like supervision of keenly criti-
cising neighbours, are very apt to fall into a condition
of primitive indifference as to appearances, and to take
little heed of the conventionalities of society which con-
stitute mainly the essentials of civilized existence. If
petty jealousies occasionally exist they never interfere
with or mar the hospitality shown by all classes to
visitors, and perhaps it is mainly to the anxiety of all
to show attention that the unconscious preference of a
visitor for any one islander is a small cause of dissatis-
faction or trouble among many.
The affairs of the island were, until recently, adminis-
tered by Capt. Armstrong, R.N., who as Resident Magis-
trate on behalf of the New South Wales Government
found plenty of arduous work to do. For many years the
residents lived without any restriction whatever except a
few crude laws they agreed to abide by for the general
observance of order and individual rights. But they
were powerless to enforce these laws, and trouble of no
ordinary kind often threatened to overtake the little
community. On one occasion life was sacrificed, and
the Government of New South Wales had to despatch
an officer to enquire into the circumstances ; and it was
in view of any future complications that it was wisely
determined to have due supervision exercised and salu-
tary law administered by a duly recognized officer. As
may be imagined, a community which had for years
held undisputed possession, and recognized no authority
but of its own creation?paying neither rent, tax, or
license ?would naturally feel some degree of restriction
on being brought within reach of even the mildest laws,
and feel somewhat jealous of even the slightest check
upon their actions. Occasionally there are little
rumblings and faint murmurings which tell of a chafing
against constituted authority ; but it seemed to be a
point in the Resident Magistrate?s treatment to let
these mild forms of revolt exhaust themselves, and to


only seriously notice any very pronounced cases of open
resistance to admittedly salutary laws and counsels.
On the whole, things go along smoothly enough, but as
in larger communities the presence of one or two tur-
bulent spirits of a mild type?who are emulous of John
Hampden and other rebellious patriots of historic note
?throws a ripple upon the tisual placid surface of affairs
in Lord Howe. Meetings are held, resolutions are
passed with due gravity, just as is the fashion else-
where, and the cause of these is duly forgotten in a day
or two ; the little electric storm over, the atmosphere is
clearer and people breathe more freely. As a rule
the people are too busy to find time for much calm
deliberation over any matter, and the zealoiis partisan
who lays himself out for agitation, too frequently carries
the day for a time from sheer force of persistency.
Unhappily, if the cause be a wrong or mischievous one,
this dogged persistence is still likely to be successful ;
and this state of things made the Resident Magistrate?s
position an unenviable one, as he had no power to
enforce his decrees, nor any assistance in the shape of
police.
Most of the business transacted on the island is by
barter or exchange of commodities ; rarely indeed is
any transaction represented by any coin whatever. A
visitor will scarcely ever see money of any kind. The
produce of the island is given in exchange for flour,
sugar, tea, tobacco, and other necessaries or luxuries of
life.
Under the heading of the flora of Lord Howe Island
will be found some account of the value of its in-
digenous timber, and we propose here to note the value
of the resources of its surrounding waters.
It lias been well said by one of our leading writers on
horticultural matters that every plant and animal of
value to the Australian colonists has had to be specially
introduced ?that ? not a single fruit-yielding tree, grain-
yielding grass, or animal worthy of domestication was
found on the Australian continent by the early colonists.
The apple, pear, plum?in short, every tree and plant
worthy of culture has been introduced ; and the horse,
sheep, cattle, and every variety of domestic fowl has


l>een brought with immense labour from what are really
? the uttermost parts of the earth ? to serve the use of
the colonists. ?
An exception must certainly be made in favour of
our ungarnered harvest of the sea, though even in this
direction most commendable efforts have been made to
introduce fish having a special value in Northern
Europe. It would really seem that nothing had a
value in the eyes of the Englishman unless realized
under circumstances of great difficulty, if not of danger,
and so it happens that the teeming wealth of our sur-
rounding waters though well known is rarely gathered.
Salmon, turbot, and other expensive fish of English
waters are brought in ice at great cost and sold as
luxuries, while our own fish, quite equal in value, are
neglected. In older countries the fishing grounds form
objects of the most jealous care, and only by the exer-
cise of great tact and wise legislation have most san-
guinary wars on their account been averted. The
rights to fish in given regions in old world seas have to
be regarded and treated with respect ; but here, on our
Australian seaboard, no notice has been taken of the
harvest which is left year after year ungarnered. A
great necessary, if not an essential, article of diet is
altogether neglected or supplied at such a price as to
place it beyond the reach of the large class who would
be benefited by its more complete development. In
speaking, therefore, of the fish in the waters surround-
ing Howe Island, it is with a full knowledge of the vast
harvest awaiting the gathering in the waters of the
mainland of the Australian continent. There are, how-
ever, some special features of the island product which
demand attention, and these are the number of varieties
not found off the coast of the mainland. Foremost
among these are the bluefish, excellent either fresh or
cured, the salmon, garfish, trevally, kingfish, cod, and
others. All these, even with the primitive gear and
appliances used, are taken in great numbers, and were
the field systematically worked an enormous harvest
might be secured and utilized for the home con-
sumption of the colonies, or for export as an article of
commerce. It is doubtful whether the bluefish,


salmon, and kingfish, as prepared here, do not equal in
every respect the delicious trumpeter of Tasmanian
waters. It is no uncommon thing for a small party to
take from four to five-hundredweight in a few hours,
fishing, and this forms one of the popular pastimes of
the islanders. A very fine crab frequents the sandy
reaches and bays, and at certain seasons is got very
frequently on the coasts. It is quite unlike the crab of
the mainland, and in flavour is very delicate and agree-
able ?much more so than the crayfish which abounds
on the mainland coasts. Turtle also are got in the
season. The black whale or ? humpback ?is frequently
to be seen around the island, but no means exist for
securing them. Indeed, one of the great wants of the
islanders is a vessel of some forty tons burden wherewith
to convey the produce to market, and to work the waters
systematically in fishing for the curing process on an
extensive scale. Some few years ago the islanders
owned and worked a small ketch of a capacity under
fifteen tons, but she was scarcely seaworthy and on her
last voyage to Sydney was lost with every soul on board.
This sad incident threw a terrible gloom over the place,
as nearly every family suffered either from the death of
one or two of its members or from the total loss of the
produce shipped for sale in Sydney. Indeed, even to
this day the loss of the Sylph has a most depressing
effect upon the energies of the people of Lord Howe,
as it left them very poor, and it has caused them a most
severe struggle to ?keep the wolf from the door.?
Crops are ofttimes wasted or damaged through no oppor-
tunity offering for conveying them to Sydney ; but an
effort is being made to obtain a schooner to trade
regularly with the island, and to assist in developing its
varied resources. There should be little difficulty in
accomplishing this, and as nearly all the male population
have been seafaring men, a vessel could be worked very
economically.
It has been observed that the island is in shape an
irregular crescent with Mount Gower as its southern
and Mount Phillip as its northern apex. Its concave
face is towards the west and its convex side towards the
east. Stretching across the sea or bay-like lagoon


forming the harbour is a reef which is exposed at low
water, and over which the sea at high tide breaks.
Along this reef are several openings through which
vessels drawing six or seven feet of water pass without
difficulty to the anchorage. One of these openings is
known as the ? North Passage,? another as the ?South,?
another as ?Hesketh?s vessels may pass through these
to the anchorage within the reef known as the lagoon.
There is secure anchorage inside the bar at the north
and at the south for vessels drawing seven feet of water,
and those of larger draught may make fast outside the
reef, to the Government buoy when it is restored.
During unfavourable weather for anchorage vessels may
stand ? off and on ? till the desired change.
The general set of the sea currents is from the
north and north-east ; wreckage and logs of timber
being frequently picked up on the eastern side of the
island. Cedar logs and planking from the northern
rivers of New South Wales and Queensland are sugges-
tive ?finds.? During the stay of the writer logs of
timber and many portions of ships? fittings, with masts,
booms, and a life buoy, came on shore, and the name-
board that seemed to have belonged to a large ship,
bearing so much of the name* Geraldine Pa****, was
picked�up. Indeed so many portions of ships? timbers
have been lately found washed ashore, as to lead the
islanders to declare emphatically that one or more
ships have met with disaster to the northward of the
island?Elizabeth Reef and Middleton Reef being indi-
cated as the probable scene of the mishaps. At present,
however, there is no means of solving the problem, and
the islanders are doomed to a long suspense ere their
fears are set at rest or realized, while the unfortunate
castaways may be lingering day after day without means
of escape. As a remedy against this state of things,
and especially on the score of humanity, it is suggested
that Howe Island should be formed into a survey or
relief station with a smart schooner ready at all
times to afford prompt succour, or to make peri-
* It was subsequently discovered that the ?Geraldine Pagot,? during
heavy weather, lost this name-board in the Climas Seas, probably some
3000 miles to the North of the Island.


odical visits to the dangerous reefs which lie within one
hundred miles of the islands. As a practical suggestion,
might not a schooner be purchased by the Government
for this purpose, and, under competent management,
be manned by a crew of the more steady Vernon boys,
who could here have useful instruction as sailors, fitting
them for after life, and, during their spells in port,
assist in agricultural pursuits, and qualify them for
farming and other industries 1 Indeed, the more one
contemplates the subject the more one is struck by the
immense advantages the island offers for the salutary
training and industrial education of these boys. The
climate is healthy. They would be away from the snares
and temptations of city life and its surroundings ; the
evil results of early associations would be escaped in
their freedom from contamination, and they might be
trained to prefer honest labour to ? larrkinism ? and
idleness. Of the many advantages the island offers in
this direction the Government need only turn to the
Reports of Captain Denham and others. The scheme
suggested might be very easily carried out, and even be
made reproductive in many ways ; at all events not a
day should be lost in making proper provision for the
crews of shipwrecked vessels trading in the neighbour-
hood of these extensive and dangerous shoals. In
former years a good trade was done by the islanders
with the various whaling ships seeking water and pro-
visions ; but of late the visits of these are rare. The
island offers a convenient refuge for shipwrecked crews,
and for vessels running short of supplies. Some years
ago the American ship Stetson, coal-laden, from New-
castle, put in here in a sinking condition ; she was
subsequently sold to a Sydney firm, and dismantled,
and her hull abandoned. About three years ago the
island was visited by the tidal wave which did so much
damage in many quarters, and the hull and cargo of the
Stetson came to grief, and was broken up on the bar, some
seven hundred tons of coals being sunk near the reef,
and the deck and timber being washed high and dry at
the north of the settlement. Indeed, only by almost
superhuman exertions did the islanders succeed in
securing a mass of wreckage being carried out to sea


to the imminent risk of ships plying in the South
Pacific. Portions of this wreck may be seen lying
about the beach all around the island even now.
About three years ago the island formed a welcome
refuge for fourteen of the crew of a vessel abandoned
at sea, and these made the voyage of nearly four
hundred miles in an open boat with but the bares/
supplies of water and food, reaching the island in a
most exhausted condition. The boat, which has been
aptly christened the Rescue, is still at the island, and
performing useful work. These and many more inci-
dents of the island?s history point to the urgent necessity
of its being at all times furnished with the means of
rendering relief in the many ways it is so well adapted for.
Allusion has been made to the flora of the island ;
but space forbids more than the most cursory notice of
its extent and beauty.
The typical plants of the island are four palms, a ficus
with the habit of the Indian banyan, and several large
foliaged plants of great beauty. The timber trees are
numerous, and these yield wood of great excellence for
building and cabinet work. But perhaps the most
noticeable feature of the vegetation of Lord Howe
is the number of varieties of climbing, twining, and
creeping plants, some of which are exceedingly striking.
The Palms have been classed as of the genus ? Kentia ?
and it is singular how each preserves its distinctive
character unaffected by cross fertilization or hybridi-
zation. Kentia Forsterii is the ? Thatch Palm ?of the
islands, it rises ordinarily to a height of thirty feet but
sometimes attaining even a height of eighty feet, yield-
ing its graceful fronds arranged regularly like a crown
around its head. The trunks are used as the main
timbers of structures, and when split form battens for
rafters, fencing, and other purposes; the leaves or fronds
are used for thatching dwellings or sheds. Houses so
built and thatched are cool in summer and cosy and
warm during cold weather. This variety usually grows
on the coast level lands and rarely occupies the rising
and rocky aspects. Kentia Belmoreana ?the ? Curly
Palm ? also occupies the lower zone, and prevails on
the rocky and slightly elevated lands. Both these


varieties suddenly cease at an elevation of under a
thousand feet. The variety under notice is less robust
than the thatch palm, and having the pinnae or leaflets
erect instead of pendulous, is peculiarly graceful and
forms a striking contrast to the thatch palm which has
them drooping. Above the zone favouring the
? Thatch ? and ?Curly? Kentias, the variety known as
Canterburyana is found, styled by the islanders the
umbrella palm, a palm of very distinct type growing at
an altitude of from a thousand feet to the top of the
highest mountain. A mistake occurs in the Report of
the Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, who assigns
this palm a limit of within many hundred feet of the top
of Mount Gower. Asa matter of fact it is found growing
at the very summit side by side with the mountain palm,
Kentia Moorei. It is very distinct from other varieties,
not merely on account of its fruit, which is as large as a
pigeon?s egg, but also in the branching spadix yielding
the fruit. Keniia Moorei is the fourth variety of palm
characteristic of the island ; it is only found beyond an
elevation of 2,000 feet, and gives a small seed not so
large as a marble, and the spadices are bunched even
more than those of the mountain palm last mentioned.
It is dwarfer of habit than any of the other varieties,
and is peculiarly graceful.
Indeed the arrangement of the fruiting spadix in the
four varieties, forms a distinguishing feature of each.
The ? Curly? has the spadix singly sprouting out from
the side of the crown ; the ? Thatch ? has the fruiting
spadices united at the base in sets of from three to six ;
the Umbrella Palm has its spadices bunched like the
grape ; and the variety found in the highest mountain
zone (Kentia Moorei ) has them still more bunched in
clusters. It is very singular that neither of the two
last mentioned have been found growing at a lower level
than that named, and neither has been found with the
coast or lower line of ? Thatch ? or ? Curly? varieties.
As has been mentioned the Thatch Palm is of im-
mense value to the islanders, and the Curly is equally
valuable for its stems, but its fronds do not answer so
well for thatching. The structures covered with the
thatch are quite characteristic of the island. The stems


of the leaves are notched and bent over battens on the
rafters, no nail or peg being required to keep them
firmly in position ; inside, the roof presents a very neat
wicker-work appearance and is quite impervious to the
rain.
The Banyan tree is a tree of very striking aspect,
some of the specimens being very grand and impressive.
In many trees the original trunks have long since
crumbled to dust, but their place has been supplied by
vast stems thrown down at first as aerial roots, but in
time solidifying and supplying the tree with sap from
the soil. These large column-like trunks rise in scores
to a great height and support the grand canopy of
branches and foliage which often cover nearly an acre of
land. The tree differs in several ways from the Indian
Banyan and has been named Ficus Columnaris on account
of its physical aspect.
Other marked plants of the island are :? Bandia
Macrophylla, a large foliaged tree giving sweet scented
blooms ; Dracophyllnm Fitzgeraldii, a gigantic epacrida-
ceous plant of singular habit; Flagellaria, a cane-like
plant, which, by means of the prehensile tips of its
leaves, climbs to the tops of the highest trees and thence
along from tree to tree till it commonly attains a length
of over a hundred feet; a mistleto-like parasite, viscum
opuntioides, which kills the branches of the indigenous
timber it grows upon, and is a serious enemy of several
introduced fruit-bearing trees; the tulip-tree, or Fugosia
Pattersonii, with its pale pink perfumed flowers ; the
fragrant ASgiceras yielding a neat miniature-like bouquet;
a pittosporum of pretty habit, and many other charac-
teristic flowering plants and trees.
The island is rich in ferns and mosses; Alsophilla
excelsa and several other varieties of tree-ferns arrive at
very perfect development in the valleys of the chief
mountains and hills ; Davallias, Pteris, Polypodiums,
Lycopodiums, Aspleniums, Trichomanes, Hymenophyl-
lums, Lomarias, Todea, and Adiantums form a perfect
carpet of verdure in localities suiting their growth, and
at the very summit of the Mount Gower mosses and
lichens cover the decayed wood and tree stems.
The curious screw pine Pandanus Forsterii or tent


tree of the islanders grows to a good height, throwing
out adventitious shoots, which on touching the ground
take root and serve as feeders to the parent plant, these
resemble in their arrangement the ribs of an umbrella
or tent, and it is singular that on touching the ground
should a stone or log be in the way the shoot dies at
the point of contact and from the sides two other roots
are thrown down, and this process is repeated until the
plant succeeds in rooting itself.
The vegetation of Lord Howe Island is peculiarly
beautiful and striking, and to treat it in any exhaustive
way would require a special article devoted to it. To
the botanist a stay of a few weeks on the island is a
treat rarely afforded the lover of nature.
