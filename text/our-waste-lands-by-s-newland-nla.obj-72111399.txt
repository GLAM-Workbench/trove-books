OUR WASTE LAUDS
No. I.
DIFFERENT LAND SYSTEMS COMPARED.
IN the three words heading this article is embraced the future
of this colony, since it is obvious that unless the public
estate can be turned to profitable use South Australia must
remain in her present unenviable second-rate position?already
overtaken by Queensland, and deplorably outpaced by New
South Wales and Victoria. Proofs are daily forced upon us that
our population is passing over the borders into the other colonies
to better land and more favorable conditions of occupancy. If this
were a mere spasmodic movement contingent upon a bad season
it would not be cause for much attention or alarm, but we well
know that this leak has been going on for years?not the natural
following employment by labor which the same cause will restore,
but the permanent departure of our producers, the sinew and
backbone of the country. The question is not only why do they
leave, but why do so few come to settle upon the wide waste
lands our senators so loudly proclaim are a boundless source of
undeveloped wealth ? In a sincere endeavor to in some measure
answer these questions I now venture to place my reflections
upon paper, and claim a space in your widely-circulated journal.
The tendency of late legislation has been to place a higher value
upon our public lands. Attempts have been made to reduce the
upset price below �l, but jiot only have these been frustrated,
but comparatively little land is now allowed to be sold at all, and
that of a very inferior quality. We cannot claim that our land
is superior to that of America, Canada, New South Wales,
Victoria, or Queensland, since it is incontestable that it is
subjected to severer droughts than any of these; yet we put a
higher price upon it, and even in leasing the conditions are less
favorable than in most, if not all, of the countries named.


Examples appear valueless to South Australians ever since
the passing of the Real Property Act and the construction of the
Transcontinental telegraph. Nothing is worth much unless we
initiate it, by reason of the vanity and ambition born of the
completion of these great works. Well, there is no doubt we did
both these big things and thereby benefited others more than
ourselves. Having toasted ourselves drunk with elation and
self-congratulation, let us digest a little of the bread of humilia-
tion and mentally enquire the results lately of our attempts to
utilise the public estate by permanent settlement and increase of
population. We simply don?t move. Our people, cattle, sheep,
and everything desirable that is ours, do not multiply. Indeed,
at the present time it is a hard struggle for existence between
the scattered discouraged settlers and the rabbits, with long odds
in favor of the latter, if the existing system of high upset price
of land, extortionate rents, and insecurity of tenure are continued.
This is an evil that can only be met by population, which will
never be attracted by all but prohibitive prices for an inferior
article; nor will it be achieved by refusing to acknowledge that
it is inherent in human nature to desire a home not subject to
the terms of any lease however long, but on freehold land. This
is the feeling that has actuated the tenant farmers and others of
the old world (the class it is the interest of all new countries to
encourage) in swarming to America to augment her wealth and
develop her resources. Is it probable, even possible, that our
new-born idea of leasing instead of selling land will ever attract
such men ? Is it not more likely to repel those who have
suffered under such a principle ? Take the United States as
undoubtedly the most important example of successful colonisa-
tion the world has ever seen, and will anyone venture to assert
that cheap freehold land has not been the magnet to draw the
sons of every civilised nation to her shores ? With a capital of
strength and energy, almost ? without money and without price,?
they can acquire a home upon richer land, in a better climate,
under more favorable circumstances, than in South Australia.
The lands bordering rivers and railways are theirs to select from,
where the rainfall is certain and the communication sure, there to
become thriving members of a prosperous community. With an
apathy that is astounding to those who look beneath the surface
we have known of the marvellous success that has attended the
attempts to develop the w T aste lands of the United States and
various British colonies, yet derive no instruction from the
practical lesson. True, with an ambition emulous of our cousins
we have built and intend building railways for the purpose of


opening up unproductive land, but there the resemblance ceases.
They distribute their broad acres with lavish hands to all who
will use them, and they are covered with people and products.
We cling to ours, and they remain as nature made them. If
there were signs of a change?l cannot say a return?to a more
liberal policy the future would look brighter, and this article
never have been written ; but there are none. As a sign of the
times we must accept the Government policy as expounded by
the Chief Secretary at Norwood ; but withal is it anything more
than ? a little more sleep, a little more slumber, and a little more
folding of the hands to sleep; ? in other words a policy of
waiting ? It cannot be denied that the Ministry are at present
in touch with public opinion, but it can be fairly complained that
they are merely an echo of it, as exemplified by the members of
the Legislature. To strike out a new path by reducing the
existing upset price of freehold and leasehold land to less, as it
ought to be, than that of our neighbors, and thus endeavor to
attract a population who will turn what is useless now to
practical benefit, would be to take an enlightened view of public
affairs and?vacate their seats. This would be an amount of
self-abnegation they would stigmatise as quixotically unworthy
of a South Australian statesman, so finding no help in man the
country waits blindly what the future will bring forth. The
mischief is that while we are waiting the rabbits are not, and
probably before a radical awakening comes they will cross the
continent. This may appear a small matter to some, but it is
not the least evil of practically denying the land of the colony
to those willing to utilise it.
Each of the countries named has long ago recognised and
acted upon the knowledge that men and women are more
valuable than acres of ground. Their system has been to attract
settlement by a lavish disposal of the public land, and in some is
so still. Even in Victoria and New South Wales, where to a
certain extent it has been abandoned, it was not until a large
settled population was assured. As a proof of this Victoria had
up to the end of 1885 alienated 14,413,304 acres, New South
Wales 41,683,474 acres, South Australia (up to the end of 1886)
only 9,527,761. She holds her land with ever tightening hands,
while they have their large and ever-increasing population.
Which is occupying the more enviable position ? It may be
summed up in a few words. South Australia is the least
prosperous and progressive of all the main Australian colonies.
At the present time, when we fondly hope we have ? turned the
corner,? is there one producing interest that is really thriving ?


We know there is not ; largely if not principally owing to the
illiberality of our land laws and regulations. I believe if a fair
analysis of the various systems of the countries is made, even
up to to-day, it will show that Crown lands can be purchased on
more advantageous terms in all of them than in South Australia,
with all her broad expanse of square miles. With all this, and
much of it undoubtedly inferior land ?subject to droughts which
no forethought or labor of man can ever entirely meet or
neutralise?in greater quantities than most of our rivals, one
would suppose that business principles regulating competition
would prevail, and it would be offered for sale or lease on lower
terms than theirs. Until this is done our producing interest
cannot grow or be establisded on a sound basis. There will be
spasmodic periods of progress and prosperity, no doubt, but the
solid steady growth depending upon production is not to be
expected while our lands remain the property of the State.
LAND IN THE UNITED STATES.
From a circular issued by the General Land Office, Washing-
ton, dated 1884, much of the following information is gleaned. In
the United States land is offered by auction at a minimum price
of ss. 2d. per acre. If not sold it can be purchased
privately at the same price. Thus far the American system
is identical with ours, with the important difference of
14s. 6d. per acre in the estimated value. Where public works
or railways constructed on the land-grant principle are con-
sidered to give increased value to the land contiguous to such
public improvements, the land comprising the retained blocks is
first offered at the ? double minimum ? rate, 10s. 4d. per acre.
Any remaining, according to an Act passed in 1880, can be taken
up at the minimum rate. No doubt this applies to the inferior
land, and from it we surely may derive a lesson where so much
of our poor land is still unsold and unsaleable at our absurd
upset price. It certainly does appear passing strange why land
in South Australia should be considered worth nearly four times
as much as in America. Knowing nothing of the circumstances,
one would suppose that ours are the rivers, the climate, the
wealth, the proximity to the Old World and its markets, and the
thousand-and-one advantages that belong to our cousins. But
the contrast is yet more marked in the liberality with which
those willing to occupy and develop waste lands are treated.
Under the homestead privilege the intending settler can ? make
entry ? for 160 acres or less. He must be the head of a family


or over 21 years of age, must take possession within six months
after application, and must cultivate continuously for five years.
The land then becomes his by paying the commission
fees to the Government officials. For ? single minimum ? land
these amount to a total of 18 dollars, and for ? double minimum
26 dollars. In the states on the Pacific Slope these charges are
higher, but cannot exceed �7 Is. Bd. for 160 acres of freehold
land. In grazing districts stock raising and dairy produce are
included in the definition of cultivation, and extension of time
where required in consequence of the ravages of grasshoppers
and drought may be allowed. Pre-emption is a right allowed to
the intending settler to take up 160 acres of unsurveyed land at
1 dollar 25 cents per acre if not within the limits of a grant to
a railway or some work of ? internal improvement.? Within the
limits of such grant the price is 2| dollars. This right is also
allowed where the tract has been surveyed and not offered at
public sale, payment having to be made within thirty-three
months from date of settlement. On the unsurveyed
lands the payment may be much deferred as the above
time is given after survey is completed. On the western
prairies grants of land are made for the purpose of timber
culture. The law provides that a certain number of acres (10) to
the quarter section (160) must be broken up each year and not
less than a stipulated number of trees planted. At the expiration
of eight years, on proving the requisite conditions have been
carried out, and that there are at least 675 healthy trees growing
to each acre, on of entry fees and commission, only
amounting to a few dollars, the settler can claim his title to the
160 acres. ? Desert land ? is described as ? land that will not,
without irrigation, produce some agricultural crop. An applicant
can take up a section of 640 acres or less on a cash payment
of 25 cents per acre. Within three years he must prove he ha&
irrigated the required portion of his selection, and on making a
final tender of one dollar per acre title will be granted. A closer
examination into the working of the whole system will show
that in actual practice everything is done to facilitate the
progress of the settler, not alone in taking possession of hia
selection, but to smooth his path afterwards.
IN CANADA.
According to the Canadian Handbook for 1886, under the
heading ? Homesteads ? and ? Pre-emptions,? any person, male or
female, who is the sole head of a family or 18 years of age, can
select not more than 160 acres of land. This homestead entry


entitles him or her to occupy and cultivate the land, and costs an
office fee of 10 dollars. Having obtained this, he is further
entitled to an additional 160 acres adjoining under pre-emption
entry by paying another 10 dollars to work in connection with
his homestead. Six months is allowed to begin residence and
cultivation on the homestead block. On proving he has resided
upon and cultivated his land for three years he is entitled to the
land grant. If not convenient to live on the property entirely
these provisions are relaxed. With regard to his pre-emption
block, he has a right to purchase it at Government price six
months after having obtained the title for the homestead land.
He thus becomes the owner of 160 acres at an actual cost of
�2 Is. Bd., and a right to 160 acres more by a payment of �2 Is. Bd.
when taking up the land and in three years and a half giving the
Government price for it. In cases of 20 families deciding to
settle together and form a village, the residence clause may be
dispensed with. The price of land and the conditions under
which it can be taken up appear to differ in the various provinces.
In Ontario land which has been surveyed and considered fit for
agriculture may be appropriated as free grants. A single man is
entitled to 100 acres ; a married man without children can take
no more. But to encourage population the male or female head
of a family having a child or children living with him or her may
obtain a free grant of 200 acres, and can also purchase an
additional 100 acres at 2s. per acre. The conditions are to
cultivate 15 acres in five years, not less than two in any year,
and build a house at least 16 by 20 feet, in which he must reside
for six months each year. He must clear and cultivate 15 acres
of the purchased land within five years, but is not required to
reside upon it. In the province of Quebec there are about six
millions of acres of surveyed Crown lands. These lands can be
purchased from the Government as follows One-fifth of the
purchase money must be paid the day of sale and the remainder
in four equal annual instalments bearing interest at 6 per cent.
The price varies from Is. sd. to 2s. sd, per acre, so that these
conditions must appear to our South Australian farmers as the
reverse of burdensome. The buyer must take possession within
six months of date of sale and occupy in two years. He must
clear in 10 years 10 acres for every 100 held by him, and erect a
habitable house at least 16 by 20 feet. Free grants are also
given A man over 18 years may demand a permit of occupation
of 100 acres from any Crown agent, and if at the end of four
years he has cleared 12 acres and built a house he gets his grant
free of charge.


In the province of New Brunswick there are three ways by
which grants of land may be secured. First, under the Act
relating to free grants of Crown lands ; second, under the Labor
Act; third, by purchase at auction. A person can obtain a free
grant of not more than 100 acres by commencing improving the
lot within one month after approval, and within three months
improve to the value of �4 3s. 4d., within one year build a house
16 by 20 feet. He must cultivate a portion of the holding also
for the three years before obtaining a title. A free grant under
the Labor Act is similar, excepting that the settler may pay by
his labor on the adjoining roads instead of the cash, �4 3s. 4d.
The cash upset price by auction is 3s. 4d. per acre in addition to
survey fee. A report by Professor Johnston, F.R.S. of England,
to the Government states that the soil of this province is capable
of supporting a population of from five to six millions. The
climate is exceedingly healthy, and will not prevent the soil
producing crops equal to those of England on average soils. In
Nova Scotia there are said to be blocks of really good land quite
accessible and near present settlements. The price of Crown
lands is �8 16s. per 100 acres. In British Columbia the settler
has the right of taking up a tract of land not exceeding 320 acres
in one part of the province and 160 in the remainder. Personal
residence for two years, with intervals and improvements to the
extent of 2 dollars 50 cents, are required to complete the right of
land grant. The upset price of land is 4s. 2d. per acre, payable
at time of purchase, in tracts of not less than 160 acres.
THE APPLICATION.
Compared with our selfish isolating land policy the liberality
with which the United States and Canadian Governments invite
immigrants to settle and take up land is really astonishing.
With the spontaneous influx annually entering their territories
this generosity may well appear prodigal; but it is dictated on
the soundest principles, as evinced by continued and increasing
success. We are daily told of the fearful monopolies and their
baneful effects in these Atlantic countries. The land grant
system for the construction of railways is something at which
the average South Australian shudders, yet it is only a part of
and quite consistent with their practice?population rather than
land. In my researches I have been unable to discover any ill
effects of the land grant system; on the contrary, it appears to
have proved of incalculable good. The companies work the rail-
ways at the lowest rates, and freely sell their lauds to all who
will buy and settle upon them. They have thus taught us a


lesson if we would but learn as to what could be done in
immediately forcing a railway across our own broad continent
and bringing capital and population to develop a territory the
difficulties of which we are quite unable to contend with.
With all the natural advantages possessed by the two great
countries of the American Continent it would really appear
unnecessary to offer such liberal inducements to settle on their
lands, but their politicians, and the good sense of the people,
have long recognised that men and women are more valuable
than broad acres; that no country can be rich or prosperous
because its area consists of an enormous extent of unoccupied
land, however fertile. They have therefore adopted the means
best adapted to rapidly quicken this dormant strength into active
life by proclaiming ? Our lands are open to all willing to become
fellow-citizens, and for only a few shillings sufficient may be
yours to make a permanent home upon, and from which a
living can be obtained.? The effects of this system are
too well known to need recapitulation here. Population
pours into the United States and Canada at a rate that
makes an appreciable difference in the crowded countries of
Europe. Immigration to the latter for the three years ending
with the year 1885 (the latest date to which I have statistics)
amounted to more than the entire people of South Australia, To
these, or all facts and figures that can be brought forward, some
of our enthusiastic fellow-colonists will reply ? Our climate is
more favorable to easy settlement, our bright sun to their
rigorous winter. Considering our superior advantages our richer
lands are worth more than the inferior soils of the Western
Continent.? Others will more correctly say ? They are much
nearer the countries of the intending immigrants, with rivers and
lakes beyond compare, with more productive lands yielding more
assured results ; we less favored by nature in all these cannot hope
to compete with the glorious west.? We certainly cannot by
demanding a higher price and offering worse terms for an inferior
article, but it remains to be proved that something would not be
gained by following an example that has operated so well in both
America and Canada. We have no settlers here to correspond
with their pre-emptors and homesteaders. We give no land on
our treeless wastes as a reward for the growth of timber. We
offer no special inducements to those watering or irrigating our
deserts. They do, and more, so that civilisation and development
daily extend the range of settlement. Our laborer has to pay �1
per acre for his workingman?s block ; theirs get very much
more for nearly nothing. Hitherto we have not been influenced


by the mere commonsense mode of dealing with their waste lands
adopted by our Atlantic cousins, because we must needs be wiser
than the rest of the world. They act under the false impression
that population is more to be desired than much unproductive
land, and they believe it cannot be attracted by anything less
than cheap freehold land, much less by leasing of an uncertain
tenure. But we know better. Numbers are an entirely secondary
consideration. We plume ourselves upon the State ownership of
broad acres, or rather square miles. We endeavor to build up an
impossible Utopia by vain theories and innovations, in flagrant
contravention of the old accepted principles of colonisation as-
practised bv all new countries. W T hat we actually have done to
develop this vast estate may be gathered from statistics and
enactments of the last few years.
No. 11.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA CONTRASTED WITH NEW ZEALAND AND
VICTORIA.
I AM reminded that a commission is sitting upon the land
question (undoubtedly the burning question at the present
time), and that while the process of incubation is proceeding, we,
in dutiful imitation of the Government, should suspend
judgment. A few people are sufficiently sanguine to anticipate
the hatching of a promising, perhaps perfect, chicken. To be
that it must prove a prodigy that will gobble up the whole heap
of land enactments, so as 'to enable a new start to made.
Though this is ? a consummation devoutly to be wished,? it is
not to be supposed that.it will recommend any very drastic
reformation of the present system, much less an entirely new
departure. Yet, while declining to keep silence, I do expect
something in the desired direction from the commission, as there
are good men and true among its members, who cannot have
been over a considerable portion of the country collecting
evidence without being impressed with the unsatisfactory results
and the absolute necessity of a change in our procedure.


It can be scarcely denied that a feeling is growing that our
treatment of the public estate is not an unqualfied success, as its
authors appear to assert by their determined retention of it.
Yet no influence was brought during the general elections to bear
upon the candidates in the direction of a radical change. The
doctrine of State ownership, with all its pleasing fictions, shows
some signs of being played out, and it is not improbable that
during the present session a more lively attention may attach to
the subject, though it is outside the arena of politics that the
matter will be fought out. Both town and country must soon
awake to the fact that spurts of prosperity, whether attributable
to exhibitions, mining booms, gold discoveries, or Broken Hills,
don?t mean the whole required to develop our territory. They
are all importnat auxiliaries, but we cannot claim that in relying
upon them we are doing much to promote the settlement of a
rural population over our vast estate. Great though we hope the
industry will grow, it is surely too early to acknowledge we have
reached our limit in everything beyond the present agricultural
arears except mining. Some, indeed, go so far as to say?? It
does not in the least matter how much is demanded for our land,
because it is not worth having at any price ; therefore it is
useless agitating.? This reasoning is both comprehensible and
logical, but it is hard to understand the consistency of those who
maintain the land is too valuable to sell, and yet acknowledge the
desirability of increasing the population by settlement on the
soil. We have read long articles and listened to longer harangues,
in more or less impassioned language, on the geographical position
of South Australia; of her magnificent gulfs piercing into the
continent; of her vast line of seaboards, with numerous ports
giving easy and cheap access to shipping. These extraordinary
advantages being in the proud possession of our colony in greater
proportion than in any of the others, were to be the means of
unexampled prosperity far outstripping all competitors. This has
been so persistently demonstrated that the most sceptical began
to think there must be something in it. We?ve geographically got
the position still, but it?s considerably further to the rear of the
other colonies. Now we are beginning to ask ourselves : ?If we
are such a slap-up colony with such slap-up perfect institutions,
why is it people don?t show their appreciation by sharing them ? ?
If the public push their enquiries a little further they will feel
some qualms of doubt touching the popularity of these same laws
and institutions, and possibly come to the conclusion that as a
colony South Australia does not quite eclipse all the rest in the
estimation of the immigrating class, or indeed any other. To utter


an unpalatable truth, it is rather ? small beer ? as an investment
for either capital or labor. Such statesments are bitter enough,
but we have had a surfeit of sweetmeats in the shape of
rhapsodies and prophecies that are as far off realisation as ever.
It is possible too that a ? shaking of the dry bones ? may infuse
a little progressive life into the body politic; and some such
resurrection is urgently required, as further research into what
others are doing, as well as have done in the past, to lay the
foundations of a growing prosperity abundantly shows.
WHAT THEY DO IN NEW ZEALAND.
The total area of New Zealand is upwards of sixty-six
million acres. Of these eighteen millions have been sold or dis-
posed of in education and other public reserves ; fourteen millions
belong to the aborigines or to the Europeans who have purchased
from them, and thirty-four million acres of Crown lands still
remain for disposal. Of the latter fifteen millions are open grass
or fern country, ten millions forest,.and nine millions are barren
mountain-tops, lakes, and worthless country. There are three
classes of land, divided as follows : ?Town and village lands,
suburban land, and rural land ; the latter being that not reserved
for town, villages, or any public purposes. It is of the latter or
country lands I purpose treating now ; of the others will simply
state that the minimum price of suburban sections, two acres to
twenty, is �3 per acre. The price of ? small farm ? allotments?
between one and fifty acres ?is not less than �1 per acre. They
can also be obtained on perpetual lease. Rural lands comprise
all other Crown lands, whether agricultural, pastoral, or forest.
The price varies from the mere cost of survey under the home-
stead system, up to �2 cash per acre in Canterbury. As in Canada
the system ditfers in the different districts. Freeholds may be
obtained by cash at auction or by application ; one fourth of
the purchase-money is paid on application, and the balance
within a month after the applicant has been declared the
purchaser. Freeholds may also be obtained by deferred pay-
ments, not exceeding 320 acres, at not less than �1 per acre,
except in Auckland, Hawke?s Bay, and Nelson, where the price
may be less. The period for payment is ten years, in half-yearly
instalments. Residence is required for six years, but may be
dispensed with where land is partially or wholly covered with
brush, &c. The purchaser of rural land may at any time after
six years pay the balance of the purchase-money, if he has
effected the improvements, and claim his land grant. The
necessary conditions are ?one-twentieth to be cultivated the first


year, one-tenth the second, and within six years one-fifth, and
substantial improvements made to the value of �1 per acre.
These consist of everything that renders the land more useful,
and some that perhaps do not. The homestead system was
formerly only in force in Auckland and the western districts, but
now applies to the whole colony. No more, however, than 8,000
acres can be set aside for this purpose in one district in a year.
No payment is required, the only cost being that of survey ; and
any person 18 years of age or upwards may select from 50 to
75 acres, any person under that age 20 to 30 acres, provided that
no family or household shall have more than 200 acres of first-
class, or 300 acres of second-class land.
What are called small grazing runs have an absolute lease
for 21 years without right of determination by the Government,
with full valuation for improvements at the end of the term;
also the right to cultivate in addition to the full right of
pastorage. The area cannot exceed 5,000 acres. At the end
of the first term the occupier has the right of renewal for
another 21 years. The rent varies in upset price from
l|d. per acre in the land districts of Auckland and Hawke?s
Bay to Is, in Canterbury. No person can lease more than one
run, and residence is compulsory within 12 months of date of
lease, and thereafter for six years unless the lessee resides on
other land in his occupation within ten miles. No right of
purchase is allowed, but the occupant can select 150 acres round
his homestead, through which no road can be taken or any public
privilege exercised without compensation. Leases of small areas
not exceeding 50 acres with perpetual right of renewal at a fair
fixed rental are allowed. The first period is thirty years, and
free right of sale of the tenant?s interest and improvements is
permitted. To encourage special settlements the Governor has
the power to set apart blocks of land upon which not less than
25 persons of any nationality can associate themselves under the
deferred payment or perpetual leases system. l>p to March 31,
1885, the area of land sold amounted to 17,710,027 acres, of
which 12,558,507 were sold for cash, realising the sum of
�12,511,220 ?something less than �1 per acre. Compare this
with the amount obtained from our farmers, and will any
sane individual deny that the New Zealand land system
has been in the past, and indeed is still, more liberal
than our own ? Under their homestead system, as in
America and Canada, land is obtainable for the mere cost of
survey. It cannot be said that this only implies to inferior lands,
for it is expressly stipulated that it is irrespective of the quality


of land. Will the most enthusiastic admirer of all that is South
Australian object that our public estate is more valuable per acre
than that of New Zealand, or to minimise it, will any one assert
that any of our land is worth more in an agricultural point of view
than a corresponding quantity of theirs ? The facts are entirely
the other way ?the soil, the climate, the abundance of water
are all in their favor. If we are wise in the mode, conditions,
and price under which we attempt, but very indifferently succeed,
in developing our Crown lands, then the New Zealanders are the
veriest idiots God?s earth every belonged to. Their total area is
about 66 million acres, while we hold considerably more than
578 million. Such a cut and come again block that one would
think it very hard to be too liberal, but facts proved to demon-
stration are empty as bubbles when urged upon that section of
the community who for the present, unhappily, shape the
destinies of poor South Australia. We occasionally console our-
selves by thinking the Maoriland is as much depressed as our
own colony, and, no doubt, it has suffered from the same cause
that we do?overborrowing, publicly and privately.
HOW LAND IS DEALT WITH IN VICTORIA,
Victoria, having alienated about 15,000,000 acres or more up
to date, besides 7,584,000 undergoing the same process under the
deferred payments system, is now holding her hand in the matter
of selling the remainder of the public estate, consisting of a total
area of 30,000,000 acres, and has latterly adopted the leasing
principle to a much larger extent. The upset price is still �1
per acre, with from 10 to 20 years allowed to pay the money.
What are called the ? agricultural and grazing ? lands are
surveyed in blocks of not more than 1,000 acres each, and leased
for a term of 14 years at not less than 2d. or more than 4d. per
acre. Applications are made, and if more than one a board
decides who obtains the lease. The holder is not required to
reside upon, but must fence within three years and destroy the
vermin. At the expiration of the lease improvements are to be
paid for to the extent of 10s. per acre. These selections appear
to be restricted to males over 18 years of age who have not taken
up land under previous Acts. The occupier has the right of
purchase of 320 acres upon easy terms. He must pay for it at
the rate of Is. per acre annually for six years; at the end of
that time he can pay the balance, 145., and obtain Grown grant
or continue the Is. per annum until the whole 20s. is paid. He
must reside upon the land (or within five miles) for six years,
and make improvements to the value of �1 per acre. If these


conditions of residence are not complied with the price for the-
freehold is doubled, �2 per acre, and the period allowed for
making improvements reduced to three years. A limited extent
of Crown lands are still sold annually by auction, but as already
intimated the bulk is otherwise dealt with. This cannot
be wondered at; they have passed the initial stage in
the occupation of the country; the results are assured
and no inducements are required to attract population.
A large porportion, too, of the remaining public estate is not
suitable for agriculture, and to attempt anything of the kind
would end in similar disasters to some of our own. Small
pastoral holdings estimated to carry 1,000 to 4,000 sheep, or
equivalent in cattle, are leased for 14 years at Is. a head for
sheep and ss. for cattle, but the carrying capacity is determined
upon a basis of not less than 10 acres to a sheep. If more than
one applicant, auction decides between them; vermin must be
destroyed, and improvements are to a limited extent paid for at
termination of the lease.
The mallee country is divided into two parts ?? the border?
and the interior area. Of the former blocks up to 20,000 acres
are let for 20 years without competition, the rent to be fixed by
regulation. In the interior the period of lease is the same, the
rent per head sheep 2d., cattle Is. for the first five years ; double
that for the second ; and 6d. per sheep, 3s. per head cattle, for the
last 10 years ; lessees to be compensated for permanent improve-
ments. The Victorian Handbook for 1886, to which lam
indebted for much of the above information, says nothing about
the Government retaining the power of resumption of those
leases. Indeed, that unlimited power appears peculiar to our own
colony, and is characteristic of our conduct in dealing with all
leaseholds, lest anyone should make too much out of us. It is con-
tended that it is a power that will never be exercised; but the un-
certainty of the tenure destroys the selling value, and is therefore
most prejudicial to the interests of the tenant. It has been claimed
by Victorians that their colony is the garden of Australia, and in
despite of the sneer of the New South Welshman, ?Yes, the
cabbage garden,? it cannot be denied that Victoria is most happily
situated for the growth of agricultural products. With a certain
rainfall over most of her area descending at the right season
there is no part of the continent where the husbandman can
more safely rely upon a return for his labor. These have
naturally had their effect in promoting development, but the
Government have also been eager to take advantage of every
extraneous circumstance. They were quick to understand that


when gold had attracted immigration something more was
necessary to retain it, so the best of their splendid land was
freely disposed of, and the result has been the alienation of the
most valuable part of the public estate, and the permanent
settlement of a population that any country in the world would
be proud of, and which we envy. The feeling was never felt, or
at any rate never acted upon that because gold, other minerals,
or precious stones were discovered land should be withdrawn
from sale. On the contrary, it has rather been thrown open in
all the colonies with the sole exception of South Australia, who,
influenced by politicians in whom she has unaccountably placed
her trust, has thus missed opportunities of increasing her per-
manent population.
?IDOLS AND ORACLES OF THE INGLORIOUS PAST.?
Take as an instance the discovery of gold at Teetulpa.
It had been previously intended to sell some of the
Crown lands in the north-eastern district. Immediately
the cry arose?led by the men who have been with probably
the best intentions a curse to South Australia?? What,
sell our lands, the heritage of our children, just when their
teeming wealth is displayed ' ? and they prevailed. Where is
our dream now of the Ballarat of the interior, and the wealth
untold that was to be ours ? The gold has melted like a vision,
and the people gone without an effort to retain them. lam not
sanguine enough to have believed that ? flash in the pan ? ever
would result in a big settlement, but others thought differently,
and we ought to have been prepared to meet every possible
desire to acquire a home by all who came. Another example is
afforded of the same feeling in the present Government?s policy.
The reason assigned for curtly dismissing all idea of constructing
the Transcontinental railway on the land grant system is the
discoveries of supposed precious stones and minerals in the
MacDonnell Ranges. Precisely when the time appears opportune
for getting this great work done on the most favorable terms the
welfare of the country is sacrificed to this monstrous retention of
State proprietorship over so enormous an area, in which each and
every system to attract population might wisely be tried. The
free grants of land on conditions of residence and improve-
ments ; the same for timber culture and irrigation or water
conservation; also absolutely freed tenure of leaseholds, with
extension by virtue of certain permanent water improvements.
These are some of the innovations that should be embodied in
future legislation, and the sooner the better, but before any such


advance in true progress is likely to be taken, the idols and
oracles of the inglorious past must be relegated to a fitting
obscurity. From some of them nothing is to be expected but a
continuance of the suicidal policy under which our population
does not and will not increase, leaves our land uncultivated,,
unstocked, and unproductive, while as a necessary consequence
trade languishes, and for our young men entering into life, as for
immigrants, there is no inducement to settle upon the public
estate ; certainly this is true as compared with the advantages
and liberality offered by the legislation of the communities yet
reviewed in these articles.

LEGISLATION WITHOUT SETTLEMENT.
HAPPY is the man who reposes under ? his own vine and
fig tree,? and leaves the perturbed in spirit to further
perplexity in attempting to unravel the mazes of complex land
systems. However, lam not the first who, having put his hand
to the plough, has regretfully sighed that he did not leave that
implement alone.
A searcher into South Australian statistics will find in due
season, if the decay of old age does not overtake him, that in
1877 an Act was passed repealing some 33 former Land Acts, and
that since that time some few under a hundred have been consoli-
dated, which is doubtless a source of pride to the authors. So-
much mental and physical energy having been expended in the
compilation and subsequent distruction of these works of art
rather than sound legislative enactments, we are considerably
surprised at so much legislation for so little actual colonisation.
The e reflections, more or less bitter, force the conclusion that
the progress and prosperity of the colony would have proceeded
more satisfactorily and rapidly if Legislature and Government
alike had, to use a colonialism, ? chucked ? the whole thing up
and said to the whole world ? Do what you will with our waste-
lands. Mine, graze, garden, irrigate; only use them.? That is
the sort of feeling engendered in the minds of many best
acquainted with the burning land question by the imbecility


that has characterised our treatment of it. Loudly proclaiming
natural advantages that do not exist, or if they do count for
little, or ignoring difficulties demanding a combination of
liberality on the part of the State and energy and self-denial in.
the colonists, is not the way to develop South Australia. It is
far wiser to acknowledge that the obstacles attending the settle-
ment of our country are greater than those our neighbors have
to overcome ; that our rainfall is less, our surface waters neither
permanent nor numerous. Frankly admitting these things we
should offer all the compensation possible by the liberality which
we can extend to those turning our Crown lands to profitable use,,
as well as those willing to attempt it, grudging them no success,
however great that may be.
New South Wales, until quite recently, has perhaps been the
most prodigal of all the colonies in disposing of her lands. From,
her foundation they have been held out as the grand inducement
to attract immigration. Even under a long course of paid emigra-
tion her Governments have steadily said?? It is not our duty to
find employment; go upon the land, it is all before you.? True
the upset price was �l, but the conditions of occupation wero
very easy, and terms favorable. There was practically no reser-
vation ; the selection before survey system allowed the settler to
choose his own home anywhere, on the banks of rivers, creeks,
lakes, on good soil, and with an ample rainfall. Much has been
said and written in South Australia against the principles of
New South Wales?s celebrated Act, which has here been never
really understood. It was early recognised that a new departure
was required to promote settlement upon the Crown estate, and
to the men of the day the choice lay between reducing the upset
price of the lands or opening them all. That the latter course
was a success a population from one end of the colony to the
other bears witness. It was said it would be the ruin of the
grazing interest, but attempt to count the flocks and herds of
New South Wales and it will soon be seen that the reverse is the
case, for under the same system squatters and graziers were
allowed to purchase land surrounding improvements they made,
a privilege never granted to the same class in our colony. To
establish a people upon the public estate and to utilise it was
held to be the soundest policy, nor has this course been departed
from now. Fixed tenure is one of the features of the latest enact-
ment, largely compensating for increased rent of New South
Wales, and the measure in many respects has entirely changed
her land policy. Hitherto it has been to utilise, in some form or
other the whole of her territory, though it necessarily scattered her


population ; now it is to fill up the gaps and create a closer settle-
ment. Enormous areas have been sold under the hammer at �1
or more per acre for cash, yet the hulk of the alienated land has
been taken up under free selection where there was no competi-
tion. The selector simply settled down upon the ground he
desired to obtain, drove in a peg or blazed a tree, and made his
application. He might be there for months, or even years, before
survey was made and the application granted, but no one could
dispute his title. From the old days, when her land was given
away in large grants, up to the present time, New South Wales
has been a progressive colony. She settled in the first instance
both Victoria and Queensland to the right and left of her, thus
losing many of her people, yet she still occupies the first place
among the Australian colonies. It may be briefly said that this
success was not attained by clinging to the public estate, but must
undoubtedly be attributed to freely distributing it.
Under the provisions of the Land Act of 1885, any person
aged 16 years or more can by conditional purchase take up in the
eastern division of the colony from 40 to 640 acres of land, for
which a deposit of 2s. per acre is required at the time of the
application. This comes before a board comprising an official
and two local persons appointed by the Government. Residence
for five years is compulsory, and the selector must fence his
selection within two years, unless sufficient cause can be shown for
not doing so. At the end of five years, if the board is satisfied
that the conditions have been fulfilled, and if the occupier chooses,
he can pay off the balance and take his title. If not he pays an
annual instalment of Is. for 20 years, with interest at the rate of
4 per cent. In addition to the conditional purchase the purchaser
can get by another application a conditional lease of three times
the area of his purchase, provided that the whole does not exceed
1,280 acres, in the eastern division. The rent of this lease will
be not less than 2d. per acre, any higher rate being assessed by
the board. After five years the lease can be converted into a
conditional purchase. The same law applied to the central
division, except that the area can be extended to 2,560 acres. In
the western division land cannot be conditionally bought, except
in special areas. One who is denominated a homestead lease-
holder can take up from 5,760 to 10,240 acres from portions of
old runs resumed by the Government. The rent cannot be less
than Id. per acre, and the tenure is 15 years, with right of
renewal for five years more. Conditional purchases without
residence can be taken up of not less than 40 or more than 320
acres. The applicant has to expend �1 per acre on improvements,


and the payments are double those upon ordinary conditional
purchases. Lands are sold for cash at an upset price of �1 ss.
per acre by auction. Land on goldfields can also be bought in
small areas by those settling on them. Leases of limited grazing
areas ? for every known purpose that will benefit the community ?
are granted for a term of years.
Perhaps of all the colonies the career of Queensland at
present interests us most. A very few years ago we looked upon
her with the patronising airs of an elder sister, and metaphorically
patted her on the head as we hurried to our destiny as
? Queen of the Southern Seas.? Now, without making any
noise about it, she has quickly marched before us in a way
we don?t quite understand, and we wonder what is the
good of holding the ? geogragphical position ? if it means
being relegated to the ? back seat.? In the matter of climate we
cannot but admit that there is something in Victoria?s claim to a
cooler temperature. New South Wales may not go quite so near
burning heat as we do, but she is ever so much closer boiling.
But not being salamanders we protest we could not exist in
Queensland at all. It is very galling to see our pride of place
usurped by that juvenile in this way, but perhaps the wisest plan
will be to endeavor to ascertain how it has come about. Some
light is thrown upon this by various publications. The hand-
book tells me that the price of land in Queensland varies
according to the position of the land itself, the Governor having
the power within certain limits of fixing the price and maximum
quantity allowed to be purchased in particular districts. He is
to be guided in this by the quality of the land, its proximity to
market, or otherwise. The largest quantity allowed in any case
to a single individual is 5,120 acres, the smallest 40 acres. The
lowest price the law allows is ss. per acre, which the Governor
may by proclamation increase, but it is not expected to exceed in
any case 15s. per acre. Payment is to be made in 10 annual
instalments without interest. The above refers to the purchase
of land by conditional selection, and obtained by application.
The conditions are a qualified residence, substituted or personal,
making certain improvements, and the cultivation of a small
portion of the land. The improvements must be up to a value of
10s. per acre. The lease is for 10 years, but if the conditions are
fulfilled purchase can be completed in three years, and a
certificate claimed; or the owner can wait until the end of the
10 years or transfer his interest in the selection. Such are
some of the truly liberal and easy terms on which really rich and
fertile land can be obtained in Queensland.


The Homestead Law principle, passed expressly to encourage
industrious farmers without capital, is the most startling to our
over-�l-an-acre-for-inferior-ground ideas. A farmer wishing to
settle down permanently on a piece of land and live on it, may
make a homestead selection. In consideration of continual resi-
dence for five years, and improvements or cultivation to the value
of 10s. per acre, he gets the land at a nominal price?6d. per acre
per annum for five years. He may, however, obtain his title in
three years on proving fulfilment of conditions and paying balance
of purchase money (a total of 2s. 6d. per acre). The largest
quantity allowed to be taken up in this way is 160 acres.
Certain tracts of land supposed to be particularly suitable for
homestead selections, are by law restricted to these alone. On
these areas the largest homestead selection allowed is 80 acres.
The term ? continuous residence ? simply means that the
selector?s headquarters must be on his ground. He may be
absent for long periods, take contracts, work for wages, or employ
himself how he pleases. It will be seen that only 10s. per acre
in improvements in five years is required, certainly not more
than any settler must put up in necessary buildings, &c. The
costs of survey have to be added to the cost price of 2s. 6d. per
acre. They amount by scale to �3 Bs. for a 60-acre selection,
varying in proportion up to �8 for a 640-acre block. It will
thus be seen as an example that a selection of 60 acres will cost
a total sum of �lO 18s., 160 acres would cost about �2O, in each
?case with five years to pay it in. During 1884 a Land Act was
passed resuming one-half of certain pastoral holdings near the
settlements. The runs to the north and west were not included,
and I believe have since had a renewal of lease with fixed
tenure for 21 years in many cases. The lands resumed
embrace a large area of splendid soil, which can be taken up as
follows : ?The range of choice is apparent when it is stated that
the intending settler can lease for 30 years from 2,500 acres up to
.20,000 of grazing land; or he can lease for 50 years, with a right
of purchase after 10 years, from 320 acres up to 1,280. For
grazing land the rent is not less than |d. per acre, and for
agricultural 3d. per acre, fixed in the usual way by proclamation.
Fencing is required in from three to five years, or improvements
to the equivalent amount.
The following statistics, collected from the best data at my
command, will give a fair idea of the rapid progress of settlement
in Queensland. During 1878 there were granted 553 homestead
selections, embracing 50,064 acres, and 716 conditional purchases
selections, totalling 405,650 acres. In 1879 the total amount


selected under the Homestead and Conditional Purchases and
other Acts was 278,609 acres, and at the end of that year the
total quantity taken up under these provisions, pre-emptive
selections, and volunteer sections, was 5,570,100 acres. The
average price during 1879 for conditional purchases selections
was 11s. 3d. per acre. For homestead areas 2s. lid. per acre. I
do not find particulars for 1880, but up to the end of 1881 the
grand total selected under homestead and conditional purchase
was 6,858,873 acres, and under the former during the year
105,623 acres; under the latter, 640,280 acres, realising 10s. 6d.
per acre. In 1882 the area of land selected under conditional
purchase was 711,439 acres at 12s. 3�d. per acre, and that of
homesteads 127,601 acres; the grand total being raised to
'7,697,913. Returns are not available for 1883. In 1884 there
were 483,659 acres selected as conditional purchases at an average
price of 11s. B�d. per acre; homesteads selected 158,746 acres;
making 642,405 acres for the year, I quote the following
verbatim :?From January 1 to February, 1885, the area selected,
as conditional purchases was 85,620 acres; homesteads, 12,186
acres; homesteads in homestead areas, 8,918 acres; which with
volunteer and other selections made a total of 124,995 acres.
The average price of the land selected under conditional
purchases in 1885 was 10s. 7|d. per acre. I have not attempted
to give the price of land sold by auction, because town and
suburban and country lands are mixed up together, and it is to
the areas principally affecting the producing interests that I have
confined my researches and remarks. In Queensland, however,
the area sold by auction bears a very small proportion to that
disposed of under the conditional purchase and homestead
?systems. It seems to me that those must be blind who cannot
see that we have no chance in the race for pre-eminence while
we continue to extort our prices for land compared with what
the figures above disclose.
When we consider the advantages offered by Queensland to
the emigrant coming to her shores under her homestead and
conditional purchase systems we cease to be surprised that she
has snatched from us the ? pride of place.? By contrasting the
systems adopted by the two colonies we shall see the effect of
each, Queensland commenced with and has since continued the
.course found so successful in other countries of offering cheap
land?almost free grants ?as an inducement to settlement, and
the result has proved the correctness of her policy beyond the
most sanguine anticipations. She is flourishing and already
looking forward to the premier position, which with her great


area, fertile soil, and certain rainfall she may probably attain.
South Australia early began, and has consistently continued, a
system adopted in no other young country, of demanding a high
upset price for land as well as a course of competition which has
resulted in a scanty rural population struggling to hold its
property under difficulties, many of which have been and are
caused by the extreme values they have paid (considering the
charges for virgin soil in all new colonies) and the stringent con-
ditions enforced. We possess no homesteaders occupying freehold
lands almost without price. No man has ever settled upon our
soil under circumstances so favorable, and it may be added that
no person in South Australia has purchased country land from
the State for the last 20 or 30 years without having paid too
much for it. This is a heavy indictment against both the inten-
tion and effect of our land legislation, but is justified by the
position of the producing interests, and those who study the
subject will not venture to deny it. South Australia occupies
one side the Continent, Queensland the other; we the arid side,
they the wet. Can any one explain why land with them should
be only worth 2s. 6d. per acre, with us 20s. ? She flings her acres
lavishly away and beats us in population, prosperity, and wealth
?while we retrograde, and simply cannot retain the people we
have. They leave us, some glad to get away to where tillers of
the soil and those who turn earth?s barreness to fruitfulness are
appreciated and encouraged ; some loth to break old ties and begin
life over again among strangers; but the exodus continues and
will continue until there is a radical change in the policy of the
colony. Apparently nothing in the required direction is to be
looked for from the present Ministry, or indeed from the present
House ; but it is possible that some advance may be made in
other directions by drawing the attention of the public to the
absurdity of our existing laws, which become the more apparent
the more they are examined. In my next 1 hope to show what
in my opinion should be the policy of the future.
No. IV.
POPULATION RATHER THAN LAND.
IN studying the land systems of the United States, Canada,
and the colonies adjacent to us the aspect that must occasion
most surprise is not the consensus of opinion existing among


them that the public estate should be used as the grand prize to
draw a permanent population, but that from this fraternal course
South Australia should stand aloof and alone, tacitly proclaiming
_� Land is wealth. Behold our broad acres ! Were ever 300,000
people so rich ?? This is the reasoning that has been adopted
within the walls of the Legislature, on public platforms, and in
the pages of the press, until the thoughts and minds of the people
are imbued with it. If sold at all ?which heaven forbid?-it
must be at the highest possible price. Witness the competition
which has been a principle permeating our system of disposing of
Crown lands from first to last. What is bidding for choice,
what is tendering, but endeavoring to obtain the utmost farthing ?
Can anything be more fallacious than such arguments ; can any-
thin o- be more prejudicial to successful settlement than such
action ? It is an axiom as true as the stars that land is only
valuable to the State or individuals when occupied or productive,
yet we fail to comprehend it, or our conservatism would surely
have given place to a more liberal policy. Prosperous develop-
ment can best be achieved by economising the resources of our
pioneers rather than wringing all capital from them on the
threshold of their career.
It was an evil day for South Australia when her land
realised by the pernicious mode of competition practised such
high rates. The evil was intensified jby the short dates for pay-
ment, without laying undue emphasis on the crowning act of
spoliation, charging interest on an extravagant price. There has
been much said and written, and more virtuous indignation
expended on ? land sharks ? in this colony, but it seems to me the
most insatiable and worst shark of all has been the State. The old
auction system was intelligible in all its naked exaction, but the
cruel mockery of calling your later .systems ? unlocking the lands
or liberal is without parallel by any Government professing to
solve the problem of establishing a ? prosperous yeomanry upon
its soil ? ?I think that was the phrase frequently used by the
advocates of the so-called ? liberal measures ? which have gone far
towards landing South Australia in her depression. Far better
if the State value had been reduced one-half without competition
and thus have saved the subsequent involvement, which has
been the inevitable consequence of a most unwise procedure, the
heaviest incubus on our standing producing interest. This
principle was practically acknowledged by the Act passed
remitting large sums agreed to be paid by farmers. I hat measure
and its administration by the Minister in office at the time has
been much criticised, generally adversely. The fault was neither


in the Act itself nor in its interpretation, but that it was not
possible for legislation to right the wrong that had been done to
many of the most deserving of an industrious class. Nothing
?ever has been done, nothing could be done to assist those who
had completed their purchases, in many instances by mortgaging
other property, perhaps eventually to lose both.
Such extensive borrowing as we have indulged in could only
be justified under circumstances that were not ours, a correspond-
ing increase of population to bear the increase of interest, as well
as the works being of a really remunerative character. For
years these conditions have not been fulfilled, and South
Australia presents the spectacle of a country decreasing in the
?essential elements of population and prosperity, and growing
in debt and difficulties, attributable principally to the
land policy ; for had that been even reasonably liberal both
agricultural and pastoral settlement would have been established
?on a sounder basis, and much of our lost population retained,
immensely more land would have been occupied by settlers not
?embarrassed by financial difficulties necessarily attendant upon
working with borrowed capital. It needs no figures to
demonstrate that few, if any, of our producing interests can pay
even a low percentage on money and prosper; certainly farming
is not one of them. Rather than encourage the mortgaging of
selections it should have been the care of the State to place its
bone and muscle on the soil as far as possible free from financial
?encumbrance. Huge and irrevocable as have been the blunders
and injustices of the past to a large number of our most valuable
colonists, the future is yet our own, and it behoves us to be
warned by these errors in further attempts at land settlement,
recognising that the wealth and stability of the country is depen-
dent upon the producing interests.
The labor question in all new countries is intimately con-
nected with the settlement of the land. In South Australia this
has perhaps not been properly understood; for though we have
?endeavored, by proclaiming the high rate of wages to be obtained,
to promote the introduction of the laboring class, we have never
held out special or even any inducements to them to settle upon
the soil as agriculturists and producers on their own account. In
all prosperous progressive young communities greater numbers of
the industrial classes are attracted than employment can be found
for unless their ranks are thinned by openings being offered to
those desirous of beginning life as their own masters. We cannot
claim that the tendency of our land legislation has been in this
direction. Unless the emigrant arriving here has a considerable


amount of money he must pass on or be content to ? labor and to
wait,? for take up land he cannot. This is why so few of the
laboring class become farmers ; there is really no opening for
them allowed on our Crown lands. _ They must go to the other
colonies or remain to swell the agitation for State employment we
periodically see in our streets. It is the aim of all sound legislation
to correct this state of things, not by the borrowing of money to
construct public works more or less unproductive, but by free land,
or nearly so, on the principle adopted by America, Canada, New
Zealand, and Queensland. From the earliest enactment to the
latest farce ??working men?s blocks? at �1 an acre?there has
been no concession worthy of the name made to the ? industrious
poor ? to make homes for themselves on South Australian soil.^
The South Australian land system contains one ruling
inflexible principle which has been consistently held to as a
sacred right more precious than the truths of revelation, that the
fee-simple of the soil is worth �1 per acre, and under no circum-
stances shall it be sold for less. Previous to 1808-9 no credit
was allowed, but on the passing of the Act of that date this rigor
was sufficiently relaxed to permit of country being taken up on
four years? credit at the rate of o per cent, interest per annum
on the whole of the purchase-money. There were 48,300 acres
taken up the first year, at an average of �1 13s. 9d. per acre.
Since 1869 there have been no less than nine amending and
consolidating Acts up to 1886, increasing the period of credit
from 4 years up to 20 years, and somewhat varying without
decreasing the rate of interest. For instance, the amendment
of 1881 provided that the first instalment of interest at 10 per
cent, on the purchase-money extends over the first three years,
equal to per annum ; 4 per cent, for the next six years,
when one quarter of the purchase-money has to be paid;
5 per cent, in advance for each of the next 11 years on
the remaining three-fourths of the purchase-money ; thus
making 20 years of credit, calculated to ruin any farmer.
Before & the passing of this measure the limit of credit was nine
years, and the maximum area,of a selection 1,000 acres. Personal
residents have the preference over substituted in being allowed
to complete purchase in five years, while the latter must hold
theirs for six years. It is needless here to enter into the details
of the various Acts as they are so well known, but they certainly
do not compare favorably with the prevailing conditions of the
other colonies. I find that from the beginning of the credit
system in 1868 to the end of 1886 there have been a total of
17,225 selections, averaging 366 acres each, comprising 6,302,949


acres, and realising �8,372,449, an average of �1 6s. 6d. per acre
without including interest. The average price of land sold by
auction appears to have varied very little through all the changes
on the deferred payments principle, but to have remained at an
average of about �1 os. 6d. per acre from the foundation of the
colony. Compare the Queensland average of 2s. lid. per acre
for homestead holdings and conditional purchases at about
11s. each without interest, with our average of �1 6s. 6d. with
interest, and surely each colonist must feel his confidence in
legislators responsible for such a result considerably shaken.
The average of Victorian country land for the last 14 years is a
little less than �1 ss. per acre; her highest previous to the Land
Act of 1860 was �1 9s. per acre; her lowest, 16s. 4d., was under
the Act of 1862. The average for the total quantity, town
and country, from the foundation of the colony to 1884 was
�1 11s. 4d. per acre, the town allotments of course greatly
swelling it.
From any data at my disposal it is difficult to arrive at a
correct average of lands sold in New Zealand, as the homesteader
pays nothing ; but I find that out of a total of 17,710,027 acres
sold up to 1885, 12,558,507 sold for cash realised an average of a
little over �1 per acre. This for the rich soil of the North and
South Islands, as compared with �1 6s. 6d. for ours. The com-
parison would be much more marked if the land given away was
included. The New South Wales conditional purchase system
admitted of no competition ; it therefore follows that all land
sold under its provisions realised �1 per acre. By auction the
price obtained from 1874 to 1883 was �1 Bs. Bd. per acre for
country lands. The average of the two would be about �1 Is.,
as against our �1 6s. 6d. The total area alienated since the
foundation of the colony (other than conditionally purchased)
gives an average of 15s. 9d. per acre.
Even in the Northern Territory adjoining Queensland, with
soil and climate similar, we don?t offer the land in the same
liberal spirit. With us the lowest price has been 7s. 6d. per
acre, with her 2s. 6d. We have gone on the old lines of
borrowing to construct the only railway in the Northern
Territory, which we anticipate will in some sort of way, we
cannot fathom how, prove the Archimedean lever to raise an
unprecedented marvel of colonisation. Of course we shall
be disappointed, but as we don?t know any other mode of
settling a country than by obtaining loans of money to con-
struct unproductive public works and then borrowing some
more to pay the interest, we ought not to be blamed too much.


As to the necessary element of population to render these works
remunerative, if people fail to appreciate the advantages of living
with us that?s their loss, and we are sorry for them. We have
clone our duty by launching our daughter on her career, saddled
with a public debt. It?s not much yet, but, please God, we shall
make it big enough before the railway is run through from the
26th parallel. We are very fond when it suits our purpose of
quoting America as an example of adventurous railway construc-
tion, but we have never adopted her system, and therefore never
experienced a like success. If we had there would now be rail
communication between Adelaide and Port Darwin, with a
considerable and increasing population right through the
continent, rapidly solving a problem we have not yet begun to
understand.
? THE PATH OF PROGRESS TO PROSPERITY,?
The policy of the future should bepopulation rather than
land,? casting aside the vain fear, the unworthy jealousy, of any
one making too good a bargain out of us in anything connected
with the Crown lands. No Government can be equal to the
present position or merit the confidence of the public who clings
to the old lines marking the land legislation of the past under
which the colony has languished. Reforms should be made,
promoting rather indirect than direct benefits from the
?occupation and settlement of the country, whether it be by
laborers, farmers, or squatters. Under the necessary new
departure ?the price of land?the receipt of rent is a small
consideration ; the primary object must be the permanent creation
of a rural population, and the consequent encouragement of
productions by a liberality hitherto unknown ; without that vain
is protection to native industries and manufactories. It is but
building the mill to grind the corn that is never grown. Free
producers from every possible burden, for the very existence,
much more the prosperity, of town and country alike depends
upon them. Hold such inducements out that workmen shall
become tillers of the soil. ?To all without capital who are
desirous of taking up land say: We will give you sufficient to
make a home and a living upon it by industry and perseverance.
Recognising that our soil is inferior, or its development attended
with greater difficulties, where other countries give 50 acres we
will give 100. Following the example found so successful
?elsewhere larger areas should be sold to the men who desire to
buy at merely nominal rates of from Is. to ss. per acre, on
Referred payments, contingent upon residence for a certain time.


Under exceptional circumstances the price should be remitted
altogether in virtue of high cultivation or certain improvements,
or even prolonged residence. The payments to extend
over a number of years without interest, with a right
to purchase at a less time and take title. Conditions of culti-
vation and improvements must be easy, it being at the option of
the selector as to what use he shall make of the land either by
stock-raising, grazing, dairy farming, or any other useful under-
taking, all to come under the definition of ?cultivation.? To
stimulate an industry that will probably prove highly successful
special free grants should be given for the cultivation of vines
and fruit trees, also for irrigation and the growth of timber. For
every acre of vines in full bearing give a free grant of 20 acres,,
the same system being also applied to all industries suitable to
the country.
In framing these regulations the determination should be
acted upon that our farmers in the future shall begin with no
possible financial embarrassments with the State. To the non-
resident the price should be higher, the conditions more stringent,
but still liberal beyond hitherto conceived ideas. For cash by
auction we may sell large tracts in certain areas (not necessarily
in big blocks) at an upset price, not exceeding 7s. 6d. per acre,
and if not sold in a reasonable time a less price should be accepted..
To large capitalists tracts of country ought to be offered in exchange
for the construction of public works of utility and development.
By these means an impetus will be given to the occupation and
progress of the colony entirely wanting now. On leaseholds
abandon the right of resumption for at least one-half of the
run, making rents nominal, and not subject to competition, with
no assessment on stock, no payment for improvements, but for
undeveloped country extension of tenure by virtue of permanent
water improvements. For each and for all, of every class, from
the millionaire to the laborer, we have room in our vast estate,
and it is our interest as well as duty to endeavor to attract them.
Let us use our lands as a loadstone to draw the population of the
old world. It is the same force that has peopled the countries
just reviewed, and liberally applied it will change our wild wilder-
nesses into habitations of men. If any aspirations of mine could
avail to rouse South Australia to the duties of her position, to
the realities before her, I would breathe them in the words?Our
only path of progress to prosperity lies through ? our waste lands.?


OUR PRODUCTIONS
IT is better to be stigmatised as an alarmist or reviled as a
pessimist than to cry ? peace, peace, when there is no peace.?
Never was there a people more eager for compliments than our
own, and never was there a time when'we less deserved them.
"We dearly love to hear Adelaide described as a beautiful city,
and ourselves spoken of as a wonder-working community. Does
a week pass without writers in the press or orators reiterating
that we built the overland telegraph, or we passed the Real
Property Act; we have the finest roads in the colonies, have
constructed magnificent railways, and erected absurdly palatial
and costly buildings. It is true that we have all these things,
and a great many more expensive and unprofitable public works
which have culminated in a debt of �19,168,500 without a
corresponding increase of either population or productions. At
borrowing we bid fair to lick the other colonies into the
proverbial ? cocked hat,? and considering our youth and inex-
perience we know a thing or two about taxation. But when it
comes to the genuine old pioneering of the ? damper and mutton ?
style South Australians are far behind their neighbors. They do
not even understand the initial business of framing laws and
regulations adapted to opening up new country. Consequently
it remains in a state of nature while they squabble over ? work-
ing men?s blocks ?in and aboul the towns, Like many truths
which though wholesome may not be palatable, it is, I believe, a
fact that if our undeveloped country had belonged to New South
Wales or Victoria it would have been turned to good account
years ago. Those boundry lines across the maps have been very
potent in checking the advance of the pastoral interest. As we
unfortunately cannot efface them the next best thing for our
Legislature to do would be to repeal all clauses relating to
pastoral settlement and start afresh in a practical manner to


encourage the settlement of the unoccupied interior and conse-
quent growth of a great natural industry.
The financial position of the colony as presented by the
Treasurer affords more ground for reflection than congratulation.
I pass over the question of whether the preponderance of imports
or exports is the true test of the prosperity of a country, and
touch upon the facts as placed before us, leaving also the value of
these per head of the population ?first, because the cost price of
all produce has declined so much during the past two years ; and
secondly, because considering the continual drifting of our people
over the borders into the other colonies it is probable that the
estimate of 313,000 is excessive. But even if under the mark it
is none the less disappointing in the last degree to find we grow
so slowly in wealth of numbers. In the column headed
? breadstuff's exported ? there is little room for comfort. During
the present year we have exported 103,042 tons against 137,000
in 1878, ten years ago. Of course it ought to be pointed out
that in the interval the amount has risen to 222,596 in 1880,
242,261 in 1884, and 390,915 in 1885 ; but it cannot be contended
that the whole result from the decade is satisfactory to a people
proud of its progress and ambitious of taking a prominent posi-
tion among the foremost British colonies. Under ? wool
exported ? there is less reason to plume ourselves. The exports
for 1887 are 43,105,999 lb. compared to 41,481,758 lb. in 1878,
while for 1879 they were 57,217,297 lb, ?actually 14,000,000 lb.
more nine years ago than we now produce. Can any one explain
why this should be in a colony with such an enormous area of
waste land capable of growing some of the best w T ool, and fatten-
ing as fine meat as any in the world ? There is nothing to boast
about in the minerals column, as the export is less in value by
�146,383 for the last ten years, but a revival apparently is setting
in, and much improvement may be looked for in this branch of
our industries.
Taking note of the increases and the decreases during the
period named will now be an instructive if not a pleasant task.
According to the Treasurer, the population has increased 74,503
from 1878 to the present financial year, but only 14,897 during
the latter half of that time, plainly showing that for five years
births have not made up for the loss of adult population. The
value of imports has fallen �660,316 since 1878, and �2,530,157
since 1882-3. If we supply this enormous deficiency by our own
produce and manufactures well and good, but can we lay that
flattering unction to our souls ? Exports have increased �66,124
for the whole period, but decreased �14,245 for the last half.


Breadstuff's exported have declined 34,219 tons in the 10 years,
and increased 22,452 tons in the five, while wool sent away is
more by 1,624,241 lb. than during 1878, but unfortunately less
by 288,601 lb. since 1882-3. Tonnage of shipping has largely
increased, which at first sight appears scarcely compatible with a
decreased trade, but presumably is to be accounted for by the
visits of so many ocean steamers of a tonnage of many thousands,
and only bringing perhaps a few hundred tons of cargo. These
figures should not discourage us, but they ought to be sufficiently
startling to arouse each and all to the necessity of promptly
taking steps to develop the resources we know exist in our
unoccupied country. There is pasturage there to support flocks
and herds vast enough to enable us to establish a great wool and
meat trade with the old world after supplying our own
requirements.
The difficulties do not appear greater than have been
contended with and overcome in America.' An authority on the
meat trade of Chicago states that ? ten thousand miles of railway
are largely occupied in the transit of cattle, many days and nights
being required for a journey.? One establishment for shipping
and canning meat has a slaughtering capacity annually of 400,000
cattle, and others bring up the grand total to about 2,500,000
head. Our cousins bring their stock by rail as far or further than
it is necessary for us to do. To this it is objected that they feed
and water them in transit, and with proper arrangements we can
do the same. They, however, are contemplating more extensively
using the refrigerating car, which probably would answer our
purpose best. Articles have recently appeared in various
publications relative to this subject, in which attention is drawn
to the fact that Australia is allowing herself to be cut out of this
trade by the Americans. This is not because they possess
superior advantages, for some of the American writers admit that
the Australian meat is better than much of their own. Thousands
upon thousands of their cattle are sent to market from such cold
regions that to us it may well appear surprising that they fatten
at all. It is therefore absurd to suppose that with a climate more
favorable to the raising of stock and a pasturage producing a
better quality of meat we cannot compete with them. All we
have to do is to produce more. Where we have scores we should
grow thousands, and the market will open out by the establish-
ment of a shipping and canning trade probably somewhere on the
Transcontinental railway similar to that at Chicago. It is certain
that South Australia can never take her proper place among the
group until she has developed her waste lands now lying


unproductive and unoccupied, while she derives the supplies they
ought to afford from the other colonies. Annually we import
from our next door neighbors large numbei's of stock. For 1886
they amounted to a total of 195,000 sheep and 20,000 cattle.
For the previous year, however, they reached the high
total of 300,000 sheep and 31,000 cattle. A fair estimate
shows a total cost to the colony of about �200,000 for the one
year and �300,000 for the other. If these supplies were purchased
for purposes of manufacture and export or to stock our waste
lands it would be a matter for congratulation, but we know this
is only the case to a very limited extent, and that they are
obtained principally for local consumption ; it becomes a matter
for profound regret that the necessity exists. Our trade with
Queensland may be taken as a sample of that with most of the
other colonies. We buy from her more than we sell, and if we
wax fat out of it, it can scarcely be said we grow rich. We
import cattle, sheep, and sugar, and in return export some flour,
the balance for colonial produce being all against us. What are
the cures proposed for this state of things; and the subject is a
tough one, we shall see later on. Generally they consist of
various theories, nostrums, fads, and fallacies, though some bear
the stamp of sound common sense, and if carried into effect would
materially assist to advance the colony in the path of progress.
Nine hundred thousand square miles of country held and
owned by 300,000 people who, if they increase at all, increase by
substituting a baby and a fraction for an able-bodied man?that
is the way South Australia has been ? growing into greatness ?
the last few years ; and it is about time that something else
increased besides rabbits and sparrows. They are obviously the
most pious and progressive part of the community. They attend
to their own business, and go on and multiply; the hotter the
persecution the more they prosper. It is simply exasperating
that our cattle and sheep suffer themselves to be beaten on their
own ground by these interlopers. They evidently believe that
their destiny is to ? possess the whole earth and the fulness
thereof.? Our 300,000 souls are the present proud possessors of
of a huge territory. Scatter them over it and half of them would
never find each other again, cooey they ever so loudly. Some-
where about three square miles of country, or 2,000 acres to
every individual, yet we grow poorer year after year, of late at
any rate, in manhood power. Nor do we increase in productions
derived from this vast area. We may make better use of and
progress in the agricultural portions than we do of the essentially
pastoral parts. Cattle, horses, and sheep, like the human popu-


lation, do not obey the injunction to increase and multiply. A
Jacob with his jugglery is apparently required to work the oracle
and metamorphose our precarious few into the teeming millions
they ought to be. Not only the ?shepherd kings? we used to
hear so much about, but the whole station category down to the
common ? rouseabout,? is under a cloud, and if the country
cannot progress without them we act as if it ought not with
their assistance. What! hundreds of thousands of sheep and
cattle owned by a few men ? No, we will rather get them from
New South Wales and Queensland than permit such gross
monopoly. That, judging from results, is the sort of sentiment
prevailing in South Australia at the present time. We produce
a lot of noise but very little wool, as ? the devil said when he
sheared his hogs.? Any fad receives attention rather than the
honest first manifest duty of encountering and overcoming the
difiiculties attending the profitable occupation of our undeveloped
country. The apostles of the various creeds now engaging so
much public attention may twist and wriggle round the question
how they please ; the fact still remains that the future of the
colony depends upon her producing interests, and the successful
expansion of one of the most important of these is dependent
upon the legislation affecting our waste lands.
It has been said that in the multitude of councillors there
is wisdom, but the present position of the colony proves that
there is not one word of truth in the axiom. There is no need
to go to North-terrace, where the chosen of the people,
individually or collectively, drop their pure pearls of sage advice.
Nor need we consult the files of unworkable Acts to prove this.
Each Solon walking the pavements will tell you how to save the
country. There is one in particular who haunts me. To deny
his sagacity and mental penetration would be the height of pre-
sumption. Every one, indeed, who knows him must acknowledge
he can see through a brick wall as far as anyone, and if he depre-
cates so high a compliment that must be ascribed to his excessive
modesty. His present idea of public salvation is to sell the
land and allow people to enter into their heritage without any
restriction or delay. I listen and meditatively reply : ? Who
can doubt the future of this splendid colony with 900,000 square
miles of fine land ? ? ? Nine hundred thousand square miles of
fine fudge,? he retorts. ?Sell or give it away to those who
recognise the duty of turning it to account.? Another is
met who can pierce the intricacies of the metaphoric
brick wall as deeply as my last friend. ? Sell the land \ the
sacred heritage of my poor beloved unborn children ! Anathema


Maranatha.? And with a snort of mingled wrath and
defiance he shook the pavement as he strode away. A.
third, who never troubles himself about walls, whether of
stone, brick, or men?s opinions, exclaims: ? Borrow a hundred
millions and move the continent two degrees to the south, and
with a certain rainfall South Australia will be the finest country
under the sun.? Which is a sacred truth, but does not impart
more comfort than many other sacred truths and unrealised
dreams. ? Stuff? and nonsense,? interrupts Positive ; ? connect us
by rail with Timbuctoo and by wire with the moon. That?s
being in the van of progress, and a policy worthy of this great
country.? ? Grow wattles and be happy and rich,? asserts an
enthusiast. ? The panacea for ail evil is land nationalisation,?
in stentorian tones preaches a root and branch reformer. The
eminently practical say the only safe course is to promote the
wine industry, but the Government must exterminate the sparrow,
from whom ? good Lord deliver us ? daily sigh the vignerons, for
they are greater evils than sudden death. ? Agriculture is the
backbone of the country,? maintains the farmer, and ? to foster it
is the first duty of the State.? A few dejected souls murmur;
? Wool and meat would be the salvation of the community only
uncertainty of tenure, resumption, vermin, drought, and general
damnation.? ? All wrong together ? peals in trumpet notes the
loudest of all; ? the country cannot prosper without the totali-
zator.? As ?in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom,? it
is evident that all these are necessary for the prosperity of the
colony. I have no doubt they will some day be carried into effect,
though perhaps it will be as well to defer a few of them, say
for a century. To the reflective mind it appears just possible
that we may have too many advisers and too few actual workers.
If everybody worked as hard as they talk the results would
really be surprising. Pity so much superfluous energy is not
devoted to making the desert blossom with the productions it is
fitted for. The fact is our 300,000 people are over-weighed by
the very magnitude of the task imposed upon them. The natural
resources of the country are lying almost dormant, and the only
way to stimulate them into activity is to attract the wealth and
population of other communities to our assistance. We rather
act as if we feared their competition than were anxious for their
co-operation. Let us examine what even partially stocking some
of the country beyond the twenty-sixth parallel means to South
Australia. For example, take a belt of it 200 miles wide along the
telegraph line from Charlotte Waters to about Barrow Creek, say
400 miles by 200, some 80,000 square miles of country carrying


50 sheep to the mile, 4,000,000 head, a low estimate giving 5 lb.
of wool worth 6d. per lb., or 2s. 6d. per sheep = �500,000. Add to
this 400,000 sheep for sale annually at ss. per head = �IOO,OOO. A
total of �600,000 of exports from 80,000 miles of country out of
over 800,000 miles, probably as well adapted for stock as the strip I
have named. It must be recollected, too, that much of the land along
the telegraph line will support 100 sheep to the mile, just double
the estimate I have given. Of course some of it is better adapted
to cattle, but for the convenience of calculation I have confined
myself to sheep. Then there is an enormous extent of country
to the north of Barrow Creek certainly suitable for cattle if not
for sheep, some of which is being stocked now. The chief
entrepot for that portion of the continent may not be in South
Australian seas; but when the Transcontinental railway is
completed we certainly shall receive a share of it.
But leaving the whole of the country beyond Barrow Creek
out of our calculations, what does the'opening up and stocking
of the immense tract to the south of it mean to us ? At the
moderate estimate given for a portion of it the amount of wool
would be 80,000,000 lb., having a money value of �2,000,000 ?
nearly double the quantity we now produce, to say nothing
of the annual surplus from 16,000,000 sheep, which may
be roughly reckoned at another �1,000,000. With all this
additional raw material what would our manufactories spring
to ? Not only should we supply our own population with
meat, but a great export trade would arise, and South
Australian ports and wharfs would become centres of life and
activity. Looking now at our wild waste lands this may seem
like an enthusiast?s idle dream, but it is capable of realisation in
part at least in our own day, and in its entirety during the life of
the next generation if only wise counsels prevail. Capital and
population are the levers to work this marvellous change. South
Australia has them not, and for want of them her progress has
been stayed, and the sister colonies leave her behind in the
friendly race for pre-eminence. She must attract both by offer-
ing a liberal share in the dormant wealth lying in almost criminal
uselessness now. The utmost encouragement should be given to
develop her vacant pastures by low rentals and absolutely fixed
tenure, but special inducement ought to be held out to those
permanently watering country now destitute of the indispensable
element. It has been wisely said that ?he who makes two blades
of grass grow where only one grew before is a benefactor of his
race.? How much more is this true of those who provide
perpetual water where none existed previously ! It should be our


national policy to urge on the development of the vast interior
until it is covered with cattle, sheep, and horses. With this going
on cities will spring up as they have done in other colonies, far
beyond where agriculture has ever been attempted. Look at
New South Wales and see what towns have sprung up in her
purely pastoral districts. In Queensland it is the same, and even
in Victoria they often preceded agriculture, though much of their
later growth is owing to the vigorous extension of that interest.
As just stated, there are many flourishing towns in New South
Wales and Queensland called into existence by pastoral
pursuits. As the runs are developed they grow in importance
and wealth, and why the same should not obtain in South
Australia under laws and regulations suited to the country and
climate, it is very hard to explain. We are too apt to depreciate
our own territory, as well as enhance the value of our neighbors?.
Much of the western district of New South Wales was once
condemned as worthless by those best qualified to judge
(however much it may be extolled at present), perhaps with just
as much reason as is our own territory now. For years many of
the?at the present time?most valuable runs in that district
were nearly annually dried out and the stock travelled for water.
I could name a score that so suffered, yet the difficulties were
eventually overcome and success achieved. At this stage in the
colony?s history it is erroneous to state that the obstacles in
developing our country are greater. In much of it they are
really less. In those days wire-fencing was almost unknown,
and wire three times the price it now commands Cartage was
also more costly and difficult to obtain than at present. Then
we have a force unknown to the early pioneers, that supplied by
the camel, a most valuable and important auxiliary in opening
up new country, for he can traverse it at any time, under any
circumstances. His worth has scarcely been realised yet,
certainly not utilised fully, nor will be until stations stretch
from side to side of the continent. If Sir Thomas Elder
had done nothing more for the country than introduce the
camel he would deserve well of his fellow-colonists.
The northern railway, too, already penetrates far into the heart
of the continent, dependent upon neither drought nor animal power.
Let us hope that it will soon be continued upon a principle better
suited to the strength and population of the colony, and one that
will ensure its early completion as well as the rapid utilisation of
a now useless territory. Ever since the squatter passed beyond
the agricultural confines he has contended against greater natural
difficulties (under a system that tends to check improvements)


than he probably will further in the interior. There is every
reason to believe that nearer the heavier rainfall of the tropics
water will be found at less depth and of a pure quality. And
we may depend upon it, there it will yet be found, in some of
the most reliable country for stock in the colony. I have said
little about breeding horses. That they will thrive has been
demonstrated beyond a question. Indeed that is saying but
little, as we know that the horse of the north is unsurpassed
for strength, size, and endurance. It is probable that this
will be recognised in the course of a few years, and horses
bred in the north command the highest prices not only in the
east but in the markets of the whole world. As in the broad
pastures of the far north the horse is already superior of his
kind, so can cattle and sheep be raised superior of their kind, or
second to none in any land. That the country is subject to
droughts is a fact that cannot be overlooked. All saltbush
country wherever situated is so, but as a compensation for that it
is the healthiest for stock of any known in the world. Australia
may well be proud of her flocks and herds, for without dis-
paraging any interest she owes to them a larger portion of the
wealth of her exports than to any other industry ; and glancing
at the broad area we claim as our owm, the question is forced
upon us?ls there any other admitting of such expansion ?
