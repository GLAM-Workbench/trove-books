THE ADDRESS DELIVERED BY
Mr. J. J
Kingsbury,
at the Exhibition, Friday, 14th April.
iyr jr. KixgsbukX, on rising to address the meet-
ing, was greeted with ringing cheers, and
for some moments could not be heard. When
the audience had concluded, their demonstration
of approval of his candidature, he said that on
last Tuesday evening he had endeavoured to
speak to a public meeting and commenced by
saying ? Mr. Chairman and gentlemen.? He
had made a mistake. (Cheers and laughter.)
So far as about 400 of that audience was con-
cerned he made bold to say they were not
gentlemen. (Applause.) He thought the
public had to thank Sir Charles Lilley for
telling them what those persons were, for he
had said they were animals in pain. (Pro-
longed cheering.) But, so far as he (Mr.
Kingsbury) was concerned, he had no political
past to explain, and nothing political to
apologise for; and therefore if there was any
political life before him, in all fairness he
thought he should have been given a hearing.
Practically he was unknown to the people of
Brisbane, or at all events to the electors,
because he had during the time that he had
resided in the colony busied himself with his
own business. But he had carefully watched
the progress of political matters, as a student,
although he had had no standing in the poli-
tical arena, and was assured that as he brought
a good name into the house he would bring a
good name out with him. He believed he was
going into the Assembly? (cheers) ?and he
wished to say that, in asking the suffrages of
the electors, he had no axe to grind, neither
for himself nor for anyone else. (Applause.)
As to the Government programme, it was
short, but all the salient points were indicated
in Sir Thomas MTlwraith?s address of April 6.
These points could be shortly put as follow :
1. Be vision, economy, retrenchment. 2. Ces-
sation of borrowing. 3. Settlement of the
people upon the land. 4. Stimulation of pro-
duction. 5. Assistance to export trades. 6.
By every just form of action produce happier
relationships between capital and labour. 7.
Land-grant railways. If the foundation of a
house was gone it was absolutely useless to
make any improvements except in the way of
underpinning or strengthening the foundations.
That was what Sir Thomas MTiwraith was
endeavouring to do with regard to the colony
of Queensland, and that was what he would
carry out if the public would support him.
An opposition manifesto had been issued, but
it was notable that it said nothing at all about
the cessation of borrowing, industrial concilia-
tion, or the promotions of better relations
between the employer and the employed, it
simply spoke of : 1. Bailway concessions in
freights for farming produce. 2. Technical
teaching for agriculturists. 3. Mining on
Private Property Bill. 4. Bestrictions on
Indian, Coolie, Chinese, and Japanese labour.
5. Cessation of free immigration. 6. Home-
stead grants to families that pay their own
passages and settle here. 7. Bepeal of
civil service superannuation clauses. 8.
Legal and Defence Porce reforms. 9. Shop
and factories Bill and AVages Lien Bill. lu.
Pair distribution of local government endow-
ment, 11. Bonus for export of dairy produce.
12. Protection policy to be undisturbed. 13.
Question of separation to be settled by the
people. These did not include any fantastic
elements at all, and in them there was really
nothing to base an opposition upon. He de-
sired to direct his hearers? attention to the fact
that the land-grant railway system w~as unhesi-
tatingly adopted by the Opposition, for this
manifesto said plainly, ? Bail ways to be paid
for in land only and to belong to the State.?
Then, in the matter of the liailway Commis-
sioners, the proposal made to have one instead
of three was certainly worthy of consideration.
(Cheers.) In this manifesto there was one
fad, and that was the abolition of plural
voting, and it meant that a newchum, who
perchance could neither read nor write,
was to have the same measure of electoral
rights as the pioneers of the colony, the
captains of its .industries, or the veterans
of its professional or political life. There
w r as no vote for thrift, and property was
not to be recognised. No reason had been
advanced for this because there was no reason
for it. Another party existed, which patheti-
cally cried, ?I know you can trust me.? He
did not wish to say anything disrespectful of
the gentleman, and desired to keep all bitter-
ness out of the contest, but that cry sounded
very like the confidence trick. (Laughter.)
That gentleman also said that he stood
alone. Well, he w*as old enough to do
so, and he had been propped up between
two judges on the bench for a sufficiently
long time to give him stability, but he
was not to stand alone long, as he was to
have Mr. Glassey with him. (Applause.) To
that he (Mr. Kingsbury) had no objection, and
he had no doubt the majority of his audience
had no objection to seeing them running in
double harness. In the Government pro-
gramme ?revision, economy, and retrench-
ment? stood first, and there was no one who
could not see the necessity for economy and
retrenchment. The first duty of a Government,
as of an individual, was to fulfil its engage-
ments honourably, and this could only be done
by the exercise of economy. Some people
there were who wrongly interpreted this, and
spoke of wholesale dismissals from the civil
service ; but he pointed out that such a course
would simply mean swelling the ranks of the
unemployed, and to part with men who had
arrived at perfection in their special work was
easy, but to replace them would be very diffi-
cult. But there w r as no necessity to pay very
much attention to this, for he believed that
the Premier of this colony?Premier he was
and Premier he w r ould remain?(loud cheers) ?
had as kindly a heart as any man in Queens-
land. (Benewed cheers.; There were many
reasons for the cessation of borrowing?the
first and the best was that the colony could not
borrow any more, and the next was their
national pride. (Laughter and cheers). He
thought they could get along wdthout further
borrow-ing if they took the necessary steps to
do so. The present indebtedness of the colony
was about �50,000,000, or something like �3OO
per head for every adult male, which was too
heavy a handicap, although nearly half of it
earned nearly 4 per cent, ror the fact was that
there remained over a deficit of �7 per jffiult
male per annum w 7 hich had to be met, which
was a very heavy tax. He held that there was
only oneway of raising money without borrow-
ing, and that was by the sale of public lands
and providing for the construction of railways
by the land-grant system. (Cheers.) Where
else were work and wages to come from ? The
settlement of the people on the land was the
next matter, and all schemes having that object
in view should have a patient hearing and
careful consideration. As to protection he held
that young industries in young colonies were
very like young children, and required assist-
ance until they could stand alone, otherwise
they might never walk at all. For the assist-
ance of export trades the bonus system was an
excellent one, he thought, and one of the
healthiest forms of protection. As regarded
the matter of conciliation, there was not, he
thought, much necessity for him to say much,
but there could be no one who would dispute
the wisdom and truth of the words put into the
Government programme dealing with this
matter. As to land-grant railways, some
people said they were not wanted, but the
question seemed to be between land-grant
railways and no railways at all. It was held
by some people that land might be sold and
railways built with the money, but to his mind
there was really no difference betwnen that
principle and the land-grant system. It w 7 as
sentimentally said that they would be parting
with the heritage of their children, w T ho were
yet unborn, and yet the anomaly was that they
could mine for the mineral wealth of that land
and use it in any way they chose although it
also was necessarily a part of the heritage of
this prospective generation. They had 600,
square miles or 384,000,000 acres of land, that
was six square miles, or 3,840 acres, per adult
male unalienated and idle, and that land could
and should be utilised. The law of England
and of the colonies was that the Grown could
never divest itself of its lands, for .the Crown
was always the supreme landlord and could
resume possession at any time. The Crown
had no right to take a man?s furniture or his
goods for they were simply chattels, but it
could step in and take his land which was real
estate. England was, perhaps, the most Con-
servative of all countries, yet the Crown had
compelled landlords to reduce their rents in
Ireland and had enabled railway companies to
go through private property, fixing the amount
of compensation to be paid. He maintained
that although they could not stop the demo-
cratic sea they could cause it to proceed by
evolution instead of revolution, and he thought
they could trust their unborn children' to look
after themselves. The law to which he re-
ferred was laid down in the first chapter of
Williams?s ? Principles of the Law of Beal
Property ? : ? The first thing, then, the student
has to do is to get rid of the idea of absolute
ownership. Such an idea is quite unknown to
the English law. No man is in law 7 the abso-
lute owner of lands. He can only hold an.
estate in them.? No offers to make land-grant
railw r ays had as yet come from the old country,
and were not likely to until wdiat he regarded
as the loafer?s terrorism had been stamped out.
(Cheers.) Years ago capital ?-the aggregated
thrift of the people of England ?flowed into
the colony, but it had now ceased to come since
the new 7 unionism had discovered that capital
was a curse. (Cheers.) Since then capital
had ceased to curse the colonies, and building
societies, banks, and merchants had been
ruined, and business was at a standstill. They

were crying for bread, while new 7 unionism

The question which had been handed up
referred to a Shop and Factories Act, and Mr.
Kingsbury said he was in favour of and would
vote for a bill framed on the recommendations
of that section of the commission with which
he had agreed as a member of the commission.
The candidate also said he was in favour of a
vote for thrift and a vote for property as well.
In regard to the release of the unionist
prisoners, he read an extract from an inter-
view with Sir Charles Lilley, which appeared
in the Bydney Daily Telegraph , in which
Bir Charles said that political interference
with the sentences of prisoners tended to
weaken the authority of the judiciary, and
that the same remark would apply to the
remission of sentences. He (ML Kingsbury)
said he agreed with Sir Charles� Lilley
there. In reply to :a question in regard to
State-aided village settlement, he said he
thought the Government should make an ex-
periment on a small scale, and if it was suc-
cessful then it ought to be done on a large
scale. He was also in favour of the appoint-
ment of a Minister for Public Health. On
another question in regard to the accuracy of
the ? Land Grab Map,? he said that the map
which was being prepared by competent and
faithful officers m the service showed that the
Land Grab Map ? was a wilful perversion of
the truth, and a disgrace to the journals which
had published it.
The questions were answered to the apparent
satisfaction of a large majority of the audience.
The Chairman spoke a few words in sup-
port of Mr. Kingsbury?s candidature, and
urgea the electors to disregard the contingent
vote, and go straight for Sir Thomas M 4 llwraith
and Mr. Kingsbury.
Mr. G. T. Bell, in moving a vote of con-
fidence in Mr. Kingsbury, said that they wanted
sound commercial men in. the House now.
They had had too much law in the past.
Mr. D. P. Milne seconded the motion,
which was put, and supported by a perfect
forest of hands. Only a few hands were held
up against the motion, and the result was
received with loud cheers.
The proceedings terminated with cheers for
Mr. Kingsbury and Sir Thomas MTlwraith.
