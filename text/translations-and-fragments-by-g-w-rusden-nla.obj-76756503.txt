fensMktts.
From the German of VON SALTS. *
Deep is the grave and still,
Fearful its precincts lone ;
It hides with gloomy veil
A realm to all unknown.
Notes of the nightingale
Thrill not within its breast;
The flowers of friendship fall
On a hillock?s mossy crest.
The bride, without avail,
Bereaved, wrings her hand ;
The voice of the widow?s wail
Frets not that unknown land.
Yet other spot is none
To soothe the weary breast;
The gate of Death alone
Is herald of our rest.
The heart, ?mid frequent woes,
Tost by the storms of Fate,
Attains no true repose
Till it hath ceased to beat.
* My good friend Ludwig Leichardt, the Australian explorer,
was greatly pleased with this translation from his native tongue.
From TASSO.
In unripe youthfulness thou didst resemble
The deep dyed rose which .not to summer?s rays
Nor genial time its virgin breast displays,
But in its green home blushingly doth tremble :
Or, rather wast thou like (for earthly mould
Hath nought like thee) Aurora, when the fields
With pearls she sprinkles and the mountain gilds,
Shining in heaven, serene and dewy cold.
On thy ripe age Time no restraint imposes;
Nor, though in rich array, the eye doth shun
For youth?s fresh beauty thy unrivalled worth.
Thus is the flower more sweet when it uncloses
Its odorous leaves, and thus the mid-day sun
More bright than at its dawning lightens forth.


From TASSO.
Lady, I yield not in Love?s offering
To them who outwardly its power reveal,
Though in my breast its treasure I conceal
Nor open it with flowers of my Spring.
With wandering glances and with humble mien,
With broken speech and changing countenance,
Let others prove their love?s allegiance,
In tender sighs or graceful language seen.
Whether the air be chill or warmly clear,
Whether the sun be present or depart,
Let them pursue, as hounds, the woodland deer ;
Where none may see, I seek you?in my heart :
Vaunt only of the fervor latent there,
And glory in my secret faith apart.
From PETRARCH. CCLXXI.
Not the stars wandering o?er the tranquil sky,?
Not the barque buoyant on the placid main,
Nor rush of steel-clad knights upon the plain;
Not agile herds in deep woods darting by,?
Not the fresh tidings of expected joy,?
Not love?s sweet commune in impassioned vein,?
Not, by close founts and meadows green, the strain
Of beauteous damsels chanting melody;?
Nor ought of joy henceforth my heart shall own,
If its possession causeth me to lose
Her who alone gave light to my sad eyes ;
Life?s ourden is to me so weary grown,
That to see her once more I ask its close,
Though ne'er to have beheld had been more wise.
From PETRARCH.
Some creatures arc there of so daring sight
That they can look unscathed upon the sun ;
Others, with faculty of weaker tone,
Emerge from shelter only with the night;
And others, prompted by insane delight,
Who sport with fire, and by its splendors won
Tempt its destroying power and are undone.
Amid the last am I, in w r eary plight,
Who have not fortitude to endure the glance
Of my heart?s queen, and cannot rest secure
In shady places, or in hours of gloom,
Because with mournful mien and step unsure
My destiny impels me to advance
There, where her brightness must my heart consume.

In beauty clothed she moveth modestly,
As if she were a being from on high
Come down to earth to shew a marvel here.
So grateful seems the vision from above
The heart drinks sweetness from th? entranced eye
Which would mock Fancy if it were not proved.
And from her lips it seems as there were moved
A delicate spirit, breathing full of love
Which ever biddeth the rapt soul to sigh.
Quid sum, miser, tunc dicturus ? What shall my wretchedness abjure ?
Quern patronum rogatnrus, What patron then can I conjure,
Cum vix justus sit secures ? When scarce the just shall be secure .

Rex tremendae majestatis!
Qui salvandos salvas gratis,
Salva me, fons pietatis.
Recordare, Jesu pie,
Quod sum causa tuae viae ;
Ne me perdas ilia die.

Redemisti Crucem passus:
Tantus labor non sit cassus.

Donum fac remissionis
Ante diem rationis.
Ingemisco, tanquam reus;
Culpa rubet vultus meus :
Supplicanti parce, Deus.

Qui Mariam absolvisti,
Et latronem exaudisti,
Mihi quoque spem dedisti.
Preces meae non sunt dignae
Sed tu bonus fac henigne,

Et ah haedis me sequestra,
Statuens in parte dextra.
Confutatis maledictis,
Flammis acribus addictis,
Yoca me cum henedictis.

Whose grace thy chosen doth redeem,
Save me! Thou Fount of Love extreme
Remember, Jesu merciful!
I caused thy travail pitiful:?
Spare?in that day of terror full.
Seeking me, here, thou wast outworn ;
Redeeming me. thy Cross was borne;
Let not such labour be forlorn.
Just Judge ! severe in execution,
Grant me thy gift of absolution
Before the day of retribution.
Sorely I groan, like one convicted;
Deep on my cheek is shame depicted :
Be not thy wrath on me inflicted.
XIII.
Thou who Mary didst forgive,
Who didst the dying robber shrive,
Even to me some hope dost give.
My prayers to thee cannot aspire,
Grant, of thy pity, my desire,
Let me not burn in endless fire.
Not with the goats, good Lord, discard me;
Among thy sheep a place afford me;
On thy right hand my lot award me.
When the accun-t, from thy face driven,
With bitter pangs of Hell are riven,
Oh ! call me With the blest to Heaven.

A PROLOGUE
Written and Spoken by the Poet Laberius,
(A Roman Knight whom Caesar forced upon the stage.)
Necessitas (cujus cursus transversi impetum
Voluerunt multi effugere, pauci potuerunt)
Quo me detrusit pene extremis sensibus ?
Quern nulla ambitio, nulla unquam largitio,
Nullus timor, vis nulla, nulla auctoritas,
Movere potuit in juventa de statu:
Ecce! in senecta, ut facile labefecit loco
Viri excellentis, mente clemente edita,
Submissa placide blandiloquens oratio.
Etenim ipsi Di denegare cui nil potuerunt,
Hominem me denegare quis posset pati ?
Ego bis trecenis annis actis sine nota
Eques Romanus ex lare egressus meo;
JDomum revertar mimus. Nimirum hoc die
Uno plus vixi, milii quam vivendum fuit.
Fortuna! immoderata in bono asque atque in malo,
Si tibi erat libitum literarum laudibus
Floris cacumen nostrse famam frangere,
J'i ? -T ... 1 ? _ ? ? J XIT
Cur, quum vigebam membris praviridantibus
S itisfacere populo, et tali quum poteram viro,
Non floxibilem me concurvasti, ut carperes?
Nunc me quo dejicis ? quid ad scenam nffero,
Decorem fornue, an dignitatem corporis ?
Animi virtutem, an vocis jucundte sonum P
Ut hedera serpens vires arboreas necat,
Sic me vetustas amplexu annorum enecat;
Sepulcro similis, nil nisi nomen retineo.
Necessity (whose force so many try
To shun, and yet so few successfully),
Where dost thou cast me in my failing years ?
Whom no cajoling, bribery, or fears,
No force or influence could in youth abase,
See! in old age corrupted, from my place
How easily I fall within the reach
Of one great man?s bland and persuasive speech.
But yet to him, whom nought the Gods deny,
How could refusal go from such as I ?
Having lived threescore years exempt from shame,
From home this morn a Roman knight 1 came :
I shall return there a buffoon?this day
Dooms me too long by much on earth to stay.
Fortune! immoderate both in good and ill,
If ?twas permitted thee to wrest the skill
Of letters, to a blight to blast the flower
Of my full fame, why, in an earlier hour,
When my young limbs were redolent with power,
Didst thou not bow me, flexile in my knees,
The mob, and if I could, their lord to please ?
Now, whither dost thou drag me ? what can I
Bring to the scene of grace or dignity ?
What strength of mind or pleasing tone of voice ?
As creeping ivy the tree?s strength destroys
So in the embrace of years decays my frame;
And, tomblike, I retain nought of myself but name.


BURNS? CENTENARY.
(Written in an English Colony.)
This day, auld warld, an hundred turns
Of simmer leaves, and winter thorns,
Ye?ve seen sin? Scotland?s Robbie Burns
His race began,
Whose meteor track, still bright, adorns
His native lan?.
There in the ?toilworn cottar?s? shed,
Defying scarce the winter dread,
That tender plant was housed and fed,
Whose sturdy bough,
Branched o?er the world, we see outspread
Aboon us now.
Sweet bard o? Kyle ! whose glowing soul
E?en ? Penury chill? could not control;
Whose mantling wit o?erflowed the bowl,
Was meant to bear it;
What storms around thy youth did roll
To cloud thy spirit 1
I see thee by the ingle-side
O?erwhelmed in sad reflection?s tide,
Half-fed, half-clothed?a thing which pride
Wi? scorn would shun?
Doubting thy talent misapplied,
Thy youth undone.
Unknown, or known with sneers ; rejected
By thy Jean?s lowly sire ; dejected,
Drooping ; alas ! scarce self respected,
Exile in view?
What power remains, by which protected,
Thou?lt rise anew ?
What bard was e?er like thee distrest ?
Yet something stirs within thy breast;
Resolve ?prepared, at worst or best,
To do at length
Some deed shall make auld Scotland blest
In her son?s strength.


And ? now?s the day, and now the hour !?
See, Coila comes t? assert her power ;
As streameth forth when clouds most lour
The levin flash,
As after fiercest heat doth shower
Rain?s welcome plash.
Ay! crown him ! bind the holly bough
Round thine own Burns? immortal brow,
And he, so poor so lonely now,
From age to age
Shall cast on thee a living glow
Thro? history?s page;
Not the dull almanac of fact ?
Of who did this or other act ?
But who, of feeling all compact,
In ev?ry home
Can, heart to heart, mankind attract
Where?er they roam.
Ay ! herds of kings shall follow on,
Be wept in form and limned in stone,
And long forgotten, ere the moan
Shall find relief
Was made for him who wore by Boon
Tny holly leaf.
When shall auld Scotland hear among
Her groves and streams such mellow song,
Such woodnotes wild in luscious throng
As flowed from him,
Who yielded up his whole life long
In natural hymn ?
But why such theme with words o?erlay ?
Round the wide world, this natal day
Attests o?er man his grateful sway?
Behold us here,
The general instinct prompt to obey
In southern sphere.
Yet reverent aspect let us wear ;
Burns spurned all trappings insincere,
His iron pen all shams laid bare :
Ye who feel not
Self-accusation?s warnings here,
Avoid this spot.
But ye who own your strength unstable,
Who boast not that yourselves are able
To repel ills which found him feeble?
Ye?and none other
Come?humbly mourn around this table,
Your friend and brother,


One anxious thought his soul oppressed
From youth to early death confessed
? One useful deed? to do at least
For Scotland dear,
And who from Scotland?s loving breast
Iler Burns shall tear ?
Keep ! Scotia ! keep thy greatness, sprung
From virtue?s scenes thy cots among,
And may that hymn thy Cottar sung
In sacred tone,
Sink in our hearts till each free tongue
Its guidance own.
Nor let lip-service only move,
For Britain?s homes our filial love :
May manly, pious actions prove
We here renew
Those scenes?so dear to Him above?
Burns? pencil drew.
GLENARA.
Farewell, Glenara ! steeply crested
Aiming thy rocks, like eagle nested ;
Farewell thy slopes with verdure breasted,
And ah ! farewell
The happy hours, with joys invested,
I maunna tell.
In silence, lang thy charms thou?dst kept,
While Heaven?s free winds aboon thee swept;
In thy rock neuks the beasties crept
Frae year to year,
Ere yet the European stept
Thy precincts near.
Wae?s me ! the mortal risk thou?st stood !
Had some white Goth of modern brood
Clutched thee in mercenary mood,
Thou?dst been shorn down,
A bare and leafless solitude,
Scarce out of town.
Thy rocks had seemed a quarry?s wreckin?,
Thy burn had mourned its native breckan,
Thy trees had lang ago been crackin?
In blackened him,
Had Walter Clark not pity taken
Upon thy doom.
And now, the spoiler hath not reft
That beauty which was Nature?s gift:
Wild flowers still close thy granite?s rift;
Hoarse on the rock
Whirls in the chasm by ages cleft
Thy torrent?s shock.


Still on thy cliffs with lichen grey
The rough briar trails its tangled spray ;
Still down thy glen the birdies stray
Their throats to cool,
Where meets their ken, in sultry day,
Thy rock-bound pool.
Ye flichterin? birds ! ye fiow?rs sae sweet!
A s under this grey cliff I sit,
It gars me grieve I may not meet
Your winsome airs
Wi? household words whose sounds would greet
Your British peers.
Nae doot, ye?ve names in science drumly,
But where are they which, lisped half dumbly,
Frae infants to their mither comely
Tutoring their tongue,
Made bird and bush companions homely
The woods among.
Ah ! sounds so sweet to British ear !
Whether the lark or laverock clear,
The thrush or mavis warble near,
Cushat or dove!
Wi? childhood?s friends peopling the air,
And forms of Love !
Haste! Haste! ye tutelary powers,
Winning the heart from Life?s stern hours,
To own each joy th? Almighty showers
Around our way;
Oh! grant us ?mid Australian bowers
Your genial sway.
Thus only can a people rise,
Happy beneath the southern skies,
Bound to the soil by holy ties
Of love and home ;
Grown on its breast, and, patriot-wise,
Linked to its doom.
Thus may Australia?s sons aspire
To Wallace?, Hampden?s sacred fire;
And thus may Burns? poetic lyre
An echo find,
If Nature, wooed by young desire,
Subdue the mind.
But ah ! how hard the task to teach
A nation?s lore ; to guide its speech ;
And, heart to heart, each answering each,
Our lifestrings bend,
Till, wheresoe?er the eye may reach,
It finds a friend.


Hail! then, to him who in the van,
Works here upon the ancient plan,
Who nature meets with gentle han?,
Nor would destroy
A single blade the eye may scan
With added joy.
Then, graceful rear your tender stem,
And fragrant bloom each flower for him ;
Ye birdlings ! chaunt your sweetest hymn
In minstrelsy,
When, wandering by this rocky brim,
Your laird ye spy.
Here, Nature ! show your earliest Spring ;
In Summer wave your coolest wing ;
Your mellowest fruits in Autumn bring :
In Winter too,
Temper your blasts, remembering
His care for you.
And lassies! you,?for how could Nature
Be dear without her fondest feature ?
Here rain your charms on ev?ry creature ;
For ye maun mark
That nane but gentle spirits cater
Near Walter Clark.
WITH A FLOWER.
Go, tender token ; from the earth?s mild bosom,
From each kin leaf and hyacinthine blossom
I seize thy bloom,
Henceforth to glow where care should never fling
Ungentle gloom,
Where even death to thee, so placed, shall bring
An envied doom.
Go, while thou Hvest, cradling thine azure charms,
Where thou may?st prove no more life?s vain alarms:
Too happy wreath!
What wouldst thou more ? Is there not on thee sent
Angelic breath F
Are there not on thee lustrous glances bent
Thou faint?st beneath ?
Treasure those glances! prize them while thou may?st
Ere envious Time thy native hues shall waste ;
Such bliss to see
The mighty of the earth in vain have striven ;
Blest shalt thou be !
Would thou could?st speak for him by whom thou?rt given,
Remember me !


Yes ! when those stars of my idolatry
Scatter their lightning beams in revelry,
Say?think of me!
When blighting shadows dim that radiant gaze
Say?think of me :
That joy to heighten, or that gloom to chase
Were bliss to me.
Yet, since like every joy that I have known
Thy memory must be fleeting, not alone
Thy leaves I give,
But wing thee with my thought, whose truthful tone
Might hope to live
Did not my heart in deep words to be shown
Too vainly strive.
Oh! if these words, this token, ? Think of me,?
Could court thy thoughts whene?er I think of thee,
Though far away,
With shattered force grief should from me depart
Shrunk in dismay,?
Finding that, lone and world-worn though my heart,
Hope dwells with me.
Then, lady, trust not thou the treacherous tongue
Imputing faults which not to me belong ;
Know, thou hast strucken
Chords, which, in silence though they long have lain,
Yet are not broken:
Lo ! thou bestow?st the flower of Hope;?again
I clasp the token.
LINES.
As in the stilly hour of night
The stars look down from high ;
So would I gaze on one most bright,
And so, while gazing, die.
What if the gfare of day?s broad beam
Wither mine hour of joy,
Still would I treasure fancy?s dream,
Still hope, though erringly.
Instinct with light, the stars shower down
The pulses of their life;
So would I peril, too, mine own
For bliss so dear, though brief.
With the deep fervor of true love
To gaze upon the source
Whence flow the charms the heart that move
With unresisted force:


To know that gaze returned, to feel
Around, within, a weight
Of mysteries in my being thrill
With raptures, wild but sweet;
To yield to Passion's whelming sway,
To feel its throb within,
Nor check the pulse?s maddening play,?
Oh! could such bliss be mine!
Alas! ?twere vain for the sons of men
To hope on earth to cherish
That bliss which angels strove to gain,
Which yet they knew to perish.
And, haply, in the purple skies
The stars which seem to shine
In joy, hut feed the fire which preys
On prisoned hopes within.
Would that I were a bodiless spirit
Round my heart?s shrine to stay,
Bringing all beauteous fancies near it,
Wafting all ills away.
Would that I were a melody,
Floating around the home
Of thoughts whose only harmony
Is that from thee they come.
Oh! thus my few short hours I?d breathe,
Then fleet from life away,
And keep?despite the touch of Death?
My life?s sweet memory.
SONNET.
Wrapt in the chilling winter of the North,
Reft of all joy save hope?s enduring ray,
With longing eye imploring for the day
Life?s latent glories which may usher forth,
With what a thrill of soul the sunlit earth
Inspires the exile as he takes his way,
Pausing to view the mysteries which the birth
Of morn unfolds where all was chill and gray.
So, to the heart in darkness which hath lain,
That form whose chiselled beauty doth not yield
To the bright spirit it enshrines within,
Appeals with regal splendor, which, revealed,
Might make immortals proud to entertain
That commune which from us, in grace, is not withheld.


SONNET.
Based on the mountain?s forest-crowned crest
Day?s brilliant ruler lingered to survey
The mellowing glories of th? empurpled West.
One cloud hung o?er, in radiant imagery?
Cradling its dews in elemental rest?
And glowed with thirsting avarice to absorb
The mysteries of the Day-God?s fiery orb.
At Truth?s flame thus should Genius? lamp be lit,
Thus throned in light should Genius ever sit
But lo! the labyrinthine shades of night
Shrouded with wan embrace the struggling light;
That cloud?a vapor dull?deforms the sky ;
Thus erring Genius, reft of light from high,
Fades in Time?s withering gloom, and blots Eternity
THE SAILOR?S HOME (A Song).
With hearts as free as our own blue sea,
We dance on the crested wave,
Leave care behind on the flaunting wind,
And the water deep its grave.
Our bark now glides o?er ocean?s tides,
And the surface gleams with fire;
Those quivering gems, as the wave she stems,
Are the diamonds we desire.
Let others praise the festal blaze
And the glance of beauty?s eye;
To the stars above will we make love,
Our canopy the sky.
The feathery spray that marks our way
Shall rival the goblet?s foam ;
In the whispering wind a kiss we?ll find,
On the wave a boundless home.
SONNET.
Fair as the lily by the streamlet growing,
Moving unconscious of her loveliness,
Was she for whom our mutual tears are flowing
Death, envying, saw the world that shape possess,
As infant?s guileless, and as seraph?s pure,
And sped his javelin with an aim too sure.
Yet, boast not, tyrant! o?er thy beauteous prey:
Immortal was the form thou would?st destroy;
On earth our memory guards it from decay,
While the pure spirit heavenward wings its way,
Bathing in glories of eternal day ;
Joyous that thou must render to the sky
The loved on earth to share that bliss which ne?er may cloy,


WHITSUNTIDE HYMN.
When Earth?s foundations first were laid
In dark primaeval night,
God?s Spirit moved upon the deep ;
God spake?and there was light.
With varied hues the mountains rose,
The streams their courses owned,
All Nature sprang to light and life,
And Man creation crowned.
Still as they sang in Paradise
The birds their carols sing ;
The flowers their grateful incense yield
To their All-Gracious King;
But?starting like a broken bow?
Man?s stubborn will rebelled
?Gainst the sweet peace he knew when first
God?s glory he beheld.
When, sunk in moral gloom, frail man
Was steeped in sin and shame,
God?s Spirit brooded o?er the waste,
The blest Immanuel came:
Sin cowered throughout the guilty world,
Hope cheered the breast of man,
While, borne by messengers of grace,
Redemption?s tidings ran.
0 ! thou whose Spirit poured from high
At wondrous Pentecost,
Kindled the first disciples? hearts
Touched by the Holy Ghost, ?
Grant to thy children gathered here
Thy Spirit from above,
That henceforth they may yield the fruits
Of Faith and Hope and Love.


BOOK 1. ODE 5.
Pyrrha, what graceful youth in roses lying,
Thy pleasant grot doth share,
And bathed in odors, views thee deftly tying
For him thy yellow hair ?
Neat in thy simpleness! How oft in vain
Thy broken faith he?ll mourn,
And fickle Gods ?borne on the gloomy main
Wondering, aghast, forlorn ?
Who now, all credulous, in thy golden snare,
Doth deem thee ever sweet
And guileless ?blind to thy deceitful air.
Ah! wretched they who meet,
Unwooing, thy allurements. As for me,
My dripping suit, made o?er
With votive scroll to Him who rules the sea,
Declares, ?I cruise no more.
G. W.
BOOK 2. ODE 3.
My Dellius ! brief-lived mortal, wouldst thou be
From carking cares and vain distraction free,
In good or ill an equal mind thou?lt know,
Modest in pleasure, not bowed down by woe.
Whether thy days bring nought but life-long sorrow,
Or luxury sway thy each returning morrow?
Feast following feast, and choice Falernian wine
Chasing dull care with endless anodyne ;
Where pine trees vast and quivering poplars spread
O?er thy recumbent ease their friendly shade,
And rippling ?gainst the bank, the rushing stream
Fleets by, the emblem of thy summer dream.
Hither bring wines and odors ! hither, flowers
Of fragrant roses, ah! how short their hours ;
While yet thy means, thy age shall give thee leave,
And the dark web the fatal sisters weave.
Thy home, thy forests which so widely \yaved,
Thy villa which the yellow Tiber laved,
Thy sumptuous mansions proudly reared on high,
Soon, ah! too soon, another shall enjoy.
Or be thou rich, or sprung from ancient race,
Or poor, or some vile offshoot of disgrace,
Nought matters it, thou?lt yield thy idle breath
A feeble victim to remorseless Death.
The same dark fate engulphs us all; on all,
Sooner or later, the same lot shall fall:
For each the fatal urn shall bring his doom,
The everlasting exile of the tomb.
G. W.


BOOK 2. ODE 16.
Caught in the wild iEgean storm,
When clouds the starry dome deform
And hide the moon, the voyager distressed
Implores for rest.
For rest the savage Thracian cries,
The Mede with glittering quiver tries; ?
Rest, which nor gems, nor gold, nor luxury
Can ever buy.
Grosphus, nor wealth, nor consular power
Avail to soothe the anguished hour,
Or drive away the cares that mar life?s woof,
Neath groined roof.
With little he lives well, whose board
Gleams with his salt in heir-looms stored ;
His gentle sleep, nor fear, nor cravings base
Away can chase.
Why overbold fret we our time ?
Why seek we change from clime to clime ?
What exile, from his country prone to run,
Himself can shun?
To climb the ship, curst Care hath wings,
To troops of cavalry she clings,
Fleeter than roe, than wind, when clouds are riven,
Eurus driven.
Glad in the present, future cares
The mind contemns, and crosses bears
With easy smile. Thorough felicity
In nought can be.
Quick Death cut short Achilles? strength;
Old age Tithonus wore at length.
Something, perhaps, the hours may give to me,
Denied to thee.
Thy kine are of Sicilian breed,
Countless thy flocks. The harnessed steed
Neighs out for thee. The deep-dyed Afric hue
Thy robes endue.
On me no lying fate conferred
A humble plot?a spirit stirred
By the Greek muse, spurning with temper proud
The scoffing crowd.
G. W. E.
BOOK 2. ODE 17.
Why with complaints thus rack my heart,
Maecenas ? ?twere not kind .to fate,
Nor me, if thou should?st first depart,
Glory and pillar of my state.


My soul?s best half, if thou art reft,
Why linger I?all languishing
And shattered, what of me is left ?
One common fall that day shall bring.
Not faithless was the oath I took:
When thou tak?st flight, we both will go,
Companions ready for the stroke,
On our last pilgrimage below.
Not dread Chimera?s fiery breath,
Nor, should he rise, all Gyges? hands
Rive me from thee, though plunged in death;
Thus justice strong, thus fate demands.
Whether the Scorpion?s awful power,
Or Libra?s star its influence gave,
Or the Goat swayed my natal hour,
The tyrant of the western wave;
Howe?er it be, strange sympathy
Our stars evince. Heaven?s mighty king
From impious Saturn set thee free,
And stayed thy keen fate?s hurrying wing.
When the full theatre did thrice
Reverberate the public joy,
A falling branch had hushed my voice
Had not the Faun?s right hand been by,
The guard of Mercury?s votary.
Pay thy rich sacrifices now,
And rear the votive temple high;
A humble lamb fulfils my vow.

BOOK 2. ODE 19.
Bacchus I saw (believe my speech)
Mid rocks remote his lyrics teach
To docile nymphs, while at the sound
Goat-footed Satyrs pricked their ears aroupd.
Evoe! with recent fear my breast
Quakes, by the God of wine oppressed,
Ecstatic. Evoe. Bacchus, spare
Who, awful, dost the weighty thyrsus bear.
I?ll sing thy Bacchanals? fierce pranks
Thy rivers which fill full their banks ;
Thy fount of wine, thy milky stores,
And honey which from hollow branches pours.
Now in my lyrics may be told
Of thy blest spouse ?mid stars enrolled;
How Pentheus? roofs found swift decay,
And how the Thracian tyrant passed away.


Thou rul?st the streams, the barbarous sea;
In mounts secluded, ?tis by thee
Bistonian bacchants, without fear,
Wreathe harmless vipers in their knotted hair.
Thou, when thy parents? realm sublime,
The giant band would, impious, climb,
Ferocious in thy lion-guise,
Hurl?d?st back the aspiring Ehoetus from the skies.
Although reputed fitter far
For sports and dances than for war,
Thou rushest equal to the fray?
In peace or war thou bear?st the palm away.
Thy horn of gold when Cerberus saw
Harmless he wagged his tail with awe;
Abject, thy Godhead to entreat,
His triple tongue licked thy departing feet.
G. W. E.
BOOK 3. ODE 2.
To bear the pangs of poverty
By sharpest discipline our youth should learn ?
The savage Parthians let him ply,
With horse and spear, dreaded at every turn.
Be perils in the field his life:
Him, when from hostile battlements shall spy
The blooming maid, or tyrant?s wife,
? Let not our untrained monarch,? she will sigh,
? That lion in the field engage,
Dreadful to touch?rushing with talons gory
Through thickest slaughter in his rage.?
To die for fatherland is joy and glory.
Death follows with unerring track
E?en him who flies; in vain from him retreat
Youth?s warless knees or timid back.
Virtue is ignorant of base defeat,
With unstained honour she doth shine;
She neither taketh up nor layeth down,
As vulgar voices would incline,
The consular axes or the civic crown.
For those unjustly doomed to die
She opens heaven; the way denied explores;
Spurns of the common rout the rabble cry,
And from dull earth with mounting pinion soars.
And silent faith hath sure reward ;
The man who Ceres? mysteries would reveal
Shall never share my humble board;
With him I tempt no risk on fragile keel.


Oftimes neglected Deity
In ruin of the guilty whelms the pure;
Rarely the villain who would fly
Is spared by Vengeance, which, though halt, is sure.
G. W. R.
BOOK 3. ODE 5.
Heaven?s thunders prove the reign of Jove ;
On earth Augustus will be held a God,
To whom the Britons subject prove,
Who Persia sways with Rome?s imperial rod.
Could Crassus? craven legions wed
Their barbarous brides, and pass old age (Oh ! shame
To senate, citizens decayed!)
Latin by birth, but Medes in all but name ?
King-servers?cultivating fields
For their new kinsmen ?Rome?s proud name forgot,
Gown, vestal fires, and sacred shields?
Though Rome and tutelar Jove had perished not!
?Twas this, with his prophetic mind,
That Regulus shunned, scorning conditions base,
Leaving ill precedent behind,
Engendering woe upon the coming race,
Should pity follow captive bands
In death. ? I?ve seen exposed in Punic fanes
Rome?s ensigns?have seen hostile hands
Tear from our troops their arms with bloodless pains,
? I?ve seen free Roman soldiers yield
Their hands to be fast bound behind their back?
The gates of Carthage wide?the field,
Tilled, we once wasted in our martial track.
Will fiercer fight your ransomed hind ?
You but add loss to shame. Never its hues,
Once lost, the garment brings to mind,
Though it be steeped in medicated juice. *
??Nor can true valour, once decayed,
Return to craven breasts. If by the doe,
Released from snares, be battle made,
He will be brave who to the treacherous foe
? Surrendered?he, in future strife
Press Punic foeman, who with thongs was boun I,
Nor deemed them shameful, clutching life,
Dreading Death?s terrors like an abject hound.
? Unworthy true life to embrace,
Confounding peace with war! 0, bitter shame!
0 Carthage great, in pride of place
Towering o?er ruins of Italian name.?


Thus spake the hero ; waved aside
Chaste wife, young children, as he were disgraced,
And with glance fierce, like that of pride,
His manly looks upon the ground he placed,
Till by his rede of unknown sound
The wavering senate to his will was wrought;
And, troops of weeping friends around,
The noble Kegulus his exile sought.
What barbarous torturers could provide
He knew, but not the less unmoved he went;
Turned his opposing friends aside,
And crowds who strove his going to prevent;
As if, his patron dues fulfilled,
And strife allayed for those who owned him chief,
He wandered to Yenafrian field,
Or by Tarentum?s sea-shore sought relief.
G. W. B.
BOOK 8. ODE 29.
Come, scion of a royal line,
With me the scent of roses share,
And quaff with me the mellow wine,
With fragrant unguent on thy hair.
Haste! gaze not still on Tiber dank,
On fields iEsulian sloping wide,
Backed by the heights, in serried rank,
Of Telegon the parricide.
Leave your proud splendour, your vast piles,
That almost to the clouds have clomb;
Dwell not for ever on the smiles,
The smoke, the wealth, the roar of Eome.
Oft grateful to the rich is change ;
And humble roofs with simple fare,
Eemote from luxury?s lavish range,
Have smoothed the wrinkled brow of care.
Cepheus reveals his hidden fire,
And Procyon glares with angry eye;
The lion?s star is red with ire,
The sun brings back the season dry.
Now plunge into the thickets cool
The languid flock and weary herd,
Or seek the shade and river-pool:
By not a breath the leaves are stirred.
You, fearful, musing day by day
Devolve what best becomes the state,
If plots at Balkh, or far Cathay,
Or troublous Don, her sway should threat.


Beneath impervious gloom of night,
Wise providence the future hides ;
Man, eager past the bounds of right,
The prescient Deity derides.
Deal rightly with the present. Aye,
In Tiber?s fashion flows the rest,
Now gliding to th? Etruscan bay,
A gentle current with calm breast:
Now, when fierce floods his channel vex,
A turbid moil of wasted flocks,
Of orchards whelmed with household wrecks,
Mid crashing woods and crumbled rocks.
Lord of himself and blest is he
Who can declare I?ve lived to-day;
If foul or fair the morrow be,
No power the past can take away.
The moments we have left behind
Not Jove himself can render nought,
Nor scatter aimless on the wind
What once the flying hours have brought.
Rev?lling in her insulting game
Dame Fortune works with savage glee ;
Flings here and there uncertain fame,
Now kind to him, and now to me.
I praise her present at my hearth ;
She flits?her favours I resign :
I wrap myself in conscious worth,
And dowerless poverty is mine.
What reck I when the vessel strains
Neath adverse blasts ? I need no prayer
To imprecate for Tyrian gains,
Or ask the Gods my freight to spare.
Let riches fill the hungry sea:
My humble skiff shall safely glide,
From the iEgean tumult free,
With twin-born Pollux for my guide.
G. W. R.
BOOK 4. ODE 7.
The snows have fled; the fields resume their green,
The trees their tresses;
The shrinking rivers flow their banks between
With mild caresses.
The undraped graces, now by nymphs surrounded,
Lead sylvan measures;
The waning year warns us our joys are bounded?
Stealing Time?s treasures;

The winds breathe balm ; the Summer follows Spring?
Himself to vanish:
Fruit-laden Autumn, who rich gifts shall bring,
Winter shall banish.
But the fleet moons the season?s loss repair;
When die we must,
And join the good and great, we find nought there
But shade and dust.
Who knows if this day?s sun the morn shall crown
By grace of heaven ?
Thy heir may vainly clutch to make his own
Thy wealth love-given.
When, dead, Torquatus, thou shalt hear the rede
Of Minos o?er thee;
Birth, eloquence, and piety shall plead,
But not restore thee;
Not Dian for chaste Hyppolite could contend
With shades infernal,
Nor Theseus break the chains which bound his friend
In bonds eternal. G. W.
BOOK 3. ODE 30.
A BRASS-surviving monument is mine,
Loftier than pyramids which kings enshrine ;
Rain shall not mar it, nor rude Boreas? tears,
Nor the long lapse of ever-circling years:
?Tis built. Not wholly shall I die. A part,
Best of myself, shall ?scape Death?s withering dart.
While the high priest the Capitol shall climb
With vestal mute,my praise shall grow with time:
My name shall live where Aufidus shall brawl,
Where rustic Daunus pours his streamlet
From humble state I have become so strong,
Because to Rome I taught iEolian song.
Grant, willing Muse ?the guerdon won?to wear
Thy crown of Delphic laurel on my hair.
