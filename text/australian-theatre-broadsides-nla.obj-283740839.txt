GRAND PRODUCTION OF
JOSEPH py CANAAN.
i ME, GEORGE RIGNOLD in presenting this dramatised version of the well-known Biblical
story, trusts and believes it will be found acceptable, not only to those who are regular Theatre
| goers, but even to many of those who conscientously. though perhaps, mistakenly, entertain a pre-
judice against the stage. Many years before the story begins, a vast horde of Invaders had swept
in from the East and established themselves as rulers. The Kings of that period were, therefore
not true Egyptains. Many conspiracies were set on foot, especially by the patriotic’Priests to*
throw oil' the Foreign yoke and were ultimately successful.
The Drama is set towards the end of the rnle of the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings, 3 000 years
ago, or 16 centuries before the time of Cleopatra. The main plot takes place in Ancient Egypt
and will reveal modes of life, social and religious customs, etc., as far as careful study of the
ancient records has made this practicable. The Biblical foundation of the Play cannot offend
■the most scrupulous.
Landlady (deferentially) ; “ Mr. Smith,
do you suppose that the first steamboat
created much surprise among the fish
when it was first launched.”
Smith (curiously) ; “I can’t say marm,
whether it did or not.”
“ Oh, I thought from the way you eyed
the fish before you that you might acquire
some information on that point.”
Smith (the malicious villi an) ; “Very
likely, marm—very likely ; but it’s my
opinion, marm, that this fish left its native
element before steamboats weie in-
vented.”
Mrs. Sharptongue : “ D’ye mean t’ say
you’ve been married ten years, an’ never
had a quarrel with y’r husband ? ”
Fair Stranger ; “ That is true, madam.”
“ And ye always let him have the last
word?” -jq
“Yes, madam; I wouldn’t for the
world do anything to lessen my husband’s
love for me. He might get careless.”
“ Careless? ”
“Yes. We are jugglers by profession,
and at two performances every day I
stand against a board while he throws
the knives.”
From the recent census in Germany it
appears that a stonemason in Elbing is
blessed with no fewer than twenty-two
sons.
A woman never loses her interest in
the other woman whom her hnsband may
have thought of marrying when she was
a girl.

My Dear Tottib,
Yon will be sorry to learn
that my engagement with Dick is off.
Dear Dad found that he was a married
man with Twins and furniture on the
Hire System. When I knew the truth
I had a good cry and flew to my dear
cousin Florence for consultation. What
do you think drove my tears away ?
As I entered her room Elorrie was
cleaning her Kettles and Cans, Pots and
Pans, with FERRET BRAND SOAP,
and the work it was doing was so
amusing that thoughts of Dick van-
ished.
Elorrie told me in all earnestness
that it WILL WASH CLOTHES, and
make your hands as soft as silk.
Yours affectionately,
Cissie.
P.S.—You can buy FERRET BRAND
SOAP (Norton’s Pumice Patent) every-
where at Id. per Tablet and 4d. a
Bar.
P.P.S. —Elorrie tried it in salt water.
It lathers beautifully.
P.P.S.S.—Do clean your teeth with
it. It is exquisite.

sausage already cut in two and places it
under his arm with the cut end to the
back. In less than no time his comrade,
who stands behind him, cut off a fairly
thick slice. The first marauder, who
■tneanwhile pretended to feel for his money
in his trousers packet, takes the sausage
iri his hand, shows it to the shopman, and
asks :
“ How much ? ”
“ Thirty sous.”
“ Thirty sous ? That is too dear.”
And with a look of disappointment he
puts what remains of the sausage down
on the counter and goes away with his
comrade to share the spoil. Very funny—
except for the pork butcher.

“ Are you the wife of Mullet, the coal
porter ? The wealthy Herr Yon Knicker
called on me this morning, and drew my
attention to your unhappy circumstances
He told me that you are going to be
turned out of your lodgings, as you cannot
pay your rent.”
Poor Woman ; “It is, alas, too true ! ”
Secretary; “ Who is your landlord ?”|
P. W.; “ That same wealthy Herr Yon
Knicker! ”
The following is authentic. An old
maid, reputed wealthy, occupied a de-
tached house in the neighbourhood of
E , along with a deaf servant maid.
She owned a monkey which followed her
everywhere and slept in a corner of her
bedroom. One night a burglar broke in-
to the house and stabbed the poor old lady
in the back. Having accomplished the
deed without making a noise, he began to
ransack the drawers and cupboards. The
monkey, who had witnessed the proceed-
ings, took up the knife, and while the
would-be murderer was stooping over an
open drawer, plunged the blade into his
back. Having committed this act of re-
venge, he ran to rouse the servant, who
went to the assistance of her wounded
mistress, The old maid was saved, but
the assassin was stone dead.

At the Milliner’s.—Wife ; “Do you
rdally think, dear, that this bonnet
matches my hair ? ”
Husband (tired of waiting) ; “ What
does it matter ? If it doesn’t, all you have
to do is to get another—set of hair.”
